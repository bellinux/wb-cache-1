While some told the Sisters {{they were going to}} hell, others asked questions and offered thanks and hugs; the event was generally reported as positive.|$|E
25|$|The {{period during}} which <b>adolescents</b> <b>were</b> judged as {{desirable}} extended from puberty until {{the appearance of a}} beard, the hairlessness of youth being an object of marked taste among the Greeks. As such, there were cases of men keeping older boys for lovers, but depilated. However, these kept boys were looked down upon, and if the matter {{came to the attention of}} the public they were deprived of citizenship rights once come to adulthood. In one of his discourses (Against Timarkhos, I, 745), Aeschines argues against one such man in court, who in his youth had been a notorious escort.|$|E
25|$|Nearly all {{of almost}} 500 cases of sodomy between persons {{concerned}} {{the relationship between}} an older man and an adolescent, often by coercion, {{with only a few}} cases where the couple were consenting homosexual adults. About 100 of the total involved allegations of child abuse. <b>Adolescents</b> <b>were</b> generally punished more leniently than adults, but only when they were very young (under ca. 12 years) or when the case clearly concerned rape did {{they have a chance to}} avoid punishment altogether. As a rule, the Inquisition condemned to death only those sodomites over the age of 25 years. As about half of those tried were under this age, it explains the relatively small percentage of death sentences.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, in , Kutner and Olsen refuted {{claims that}} violent video games cause an {{increase}} in violent behavior in children. They report there is a scientifically non-significant trend showing that adolescents who do not play video games at all are most at risk for violent behavior and video game play {{is part of an}} adolescent boy's normal social setting. However, the authors did not completely deny the negative influences of violent (M-rated) video games on pre-teens and teenagers: Kutner and Olson suggested the views of alarmists and those of representatives of the video game industry are often supported by flawed or misconstrued studies and that the factors leading to violence in children and <b>adolescents</b> <b>were</b> more subtle than whether or not they played violent video games.|$|E
25|$|The Alliance theory {{perspective}} of male-male sexual behaviour in early humans states that this behaviour was {{a feature that}} developed to reduce aggression between different males and to enforce alliances. It is believed that young adult males and <b>adolescents</b> <b>were</b> segregated from society and living {{on the outskirts of}} communities due to their perceived sexual threat by the older men. Therefore, same-sex behaviour allowed younger men to have reinforced alliances with other older males, which later gained them access to resources and females which were both scarce at the time. Similarly, Kirkpatrick states male-male sexual behaviour has occurred {{in part because of the}} reciprocal-alturism hypothesis. The older male receives sexual gratification from the relationship whilst the younger male has to bear the cost of engaging in non-reproductve sex. However, the younger male is able to later receive the social benefits discussed, through this same-sex alliance. This relationship can be viewed as a resource exchange.|$|E
25|$|On 4 August 1978, {{high school}} and {{university}} students, along with other popular movement sectors, organized the mass movement's first urban protest of the Lucas García period. The protests, intended as a march against violence, were attended by an estimated 10,000 people. The new {{minister of the interior}} under President Lucas García, Donaldo Alvarez Ruiz, promised to break up any protests done without government permission. Having refused to ask for permission, the protesters were met by the Pelotón Modelo (Model Platoon) of the National Police. Employing new anti-riot gear donated by the United States Government, Platoon agents surrounded marchers and tear-gassed them. Students were forced to retreat and dozens of people, mostly school-aged <b>adolescents,</b> <b>were</b> hospitalized. This was followed by more protests and death squad killings throughout the later part of the year. In September 1978 a general strike broke out to protest sharp increases in public transportation fares; the government responded harshly, arresting dozens of protesters and injuring many more. However, {{as a result of the}} campaign, the government agreed to the protesters' demands, including the establishment of a public transportation subsidy. Fearful that this concession would encourage more protests, the military government, along with state-sponsored paramilitary death squads, generated an unsafe situation for public leaders.|$|E

According to Jewish historian Joseph Schwarz, most of the Muslim population managed to flee beforehand to the nearby hills.

The majority however, {{like most of the}} Jews of Safad and Tiberias, fled to Jerusalem.|$|E
2500|$|A study {{performed}} at the University of Texas at Austin examined over 9,000 American adolescents to determine how their engagement in problematic behavior (such as stealing, fighting, and truancy) was related to their friendships. Findings indicated that <b>adolescents</b> <b>were</b> less {{likely to engage in}} problem behavior when their friends did well in school, participated in school activities, avoided drinking, and had good mental health. The opposite was found regarding adolescents who did engage in problematic behavior. Whether <b>adolescents</b> <b>were</b> influenced by their friends to engage in problem behavior depended on how much they were exposed to those friends, and whether they and their friendship groups [...] "fit in" [...] at school.|$|E

Results stated that teenagers believed that oral sex for dating and non-dating adolescents was less threatening to their overall values and beliefs than vaginal sex was. When asked, teenagers who participated in the research viewed oral sex as more acceptable to their peers, and their personal values than vaginal sex.|$|E

[...] Surveys conducted in Argentina, Hong Kong, and Canada have each indicated the most common reason for drinking among adolescents to relate to pleasure and recreation; 80% of Argentinian teens reported drinking for enjoyment, while only 7% drank to improve a bad mood. [...] The most prevalent answers among Canadian <b>adolescents</b> <b>were</b> to [...] "get in a party mood," [...] 18%; [...] "because I enjoy it," [...] 16%; and [...] "to get drunk," [...] 10%.

2500|$|Homeless {{youth who}} {{identify}} as LGBT {{are more likely}} than non-LGBT homeless youth to experience clinical depression or depressive symptoms as well as other mental health problems. A [...] 2006 study using survey data of homeless lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth in eight cities found that 62 percent of lesbian, gay and bisexual homeless youth had attempted suicide, compared to twenty-nine percent of non-lesbian, gay or bisexual youth. LGBT youth are 8.4 more times likely to attempt suicide if they are rejected by their family as a teen than if they are not rejected. In particular, a 2004 study based on interviews of homeless youth in the urban Midwest indicated that lesbian youth were more like than heterosexual females to show signs of post-traumatic stress disorder, suicidal ideation and attempts, and among gay, lesbian and heterosexual youth, lesbian <b>adolescents</b> <b>were</b> more likely to report caretaker and street victimization as well as mental health problems.|$|E
2500|$|Under the [...] "evolving {{standards}} of decency" [...] test, the Court held {{that it was}} {{cruel and unusual punishment}} to execute a person who was under the age of 18 {{at the time of the}} murder. [...] Writing for the majority, Justice Kennedy cited a body of sociological and scientific research [...] that found that juveniles have a lack of maturity and sense of responsibility compared to adults. <b>Adolescents</b> <b>were</b> found to be over-represented statistically in virtually every category of reckless behavior. The Court noted that in recognition of the comparative immaturity and irresponsibility of juveniles, almost every state prohibited those under age 18 from voting, serving on juries, or marrying without parental consent. The studies also found that juveniles are more vulnerable to negative influences and outside pressures, including peer pressure. They have less control, or experience with control, over their own environment. They also lack the freedom that adults have, to escape a criminogenic setting.|$|E

2500|$|Mass {{killings and}} rapes by the Egyptian troops {{took place in}} Hebron after they {{captured}} the city from the rebels. About 500 rebels and inhabitants were killed, and 750 Muslim men were taken as conscripts. Another 120 <b>adolescents</b> <b>were</b> taken by Egyptian officers [...] "to do with as they wanted", according to historian Baruch Kimmerling. The Jews of Hebron had not participated in the rebellion, but Egyptian soldiers who entered the city ignored this. For three hours, troops committed atrocities against the people of Hebron. [...] The Jews were not subject to Pasha's conscription policy but suffered the [...] "most cruel outrages" [...] and were targeted for [...] "special violence". While many Muslims managed to escape the impending danger, the Jews remained, confident {{they would not be}} harmed by the Egyptians. Apparently, the Jews of Jerusalem had received an assurance from Ibrahim that Hebron's Jews would be protected. In the end, seven Jewish men and five girls were killed. Isaac Farhi also described violent attacks on the Jews of Hebron committed by Egyptian soldiers. He writes that the attack in Hebron was even worse than the plunder in Safed. Synagogues were desecrated, houses were ransacked, and valuable items were stolen leaving the Jewish community of Hebron destitute. The massacre succeeded in uniting Hebron's Sephardic and Ashkenasic communities, but it took until 1858 for the community to fully recover.|$|E
2500|$|A {{retrospective}} study {{has shown that}} 40% of adult panic disorder patients reported that their disorder began {{before the age of}} 20. In an article examining the phenomenon of panic disorder in youth, Diler et al. (2004) found that only a few past studies have examined the occurrence of juvenile panic disorder. They report that these studies have found that the symptoms of juvenile panic disorder almost replicate those found in adults (e.g. heart palpitations, sweating, trembling, hot flashes, nausea, abdominal distress, and chills). The anxiety disorders co-exist with staggeringly high numbers of other mental disorders in adults. [...] The same comorbid disorders that are seen in adults are also reported in children with juvenile panic disorder. Last and Strauss (1989) examined a sample of 17 adolescents with panic disorder and found high rates of comorbid anxiety disorders, major depressive disorder, and conduct disorders. Eassau et al. (1999) also found a high number of comorbid disorders in a community-based sample of adolescents with panic attacks or juvenile panic disorder. Within the sample, <b>adolescents</b> <b>were</b> found to have the following comorbid disorders: major depressive disorder (80%), dysthymic disorder (40%), generalized anxiety disorder (40%), somatoform disorders (40%), substance abuse (40%), and specific phobia (20%). Consistent with this previous work, Diler et al. (2004) found similar results in their study in which 42 youths with juvenile panic disorder were examined. Compared to non-panic anxiety disordered youths, children with panic disorder had higher rates of comorbid major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. <b>Adolescents</b> <b>are</b> {{the healthiest}} age {{group of the}} {{population}} but many studies show that period of adolescence is marked by significant morbidity and mortality. Health indicators of <b>adolescent</b> population have <b>been</b> getting worse during past decades. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine mortality rate of adolescents in the Republic of Serbia to determine most common causes of death in adolescence and to explore regional differences in adolescent mortality. Materials and methods: Documentation tables of vital statistics in the Republic of Serbia in 2004, and Documentation Tables of Census 2002 were used. The causes of mortality were classified according to ICD 10. Results and discussion. Specific morality rate in the Republic of Serbia is 32. 08 on 100. 000 adolescents. The leading causes of death in adolescence are injuries, malignancies and non specified causes, and there are significant regional differences, as well as gender and age differences. The mortality rate of male <b>adolescents</b> <b>is</b> about 2. 4 times higher than the mortality rates in female adolescents. The mortality rate of older <b>adolescents</b> <b>is</b> significantly higher than mortality rate of younger adolescents. The mortality of <b>adolescents</b> <b>is</b> higher in Vojvodina than in Central Serbia. Precise data of external causes of death do not exist in vital statistics in our country. Conclusion. The mortality of <b>adolescents</b> <b>is</b> high, especially for older male adolescents (15 to 19 years of age) and majority of deaths among <b>adolescents</b> could <b>be</b> prevented.
