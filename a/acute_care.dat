40|$|Background: Women {{have more}} {{frequent}} and severe ischemic strokes than men, and {{are less likely to}} receive treatment for acute stroke. Primary stroke centers (PSCs) have been shown to utilize treatment more frequently. Further, as telemedicine (TM) has expanded access to <b>acute</b> stroke <b>care</b> we sought to investigate the association between PSC, TM and access to <b>acute</b> stroke <b>care</b> in the state of Texas. Methods: Texas hospitals and resources were identified from the 2009 American Hospital Association Annual Survey. Hospitals were categorized as: (1) stand-alone PSCs not using telemedicine for <b>acute</b> stroke <b>care,</b> (2) PSCs using telemedicine for <b>acute</b> stroke <b>care</b> (PSC-TM), (3) non-PSC hospitals using telemedicine for <b>acute</b> stroke <b>care,</b> or (4) non-PSC hospitals not using telemedicine for <b>acute</b> stroke <b>care.</b> The proportion of the population who could reach a PSC within 60 minutes was determined for stand-alone PSCs, PSC-TM, and non-PSCs using TM for stroke care. Results: Overall, women were as likely to have 60 -minute access to a PSC or PSC-TM as their male counterparts (POR 1. 02, 95 % CI 1. 02 - 1. 03). Women were also just as likely to have access to <b>acute</b> stroke <b>care</b> via PSC or PSC-TM or TM as men (POR 1. 03, 95 % CI 1. 02 - 1. 04). Discussion: Our study found no sex disparities in access to stand alone PSCs or to hospitals using TM in the state of Texas. The {{results of this study suggest}} that telemedicine can be used as part of an inclusive strategy to improve access to care equally for men and women...|$|R

5|$|Anderson et al. argue that, {{aside from}} <b>acute</b> <b>care,</b> {{emergency}} medicine can {{also play a}} significant role in public health. Vaccinations for many diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis can be administered by emergency departments, patients can be targeted for specific interventions such as counseling for substance abuse, and conditions like hypertension can be detected and treated. Emergency departments are excellent locations to train health care providers and to collect data, because of the high number of patients. Emergency medicine also improves public health by preventing secondary disease developing from an initial presentation (initial symptoms), and it serves as the first line of defense in disaster scenarios.|$|E
