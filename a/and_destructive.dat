5|$|Coral {{reefs and}} shallow marine environments are threatened, {{not only by}} natural events and {{increased}} sea temperatures, but also by such man-made problems as pollution, sedimentation <b>and</b> <b>destructive</b> fishing practices. Pollution {{may be the result}} of run-off from the land of sewage, agricultural products, fuel or chemicals. These may directly kill or injure marine life, or may encourage the growth of algae that smother native species, or form algal blooms with wide-ranging effects. Oil spills at sea can contaminate reefs, and also affect the eggs and larva of marine life drifting near the surface.|$|E

5|$|Four Everglade {{species of}} sea turtle {{including}} the Atlantic green sea turtle, the Atlantic hawksbill, the Atlantic loggerhead (Caretta caretta), and the Atlantic ridley (Lepidochelys kempii) are endangered. Also, the {{leatherback sea turtle}} (Dermochelys coriacea) is threatened. Numbers are difficult to determine, since males and juveniles do not return to their birthplace; females lay eggs in the same location every year. Habitat loss and illegal poaching <b>and</b> <b>destructive</b> fishing practices are the biggest threats to these animals.|$|E
5|$|Giant Schnauzers {{have been}} {{described}} as trustworthy with children. They are very intelligent, and can become bored easily. They are also very energetic and highly spirited, which, when coupled with boredom, can lead to unwanted <b>and</b> <b>destructive</b> behavior. They are easily trained, and deeply loyal to their owner. Some breeders believe that pepper and salt colored Giant Schnauzers are more docile than their black-furred counterparts.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} the bluespotted ribbontail ray as Near Threatened. Although still relatively common and widely distributed, this species faces continuing degradation of its coral reef habitat throughout its range, from development <b>and</b> <b>destructive</b> fishing practices using cyanide or dynamite. In addition, its populations are under heavy pressure by artisanal and commercial fisheries, and by local collecting for the aquarium trade.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} centuries, the Byzantines were usually on the defensive, and avoided open field battles, preferring {{to retreat to}} their {{fortified}} strongholds. Only after 740 did they begin to launch counterstrikes of their own, but still the Abbasid Empire was able to retaliate with often massive <b>and</b> <b>destructive</b> invasions of Asia Minor. With the decline and fragmentation of the Abbasid state after 861 and the concurrent strengthening of the Byzantine Empire under the Macedonian dynasty, the tide gradually turned. Over a period of fifty years from ca. 920 to 976, the Byzantines finally broke through the Muslim defences and restored their control over northern Syria and Greater Armenia. The last century of the Arab–Byzantine wars was dominated by frontier conflicts with the Fatimids in Syria, but the border remained stable until {{the appearance of a}} new people, the Seljuk Turks, after 1060.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Cosme was {{an unusually}} large {{tropical}} cyclone that made landfall in south-western Mexico in June 1989. The third tropical storm and second hurricane of the 1989 Pacific hurricane season, Cosme formed on June 19 from a tropical wave, the storm initially moved westward before being upgraded into Tropical Storm Cosme. It ultimately intensifying into a Category 1 hurricane. Cosme turned northward and made landfall near Acapulco during the night of June 21. It rapidly weakened over land. The storm caused excessive rainfall on land, leading to deadly <b>and</b> <b>destructive</b> flooding. It is estimated that 30 {{people died in the}} hurricane.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Paul was a {{particularly}} deadly <b>and</b> <b>destructive</b> Pacific hurricane which killed a total of 1,696 people and caused $1.156billion in damage. The sixteenth named storm and tenth hurricane of the 1982 Pacific hurricane season, Paul developed as a tropical depression just offshore Central America on September 18. The depression briefly moved inland two days later just before heading westward out to sea. The storm changed little in strength for several days until September 25, when it slowly intensified into a tropical storm. Two days later, Paul attained hurricane status, and further strengthened to Category 2 intensity after turning northward. The hurricane then accelerated toward the northeast, reaching peak winds of 110mph (175km/h). Paul made landfall over Baja California Sur on September 29, and subsequently moved ashore in Sinaloa, Mexico the next day.|$|E

The 2007 findings also emphasized the need to determine the most likely areas of spawning, to identify any parasite or disease that may be impacting the reproductive capabilities of pallid sturgeon, and to examine engineering possibilities that may permit recreation of suitable habitats without reducing the USFWS's ability to protect people from harmful <b>and</b> <b>destructive</b> flooding, and to maintain its ability to provide adequate water impoundment for irrigation and recreation purposes.|$|E
5|$|In {{explosive}} eruptions, {{the eruption}} of magma {{is driven by the}} rapid release of pressure, often involving the explosion of gas previously dissolved within the material. The most famous <b>and</b> <b>destructive</b> historical eruptions are mainly of this type. An eruptive phase can consist of a single eruption, or a sequence of several eruptions spread over several days, weeks or months. Explosive eruptions usually involve thick, highly viscous, silicic or felsic magma, high in volatiles like water vapor and carbon dioxide. Pyroclastic materials are the primary product, typically in the form of tuff. Eruptions the size of that at Lake Toba 74,000 years ago, at least , or the Yellowstone eruption 620,000 years ago, around , occur worldwide every 50,000 to 100,000years.|$|E

5|$|Magic is {{a common}} ability in the game, and several {{character}} classes use it. Spells are divided into two groups: White, which is defensive and healing, and Black, which is debilitating <b>and</b> <b>destructive.</b> Magic can be bought from White and Black magic shops and assigned to characters whose occupation allows them to use it. Spells are classified by a level between one and eight, with four White and four Black spells per level. Each character may learn only three spells per level. White and Black Mages can potentially learn any of their respective spells, while Red Mages, the Ninja, and the Knight cannot use most high-level magic.|$|E
5|$|The 1906 Mississippi {{hurricane}} was {{a deadly}} <b>and</b> <b>destructive</b> hurricane during the 1906 Atlantic hurricane season. The fourth hurricane of the season, {{the system was}} originally observed in the western Caribbean on September 22; however, modern research revealed that the system became a tropical depression on September 19. The system slowly intensified, eventually becoming a major hurricane by September 24. The system made landfall near Pascagoula, Mississippi, during the evening of September 27, devastating the cities of Pensacola and Mobile {{and the state of}} Mississippi. Damage totaled to at least $19,221,000, and more than 134 people were killed.|$|E

It formed in the southern Caribbean on October9 and strengthened as it moved northwestward, becoming a hurricane on October 12. After crossing the western tip of Cuba, it peaked in intensity on October16, corresponding to Category4 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. That same day, the hurricane moved in a counterclockwise loop and hit Cuba again. It then tracked toward Florida, landing near Cape Romano. After moving through the state, it hugged {{the coast of the}} Southeastern United States on its way out to sea.|$|E

5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} the round ribbontail ray as Vulnerable. It cannot withstand heavy fishing pressure {{due to its}} low reproductive rate, and there is widespread degradation of its coral reef habitat, including from agricultural runoff <b>and</b> <b>destructive</b> fishing practices such as blast fishing. This species is caught by commercial and fisheries throughout its range, using line gear and trawls. One region where it is heavily pressured is in Indonesian waters, where it and other large rays are taken intentionally and otherwise by tangle netters, longliners, and trawlers operating off Java, Bali, New Guinea, and Lombok. All landed individuals are brought to market for human consumption.|$|E
5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{listed the}} {{reticulate}} whipray as Vulnerable. Its large size, inshore habitat preferences, and slow reproductive rate render it susceptible to overfishing. Although specific data is lacking, significant declines in overall ray catches {{have been documented}} within its range, including in the Gulf of Thailand, the Arafura Sea, and off Pakistan. Habitat degradation also threatens this species: over 30% of the mangroves in Indonesia and Malaysia have been cleared since 1980, while pollution <b>and</b> <b>destructive</b> fishing practices may have also taken their toll. Australian waters offer the reticulate whipray a refuge from fishing pressure, as there it is not targeted commercially and the installation of Turtle Exclusion Devices (TEDs) have reduced bycatch mortality. However, there are indications of increasing illegal fishing in Australian territory by Indonesian vessels.|$|E
5|$|The {{season began}} with record-breaking {{activity}} with four named storms, including two major hurricanes, developing {{by the end}} of June. Accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) values exceeded 300percent of the average for the month of June. Activity abruptly diminished thereafter, with July, August, and September seeing record low storm development. The Eastern Pacific season proper ended with Tropical Storm Georgette's dissipation on September23, a month before the climatological mean. The year's final cyclone, Omeka, developed in the off-season on December18, marking a record-late formation date in the satellite-era. Although there were relatively few storms, the season proved exceptionally deadly <b>and</b> <b>destructive.</b> Torrential rains associated with Agatha and Eleven-E killed well over 200people in Central America and Mexico and left more than $1.5billion in damage.|$|E
