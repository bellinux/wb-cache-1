5|$|The press {{surrounding}} the Barker case {{led to the}} first calls <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Boy</b> in the Box. Frank Guthrum, who discovered the boy, {{had decided not to}} call the police until he listened to reports of the Barker case on his car radio.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the initial}} {{suspicion}} of foul play, the death was ruled an accident; {{a case of}} starvation and exposure as Barker was unable to escape the closet. Investigators concluded that Barker died on February 28, three days after her disappearance. As a result, the mayor ordered closet doors to open more easily. The press surrounding the Barker case also led to the first calls <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Boy</b> in the Box.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens in}} a deserted, {{destroyed}} school hallway with Lee's character shown {{sitting on the}} ground. As the first verse begins, he slowly begins {{to stand up and}} makes his way through the hallway. The boy then sees a female teacher in a classroom who's stricken with fear and closes the door, realizing that the boy is the cause of the damage. As the boy makes his way outside the school building, a police car arrives and the teacher rushes outside to tell the policeman <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy,</b> who then quickly rides a bicycle home to pack his things. While at home, he sees a news report about the incident, causing him to quickly gather his things to flee. Several policemen then appear outside {{the front door of the}} boy's house, while he tries to escape through the back door. The boy realizes that the door is locked so he uses his telekinetic powers to grab the keys from the kitchen bench. The policemen then enter the house to find that the boy has escaped, but find a teddy bear and a plush frog floating in the air. The final scene shows the boy running away from a SWAT team in the woods. The boy is caught by one of the men who pushes him to the ground. The video ends with the boy using his supernatural powers once again to push the men away in a burst of power; this references how the boy destroyed the school in the first place, as he's in the same position he was in at the beginning of the video. The aftermath of the outburst in the end, however, remains unknown.|$|E

500|$|The album {{features}} 25 tracks, 12 {{of which}} last five seconds of silence, making the first 1 {{minute of the}} album all silent as respect for a fan named Justin, which had the 10th track, or 22nd, named after him. The concept of the song [...] "Justin" [...] was <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> with the same name dying of intestinal cancer. His last wish was to meet the members of Korn. [...] Winston-Salem Journal writer [...] Ed Bumgardner [...] described Korn's work as having [...] "shaped rap, metal, and punk into a sonic maelstrom that is brutal, aggressive - and reasonably musical". [...] The Daily News said that [...] "the band shovels chunky beats into an already complex sound..." [...] Michael Mehle of Rocky Mountain News said, [...] "For the uninitiated, the classic Korn sound comes rumbling out of the speakers on the first cut: It's On! grinds fuzzy guitars, thunderous beats, and shouts of gut-wrenching rage into an anthem for the alienated", and gave other positive remarks. The Charlotte Observer said the album was dark, but humble. A Zeeland high school assistant principal {{said in an interview}} for a Michigan newspaper that the music is [...] "indecent, vulgar, obscene,and intends to be insulting". She said this after giving a student a one-day suspension for wearing a shirt with Korn on it.|$|E
2500|$|The girl {{may have}} been taken away from the boy, and even given to someone else: In {{the last part of}} Turkish lyric found in some sources, the boy says [...] "I won't give you [...] to others", and in some of its variations, the girl writes the boy's death sentence. In the Persian version the girl is unkind and flees away. Both Armenian versions, are <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> {{complaining}} that the unkind girl has rejected her. In Armenian Sari Aghjik, the girl has chosen someone else over him.|$|E

6000|$|... "Perhaps on {{the whole}} it would be wiser to say nothing <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> to Comus. He doesn't always respond to {{directions}} you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now I've {{told you}} {{everything}} that I know <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> from beginnin to end; and it's a blessed relief to me. Did ye ever hear the like?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, yes, it {{does seem}} to. But don't you think {{maybe it was the}} Hannibal people who were mistaken <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy,</b> and not the St. Louis people.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, don't keep interrupting, children, or {{we never}} shall get on," [...] said Frank, more anxious to hear <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> that were than the girl that was not.|$|R
50|$|Gutei heard <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy's</b> mischief. He seized him {{and cut off}} his finger. <b>The</b> <b>boy</b> {{cried and}} ran away. Gutei called and stopped him.

60|$|Rollo, however, {{learned a}} good deal <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys,</b> and <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{arrangements}} they made for travelling, and also learned a great many particulars in respect to the adventures they had met with in coming over the mountains.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why {{so anxious}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy?</b> is he of kin to you?" [...] said Gadarn {{in a tone}} that seemed to convey the {{slightest}} possible evidence of contempt.|$|E
60|$|Rudolph was {{coughing}} pitifully, his slender frame wracked by the convulsion of {{each new}} attack. Barney had placed an arm <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> to support him, for the paroxysms always left him very weak.|$|E

60|$|After he was gone, Frank told, {{as if he}} {{had just}} thought of it, <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> that had fooled them so, at Pawpaw Bottom; and he was {{surprised}} at the way his mother and his Uncle Henry questioned him up about it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed I am not by {{any means}} {{indifferent}} about her; but--but, you know, I have never seen her, and, to tell the plain truth, my anxiety <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> drove her out of my mind for the moment. Have you found her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] {{said his}} sister, [...] "I {{strongly}} suspect something wrong <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys.</b> Fergus was very odd and silent {{last night when}} I asked him about Jem Horner's picnic, and he said something about that Harewood cousin being an unmitigated brute." ...|$|R

5000|$|An {{injunction}} {{was imposed}} on the media after the trial, preventing the publication of details <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys.</b> <b>The</b> worldwide injunction was kept in force following their release on parole, so their new identities and locations could not be published.

60|$|Harding felt amused at {{the tone}} of superiority in the youngster's voice; yet he had a curious, half-conscious feeling that there was {{something}} he recognized <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy.</b> It was not that he had met him before, but that well-bred air and the clean English intonation were somehow familiar.|$|E
6000|$|... "There, Master Trench," [...] he said, [...] "you'll find a lump o' pork in {{that bag}} {{to keep you}} goin' till ye get hold o' somethin' else.
