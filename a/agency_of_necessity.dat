In Anglo-Saxon common law, {{the courts}} have allowed <b>agency</b> <b>of</b> <b>necessity</b> to develop to meet the {{prevailing}} commercial needs, but also restricted its development through the imposition of demanding criteria. After summarising and distinguishing the basic principles applicable to the ‘full ’ doctrine of <b>agency</b> <b>of</b> <b>necessity</b> and the ‘more limited ’ sub-doctrine relating to reimbursement of agent’s expense, this paper locates and analyses the current application of the doctrine’s criteria {{in the age of}} ubiquitous mobile phones, synchronous internet communications, email, and immediate money transfers. It concludes by suggesting that the development of the doctrine is inhibited less by improved communication systems and more by the strict and narrow test applied to identify the required ‘necessity’. 1...|$|E

40|$|It is {{increasingly}} common {{to claim that}} terrorism is different from other bad things, such as crime, because {{it is essential to}} prevent terrorism, rather than simply to hunt down and punish its perpetrators. For example, Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, maintains that ‘In many respects, counter-terrorism work is distinctive in nature and not like other areas of law enforcement. The work of our security and intelligence <b>agencies</b> is, <b>of</b> <b>necessity,</b> covert… [...] We depend on the police and Security Service to identify these individuals before their plans come to fruition, to stop an attack from happening. This contrasts with the majority of police investigations, which happen after the crime has taken place'. I think we should treat such claims about the exceptionalism of terrorism with care, not because terrorism isn't sui-generis in important ways, but because the ways in which it is exceptional are likely to depend on how one understands other bad things, such as war, crime or illness. Hence, the exceptional features of terrorism are likely to prove matters of degree, rather than kind. For all great evils, including [ [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|The {{number of}} privately managed Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) is small but increasing. Chumbe Island Coral Park (CHICOP), {{established}} in 1991 {{and possibly the}} first fully functioning MPA in Tanzania, provides an interesting illustration of issues that arise with the instalment of a privately created and managed protected area. Challenges caused by the legal and institutional environment for private investment in conservation resulted in much higher costs than originally anticipated. The history of CHICOP, management experiences, problems and achievements in the legal and institutional environment of Zanzibar, Tanzania are described and lessons learned are summarised. Management costs of the privately established and managed park are {{only a fraction of}} what is normally needed for donor-funded projects through government <b>agencies.</b> Out <b>of</b> <b>necessity,</b> income-generating activities are more developed and successful, thus creating much better prospects of sustainability. Risks for private investors remain high though due to the generally unfavourable investment climate, the volatile tourism market and the lack of long-term security of tenure. Because of these risks, and the more noticeable conservation impact on the ground, a case is made for more donor support to direct resource users from both the informal and formal private sectors, including to privately managed marine protected areas. ...|$|R
40|$|Mycobacterium tuberculosis, {{commonly}} referred to as TB, is responsible for causing about 630, 000 cases per year of infectious diseases worldwide. Recently, multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) has become an alarming public health concern. In addition, many developing countries lack effective treatment programs. India is one of those countries with a high prevalence of TB, seemingly affected by disconnectedness in their public health infrastructure. India, although a developing country, is still burdened with both chronic and infectious diseases, and there is a reactive public health system that must place focus on long-term effects of emerging resistant strains of TB. It is important to develop rapid drug susceptibility testing for quick diagnosis and treatment of monitored TB levels. According to a 2013 article published by Lancet, countries with well-run public health programs, supported by early diagnosis and access to quality drugs, have better treatment outcomes and compliance. Compliance must be maximized in developing countries to prevent the continuing emergence of MDR-TB. India’s public health infrastructure must be reshaped and empowered with implementation of treatment programs and surveillance frameworks similar to those seen in countries with low rates of MDR-TB levels. It is important that India strengthen their framework for combating MDR-TB, with emphasis on increasing health literacy among community leaders, informing government <b>agencies</b> <b>of</b> the <b>necessity</b> <b>of</b> research and surveillance, strengthening rapid TB diagnostic systems, and providing culturally-appropriate TB treatment programs. Using intervention strategies from other communities may help India develop an appropriate solution for decreasing the prevalence of MDR-TB. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Raymond Geuss {{asserts that}} there are {{fragmented}} views on what human rights are {{and that there is}} no unifying principle underlying such notion. I think that this view has its merits. It conveys the particularity of our perspectives, attitudes, desires and self-understandings. It rejects abstractness and is committed to a thick, perspectivist, historical understanding of personhood. To understand who we are, is to understand how we arrive at being who we are. By contrast, the notion of human rights deploys abstractness, unification <b>of</b> <b>agency,</b> <b>necessity</b> and a thin view of personhood. In this paper, I attempt to bring into focus these two aspects of the notion of human rights. I will first analyse the genealogical method advocated by Geuss and argue that it has the merit of elucidating our historical contingencies; however, it is argued that any view in favour of the genealogical method relies on the idea that evaluative or normative concepts cannot be defined in terms of a common denominator. We reconstruct the Aristotelian idea of 'focal meaning' as core-resemblance and show that there is a unifying concept of human rights. We conclude that the perspectivist spirit of genealogy is not far from the Aristotelian tradition. Aristotle's inquiry into a concept that could grasp different perspectives and contingencies as opposed to a Platonic understanding of abstract and universal forms shows that genealogical worries are germane to the traditio...|$|R
