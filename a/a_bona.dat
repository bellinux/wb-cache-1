5|$|Bona Allen saddles were {{available}} through the Sears mail order catalog, and many Hollywood actors used saddles made by the Bona Allen Company, including cowboy actors Gene Autry, the cast of Bonanza, and Roy Rogers, who used <b>a</b> <b>Bona</b> Allen saddle on his horse Trigger. A statue of Roy Rogers and <b>a</b> <b>Bona</b> Allen saddle-maker saddling Trigger is located in downtown Buford. The Bona Allen Company thrived during the Great Depression in the 1930s, likely {{as a result of}} the Depression forcing farmers to choose horses over expensive tractors, thereby increasing the demand for saddles, collars, bridles, and other leather products.|$|E
5|$|Alexander Karelin {{was awarded}} for his {{recognition}} {{as the greatest}} wrestler of all time (from antiquity to the present day). He was a Greco-Roman wrestler in the Olympics, and in his career he won 887 bouts and lost only 2 times. His losses are controversial because commentators believe they were caused by trivial rule changes, not <b>a</b> <b>bona</b> fide athletic defeat.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these physical advantages, the serum also greatly enhanced Norman's already-above average intellect, making him <b>a</b> <b>bona</b> fide genius capable of making breakthroughs in advanced areas of genetics, robotics, engineering, physics and applied chemistry. The Goblin formula is also said to have driven Osborn insane; defects in his personality were strongly augmented by the serum, resulting in dangerous mood-swings and hallucinations.|$|E

5|$|Congress is not {{prevented}} from legislating as to tribes generally; and {{this appears to}} be what it has done in successive versions of the Nonintercourse Act. There is nothing in the Act to suggest that ‘tribe’ is to be read to exclude <b>a</b> <b>bona</b> fide tribe not otherwise federally recognized. Nor, as the district court found, is there evidence of congressional intent or legislative history squaring with appellants' interpretation. Rather we find an inclusive reading consonant with the policy and purpose of the Act.|$|E
5|$|An {{undertaking}} of {{the restoration}} team was {{that everything would}} be handled in a transparent fashion, that reporters, art historians and others with <b>a</b> <b>bona</b> fide interest should have ready access to information and to view the work. However, a single company, Nippon Television Network Corporation, had sole photography rights. Michael Kimmelman, chief art critic of The New York Times, wrote, in 1991, that the criticism of {{the restoration of the}} ceiling and lunettes was in part fuelled by the Nippon Television Network's reluctance to make public those photographs that they had taken by exclusive right, which had recorded every stage of the process and which were the only solid evidence that the work was being done appropriately.|$|E
5|$|When the {{nominations}} were announced on January 25, {{the field of}} Best Picture nominees did not include <b>a</b> <b>bona</b> fide blockbuster at the U.S. box office. It {{was the first time}} since 1986 that none of the five films in that category were among the top ten releases in box office prior to {{the nominations}} announcement. Furthermore, before the ceremony, all five films sold the lowest cumulative number of tickets sold since 1984. Ray was the highest-grossing film among the Best Picture nominees with $73million in domestic box office receipts. The film was followed by The Aviator ($58.4million), Finding Neverland ($32.7million), Sideways ($32.4million), and finally Million Dollar Baby ($8.4million). The combined gross of the five Best Picture nominees when the Oscars were announced was $205million with an average gross of $41.3million per film.|$|E

25|$|While {{this may}} be true, trying to {{separate}} Haq's actions from {{the larger context of}} the war on terrorism is tunnel vision at its worst.

25|$|In response, Citizens United {{produced}} a documentary, called Celsius 41.11, {{highly critical of}} both FAHRENHEIT 9/11 and 2004 Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry. The FEC, however, held that showing the movie and advertisements for it would violate the Federal Election Campaign Act, because Citizens United was not <b>a</b> <b>bona</b> fide commercial film maker.|$|E
25|$|In {{the wake}} of these decisions, Citizens United sought to {{establish}} itself as <b>a</b> <b>bona</b> fide commercial film maker before the 2008 elections, producing several documentary films between 2005 and 2007. By early 2008, it sought to run television commercials to promote its political documentary Hillary: The Movie and to air the movie on DirecTV.|$|E

50|$|A {{generalization}} {{of the idea}} of geometric borders is the idea of fiat boundaries, by which is meant any sort of boundary which does not track <b>an</b> underlying <b>bona</b> fide physical discontinuity. Fiat boundaries are typically the product of human demarcation—for example in demarcating electoral districts or postal districts, but also in demarcating the regions of the brain.|$|R

The World Polo Championship is held every three years by the Federation of International Polo.|$|E
25|$|Floating charges {{take effect}} in equity only, and {{consequently}} are defeated by <b>a</b> <b>bona</b> fide {{purchaser for value}} without notice of any asset covered by them. In practice, as the chargor has power to dispose of assets subject to a floating charge, so this is only of consequence in relation to disposals that occur after the charge has crystallised.|$|E

25|$|The strong arm {{avoidance}} power {{stems from}} 11 U.S.C. § 544 and permits the trustee {{to exercise the}} rights that a debtor {{in the same situation}} would have under the relevant state law. Specifically, § 544(a) grants the trustee the rights of avoidance of (1) a judicial lien creditor, (2) an unsatisfied lien creditor, and (3) <b>a</b> <b>bona</b> fide purchaser of real property. In practice these avoidance powers often overlap with preference and fraudulent transfer avoidance powers.|$|E
25|$|Completed a {{day ahead}} of {{schedule}} and under budget, The Stranger was the only film made by Welles to have been <b>a</b> <b>bona</b> fide box office success upon its release.

Within weeks of {{the completion of the}} film, International Pictures backed out of its promised four-picture deal with Welles. No reason was given, but the impression was left that The Stranger would not make money.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to victims rights groups, TDCJ adopted a board rule in January 1996 allowing five victim witnesses (six for multiple victims).
