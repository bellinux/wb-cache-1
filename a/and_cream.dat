5|$|The {{player can}} select any two-member {{permutation}} of its five playable characters: Sonic the Hedgehog, Tails, Amy Rose, Knuckles the Echidna, <b>and</b> <b>Cream</b> the Rabbit, provided the two desired characters have been unlocked; only Sonic and Tails {{are available at}} the beginning, while the other three must be rescued from Eggman {{over the course of the}} game. Each character has a unique ability: Sonic can perform a spinning attack in mid-air, Tails can fly using his two tails as a propeller, Amy can smash enemies with her hammer, Knuckles can glide long distances and climb walls, <b>and</b> <b>Cream</b> can fly using her ears as wings and attack enemies with her Chao friend, Cheese. The second player character can also give powers to the first by pressing the R button; for example, pressing and holding R while Tails is the sidekick blasts both characters into the air. In addition, the second character will collect rings and destroy enemies the first has not. Outside the main game, there are two battle modes for two to four players, in which any of the characters can be selected: racing and Chao collecting.|$|E
5|$|The series {{moves to}} outer space for season three, when the animal {{characters}} {{return to their}} world. Early in the series she <b>and</b> <b>Cream</b> befriend a plant-like creature, Cosmo the Seedrian, and they are frequently together. Sonic is kidnapped by the Metarex, plant-based robots, and Amy destroys one to rescue Sonic from drowning again. She continues her adventures with the gang, looking for scattered Chaos Emeralds and defeating Metarex. In one episode Amy nearly wins Sonic's heart with an alien race's love magic, but Tails and Cosmo trigger the magic before Sonic arrives; while their existing affection for each other increases, Amy yells at them. During the show's climax, Amy jumps to save Sonic from the Metarex's watery planet. She is knocked unconscious by the impact, but Chris saves them both. Cosmo fuses with the planet, forcing Tails to destroy her to save the galaxy, and Amy, Cream and Tails sob in despair as the other characters solemnly watch. Amy <b>and</b> <b>Cream</b> later bring Tails some snacks to cheer him up.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of the}} {{development}} over the sub-surface platforms, the station buildings were remodelled internally to share a single entrance and ticket office. Space in the Piccadilly line building that was formerly used for operational purposes or as the exit to the street is now used for retail purposes.

5|$|Hygrophoropsis {{species have}} fruit bodies with concave caps that often have wavy margins and rolled-in edges. The {{texture of the}} cap surface ranges from {{somewhat}} tomentose to velvety. Typical fruit body colors are orange, brownish-yellow (fulvous) or paler, buff, <b>and</b> <b>cream.</b> The gills have a decurrent attachment to the stipe. They are narrow with blunt edges, often multiply forked, and readily detachable from the stipe. The flesh is soft and generally the same colour as the fruit body surface, or lighter. The taste and odour of the flesh is usually nondescript, or similar to cultivated mushrooms. In contrast, H.rufa can have a distinct ozone-like smell, reportedly reminiscent of the orchid Oncidium ornithorhynchum or a photocopier.|$|E

5|$|Hygrophorus bakerensis, {{commonly}} known as the Mt. Baker waxy cap, the brown almond waxy cap or the tawny almond waxy cap, is a species of fungus in the Hygrophoraceae family. It is characterized by its medium to large, relatively slender-statured fruit bodies with an almond odor, and growth often on or near rotting conifer wood. The slimy cap is brown in the center <b>and</b> <b>cream</b> to white near its curved edges. The gills and the stem are white, and in moist environments are often covered with droplets of a translucent liquid. The mushroom is known only from the United States, where it is common in coniferous forests throughout the Pacific Northwest. It was initially collected in Washington State on Mount Baker, a volcano. Although edible, the mushroom is not considered to be of high quality.|$|E

5|$|The multi-coloured {{platform}} tiles on the Northern line were reconstructed in the 1920s {{in conjunction}} with an extension to Morden station.

The original maroon <b>and</b> <b>cream</b> tiling on the Bakerloo line platforms has been covered over.

5|$|There are two {{accepted}} coat colours, red and blue, though chocolate <b>and</b> <b>cream</b> do occur. Blue dogs can be blue, blue mottled, or blue {{speckled with}} or without black, tan, or white markings. Red dogs are evenly speckled with solid red markings. Both red dogs and blue dogs are born white (except for any solid-coloured body or face markings) and the red or black hairs grow in as they mature. The distinctive adult colouration {{is the result of}} black or red hairs closely interspersed through a predominantly white coat. This is not merle colouration (a speckled effect that has associated health issues), but rather the result of the ticking gene. A number of breeds show ticking, which is the presence of colour through white areas, though the overall effect depends on other genes that will modify the size, shape and density of the ticking.|$|E
