Whenever the two teams play a weekend series, the Friday game is broadcast on MLB Network, the Saturday game is broadcast on either Fox or Fox Sports 1, while the Sunday game is broadcast on either TBS in the afternoon or ESPN as part of Sunday Night Baseball; the New England Sports Network in the Boston market and the YES Network in the New York City market <b>always</b> <b>carry</b> games not assigned on either FOX, FS1 (unless specified), or on ESPN's Sunday Night Baseball. Whenever they play games during the week, there are games broadcast on MLB Network, FS1, and ESPN.|$|E

25|$|Note: Gilbert {{supplied}} a topsy-turvy twist {{by writing}} Julia's dialogue in a German accent, since {{she is the}} only English character in Ernest's company; all of the Germans speak with an English accent. The first Julia, Ilka Pálmay, was Hungarian but performed mostly in German. Modern productions do not <b>always</b> <b>carry</b> out this idea. For instance, in the 1976 D'Oyly Carte recording (which did not include the dialogue), the singer playing Julia did not affect a German accent.|$|E

25|$|The {{accompanying}} marches <b>always</b> <b>carry</b> a flavour of {{the regiment}} whose colour is being trooped, lending the royal inspection a unique atmosphere. For example, if the Welsh Guards are trooping their colour, the music will include their traditional regimental march, Men of Harlech. While the Queen passes the six companies of foot guards on her left, a slow march or air is played. Once the phaeton turns around {{the rear of}} No. 6 Guard, the music changes to a quick march. The Queen is conveyed back up the line, passing the Household Cavalry and King's Troop stationed on her right, with the head coachman saluting the Sovereign's Standard of the Household Cavalry and the lead gun of the King's Troop in quick succession with a whip. The inspection completed, the music ceases, and she is conveyed back to the saluting base.|$|E
25|$|Every mRNA {{consists}} of three parts: a 5' untranslated region (5'UTR), a protein-coding region or open reading frame (ORF), and a 3' untranslated region (3'UTR). The coding region carries information for protein synthesis encoded by the genetic code to form triplets. Each triplet of nucleotides of the coding region is called a codon and corresponds to a binding site complementary to an anticodon triplet in transfer RNA. Transfer RNAs with the same anticodon sequence <b>always</b> <b>carry</b> an identical type of amino acid. Amino acids are then chained together by the ribosome according {{to the order of}} triplets in the coding region. The ribosome helps transfer RNA to bind to messenger RNA and takes the amino acid from each transfer RNA and makes a structure-less protein out of it. Each mRNA molecule is translated into many protein molecules, on average ~2800 in mammals.|$|E
500|$|The {{caissons}} or gondolas <b>always</b> <b>carry</b> {{a combined}} weight of [...] {{of water and}} boats, with the gondolas themselves each weighing [...] Care is taken to maintain the water levels on each side, thus balancing the weight on each arm. According to Archimedes' principle, floating objects displace their own weight in water, so when the boat enters, {{the amount of water}} leaving the caisson weighs exactly the same as the boat. This is achieved by maintaining the water levels on each side to within a difference of [...] using a site-wide computer control system comprising water level sensors, automated sluices and pumps. It takes [...] to power ten hydraulic motors, which consume [...] per half-turn, roughly the same as boiling eight kettles of water.|$|E

500|$|Historical {{accounts}} {{related to}} {{the early history of}} the Polish coronation sword are scant and often mixed with legend. The earliest known use of the name [...] "Szczerbiec" [...] appeared in the Chronicle of Greater Poland {{at the turn of the}} 14th century. According to this source, the sword was given to King Boleslaus the Brave (reigned 992–1025) by an angel; Polish kings were supposed to <b>always</b> <b>carry</b> it in battle to triumph over their enemies. During Boleslaus's invasion of Kievan Rus', he hit it against the Golden Gate of Kiev while capturing the city. It was the notch that appeared on the edge of the blade which gave the sword its name. This account, written three centuries after the events it describes, is implausible not only because of the customary reference to the sword's supernatural origin (compare Excalibur), but also because Boleslaus's intervention in the Kievan succession crisis took place in 1018, or about 19 years before the actual construction of the Golden Gate in 1037.|$|E
500|$|Monk's phobias {{and anxiety}} {{disorders}} make him depend on personal assistants, who drive him around, do his shopping, and <b>always</b> <b>carry</b> {{a supply of}} wipes for his use, as shown in episodes like [...] "Mr. Monk Meets the Playboy", [...] "Mr. Monk Goes to the Carnival", etc. They also {{take an active role}} in organizing his consultancy work, and sometimes investigate cases themselves. His first assistant, Sharona Fleming (Bitty Schram), is a single mother and practical nurse by profession, hired by the police department to help Monk recover from the three-year catatonic state he lapsed into after Trudy's death. After several years of loyal service, Sharona leaves the show in season 3 to return to New Jersey and remarry her ex-husband Trevor. After her abrupt departure, Monk has a chance meeting with Natalie Teeger (Traylor Howard), whom he hires as his new assistant starting in [...] "Mr. Monk and the Red Herring".|$|E
500|$|In {{a report}} dated 16 September 2010 the coroner ruled Kumaritashvili's death an {{accident}} {{brought on by}} a [...] "convergence of several factors", including the high speed of the track, its technical difficulty, and the athlete's relative unfamiliarity with the track. He wrote that during Kumaritashvili's training runs, it was {{reasonable to assume that}} [...] "Mr.Kumaritashvili was sliding faster than ever before in his life, and was attempting to go even faster, while simultaneously struggling to learn the intricacies of the track and the dynamics it created". The coroner accepted that luging would <b>always</b> <b>carry</b> an element of risk and that best practices known at the time had been followed {{in the construction of the}} Whistler track. He also called upon the International Luge Federation to require athletes to engage in more mandatory training sessions prior to the Olympic Games and other major competitions. Responding to the report, Kumaritashvili's father said: [...] "I don't accept the statement about Nodar's lack of experience. He wouldn't have won the right to take part in the Olympics if he lacked experience." ...|$|E

500|$|There was no duty {{to report}} a death to anyone in authority. Instead, each parish {{appointed}} two or more 'searchers of the dead', whose duty was to inspect a corpse and {{determine the cause of}} death. A searcher was entitled to charge a small fee from relatives for each death they reported, and so habitually the parish would appoint someone to the post who would otherwise be destitute and would be receiving support from the parish poor rate. Typically, this meant searchers would be old women who were illiterate, might know little about identifying diseases and who would be open to dishonesty. Searchers would typically learn about a death either from the local sexton who had been asked to dig a grave, or from the tolling of a church bell. Anyone who did not report a death to their local church, such as Quakers, Anabaptists, other non-Anglican Christians or Jews, frequently did not get included in the official records. Searchers during times of plague were required to live apart [...] from the community and stay indoors except when performing their duties, for fear of spreading the diseases. Outside they should avoid other people and <b>always</b> <b>carry</b> a white stick to warn of their occupation. Searchers reported to the Parish Clerk, who made a return each week to the Company of Parish Clerks in Brode Lane. Figures were then passed to the Lord Mayor and then to the Minister of State once plague became a matter of national concern. The reported figures were used to compile the Bills of Mortality, which listed total deaths in each parish and whether by plague. The system of Searchers to report the cause of death continued until 1836.|$|E

2500|$|French horns tend to <b>always</b> <b>carry</b> {{the rhythmic}} backup of a march.

In 6/8 marches, French horns play on beat 1, the 'li' of 1, beat 2, and the 'li' of 2 (1-la-li 2-la-li). In other words, the measure would be one eighth note, then an eighth rest, then two eighth notes, an eighth rest, then a final eighth note.|$|E
2500|$|Nathan Lee of The Village Voice {{said the}} film [...] "works despite feeling both over-familiar and over-ambitious.

[...] Writing for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis viewed director Boyle as a [...] "first-rate, seemingly sweat-free entertainer" [...] who always [...] "sells the goods smoothly, along with the chills, the laughs and, somewhat less often, the tears." [...] She went on to say, [...] "He's wickedly good at making you jump and squirm in your seat, which he does often in [...] "Sunshine," [...] but he tends to avoid tapping into deep wells of emotion." [...] Wesley Morris in The Boston Globe mused that if the film didn't [...] "float your boat as a work of science-fiction, action, philosophy, heliocentrism, or staggering visual spectacle (although, it really should), then it certainly succeeds as a parable for cinematic ambition." [...] He emphatically added, [...] "The surface of this movie is plenty enthralling on its own." [...] Desson Thomson of The Washington Post commented that for the film, [...] "The voyage works, beautifully.
