In September 1862, an experiment to specifically address Earth currents {{was carried out in}} the Munich Alps (Lamont, 1862). Including minor processes, there are at least thirty-two different mechanisms which cause <b>telluric</b> <b>currents.</b> The strongest are primarily geomagnetically induced currents, which are induced by changes in the outer part of the Earth's magnetic field, which are usually caused by interactions between the solar wind and the magnetosphere or solar radiation effects on the ionosphere. <b>Telluric</b> <b>currents</b> flow in the surface layers of the earth. The electric potential on the Earth's surface can be measured at different points, enabling the calculation of the magnitudes and directions of the <b>telluric</b> <b>currents</b> and hence the Earth's conductance.

30|$|Electromagnetic (EM) {{studies of}} the Earth aim to infer its {{electrical}} conductivity. In the 1930 s, Marcel and Conrad Schlumberger pioneered an EM field survey that relied on naturally occurring <b>telluric</b> <b>currents</b> {{rather than on the}} active injection of a direct current by a pair of electrodes (Schlumberger 1939). A <b>telluric</b> <b>current</b> is induced in the Earth by time-varying magnetic fields. These originate in the magnetosphere, ionosphere, and/or atmosphere with sources as far away as the Sun and as close as thunderstorms (Vozoff 1972). The first telluric surveys relied on the simultaneous measurement of one electric field component at a base and a field site. The difference in electric field strength at the base and field site could only qualitatively be interpreted, i.e., information on the relative conductivity difference between the base and field site was obtained.|$|R

Then a three-dimensional conductivity structure is modelled and the induced currents in different depths and the geoelectric field at the Earth’s surface are shown.

40|$|Summary. Evidence of a {{conductivity}} anomaly in the mine-Graben {{was first}} given about 1 5 {{years ago and}} consequently led t o the definition of various models of induction in the region for periods ranging from {{a few minutes to}} a few hours. These models reflect two antagonistic ways of explaining the observed anomalous variations of the magnetic field: direct induction in a two-dimensional (2 -D) structure or static distortion of <b>telluric</b> <b>currents</b> by the resistive crystalline Vosges (France) and Schwarzwalde (Germany) massifs. We discuss the two approaches using a simple formalism. In particular, we show that the self-induction related t o the anomalous currents flowing in the Rhine-Graben is negligible for periods larger than 1000 s, and that, even though the static distortion of <b>telluric</b> <b>currents</b> does account for the observed anomaly, 2 -D models can explain some of its features. We also show how the channelled currents are induced in the large sedimentary basins surrounding the area under study. An experimental verification of this result is given...|$|R
30|$|Many {{previous}} studies have reported magnetic field changes accompanying volcanic activity (e.g., Dzurisin et al. 1990; Sasai et al. 2002; Hurst et al. 2004).
