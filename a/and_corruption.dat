5|$|Bo's {{tenure in}} Chongqing was {{dominated}} by a protracted war against organized crime <b>and</b> <b>corruption</b> known as dahei ("striking the black"). Between 2009 and 2011, an estimated 5,700 people were arrested in the sweeping campaign that ensnared not only criminals, but also businessmen, members of the police force, judges, government officials, and political adversaries. The campaign was overseen by Chongqing police chief Wang Lijun, whom Bo had worked with previously in Liaoning.|$|E
5|$|During his presidency, Endara {{abolished}} the Panamanian military {{and replaced it}} with a national police force. Endara's term saw steady economic growth and a return of democratic institutions, but also high unemployment rates.

Unlike several other journalists during his time, Blancornelas was eager to write about drug trafficking <b>and</b> <b>corruption,</b> leading to his firing from three newspapers before deciding to create his own.|$|E

5|$|Another colony lost by Spain in 1898 was Cuba, but {{as freedom}} for Cuba {{had been a}} major purpose of the war, it was not annexed by the U.S., but was, {{after a period of}} occupation, given {{independence}} in 1902. Election fraud <b>and</b> <b>corruption</b> followed, as did factional conflict. In September 1906, President Tomás Estrada Palma asked for U.S. intervention. Taft traveled to Cuba with a small American force, and on September 29, 1906, {{under the terms of the}} Cuban–American Treaty of Relations of 1903, declared himself Provisional Governor of Cuba, a post he held for two weeks before being succeeded by Charles Edward Magoon. In his time in Cuba, Taft worked to persuade Cubans that the U.S. intended stability, not occupation.|$|E
5|$|At this juncture, the Roman empire was convulsed by {{its first}} major civil war since the Battle of Actium exactly a century earlier: the Year of the Four Emperors (69-70 AD). The {{governor}} of Germania Inferior, ordered {{to raise more}} troops, outraged the Batavi by attempting to conscript more Batavi than the maximum stipulated in their treaty. The brutality <b>and</b> <b>corruption</b> of the Roman recruiting-centurions (including incidents of sexual assault on Batavi young men) brought already deep discontent in the Batavi homeland to the boil.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the last}} decades of the Cold War, American and European critics of the UN {{condemned}} the organization for perceived mismanagement <b>and</b> <b>corruption.</b> In 1984, the US President, Ronald Reagan, withdrew his nation's funding from UNESCO (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, founded 1946) over allegations of mismanagement, followed by Britain and Singapore. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Secretary-General from 1992 to 1996, initiated a reform of the Secretariat, reducing {{the size of the}} organization somewhat. His successor, Kofi Annan (1997–2006), initiated further management reforms in the face of threats from the United States to withhold its UN dues.|$|E

5|$|China has had {{an organ}} {{transplantation}} programme since the 1960s. It {{is one of the}} largest organ transplant programmes in the world, peaking at over 13,000 transplants a year in 2004. Involuntary organ harvesting is illegal under Chinese law, although under a 1984 regulation it became legal to remove organs from executed criminals with the prior consent of the criminal or permission of relatives. By the 1990s, growing concerns about possible ethical abuses arising from coerced consent <b>and</b> <b>corruption</b> led medical groups and human rights organizations to start condemning the practice. These concerns resurfaced in 2001, when The Washington Post reported claims by a Chinese asylum-seeking doctor that he had taken part in organ extraction operations.|$|E

5|$|In 1961 Pracheachon's spokesperson, Non Suon, criticized Sihanouk {{for failing}} to tackle inflation, unemployment, <b>and</b> <b>corruption</b> in the country. Non Suon's criticisms gave Sihanouk the impetus to arrest Pracheachon leaders, and {{according}} to him, he had discovered plans by their party to monitor local political developments on behalf of foreign powers. In May 1962 Tou Samouth, Pracheachon's secretary-general, disappeared, and its ideological ally, the Communist Party of Kampuchea, suspected that Samouth had been secretly captured and killed by police. However, Sihanouk allowed Sangkum's left-wing politicians to run again in the 1962 general elections, which they all won. He even appointed two left-wing politicians, Hou Yuon and Khieu Samphan, as secretaries for planning and commerce, respectively, after the election.|$|E
