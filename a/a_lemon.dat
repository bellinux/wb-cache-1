5|$|Cointreau-brand triple sec {{is used in}} some versions, {{and it may be}} {{prepared}} using a simple syrup that has been infused with lemon juice. Some versions are prepared using sour mix, a cocktail mixer. A garnish of a sliced lemon wheel, wedge, zest, rind or <b>a</b> <b>lemon</b> twist is sometimes used. Lemon is also sometimes included within the drink, such as <b>a</b> <b>lemon</b> wheel. Additional ingredients may also be used in the drink's preparation, such as ginger syrup and lavender extract.|$|E
5|$|Jif is {{packaged}} in a squeezable container shaped like <b>a</b> <b>lemon,</b> and in bottles. Development {{of the plastic}} container began in the 1950s, {{and was one of}} the original blow moulded containers used for food applications. Jif brand lemon juice was established in 1956.|$|E
5|$|North American shipped {{spacecraft}} CM-012 to Kennedy Space Center on August 26, 1966 under a conditional Certificate of Flight Worthiness: 113 significant incomplete planned engineering changes had to {{be completed}} at KSC. But that was not all; an additional 623 engineering change orders were made and completed after delivery. Grissom became so frustrated with {{the inability of the}} training simulator engineers {{to keep up with the}} spacecraft changes, that he took <b>a</b> <b>lemon</b> from a tree by his house and hung it on the simulator.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a unified {{analysis for the}} onset of the 1998 financial crisis and the strong economic recovery afterward in Russia and other former Soviet Union countries. Before the crisis a banking failure arose owing to the coexistence of <b>a</b> <b>lemons</b> credit market and high government borrowing. In <b>a</b> <b>lemons</b> credit market low credit risk firms switched from bank to nonbank finance, including trade credits and barter trade, generating an externality on banks' interest rates. The collapse of the treasury bills market in the financial crisis triggered a change in banks' lending behavior, providing initial conditions for banking development...|$|R
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>lemon</b> drop is a {{cocktail}} with a lemony, {{sweet and sour}} flavor, whereby the sweet and sour ingredients serve to contrast and balance one another. It is a vodka-based cocktail that is prepared {{with the addition of}} lemon juice, triple sec and simple syrup. Plain or citrus-flavored vodka may be used in its preparation, such as citron vodka. Lemon-flavored vodka is also sometimes used. Lemon juice that has been freshly squeezed may be used, which can produce a superior drink compared to using commercially prepared lemon juice. Some versions are prepared using the juice from Meyer lemons.|$|E
5|$|Both brands are {{packaged}} {{and marketed}} in distinctive packaging. ReaLemon is packaged in plastic bottles {{that includes the}} shape and color of <b>a</b> <b>lemon</b> atop the bottle, and is packaged using a yellow-colored cap. ReaLime is packaged in the same bottle style that includes the shape and color of a lime atop the bottle, and is packaged with a green-colored cap. ReaLemon has also been packaged in the United States in smaller squeeze pack plastic containers that are shaped and colored {{as that of a}} whole lemon. ReaLemon is also packaged in single-serving packets.|$|E
5|$|Further {{measures}} included pouring {{boiling water}} over the grave or complete incineration of the body. In the Balkans, a vampire could also be killed by being shot or drowned, by repeating the funeral service, by sprinkling holy water on the body, or by exorcism. In Romania, garlic could {{be placed in the}} mouth, and as recently as the 19th century, the precaution of shooting a bullet through the coffin was taken. For resistant cases, the body was dismembered and the pieces burned, mixed with water, and administered to family members as a cure. In Saxon regions of Germany, <b>a</b> <b>lemon</b> was placed in the mouth of suspected vampires.|$|E
5|$|Variations of {{the drink}} include lemon drops {{prepared}} with blueberries and raspberries, which may use vodkas or other liquors flavored with these respective berries. These drinks {{may also be}} served or garnished with these berries, or with <b>lemon.</b> <b>A</b> blueberry <b>lemon</b> drop may be prepared with muddled blueberries, and <b>a</b> raspberry <b>lemon</b> drop may be prepared with puréed or crushed raspberries.|$|R

5|$|The Jif plastic {{containers}} were originally made from polythene, and {{were one of}} the original and first blow moulded containers used for food applications. The {{plastic containers}} served to replace glass bottles used to package lemon juice. The plastic container was the brainchild of Edward Hack, and the container's design was undertaken by Bill Pugh, the chief plastics designer at Cascelloid. In its development, Pugh carved a core made of wood, covered it with fresh lemon peel to give it a realistic texture, and then cast a plaster mould. This led to the realistic-looking container that significantly resembles <b>a</b> <b>lemon.</b>|$|E
5|$|The plastic lemon {{container}} {{and the idea}} of marketing lemon juice in this manner was also undertaken independently by Stanley Wagner, a businessperson in the frozen food industry, and also a former Royal Air Force fighter pilot. Wagner's plastic lemon was produced by Shipton, a plastics company. Wagner was with the company Coldcrops, Ltd., which produced Realemon. The Realemon trademark was developed and used for <b>a</b> <b>lemon</b> juice product based upon reconstitution in the 1940s. Realemon was later renamed to ReaLem by Coldcrops. Hax lemon juice was the first to be packaged and marketed in said lemon-shaped container, with Coldcrops following shortly thereafter with their own design. It is of intrigue to some that both Pugh and Wagner were both former Royal Air Force pilots.|$|E

25|$|Lind's {{work was}} slow to be noticed, partly because his Treatise was not {{published}} until six years after his study, and also because he recommended <b>a</b> <b>lemon</b> juice extract known as rob. Fresh fruit was very expensive to keep on board, whereas boiling it down to juice allowed easy storage but destroyed the vitamin (especially if boiled in copper kettles). Ship captains concluded wrongly that Lind's other suggestions were ineffective because those juices failed to prevent or cure scurvy.|$|E

Even though the Ice Palace was built for hockey and the Lightning were the only major tenant, Forbes called the team's deal with the arena <b>a</b> <b>lemon</b> since it would not result in much revenue for 30 years. It was also behind on paying state sales taxes and federal payroll taxes.|$|E
25|$|Trotsky {{wanted the}} Communist Party to {{complete}} an orthodox proletarian revolution and have clear class independence from the KMT. Stalin funded the KMT during the expedition. Stalin countered Trotskyist criticism by making a secret speech {{in which he said}} that Chiang's right-wing Kuomintang were the only ones capable of defeating the imperialists, that Chiang Kai-shek had funding from the rich merchants, and that his forces were to be utilized until squeezed for all usefulness like <b>a</b> <b>lemon</b> before being discarded. However, Chiang quickly reversed the tables in the Shanghai massacre of 12 April 1927 by massacring the Communist Party in Shanghai midway through the Northern Expedition.|$|E
