5|$|A {{crowd of}} several {{thousand}} gathered outside the courthouse while Lockett's trial was underway. A cameraman asked {{a large group of}} those gathered to shake their fists and yell so he could get a picture. The rest of the crowd mistakenly believed they were storming the courthouse <b>and</b> <b>rushed</b> forward. In the ensuing skirmish, one policeman was injured so badly that his arm later had to be amputated. The National Guard opened fire, killing six people and wounding approximately fifty. Some members of the mob looted nearby stores in search of weapons to retaliate, but reinforcements arrived from a nearby army post by mid-afternoon.

5|$|Aidoo was {{designated}} as the backup running back out of training camp in 2005, with the Tiger-Cats electing to keep only the trio of Troy Davis, Aidoo, and fullback Julian Radlein on the roster as running backs. In August, Aidoo briefly stepped in for Davis after the latter suffered an injured hamstring. Through the first 11 regular season games, Aidoo made two special teams tackles <b>and</b> <b>rushed</b> for 51 yards on six carries. This led The Hamilton Spectator to speculate he would be dropped from the active roster in favor of recently signed running back Jesse Lumsden. After Troy {{was traded to the}} Eskimos, this never came to pass, and Aidoo started as a fullback for the last few games of the season. The Tiger-Cats did not make the playoffs. Aidoo finished the season with five special teams tackles and 116 rushing yards from 18 carries.|$|E
5|$|As {{the battle}} progressed, {{more and more}} forces would become {{available}} to the Germans.
