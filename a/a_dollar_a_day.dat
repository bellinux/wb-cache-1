5|$|As a child, Murphy was a loner with {{mood swings}} and an {{explosive}} temper. He {{grew up in}} Texas, around Farmersville, Greenville, and Celeste, where he attended elementary school. His father drifted {{in and out of}} the family's life and eventually deserted them. Murphy dropped out of school in fifth grade and got a job picking cotton for <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> to help support his family; he also became skilled with a rifle, hunting small game to help feed them. After his mother died of endocarditis and pneumonia in 1941, he worked at a radio repair shop and at a combination general store, garage and gas station in Greenville. Hunt County authorities placed his three youngest siblings in Boles Children's Home, a Christian orphanage in Quinlan. After the war, he bought a house in Farmersville for his oldest sister Corinne and her husband Poland Burns. His other siblings briefly shared the home.|$|E
25|$|Regardless of ethnicity, most cowboys {{came from}} lower social classes and the pay was poor. The average cowboy earned {{approximately}} <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> plus food, and, when near the home ranch, {{a bed in}} the bunkhouse, usually a barracks-like building with a single open room.|$|E
500|$|In 1972, Greyhound {{introduced}} the special unlimited mileage [...] "Ameripass." [...] The pass was initially marketed as offering [...] "99 days for $99" [...] (equal to $ today) or, in other words, transportation to anywhere at any time, for <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> For decades {{it was a}} popular choice for tourists on a budget who wanted to wander across the cities and towns of America. Over time Greyhound raised {{the price of the}} pass, shortened its validity period and rebranded it as the Discovery Pass, before finally discontinuing it in 2012.|$|E
50|$|Location Managers are {{commonly}} associated with production as {{being part of the}} management of a show and as such, are generally paid a weekly salary as opposed to an hourly wage. The average salary can vary depending on the experience of the individual and can range from <b>a</b> couple hundred <b>dollars</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> on low-budget films to almost <b>a</b> thousand <b>dollars</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> on commercials.|$|R

500|$|As a teenager, Stengel {{played on}} a number of semipro {{baseball}} teams. He played on the traveling team called the Kansas City Red Sox during the summers of 1908 and 1909, going as far west as Wyoming and earning <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> He was offered a contract by the minor league Kansas City Blues for $135 a month, more money than his father was making. Since young Stengel was underage, his father had to agree, which he did. Louis Stengel recalled, [...] "So I put down my paper and signed. You could never change that boy's mind anyway." ...|$|E
500|$|The Haitians at gravest risk {{of victimization}} by human traffickers are its poorest people, {{particularly}} children. In Haiti, the poorest {{country in the}} western hemisphere, over half the population lives on less than <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> and over three quarters live on less than two dollars a day. [...] Severe poverty, compiled {{with a lack of}} social services such as education and basic healthcare increases a child’s vulnerability to modern slavery. [...] Factors that increase a child's likelihood of becoming a restavek include illness or loss of one or both parents, lack of access to clean water, lack of educational opportunities, and having access to family in a city. [...] In addition to poverty, individual factors that can lead to exploitation include unemployment, illiteracy, poor educational opportunities, a history of physical or sexual abuse, homelessness, and drug abuse. These individual factors “push” people towards pathways of human trafficking and modern day slavery. Oftentimes men, women and children accept slave-like work conditions because there is little hope for better and they need to survive. Some cross national borders in search of positive opportunities, but instead find themselves a part of the exploited work force. [...] Additionally, factors that make people easy targets for traffickers make enslavement more likely. [...] One group at high risk for sexual enslavement and other types of forced labor is internally displaced persons, particularly women and children living in refugee camps, [...] which offer little security. [...] The estimated 10% of undocumented Haitians, whose births go unreported, are at especial risk of enslavement.|$|E
2500|$|According to Sarafian, it was Zanuck {{who came}} up with the idea of using the new 1970 Dodge Challenger R/T. He wanted to do Chrysler a favor for their long-time {{practice}} of providing 20th Century Fox with cars on a rental basis for only <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> Many of the other cars featured in the film are also Chrysler products. Stunt Coordinator Carey Loftin said he requested the Dodge Challenger because of the [...] "quality of the torsion bar suspension and for its horsepower" [...] and felt that it was [...] "a real sturdy, good running car." ...|$|E
5000|$|In the mid-1920s, {{the high}} school {{district}} stretched all the way south to El Segundo, so two women {{teachers were asked to}} live in El Segundo and ride the school buses with the students every day to and from that city - for <b>an</b> extra <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> in pay. In 1923 girls adopted a school uniform, [...] "a dark blue skirt with a white middy." ...|$|R

25|$|The gold <b>dollar</b> (1849–89) was <b>a</b> tiny coin {{measuring}} only 13mm {{making it}} difficult to grasp and easy to lose, a serious problem when <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> was almost <b>a</b> <b>day's</b> wage.|$|R
2500|$|In 2007 Alexander Cockburn {{was being}} interviewed by C-SPAN when a caller leveled the {{accusation}} that [...] "Anti-Semitism is {{thought of as}} a right-wing phenomenon traditionally, however, you left-wingers using Israel's struggle for survival, as an excuse, are the anti-Semites of {{the last quarter of the}} 20th Century and you're on your way in the 21st Century." [...] Cockburn responded [...] "I think Israel is secure. I don't think it's struggling for survival... It's protected by the United States. I don't see any threat to Israel's survival, it's ludicrous to say so. I do see a threat to [...] survival of Palestinians, who are living on what <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> in Gaza." ...|$|E
2500|$|Taken into custody, Powell was {{discovered}} {{to have a}} box of pistol cartridges, a compass, hair pomade, a brush and comb, two fine handkerchiefs, {{and a copy of}} his oath of allegiance (signed [...] "L. Paine") in his pockets. These were not the possessions of a menial laborer. Although he claimed he was a poor man who barely earned <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> for ditch-digging, Powell's wallet contained $25. About 3:00a.m. on April 18, William Bell identified Powell as the man who assaulted Seward. Powell was formally arrested, and imprisoned aboard the monitor USS Saugus, then at anchor in the Anacostia River at the Washington Navy Yard. A second identification was made around mid-morning on April 18 when Augustus Seward visited the Saugus and positively identified Powell as the man who attacked him and his father.|$|E
2500|$|Atlantic rests under [...] {{of water}} near Long Point. That fall, diver John Green {{was hired by}} American Express to dive the wreck and {{retrieve}} Atlantic safe and money known {{to be in a}} cabin, but his attempts failed. In 1855, Green returned with the schooner Yorktown, located the safe, and moved it out to the deck of Atlantic. But Green contracted a near-fatal case of the bends and was taken to a hospital; he was in recovery until the summer of 1856. When he returned to the wreck on 1 July he found the safe and money were gone. Another diver, Eliot Harrington, had found them both and hauled them to the surface. $36,700 was taken from Atlantic safe, at a time when a decent wage was <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> American Express went to court for the money; the ending settlement gave Harrington and the four others who worked with him a bit under $2000 each, with American Express taking the rest.|$|E

2500|$|International film actress Natalie Portman joined FINCA as its [...] "Ambassador of Hope" [...] in 2003, {{following}} {{a meeting with}} Queen Rania. About the meeting, she explains, [...] "Because I'm Israeli and Queen Rania {{is probably the most}} high-profile Palestinian woman in the world, I had this dream of meeting with her and doing something that would promote peace and working together between Israeli and Palestinian women. She talked to me a lot about what she calls the 'hope gap' that exists between the one third of the world that has and the two thirds that do not. I wasn't even aware that two thirds of the world population are extremely poor, living on less than <b>a</b> <b>dollar</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> and that 70 percent of those people are women and children. It's not something they teach you in school in the States". Since then, Portman has visited FINCA field projects in Mexico, Guatemala, Uganda, and Ecuador, and met with several members of Congress to argue for more government funding for microfinance ventures.|$|E

He had inherited economic problems from Perón's 1946-55 administration, characterized by budget deficits because of huge railroad subsidies during this period.
