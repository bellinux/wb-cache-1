5|$|The 1290 {{statute of}} Quo warranto {{was only one}} part of a wider {{legislative}} effort, {{which was one of the}} most important contributions of EdwardI's reign. This era of legislative action had started already at the time of the baronial reform movement; the Statute of Marlborough (1267) contained elements both of the Provisions of Oxford and the Dictum of Kenilworth. The compilation of the Hundred Rolls was followed shortly after by the issue of Westminster I (1275), which asserted the royal prerogative and outlined restrictions on liberties. In the Mortmain (1279), the issue was grants of land to the church. The first clause of WestminsterII (1285), known as De donis conditionalibus, dealt with family settlement of land, and entails. Merchants (1285) established firm rules for the recovery of debts, while Winchester (1285) dealt with peacekeeping on a local level. Quia emptores (1290)issued along with Quo warrantoset out to remedy land ownership disputes resulting from <b>alienation</b> of land <b>by</b> <b>subinfeudation.</b> The age of the great statutes largely ended with the death of Robert Burnell in 1292.|$|R
50|$|In {{property}} law, alienation is {{the capacity}} {{for a piece of}} property or a property right to be sold or otherwise transferred from one party to another. Although property is generally deemed to be alienable, it may be subject to restraints on alienation. In England under the feudal system, land was generally transferred <b>by</b> <b>subinfeudation</b> and <b>alienation</b> required licence from the overlord.|$|R
50|$|Quia Emptores is {{a statute}} {{passed in the}} reign of Edward I of England in 1290 that {{prevented}} tenants from alienating their lands to others <b>by</b> <b>subinfeudation,</b> instead requiring all tenants who wished to alienate their land {{to do so by}} substitution. The statute, along with its companion statute of Quo Warranto, was intended to remedy land ownership disputes and consequent financial difficulties that had resulted from the decline of the traditional feudal system during the High Middle Ages.|$|R
50|$|Nothing in the {{statutes}} addressed the King's rights, and tenants {{in chief of}} the crown continued to need royal licence to alienate their estates.

They are regarded as incorporeal hereditaments, and are either appendant or in gross. A seignory appendant passes with the grant of the manor; a seignory in gross—that is, a seignory which has been severed from the demesne lands of the manor to which it was originally appendant—must be specially conveyed by deed of grant.|$|R

It is at this point that one can consider that it becomes a district in its own right. For under the feudal system, lands could be divided up according to use, ownership, possession (right to take profit), and occupancy. The prioress received what amounted to both [...] "constructive possession" [...] and ‘ownership.’ Although the King did this to make raising tax easier, it had the benefit of preventing alienation of any parts of the property <b>by</b> <b>subinfeudation,</b> thus keeping it more or less intact over the coming centuries.|$|R

5000|$|The most {{important}} {{difference between the}} military and socage tenures was the mode of descent. Whether or not a feudal benefice was originally hereditary, it had certainly become so {{at the time of the}} Conquest, and it descended to the eldest son. This applied at once in England to land held by knight-service as far as regarded the capital fief. The descent of socage lands or lands other than the capital fief for some time followed the old pre-Conquest rule of descent. Thus in the so-called [...] "Laws of Henry I" [...] The lands other than the capital fief and some socage lands were divided among all the sons equally. But by the time of Henry de Bracton the course of descent of lands held by knight-service had so far prevailed that, though it was a question of fact whether the land was partible or not, if there was no evidence either way descent to the eldest son was presumed. Relics of the old custom still remain in the case of gavelkind. The military tenant was subject to the feudal incidents, from which the tenant in socage was exempt. These additional fees and obligations were often oppressive. <b>Alienation</b> of lands <b>by</b> will, except in a few favoured districts, became impossible; alienation inter vivos was restrained in one direction in the interests of the heir, in another in the interests of the lord. At the time of Glanvill a tenant had a greater power of alienation over land which he had purchased than over land which he had inherited. But by the time of Bracton the heir had ceased to have any interest in either kind of land. The lords were more successful. It was enacted by Magna Carta that a free man should not give or sell so much of his land as to leave an amount insufficient to perform his services to his lord. In spite of this provision, the rights of the lords were continually diminished <b>by</b> <b>subinfeudation</b> until the passing of the Statute of Quia Emptores. <b>Alienation</b> <b>by</b> a tenant-in-chief of the crown without licence was a ground of forfeiture until 1327, when a fine was substituted.|$|R

50|$|The {{reign of}} Edward I is notable for three leading statutes, all {{passed in the}} {{interests}} of the superior lords. The 1279 the Statute of Mortmain was the first of a long series directed against the acquisition of land by religious and charitable corporations. In 1285 the statute De Donis Conditionalibus forbade the alienation of estates granted to a man and the heirs of his body, which before the statute usually became on the birth of an heir at once alienable, and so the lord lost his escheat. The statute Quia Emptores preserved those rights of the lords which were up to that time subject to be defeated <b>by</b> <b>subinfeudation,</b> <b>by</b> enacting that in any alienation of lands the alienee should hold them of the same lord of the fee as the alienor. Since 1290 it has been impossible to create an estate in fee-simple to be held of a mesne lord, or to reserve a rent upon a grant of an estate in fee (unless in the form of a rent-charge), or to create a new manor. The statute, however, does not bind the crown. The practical effect of the statute was to make the transfer of land thenceforward more of a commercial and less of a feudal transaction. The writ of elegit was introduced by the Statute of Westminster II in 1285 as a creditor's remedy over real estate. It has, however, been considerably modified by subsequent legislation.|$|R

40|$|In Of Love and Other Demons, Gabriel Garcia Marquez tells a {{story that}} depicts the problem of alienation. It {{is a story about}} human beings' {{relationship}} with his or her fellowbeings; the need of an individual to be related with others. This study attempts to analyse the problem of alienation which is portrayed through the heroine's life. The writer is eager to analyse the causes as well as the process of Sierva Maria's alienation and how alienation influences her life. The study includes the <b>alienation</b> encountered <b>by</b> Sierva Maria, the causes, and the influences upon her physical and psychological conditions. The writer divides the problems experienced by the heroine into two: the <b>alienation</b> encountered <b>by</b> the heroine in her parents' mansion and the <b>alienation</b> encountered <b>by</b> the heroine in the convent of Santa Clara. In order to understand more about the heroine's alienation, the writer applies literary approach, psychological theory about alienation, and additional psychological theories related to the problem. Having analysed the problem of Sierva Maria's alienation, the writer finds out that the heroine's <b>alienation</b> is caused <b>by</b> outside and inside forces which result eventually in rejecting herself. The writer learns that in the first alienation which takes place in her parents' mansion, Sierva Maria's <b>alienation</b> is caused <b>by</b> her parents' inharmonious relationship and an inside force that is her odd behavior. Furthermore, the Catholic belief that rabies in human beings is equal to demonic possession, and the prejudices against Sierva Maria can be considered as the outside forces that bring her to the second alienation in the convent of Santa Clara. From the analysis the writer also proves that the <b>alienation</b> encountered <b>by</b> Sierva Maria has great influences on her physical and psychological conditions. In the end, the writer concludes that the girl is the victim of her parents and the society that holds certain belief and mores. The <b>alienation</b> encountered <b>by</b> Sierva Maria indeed have destructive influences upon her. Finally, due to the alienation, the girl experiences the most severe form of self alienation. She turns out to be an alienated figure who eventually rejects herself...|$|R
