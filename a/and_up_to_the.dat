This remained the main coaching route until about 1800, when an alternative route via Winchester (now mostly the A31 and former A33) was formed. During this time, <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 19th century, the area was sometimes known as Morestead Down after the nearby village of Morestead.|$|E

5|$|When Mardonius {{learned of}} the Spartan force, he {{completed}} the destruction of Athens, tearing down whatever was left standing. He then retreated towards Thebes, hoping to lure the Greek army into territory that would be suitable for the Persian cavalry.

5|$|After Winterbourne Stoke {{the route}} once again becomes dual {{carriageway}} from Yarnbury Castle {{and across the}} Wylye valley, meeting the A36 at Deptford.

On reaching the valley, it reverts again to single carriageway and through the village of Chicklade, before following the terrain over to Mere, where it runs north of the town as another dual carriageway bypass. Continuing west, it passes south of Wincanton and then north of Sparkford to a roundabout where the road reverts once more to single carriageway.|$|E
5|$|At 18:00 Egyptian {{armor and}} {{anti-tank}} units {{on the west}} bank began moving to the crossing sites. Fifteen minutes later engineers completed the assembly of all 35 ferries and waited for the breaches to be opened. By 18:30 the bridgeheads were nearly five kilometers (3mi) deep. With Israeli artillery on the Bar Lev Line eliminated, the immobile SA-2 and SA-3 units were moved forward. From 22:30 to 01:30 after midnight, all bridges—eight heavy and four light—were laid, and along with the ferries, began transporting reinforcements to the opposite bank. In the far south of the canal, at 19th Division's sector, the sand turned into mud making it difficult to clear. Consequently, four ferries and three bridges assigned to that division were deployed seven hours behind schedule. Periodically the bridges were relocated to confuse Israeli air strikes targeting them—the Egyptians had opened 60 passages but were operating only 12 bridges, allowing each bridge to be moved to one of five passages. Throughout the night <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> following morning, tanks and vehicles kept crossing the canal. Military police were responsible for directing this enormous traffic, utilizing color-coded signs.|$|E

5|$|Grenada's debut {{was at the}} 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, {{where it}} entered six athletes (five men and one woman) across two sports; since its 1984 Los Angeles Olympics {{appearance}} <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 2008 Beijing appearance, Grenada sent athletes to seven consecutive Olympic games. Its appearance in Beijing marked its largest appearance yet, with nine Olympic participants; additionally, more women participated in the Beijing Olympics on behalf of Grenada than any previous year, with five female athletes. This accounts for slightly {{less than half of}} all women who have participated in the Olympics between the 2008 Games and the Grenadan debut. Although the majority of athletes competing on Grenada's behalf participated in track and field (athletics) events, Rolande Moses participated as a boxer in the welterweight category. Although Neisha Bernard-Thomas and Allison George progressed to the semifinals in their respective events, further than the seven other athletes, no Grenadans medaled during the 2008 Summer Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} dung beetle, {{especially}} the sacred scarab, Scarabaeus sacer, were revered in Ancient Egypt. The hieroglyphic {{image of the}} beetle may have had existential, fictional, or ontologic significance. Images of the scarab in bone, ivory, stone, Egyptian faience, and precious metals are known from the Sixth Dynasty <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> period of Roman rule. The scarab was of prime significance in the funerary cult of ancient Egypt. The scarab was linked to Khepri, {{the god of the}} rising sun, from the supposed resemblance of the rolling of the dung ball by the beetle to the rolling of the sun by the god. Some of ancient Egypt's neighbors adopted the scarab motif for seals of varying types. The best-known of these are the Judean LMLK seals, where eight of 21 designs contained scarab beetles, which were used exclusively to stamp impressions on storage jars during the reign of Hezekiah. Beetles are mentioned {{as a symbol of the}} sun, as in ancient Egypt, in Plutarch's 1st century Moralia. The Greek Magical Papyri of the 2nd century BC to the 5th century AD describe scarabs as an ingredient in a spell.|$|E
5|$|The largest Chadian {{delegation}} {{to reach the}} Olympics appeared in the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea and at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain; each time, Chad's National Olympic Committee sent six athletes. During the 1992 games, the NOC sent the nation's first female Olympian. Since then (<b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Beijing games), at least one woman {{has been a part}} of the Chadian delegation. The smallest contingency of Chadian Olympians occurred during the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, when only Kaltouma Nadjina competed on the country's behalf. The delegation that arrived in Beijing consisted of two athletes—one man (30-year-old Moumi Sébergué) and one woman (15-year-old Hinikissia Albertine Ndikert), both participants in track events. Ndikert was Chad's flagbearer at the ceremonies. Up to and including the Beijing games, there has yet to have been a medalist from Chad.|$|E
