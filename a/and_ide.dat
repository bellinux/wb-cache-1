25|$|Many Norwegian {{words of}} French origin retain an acute accent, such as allé, kafé, idé, komité. Popular usage can be sketchy and often neglects the accent, or {{results in the}} grave accent erroneously being used in its place. Likewise, in Swedish, the acute accent is used only for the letter e, mostly in words of French origin and in some names. It is used both to {{indicate}} a change in vowel quantity as well as quality and that the stress should be on this, normally unstressed, syllable. Examples include café ("café") and resumé ("résumé", noun). There are two pairs of homographs that are differentiated only by the accent: armé ("army") versus arme ("poor; pitiful", masculine gender) <b>and</b> <b>idé</b> ("idea") versus ide ("winter quarters").|$|E

Sometime later, he almost killed Rena and her agent until Shinjiro reappeared and killed him through the removal of his Limiter. Although having saved the day, this event left him traumatized, due to Adacic being his first kill, as well as Edo <b>and</b> <b>Ide</b> discovered that there are more perpetrators behind the death of civilians with strange barcodes. Also before his death, Adacic realised that the third party that allow him to slip into Earth was manipulating him all along just to fight Shinjiro in his Ultraman Suit.|$|E
