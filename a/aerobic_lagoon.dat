30|$|Synthetic dyes can be {{considered}} emerging contaminants because they are potentially toxic and {{have been found in}} the aquatic environment and there are no regulations stating the maximum allowable concentrations in water to ensure the protection of aquatic biota and human health. The world production of key dyes is estimated to be more than 10 tons per year [1]. The most widely used dyes belong to the class of azo compounds derived from certain aromatic amines and are used in products such as textiles, foodstuffs, cosmetics, house products, paints, and inks. This is significant because some of these dyes are known to have potential toxic and genotoxic properties [2],[3]. The use of azo dyes to the color of textiles is of considerable interest, as this can raise environmental concerns because of the high volume of water involved in the dyeing process. When a dye is used in this process, a portion does not undergo bonding to the fibers thus remaining in the water bath [4]. As a consequence, high volumes of wastewaters containing dyes and related auxiliaries are produced and may be released into the environment. For instance, for 10 kg of polyester fabric, 100 g of disperse red 1 will be dissolved in 200 L of water, of which are round 1 % of the dye will remain in the water bath {{at the end of the}} process. Hence, around 200 L of wastewater containing 1 g of the dye will be generated. It is also known that conventional treatments involving <b>aerobic</b> <b>lagoons</b> or activated sludge are not efficient in the removal or biological degradation of these dyes [5] and therefore, the dyes are still present in the final effluent or in the sludge of the treatment plant [6],[7]. Disperse dyes used to dye synthetic fibers are generally sparingly water-soluble compounds, but they can be found in the water column, because of their commercial formulation that includes surfactants needed for the dyeing process. Some disperse dyes have been found in the aquatic environment [8], and their presence was related to the observed mutagenic activity of the water and sediments [6],[7],[9].|$|R

50|$|The lagoon {{is divided}} into two {{distinct}} layers: sludge and liquid. The sludge layer is a more solid layer formed by the stratification of sediments from the manure. After a while, this solid layer accumulates and eventually needs to be cleaned out. The liquid level is composed of grease, scum and other particulates. The liquid level CAFO wastewater enters {{at the bottom of the}} lagoon so that it can mix with the active microbial mass in the sludge layer. These anaerobic conditions are uniform throughout the lagoon, except in a small surface level. Sometimes aeration is applied to this level to dampen the odors emitted by the lagoons. If surface aeration is not applied, a crust will form that will trap heat and odors. Anaerobic lagoons should retain and treat wastewater from 20 to 150 days. Lagoons should be followed by <b>aerobic</b> or facultative <b>lagoons</b> to provide further required treatment. The liquid layer is periodically drained and used for fertilizer. In some instances, a cover can be provided to trap methane, which is used for energy. Anaerobic Lagoons work through a process called anaerobic digestion. Decomposition of the organic matter begins shortly after the animals void. Lagoons become anaerobic due to the high biological oxygen demand (BOD) of the feces, which contains a high level of soluble solids, resulting in higher BOD. Anaerobic microorganisms convert organic compounds into carbon dioxide and methane through acid formation and methane production.|$|R
40|$|A strong inverse {{correlation}} between temperature and organic load {{is present in}} the Petrie Mill main <b>aerobic</b> treatment <b>lagoon</b> which treats paper machine effluent. Lower temperatures experienced in winter months correspond to an increase in COD results at the pond outlet. This research and investigation was aimed at improving effluent treatment during cooler temperatures, by determining the extent of the impact of temperature in the treatment of effluent, as well as the influence of other factors such as oxygen or nutrient demand. Investigations and laboratory trials concluded that temperature did not directly impact the ability of the bacteria to consume the organic load. Ingestion of organics into the lagoon bacteria population occurred at the same rate across the temperature range tested. However, the dynamics of load reduction differed in a warmer versus a cooler environment. During lower temperatures, the catabolic requirements of bacteria are reduced, and the synthesis component of bacterial metabolism becomes an essential aspect of achieving the desired load reduction. The organic load was able to be effectively reduced at low temperatures, provided conditions were adequate for bacterial synthesis to occur. Temperature did not appear to affect bacterial synthesis. The impact extent of lower temperature appeared to be a reduced ability of excreted enzymes in biodegrading complex organic material. The major factors influencing organic load removal at lower temperatures were found to be those inhibiting bacterial synthesis, which were dissolved oxygen and nutrient availability. In the absence of adequate oxygen or nutrient supply, synthesis occurred at a lower rate or did not occur at all, leading to the poor treatment of effluent load at the low temperature. The investigation also included that the lagoon sludge bed had an impact on treatment during winter. Nutrients are absorbed by the sludge bed in cooler temperatures, contributing to possible nutrient deficiencies in winter. This would lead to reduced treatment efficiencies. Load variation also impacted on treatment performance, again due to higher organic loads without a corresponding increase in nutrient or oxygen availability for satisfactory bacterial synthesis. Toxicity had an inhibitory effect on bacteria functions. A number of immediate changes and have been made {{as a result of this}} investigation. Changes were based primarily on improving dissolved oxygen and nutrient availability, including redistribution of aerators and increasing nutrient dose rates. As a result the COD load at the lagoon outlet was reduced by approximately 20 % and the system appears to be in a stable and robust condition entering the current winter period. It is anticipated that the implementation of recommendations for future improvement will further improve performance and robustness of the treatment system...|$|R
40|$|In {{the process}} of Savannah River Site (SRS) {{operations}} limited amounts of waste are generated containing petroleum, and radiological contaminated soils. Currently, this combination of radiological and petroleum contaminated waste {{does not have an}} immediate disposal route and is being stored in low activity vaults. SRS developed and implemented a successful plan for clean up of the petroleum portion of the soils in situ using simple, inexpensive, bioreactor technology. Treatment in a bioreactor removes the petroleum contamination from the soil without spreading radiological contamination to the environment. This bioreactor uses the bioventing process and bioaugmentation or the addition of the select hydrocarbon degrading bacteria. Oxygen is usually the initial rate-limiting factor in the biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons. Using the bioventing process allowed control of the supply of nutrients and moisture based on petroleum contamination concentrations and soil type. The results of this work have proven to be a safe and cost-effective means of cleaning up low level radiological and petroleum-contaminated soil. Many of the other elements of the bioreactor design were developed or enhanced during the demonstration of a ''biopile'' to treat the soils beneath a Polish oil refinery's waste disposal <b>lagoons.</b> <b>Aerobic</b> microorganisms were isolated from the aged refinery's acidic sludge contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Twelve hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria were isolated from the sludge. The predominant PAH degraders were tentatively identified as Achromobacter, Pseudomonas Burkholderia, and Sphingomonas spp. Several Ralstonia spp were also isolated that produce biosurfactants. Biosurfactants can enhance bioremediation by increasing the bioavailability of hydrophobic contaminants including hydrocarbons. The results indicated that the diversity of acid-tolerant PAH-degrading microorganisms in acidic oil wastes may be much greater than previously demonstrated and they have numerous applications to environmental restoration. Twelve of the isolates were subsequently added to the bioreactor to enhance bioremediation.

40|$|Homeowners {{in areas}} not served by {{municipal}} sewage treatment systems face {{a problem of}} providing safe and effective wastewater treatment systems for their homes. There are several methods currently available for proper treatment of home sewage, including septic tank absorption fields, mounds, <b>lagoons,</b> <b>aerobic</b> treatment units and others. These systems and their advantages and disadvantages are discussed in this NebGuide. Treatment and disposal of domestic sewage is of concern because {{of the variety of}} pathogenic organisms contained in sewage. These include bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms that come from the digestive tract, respiratory tract, and skin of man. Some of the illnesses caused by these include dysentery, infectious hepatitis and typhoid. It is important to keep these disease-causing organisms from entering underground water supplies or surface waters through improperly designed or installed sewage treatment systems. Septic Tank-Absorption Field System Conventionally, the septic tank-absorption field system has proven satisfactory for many areas when properly designed, installed, and maintained. However, conditions do exist where this system is not suitable. Areas of seasonal high groundwater tables, bedrock in close proximity to the soil surface, or soils having very fast or very slow percolation rates are not suited for the septic tank-absorption field system. Other limitations for this system include topography, small lot size and proximity to water supplies used for drinking or recreation. The typical septic tank-absorption field home sewage treatment system consists of two major components- the septic tank and the absorption field (Figure 1). In the septic tank, solids are separated from the liquid, undergo anaerobic digestion and are stored as sludge {{at the bottom of the}} tank. The liquid (septic tank effluent) flows to the absorption field where it percolates into the soil. The soil acts as a final treatment by removing bacteria, pathogens, fine particles, and some chemicals. Figure 1. Typical septic tank-absorption field home sewage treatment system. The minimum septic tank liquid capacity for any location is I, 000 gallons (3, 800 1). For houses having more than three bedrooms, an additional 250 gallons (950 I) of tank capacity is added per bedroom. Septic tanks must be water tight and constructed from durable materials that resist excessive corrosion, frost damage and cracking or buckling due to settlement or backfilling. Common construction materials include concrete, fiberglass and bitumastic coated steel. Location of the septic tank is usually determined by the placement of the home plumbing and the topography of the land. Septic tanks should be located at least 15 feet (4. 5 m) from foundation walls and at least 50 feet (15 m) from private water supplies or surface waters. The location should be accessible for cleaning but should not be located beneath sidewalks, patios or driveways. Also, consider possible expansion of the house when selecting a site for septic tank placement...|$|R
40|$|Quality {{of life on}} Earth in {{the future}} will largely depend on the amount of safe water. As the most {{fundamental}} source of life, water is relentlessly consumed and polluted. To halt this trend, many countries are taking extensive measures and investing substantial resources in order to stop the contamination of water and return at least tolerably good water quality to nature. The goal of water purification is to obtain clean water with the sewage sludge as a by-product. Clean water is returned to nature, and further treatment of sludge may be subject to other procedures. The conclusion of this paper is simple. The procedure with purified water is easily achievable, purified water is discharged into rivers, lakes and seas, but the problem of further treatment of sludge remains. This paper presents the basic methods of wastewater treatment and procedures for processing the products from contaminated water. The paper can serve as a basis for further elaboration. Water Pollution In order to ensure normal life of living creatures, the water in which they live or the water they use must have a natural chemical composition and natural features. When, as a result of human activities, the chemical composition of water and the ratio of its chemical elements significantly change, we say that water is polluted. When the pollutants come from industrial plants, we are talking about industrial wastewater, and when they come from households and urban areas, we are talking about municipal wastewater. Both contain a huge amount of pollutants that eventually end up in rivers. Then, thousands of defenseless birds, fish and other animals suffer, and environmental consequences become immeasurable. In addition, the waste fed to the water often ends up in the bodies of marine animals, so they can return to us as food. Thermal water pollution also has multiple effects on the changes in the wildlife composition of aquatic ecosystems. Polluted water can be purified by mechanical, chemical and biological agents. Mechanical methods are based on the effect of physical forces. Chemical agents are based on chemical processes. Biological measures are based on natural laws and activities of living beings. Water saving and its rational use {{are some of the most}} effective ways of saving water from pollution. Water treatment Water treatment is done in two ways: by sedimentation and filtration. Dirt falling on the bottom is called deposition. The passage of clean water through the material is called filtering. Water containing dissolved substances is purified by distillation. To improve the taste of distilled water, aeration should be performed. The sun’s ultraviolet rays destroy biological pollutants. Mechanical, biological and chemical methods are used for water purification. Mechanical methods Mechanical methods are based on the removal of physical impurities from water and the action of natural forces. For this purpose we use: grids and sieves, sedimentation, flotation, filtration, centrifugation, sand sedimentation tanks, grease traps, primary sedimentation tanks and flow equalization tanks. Wastewater aeration equipment is also used within these facilities. Grids and Sieves Larger, insoluble and floating substances in wastewater are removed with grids and sieves. Sedimentation The application of grids and sieves as well as sand sedimentation tanks and grease traps can be viewed as a process of deposition using certain infrastructure facilities intended for this type of separation of impurities. Infrastructure facilities are sedimentation tanks. There are vertical, horizontal and radial flow sedimentation tanks. Flotation Particle resurfacing with bubbles of air is called flotation. The best effect is achieved by aeration of bubbles of smaller diameters in a larger area. Filtration Filtration is a process used in water conditioning to remove insoluble substances. During filtration, water passes through a layer of granular material placed on a perforated surface. Some other processes can also take place during filtration. Centrifugation Centrifugation is a method of separating particles from a suspension due to the effect of the centrifugal force that is many times greater than the force of gravity. For larger water quantities, it is not realistic to apply centrifugation as a water purification technique. Sand sedimentation tanks Substances with specific gravity higher than water, such as sand, gravel, stone, earth, slag, mineral particles, etc., accumulate in the plants called sand traps. Grease traps Substances lighter than water: oil, grease, soap flakes, bits of wood, cork, etc., are removed by means of grease traps. Flow equalization tanks They provide conditions for the slow and steady movement of water and retain wastewater long enough to provide gravity sedimentation of suspended particles. Chemical methods Chemical purification methods are the processes in which the treatment is carried out by means of certain chemical reactions, or certain physical and chemical phenomena. Basic operations of the chemical wastewater treatment are the removal of suspended and colloidal substances: by coagulation and flocculation, and the removal of some dissolved substances: by chemical deposition, ion exchange, oxidation,   gas blowing and adsorption. Chemical deposition The process of chemical deposition is based on the conversion of dissolved substances in wastewater to insoluble compounds, using suitable reagents. Ion exchange Ion exchange is much more widely used as a water preparation process to remove water hardness than as a wastewater purification process. Oxidation Oxidation can convert some organic and inorganic substances in industrial wastewater into compounds that are far less polluting. The most often used oxidant is chlorine. Gas blowing Some dissolved substances can be removed from the wastewater by means of blowing gas, ordinary air or steam. Adsorption Adsorption is a process of accumulating fluid substances on the surface of the solid phase. A substance being adsorbed is  adsorbate, and the phase upon which the adsorption is carried out is called the adsorbent. Biological methods Biological purification processes are based on the activities of a complex microflora, which is in the course of their life cycle adopted by organic and parts of inorganic materials causing wastewater pollution, using them to maintain life activities and to create new cells. During a biological treatment, stabilized sludge is precipitated,and removed from the water in secondary sedimentation tanks. Biological purification processes can be aerobic and anaerobic, with the help of aerobic or anaerobic microorganisms. Aerobic processes with suspended microflora are divided into: the processes with activated sludge in bioaeration tanks, processes in aerated lagoons (biological lagoons) and processes in aerobic (shallow) lakes (biological artificial lakes). Activated sludge process This is an aerobic process of a biological wastewater treatment, as it occurs due to aerobic microbial population. Microorganisms are found in aeration basins, where, with the help of oxygen in the metabolic process, substrate degradation is provided. Microorganisms oxidize the dissolved substrate into carbon dioxide and water. A part of the organic material is synthesized into new cells or used for the growth of existing ones and the rest consists of waste and excess sludge. A part of sludge is returned into the process (activated sludge) where it has a role of an activator of the biological process. The rest of sludge is discharged into the sludge treatment device or disposed of in a proper way. Clear purified water (effluent) is discharged into the recipient, or, if necessary, taken to additional processing. Process in <b>aerobic</b> <b>lagoons</b> Lagoons and shallow basins, as an aerobic biological wastewater treatment method, provide a sufficient amount of oxygen through photosynthesis. Process in shallow lakes Aerobic lakes are large and shallow earthen basins in which wastewater treatment takes place with minimum regulation, practically as natural self-purification. Anaerobic processes The anaerobic treatment process is based on the methane fermentation of organic wastewater pollution, where organic material is converted into a mixture of gases. The use of microorganisms in the absence of oxygen is called anaerobic digestion. Processing products from the wastewater treatment process Waste materials from the wastewater treatment process should have a high proportion of isolated components and a small proportion of the remaining moisture. Sludge treatment methods may include: thickening, stabilization, conditioning, dewatering, drying or oxidation and disposal. In accordance with the applied technology, sludge treatment processes may be biological, technical and mechanical ones. Biological sludge treatment processes are performed for compost production, to improve sludge residue for disposal, for biological stabilization of sludge residue. Composting is the simplest way of processing biodegradable sludge (humus). Compost can be used in agriculture, to revitalize the soil laid bare by fire and to improve the quality of land next to roads. Mechanical-biological treatment of sludge is based on a process of mechanical treatment of sludge, where valuable components are separated from sludge. These components are metal, paper, plastic, nonmetal or harmful substances that cannot be disposed of in landfills. The thermal treatment of sludge is carried out using the following methods: combustion, pyrolysis and gasification. </p...|$|R
