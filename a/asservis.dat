Technologie et calcul pratique des systemes <b>asservis</b> (Technology and practical design of feedback systems) originated from a lecture given in 1953 by P. Naslin to the Belgian Society of Mechanical Engineers. The text of this lecture was first published in France by DUNOD. Then, this first edition was enlarged, mainly with the numerous papers of the author published in the French journal Automatismes, created in 1956. The second edition, published in 1958, constitutes a reference text book on automatic control for the interest of the different technical examples presented {{as well as for the}} pedagogy of the author to convince French engineers of the relevance of this new science. Methodes Modernes d'Etude des Systemes <b>Asservis</b> presents new analysis techniques associated with poles and zeros of transfer function. The book addresses the statistical analysis of closed loop systems and gathers several extensions of the harmonic approach to multivariable systems and to sampled data systems. Commande optimale des processus is a series of four books devoted to a new approach in the design of control problems by using optimal control: (1) Concepts fondamentaux de l'Automatique, (2) Programmation non linéaire, (3) Programmation dynamique, and (4) Méthodes variationnelles. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
