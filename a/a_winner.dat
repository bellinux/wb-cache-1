The existence of <b>a</b> <b>winner's</b> curse has been suggested {{as a reason to}} relax the licensing conditions and the regulatory environment.

If <b>a</b> <b>winner's</b> curse occurred in some auctions, we may expect a 'winner's bounty' for those companies obtaining licences through non-auction methods.

5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} the broadcast of Part One, there was widespread debate among fans of the series as to who shot Mr. Burns. Fox offered a contest to tie in with the mystery where callers who dialed 1-800-COLLECT were eligible and they then guessed who the culprit was. It ran from August 13 to September 10 {{and was one of}} the first contests to tie together elements of television and the Internet. Fox launched a new website, www.Springfield.com, devoted to the mystery which got over 500,000 hits during the summer of 1995. The winner would be animated on an episode of the show. Due to contest regulations, <b>a</b> <b>winner</b> had to be selected out of a random sample of entries. The sample did not contain any correct answers, and so <b>a</b> <b>winner</b> (who had the wrong answer) was chosen at random. However, the winner, Fayla Gibson of Washington D.C., did not watch the show and opted to accept a cash prize in lieu of being animated.|$|E

5|$|The all-pairs widest path {{problem has}} {{applications}} in the Schulze method for choosing <b>a</b> <b>winner</b> in multiway elections in which voters rank the candidates in preference order. The Schulze method constructs a complete directed graph in which the vertices represent the candidates and every two vertices are connected by an edge. Each edge is directed from the winner to the loser of a pairwise contest between the two candidates it connects, and is labeled with the margin of victory of that contest. Then the method computes widest paths between all pairs of vertices, {{and the winner is}} the candidate whose vertex has wider paths to each opponent than vice versa. The results of an election using this method are consistent with the Condorcet method – a candidate who wins all pairwise contests automatically wins the whole election – but it generally allows <b>a</b> <b>winner</b> to be selected, even in situations where the Concorcet method itself fails. The Schulze method has been used by several organizations including the Wikimedia Foundation.|$|E
