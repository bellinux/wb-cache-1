500|$|Kove's first {{ideas for}} The Danish Poet began {{when she went}} {{through a period of}} self-assessment; she wanted to write a story about what she {{described}} as when [...] "you reach a turning point or a milestone and you look back and you think 'how in the heck did I get here?' [...] And you realize that the answer lies somewhere in a complex web of <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff,</b> like genetic make-up, upbringing, coincidences, choices you made along the way, missed opportunities, [...] lucky breaks." [...] She felt that it was a natural choice to centre on a relationship between two people, [...] "because relationships, and especially the romantic ones, play a huge role in shaping our lives, and also, obviously, in creating new ones." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{an early}} {{review by the}} trade {{magazine}} The Hollywood Reporter, Todd McCarthy said that, [...] "After nearly crashing and burning on his last solo flight in 2010, Iron Man returns refreshed and ready for action in this spirited third installment... benefits immeasurably from the irreverent quicksilver humor of co-writer and director Shane Black. Calling the film [...] "darker and more serious than its predecessors," [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times credited Black for [...] "chang this billion-dollar-plus franchise's tone for the better while keeping the same actor as Tony Stark. ... There is {{quite a bit of}} Black's trademark attitude and humor here as well, things like a throwaway reference to the sci-fi classic Westworld and a goofy character who has Tony Stark's likeness tattooed on his forearm. Black and company throw <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> at the audience, and though it doesn't all work, a lot of it does and the attempt to be different and create unguessable twists is always appreciated." [...] Rafer Guzman of Newsday characterized Iron Man as [...] "the anti-Batman, all zip and zingers. He's also, suddenly, rather family-friendly. Some of the movie's best moments are shared by Stark and latchkey kid Harley (Ty Simpkins), who mock their budding father-son relationship while acting it out." [...] Psychology Today concluded that the film presented an accurate portrayal of Tony Stark's posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Guitar World, posted on November 12, 2008, about the making of his upcoming new EVH Wolfgang guitar from Fender, Eddie Van Halen said, in regard to new Van Halen music, [...] "I'll be making music 'til the day I die. I've done <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff,</b> and more is coming. I can't tell you exactly when right now. Wolfgang is in the 12th grade {{and he needs to}} graduate first. Then I'm getting married in June. We'll pick it up after that." [...] Eddie underwent surgery on his left hand in 2009, following some treatment for arthritis as he felt pain in his fingers during the 2007 tour. In {{an interview}} with Glide Magazine appearing in the May 2010 issue, Dweezil Zappa commented that Eddie had played him [...] "new stuff from his record." [...] It was not clear from the interview if the music was intended for a new Van Halen record.|$|E

5000|$|The {{movie is}} {{partially}} inspired by Rea's childhood experience. Rea commented how [...] "everyone's got a Von Trips {{in their life}} ... for some people it happened through football or movies - a day when a boy's empty, innocent mind suddenly has <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> new <b>stuff</b> blown into it".|$|R
5000|$|... "I’m not a {{computer}} programmer. I couldn’t be fucked doing drum patterns, and <b>all</b> that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff.</b> The songs were quite raw, and I didn’t want to overdo it.

A {{practical}} professional man, tired and hungry, who has been travelling ever since daylight this morning, will hardly be inclined to talk and air courtesies to-night. He wants food and shelter, and you must see that he has it, simply because I am suddenly laid up and cannot. There is nothing so dreadful in that, I hope?

2500|$|Danielson {{described}} himself in ranking {{in the bottom}} 1 percentile for ambition in a personality test WWE gave him. In response, he said, [...] "I have no ambition for what society says is important as far as things like money, and <b>all</b> that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff.</b> What I am ambitious about is I {{want to be the}} best wrestler that I can possibly be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps she will, an' {{perhaps she}} won't.

5000|$|By {{the time}} of the septuplets' tenth {{birthday}} in 2007, the family was declining most requests for interviews, other than annual stories with KCCI (the Des Moines CBS affiliate) and Ladies' Home Journal. Bobbi McCaughey has noted that the level of media attention does not necessarily mean they have granted many interviews, saying, [...] "There was <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> in the papers early on but they never actually interviewed us. Most of it is one paper quoting another." ...|$|E
50|$|Later, Willow {{emerged as}} a threat to Nick and Chelsea's happiness. When Nick stole the hairbrush, it left Willow as the only suspect for the fire. Nick felt sorry for Willow and lent her money. Willow asked for more money, and Nick leased an {{apartment}} for her and gave her his credit card to use for her and her baby. Willow used Nick's credit card excessively, then she called Nick and blackmailed him into giving her more money, credit cards, and <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff.</b>|$|E
5000|$|And the {{governor}} {{came in and}} they cleaned out the hospital. I mean, they had hearings.

The superintendent was fired and the new superintendent was put in, and not only did they do our hospital, they did all the hospitals, mental hospitals in Virginia.|$|R
5000|$|Mellow Owl {{was written}} and {{recorded}} {{on a farm}} in Canada, and an undisclosed location in Vermont, according to liner notes.

5000|$|... "It {{started to}} become really {{frustrating}} and tours were getting cancelled and <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> was happening, so when that stupid, horrible shit blew {{up on the}} Internet, then it had {{reached the point where}} the three of us said that we'd had enough of this, it's done, and so we decided to actually kick Jon Parkin out of the band. Then we sat with Gaza for awhile, {{trying to figure out what}} we were going to do, and eventually it felt like the only right thing to do was just start from scratch." ...|$|E
5000|$|Stylistically, Harris {{argues that}} the record is [...] "more {{mainstream}} rock than metal, very British sounding, very 70s-influenced and quite commercial… but good commercial. There's <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> going on, with nods to The Who and UFO and some classic British rock bands, but it's not the progressive rock album some might be expecting." [...] During his appearance on That Metal Show in September 2012, Harris revealed that he tried a number of bass-playing techniques which he would not do with Iron Maiden, such as letting his strings [...] "go dead".|$|E
5000|$|As the {{interview}} continued, {{she described the}} EP's creative and recording process, stating, [...] "You know, I didn't go into the studio saying 'I'm {{going to make a}} V-Day EP'. I stay in the studio. I have a studio in LA and DC and I travel with a studio, so I'm always creating <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> of all different genres and on every track there is musicianship and live music. There's really nothing that I'm chasing other than putting people in the mood. That's what music should be: an experience. That's why I chose these particular songs around Valentine's Day." ...|$|E

5000|$|Jenner also {{immediately}} {{followed up}} her [...] "what women wear" [...] dilemma with: It's more than that. I'm <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> {{at this point}} in my life where I'm trying to figure this womanhood thing out. It is more than hair, makeup, clothes, <b>all</b> that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff.</b> There's an element here that I'm still <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> searching for. And I think that'll take a while. Because I think as far as gender, we're all on a journey. We're all learning and growing about ourselves. And I feel the same way.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was just}} {{a lot of fun to}} work with the {{different}} people and make everyone comfortable. One of the times I couldn’t find the studio and I didn’t have GPS in my car, so I was trying to find it on my own. <b>All</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> like that happened, but we got it done! At first you might go [...] "Oh, wow," [...] because you aren’t sure you can sing the song they picked, and then you just look at each other and say, [...] "Oh, yeah." [...] You just have to cowboy up and make it right.|$|E
5000|$|On 22 May 2013 {{the murder}} of Lee Rigby {{was carried out by}} two members of Al-Muhajiroun, Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale. From about 2003, Adebolajo was {{corrupted}} by Bakri and then by Choudary, after Bakri left the country in August 2005. One former associate said Adebolajo that “locked himself in this room with this bloke for a few hours and when he came out he was a Muslim convert.

It's been finished for months now, it's just taking longer than expected to finalize everything. Choosing paper type, fonts, test printing for color corrections, <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> I never knew went into publishing a book. I don't know the exact release date at this point, but I will give plenty of notice about its release as soon as I know." ...|$|E
5000|$|According to bassist Emma Anzai, [...] "(Robert Knight) was like, 'Hey I {{want to put}} you in my film.' So we were like, 'All right, cool.' So now it's {{two years}} later and he {{documented}} when we did the first album, the first show, <b>all</b> that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff.</b> It was really cool. He wanted a new band to [...] [...] [...] develop." [...] During the process, the band was filmed for a few days at a time, and said that they would forget the cameras were there and act accordingly, so this film captures the band and their true interactions out of the spotlight.|$|R
5000|$|De Vlaeminck {{is known}} for firm {{opinions}} about cycling and is often consulted by journalists. In particular, he criticizes the trend to have multiple leaders in a team. That, he says, means the best racers share important races between them. De Vlaeminck is also known for his harsh opinion of Tom Boonen, calling him unworthy of equaling his Paris-Roubaix record of 4 wins, claiming cycling isn't {{as hard as it}} used to be. This led to the meme [...] "In den tijd van Roger De Vlaeminck ..." [...] ("in the days of Roger De Vlaeminck") where De Vlaeminck was attributed to doing <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> unrealistic <b>stuff.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Leslie Moore on Tumblr, Cainon Lamb recalled how he started working on the Boyz II Men's sample and how his work reached Knowles. He said that he began working on [...] "Countdown" [...] during the night preceding the 2010 BET Awards. He was in the studio, listening to Boyz II Men's song, [...] "Uhh Ahh". He commented: [...] " [...] starts with a countdown of '10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1'. So I thought, 'Wow, that could be something. Just the countdown itself.'" [...] Once the countdown was in the computer, he slightly increased the pace at which it was played, added some snare drum taps to it, and started a beat. After that, he sent the song to his publisher, EMI Music. The latter {{was impressed with the}} instrumental and went on saying: [...] "I had a meeting this morning with Beyoncé and I played a couple other songs I had and she wasn't really feeling them. When I played the beat that you sent me, you should have seen how she went crazy! She started dancing and bouncing up and down and just doing <b>all</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff.</b> She loved that beat!" [...] On the request of his publisher, Lamb made [...] "a female version of the countdown part". Terius Nash wrote the verses and two days later, Knowles went in the studio and recorded it.|$|R
5000|$|Kove's first {{ideas for}} The Danish Poet began {{when she went}} {{through a period of}} self-assessment; she wanted to write a story about what she {{described}} as when [...] "you reach a turning point or a milestone and you look back and you think 'how in the heck did I get here?' ...

5000|$|When I {{first got}} involved, {{it was kind}} of funny. My mom had me in a talent show, I was one of the winners. agent had his friend there, who was the one that got me on All That. ... The process itself was, oh my gosh. We did 10 auditions. I thought I didn't have it. They had us doing improv, sketches, <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff.</b> I went in fully dressed as Urkel. I was doing {{character}} voices.

5000|$|Yes, {{the people}} that owned Fantasy Records also owned all my early songs, and they would do <b>all</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> I really hated in a {{commercial}} way with my songs. ... Then one day somebody from the L.A. Times actually bothered to call me up and ask me how I felt, and I finally {{had a chance to}} talk about it. And I said I'm very much against my song being used to sell pants. ... So my position got stated very well in the newspaper, and lo and behold, Wrangler to their credit said, 'Wow, even though we made our agreement with the publisher, the owner of the song, we can see now that John Fogerty really hates the idea,' so they stopped doing it.|$|E

Vile stated, [...] "My newest steady bandmate is Rob Laakso, I’ve known him longer than I’ve known other members of my band. He joined the band right after Smoke Ring came out. He’s like a wiz-kid with synthesizers and engineering in general and guitar. He can sync things up with sequences and <b>all</b> that <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>stuff</b> that I like, but am too ADD to figure it out." [...] At {{the close of the}} tour, drummer Mike Zanghi quietly departed from the band.|$|R
