40|$|The {{impact of}} return {{interval}} selection (e. g., daily, weekly, or monthly) on {{the estimation of}} an asset's systematic risk (beta), total risk (variance), <b>and</b> <b>return</b> performance has received considerable attention in financial literature. Results for stocks and bonds indicate that a security's beta, variance, <b>and</b> <b>return</b> performance can be substantially affected by the return interval used in risk <b>and</b> <b>return</b> estimation. For managed futures, however, little is known {{of the impact of}} return interval on risk <b>and</b> <b>return</b> estimation. This is important, since for most public commodity funds, as well as hedge funds, returns are reported at most weekly and often only monthly. If return nterval impacts exist such that the return distributions are not independently distributed, risk <b>and</b> <b>return</b> estimates derived from monthly data may not represent the underlying risk <b>and</b> <b>return</b> patterns of shorter investment periods.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results from a {{randomized}} and controlled field experiment with 4, 000 real e-customers as test subjects. The aim was to investigate how gender moderates the impact of delivery <b>and</b> <b>return</b> policies on purchase <b>and</b> <b>return</b> behavior in e-commerce. We ran the experiment in cooperation with nelly. com, a Nordic e-commerce site that specializes in fashion and beauty. The main conclusion is that gender to some extent moderates purchase <b>and</b> <b>return</b> behavior among e-customers. However, these effects seem too small and sometimes too complex {{in terms of their}} interaction with delivery <b>and</b> <b>return</b> conditions to be exploitable by e-tailers from a practical perspective. In other words, the statistically significant gender effects observed here are insignificant in practice. Hence, the results do not support the idea of customer segmentation based on gender regarding the delivery <b>and</b> <b>return</b> conditions offered by online retailers...|$|R
