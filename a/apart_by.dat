5|$|Central America gained its {{independence}} along with New Spain. On September 15, 1821, an Act of Independence {{was signed in}} Guatemala City which declared Central America (Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica) independent from Spain. The regional elites supported {{the terms of the}} Plan of Iguala and orchestrated the union of Central America with the Mexican Empire in 1821. Two years later, following Iturbide's downfall, the region, with the exception of Chiapas, peacefully seceded from Mexico on July 1, 1823, establishing the Federal Republic of Central America. The new state existed for seventeen years, centrifugal forces pulling the individual provinces <b>apart</b> <b>by</b> 1840.|$|E
5|$|Early on, many barracks at Birkenau {{were taken}} <b>apart</b> <b>by</b> civilians {{who used the}} {{materials}} to rebuild their own homes, levelled out {{in the construction of}} Auschwitz II. The poorest residents sifted the crematoria ashes in search of nuggets from melted gold, before the warning shots were fired. The POW camp for the German prisoners of war was used by the Soviet NKVD until 1947. In the two years, the Soviets dismantled and exported the IG Farben factories to the USSR. Meanwhile, Soviet and Polish investigators worked to document the war crimes of the SS.|$|E

5|$|Fire Emblem Gaiden is a {{tactical}} role-playing game developed by Intelligent Systems {{and published by}} Nintendo for the Family Computer. Released in March 1992, {{it is the second}} installment in the Fire Emblem series, and the last to be developed for the Famicom. It builds upon the basic turn-based strategy gameplay of the previous title, while including new elements such as a navigable overworld. Set in the same world as its predecessor, , Gaiden follows the battles of two opposing armies on the continent of Valentia, which is torn <b>apart</b> <b>by</b> political strife involving the princess Celica and her childhood friend, Alm.|$|E
5|$|Goodensnake's body is cremated in a {{traditional}} ceremony, while the agents watch from a distance. Mulder shares with Scully his belief that both the culprits in both the current case and Hoover's investigation are werewolves.

The elder Parker is subsequently ripped <b>apart</b> <b>by</b> an unseen animal outside his home, and Lyle is found naked and unconscious {{a few hundred yards}} away.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Epsilon {{strengthened}} {{further to}} tie for the second-strongest December hurricane on record with 85mph winds at its peak, and it lasted {{longer than any}} other hurricane ever to form in December.

5|$|In San Francisco, a {{group of}} young men drive to an {{abandoned}} factory, and drug one of their members with LSD, leaving him to be torn <b>apart</b> <b>by</b> what he perceives to be a monster. Later, a large quantity of suspicious ash found in a nearby park is proven to be from human remains. A private investigative organisation, the Millennium Group, dispatches offender profiler Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and colleague Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) to investigate the multiple homicide that led to this. Black believes that the victims were burnt alive; while chemical analysis of the ash leads the Group to the same factory.|$|E
5|$|Kratos gains {{control of}} Danaus' head and uses its power against Alrik, who is torn <b>apart</b> <b>by</b> rocs. Having also been {{covered with the}} Ambrosia, Alrik is revived only to be killed once again until the Ambrosia is spent. Kratos then escapes and returns to Sparta with the Ambrosia, saving his daughter, and giving the King of Sparta {{the rest of the}} elixir, who then officially awards Kratos the rank of Captain in the Spartan Army. Bitter at having lost the wager, Hades resurrects Alrik, who becomes King after his father dies and swears vengeance against Kratos.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{the rivalry}} is {{attributed}} to the bitter rivalry between the sports fans from New York City and Philadelphia, which are approximately two hours <b>apart</b> <b>by</b> car, also seen between the New York Giants and the Philadelphia Eagles in the National Football League, and the New York Rangers and the Philadelphia Flyers in the National Hockey League. Games between the two teams at Citi Field and Citizens Bank Park are often very intense, hard-hitting affairs, as each home crowd does its best to create an unfriendly, sometimes volatile atmosphere for any visiting-team fans.|$|E

5|$|Star {{continued}} expanding, and Jo brought aboard Chinese director Wu Tsun, {{whose first}} film {{for the company}} was Lintah Darat. It had begun production before the release of Tjioeng Wanara and dealt with a family torn <b>apart</b> <b>by</b> dealings with a loan shark. This production received positive reviews. Star then produced a sequel to Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman, again with Wu at the helm, and drew the journalist Saeroen as writer. In this film, titled Pah Wongso Tersangka, Star emphasised comedy, relying on the interactions between Waldy, Pah Wongso, and the comedian Sarip.|$|E
5|$|The Kentish rebels had {{assembled}} a wide-ranging {{list of people}} whom they wanted the King to hand over for execution. It included national figures, such as John of Gaunt, Archbishop Sudbury and Hales; other {{key members of the}} royal council; officials, such as Belknap and Bampton who had intervened in Kent; and other hated members of the wider royal circle. When they reached the Marshalsea Prison in Southwark, they tore it <b>apart.</b> <b>By</b> now the Kent and Essex rebels had been joined by many rebellious Londoners. The Fleet and Newgate Prisons were attacked by the crowds, and the rebels also targeted houses belonging to Flemish immigrants.|$|E
5|$|The four giant {{planets are}} also orbited by {{planetary}} rings of varying size and complexity. The rings are composed primarily of dust or particulate matter, but can host tiny 'moonlets' whose gravity shapes and maintains their structure. Although {{the origins of}} planetary rings is not precisely known, they {{are believed to be}} the result of natural satellites that fell below their parent planet's Roche limit and were torn <b>apart</b> <b>by</b> tidal forces.|$|E

5|$|The four-horned {{antelope}} differs greatly from the nilgai in colour, {{is much smaller}} and has an extra pair of horns. The nilgai is nearly nine times heavier and two times taller than the {{four-horned antelope}}. Two deer species, the Indian muntjac and the hog deer, can be confused with this antelope. The four-horned antelope, however, lacks their antlers. The chinkara, a gazelle, can be told <b>apart</b> <b>by</b> its light brown coat and larger, ringed horns.|$|E
5|$|The {{surface of}} the forewing is super-hydrophobic; it is covered with minute waxy cones, blunt spikes that create a {{water-repellent}} film. Rain rolls across the surface, removing dirt in the process. In the absence of rain, dew condenses on the wings. When the droplets coalesce, they leap several millimetres into the air, which also serves to clean the wings. It {{has been found that}} bacteria landing on the wing surface are not repelled, rather their membranes are torn <b>apart</b> <b>by</b> the nanoscale-sized spikes, making the wing surface the first-known biomaterial that can kill bacteria.|$|E
5|$|A {{different}} scenario {{occurs when}} the moon is either revolving around the primary faster than the primary rotates, or is revolving in the direction opposite the planet's rotation. In these cases, the tidal bulge lags behind the moon in its orbit. In the former case, the direction of angular momentum transfer is reversed, so {{the rotation of the}} primary speeds up while the satellite's orbit shrinks. In the latter case, the angular momentum of the rotation and revolution have opposite signs, so transfer leads to decreases in the magnitude of each (that cancel each other out). In both cases, tidal deceleration causes the moon to spiral in towards the primary until it either is torn <b>apart</b> <b>by</b> tidal stresses, potentially creating a planetary ring system, or crashes into the planet's surface or atmosphere. Such a fate awaits the moons Phobos of Mars (within 30to50million years), Triton of Neptune (in 3.6 billion years), Metis and Adrastea of Jupiter, and at least 16 small satellites of Uranus and Neptune. Uranus's Desdemona may even collide with one of its neighboring moons.|$|E

5|$|After a bloodless {{skirmish}} between Serb {{insurgents and}} Croatian special police in March, the JNA itself, supported by Serbia and its allies, asked the federal Presidency to grant it wartime powers and declare {{a state of}} emergency. The request was denied on 15 March 1991, and the JNA came {{under the control of}} Serbian President Slobodan Milošević in the summer of 1991 as the Yugoslav federation started to fall <b>apart.</b> <b>By</b> the end of the month, the conflict had escalated, resulting in the first fatalities of the war. The JNA then stepped in to support the insurgents and prevent Croatian police from intervening. In early April, leaders of the Serb revolt in Croatia announced their intention to integrate the areas under their control with Serbia. The Government of Croatia considered this an act of secession.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} great {{diversity}} in scale form, they all share a similar structure. Scales, like other macrochaetes, arise from special trichogenic (hair-producing) cells and have a socket which is enclosed in a special 'tormogen' cell; this arrangement provides a stalk or pedicel by which scales {{are attached to the}} substrate. Scales may be piliform (hairlike) or flattened. The body or 'blade' of a typical flattened scale consists of an upper and lower lamella with an air-space in between. The surface towards the body is smooth and known as the inferior lamella. The upper surface, or superior lamella, has transverse and longitudinal ridges and ribs. The lamellae are held <b>apart</b> <b>by</b> struts called trabaculae and contain pigments which give colour. The scales cling somewhat loosely to the wing and come off easily without harming the butterfly.|$|E
5|$|Born in Lancaster, Ohio, Sherman later {{moved to}} Mansfield, where {{he began a}} law career before {{entering}} politics. Initially a Whig, Sherman was among those anti-slavery activists who formed what became the Republican Party. He served three terms in the House of Representatives. As {{a member of the}} House, Sherman traveled to Kansas to investigate the unrest between pro- and anti-slavery partisans there. He rose in party leadership and was nearly elected Speaker in 1859. Sherman was elevated to the Senate in 1861. As a senator, he was a leader in financial matters, helping to redesign the United States' monetary system {{to meet the needs of}} a nation torn <b>apart</b> <b>by</b> civil war. After the war, he worked to produce legislation that would restore the nation's credit abroad and produce a stable, gold-backed currency at home.|$|E
