OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of behaviour changing interventions targeting ordering of thyroid function tests. DESIGN: Systematic review. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Database up to May 2015. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: We included studies evaluating the effectiveness of behaviour change interventions aiming to reduce ordering of thyroid function tests. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomised controlled studies and before and after studies were included. There were no language restrictions. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: 2 reviewers independently screened all records identified by the electronic searches and reviewed the full text of any deemed potentially relevant. Study details were extracted from the included papers and their methodological quality assessed independently using a validated tool. Disagreements were resolved through discussion and arbitration by a third reviewer. Meta-analysis was not used. RESULTS: 27 studies (28 papers) were included. They evaluated a range of interventions including guidelines/protocols, changes to funding policy, education, decision aids, reminders and audit/feedback; often intervention types were combined. The most common outcome measured was the rate of test ordering, but the effect on <b>appropriateness,</b> <b>test</b> ordering patterns and cost were also measured. 4 studies were RCTs. The majority of the studies were of poor or moderate methodological quality. The interventions were variable and poorly reported. Only 4 studies reported unsuccessful interventions but there was no clear pattern to link effect and intervention type or other characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that behaviour change interventions are effective particularly in reducing the volume of thyroid function tests. However, due to the poor methodological quality and reporting of the studies, the likely presence of publication bias and the questionable relevance of some interventions to current day practice, we are unable to draw strong conclusions or recommend the implementation of specific intervention types. Further research is thus justified. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD 42014006192.

40|$|Volvo Car Corporation is a car {{manufacturer}} {{with one of}} the markets strongest brands. Volvo stands for safety and environment and constantly develops new functions in the cars to promote the core values. Icons are often used in displays and for buttons in the driver environment as they require less attention than text. In this thesis project icons are designed for nine different upcoming functions in cars. The thesis is the final project of the Master of Science programme in Ergonomic Design and Production Engineering at Luleå University of Technology and covers 30 university points. It was carried out at Volvo Car Corporations Research and Development department at Lindholmen in Gothenburg. The functions handled were provided by Volvo Car Corporation. A thorough research was done to find icons used to similar functions today and guidelines for icon design. To create a number of concept icons a Production test was performed with seven test subjects. The test aimed to find out what associations there are to the functions’ main features. Concept icons were then designed for each function. The icons where tested in an <b>Appropriateness</b> <b>test</b> where test subjects ranked the icons by how suitable they considered them to be for each provided function. The results were compiled and between one and three icons for each function were chosen for further development. The suggested final designs were tested in a Comprehension/recognition test to find out if they passed the recommended level of comprehension. The test was formulated as a questionnaire where the test subjects examined the icons and described their meaning. The questionnaire was distributed through different car forums on the Internet and mail lists at Luleå University of Technology and generated 118 answers. The answers were evaluated into different levels of comprehension and to be approved as ISO-standard icon it must have 67 % in the top 2 levels (level 1 and 2 on a scale of 10). To be used within Volvo Car Corporation the icon must have a mean value of level 3, or if it is a safety critical icon the mean level for comprehension needed is 2. For the nine provided functions six functions got icons that passed Volvo Car Corporation’s requirements and are recommended to use in the driver environment. Two of the icons passed the requirements for an ISO icon. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
40|$|International {{teaching}} assistants (ITAs) are considered advanced English users with relatively high standardized language proficiency test scores. However, they may experience difficulties during {{their interactions with}} undergraduate students. Some of these difficulties may arise from affective factors such as ambiguity, stress, and adjustment and can impact language use. From an individual differences perspective, a second language user with high communication anxiety may have difficulty comprehending or producing appropriate pragmalinguistic forms. Using a mixed-methods approach, {{this study examined the}} underlying factors in ITAs communication anxiety and willingness to communicate in the US classroom and how these factors explained their pragmatic competence, which refers to the ability to use language in socially appropriate ways. A total of 289 ITAs participated in the study. To measure their judgement of appropriateness, a pragmatic <b>appropriateness</b> <b>test</b> was designed. The speech act production was elicited through a discourse completion test. Two survey instruments were designed to measure ITAs’ classroom communication anxiety and willingness to communicate. The major underlying factors from the exploratory factor analysis performed on the survey responses were ‘ease of communication,’ classroom management anxiety,’ ‘fear of warning,’ and ‘willingness to interact with students’. A six-predictor multiple regression analysis revealed that linguistic competence was the most important factor contributing to pragmatic competence. Other factors such as ease of communication and willingness to communicate positively correlated with pragmatic competence. In addition to quantitative data, qualitative data were collected in the form of classroom observations, field notes, and interviews from a group of ITAs (N = 4) who had also participated in the quantitative part of the study. The analysis of the qualitative data revealed that the situational context of instruction determined the particular communication patterns in different disciplines, specifically the impact of threat posed to the negative and positive face of the discourse participants. Additionally, in conjunction with the quantitative findings, while the ITAs seemed to be generally willing to interact with students, teacher-fronted talk in the form of delivering lectures and self-talk especially in large classes was found to be anxiety-inducing for some of them. Length of residence and opportunities for communication seemed to influence the process of adjustment and acquisition of the classroom pragmatic norms. Finally, ITAs’ perceptions and beliefs about appropriateness seemed to affect their pragmatic performance in the classroom. More specifically, ITAs’ perspectives on education and communication such as moderating the power variable in class and building rapport and interpersonal relationships with students through casual talk seemed to guide their choices of pragmalinguistic forms and politeness strategies. The study offered a number of implications for ITA research and training...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{technological}} developments in laboratory medicine {{have led to}} a major challenge, maintaining a close connection between the search of efficiency through automation and consolidation and the assurance of effectiveness.

Furthermore, even if ongoing {{technological developments}} have considerably improved the productivity of clinical laboratories as well as reducing the turnaround time of the entire process, the value of qualified personnel remains a significant issue. Recent evidence confirms that automation allows clinical laboratories to improve analytical performances only if trained staff operate in accordance with well-defined standard operative procedures, thus assuring continuous monitoring of the analytical quality.

Method: Cognitive assessments were conducted at fortnightly intervals for 2 months and again at 6 and 12 months among a group of Indigenous students from a boarding school in the Northern Territory. These students were to be the healthy control group in a long-term study of substance abuse. Recruitment and attrition rates were reviewed and related challenges for assessing participants were identified. Results: From the recruited sample (n= 49), 18 % reported heavy or frequent use of alcohol, cannabis or petrol. Males {{were more likely to have}} used these substances compared to females.

40|$|AIM [...] To {{examine a}} model for the {{evaluation}} of <b>appropriateness</b> of <b>testing</b> in an emergency biochemistry laboratory. METHODS [...] A model was devised in which incoming emergency test requests were categorised as appropriate or inappropriate. Explicit criteria were used to define eight minor categories, which were chosen to reflect accurately current working practice within the hospital and laboratory. Five junior medical staff each undertook a prospective 24 hour assessment, during which time all incoming requests were monitored and categorised according to these criteria. Concordance between monitors was evaluated before and during assessments. RESULTS [...] Of 509 requests, 384 (75 %) were appropriate and 125 (25 %) were inappropriate according to the criteria used to define categories. Inappropriate requests fell into three main groups: preoperative samples (43. 2 % (54 / 125) of all inappropriate requests), missed routine samples (33. 6 % (42 / 125)) and accelerated (priority) analyses (16 % (20 / 125)). Various other reasons accounted for the remaining 7. 2 % (9 / 125). CONCLUSION [...] This model may be used to obtain valid information about current clinical and laboratory practice.

40|$|Abstract: The {{circuitry}} {{important for}} voluntary movement {{is influenced by}} dopamine from the substantia nigra and regulated by the nigrostriatal system. The basal ganglia influence the pyramidal tract and other motor systems, such as the mesopon-tine nuclei and the rubrospinal tract. Although the neuroana-tomical substrates underlying motor control are similar for humans and rodents, the behavioral repertoire mediated by those circuits is not. The principal aim of this review is to evaluate how injury to dopamine-mediated pathways in rodents gives rise to motor dysfunction that mimics human Parkinson-ism. We will examine the behavioral tests in common use with rodent models of Parkinson’s disease and critically evaluate the <b>appropriateness</b> of each <b>test</b> for detecting motor impairment. We will show how tests of motor performance must be guided by {{a thorough understanding of}} the clinical symptoms accom...|$|R
40|$|ARCO Solar's {{experiences}} as a participant in an industry-utility-government environmental qualification team examining photovoltaic devices are discussed. Included is {{an assessment of the}} applicability, completeness and <b>appropriateness</b> of the <b>testing</b> procedures and of the acceptance criteria for megawatt-sized procurements for utilities. Like the stand-alone users, the utility industry is interested in obtaining low costs, but additional concerns exist related to reliability and durability, safety, grounding and overall system criteria including performance prediction (related to output power acceptance testing), power quality and dispatchability. For purposes of this first major purchase of photovoltaic modules and panels by the utility industry, there was a carry-over of the JPL specifications. The need exists for futher development, assessement, and selection of qualification and testing standards and evaluation criteria specifically addressing these additional concerns for utility-connected PV power-plant applications...|$|R
