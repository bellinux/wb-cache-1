5|$|Reviewers were {{consistent}} in their praises and {{criticism of the}} album. They noted the high production values <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original compositions {{and the performance of}} the orchestra. They also felt that the later tracks in the album were notably weaker than the early tracks, that the arrangements in general did not stray far from the source material, and that several of the track choices did not seem to fit as well as orchestral renditions as others.|$|E
5|$|The {{loudness}} of {{the song}} is correlated {{with the size of}} the male <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> habitat, both indicators of male attractiveness. The loudest males may attract 20 females in one evening, when a quieter male may attract none. This behaviour enables acoustic trapping: females can be trapped in large numbers by broadcasting a male's song very loudly.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the early}} {{success of the}} series, three video games based on the series were {{released}} by Acclaim Entertainment. A first-person shooter simply titled South Park was released in 1998 for the PC, Nintendo 64, and PlayStation. This was followed in 1999 by , a party video game featuring quizzes and mini-games, on the Dreamcast, PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and PC. In 2000, South Park Rally, a racing game, was released on the Dreamcast, PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and PC.

5|$|In 1994, Joseph M.

Wilson introduced the IB Diploma Program in 1998. The turnaround Wilson orchestrated led to a quick resurgence and restoration of the school's academic reputation. Enrollment, student performance, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colleges and universities to which graduates matriculated improved, which attracted critical acclaim from education professionals and international media attention. In 2000, City College was recognized as a National Blue Ribbon School, the highest academic honor bestowed by the U.S. Department of Education. In 2001, the Toronto National Post reported on its search for the perfect high school in Great Britain, the United States, and Canada. One subject of the prominent feature article was Baltimore City College and its turnaround.|$|E
5|$|Lacker was {{instrumental}} in convincing Presley to record with Memphis producer Chips Moman and his handpicked musicians at American Sound Studio in early 1969. The American Sound sessions represented {{a significant departure from}} the control customarily exerted by Hill and Range. Moman still {{had to deal with the}} publisher's staff on site, whose song suggestions he regarded as unacceptable. He was on the verge of quitting, until Presley ordered the Hill and Range personnel out of the studio. Although RCA executive Joan Deary was later full of praise for the producer's song choices <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recordings, Moman, to his fury, received neither credit on the records nor royalties for his work.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the more}} seriously damaged homes were of simple construction, with walls made of mud, adobe, or brick packed 40–50cm (16–20in) thick. These {{materials}} are generally more vulnerable to {{the force of the}} earthquake, but some of the traditionally constructed homes sustained little or no damage. This was due to a range of factors, possibly including the height-to-width ratio, the lack of windows, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> materials used. In general, reinforced concrete-framed homes, built after the 1979 earthquake, were better able to withstand the earthquake. Those near the epicenter still sustained severe damage due to the weight of the roofs and the weak joint connections between major structural elements of the buildings.|$|E
5|$|The concept, {{which was}} set within the mythos of the Fabula Nova Crystallis subseries, {{was for a}} much darker {{scenario}} than other Final Fantasy games. The main cast were designed by Nomura and Naora, while side characters were handled by Nakaaki. Multiple pieces of merchandise and additional media have been created around the characters, including trading cards and multiple manga. They {{have been the subject}} of positive reviews in Japan and import reviews: the main praise has gone to their interactions and writing, while the main criticism was difficulties arising from handling the large cast. Western reviews were also generally positive about the character portrayals, but there were criticisms about dialogue, character interactions, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> localization.|$|E
5|$|The {{concert was}} {{initially}} {{scheduled for a}} single performance, but after selling out within twelve hours a second concert was added prior in the same day in Cologne. This too sold out, {{resulting in a total}} attendance of over 4000. A third performance was held almost six years later on June 18, 2017 in Paris, and a fourth just after on June 20, 2017 in London. A recording of the concert was published as a two-disc album on December 28, 2011 by Dog Ear Records, Uematsu's own record label. The albums, along with the concerts themselves, received varied reviews, with some critics giving enthusiastic praise, especially in regards {{to the quality of the}} performance, the choice of source material, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> arrangements, while other critics greatly disliked several of the arrangements.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, The Royal Park {{embarked}} on {{the restoration of}} the Serpentine to combat growing concerns about the status of the water <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aquatic environment. The project resulted in a substantial change to the hydrology of the lake, which had a turnover time of 10 years, and is now reduced to 4–5 months as a result of new borehole water being pumped into the lake. The three boreholes, drilled into the Upper Chalk, now supply the lake with up to 900,000 cubic metres of water per annum ensuring that the lake remains fresh and does not stagnate. In addition, the historically contaminated sediments have been treated and nutrients within the sediments chemically neutralised. Thirdly, the oxygen status of the water and the overall mixing of the lake is now controlled by a series of 24 aeration pumps fixed {{to the base of the}} lake. These ensure that the dissolved oxygen levels in the lake do not fall and result in chronic ecological stress. Finally, the overall ecology of the lake was reviewed and some of the large bream and carp were removed in February 2012 to reduce their disturbance of the sediment and vegetation of the lake. These measures were implemented over the period October 2011 to June 2012. The resultant water quality of the lake was excellent and proved to be an extremely popular venue for the swimming portion of the London 2012 Triathlon and the Marathon Swim events in August 2012.|$|E
5|$|Much of the city's {{housing stock}} was damaged during the war. The {{wreckage}} was cleared {{in an attempt}} {{to improve the quality of}} dwellings after the war, though before permanent accommodation could be built, Portsmouth City Council built prefabs for those who had lost their homes. Between 1945 and 1947, more than 700 prefab houses were constructed– some were erected over bomb sites. The first permanent houses were built away from the city centre to new developments such as Paulsgrove and Leigh Park, with construction of council estates in Paulsgrove being completed in 1953. In Leigh Park, the first housing estates were completed in 1949, though building work in the area continued until 1974. Developers still occasionally find unexploded bombs in the area, such as on the site of the destroyed Hippodrome theatre in 1984. Despite improvements made by the city council to build new accommodation, a survey made in 1955 concluded that 7000 houses in Portsmouth were unfit for human habitation. Following a controversial decision, a whole section of central Portsmouth, including Landport, Somerstown and Buckland, was demolished and replaced by council housing during the 1960s and early 1970s. The success of the project <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 70s homes are debatable.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolution}} of Chiprovtsi from a mining town to a trade hub owes {{much to the}} settlement of merchants from the Republic of Ragusa (today Dubrovnik, Croatia) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local metalworking, {{as well as the}} lack of permanent Ottoman presence and the privileges enjoyed by the population. By the mid-17th century, mining was in decline, as the silver deposits had been all but exhausted (in 1666 there remained only 16 iron smelteries), forcing the population to seek a more profitable occupation. Since 1659, the Ragusan merchants from Provadiya altered their traditional route to Dubrovnik through Sofia in order to visit Chiprovtsi. The local residents produced and traded with leather, carpets, fabrics, clothes, remarkable gold and silver jewellery, metal tools, cattle, etc. Initially, the Chiprovtsi merchants would only visit Vidin, Pirot, Sofia and Vratsa. Later, however, they appeared at the markets in Istanbul, Thessaloniki, Bucharest, Odessa, Braşov, Sibiu, Belgrade, Buda and Pest, with a particularly strong presence in Wallachia and Transylvania, where they established permanent agencies and sizable companies in Târgovişte, Câmpulung and Râmnic during the rule of Matei Basarab (1632–1654). The international trade broadened the outlook of the locals and introduced the ideas of the age and the European culture of the time to the region.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{findings}} of large amounts of ore, no mining was initiated because of the remote location and the harsh climate. Some ore was extracted in the 19th century.

40|$|Aim – In {{the present}} study the {{relationship}} between <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> parent-child relationship <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> peer relationship on <b>the</b> one hand <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sexual intention of adolescents {{on the other hand}} is examined and whether boys and girls differ in this relationship. Methods – The participants were inexperienced adolescents (n = 1107) in the age of 9 to 18 years (M = 13. 50, SD = 1. 25) who answered the sexual intention question. Online questionnaires were completed including the Network of Relationship Inventory (NRI) and one item for the sexual intention. Results – The results showed no significant relation between <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> parentchild relationship <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sexual intention. Also, no significant relation was found between <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> peer relationship <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sexual intention. No gender differences were found in the relation between <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> parent-child relationship <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> peer relationship on <b>the</b> one hand <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sexual intention on the other hand. Conclusion – <b>The</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> parent-child relationship <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> peer relationship were not related to the sexual intention of adolescents. For future research it is recommended to examine the interaction between peer norms or peer attitudes <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> peer relationship. Also, it is suggested to use <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> mother-child relationship <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> father-child relationship apart.
