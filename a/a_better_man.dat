The horse could leap three spear-lengths high and four spear-lengths forward, enabling Marko to capture the dangerous, elusive vila Ravijojla. She became his blood sister, promising to help him in dire straits. When Ravijojla helped him kill the monstrous, three-hearted Musa Kesedžija (who almost defeated him), Marko grieved because he had slain <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>man</b> than himself.|$|E

Amelia and Dobbin are reconciled and return to England. Becky and Jos stay in Europe. Jos dies, possibly suspiciously, after signing a portion of his money to Becky as life insurance, setting her up with an income.

25|$|Granting no {{concession}} to his precarious legal situation, Socrates speaks emotionally and provocatively to the court, {{and says that}} the greatest good to occur upon Athens is his moral concern for them as fellow citizens. That material wealth {{is a consequence of}} goodness; that the god does not permit <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>man</b> to be harmed by a lesser man; and that he is the social gadfly required by Athens: “All day long, I will never cease to settle here, there, and everywhere — rousing, persuading, and reproving every one of you.” In support of the moral mission assigned him by the Oracle at Delphi, Socrates tells the court that his daimonion continually forbids him to act unethically. That statement implicitly validates Meletus' accusation that Socrates believes in novel deities not of the Athenian pantheon.|$|E

Months later, he is back on track with his life and has {{reconciled}} with Babe, though the two still do not continue their romance. On January 10, 2008, they {{go out for a}} snowday with Little Adam and have fun building a snowman, throwing snowballs and enjoying each other's company. The two express that they like being a family, just them and Little Adam. When JR talks of being <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>man,</b> one that Babe can possibly like again, the two nearly kiss. Babe stops the intimate encounter before it can happen and reminds JR that when they become romantic with each other, it never lasts and ends in destruction. JR tells Babe that he loves her and asks her to give them another chance, but as friends first and see where it leads. Babe, hesitant at first, accepts his request.|$|E

Years later in The Enchanted Forest, Regina recruits Hook to kill Cora, and takes Hook to a tavern, where she requires Hook to kill his father, {{who is now the}} tavern's owner. After the tavern closes, Hook confronts Brennan, who explains that his attempt to flee the law failed and was put under a sleeping curse as punishment; Brennan {{fell in love with the}} sound of his nurse's voice and she with him, allowing a kiss to wake him. They married, but she died soon after having their son, who was named after Liam, to honor his memory. Believed that Brennan has changed, Hook has to make it look like he had his father killed, so he can help his father and Liam escape. When Hook follows Brennan back to his home, he watches him with Liam, and witnesses his father tells Liam the same things he told Hook when he was little, which makes Hook very enraged, thinking that his father lied about having changed. When Brennan goes outside to meet Hook, he takes back his offer, and despite Brennan's insistence that he had changed, Hook kills Brennan, making Hook the person he is now. As Brennan dies, however, he tells Hook that it's never too late to change, to become <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>man.</b>|$|E

Carmen was also acclaimed in numerous French provincial cities including Marseille, Lyon and, in 1881, Dieppe, where Galli-Marié returned to the role. In August 1881 the singer wrote to Bizet's widow to report that Carmens Spanish premiere, in Barcelona, had been [...] "another great success". But Carvalho, who had assumed {{the management of the}} Opéra-Comique, thought the work immoral and refused to reinstate it. Meilhac and Hálevy were more prepared to countenance a revival, provided that Galli-Marié had no part in it; they blamed her interpretation for the relative failure of the opening run.|$|E

40|$|Aim of {{this study}} is to analyze the {{sensitivity}} of the Manning coefficient (n-value) of one dimension steady flow model using HEC-RAS program. The sensitivity is used to approach measured water surface elevations from the field with calculated water surface elevations using the HEC-RAS program. To analyze the Manning coefficient (n), a simple rectangle cross section is used to model a steady flow. This is intended to simplify a sample problem in predicting an more accurate Manning coefficient. This is as a procedure to get the best flow model. The Manning coefficient produced using calibrating procedure can be used to get the best steady flow model. From the results indicate that calibration procedure can provide <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>Manning</b> coefficient rather than without applying the calibration procedure.
