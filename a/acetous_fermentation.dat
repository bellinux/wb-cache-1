The delicate, refined sweetness which exists in carefully kneaded bread, baked just before it passes to the extreme point of fermentation, is something of which they have no conception; and thus they will even regard this process of spoiling the paste by the <b>acetous</b> <b>fermentation,</b> and then rectifying that acid by effervescence with an alkali, as something positively meritorious. How else can they value and relish baker's loaves, such as some are, drugged with ammonia and other disagreeable things, light indeed, so light {{that they seem to}} have neither weight nor substance, but with no more sweetness or taste than so much white cotton? ...|$|E
60|$|The unexpectedness of the {{conclusion}} here, after the somewhat solemn preface, is entirely {{of the essence}} of wit. So, too, is the sudden flirt of the scorpion's tail to sting you. It is almost the opposite of humor in one respect--namely, {{that it would make}} us think the solemnest things in life were sham, whereas it is the sham-solemn ones which humor delights in exposing. This further difference is also true: that wit makes you laugh once, and loses some of its comicality (though none of its point) with every new reading, while humor grows droller and droller the oftener we read it. If we cannot safely deny that Swift was a humorist, we may at least say that he was one in whom humor had gone through the stage of <b>acetous</b> <b>fermentation</b> and become rancid. We should never forget that he died mad. Satirists of this kind, while they have this quality of true humor, that they contrast a higher with a lower, differ from their nobler brethren inasmuch as their comparison is always to the disadvantage of the higher. They purposely disenchant us--while the others rather show us how sad a thing it is to be disenchanted at all.|$|E
6000|$|My tent was pitched {{on a broad}} terrace, {{opposite}} the junction of the Zemu and Thlonok, and 10,850 feet above the sea. It was sheltered by some enormous transported blocks of gneiss, fifteen feet high, and surrounded by a luxuriant vegetation of most beautiful rhododendrons in full flower, willow, white rose, white flowered cherry, thorn, maple and birch. Some great tuberous-rooted Arums* [Two species of Arisaema, called [...] "Tong" [...] by the Tibetans, and [...] "Sinkree" [...] by the Lepchas.] were very abundant; and the ground was covered with small pits, in which were large wooden pestles: these {{are used in the}} preparation of food from the arums, to which the miserable inhabitants of the valley have recourse in spring, when their yaks are calving. The roots are bruised with the pestles, and thrown into these holes with water. <b>Acetous</b> <b>fermentation</b> commences in seven or eight days, which is a sign that the acrid poisonous principle is dissipated: the pulpy, sour, and fibrous mass is then boiled and eaten; its nutriment being the starch, which exists in small quantities, and which they have not the skill to separate by grating and washing. This preparation only keeps a few days, and produces bowel complaints, and loss of the skin and hair, especially when insufficiently fermented. Besides this, the [...] "chokli-bi," [...] and many other esculents, abounded here; and we had great need of them before leaving this wild uninhabited region.|$|E
60|$|But good {{flour and}} good yeast being supposed, with a {{temperature}} {{favorable to the}} development of fermentation, the whole success of the process depends on the thorough diffusion of the proper proportion of yeast through the whole mass, and on stopping the subsequent fermentation at the precise and fortunate point. The true housewife makes her bread the sovereign of her kitchen,--its behests must be attended to in all critical points and moments, no matter what else be postponed. She who attends to her bread when she has done this, and arranged that, and performed the other, very often finds that the forces of nature will not wait for her. The snowy mass, perfectly mixed, kneaded with care and strength, rises in its beautiful perfection till the moment comes for fixing the air-cells by baking. A few minutes now, and the <b>acetous</b> <b>fermentation</b> will begin, and the whole result be spoiled. Many bread-makers pass in utter carelessness over this sacred and mysterious boundary. Their oven has cake in it, or they are skimming jelly, or attending to some other of the so-called higher branches of cookery, while the bread is quickly passing into the acetous stage. At last, when they are ready to attend to it, they find that it has been going its own way,--it is so sour that the pungent smell is plainly perceptible. Now the saleratus-bottle is handed down, and a quantity of the dissolved alkali mixed with the paste,--an expedient sometimes making itself too manifest by greenish streaks or small acrid spots in the bread. As the result, we have a beautiful article spoiled,--bread without sweetness, if not absolutely sour.|$|E

The palm- wine, here called [...] "Msámbá," [...] and on the lower river [...] "Manjewa," [...] is not brought in at dawn, or it would be better. The endogen in general use is the elai's, which is {{considered}} to supply a better and more delicate liquor than the raphia. The people do not fell the tree like the Kru-men, but prefer the hoop of [...] "supple-jack" [...] affected by the natives of Fernando Po and Camarones. A leaf folded funnel-wise, and inserted as usual in the lowest part of the frond before the fruit forms, conveys the juice into the calabashes, often three, which hang below the crown; and the daily produce may be ten quarts. On {{the first day of}} tapping, the sap is too sweet; it is best during the following week and, when it becomes tart, no more must be drawn or the tree will be injured. It cannot be kept; <b>acetous</b> <b>fermentation</b> sets in at once, and presently it coagulates and corrupts. At Banana and Boma it is particularly good; at Porto da Lenha it is half water, but the agents dare not complain, for the reason which prevents them offering [...] "spliced grog" [...] to the prepotent negro. Europeans enjoy the taste, but dislike the smell of palm-wine; those in whom it causes flatulence should avoid it, but where it agrees it is a pleasant stimulant, pectoral, refreshing, and clearing the primæ vice. Mixed with wine or spirits, it becomes highly intoxicating. The rude beers, called by Merolla Guallo and by Tuckey (p. 120) Baamboo, the Oualo of Douville, and the Pombeof East Africa, mentioned by almost every traveller, are not now found on the lower river.|$|E
60|$|Last week a fritter-establishment {{was opened}} in our piazza. It was a wooden booth erected {{in the open}} square, and covered with canvas painted red, which {{looked as if it}} had {{withstood}} much rain and sunshine. In front were three great boughs of laurel, not so much for shade, I think, as ornament. There were two men, and their apparatus for business was a sort of stove, or charcoal furnace, and a frying-pan to place over it; they had an armful or two of dry sticks, some flour, and I suppose oil, and this seemed to be all. It was Friday, and Lent besides, and possibly there was some other peculiar propriety in the consumption of fritters just then. At all events, their fire burned merrily from morning till night, and pretty late into the evening, and they had a fine run of custom; the commodity being simply dough, cut into squares or rhomboids, and thrown into the boiling oil, which quickly turned them to a light brown color. I sent J----- to buy some, and, tasting one, it resembled an unspeakably bad doughnut, without any sweetening. In fact, it was sour, for the Romans like their bread, and all their preparations of flour, in a state of <b>acetous</b> <b>fermentation,</b> which serves them instead of salt or other condiment. This fritter-shop had grown up in a night, like Aladdin's palace, and vanished as suddenly; for after standing through Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, it was gone on Monday morning, and a charcoal-strewn place on the pavement where the furnace had been was the only memorial of it. It was curious to observe how immediately it became a lounging-place for idle people, who stood and talked all day with the fritter-friers, just as they might at any old shop in the basement, of a palace, or between the half-buried pillars of the Temple of Minerva, which had been familiar to them and their remote grandfathers.|$|E
6000|$|... "The corpse, being {{supposed}} at {{the bottom}} of the river, will there remain until, by some means, its specific gravity again becomes less than that of the bulk of water which it displaces. This effect is brought about by decomposition, or otherwise. The result of decomposition is the generation of gas, distending the cellular tissues and all the cavities, and giving the puffed appearance which is so horrible. When this distension has so far progressed that the bulk of the corpse is materially increased without a corresponding increase of mass or weight, its specific gravity becomes less than that of the water displaced, and it forthwith makes its appearance at the surface. But decomposition is modified by innumerable circumstances--is hastened or retarded by innumerable agencies; for example, by the heat or cold of the season, by the mineral impregnation or purity of the water, by its depth or shallowness, by its currency or stagnation, by the temperament of the body, by its infection or freedom from disease before death. Thus it is evident that we can assign no period, with any thing like accuracy, at which the corpse shall rise through decomposition. Under certain conditions this result would be brought about within an hour; under others, it might not take place at all. There are chemical infusions by which the animal frame can be preserved forever from corruption; the Bi-chloride of Mercury is one. But, apart from decomposition, there may be, and very usually is, a generation of gas within the stomach, from the <b>acetous</b> <b>fermentation</b> of vegetable matter (or within other cavities from other causes) sufficient to induce a distension which will bring the body to the surface. The effect produced by the firing of a cannon is that of simple vibration. This may either loosen the corpse from the soft mud or ooze in which it is imbedded, thus permitting it to rise when other agencies have already prepared it for so doing; or it may overcome the tenacity of some putrescent portions of the cellular tissue; allowing the cavities to distend under the influence of the gas.|$|E

40|$|Among 63 strains {{isolated}} from fruits and homemade vinegars from different ecosystems of Morocco, a thermotolerant bacterium with high production of acetic acid was selected and evaluated {{for its ability}} to perform efficient <b>acetous</b> <b>fermentation</b> at high temperature in a bioreactor. CV 01 strain, {{isolated from}} cactus (Opuntia ficus-indica), was considered to be an Acetobacter pasteurianus sp. according to phylogenetic study based on 16 s rDNA gene sequence analysis. An optimal culture medium containing initial concentrations of acetic acid and ethanol of 1 % (v/v) and 4 % (v/v), respectively, was used. The growth kinetics of this isolate were monitored in ﬂasks and compared with those of the wild type LMG 1625 mesophilic strain and the thermoresistant Acetobacter senegalensis reference strain. The CV 01 strain exhibited abundant growth along with high amount of produced acetic acid at high temperature (41 °C). Subsequently, a 20 -L stirred tank bioreactor was used to assess thermotolerance and acidoresistance properties of the selected strain during semi-continuous acetic acid fermentation at 38 °C. Interestingly, a total amount of 13. 4 % (w/v) acetic acid was yielded at the end of fermentation. Moreover, this bacterium could produce during the same fermentation process a final concentration of 11. 2 g/L gluconic acid, a sensory quality indicator in vinegar production.

40|$|The {{activity}} of bacterial strains significantly influences {{the quality and}} the taste of vinegar. Previous studies of acetic acid bacteria have primarily focused {{on the ability of}} bacterial strains to produce high amounts of acetic acid. However, few studies have examined the production of gluconic acid during <b>acetous</b> <b>fermentation</b> at high temperatures. The production of vinegar at high temperatures by two strains of acetic acid bacteria isolated from apple and cactus fruits, namely AF 01 and CV 01, respectively, was evaluated in this study. The simultaneous production of gluconic and acetic acids was also examined in this study. Biochemical and molecular identification based on a 16 s rDNA sequence analysis confirmed that these strains can be classified as Acetobacter pasteurianus. To assess the ability of the isolated strains to grow and produce acetic acid and gluconic acid at high temperatures, a semi-continuous fermentation was performed in a 20 -L bioreactor. The two strains abundantly grew at a high temperature (41 °C). At the end of the fermentation, the AF 01 and CV 01 strains yielded acetic acid concentrations of 7. 64 % (w/v) and 10. 08 % (w/v), respectively. Interestingly, CV 01 was able to simultaneously produce acetic and gluconic acids during acetic fermentation, whereas AF 01 mainly produced acetic acid. In addition, CV 01 was less sensitive to ethanol depletion during semi-continuous fermentation. Finally, the enzymatic study showed that the two strains exhibited high ADH and ALDH enzyme activity at 38 °C compared with the mesophilic reference strain LMG 1632, which was significantly susceptible to thermal inactivation.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work was first the isolation of novel acetic acid bacteria strains from natural Moroccan habitats, and then, the evaluation {{of their ability to}} produce microbial starters for vinegar production on a large scale. The strains were isolated from figs, dates, cactus, and traditional fruit vinegars. Four strains, selected from a total of 63 isolates, were confirmed as belonging to Acetobacter species according to biochemical and molecular studies based on 16 s rRNA sequence analysis. <b>Acetous</b> <b>fermentation</b> tests, performed on date and apple fermented juices using selected Acetobacter strains, showed a high capacity of acidification. The most efficient strain KU 710511, isolated from Morrocan cactus (Opuntia ficus-indica), was identified as Acetobacter strain closely related to A. pasteurianus and yielded 42. 5 g/L acidity in apple juice. Cell growth optimization was carried out for KU 710511 using response surface methodology (RSM). The linear, quadratic, and interaction effects of four factors—ethanol, acetic acid, glucose concentrations and pH—were studied by the application of a central composite design. Thirty experiments were designed to predict the maximum concentration of cell biomass. The optimal calculated values of ethanol, acetic acid, glucose and pH allowing the prediction of the maximum biomass production (2. 21 g/L) were 28. 18 g/L, 10. 12 g/L, 15. 15 g/L and 5. 33, respectively. Subsequently, further batch fermentations were carried out in a 6 -L lab-bioreactor at optimal and thermal stress conditions. The results were in line with the predicted values. It can be concluded that the studied strain is well suited {{to be used as a}} parental strain to prepare a starter for fruit vinegar production. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Acetic acid {{bacteria}} (AAB) {{are used}} industrially to produce {{different kinds of}} bioproducts. AAB encounter very aggressive conditions during <b>acetous</b> <b>fermentation</b> (AF) including high acid and ethanol concentrations, low pH and also abrupt increases in temperature. In subtropics such as central and southern parts of Iran, fruits and also the by-products of the fruit processing industries are used to produce different kinds of foods. However, because of high temperature and deficiency in water resource, fermentation industries face many restrictions during spring and summer. One of the main problematic restrictions is the low productivity or the ceases of fermentation due {{to the use of}} non-thermotolerant microorganisms. In this case, initiation of a new fermentation run needs efficient starter. In previous studies in Walloon Center of Industrial Biology, Acetobacter senegalensis, a novel thermo-tolerant bacterium, was isolated and used to produce vinegar starter and acetic acid at high temperature. However, in those studies, the viability and vitality of the starter were not evaluated under stress conditions. In addition, since most kinds of industrial vinegars have low prices, the use of high-priced nutrients for the production of low quantity of starter is not commercially cost-effective. In the present study, with a deep look to the <b>acetous</b> <b>fermentation</b> requirements, we analyzed the fundamental and applied aspects of A. senegalenisis resistance to stress inducers. Proteomics-based techniques and flow cytometry methods in combination with different biomass production techniques were used to develop a fermentation process improving cell viability and vitality during freeze-drying process and revitalization procedure. In addition, the trend of cell senescence during storage of starter and its effect on some bio-molecules were studied. In {{the first part of the}} study, the quality of the produced biomass was improved in order to achieve an acetic acid tolerant biomass. Adaptive laboratory evolution technique (ALE) enabled cells to grow rapidly in higher concentration of acetic acid. The results of 2 D-DiGE on the produced biomass revealed that structural and regulatory proteins were expressed differently under various conditions (Chapter II and III). Use of acetic acid in combination with glucose in a fed-batch fermentation mode could induce a physiological condition in A. senegalensis which was close to the physiological state of cells oxidizing ethanol. In addition, the presence of acetic acid in fermentation media could cause a cross-adaptation and improved the tolerance of cells to stressors (ethanol, low pH and acetic acid). Interestingly, by using this method for production of biomass, the rate of growth on ethanol improved significantly. In parallel to the first part of the study, we exhibited the influence of different stress on the produced biomass. Cell envelope integrity and respiration (dehydrogenase activity) were the two important targets for adverse effects of the stress. Assessment of the cell envelope integrity and respiration system of produced biomass by Multiparametric Flow Cytometry (MFC) method (Chapter II) demonstrated that the detrimental effects of ethanol and acetic acid depended on the carbon sources and fermentation conditions used for pre-adaptation. Respiration system and cell envelope integrity of cross-adapted iv cells were not compromised after exposure to different concentrations of ethanol and acetic acid. Thus, according to the obtained results, by using a mixture of acetic acid and glucose as carbon sources, it is possible to enhance not only the viability of cells but also induce tolerance to physicochemical stress during downstream process. Our investigation about the freeze-drying process provided a better understanding of lethal and sub-lethal damage to cells (Chapter IV). The results showed that drying process had the greatest effect on the viability and vitality of A. senegalensis especially by affecting on the cell envelope. In addition, entrance into viable but non-culturable state (VBNC) was initiated during the drying process and enhanced during storage period. Analysis of the stored cell proteome by 2 D-DiGE and western blotting (Chapter V) revealed that high storage temperature could induce a kind of senescence in the cells by different modifications in cellular proteome such as insolubility, degradation and carbonylation of cellular proteins and shift of isoelectric point. Carbonylation of the proteins involved in transcriptional and translational process could cause cell death whereas VBNC formation at low storage temperature seemed to be due to other deteriorative reactions such as fatty acid peroxidation. At the end of this dissertation, the discussion (Chapter VI) provides a general overview of the results and compares our findings with earlier studies. Potential industrial applications are reviewed and suggestions for further research are made...|$|E
