40|$|One of {{the major}} aims of the modern {{materials}} foundry industry is the achievement of advanced mechanical properties of metals, especially of light non-ferrous alloys such as aluminum. Usually an alloying process is applied to obtain the required properties of aluminum alloys. However, the presented work describes an alternative approach {{through the application of}} vibration treatment, modification by ultrafine powder and a combination of these two methods. Microstructural studies followed by image analysis revealed the refinement of α-Al grains with an increase in the Si network area around them.

To {{describe}} {{the shape and}} location of free surfaces in the mold filling simulation, parameters including volume filled ratio, surface dimensionless distance, and surface filled ratio for the DFDM (Direct Finite Difference Method) elements were proposed.

It had been applied to an experimental <b>Al</b> <b>casting.</b> In-situ observation and record of actual mold filling process of the casting with special X-ray apparatus were carried out, and were used to validate the simulation results.

40|$|Eutectic Al–Si {{binary alloy}} is {{technically}} {{one of the}} most important <b>Al</b> <b>casting</b> alloys due to its high corrosion resistance, evident shrinkage reduction, low thermal expansion coefficient, high fluidity, and good weldability. In this work, multiphased Al–Si matrix nanocomposites reinforced with Al 2 O 3 and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) have been sintered by an in situ vacuum hot-pressing method. The alumina Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles were introduced by an in situ reaction of Al with SiO 2. Microstructure and mechanical properties of the sintered Al/Si/Al 2 O 3 /SiO 2 /MWCNTs nanocomposites with different alumina contents were investigated. The mechanical properties were determined by micro-Vickers hardness and compressive and shear strength tests.

The wear mechanism involves microcutting-abrasion and adhesion at lower load {{for all of the}} alloys studied in the present work. On the other hand, at higher load, mainly adhesive wear along with oxide formation is observed for gravity <b>cast</b> A 356 <b>Al</b> alloy and rheocast A 356 <b>Al</b> alloy, <b>cast</b> using a 45 degrees slope angle. Unlike other alloys, 60 degrees slope rheocast A 356 Al alloy is found to undergo mainly abrasive wear at higher load. Accordingly, the rheocast sample, cast using a 60 degrees cooling slope, exhibits a remarkably lower wear rate at higher load compared to gravity cast and 45 degrees slope rheocast samples. This is attributed to the dominance of abrasive wear at higher load in the case of rheocast A 356 <b>Al</b> alloy <b>cast</b> using a 60 degrees slope. The presence of finer and more spherical primary Al grain morphology is found to resist adhesive wear in case of 60 degrees cooling slope processed rheocast alloy and thereby delay the transition of the wear regime from normal wear to severe wear...|$|R

40|$|Newly {{developed}} {{high conductivity}} Al-Fe-Ni alloys {{are expected to}} be used for various electronic and electrical applications instead of conventional low conductivity <b>Al</b> <b>casting</b> alloys. In this research, influence of Ni content on the mold filling ability and hot cracking susceptibility of Al-Fe-Ni alloys was investigated. The cast microstructure of Al- 0. 5 Fe-xNi alloys mainly consists of primary aluminum and 2 nd phases, and the kind of the 2 nd phases is dependent on the Ni content. As the Ni content was increased, Al 3 Ni phase became dominant as the 2 nd phase. Although the Ni additions reduced the conductivity a little, Al- 0. 5 Fe-xNi alloys with nickel ranging from 0. 5 to 2 % showed significantly higher electrical conductivity than conventional Al-Si based alloys. The mold filling ability measured by fluidity serpentine test of Al-Fe-Ni alloys decreased significantly when more than 1 %Ni was added. The mold filling ability measured by using a pressure die-casting method showed the similar results with respect to the Ni content. Meanwhile, hot cracking susceptibility was increased remarkably when more than 0. 5 %Ni was added...|$|E
40|$|The {{economical}} {{and environmental}} effects of mass reduction through Al and Mg primary alloys substitutions for cast iron and steel in automotive components are discussed using MF. Ashby 2 ̆ 7 s penalty functions method The viability of Mg alloy substitutions for existing Al alloy cast components is also considered. The cost analysis shows that direct, equal-volume, Al alloy substitutions for cast iron and steel are the most feasible {{in terms of the}} CAFE liability, followed by substitutions involving flat panels of prescribed stiffness. When the creation of CO 2 associated to the production of Al and Mg is considered, the potential gasoline savings over the lifespan of the car compensate for the intrinsic environmental burden of Al in all applications, while electrolytic Mg substitutions for cast iron and steel are feasible for equal volume and panels only. Magnesium produced by the Pidgeon thermal process appears to be too primary energy intensive to be competitive in structural applications. Magnesium substitutions for existing Al alloy beams and panels are generally unviable.

Design/methodology/approach: In aim of realization of forced movement during the crystallization of liquid metal was used rotate electromagnetic field, which is generated by induction coil fed with frequency of supply current from 25 to 100 Hz. Effect of structure refinement obtained by influence of electromagnetic field was compared with refinement obtained by use of traditional inoculation, which consists in introducing of additions in form of titanium and boron to metal bath.

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to study the influence of trace Titanium (Ti) on the micros-tructures and properties of as-cast Mg- 9 Al alloy. We found that Ti could increase the corrosion resis-tance of the alloy in NaCl solution. The addition of trace Ti in Mg- 9 <b>Al</b> <b>cast</b> alloy improved the proper-ties greatly. The elongation (δ 5) of the alloys was also improved greatly with Minor addition of Ti as low as 0. 015 wt%. The improvements on the mechanical properties and corrosion resistence were mainly due to the inhibition of Ti to the heterogeneous nucleation during solidification and the modification of β phase. As the Ti additional amount increases, the grain of as-cast Mg- 9 Al alloy coarsens rapi- dly. Meanwhile, the β phase was refined and changed from semi-netted shape to short rods or even spheres...|$|R

40|$|In the <b>Al</b> <b>casting</b> industry, TiB 2 grain refiner {{particles}} {{are added to}} the melt in order to promote heterogeneous nucleation of α-Al crystallites. It has been suggested that thin Al 3 Ti DO 22 layers, adsorbed on the boride particles, might be necessary for successful α-Al nucleation via the peritectic reaction. In order to elucidate this suggestion, the boride/α-Al interfaces were studied in the as-received Ti-B-Al grain refiner rod, as well as after remelting and rapid quenching of the same rod. The investigation was performed using the TEM, EDS, STEM and HREM techniques. For the as- received rod, the EDS study failed to show conclusively enrichment of the interfaces in Ti and indicated clearly only a small enrichment in Si and Fe. The HREM investigation found no indication of a possible crystalline layer coating the boride particles. The borides found in the re-melted rod were observed to readily nucleate α-Al on their basal faces with a well-defined low-index orientation relationship but there was again no indication of any layer on the boride particles. Thus, the borides themselves appeared to be potent sites for the heterogeneous nucleation of α-Al crystals during rapid quenching without a necessary presence of the aluminide layers...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} mass {{reduction}} through substitution of ferrous components by equivalent Al or Mg alloy components on the vehicle 2 ̆ 7 s cost and CO 2 emissions are discussed using M. F. Ashby 2 ̆ 7 s penalty functions and exchange constants method. The viability of substitutions of At alloys by Mg alloys is also considered. Substitutions of cast components at equal volume and panels and beams at constant stiffness are considered. Substitutions of cast ferrous components are economically the only viable ones {{in terms of}} the CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) liability, although the cost penalty can be fully offset by the gasoline savings {{over the life of the}} car for most other forms of light alloy substitutions. When primary alloys are used, the gasoline savings over the lifetime of a lighter car offset the CO 2 footprint of Al alloys in all cases. Because of their larger CO 2 footprint, the environmental feasibility is somewhat restricted for electrolytic Mg, and more so for Mg produced by the Pidgeon process. Due to their high recyclability, <b>Al</b> <b>casting</b> alloys have a significant environmental advantage over all other light alloy applications.

40|$|Purpose: The {{metal casting}} process {{requires}} testing equipment {{that along with}} customized computer software properly supports the analysis of casting component characteristic properties. Due {{to the fact that}} this evaluation process involves the control of complex and multi-variable melting, casting and solidification factors, it is necessary to develop dedicated software. Design/methodology/approach: The integration of Statistical Process Control methods and Artificial Intelligence techniques (Case-Based Reasoning) into Thermal Analysis Data Acquisition Software (NI LabView) was developed to analyze casting component properties. The thermal data was tested in terms of accuracy, reliability and timeliness in order to secure metal casting process effectiveness. Findings: Quantitative values were defined as “Low”, “Medium” and “High” to assess the level of improvement in the metal casting analysis by means of the Artificial Intelligence-Based Control System (AIBCS). The traditional process was used as a reference to measure such improvement. As a result, the accuracy, reliability and timeliness were significantly increased to the “High” level. Research limitations/implications: Presently, the AIBCS predicts a limited number of casting properties. Due to its flexible design more properties could be added. Practical implications: The AIBCS has been successfully used at the Ford/Nemak Windsor Aluminum Plant (WAP) to analyze <b>Al</b> <b>casting</b> properties of the engine blocks.

In this work, the Weibull moduli for the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and % elongation of sand cast bars produced under different casting conditions were compared as indicators of casting reliability which was expected to be a function of the oxide film content. The results showed that the use of a thin runner along with the use of filters can significantly eliminate the surface turbulence of the melt during mould filling which would lead to the avoidance of the generation and entrainment of surface oxide films and in turn produce castings with more reliable and reproducible mechanical properties compared to the castings produced using conventional running systems...|$|R

The structure of compacts with 1 at%C {{is composed of}} Fe 3 Al grains of 1. 5 µm in diameter and nano κ-carbides (Fe 3 AlC 0. 5) precipitates, while those of compacts with 2 and 4 at%C are composed of nanocrystalline Fe 3 Al of about 80 nm in diameter, nano κ-carbides and α-grains of about 1 µm in diameter.

40|$|Grain {{refinement}} {{is a vital}} {{technique in}} aluminum (<b>Al)</b> <b>casting</b> industry, in which Al- 5 Ti- 1 B (5 wt. pct Ti and 1 wt. pct B) master alloy is often used as a grain refiner. Castablity and processability of aluminum can be enhanced substantially. Different theories of grain refinement were proposed {{in the past few}} decades, however, there is still no consensus on the mechanism of Al grain refinement. In this study, Al- 5 Ti- 1 B master alloy was diluted at different ratios. Scanning electron microscopes (SEM) are used for microstructure characterization. Based on microstructural analysis, it is speculated that a dynamic Ti-rich layer is formed on the surface of TiB 2 particles to nucleate aluminum (α-Al) grains. But the Ti-rich layer will subsequently be dissolved through a peritectic reaction and release Ti atoms in to the aluminum matrix. A small amount of dissolution of TiB 2 releases Ti atoms making a Al 3 Ti layer of a few atoms thick remain, contributing to the nucleation of α-Al grains. The rates of Al 3 Ti layer and TiB 2 dissolution are different, so the appearance of Al 3 Ti layer will be sporadic, forming a dynamic layer. Therefore, the nucleation and growth of Al 3 Ti phase is a dynamic process. Based on microstructure analysis, a dynamic nucleation theory is proposed in this investigation. ...|$|E
