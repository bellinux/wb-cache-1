5|$|Four <b>anatomic</b> {{features}} must {{be present}} for orotracheal intubation to be straightforward: adequate mouth opening (full {{range of motion}} of the temporomandibular joint), sufficient pharyngeal space (determined by examining {{the back of the}} mouth), sufficient submandibular space (distance between the thyroid cartilage and the chin, the space into which the tongue must be displaced in order for the larygoscopist to view the glottis), and adequate extension of the cervical spine at the atlanto-occipital joint. If any of these variables is in any way compromised, intubation should be expected to be difficult.|$|E
5|$|He was {{particularly}} interested in dementia praecox (which he favored renaming schizophrenia), and found diffuse <b>anatomic</b> differences in the brains of schizophrenic patients. These changes were ignored or dismissed as artifactual by other investigators for several decades. Serious attention to Southard's findings did not reemerge in the medical literature until the 1990s, but changes in diagnostic criteria complicate the application of Southard's findings to modern schizophrenic patients. Shortly before his death Southard wrote and presented Non-dementia non-praecox: note on the advantages to mental hygiene of extirpating a term, but did not live to see it published.|$|E
5|$|In 1500 polymath Leonardo da Vinci {{provides}} the first {{illustration of the}} thyroid. In 1543 Anatomist Andreas Vesalius gave the first <b>anatomic</b> description and illustration of the gland. In 1656 the thyroid received its name, by the anatomist Thomas Wharton. The gland was named thyroid, meaning shield, as its shape resembled the shields commonly used in Ancient Greece. The English name thyroid gland {{is derived from the}} medical Latin used by Wharton – glandula thyreoidea. Glandula means gland in Latin, and thyreoidea {{can be traced back to}} the Ancient Greek word θυρεοειδής, meaning shield-like/shield-shaped.|$|E
5|$|Placement {{of dental}} {{implants}} is a surgical procedure and carries the normal risks of surgery including infection, excessive bleeding and necrosis of the flap of tissue around the implant. Nearby <b>anatomic</b> structures, {{such as the}} inferior alveolar nerve, the maxillary sinus and blood vessels, can also be injured when the osteotomy is created or the implant placed. Even when {{the lining of the}} maxillary sinus is perforated by an implant, long term sinusitis is rare. An inability to place the implant in bone to provide stability of the implant (referred to as primary stability of the implant) increases the risk of failure to osseointegration.|$|E
5|$|The McGill Medical Museum catalogues, preserves, conserves and {{displays}} collections that documents {{the study and}} practice of medicine at McGill University and its associated teaching hospitals. The Medical museum features collections, individual specimens, artifacts, equipment log books/autopsy journals/paper materials and medical instruments and apparati, 25 wax models, 200 mostly skeletal dry specimens; and 400 lantern slides of <b>anatomic</b> specimens. There is a special emphasis on pathology; there are 2000 fluid filled-preserved anatomical and pathological specimens. The Osler collection, for example consists of 60 wet specimens while The Abbott collection consists of 80 wet specimens, mostly examples of congenital cardiac disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{recognition of}} pancreatic cancer has {{been attributed to}} the 18th-century Italian scientist Giovanni Battista Morgagni, the historical father of modern-day <b>anatomic</b> pathology, who claimed to have traced several cases of cancer in the pancreas. Many 18th and 19th-century physicians were skeptical about the existence of the disease, given the similar appearance of pancreatitis. Some case reports were published in the 1820s and 1830s, and a genuine histopathologic diagnosis was eventually recorded by the American clinician Jacob Mendes Da Costa, who also doubted the reliability of Morgagni's interpretations. By the start of the 20th century, cancer of the head of the pancreas had become a well-established diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{guinea pigs}} in {{scientific}} experimentation dates {{back at least}} to the 17th century, when the Italian biologists Marcello Malpighi and Carlo Fracassati conducted vivisections of guinea pigs in their examinations of <b>anatomic</b> structures. In 1780, Antoine Lavoisier used a guinea pig in his experiments with the calorimeter, a device used to measure heat production. The heat from the guinea pig's respiration melted snow surrounding the calorimeter, showing that respiratory gas exchange is a combustion, similar to a candle burning. Guinea pigs {{played a major role in}} the establishment of germ theory in the late 19th century, through the experiments of Louis Pasteur, Émile Roux, and Robert Koch. Guinea pigs have been launched into orbital space flight several times, first by the USSR on the Sputnik 9 biosatellite of March 9, 1961 – with a successful recovery. China also launched and recovered a biosatellite in 1990 which included guinea pigs as passengers.|$|E
5|$|Different {{areas of}} the brain exhibit {{different}} forms of LTP. The specific type of LTP exhibited between neurons depends on a number of factors. One such factor is the age of the organism when LTP is observed. For example, the molecular mechanisms of LTP in the immature hippocampus differ from those mechanisms that underlie LTP of the adult hippocampus. The signalling pathways used by a particular cell also contribute to the specific type of LTP present. For example, some types of hippocampal LTP depend on the NMDA receptor, others may depend upon the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR), while still others depend upon another molecule altogether. The variety of signaling pathways that contribute to LTP and the wide distribution of these various pathways in the brain are reasons that the type of LTP exhibited between neurons depends in part upon the <b>anatomic</b> location in which LTP is observed. For example, LTP in the Schaffer collateral pathway of the hippocampus is NMDA receptor-dependent, whereas LTP in the mossy fiber pathway is NMDA receptor-independent.|$|E
25|$|While some imaging scans such as CT and MRI isolate organic <b>anatomic</b> {{changes in}} the body, PET and SPECT are capable of {{detecting}} areas of molecular biology detail (even prior to <b>anatomic</b> change). PET scanning does this using radiolabelled molecular probes that have different rates of uptake {{depending on the type}} and function of tissue involved. Changing of regional blood flow in various <b>anatomic</b> structures (as a measure of the injected positron emitter) can be visualized and relatively quantified with a PET scan.|$|E
25|$|It is {{uncertain}} {{whether it is}} a congenital <b>anatomic</b> narrowing or a functional hypertrophy of the pyloric sphincter muscle.|$|E
25|$|Both <b>anatomic</b> and {{physiologic}} methods allow {{early detection}} before symptoms show up, disease staging and tracking of disease progression. <b>Anatomic</b> methods {{are more expensive}} {{and some of them}} are invasive in nature, such as IVUS. On the other hand, physiologic methods are often less expensive and safer. But they do not quantify the current state of the disease or directly track progression. In recent years, developments in nuclear imaging techniques such as PET and SPECT have provided ways of estimating the severity of atherosclerotic plaques.|$|E
25|$|Stem-cell niche {{refers to}} a microenvironment, within the {{specific}} <b>anatomic</b> location where stem cells are found, which interacts with stem cells to regulate cell fate.|$|E
25|$|Importantly, the use {{of drugs}} (whether chemotherapy, {{hormonal}} therapy or targeted therapy) constitutes systemic therapy for cancer in that they are introduced into the blood stream and are therefore in principle able to address cancer at any <b>anatomic</b> location in the body. Systemic therapy is often used in conjunction with other modalities that constitute local therapy (i.e. treatments whose efficacy is confined to the <b>anatomic</b> area where they are applied) for cancer such as radiation therapy, surgery or hyperthermia therapy.|$|E
25|$|The chest (thoracic cavity) {{progressively}} slopes outwards {{from the}} thoracic inlet (atop the breastbone) and above {{to the lowest}} ribs that support the breasts. The inframammary fold, where the lower portion of the breast meets the chest, is an <b>anatomic</b> feature created by the adherence of the breast skin and the underlying connective tissues of the chest; the IMF is the lower-most extent of the <b>anatomic</b> breast. Normal breast tissue typically has a texture that feels nodular or granular, to an extent that varies considerably from woman to woman.|$|E
25|$|<b>Anatomic</b> Pathology (AP) {{is one of}} the {{two primary}} {{certifications}} offered by the American Board of Pathology (the other is Clinical Pathology (CP)) and one of three primary certifications offered by the American Osteopathic Board of Pathology. To be certified in <b>anatomic</b> pathology, the trainee must complete four years of medical school followed by three years of residency training. Many U.S. pathologists are certified in both AP and CP, which requires a total of four years of residency. After completing residency, many pathologists enroll in further years of fellowship training to gain expertise in a subspecialty of AP or CP.|$|E
25|$|<b>Anatomic</b> pathology: units {{included}} {{here are}} histopathology, cytopathology, and electron microscopy. Academically, each unit is studied alone in one course. Other courses pertaining to this section include anatomy, physiology, histology, pathology, and pathophysiology.|$|E
25|$|Negrito peoples may {{descend from}} Australoid-Melanesian {{settlers}} of Austronesia. Despite being isolated, the different peoples do share genetic similarities with their neighboring populations. They also show relevant phenotypic (<b>anatomic)</b> variations which require explanation.|$|E
25|$|Surgery need {{never be}} {{considered}} for genetically male (XY) infants because the excess androgens do not produce <b>anatomic</b> abnormality. However, surgery for severely virilized XX infants is often performed {{and has become a}} subject of debate in the last decade.|$|E
25|$|The human nose is a sensory organ that is {{structurally}} {{composed of}} {{three types of}} tissue: (i) an osseo-cartilaginous support framework (nasal skeleton), (ii) a mucous membrane lining, and (iii) an external skin. The <b>anatomic</b> topography of the human nose is a graceful blend of convexities, curves, and depressions, the contours of which show the underlying shape of the nasal skeleton. Hence, these <b>anatomic</b> characteristics permit dividing the nose into nasal subunits: (i) the midline (ii) the nose-tip, (iii) the dorsum, (iv) the soft triangles, (v) the alar lobules, and (vi) the lateral walls. Surgically, {{the borders of the}} nasal subunits are ideal locations for the scars, whereby is produced a superior aesthetic outcome, a corrected nose with corresponding skin colors and skin textures.|$|E
25|$|In {{realizing the}} breast-reduction corrections, the plastic surgeon takes <b>anatomic</b> and histologic {{account of the}} biomechanical, {{load-bearing}} properties of the glandular, adipose, and skin tissues that compose and support the breast; among {{the properties of the}} soft tissues of the breast is near-incompressibility (Poisson's ratio of ∼0.5).|$|E
25|$|A {{computational}} framework was presented, based on statistical shape modelling, {{for construction of}} race-specific organ models for internal radionuclide dosimetry and other nuclear-medicine applications. The proposed technique used to create the race-specific statistical phantom maintains <b>anatomic</b> realism and provides the statistical parameters for application to radionuclide dosimetry.|$|E
25|$|The {{surgical}} {{management of}} nasal defects and deformities divides the nose into six (6) <b>anatomic</b> subunits: (i) the dorsum, (ii) the sidewalls (paired), (iii) the hemilobules (paired), (iv) the soft triangles (paired), (v) the alae (paired), and (vi) the columella. Surgical correction and reconstruction comprehend the entire <b>anatomic</b> subunit {{affected by the}} defect (wound) or deformity, thus, the entire subunit is corrected, especially when the resection (cutting) of the defect encompasses more than 50 per cent of the subunit. Aesthetically, the nose—from the nasion (the midpoint of the nasofrontal junction) to the columella-labial junction—ideally occupies one-third of the vertical dimension of the person’s face; and, from ala to ala, it ideally should occupy one-fifth of the horizontal dimension of the person's face.|$|E
25|$|Positron {{emission}} tomography (PET) uses coincidence detection to image functional processes. Short-lived positron emitting isotope, such as 18F, is incorporated with an organic substance such as glucose, creating F18-fluorodeoxyglucose, {{which can be}} used as a marker of metabolic utilization. Images of activity distribution throughout the body can show rapidly growing tissue, like tumor, metastasis, or infection. PET images can be viewed in comparison to computed tomography scans to determine an <b>anatomic</b> correlate. Modern scanners may integrate PET, allowing PET-CT, or PET-MRI to optimize the image reconstruction involved with positron imaging. This is performed on the same equipment without physically moving the patient off of the gantry. The resultant hybrid of functional and <b>anatomic</b> imaging information is a useful tool in non-invasive diagnosis and patient management.|$|E
25|$|In {{realizing the}} breast lift, the mastopexic {{correction}} takes <b>anatomic</b> and histologic {{account of the}} biomechanical, load-bearing properties of the three (3) tissue types (glandular, adipose, skin) that compose and support the breast; among {{the properties of the}} soft tissues of the breast is near-incompressibility (Poisson’s ratio of ∼0.5).|$|E
25|$|An {{article in}} The Scientist notes, “The {{difficulties}} associated with using animal models for human disease {{result from the}} metabolic, <b>anatomic,</b> and cellular differences between humans and other creatures, but the problems go even deeper than that” including issues with the design and execution of the tests themselves.|$|E
25|$|Cardiac {{output and}} {{peripheral}} resistance {{are the two}} determinants of arterial pressure. Cardiac output is determined by stroke volume and heart rate; stroke volume is related to myocardial contractility and {{to the size of}} the vascular compartment. Peripheral resistance is determined by functional and <b>anatomic</b> changes in small arteries and arterioles.|$|E
25|$|The {{inconsistent}} {{relationship of}} glaucomatous optic neuropathy with increased intraocular pressure has provoked hypotheses and studies on <b>anatomic</b> structure, eye development, nerve compression trauma, optic nerve blood flow, excitatory neurotransmitter, trophic factor, retinal ganglion cell/axon degeneration, glial support cell, immune system, aging mechanisms of neuron loss, and severing of the nerve fibers at the scleral edge.|$|E
25|$|In the {{diagnosis}} of abdominal hernias, imaging is the principal means of detecting internal diaphragmatic and other nonpalpable or unsuspected hernias. Multidetector CT (MDCT) can show with precision the <b>anatomic</b> site of the hernia sac, {{the contents of the}} sac, and any complications. MDCT also offers clear detail of the abdominal wall allowing wall hernias to be identified accurately.|$|E
25|$|Histopathology - the {{microscopic}} examination of stained tissue sections using histological techniques. The standard stains are haematoxylin and eosin, {{but many others}} exist. The use of haematoxylin and eosin-stained slides to provide specific diagnoses based on morphology {{is considered to be}} the core skill of <b>anatomic</b> pathology. The science of staining tissues sections is called histochemistry.|$|E
25|$|Local tetanus is an {{uncommon}} {{form of the}} disease, in which patients have persistent contraction of muscles in the same <b>anatomic</b> area as the injury. The contractions may persist for many weeks before gradually subsiding. Local tetanus is generally milder; only about 1% of cases are fatal, but it may precede the onset of generalized tetanus.|$|E
25|$|Pulmonary {{pathology}} is a subspecialty of <b>anatomic</b> (and especially surgical) pathology {{that deals}} with diagnosis and characterization of neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases of the lungs and thoracic pleura. Diagnostic specimens are often obtained via bronchoscopic transbronchial biopsy, CT-guided percutaneous biopsy, or video-assisted thoracic surgery. These tests can be necessary to diagnose between infection, inflammation, or fibrotic conditions.|$|E
25|$|Contraindications to HIFU for {{prostate}} cancer include a prostate volume larger than 40grams, which can prevent targeted HIFU waves from reaching the anterior and anterobasal regions of the prostate, <b>anatomic</b> or pathologic conditions that may interfere with the introduction or displacement of the HIFU probe into the rectum, and high-volume calcification within the prostate, {{which can lead to}} HIFU scattering and transmission impairment.|$|E
25|$|<b>Anatomic</b> {{pathology}} {{relates to}} the processing, examination, and diagnosis of surgical specimens by a physician trained in pathological diagnosis. Clinical pathology is the division that processes the test requests more familiar to the general public; such as blood cell counts, coagulation studies, urinalysis, blood glucose level determinations and throat cultures. Its subsections include chemistry, hematology, microbiology, immunology, urinalysis and blood bank.|$|E
25|$|Tension {{from the}} APL and ADP muscles {{frequently}} leads to {{displacement of the}} fracture fragments, even {{in cases where the}} fracture fragments are initially in their proper <b>anatomic</b> position. Because of the aforementioned biomechanical features, Bennett fractures nearly always require some form of intervention to ensure healing in the correct anatomical position and restoration of proper function of the thumb CMC joint.|$|E
25|$|Local anesthetics {{can block}} almost every nerve between the {{peripheral}} nerve endings {{and the central}} nervous system. The most peripheral technique is topical anesthesia to the skin or other body surface. Small and large peripheral nerves can be anesthetized individually (peripheral nerve block) or in <b>anatomic</b> nerve bundles (plexus anesthesia). Spinal anesthesia and epidural anesthesia merge into the central nervous system.|$|E
