5|$|Ordinarily, spinner sharks do {{not pose}} a {{substantial}} danger to humans; they do not perceive large mammals as prey, as their small, narrow teeth are adapted for grasping rather than cutting. However, they can become excited {{by the presence of}} food, so caution is warranted if this species is encountered while spearfishing. As of 2008, the International Shark Attack File listed 16 unprovoked attacks and one provoked attack <b>attributable</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> spinner shark, none of them fatal.|$|E
5|$|Overall, the {{hurricane}} caused $26.5million in damages, with $11.5million to property and $15million to crops, with the storm's damage in Texas spread across twelve counties.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE: <b>To</b> {{quantify}} <b>the</b> {{burden of}} ill {{health in the}} UK that can be attributed <b>to</b> food (<b>the</b> burden of food related ill health). DESIGN: Review and further analysis {{of the results of}} work concerned with estimates of the burden of disease measured as morbidity, mortality, and in financial terms and with the proportion of that burden that can be attributed to food. MAIN RESULTS: Food related ill health is responsible for about 10 % of morbidity and mortality in the UK and costs the NHS about 6 billion pounds annually. CONCLUSIONS: The burden of food related ill health measured in terms of mortality and morbidity is similar <b>to</b> that <b>attributable</b> <b>to</b> smoking. <b>The</b> cost <b>to</b> <b>the</b> NHS is twice <b>the</b> amount <b>attributable</b> <b>to</b> car, train, and other accidents, and more than twice that <b>attributable</b> <b>to</b> smoking. <b>The</b> vast majority of <b>the</b> burden is <b>attributable</b> <b>to</b> unhealthy diets rather than to food borne diseases...|$|R

5|$|The reason Byzantine Greek merchants {{have often}} been {{neglected}} in historiography {{is not that they}} were any less able than their ancient or modern Greek colleagues in matters of trade. It rather originated with the way history was written in Byzantium, which was often under the patronage of their competitors, the court, and land aristocracy. The fact that they were eventually surpassed by their Italian rivals is <b>attributable</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> privileges sought and acquired by the Crusader States within the Levant and the dominant maritime violence of the Italians.|$|E
5|$|Women with {{a family}} history of endometrial cancer are at higher risk. Two genes most {{commonly}} associated with some other women's cancers, BRCA1 and BRCA2, do not cause endometrial cancer. There is an apparent link with these genes but it is <b>attributable</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> use of tamoxifen, a drug that itself can cause endometrial cancer, in breast and ovarian cancers. The inherited genetic condition Cowden syndrome can also cause endometrial cancer. Women with this disorder have a 5–10%lifetime risk of developing endometrial cancer, compared to the 2–3%risk for unaffected women.|$|E
5|$|According to the 2010 census, the {{population}} of the city was 65,870. The population density was 831.9 people per square mile (321.2/km²). There were 26,254 housing units at an average density of 336.5 per square mile (129.9/km²). The racial makeup of the city was 73.4% White, 1.9% Black or African American, 11.7% Native American, 1.9% Asian, 0.2% Pacific Islander, 7.3% from other races, and 3.6% from two or more races. 18.4% of {{the population}} were Hispanics or Latinos of any race. The city's African American population is considerably lower than the U.S. average (1.9% versus 12.6%), while the Native American population is markedly higher (11.7% vs. 0.9%). This is primarily <b>attributable</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city's proximity to several Native American reservations, including the Navajo, Hopi, Havasupai, and Yavapai. Flagstaff's Native American community is chiefly Navajo, and there are about 5,500 people of Navajo ancestry living in the city.|$|E

5|$|Derek da Cunha has {{proposed}} that the law of large numbers favours the GRC system. According to the theory, {{the large number of}} voters from GRC wards generally, though not necessarily always, reflects the popular vote. This was evident at the 2006 elections, at which the PAP garnered an average of 67.04% of the votes in a contested GRC, while the average was 61.67% for a SMC ward. The national average for the 2006 elections was 66.6%. Similar trends can be seen from previous elections. In fact, the percentage difference in the PAP votes between SMCs and GRCs grew from 3% in 1991, and remained stable at around 5% in the 1997, 2001 and 2006 elections. This may be <b>attributable</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> enlargement of the size of GRCs in 1997 which gave greater effect to the law of large numbers.|$|E
5|$|Given its {{formidable}} {{size and}} dentition, the silky shark {{is regarded as}} potentially dangerous to humans. However, it only rarely comes into contact with people due to its oceanic habits. Its natural curiosity and boldness may lead it to repeatedly and closely approach divers, and it can become dangerously excited {{in the presence of}} food. The silky shark tends to be more aggressive if encountered on a reef than in open water. Cases of individual sharks persistently harassing divers and even forcing them out of the water have been reported. As of May 2009, the International Shark Attack File lists six attacks <b>attributable</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> silky shark, three of them unprovoked and none fatal.|$|E
5|$|Lumbar {{puncture}} {{is performed}} {{to measure the}} opening pressure, {{as well as to}} obtain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to exclude alternative diagnoses. If the opening pressure is increased, CSF may be removed for transient relief (see below). The CSF is examined for abnormal cells, infections, antibody levels, the glucose level, and protein levels. By definition, all of these are within their normal limits in IIH. Occasionally, the CSF pressure measurement may be normal despite very suggestive symptoms. This may be <b>attributable</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact that CSF pressure may fluctuate {{over the course of the}} normal day. If the suspicion of problems remains high, it may be necessary to perform more long-term monitoring of the ICP by a pressure catheter.|$|E

5|$|Some {{historians have}} claimed that had German {{intruder}} operations been maintained over Britain in 1941, and thereafter, the British night flying training program, which produced {{the nucleus of the}} huge bomber force that operated in 1944–45, could have been halted or disrupted. The decision not to continue intruder operations, in their view, allowed the British to build their bomber force virtually unhindered for over four years. A consequence of an effective German intruder campaign at this time may have given the Luftwaffe night fighter defences an unassailable lead in the night war, and may have stopped, or diminished, the effectiveness of British bombing operations. This omission could be {{regarded as one of the}} major errors <b>attributable</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> OKL concerning the air defence of Germany.|$|E
5|$|The Irish overprinted stamps came, as {{supplied}} from the printers in London, with a watermark of the Royal Cypher of George V. The first Irish watermark was a stylised {{design of the}} two overlapping letters 's' and 'e' making an 'se' watermark representing {{the name of the}} country Saorstát Éireann. This watermark was discontinued around 1940 when the country's name changed to Éire (Ireland); it was replaced with e watermark paper to represent Éire. Stamps of the period may have the watermark in any of several states of inversion and rotation <b>attributable</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> way the paper was fed into the printing machines.|$|E
5|$|The charismatic {{movement}} {{forced a}} reevaluation {{of what it}} was to be Pentecostal. The Assemblies of God understood Spirit baptism in the context of baptistic evangelical theology and, by the 1950s, emphasized certain doctrines and practices as requisite for Spirit baptism. Charismatics challenged these views by claiming to receive Holy Spirit baptism outside of this context (such as remaining in liturgical churches, failing to reject sacramental theologies, and not adopting Pentecostal taboos on dancing, drinking, smoking, etc.). On the local level, Assemblies of God churches were influenced by the charismatic movement. Some charismatics left their original churches and joined less formal Assemblies of God congregations. In addition, the contemporary decreased emphasis on traditional Pentecostal taboos in the AG is in part <b>attributable</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> charismatic movement, which accelerated a trend already in existence.|$|E

40|$|Excess {{body weight}} (EBW) {{increases}} the risk of specific cancers. The prevalence of EBW has risen significantly in Ireland over recent decades. <b>To</b> highlight <b>the</b> impact on cancer, and to inform future policies, we calculated the proportion of cancers in Ireland that were <b>attributable</b> <b>to</b> EBW using <b>the</b> Population Attributable Fraction (PAF).

We found that each year in Ireland, approximately 800 new cancers and 300 cancer deaths are <b>attributable</b> <b>to</b> EBW. <b>The</b> greatest <b>attributable</b> risk of cancer was seen for the upper digestive tract and endometrium, whilst breast and colorectal have the greatest numbers of attributable cancers.

5|$|The rise of Macedon, {{from a small}} kingdom at the {{periphery}} of classical Greek affairs to one which came to dominate the entire Hellenic world (and beyond), occurred {{in the span of}} just 25 years, between 359 and 336 BC. This ascendancy is largely <b>attributable</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> personality and policies of Philip II (r. 359–336 BC). In addition to utilising effective diplomacy and marriage alliances to achieve his political aims, Philip II was also responsible for reforming the ancient Macedonian army into an effective fighting force. The Macedonian phalanx became the hallmark of the Macedonian army during his reign and the subsequent Hellenistic period. His army and engineers also made extensive use of siege engines.|$|E
5|$|A {{study from}} Currie, Horner, Erickson and Longrich in 2010 {{has been put}} forward as {{evidence}} of cannibalism in the genus Tyrannosaurus. They studied some Tyrannosaurus specimens with tooth marks in the bones, <b>attributable</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> same genus. The tooth marks were identified in the humerus, foot bones and metatarsals, and this was seen as evidence for opportunistic scavenging, rather than wounds caused by intraspecific combat. In a fight, they proposed {{it would be difficult}} to reach down to bite in the feet of a rival, making it more likely that the bite marks were made in a carcass. As the bite marks were made in body parts with relatively scanty amounts of flesh, it is suggested that the Tyrannosaurus was feeding on a carcass in which the more fleshy parts had already been consumed. They were also open to the possibility that other tyrannosaurids practiced cannibalism. Other evidence for cannibalism has been unearthed.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, a {{terminal}} phalanx bone (ungual claw bone) <b>attributable</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> genus Ara from south-western Marie-Galante {{was described by}} ecologists Monica Gala and Arnaud Lenoble. It was discovered in the Blanchard Cave during excavations in 2013-2014, in a fossil-bearing deposit dating to the late Pleistocene epoch. The deposit was radiocarbon dated to about 10,690 years ago; the earliest evidence of human settlement in the area has been dated to 5,300 years ago. This confirmed that the Guadeloupe region once had an endemic macaw which {{could not have been}} brought there by humans. All other macaw bones from the Lesser Antillean islands have been recovered from archaeological sites, and could therefore have been the remains of birds brought there by Amerindians. The size of the phalanx bone matched what was described for the Lesser Antillean macaw by contemporary writers, and the authors therefore correlated the two. They conceded that this connection could only be tentative, as there were no remains of the Lesser Antillean macaw to compare with.|$|E
