40|$|Compliant {{components}} such {{as large}} sheet metal components {{are commonly used}} in various products including automotive, aircraft and home appliances. Because of part-to-part variations, deformation <b>and</b> <b>stresses</b> are induced in the assembly process. An approach to the assembly tolerance analysis of compliant structures is presented in this paper. Given component deformation, assembly deformation <b>and</b> <b>stresses</b> are derived by finite element analysis (FEA). The influence of component deformation on assembly deformation <b>and</b> <b>stresses</b> is studied by response surface methodology (RSM), and a regression model is developed. Using the developed regression model, Monte Carlo simulation was conducted to study assembly tolerance <b>and</b> <b>stresses.</b> This approach is illustrated by an example...|$|R

5|$|Although the {{increase}} in jobs for women has had benefits in policy changes for families with working parents, there has been debates about {{the conditions of the}} work places. In Mexico, there is an influx of the maquila industry, which produces products that will be sold in the developed nations.

As Parkinson's is not a curable disease, all treatments are focused on slowing decline and improving quality of life, and are therefore palliative in nature.|$|E
5|$|Road to Ruin is {{the fourth}} studio album by American punk rock band the Ramones, {{released}} on September 21, 1978, through Sire Records.

30|$|According to the {{different}} features of the deformation area, the deformation area is divided into five regions named A, B, C, D and E, as shown in Figure  8. Because no deformation occurs on the cylinder wall, all stresses are zero on region E. The {{outer edge of the}} flange (Region A) shows tensile tangential <b>stress</b> <b>and</b> compressive radial <b>stress.</b> The middle region of the flange (Region B) shows tensile tangential <b>stress</b> <b>and</b> radial <b>stress,</b> <b>and</b> the round corner (Region C) shows tensile tangential <b>stress</b> <b>and</b> compressive radial <b>stress.</b> The inner edge (Region D) shows compressive tangential <b>stress</b> <b>and</b> radial <b>stress.</b> It can be known that the inner edge of the flange may incur wrinkling because of the tangential compressive <b>stress</b> <b>and</b> radial compressive <b>stress.</b> Additionally, bulges can appear in the round corner because of the compressive radial stress.|$|R

In 2007, the store held a fashion exhibition to celebrate the Casual Male Retail Group acquisition of the men's big & tall clothing company Jared M., a company popular among athletes and celebrities for its custom sportswear; several NBA players were happy to show their support since the founder had fitted many of them in the past.|$|E

Although most of these symbols indicate distinctions that are phonemic at the word level, symbols also exist for intonation on a level greater than that of the word. Various ligatures of tone letters are used in the IPA Handbook despite not being found on the simplified official IPA chart.|$|E
5|$|At 02:45, Amethyst {{was able}} to pull across the bows of Niémen, inflicting a devastating raking fire on the French ship which caused terrible damage. Niémen surged forward into Amethyst, but the {{collision}} caused little damage and at 03:00 Amethyst again raked her opponent, this time from the east. The frigates were so close that shot from Amethyst started fires among Niémens hammock netting, placed along the decks to deter boarding actions.

5|$|Chlorine {{is widely}} used for purifying water, {{especially}} potable water supplies and water used in swimming pools. Several catastrophic collapses of swimming pool ceilings have occurred from chlorine-induced stress corrosion cracking of stainless steel suspension rods. Some polymers are also sensitive to attack, including acetal resin and polybutene. Both materials were used in hot and cold water domestic plumbing, <b>and</b> <b>stress</b> corrosion cracking caused widespread failures in the USA in the 1980s and 1990s. The picture on the right shows a fractured acetal joint in a water supply system. The cracks started at injection molding defects in the joint and slowly grew until the part failed. The fracture surface shows iron and calcium salts that were deposited in the leaking joint from the water supply before failure.|$|E
5|$|Counseling {{about sex}} and {{sexuality}} by medical professionals, psychologists, social workers, and nurses {{is a part of}} most SCI rehabilitation programs. Education is part of the follow-up treatment for people with SCI, as are psychotherapy, peer mentorship, and social activities; these are helpful for improving skills needed for socializing and relationships. Rather than addressing sexual dysfunction strictly as a physical problem, appropriate sexual rehabilitation care takes into account the individual as a whole, for example addressing issues with relationships and self-esteem. Sexual counseling includes teaching techniques to manage depression <b>and</b> <b>stress,</b> and to increase attention to preserved sensations during sexual activity. Education includes information about birth control or assistive devices such as those for positioning in sex, or advice and ideas for addressing problems such as incontinence and autonomic dysreflexia.|$|E
5|$|Epileptic {{seizures}} {{are thought}} to relate to abnormal electrical activity. Seizure activity can manifest as absence (of consciousness), focal effects such as limb movement or impediments of speech, or be generalized in nature. Status epilepticus refers to a seizure or series of seizures that have not terminated within 30 minutes, although this definition has recently been revised. Seizures have {{a large number of}} causes, however many seizures occur without a definitive cause being found. In a person with epilepsy, risk factors for further seizures may include sleeplessness, drug and alcohol intake, <b>and</b> <b>stress.</b> Seizures may be assessed using blood tests, EEG and various medical imaging techniques based on the medical history and exam findings. In addition to treating an underlying cause and reducing exposure to risk factors, anticonvulsant medications can play a role in preventing further seizures.|$|E

5|$|Interviews with {{communities}} {{from both}} sides of the political divide indicate how Chávez is seen by the rich and poor. The latter support his stated aim to redistribute the country's oil wealth; the former fear totalitarianism and are worried Chávez will institute communism. In February 2002, the media war intensifies after Chavez takes control of PDVSA. The film states that the company was previously run as a private interest for the benefit of a minority, despite being state-owned. Business leader Pedro Carmona and union boss Carlos Ortega are the main voices of the opposition. After the pair visit Washington, D.C., the CIA and the State Department express concern about Chávez's rule <b>and</b> <b>stress</b> the importance of Venezuela's oil. A Venezuelan general appears on private television to voice similar disquiet. Carmona appeals for a public protest at the offices of PDVSA.|$|E
5|$|Ytterbium {{has three}} allotropes labeled by the Greek letters alpha, beta and gamma; their {{transformation}} temperatures are −13°C and 795°C, although the exact transformation temperature {{depends on the}} pressure <b>and</b> <b>stress.</b> The beta allotrope (6.966 g/cm3) exists at room temperature, {{and it has a}} face-centered cubic crystal structure. The high-temperature gamma allotrope (6.57 g/cm3) has a body-centered cubic crystalline structure. The alpha allotrope (6.903 g/cm3) has a hexagonal crystalline structure and is stable at low temperatures. The beta allotrope has a metallic electrical conductivity at normal atmospheric pressure, but it becomes a semiconductor when exposed to a pressure of about 16,000 atmospheres (1.6GPa). Its electrical resistivity increases ten times upon compression to 39,000 atmospheres (3.9GPa), but then drops to about 10% of its room-temperature resistivity at about 40,000atm (4.0GPa).|$|E
