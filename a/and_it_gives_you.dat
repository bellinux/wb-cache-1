500|$|Liverpool's victory {{meant they}} won the trophy for the eighth time, {{extending}} their record number of victories in the competition. Midfielder Stewart Downing was awarded the Alan Hardaker Trophy as {{the man of the}} match. Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish was delighted to have won the League Cup and was adamant that the club would continue to win trophies: [...] "Although we have won something today, that is not us finished, we don't want to stop here. We want to keep going. We've won it {{and we are going to}} really enjoy it. I know how much the players have enjoyed it <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> a wee flavour to come back and do it again." [...] The victory meant that Dalglish became the seventh manager to win all three major domestic trophies in English football. Goalscorer Dirk Kuyt was equally delighted to have won the competition: [...] "We wanted this so desperately, this is why I came to Anfield. To get my first medal is great." [...] Meanwhile, captain Steven Gerrard had mixed emotions, due to his cousin Anthony Gerrard missing the deciding penalty: [...] "One of Anthony or I was going to be sad, one was going to be celebrating. It happens. I've got mixed emotions at the moment because I feel for Anthony and Cardiff." ...|$|E
500|$|Shaw's {{views on}} {{religion}} and Christianity were less consistent. Having in his youth proclaimed himself an atheist, in middle age he explained this as a reaction against the Old Testament image of a vengeful Jehovah. By the early twentieth century, he termed himself a [...] "mystic", although Gary Sloan, in an essay on Shaw's beliefs, disputes his credentials as such. In 1913 Shaw declared {{that he was not}} religious [...] "in the sectarian sense", aligning himself with Jesus as [...] "a person of no religion". In the preface (1915) to Androcles and the Lion, Shaw asks [...] "Why not give Christianity a chance?" [...] contending that Britain's social order resulted from the continuing choice of Barabbas over Christ. In a broadcast just before the Second World War, Shaw invoked the Sermon on the Mount, [...] "a very moving exhortation, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> one first-rate tip, which is to do good to those who despitefully use you and persecute you". In his will, Shaw stated that his [...] "religious convictions and scientific views cannot at present be more specifically defined than as those of a believer in creative revolution". He requested that no one should imply that he accepted the beliefs of any specific religious organisation, and that no memorial to him should [...] "take the form of a cross or any other instrument of torture or symbol of blood sacrifice".|$|E

2500|$|In September, Madonna shot some scenes {{involving}} Lourdes. Shooting {{took place}} around Mayfair, outside the hotel Claridge's, {{as well as}} in a set of Downing Street, created in Aldwych. Lourdes's scenes required her to be dressed as a schoolgirl. The same month, filming moved to New York, where Madonna shot scenes in Brooklyn. A dance sequence was shot where D'Arcy had to do a ballet, but {{he did not know how}} to do it and was requested by Madonna to learn the steps. D'Arcy described the sequence as [...] "this extraordinary beautiful dance with lifts and twirls and I can't do that, but you do because she [...] somehow makes the impossible possible <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> amazing self esteem when you do these things." [...] Although the dance scene did not make the final cut of the film, Madonna also asked D'Arcy to learn to play bagpipes in six weeks and to ride horses.|$|E

You make as much money as most of the fellows in places, and you lead a pleasanter life. If you were on any one paper, you'd have to be on duty about fifteen hours out of the twenty-four; you'd be out every night till three or four o'clock; you'd have to do fires, and murders, and all sorts of police business; and now you work mostly on fancy jobs,--something you suggest yourself, or something you're specially asked to do.
