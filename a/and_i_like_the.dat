500|$|From 1996 through 2001, Downey {{was arrested}} {{numerous}} times on drug-related charges including cocaine, heroin and marijuana and went several times through {{drug treatment programs}} unsuccessfully, explaining in 1999 to a judge: [...] "It's like I have a shotgun in my mouth, and I've got my finger on the trigger, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> taste of the gun metal." [...] He explained his relapses by claiming to have been addicted to drugs {{since the age of}} eight, {{due to the fact that}} his father, also an addict, had been giving them to him.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Guardian, Clarkson said {{that she wanted to}} include the song in her first album, Thankful (2003), but she was laughed at. Then, she took the initiative to polish the song by sending a tape to Moody and Hodges, whom later worked with her and received co-writing credit of the song. Clarkson explained, [...] "Hearing the Evanescence album, you can obviously tell that David and Ben have a real passion for music and that big kind of background. And I have a big voice <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> music to match it, so it was a real dream team." ...|$|E
500|$|MIT {{students}} counterpranked the Lobby 7 dome to read [...] "The Only Institute of Technology", and had {{to resort}} to pulling the blimp down using helium balloons covered in sticky tape. One student unsuccessfully attempted to DDOS the Caltech students' website documenting the pranks. The pranks were seen as a way to merge Caltech and MIT's independent but similar pranking cultures. Campus Preview Weekend was chosen because the Caltech students would blend in with the unfamiliar prospective freshmen, and to increase the pranks' visibility. MIT Dean of Admissions Marilee Jones said, [...] "I think it's hilarious. I consider hacks a performance art, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> concept of inter-institute rivalry." ...|$|E
5000|$|Dear Tommy Tucker, I loved {{all of your}} dresses <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> {{wedding dress}} best of all. Letter from schoolgirl ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was a {{pleasure}} to me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> way he listened. I could have talked {{a long time to}} such a listener; he was so quiet, so intense; he drank it all in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To be sure <b>I</b> does--I <b>like</b> <b>the</b> capt'in--och, he's a jontleman-- <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>likes</b> <b>the</b> missus; she's a laddy--and <b>I</b> <b>likes</b> Miss Beuly, who's a swate young woman--and then there's Miss Maud, who's {{the delight}} of my eyes. Fegs, but isn't she a crathure to relish!" ...|$|R
500|$|... "Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)" [...] {{became one}} of Harrison's most popular songs, both from his years with the Beatles and from his {{subsequent}} solo career. On release, McCartney described it as [...] "very nice", adding: [...] "The guitar solo is ace <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> time changes." [...] Billboard magazine's reviewer wrote: [...] "Harrison's voice and sweet, country tinged guitar work within a rippling but controlled rhythm base, lends itself to this plea for human understanding. His sincere sound engulfs the listener and brings [...] into the story." [...] In Rolling Stone, Stephen Holden lauded the song for its [...] "strong, short-phrased melody whose lyrics are sheer exhortation", {{and said that the}} single was [...] "every bit as good as 'My Sweet Lord'".|$|E
500|$|David Duchovny was {{somewhat}} {{disappointed with the}} episode, hoping {{he would have had}} a chance to do more in an episode that was primarily a symbolic journey for him rather than a real one. The actor said [...] "I like the psychology, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> thinking that went into the episode as a viewer. As an actor, I felt like an opportunity passed me by. If I had to do any episode over again, it would be that one." [...] The actor called the episode in 1995 the greatest missed opportunity they had. Chris Carter disagreed, stating that Fox Mulder's role in the episode was the right way to do it, and that the dramatic weight for the episode had to shift from Mulder to Dana Scully.|$|E
500|$|Lytle {{also noted}} that he was likely to record a new Grandaddy album, stating, [...] "It's {{probably}} going to happen.... If anyone knows anything about Grandaddy, they realise that my [...] music and Grandaddy's music is slightly interchangeable. I think if I were to focus on making a Grandaddy record [...] a full-blown Grandaddy record, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> idea of that. I'd like {{to give it a}} shot." [...] In early 2013, Lytle elaborated: [...] "I love the idea of making another Grandaddy record, but I wouldn't want it hanging over my head like 'Okay, you made this record, now are you guys going {{to get out there and}} tour in support of it?'... I'm hoping for this dream scenario where I can make Grandaddy records every so often and not have all this messy stuff that goes along with it. I already did that and it's just not appealing to me any more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>liked</b> England greatly, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> English, but <b>I</b> {{could not}} <b>like</b> <b>the</b> theory of their civilization or the aristocratic {{structure}} of their society. It {{seemed to me}} iniquitous, for we believe that inequality and iniquity are {{the same in the}} last analysis." ...|$|R
50|$|Those {{first few}} months were about the happiest ones I think I've ever spent in journalism. <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> people <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> city. There {{was sort of a}} lull in the air raid war so you had the {{excitement}} of being in a war area without any real danger.|$|R
60|$|This sounded all right. Goodness knows I am no snob, and can rough it when required, but <b>I</b> do <b>like</b> comfort when {{it comes}} my way, {{and it seemed to}} me that this was where <b>I</b> got it. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> boy. He was the right sort.|$|R
500|$|Tom Baker found filming in Paris to {{be a very}} {{different}} experience to what he was used to in the UK where crowds would gather to watch the filming and meet the stars. Doctor Who was not shown in France at the time and so the cast and crew were largely ignored. Lalla Ward found City of Death the most challenging Doctor Who serial she worked on but was pleased with the final outcome, saying, [...] "We had to film loads of scenes in the rain and cold... there was no glamour in it at all... it was different from the ordinary stories too <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> finished result". Seeing her costumes as an important part in creating the role of Romana, Ward clashed with costume designer Doreen James, rejecting the silver catsuit James had designed for her for the story. Ward {{came up with the idea}} for the schoolgirl costume she wore in conjunction with Baker, recalling, [...] "I thought it would be fun to wear something that little girls probably hated wearing because it might cheer them up... I didn't bank on the fact that I'd also get loads of letters from their fathers saying 'Cool School uniform!'".|$|E
2500|$|Goodman {{enjoyed the}} bebop and cool jazz that was {{beginning}} to arrive in the 1940s. When he heard Thelonious Monk, a celebrated pianist and accompanist to bop players Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie and Kenny Clarke, he remarked, [...] "I like it, I like that very much. I like the piece <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> way he played it. ... I think he's {{got a sense of}} humor and he's got some good things there." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1905, Yale {{sought to}} recruit Fitzpatrick to return {{once again to}} that school. [...] At the time, one paper wrote: [...] "It is no {{exaggeration to say that}} today Fitzpatrick stands head and {{shoulders}} over every trainer in the country, just as Yost outshines rival football coaches. [...] And without Fitzpatrick, Yost could not produce the winning football teams he does." [...] A team from Yale visited Fitzpatrick in June 1905 but left Ann Arbor with the report that it was [...] "impossible to get Keene away from Michigan." [...] It was said: [...] "Keene is located there, with everything pleasant and just as he wants it, and they say they won't let him go and he says he can't come. [...] So Yale must give up hoping for him." [...] Fitzpatrick {{declined to comment on the}} offers and said, [...] "Ann Arbor is a good place to live in <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Michigan spirit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have not}} read any but this,' said Phyllis. 'Ada <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have often looked at <b>the</b> pictures, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> poor wounded stag {{coming down to}} the water so much, that I read about it, <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> went on. Was it wrong, Claude? no one ever told me not.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>liked</b> that speech; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> cool, decided way {{in which}} it was uttered. It denoted, in its spirit, a man who saw things as they are, and who was not afraid to say what he thought about them. My uncle Ro was surprised, and that agreeably, too, and he turned to Miller to pursue the discourse.|$|R
5000|$|... "It’s about {{turbulent}} {{relationships and}} feeling alone {{even if you}} are with somebody. It’s playing off the Lone Ranger and his relationship with Tonto. The fact that he’s the Lone Ranger despite - well, he’s always been with Tonto. I always thought that was funny and a bit weird. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> language: Yippeekayay <b>and</b> Hiyo Silver and Kemosabe." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{intensely}} religious Gordon {{had been}} born into the Church of England, but he never quite trusted the Anglian Church, instead preferring his own personal brand of Protestantism. In his worn out state, Gordon {{had some sort of}} religious rebirth, leading him to write to his sister Augusta: [...] "Through the workings of Christ in my body by His Body and Blood, the medicine worked. Ever since the realization of the sacrament, I have been turned upside down". The eccentric Gordon was very religious, but he departed from Christian orthodoxy on a number of points. Gordon believed in reincarnation. In 1877, he wrote in a letter: [...] "This life is only {{one of a series of}} lives which our incarnated part has lived. I have little doubt of our having pre-existed; and that also in the time of our pre-existence we were actively employed. So, therefore, I believe in our active employment in a future life, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> thought." [...] Gordon was an ardent Christian cosmologist, who also believed that the Garden of Eden was on the island of Praslin in the Seychelles. Gordon believed that God's throne from which He governed the universe rested upon the earth, which was further surrounded by the firmament.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's easy enough, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> idea, I'm aching for {{something}} to do, that is, some new amusement, you know," [...] added Jo quickly.|$|E
6000|$|... "No--not {{particularly}} pretty. But I {{like her}} body. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> fresh air. I like the fresh air, the summer sea-air all through it--through her as well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{first thing}} I {{observed}} {{was that a}} Scotchman and two boys came on board with violins and a flageolet, and began to play to amuse the company. At first I could not hear very well, the steampipe made such a noise. Afterwards, when the pipe stopped blowing off the steam, I could hear better, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> music very well.|$|R
5000|$|... "It {{was kind}} of fuzz," [...] said Reynolds of the film. [...] "It was made by one of those hot shot TV directors. <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> working with Jack Weston; it began our relationship. <b>I</b> did <b>like</b> working again with Raquel. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> writer whose book the film was based on, Ed McBain, The 87th Precinct. I'd like to direct one of his books." ...|$|R
5000|$|... 「妻子好合， 如鼓琴瑟。」 [...] "The {{love between}} mother <b>and</b> child; <b>Is</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> {{strumming}} of qin and se..." [...] 164 ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, madam," [...] said Frank, [...] "some {{one must}} {{look after the}} fires, you know, else London would be in ashes in a few months; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> work." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{like the}} {{softness}} of your gown, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> fur against your throat and neck, and I like those buckles on your shoes, {{and the way you}} do your hair." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; I like my nice Captain. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> waiters. They {{would take}} me to the Crystal Palace--only they're always busy. I wish it was bedtime; I don't {{know what to do with}} myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well;--I did. I {{thought about}} it a good deal, my lady. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> idea of it very much." [...] Lizzie pricked up her ears. In spite of all his harshness, {{could it be that}} he should be the Corsair still? [...] "I am a rambling, uneasy, ill-to-do sort of man; but still I {{thought about it}}. You are pretty, you know,--uncommonly pretty." ...|$|R
5000|$|Axworthy took {{leave from}} the FCO in 2000 and in 2005 he {{resigned}} his position. He has said: [...] I thought that the FCO would be challenging, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> idea of living abroad. I was right about that — but the FCO also {{taught me how to}} write, which was a bonus. But ultimately I wanted to write books, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was never entirely at ease in a large, hierarchical organisation.|$|R
5000|$|Chae Shi-ra reprised {{the role}} of Queen Insoo; she {{previously}} played the same character in the 1998-2000 period drama The King and the Queen, also written by Jung Ha-yeon. She said she joined the series {{because she wanted to}} explore the character further, [...] "This drama series focuses more on the ambitious side of Queen Insoo, who dreams of becoming the absolute ruler of <b>the</b> Joseon Dynasty, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> part." ...|$|R
6000|$|He went on quietly. [...] "Sure! Me mind's made up. You {{want the}} garden <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> porch; so 'phone the agent after dinner, and we'll {{go up and}} see to it this very afternoon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Lottie, [...] "pretty well. I {{like to see}} {{the sailors}} climb up the masts and rigging; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> cabins, {{because there are so many}} sofas in them, and so many places to hide." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{pleasant}} here, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> sun," [...] she explained. [...] "Besides, it's still a {{good way}} to the top, and I generally feel discontented when I get there. There are other peaks much higher--one wants to go on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We had no children," [...] {{said the}} man. [...] "My own folks were dead, but I {{contrived}} to see Derrick now and then. My {{wife had been}} very fond of him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> lad. Once or twice when I went up to London he insisted on making a fuss over me--took me to his chambers and his club, though I believe I was in several ways not exactly a credit to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, only women--two of 'em, {{and very}} nice they was too. One fat and short, the other tall <b>and</b> thin. <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> fat one best." ...|$|R
6000|$|But--please--Is {{the bread}} as brown {{as it used}} to be? I think you're cosseting me up {{altogether}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>like</b> <b>the</b> white bread so well! ...|$|R
