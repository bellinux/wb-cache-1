5|$|As one of {{the larger}} towns in the French Basque Country, Bayonne had been {{one of the}} main bases of ETA {{organisation}} there. From 1975 onwards this had prompted <b>a</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>from</b> anti-ETA groups. In April 1975, Mugalde, a Basque bookshop in the town, was bombed, though no one was injured. On 25 June 1979, Enrique Gómez Álvarez, an alleged ETA member, was killed by the Batallón Vasco Español (BVE), a right-wing paramilitary group active since 1975.|$|E
5|$|This appeal caused <b>a</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>from</b> the {{opposition}} forces: Odobescu rallied {{to the cause}} of conservatives, and, on July 1, 1848, together with his fellow officers Ioan Solomon and Grigorie Lăcusteanu, arrested the entire Government. The coup almost succeeded, being ultimately overturned by the reaction of Bucharesters, who organized street resistance against mutinied troops, mounted barricades, and, eventually, stormed into the executive's headquarters. The latter assault, led by Ana Ipătescu, resulted in the arrest of all coup leaders.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{treatment}} {{is needed in}} a case of a severe allergic reaction. Before calling for help, laying a person down and elevating the legs is suggested. Depending on a patients needs, they will be given an EpiPen or an Anapen to use in case they are stung. In a scenario of experiencing anaphylaxis, further doses of adrenaline and intravenous infusions may be required. Some with severe anaphylaxis may suffer cardiac arrest and will need resuscitation. Inhalers may additionally be used in case a victim has asthma and experiences <b>a</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>from</b> a sting. The use of ACE inhibitors is not recommended, as it is known to increase the risk of anaphylaxis. Medications like antihistamines, H2 blockers, corticosteroids and anti-leukotrienes have no effect on anaphylaxis.|$|E

5|$|On June 9, 1832, {{between two}} attacks that {{occurred}} at Fort Blue Mounds, {{a party of}} Native Americans crossed over from {{the west side of}} the Mississippi River near Galena. The group continued up the Apple River, looting and stealing horses along the way, including an incident about ¾ of the way up the Apple River in which about a dozen horses were stolen from a small stockade. The Sauk raiding parties were mostly stealing food and supplies for Black Hawk's band of 1,000 men, women and children which were camped in the marshes of southwestern Wisconsin. A similar incident a few days later, though without injury or death, prompted <b>a</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>from</b> the white militia in the area.|$|E
5|$|Tangled Ever After is set {{six months}} after the events of the {{original}} movie. In the short, Pascal and Maximus are ring bearers at Rapunzel and Flynn Rider's wedding. When Maximus suffers <b>a</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>from</b> one of the flower petals Pascal is sprinkling along the aisle, Maximus sneezes and the rings are propelled off the pillow on which he is carrying the rings; the fly through a window in the chapel and into the city streets. Pascal and Maximus discreetly sneak out of the chapel to retrieve them in time for Rapunzel and Flynn to exchange them. Pascal and Maximus encounter several obstacles and hindrances in their attempt, eventually crashing into a tar factor upon retrieving the rings from a flock of flying doves. Completely soiled, Pascal and Maximus finally return to the chapel and return the rings, only to cause the wedding cake to roll out the door.|$|E
5|$|Although {{unknown to}} the Australians at the time, the earlier attack on Lang Phuoc Hai had been a {{deliberate}} attempt by the Viet Cong to provoke <b>a</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>from</b> 1 ATF. As such {{there would be no}} withdrawal on this occasion. Anticipating that any relief force would move by road, the Viet Cong had subsequently established an extensive ambush in the buildings alongside Route 44, which led into the village itself. Although the presence of this trap was not detected by the Australians, Murphy's evasion had ensured that his APCs had avoided it, moving the infantry by a cross-country route instead. However, with C Company delayed as a result, A Company made their airmobile assault onto an unsecured landing zone at 13:45, supported only by indirect fire from the artillery at Dat Do in suppression, which was initially limited due to delay in setting up the fire support base. Under the command of Major Owen O'Brien, A Company then began to advance into the fringe of thick rainforest to secure the southern edge of the landing zone for the arrival of B Company and the remainder of the battalion. Finally, over 30 minutes after the lead company had flown in, the APCs began to receive sniper fire as they neared the landing zone.|$|E

5|$|The MCC team which toured Australia {{under the}} {{captaincy}} of Arthur Gilligan in 1924–25 lost the Test series 4–1, but critics thought the winning margin flattered the host country. Between {{them in the}} Test matches, Hobbs and Sutcliffe scored seven centuries and shared four opening partnerships which passed 100 runs. Hobbs began the tour well, and scored consistently in the matches before the Tests. In the first Test, in reply to Australia's first innings of 450, Hobbs and Sutcliffe opened with 157 runs. Hobbs went on to his seventh century against Australia, beating the previous record number in England-Australia Tests by Victor Trumper. Australia eventually set England a target of 605 runs. Hobbs and Sutcliffe shared their second century opening partnership of the game, but England lost by 193 runs. During the match, Hobbs became the leading run-scorer in Test cricket, passing the previous record of 3,412 runs set by Clem Hill in 1912. In the second Test, Australia scored 600 during the opening two days. In reply, Hobbs and Sutcliffe batted throughout the third day without being separated, scoring 283. They concentrated on defence but both men reached centuries, and the press praised their achievements. Even so, Australia won the game by 81 runs, and {{in the aftermath of}} the defeat, Cecil Parkin, a former Test bowler and vocal critic of Gilligan's captaincy, wrote a newspaper article suggesting that Hobbs should assume the leadership of the side. This suggestion provoked <b>a</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>from</b> Lord Hawke—"Pray God, no professional will ever captain England"—and subsequent press debate over the idea of Hobbs as captain. In reality, Hobbs had no desire to captain England.|$|E
5|$|The {{second half}} of extra time began with yet another chance for Manchester United, this time {{constructed}} from a Giggs break down the left wing, but Van Nistelrooy failed {{in his attempt to}} back-heel Giggs' cross into the goal and the opportunity was wasted. Five minutes into the second half, Reyes committed another late tackle on Silvestre, for which he received a final warning from referee Styles. Reyes himself was then the victim of a late tackle by Scholes, who was shown a yellow card. The match threatened to descend into a mass brawl soon after, when Fortune caught Ljungberg in the face with a flailing arm and then committed a high tackle on Edu, provoking <b>a</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>from</b> the Arsenal players. A shoulder-charge by Rooney on Cole resulted in an Arsenal free kick on the left wing; Van Persie swung the ball over and it was only cleared as far as Ljungberg, but the Swede struck a shot with his shin and the ball spun wide. With a couple of minutes left in the extra period, Manchester United won a free kick on the left corner of the Arsenal penalty area when Vieira lazily tripped Ronaldo and received a booking, but Giggs' cross from the free kick was headed away. Meanwhile, Manchester United's substitute goalkeeper, Howard, was seen warming up behind the goal, suggesting that he was preparing to come on for Carroll {{in the event of a}} penalty shootout; however, no substitution was made.|$|E

Consequently, SNS users perceive they are giving too much social support to other SNS friends. This dark side of SNS usage is called 'social overload'. It {{is caused by the}} extent of usage, number of friends, subjective social support norms, and type of relationship (online-only vs offline friends) while age has only an indirect effect. The psychological and behavioral consequences of social overload include perceptions of SNS exhaustion, low user satisfaction, and high intentions to reduce or stop using SNS.|$|E
25|$|Drusilla {{tries to}} find Caligula a wife among the priestesses of the goddess Isis, the cult they {{secretly}} practice. Caligula wants to marry Drusilla, but she insists they cannot marry because she is his sister. Instead, Caligula marries Caesonia, a priestess and notorious courtesan after she bears him an heir. Drusilla reluctantly supports their marriage. Meanwhile, despite Caligula's popularity with the masses, the Senate expresses disapproval for what initially seem to be light eccentricities. Darker aspects of Caligula's personality emerge when he rapes a bride and groom on their wedding day in a minor fit of jealousy and orders Gemellus's execution to provoke <b>a</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>from</b> Drusilla.|$|E
25|$|In general terms, {{the free}} energy change (ΔG) of a {{reaction}} determines whether a chemical change will take place, but kinetics describes {{how fast the}} reaction is.

If a reactant can produce two different products, the thermodynamically most stable one will in general form, except in special circumstances when the reaction {{is said to be}} under kinetic reaction control. The CurtinHammett principle applies when determining the product ratio for two reactants interconverting rapidly, each going to a different product.

25|$|Given {{that the}} American plan for waging the Laotian Civil War was a {{defensive}} one, the American ambassador had {{run counter to}} policy by approving an offensive drive.

The short notice request for additional USAF tactical air support had brought about a directive on 18 August that requests for tactical air support for a planned operation had to be submitted at least ten days in advance. In reality, the process would take 20 to 30 days. The directive, issued by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and agreed to by both the CIA and the State Department, required coordination of planned operations with both 7th Air Force and CINCPAC.

25|$|After the Second World War, Croatia {{become part}} of the Communist governed Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. At first, President marshal Josip Broz Tito tried to break the centuries-long link between Croatia and the Holy See by {{offering}} Archbishop Stepinac a Croatian national church but Stepinac refused, which eventually resulted in attacks on the bishops in the summer of 1952. Pope Pius XII, wishing to pay tribute to archbishop Stepinac for his faithfulness, elevated him to the College of Cardinals in 1953 which triggered <b>a</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>from</b> the Government. SFR Yugoslavia cut diplomatic relations with the Holy See, accusing it of interfering in internal state affairs. Stepinac was put on trial and eventually found guilty for his cooperation with the Nazi occupiers during the WWII. The Holy See reacted by excommunicating President Tito and some other officials who participated in the trial.|$|E
25|$|The US Ambassador Cameron Munter {{found it}} {{difficult}} to counter the Anti-American sentiment in the country, especially after the Raymond Davis incident. The Anti-Americanism sentiment in Pakistan is one of the strongest in the world. The Anti-Americanism has risen as a result of U.S. military drone strikes introduced by President George W. Bush and continued by President Barack Obama as his counter-terrorism policy. As of present, almost 60%–80% of Pakistanis consider the United States as an enemy combatant state. The Anti-Americanism has been provoked mainly as <b>a</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>from</b> those who are critical of American CIA activities in Pakistan, such as the infamous break-out of the Raymond Allen Davis incident and American intrusions from Afghanistan border such as the 2011 NATO attack in Pakistan. The credibility of Obama administration was undermined in the country and, furthermore, approximately 4 in 10 Pakistanis believe that U.S. military and economic aid is having a negative impact on their country; only 1 in 10 believes the impact has been positive. In 2010, Pakistan purchased 1,000 laser-guided bomb kits and 18 F-16 fighter jets from the US.|$|E

After various fights and reversals of alliances, Bertrand du Guesclin entered in 1373, but the situation did not improve. Abandoned and ravaged by pillaging, the population of Fougères requested assistance from the Duchy of Brittany and the town rejoined it in 1428, sold by John II of Alençon. However, in 1449, a man named François de Surienne, an Aragonese mercenary {{in the service of}} the English, captured and sacked the town, with the aim of forcing Brittany to ally with England. There were many massacres, which caused <b>a</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>from</b> Francis I, Duke of Brittany, determined to get rid of the English. The Duke of Brittany allied with Charles VII of France, attacked the south of Normandy, and laid siege to Fougères. Surienne and his men were however able to resist and surrendered on condition of walking free. This episode announced the Battle of Formigny. Finally, the French general La Trémoille seized Fougères in 1488, during the Mad War.|$|E
25|$|The {{fall of the}} Kalabhras around 500CE saw <b>a</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>from</b> the {{thus far}} {{suppressed}} Hindus. The Kalabhras were replaced by the Pandyas {{in the south and}} by the Pallavas in the north. Even with the exit of the Kalabhras, the Jain and Buddhist influence still remained in Tamil Nadu. The early Pandya and the Pallava kings were followers of these faiths. The Hindu reaction to this apparent decline of their religion was growing and reached its peak during the later part of the 7th century. There was a widespread Hindu revival during which a huge body of Saiva and Vaishnava literature was created. Many Saiva Nayanmars and Vaishnava Alvars provided a great stimulus to the growth of popular devotional literature. Karaikkal Ammaiyar who lived in the 6th century CE was the earliest of these Nayanmars. The celebrated Saiva hymnists Sundaramoorthy, Thirugnana Sambanthar and Thirunavukkarasar (also known as Appar) were of this period. Of Appar's verses 3066 have survived. Sambandar sang 4,169 verses. Together these form the first six books of the Saiva canon, collected by Nambi Andar Nambi in the 10th century. Sundarar wrote Tiruttondartokai which gives the list of sixty-two Nayanmars. This was later elaborated by Sekkilar in his Periyapuranam(4,272 verses). Manikkavasagar, who lived around the 8th century CE was a minister in the Pandya court. His Tiruvasakam consisting of over 600 verses is noted for its passionate devotion.. These Saivite Hymns collectively called Thirumurai (திருமுறை) is described as SIXTH VEDA next to Bhagavath Geetha in Hindu Tradition.|$|E
