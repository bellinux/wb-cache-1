We consider OBS networks where {{the size of the}} data bursts varies and the link distance between two <b>adjacent</b> <b>network</b> elements also varies depending on the network’s topology.

Our solution to this problem has two parts. First, we develop a queueing network model that accurately portrays the simultaneous link possession scenario. Next, we develop a fast single-node decomposition algorithm to compute the burst loss probabilities in the network. Our algorithm extends the link-decomposition method from teletraffic theory by allowing the dynamic simultaneous link possession. We use simulation to validate the high accuracy of our algorithm. ...|$|R
