5|$|The {{discipline}} of <b>anatomy</b> can be subdivided {{into a number}} of branches including gross or macroscopic <b>anatomy</b> and microscopic <b>anatomy.</b> Gross <b>anatomy</b> is the study of structures large enough to be seen with the naked eye, and also includes superficial <b>anatomy</b> or surface <b>anatomy,</b> the study by sight of the external body features. Microscopic <b>anatomy</b> is the study of structures on a microscopic scale, including histology (the study of tissues), and embryology (the study of an organism in its immature condition).|$|E
5|$|The {{discipline}} of <b>anatomy</b> {{is divided into}} macroscopic and microscopic <b>anatomy.</b> Macroscopic <b>anatomy,</b> or gross <b>anatomy,</b> is the examination of an animal's body parts using unaided eyesight. Gross <b>anatomy</b> also includes the branch of superficial <b>anatomy.</b> Microscopic <b>anatomy</b> {{involves the use of}} optical instruments {{in the study of the}} tissues of various structures, known as histology, and also in the study of cells.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{students}} of certain biological sciences, paramedics, prosthetists and orthotists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, nurses, podiatrists, and medical students learn gross <b>anatomy</b> and microscopic <b>anatomy</b> from anatomical models, skeletons, textbooks, diagrams, photographs, lectures and tutorials, and in addition, medical students generally also learn gross <b>anatomy</b> through practical experience of dissection and inspection of cadavers. The study of microscopic <b>anatomy</b> (or histology) can be aided by practical experience examining histological preparations (or slides) under a microscope.|$|E

5|$|Human <b>anatomy,</b> {{physiology}} and biochemistry are complementary basic medical sciences, which are generally taught to medical {{students in their}} first year at medical school. Human <b>anatomy</b> can be taught regionally or systemically; that is, respectively, studying <b>anatomy</b> by bodily regions such as the head and chest, or studying by specific systems, such as the nervous or respiratory systems. The major <b>anatomy</b> textbook, Gray's <b>Anatomy,</b> has been reorganized from a systems format to a regional format, in line with modern teaching methods. A thorough working knowledge of <b>anatomy</b> is required by physicians, especially surgeons and doctors working in some diagnostic specialties, such as histopathology and radiology.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Anatomy</b> Museum was {{a museum}} {{situated}} on the 6th floor of the King's Building at the Strand Campus. The <b>Anatomy</b> Theatre was built {{next door to the}} museum in 1927, where anatomical dissections and demonstrations took place. The <b>Anatomy</b> Museum's collection includes casts of injuries, leather models, skins of various animals from Western Australia donated to the museum in 1846, and casts of heads of John Bishop and Thomas Williams, the murderers in the Italian Boy's murder in 1831. The last dissection in the <b>Anatomy</b> Theatre was performed in 1997. The <b>Anatomy</b> Theatre and Museum was renovated and refurbished in 2009, and is now a facility for teaching, research and performance at King's.|$|E

5|$|Dental <b>anatomy</b> is a {{field of}} <b>anatomy</b> {{dedicated}} {{to the study of}} tooth structure. The development, appearance, and classification of teeth fall within its field of study, though dental occlusion, or contact between teeth, does not. Dental <b>anatomy</b> is also a taxonomic science as it is concerned with the naming of teeth and their structures. This information serves a practical purpose for dentists, enabling them to easily identify teeth and structures during treatment.|$|E

ABC Video on demand also releases recent episodes of the show for temporary viewing. Recent episodes are also available at ABC's official Grey's <b>Anatomy</b> website, and on Hulu and Xfinity.

5|$|In the 2nd century, Galen of Pergamum, an anatomist, clinician, {{writer and}} philosopher, wrote the final and highly {{influential}} <b>anatomy</b> treatise of ancient times. He compiled existing knowledge and studied <b>anatomy</b> through dissection of animals. He {{was one of}} the first experimental physiologists through his vivisection experiments on animals. Galen's drawings, based mostly on dog <b>anatomy,</b> became effectively the only anatomical textbook for the next thousand years. His work was known to Renaissance doctors only through Islamic Golden Age medicine until it was translated from the Greek some time in the 15th century.|$|E

5|$|Superficial or surface <b>anatomy</b> is {{important}} as the study of anatomical landmarks that can be readily seen from the exterior contours of the body.

50|$|IDD is {{not used}} instead of other {{incremental}} models, but rather as an enhancement that will make those models more efficient. One obstacle when using IDD is to create the integration plan - the definition of what to develop and integrate at a given time. One way that has proven successful is to use System <b>Anatomies</b> for original planning and Integration <b>Anatomies</b> for re-planning and follow-up.Since all planning will require time and resources IDD may be considered unnecessary for development with low complexity {{of the system and}} organization (i.e., small teams developing small systems).|$|R
