5000|$|Since {{clearance}} {{lost time}} {{is often not}} observable since observation requires that some vehicles which were waiting {{at the start of}} a green phase still be waiting when the green phase ends, it is typically determined through the equation , where [...] is the clearance lost time, [...] is the yellow time, [...] is the <b>all-red</b> <b>interval</b> time during which the traffic signal is red for all directions, and [...] is the portion of the yellow and all-red times during which vehicles are illegally in the intersection and has a default value of 2.0 seconds in HCM. ALDOT’s Traffic Signal Design Guide and Timing Manual, on the other hand, determines clearance lost time to be half of the yellow interval plus the entire <b>all-red</b> <b>interval.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} reported is {{an evaluation}} of all-red clearance intervals as {{the second phase of}} a project involving traffic signal operation. The first phase of the project dealt with leading versus lagging left turn signal phasing. The study analyzed both the short-term and long-term effects of <b>all-red</b> <b>interval</b> on accident rates in Indiana using accident records for the years 1981 to 1987. The results contradict those of previous studies. Statistical tests indicated that all-red clearance intervals did not cause a reduction in accident rates at the intersections studied in Indiana...|$|E
40|$|Red Light Running (RLR) {{has become}} an increasely major {{national}} safety issue at signalized intersections. Significant efforts {{have been made to}} understand the RLR related driver behaviors and develop countermeasures to reduce RLR and its related crashes. At high speed intersections, it has been well shown that drivers caught in the dilemma zone is an important reason of RLR. While at arterial intersections, there are still needs to further investigate into RLR related driver behaviors. We carried out our research at a well-designed arterial intersection (speed limit 35 mph to 30 mph, approach dependent) and collected data using multiple discrete point sensors at different distances-to-intersection from multiple approaches. Empirical data showed that for over 90 % of the RLRs, the drivers were not trapped in dilemma zone at yellow onset. Instead, they could have stopped safely and comfortably. Further analysis of the empirical data showed that over 60 % of the RLR were with a headway less than 2 seconds, or belonged to a platoon. The average headway of RLR vehicles were 5 % − 10 % less than that of vehicles going through yellow. The findings were used in the development of an <b>all-red</b> <b>interval</b> extension system for intersection collision avoidance...|$|E
40|$|Yellow and <b>all-red</b> <b>intervals</b> are {{intended}} as a margin of safety. The duration of change intervals needed for safe stopping or crossing of vehicles {{is not the same}} for all traffic conditions and patterns. Thus some traffic patterns may not need the full designed intervals’ durations as a safety margin; while at other times, they are not sufficient due mainly to drivers trying to avoid to stop at red lights. The challenge for traffic engineers is to minimize the intersection delay {{and at the same time}} maximize intersection safety. A methodology for providing variable length yellow and <b>all-red</b> <b>intervals,</b> based on traffic responsive sensors and logical commands, is outlined. The methodology stresses that safety is improved at some cases over the designed fixed yellow and <b>all-red</b> <b>intervals,</b> but never compromised lower than the default fixed yellow and <b>all-red</b> <b>intervals.</b> In addition, delay is reduced for various traffic patterns. Adhering to traffic agencies standards and regulations is addressed, not only to outline the practical limitations, but also to introduce discussion for potential positive change...|$|R
50|$|In 2016, the {{monetary}} fine for a red-light running (RLR) traffic violation varies widely in the U.S., {{with a fine}} of $50 in North Carolina {{and as much as}} $490 in California. Currently, a scientific method for determining {{the monetary}} fine based on the safety impacts associated with such violations does not exist, thereby causing disparities in fine structures. Baratian-Ghorghi et al. developed a novel fine structure for RLR traffic violations based upon the estimated economic impact of potential crashes by RLR violations and estimated delays caused by providing <b>all-red</b> <b>intervals</b> to prevent potential conflicts. They proposed that a $38 traffic ticket be issued for drivers who ran a red light within 2.9 seconds. The amount of RLR fine, then, increases up to $234 at 4.6 second into the onset of the red signal and thereafter.|$|R
40|$|This report {{addresses}} {{an important}} need for fundamental understanding of bicycle-automobile mixed-traffic. It presents models of (1) gap acceptance behavior and (2) bicyclist behavior {{at the onset}} of a yellow traffic signal indication, in addition to analysis of (3) coordinating traffic signals to provide (simultaneous) progression for both bicycles and automobiles. Fundamental insights into mixed-traffic behavior are derived and applied to selected problems in mixed-traffic engineering and operations. Discrete choice (probit) models are developed for both motorist and cyclist gap acceptance behavior. An important fundamental insight from these models is that both cyclists and motorists (on average) require a longer gap when the gap is closed by a large vehicle (e. g. bus), and both will accept a shorter gap when the gap is closed by a bicycle, relative to a gap closed by a passenger car. A methodology for determining and adequate clearance interval (normally consisting of part yellow change and part <b>all-red</b> clearance <b>intervals)</b> for bicycles is developed from a deterministic model based on kenemati...|$|R
