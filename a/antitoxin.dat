5|$|Another example {{application}} involves {{both the}} CcdB toxin and CcdA <b>antitoxin.</b> CcdB {{is found in}} recombinant bacterial genomes and an inactivated version of CcdA is inserted into a linearised plasmid vector. A short extra sequence {{is added to the}} gene of interest that activates the <b>antitoxin</b> when the insertion occurs. This method ensures orientation-specific gene insertion.|$|E
5|$|Toxin-antitoxin {{systems are}} {{typically}} classified {{according to how}} the <b>antitoxin</b> neutralises the toxin. In a Type I toxin-antitoxin system, the translation of messenger RNA (mRNA) that encodes the toxin is inhibited by the binding of a small non-coding RNA <b>antitoxin</b> to the mRNA. The protein toxin in a type II system is inhibited post-translationally by the binding of another protein <b>antitoxin.</b> A single example of Type III toxin-antitoxin system has been described whereby a protein toxin is bound directly by an RNA molecule. Toxin-antitoxin genes are often transferred through horizontal gene transfer and are associated with pathogenic bacteria, having been found on plasmids conferring antibiotic resistance and virulence.|$|E
5|$|Type I systems {{sometimes}} {{include a}} third component. In {{the case of}} the well-characterised hok/sok system, in addition to the hok toxin and sok <b>antitoxin,</b> there is a third gene, called mok. This open reading frame almost entirely overlaps that of the toxin, and the translation of the toxin is dependent on the translation of this third component. Thus the binding of <b>antitoxin</b> to toxin is sometimes a simplification, and the <b>antitoxin</b> in fact binds a third RNA, which then affects toxin translation.|$|E

5|$|Unlike the {{aforementioned}} toxin-antitoxin systems, DarTG {{is a type}} II system where both the toxin and the <b>antitoxin</b> have enzymatic activity. The DarG <b>antitoxin</b> does not inhibit the DarT toxin, which modifies DNA by ADP-ribosylating specific sequence motifs, but instead removes the toxic modification caused by the toxin.|$|E
5|$|Type I toxin-antitoxin systems {{rely on the}} base-pairing of {{complementary}} <b>antitoxin</b> RNA {{with the}} toxin's mRNA. Translation of the mRNA is then inhibited either by degradation via RNase III or by occluding the Shine-Dalgarno sequence or ribosome binding site. Often the toxin and <b>antitoxin</b> are encoded on opposite strands of DNA. The 5' or 3' overlapping region between the two genes is the area involved in complementary base-pairing, usually with between 19–23 contiguous base pairs.|$|E
5|$|Type II {{systems are}} {{organised}} in operons with the <b>antitoxin</b> protein typically being located upstream of the toxin. The <b>antitoxin</b> inhibits the toxin by downregulating its expression. The proteins are typically around 100 amino acids in length, and exhibit toxicity {{in a number}} of ways: CcdB protein, for example, affects DNA gyrase by poisoning DNA topoisomerase II whereas MazF protein is a toxic endoribonuclease that cleaves cellular mRNAs at specific sequence motifs. The most common toxic activity is the protein acting as an endonuclease, also known as an interferase.|$|E

5|$|Emil von Behring and Kitasato Shibasaburō {{discovered}} in 1890 that diphtheria and tetanus toxins were neutralized {{in the bloodstream}} of animals by substances they called <b>antitoxins,</b> which were specific for the respective toxin. Behring received the first Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their find in 1901. A year after the discovery, Paul Ehrlich used the term antibodies (German Antikörper) for these <b>antitoxins.</b>|$|R
5|$|It {{has also}} been {{proposed}} that chromosomal copies of plasmid toxin-antitoxin systems may serve as anti-addiction modules– a method of omitting a plasmid from progeny without suffering {{the effects of the}} toxin. An example of this is an <b>antitoxin</b> on the Erwinia chrysanthemi genome that counteracts the toxic activity of an F plasmid toxin counterpart.|$|E
5|$|Type II toxin-antitoxin {{systems are}} {{generally}} better-understood than type I. In this system a labile protein <b>antitoxin</b> tightly binds and inhibits {{the activity of}} a stable toxin. The largest family of type II toxin-antitoxin systems is vapBC, which has been found through bioinformatics searches to represent between 37 and 42% of all predicted type II loci.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Polyacrylamide gel disc {{electrophoresis}} of concentrated culture media {{which had}} supported growth of Clostridium botulinum types A and B {{was shown to}} be effective in separating the toxin molecules from hemagglutinating molecules.

The electrophoretic separation and elution of the toxins is observed as a possible means for future preparation of non-cross-reacting <b>antitoxins.</b> The combination of a double-diffusion agar precipitin screening test applied to toxin-containing media and an immunoelectrophoretic toxin detection system demonstrates that the presence and identity of a botulinal toxin in a substrate can be determined in vitro.

5|$|A third protein can {{sometimes}} be involved in type II toxin-antitoxin systems. In {{the case of the}} aforementioned MazEF addiction module, in addition to the toxin and <b>antitoxin</b> there is a regulatory protein involved called MazG. MazG protein interacts with E. colis Era GTPase and is described as a 'nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase,' which hydrolyses nucleoside triphosphates to monophosphates. Later research showed that MazG is transcribed in the same polycistronic mRNA as MazE and MazF, and that MazG bound the MazF toxin to further inhibit its activity.|$|E
5|$|A toxin-antitoxin {{system is}} a set of two or more closely linked genes that {{together}} encode both a protein 'poison' and a corresponding 'antidote'. When these systems are contained on plasmids– transferable genetic elements– they ensure that only the daughter cells that inherit the plasmid survive after cell division. If the plasmid is absent in a daughter cell, the unstable <b>antitoxin</b> is degraded and the stable toxic protein kills the new cell; this is known as 'post-segregational killing' (PSK). Toxin-antitoxin systems are widely distributed in prokaryotes, and organisms often have them in multiple copies.|$|E
5|$|At {{this time}} though the {{chemical}} {{nature of what}} exactly in the blood conferred this protection was not known. In a few decades to follow, it was shown that the protective serum could neutralize and precipitate toxins, and clump bacteria. All these functions were attributed to different substances in the serum, and named accordingly as <b>antitoxin,</b> precipitin and agglutinin. That all the three substances were one entity (gamma globulins) was demonstrated by Elvin A. Kabat in 1939. In the preceding year Kabat had demonstrated the heterogeneity of antibodies through ultracentrifugation studies of horses' sera.|$|E

5|$|The Swedish Academy {{chose the}} poet Sully Prudhomme {{for the first}} Nobel Prize in Literature. A group {{including}} 42 Swedish writers, artists, and literary critics protested against this decision, having expected Leo Tolstoy to be awarded. Some, including Burton Feldman, have criticised this prize because they consider Prudhomme a mediocre poet. Feldman's explanation {{is that most of}} the Academy members preferred Victorian literature and thus selected a Victorian poet. The first Physiology or Medicine Prize went to the German physiologist and microbiologist Emil von Behring. During the 1890s, von Behring developed an <b>antitoxin</b> to treat diphtheria, which until then was causing thousands of deaths each year.|$|E
5|$|Type III toxin-antitoxin systems rely {{on direct}} {{interaction}} between a toxic protein and an RNA <b>antitoxin.</b> The toxic {{effects of the}} protein are neutralised by the RNA gene. One example is the ToxIN system from the bacterial plant pathogen Erwinia carotovora. The toxic ToxN protein is approximately 170 amino acids long and {{has been shown to}} be toxic to E. coli. The toxic activity of ToxN is inhibited by ToxI RNA, an RNA with 5.5 direct repeats of a 36 nucleotide motif (AGGTGATTTGCTACCTTTAAGTGCAGCTAGAAATTC). Crystallographic analysis of ToxIN has found that ToxN inhibition requires the formation of a trimeric ToxIN complex, whereby three ToxI monomers bind three ToxN monomers; the complex is held together by extensive protein-RNA interactions.|$|E
5|$|In her research, Fraser worked {{predominantly}} in infectious disease, studying general infection, puerperal fever, {{scarlet fever}} and septic sore throat among other bacterial infections. She began studies on scarlet fever {{in the early}} 1930s, and along with Dr. Helen Plummer isolated the precipitin present in the strains of streptococci {{likely to lead to}} disease. These findings were important in determining the types of antitoxins which might be employed for immunization to neutralize the disease. The type of research Fraser was engaged in required that the bacteria of the disease which created a toxin be isolated, so that it could be injected into a horse. Repeated injections of small doses of toxin allowed the horse to become immune to the disease. The serum created from the blood of animals which had been immunized, contained an antibody (known at the time as an <b>antitoxin),</b> which could then be injected into humans to cure the disease. Development of the sulfonamides rendered immunization against scarlet fever unnecessary, but she continued to study other aspects of the disease. In 1941, she typed the streptococci of scarlet fever which was an important breakthrough for tracking the epidemiology of the disease. Fraser also conducted research in an attempt to develop an antigen for tuberculosis. With the development of penicillin, her research after 1947, shifted focus to the study of antibiotics including bacitracin, penicillin, polymixin, and subtilin. Fraser studied various preparations of penicillin against the tubercular bacillus and as a treatment for gonorrhoea. Rising through the ranks of assistant professor and associate professor, Fraser became a full professor in 1949 teaching preventative medicine for the Bachelor of Science or nursing degree for the remainder of her career. In 1955 Fraser was appointed as a professor of microbiology and held that post until her retirement a decade later.|$|E

40|$|Programmed {{cell death}} in {{bacteria}} is generally associated with two-component toxin-antitoxin systems. The SpoIISABC system, originally identified in Bacillus subtilis, {{consists of three}} components: a SpoIISA toxin and the SpoIISB and SpoIISC <b>antitoxins.</b> SpoIISA is a membrane-bound protein, while SpoIISB and SpoIISC are small cytosolic <b>antitoxins,</b> which are able to bind SpoIISA and neutralize its toxicity. In the presented bioinformatics analysis, a taxonomic distribution of the genes of the SpoIISABC system is investigated; their conserved regions and residues are identified; and their phylogenetic relationships are inferred. The SpoIISABC system {{is part of the}} core genome in members of the Bacillus genus of the Firmicutes phylum. Its presence in some non-bacillus species is likely the result of horizontal gene transfer.

25|$|In adults, {{botulism}} can {{be treated}} by passive immunization with a horse-derived <b>antitoxin,</b> which blocks {{the action of the}} toxin circulating in the blood. A trivalent <b>antitoxin</b> containing antibodies raised against botulinum toxin types A, B, and E is used most commonly, however a heptavalent botulism <b>antitoxin</b> has also been developed and was approved by the U.S. FDA in 2013. In infants, horse-derived <b>antitoxin</b> is sometimes avoided for fear of infants developing serum sickness or lasting hypersensitivity to horse-derived proteins. To avoid this, a human-derived <b>antitoxin</b> has been developed and approved by the U.S. FDA in 2003 for the treatment of infant botulism. This human-derived <b>antitoxin</b> {{has been shown to be}} both safe and effective for the treatment of infant botulism.

25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Emil von Behring {{isolated}} the diphtheria toxin and demonstrated its effects in guinea pigs.

40|$|Toxin–antitoxin systems (TAs) are {{ubiquitous}} among {{bacteria and}} {{play a crucial role}} in the dissemination and evolution of antibiotic resistance, such as maintaining multi-resistant plasmids and inducing persistence formation.
