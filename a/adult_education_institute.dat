40|$|This {{article focuses}} of the {{development}} and growth of complementary therapies provision, which began to accelerate from 1995 in universities. However, the first mainstream providers were Further and <b>Adult</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Institutes</b> and prior to this, private colleges. Compared to a decade ago when there were less than five such UK university courses, today there are around 100. The article also discusses course structures; comprehensive clinical experience in institutes like the University of Westminster; the importance of professional bodies and postgraduate course and research. The author also looks at the international dimension of degrees, saying {{that the majority of}} international applicants to such UK university courses come from the EEC. However, the catchments of courses frequently include North America, South Africa, Australia and Japan. The reputation of UK university provision has also developed through university staff exchanges with overseas institutions and visits to UK universities by Government, university and college delegations from North and South America, China, the Middle East, Africa, Australia and Europe. The National Library of Health, Complementary and Alternative Medicine Specialist Library is also said to provide the best available evidence of the effectiveness of therapies.

40|$|Abstract: This study {{investigates the}} {{situation}} and practices of <b>adult</b> <b>education</b> in Turkey in terms of (a) participants, (b) providers, and (c) program areas. The data were derived from published statistical data and one-to-one interaction with <b>adult</b> <b>education</b> providers when such data are unavailable. Turkey {{has a long tradition}} of <b>adult</b> <b>education</b> with established <b>institutes</b> and program areas. The Ministry of National Education (MoNE) is the main responsible body and 32 institutions provide <b>adult</b> <b>education</b> on a regular basis. The findings generally revealed young adults (ages 23 - 44) benefited most from <b>adult</b> <b>education,</b> more than half of participants are male, and the percentages of low-literate and literate individuals and 5 -year elementary school graduates participating in <b>adult</b> <b>education</b> were less than the respective percentages in the whole population...|$|R
40|$|In {{the recent}} years, relying on {{industries}} (systems) and regions (communities), Beijing (independently created) state-owned <b>adult</b> higher <b>education</b> <b>institutes</b> (Beijing AHEI) have promoted the reforms of <b>adult</b> higher <b>education</b> and now continued {{to improve the}} quality of <b>adult</b> <b>education.</b> Beijing AHEI established continuing education systems that appeared as multi-formats, the programs were delivered through multi-channels at multi-levels, which created social and cultural learning programs for regional working adults in Beijing. These multi-complex continuing edu-cation systems were designed to meet with the needs of working adults and tightly linked with the development of capital economic and society, which improved the professional quality of entire scientific and technological commu-nity of China. These continuing educational programs trained thousands of applicable talents who then contributed to the development of China’s capital economics and the advancement of the society. It shows clearly that Beijing adult colleges have played a dispensable role in establishing a learning-orientated society and life-long learning en-vironment. This paper includes three sections: 1) <b>Adult</b> higher <b>education</b> plays one of the key roles in popularizing universal higher education in Beijing; 2) Developing continuing education to promote a learning-orientated society of capital Beijing; and 3) Conclusions and considerations. The experiences of Beijing adult colleges in developing continuing education will be discussed in this paper...|$|R

5000|$|Through Hill, Henrietta met Canon Samuel Barnett, {{then the}} curate of St Mary's, Bryanston Square. They married in 1873. The newlyweds soon {{moved to the}} impoverished Whitechapel parish of St Jude's, intent on {{improving}} social conditions. Henrietta continued her parish visiting activities, {{with a focus on}} women and children, including the more than 2000 prostitutes then active in Whitechapel alone. In 1875, Henrietta became a woman guardian for the parish, and the following year was named a school manager for the Poor Law district schools in Forest Gate. Another social initiative which the Barnetts helped set up was the Metropolitan Association for Befriending Young Servants (1876), with Jane Senior; the organisation aimed to prevent girls from becoming prostitutes, criminals or alcoholics, and provided domestic servants. [...] The Barnetts' experiment in sending slum children for country holidays grew into the Children's Fresh Air Mission (Off to the Country), established in 1877, becoming the Children's Country Holidays Fund in 1884. Henrietta Barnett promoted Homes for Workhouse Girls starting in 1880, and founded the London Pupil Teachers Association in 1891. She also served as vice-president of the National Association for the Welfare of the Feeble-Minded (1895) and National Union of Women Workers (1895-96).In 1884, the Barnetts established (and began living at) Toynbee Hall, a pioneering university settlement named after the recently deceased distinguished historian Arnold Toynbee, who had advocated education of the working classes and reduction of the division between social classes. In 1897 annual loan exhibitions of fine art began at the nearby Whitechapel Gallery through the Barnetts' efforts. In 1903 Richard Tawney began working with them, the Children's Country Holiday Fund, and the Workers' Educational Association. William Beveridge and Clement Attlee also worked with the Barnetts as they started their own careers. A visit to Toynbee Hall inspired Jane Addams to found Hull House in Chicago.In 1889 the activist couple acquired a weekend home at Spaniard's End in the Hampstead area of north-west London. The Barnetts became inspired by Ebenezer Howard and the model housing development movement (then exemplified by Letchworth garden city), as well as protecting part of nearby Hampstead Heath from development by Eton College. In 1904, they established trusts which bought 243 acres of land along the newly opened Northern line extension to Golders Green. This became the Hampstead Garden Suburb, a model garden city developed through their efforts and those of architects Raymond Unwin and Sir Edwin Lutyens and which ultimately grew to encompass over 800 acres. In 1909, an <b>adult</b> <b>education</b> <b>institute</b> opened {{in the middle of the}} new Hampstead Garden Suburb, with cultural programmes and discussion groups. Soon a school for girls was established and named the Henrietta Barnett School.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a scale of attitudes of whites towards blacks and blacks towards whites, {{constructed}} using Guttmann's methods of facet analysis. The source of the scale was the finding by the National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders and other researchers {{that there was a}} consistent hierarchy of grievances in every major city surveyed. These grievances are believed to be strongly related to the attitudes held by blacks and whites in relation to each other. Using this information and the suggestions from personnel of the Urban <b>Adult</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Institute</b> and the Foundation for Racial Equality in Memory of Martin Luther King, Jr., in Detroit, scales were constructed dealing with seven attitude content areas identified as being of crucial importance for interracial interaction. These scales and other psychological measures were then administered to two populations of college students. The final composite scale was found useful for assessing racial attitudes. Additionally, it was found that a person's racial attitudes could be predicted. [Because of size of the print, tables 3 and 8 may not be clearly readable in hard copy reproduction. ] (JM) tr C...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this {{research}} study is to consider the role of music in <b>adult</b> <b>education</b> {{as part of a}} continuing lifelong process. It looks into the personal aims and needs of adult non-vocational music students in the Greater London area, and makes recommendations for the years that lie immediately ahead. VOLUME ONE Part I presents an historical background of music education for the People. The research includes evidence of a previously unknown instrument invented by Sarah Glover and used for educational purposes in the nineteenth century (see published article). Nineteenth and twentieth century pioneers of music education have been chosen to emphasise the significance of - The People's Sight Singing i'lovement, The Choral Ii[ovement and The r• usic Appreciation Movement. VOLUJYIE ONE Part II is concerned with 'The Practice - Present and Future'. It seeks to relate the philosophy and psychology of teaching music to adult stUdents. VOLU?• 1 E TWO is the empirical research where statistics, facts, figures and opinions are studied and resented in depth. It includes the 'findings' from over 2, 150 three paged questionnaires and evaluates them. One distribution was made to students in the large music departDents of three London Literary Institutes. Another was carried out in a selected nQtloer of ILEA <b>Adult</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Institutes.</b> An overall evaluation has been made from the total information collected. CONCLUSIONS: 'Frinciples and RecoTIJl!lendations for the 1980 's', arise from the overall research. eco nendatlons are made for future planning of adult music classes, advisory services and special proVision for retired students. Attention is drawn to the professional status required of music tutors, the need for structured teaching, integration of classes and the size of teaching groups. Suggestions are made regarding classes linked to H. E., varied course lengths and paid study leave. Information has been 'fed back' to the field through regular meetings, discussions and published articles. It is hoped that the research may offer some practical suggestions both in the short term and in the long term planning for a continuing and life-long <b>adult</b> music <b>education.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|As {{we prepare}} {{to go to}} press with this issue of CALPROgress, it seems fitting {{to reflect on the}} past six years of CALPRO {{services}} to the California <b>adult</b> <b>education</b> community. In 2001, CALPRO was launched with the goal of developing and conducting professional development that fosters research-based practices in <b>adult</b> <b>education.</b> Have we met our goal? We began with the <b>Adult</b> <b>Education</b> Leadership <b>Institute,</b> modifying sessions to include a research basis so that administrators who attend the institute could benefit from the latest research on administrative practices. As a result, participants receive research articles and attend presentations on topics such as the administrator as instructional leader, enhancing learner retention, using data to make programmatic decisions, community asset mapping, and many others. The first issue of CALPROgress in 2002 included a research-based article about professional development; this is a tradition we have continued with each subsequent edition of the newsletter. We also began researching, writing, and producing research digests, summaries, and bibliographies on topics of interest to adult educators. With the four most recent digests on research-based reading instruction, we have produced 11 research publications. In addition, we have developed and published guidelines for facilitating discussion groups using these research publications. In 2004, we began a new professional development model: study circles...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background People {{with low}} {{literacy}} and low health literacy have poorer health outcomes. Literacy and health literacy are distinct but overlapping constructs that impact wellbeing. Interventions that target both could improve health outcomes. Methods/design This is a cluster {{randomised controlled trial}} with a qualitative component. Participants are 300 adults enrolled in basic language, literacy and numeracy programs at adult education colleges across New South Wales, Australia. Each <b>adult</b> <b>education</b> <b>institute</b> (regional administrative centre) contributes (at least) two classes matched for student demographics, which {{may be at the}} same or different campuses. Classes (clusters) are randomly allocated to receive either the health literacy intervention (an 18 -week program with health knowledge and skills embedded in language, literacy, and numeracy training (LLN)), or the standard Language Literacy and Numeracy (LLN) program (usual LLN classes, specifically excluding health content). The primary outcome is functional health literacy skills – knowing how to use a thermometer, and read and interpret food and medicine labels. The secondary outcomes are self-reported confidence, more advanced health literacy skills; shared decision making skills, patient activation, health knowledge and self-reported health behaviour. Data is collected at baseline, and immediately and 6  months post intervention. A sample of participating teachers, students, and community health workers will be interviewed in-depth about their experiences with the program to better understand implementation issues and to strengthen the potential for scaling up the program. Discussion Outcomes will provide evidence regarding real-world implementation of a health literacy training program with health worker involvement in an Australian adult education setting. The evaluation trial will provide insight into translating and scaling up health literacy education for vulnerable populations with low literacy.
