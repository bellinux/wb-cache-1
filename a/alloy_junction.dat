Significantly, a multiplet structure is observed in the XMCD spectra that indicates a degree of localization of the moments and may result from the half-metallic ferromagnetism (HMF) in the alloy. The magnitude of this multiplet structure appears to vary with preparation conditions and could be utilized to ascertain the role of the constituent atoms in producing the HMF, and to examine methods for preserving the half-metallic state after barrier preparation.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{possibility}} of enhancing the efficiency of thin film solar cells by including periodic material nonhomogeneities in combination with periodically corrugated back reflectors. Two different types of solar cell are investigated; p-i-n junctions solar cells made from alloys of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) (containing either carbon or germanium), and Schottky barrier junction solar cells made from alloys of indium gallium nitride (InξGa 1 -ξN). Material nonhomogeneities are produced by varying the fractions of the constituent elements of the alloys. For example, by varying the content of carbon or germanium in the a-Si:H alloys, semiconductors with bandgaps ranging from 1 : 3 eV to 1 : 95 eV can be produced. Changing the bandgap alters both the optical and electrical properties of the material so this necessitates the use of coupled optical and electrical models. To date, the majority of solar cell simulations either prioritise the electrical portion of the simulation or they prioritise the optical portion of the simulation. In this thesis, a coupled optoelectronic model, developed using COMSOL Multiphysics®, was used to simulate solar cells: a two-dimensional finite-element optical model, which solved Maxwell's equations throughout the solar cells, was {{used to calculate the}} absorption of incident sunlight; and a finite-element electrical drift-diffusion transport model, either one- or two-dimensional depending on the symmetries of the problem, was used to calculate the steady state current densities throughout the solar cells under external voltage biases.

The main prospective expected is an increasing in system integration and power capabilities. The Diamonix project concerns the elaboration of a single-crystal diamond substrate with electronic quality and its associated packaging. The designed structure has to resist to temperatures varying between - 50 °C and + 300 °C. This paper deals with an experimental and numerical study of the diamond die attach solution. The development of a packaging for diamond component relies in particular on a specific choice of solder’s <b>alloys</b> for the <b>junction</b> die/substrate. To carry out this junction, AuGe and AlSi eutectic alloys were chosen and characterized; the choice of these two kinds of solders i. e. AuGe and AlSi is motivated by the practical elaboration process and the restrictions of hazardous substances (RoHS). The first solder has a melting temperature of 356 °C; the second has a higher melting point of 577 °C. In this paper, we present some numerical results obtained from FE simulations of two 2 D configurations of simplified electronic packaging. The power electronic packaging is composed of a diamond die and a copper metallized Si 3 N 4 ceramic substrate which are brazed together with either AuGe or AlSi solder alloy. To predict the thermomechanical behavior of the solders, a particular constitutive behavior law was implemented as a User MATerial subroutine which is based on a viscoplastic unified McDowell formulation, coupled with porous damage equations. The mechanical law can describe precisely the viscoplastic damage phenomenon of solder subjected to high thermal cycling and to optimize the thermo-mechanical modeling for advanced package developmen...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development and}} testing of NbN/MgO/NbN tunnel junctions for use as superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) mixers. SIS mixers are the most sensitive heterodyne detectors in the millimeter wavelength region. Most SIS mixers use Pb <b>alloy</b> tunnel <b>junction.</b> These tunnel junctions have several {{problems associated with the}} soft nature of Pb and its low superconducting transition temperature. NbN-based tunnel junctions are being developed to overcome these difficulties. These devices are intended to be used as mixers at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths. This thesis {{describes the}} fabrication process involved in making NbN junctions, and the results of measurements on these devices. The purpose of these measurements is to determine the future possibilities of NbN tunnel junctions as high-frequency mixers. The first chapter is an introduction to SIS mixers and explains how tunnel junction properties affect mixer performance. The basic theory of tunneling and mixing in SIS mixers is first presented. A description of quantum mixer theory is included in this presentation. This theory makes several interesting predictions that cannot be explained using classical theories. This is followed by a description of how real SIS tunnel junctions differ from ideal junctions. The physical origin of these differences is discussed, along with how they affect SIS mixer performance. Finally, {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the various superconducting materials available are discussed. The decision to develop NbN devices is based on these material properties. The second chapter describes the methods used to fabricate small-area NbN/MgO/NbN tunnel junctions. The chapter begins with a description of the various methods that have been used to deposit NbN films. Reactive magnetron sputtering is chosen as the best method for tunnel junction fabrication. Details on the vacuum systems and the methods used for depositing superconducting NbN are discussed. Next, the process used for depositing junction trilayers (NbN/MgO/NbN) is described. The probable growth mode of MgO on NbN is presented. The importance of this growth mode to the junction quality is explained in some detail. Next, standard junction processing steps are reported. The details and limitations of each step are put forth. The standard process allows for the fabrication of 1 [square micron] tunnel junctions. Finally, this chapter discusses several methods of fabaricating submicron junctions that are being pursued. The status of this work is given. The third chapter describes the characterization of NbN films and NbN/Mg 0 /NbN tunnel junctions. Film properties are described first. The correlation of these properties to deposition conditions is discussed in some detail. Next, values for the various features of the I-V characteristic are given; typical and exceptional values are noted. How these features limit mixer results is described in detail. Several important device attributes were measured using superconducting-quantum-interference-devices (SQUIDs). These attributes are the junction's specific capacitance and the film's magnetic penetration depth. The theory and results of measuring specific capacitance and penetration depth are presented. Following the SQUID results is a large section on RP testing. Mixer tests were made at 205 GHz. The receiver design used, integral inductive tuning circuit used and results are discussed. These results are well understood, with the exception of the temperature dependence of the mixer performance. Finally, measurements of the uniformity of many junctions on a single wafer are presented. The importance of junction uniformity is also described. The final chapter discusses the ultimate limits on NbN mixers, and tells what future work must be done to achieve these limits. The primary high-frequency limit on NbN junctions is the capacitance of NbN/MgO/NbN junctions. The limit imposed by the junction capacitance and circuits used to tune out this capacitance are discussed. Also, the low-frequency limits on NbN junctions are discussed. The status of submicron devices is presented. Junction area is the most immediate limitation on NbN mixer results. The possibility of using other barrier materials to increase the RC speed of NbN junctions is presented. Finally, the possibility of operating NbN junctions at temperatures above 4. 2 K is discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{failure of}} two {{transistors}} in the Altitude Switch Assembly for the Solid Rocket Booster {{followed by two}} additional failures a year later presented a challenge to failure analysts. These devices had successfully worked for many years on numerous missions. There was no history of failures {{with this type of}} device. Extensive checks of the test procedures gave no indication for a source of the cause. The devices were manufactured more than twenty years ago and failure information on this lot date code was not readily available. External visual exam, radiography, PEID, and leak testing were performed with nominal results Electrical testing indicated nearly identical base-emitter and base-collector characteristics (both forward and reverse) with a low resistance short emitter to collector. These characteristics are indicative of a classic failure mechanism called punchthrough. In failure analysis punchthrough refers to an condition where a relatively low voltage pulse causes the device to conduct very hard producing localized areas of thermal runaway or "hot spots". At {{one or more of these}} hot spots, the excessive currents melt the silicon. Heavily doped emitter material diffuses through the base region to the collector forming a diffusion pipe shorting the emitter to base to collector. Upon cooling, an <b>alloy</b> <b>junction</b> forms between the pipe and the base region. Generally, the hot spot (punch-through site) is under the bond and no surface artifact is visible. The devices were delidded and the internal structures were examined microscopically. The gold emitter lead was melted on one device, but others had anomalies in the metallization around the in-tact emitter bonds. The SEM examination confirmed some anomalies to be cosmetic defects while other anomalies were artifacts of the punchthrough site. Subsequent to these analyses, the contractor determined that some irregular testing procedures occurred at the time of the failures heretofore unreported. These testing irregularities involved the use of a breakout box and were the likely cause of the failures. There was no evidence to suggest a generic failure mechanism was responsible for the failure of these transistors...|$|E
