5|$|Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski {{was one of}} the {{greatest}} theorists of political thought in Renaissance Europe. His most famous work, On the Improvement of the Commonwealth, was published in Kraków in 1551. Modrzewski criticized the feudal societal relations and proposed broad realistic reforms. He postulated that all social classes should be subjected to the law to the same degree, and wanted to moderate the existing inequities. Modrzewski, an influential and often translated <b>author,</b> <b>was</b> a passionate proponent of peaceful resolution of international conflicts. Bishop Wawrzyniec Goślicki (Goslicius), who wrote and published in 1568 a study entitled De optimo senatore (The Counsellor in the 1598 English translation), was another popular and influential in the West political thinker.|$|E
5|$|Carson {{first met}} Dorothy Freeman in the Summer of 1953 in Southport Island, Maine.

Their relationship was conducted mainly through letters, and during summers spent together in Maine. Over the course of 12 years, they would exchange somewhere in the region of 900 letters. Many of these were published in the book Always, Rachel, published in 1995 by Beacon Press.|$|E

5|$|For {{the film}} {{adaptation}} of The Van, Doyle and Myles formed their own production company, Deadly Films, and the <b>author</b> <b>was</b> given creative {{control over the}} selection of its cast and director. Frears returned as director, and Meaney was cast in the lead role. Although The Van (1996) premiered at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival to some favorable reviews, critical reaction was negative upon release; reviewers criticized the film for its thin material and lack of strong characterization.|$|E
5|$|Giovanni Verga's 1871 novel Storia di una capinera, {{according}} to its <b>author,</b> <b>was</b> inspired by {{a story of a}} blackcap trapped and caged by children. The bird, silent and pining for its lost freedom, eventually dies. In the book, a nun evacuated from her convent by cholera {{falls in love with a}} family friend, only to have to return to her confinement when the disease wanes. The novel was adapted as films of the same name in 1917, 1943 and 1993. The last version was directed by Franco Zeffirelli, and its English-language version was retitled as Sparrow. In Saint François d'Assise, an opera by Messiaen, the orchestration is based on bird song. St Francis himself is represented by the blackcap.|$|E
5|$|Other {{theories}} include André Chastagnol's minimalist {{opinion that}} the <b>author</b> <b>was</b> a pagan who supported the Senate and the Roman aristocracy and scorned the lower classes and the barbarian races, while François Paschoud proposed that the last books of the History are in fact a type of alternative historical narrative, with events and the personalities of recent 4th century emperors woven {{into the fabric of}} a series of 3rd century emperors. According to Paschoud, the representation of the emperor Probus is in fact a version of Julian, with Carus substituting for Valentinian I and Carinus for Gratian.|$|E

5|$|Peter Bogdanovich, whose The Last Picture Show {{impressed}} McQueen {{and producer}} David Foster, was originally hired {{as the director}} of The Getaway.

Creative differences ensued between Thompson and McQueen and the <b>author</b> <b>was</b> fired along with Bogdanovichthey were replaced with Hill and Peckinpah. Principal photography commenced on February 7, 1972, on location in Texas. During production, McQueen and MacGraw began an affair, and McQueen and Peckinpah were involved in heated arguments due to the latter's increasing alcohol intake. Originally scored by Peckinpah collaborator Jerry Fielding, McQueen became unimpressed with Fielding's soundtrack and, at his behest, hired Quincy Jones to rescore it. Jones was later nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score for his work.|$|E
5|$|Sitti Nurbaya: Kasih Tak Sampai (Sitti Nurbaya: Unrealized Love, often {{abbreviated}} Sitti Nurbaya or Siti Nurbaya; original spelling Sitti Noerbaja) is an Indonesian {{novel by}} Marah Rusli. It {{was published by}} Balai Pustaka, the state-owned publisher and literary bureau of the Dutch East Indies, in 1922. The <b>author</b> <b>was</b> influenced by the cultures of the west Sumatran Minangkabau and the Dutch colonials, who had controlled Indonesia in various forms since the 17th century. Another influence {{may have been a}} negative experience within the author's family; after he had chosen a Sundanese woman to be his wife, Rusli's family brought him back to Padang and forced him to marry a Minangkabau woman chosen for him.|$|E

5|$|The {{credence}} {{given to}} the reports was such that Pope Alexander III {{sent a letter to}} Prester John via his physician Philip on September 27, 1177. Nothing more is recorded of Philip, but it is most probable that he did not return with word from Prester John. The Letter continued to circulate, accruing more embellishments with each copy. In modern times, textual analysis of the letter's variant Hebrew versions has suggested an origin among the Jews of northern Italy or Languedoc: several Italian words remained in the Hebrew texts. At any rate, the Letters <b>author</b> <b>was</b> most likely a Westerner, though his or her purpose remains unclear.|$|E
5|$|The first Halo book, , {{sold more}} than 1,000,000 copies and {{prompted}} an extended agreement between Del Rey Books and Microsoft to produce more Halo novels. William C.

5|$|The most {{important}} sources {{used by the}} evangelist were the Jewish scriptures (the Tanakh, more or less identical with the Christian Old Testament), probably in the Greek translation. John quotes from them directly, references important figures from them, and uses narratives from them {{as the basis for}} several of the discourses. But the <b>author</b> <b>was</b> also familiar with non-Jewish sources: the Logos of the prologue (the Word that is with God from the beginning of creation) derives from both the Jewish concept of Lady Wisdom and from the Greek philosophers, while John 6 alludes not only to the exodus but also to Greco-Roman mystery cults, while John 4 alludes to Samaritan messianic beliefs.|$|E
