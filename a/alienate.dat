5|$|Although the U.S. {{command in}} Saigon and the {{politicians}} in Washington became increasingly aware of this arrangement during 19661967, they declined to overtly interfere due to the political ramifications of conducting military operations against a neutral country and the wishes of Sihanouk.

5|$|Beebe {{described}} his religious beliefs {{as a combination}} of Presbyterianism and Buddhism. His religion was largely the result of seeking to combine his sense of awe and wonder at the natural world with a scientific understanding of its workings. He was highly critical of efforts to use science to justify political ideologies, such as socialism or the belief that women were inferior to men. Beebe also disapproved of the eugenic ideas advocated by many biologists in the early 20th century, including some of his contemporaries at the zoo, although this was largely {{out of fear that}} these ideas would <b>alienate</b> friends of the zoo and cause divisions among its staff.|$|E

50|$|As the {{convention}} developed, however, {{it was revealed}} that Seward, Chase, and Bates had each <b>alienated</b> factions of the Republican Party. Delegates were concerned that Seward was too closely identified with the radical wing of the party, and his moves toward the center had <b>alienated</b> the radicals. Chase, a former Democrat, had <b>alienated</b> many of the former Whigs by his coalition with the Democrats in the late 1840s. He had also opposed tariffs demanded by Pennsylvania, and critically, had opposition from his own delegation from Ohio. Bates outlined his positions on the extension of slavery into the territories and equal constitutional rights for all citizens, positions that <b>alienated</b> his supporters in the border states and Southern conservatives. German Americans in the party opposed Bates because of his past association with the Know Nothings.|$|R
40|$|Forty {{adults who}} were <b>alienated</b> from a parent {{as a child}} participated in a {{qualitative}} research study about their experience. A content analysis {{was conducted on the}} transcripts and a comparison was undertaken to identify similarities between <b>alienating</b> parents and cult leaders. Results revealed that adults whose parents <b>alienated</b> them from their other parent described the <b>alienating</b> parent much the way former cult members describe cult leaders. The <b>alienating</b> parents were described as narcissistic and requiring excessive devotion and loyalty, especially {{at the expense of the}} targeted parent. The <b>alienating</b> parents also were found to utilize many of the same emotional manipulation and persuasion techniques cult leaders use to heighten dependency on them. And, finally, the <b>alienating</b> parents seemed to benefit from the alienation much the way cult leaders benefit from the cult: they have excessive control, power, and adulation. Likewise, the participants reported many of the same negative outcomes that former cult members experience such as low self-esteem, guilt, depression, and lack of trust in themselves and others. These findings can provide a useful framework for conceptualizing the experience of parental alienation and should also be useful for therapists who provide counseling and treatment to adults who experienced alienation as a child. Each year approximately one million couples divorce. Many of these divorces involve children. Research has consistently shown that children whose parents divorce suffer emotionally and psychologically, especially when the divorce is contentious and the children are exposed to ongoing conflict between their parents (e. g. ...|$|R

He {{let it be known that}} if he recovered he would be willing to serve as a member of a Home cabinet. He had earlier favoured Hailsham, but changed his mind when he learned from the British ambassador to the US that the Kennedy administration was uneasy at the prospect of Hailsham as Prime Minister, and from his chief whip that Hailsham, seen as a right-winger, would <b>alienate</b> moderate voters.|$|E

He {{did not want to}} <b>alienate</b> them, and sought their undivided support by avoiding ideological alliances. However, to establish the groundwork for Fatah's future financial support, he enlisted contributions from the many wealthy Palestinians working in Kuwait and other Arab states of the Persian Gulf, such as Qatar (where he met Mahmoud Abbas in 1961). These businessmen and oil workers contributed generously to the Fatah organization. Arafat continued this process in other Arab countries, such as Libya and Syria.|$|E

Conrad and Port eventually left their positions at Teen Vogue after receiving employment from Kelly Cutrone's PR firm People's Revolution. By {{the end of the}} season, Conrad and Patridge had moved out of their apartment and purchased a home, with new housemate Bosworth becoming a distancing factor between the former two.|$|E

For example, vampires and werewolves are recurring enemies in the game, but other existing enemies include trolls, giant spiders and goblin-like creatures. The enemies can be defeated for experience points, which can be used to purchase combos or to augment the player's abilities further. Lords of Shadow has large-scale bosses known as titans. The Combat Cross can be used to grapple onto their bodies and navigate them, and break the runes that animate the titan.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{conceived}} by Watanabe {{as an extension}} of his work on the television series, which he treated as a series of miniature films. So as not to <b>alienate</b> fans of the series, a large amount of aesthetic material was incorporated, while also adjusting it to make it accessible to newcomers. Increased budget and production facilities enabled the use of filming styles associated with live action films and a higher animation quality than the series. Arabic thematic elements were incorporated to contrast against the series, which entailed Watanabe traveling to Morocco for research. The Arabic atmosphere was also used in Kanno's music.|$|E
5|$|After the {{conflict}} ended, Themistocles continued his pre-eminence among Athenian politicians. However, he aroused the hostility of Sparta by ordering the re-fortification of Athens, and his perceived arrogance began to <b>alienate</b> {{him from the}} Athenians. In 472 or 471BC, he was ostracised, and went into exile in Argos. The Spartans now saw an opportunity to destroy Themistocles, and implicated him in the alleged treasonous plot of 478 BC of their own general Pausanias. Themistocles thus fled from Greece. Alexander I of Macedon (reigned 498-454 BC) temporarily gave him sanctuary at Pydna before he traveled to Asia Minor, where he entered {{the service of the}} Persian king Artaxerxes I (reigned 465-424 BC). He was made governor of Magnesia, and lived there {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E

5|$|Buchanan rarely {{consulted}} Breckinridge {{when making}} patronage appointments, and meetings {{between the two}} were infrequent. When Breckinridge and Buchanan endorsed the Lecompton Constitution, which would have admitted Kansas as a slave state instead of allowing the people to vote, they managed to <b>alienate</b> most Northern Democrats, including Douglas. This disagreement ended plans for Breckinridge, Douglas, and Minnesota's Henry Mower Rice to build {{a series of three}} elaborate, conjoined row houses in which to live during their time in Washington, D.C. In November 1857, after Breckinridge found alternative lodging in Washington, he sold a slave woman and her young infant which, according to historian James C. Klotter, probably ended his days as a slaveholder. When Breckinridge did not travel to Illinois to campaign for Douglas's re-election to the Senate and gave him only a lukewarm endorsement, relations between them worsened.|$|E
5|$|China has {{installed}} a grassroots network of officials throughout Xinjiang, its predominantly Muslim north-west frontier region, to address social risks and spot {{early signs of}} unrest: Hundreds of cadres have been transferred from southern Xinjiang, the region’s poorest area, into socially unstable neighbourhoods of Ürümqi; a policy has been implemented where if all family members are unemployed, the government arranges for {{one person in the}} household to get a job,; official announcements are calling upon university students to register for those payouts. The areas around slums are being redeveloped to reduce social risks, opening way to new apartment blocks. However, independent observers believe that fundamental inequalities need to be addressed, and the mindset must change for there to be any success; Ilham Tohti warned that the new policy could attract more Han immigration, and further <b>alienate</b> the Uyghur population.|$|E
5|$|Gaveston's lieutenancy was {{primarily}} {{of a military}} nature; by the early 14th century, Ireland had become a rebellious and unruly dominion for the English crown. In this capacity Gaveston had considerable success, killing or defeating several major insurgents. He fortified the town of Newcastle McKynegan and Castle Kevin, and rebuilt the road from Castle Kevin to Glendalough. This helped pacify the county {{at least as far}} as the Wicklow Mountains, west of Dublin. In the field of administration he made less of a mark. The most notable issue with which he was involved concerned a dispute over murage – a toll on the town walls – between the citizens of Dublin. As during the regency, though, there is no evidence that Gaveston exploited his position for his own advantage and he did nothing to <b>alienate</b> the local elite.|$|E
