5|$|The {{application}} of the Johnson–Corey–Chaykovsky reaction in organic synthesis is diverse. The reaction has come to encompass reactions of many types of sulfur ylides with electrophiles well beyond the original publications. It has seen use {{in a number of}} high-profile total syntheses, <b>as</b> <b>detailed</b> <b>below,</b> and is generally recognized as a powerful transformative tool in the organic repertoire.|$|E

25|$|Leonard George Crawley (26 July 1903 – 9 July 1981) was an English sportsman {{and later}} journalist.

50|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{vertically}} polarized radiation {{is not well}} reflected by the ground except at grazing incidence or over very highly conducting surfaces such as sea water. However the grazing angle reflection important for ground wave propagation, using vertical polarization, is in phase with the direct wave, providing a boost of up to 6 db, <b>as</b> is <b>detailed</b> <b>below.</b>|$|R
25|$|Research {{suggests}} that lobsters may not slow down, weaken, or lose fertility with age, and that older lobsters {{may be more}} fertile than younger lobsters. This does not however make them immortal in the traditional sense, as they are {{significantly more likely to}} die at a shell moult the older they get (<b>as</b> <b>detailed</b> <b>below).</b>|$|E
25|$|Evidently, the {{location}} of the peak of the spectral distribution for Planck's law depends on the choice of spectral variable. Nevertheless, in a manner of speaking, this formula means that the shape of the spectral distribution is independent of temperature, according to Wien's displacement law, <b>as</b> <b>detailed</b> <b>below</b> in the sub-section Percentiles of the section Properties.|$|E
25|$|Indeed, a {{key reason}} for using {{continuous}} compounding is {{to simplify the}} analysis of varying discount rates and to allow one to use the tools of calculus. Further, for interest accrued and capitalized overnight (hence compounded daily), continuous compounding is a close approximation for the actual daily compounding. More sophisticated analysis includes the use of differential equations, <b>as</b> <b>detailed</b> <b>below.</b>|$|E
30|$|Each {{medical school}} should adhere {{as closely as}} {{possible}} to a standard core curriculum for radiology, <b>as</b> described in <b>detail</b> <b>below.</b> This core may be supplemented with additional features as the individual school finds practicable and desirable.|$|R

30|$|We are {{particularly}} interested in the relative effects of institutional vs. non-institutional aspects of decentralization, with the former largely measured by the well-known measure of political constraint and the latter proxied by Hofstede’s cultural variables <b>as</b> described in <b>detail</b> <b>below.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Heisenberg picture {{does not}} {{distinguish}} time from space, {{so it is}} better suited to relativistic theories than the Schrödinger equation. Moreover, the similarity to classical physics is more manifest: the Hamiltonian equations of motion for classical mechanics are recovered by replacing the commutator above by the Poisson bracket (see also below). By the Stone–von Neumann theorem, the Heisenberg picture and the Schrödinger picture must be unitarily equivalent, <b>as</b> <b>detailed</b> <b>below.</b>|$|E
25|$|One scene {{planned for}} the Vancouver {{shooting}} with the Tony character was scrapped; two others were altered to accommodate Ledger's absence, a third was added to plan for Colin Farrell's role in the film, and a fourth, already in the script, had a prop of Farrell in a magazine added. A fifth, with close-ups of Ledger already filmed, scrapped any major dialogue from Tony and used a body and voice double, <b>as</b> <b>detailed</b> <b>below.</b>|$|E
25|$|J. Edgar Hoover {{served as}} FBI Director from 1924 to 1972, a {{combined}} 48 {{years with the}} BOI, DOI, and FBI. He was chiefly responsible for creating the Scientific Crime Detection Laboratory, or the FBI Laboratory, which officially opened in 1932, {{as part of his}} work to professionalize investigations by the government. Hoover was substantially involved in most major cases and projects that the FBI handled during his tenure. But <b>as</b> <b>detailed</b> <b>below,</b> his proved to be a highly controversial tenure as Bureau Director, especially in its later years. After Hoover's death, the Congress passed legislation that limited the tenure of future FBI Directors to ten years.|$|E
30|$|The study {{consisted}} of 2 main groups: a sepsis group and a hemorrhage group. Following the preparation and the induction of sepsis or a hemorrhage <b>as</b> described in <b>detail</b> <b>below,</b> animals were randomized {{with regard to the}} dose of resuscitation fluid.|$|R
25|$|Despite the ostensibly {{high levels}} of tariffs and cost {{recovery}} estimated based on the sample of utilities analyzed, utilities do not generate sufficient revenue to finance a substantial share of their investments internally, or to be credit-worthy enough to mobilize commercial, long-term credit. The reasons include low levels of operational efficiency, <b>as</b> <b>detailed</b> further <b>below,</b> poor recovery of bills, poor procurement practices and political corruption.|$|R
30|$|Our {{data are}} {{consistent}} with the reports of other studies, but we must be cautious for general conclusions because the studies evaluating skills retentions differ significantly in study populations, training and tests programs/models, resting period, scoring systems, coaching and feedback, etc., <b>as</b> discussed in <b>detail</b> <b>below.</b>|$|R
