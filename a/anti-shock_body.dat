2500|$|On 2 September 1947, the P.1040 prototype, VP401, {{sometimes}} referred to as the Hawker N.7/46 after the related naval specification, conducted its maiden flight from RAF Boscome Down, piloted by Bill Humble. Three days later, VP401 flew to Farnborough to continue trials. A month after the first flight, the existence of the P.1040 was revealed to the general public. Early flight trials encountered aerodynamic-related teething problems, such as airframe vibrations and tail buffeting, which led to a redesign of the rear jetpipe fairings and the addition of a bullet-shaped <b>anti-shock</b> <b>body</b> on the tail to correct these issues. Other minor issues were addressed, including high stick forces and windshield distortion; VP401 needed long takeoff runs which were attributed to the [...] "low-thrust" [...] Nene 1. The Nene 2/Mk.101 for production aircraft would have a higher take-off thrust.|$|E
50|$|An <b>anti-shock</b> <b>body</b> (also {{known as}} Whitcomb body or Küchemann carrot) is a pod {{positioned}} {{on the leading}} edge or trailing edge of an aircraft's aerodynamic surfaces to reduce wave drag at transonic speeds (Mach 0.8-1.0).|$|E
50|$|On the Hawker Sea Hawk, the prototypes {{experienced}} high tail drag {{when approaching}} transonic speeds. To resolve this, an <b>anti-shock</b> <b>body</b> was subsequently fitted to {{the leading edge}} of the junction between the vertical fin and tailplane.|$|E
50|$|Application of {{the area}} rule {{can also be seen}} in the use of <b>anti-shock</b> <b>bodies</b> on {{transonic}} aircraft, including some jet airliners. <b>Anti-shock</b> <b>bodies,</b> which are pods along the trailing edges of the wings, serve the same role as the narrow waist fuselage design of other transonic aircraft.|$|R

5000|$|The Convair 990A {{is still}} the fastest non-supersonic {{commercial}} transport to have ever been produced. During May of 1961, one of the pre-production 990 prototype aircraft set a record of [...]97 Mach in level flight {{at an altitude of}} 22,500 ft., equivalent to a true airspeed of 675 mph. [...] This was before the various aerodynamic drag-reduction changes were applied to the later 990A in order to meet certain performance guarantees which Convair had made to American Airlines. These subsequent modifications made to the later 990A (consisting of the four wing-mounted <b>anti-shock</b> <b>body</b> [...] "speed capsules" [...] and substantial streamlining of the engine pylon/wing interface) increased the velocity at which onset of transonic drag would occur by 0.09 Mach. As such, the 990A would have been capable of speeds slightly in excess of 700 mph.|$|E

50|$|Modern Air's {{historic}} {{arrival in}} Moscow was memorable {{for a different}} reason as well. In common with other contemporary jet aircraft types, such as the Boeing 707/720, deHavilland Comet, Douglas DC-8, Sud Aviation Caravelle and Vickers VC-10, Convair's 880/990 lacked an auxiliary power unit (APU). This made the Convair jets dependent on an external ground power unit (GPU) to provide electrical power for the aircraft while stationary on the ground, including starting the engines. When Polar Byrd I needed power externally supplied by a GPU to start its engines {{at the end of the}} stopover in Moscow to resume its journey, it was found that the Soviet GPUs could not be connected to the CV-990s air intake valve due to an incompatibility between the ground equipment's fittings and the aircraft's valve. This necessitated flying in a Modern Air GPU from West Berlin and resulted in the delay of the onward flight. It also resulted in a subsequent collaboration between Modern Air's maintenance department and Garrett AiResearch to design and test a CV-990 APU, which was located in a hollow area behind the fuel tank inside the aircraft's inboard <b>anti-shock</b> <b>body</b> on the starboard wing. This however proved unsuccessful, resulting in the unit's removal after the first installation.|$|E

50|$|Extending flaps often run on guide tracks. Where these run {{outside the}} wing {{structure}} {{they may be}} faired in to streamline them and protect them from damage. Some track fairings are designed to act as <b>anti-shock</b> <b>bodies,</b> which reduce drag caused by local sonic shock waves where the airflow becomes transonic at high speeds.|$|R
50|$|<b>Anti-shock</b> <b>bodies,</b> {{apparently}} {{developed in}} the Soviet Union's TsAGI research institute and serving a dual purpose as undercarriage bogie fairings, were first applied to the Tupolev Tu-16 jet bomber. The Tu-16 flew {{for the first time}} in April 1952 and the bodies were to remain a unique feature of the company's products up to and including the Tupolev Tu-154 designed in the mid-1960s.|$|R
50|$|Most jet airliners have a {{cruising}} speed between Mach 0.8 and 0.85. For aircraft {{operating in the}} transonic regime (Mach 0.8-1.0), wave drag can be minimized by having a cross-sectional area which changes smoothly {{along the length of}} the aircraft. This is known as the area rule, and is the operating principle behind the design of <b>anti-shock</b> <b>bodies.</b> Reducing wave drag improves fuel economy.|$|R
50|$|Modern jet {{aircraft}} use supercritical airfoils which decrease wave drag significantly. Further optimization {{can be achieved}} through careful design of wing body fairings, engine nacelles, flap track fairings, and wingtip fuel tanks. Due to the prevalence of supercritical airfoils, other design features with {{the sole purpose of}} minimizing wave drag (such as the <b>anti-shock</b> <b>bodies</b> on the Convair 990) are rare in modern aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|Most jet airliners have a {{cruising}} speed between Mach 0.8 and 0.85. For aircraft {{operating in the}} transonic regime (about Mach 0.8-1.2), wave drag can be minimized by having a cross-sectional area which changes smoothly {{along the length of}} the aircraft. This is known as the area rule. On subsonic aircraft such as jet airliners, this can be achieved by the addition of smooth pods on the trailing edges of the wings. These pods are known as <b>anti-shock</b> <b>bodies,</b> Küchemann Carrots, or flap track fairings, as they enclose the mechanisms for deploying the wing flaps.|$|R
5000|$|One {{change from}} the 880 was the large <b>anti-shock</b> <b>bodies</b> on the upper {{trailing}} edge of the wings to increase the critical Mach and reduce transonic drag. The inboard shock bodies, which were larger, were also used for additional fuel tankage. Later during the design period, Convair modified the design to include fuel in the outboard pods as well, but during the initial test flights the extra weight caused the outboard engines to oscillate in certain conditions. The pods were redesigned once more, and shortened by , causing increased drag. The inner set of pods also served a secondary role as fuel dumps for the fuel tanks, and the outlet pipe is prominent.|$|R
40|$|Measured axial and {{tangential}} velocity profiles {{in the near}} wake vortices of a semi-span model of the Convair 990 wing in the NASA-Ames 7 - by 10 -foot wind tunnel are presented. A scanning laser Doppler velocimeter was used to obtain data at two different downstream stations (0. 49 and 1. 25 wing spans) at various angles of attack and configurations from wing alone to wing plus nacelles, <b>anti-shock</b> <b>bodies,</b> and flaps deflected 27 deg (landing configuration). It is shown that the velocity distributions within the wake are quite sensitive to span loading. Specifically, it is illustrated that an aircraft flying at given lift coefficient (C SUB L), can substantially reduce its trailing vortex upset potential by deploying its flaps and altering its flight attitude to maintain the same C SUB L. This might {{be taken into consideration}} along with performance and noise considerations in the selection of aircraft approach lift over drag...|$|R
