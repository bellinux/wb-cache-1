500|$|On August 23, Feldman threw seven {{scoreless}} innings {{while allowing}} only four hits in {{a win over}} the Tampa Bay Rays. It was his 13th win of the season (tied for third in the AL) and put his season record at 13–4. It was Feldman's ninth road win of the season (bringing him to 9–1 on the road), tying him with Sabathia for best in the AL. The win put the Rangers two games ahead of the Rays in the AL wild card standings, and one game behind the Red Sox. [...] His career-high 11 strikeouts were the most by a Ranger since Matt Perisho struck out 12 in 1999 (see [...] ). [...] Commenting on Feldman's last strikeout, Carlos Peña said: [...] "I was on second base, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> pitch that he made to B. J. , and I was like, 'Wow.' I thought to myself, 'That's unhittable right there.'" [...] Rays manager Joe Maddon called Feldman's performance [...] "the best-pitched game against us all year", in spite of Mark Buehrle's perfect game against them earlier in the season.|$|E
500|$|It was a {{journalist}} on a motorbike {{who managed to}} get up to me. He was shouting 'Not that way! Not that way!' And I turned round in the road and I rode back beneath the outside wall of the grandstand <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> gateway that went into the track, a gateway for journalists. And that's the way I went, except that it came out {{on the other side of}} the track from the proper entrance. The bunch came in and Serse won the sprint. But then his brother told Serse to go to the judges to object. He told Serse that I hadn't ridden the entire and precise course and that therefore I should be déclassé. But that was below him. Coppi wanted his brother to have a big victory. He was a great champion, Coppi, but to do what he did, to protest like that to get a victory for his brother, that wasn't dignified for a champion. That was below him. A champion like that should never have stooped that low. I never spoke to him about it. Never did. Why should I? ...|$|E

500|$|In June 1974, Lennon and Pang {{returned}} {{to live in}} New York City. Lennon stopped drinking and concentrated on recording. As Lennon had previously had cats in Liverpool—while living at his aunt Mimi's house—he and Pang adopted two cats which they named Major and Minor. In the early summer, while Lennon was working on his Walls and Bridges album, the couple moved into a penthouse apartment at 434 East 52nd Street, where Lennon and Pang claim to have seen a UFO on August 23, 1974, from their terrace, which had {{a panoramic view of}} east New York. To gain access to the deck Lennon and Pang had to climb out of their kitchen window. On the night in question, a naked Lennon excitedly called Pang to join him on the deck outside and they both watched a circular object silently floating less than 100 feet away. Lennon called Bob Gruen—Lennon's [...] "official" [...] photographer—and told him what had happened. Gruen suggested Lennon should call the police, but Lennon laughed it off, saying, [...] "I’m not going to call up the newspaper and say, 'This is John Lennon <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> flying saucer last night'". Gruen called the local police precinct which confirmed that three other people had reported a sighting, and the Daily News said that five people had reported a sighting in the same area of New York where Lennon and Pang lived.|$|E
2500|$|The prophet Ezekiel (2:9–10) {{received}} his prophecy by hand: [...] "Then I looked, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> hand stretched out to me. In {{it was a}} scroll, which he unrolled before me. On both sides of it were written words of lament and mourning and woe" [...] and this and other moments from Ezekiel sometimes include the hand. In the Paris Psalter, Moses, Jonah and Isaiah are all shown blessed by hands, from which rays of light come. Other prophets are sometimes also shown with the hand.|$|E

I increased the throttle and was able to hold height {{for a few minutes and}} then noticed the engine water temperature was over 100 degrees Celsius and I could see steam from the left hand engine cowling. The engine lost power again <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> chance to land in some allotments, I pushed the control down to 45 degrees and hit the ground at the same angle.

2500|$|An early 1996 Q {{magazine}} interview {{revealed that}} relations between Blur members had become very strained; journalist Adrian Deevoy {{wrote that he}} found them [...] "on {{the verge of a}} nervous breakup". Coxon, in particular, began to resent his bandmates and, in a rejection of the group's Britpop aesthetic, made a point of listening to noisy American alternative rock bands such as Pavement. Albarn grew to appreciate Coxon's tastes in lo-fi and underground music, and recognised the need to significantly change Blur's musical direction once again. [...] "I can sit at my piano and write brilliant observational pop songs all day long but you've got to move on", he said, and decided to let Coxon have more creative control over their new album. Albarn visited Iceland during this period, stating that, [...] "I used to have a recurring dream, as a child, of a black sand beach. And one hazy, lazy day , I was watching the TV <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> programme about Iceland, and they had black beaches. So I got on a plane, and booked into the Saga hotel. I didn't know it meant Saga holidays, for older people—I thought it was Saga as in Nordic sagas. But it was actually an OAP cruise hotel. I was on my own: I didn't know anybody. I went into the street, Laugavegur, where the bars are, and that was it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1969, Haggard {{released}} [...] "Okie From Muskogee," [...] with lyrics ostensibly {{reflecting the}} singer's {{pride in being}} from Middle America where people are conventionally patriotic, don't smoke marijuana, don't take LSD, don't protest by burning draft cards or otherwise challenge authority. In the ensuing years, Haggard gave varying statements regarding whether he intended the song as a humorous satire or a serious political statement in support of conservative values. In a 2001 interview, Haggard called the song a [...] "documentation of the uneducated that lived in America at the time." [...] However, he made several other statements suggesting that he meant the song seriously. On the Bob Edwards Show, he said, [...] "I wrote it when I recently {{got out of the}} joint. I knew {{what it was like to}} lose my freedom, and I was getting really mad at these protesters. They didn't know anything more about the war in Vietnam than I did. I thought how my dad, who was from Oklahoma, would have felt. I felt I knew how those boys fighting in Vietnam felt." [...] In the country music documentary series Lost Highway, he elaborated: [...] "My dad passed away when I was nine, and I don't know if you've ever thought about somebody you've lost and you say, 'I wonder what so-and-so would think about this?' I was drivin' on Interstate 40 <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> sign that said '19 Miles to Muskogee.' Muskogee was always referred to in my childhood as 'back home.' So I saw that sign and my whole childhood flashed before my eyes and I thought, 'I wonder what dad would think about the youthful uprising that was occurring at the time, the Janis Joplins.... I understood 'em, I got along with it, but what if he was to come alive at this moment? And I thought, what a way to describe the kind of people in America that are still sittin' in the center of the country sayin', 'What is goin' on on these campuses?'" [...] In the American Masters documentary about him, he said, [...] "That's how I got into it with the hippies.... I thought they were unqualified to judge America, and I thought they were lookin' down their noses at something that I cherished very much, and it pissed me off. And I thought, 'You sons of bitches, you've never been restricted away from this great, wonderful country, and yet here you are in the streets bitchin' about things, protesting about a war that they didn't know any more about than I did. They weren't over there fightin' that war any more than I was." ...|$|E
