5|$|Although <b>a</b> <b>disaster</b> <b>for</b> the British 1st Airborne Division, {{their fight}} {{north of the}} Rhine is {{considered}} an example of courage and endurance {{and one of the}} greatest feats of arms in the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Because of the South Vietnamese {{need for}} {{security}} which precluded thorough planning, an inability {{by the political}} and military leaders of the U.S. and South Vietnam to face military realities, and poor execution, Operation Lam Son 719 collapsed when faced by the determined resistance of a skillful foe. The campaign was <b>a</b> <b>disaster</b> <b>for</b> the ARVN, demonstrating deficiencies in ARVN military leaders and that the best units of the ARVN could be defeated by PAVN and destroying the confidence that had been built up over the previous three years.|$|E
5|$|From a {{military}} point of view, the outcome at Vukovar was not <b>a</b> <b>disaster</b> <b>for</b> Croatia's overall war effort. The battle broke {{the back of}} the JNA offensive and left Croatia's main adversary exhausted and unable to press its offensive deeper into the country. Vukovar was probably indefensible, being almost surrounded by Serb-held territory and closer to Belgrade than to Zagreb, and although the defeat was damaging to morale, in a strategic context the damage and delays inflicted on the JNA more than made up for the loss of the town.|$|E

5|$|The 6th Division's next {{campaign}} was the failed Battle of Greece, <b>a</b> <b>disaster</b> <b>for</b> the British Commonwealth forces sent there. While in Greece, Mackay led a hastily assembled Australian-British-New Zealand-Greek formation known as Mackay Force, defending the Klidi Pass at the Battle of Vevi. The Allies {{were forced to}} retreat in a fierce assault by the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler brigade. Mackay was the only Australian general to face the Waffen-SS in battle.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} {{into the}} Peloponnese was <b>a</b> <b>disaster</b> <b>for</b> Epiriote ambitions. Although Helenus was permitted by Antigonus {{to return to}} his homeland with the remainder of his army, Epirus ceased to be a regional power. Pyrrhus' son and successor, Alexander II of Epirus was granted generous terms by the Macedonian king. Epirus was able to keep Pyrrhus' conquests of Tymphaea, Parauaea and Atintania in western Macedon. Antigonus realised that an independent Epirus was essential in order to act as a buffer against the Illyrians to the north.|$|E

5|$|The {{expedition}} {{was composed}} of 20 warships, 21 frigates, and 32 transport ships, containing 800 cannons, 3,000 soldiers, and 10,000 marines. The expedition was to retake Louisbourg and then Annapolis Royal. However, after a three months crossing, and the dispersal of the fleet between Sable Island and the mainland, the expedition {{turned out to be}} <b>a</b> <b>disaster</b> <b>for</b> the French, and they would not try to recapture Port Royal again.|$|E
5|$|Unable {{to subdue}} Basarab, the king ordered the retreat through the mountains. But {{in a long}} and narrow valley, the Hungarian army was {{attacked}} by the Romanians, who had taken up positions on the heights. The battle, called the Battle of Posada, lasted for four days (November 9–12, 1330) and was <b>a</b> <b>disaster</b> <b>for</b> the Hungarians whose defeat was devastating. The king was only able to escape with his life by exchanging his royal coat of arms {{with one of his}} retainers.|$|E
5|$|Dingle, who {{had been}} a member of the Oxford Officers Training Corps, was gazetted second {{lieutenant}} in the 6th Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment, which took part in the Suvla Bay Landing of the Gallipoli Campaign on 6 August 1915. His battalion took Scimitar Hill on 9 August, with great loss of life, only to be forced to make a tactical withdrawal. On 21 August, the Battle of Scimitar Hill ensued, <b>a</b> <b>disaster</b> <b>for</b> Britain and her allies: Dingle was killed the following day, defending a trench that had earlier been captured. He is commemorated on the Helles Memorial to the missing dead.|$|E

5|$|Duperré did {{not meet}} any British ships on his journey back to the French island, {{as most of the}} British {{blockade}} squadron were engaged {{in the aftermath of the}} Invasion of Île Bonaparte, conducted during July by Commodore Rowley. With the British distracted by this amphibious operation, it was simple for Duperré to reach Grand Port on the south east coast of Île de France in spite of the small blockade squadron under Captain Samuel Pym. This narrow and well-protected anchorage was considered to be the best place to refit the battered French squadron, but in August it came under attack by a British squadron in the Battle of Grand Port. This action was <b>a</b> <b>disaster</b> <b>for</b> the British as their ships became grounded in the unfamiliar shoals of the harbour and four frigates were lost under fire from shore batteries and Duperré's squadron.|$|E
5|$|The 1943 {{season was}} <b>a</b> <b>disaster</b> <b>for</b> Brown and the Buckeyes. Depleted by the {{military}} draft and facing tough competition from teams on Army and Navy bases, Brown was forced to play 17-year-old recruits {{who had not yet}} enlisted. Ohio State had affiliated itself with the Army Specialized Training Program, which did not allow its trainees to participate in varsity sports, while schools such as Michigan and Purdue became part of the Navy's V-12 training program, which did. The Buckeyes ended with a 3–6 record. In three seasons at Ohio State, Brown amassed an 18–8–1 record.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} <b>a</b> <b>disaster</b> <b>for</b> the French. According to {{unofficial}} accounts, they lost approximately 900men killed or drowned {{and at least}} 300wounded, {{in addition to the}} loss of a number of the newly constructed landing craft. In France the newly appointed Minister of Marine Étienne Eustache Bruix ordered a second attempt on the islands soon afterwards but the orders were immediately countermanded by the French Directory, which did not want the embarrassment of a second disastrous attack. Instead, Lacrosse gave orders for most of the surviving ships to be sent to Cherbourg, detachments later reaching Saint Malo and Granville. Muskein was ordered to return to Le Havre with the remainder.|$|E
50|$|The Battle of Poitiers {{occurred}} on the 19 September 1356. In <b>a</b> new <b>disaster</b> <b>for</b> France, John II came close to victory but he {{and one of his}} young sons, Philip the Bold, were captured.|$|R

50|$|The {{election}} was <b>a</b> massive <b>disaster</b> <b>for</b> the PCF. Marchais won only 15.4% {{in the first}} round, in fourth place. Reluctantly, Marchais endorsed Mitterrand in the runoff, facilitating Mitterrand's narrow victory with 51.8% on 10 May 1981.|$|R
5|$|The {{campaign}} had been <b>a</b> <b>disaster</b> <b>for</b> Asad and his now mainly Syrian army; Muslim control {{north of the}} Oxus had collapsed entirely, and while the governor {{had been able to}} escape complete destruction, he had suffered considerable casualties. Asad led his troops back to Balkh, but the Turgesh remained in Tokharistan, where they were joined by Ibn Surayj. As the Arabs customarily did not campaign during winter, Asad demobilized his men. On Ibn Surayj's urging, on the other hand, the Turgesh khagan decided to launch a winter attack into Lower Tokharistan, hoping to raise the local population in revolt against the Arabs. In this he was joined not only by Ibn Surayj and his followers, but by most of the native princes of Sogdiana and Tokharistan.|$|E
5|$|The total {{incompetence}} of the D.C. {{government in}} Washington, DC, {{has become an}} embarrassment to our entire Nation. This experiment in home rule is a disaster. All of us who serve in this Chamber, well over 95% of us, have held other positions in government. We have been mayors. We have been township trustees, State legislators, and the rest. I am convinced, Mr. Speaker, that there are well over 2,000 township trustees in my congressional district who with one arm tied behind their backs, could blindfolded {{do a better job}} of directing this city than the city council of D.C. It is high time that this experiment in home rule that has proven to be <b>a</b> <b>disaster</b> <b>for</b> our nation be terminated, that we return to some sort of logical government whereby the rest of us can function in this city.|$|E
5|$|While the Arab army {{returned}} to its base at Balkh, the Turgesh wintered in Tokharistan, where {{they were joined by}} Harith. The campaign had been <b>a</b> <b>disaster</b> <b>for</b> Asad and his now mainly Syrian army; Muslim control north of the Oxus had collapsed entirely, and while the Arab governor had been able to escape complete destruction, he had suffered considerable casualties. The losses suffered by the Syrians under Asad's command in the 737 campaign in Khuttal were of particularly grave importance in the long term, as the Syrian army was the main pillar of the Umayyad regime. Its numerical decline in Khurasan meant that the Khurasan-born Arabs could no longer be completely controlled by force; this opened the way for the appointment of a native Khurasani Arab governor, Nasr ibn Sayyar, to succeed Asad, and, eventually, for the outbreak of the Abbasid Revolution that toppled the Umayyad regime.|$|E

5|$|Four of {{the five}} French ships managed to break past the British blockade, taking shelter in the {{protected}} anchorage, which was only accessible {{through a series of}} complicated reefs and sandbanks that were impassable without an experienced harbour pilot. When Pym ordered his frigates to attack the anchored French on August 22 and 23, his ships became trapped in the narrow channels of the bay: two were irretrievably grounded; a third, outnumbered by the combined French squadron, was defeated; and a fourth was unable to close to within effective gun range. Although the French ships were also badly damaged, the battle was <b>a</b> <b>disaster</b> <b>for</b> the British: one ship was captured after suffering irreparable damage, the grounded ships were set on fire to prevent their capture by French boarding parties and the remaining vessel was seized as it left the harbour by the main French squadron from Port Napoleon under Commodore Jacques Hamelin.|$|E
5|$|Justinian's {{ambition}} {{to restore the}} Roman Empire to its former glory was only partly realized. In the West, the brilliant early military successes of the 530s were followed by years of stagnation. The dragging war with the Goths was <b>a</b> <b>disaster</b> <b>for</b> Italy, even though its long-lasting effects may have been less severe than is sometimes thought. The heavy taxes that the administration imposed upon its population were deeply resented. The final victory in Italy and the conquest of Africa and the coast of southern Hispania significantly enlarged the area over which the Empire could project its power and eliminated all naval threats to the empire. Despite losing much of Italy soon after Justinian's death, the empire retained several important cities, including Rome, Naples, and Ravenna, leaving the Lombards as a regional threat. The newly founded province of Spania kept the Visigoths {{as a threat to}} Hispania alone and not to the western Mediterranean and Africa.|$|E
5|$|Shion is {{aboard the}} Woglinde running tests on KOS-MOS when the crew {{pick up a}} Zohar Emulator, one of {{thirteen}} replicas of the Zohar. Cherenkov monitors her progress, {{but at the same}} time is a U-TIC spy furthering their goal of finding the original Zohar. Following the Zohar Emulator's retrieval, the Woglinde is attacked by Gnosis. KOS-MOS self-activates and protects Shion's team, in the process killing Federation officer Luis Virgil with friendly fire to save Shion and her assistant Allen. KOS-MOS brings them along with Cherenkov on board the Elsa, which is heading to their destination of Second Miltia. When a Gnosis attacks, chaos' ability to dispel them saves Cherenkov's life. The attack begins mutating Cherenkov, tormenting him with visions of his past as a soldier who failed to adjust to civilian life and killed many people including his wife. During these periods, Shion becomes concerned that KOS-MOS is displaying aberrant behavior, and Allen worries about Shion's emotional state. Alongside these events, the cyborg Ziggy is dispatched to rescue the Realian MOMO from U-TIC, as data stored inside her could open the way to the original planet Miltia, lost in <b>a</b> <b>disaster</b> <b>for</b> which her creator Joachim Mizrahi is blamed. Ziggy rescues MOMO and narrowly escapes, fending off attacks by Margulis. Albedo, who is working with U-TIC for his own goals, sets out in pursuit of MOMO.|$|E
50|$|As {{it turned}} out, {{the battle was}} <b>an</b> unmitigated <b>disaster</b> <b>for</b> the British army. No ground was won and no {{tactical}} advantage gained. The battle likely had no positive effect on assisting the main French attack 15 mi to the south.|$|R
