5|$|Patel and Menon {{backed up}} their {{diplomatic}} efforts by producing treaties {{that were designed}} to be attractive to rulers of princely states. Two key documents were produced. The first was the Standstill Agreement, which confirmed the continuance of the pre-existing agreements and administrative practices. The second was the Instrument of Accession, by which the ruler of the princely state in question agreed to the accession of his kingdom to independent India, granting the latter control over specified subject matters. The nature of the subject matters varied depending on the <b>acceding</b> <b>state.</b> The states which had internal autonomy under the British signed an Instrument of Accession which only ceded three subjects {{to the government of}} India—defence, external affairs, and communications, each defined in accordance with List 1 to Schedule VII of the Government of India Act 1935. Rulers of states which were in effect estates or talukas, where substantial administrative powers were exercised by the Crown, signed a different Instrument of Accession, which vested all residuary powers and jurisdiction in the Government of India. Rulers of states which had an intermediate status signed a third type of Instrument, which preserved the degree of power they had under the British.|$|E

5000|$|Article 23 of the Basic Law {{provided}} other de jure German states, initially {{not included}} in the field of application of the Basic Law, with the right to declare their accession (Beitritt) at a later date. Therefore, although the Basic Law was considered provisional, it allowed more parts of Germany to join its field of application. On one side, it gave the Federal Republic of Germany - composed as it was in 1949 - no right to negotiate, reject or deny another German state's declaration of its accession to the FRG, subject to the FRG's recognising that state de jure and being satisfied that the declaration of accession resulted from the free self-determination of its people; while on the other side an <b>acceding</b> <b>state</b> would have to accept the Basic Law and all laws so far legislated under the institutions of the FRG as they were. As the Federal Republic could not itself declare the accession of another part of Germany under Article 23, this provision could not be applied as an instrument of annexation, nor could accession under Article 23 be achieved by international treaty. It remained unclear whether accession under Article 23 could be achieved by a part of Germany whose government was not recognised de jure by the Federal Republic, and if so how; but in practice this situation did not arise. Article 23, altered after 1990, originally read as follows: ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} discriminatory {{membership in}} the European Union from a game-theoretical perspective. I argue that discriminatory membership enables the enlargement of international organizations with heterogenous member states. EU members impose discriminatory measures on new members to redistribute enlargement gains from new members to particularly negatively affected EU members as to render expansion pareto-efficient. The empirical findings of a probit analysis on the EU accession negotiations and outcomes of all five EU enlargement rounds support the theoretical claim. The EU grants <b>acceding</b> <b>states</b> restricted membership rights if distributional conflicts emerge. Moreover, the candidate’s bargaining power {{and the possibility of}} alternative compensation schemes influence the enlargement outcomes.

40|$|The {{marginal}} {{amount of}} legislative {{activity in the}} asylum topic suggests {{that the impact of}} the EU accession process on Turkish asylum law has been insignificant compared that in other fields of law, despite early gusto. Remarkably, this negative shift in Turkish asylum policy coincides with the adoption of the secondary legislation by the EU throughout the transitional period as envisaged by the Amsterdam Treaty, particularly the Asylum Procedures Directive. The records of interaction between the Union's asylum acquis and the Turkish Government's responses indicate that the problem, at least to a certain extent, arises on account of the Union's asylum acquis. The fact that the Union imposes a burden-shifting tool on an <b>acceding</b> <b>State,</b> as a process of becoming a part of the burden-sharing system within the EU, inevitably raises concerns among Turkish authorities. Therefore, a solution could be found in bringing the proposed legal framework closer to the burden-sharing relationship that exists among the EU Member States...|$|E
40|$|Under {{the regime}} {{established}} by the Antarctic Treaty of 1959, decision-making remains exclusively with {{the limited number of}} states that are entitled to appoint representatives to participate in Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings. Whereas the 12 original signatory states have a permanent right to attend these meetings, acceding states may gain consultative status only during the time they carry out substantial scientific research in the Antarctic. This paper addresses three issues: the first relates to the problems arising out of the ‘admission procedure' adopted by the original signatory states when faced with the first application of an <b>acceding</b> <b>state</b> to become an Antarctic Treaty Consultative Party, a procedure that has been applied ever since to similar cases. The second looks at the forms of scientific research activities an acceding party ought to conduct in Antarctica {{in order to meet the}} requirements laid down in the Antarctic Treaty. The third deals more generally with the issue of limited participation in the Antarctic Treaty decision-making process, which has come under severe criticism from non-Consultative Parties and states that have not acceded to the Treat...|$|E

It applies especially to relatively large and regionally diversified economies as Poland. The membership in the European Union will affect general development patterns both at the aggregate and regional level. It is also likely to induce regional convergence or divergence. The experience of the 1990 s shows that economic transformation and gradual economic integration have led to a significant rise in regional inequalities in Poland. The accession to the EU is bound to further increase regional inequalities at least in short to medium run which will constitute a major challenge for both supranational and national equalization-oriented regional policy. Furthermore, the likelihood of convergent regional development in Poland is rather questionable even in the long run. economic integration, regional inequalities...|$|R
