40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine the financial characteristics of companies involved in merger activity. More specifically, the study aims to determine: (a) whether <b>acquired</b> <b>companies</b> possessed financial characteristics similar to previous failed companies (the 'failing-company' hypothesis); (b) whether <b>acquiring</b> <b>companies</b> possessed financial characteristics similar to previous failed companies and (c) the impact of acquisition on the post-acquisition performance of <b>acquiring</b> <b>companies,</b> and particularly to consider whether their performance differs according to the financial characteristics of the <b>companies</b> they <b>acquired.</b> A new "bankruptcy prediction" model, contemporary with the acquisition data, was derived, tested for robustness, and applied to samples of <b>acquired</b> and <b>acquiring</b> <b>companies.</b> An indirect test of the 'failing-company' hypothesis was carried out by comparison with the results obtained on application of the model to control groups of non-acquired and non-acquiring companies. The test indicated that a higher proportion of <b>acquired</b> <b>companies</b> possessed financial characteristics similar to failed companies than the control group of non-acquired companies. This evidence tends to support the 'failing-company' hypothesis as a motive for mergers for <b>acquired</b> <b>companies.</b> Conversely, there was no such evidence in support of the hypothesis for <b>acquiring</b> <b>companies.</b> The approach adopted also allowed the dichotomy of <b>acquired</b> <b>companies</b> (failing vs. non-failing) which made it possible to test for differential post-acquisition performance of the <b>acquiring</b> <b>companies.</b> In order to evaluate the post-acquisition performance of <b>acquiring</b> <b>companies,</b> three different measurement criteria were adopted. They were: (a) accounting-based profitability and gearing ratios (b) industry-standardardised profitability measure (Meeks (1977)) and (c) performance analysis-scores (PAS-score) (Taffler (1983)). The results indicated that the <b>acquiring</b> <b>companies</b> generally incurred a decline in their post-acquisition profitability measures, while they increased their gearing ratios. Generally, the group <b>acquiring</b> potentially failing <b>companies</b> exhibited 'superior' post-acquisition performance compared with the group <b>acquiring</b> "non-failing" <b>companies.</b> These findings support the managerial motives for mergers since there appears to be little evidence that mergers are undertaken to increase profitability as implied in neoclassical motives. They also suggest the possible need for a review of public policy towards mergers; perhaps mergers ought to be encouraged only if they prevent impending bankruptcy by the acquisition of failing companies...|$|R

Titled Arma Futura, it was developed in conjunction with Bohemia's newly <b>acquired</b> <b>company,</b> Altar Games. In the game, players were intended to fight aliens, and the game's direction once shifting to role-playing. All of these futuristic elements were later scrapped, and were remade into a more realistic setting with the title eventually became ARMA 3. The Greek media reported in 2012 that two Czechs were arrested on the Greek island Lemnos, the setting for ARMA III after being charged with espionage. This was later confirmed to be Martin Pezlar and Ivan Buchta, both of them employees at Bohemia Interactive. The main reason for their charge is that they took photos of military installations, which under Greek law threatened their national security. Charges were refuted, and both of them insisted that they were traveling the island for entertainment only. If convicted, the duo faced a 20-year sentence. This soon became a diplomatic concern, with Czech President Václav Klaus urging the Greek President to solve this issue with [...] "special attention". Bohemia also made efforts by motivating its ARMA communities to petition to pressure Greece for the pair's release. During this period of time, team morale dropped. [...] was released by the studio , but according to Španěl, [...] "nobody at the studio really cared" [...] because their friends were stranded in a foreign jail. Regardless, Pezlar and Buchta were held in prison for 129 days until the Greek government allowed them to be released on bail. After this incident, the team decided to renamed ARMA 3 setting from Lemnos to a fictional island called [...] "Altis". Arma III was eventually released in August 2013 to positive critical reviews. Two mobile ARMA games, ARMA Tactics and ARMA Mobile Ops, were released in 2013 and 2016 respectively.|$|E

For example, an <b>acquiring</b> <b>company</b> may decide to purchase a company that is profitable and has good distribution capabilities in new areas which the <b>acquiring</b> <b>company</b> can use for its own products as well. A target company might be attractive because it allows the <b>acquiring</b> <b>company</b> to enter a new market without having to take on the risk, time and expense of starting a new division. An <b>acquiring</b> <b>company</b> could decide to take over a competitor not only because the competitor is profitable, but in order to eliminate competition in its field and make it easier, in the long term, to raise prices. Also a takeover could fulfill the belief that the combined company can be more profitable than the two companies would be separately due to a reduction of redundant functions.|$|R

The purpose is to discern which of the stated modes of payment enables an <b>acquiring</b> <b>company</b> in better hedging the risk of adverse selection that arises due to the information asymmetry on the part of the <b>acquiring</b> <b>company</b> regarding the true value of assets of the target company. It has been found that of the three modes of payment, earnouts provide best hedge to the <b>acquiring</b> <b>companies</b> for minimizing the risk of adverse selection in cross border acquisitions. The reason being earnouts enable an <b>acquiring</b> <b>company</b> resolve the problem of over-valuation and that of non-performance by making part payment contingent on the ex post performance of the target company as well as by retaining target company’s managers respectively. The paper recommends earnouts as a valuable strategy for the <b>acquiring</b> <b>companies</b> from India as well as other emerging markets for their future global acquisitions as these companies usually end up overpaying the target companies due to lack of expertise in crossborder acquisitions.
