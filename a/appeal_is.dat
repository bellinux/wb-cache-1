5|$|The <b>appeal</b> <b>is</b> {{based upon}} fresh {{evidence}} that was not available at the original trial, it is hoped the conviction will be quashed and a retrial ordered...

Peter must wear an ankle monitor and cannot leave the apartment or communicate with the outside world. Alicia is uncomfortable about Peter's return because of his infidelity, which was exposed {{at the time of}} his conviction.|$|E

5000|$|Coleman {{appealed to}} the Virginia Supreme Court, but this <b>appeal</b> <b>was</b> {{dismissed}} on {{the motion of the}} Commonwealth because his notice of <b>appeal</b> <b>was</b> not filed in time. The Virginia Supreme Court requires that a notice of <b>appeal</b> <b>be</b> filed within 30 days of entry of the final judgment; [...] Coleman's notice of <b>appeal</b> <b>was</b> filed on October 7, which was 33 days after the circuit court entered its judgment.|$|R

5|$|Germany has a {{civil law}} system based on Roman law with some {{references}} to Germanic law. The Bundesverfassungsgericht (Federal Constitutional Court) is the German Supreme Court responsible for constitutional matters, with power of judicial review. Germany's supreme court system, called Oberste Gerichtshöfe des Bundes, is specialised: for civil and criminal cases, the highest court of <b>appeal</b> <b>is</b> the inquisitorial Federal Court of Justice, and for other affairs the courts are the Federal Labour Court, the Federal Social Court, the Federal Finance Court and the Federal Administrative Court.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Stacey {{is found}} living in London using a false name. Her cousin Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace) brings {{her back to}} Walford.

Roxy threatens {{to call the police}} but Ronnie convinces her not to. However, after Janine drops the charges, Stacey decides that she needs to clear Bradley's name, so tells the police she killed Archie. She is subsequently sentenced to five years in prison, but she decides to appeal the sentence, taking her bipolar disorder into account. The <b>appeal</b> <b>is</b> successful and Stacey is released.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, {{popular culture}} writer Anna Leszkiewicz {{suggested}} {{that even though}} The Simpsons still holds cultural relevance, contemporary <b>appeal</b> <b>is</b> only for the first ten seasons, with recent episodes only garnering mainstream attention when a favorite character from the golden era is killed off, or when new information and shock twists are given for old characters. The series' ratings have also declined; while the first season enjoyed an average of 13.4 million viewing households per episode in the U.S., the twenty-first season {{had an average of}} 7.2 million viewers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Appeals</b> <b>were</b> {{heard by}} a bench of the High Court {{consisting}} of Lionel Leach, Chief Justice of Madras, Justice K.P. Lakshmana Rao and Advocate General K. Rajah Iyer. The <b>appeals</b> <b>were</b> {{filed by the}} then leading members of the Bar, V.V. Srinivasa Iyengar and Sri V.C. Gopalarathnam. The <b>appeals</b> <b>were</b> dismissed.|$|R

5|$|The {{government}} {{includes a}} Council of Ministers, {{headed by the}} prime minister and five deputy prime ministers. The members of this council need not be members of the legislature and are appointed by the president. The judiciary comprises the Supreme Court and specialized courts such as the Constitutional Court, which deals with specific issues related to constitutional and business law. The judges of national courts are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Council of the Republic. For criminal cases, the highest court of <b>appeal</b> <b>is</b> the Supreme Court. The Belarusian Constitution forbids the use of special extrajudicial courts.|$|E
5|$|If the High Court {{refuses to}} hear an appeal, the case cannot proceed further; similarly, with one exception, once the High Court has heard a case, no {{decision}} may be reviewed by the Court of Appeal. The one exception is laid out in Section 1(7), and provides that leave to <b>appeal</b> <b>is</b> only valid if either the High Court or Court of Appeal certifies it as such, and the High Court confirms that the case concerns a point of law which merits consideration. In National Westminster Bank Plc v Arthur Young McClelland Moores & Co (No.1), the Court of Appeal confirmed that, once the High Court {{has decided not to}} allow an appeal, the registrar of the Court of Appeal cannot intervene and otherwise validate such a request.|$|E
5|$|In 1962 Lord Evershed {{resigned}} as Master of the Rolls, and Denning {{was appointed to}} replace him on 19 April 1962 with a salary of £9,000. Although Denning himself described it as 'a step down' he was pleased with his appointment, as he had much preferred his time with the Court of Appeal than the House of Lords. Court of Appeal judges sit in threes, and the Lords in fives (or more), so {{it was suggested that}} to get his way in the Court of Appeal Denning only had to persuade one other judge whereas in the House of Lords it was at least two. The other 'benefit' of the Court of <b>Appeal</b> <b>is</b> that it hears more cases than the House of Lords, and so has a greater effect on the law. During his twenty years as Master of the Rolls, Denning could choose both which cases he heard, and the judges with whom he sat. Therefore, on most issues, he effectively had the last word; comparatively few cases went on to the House of Lords, which was at that time Britain's highest court of law.|$|E

5|$|Sporting {{competitions}} {{have always}} provided entertainment for crowds. To distinguish the {{players from the}} audience, the latter are often known as spectators. Developments in stadium and auditorium design, {{as well as in}} recording and broadcast technology, have allowed off-site spectators to watch sport, with the result that the size of the audience has grown ever larger and spectator sport has become increasingly popular. Two of the most popular sports with global appeal are association football and cricket. Their ultimate international competitions, the World Cup and test cricket, are broadcast around the world. Beyond the very large numbers involved in playing these sports, they are notable for being a major source of entertainment for many millions of non-players worldwide. A comparable multi-stage, long-form sport with global <b>appeal</b> <b>is</b> the Tour de France, unusual in that it takes place outside of special stadia, being run instead in the countryside.|$|E
25|$|Tanzania has a four-level judiciary. The {{lowest level}} courts on the Tanzanian {{mainland}} are the Primary Courts. In Zanzibar, {{the lowest level}} courts are the Kadhi's Courts for Islamic family matters and the Primary Courts for all other cases. On the mainland, <b>appeal</b> <b>is</b> to either the District Courts or the Resident Magistrates Courts. In Zanzibar, <b>appeal</b> <b>is</b> to the Kadhi's Appeal Courts for Islamic family matters and the Magistrates Courts for all other cases. From there, <b>appeal</b> <b>is</b> to the High Court of Mainland Tanzania or Zanzibar. No appeal regarding Islamic family matters {{can be made from}} the High Court of Zanzibar.

25|$|Canadian Federal Courts {{operate under}} a {{separate}} system throughout Canada {{and deal with}} narrower subject matter than superior courts in provincial jurisdiction. They hear cases reserved for federal jurisdiction by the Canadian constitution, such as immigration, intellectual property, judicial review of federal government decisions, and admiralty. The Federal Court of <b>Appeal</b> <b>is</b> the appellate level court in federal jurisdiction and hears cases in multiple cities, and unlike the United States, the Canadian Federal Court of <b>Appeal</b> <b>is</b> not divided into appellate circuits.|$|E

If the <b>appeal</b> <b>is</b> admissible and well founded, the Court of Justice sets aside {{the judgment of the}} General Court. Where the state of the proceedings so permits, the Court may itself decide the case. Otherwise, the Court must refer the case back to the General Court, which is bound by the decision given on appeal.|$|E

25|$|What is {{commonly}} known as an <b>appeal</b> <b>is</b> more correctly known as a proposal to alter the rating list.

When an <b>appeal</b> <b>is</b> made, it will first be discussed with the Valuation Office Agency, who will attempt to come to an agreement.
