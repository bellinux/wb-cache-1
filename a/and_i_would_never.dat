500|$|Multiple {{commentators}} have described Inchon {{as the worst}} film ever made, including The Washington Post, [...] Newsweek, TV Guide, and the Canadian Press. Inchon was later profiled in multiple books on worst in film, including The Hollywood Hall of Shame by Harry and Michael Medved, and The Worst Movies of All Time by Michael Sauter. In 2000, Kenneth Lloyd Billingsley, writing in the libertarian magazine Reason, said about a proposed film on Stalinism: [...] "A film like this could easily have turned out as big a didactic dud as the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's 1982 bomb, Inchon, with Laurence Olivier as Gen. Douglas MacArthur." [...] A 2009 review by Phil Hall for Film Threat was less negative, and he disagreed with the characterization of the film as the worst ever made, [...] "I was genuinely surprised — this is hardly among the very worst films of all time. That's not {{to say it is}} a good film. It is a dull and forgettable movie, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> recommend it. However, its reputation for being among the bottom of the cinematic barrel is wholly undeserved." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Perfect Illusion" [...] delves on the [...] "highest of {{highs and}} lowest of lows" [...] {{encountered}} {{in a relationship}} which has turned sour, hence the song's name. Gaga described it during an interview with iHeartMedia as being [...] "about modern ecstasy [...] We found our sweet, simple, ragey way of saying it. I get this sick adrenaline rush every time I hear it". The singer further clarified that the lyrics ultimately was a commentary on social media and the problems one face trying to present a perfect representation of themselves. Media reports speculated that the lyrics alluded to the singer's breakup from her boyfriend, actor Taylor Kinney, around July 2016. Samantha Schnurr from E! decoded the lyrics, saying that the repetition of the phrase [...] "perfect illusion" [...] was about their relationship. Gaga retorted during an interview with SiriusXM that the song was not for Kinney, and was not a [...] "revenge" [...] track. [...] "I love Taylor so, so much and this song is not a hit out against him [...] It's a record about all of us. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> use my song or {{want to use the}} public to hurt anyone that I love so much," [...] the singer added.|$|E

500|$|A thirty-four second promo trailer of I Am... World Tour was {{launched}} on several websites in early November 2010. The concert film premiered exclusively on ABC on November 25, 2010 as a 90-minute Thanksgiving special. A year before, over Thanksgiving itself, the network aired , {{shot at the}} Encore Theater, Las Vegas, on August 2, 2009. Several other trailers kept dropping on Beyoncé' official website in November. Beyoncé made an appearance at the School of Visual Arts Theater in New York City's Chelsea neighborhood on November 21, 2010 to premiere the concert film. On November 22, 2010, she held a screening of the DVD in New York, in presence of her parents and artists such as Mary J. Blige, Jennifer Hudson, Amel Larrieux, Tyson Beckford, Alicia Keys, and AJ Calloway. Additionally, {{in an interview with}} the Associated Press on the same day, Beyoncé revealed that the DVD will show more of her intimate side, stating: [...] "I felt like I've done so many different things, it's time for me to show a bit of who I am. The hardest thing was showing that, because a lot of things that I filmed, I filmed in my computer, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> have gotten so open if someone else was in the room." [...] On November 23, 2010, Beyoncé was interviewed by Cynthia McFadden on ABC's Nightline where she stated [...] "I feel like I wanted the fans to be able to see the things that I see... It's a lot of things that I reveal about myself that I would never give to another director." ...|$|E

2500|$|On August 14, United States Senator Claire McCaskill (D-MO) {{stated that}} [...] "militarization {{of the police}} {{escalated}} the protesters' response." [...] St. Louis Chief of Police Sam Dotson stated {{he would not have}} employed military-style policing such as that which transpired. According to Chief Dotson, [...] "My gut told me what I was seeing were not tactics that I would use in the city <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> put officers in situations that I would not do myself." [...] Another reason Dotson did not want the city and county police to collaborate was because of the history of racial profiling by police in that county. In an email to a St. Louis Alderman who brought up concerns of racial profiling, he wrote: [...] "I agree and removed our tactical assistance. We did not send tactical resources to Ferguson on Tuesday or Wednesday. Our only assistance was that of four traffic officers to help divert traffic and keep both pedestrians and motorists safe. On Thursday we will have no officers assisting Ferguson." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} in October 2001, Mundine said of the 11 September terrorist attacks, [...] "They call it an act of terrorism, {{but if you can}} understand religion, and our way of life, it’s not about terrorism. It’s about fighting for God’s law, and America’s brought it upon themselves". Offering some insight into his tendency to make controversial comments in the media, Mundine stated that [...] "If you want to toe the line, {{if you want to be}} some corporate guy and say the right things, do the right things, you might be okay in the media's eye, but it won't be real for me." [...] Mundine later claimed he was taken out of context stating: [...] "Those comments were just spun around like I was clapping my hands. I have a family too, I know what it is like to suffer the loss of someone close to me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> wish that upon anyone. The point I was trying to get across was that it was in a war state of mind, and there is always going to be tit for tat, so why put yourself in a situation where you can endanger people. I have got nothing against any American, I have got nothing against any human being. It breaks my heart that people think I would even have that line of thought about being happy about people dying. That is crap and I want to clarify that because it is wrong." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, Jeremy Clarkson {{wrote an}} article in the Sunday Times about his Yorkshire drive in the moors of the Lexus LFA. Jeremy highly praised the LFA's {{appearance}} and how special it felt both inside and out by saying [...] "It looks very very special and inside it even gets better. Unlike Ferrari that fits buttons everywhere it can find some space, Lexus has thought through everything beautifully in this car. Apart from the switch that engages the reverse, which is behind the mileometer - there's a Spock-like logic to everything. And when you push or pull or engage anything, {{there is a sense that}} it will continue to work for thousands of years. It is the nicest car interior I've ever encountered <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> ever tire of the tool that moves all of the dials around". Clarkson highly praised the LFA engine by saying [...] "Then you fire the engine up. Snick it into first, move off and... whoa! The noise beggars belief. This is not a car that shouts, growls or barks. It howls. Up there, on the moors, it sounded otherworldly. Like a werewolf that puts its foot in a gin tap. And while it is not as fast as you were expecting, you quickly realize on damp moorland road that 552 BHP is perfect. Anything more and you're going to be picking heather out of the grille for a month". Clarkson had high praises for LFA's handling and confidence inspiring capabilities as he writes [...] "The LFA inspires tremendous confidence. Then up ahead, Gouge marks in the tarmac show clearly over the years, many a sump have clattered into the road and you brace for impact that never comes. The LFA may be lower than a worm's navel, but so successful is the suspension, it never bottoms out". Clarkson sums up his experience in the LFA by saying [...] "I have to say I absolutely love it. It is an intelligent car built by intelligent people. In some ways it is raw and visceral: In others it is a lesson in common sense. Engine at the front, two seats in the middle and a boot you can use. Despite all of this, there is a sense that you are in a real, full-on race car. If cruise control was invented for Nevada, Yorkshire was invented for the LFA. It is a car that reminds you every time you drive it why we have corners." [...] Regarding only 500 LFA's being built at a high price, Clarkson summed it up [...] "The trouble is that there are only 500 being built..still, it is not the end of the world since you can have the Nissan GT-R. It is nine-tenths as good. But costs almost five times less".|$|E
