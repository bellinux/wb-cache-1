5|$|After the United States {{declared}} war on Germany in April 1917, El Sol was requisitioned by the United States Shipping Board (USSB) {{on behalf of the}} United States Army, who designated her as an <b>animal</b> <b>transport</b> ship. Although there is no information about the specific conversion of El Sol, for other ships this typically meant that any second- or third-class passenger accommodations had to be ripped out and replaced with ramps and stalls for the horses and mules carried.|$|E
5|$|Arriving at New York on 15 November, {{four days}} after the Armistice, Pennsylvanian was {{refitted}} as an <b>animal</b> <b>transport</b> ship, which, among other things, required the building of ramps and stalls for the animals. Sometime in November, probably during her refit, she was renamed USS Scranton, becoming the first U.S. Navy ship named in honor of the Pennsylvania city. Scranton sailed for France on 12 December, arriving at Saint-Nazaire on 29 December, and returning to New York on 29 January 1919.|$|E

5|$|The 27th Infantry Division Savska was an {{infantry}} {{formation of}} the Royal Yugoslav Army that formed part of the Yugoslav 4th Army during the German-led Axis invasion of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in April 1941. It was raised from the Savska military district, and was a very large and unwieldy formation which was almost entirely reliant on <b>animal</b> <b>transport</b> for mobility. Largely manned by Croat troops, many of whom saw the Germans as potential liberators from Serbian oppression during the interwar period, the division also lacked modern arms and sufficient ammunition.|$|E
5|$|El Orientes first Navy {{voyage to}} France began when she sailed from Newport News with 500 animals on 11 August. Unlike earlier <b>animal</b> <b>transport</b> {{crossings}} for the Army, {{where there was}} {{as much as a}} 4% mortality rate, the voyages in August 1918 and after carried a transport veterinarian and a permanent veterinary detachment to care for the animals while on board the ship. As part of this new program, El Oriente delivered her full load of horses and mules— suffering no losses—at Bordeaux on 2 September. El Oriente made an additional roundtrip with 500 more animals in October, losing only three of her equine cargo during the voyage. El Oriente continued sailing for the NOTS through April 1919, sometimes carrying a small number of troops on return voyages to the United States. At that time El Oriente was converted to carry troops, and assigned to the Cruiser and Transport Force to help return larger numbers American servicemen from Europe.|$|E

25|$|USAT Meigs {{was one of}} {{the small}} fleet the Army {{maintained}} during the inter-war years and operated in the Pacific as a freight and <b>animal</b> <b>transport.</b> In 1939, with USAT Ludington, Meigs was one of only two Army owned freight transports. Included in the requirement to transport army goods and personal possessions of personnel changing duty stations to the Pacific was transport of cavalry and personal horses of officers with occasional mention of the ship transporting notable horses or owners transferring between Pacific and continental postings. In July 1938 Meigs found an oil slick along the course of the lost Pan American flying boat Hawaii Clipper about 500 miles from Manila, took samples and stood by for further investigation.|$|E
25|$|The main {{route of}} {{transmission}} is through direct contact between infected and uninfected animals. These close contacts are particularly common during <b>animal</b> <b>transport.</b> Intensive farming may {{also increase the}} risk of transmission, as the pigs are raised in very close proximity to each other. The direct transfer of the virus probably occurs either by pigs touching noses, or through dried mucus. Airborne transmission through the aerosols produced by pigs coughing or sneezing are also an important means of infection. The virus usually spreads quickly through a herd, infecting all the pigs within just a few days. Transmission may also occur through wild animals, such as wild boar, which can spread the disease between farms.|$|E
25|$|By 11 September 1915, Townshend had {{concentrated}} {{his forces}} at Ali Gharbi along the Tigris river. At his disposal {{he had the}} Poona Division, as well the 6th Indian Cavalry Brigade, 10th Royal Field Artillery Brigade, {{as well as two}} battalions from the 12th Division's 30th Indian Brigade. In all, Townshend's force was comprised 11,000 men and 28 artillery pieces. Townshend's force advanced along the Tigris from Ali Gharbi. Without any rail or motorized transport, they were reliant either on <b>animal</b> <b>transport</b> or river transport. Accompanying his force, Townshend was supported by a mixed riverine force manned by the Royal Navy and Royal Indian Marine. However, the transport available to him was only adequate. Despite lobbying for an advance, Nixon had refused anything that would ease Force D's logistical situation. Not only had Nixon not accepted additional logistical support, he had failed to ask for the return of animals that his predecessor had sent back to India, which were required to haul Townshend's supplies.|$|E

25|$|The Poona Division's {{had planned}} on {{a maximum of}} 6 percent of the {{division}} becoming casualties. In addition to each battalion's surgeons, there were the field ambulance units assigned {{to each of the}} brigades. However, these units were not intended to function as hospitals, and were only supposed to triage and stabilize the wounded before sending them back to field hospital units. Line of communication troops had to donate their own supplies to the medical units that were overrun with casualties. With Townshend's offensive, there was only one river boat equipped as a hospital ship. With the ambulances full, many of the wounded were placed on A.T. carts, which were nothing more than simple carts pulled by animals that performed most of the land hauling {{at this point in the}} campaign. In some cases, the wounded were simply laid atop boxes of ammunition or other supplies. With <b>animal</b> <b>transport</b> limited by short-sighted decisions of Nixon and his predecessors, the Poona Division only 330 animal pulled carts and 740 animals to pull them.|$|E

40|$|When farm <b>animals</b> are <b>transported</b> {{there are}} several factors that can affect their welfare. If the vehicle has an {{accident}} {{the welfare of the}} <b>animals</b> <b>transported</b> will probably be compromised. The aim {{of this study was to}} make a survey of accidents with animal transportation vehicles in Sweden. The survey included the number of accidents from January 2000 to May 2014, the cause of the accidents and how the animal welfare was affected by the accident. The authorities which were likely to have reports about accidents involving <b>animal</b> <b>transports</b> were contacted. There were no collected records about transportation accidents and the authorities referred to eachother for information. Search engines on the internet had to be used to find any accidents concerning <b>animal</b> <b>transports</b> in reports. Four interviews were carried out to determine how the animal welfare was affected and for determining how the accidents were affected by the live load of animals. In total, 39 accidents were reported by media during the chosen timespan and 31 of the vehicles made a rollover at the accident. The welfare of the animals was severely affected in many of these accidents and some of the suffering of the animals could have been avoided if the advices in the regulations of transport had been followed. At <b>transport</b> the <b>animals</b> are live load, which means they can change the center of gravity. This phenomena may cause the accidents that were reported, since several of the transports were reported to be caused by the vehicle having one wheel outside of the tarmac by accident, and then the rollover happened when the driver tried turning the vehicle back up on the road. The live load of animals can be presumed to impair the drivers abillty to parry the movements of the vehicle, and by this urging on the momentum...|$|R

40|$|Numerous risks {{associated}} with transport and handling of livestock cause bruising and poor welfare to animals. Variables having an influence {{on the level of}} bruising under Namibian <b>transport</b> conditions include <b>animal</b> factors (breed type, age, sex, condition and subcutaneous fat cover), pre-transport handling (re-branding of <b>animals),</b> <b>transport</b> related risks (loading density, animals lying down during transit) and lairage factors (fit of truck floor to off-loading ramp, moving to holding pen, pen size and minimum temperatures). Although no single factor was the dominant driver of bruise prevalence; load density, gravel roads, and cattle running after disembarking had a cumulative effect on bruising. Surprisingly, transport duration (3 vs 8. h) had minimal effect. The overall incidence of bruising is high, with the highest levels on the hips, around the butt and pin areas.
