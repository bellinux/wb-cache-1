6000|$|It fell to Verrian, in the {{assortment}} of couples in which Mrs. Westangle's guests sallied out {{to view the}} proposed scene of <b>action,</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> himself, not too willingly, at Miss Macroyd's side. In his heart and in his mind he was defending the amusement which he instantly divined as no invention of Mrs. Westangle's, and both his heart and his mind misgave him about this first essay of Miss Shirley in her new enterprise. It was, as Miss Macroyd had suggested, academic, {{and at the same}} time it had a danger in it of being tomboyish. Golf, tennis, riding, boating, swimming--all the vigorous sports in which women now excel--were boldly athletic, and yet you could not feel quite that they were tomboyish. Was it because the bent of Miss Shirley was so academic that she was periling upon tomboyishness without knowing it in this primal inspiration of hers? Inwardly he resented the word academic, although outwardly he had assented to it when Miss Macroyd proposed it. To be academic would be even more fatal to Miss Shirley's ambition than to be tomboyish, and he thought with pathos of that touch about the Italian nobility in the Middle Ages, and how little it could have moved the tough fancies of that crowd of well-groomed young people at the breakfast-table when Mrs. Westangle brought it out with her ignorant acceptance of it as a social force. After all, Miss Macroyd was about the only one who could have felt it in the way it was meant, and she had chosen to smile at it. He wondered if possibly she could feel the secondary pathos of it as he did. But to make talk with her he merely asked: ...|$|E
60|$|Party {{is a body}} of men {{united for}} {{promoting}} by their joint endeavors the national interest upon some particular principle {{in which they are}} all agreed. For my part, I find it impossible to conceive, that any one believes in his own politics, or thinks them to be of any weight, who refuses to adopt the means of having them reduced into practice. It is the business of the speculative philosopher to mark the proper ends of government. It is the business of the politician, who is the philosopher in <b>action,</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out proper means towards those ends, and to employ them with effect. Therefore every honorable connection will avow it is their first purpose, to pursue every just method to put the men who hold their opinions into such a condition as may enable them to carry their common plans into execution, with all the power and authority of the state. As this power is attached to certain situations, it is their duty to contend for these situations. Without a proscription of others, they are bound to give to their own party the preference in all things; and by no means, for private considerations, to accept any offers of power in which the whole body is not included; nor to suffer themselves to be led, or to be controlled, or to be overbalanced, in office or in council, by those who contradict the very fundamental principles on which their party is formed, and even those upon which every fair connection must stand. Such a generous contention for power, on such manly and honorable maxims, will easily be distinguished from the mean and interested struggle for place and emolument. The very style of such persons will serve to discriminate them from those numberless impostors, who have deluded the ignorant with professions incompatible with human practice, and have afterwards incensed them by practices below the level of vulgar rectitude.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the area}} of civil rights, Clark backed {{decisions}} supporting government enforcement of laws designed to promote racial equality. To this end he authored or played a key supporting role {{in a number of}} the Court’s landmark decisions in this area. Several rulings by the Vinson Court, most notably Sweatt v. Painter and McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents (1950), which held that black graduate students must be allowed into “white” state universities and law schools because the separate black school could not provide an education of equal quality, helped lay the groundwork for holdings including Brown v. Board of Education (1954). Clark played a critical behind-the-scenes role in Sweatt and McLaurin that shaped the discussion and provided a workable solution on this issue, helping to “move the Court from considering equality only as a measurable mathematical construct … to what would become known as intangibles.” [...] Clark’s role as one of two southern justices gave him additional impact in those cases, as well as in Brown and Hernandez v. Texas (1954), in which the Court ruled that excluding persons of Mexican ancestry from juries violated the Constitution, and other decisions. He also authored a number of important decisions on race in the 1960s {{during the height of the}} Civil Rights era, including Anderson v. Martin (1964), which held unconstitutional a Louisiana statute because it required the races of those running for office to be printed on a ballot, Burton v.

Honey still sits at home, lightly tickling her piano as the radio sounds: Graham Cracker announces that the great opposites are entering the ring. We cut to each; Bosko silences his cheering fans to serenade them with a song, at last leaping happily upon the ropes before taking his seat. Gas House Harry laughs derisively at something his manager whispers to him.

The Champion has the advantage, it seems, knocking the challenger back with a mighty slug. A dazed Bosko's manager rushes to his aid, fanning him and gently spraying him with water until, tickled, he playfully insists that his manager stop it. Back in the brawl, Bosko buffets the Champion such that the ship tattooed on his chest sinks. A hippopotamus-spectator holding a lollipop continually cheers for Bosko. The ostrich-referee is watching closely, occasionally coming between the competitors until they mutually punch him out of the arena after a dance-divertissement. Bosko dodges punch after punch; Honey nervously listens as the radio-announcer states that Bosko is up, then down, then up, then down: we return to the <b>action</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> that the Champion is standing upon poor Bosko's feet, punching him repeatedly such that he falls backward only to reascend again to meet the assailant's fist.
