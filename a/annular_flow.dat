These flows {{are characterized by}} a droplet laden vapor core with a thin, wavy liquid film wetting the walls. The prediction of <b>annular</b> <b>flows</b> has been largely confined to one-dimensional modeling which typically correlates the film thickness, droplet loading, and phase velocities by considering the average flow conditions and global mass and momentum balances to infer the flow topology.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a study on}} the laminarization phenomena of <b>annular</b> tube <b>flows</b> that are strongly and uniformly heated {{from both sides of the}} annulus. Experimental as well as numerical results exhibited a remarkable reduction in the local heat transfer coefficient of both inner and outer walls, and the local Nusselt numbers were found to finally approach the laminar values. Moreover, the calculated radial profiles of turbulent kinetic energy, time-averaged streamwise velocity, etc., all suggested the transition from turbulent to laminar flows. Hence, it was concluded that the <b>annular</b> <b>flows</b> can actually be laminarized as the circular tube flows. Following this conclusion, a discussion is developed on the occurrence criteria of laminarization of the <b>annular</b> tube <b>flows.</b> It is concluded that if it is heated uniformly from both walls, the <b>annular</b> tube <b>flows</b> are laminarized at the same bulk acceleration level as the circular tube flows.

40|$|AbstractBoth {{the loss}} of flowing {{resistance}} and dynamic performance of fluid transportation for water-air two phases in a horizontaltube {{is closely related to}} its flow pattern, which is different from fluid flow of single phase. At the present work, according to Baker's adiabatic flow pattern map of water-air, a VOF gas-liquid interfacial tracking model was adopted to numerically analyze characteristics of adiabatic water-air flow pattern and their transitions. Parameters, including volume fraction, velocity and pressure contours, were obtained for stratified, plug and <b>annular</b> <b>flows.</b> Results show that distributions of both pressure and velocity change with flow patterns. Pressure has a stratified distribution at the cross-section of tube for stratified flow, and pressure of air is lower than that of water.

The significance of this phenomenon is that, if not properly designed for, it can present issues when trying to fill the core with liquid (the phenomenon works against gravity, forcing liquid out of the core).|$|E

50|$|Aerosol Jet Printing (also {{known as}} Maskless Mesoscale Materials Deposition or M3D) is another {{material}} deposition technology for printed electronics. The Aerosol Jet process begins with atomization of an ink, {{which can be}} heated up to 80 °C, producing droplets {{on the order of}} one to two micrometres in diameter. The atomized droplets are entrained in a gas stream and delivered to the print head. Here, an <b>annular</b> <b>flow</b> of clean gas is introduced around the aerosol stream to focus the droplets into a tightly collimated beam of material. The combined gas streams exit the print head through a converging nozzle that compresses the aerosol stream to a diameter as small as 10 µm. The jet of droplets exits the print head at high velocity (~50 meters/second) and impinges upon the substrate. Electrical interconnects, passive and active components are formed by moving the print head, equipped with a mechanical stop/start shutter, relative to the substrate. The resulting patterns can have features ranging from 10 µm wide, with layer thicknesses from tens of nanometers to >10 µm. A wide nozzle print head enables efficient patterning of millimeter size electronic features and surface coating applications. All printing occurs without the use of vacuum or pressure chambers and at room temperature. The high exit velocity of the jet enables a relatively large separation between the print head and the substrate, typically 2-5 mm. The droplets remain tightly focused over this distance, resulting in the ability to print conformal patterns over three dimensional substrates. Despite the high velocity, the printing process is gentle; substrate damage does not occur and there is generally no splatter or overspray from the droplets. Once patterning is complete, the printed ink typically requires post treatment to attain final electrical and mechanical properties. Post-treatment is driven more by the specific ink and substrate combination than by the printing process. A wide range of materials has been successfully deposited with the Aerosol Jet process, including diluted thick film pastes, thermosetting polymers such as UV-curable epoxies, and solvent-based polymers like polyurethane and polyimide, and biologic materials.|$|E

In this <b>annular</b> <b>flow</b> regime, heat transfer coefficient also depends on both heat flux and mass flux.

The data were obtained from a vertical narrow space annulus which was formed between 1. 240 in. I. D. and 1. 125 in. O. D, 99. 9 % copper tubes 142 in. long. By varying the <b>annular</b> fluid <b>flow</b> rate, the Reynolds number, based on an equivalent diameter, (D(2) - D(1)), covers a range from 150 to 10, 000. The pressure drop data were obtained for four different conditions: (I) isothermal runs with <b>annular</b> fluid <b>flowing</b> upward; (2) isothermal runs with <b>annular</b> fluid <b>flowing</b> downward; (3) internally heated runs with <b>annular</b> fluid <b>flowing</b> upward; and (4) internally heated runs with <b>annular</b> fluid <b>flowing</b> downward. The results from the four different conditions were practically the same when the average outer annulus wall temperature was employed to evaluate the fluid physical properties for internally heated runs. Within the laminar flow region, the values of friction factor are in excellent agreement with the theoretical predictions. Friction factors for Reynolds numbers greater than 2000 fall on the accepted empirical line for commercial pipes. The heat transfer tests were conducted for two different flow conditions; one was for the <b>annular</b> fluid <b>flowing</b> upward, the other was for the annuler fluid flowing downward. These conditions were used in order to attempt to analyze the effects of natural convection. Steam heated water, circulating at about 10 ft/sec velocity through inner tube {{from top to bottom}} was used as heat source. Total heat transfer was based on the annulus side. Surface coefficients of heat transfer between the inner tube and annular fluid were determined by subtracting from the overall resistance to heat transfer the sum of the resistances due to the inner hot water film and the metal wall. The present heat transfer data for the fluid flowing up is compared with the results of several other investigations. In general for the laminar region these results are lower and in the turbulent region they are somewhat higher. The effect of natural convection on the heat transfer coefficients of this annulus is higher than that predicted for infinite width parallel plates. The effect of natural convection on the j-value is about 20 % lower for <b>annular</b> fluid <b>flowing</b> down than flowing up within the laminar flow region. The local heat transfer coefficient was determined in this investigation by assuming that the bulk temperature distribution was similar to the outer wall temperature distribution.

In particular, we {{focus attention on the}} effect of <b>annular</b> air <b>flow</b> on the flame. The <b>annular</b> air <b>flow</b> promotes development of a shear layer vortex street in the central fuel jet and lends to change in the direction of rotation of the vortex. These features are supported by the numerical simulation. The agreement of experimental and numerical vortex frequencies is satisfactory. The fluctuation in temperature corresponds well to the vortex dynamics, and there is a peak in rms temperature inside and outside the flame, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{downwards}} co-current gas-liquid <b>annular</b> <b>flows</b> {{inside a}} vertically oriented pipe have been experimentally investigated. The measurements and characterisation were performed using advanced optical non-intrusive laser-based techniques, namely Laser Induced Fluorescence, and Particle Image/Tracking Velocimetry. The investigated conditions {{were in the}} range of ReL = 306 – 1, 532 and ReG = 0 – 84, 600. Temporal film thickness time traces were constructed using the Laser Induced Fluorescence images. Based on these, the wave frequency was evaluated using direct wave counting approach and power spectral density analysis. Additionally, qualitative PIV observations revealed the presence of recirculation zones within a wave front of disturbance waves...|$|R
