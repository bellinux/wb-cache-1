A twenty-minute online reveal was hosted <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> later. On 27 October 2016, Watch Dogs 2 was announced to have been released to manufacturing.|$|E
5|$|French forces invaded Malta in June 1798, and the Order capitulated after <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days.</b> The French {{occupied}} the island until September, when the Maltese rebelled and blockaded the French {{forces in the}} harbour area with foreign help. The Floriana Lines remained under French control throughout the blockade, and the Maltese built Tas-Samra Battery and a battery on Corradino in order to bombard them.|$|E
5|$|In mid-July, Dohna and Saltykov {{spent a week}} feinting {{with each}} other as Saltykov drew closer to the Prussian border. On 14 July, he turned southwest, making for the Oder river, somewhere between Crossen and Glogau.

Electrolyte and blood gases were followed al {{least three times}} a day in all patients. The enrolled patients were divided into the normal-dose group and low-dose group. Any complications, especially serum sodium level, renal function and neurological outcome were compared.|$|R

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> {{before the}} Varsity Match, {{talk in the}} press had been of Geen's likely {{selection}} for England for the forthcoming Home Nations Championship. Geen and Poulton, who together were considered the scoring force of the Oxford team, were both selected to play for England in the second trial match against The North in Leeds. Although Geen scored a try in the game, his form was lacking and he was outshone by Poulton. So for {{the third and final}} trial, England versus The Rest on 7 January 1911, Geen was not selected.|$|E
5|$|Almost a year later, in August 1981, Voyager 2 {{continued}} {{the study of}} the Saturn system. More close-up images of Saturn's moons were acquired, as well as evidence of changes in the atmosphere and the rings. Unfortunately, during the flyby, the probe's turnable camera platform stuck for <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> and some planned imaging was lost. Saturn's gravity was used to direct the spacecraft's trajectory towards Uranus.|$|E

5|$|Along the Humboldt, {{the group}} met Paiute Native Americans, who joined them for <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> but stole or shot several oxen and horses. By now, {{it was well}} into October, and the Donner {{families}} split off to make better time. Two wagons in the remaining group became tangled, and John Snyder angrily beat the ox of Reed's hired teamster Milt Elliott. When Reed intervened, Snyder turned the whip on him. Reed retaliated by fatally plunging a knife under Snyder's collarbone.|$|E
5|$|And by {{the time}} they got it all {{organized}} and figured out, there were really only a couple of songs left for me to do anything on. So I came into L.A. for <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> and Kasim... came in, as was the routine, and we did maybe three songs... just so that I’d have a few fingerprints on the record. I think someone, maybe Meat Loaf, said that to keep everything covered, I had to be in there somewhere... but not necessarily running the whole thing. So my involvement was pretty much peripheral.|$|E
5|$|At {{the outset}} of the war, Australia's economy had been quite small and {{dependent}} largely upon agriculture and the resources industries for export earnings, while most manufactured products were imported from overseas. Almost immediately uncertainty over the continuation of foreign trade led to a rise in unemployment, indeed it was estimated that after only <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> of Britain having declared war, that up to 15,000 men had been retrenched in New South Wales alone due to concerns about the continued availability of foreign markets for Australian produce.|$|E

5|$|Cristina Kirchner {{was elected}} deputy for the provincial {{legislature}} of Santa Cruz in 1989.

5|$|Ike {{reported}} {{in his testimony}} afterward that Wyatt Earp cursed him. He said Wyatt, Virgil and Morgan offered him his rifle and to fight him {{right there in the}} courthouse, which Ike declined. Ike also denied ever threatening the Earps. Ike was fined $25 plus court costs and after paying the fine left unarmed. Virgil told Ike he would leave Ike's confiscated rifle and revolver at the Grand Hotel, which was favored by Cowboys when in town. Ike testified that he picked up the weapons from William Soule, the jailer, <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> later.|$|E
5|$|In March 2009, Wagner {{supposedly}} {{announced that}} Sarcófago would reunite, and their tour itinerary would include appearances at the Wacken Open Air and Hole in the Sky festivals, {{as well as}} dates in London, New York, Los Angeles and Tokyo. He stated {{it would be the}} original I.N.R.I. line-up, but that this would be the only tour they would be doing {{and there would be no}} new material. <b>A</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> later, Lamounier himself wrote to the music press exposing this news report as a hoax.|$|E
25|$|In {{his second}} year at Cambridge, Woods {{continued}} his good bowling form from the previous season. He picked up five first innings wickets in his second match of the year, against the Marylebone Cricket Club, and in his next match <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>day</b> later, achieved his best bowling analysis in an innings to that point, claiming eight wickets against AJ Webbe's XI. He claimed another eleven wickets in the match against Yorkshire, taking five in the first innings and six in the second. Despite his wicket taking, Cambridge only won three of their seven first-class encounters {{in the run-up to}} facing Oxford, and the last of those came without Woods in the side. Nevertheless, they entered the fixture with better results than Oxford, who had lost six of their seven matches. Woods proved one of the deciding factors, claiming eleven wickets in the match, of which seven were bowled, and two were in combination with wicket-keeper Gregor MacGregor. Cambridge opening batsman Henry Mordaunt scored 127 in the match, and they secured an innings victory, requiring just two of the three allocated days.|$|R

5|$|Peak {{benefits}} achieved for generalized {{anxiety disorder}} (GAD) may take up to a week. Tolerance to the anxiolytic and antipanic effects is controversial, with only some authoritative sources supporting the development of tolerance; tolerance will, however, develop to the sedative and hypnotic effects within <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days.</b> Withdrawal symptoms or rebound symptoms may occur after ceasing treatment abruptly following a few weeks or longer of steady dosing, and may necessitate a gradual dose reduction. Other risks include increased rates of suicide, possibly due to disinhibition.|$|E
5|$|Prior {{to a new}} hotel {{opening on}} Amity Island, an {{enormous}} great white shark ambushes and kills two divers who are photographing {{the wreck of the}} Orca. <b>A</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> later, their camera is recovered, and the shark goes after a female water skier and speedboat driver, killing the skier, while the driver fends off the shark using a gas tank and flare gun, causing the boat to explode, which kills her and severely burns the shark's face.|$|E
5|$|The French evicted the Order from Malta {{during the}} Mediterranean {{campaign}} of 1798, and the Order surrendered after <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days.</b> The Maltese, although initially welcoming the French occupiers, rebelled {{after a couple}} of months due to a number of reforms and the looting of churches. The insurgents took control of Gozo which became briefly independent, as well as Mdina and the towns and villages of the main island, leaving the French blockaded in the well-defended harbour area.|$|E
60|$|The session wore along monotonously--at {{least to}} those who like Bradley took no {{interest}} in the bitter partisan wrangling--and suddenly it came upon him that spring was near. There came <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> sunny <b>days</b> after three <b>days</b> <b>of</b> warm rain and the grass grew suddenly green. A robin hunting worms on the lawn laughed out audaciously one morning as Bradley went across the path. There seemed to be a mysterious awakening thrill in every plant and animal. The distant hills grew soft in outline.|$|R
50|$|Annually, the Festa da Lira Fraternal Calhetense on {{the second}} weekend of July, is a {{consequence}} of the elevated stature of this institution to the community.

50|$|In {{the season}} of 2006-07, Highbury {{expanded}} to become a 3 team club. To ensure the quality rose with the quantity, Highbury travelled to the Netherlands once again to compete in an outdoor tournament but this time took in <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> extra <b>days</b> {{to participate in a}} training camp run for Highbury's benefit by Mart Huijbregts. Highbury looked internally to strengthen its coaching staff base and subsidised that attendance of two of its members to the annual Avon Tyrell Level 2 Coaching Qualification course.|$|R
5|$|The {{result of}} this {{certainty}} was that the investigation was poorly conducted. The crime scene was not secured and searched thoroughly, and evidence was not recorded or preserved. Within <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days,</b> the police had burned the bloodstained bedding and carpets, apparently to spare Bamber's feelings. The scenes-of-crime officer moved the murder weapon without wearing gloves, {{and it was not}} examined for fingerprints until weeks later. Three days after the killings, Bamber and the extended family were given back the keys to the house.|$|E
5|$|Wasps in {{the genus}} Sphecius are not habitually {{aggressive}} {{and use their}} venom mainly to paralyse cicadas which they take back to their nests to feed their young. The females catch around four or more cicadas for provisioning, place them in brood cells and lay eggs in the cells. S.grandis is endemic to Central America, Mexico and the Western United States, and is found at a higher mean altitude than other species of Sphecius. The western cicada killer males emerge earlier than females, but generally die after only <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days.</b>|$|E
5|$|A cold usually {{begins with}} fatigue, {{a feeling of}} being chilled, sneezing, and a headache, {{followed}} in <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>days</b> by a runny nose and cough. Symptoms may begin within sixteen hours of exposure and typically peak two to four days after onset. They usually resolve in seven to ten days, but some can last for up to three weeks. The average duration of cough is eighteen days and in some cases people develop a post-viral cough which can linger after the infection is gone. In children, the cough lasts for more than ten days in 35–40% of cases and continues for more than 25 days in 10%.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{introduces}} a technique for the enhanced processing of TOPSAR data. It {{is based on}} repeated passes of the sensor over the same area and is aimed at obtaining "enhanced resolution" images of coherent scatterers in the scene by combining two "de-synchronized" acquisitions, useless for interferometric purposes. The paper introduces the STAGTOPS concept and provides a first demonstration exploiting <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> 12 <b>days</b> apart Sentinel- 1 A TOPSAR IW images with a synchronization issue. The proposed technique could be further tested by exploiting the novel Sentinel- 1 B sensor (launch 25 th April 2016), reducing the revisit time to 6 days...|$|R
