40|$|Pyrolysis plays a {{major role}} in the {{optimization}} of process efficiency and gas quality in two-stage gasifiers. We developed an original reactor at pilot scale to investigate continuous fixed bed pyrolysis, in either <b>allothermal</b> or autothermal operating mode using air injection. Instrumentation and analysis enabled thermal profiles to be established inside the bed along with fine measurement of yields, char composition, permanent gases, and compounds at the outlet of the pyrolysis reactor. Under oxidative conditions, fixed-bed pyrolysis led to smoldering and the stabilization of an ignition front between 10 and 20 cm below the bed surface. With oxidative pyrolysis, yields of organic condensates were lower than with <b>allothermal</b> pyrolysis, whereas the production of pyrolysis water and permanent gases increased considerably. The main conclusion is that during autothermal pyrolysis in fixed-bed conditions, the presence of oxygen promotes oxidation of volatile matter and cracking reactions, thereby increasing the production of pyrolysis water and permanent gases. We observed a significant increase in yields of CO 2 and CO, while the yield of char remained comparable to that in <b>allothermal</b> experiments. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

An alternative is using biomass as a renewable energy resource to achieve both effects. For this reason, interest in biomass gasification processes resurged considerably in the past years.

The feed material was Greek lignite (Megalopolis), currently being employed for electricity generation in pulverized lignite-fired thermoelectric stations. Low energy conversion efficiency, low station availability, and environmental issues call for developing improved processes, e. g., an IGCC (Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle). An indirect heat (<b>allothermal)</b> rotary kiln {{was selected as the}} lignite gasification reactor for developing an overall gasification process of improved efficiency.

This work investigates the integration of a near atmospheric solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with a novel <b>allothermal</b> biomass steam gasification process into a combined heat and power (CHP) system of less than MW, range. Heat for steam gasification is supplied from SOFC depleted fuel in a fluidised bed (FB) combustor via high temperature sodium heat pipes.

40|$|Miscanthus×giganteus (M×G), {{a typical}} {{bioenergy}} crop, {{has been widely}} planted in Ireland. But the virgin miscanthus is considered as a low grade fuel. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate a method to (a) upgrade the fuel properties of raw miscanthus via torrefaction; (b) compare the gasification of raw and torrefied M×G in the <b>allothermal</b> air-blown bubbling fluidized bed gasifier. The M×G was, firstly, torrefied at a series of temperatures from 230 to 290 oC for residence times varying from 10 to 30 min. The torrified biomass showed reduced moisture and hemicellulose content a lower ratio of O/C, a more porous structure with larger specific surface area as well as higher mass ratio of alkali metals. All these features have positive effect on gasification reactivity. The optimal process conditions for torrefaction of M×G are: 250 °C and 30 min from which condition the torrefied M×G had a mass yield of 71. 6 %, energy yield of 85. 1 % and higher heating value of 21. 81 MJ/kg. Its reactivity was higher than other torrefied samples and then that of raw M×G. A preliminary gasification campaign was carried out in an onsite <b>allothermal</b> air-blown bubbling fluidized bed (BFB) gasifier using raw M×G as feedstock and magnesite as bed material. The effect of equivalence ratio (ER) (0. 234 − 0. 372) and bed temperature (645 − 726 °C) on the performance of gasification was investigated. The results showed that the optimal ER and temperature were approximately 0. 262 and 645 °C (in this study). The product gas from this condition had a higher heating value of 6. 27 MJ/m 3, a gas yield of 1. 65 N m 3 /kgbiomass (including N 2), a carbon conversion efficiency of 94. 81 % and a hot gasification efficiency of 78. 76 %. The agglomeration was observed at higher temperature tests. The next stage of research involved comparing the gasification of raw and torrefied M×G. The experiments were conducted in an <b>allothermal</b> air-blown BFB gasifier using olivine as bed material at ECN in Netherlands. The optimal ER for the raw and torrefied M×G were 0. 22 and 0. 21 respectively. Both raw and torrefied materials had the same optimal temperature (800 oC). The risk of agglomeration seems inevitable if the temperature was increased higher than 800 oC. The comparison of raw and torrefied M×G gasification from their optimal conditions revealed that there was no significant difference between the raw and torrefied M×G gasification from the perspective of product gas quality. The gasification performance of raw M×G was slightly better than that of torrefied biomass. It probably could be attributed to the short retention time and high char elutriation rate for the torrefied M×G gasification. However, the value of torrefaction should not be ignored. Torrefaction makes it possible to use low grade biomass in the existing energy producing systems which in turn promotes the use of renewable energy and ease the impact of greenhouse gas emission. Overall, the results reveal that M×G is a promising candidate for energy production via BFB gasification. Torrefaction is a promising thermal pretreating method to improve the fuel properties for the thermo-chemical converting process...|$|E

However, the technical options for the reduction of CO 2 emissions will define the extent of their share in the future energy mix. The production of synthetic or substitute natural gas (SNG) from solid fossil fuels seems to be a very attractive process: coal and lignite can be upgraded into a methane rich gas which can be transported and further used in high efficient power systems coupled with CO 2 sequestration technologies. The aim of this paper is to present a modeling analysis comparison between substitute natural gas production from coal by means of <b>allothermal</b> steam gasification and autothermal oxygen gasification. In order to produce SNG from syngas several unit operations are required such as syngas cooling, cleaning, potential compression and, of course, methanation reactors. Finally the gas which is produced has to be conditioned i. e. removal of unwanted species, such as CO 2 etc. The heat recovered from the overall process is utilized by a steam cycle, producing power. These processes were modeled with the computer software IPSEpro™. An energetic and exergetic analysis of the coal to SNG processes have been realized and compared. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|This article summarises {{the results}} from the study "Hy-NOW". It covers the technical, {{economic}} and environmental performance of 3 selected concepts for the production and distribution of hydrogen from biomass. Firstly, the 3 concepts are selected based on the prerequisite, that they are suitable to be implemented in a demonstration plant within the short to medium term. 2 of the concepts are based on the <b>allothermal</b> gasification of biomass while the third is based on the steam reforming of biomethane. The results of the technical assessment show advantages for the gasification-based concepts in terms of their net biomass conversion efficiency. The economic assessment then shows the specific provision costs for the 3 concepts. The large-scaled gasification-based concept and the fermentation-based concept boast specific biohydrogen production costs of around 4 EUR/kg H- 2. The small-scaled gasification-based concept leads to higher costs of around 6. 3 EUR/kg H- 2. With 30 - 40 % of the total provision costs, the distribution presents a substantial cost item. The gasification-based concepts both have greenhouse gas emissions of around 4 kg CO 2 -Equivalents/kg H- 2, while the fermentation-based concept has emissions of around 5 kg CO 2 -Equivalents/kg H- 2. The distribution of the biohydrogen produces more emissions than the provision of biomass and its conversion to biohydrogen combined...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{process of}} {{converting}} a solid carbonaceous fuel into a gaseous energy carrier in {{presence of a}} gasifying medium at high temperature is called gasification. The resulting gaseous energy carrier, known as producer gas, is more versatile in its use than the original solid fuel. Gasification is widely considered as a more efficient and less polluting initial thermochemical upstream process of converting biomass to electricity. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the process of <b>allothermal</b> steam gasification in a fixed-bed downdraft gasifier for improved quality (HHV, high hydrogen content) of the producer gas generated. The study involved thermodynamic equilibrium modeling based on equilibrium approach in which the concentrations of the gaseous components in the producer gas at equilibrium temperature are determined based on balancing the moles in the overall gasification equation. The results obtained suggest that the maximum equilibrium yield of producer gas with high energy density is attained at a gasification temperature of around 820 oC and a steam/biomass ratio of 0. 825 mol/mol. The equilibrium yield was richer in hydrogen at 52. 23 %vol, and with a higher heating value of 11. 6 MJ/Nm 3. Preliminary validation of the model results using experimental data from literature shows a close relationship. The study has further shown the advantage of using steam as a gasifying medium towards the improved quality of the producer ga...|$|E
40|$|Biomass {{gasification}} {{derived fuel}} gas is a renewable fuel {{that can be}} used by high temperature fuel cells. In this two-part work an attempt is made to investigate the integration of a near atmospheric pressure solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with a novel <b>allothermal</b> biomass steam gasification process into a combined heat and power (CHP) system of less than MWe nominal output range. Heat for steam gasification is supplied from SOFC depleted fuel into a fluidised bed combustor via high temperature sodium heat pipes. The integrated system model was built in Aspen Plus (TM) simulation software and is described in detail. Part I investigates the feasibility and critical aspects of the system based on modelling results. A low gasification steam to biomass ratio (STBR= 0. 6) is used to avoid excess heat demands and to allow effective H 2 S high temperature removal. Water vapour is added prior to the anode to avoid carbon deposition. The SOFC off gases adequately provide gasification heat when fuel utilisation factors are < 0. 75; otherwise extra biomass must be combusted with overall efficiency penalty. For SOFC operation with U-f = 0. 7 and current density 2500 A m(- 2) the electrical efficiency is estimated at 36 % while thermal efficiency at 14 %. An exergy analysis is presented in Part II.

40|$|The {{results on}} the {{gasification}} of Greek lignite using two indirect heat (<b>allothermal)</b> pilot rotary kiln gasifiers are reported in the present work. The development of this new reactor-gasifier concept intended for solid fuels chemical conversion exploits data and experience gained from the following two pilot plants. The first unit A (about 100 kg/h raw lignite) demonstrated {{the production of a}} medium heating value gas (12 - 13 MJ/Nm 3) with quite high DAF (dry ash free) coal conversions, in an indirect heat rotary gasifier under mild temperature and pressure conditions. The second unit B is a small pilot size unit (about 10 kg/h raw lignite) comprises an electrically heated rotary kiln, is an operation flexible and exhibits effective phase mixing and enhanced heat transfer characteristics. Greek lignite pyrolysis and gasification data were produced from experiments performed with pilot plant B and the results are compared with those of a theoretical model. The model assumes a scheme of three consecutive-partly parallel processes (i. e. drying, pyrolysis, and gasification) and predicts DAF lignite conversion and gas composition in relatively good agreement with the pertinent experimental data typical of the rotary kiln gasifier performance. Pilot plant B is currently being employed in lime-enhanced gasification studies aiming at the production of hydrogen enriched synthesis gas. Presented herein are two typical gas compositions obtain from lignite gasification runs in the presence or not of lime. ...|$|E
40|$|A novel BaO-based sorbent {{is tested}} for in situ {{application}} as desulfurization agent in an <b>allothermal</b> biomass gasification process. BaO is stabilized against {{the formation of}} carbonate and thus theoretically allows desulfurization down to a few parts per million (volume) (ppmv) H 2 S even for high-steam and high-temperature conditions. In real process application, sintering of the sorbent occurred {{and had to be}} prevented by the addition of lime as separating agent. Additionally, a kinetic limitation of the desulfurization with BaO was shown for the in-bed sorption of sulfur. An increase of gasification temperature from 760 to 810 °C significantly improved the desulfurization performance. The observed behavior is in contrast to that of previously tested CaO-based in situ sorbents. CaO-based in situ desulfurization is limited to values of about 500 ppmv H 2 S for the conditions prevailing in the gasifier. With the novel BaO-based sorbent, a desulfurization from 85 to 35 ppmv residual H 2 S is shown upon addition of the sorbent to the gasifier. In experiments with a combined desulfurization of CaO and BaO, a release of H 2 S from CaS was shown once the H 2 S content in the gas drops below the CaO-based steady-state equilibrium of desulfurization. Particle analysis via SEM-EDX, XRD, ICP-OES, and BET complement the results of in situ desulfurization. SEM-EDX results indicate the stabilization of BaO in sintering bridges and a certain depletion of barium from the sorbent after in-bed application...|$|E
