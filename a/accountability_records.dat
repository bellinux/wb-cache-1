40|$|Public-private {{partnerships}} (PPP) {{have been}} advanced {{as a new}} tool of global governance, which can supply both effective and legitimate governance. In the context of recent debates on the democratic legitimacy of transnational governance, this paper focuses on accountability as a central component of legitimacy. The aim {{of this paper is}} to map transnational climate partnerships and evaluate their <b>accountability</b> <b>record</b> in terms of transparency, monitoring mechanisms and representation of stakeholders. Three types of partnerships are identified with respect to their degree of public-private interaction: public-private (hybrid), governmental and private-private. Most of the climate partnerships have functions of advocacy, service provision and implementation. None are standard setting, which indicates that governmental actors are less willing to "contract out" rule-setting authority to private actors in the climate change. Some partnerships, such as the World Summit on Sustainable Development climate partnerships and Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects represent "new" modes of hybrid governance with high degree of public-private interaction. However, many partnerships, not least the voluntary technology agreements such as the APP, rest on "old" form of governance based on the logic of lobbying, corporatism, co-optation and interstate bargaining. Private (business-to business) climate partnerships are to varying degrees geared toward quantitative targets in the Kyoto Protocol. The <b>accountability</b> <b>record</b> is higher for hybrid climate partnerships, such as the CDM, due to extensive reporting and monitoring mechanisms, while lower for the governmental networks, such as voluntary technology agreements. Partnerships do not necessarily replace or erode the authority of sovereign states, but rather propels the hybridization and transformation of authority that is increasingly shared between state and nonstate actors.

Records authenticity guarantees the content has not been changed, altered or manipulated since their first creation through out their life cycle. Managing trusted electronic records is becoming an emerging issue to many organizations today. With the rapid growth of electronic communications and information systems, electronic records have presented new challenges in ensuring the survival of reliable and authentic records over time. The primary goal {{of this study is to}} establish and develop a robust framework for trusted electronic records management. A multiple case studies approach is utilized to examine the electronic records practices in six (6) Malaysian Government-Controlled Companies (MGCC).

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} explore the {{relationships}} among competitive viability, <b>accountability</b> and <b>record</b> keeping in private sector entities. These relationships are explored both theoretically and empirically using {{a case study of}} Jamaican commercial bank failures. The study builds upon earlier research on the relationship between record keeping and public sector reform initiatives in Africa, which found that poor record keeping has undermined the success of these initiatives. The study aims to show how poor record keeping similarly can undermine the competitive viability of private sector entities and thereby economic development initiatives dependent on the private sector. The study employs a Grounded Theory-based methodology using data on Jamaican commercial bank failures to develop a theoretical argument for linkages among competitive viability, <b>accountability</b> and <b>record</b> keeping. The study argues that effective <b>records</b> <b>accountabilities</b> and controls are critical to the operation of accountability systems that provide the basis for internal control and sound decision-making in private sector entities. When accountability systems are weakened because of ineffective record keeping, management is unable to access information needed to maintain operational control and make sound decisions. This leaves the business weakened and vulnerable to collapse. The study illustrates this dynamic with reference to the failure of several Jamaican commercial banks, showing how an absence of effective records controls undermined the quality and availability of accounting and management information in these banks which, in turn, weakened the systems of accountability that the banks' directors, managers and supervisors relied upon to manage and control the banks balance sheets and business risks.

40|$|The {{cumulative}} {{effects of a}} significantly changing climate are projected to have disastrous implications on the world’s natural habitats, and along with that, are projected to drastically increase the rate and likelihood of violent conflict globally, particularly in high-density, urban, poverty hotspots. Limiting {{the effects of a}} changing climate is thus critical in influencing multiple societal goals including equitable sustainable development, human health, biodiversity, food security and access to reliable energy sources. This paper argues that the G 7 / 8 has led global climate governance in ways other international environmental institu­tions have largely failed to do. It has done so largely by placing climate protection at the forefront of its policy objectives, alongside economic, health, energy and security goals, and reaching consensus repeatedly amongst its leaders on the impor­tance of stabilizing emissions through energy efficiency, conservation, investment and technological innovation. Moreover, this chapter argues that the summit’s predominant capability, its constricted participation, democratic convergence and political cohesion – as well as the combined effects of global shocks – have all had positive impacts on the G 7 / 8 ’s success in mitigating climate change. Following a detailed process-tracing exercise over the summit’s 40 -year history in which clear surges and retreats on global climate governance are outlined, this paper concludes by assessing the G 7 / 8 ’s <b>accountability</b> <b>record</b> on climate mitigation and outlines a set of prescriptive recommendations, allowing for the delivery of a more tangible, coherent, results-driven accountability process for global climate governance...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to re-visit debates around <b>accountability,</b> {{openness}} and <b>record</b> keeping and to suggest that existing assumptions need to be challenged. Design/methodology/approach: – This is a scholarly essay based on published and unpublished works. The focus is on parliamentary democracies where the Queen or a titular president is head of state. Findings: The primary role of records managers as active citizens should be to provide systems that will enable others to discharge their duties. The primary role of archivists in a plural democracy should be to secure the record for the future. The notion that archivists need to protect the record from political pressure should be re-considered. A more pressing need is for political pressure to be applied at the highest level, to ensure that there is a record. Research limitations/implications: – The research has been limited by the fact that the author has not had access to the Cabinet Office. Social implications: If the upper echelons of the British Government are to function effectively then the collapse of proper procedures and proper record keeping described by Tony Blair needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.

However, {{little is known about the}} effectiveness of different internal controls. We investigate whether the duty to sign work results-one of the most prominent internal control mechanisms-is effective to prevent fraud under different superior instructions. We use a 2 × 2 between-subjects experimental design with accountability (duty to sign work results vs. no duty to sign) and superior instructions (with vs. without profit maximization cue) as independent variables. Both manipulations of superior instructions reminded people to respect accounting standards and principles but in one condition, an instruction to increase revenues was integrated as profit maximization cue. We expected this cue to trigger a profit maximization decision frame that increases the likelihood for fraudulent revenue recording. 58 managers from an executive MBA class participated in the experiment. We find that superior instructions interact with <b>accountability.</b> Fraudulent revenue <b>recording</b> was particularly observed when people received instructions to increase revenues and had to sign their work results. Consequently, fraudulent behavior can occur without pressure to commit fraud due to profit maximization cues that are communicated by a superior and despite implemented internal control mechanisms.
