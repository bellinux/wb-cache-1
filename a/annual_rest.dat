Kita et Fukuyo (cyst genus Impagidinium) and Gonyaulax spinifera (Clap. et J. Lachm.) Diesing (cyst genus Nematosphaeropsis) was enhanced with increasing upper water nutrient and trace-element concentrations. Cyst production of Lingulodinium polyedrum (F. Stein) J. D. Dodge was the highest at the transition between upwelling and upwelling-relaxation. Cyst production of Protoperidinium americanum (Gran et Braarud) Balech, Protoperidinium monospinum (Paulsen) K. A. F. Zonn. et B. Dale, and Protoperidinium stellatum (D. Wall) Balech, and heterotrophic dinoflagellates forming Brigantedinium spp. and Echinidinium aculeatum Zonn., increased most pronouncedly during upwelling episodes. Production of Protoperidinium conicum (Gran) Balech and Protoperidinium pentagonum (Gran) Balech cysts and total diatom valves were related, providing evidence of a predator-prey relationship. The export cyst-flux of E. aculeatum, P. americanum, P. monospinum, and P. stellatum was strongly linked to the flux of total diatom valves and CaCO 3, whereas the export production of Echinidinium granulatum Zonn. and Protoperidinium subinerme (Paulsen) A. R. Loebl. correlated with total organic carbon, suggesting potential consumption of diatoms, prymnesiophytes, and organic matter, respectively. Sinking velocities were at least 274 m · d**- 1, which is in range of the diatom- and coccolith-based phytoplankton aggregates and "slower" fecal pellets.

40|$|Approved, W. L. Howard. "Typescript. Phographs {{and charts}} pasted in. Includes bibliographical references. It {{is a matter}} of common {{knowledge}} that most of our woody plants do not grow continuously throughout the year. The fact is brought to our attention especially in spring, when we may observe the awakening of the vegetation which has been dormant for some time. After the buds open, leaves and twigs continue to grow rather rapidly. Sooner or later, however, vegetative activity diminishes and finally ceases when the terminal buds are formed. The plants are gradually preparing to go into their rest period. What causes this annual suspension of growth? Is it due simply to the lack of suitable external growth conditions? Since the rest period of most of the woody plants happens to fall during winter when temperature and other factors are unfavorable for growth, we are liable to be led to believe that the <b>annual</b> <b>rest</b> is caused simply by external influences. If there is such a simple relation as this between winter and the occurrence of the rest period, then we should not expect plants to suspend vegetative activity if growth conditions remained favorable through the year.

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThe {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the genotype-phenotype {{relation}} with respect to penetrance, age and severity of expression, disease progression and prognosis in a recessively inherited arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). BACKGROUNDNaxos disease is a recessively inherited ARVC caused by a mutation in the gene encoding plakoglobin (cell adhesion protein) in which the cardiac phenotype is associated with palmoplantar keratoderma and woolly hair. METHODSTwelve families with Naxos disease underwent cardiac and molecular genetic investigation. Serial cardiac assessment with <b>annual</b> <b>resting</b> 12 -lead and 24 -h ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) and two-dimensional echocardiography was performed during 1 to 16 years, median 7 ± 6 years in all 78 surviving members. RESULTSTwenty-eight surviving members were homozygous and 40 were heterozygous for the mutation. All adults who were homozygous (n = 26) fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for ARVC, the youngest by the age of 13 years. In eight who were heterozygous, minor ECG or echocardiographic abnormalities were observed. Of the 26 subjects who were affected homozygotes, 92 % showed ECG abnormalities, 92 % ventricular arrhythmias, 100 % right ventricular structural alterations and 27 % left ventricular involvement. During follow-up (10 ± 6 years), 16 (62 %) developed structural progression, 12 (46 %) arrhythmic events and 7 (27 %) heart failure. The annual disease-related and sudden death mortality was 3 % and 2. 3 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONSAutosomal recessive ARVC caused by a mutation in plakoglobin was 100 % penetrant by adolescence.

50|$|Leaveism (Leavism) {{is a term}} first coined in 2013 by Dr Ian Hesketh, a {{researcher}} at Lancaster University Management School in the UK, to describe the phenomena of employees using flexitime, <b>annual</b> leave, <b>rest</b> days and other leave entitlement schemes to have time off {{when they are in}} fact too unwell to go to work.

The I 1 year incidence rate of complete block was 5. 1 % for men with baseline incomplete block and 0. 7 % for those without. Complete block developed in 2 of 220 incident cases of incomplete block but in none of the 440 control men matched by age and duration of follow-up.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. Background The British Social Attitudes (BSA) survey series began in 1983. The series is designed to produce annual measures of attitudinal movements which will complement large-scale government surveys such as the General Lifestyle Survey and the Labour Force Survey (held under GN 33090 and GN 33246 respectively), which deal largely with facts and behaviour patterns, {{as well as the}} data on party political attitudes produced by the polls. One of its main purposes is to allow the monitoring of patterns of continuity and change, and the examination of the relative rates at which attitudes, in respect of a range of social issues, change over time. Some questions are asked regularly, others less often. Funding for BSA comes a number of sources (including government departments, the Economic and Social Research Council and other research foundations), but final responsibility for the coverage and wording of the <b>annual</b> questionnaires <b>rests</b> with NatCen Social Research (formerly Social and Community Planning Research). The BSA has been conducted every year since 1983, except in 1988 and 1992 when core funding was devoted to the British Election Study (BES). Further information about the series and links to publications may be found on the NatCen Social Research British Social Attitudes web page. In addition, a compilation of BSA data and documentation, including interactive descriptive statistics, is available via the BritSoCat web site, maintained by the Centre for Comparative European Survey Data. International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) The ISSP is run by a group of research organisations in different countries (currently 48 countries), each of which undertakes to field annually an agreed module of questions on a chosen topic area. Since 1985, an ISSP module has been included in {{one or more of the}} BSA self-completion questionnaires. Each module is chosen for repetition at intervals to allow comparisons both between countries and over time. See the ISSP catalogue record for further details, held under SN 7259. During 2009, a sub-sample of 30 respondents to the BSA 2008 were also interviewed for a qualitative study, held under SN 6616 - Attitudes to Genetically Modified Foods, 2009. Main Topics : The BSA questionnaire normally comprises two parts, one administered face-to-face and one for self-completion (since 1985, one of the self-completion option questionnaires includes the ISSP module). Each year the interview questionnaire contains a number of 'core' questions, which are repeated in most years. In addition, a wide range of background and classificatory questions is included. The remainder of the questionnaire is devoted to a series of questions (modules) on a range of social, economic, political and moral issues - some asked regularly, others less often. Cross-indexes of those questions asked more than once appear in the reports. The BSA 2008 questionnaires included modules covering: attitudes to health, social welfare, transport, religion and faith, education, food technology and national identity. Versions A and B of the self-completion questionnaire included a module of questions about religion, which comprised the 2008 ISSP component. <br...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (PhD(Agric) (Horticulture)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. Lack {{of winter}} {{chilling}} {{is a major}} problem in producing temperate-zone fruit in warm climates. Delayed foliation and protracted bud burst and flowering are the main problems necessitating artificial means to break dormancy. In South Africa (SA), most apple production areas receive insufficient winter chilling, and an <b>annual</b> application of <b>rest</b> breaking (RB) agents is included as standard practice. The most used RB agent in SA was dinitro-o-cresol (DNOC) but its use was discontinued. Hydrogen cyanamide (HC) became the replacement. It has been effective in apple, but variable effects on fruit set, blossom, yield and fruit quality have been reported. Thidiazuron (TDZ) has also shown the ability to break dormancy in apples. Another important practice in apple production is chemical thinning (CT). However, results are highly influenced by the type of chemical, weather conditions, cultivar and blossom pattern. With the increasing efficacy of RB and by identifying its effects on vegetative and reproductive development, {{it will be possible to}} determine more effective chemical thinning treatments. The objective of this study was to determine appropriate RB treatments for apple trees in a warm winter climate, identifying their effect on vegetative and reproductive development and the influence on CT efficacy. The research was performed in the Elgin area (34 °S, 300 m) SA, over a period of three years, on ‘Golden Delicious’ and ‘Royal Gala’. In evaluating the effect of different HC concentrations and oil, no synergistic or antagonistic effects were observed on budburst and yield. Mineral oil at 4 % plus 1 to 2 % Dormex® combined were sufficient to break dormancy. Dormex® at 4 % (2. 08 % HC) reduced fruit set and yield. In general, the rest breaking treatments (DNOC, HC and TDZ) enhanced the final vegetative bud burst compared to the control, while reproductive bud burst in 2002 and 2003 was not significantly influenced. The treatments compressed and advanced flowering periods, but this effect was not always evident when the spring was warm. The treatments synchronised flowering on the tree and between the two cultivars. The mixture of 0. 245 % HC and 4 % oil was less effective in terms of increasing bud burst in ‘Royal Gala’ compared to other rest-breaking treatments. The mixture of 0. 49 % HC and 4 % oil effectively compressed and synchronised flowering in ‘Golden Delicious’. TDZ-oil used at the lower rates also increased bud burst and concentrated flowering. However, it appears that after a cooler winter, higher rates could result in an exacerbated bud burst effect with excessive vegetative growth. The rate and timing of TDZ-oil application influenced the reproductive development of apples and therefore fruit quality. In ‘Golden Delicious’ increased fruit set, number of seeds, and reduced fruit russeting appear as beneficial results of TDZ-oil, whereas fruit set and russeting was not affected in ‘Granny Smith’. TDZ-oil, when applied late and at increasing rates, led to an increase in the malformation of calyx cavities, especially when chemical thinning was performed using the cytokinin-like compound benzyladenine. The effect seemed to be cultivar specific, with ‘Golden Delicious’ being the most severely affected. Increased return bloom in response to late TDZ application in ‘Golden Delicious’ and ‘Royal Gala’ appeared to be beneficial...|$|R
