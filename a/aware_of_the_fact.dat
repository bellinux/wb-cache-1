It was probably there that death squads were designated and assigned missions, leading {{to the murder of}} Mihai Stelescu, a former associate, in June of the next year.|$|E
5|$|Domitian's {{campaign}} against Dacia was overall unsuccessful; however, the Romans winning {{in a minor}} skirmish allowed him to claim it as a victory, even though he ended up paying the King of Dacia, Decebalus, an annual tribute of eight million sesterces in tribute to end the war. Domitian returned to Rome, and received an ovation, but not a full triumph. Considering that Domitian {{had been given the}} title of Imperator for military victories 22 times, this was markedly restrained, suggesting that the populace, or at least the senate, was <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that it had been a less than successful war, despite Domitian's claims otherwise. However, in 89AD, Domitian invaded the Iazyges, along with the Quadi and Marcomanni. Few details are known of this war, but it is recorded that the Romans were defeated.|$|E

Equality under the law was in their opinion not designed to correct the inexorable facts of the universe and to make natural inequality disappear. It was, on the contrary, the device to secure for the whole of mankind the maximum of benefits it can derive from it. Henceforth no man-made institutions should prevent a man from attaining that station in which he can best serve his fellow citizens.|$|E

25|$|Gestalt Therapy, an {{approach}} created by Fritz Perls, {{was based on}} phenomenology, existentialism and also Zen Buddhism and Taoism. Perls {{spent some time in}} Japanese Zen monasteries and his therapeutic techniques include mindfulness practices and focusing on the present moment. Practices outlined by Perls himself in Ego, hunger and aggression (1969), such as “concentration on eating” (“we have to be fully <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that we are eating”) and “awareness continuum” are strikingly similar to Buddhist mindfulness training. Other authors in Gestalt Therapy who were influenced by Buddhism are Barry Stevens (therapist) and Dick Price (who developed Gestalt Practice by including Buddhist meditation).|$|E
25|$|Unlike Italy, however, Germany did not {{strive to}} achieve full autarky, {{even though in}} May of 1933, Hitler’s regime had {{defaulted}} unilaterally on Germany’s foreign debt along with a decree for sweeping capital controls that {{made it difficult to}} engage in foreign trade. Hitler was <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that Germany lacked reserves of raw materials, and full autarky was therefore impossible. Thus he chose a different approach. The Nazi government tried {{to limit the number of}} its trade partners, and, when possible, only trade with countries within the German sphere of influence. A number of bilateral trade agreements were signed between Germany and other European countries (mostly countries located in Southern and South-Eastern Europe) during the 1930s. The German government strongly encouraged trade with these countries but strongly discouraged trade with any others.|$|E
25|$|By June 13, Russian {{units were}} {{back to their}} {{starting}} line. On June 19, the Russians launched another offensive. This time northwest to Lake Van. The Russians, under Oganovski, launched an offense into the hills west of Manzikert. The Russians underestimated {{the size of the}} Ottoman arm, and were surprised by a large Turkish force at the counterattack. Russian forces began to march from Manzikert towards Mush. However, they were not <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that the Turkish IX Corps, together with the 17th and 28th Divisions was moving to Mush as well. Although the conditions were extremely difficult, the Turks were executing a very efficient operation of reorganization. 1st and 5th Expeditionary Forces were positioned to the south of the Russian offensive force and a “Right Wing Group” was established under the command of Brigadier General Abdülkerim Paşa. This group was independent from the Third Army and Abdülkerim Paşa was directly reporting to Enver Paşa. The Turks were ready to face the Russian attacks.|$|E

The family lived near Windsor and had homes in London and at Callander in Perthshire, Scotland, where Dorothy spent days fishing in the River Teith and nearby Loch Lubnaig. Dorothy recounted in later life that a friend of her father (apparently Lewis Harcourt, later Lord Harcourt) attempted to sexually assault her when aged about 14-15, an experience to which she attributed her later fear and distrust of men.|$|R
