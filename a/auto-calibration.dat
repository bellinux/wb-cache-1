50|$|Camera <b>auto-calibration</b> {{is a form}} of sensor ego-structure discovery; the {{subjective}} effects of the sensor are separated from the objective effects of the environment leading to a reconstruction of the perceived world without the bias applied by the measurement device. This is achieved via the fundamental assumption that images are projected from a Euclidean space through a linear, 5 degree of freedom (in the simplest case), pinhole camera model with non-linear optical distortion. The linear pinhole parameters are the focal length, the aspect ratio, the skew, and the 2D principal point. With only a set of uncalibrated (or calibrated) images, a scene may be reconstructed up to a six degree of freedom euclidean transform and an isotropic scaling.|$|E
50|$|Multiplane {{calibration}} is {{a variant}} of camera <b>auto-calibration</b> that allows one to compute the parameters of a camera from two or more views of a planar surface. The seminal work in multiplane calibration is due to Zhang. Zhang's method calibrates cameras by solving a particular homogeneous linear system that captures the homographic relationships between multiple perspective views of the same plane. This multiview approach is popular because, in practice, it is more natural to capture multiple views of a single planar surface - like a chessboard - than to construct a precise 3D calibration rig, as required by DLT calibration. The following figures demonstrate a practical application of multiplane camera calibration from multiple views of a chessboard.|$|E

40|$|<b>Auto-calibration</b> is the {{recovery}} of the full camera geometry and Euclidean scene structure from several images of an unknown 3 D scene, using rigidity constraints and partial knowledge of the camera intrinsic parameters. It fails for certain special classes of camera motion. This paper derives necessary and sufficient conditions for unique <b>auto-calibration,</b> for several practically important cases where some of the intrinsic parameters are known (e. g. skew, aspect ratio) and others can vary (e. g. focal length). We introduce a novel subgroup condition on the camera calibration matrix, which helps to systematize this sort of <b>auto-calibration</b> problem. We show that for subgroup constraints, criticality is independent of the exact values of the intrinsic parameters and depends only on the camera motion.

30|$|This paper {{presented}} a novel two-step camera calibration method in a GPS/INS/Stereo camera integrated kinematic positioning and navigation system. The first step performs the camera <b>auto-calibration</b> for a stereo system by employing two scale-restraint equations to constrain the matched features from two consecutive stereo pairs. The lens distortion parameters, the up-to-scale baseline length {{and the relative}} orientation between the two cameras are estimated using the least-squares method. The second step performs system calibration where the <b>auto-calibration</b> estimates are fused with the blended GPS/INS solution to recover the camera lever-arms, the absolute scale of the camera and the bore-sight angles. The main advantage of the proposed novel method lies that it is free from landmark parameters and results in computation and memory savings. There are two main drawbacks in employing the scale-restraint equation over the collinearity equations for stereo <b>auto-calibration.</b> Firstly the accuracy cannot be increased by performing loop closures when the same scene is revisited. Secondly the scale-restraint equation is highly non-linear and therefore the LS estimator can diverge if a good approximation of the parameters is not available.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we propose}} a Bayesian {{approach}} for affine <b>auto-calibration.</b> By the Bayesian approach, a posterior {{distribution for the}} affine camera parameters can be constructed, where also the prior knowledge can be taken into account. Moreover, due to the linearity of the affine camera model, the structure and translations can be analytically marginalised out from the posterior distribution, if certain prior distributions are assumed. The marginalisation reduces the dimensionality of the problem substantially that makes the MCMC methods better suitable for exploring the posterior of the intrinsic camera parameters. The experiments verify that the proposed approach is a versatile, statistically sound alternative for the existing affine <b>auto-calibration</b> methods. ...|$|E

30|$|The {{traditional}} camera calibration {{consists of}} capturing images containing {{an array of}} the reference targets in a laboratory, whose coordinates are accurately known (Wolf and Dewitt 2000). However, these parameters can be invalidated during in-field operations, e.g., during camera assembly/disassembly, replacement, bumps (Teller et al. 2010) or significant temperature variations. Recently many developments {{have focused on the}} in-field camera <b>auto-calibration</b> (or self-calibration) for image-inertial systems. An <b>auto-calibration</b> refers to the determination of the camera parameters from a sequence of the overlapping images without necessarily setting up ground control points (GCPs) or special calibration targets. Typically, <b>auto-calibration</b> process is performed in a bundle adjustment (BA) (Triggs et al. 1999) or in the SLAM framework (Civera et al. 2009; Kelly and Sukhatme 2009; Kelly et al. 2011; Keivan and Sibley 2014). It involves the simultaneous estimation of the positions and orientations of the camera, the positions of the stationary landmarks, and the calibration parameters of the camera. The corresponding mathematical equation system, which models the parameters through the available measurements, is usually solved by using non-linear least-squares, the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm or a Kalman filter. These methods however are computationally expensive due to the very large number of landmark position parameters.|$|E

40|$|High quality on-line flow {{forecasts}} {{are useful}} for real-time operation of urban drainage systems and wastewater treatment plants. This requires computationally efficient models, which are continuously updated with observed data to provide good initial conditions for the forecasts. This paper presents a way of updating conceptual rainfall-runoff models using Maximum a Posteriori estimation to determine the most likely parameter constellation at the current point in time. This is done by combining information from prior parameter distributions and the model goodness of fit over a predefined {{period of time that}} precedes the forecast. The method is illustrated for an urban catchment, where flow forecasts of 0 – 4 h are generated by applying a lumped linear reservoir model with three cascading reservoirs. Radar rainfall observations are used as input to the model. The effects of different prior standard deviations and lengths of the <b>auto-calibration</b> period on the resulting flow forecast performance are evaluated. We were able to demonstrate that, if properly tuned, the method leads to a significant increase in forecasting performance compared to a model without continuous <b>auto-calibration.</b> Delayed responses and erratic behaviour in the parameter variations are, however, observed and the choice of prior distributions and length of <b>auto-calibration</b> period is not straightforward...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{the problem of}} Structure from Motion (SfM) for uncalibrated and unordered image {{collections}} is considered. The proposed framework is an adaptation of the framework for calibrated SfM proposed by Olsson-Enqvist (2011) to the uncalibrated case. Olsson-Enqvist's framework consists of three main steps; pairwise relative ro-tation estimation, rotation averaging, and geometry estimation with known rotations. For this to work with uncalibrated images we also perform <b>auto-calibration</b> during the first step. There is a well-known degeneracy for pairwise <b>auto-calibration</b> which occurs when the two principal axes meet in a point. This is unfortunately common for real images. To mitigate this the rotation estimation is instead performed by estimating image triplets. For image triplets the degenerate configurations {{are less likely to}} occur in practice. This is followed by estimation of the pairs which did not get a successful relative rotation from the previous step. The framework is successfully applied to an uncalibrated and unordered collec-tion of images of the cathedral in Lund. It is also applied to the well-known Oxford dinosaur sequence which consists of turntable motion. Image pairs from the turntable motion are in a degenerate configuration for <b>auto-calibration</b> since they both view the same point on the rotation axis...|$|E
