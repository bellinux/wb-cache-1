The flight computer receives information on external conditions such as the aircraft's current air speed and angle of attack via pitot-static sensing plates, as opposed to traditional pitot tubes which would negatively affect the aircraft's stealth capabilities. The flight <b>actuation</b> <b>system</b> incorporates both hydraulic and electrical servoactuated components, and it was designed {{with a high level of}} redundancy and fault-diagnostic capabilities.|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes and evaluates an {{adaptive}} technique and a variable structure control approach for piezoelectric <b>actuation</b> <b>systems</b> to track specified motion trajectories. The proposed control methodologies are formulated to accommodate unknown or uncertain system parameters, nonlinearities including the hysteresis effect, and external disturbances in the piezoelectric <b>actuation</b> <b>systems</b> without {{any form of}} feed-forward compensation. In this study, both control methodologies are demonstrated to possess a promising motion tracking ability experimentally. In comparison, the variable structure control approach is evaluated to be superior to the adaptive technique in the motion tracking control. With the ability to track motion trajectories under parametric uncertainties, nonlinearities, and external disturbances, the proposed control methodologies are very attractive in realising the high-precision piezoelectric <b>actuation</b> <b>systems</b> for micro/nano manipulation...|$|R
40|$|Micro/nano {{manipulation}} {{has been}} identified as one of the key enabling technologies for many emerging challenges. Within this scope, piezoelectric actuators have played major roles in achieving the required nano-resolution motion. This paper proposes a robust control framework for piezoelectric <b>actuation</b> <b>systems</b> to follow specified motion trajectories. The basic concept associated with this methodology lies in the specification of a target performance and the robust control scheme formulation for piezoelectric <b>actuation</b> <b>systems</b> to ensure the convergence of the position tracking error to zero. This control methodology is attractive as its implementation requires only the knowledge of the estimated system parameters and their corresponding bounds, including bound of hysteresis and external disturbances. Feasibility study of the framework for piezoelectric <b>actuation</b> <b>systems</b> in micro/nano manipulation is described. Simulation results validated the suitability of the proposed control approach...|$|R

2500|$|Gull-wing doors have a {{somewhat}} questionable reputation because of early examples like the Mercedes and the Bricklin. The 300 SL needed the door design as its tubular frame race car chassis design {{had a very}} high door sill, which in combination with a low roof would make a standard door opening very low and small. The Mercedes engineers solved the problem by also opening {{a part of the}} roof. The Bricklin was a more conventionally sized door but the <b>actuation</b> <b>system</b> was problematic in day-to-day use and led to unreliable operation until an aftermarket air-door upgrade was installed in all Bricklins. [...] In addition, there was some concern that in making the doors as light as possible they wouldn't provide adequate protection in side-impact accidents. There was, however, no indication that this concern was justified.|$|E
