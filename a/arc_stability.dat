This system consists of a welding carrier, a guide rail, an auto-control system, a welding source, a wire feeder, and so on. Welding experiments with this system were performed on the X- 80 pipeline steel to determine proper welding parameters. The welding technique comprises root welding, filling welding and cover welding and their welding parameters were obtained from experimental analysis. On this basis, the mechanical properties tests were carried out on welded joints in this case. Results show that this system can help improve the continuity and stability of the whole welding process and the welded joints' inherent quality, appearance shape, and mechanical performance can all meet the welding criteria for X- 80 pipeline steel; with no need for windbreak fences, the overall welding cost will be sharply reduced.

5|$|During the {{production}} of incandescent filaments, recrystallisation of tungsten is signifiantly lowered by adding small amounts of thorium dioxide to the tungsten sintering powder before drawing the filaments. A small addition of thorium to tungsten thermocathodes considerably reduced the work function of electrons; as the result, electrons are emitted at considerably lower temperatures. Tungsten forms a one-atom-thick layer {{on the surface of}} thorium. The work function from a thorium surface is lowered possibly because of the electric field on the interface between thorium and tungsten formed due to thorium's greater electropositivity. Since the 1920s, thoriated tungsten wires have been used in electronic tubes and in the cathodes and anticathodes of X-ray tubes and rectifiers. Thanks to the reactivity of thorium with atmospheric oxygen and nitrogen, thorium also marks impurities in the evacuated tubes. The introduction of transistors in the 1950s significantly diminished this use, but not entirely.

This paper {{is dedicated to the}} high speed video camera at 100, 000 frames per second and electrical signal analyses of arcs behavior in a 3 -phase AC arc plasma torch. First, a reference case at 150 A, in nitrogen as working gas, has been deeply analyzed. Afterwards, a parametric study based on current and inter-electrode gap has been carried out. Results show that only one arc can exist at a given time and arcs rotate by switching from a pair of electrodes to another one, following the maximal electrical gap potential. However, a particular "abnormal" arc behavior was sometimes observed. Indeed, the arc motion within the inter-electrode gap increases the heat exchange and stabilizes the 3 -phase discharge whereas the system is unbalanced when the arc is in the periphery. The analysis highlights that the arc motion is strongly influenced by the electrode jet velocity and repulsive Lorentz forces. The parametric study shows that the current increases both jet velocity and <b>arc</b> discharge <b>stability.</b> Elsewhere, the increase of the inter-electrode gap can also stabilizes the electrical 3 -phase arc discharge.

50|$|An {{important}} part of steelmaking is the formation of slag, which floats {{on the surface of}} the molten steel. Slag usually consists of metal oxides, and acts as a destination for oxidised impurities, as a thermal blanket (stopping excessive heat loss) and helping to reduce erosion of the refractory lining. For a furnace with basic refractories, which includes most carbon steel-producing furnaces, the usual slag formers are calcium oxide (CaO, in the form of burnt lime) and magnesium oxide (MgO, in the form of dolomite and magnesite). These slag formers are either charged with the scrap, or blown into the furnace during meltdown. Another major component of EAF slag is iron oxide from steel combusting with the injected oxygen. Later in the heat, carbon (in the form of coke or coal) is injected into this slag layer, reacting with the iron oxide to form metallic iron and carbon monoxide gas, which then causes the slag to foam, allowing greater thermal efficiency, and better <b>arc</b> <b>stability</b> and electrical efficiency. The slag blanket also covers the arcs, preventing damage to the furnace roof and sidewalls from radiant heat.|$|E
