500|$|In July 1962, after Hendrix was {{discharged}} from the U.S. Army, he entered a small club in Clarksville, Tennessee. Drawn in by live music, he stopped for a drink and ended up spending most of the $400 he had saved. He explained: [...] "I went in this jazz joint and had a drink. I liked it <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>stayed.</b> People tell me I get foolish, good-natured sometimes. Anyway, I guess I felt real benevolent that day. I must have been handing out bills to anyone that asked me. I {{came out of that}} place with sixteen dollars left." [...] According to the authors Steven Roby and Brad Schreiber: [...] "Alcohol would later be the scourge of his existence, driving him to fits of pique, even rare bursts of atypical, physical violence." ...|$|E
500|$|When Arsenal {{moved to}} the Emirates Stadium, the club prioritised repaying the loans over {{strengthening}} the playing squad. Arsenal's self-sustaining model relied heavily on qualifying for the UEFA Champions League; as Wenger recalled in 2016: [...] "We had to be {{three years in the}} Champions League out of five and have an average of 54,000 people, and we didn’t know we would be capable of that." [...] The club sold several experienced players throughout the late 2000s and early 2010s and raised ticket prices, upsetting supporters who have called for change. Wenger took umbrage over criticism and revealed the bank loans were contingent on his commitment to the club: [...] "The banks wanted the technical consistency to guarantee that {{we have a chance to}} pay [...] back. I did commit <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> and under very difficult circumstances. So for me to come back and on top of that [...] reproach me for not having won the championship during that period it is a bit overboard." [...] Wenger later described the stadium move as the toughest period of his life because of the restricted finances in place.|$|E
500|$|On 8 June 2007, Alonso {{signed a}} five-year contract, stating, [...] "I {{knew there was}} {{interest}} from other clubs {{but it was always}} my idea to stay here. I have been here for three seasons now and have such special feelings for the club and the supporters. I understand what Liverpool means to so many people. It is such a special club and I just didn't want to leave." [...] The 2007–08 season started well for the Spaniard: Gerrard's absence led to Alonso playing in a more advanced position and he scored twice in a 6–0 rout against Premier League newcomers Derby County. The bright beginning was short-lived, however, as a minor injury sustained in a game against Portsmouth became aggravated in training. The metatarsal injury forced him out of training for six weeks but his return to the first team was rushed and his injury recurred in his first game back. Alonso's determination and passion proved to be his downfall, and he later reflected, [...] "I had been feeling a bit tired around that time because it was only my first game back and the match was very fast. But as a player you don't want to come off, particularly when the team is winning <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> on." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kossowski {{was first}} imprisoned at Skole {{and then at}} Kharkov, both in present Ukraine. He told Fr. Martin Sankey, [...] "In prison I stayed about a year. Later we {{received}} sentences. I got five years of hard labour camp and {{was sent to the}} part of the Gulag which is called Peczlag, on the river Peczora which runs into the Polar Sea <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> there till 1942." ...|$|E
2500|$|Moody stated [...] "I've {{felt bad}} {{because of what}} has happened. I miss the old Pantera kids who would just throw each other. Just respect other people; come on." [...] Bathory stated: [...] "Because he broke his leg I threw down my guitar. We just {{finished}} when he broke his leg, and I came out <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> with him until the paramedics picked him up. These are my people and that's how it is." ...|$|E
2500|$|This rivality [...] {{was really}} {{building}} {{from the people}} of the newspapers and the fans. But I think it was very good for both of us, because the publicity was so big and it created a very big interest about me and Maria and was very good in the end. But I don't know why they put this kind of rivality , because the voice was very different. She was really something unusual. And I remember that I was very young artist too, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> near the radio every time that I know that there was something on radio by Maria.|$|E

2500|$|Thereafter, Work largely {{contained}} his Socialist Party {{activity to}} journalism, making {{an exception to}} run for delegate to the 1936 National Convention. A known opponent of the 1934 Declaration of Principles, Work was defeated in his bid for full delegate status and was elected instead as an alternate. He chose not to attend but neither did he follow the so-called [...] "Old Guard" [...] out of the party into a new rival organization called the Social Democratic Federation. [...] "I believed that the Socialist Party would get over this spell of 'the measles,' <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>stayed</b> in it — and my belief {{turned out to be}} correct," [...] he later recalled in his memoirs.|$|E
