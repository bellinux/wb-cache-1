5|$|As {{with all}} endopterygotes, beetle larvae pupate, and from these pupae emerge fully formed, sexually mature adult beetles, or imagos. Pupae never have mandibles (they are adecticous). In most pupae, the <b>appendages</b> are not {{attached}} to the body and {{are said to be}} exarate; in a few beetles (Staphylinidae, Ptiliidae etc.) the <b>appendages</b> are fused with the body (termed as obtect pupae).|$|E
5|$|Crustaceans {{exhibit a}} number of larval forms, of which the {{earliest}} and most characteristic is the nauplius. This has three pairs of <b>appendages,</b> all emerging from the young animal's head, and a single naupliar eye. In most groups, there are further larval stages, including the zoea (pl. zoeæ or zoeas). This name was given to it when naturalists believed {{it to be a}} separate species. It follows the nauplius stage and precedes the post-larva. Zoea larvae swim with their thoracic <b>appendages,</b> as opposed to nauplii, which use cephalic <b>appendages,</b> and megalopa, which use abdominal <b>appendages</b> for swimming. It often has spikes on its carapace, which may assist these small organisms in maintaining directional swimming. In many decapods, due to their accelerated development, the zoea is the first larval stage. In some cases, the zoea stage is followed by the mysis stage, and in others, by the megalopa stage, depending on the crustacean group involved.|$|E

Although this type of control requires feedback of the flexible <b>appendage</b> state, its direct measurement is generally difficult. Thus, an estimator of the flexible <b>appendage</b> state was constructed using a force/torque sensor attached between the base and flexible <b>appendage.</b> The control method was experimentally verified using an air-floating system...|$|R
5|$|The {{embryonic}} body segments (somites) {{of different}} arthropods taxa have diverged {{from a simple}} body plan with many similar <b>appendages</b> which are serially homologous, {{into a variety of}} body plans with fewer segments equipped with specialised <b>appendages.</b> The homologies between these have been discovered by comparing genes in evolutionary developmental biology.|$|E
5|$|The opisthosoma {{consists}} of twelve or fewer segments that originally formed two groups, a mesosoma of seven segments and a metasoma of five, terminating with a telson or spike.

5|$|Anomalocaridids, such as Anomalocaris, were {{organism}}s {{thought to}} be distantly related to the arthropods. These creatures looked quite unlike any organism living today—they had segmented exoskeletons, with lateral lobes used for swimming, typically large compound eyes, often set on stalks, and most strikingly, a pair of large, claw-like great <b>appendages</b> that resembled headless shrimp. These <b>appendages</b> {{are thought to have}} passed food to the animal's mouth, which resembled a ring of sliced pineapple.|$|E
50|$|Two {{types of}} great <b>appendage</b> are recognised; the first, the long great <b>appendage</b> {{such as that}} seen in the anomalocaridids, resembles a 15-unit leg; whereas the more {{ubiquitous}} short great <b>appendage</b> characteristic of the Megacheira is arm-like with a claw-like end.

40|$|AbstractThe left atrial (LA) <b>appendage</b> is {{a common}} source of cardiac {{thrombus}} formation associated with systemic embolism. Transesophageal echocardiography allows a detailed evaluation of the structure and function of the <b>appendage</b> by two-dimensional imaging and Doppler interrogation of <b>appendage</b> flow. Specific flow patterns, reflecting <b>appendage</b> function, have been characterized for normal sinus rhythm and various abnormal cardiac rhythms. <b>Appendage</b> dysfunction {{has been associated with}} LA <b>appendage</b> spontaneous echocardiographic contrast, thrombus formation and thromboembolism. These associations have been studied extensively in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, in patients undergoing cardioversion of atrial arrhythmias and in patients with mitral valve disease. The present review summarizes the literature on the echocardiographic assessment of LA <b>appendage</b> structure, function and dysfunction, which has {{become an integral part of}} the routine clinical transesophageal echocardiographic examination...|$|R

5|$|During osmoregulation, fluid {{is added}} to the pericardia of the branchial hearts. The octopus has two nephridia (equivalent to {{vertebrate}} kidneys) which are associated with the branchial hearts; these and their associated ducts connect the pericardial cavities with the mantle cavity. Before reaching the branchial heart, each branch of the vena cava expands to form renal <b>appendages</b> which are in direct contact with the thin-walled nephridium. The urine is first formed in the pericardial cavity, and is modified by excretion, chiefly of ammonia, and selective absorption from the renal <b>appendages,</b> as it is passed along the associated duct and through the nephridiopore into the mantle cavity.|$|E

40|$|Objective—To {{compare the}} value of current transthoracic echocardiographic systems and transoesophageal {{echocardiography}} for assessing left atrial <b>appendage</b> function and imaging thrombi.  Design—Single blind prospective study. Patients were first investigated by transthoracic echocardiography and thereafter by a second investigator using transoesophageal echocardiography. The feasibility of imaging the left atrial <b>appendage,</b> recording its velocities, and identifying thrombi within the <b>appendage</b> were determined by both methods.  Patients— 117 consecutive patients with a stroke or transient neurological deficit.  Setting—Tertiary cardiac and neurological care centre.  Results—Imaging of the complete <b>appendage</b> was feasible in 75 % of the patients by transthoracic echocardiography and in 95 % by transoesophageal echocardiography. Both methods were concordant {{for the detection of}} thrombi in 10  cases. Transoesophageal echocardiography revealed two additional thrombi. In one of these patients, transthoracic echocardiography was not feasible and in the other the thrombus had been missed by transthoracic examination. In patients with adequate transthoracic echogenicity, the specificity and sensitivity of detecting left atrial <b>appendage</b> thrombi were 100 % and 91 %, respectively. Recording of left atrial <b>appendage</b> velocities by transthoracic echocardiography was feasible in 69 % of cases. None of the patients with a velocity >  0. 3 m/s had left atrial <b>appendage</b> thrombi. In the one patient in whom transthoracic echocardiographic evaluation missed a left atrial <b>appendage</b> thrombus, the peak emptying velocity of the left atrial <b>appendage</b> was 0. 25  m/s.  Conclusions—A new generation echocardiographic system allows for the transthoracic detection of left atrial <b>appendage</b> thrombi and accurate determination of left atrial <b>appendage</b> function in most patients with a neurological deficit.    Keywords: echocardiography; left atrial <b>appendage</b> thrombi; stroke; thromboembolis...|$|R

5000|$|This {{evidence}} {{has been used to}} suggest that the labrum is in fact a highly reduced <b>appendage.</b> Its tritocerebral innervation {{from the rear of the}} brain has suggested to some workers that, if an <b>appendage,</b> it is the <b>appendage</b> of the segment; a point disputed by others who argue that the presence of a well-developed <b>appendage</b> in at least crustaceans in this segment (i.e., the second antenna, corresponding to the intercalary segment of insects) rules this out.|$|R
5|$|Most {{species of}} malacostracans have {{distinct}} sexes (a {{phenomenon known as}} gonochorism), although a few species exhibit hermaphroditism. The female genital openings or gonopores are located on the sixth thoracic segment or its <b>appendages,</b> while the male gonopores are on the eighth segment or its <b>appendages,</b> or in {{a small number of}} species, on the seventh. The naupliar larval stages are often reduced and take place before hatching, but where they occur, a metamorphosis usually occurs between the larval and the adult forms. Primitive malacostracans have a free-swimming naupliar larval stage.|$|E
5|$|The {{posterior}} thoracic {{group is}} made up of six somites, each possessing a pair of long multi-jointed <b>appendages.</b> The segments of these <b>appendages</b> are longer near the body and taper towards the flexible distal segments, extending past the carapace. They bear a fringe of long, slender filaments, all of which are directed towards the middle of the body, a characteristic shared by extant crustaceans. Though usually squashed into blade-like shapes from the fossilisation process, the filaments were slender cylindrical tubes when the animal was alive. The filaments at the tipmost segment are often bunched together. These <b>appendages</b> are believed to be the exopodites and may have functioned as gills and as swimming limbs. They are possibly biramous, with some specimens showing traces of what may be small endopodites at their bases.|$|E
5|$|The prosoma {{is formed}} in the embryo by fusion of the acron, which carries the eyes, with {{segments}} two to seven, which all have paired <b>appendages,</b> while segment one is lost during the embryo's development. Segment two has a pair of chelicerae, small <b>appendages</b> that often form pincers, segment three has a pair of pedipalps that in most sub-groups perform sensory functions, while the remaining four cephalothorax segments have pairs of legs. In primitive forms the acron has a pair of compound eyes on the sides and four pigment-cup ocelli ("little eyes") in the middle. The mouth is between segments two and three.|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveAtrial {{fibrillation}} puts {{patients at}} significant risk for embolic stroke originating {{from the left}} atrial <b>appendage.</b> Few means are available for safe, effective, and durable left atrial <b>appendage</b> occlusion. A new clip device was evaluated with regard to safety and effectiveness for epicardial left atrial <b>appendage</b> occlusion. MethodsPatients with atrial fibrillation undergoing elective cardiac surgery through a median sternotomy were enrolled for concomitant epicardial clip placement. Early postoperative and 3 -month follow-up computed tomography studies {{were used to assess}} clip stability and left atrial <b>appendage</b> perfusion. ResultsFrom September 2007 to December 2008, 34 patients underwent successful clip placement. No device-related complications occurred. Operative mortality was 8. 8 % and not study or device related. Deployment was rapid, and left atrial <b>appendage</b> occlusion was confirmed by intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography in all patients. In addition to excellent clinical outcomes (no stroke/transient ischemic attack), serial computed tomography demonstrated stable clip location and <b>appendage</b> perfusion at 3 months in all patients.

5|$|The pupae of most Lepidoptera are obtect, with <b>appendages</b> fused or {{glued to}} the body, while the rest have exarate pupae, having the antennae, legs, and wings free and not {{glued to the}} body.|$|E

5|$|Up {{to three}} {{thoracic}} segments may be fused {{with the head}} to form a cephalothorax; the associated <b>appendages</b> turn forward and are modified as maxillipeds (accessory mouthparts).

It is variable in form and may be fused dorsally with some of the thoracic segments or occasionally be in two parts, hinged dorsally. Typically, each of the thoracic <b>appendages</b> is biramous and the endopods are the better developed of the branches, being used for crawling or grasping. Each endopod consist of seven articulating segments; the coxa, basis, ischium, merus, carpus, propodus and dactylus. In decapods, the claw is formed by the articulation of the dactylus against an outgrowth of the propodus. In some taxa, the exopods are lost and the <b>appendages</b> are uniramous.|$|E
