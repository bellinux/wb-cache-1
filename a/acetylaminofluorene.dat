40|$|The {{rate and}} extent of {{disappearance}} of two DNA lesions (pyrimidine dimers and covalently bound <b>acetylaminofluorene),</b> both thought to be removed by the so-called wide-patch (approximately 100 nucleotides) repair process, were studied {{in a variety of}} cultured mammalian cells. With the exception of mouse cells, dimers were removed more rapidly and extensively than covalently bound <b>acetylaminofluorene.</b> In human cells, for example, about 50 % of the dimers were excised from DNA in 1 hr while only 25 - 50 % of the chemically induced lesions were excised from DNA after 48 hr. Surprisingly mouse cells, which remove few dimers, were about as competent as control human fibroblasts at removing <b>acetylaminofluorene</b> lesions; however, xeroderma pigmentosum cells (group D) removed fewer N-acetoxy- 2 -acetylaminofluorene-induced lesions than control human cells. Our data raise the possibility of separate repair processes for these two types of lesions and suggest that their expression may be under similar genetic control in human cells...|$|E
40|$|Mutations {{induced by}} 2 -(N-acetoxy-N-acetylamino) {{fluorene}} were studied using temperature-sensitive simian virus 40 (SV 40) mutants as probe in monkey kidney cells. In vitro {{treatment of the}} SV 40 virions with 2 -(N-acetoxy-N-acetylamino) fluorene increased mutagenesis and decreased survival in the viral progeny. A lethal hit of approximately 85 <b>acetylaminofluorene</b> adducts per SV 40 genome was calculated. UV irradiation of cells prior to infection did not modify the results. Molecular analysis of independent SV 40 revertants showed that 2 -(N-acetoxy-N-acetylamino) fluorene induces base substitutions that are located not opposite putative <b>acetylaminofluorene</b> adducts but next to them. Moreover, a hot spot of mutation restoring a true wild-type genotype was observed in 10 of the 16 revertants analyzed. This hot spot, not targeted opposite a major DNA lesion, was not observed using UV light as damaging agent in the same genetic assay. Two models involving the stabilization, by <b>acetylaminofluorene</b> adducts, of the secondary structure of a specific quasipalindromic SV 40 sequence are proposed to explain this sequence-specific hot spot...|$|E
40|$|By {{applying}} {{a new and}} highly sensitive assay for measuring N-hydroxy metabolites, the biochemical properties of the microsomal N-hydroxylase from control and 3 -methylcholanthrene-treated rat and hamster liver have been analyzed, and the following conclusions have been drawn. (a) Due to a difference in enzyme affinity, the metabolic activation of <b>acetylaminofluorene</b> is more pronounced than that of aminofluorene, a fact which correlates with {{the difference in the}} carcinogenic potency of the two compounds. (b) Arylamine N-hydroxylase differs qualitatively as well as quantitatively from arylamide N- hydroxylase mainly in terms of sensitivity to various in vitro inhibitors. (c) 7, 8 -Benzoflavone and 3 -methylcholanthrene are strong inhibitors of liver microsomal N-hydroxylases. This effect could partly explain the inhibition of the hepatic tumorigenicity of <b>acetylaminofluorene</b> in animals simultaneously fed 3 -methylcholanthrene. (d) The metabolism of <b>acetylaminofluorene</b> proceeds via both ring- (C- 1, C- 3, C- 5, or C- 7) and N-hydroxylation. There is clear reciprocal interaction between these various microsomal pathways. (e) The apparent increase in Km following pretreatment of the rat with 3 -methylcholanthrene is due to competitive inhibition of the N-hydroxylase by some of the C-hydroxy metabolites. This effect is not seen in hamster liver...|$|E

40|$|Hepatocyte {{growth factor}} (HGF) {{is a potent}} mitogen for mature hepatocytes in vitro. The {{receptor}} for HGF has recently been characterized {{as the product of}} the proto-oncogene c-met. We have examined the possible involvement of HGF in hepatic growth and differentiation in the rat. The experimental systems used were <b>acetylaminofluorene</b> treatment combined with partial hepatectomy to induce proliferation and differentiation of oval cells in adult liver and the pre- and postnatal liver. In the <b>acetylaminofluorene</b> model, Northern blot analysis showed that level of HGF transcripts increased one day after partial hepatectomy, reached a peak by day 6, were maintained at that level until day 13, and then declined, reaching normal level at 20 days. The expression of c-met also increased gradually, reached a peak around 9 to 13 days after partial hepatectomy, at which time oval cell proliferation was most prominent. In the developing liver, an elevated level of HGF transcripts was found between 4 and 21 days after birth. The expression of c-met also slightly increased at the same time. In situ hybridization showed that the transcripts for HGF were localized in desmin-positive Ito cells, whereas the transcripts for c-met were strongly expressed by oval cells. We have shown earlier that Ito cells and oval cells proliferate simultaneously and exist in close proximity in the <b>acetylaminofluorene</b> model and that Ito cells are a primary source of growth factors such as transforming growth factor-alpha and acidic fibroblast growth factors. The data presented here suggest that HGF is, in combination with other growth factors, involved in the proliferation and differentiation of oval cells via a paracrine mechanism...|$|E
40|$|We have {{constructed}} plasmids pS 3 G- 1 and pSG 4 {{that contain}} single <b>acetylaminofluorene</b> adducts within contiguous runs of three (5 '-CCCG 1 G 2 G 3 - 3 ') and four (5 '-CG 1 GGG 4 T- 3 ') guanine residues, respectively. In Escherichia coli, {{the frequency of}} induced - 1 frameshift mutations was strongly dependent on the position of modification: pS 3 G-G 3 was approximately 100 -fold and 10 -fold more mutagenic than pS 3 G-G 1 and pS 3 G-G 2, respectively; pSG 4 -G 4 was approximately 600 -fold more mutagenic than pSG 4 -G 1. Mutagenesis was SOS-dependent and was markedly reduced in bacteria that were proficient in nucleotide excision repair as compared to a repair-deficient uvrA 6 mutant. DNA sequencing showed that - 1 frameshift events in pS 3 G- 1 consisted of either targeted mutations (greater than 90 % of induced mutations) within the guanine sequence or semitargeted mutations (greater than 10 %) in the 5 ' flanking repetitive cytosine sequence. Semitargeted events, which were observed when <b>acetylaminofluorene</b> modification was at G 1 and G 2, show that a lesion can reduce the fidelity of replication at positions 5 ' to its location on the template strand. No semitargeted frameshifts were observed in plasmid pSG 4, which lacks a repetitive sequence 5 ' to the adduct. Our {{results are consistent with}} a model for frameshift mutagenesis in which the <b>acetylaminofluorene</b> adduct (i) allows accurate incorporation of cytosine opposite the bulky lesion during DNA synthesis and (ii) impedes elongation of primer/template termini formed opposite the adduct or 5 ' to the adduct on the template strand, providing increased opportunity for the formation of slipped frameshift intermediates...|$|E

Evidence is presented that <b>acetylaminofluorene</b> residues bound to guanosines in GpUpU, ApApG, or poly (U,G) inactivates their function in codon recognition. Circular dichroism spectra suggest that this is caused by gross conformational changes in these compounds involving both a rotation about the glycosidic bond of guanosine residues bearing N- 2 -acetylaminofluorene, as well as stacking interactions between the drug and bases adjacent to the substituted guanosine...|$|E

This assay uses a NER substrate consisting of M 13 double-stranded DNA with a single and uniquely located <b>acetylaminofluorene</b> (AAF) adduct, and measures the efficiency by which multiply damaged plasmid DNA competes for excision repair of the site-directed modification. To validate this assay, we tested competitor DNA containing defined numbers of either AAF adducts or UV radiation products.

The reactivity of these antibodies towards several ligands was studied by radioimmunoassay. The antibodies have the same affinity for double stranded DNA-AAF and single stranded DNA-AAF. Thus the geometry of the regions of DNA substituted by AAF residues is the same in native and denatured DNA. The affinity of the antibodies is smaller for DNA-AAF than for Guo-AAF.

We found that in mammalian cells, as previously observed in E. coli, modification of the third guanine of two target sequences, 5 ’-GGG- 3 ’ (3 G) and 5 ’-GGCGCC- 3 ’ (NarI site), induces – 1 and – 2 frameshift mutations, respectively. Using an in vitro assay for translesion synthesis, we investigated the biochemical control of these events.

We evaluated the preventive effects of pioglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonist, on the induction of early carcinogenic events. We monitored pre-neoplastic foci induced by a two-stage initiation/promotion model of hepatocarcinogenesis in rats, using diethylnitrosamine and <b>acetylaminofluorene.</b> Pioglitazone treatment was initiated the day after the first diethylnitrosamine injection. By quantitative morphometry and Western blot, we showed that pioglitazone significantly decreases the size of pre-neoplastic foci. Analysis of proliferation and apoptosis, assessed by immunohistochemistry, demonstrated decreased proliferation but no effect on cell death in rats treated with pioglitazone. These events were associated with an increased expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p 27 (kip 1), compared to the non treated group. In conclusion, pioglitazone inhibits early carcinogenic transformation in a two-step rat model.

Liver parenchyma cells and liver tumor cells were isolated by collagenase treatment and prepared for flow cytometric (FCM) measurements of nuclear DNA content. The changes observed were correlated to morphology and 3 H-thymidine incorporation. The early preneoplastic changes in hepatocytes from DMN-treated mice were shifts in the DNA content to classes of higher nuclear ploidies. AAF-feeding of rats caused gradual distortion of the DNA content of nuclei from parenchymal cells. After 16 weeks of exposure, before any tumors were seen, a majority of the nuclei displayed an aneuploid DNA content. The significance of these changes in the carcinogenic process is discussed, and a possible use of these models for detection of hepatotropic agents and agents causing aneuploidy (clastogens and turbagens) is proposed. The liver neoplasias (adenomas and hepatocellular carcinomas) induced by these models contained tumor stemlines with diploid DNA content, and some hepatocellular carcinomas showed aneuploidy.

These strains, which belonged to 11 biotypes and 1 nontypeable group, were isolated in seven hospitals in Belgium between 1986 and 1992. EcoRI and HindIII were used to obtain cleavage patterns. Analysis of the results produced 27 different patterns with EcoRI and 23 patterns with HindIII. Typeability reached 100 %. Combination of the patterns obtained with each enzyme produced 38 distinct ribotypes. Percent similarity values, calculated by using the Dice coefficient and unweighted-pair group average linkage clustering, showed four main clusters and nine subclusters of ribopatterns at a similarity rate of approximately 80 % or less. These groups did not coincide with those delimited by biotyping, although a rather good correlation was observed. The simultaneous use of the two methods has potential value in epidemiological studies. During the last three decades, Serratia marcescens has emerged as an opportunistic pathogen and nosocomially sig-nificant microorganism (17).

40|$|Nucleotide {{excision}} repair (NER) removes lesions caused by environmental mutagens or UV light from DNA. A hallmark of NER is the extraordinarily wide substrate specificity, raising {{the question of}} how one set of proteins is able to recognize structurally diverse lesions. Two key features of good NER substrates are that they are bulky and thermodynamically destabilize DNA duplexes. To understand what the limiting step in damage recognition in NER is, we set out to test the hypothesis that there is a correlation of the degree of thermodynamic destabilization induced by a lesion, binding affinity to the damage recognition protein XPC-RAD 23 B, and overall NER efficiency. We chose to use <b>acetylaminofluorene</b> (AAF) and aminofluorene (AF) adducts at the C 8 position of guanine in different positions within the NarI (GGCGCC) sequence, as it is known that the structures of the duplexes depend on the position of the lesion in this context. We found that the efficiency of NER and the binding affinity of the damage recognition factor XPC-RAD 23 B correlated with the thermodynamic destabilization induced by the lesion. Our study is the first systematic analysis correlating these three parameters and supports the idea that initial damage recognition by XPC-RAD 23 B is a key rate-limiting step in NER. clos...|$|E
40|$|Neural retinas of 6 -day-old chick embryos {{synthesize}} DNA and {{are able}} to carry out DNA excision repair. However, in contrast to the situation in human cells, the maximum rate of repair induced by N-acetoxy <b>acetylaminofluorene</b> (AAAF) is no greater than that induced by methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). With advancing differentiation of the retina in the embryo, cell multiplication and DNA synthesis decline and cease, and concurrently the cells lose the ability to carry out DNA excision repair. Thus, in 15 - 16 -day embryos, in which the level of DNA synthesis is very low, DNA repair is barely detectable. If retinas from 14 -day embryos are dissociated with trypsin and the cell suspension is plated in growth- promoting medium, DNA synthesis is reinitiated; however, in these cultures there is no detectable repair of MMS-induced damage, and only low levels of repair are observed after treatment with AAAF. A cell line was produced, by repeated passaging of these cultures, in which the cell population reached a steady state of DNA replication. However, the cell population remained deficient in the ability to repair MMS-induced damage. This cell line most likely predominantly comprises cells of retino-glial origin. Possible correlations between deficiency in DNA repair mechanisms in replicating cells and carcinogenesis in neural tissues are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Previously pleiotrophin (PTN) was {{identified}} among proteins secreted by Swiss 3 T 3 cells as a mitogen for cultured adult rat hepatocytes. The present {{study showed that}} the growth of rat hepatocytes was enhanced when cultured with rat hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). HSCs expressed PTN mRNA and secreted its protein in the co-cultures. Recombinant PTN enhanced the growth of hepatocytes in culture, suggesting that HSCs stimulate the growth of hepatocytes through the action of PTN. To know the biological role of PTN {{in the growth of}} hepatocytes in vivo, we examined the expression of PTN in four regeneration models of adult liver and embryonic liver of rat. The expression of PTN mRNA in the liver was markedly up-regulated by the treatment with d-galactosamine (GalN) or with <b>acetylaminofluorene</b> followed by partial hepatectomy. HSCs expressed PTN mRNA in response to GalN treatment and its protein was found on hepatocytes. The mRNA expression of N-syndecan, a PTN receptor, was up-regulated in GalN-treated hepatocytes. The mesenchymal cells in the septum transversum enclosing the embryonic liver, but not embryonic HSCs, expressed PTN mRNA. We suggest that PTN is secreted from activated adult HSCs and embryonic mesenchymal cells as a mitogen of parenchymal cells in adult and embryonic liver, respectively...|$|E
40|$|DNA {{fragments}} {{were constructed}} in which <b>acetylaminofluorene</b> adducts were introduced specifically at {{each one of}} the three different guanines of the 6 -base-pair sequence -GGCGCC-. Incubation of the DNA with the UvrABC excision nuclease in vitro revealed major differences in the efficiency of adduct excision depending on the site of modification. Oligonucleotide excision of adducts bound to the second guanine was only 15 % as efficient as excision of adducts at the first guanine, whereas the excision efficiency for adducts bound to the third guanine was intermediary. However, recognition of DNA damage appeared to occur with nearly 100 % efficiency at all three adduct positions, as judged from DNase I footprint analysis of the DNA/protein binding complexes. Hence, it appears that the structural elements for DNA damage recognition by the UvrABC enzyme are different from the signals for excision. Furthermore, the repair pattern observed is not inversely correlated with the potential of these adducts to induce mutations since mutation analysis of single-adduct DNA has shown that only adducts at the third guanine are strongly premutagenic. We conclude that the effectiveness of excision repair depends on the context of the DNA sequence and that ineffectively repaired adduct sites are not necessarily mutational hot spots...|$|E
40|$|In {{the yeast}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae, DNA {{polymerase}} ζ (Polζ) {{is required in}} a major lesion bypass pathway. To help understand the role of Polζ in lesion bypass, we have performed in vitro biochemical analyses of this polymerase in response to several DNA lesions. Purified yeast Polζ performed limited translesion synthesis opposite a template TT (6 - 4) photoproduct, incorporating A or T with similar efficiencies (and less frequently G) opposite the 3 ′ T, and predominantly A opposite the 5 ′ T. Purified yeast Polζ predominantly incorporated a G opposite an <b>acetylaminofluorene</b> (AAF) -adducted guanine. The lesion, however, significantly inhibited subsequent extension. Furthermore, yeast Polζ catalyzed extension DNA synthesis from primers annealed opposite the AAF-guanine and the 3 ′ T of the TT (6 - 4) photoproduct with varying efficiencies. Extension synthesis was more efficient when A or C was opposite the AAF-guanine, and when G was opposite the 3 ′ T of the TT (6 - 4) photoproduct. In contrast, the 3 ′ T of a cis–syn TT dimer completely blocked purified yeast Polζ, whereas the 5 ′ T was readily bypassed. These results support the following dual-function model of Polζ. First, Polζ catalyzes nucleotide incorporation opposite AAF-guanine and TT (6 - 4) photoproduct with a limited efficiency. Secondly, more efficient bypass of these lesions may require nucleotide incorporation by other DNA polymerases followed by extension DNA synthesis by Polζ...|$|E

A sample of poly(dG-dC). poly(dG-dC) modified {{to an extent}} of 28 % with <b>acetylaminofluorene</b> (AAF) at the C(8) position of the deoxyguanosine residues showed a circular dichroism spectrum that had {{the characteristics of the}} Z conformation seen in unmodified poly(dG-dC). poly(dG-dC) at high ethanol or salt concentrations. A sample of poly(dG-dC). poly(dG-dC) modified only 3 % by AAF showed a spectrum characteristic of the B form of DNA. However, it was converted to the Z form at ethanol concentrations lower than required to convert unmodified poly(dG-dC). poly(dG-dC) from the B to the Z form. Poly(dG). poly(dC), which does not undergo the B-to-Z transition at high ethanol concentrations, did not show any large conformational changes with high AAF modification. Susceptibility to digestion with nuclease S 1 also suggested differences in the conformations of the two modified polynucleotides. Poly(dG-dC). poly(dG-dC) {{modified by}} AAF to an extent of 28 % was almost completely resistant to nuclease S 1 digestion. However, both poly(dG). poly(dC) and DNA modified to similar levels by AAF were highly susceptible to nuclease S 1 digestion. Two different conformations for AAF-modified deoxyguanosine are proposed, depending on whether its position is in alternating purine-pyrimidine sequences or in random-sequence DNA...|$|E
40|$|Mutagenic {{specificity}} of 2 -acetylaminofluorene (AAF) {{has been established}} in mammalian cells and several strains of bacteria by using a shuttle plasmid vector containing a single N-(deoxyguanosin- 8 -yl) <b>acetylaminofluorene</b> (C 8 -dG-AAF) adduct. The nucleotide sequence of the gene conferring tetracycline resistance was modified by conservative codon replacement so as to accommodate the sequence d(CCTTCGCTAC) flanked by two restriction sites, Bsm I and Xho I. The corresponding synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide underwent reaction with 2 -(N-acetoxy-N-acetylamino) -fluorene (AAAF), forming a single dG-AAF adduct. This modified oligodeoxynucleotide was hybridized to its complementary strand and ligated between the Bsm I and Xho I sites of the vector. Plasmids containing the C 8 -dG-AAF adduct were used to transfect simian virus 40 -transformed simian kidney (COS- 1) cells and to transform several AB strains of Escherichia coli. Colonies containing mutant plasmids were detected by hybridization to 32 P-labeled oligodeoxynucleotides. Presence of the single DNA adduct increased the mutation frequency by 8 -fold in both COS cells and E. coli. Over 80 % of mutations detected in both systems were targeted and represented G. C [...] C. G or G. C [...] T. A transversions or single nucleotide deletions. We conclude that modification of a deoxyguanosine residue with AAF preferentially induces mutations targeted at this site when a plasmid containing a single C 8 -dG-AAF adduct is introduced into mammalian cells or bacteria...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The {{aim of the}} BMBF-project “Development of a biotransformating {{system for}} the {{metabolic}} activation of validated in-vitro-systems to assess embryotoxicity” is to further develop already established alternative methods for animal testing. In this dissertation, embryotoxic substances and their metabolites (cyclophophamide/acrolein, retinol/all-transretinoic acid, valpromide/valproic acid, albendazole/albendazole sulfoxide, acetylaminofluorene/ N-hydroxy-acetylaminofluorene) have been tested in the WEC with rat embryos to simulate the maternal metabolism and to establish precise concentration-response-curves, followed by examination of substance combinations (in 80 / 20 and 50 / 50 ratios) on the embryo. Substances and methods: First, the substances were tested at increasing concentrations und then combined with their associated metabolite {{as part of a}} 80 / 20 and 50 / 50 ratio, in the WEC with rat embryos (9, 5 days old). The embryos were incubated under defined conditions in a rotating system for 48 hours and the results were evaluated {{on the basis of a}} morphologic scoring system. Results: The five examined substances (cyclophosphamide, retinol, valpromide, albendazole, <b>acetylaminofluorene)</b> originate from different substance groups, however, they displayed similarities in the evoked malformations of rat embryos. With increasing concentrations, all substances led to a reduction of size, protein content, somites, and yolk sac vasculogenesis and a decrease in scoring parameters. More specifically, substance-specific alterations were detected. Mostly, the development of the telencephalon was affected. From a concentration of 200 μg/ml (716, 5 μM) upward, cyclophosphamide led to the missing of the eye anlage and a stunted telencephalon. Retinol caused also alterations of the telencephalon (at 2, 5 μg/ml / 8, 73 μM) : 66, 6 % of the embryos had an open cranial neuroporus. At a concentration of 5, 0 μg/ml (17, 5 μM), 100 % of the embryos were abnorm, the telencephalon displayed an uneven surface and several hamorrhagies; the eye- and ear anlagen were completely missing. Albendazole caused an impared development of the telencephalon, but with a closed neural tube. <b>Acetylaminofluorene</b> (50 μg/ml bzw. 223, 9 μM) led to the development of placodes of the nose and open neural tubes. At a concentration of 200 μg/ml (895, 7 μM) or higher, the telencephalon did not exist anymore, but placodes of the nose and hamorrhagies could be found in all rat embryos. The cranial neural tube was open. Valpromide did not cause any microscopically visible alterations of the telencephalon. Characteristic for cyclophosphamide, valpromide and <b>acetylaminofluorene</b> was the incomplete rotation of the trunk, causing a “squirrel-like” position. Retinol and albendazole showed an effect on the heart. At 2, 5 μg/ml, retinol caused an incomplete amnion development, displaying microscopic malfunctions of the cardiac loop, and albendazole caused a malformation of the pericard. Characteristically, retinol also caused a complete adhesion of amnion and trunk at a concentration of 5 μg/ml (17, 5 μM). At 2, 5 μg/ml (8, 7 μM) the composition of the hind limbs and tail was retarded. Valpromide did not induce specific or characteristic malformations. At higher concentrations, the rat embryos did not completely rotate, and at the highest tested concentration, most embryos were malformed. The 80 / 20 and 50 / 50 combinations of most of the substances caused effects and were in agreement with the results observed with compounds when tested alone. Discussion: Comparing the test compounds with their metabolites, alterations of the rat embryos were found to be mostly in the same body parts and similar to effects described in earlier publications. Most notably was the higher toxicity found among the retinol/all-transretinoic acid-combination in comparison to the testings of retinol and its metabolite alone. At the second concentration (0, 83 μM) of 80 / 20 combination, open cranial neuropori and an incomplete rotation of the trunk was visible, while by testing retinol and its metabolite alone, statistically significant alterations occurred only at concentrations of 1, 66 μM and higher. This effect was even more pronounced with the 50 / 50 combination: The first alterations (incomplete rotation and open neuropori) were already observed at levels of 0, 33 μM (0, 1 μg/ml). Converse results, however, were found with albendazole/albendazole sulfoxide combination. The metabolite was less toxic than the parent compound. As a result, both combinations displayed less pronounced effects than the parent substance alone. Conclusion: The WEC with rat embryos is appropriate for analysing various substances in combination, thus simulating the situation induced by maternal metabolic activity. The results will be an essential prerequisite for the development and integration of a metabolizing system into the WEC...|$|E
