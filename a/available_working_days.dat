30|$|To {{describe}} how data in Tables 12 and 13 is calculated, take ship El Kossier {{as an example}} when it works on Arabian-Gulf-US trade area. According to SOS Voyager, El Kossier earned {{last quarter of the}} year 2017 a gross profit of $ 710, 500 in a 30 -day voyage, where 15 -knot speed is assumed and some unconfirmed cargoes are considered. This data is chosen to represent the result of El Kossier when it works on Arabian-Gulf-US trade area in the year 2018. It appears as one entry in Tables 12 or 13. So, these tables present all candidate alternatives of voyage gross profits and days for all ships in all trade areas, calculated per an anticipated cargo transport demand in each trade area. Table 10 presents the supply of ships in terms of <b>available</b> <b>working</b> <b>days</b> and ship daily fixed cost per the year 2018, while Table 11 presents the minimum and maximum frequency of calls in each trade area. Data in Tables 10 and 11 is input to SOS Data (the SOS database), while SOS Voyager generates data in Tables 12 and 13.|$|E

5000|$|The Governor General must issue writs for an {{election}} within {{seven days of}} the expiration or dissolution of Parliament. Under section 17 of the Constitution Act 1986, Parliament expires three years [...] "from the day fixed {{for the return of}} the writs issued for the last preceding general election of members of the House of Representatives, and no longer." [...] The writs for the previous general election were returnable on 27 November 2008. As a result, the 49th Parliament would have expired, if not dissolved earlier, on 27 November 2011. As that day was a Sunday, the last <b>available</b> <b>working</b> <b>day</b> was 25 November 2011. Consequently, the last day for issuance of writs of election was 2 December 2011. Except in some circumstances (such a recount or the death/incapacitation of an electorate candidate), the writs must be returned within 50 days of their issuance with the last possible <b>working</b> <b>day</b> being 20 January 2012. Because polling day must be a Saturday, the last possible polling date for the election was 7 January 2012, allowing time for the counting of special votes. The Christmas/New Year holiday period made the last realistic date for the election Saturday 10 December 2011. The Rugby World Cup 2011 was hosted by New Zealand between 9 September and 23 October 2011, and ruled out all the possible election dates in this period. This left two possible windows for the general election: on or before 2 September and 29 October to 10 December.|$|R
30|$|Several {{limitations}} of the study have to be kept in mind interpreting the data. The number of patients in the resuscitated group is rather small, especially if effects of single drugs are evaluated. Moreover, we do not have platelet function analysis for every day in every patient since analysis was only <b>available</b> on <b>working</b> <b>days.</b> Lastly, the control group was heterogeneous, since these patients only got platelet function analysis once and we therefore used three different age- and gender-matched control groups for the tree first days after resuscitation. Differences between the three control groups were negligible with respect to baseline characteristics and platelet function inhibition, however, still a methodological limitation.|$|R

Based on 20 data points obtained in August 2013, start-working time for contractors who worked for Capital Project Management (CPM) Team in Facility B was in average at 09. 05 a. m. The aim of this paper is to present how the firm implemented Lean Six Sigma to reduce non-added value activities while fulfilling to its safety requirements and to share lessons learned from practical and theory testing perspective. The methodology used is Lean Six Sigma’s DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) as mandated by the corporate policy of the firm. This research adopts a mix-methods approach, by using both qualitative and quantitative data. This study was a one year longitudinal study of the Lean Six Sigma implementation to improve contractors’ work preparation process. The improvement resulted in reduction of non-value added activities and successfully increased the <b>available</b> <b>working</b> time per <b>day</b> by 59. 3 minutes in average. The results of this case study reconfirm Lean Six Sigma as a good management theory since it shows a consistency between the theory and the real practice in a global oil and gas company in Indonesia...|$|R

30|$|In the {{components}} discussed so far, the changing number of <b>working</b> <b>days</b> leads to a proportional {{change in the}} volume of work. This would result in an excessively volatile productivity development caused by calendar-effects. Therefore, working time elasticities specific to economic branches are needed to approximate the correlation between a change of number of <b>working</b> <b>days</b> and a change of labour volume. These working-time elasticities should measure by how many hours the annual hours worked change when more or less <b>working</b> <b>days</b> are <b>available,</b> and hence the latter {{are not included in}} annual hours worked one-to-one. As suitable data for estimating these effects are not available, we take the elasticities to correspond to <b>working</b> <b>days</b> elasticities of production calculated by the German Bundesbank. These elasticities indicate the percentage by which the production increases if the potential working hours are extended by one per cent due to (the fraction of) an additional <b>working</b> <b>day.</b> The estimated <b>working</b> <b>day</b> effect reflects the difference of production carried out at a normal work day and the production carried out at a weekend day.|$|R

30|$|In the {{calculations}} {{of the number}} of potential <b>working</b> <b>days</b> a five-day week is assumed throughout.

Regional holidays that do not apply throughout Germany are weighted with the number of employees subject to social insurance contributions within the states (Bundesländer) level to calculate averages. The different numbers of annual <b>working</b> <b>days</b> have a nonnegligible irregular effect on annual hours worked.
