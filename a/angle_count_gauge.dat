The calculation of basal area or volume increment from <b>angle</b> <b>count</b> sample data is not trivial, and three alternative methods are currently in common use: the difference method, the starting value method, and the end value method. This article develops the hypothesis that in various circumstances these methods are susceptible to bias {{as a result of}} measurement error and mis-sampling of trees. After reviewing prior work in <b>angle</b> <b>count</b> mathematics and developing the theoretical basis of our hypothesis, we present a supporting example based on a large permanent sampling plot at Hirschlacke in northern Austria.

30|$|When using {{inventory}} {{data for}} a structural diversity index like the NFI of Germany, which is partly based on sampling via the <b>angle</b> <b>count</b> method, {{it is important}} to aggregate index-scores at a stratum level (e.g. forest-type) (Bitterlich 1952; Lappi and Bailey 1987; Sterba 2008). Observations or changes of structural diversity for single inventory plots should not be considered because dramatic changes recorded at individual plots may be caused by the sampling design rather than by actual changes in forest structure. Observed differences in variables between two inventories at a single plot may be attributable to the method of PPS (probability proportional to size) sampling, that <b>angle</b> <b>count</b> sampling is based on. Whether a tree is included in the sample or not depends on its diameter at breast height and its distance to the centre of the inventory plot. The associated low number of trees leads, in most cases, to a loss of information at the plot-level (justified by the need to optimize the sampling effort). For larger study areas and inventory strata, the accuracy of observations from <b>angle</b> <b>count</b> sampling is as high as that from inventories employing fixed radius circles (Lappi and Bailey 1987; Sterba 2008).

These objects have {{a very important role}} in supersymmetric gauge theories, since they can be used to describe the space of zero-energy solutions, called moduli space, of such theories. In order to approach the counting problem, a technique is used based on a function known in Algebraic Geometry as the Hilbert series. For the examined theories, this can be considered a a partition function <b>counting</b> <b>gauge</b> invariant operators in the field theory according to their charges under quantum global symmetries. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, particular focus will be given to the application of the Hilbert series to conformal Chern-Simons theories living on the world-volume of M 2 -branes probing different toric Calabi-Yau 4 -fold singularities. It will be shown how the Hilbert series can be combined with the brane tiling formalism to characterise the mesonic moduli space of vacua of a given theory through its generators and the relations they satisfy. Then, toric duality for these theories will be presented, with special attention to the role played by Hilbert series in making such feature manifest between two or more theories. Finally, Chern-Simons theories living on M 2 -branes probing cones over smooth toric Fano 3 -folds and their mesonic Hilbert series will be presented. In the second part, it will be shown how the Hilbert series can be applied to <b>counting</b> <b>gauge</b> invariant operators in supersymmetric generalisations of Quantum Chromodynamics, known as SQCD theories. The discussion will hinge on a specific class of theories, with N multiplets transforming in the fundamental and anti-fundamental and one in the adjoint representation of the gauge group.
