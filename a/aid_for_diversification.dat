40|$|We {{develop a}} novel {{methodology}} {{based on the}} marriage between the Bhattacharyya distance, a measure of similarity across distributions of random variables, and the Johnson Lindenstrauss Lemma, a technique for dimension reduction. The resulting technique is a simple yet powerful tool that allows comparisons between data-sets representing any two distributions. The degree to which different entities, (markets, groups of securities, etc.), have different measures of their corresponding distributions tells us {{the extent to which}} they are different, <b>aiding</b> participants looking <b>for</b> <b>diversification</b> or looking <b>for</b> more of the same thing. We demonstrate a relationship between covariance and distance measures based on a generic extension of Stein's Lemma. We consider an asset pricing application and then briefly discuss how this methodology lends itself to numerous marketstructure studies and even applications outside the realm of finance / social sciences by illustrating a biological application.

40|$|Activation-induced {{cytidine}} deaminase (<b>AID)</b> {{is essential}} <b>for</b> <b>diversification</b> of the Ig variable region (IgV). AID is {{excluded from the}} nucleus, where it normally functions. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible <b>for</b> regulating <b>AID</b> localization remain to be elucidated. The SR-protein splicing factor SRSF 1 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein, a splicing isoform of which called SRSF 1 - 3, has previously been shown to contribute to IgV diversification in chicken DT 40 cells. In this study, we examined whether SRSF 1 - 3 functions in IgV diversification by promoting nuclear localization of AID. AID expressed alone was localized predominantly in the cytoplasm. In contrast, co-expression of AID with SRSF 1 - 3 led to the nuclear accumulation of both AID and SRSF 1 - 3 {{and the formation of}} a protein complex that contained them both, although SRSF 1 - 3 was dispensable for nuclear import of AID. Expression of either SRSF 1 - 3 or a C-terminally-truncated AID mutant increased IgV diversification in DT 40 cells. However, overexpression of exogenous SRSF 1 - 3 was unable to further enhance IgV diversification in DT 40 cells expressing the truncated AID mutant, although SRSF 1 - 3 was able to form a protein complex with the AID mutant. These results suggest that SRSF 1 - 3 promotes nuclear localization of AID probably by forming a nuclear protein complex, which might stabilize nuclear AID and induce IgV diversification in an AID C-terminus-dependent manner...|$|R

40|$|Market Microstructure is the {{investigation}} of the process and protocols that govern the exchange of assets with the objective of reducing frictions that can impede the transfer. In financial markets, where there is an abundance of recorded information, this translates {{to the study of the}} dynamic relationships between observed variables, such as price, volume and spread, and hidden constituents, such as transaction costs and volatility, that hold sway over the efficient functioning of the system. "My dear, here we must process as much data as we can, just to stay in business. And if you wish to make a profit you must process at least twice as much data. " - Red Queen to Alice in Hedge-Fund-Land. In this age of (Too Much) Information, it is imperative to uncover nuggets of knowledge (signal) from buckets of nonsense (noise). To aid in this effort to extract meaning from chaos and to gain a better understanding of the relationships between financial variables, we summarize the application of the theoretical results from (Kashyap 2016 b) to microstructure studies. The central concept rests on a novel methodology based on the marriage between the Bhattacharyya distance, a measure of similarity across distributions, and the Johnson Lindenstrauss Lemma, a technique for dimension reduction, providing us with a simple yet powerful tool that allows comparisons between data-sets representing any two distributions. We provide an empirical illustration using prices, volumes and volatilities across seven countries and three different continents. The degree to which different markets or sub groups of securities have different measures of their corresponding distributions tells us the extent to which they are different.

40|$|An {{important}} {{application of}} the theory of choice under uncertainty is to asset markets, and an important property in these markets is a preference <b>for</b> portfolio <b>diversification.</b> If an investor is an expected utility maximizer, then he is risk averse if, and only if, he exhibits a preference <b>for</b> <b>diversification.</b> This paper examines the relationship between risk aversion and portfolio diversification when preferences over probability distributions of wealth do not have an expected utility representation. Although risk aversion is not sufficient to guarantee a preference <b>for</b> portfolio <b>diversification,</b> it is necessary. Quasiconcavity of the preference functional (over probability distributions of wealth), together with risk aversion, does imply a preference <b>for</b> portfolio <b>diversification.</b> Copyright 1989 by The Econometric Society. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{intended}} {{to contribute to the}} understanding of the motivations behind the diversification decisions of the Chilean “economic groups”. With this objective we surveyed the largest such groups in Chile. Our results show that the most important reasons <b>for</b> <b>diversification</b> <b>for</b> the top management of the Chilean business groups are managerial synergies (board of directors), financial synergies, information synergies and some specific operational synergies such as economies of scope in research and development. Also, most of the respondents stated that the diversification decisions of their firms or business groups have increased the multimarket contact with other companies or groups, influencing the strategies and diversification of competitors. The relationship between the degree of diversification of a group and its stated reasons <b>for</b> <b>diversification</b> are also analyzed. Significant differences in the motivations <b>for</b> <b>diversification</b> exist, depending on the group's actual level of diversification. Specifically, variables such as multimarket contact and access to the capital market are more important in more diversified groups. We also analyze the relationship between the size of a group and its stated reasons <b>for</b> <b>diversification.</b> There appear to be no significant differences between the answers of the management of bigger and smaller conglomerates. However, there is a positive correlation between the size of the groups and their level of diversification.

The converse holds under concavity of the utility index, which is itself equivalent to the notion of comonotone diversification, that we introduce. In an Anscombe-Aumann setting, preference <b>for</b> <b>diversification</b> {{is equivalent to}} convexity of the capacity and preference <b>for</b> sure <b>diversification</b> is equivalent to non-empty core.
