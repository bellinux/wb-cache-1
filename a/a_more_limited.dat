5|$|Field {{characteristics}} used {{to distinguish}} Boletus auripes from potential lookalike species include the yellowish brown to chestnut-brown cap surface that becomes paler with age, yellow flesh {{that does not}} stain blue, and a reticulate stem. B.aureissimus has a similar appearance, but has a honey-yellow to bright yellow or yellow-ochre cap, less conspicuous stem reticulation, and <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>limited</b> range covering Florida west to Texas. B.aureissimus var. castaneus has a purplish-brown cap with a texture like velvet.|$|E
5|$|On February 6, 1977, Amtrak {{announced}} plans to spend $24.4 million to overhaul all 61 cars {{as part of a}} larger fleet renewal program. In early 1977, some cars were repainted in Amtrak's Phase I paint scheme with red, white and blue ends and a small Amtrak logo. On September 28, the Amtrak board approved <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>limited</b> overhaul program of 16 Metroliners, as well as the purchase of the first 8 AEM-7 electric locomotives. On November 7, Amtrak released a specification for overhauling the 57 unmodified cars. It awarded a $20 million overhaul contract to GE that month.|$|E

5|$|The {{drilling}} {{project has}} been opposed by some environmental groups and scientists who have argued that hot-water drilling would have <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>limited</b> environmental impact. The main {{concern is that the}} lake could become contaminated with the antifreeze that the Russians used to keep the bore hole from refreezing. Scientists of the United States National Research Council have taken the position that it should be assumed that microbial life exists in Lake Vostok and that after such a long isolation, any life forms in the lake require strict protection from contamination.|$|E
5|$|When Lincoln {{failed in}} 1989 it cost the federal {{government}} over $3 billion and about 23,000 customers were left with worthless bonds. In the early 1990s, Keating was convicted in both federal and state courts of many counts of fraud, racketeering and conspiracy. He served {{four and a half}} years in prison before those convictions were overturned in 1996. In 1999, he pleaded guilty to <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>limited</b> set of wire fraud and bankruptcy fraud counts, and was sentenced to the time he had already served. Keating spent his final years in low-profile real estate activities until his death in 2014.|$|E
5|$|All {{members of}} a {{resident}} pod use similar calls, known collectively as a dialect. Dialects are composed of specific numbers and types of discrete, repetitive calls. They are complex and stable over time. Call patterns and structure are distinctive within matrilines. Newborns produce calls similar to their mothers, but have <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>limited</b> repertoire. Individuals likely learn their dialect through contact with their mother and other pod members. For instance, family-specific calls have been observed more frequently {{in the days following}} a calf's birth, which may help the calf learn them. Dialects are probably an important means of maintaining group identity and cohesiveness. Similarity in dialects likely reflects the degree of relatedness between pods, with variation building over time. When pods meet, dominant call types decrease and subset call types increase. The use of both call types is called biphonation. The increased subset call types may be the distinguishing factor between pods and inter-pod relations.|$|E

5|$|Christchurch {{was under}} heavy {{development}} at this time, {{as it had}} just been granted city status and was the new administrative capital of the province of Canterbury. This provided Mountfort and Luck ample opportunity to practice their trade. In 1855 they produced a preliminary design for the new Canterbury Provincial Council Buildings in timber. The buildings were constructed from 1857–59, but in <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>limited</b> form than the original design. As the Provincial Council gained new functions with growth in the population and economy of the province, the buildings were enlarged with a North wing in stone and an iron clock tower from 1859–60, and further enlarged with a stone council chamber and refreshment rooms in 1864–65. The buildings today are {{regarded as one of}} Mountfort's most important works.|$|E
5|$|During {{the debate}} over the {{proposed}} Patients' Bill of Rights legislation, Fletcher opposed a Democratic proposal that would have allowed individuals to sue their health maintenance organizations (HMOs), favoring instead <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>limited</b> bill drafted by Republican leadership that expanded the patient's ability to appeal HMO decisions. Many doctors in the Republican legislative caucus felt their party's bill did not go far enough; Fletcher and Tennessee Senator Bill Frist were notable exceptions. Fletcher's position cost him the support of the Kentucky Medical Association (KMA). After contributing to his campaign against Scorsone in 1998, KMA backed Scotty Baesler's bid to regain his old seat from Fletcher in 2000. However, Baesler only captured 35 percent of the vote to Fletcher's 53 percent. The remaining 12 percent went to third-party candidate Gatewood Galbraith.|$|E
5|$|Hans Asperger {{described}} common symptoms {{among his}} patients' family members, especially fathers, and research supports this observation and suggests a genetic contribution to Asperger syndrome. Although no specific gene {{has yet been}} identified, multiple factors are believed {{to play a role}} in the expression of autism, given the phenotypic variability seen in children with AS. Evidence for a genetic link is the tendency for AS to run in families and an observed higher incidence of family members who have behavioral symptoms similar to AS but in <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>limited</b> form (for example, slight difficulties with social interaction, language, or reading). Most behavioral genetic research suggests that all autism spectrum disorders have shared genetic mechanisms, but AS may have a stronger genetic component than autism. There is probably a common group of genes where particular alleles render an individual vulnerable to developing AS; if this is the case, the particular combination of alleles would determine the severity and symptoms for each individual with AS.|$|E

5|$|In 2011, the Eskimos {{utilized}} {{a committee}} of running backs, with McCarty, Daniel Porter, and Jerome Messam all receiving significant playing time. McCarty was used mostly in short-yardage situations on the ground, while also being active as a receiver and on special teams. He played in 18 games, made eight starts, and finished with 209 yards on 52 carries with no touchdowns. He also caught 22 passes for 150 yards and a touchdown. McCarty played in both of the Eskimos' playoff games. In the West Semi-Finals against the Stampeders, he rushed for a goal-line touchdown, in addition to making three receptions and two special-teams tackles. McCarty played <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>limited</b> role in the West Finals against the BC Lions, where he was given only one carry for six yards, made one tackle on special teams, and caught two passes {{for a total of}} four yards.|$|E
5|$|The {{porpoise}} eye {{is relatively}} small for its size, yet they do retain a good degree of eyesight. As well as this, {{the eyes of a}} porpoise are placed on the sides of its head, so their vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans have. When porpoises surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light; their eyes contain both rod and cone cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light. Porpoises do, however, lack short wavelength sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells indicating <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>limited</b> capacity for colour vision than most mammals. Most porpoises have slightly flattened eyeballs, enlarged pupils (which shrink as they surface to prevent damage), slightly flattened corneas and a tapetum lucidum; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye and, therefore, they are able to form a very clear image of the surrounding area.|$|E
