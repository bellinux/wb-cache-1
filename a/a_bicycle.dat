5|$|As in the {{previous}} years, there were two classes of cyclists, the coureurs de vitesse and the coureurs sur machines poinçonnées. Of the 93 cyclists starting the race, 82 were in the poinçonnée category, which meant {{that they had to}} finish the race on the same bicycle as they left, and if it was broken they had to fix it without assistance. The coureurs de vitesse could get help from the car with bicycle repairmen when they had to fix <b>a</b> <b>bicycle,</b> and when <b>a</b> <b>bicycle</b> was beyond repair, they could change it to a new one.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>bicycle</b> kick's {{successful}} performance generally requires great {{skill and}} athleticism. The performer needs to maintain good form when executing the move, and must simultaneously exhibit exceptional {{accuracy and precision}} when striking the ball. Sports historian Richard Witzig recommends that footballers attempt executing <b>a</b> <b>bicycle</b> kick with a focused and determined state of mind. Due to the action's complexity, a successfully executed bicycle kick is notable and, according to sports journalist Elliott Turner, prone to awe audiences. Brazilian forward Pelé, one of the sport's renowned players, also considers the manoeuvre difficult and recalled having scored from it {{only a few times}} out of his 1,283 career goals.|$|E

5|$|Browne {{learned to}} ride <b>a</b> <b>bicycle</b> {{at the age}} of four, but did not enter his first formal cycling {{competition}} until the age of 16, when he joined the Hawthorne Amateur Cycling Club. Browne made a habit of riding to training with his ordinary bike with heavy wheels to the club, carrying the lighter racing tyres on his back and changing his tyres upon his arrival. He earned extra money to fund <b>a</b> <b>bicycle</b> upgrade by working as a newspaper boy. There was little formal coaching at the club, and the cyclists learned by individual application and by watching and copying others. Browne and his club-mates raced on Saturdays and trained on Sundays.|$|E

5|$|Crosses that precede an {{offensive}} bicycle kick are of dubious accuracy—German striker Klaus Fischer reportedly stated that most crosses prior to <b>a</b> <b>bicycle</b> kick are bad. Moreover, performing <b>a</b> <b>bicycle</b> kick is dangerous, even when done correctly, {{as it may}} harm a startled participant in the field. For this reason, Peruvian defender César González recommends that the player executing the bicycle kick have enough space to perform it. For the player using the manoeuvre, the greatest danger happens during the drop; a bad fall can injure the head, back, or wrist. Witzig recommends players attempting the move to land on their upper back, using their arms as support, and simultaneously rolling over to a side in order to diminish impact from the drop. A poor bicycle kick can also expose a player to ridicule.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the twentieth century, the bicycle kick would again be brought forth to {{international}} acclaim by Pelé. Pelé's capability to perform bicycle kicks with ease was one of the traits that made him stand out from other players early in his sports career, and it also boosted his self-confidence as a footballer. After Pelé, Argentine midfielder Diego Maradona and Mexican forward Hugo Sánchez became notable performers of the bicycle kick during the last decades of the 20th century. Other notable players to have performed the move during this period include Peruvian winger Juan Carlos Oblitas, who scored <b>a</b> <b>bicycle</b> kick goal in a 1975 Copa América match between Peru and Chile, and Welsh forward Mark Hughes, who scored from <b>a</b> <b>bicycle</b> kick in a World Cup qualification match played between Wales and Spain in 1985.|$|E

5|$|The idea {{of holding}} <b>a</b> <b>bicycle</b> race around Italy was first {{suggested}} in a telegram sent by Tullo Margagni, editor of La Gazzetta dello Sport, to the paper's owner Emilio Costamagna and cycling editor Armando Cougnet.

Morgagni decided to try and hold the race before Corriere della Sera could hold theirs, and following La Gazzettas success in creating the Giro di Lombardia and Milan–San Remo, Costamagna decided to back the idea. The inaugural Giro d'Italia bicycle race was announced on 7 August 1908 in the first page of that day's edition of La Gazzetta, to be held in May 1909. The idea of the race was influenced by the success of the French magazine L'Autos organization of the Tour de France.|$|E
