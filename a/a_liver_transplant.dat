5|$|Hepatic {{encephalopathy}} {{is possibly}} reversible with treatment. This typically involves supportive care and addressing the triggers of the event.

5|$|In hepatic {{encephalopathy}} type C, {{the identification and}} treatment of alternative or underlying causes {{is central to the}} initial management. Given the frequency of infection as the underlying cause, antibiotics are often administered empirically (without knowledge of the exact source and nature of the infection). Once an episode of encephalopathy has been effectively treated, a decision may need to be made on whether to prepare for <b>a</b> <b>liver</b> <b>transplant.</b>|$|E
5|$|More than 40% {{of people}} with {{cirrhosis}} develop hepatic encephalopathy. More {{than half of those}} with cirrhosis and significant HE live less than a year.

5|$|Wilson's {{disease is}} {{typically}} treated with dietary changes and medication. Dietary changes involve eating a low copper diet and not using copper cookware. Medications used include chelating agents such as trientine and d-penicillamine and zinc supplements. Complications of Wilson's disease can include liver failure, liver cancer, and kidney problems. <b>A</b> <b>liver</b> <b>transplant</b> {{may be helpful}} in those in whom other treatments are not effective or if liver failure occurs.|$|E
5|$|In acute liver failure, the {{development}} of severe encephalopathy strongly predicts short-term mortality, and is almost {{as important as the}} nature of the underlying cause of the liver failure in determining the prognosis. Historically, widely used criteria for offering liver transplantation, such as King's College Criteria, are of limited use and recent guidelines discourage excessive reliance on these criteria. The occurrence of hepatic encephalopathy in people with Wilson's disease (hereditary copper accumulation) and mushroom poisoning indicates an urgent need for <b>a</b> <b>liver</b> <b>transplant.</b>|$|E

5|$|As {{the common}} name suggests, the fungus is highly toxic, and is {{responsible}} for the majority of fatal mushroom poisonings worldwide. Its biochemistry has been researched intensively for decades, and , or half a cap, of this mushroom is estimated to be enough to kill a human. In 2006, a family of three in Poland was poisoned, resulting in one death and the two survivors requiring liver transplants. In 2017, 14 people in California were poisoned, including an 18 month old who required <b>a</b> <b>liver</b> <b>transplant.</b> Some authorities strongly advise against putting suspected death caps in the same basket with fungi collected for the table and to avoid even touching them. Furthermore, the toxicity is not reduced by cooking, freezing, or drying.|$|E
5|$|The {{treatment}} of hepatic encephalopathy {{depends on the}} suspected underlying cause (types A, B or C) and {{the presence or absence}} of underlying causes. If encephalopathy develops in acute liver failure (type A), even in a mild form (grade 1â€“2), it indicates that <b>a</b> <b>liver</b> <b>transplant</b> may be required, and transfer to a specialist centre is advised. Hepatic encephalopathy type B may arise in those who have undergone a TIPS procedure; in most cases this resolves spontaneously or with the medical treatments discussed below, but in a small proportion of about5%, occlusion of the shunt is required to address the symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{may include}} {{activated}} charcoal {{if the person}} presents soon after the overdose. Attempting to force the person to vomit is not recommended. If {{there is a potential}} for toxicity, the antidote acetylcysteine is recommended. The medication is generally given for at least 24 hours. Psychiatric care may be required following recovery. <b>A</b> <b>liver</b> <b>transplant</b> may be required if damage to the liver becomes severe. The need for transplant is often based on low blood pH, high blood lactate, poor blood clotting, or significant hepatic encephalopathy. With early treatment liver failure is rare. Death occurs in about 0.1% of cases.|$|E

5|$|In {{patients}} developing liver failure, <b>a</b> <b>liver</b> <b>transplant</b> {{is often}} the only option to prevent death. Liver transplants have become a well-established option in amatoxin poisoning. This is a complicated issue, however, as transplants themselves may have significant complications and mortality; patients require long-term immunosuppression to maintain the transplant. That being the case, the criteria have been reassessed, such as onset of symptoms, prothrombin time (PTT), serum bilirubin, and presence of encephalopathy, for determining at what point a transplant becomes necessary for survival. Evidence suggests, although survival rates have improved with modern medical treatment, in patients with moderate to severe poisoning, {{up to half of}} those who did recover suffered permanent liver damage. A follow-up study has shown most survivors recover completely without any sequelae if treated within 36 hours of mushroom ingestion.|$|E
5|$|No {{definitive}} antidote for amatoxin poisoning is available, {{but some}} specific treatments such as intravenous penicillin G {{have been shown}} to improve survival. There is some evidence that intravenous silibinin, an extract from the blessed milk thistle (Silybum marianum), may be beneficial in reducing the effects of amatoxins, preventing their uptake by hepatocytes, thereby protecting undamaged hepatic tissue.
