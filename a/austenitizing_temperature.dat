50|$|As with {{conventional}} quench and tempering the material being heat treated must be cooled from the <b>austenitizing</b> <b>temperature</b> {{quickly enough to}} avoid the formation of pearlite. The specific cooling rate {{that is necessary to}} avoid the formation of pearlite {{is a product of the}} chemistry of the austenite phase and thus the alloy being processed. The actual cooling rate is a product of both the quench severity, which is influenced by quench media, agitation, load (quenchant ratio, etc.), and the thickness and geometry of the part. As a result, heavier section components required greater hardenability. In austempering the heat treat load is quenched to a temperature which is typically above the Martensite start of the austenite and held. In some patented processes the parts are quenched just below the Martensite start so that the resulting microstructure is a controlled mixture of Martensite and Bainite.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} methods of TiN thin film {{creation}} are {{physical vapor deposition}} (PVD, usually sputter deposition, cathodic arc deposition or electron beam heating) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In both methods, pure titanium is sublimed and reacted with nitrogen in a high-energy, vacuum environment. TiN film may also be produced on Ti workpieces by reactive growth (for example, annealing) in a nitrogen atmosphere. PVD is preferred for steel parts because the deposition temperatures exceeds the <b>austenitizing</b> <b>temperature</b> of steel. TiN layers are also sputtered {{on a variety of}} higher melting point materials such as stainless steels, titanium and titanium alloys. Its high Young's modulus (values between 450 and 590 GPa {{have been reported in the}} literature [...] ) means that thick coatings tend to flake away, making them much less durable than thin ones. Titanium nitride coatings can also be deposited by thermal spraying whereas TiN powders are produced by nitridation of titanium with nitrogen or ammonia at 1200 °C.|$|E
50|$|In {{order for}} any {{transformation}} to take place, the microstructure {{of the metal}} must be austenite structure. The exact boundaries of the austenite phase region depend on the chemistry of the alloy being heat treated. However, austenitizing temperatures are typically between 790 and 915°C (1455 to 1680°F). The {{amount of time spent}} at this temperature will vary with the alloy and process specifics for a through-hardened part. The best results are achieved when austenitization is long enough to produce a fully austenitic metal microstructure (there will still be graphite present in cast irons) with a consistent carbon content. In steels this may only take a few minutes after the <b>austenitizing</b> <b>temperature</b> has been reached throughout the part section, but in cast irons it takes longer. This is because carbon must diffuse out of the graphite until it has reached the equilibrium concentration dictated by the temperature and the phase diagram. This step may be done in many types of furnaces, in a high temperature salt bath, via direct flame or induction heating. Numerous patents exist for specific methods and variations.|$|E

Results show that the network morphology of carbides could not dissolve completely and distribute equably {{in the case of}} the <b>austenitizing</b> <b>temperature</b> is 1373 K. When the <b>austenitizing</b> <b>temperature</b> reaches 1473 K, the excessive increase in temperature leads to increase in carbide dissolution, higher dissolved alloying element contents, and unwanted grain growth.

Findings: Nitrogen addition without microalloying elements increased the austenite grain size. Very high hardenability was obtained in steel containing 0. 004 %N and 0. 08 %V at 870 oC. Addition of 0. 08 %V at elevated nitrogen content significantly decreased the grain size and at 870 oC increased the hardenability of steel. Practical implications: Investigated steel showed very high hardenability with ideal critical diameter DiJ approximately 200 mm, at appropriate <b>austenitizing</b> <b>temperature.</b> Higher nitrogen content in steel with vanadium addition retards austenite grain growth in broad <b>austenitizing</b> <b>temperature</b> range. Originality/value: Results of investigations provide valuable information {{on the effect of}} vanadium and nitrogen content on the hardenability of quenched and tempered steel with 1. 8 % Cr. Thermodynamic calculations enable to select the optimum <b>austenitizing</b> <b>temperature</b> range...|$|E
40|$|Chromium {{martensitic}} hot-work {{tool steel}} (AISI H 13) {{is commonly used}} as die material in hot forming techniques such as die casting, hot rolling, extrusion and hot forging. They are developed to endure the severe conditions by high mechanical properties attained by a complex microstructure. Even though the hot-work tool steel has been improved {{over the years by}} alloying and heat treatment, damages still occur. Thermal fatigue is believed {{to be one of the}} most common failure mechanisms in hot forming tools. In this thesis tools used in hot forging and die casting were examined to determine damage, material response, thermal fatigue crack initiation and propagation. Different chromium martensitic hot-work tool steels, heat treated at four different <b>austenitizing</b> <b>temperatures</b> were experimentally tested in thermal fatigue and isothermal fatigue. The materials were then evaluated using X-ray line broadening analysis and transmission electron microscopy to explore the relation between fatigue softening and the change in microstructure. The high temperature fatigue softening was also simulated using an elasto-plastic, non-linear kinematic and isotropic model. The model was implemented in a numerical simulation to support the integration of die design, tool steel properties and its use. It was found that the dominant damage mechanisms in the investigated tools were thermal fatigue and that tool material experiences a three stage softening at high temperature loading. The primary stage was concluded to be influenced by the dislocation density and the second stage by the temper resistance i. e. carbide morphology. The microstructural changes during the softening stages were also connected to the non-linear kinematic and isotropic model. The general aim of this thesis is to increase the knowledge of the chromium martensitic hot-work tool steel damage, performance and microstructure...|$|R
40|$|One-dimensional (ID) {{model of}} any {{axisymmetric}} industrial quenched steel bar based on {{finite element method}} (FEM) {{has been applied to}} investigate the influence of process history on its material properties of seventy-five (75) cases on ten (1 0) different samples of steel. The lowest hardness point (LHP) and the effect of the radius of any steel bar on its temperature history and on LHP is determined. In this research hardness in specimen points was obtained by calculating characteristic cooling time for phase transformation (tsIs) to hardness. The model can be employed as a guideline to design cooling approach to achieve desired microstructure and mechanical properties such as hardness. A computer program of the model is developed, which can be used independently or incorporated into a temperature history software named LHP-software to continuously calculate and display temperature history of the industrial quenched steel bar and thereby calculate LHP and to study the effect of radius on temperature history and on LHP. Also the effect of different <b>austenitizing</b> <b>temperatures</b> and the effect of different quenching medium are studied. This technique (LHP-software) is more effective as compared to the conventional methods (Rockwell, Brinell, Vickers Hardness Tester,... etc) because they only used haidness calculated at the surface that is higher than LHP, which has negative consequence and can result in bending, deformation and failure of the component, as example {{it was found that the}} hardness on the surface of alloy steel 50 B 46 H [R= 12. 5 rnm, 850 O C, water quenched] = 52. 808, while LHP = 44. 953. LHPSoftware can be used instead of a number of real tools in steel industrial applications and is useful in a wide range of steel industrial field. The developed sofware based on (1 -D) FEM model has been verified by comparing its hardness results with commercial finite element software results and also validated by experimental results. The comparison indicates its validity and reliability...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAround 1970 {{quenching}} AISI 4340 steel from 1200 °C {{was discovered}} {{to lead to}} much higher fracture toughness, in the as quenched state, than by conventional austenitizing at 870 °C. Further researches have ascertained that the apparent toughness increase is limited to fracture toughness tests, whereas Charpy-V impact tests do not show any betterment due to high <b>temperature</b> <b>austenitizing,</b> in respect to conventional heat-treating. Various explanations of these contradicting results were given {{on the basis of}} the then existing theories. The puzzling phenomenon is here interpreted by means of Finite Fracture Mechanics theories, based on the contemporaneous fulfilment of a stress requirement and the energy balance...|$|R
