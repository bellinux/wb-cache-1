40|$|This study {{examines}} the extent, determinants {{and quality of}} mothers' independent use of medications for treating their children's symptoms. Data on mother-initiated medication behavior (MIMB) were obtained from a stratified systematic random sample of 500 mothers of children presenting for a well child visit at two pediatric ambulatory care sites. Six expert pediatric judges each rated every reported medication use (N = 3908) along three dimensions (usefulness, correctness and harmfulness or helpfulness) and also evaluated the overall appropriateness of each mother's MIMB. Results indicate that: (1) mothers keep available and use for children a considerable variety of different medications and medical appliances; (2) a positive linear relationship exists between mothers' socioeconomic status (SES) and degree of MIMB; (3) mothers' attitudes toward medications and toward their children's health {{are associated with the}} number of categories of medications and appliances they possess and use; (4) the combination of SES and attitudinal characteristics accounts for substantial portions of the variance in MIMB; and (5) judges' ratings show only minimal-level support of MIMB (extending to mothers in all SES groups) and are linearly related to SES (P < 0. 001). These findings emphasize the need for health care providers to review MIMB, and to provide <b>advice</b> <b>concerning</b> <b>use</b> and misuse of mother-initiated treatments...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Hygienic {{umbilical}} cord care {{is necessary for}} the well-. being of the newborn. Health education is a strong tool for lifestyle modification aimed at healthy living. This ought to extend to mothers who care for their infants' {{umbilical cord}} stump in various ways especially after discharge from hospital. The content of health education on cord care given to mothers (if any) at various health institutions which they accessed for antenatal care is thus worth evaluating. Objective: To evaluate the content of health education on cord care given to mothers at various health facilities which served as their places of antenatal care in Benin City, Nigeria. Methods: The study subjects included mothers who brought their babies to Well Baby/Immunization Clinic of the University of Benin Teaching Hospital (UBTH), Benin City, Nigeria. A structured questionnaire was used to assess their biodata, places of antenatal care, whether health education on cord care constituted part of the services received in health facilities and the content of the cord care education. Results: Of the 497 subjects studied, 487 (98. 0 %) received antenatal care (ANC) in both orthodox and unorthodox facilities. Amongst these, 352 (72. 3 %) received health education on cord care while 135 (27. 7 %) did not. Teaching and private hospitals contributed 116 (48. 9 %) and 103 (43. 5 %) respectively to the total documentation of the <b>advice</b> <b>concerning</b> <b>use</b> of methylated spirit alone. The relationship between content of health education on cord care and method of cord care practiced by mothers was statistically significant. Conclusion: Health education on cord care is lacking in some of our health facilities and where available, content may not be evidence-. based. We must equip health workers with facts required to enlighten patients. A standard and universal method of cord care should be adopted to reduce or abolish the confusion which mothers presently encounter in caring for their babies' umbilical cords...|$|E

40|$|Many African {{countries}} have introduced cost recovery mechanisms {{based on the}} sale of drugs and measures aimed at improving drug supply. This study compares prescribing and selling practices in Mali, in 3 cities where the public sector contributes differentially to the supply of drugs on the market. Multilevel models are used to analyse the content and cost of 700 medication transactions observed in 14 private and public legal points of sale. Results show that the objective of improving access to drugs seems to have been achieved in the sites studied. Costs of prescriptions were lower where public health services had been revitalized. Affordable generic drugs were accessible and widely used, even in the private sector. However, measures intended to rationalize the prescription and delivery of drugs did not always have the desired effect. While agents in the public sector tended to prescribe fewer antibiotics, injectables, or brand-name drugs, the data confirm the virtual absence of <b>advice</b> <b>concerning</b> the <b>use</b> or the side effects of the drugs in both public and private sectors. In addition, data supported the notion that {{the public and private sectors}} are closely intertwined. Notably, availability of drugs in the public sector contributed to diminishing the prices charged in the private sector. Similarly, the use that agents in the public sector made of the opportunities afforded by the presence of the private pharmaceutical sector provided another illustration of interrelatedness. Finally, the data showed that the presence of a private sector, which has not been affected by measures aimed at rationalizing prescription and sales practices, limits the effects of measures implemented in the public sector. More assertive policies, based on strategies encompassing actors in the private sector, are needed to increase the safety and effectiveness of prescription and sales practices.

40|$|An {{enhanced}} one-dimensional {{mathematical model}} for simulating flood levels and calculating stage-discharge relationships is presented. Enhanced conveyance subroutines {{have been developed}} and incorporated into the commercially available river modelling software ISIS. The newly developed software has been verified using experimental and field data. When a river overtops its banks there is a vigorous interaction between slow moving flood plain flow and faster moving main channel flow. This interaction mechanism {{has been the focus}} of intense research over the past forty years. A selective review of this research is detailed with particular attention to the case of meandering channels. The Ackers Method and the James and Wark Method are two discharge capacity methods that have emanated from this recent research and are considered to be the most practically suitable methods and are indeed recommended by the Environment Agency of England and Wales. The methods account for interaction effects when flow is overbank in a straight and meandering channel respectively. It is these methods that have been incorporated into the commercially available and industry leading one-dimensional river model ISIS to enable an enhanced conveyance calculation. The newly developed software has been tested against the Flood Channel Facility Series A and B experiments to a satisfactory level of accuracy. The testing included predicted of stage discharge relationships and water level prediction. In addition it has been applied to the River Dane in Cheshire which is highly meandering and suited to the James and Wark methodology. This was intended to give practical <b>advice</b> <b>concerning</b> the <b>use</b> of the James and Wark Method and the degree of accuracy in estimating the 'channel parameters' which are required by this method. The results of this work showed that a significant rise in water level prediction is obtained when using the enhanced code.
