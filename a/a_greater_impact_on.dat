5|$|The house sparrow's main predators are {{cats and}} birds of prey, {{but many other}} animals prey on them, {{including}} corvids, squirrels, and even humans—the house sparrow has been consumed in the past by people {{in many parts of}} the world, and it still is in parts of the Mediterranean. Most species of birds of prey have been recorded preying on the house sparrow in places where records are extensive. Accipiters and the merlin in particular are major predators, though cats are likely to have <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> house sparrow populations. The house sparrow is also a common victim of roadkill; on European roads, it is the bird most frequently found dead.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} economists, such as Macquarie Bank analyst Rory Robertson, assert that high {{immigration}} and the propensity of new arrivals to cluster {{in the capital}} cities is exacerbating the nation's housing affordability problem. According to Robertson, Federal Government policies that fuel demand for housing, such as the currently high levels of immigration, as well as capital gains tax discounts and subsidies to boost fertility, have had <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> housing affordability than land release on urban fringes.|$|E

25|$|The British {{began to}} assess the impact of the Blitz in August 1941 and the RAF Air Staff used the German {{experience}} to improve Bomber Command's offensives. They concluded bombers should strike a single target each night and use more incendiaries, because they had <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> production than high explosives. They also noted regional production was severely disrupted when city centres were devastated through the loss of administrative offices, utilities and transport. They believed the Luftwaffe had failed in precision attack and concluded the German example of area attack using incendiaries was the way forward for operations over Germany.|$|E
25|$|Hutchinson and Cederbaum (2011) studied father-daughter {{communication}} {{and found that}} increased father-daughter communication delayed sexual debut and decreased the frequency of engagement in sexual intercourse. They also found that responsible sexual behavior among adolescent females was associated with positive father-daughter communication regarding men, dating, sex, and marriage. On the other hand, fathers who were absent had been linked to higher rates of sexual activity and teen pregnancy among female adolescents. Fathers have <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> daughters than they think, but fail to recognize it because they don’t believe they should be discussing sex with their daughters or simply {{leave it to the}} mothers.|$|E

Under the previous format, the Pro12 provided a minimum of ten teams, with Scotland and Italy providing two teams each, and Ireland and Wales both providing three. The new system saw a total of seven teams, with one place now being reserved for the highest finishing Pro12 team from each of four participating countries and three other qualifiers based solely on league position. The other teams were entered in the new second-tier competition, the European Rugby Challenge Cup.|$|E

25|$|The {{trend of}} rising income {{inequality}} is also apparent after taxes and transfers. A 2011 {{study by the}} CBO found that the top earning 1 percent of households increased their income by about 275% after federal taxes and income transfers over a period between 1979 and 2007, compared to a gain of just under 40% for the 60 percent {{in the middle of}} America's income distribution. U.S. federal tax and transfer policies are progressive and therefore substantially reduce income inequality measured after taxes and transfers. They became moderately less progressive between 1979 and 2007 but slightly more progressive measured between 1979 and 2011. Income transfers had <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> reducing inequality than taxes from 1979 to 2011.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{technological}} inventions of the period– {{whether of}} Arab or Chinese origin, or unique European innovations– {{were to have}} great influence on political and social developments, in particular gunpowder, the printing press and the compass. The introduction of gunpowder {{to the field of}} battle affected not only military organisation, but helped advance the nation state. Gutenberg's movable type printing press made possible not only the Reformation, but also a dissemination of knowledge that would lead to a gradually more egalitarian society. The compass, along with other innovations such as the cross-staff, the mariner's astrolabe, and advances in shipbuilding, enabled the navigation of the World Oceans, and the early phases of colonialism. Other inventions had <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> everyday life, such as eyeglasses and the weight-driven clock.|$|E
25|$|The {{establishment}} of the new Republic of Zimbabwe in 1980 sounded the death knell for white political power and ushered {{in a new era}} of black majority rule. White emigration peaked between 1980 and 1982 at 53,000 persons, with the breakdown of law and order, an increase in crime in the rural areas, and the provocative attitude of Zimbabwean officials being cited as the main causes. Political conditions typically had <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> the decision to migrate among white than black professionals. Between 1982 and 2000 Zimbabwe registered a net loss of 100,000 whites, or an average of 5,000 departures per year. A second wave of white emigration was sparked by President Robert Mugabe's violent land reform programme after 2000. Popular destinations included South Africa and Australia, which emigrants perceived to be geographically, culturally, or sociopolitically similar to their home country.|$|E

25|$|World War II had <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> {{the novel}} than in poetry. It ended {{the careers of}} some novelists and delayed the start of others. Many major Scottish post-war novelists, such as Robin Jenkins (1912–2005), Jessie Kesson (1916–94), Muriel Spark (1918–2006), Alexander Trocchi (1925–84) and James Kennaway (1928–68) spent much or {{most of their lives}} outside Scotland, but often dealt with Scottish themes. Jenkins major novels such as The Cone Gatherers (1955), The Changeling (1958) and Fergus Lamont (1978) focused on working-class {{dilemmas}} in a world without spiritual consolation. Very different in tone, Spark produced novels that explored modern social life as in her only two overtly Scottish novels The Ballad of Peckham Rye (1960) and the Edinburgh-set The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (1961). Successful mass-market works included the action novels of Alistair MacLean (1922–87), and the historical fiction of Dorothy Dunnett (b. 1923). A younger generation of novelists that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s included Allan Massie (b. 1938), Shena Mackay (b. 1944) and Alan Spence (b. 1947). Massie's work often deals with historical themes while aware of the limitations of historical objectivity, as in his Augustus (1986), Tiberius (1991) and The Ragged Lion (1994). Working class identity continued to be a major theme in the post-war novel and can be seen in Archie Hind's (1928–2008) The Dear Green Place (1966), Alan Sharp's (1934–2013) A Green Tree in Gedde (1965), George Friel's (1910–75) Mr Alfred M.A. (1972) and William McIlvanney's (b. 1936) Docherty (1975).|$|E
25|$|Adolescence marks a {{rapid change}} in one's role within a family. Young {{children}} tend to assert themselves forcefully, but are unable to demonstrate much influence over family decisions until early adolescence, when they are increasingly viewed by parents as equals. The adolescent faces the task of increasing independence while preserving a caring relationship {{with his or her}} parents. When children go through puberty, there is often a significant increase in parent–child conflict and a less cohesive familial bond. Arguments often concern minor issues of control, such as curfew, acceptable clothing, and the adolescent's right to privacy, which adolescents may have previously viewed as issues over which their parents had complete authority. Parent-adolescent disagreement also increases as friends demonstrate <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> one another, new influences on the adolescent that may be in opposition to parents' values. Social media has also played an increasing role in adolescent and parent disagreements. While parents never had to worry about the threats of social media in the past, it has become a dangerous place for children. While adolescents strive for their freedoms, the unknowns to parents of what their child is doing on social media sites is a challenging subject, due to the increasing amount of predators on social media sites. Many parents have very little knowledge of social networking sites {{in the first place and}} this further increases their mistrust. An important challenge for the parent–adolescent relationship is to understand how to enhance the opportunities of online communication while managing its risks. Although conflicts between children and parents increase during adolescence, these are just relatively minor issues. Regarding their important life issues, most adolescents still share the same attitudes and values as their parents.|$|E

500|$|According to {{analysis}} by the political scientist John Curtice and psephologist Michael Steed, [...] "only {{a handful of the}} Conservatives' losses of seats can be blamed on the intervention of the Referendum Party". Their estimate was that only four seats would have been Conservative without the Referendum Party standing.

On employing aggregate constituency data, Ian McAllister and Donley T. Studlar disagreed, arguing that the Referendum Party had <b>a</b> <b>greater</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> the Conservatives than previous research suggested. They argued that the Referendum Party cost the Conservatives an average of 3.4% of the vote.
