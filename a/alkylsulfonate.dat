The effect of the particle size, pulp pH, depressor, shearing strength and shearing time on shear flocculation flotation for hematite was investigated. And the main mechanism of shear flocculation flotation for hematite was analysed and studied by means of interface double layer theory, DLVO and EDLVO theory, shear flocculation theory and basic principles of collision theory. The results show that {{on the condition of}} collector usage 4 kg/t, pH of pulp 3, grinding fineness(- 0. 037 mm) 90 %, conditioning time 2 min, shearing strength 2000 r/min and shearing time 7 min, the higher iron recovery of 92. 4 % is obtained.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of polyaniline with <b>alkylsulfonate</b> dopants {{have been investigated}} at the atomic level using quantum mechanical methods. Calculations have been performed on complexes formed by dopant molecules with an alkyl group ranging from methyl to nonyl and model oligoanilines of different sizes. The stabilization provided by {{the formation of the}} alkylsulfonate···oligoaniline complexes (70 − 90 kcal/mol) is significantly higher than that found for conventional hydrogen bonds (5 − 12 kcal/mol) but lower than that obtained for methylsulfate···alkylammonium and methylsulfate···Na+ systems (120 − 135 kcal/mol). On the other hand, the influence of size of the alkyl group contained in the dopant on the interaction is practically negligible, whereas, in opposition, the number of aniline units used to represent polyaniline significantly affects the energetics of the interaction. Specifically, the interaction energy of an alkyl-dopant molecule and an infinite polyaniline chain has been predicted to be around − 65 kcal/mol. The overall results allow the conclusion that the interaction between <b>alkylsulfonate</b> dopants and polyaniline is a very local phenomenon. Postprint (published version...|$|E

Their antimalarial activities were evaluated in vitro against P. falciparum and in vivo against P. vinckei in mice to define structure-activity relationships.

Due to the formation of micelles the reaction proceeds in the absence of organic solvents. Examination of a series of lanthanide(III) and divalent transition-metal dodecylsulfates as catalysts for the reaction between benzaldehyde and tetraallyltin revealed that the highest yields can be obtained when lanthanide(III) and copper(II) salts are used. Within 6 h at room temperature nearly quantitative conversion of benzaldehyde to 1 -phenyl- 3 -buten- 1 -ol was achieved in the presence of 10 mol% of Cu(DOS) 2 or Yb(DOS) 3. The influence of the amount of catalyst and tetraallyltin on the reaction yield was investigated. Different alkylsulfates, <b>alkylsulfonates</b> and arylsulfonates metal salts were prepared and tested as catalysts in the allylation reaction. The highest yields were obtained with ytterbium(III) alkylsulfates and ytterbium(III) arylsulfonates, while ytterbium(III) <b>alkylsulfonates</b> were found to be poor allylation catalysts.

40|$|The {{influence}} of 13 anticancer alkylating agents on cell proliferation, cell cycle parameters, and morphonuclear characteristics was monitored in vitro on three neoplastic cell lines. This monitoring {{was carried out}} by means of the digital cell image analysis of Feulgen-stained nuclei. This computer-assisted microscope analysis of chromatin texture made it possible to assess 15 morphonuclear parameters. These 15 parameters were submitted to multivariate analyses, that is, principal-components analyses followed by the canonical transformation of the data. The 13 alkylating agents included four nitrogen mustards (chlormethine, chlorambucil, melphalan, and cyclophosphamide), two nitrosoureas (carmustine and lomustine), two platinum analogues (cisplatine and carboplatine), two ethyleneimine derivatives (thiotepa and investigational PE 1001), one antibiotic (mitomycin C), one <b>alkylsulfonate</b> (busulfan), and one triazene (dacarbazine). The mouse MXT mammary and the human J 82 and T 24 bladder tumor cell lines were used in this study. The results show that these alkylating agents induced specific modifications to the chromatin pattern according to the subclass to which they belong. In other words, the multivariate statistical analyses of the 15 parameters made it possible to identify, at least partly, distinct subclasses of alkylating agents according to their mechanisms of action. As a validation of the methodology, the results also show that most of the alkylating agents induced an increase in the percentage of cells in the G 2 phase, while some sometimes induced an increase in the percentage of cells in the S phase of the cell cycle.

40|$|Improved {{understanding}} {{and performance of}} the alkaline-side CSEX process has been obtained through the characterization of impurity effects that hinder complete stripping of cesium from the solvent. It is shown in this report that tests of the alkaline-side CSEX process conducted {{in the summer and}} fall of 1998 were complicated by the presence of common surfactant anions, undecyl- and dodecylsulfonate, as trace impurities in the two simulants tested. This conclusion was drawn from the results of a series of systematic extraction tests followed by a definitive identification by electrospray mass spectrometry (ES-MS). Based on this understanding, a straightforward preventative measure involving the addition of a lipophilic tertiary amine extractant at a small concentration to the solvent is proposed and demonstrated. As part of the task ''Fission Product Solvent Extraction'' supported by the Efficient Separations and Processing Crosscutting Program within the USDOE Office of Environmental Management, the alkaline-side CSEX process has been developed for removal of radio-cesium ({sup 137 }Cs) from alkaline high-level wastes stored in underground tanks at the Hanford Site and Savannah River Site (SRS). As described in a previous report, tests conducted in Fiscal Year 1998 generally demonstrated performance meeting the requirements for cesium removal from the waste to be treated at the SRS. However, discrepancies in stripping behavior were shown to arise from unidentified differences ''in the batches of waste simulant employed for testing. Various effects such as solvent impurities, kinetics, contacting method, and counting method were eliminated as possible causes of the observed discrepancies. Tests in Fiscal Year 1999 reported herein confirmed the earlier suspicion that the simulants contained lipophilic anionic impurities. Extraction tests demonstrated that the impurities could be concentrated in the solvent, and by ES-MS in the negative-ion mode it was possible to identify the harmful impurities as undecyl- and dodecylsulfonate. Subsequent tests with purchased sodium dodecylsulfonate confirmed that this surfactant could produce decreased stripping performance of the magnitude equivalent to that observed when using the simulant associated with the worse performance. With the identification of the impurity now settled, it is clear that poor stripping arises from ion-pair species in the solvent comprised of the cesium-extractant complex cation and the <b>alkylsulfonate</b> anion. Because the Gibbs energy of transfer of this anion and the complexation of the cesium cation by the extractant are both so favorable, the stripping of the cesium, nitrate from the solvent is correspondingly unfavorable. Thus, once the cesium associated with nitrate ion in the solvent has been stripped, further stripping of the remaining cesium in the solvent becomes inefficient. A simple remedy is the addition of a lipophilic amine such as trioctylamine to the solvent. This well-known amine extractant, once proposed for reprocessing, remains neutral and essentially inert during extraction of the alkaline waste but converts to the trioctylammonium nitrate salt on scrubbing and stripping. This lipophilic salt remains in the organic phase and allows the final traces of cesium in the solvent to be stripped by supplying the <b>alkylsulfonate</b> impurity in the solvent with equivalent cationic charges. Further results regarding this and other improvements to the solvent system will be described elsewhere...|$|E
40|$|The {{main focus}} of this project was the {{nanoscale}} patterning of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of alkanethiols on gold. This has involved continuing development of scanning near-field photolithography (SNP) {{as a tool for}} nanofabrication. SNP is a new technique that uses a scanning near-field optical microscope (SNOM) coupled to a UV laser to create nanoscale structures. The maximum resolution of conventional photolithography is 'AJ 2 which is governed by the diffraction limit, SNOM can improve this by using a small aperture (50 nm) and holding the probe very close to the sample (10 - 15 run), thus limiting diffraction. SNP uses this to create features much smaller than the diffraction limit for 244 run light to the order ofA/ 30 or 9 run. The majority of this work has been on SAMs of alkanethiols on gold, but also alkanethiols on palladium have been used. These basic systems have been studied by various surface science techniques such as contact angle goniometry, atomic force microscopy (AFM), friction force microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and also surface plasmon resonance to study protein attachment. The attachment of biological molecules was examined by either organic reactions on the surface and photochemical attachment. These were subsequently patterned using micronscale photolithography and SNP. Photolithography of SAMs used UV light to perform photooxidation of surface bound alkanethiols, converting them to <b>alkylsulfonates.</b> <b>Alkylsulfonates</b> are weakly bound to the surface and can be replaced by an opposing thiol and therefore make a bifunctional pattern. This can be used for micronscale patterns. These were also used to pattern biological structures and for the study of alkanethiols as etch resists to a novel etchant (mercaptoethylamine). Using mercaptoethylamine etchant with SNP allowed the fabrication of extremely small structures using a high scanning speed on the SNOM. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAccording to the proton {{buffering}} model, {{introduced by}} Klingenberg, UCP 1 conducts protons through a hydrophilic pathway lined with fatty acid head groups that buffer the protons {{as they move}} across the membrane. According to the fatty acid protonophore model, introduced by Garlid, UCPs do not conduct protons at all. Rather, like all members of this gene family, they are anion carriers. A variety of anions are transported, but the physiological substrates are fatty acid (FA) anions. Because the carboxylate head group is translocated by UCP, and because the protonated FA rapidly diffuses across the membrane, this mechanism permits FA to behave as regulated cycling protonophores. Favoring the latter mechanism {{is the fact that}} the head group of long-chain <b>alkylsulfonates,</b> strong acid analogues of FA, is also translocated by UCP...|$|R

The ability of high charge density inorganic salts, such as K 3 PO 4, to promote phase segregation in aqueous solutions containing the ionic liquids 1, 3 -dimethylimidazolium methylsulfonate ([C(1) mim][C 1 SO 3]), 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium hexylsulfonate ([C(2) mim][C 6 SO 3]), 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium butylsulfonate ([C(2) mim][C 4 SO 3]), 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium methylsulfonate ([C(4) mim][C 1 SO 3]), 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium ethylsulfonate ([C(4) mim][C 2 SO 3]), 1 -pentyl- 3 -methylimidazolium methylsulfonate ([C(5) mim][C 1 SO 3]), 1 -hexyl- 3 -methylimidazolium methylsulfonate ([C(6) mim][C 1 SO 3]) and 1 -hexyl- 3 -methylimidazolium ethylsulfonate ([C(6) mim][C 2 SO 3]) was experimentally determined at 298. 15 K and atmospheric pressure. In general, the hydrophobicity of the ionic liquids studied {{is affected by the}} increase of the alkyl chain length. However, the position of the alkyl chain, whether in the cation or in the anion affects in a different way the lipophilic effect of the ionic liquid. Two ionic liquids with the same number of carbon atoms, the one with a longer chain in the anion is the more hydrophobic. Furthermore, four ionic liquids were chosen to extract the aminoacid L-tryptophan from aqueous solutions. The chain lengths of the anion or cation were fixed and the partition coefficients compared. The extractions, carried out at 298. 15 K, showed the good extractive power of these ionic liquids and also that the less hydrophobic ionic liquids have the better extraction coefficients. Overall, the results from this work identify relations between the length and position of the alkyl chain with the hydrophobicity and also with the extractive power of the imidazolium-alkylsulfonate based ionic liquids.

This technique enables the possibility for direct injection onto a capillary for detection {{without the need for}} pre-concentration of sample and with minimal sample preparative steps prior to analysis. In this bioassay, a group of Fischer based cyanine dyes and two Oxazine (Nile red) derivatives were designed for further optimization as key Vis-NIR fluorescent substrate. In developing this technique, the test dyes were first assessed for their photophysical properties, based on four criteria; (1) photostable (2) solvatochromism (3) binding affinity towards both the monooxygenase active site and serum albumin and (4) chemical stability in strong electric field strength. Applying key dye characterization procedures including; molar absorptivity determination, quantum yield determination, photostability, solvatochromism and protein interaction studies it was determined that the Fischer indolium cyanine dyes were most suitable for the method development. The data revealed that under the test conditions, reduced flavin, the oxidative monooxygenase catalytically specifically converts the <b>alkylsulfonate</b> substituted cyanine dyes to the corresponding aldehyde. This new bioassay has proven to be quick, portable, sensitive, reliable and the exhibit the possibility of ‘on-the-spot’ detection; advantages not readily realized with other commonly applied techniques such as PCR, SPR, ELISA and GC used to study bacterial sulfur assimilation processes. In addition, recent literature results proposed by other research groups developing similar techniques showed strong reliance on GC analyses. Those assays involve the use of low molecular weight straight chain non-emissive alkanesulfonate substrates. Once enzyme catalysis occurs the aldehyde is formed becomes rather volatile and requires complex and tedious headspace sampling for GC analyses. This feature limits the in vitro applicability and eliminated the possibility in vivo development.

In order to evaluate the cytotoxic activity of metal adducts, the need to substitute organic solvents with water, solvent cheap and non-toxic, has received attention; therefore, the typical strategy is to modify compounds by attaching phase tags. In particular, water soluble groups such as esters, sulfonates and carboxylates have been used for this purpose. New N-heterocyclic carbene ligand precursors {H 2 C(HTzR) 2 } and {H 2 C(HImR) 2 } (HTz = 1, 2, 4 -triazole; HIm = imidazole; R = PrSO 3 or EtCOO) were obtained starting from the compounds bis(1, 2, 4 -triazol- 1 -yl) methane and bis(imidazol- 1 -yl) methane. [3] The related silver(I) carbene complexes were obtained resulting in well-characterized and water soluble bimetallic compounds of general formula {Na 2 [H 2 C(TzR) 2] 2 Ag 2 } and {Na 2 [H 2 C(ImR) 2] 2 Ag 2 }. We are now developing the chemistry of new water soluble zwitterionic mono-NHC ligands, where imidazolium rings have two <b>alkylsulfonate</b> or alkylcarboxylate side arms, synthesizing the hydrophilic carbene ligand precursors{HIm 4 R, 5 R} (R = PrSO 3 or CH 2 COOEt) and the related silver(I) carbene complexes {(Im 4 R, 5 R) AgCl}. The silver(I) complexes and the homoleptic gold(I) compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxic activity towards a panel of several human tumour cell lines...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFatty acids {{activate}} the uncoupling protein UCP 1 by a still controversial mechanism. Two {{models have been}} put forward where the fatty acid operates as either substrate (“fatty acid cycling hypothesis”) or prosthetic group (“proton buffering model”). Two sets of experiments that should help to discriminate between the two hypothetical mechanisms are presented. We show that undecanosulfonate activates UCP 1 in respiring mitochondria under conditions identical to those required for the activation by fatty acids. Since <b>alkylsulfonates</b> cannot cross the lipid bilayer, these experiments rule out the fatty acid cycling hypothesis as the mechanism of uncoupling. We also demonstrate that without added nucleotides and upon careful removal of endogenous fatty acids, brown adipose tissue (BAT) mitochondria from cold-adapted hamsters respire at the full uncoupled rate. Addition of nucleotides lower the respiratory rate tenfold. The high activity observed {{in the absence of}} the two regulatory ligands is an indication that UCP 1 displays an intrinsic proton conductance that is fatty acid-independent. We propose that the fatty acid uncoupling mediated by other members of the mitochondrial transporter family probably involves a carrier to pore transition and therefore has little in common with the activation of UCP 1...|$|R
40|$|A {{simple but}} useful {{experimental}} method for {{observation of the}} effects of organic modifiers in the stationary phase in reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) is reported. An octadecylsilica (ODS) -packed column, used before and after treatment with low molecular weight alcohols (methanol, ethanol, 1 -propanol, and 1 -butanol), was employed for analysis of two groups of water-soluble model analytes by RPLC with water as the mobile phase. The first group was a mixture of 14 species of nucleosides and their bases and was used to represent hydrogen-bonding analytes, whilst the second group was a mixture of seven <b>alkylsulfonates</b> used to represent hydrophobic analytes. For both groups of analytes, alcohol-modified ODS stationary phases gave higher resolution and a shorter retention time than untreated ODS. These differences in chromatographic performance showed that the alcohol was adsorbed onto the stationary phase and influenced the elution of the target analytes. The adsorbed alcohol is postulated to decrease the overall hydrophobicity of the stationary phase and also to introduce a hydrogen-bonding interaction with suitable analytes. The resultant changes in retention and separation selectivity exhibited by the alcohol-modified stationary phases are dependent on the relative magnitudes of these effects. This behaviour is illustrated using the two groups of target analytes...|$|R
40|$|The {{kinetics}} of the S(N) 2 {{reaction of}} a series of aromatic <b>alkylsulfonates</b> with water and bromide ions in membrane mimetic media have been investigated. These media include vesicles formed from only synthetic amphiphiles, vesicles composed only of phospholipids and mixtures of these components. Special focus is placed on the influence of the addition of n-dodecyl-beta-glucoside as a mimic for glycolipids. The kinetic data have been analyzed by using the pseudophase model for bimolecular reactions. Contrary to previous results on a base-catalyzed E 2 reaction (Org. Biomol. Chem. 2004, 2, 1789 - 1799), the presence of n-dodecyl-beta-glucoside at the vesicular surface does not lead to large rate accelerations for the SN 2 reaction. In fact, when present at 50 mol % (i. e., the additive covers 34 % of the vesicular surface) these glycolipid mimics appear not to affect the bimolecular rate constants, but they only decrease the local water concentration by about 40 %. The reactivity of water at the surface of vesicles that are formed from cationic amphiphiles appears to be increased about 10 -fold relative to the reactivity of water in the bulk liquid, whereas in zwitterionic vesicles the reactivity is comparable to that in bulk water. The obtained rate constants are also compared to micellar rate constants...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the phase behavior and microstructure {{for a series}} of salt-free catanionic surfactants of the type Cm+Cn- with varied chain length mismatch (m not equal n), using light microscopy, DSC, turbidity, surface tension, SAXS and SANS. The compounds consist of alkyltrimethylammonium <b>alkylsulfonates,</b> denoted by TA(m) So(n). Depending on the asymmetry between both ions, three regimes can be identified: (i) weakly asymmetric; (ii) approximately symmetric; and (iii) highly asymmetric. For the TA(16) So(n) compounds, with n = 8 and 9 (weakly asymmetric), the surfactant forms a lamellar phase in water, however, with a striking miscibility gap. This miscibility gap is a consequence of the concentration dependent bilayer charge density. For n = 8, also a temperature-dependent vesicle-to-micelle transition at low surfactant concentration is observed. When the mismatch is low (n = 10) only a non-swelling lamellar phase is formed (approximately symmetric regime). For high mismatch, (n = 6 and 7) an extensive micellar phase is obtained - highly asymmetric regime. Conversely, for the TA(m) So(8) compounds, where m = 12 and 14, the unconventional lamellar miscibility gap and vesicle-micelle transition are again present. These findings are rationalized by considering the effect of film charge density-arising from the chain solubility difference-on the spontaneous curvature and balance of colloidal forces. The type of phase behavior reported here should be extensive to other families of salt-free catanionic amphiphiles, where an appropriate tuning of the solubility mismatch can allow the control of self-assembly...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work the {{mixtures}} water - sodium decylsulfate (C 10 OS) - poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) and water - sodium decylsulfonate (C 10 S) - PVP {{have been investigated}} by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy employing 4 -(N, N-dimethyl-N-(2 -hydroxyethyl)) ammonium- 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethyl-piperidine- 1 -oxyl chloride (TEMPO-choline, TC) as spin probe. TC cations condense {{on the surface of}} the aggregates formed by anionic surfactants, acting as counterions, and fit their NO moiety in the outer shell of the hydrophobic core. In water - C 10 OS - PVP mixtures the nitrogen isotropic hyperfine coupling constant of TC ([A(N) ]), reported as a function of the surfactant molality at constant PVP composition, shows two breakpoints: the former (critical aggregation concentration, c. a. c.) corresponds to the formation of surfactant - polymer clusters while the latter (c(2)) corresponds to the formation of free surfactant micelles. The trend of the correlation time (tau(C)) of the nitroxides in the same system shows that the electrostatic repulsion among the clusters formed onto the PVP macromolecules favours a broadening of the polymer coil and a stiffening of its chain. In contrast, in water - C 10 S - PVP mixtures no surfactant - polymer interaction could be detected. The effect of the molecular structure of the surfactant headgroup on the surfactant - polymer interaction has been discussed in terms of charge density distribution. In order to further highlight the importance of the headgroup molecular structure on the surfactant association behaviour, the micellisation process of the sodium alkylsulfates (CnOS, n = 6, 8, 10) has been investigated by the same experimental approach, and the results have been compared with those, previously reported (A. M. Tedeschi, G. D'Errico, E. Busi, R. Basosi and V. Barone, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2002, 4, 2180, ref. 46), relative to the sodium <b>alkylsulfonates</b> (CnS). CnOS micelles are more ordered and compact with respect to the CnS ones. For the former class of surfactants the electrostatic interaction with TC is stronger and the hydrophobic behaviour of the TC solubilization site is higher...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} a systematic {{study on the}} use of latex-coated stationary phases for on-column ion-exchange preconcentration of anions by capillary electrochromatography with elution by a transient isotachophoretic gradient. Fully functionalised quaternary ammonium latex particles were electrostatically bound to open tubular (OT) capillaries and porous monolithic capillary columns. These columns were characterised and provided a reproducible and simple means for creating ion-exchange stationary phases with reversed electroosmotic flow. Monolithic columns provide a chromatographic support of high surface area, high phase ratio and are highly permeable. Adsorption of latex-particles provides superior mass-transfer properties ideal for ion-exchange preconcentration and ion-exchange capillary electrochromatography (IE-CEC). The prepared columns were characterised by their retention in IE-CEC when the ion-exchange interaction was varied through manipulating the strength and nature of the competing ion. Porosimetry and scanning electron microscopy were used to characterise the monolithic surface and architecture. Up to 300, 000 plates/column were achieved using latex-coated silica monolithic columns and 164, 000 plates/column were achieved on methacrylate analogues. Both silica and methacrylate latex-coated monolithic columns were of similar capacity and around 20 times greater when compared to OT counterparts. A monolayer coverage of latex particles was not evident on the monolithic columns created and resulted in mixed mode interaction for the separation of organic anions on a polymer support. Multi-mode columns were created using zero-dead volume unions to attach a second capillary segment for the purpose of separation and detection and allowed individual optimisation of the discrete segments. Decoupling of the preconcentration column allowed in situ preconcentration of a river water sample, which was brought back to the laboratory for analysis. Novel discontinuous electrolyte combinations were used to increase the range of analytes which could be preconcentrated and detected. <b>Alkylsulfonates</b> were found to be ideal strong electrolytes of low electrophoretic mobility and were able to efficiently elute a large range of inorganic and organic anions. Further efforts to increase the range of anions which can be preconcentrated and detected included the use of a miniaturised capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detector and indirect UV detection. High capacity monolithic columns were suitable for sample-cleanup procedures and were applied to the preconcentration of iodide in Southern Ocean seawater. Detection limits of 11 pM were achieved for iodide when selective focusing occurred at the isotachophoretic boundary using IE-CEC...|$|R
40|$|In this PhD project, new {{procedures}} were investigated for various important organic reactions. Nowadays, organic procedures {{should not only}} result in high reaction yields and purity but moreover they should be designed to be environmentally friendly as well. Therefore, a proper choice of catalyst and solvent is an important aspect. In this study, greener solvents such as ionic liquids, water and rather unhazardous organic solvents were used. Moreover, this PhD research {{was focused on the}} use of lanthanide complexes in catalysis. The optimal reaction conditions as well as the role of the lanthanide ion in the reaction mechanism were investigated. Besides cerium(IV) -mediated reactions in ionic liquids, the use of lanthanide(III) compounds as strong Lewis acids was examined for the catalysis of various organic reactions. Currently, acid-catalyzed organic synthesis is mostly performed using mineral acids or Lewis acids such as AlCl 3, ZnCl 2, BF 3, TiCl 4, SnCl 4, BF 3 ·OEt 2, … However, these conventional Lewis acids are often required in stoichiometric amounts and are not stable in the presence of water. In addition, large amounts of waste are formed during the work-up procedure as these Lewis acids can not be recovered and reused. Hence, new procedures in which less waste is produced are desired. During the last decade, lanthanide(III) triflates have been widely studied for numerous organic reactions to overcome the drawbacks of conventional Lewis acids. However, the disadvantages of triflate salts include their high cost and the fact that one needs to handle the corrosive triflic acid for their preparation. Based on the work of the groups of Kobayashi and Braddock concerning lanthanide(III) triflates, we investigated the use of lanthanide(III) salts of less corrosive and much cheaper aromatic sulfonic acids, such as p-toluenesulfonic acid and nitrobenzenesulfonic acids, as new Lewis acid catalysts. Lanthanide(III) tosylates and nitrobenzenesulfonates are straightforwardly prepared from the respective lanthanide(III) oxide and sulfonic acid. From the results presented in chapter 3, {{it can be seen that}} these complexes efficiently catalyze a variety of reactions like the nitration of aromatic compounds, the acylation of alcohols and the synthesis of calix[4]resorcinarenes. Complete conversion can already be obtained with only a few mol% of catalyst and moreover these catalysts are easily recovered and reused without loss in efficiency and selectivity. The presence of water in the reaction system does not deactivate the catalyst and even hydrated lanthanide(III) salts are effective. Besides trivalent lanthanides, commercially available iron(III) tosylate was also found to be an effective and recyclable catalyst. In addition, we have shown that lanthanide(III) chloride hydrates were also rather efficient catalysts for the acylation of alcohols and the formation of calix[4]resorcinarenes. Although lanthanide(III) chloride hydrates were also reusable and only required in catalytic amounts, their widespread use will probably be limited by solubility problems. Moreover, comparison of ytterbium(III) tosylate and ytterbium(III) chloride showed that ytterbium(III) tosylate is a somewhat superior catalyst. Additionally, hazardous solvents were avoided where possible. The nitration of aromatics for example could be performed in heptane, which is a less hazardous reaction solvent than the 1, 2 -dichloroethane nowadays used for this reaction. The results presented in chapter 3 demonstrated the efficiency of lanthanide(III) tosylates and nitrobenzenesulfonates as catalysts for various reactions and hence it is worth to extend the use of these catalysts for other Lewis acid-catalyzed reactions. Kobayashi and coworkers also reported that lanthanide(III) triflates can be used to perform reactions in water if a water-soluble organic solvent is added to solubilize the organic reagents. To overcome this solubility problem an anionic surfactant can be added to the Lewis acid. This lead to the development of Lewis acid-surfactant combined catalysts (LASCs). The use of LASCs has extensively been studied for some reactions as for example the aldol reaction but remained largely unexplored for reactions as for example the allylation of aldehydes. Our results in chapter 4 proved that lanthanide(III) and copper(II) surfactant-combined catalysts could efficiently be used in the allylation of benzaldehyde with tetraallyltin in water. Due to the formation of micelles the reaction could be achieved in the absence of organic solvents. Our results indicated that both the cation and the anion have a strong influence on the reactivity of the LASC. Variation of the anion showed that better results were obtained in the order alkylsulfates > arylsulfonates > <b>alkylsulfonates</b> with the highest conversions when using lanthanide(III) or copper(II) dodecylsulfate catalysts. Complete conversion was already obtained at room temperature after a few hours when using a few mol% of copper(II) dodecylsulfate, whereas the use of lanthanide(III) dodecylsulfate required a few hours more. Lewis acid-surfactant-combined catalysts act both as a catalyst activating the substrate molecules and as a surfactant forming micelles. Consequently, they allow the use of water as the reaction medium, which is both economically and environmentally beneficial. In the last decades an enormous interest has arisen in the use of ionic liquids as ‘green solvents’. Based on the research performed in our group by Mehdi, cerium(IV) -mediated reactions in ionic liquids were further explored. The use of CAN, (NH 4) 2 Ce(NO 3) 6, was studied for the oxidation and nitration of naphthalene and 2 -methylnaphthalene in 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium triflate, [emim][OTf]. Depending on the reaction conditions, the outcome of these CAN-mediated reactions could be directed towards nitration or oxidation. However, stoichiometric amounts of the cerium salt were required for these oxidation reactions. In order to obtain an attractive procedure, reuse of the cerium-containing ionic liquid is desirable. Our experiments proved that the cerium(III) salt, obtained after the oxidation reaction of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, could to a large extent be reoxidized to cerium(IV) directly in the ionic liquid and this cerium(IV) -containing ionic liquid could then be reused for subsequent oxidation reactions. To the best of our knowledge this is the first proof of principle that a cerium(IV) -containing ionic liquid could be reused for several oxidation reactions by electrochemical reoxidation of the cerium(III) salt. status: publishe...|$|R
