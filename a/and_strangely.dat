5|$|One of Lem's major {{recurring}} themes, beginning {{from his}} very first novel, The Man from Mars, was the impossibility of communication between profoundly alien beings, which may have no common ground with human intelligence, and humans. The best known example is the living planetary ocean in Lem's novel Solaris. Other examples include swarms of mechanical insects (in The Invincible), <b>and</b> <b>strangely</b> ordered societies of more human-like beings in Fiasco and Eden, describing {{the failure of the}} first contact. In His Master's Voice, Lem describes the failure of humanity's intelligence to decipher and truly comprehend an apparent message from space.|$|E
25|$|From 1647 Mackworth's {{power was}} {{consolidated}} in Shropshire and expanded in Wales and the Welsh marches to become regional in scope. His governorship was recognised again by Parliament on 24 March 1647, specifying Shrewsbury Castle as its seat. The difficulties of governing {{were similar to}} those experienced not only by other parliamentarian governors, like Colonel Hutchinson at Nottingham but also by Ottley and the other royalist governors of Shrewsbury. Financial pressures were enormous and continuous. In June Mackworth was nominated by the Commons as one of the commissioners to raise the vast <b>and</b> <b>strangely</b> precise sum of £5531 19s. 9¾d. monthly from Shropshire to finance Fairfax's army and military operations in Ireland. There were the problems of dealing with the royalist gentry who had been defeated, as well as with continued royalist activity. There were also significant divisions in the parliamentarian ranks. All of these problems had to confronted while retaining a fair measure of support from the population of the town and the county.|$|E
25|$|While local (to a {{database}} system) relaxed serializability methods compromise serializability for performance gain (and are utilized {{only when the}} application can tolerate possible resulting inaccuracies, or its integrity is unharmed), it is unclear that various proposed relaxed global serializability methods which compromise global serializability, provide any performance gain over commitment ordering which guarantees global serializability. Typically, the declared intention of such methods has not been performance gain over effective global serializability methods (which apparently have been unknown to the inventors), but rather correctness criteria alternatives {{due to lack of}} a known effective global serializability method. Oddly, some of them were introduced years after CO had been introduced, and some even quote CO without realizing that it provides an effective global serializability solution, and thus without providing any performance comparison with CO to justify them as alternatives to global serializability for some applications (e.g., Two-level serializability). Two-level serializability is even presented as a major global concurrency control method in a 2010 edition of a text-book on databases (authored by two of the original authors of Two-level serializability, where one of them, Avi Silberschatz, is also an author of the original Strong recoverability articles). This book neither mentions CO nor references it, <b>and</b> <b>strangely,</b> apparently does not consider CO a valid Global serializability solution.|$|E

25|$|When Lindsay Hassett {{retired after}} the 1953 Ashes Series his vice-captain Arthur Morris was not {{appointed}} {{to succeed him}} because he was not a state captain. In 1954-55 Australia had not played a Test series since and the selectors were divided as to who should be captain. As with everything else down under cricket was divided between the power centres of Sydney, New South Wales and Melbourne, Victoria. The fast bowling all-rounder Keith Miller was captain of New South Wales and the winner of the 1954-55 Sheffield Shield. He had the obvious advantage of being an automatic selection for the Australian team, and was a charismatic and inspirational leader on the field. Against him was his cavalier approach to the game and that he was little inclined to enforce discipline. His rival was the captain of Victoria, the off-spinner Ian Johnson. Johnson had been little used on the 1948 tour and was left behind in 1953 and was not an automatic selection for the Test team. However, {{he was the son of}} the Test selector William Johnson, had attended the elite Wesley College. Lindsay Hassett and the chairman of selectors Don Bradman favoured Johnson and he was appointed captain by the A.C.B.. Unlike Miller he was seen as a safe pair of hands and he was an astute captain and a fine ambassador for Australian cricket, but not everybody was happy with the choice. Frank Tyson reckoned that his innings victory in the First Test cost Australia the series as it confirmed Johnson in the captaincy, whereas Miller might have won the next three vital Tests. As it was vice-captain Arthur Morris was blamed for the defeat in Sydney <b>and</b> (<b>strangely)</b> Melbourne and the selectors stuck by Johnson. He went on to captain the successful Australian tour of the West Indies in 1954-55, where his diplomacy ensured that he did not suffer the same problems as Len Hutton in 1953-54, and his captaincy was considered to be equal to that of Richie Benaud. He retired after the Australian tour of England, Pakistan and India in 1956, where he again failed to regain the Ashes after being 1-0 up in the series.|$|E

In a 2002 review for Mojo, Charles Shaar Murray described the song as [...] "eerie, serpentine" [...] and [...] "a fine and worthy companion for Peppers Within You Without You".

Newell Todd of CHUD.com gave the film a score of 7 out of ten and considered it [...] "an entertaining film that is only made better with some McQueen action". Writing under the username [...] "Quint", Eric Vespe of Ain't It Cool News complimented it as [...] "sexy, funny, violent, exciting, fun <b>and</b> <b>strangely</b> experimental". Casey Broadwater of Blu-ray.com regarded it [...] "an effective thriller that plays with and against some of 's well-noted stylistic trademarks", (...) a well-constructed, lovers on the run-style heist flick".

500|$|Songs of Innocence {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has received an average score of 64 out of 100, based on 32 reviews. Rob Mitchum of Pitchfork criticised Songs of Innocence for [...] "aim for a one-size-fits-all, vaguely inspirational tone, with a lean approach to details despite the press kit assertion that it's all 'very, very personal'". Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune said U2 [...] "sounded as impersonal as ever" [...] {{and that the}} album was [...] "flat <b>and</b> <b>strangely</b> complacent", while finding the more personal songs derivative of contemporary rock bands such as Imagine Dragons and Airborne Toxic Event. In a review for The Guardian, Caspar Llewellyn Smith wrote that U2 was [...] "treading old ground without much {{of a sense of}} how to move forward." [...] Ben Patashnik of NME said only [...] "Iris", [...] "Song for Someone", and [...] "Every Breaking Wave" [...] were [...] "standouts", and he criticised the release strategy, judging [...] "the fact it's free makes it seem cheap." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine deemed the album a thematic success that was [...] "otherwise marred by the kind of slick MOR pablum that plagued the band's last few efforts". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic felt U2 did not challenge themselves sonically and that the album represents the contradictions in the band's music: [...] "They camouflage their nostalgia in the sound of modernity; they play gigantic music about intimacy... They want to be everything to everyone and, in attempting to do so, they've wound up with a record that appeals to a narrow audience".|$|E
500|$|The journal Man {{published}} a highly negative review by P. G. Rivière of the University of Oxford. Criticizing {{what he saw}} as the [...] "chatty 'Holier-than-Thou' tone" [...] of the book, Rivière asserted that at only 160 pages of text, Arens had failed to give sufficient attention to the subject and evidence, instead devoting much of the space to constructing and demolishing straw men arguments. Coming to the defence of those who believe the account of Staden regarding cannibalism among the Tupinambá by arguing that it could indeed reflect the German explorer's genuine experiences, Rivière notes that Arens has not tackled all of the claims which assert that this South American people committed anthropophagy. Furthermore, he expresses his opinion that Arens' work has made him reassess the evidence for Tupinambá cannibalism, the existence of which he is now even more thoroughly convinced. Proclaiming it to be both a [...] "bad" [...] and a [...] "dangerous" [...] book, he finally expresses his fear that it might prove to be [...] "the origin of a myth". Similarly, Shirley Lindenbaum of the New School for Social Research published her highly negative review of Arens' work in the journal Ethnohistory. Casting a critical eye on his claims, she notes that his use of source material was [...] "selective <b>and</b> <b>strangely</b> blinkered", which detracted from his ideas of [...] "collective prejudice" [...] which she considers valuable. Critiquing his discussion of the Fore people of New Guinea as being littered with inaccuracies, she draws comparisons between cannibalism and sexual activity, noting the latter is also not directly observed by anthropologists but nonetheless undoubtedly goes on. She furthermore expresses surprise that the work was ever designed for a scholarly audience because of its poor levels of accuracy.|$|E

500|$|The Binding of Isaac {{has been}} {{received}} by reviewers {{as a game}} with high replayability with the extensive range and combinations of power-ups that the player can encounter during a run-through, while providing an accessible Zelda-inspired framework that most video game players would recognize and easily come to understand. John Teti for Eurogamer praised the game for its replayability through the randomization aspects, calling it [...] "the most accessible exploration of the roguelike idea" [...] that he had seen. Edges similarly commented on the lure to replay the game due to its short playthrough time, calling it [...] "an imaginative and quick-witted arcade experience that manages to be both depraved <b>and</b> <b>strangely</b> sweet by turn". GameSpot's Maxwell McGee stated that the game smartly has removed extraneous features such that [...] "what remains is a tightly focused game that continues to feel fresh even after multiple completions". Though the game {{is considered to be}} accessible to new players, reviewers found the game to be a difficult challenge, often set by the randomness of what power-ups the player happened to acquire during a single run. Writers for The A.V. Club rated the game an A on a grading scale, and favorably compared the title to McMillen's Super Meat Boy, requiring the player to have [...] "masochistic patience in the face of terrible odds". This difficulty was considered mitigated by the large number of possible power-ups that the game offers, most would not be seen by players until they have replayed the game many times. McGee noted that while players can review what items they have discovered prior to a run-through, this feature does not explain what each item does, leaving the effect to be determined by the player while in game.|$|E
