40|$|The study {{assessed}} {{the ability of}} the central nervous system (CNS) to use echoic information from sensory substitution devices (SSDs) to rotate the shoulders and safely pass through apertures of different width. Ten visually normal participants performed this task with full vision, or blindfolded using an SSD to obtain information regarding the width of an aperture created by two parallel panels. Two SSDs were tested. Participants passed through apertures of + 0 %, + 18 %, + 35 %, and + 70 % of measured body width. Kinematic indices recorded movement time, shoulder rotation, average walking velocity across the trial, peak walking velocities before crossing, after crossing and throughout a whole trial. Analyses showed participants used SSD information to regulate shoulder rotation, with greater rotation associated with narrower apertures. Rotations made using an SSD were greater compared to vision, movement times were longer, average walking velocity lower and peak velocities before crossing, after crossing and throughout the whole trial were smaller, suggesting greater caution. Collisions sometimes occurred using an SSD but not using vision, indicating that substituted information did not always result in accurate shoulder rotation judgements. No {{differences were found between the}} two SSDs. The data suggest that spatial information, provided by sensory substitution, allows the relative position of <b>aperture</b> <b>panels</b> to be internally represented, enabling the CNS to modify shoulder rotation according to aperture width. Increased buffer space indicated by greater rotations (up to approximately 35 % for apertures of + 18 % of body width), suggests that spatial representations are not as accurate as offered by full vision...|$|R

The proposed method is applicable to scenarios where microphones positions do not comply with conventional microphone arrays such as a Uniform Linear Array (ULA) and large <b>aperture</b> microphone <b>panels.</b> The proposed method utilizes the amplitude attenuation of the Room Impulse Responses (RIRs) and Time Difference Of Arrivals (TDOA) cues to fit two surfaces {{across the room and}} estimate the location of the source. The areas with the least TDOA and the highest direct path impulse amplitude are highlighted as the source areas. Also proposed is an approach to forming subsets of microphones that are chosen such that they can localise the source with the highest accuracy when compared to using all microphones in the room. The approach is investigated for a various numbers of source positions and including additive noise. Results show that the localisation accuracy is increased by utilizing the formed subset of microphones...|$|R
40|$|Large {{deployable}} space {{structures are}} an integral part of reflectors, earth observation satellite antennas and radars, observation and radar targets, radiators, sun shields, solar sails and solar arrays. Launch vehicle faring sizes have not increased in the last three decades, meaning ever more efficient ways of packaging large space structures must be sought. Deployable structures come with the promise and capability of reducing payload mass substantially and allowing for very compact storage of systems during the launch phase. Gossamer structures hold particular promise for systems involving large <b>apertures,</b> solar <b>panels,</b> thermal shields and solar/deorbiting sails. The Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of a great part of these technologies is still very low (in the order of 2 - 3). The objective of DEPLOYTECH is to develop three specific, useful, robust, and innovative large deployable space structures to a TRL of 6 - 8 in the next three years. These include: a 10 m 2 (3. 6 m diameter) sail structure that uses in atable technology for deployment and support; a 5 × 1 m roll-out exible solar array that utilizes bistable composite booms; and 14 m solar sail CFRP booms with a novel deployment mechanism for extension control. © 2013 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

40|$|While the structural-acoustic {{coupling}} between flexible {{structures and}} closed acoustic cavities {{has been extensively}} studied in the literature, the modeling of structures coupled through open cavities, especially connected in cascade, is still a challenging task {{for most of the}} existing methods. The possible presence of micro-perforated panels (MPPs) in such systems adds additional difficulties in terms of both modeling and physical understanding. In this study, a sub-structuring methodology based on the Patch Transfer Function (PTF) approach with a Compound Interface treatment technique, referred to as CI-PTF method, is proposed, for dealing with complex systems involving cascade open/closed acoustic cavities and MPPs. The co-existence of <b>apertures</b> and solid/flexible/micro-perforated <b>panels</b> over a mixed separation interface is characterized using a compound panel subsystem, which enhances the systematic coupling feature of the PTF framework. Using several typical configurations, the versatility and efficiency of the proposed method is illustrated. Numerical studies highlight the physical understanding on the behavior of MPP inside a complex vibroacoustic environment, thus providing guidance for the practical design of such systems.

40|$|In this paper, the {{analysis}} of a flat-plate radiative panels operation, using average hourly weather data, was conducted. Radiative panels, with high-emittance surface cover, were integrated in the space-ventilation system with air-cooling {{by means of a}} cold-water coil. The panels should prepare a sufficient quantity of cold water that is collected in a cold-water tank during the nighttime operation. The collected cold water is used for cooling of the air during daytime. A simulation model for the parametric analysis of the system in summer operating conditions and the influence of its components on the system 2 ̆ 7 s operation was developed. The model includes the control of the system 2 ̆ 7 s operation, which prevents water circulation in the periods without cooling contributions. The purpose of the research was to predict the system behaviour in the Irish and the continental Croatian climatic conditions, to enable sizing and design of the test rig that is to be built for experimental validation of the system. The results of simulation were obtained for the small cooling system with a total <b>panel</b> <b>aperture</b> area of 6 m 2 and a volume of tanks of 300 l. The results were presented in the charts, where the influence of the main parameters on the system 2 ̆ 7 s operation was illustrated. The results showed that the radiative cooling system is more efficient in maritime than in moderate continental climatic conditions during summer...|$|R
40|$|Complete depth {{information}} can be extracted from analyzing all angles of light rays emanated from a source. However, this angular information is lost in a typical 2 D imaging system. In order to record this information, a standard stereo imaging system uses two cameras to obtain information from two view angles. Sometimes, more cameras are used to obtain information from more angles. However, a 4 D light field imaging technique can achieve this multiple-camera effect through a single-lens camera. Two methods are available for this: one using a microlens array, and the other using a moving aperture. The moving-aperture method can obtain more complete stereo information. The existing literature suggests a modified liquid crystal panel [LC (liquid crystal) panel, similar to ones commonly used in the display industry] to achieve a moving <b>aperture.</b> However, LC <b>panels</b> cannot withstand harsh environments and are not qualified for spaceflight. In this regard, different hardware is proposed for the moving aperture. A digital micromirror device (DMD) will replace the liquid crystal. This will be qualified for harsh environments for the 4 D light field imaging. This will enable an imager to record near-complete stereo information. The approach to building a proof-ofconcept is using existing, or slightly modified, off-the-shelf components. An SLR (single-lens reflex) lens system, which typically has a large aperture for fast imaging, will be modified. The lens system will be arranged so that DMD can be integrated. The shape of aperture will be programmed for single-viewpoint imaging, multiple-viewpoint imaging, and coded aperture imaging. The novelty lies in using a DMD instead of a LC panel to move the apertures for 4 D light field imaging. The DMD uses reflecting mirrors, so any light transmission lost (which would be expected from the LC panel) will be minimal. Also, the MEMS-based DMD can withstand higher temperature and pressure fluctuation than a LC panel can. Robotics need near complete stereo images for their autonomous navigation, manipulation, and depth approximation. The imaging system can provide visual feedbac...|$|R
