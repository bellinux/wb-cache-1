5|$|On March6, meteorologists from University College London at TropicalStormRisk.com {{issued a}} {{forecast}} {{for the season}} for above average activity, since sea surface temperatures {{were expected to be}} slightly warmer than usual; the group used data by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), and compared the potential 28.6storms to the 30-year average of 26.3. The group raised the number of predicted storms in April to 29.6, and again in early May to 30.5. They ultimately overestimated the number of storms that would form. The Laboratory for Atmospheric Research at the City University of Hong Kong also issued a season forecast in April 2002, predicting 27storms with <b>a</b> <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> of 3, of which 11 would become typhoons, with <b>a</b> <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> of 2. The agency noted a stronger than normal subtropical ridge over the open Pacific Ocean, as well as ongoing El Niño conditions that favored development, but expected below-normal development in the South China Sea. These predictions proved to be largely accurate.|$|E
5|$|Taloustutkimus {{carried out}} monthly {{telephone}} polls on party popularity for the Finnish Broadcasting Company. Since April 2007, the monthly sample size has varied between 2,900–3,900 with <b>a</b> <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> of about ±1.8%.

5|$|Other fossils {{attest to}} the even earlier {{presence}} of H. erectus in Java. Sangiran 2 (named after its discovery site) may be as old as 1.66 Ma (million years). The controversial Mojokerto child, which Carl C. Swisher and Garniss Curtis once dated to 1.81 ± 0.04 Ma, has now been convincingly re-dated to a maximum age of 1.49 ± 0.13 Ma, that is, 1.49 million years with <b>a</b> <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> of plus or minus 130,000 years.|$|E

5|$|Various {{estimates}} {{place the}} tree's seeding sometime between 1354 and 1361 AD.

Griffin and Emmett Keadle, president of the Mingo County Fish and Game Protective Association in Williamson, used an increment borer to estimate the tree as having begun its growth around 1356, with <b>a</b> <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> within 25 or 30 years.

5|$|Now that orca {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} for several decades, the exact age of many younger whales is known. The age of older orcas, such as Granny, is estimated by their offspring; they give birth around age 15, and stop having offspring around 40; by adding the generations together, ages can be estimated. Granny was photographed in 1971 with a male orca, J1 Ruffles, who was believed at the time to be her son. Ruffles was estimated as at least 20 years old, and as scientists believed him to be Granny's last offspring, her own age was estimated at about 60. It was later discovered that Ruffles was not Granny's son, but her age estimate was never changed. Granny's age was originally estimated with <b>a</b> <b>margin</b> <b>of</b> <b>error</b> of 12 years, but was the subject of an academic dispute in 2016 due to her original age being based on evidence now known to be incorrect, as well as a large disparity between the life expectancy of orcas with estimated ages and orcas with known ages. Analysis of fatty acids from a recent biopsy of Granny indicated that Granny may have only been 65-80 years of age.|$|E
