5|$|A group {{consists}} {{of a set of}} elements and a single operation which combines a first and a second element and returns a third. The operation must satisfy certain constraints for it to determine a group: It must be closed (when applied to any pair of elements of the associated set, the generated element must <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> member of that set), it must be associative, there must be an identity element (an element which, when combined with another element using the operation, results in the original element, such as adding zero to a number or multiplying it by one), and for every element there must be an inverse element.|$|E

5|$|Depending {{upon the}} size and {{economic}} well-being of the farm, there might <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> feast hall (oppstue), a house for the retired farmers (føderådstue), farm hands' dormitory (drengstue), carriage house (vognskjul), and even distillery (brenneskur). Smaller, poorer farms might combine barns and dwelling houses, have simpler storage areas, and use the facilities of other farms for activities {{they could not afford}} to build houses for.|$|E
5|$|Enforcers {{sometimes}} start {{fights to}} build game momentum {{and provide a}} psychological advantage over the opposing team. These fights usually involve two enforcers, but may involve any player who is agitating the opposition. This type of fight raises morale on the team of the player who wins, and often excites the home crowd. For that reason, it can <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> gamble to start a fight for momentum; if an enforcer loses the fight, the momentum can swing the wrong way.|$|E
5|$|Flight {{of ideas}} {{is typical of}} mania. Conversely, {{patients}} with depression may have retarded or inhibited thinking.

5|$|Geospace is {{populated}} by electrically charged particles {{at very low}} densities, the motions of which are controlled by the Earth's magnetic field. These plasmas form a medium from which storm-like disturbances powered by the solar wind can drive electrical currents into the Earth's upper atmosphere. During geomagnetic storms two regions of geospace, the radiation belts and the ionosphere, can become strongly disturbed. These storms increase fluxes of energetic electrons that can permanently damage satellite electronics, disrupting telecommunications and GPS technologies, and can <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> hazard to astronauts, even in low Earth orbit. They also create aurorae seen at high latitudes in an oval surrounding the geomagnetic poles.|$|E
5|$|If a {{white dwarf}} is in a binary star system and is accreting matter from its companion, {{a variety of}} {{phenomena}} may occur, including novae and Type Ia supernovae. It may <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> super-soft x-ray source if {{it is able to}} take material from its companion fast enough to sustain fusion on its surface. A close binary system of two white dwarfs can radiate energy in the form of gravitational waves, causing their mutual orbit to steadily shrink until the stars merge.|$|E
5|$|In the report, Hamilton {{felt that}} the {{securities}} should be paid at full value to their legitimate owners, including those who took the financial risk of buying government bonds that most experts thought would never be redeemed. He argued that liberty and property security were inseparable {{and that the government}} should honor the contracts, as they formed the basis of public and private morality. To Hamilton, the proper handling of the government debt would also allow America to borrow at affordable interest rates and would <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> stimulant to the economy.|$|E

5|$|Mendelssohn was a {{fine and}} {{enthusiastic}} artist in pencil and watercolour, a skill which he used throughout his life for his own amusement {{and that of his}} friends.

5|$|One of the adaptations made to Palladianism in America {{was that}} the piano nobile now tended {{to be placed on}} the ground floor, rather than above a service floor, as was the {{tradition}} in Europe. This service floor, if it existed at all, was now a discreet semi-basement. This negated the need for an ornate external staircase leading to the main entrance as in the more original Palladian designs. This would <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> feature of the neoclassical style that followed Palladianism.|$|E

5|$|Possible ceratopsians {{from the}} Southern Hemisphere include the Australian Serendipaceratops, known from an ulna, and Notoceratops from Argentina is known {{from a single}} toothless jaw (which has been lost). Craspedodon from the Late Cretaceous (Santonian) of Belgium may <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> ceratopsian, {{specifically}} a neoceratopsian closer to ceratopsoidea than protoceratopsidae. Possible leptoceratopsid remains have also been described from the early Campanian of Sweden.|$|E

5|$|The {{closely related}} field of letter-preference {{research}} {{dates back to}} the 1950s. In 1985, Belgian psychologist Nuttin reported the surprising finding that people tend to disproportionately prefer, unknowingly, the letters of their own name. The name-letter effect has been replicated in dozens of follow-up studies in different languages, cultures and alphabets, no matter whether participants selected their preferred letter from a random pair, or picked the top six of all letters in the alphabet, or rated each individual letter. Nuttin predicted that because {{the driving force behind the}} name-letter effect is an unconscious preference for anything connected to the self, there should <b>also</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> birthday-number effect.|$|E
