25|$|The {{conventional}} treatment method is an intravenous injection with antimony compounds, such as pentostam. Unfortunately, these chemotherapeutics are so poisonous that about 15% {{of the patients}} die from the treaments. To compound the situation, drug resistance has evolved in the parasites against the traditional antimonials. According to rough estimates, about 40% of patients in India are already resistant to this therapy. Another <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>drug</b> amphotericin B is also commonly used. Liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) has been a drug of choice in India, but is practically useless in Africa because of low effectiveness in the African strain of the parasite. Further, amphotericin B has severe adverse effects. Its acute effects includes nausea, vomiting, rigors, fever, hypertension or hypotension, and hypoxia, and its chronic effect is nephrotoxicity. In 1999 an anticancer drug miltefosine was demonstrated to be highly effective (95% cure rate) among Indian patients. This {{was the first time}} an oral drug is effective for visceral leishmaniasis. Clinical trials showed that the new drug is relatively harmless. The most adverse effects were only vomiting and diarrhoea in 20–28% patients, which were rather mild. The drug has been officially approved in India. The recommended dosage is 100mg per day over a period of four weeks.|$|E

These drug interactions are a major concern in clinical practice as they may {{have an effect on}} efficacy and toxicity. This article provides an overview of all published pharmacokinetic studies on drug interactions of the commonly prescribed <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>drugs</b> oxazolidinones, rifamycines, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, and beta-lactams, focusing on systematic research. We describe drug-food and drug-drug interaction studies in humans, affecting <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>drugs</b> as well as concomitantly administered drugs. Since knowledge about mechanisms is of paramount importance for adequate management of drug interactions, the most plausible underlying mechanism of the drug interaction is provided when available. This overview can be used in daily practice to support the management of pharmacokinetic <b>drug</b> interactions of <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>drugs...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: Chemical {{analysis}} shows that honey bees (Apis mellifera) and hive products contain many pesticides derived from various sources. The most abundant pesticides are acaricides applied by beekeepers to control Varroa destructor. Beekeepers also apply <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>drugs</b> to control bacterial and microsporidial diseases. Fungicides may enter the hive {{when applied to}} nearby flowering crops. Acaricides, <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>drugs</b> and fungicides are not highly toxic to bees alone, but in combination there is potential for heightened toxicity due to interactive effects. Methodology/Principal Findings: Laboratory bioassays based on mortality rates in adult worker bees demonstrated interactive effects among acaricides, {{as well as between}} acaricides and <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>drugs</b> and between acaricides and fungicides.

40|$|The rise in {{incidence}} of antimicrobial resistance, consumer demands and improved understanding of antimicrobial action has encouraged international agencies {{to review the}} use of <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>drugs.</b> More detailed understanding of relationships between the pharmacokinetics (PK) of <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>drugs</b> in target animal species and their action on target pathogens [pharmacodynamics (PD) ] has led to greater sophistication in design of dosage schedules which improve the activity and reduce the selection pressure for resistance in antimicrobial therapy. This, in turn, may be informative in the pharmaceutical development of <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>drugs</b> and in their selection and clinical utility. PK/PD relationships between area under the concentration time curve from zero to 24 h (AUC(0 - 24)) and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), maximum plasma concentration and MIC and time during which plasma concentrations exceed the MIC have been particularly useful in optimizing efficacy and minimizing resistance. <b>Antimicrobial</b> <b>drugs</b> have been classified as concentration-dependent where increasing concentrations at the locus of infection improve bacterial kill, or time-dependent where exceeding the MIC for a prolonged percentage of the inter-dosing interval correlates with improved efficacy. For the latter group increasing the absolute concentration obtained above a threshold does not improve efficacy. The PK/PD relationship for each group of <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>drugs</b> is 'bug and drug' specific, although ratios of 125 for AUC(0 - 24) :MIC and 10 for C-max:MIC have been recommended to achieve high efficacy for concentration-dependent <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>drugs,</b> and exceeding MIC by 1 - 5 multiples for between 40 and 100 % of the inter-dosing interval is appropriate for most time-dependent agents. Fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides and metronidazole are concentration-dependent and beta-lactams. macrolides, lincosamides and glycopeptides are time-dependent. For drugs of other classes there is limited and conflicting information on their classification. Resistance selection may be reduced for concentration-dependent antimicrobials by achieving an AUC(0 - 24) :MIC ratio of greater than 100 or a C-max:MIC ratio of greater than 8. The relationships between time greater than MIC and resistance selection for time-dependent antimicrobials have not been well characterized...|$|R

Prompt identification of agents associated with emerging infectious diseases and documentation of resistance among these agents to available <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>drugs</b> depend on existing surveillance activities for emerging pathogens and antimicrobial resistance. Although the World Health Organization has undertaken initiatives (1) in these areas, surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in developing countries is lacking or has been generally ignored (2).
