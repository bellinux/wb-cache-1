5|$|Brooks & Dunn is an American {{country music}} duo {{consisting}} of Kix Brooks and Ronnie Dunn, both vocalists and songwriters. The duo {{was founded in}} 1990 through the suggestion of Tim DuBois. Before the foundation, both members were solo recording artists. Brooks wrote number one singles for John Conlee, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, and Highway 101; both he and Dunn also charted two solo singles <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>in</b> the 1980s, with Brooks also releasing an album for Capitol Records in 1989. However, they began hitting the charts together in 1991.|$|E
5|$|In the {{newspaper}} articles, Cope attacked Marsh for plagiarism and financial mismanagement, and attacked Powell for his geological classification errors and misspending of government-allocated funds. Marsh and Powell were each able to publish their own {{side of the}} story, filing their own charges against Cope. Ballou's articles were poorly researched, written, and read, and Cope himself was smarting from <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>in</b> The Philadelphia Inquirer which suggested the University of Pennsylvania trustees would ask Cope to step down unless he provided proof for his charges against Marsh and Powell. Marsh himself kept the Herald story alive with a fiery rebuttal, {{but by the end}} of January the story had faded from all {{the newspaper}}s, and little changed between the bitter rivals.|$|E
5|$|From there, Wheeler {{was invited}} to direct a Society of Antiquaries {{excavation}} at the Roman settlement of Verulamium, which existed on land recently acquired by the Corporation of St Albans. He took on this role for four seasons from 1930 to 1933, before leaving a fifth season of excavation {{under the control of}} the archaeologist Kathleen Kenyon and the architect A. W. G. Lowther. Wheeler enjoyed the opportunity to excavate at a civilian as opposed to military site, and also liked its proximity to his home in London. He was particularly interested in searching for a pre-Roman Iron Age oppidum at the site, noting that the existence of a nearby Catuvellauni settlement was attested to in both classical texts and numismatic evidence. With Wheeler focusing his attention on potential Iron Age evidence, Tessa concentrated on excavating the inside of the city walls; Wheeler had affairs with at least three assistants during the project. After Tessa wrote two interim reports, the final excavation report was finally published in 1936 as Verulamium: A Belgic and Two Roman Cities, jointly written by Wheeler and his wife. The report resulted in the first major published criticism of Wheeler, produced by the young archaeologist Nowell Myres in a review for Antiquity; although stating that there was much to praise about the work, he critiqued Wheeler's selective excavation, dubious dating, and guesswork. Wheeler responded with <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>in</b> which he defended his work and launched a personal attack on both Myres and Myres's employer, Christ Church, Oxford.|$|E

5|$|Congress {{began the}} task of {{restoring}} federal coins to circulation in 1864 with <b>a</b> two-cent <b>piece</b> <b>in</b> bronze, and by authorizing <b>a</b> three-cent <b>piece</b> <b>in</b> copper-nickel the following year. In 1866, it authorized <b>a</b> five-cent <b>piece</b> <b>in</b> the latter alloy, the nickel, as {{it has come to}} be known. With the three-cent silver effectively replaced by base-metal pieces, it did not share in the increased mintage of silver coins that began in 1868. The three-cent silver was struck at the rate of a few thousand per year into the 1870s.|$|R

25|$|Perhaps {{the best}} known of the alleged {{incidents}} involving Spring-heeled Jack were the attacks on two teenage girls, Lucy Scales and Jane Alsop. The Alsop report was widely covered by the newspapers, including <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>in</b> The Times, while fewer reports appeared in relation to the attack on Scales. The press coverage of these two attacks helped to raise the profile of Spring-heeled Jack.|$|E

25|$|The game {{begins with}} an empty board. The players {{determine}} who plays first, then take turns placing their men one per play on empty points. If a player is able to place three of his pieces on contiguous points in a straight line, vertically or horizontally, he has formed a mill and may remove one of his opponent's pieces from the board and the game, with the caveat that <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>in</b> an opponent's mill can only be removed if no other pieces are available. After all men have been placed, phase two begins.|$|E
25|$|Many pieces {{can move}} {{any number of}} free intersections along a {{straight}} line, limited by {{the edge of the}} board. If an opponent's piece intervenes, it may be captured by moving to that intersection, and removing it from the board. A range piece must stop where it captures, and cannot bypass <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>in</b> its way. If a friendly piece intervenes, the moving piece is limited to a distance that stops short of the intervening piece; if the friendly piece is adjacent, it cannot move in that direction at all.|$|E

25|$|Lawler {{has stated}} several {{theories}} {{as to why}} he was allowed to leave. His first involves the ascent of Carter's career alongside the downfall of Chyna's. In his contention, Chyna was jealous of his wife's push inside the company, in part due to the Right to Censor storyline, and in part because of his wife's offer to pose for Playboy magazine. Until that time, Chyna had been the second major wrestling star from the World Wrestling Federation to have done <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>in</b> Playboy (after Sable); during Chyna's debut on the adult magazine, she had suddenly broken her friendship with Carter.|$|E
25|$|This {{work has}} been avoided in some {{discourse}} on Beuys {{because he has been}} put in artistically sacrosanct position and this is not in conformance with Beuys' other work.

25|$|Glassblowing {{involves}} three furnaces. The first, {{which contains}} a crucible of molten glass, is simply {{referred to as}} the furnace. The second is called the glory hole, and is used to reheat <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>in</b> between steps of working with it. The final furnace is called the lehr or annealer, and is used to slowly cool the glass, over a period of a few hours to a few days, {{depending on the size of}} the pieces. This keeps the glass from cracking or shattering due to thermal stress. Historically, all three furnaces were contained in one structure, with a set of progressively cooler chambers for each of the three purposes.|$|E
