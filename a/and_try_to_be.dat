25|$|Truffaut {{would often}} stay with friends <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{out of the}} house as much as possible. His best friend {{throughout}} his youth and until his death was Robert Lachenay, who was the inspiration for the character René Bigey in The 400 Blows and would work as an assistant on some of Truffaut's films. It was the cinema that offered him the greatest escape from an unsatisfying home life. He was eight years old when he saw his first movie, Abel Gance's Paradis Perdu (Paradise Lost) from 1939. It was there that his obsession began. He frequently played truant from school and would sneak into theaters because he didn't have enough money for admission. After being expelled from several schools, at the age of fourteen he decided to become self-taught. Two of his academic goals were to watch three movies a day and read three books a week.|$|E
500|$|In March 2008, Hot Chip re-recorded several {{songs from}} Made in the Dark, {{with one of}} their [...] "all-time heroes", Robert Wyatt. Doyle said the band had wanted it to happen [...] "for ages" [...] and that people would {{see it as a}} {{surprise}} collaboration. Taylor said, [...] "I crave confusion and quite like people to be surprised. I try to do that in the words and music <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> what people don't think we are. Robert is someone we have liked for much longer than people realise. We feel closer to people in a different field, age or era." [...] The album features Emma Smith, who had previously joined with Hot Chip to play violin and saxophone on their first two albums.|$|E

2500|$|In 2006, Havins {{was asked}} if she felt that Babe had been {{redeemed}} since the baby switch. Havins replied, [...] "More or less. That's not {{something that can be}} done overnight; it takes time. And I don't think it's necessarily acts, like one heroic act, that redeem someone." [...] She clarified: It's just showing change. She's very remorseful and there's regret with the whole situation. It's one thing if somebody didn't feel sorry for what they did, but she repented for her sins. Everyone has a past. Everyone makes mistakes. The only {{thing you can do is}} move on <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a better person from that point forward. When Bianca forgives Babe in 2007 for keeping her child from her, there were viewers who still felt that it was due to Bianca being in love with Babe, and were upset that Bianca could not seem to resist any interaction with her. In a 2007 interview with TV Guide, Havins seemed perplexed that a significant number of viewers had still not forgiven Babe for the baby switch, and felt that the character had been redeeming herself.|$|E
2500|$|There was a brawl on pit road {{involving}} Jeff Gordon, Brad Keselowski and Kevin Harvick. Keselowski and Harvick {{were parked}} in the post-race impound area where the cars that finished second through sixth are held for post-race inspection. Gordon pulled his car and parked it right beside Brad's car. He got out and had a level-headed conversation with {{the driver of the}} No. 2 Ford that seemed to make him more angry. As Keselowski was putting on his Miller Lite cap, Kevin proceeded to shove him towards Gordon and all hell broke loose. Multiple pit crews from the three racing stables as well as Paul Menard's crew were involved (Keselowski's spot in the impound area was in the pit stall of the No. 27 car). ESPN's Jamie Little was {{caught in the middle of}} it. “We’re racing for the win,” said Keselowski of the on track contact. “ to wreck him, just racing hard. He left a hole and you know, everything you watch in racing, you leave a hole, you’re supposed to go for it. It closed back up and we made contact. I don’t want to ruin anyone’s day. I want to win the race and that was our opportunity. Just didn’t come together.” “I spun the tires a little bit but I got a pretty decent start and we went down into one and I just wanted to get to the outside of the 48 [...] and out of nowhere, I got slammed by the 2 and it cut my left rear tire. He's just a dipshit," [...] Gordon said in a nationally televised interview on ESPN. [...] "I don't know how he's ever won a championship. I'm just sick and tired of him. ... That was a huge race for us. I'm proud of Jimmie Johnson for winning that race. I didn't want that you-know-what (Keselowski) to win that race. ... (Keselowski) gets himself in this position himself and as far as I'm concerned he's got to pay the consequences. … It's total crap. The kid is just doing stuff way over his head." [...] “I'm not trying to sit here and sugarcoat it <b>and</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> The Intimidator,’’ Keselowski said. “That's not what I'm trying to say. My expectation is if there's a gap, they'll go for it. If there's a gap, I'll go for it. If it closes up, there's contact, then that's racing. And that's what happened today. Will those guys race me hard or harder than others? Absolutely, I'm certain they will. But that's just part of it. I can't fault them for that. I just feel like I have to go for the gap if it's there, and I have to race the way I race or I won't even be in NASCAR. I'd rather have enemies in NASCAR than have friends and be sitting at home.’’ “If you’re going to drive like that, you better be willing to fight,’’ Harvick said he told Keselowski. “He was going to stand behind his guys. Jeff Gordon deserved to at least have a face-to-face conversation with him. I wasn’t standing up for anybody. (Keselowski) just ran over (Gordon). He was standing back behind all his guys, not wanting to defend what he did. I said, ‘You’re the problem, get in your own fight.’ ‘’ Robin Pemberton, NASCAR's senior vice president of competition, said that series officials will review what took place to determine what, if any, penalties will be issued. “Holding onto each other and grabbing… that's one thing. When punches are landed, it's a different scenario," [...] Pemberton said.|$|E
