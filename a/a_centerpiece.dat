5|$|Frost Bank Tower is {{the third}} tallest {{building}} in Austin at , behind 360 Condominiums and The Austonian in height. The building covers most of its block, which is located {{near the center of}} downtown at 4th Street and Congress Avenue. Its location in the skyline, matched with its height, excited Austinites and was known as <b>a</b> <b>centerpiece</b> to the skyline.|$|E
5|$|Mount Thielsen, or Big Cowhorn (Klamath: hisc’akwaleeʔas), is an extinct {{shield volcano}} in the Oregon High Cascades, near Mount Bailey. Because eruptive {{activity}} ceased 250,000years ago, glaciers have heavily eroded the volcano's structure, creating precipitous slopes and a horn-like peak. The spire-like shape of Thielsen attracts lightning strikes and creates fulgurite, an unusual mineral. The prominent horn forms <b>a</b> <b>centerpiece</b> for the Mount Thielsen Wilderness, a reserve for recreational {{activities such as}} skiing and hiking.|$|E

5|$|The {{roadhouse}} {{is named}} after Rika Wallen, who acquired it from John Hajdukovich and operated it for many years. It became a hub of activity in that region of the interior. With {{the construction of the}} ALCAN (now Alaska) Highway and the replacement of the ferry with a bridge downstream, traffic moved away and patronage declined. The roadhouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976, and is now <b>a</b> <b>centerpiece</b> of Big Delta State Historical Park, also listed on the National Register.|$|E

Other 2009 festivals included the Human Rights Nights International Film Festival, the Seattle International Film Festival, and the Philadelphia Film Festival.|$|E
5|$|The Moro River {{runs from}} the central {{mountain}} spine of Italy to the Adriatic coast south of Ortona. The German defences on the Moro were <b>a</b> <b>centerpiece</b> of the Winter Line, which guarded {{the eastern side of}} the Apennines along Route 5. Montgomery hoped to punch through the Winter Line, capture Ortona and Pescara and advance to Rome. The British 78th Infantry Division, which had been spearheading V Corps since the Volturno Line actions and had sustained over 7,000 casualties in less than six months, was relieved by the fresh 1st Canadian Infantry Division (Major-General Christopher Vokes), ready to renew the offensive on 5 December 1943. The 78th Infantry Division was sent into the mountains on the relatively quiet left wing of the army, joining the British 5th Infantry Division (Major-General Gerard Bucknall) under XIII Corps.|$|E

50|$|Goddard and {{his team}} {{developed}} many concepts and ideas for the new city, including shopping districts, recreation zones, and ultimately <b>an</b> iconic <b>centerpiece,</b> the Ring of Life.|$|R
5|$|During {{the latter}} part of Diệm's rule, <b>a</b> <b>centerpiece</b> of the rural pacification {{campaign}} was the large-scale construction of strategic hamlets, whereby villagers were compelled to move into fortified camps in an attempt to lock out insurgents. However this failed as many were able to infiltrate the settlements, whereas a previous implementation of such principles in Malaya had been successful as the local communists were ethnic Chinese who were physically distinguishable from the anti-communist ethnic majority. It also angered the peasants, who were forced to abandon their ancestral lands and homes, and build new dwellings in the new villages. Many of these hamlets were subsequently overrun in communist attacks, something many villagers found to their liking. General Lê Văn Kim oversaw the future of the program for Minh and it was decided to liberalize the system to try to win over the peasants. They forecast that they could reduce the insurgency's support by 30% alone through these less restrictive arrangements, citing more cooperative attitudes in Mekong Delta regions heavily populated with Hòa Hảo and Cao Đài. However this upset and aroused suspicions among the Americans.|$|E
5|$|Since {{classical}} antiquity, {{the area}} around Kvarner Bay has been characterized as a meeting point of diverse cultures—from Hellenic and Roman cultures, through the Middle Ages and a succession of various rulers, to the present day. This blending {{is reflected in the}} folklore of the area, including Zvončari—bell-ringers best known for annual pageant in Kastav, listed on UNESCO's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Crossbowmen from Rab are a living history company reenacting an arbalest tournament first held in 1364 to commemorate the successful defence of the island using that weapon. A typical decorative motif used in the region is morčić (plural: morčići)—a dark skinned Moor used as <b>a</b> <b>centerpiece</b> on jewelry, usually earrings. Legend has it that the motif is related to a hypothesized battle between Croatian and Ottoman armies on Grobnik north of Rijeka, but {{it is more likely that}} it is of Venetian origin, as it is similar to the Venetian moretti motif, used mostly on brooches and pins.|$|E
25|$|A {{slightly}} modified 50th Anniversary Edition Corvette {{was chosen to}} pace the Indianapolis 500 race in May 2002; then the production vehicle became <b>a</b> <b>centerpiece</b> of the subsequent 50th Anniversary Celebration, sponsored by Chevrolet.

25|$|Controversy {{arose in}} 2013, when CFA (Championship Fighting Alliance) fighter Fallon Fox {{came out as}} a {{transgender}} woman. The case became <b>a</b> <b>centerpiece</b> of debates concerning whether it was fair to have a transsexual woman compete against one born of the female sex in a contact sport. Neither the UFC nor Invicta FC say they will allow her to fight, and then-UFC Bantamweight champion Ronda Rousey says she will not fight her.|$|E
25|$|Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR), {{launched}} on 11 February 2015, began orbiting L1 on 8 June 2015 {{to study the}} solar wind {{and its effects on}} Earth. DSCOVR is unofficially known as GORESAT, because it carries a camera always oriented to Earth and capturing full-frame photos of the planet similar to the Blue Marble. This concept was proposed by then-Vice President of the United States Al Gore in 1998 and was <b>a</b> <b>centerpiece</b> in his film An Inconvenient Truth.|$|E

25|$|The work of Douady and Hubbard {{coincided with}} a huge {{increase}} in interest in complex dynamics and abstract mathematics, {{and the study of}} the Mandelbrot set has been <b>a</b> <b>centerpiece</b> of this field ever since.

25|$|Wes had {{rejoined the}} band to both tour and {{play on the}} next album where the re-formed 4 piece band became <b>a</b> <b>centerpiece</b> for perhaps the most complex {{arrangements}} in the band's career. After the archetypal minimalism, both lyrically and musically of Komander, the new album, which would again carry the Plasmatics name, was again filled with complexity {{and returned to the}} social and political themes previously found most strongly in Coup but in 1984 before it: environmental decay and a world where excess and abuse led directly to a doomsday scenario.|$|E
25|$|On March 1, 1987, Channel 2 was relaunched {{with the}} live musical special, The Star Network: Ang Pagbabalík Ng Bituin (The Return of the Star) which noted for the then-brand-new {{numerical}} white tri-ribbon channel 2 logo {{with a white}} rhombidal star (from 1988 to 1993 the ribbons were tri-coloured in red, green and blue) as <b>a</b> <b>centerpiece</b> of the network's revival.

25|$|Inspired by neoclassical tastes, the short-waisted dresses sported soft, loose {{skirts and}} were often made of white, almost {{transparent}} muslin, which was easily washed and draped loosely like the garments on Greek and Roman statues. Since the fabric {{clung to the}} body, revealing what was underneath, it made nudity à la grecque <b>a</b> <b>centerpiece</b> of public spectacle. Thus during the 1795–1820 period, it was often possible for middle- and upper-class women to wear clothes that were not very confining or cumbersome, and still be considered decently and fashionably dressed.|$|E
25|$|The Hoogland Center for the Arts in {{downtown}} Springfield is <b>a</b> <b>centerpiece</b> for performing arts, and houses among other organizations the Springfield Theatre Centre, the Springfield Ballet Company, the Illinois Symphony Orchestra and the Springfield Municipal Opera, {{also known as}} The Muni, which stages community theatre productions of Broadway musicals outdoors each summer. Before being purchased and renamed, the Hoogland Center was Springfield's Masonic Temple. Prior to the Hoogland, the Springfield Theatre Centre was housed in the nearby Legacy Theatre. Sangamon Auditorium, located {{on the campus of}} the University of Illinois at Springfield also serves as a larger venue for musical and performing acts, both touring and local.|$|E
25|$|The Frick Auditorium is {{a lecture}} hall in room 324 of the Cathedral of Learning.
