5000|$|The LEM-3 was {{designed}} by Yuri Vladimirovich Domrachayev & Leonid Sergeyevich Vild'grub as a very high efficiency transport akin to a motor-glider, with high aspect ratio wings and a low-powered engine. The all wood LEM-3 had a conventional tricycle undercarriage, long span wings were supported by a truss running from approx 1/3 span {{to the bottom of}} the u/c legs to the other wing. The initial version had a side-by-side open cockpit, for the two pilots, and an eight-seat cabin with four bench sets under hinged roof access panels with small windows as well as four cargo compartments in the enlarged wing roots. The engine drove a U-2 Propeller, with which the flight tests began in 1936. The factory testing was completed by early [...] when the aircraft was flown to Moscow for testing at the NII GVF(Naoochno-Issledovatel'skiy Institoot Grazdahnskovo Vozdooshnovo Flota - scientific test institute for civil air fleet), unfortunately the aircraft suffered a forced landing on arrival at the NII GVF airfield and further work was abandoned. A modifiied version with a large enclosed cabin, trousered main undercarriage, <b>anti</b> nose-over <b>skid</b> and Townend ring cowling, was mooted in a contemporary drawing, but there is no evidence that this version was built, modified, or flown.|$|R

The crossroads was once a major accident black spot [...] but numbers were reduced when a 40 mph speed limit and an <b>anti</b> <b>skid</b> road surface were added. The building of a by-pass diverting the A477 to the North and through the West of the Village by use of an underpass, previously earmarked over many years, started in 2012 [...] and was opened on 16 April 2014.|$|E
40|$|Skid {{resistance}} is the force developed when a tyre is prevented from rotating along the pavement surface. Skid {{resistance is}} {{thought of as}} a pavement property, it is the antonym of slipperiness. Among other road surface conditions, slippery pavement during precipitation is of great concern to road safety authorities. Some statistics indicate that the number of accidents increases by up to two folds during rainy conditions. Loss of skid resistance affects driver's ability to control vehicle. In addition to increasing the stopping distance while braking, lower skid resistance reduces steering controllability since both braking and steering depend on tire-pavement friction. In this paper mainly the methods of proper laying of pavements, various materials used to improver skid resistance, measurement of <b>anti</b> <b>skid</b> values such a...|$|E
40|$|The {{progressive}} {{increase of}} tire-size has concurred to a sensitive {{improvement of the}} adherence with consequent increase of car safety. However, the wide tires have problems to expel the water in excess in heavy rain condition. For this reason {{the phenomenon of the}} aquaplaning is increasingly felt and is the cause of several automotive accidents. It is not a case that nearly all tire manufacturers supply "rain" tires and adherence in wet conditions is highly advertised. A typical accident happens when aquaplaning occurs in motorway at high speed. One or more tires lose adherence and the car begins to spin. If the pilot is not able to regain the initial direction, the car may hit the guardrail or another car. In this case the modern control systems like the ESP (Electronic Stability Program) and the ASR (<b>Anti</b> <b>Skid</b> Regelung) do not have time or are not able to manage a pre-spin or spin situation at elevated slip-angles. In this paper, a fuzzy control system able to deal with these conditions is introduced. The car has been simulated with a 9 DOF lumped-mass model that {{does not take into account}} suspensions and it considers a rigid car on smooth asphalt. The model of adhesion of the tire, instead, takes into account the effect of transverse forces on the longitudinal adherence. An expert pilot controls a high-speed spin with difficulty also. In this paper, a fuzzy control system that is able to control the brake torque on each single tire has been considered. The fuzzy control system works quite well and the car does not even enter in a true spin if enough adherence is present or if the slippery zone on asphalt is limited...|$|E
