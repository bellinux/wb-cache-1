The mosquitos {{used in this}} study had been maintained in the laboratory for 160 generations after being collected in Kanagawa prefecture. For control mosquitos, ten seminal vesicles were removed from male adults 3 days after emergence, and sectioned at the middle. The numbers of all normal and <b>abnormal</b> <b>spermatozoa</b> in one side of the double-lumen of a cross-section were counted except for head nucleus parts, tail ends, and tangential sections which could not be identified as normal or abnormal.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{purpose of}} the present study was twofold: 1) to {{determine}} if antibodies raised against ubiquitin would recognize antigens associated with the porcine cytoplasmic droplet (CD), and 2) to determine if the same antibody would identify ubiquitinated substrates on the surface of morphologically <b>abnormal</b> boar <b>spermatozoa.</b> Permeabilization with the detergent Triton X- 100 (0. 05 %) showed virtually all CDs to be ubiquitin positive. Distal droplets (DDs) retained in situ on boar spermatozoa were readily labeled following Triton permeabilization, whereas DDs present on nonpermeabilized cells were not. Negative control preparations lacked the ubiquitin staining on the DD. The use of microtubes for fixation and incubation provided clearer images as well as better sperm cell distribution and density than an initial slide-mounted technique. Immunoblotting indicated that larger amounts of ubiquitinated proteins were present in extracts from sperm cells from an ejaculate with an abnormally high percentage of retained DDs (52 % DDs) compared to a morphologically normal sample (6 % DDs). The primary antibody recognized both mono-ubiquitin of bovine origin (8. 5 kd) and human ubiquitin conjugate (35 kd), as demonstrated by Western blot. Preabsorption of the anti-ubiquitin antibody with purified bovine ubiquitin was successful in preventing diaminobenzidine staining of sperm extract from the high DD ejaculate. The presence of antigens recognized by anti-ubiquitin antibodies in the boar sperm CD, coupled with the possibility that superfluous ubiquitin species are detrimental to embryonic development by targeting critical paternally contributed zygotic organelles, raises concerns that retained DDs may be more detrimental to fertility than previously suspected...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{systematic}} description of normal and <b>abnormal</b> dog <b>spermatozoa</b> {{by means of}} bright field light and transmission electron microscopy, and {{an investigation into the}} effect that abnormal sperm have on canine fertility. A total of 101 ejaculates were collected from 88 dogs, of 34 different breeds. Sperm samples were examined macroscopically for volume, colour, consistency, and pH. Microscopic evaluation of sperm motility was conducted on all samples. Morphological evaluation using light microscopy was conducted on 71 of the samples. Samples from 10 of the dogs were examined ultrastructurally. A novel classification for abnormal dog sperm is presented. Abnormal sperm were classified into one of the following groups: Acrosomal defects, head defects, midpiece defects, tail defects and other abnormalities. Abnormalities were further sub-divided into major and minor defects. The most common abnormalities encountered were major sperm head defects. The abnormalities are compared with those described for other species, in particular the bull and man. The association between the percentage abnormal sperm in the ejaculate and the fertility of the dog was statistically evaluated. On this basis, the dogs were divided into normal and sub-normal groups. The percentage normal morphology below which fertility was adversely affected was found to be sixty percent. The fertility of dogs with {{greater than or equal to}} 60 percent normal morphology was 61 percent, while the fertility of dogs with · less than 60 percent normal morphology was 13 percent.

However, after 28 weeks of age, weight differences decreased and by 56 weeks of age body weights of both groups were approximately the same. In addition, a significant reduction in feed consumption was noted for the males fed 12 % protein. Males on the high protein diet experienced a higher mortality than those on the low protein diet. Low dietary protein reduced semen volume and spermatozoa concentration at 33 weeks of age, but {{there were no significant differences}} thereafter.

40|$|The {{selection}} of morphologically normal spermatozoa {{is critical to}} obtain high breeding performances in boar breeding farms and artificial insemination (AI) centers. Parameters for the {{selection of}} semen mainly include total sperm motility, concentration, and morphology. However, these primary parameters are often not reliable for discriminating between normal and <b>abnormal,</b> non-fertilizable <b>spermatozoa.</b> The present {{study was designed to}} compare the motion characteristics, fertilization ability using in vitro fertilization (IVF), and acrosome formation of the semen from boars having low (boar number 2012) and normal (boar number 2004 and 2023) breeding performances. The ultimate goal was to identify additional simple and easy criteria for the selection of normal sperm. There {{was no significant difference between}} boar 2004 and boar 2023 sperm total motility in computer assisted sperm analysis. However, boar number 2012 semen presented a significantly reduced population of rapid moving spermatozoa and an increased population of slow moving spermatozoa compared to boar numbers 2004 and 2023. Analysis of detailed motion characteristics revealed that sperm from boar number 2012 had significantly reduced motility in progressiveness, average path velocity, straight-line velocity (VSL), curvilinear velocity (VCL), straightness, and linearity. The assessment of the fertilizing ability by IVF also showed that sperm from boar number 2012 showed a fertility rate of 3. 4 %, whereas sperm from boar number 2023 had a fertility rate of 75. 45 %. Interestingly, most of the sperm nuclei were found on the peripheral area of the oocytes, suggesting that the sperm from boar number 2012 lacked penetration ability into the oocyte zonapellucida. The acrosome formation analysis using Pisum sativum agglutinin staining demonstrated that the sperm from boar number 2012 had a defect in acrosome formation. Consequently, primary parameters for selecting semen before AI such as motility are not sufficient to select normal and fertilizable spermatozoa. In conclusion, the present study suggests that the acrosome staining and detailed motion characteristics such as progressiveness, VCL, and VSL should be included in determining semen quality together with primary parameters for successful AI and high breeding performance in the swine industry...|$|R
40|$|Speciation, the {{formation}} of new species, is an essential evolutionary process that causes species diversity on the Earth. At {{the beginning of this}} process is the separation of two populations by a reproductive barrier that prevents gene flow between these populations. One of the mechanisms, which enable reproductive isolation, is hybrid sterility (HS). It is a mechanism of postzygotic isolation that is described in a number of eukaryotes. The first discovered gene of hybrid sterility in vertebrates is the mice gene Hst 1, later identified as gene Prdm 9. By genetic and molecular analysis the locus on the X chromosome was determined, whose interaction with Prdm 9 causes sterility or reduced fitness in male hybrids. This locus contains two genetic factors: Hstx 1, causing an <b>abnormal</b> morphology of <b>spermatozoa,</b> and Hstx 2, causing an arrest in spermatogenesis in pachytene spermatocytes and sterility.

DESIGN: We investigated sixty infertile men and thirty normal healthy fertile controls. Of sixty infertile men, 39 were asthenozoospermia and 21 were OAT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Percoll gradients discontinuous technique was used for separation of spermatozoa {{on the basis of}} their motility. Long-range PCR was used for detection of “common ” 4977 -bp deletions, and primer shift technique was used for confirmation of deletions. RESULTS: Overall fourteen subjects (14 / 60; 23. 3 %) of which eight (8 / 39; 20. 5 %) asthenozoospermia and six (6 / 21; 28. 6 %) OAT had shown deletions of 4977 -bp.

Weight of the litter born to mice mated with CYP treated (all three doses) males either in D 1 or D 2 was significantly lower than controls whereas gestation period and litter size did not significantly vary from controls. This is the first report revealing that CYP as low as 1. 38 mg/kg BW adversely affects spermatogenesis and that the effect is reversible up to 2. 76 mg/kg BW/kg BW exposure for 3 months.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the efficiency of oats oil to alleviate oxidative damage of testis induced by deltamethrin, which is a pyrethroid pesticide that exerts a wide range of effects on non-targeted organisms. The reprotoxicity caused by orally administered deltamethrin (DEL) to mice can be effectively antagonized by the beneficial effects of oats oil (OO) as an antioxidant. Thirty-two male albino mice were divided into four equal groups: a control group, a group of mice given deltamethrin (5 mg per kg b. w.), a group administered deltamethrin after receiving oats oil (6 g per kg b. w.), and a group receiving only OO. Exposure to deltamethrin at a dose of 5 mg per kg b. w. per day caused oxidative stress in testis, proven by a decrease in the epididymal sperm count and motility, an increase in the number of <b>abnormal</b> morphologies in <b>spermatozoa</b> and a significant increase of lipid peroxidation (LP) in the testis when compared to control animals.

The study aimed to evaluate the possible relation between the percentage of spermatozoa with normal morphology and the following sperm functional assays: (i) zona-induced acrosome reaction (ZIAR); (ii) DNA integrity; (iii) chromatin condensation; (iv) sperm apoptosis; and (v) fertilisation rates. Regression analysis was employed to calculate the association between morphology and different functional tests. Normal sperm morphology correlated significantly with the percentages of live acrosome-reacted spermatozoa in the ZIAR (r= 0. 518; P< 0. 0001; n= 92), DNA integrity (r=- 0. 515; P= 0. 0018; n= 34), CMA 3 -positive spermatozoa (r=- 0. 745; P< 0. 0001; n= 92), sperm apoptosis (r=- 0. 395; P= 0. 0206; n= 34) and necrosis (r=- 0. 545; P= 0. 0009; n= 34). Negative correlations existed between for the acrosome reaction, and DNA integrity, while negative associations were recorded with the percentages of CMA 3 -positive spermatozoa, apoptotic and necrotic spermatozoa. Sperm morphology is related to sperm dysfunction such as poor chromatin condensation, acrosome reaction and DNA integrity. Negative and significant correlations existed between normal sperm morphology and chromatin condensation, the percentage of <b>spermatozoa</b> with <b>abnormal</b> DNA and <b>spermatozoa</b> with apoptotic activity.

These parameters were once again evaluated after 1 month and then again after 6 months. RESULTS: Sperm count {{was found to be}} lower immediately after returning to sea level (P = 0. 0004) and again after a month (P = 0. 0008). Normal levels were reached after 6 months. Spermatic motility (%) shows no reduction immediately after returning to sea level (P = 0. 0583), whereas after 1 month this reduction was significant (P = 0. 0066). After 6 months there was a recovery to pre-hypoxic exposure values. <b>Abnormal</b> or immature <b>spermatozoa</b> (%) increased immediately after returning to sea level (P = 0. 0067) and then again after 1 month (P = 0. 0004). After 6 months there was a complete recovery to initial values. The total number of motile sperm in the ejaculate was found to be lower immediately after returning to sea level (P = 0. 0024) and then again after 1 month (P = 0. 0021). After 6 months there was a recovery to pre-hypoxic exposure values. CONCLUSION: Chronic hypoxia induces a state of oligospermia and the normalization of such seminological parameters at the restoration of previous normoxic conditions after 6 months indicate the influence of oxygen supply in physiological mechanisms of spermatogenesis and male fertility...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Semen is {{the major}} vehicle for HIFV- 1 {{infection}} as it contains free and cell-associated virions and infected cells. However, the presence of HIV- 1 in spermatozoa has {{been a matter of}} debate, since the sperm cell fraction may contain somatic infected cells that jeopardize the attribution of the detected virus to the spermatozoa. METHODS: Spermatozoa from 12 HIV- 1 seropositive subjects were purified by multilayered Percoll gradient followed by osmotic shock. Residual presence of non-seminal cells (NCS) in purified spermatozoa, was then evaluated by cytometric and molecular analysis. HIV- 1 DNA was revealed by nested PCR and in situ PCR after sperm chromatin decondensation. DNA-fragmented ejaculated spermatozoa in semen of infected subjects were detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUDP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) analysis. RESULTS: Purification procedure adopted allowed complete removal of NCS. On purified sperm cells, HIV- 1 DNA was detected in 5 out of 12 subjects by nested-PCR. On crude semen of 10 out of 12 subjects, HIV- 1 DNA was in situ detected in a small percentage of <b>abnormal</b> <b>spermatozoa</b> {{with a wide range of}} structural alterations. TUNEL analysis revealed an increased percentage of DNA-fragmented ejaculated spermatozoa in semen of infected subjects. CONCLUSIONS: We report molecular evidence demonstrating that HIV- 1 infected subjects can ejaculate small amounts of HIV- 1 DNA-positive <b>abnormal</b> <b>spermatozoa.</b> Their possible role in HIV- 1 sexual transmission remains to be clarified...|$|E
40|$|Part I. 1. The sperm {{picture of}} rams of {{different}} breeds has been studied. 2. Semen was collected by Gunn’s electrical method. 3. The Ronderib Afrikaners were {{superior to the}} Merinos in semen characteristics. This {{may have been due}} to the fact that the former were younger rams. 4. There were too few rams of the other breeds represented to enable an opinion with regard to breed differences to be expressed. 5. A morphological study of spermatozoa was of great value and could be correlated with a ram’s fertility. It should, however, be considered together with the other semen characteristics. 6. When all the semen characteristics are considered together, a very accurate prognosis of a ram's breeding potentialities is possible. 7. The total number of <b>abnormal</b> <b>spermatozoa</b> in an ejaculum was not as good an indicator of spermatogenic activity as the type of abnormal cell. 8. Rams with poor fertility ejaculated more different types of <b>abnormal</b> <b>spermatozoa</b> than normal rams. 9. Variations in semen characteristics of different ejacula of the ram have been noted. 10. Semen of the less fertile rams showed greater variations than that of highly fertile rams. 11. Examination of two or three ejacula from an individual ram at weekly or fortnightly intervals is necessary in order to predict his breeding potentialities. A single examination may lead to erroneous conclusions. 12. The types of <b>abnormal</b> <b>spermatozoa</b> most consistently found in lesser or greater numbers in semen of all classes were tailless spermatozoa, coiled tails, and spermatozoa with defective stained anterior head caps. 13. Pyriform heads, narrow heads, enlarged middle pieces, filiform middle pieces, middle piece heads and variation in spermatozoon head sizes were relatively rare in good semen, but contributed appreciably towards a poor sperm picture. 14. Spermatozoa with coiled tails, in which the coiling involved mainly the ends of the tails, have been observed in semen in large numbers, without a corresponding reduction in fertilising capability of the semen. 15. High quality semen had good initial motility, good sperm concentration and few <b>abnormal</b> <b>spermatozoa.</b> 16. Poor quality semen may have a large volume and a high sperm concentration. 17. Seven of sixteen rams gave higher numbers of <b>abnormal</b> <b>spermatozoa</b> in summer than during any other season; in the remainder the abnormality counts were highest in winter. 18. Sperm concentration and total numbers were highest in winter and lowest in late summer. 19. Semen volume could not be definitely correlated with seasonal changes. 20. Initial motility was not affected by seasonal changes. 21. In general rams with had sperm pictures and poor fertility were more readily affected by climatic conditions than normal rams. Part II. 1. Spermatozoon vitality is rapidly reduced in the vagina of the ewe. A few spermatozoa still showed weak motility in the vagina 20 hours after copulation. 2. The cervical canal is the most favourable site for sperm preservation. 40 per cent. of spermatozoa in the cervix were motile 20 hours after copulation. 3. Spermatozoa progress from the cervical canal continuously and in small numbers. 4. Spermatozoa were found in the uppermost section of both fallopian tubes 6 minutes after ejaculation. They had travelled a distance of 45 cm. at the rate of 7. 5 cm. per minute. 5. The progress of spermatozoa along the genital tract was independent of ovarian activity and the time ewes were in oestrus. 6. Degenerative changes in spermatozoa were observed in the vagina of the ewe 2 hours after copulation, and in the cervical canal after 5 hours.

40|$|Aim: The present {{experiments}} were conducted (a) {{to evaluate the}} semen attributes of older Rhode Island Red (RIR) roosters and the inter-trait relationships, (b) to test sperm washing and storage duration suitable for gene transfer experiments. Materials and Methods: The semen characteristics of older RIR roosters were studied, and Pearson correlation analysis was done to demonstrate the inter-trait relationships. Progressive motility and percent live sperms were tested at different post-washing intervals to identify suitable sperm processing conditions for gene transfer experiments. Results: The volume, appearance score, initial motility, sperm count and percent live and <b>abnormal</b> <b>spermatozoa</b> were 0. 38 ml, 3. 58, 80. 34...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Our {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} effect of PTSD on changing the quality of sperm in veterans with PTSD, and the per-centage of successful procedures intrauterine insemination (IUI) as a first-line treatment of male infertility patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Patients and methods: The study is designed as a prospective observational study. The study was started from February 2013 until May of 2014. Our study included a total of 51 patients who were treatment for infertility in private Hospital for gy-necology, endocrinology and infertility, IVF Center in Peja, and those who were outpatients treated for chronic PTSD in the Polyclinic,, Biolab-Zafi,, in Klina the Republic of Kosovo. All subjects divide into two groups; The first, consisting of 21 respondents to the participants of the war in Kosovo, which was established diagnosis of PTSD. The second group of 30 who have not lived in Kosovo for the time War, and without signs of PTSD. Results: Subjects with PTSD were somewhat older than the control group (p = 0. 235) {{but it was not a}} signif-icant difference (44. 5 ± 5. 6 vs 43. 8 ± 2. 3). When the question of type of infertility, secondary infertility is significantly higher in patients with PTSD (62 % vs 20 %) (Table 2). The total number of sperm and semen volume no significant differences between the two groups (p> 0. 05). Sperm motility showed a significant reduction in cases of PTSD (p < 0. 0001), from observation semen parameters were found more <b>abnormal</b> forms of <b>spermatozoa</b> in the ejaculate cases with PTSD (p < 0. 0001) (Table 2). The percentage of pregnancies IUI procedure was slightly higher in patients with PTSD than the control group without PTSD (19 % vs. 16. 6 %). Conclusion: A combination of analytica...|$|R
40|$|The {{ultrastructure}} {{of cells}} of the seminiferous epithelium is described in both triploid ZZZ and ZZW fowls, especially cytological aberrations influencing the development of morphologically <b>abnormal</b> spermatids and <b>spermatozoa.</b> Mitotic divisions in triploid fowls {{are similar to those}} in diploid fowls, but meiosis in both the ZZZ and ZZW triploid fowl is abnormal and many defective gametes are produced. The majority of spermatids have structural abnormalities and this is attributed to the aneuploidy expected from meiotic chromosome pairing in a triploid. Some spermatids were observed to possess an irregularly shaped head, 2 centriolar complexes, 2 acrosomes and 2 tails and this type differentiated into large-headed spermatoza. Such spermatids and spermatozoa are suggested to be near diploid due to their large nuclear size and 2 sets of organelles. Other spermatids, observed with only 1 centriolar complex, 1 acrosome and 1 tail, are suggested to be near haploid. Differentiation of these spermatids is similar to the process observed in diploid fowls except that there is a high percentage of abnormally shaped heads. The fact that morphologically normal spermatozoa were rare is consistent with the expectation that very few spermatozoa would be exactly haploid. In both ZZZ and ZZW triploid fowls, triple pairing of chromosomes is observed in synaptonemal complexes (SC) during meiosis and recombination nodules are distributed at random in the central regions of the triple pairing SC. In ZZW triploid fowls gamete formation is more severely affected than in ZZZ triploid fowls and it is suggested that many of the degenerative changes occurring in ZZW fowls could be attributed to those spermatids that possess a W sex chromosome, since normal male fowls are the homogametic sex (ZZ) and normal spermatids and spermatozoa contain only a Z sex chromosome...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the case of}} a 2 -year-old English Bulldog with severe teratozoospermia that consisted mainly of "Dag-like" defects, which is strong coiling of the tail. Although libido, semen volume and sperm concentration were normal, sperm motility was 5. 0 %, and 93. 3 % of spermatozoa exhibited morphological abnormalities affecting the tail. Transmission electron microscopic examination of the spermatozoa revealed strong folding, coiling and fracture of sperm midpieces and tails, axonemal defects and the presence of swollen and unevenly distributed mitochondria. Taking into account the dog's history and examinations and the constantly high percentage of <b>abnormal</b> <b>spermatozoa</b> over time, the defect was considered to be genetic in origin...|$|E
