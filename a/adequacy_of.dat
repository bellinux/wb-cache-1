This, and the closure {{of a number of}} news bulletins by Southern Cross Broadcasting, prompted the Australian Broadcasting Authority to investigate the <b>adequacy</b> <b>of</b> regional news services The ABA later mandated that stations broadcast a minimum level of local content, based on a points systemtwo points per minute for local news, and one point per minute for other local content, excluding paid advertisements.|$|E
5|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the system was determined not by how long a sensor would last in the field, but by the <b>adequacy</b> <b>of</b> coverage by a particular string of sensors. For instance, a well placed string with several failed sensors was more effective than a fully functional string placed in the wrong location. The electronic data was, however, {{only as good as}} the human analysts and operators at the ISC. The knack of timely sensor activation depended on careful study of device locations and the patterns of PAVN logistical behavior.|$|E

5|$|In 1983, he {{was picked}} by New York Governor Mario Cuomo to chair a {{scientific}} fact-finding commission on the Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant, a job that required him {{to find common ground}} between the many viewpoints represented on the commission. The commission eventually recommended the closure of the plant, a course he personally disagreed with. Cuomo had formed the commission in mid-May 1983 to provide him with recommendations regarding the plant's safety, the <b>adequacy</b> <b>of</b> emergency plans, and the economics of operating the plant. The commission's consensus recommendations included unanimous findings that no emergency evacuation of the plant could be conducted without the cooperation of Suffolk County, which was refusing to approve an evacuation plan; that the construction of the plant would have been prevented if it had been started after new Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations were put into effect after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979; and that operating the plant would not reduce utility costs. Marburger himself at the time emphasized that the governor had not been seeking a consensus but rather encouraged multiple viewpoints to be reflected, and characterized the consensus conclusions as not the only important section of the report.|$|E

40|$|I {{argue that}} the {{accounts}} of inference recently presented (in this journal) by Paul Boghossian, John Broome, and Crispin Wright are unsatisfactory. I proceed in two steps: First, in Sects. 1 and 2, I argue {{that we should not}} accept what Boghossian calls the “Taking Condition on inference” as a condition <b>of</b> <b>adequacy</b> for accounts <b>of</b> inference. I present a different condition <b>of</b> <b>adequacy</b> and argue that it is superior to the one offered by Boghossian. More precisely, I point out that there is an analog of Moore’s Paradox for inference; and I suggest that explaining this phenomenon is a condition <b>of</b> <b>adequacy</b> for accounts <b>of</b> inference. Boghossian’s Taking Condition derives its plausibility {{from the fact that it}} apparently explains the analog of Moore’s Paradox. Second, in Sect. 3, I show that neither Boghossian’s, nor Broome’s, nor Wright’s account of inference meets my condition <b>of</b> <b>adequacy.</b> I distinguish two kinds of mistake one is likely to make if one does not focus on my condition of adequacy; and I argue that all three—Boghossian, Broome, and Wright—make at least one of these mistakes...|$|R

40|$|Nutrient intake {{can be used}} as an {{indicator}} of students health status. Imbalance <b>adequacy</b> level <b>of</b> nutrients can cause nutritional problems, both malnutrition and overnutrition. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the correlation between <b>adequacy</b> level <b>of</b> energy and macronutrients (protein, fat, and carbohydrate) with nutritional status of female students at Islamic Boarding School Al-Izzah high school in Batu City. This study was an observational with cross sectional study design. Fourty-fi ve female students were chosen as a sample of the study and it was obtained by simple random sampling. Data respondent characteristics, <b>adequacy</b> level <b>of</b> energy, and macronutrients (through plate waste and recall meassurement), and nutritional status were collected in this study. The data analysis used was Spearman rank. The result showed that most of the students had inadequate intake of energy and macronutrients, and their nutritional status were normal. There was a signifi cant correlation between the <b>adequacy</b> level <b>of</b> energy (p = 0. 049, r = 0. 296), protein (p = 0. 028, r = 0. 328), fat (p = 0. 049, r = 0. 296), and carbohydrate (p = 0. 02, r = 0. 345) with the nutritional status. The conclusion is respondent 2 ̆ 7 s nutritional status is determined by the <b>adequacy</b> level <b>of</b> energy andmacronutrients intake. This study advised respondents to increase to the portions of meals, such as rice, side dish, and vegetables to achieve an adequate level of energy and macronutrients...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to expand the {{definition}} <b>of</b> <b>adequacy</b> by adding soft skills as a measure of school productivity. The singular focus on academic standards inherent in education policy has prevented scholars from seeing the concept <b>of</b> <b>adequacy</b> through myriad perspectives and has contributed to a resegregation of schools. Education policy includes legal, historical, and political perspectives; research inquiries must accommodate these multiple foci. This study made use of multifocal analysis to investigate the development of the concept <b>of</b> <b>adequacy</b> in South Carolina. Conclusions suggest an expanded definition <b>of</b> <b>adequacy</b> has potential for addressing school financing policy, but also for making historical, political and legal contributions to educational and economic policies aimed at repurposing schools...|$|R
