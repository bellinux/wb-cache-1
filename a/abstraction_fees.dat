50|$|A water tariff (often called {{water rate}} in the United States and Canada) is a price {{assigned}} to water supplied by a public utility through a piped network to its customers. The term is also often applied to wastewater tariffs. Water and wastewater tariffs are not charged for water itself, but to recover the costs of water treatment, water storage, transporting it to customers, collecting and treating wastewater, as well as billing and collection. Prices paid for water itself are different from water tariffs. They exist in a few countries and are called water <b>abstraction</b> charges or <b>fees.</b> <b>Abstraction</b> charges are not covered in this article, but in the article on water pricing). Water tariffs vary widely in their structure and level between countries, cities and sometimes between user categories (residential, commercial, industrial or public buildings). The mechanisms to adjust tariffs also vary widely.|$|R
25|$|All {{other fees}} and tariffs {{have to be}} {{approved}} by the National Water Agency as well as, in the case of <b>abstraction</b> and discharge <b>fees,</b> by the Ministry of Agriculture. The proceeds are to be used for environmental monitoring, prevention, control and remediation; water resources planning; and the operation and maintenance of infrastructure. The level of fees is to be differentiated {{depending on the type of}} use, taking into account social, economic and environmental factors. As of 2010, these new fees and tariffs were not yet being collected pending the setting of these fees through subsidiary legislation.|$|R

50|$|In most {{countries}} {{there is no}} charge for abstracting water directly from rivers, lakes and aquifers. However, some countries do levy volumetric charges or fees for water abstraction rights. These charges are typically levied on industries, utilities and farmers. Fees for water abstraction and discharge exist for example in France, where revenues are significant and are re-invested in the water sector by water agencies established in major basins. In Germany <b>abstraction</b> <b>fees</b> exist only for groundwater and only in some states, and their proceeds go into the general state budget. Mexico also charges for water abstraction and returns proceeds to utilities, but not to industries. Outside the OECD countries few countries charge water <b>abstraction</b> <b>fees.</b> Where they are applied the level of fees tends to be nominal, such as in Morocco, or enforcement is partial, such as for groundwater <b>abstraction</b> <b>fees</b> in Jordan. In almost all countries that have introduced <b>abstraction</b> <b>fees</b> agriculture, the major water user worldwide, is exempted from <b>abstraction</b> <b>fees.</b> Some countries allow water rights to be traded, so that the price for water itself is formed in the market. Such water trading exist in parts of Australia, Chile and the Southwestern United States).|$|E

40|$|International audienceWith an {{historical}} {{overview of the}} legislative and regulatory framework of water pricing in France, this chapter first describes how the focus of pricing policy progressively shifted from budget balancing to water conservation then to social protection. The next part focuses on pricing practices in the urban sector. Price levels {{and the evolution of}} tariff structures are analyzed using surveys and case studies results. The fourth section focuses on water pricing in the agricultural sector at different scales: large public irrigation schemes, smaller water user associations, and individual irrigation systems. The evolution of water <b>abstraction</b> <b>fees</b> collected by river-basin authorities is also analyzed, and we present how these fees can be modulated depending on the degree of collective management of agricultural water resources. To conclude, we discuss the efficiency of water pricing in urban and irrigation sectors and highlight some limits to take into account several uses...|$|E
