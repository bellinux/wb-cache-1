5|$|Contemporary {{political}} sociology includes these areas of research, {{but it has}} been opened up to wider questions of power and politics. Today political sociologists <b>are</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be concerned with how identities are formed that contribute to structural domination by one group over another; the politics of who knows how and with what authority; and questions of how power is contested in social interactions {{in such a way as}} to bring about widespread cultural and social change. Such questions are more likely to be studied qualitatively. The study of social movements and their effects has been especially important in relation to these wider definitions of politics and power.|$|E
25|$|A place cell {{is a type}} of {{pyramidal}} neuron within the hippocampus that becomes active when an animal enters a particular place in its environment; this place is known as the place field. A given place cell will have only one, or a few, place fields in a typical small laboratory environment, but more in a larger region. There is no apparent topography to the pattern of place fields, unlike other brain areas such as visual cortex—neighboring place cells <b>are</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have nearby fields as distant ones. In a different environment, typically about half the place cells will still have place fields, but these will be in new places unrelated to their former locations.|$|E
2500|$|Woodhouse and Collingridge {{claim that}} the essence of being “strategic” lies in a {{capacity}} for [...] "intelligent trial-and error" [...] rather than strict adherence to finely honed strategic plans. Strategy {{should be seen as}} laying out the general path rather than precise steps. Means <b>are</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> determine ends as ends are to determine means. [...] The objectives that an organization might wish to pursue are limited by the range of feasible approaches to implementation. (There will usually be {{only a small number of}} approaches that will not only be technically and administratively possible, but also satisfactory to the full range of organizational stakeholders.) In turn, the range of feasible implementation approaches is determined by the availability of resources.|$|E

2500|$|Some authors {{claim that}} the use of a hyphen in early {{published}} versions of the name is an indication that it is a pseudonym. It is argued that fictional descriptive names (such as [...] "Master Shoe-tie" [...] and [...] "Sir Luckless Woo-all") were often hyphenated in plays, and pseudonyms such as [...] "Tom Tell-truth" [...] were also sometimes hyphenated. Kathman argues {{that this is not the}} case, and that real names <b>are</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be hyphenated as pseudonyms. He states that the pseudonym [...] "Martin Marprelate" [...] is sometimes hyphenated, but usually not. Robert Waldegrave, who printed the Marprelate tracts, never hyphenated the name, but did hyphenate his own: [...] "If hyphenation was supposed to indicate a pseudonym, it is curious that Waldegrave repeatedly hyphenated his own name while failing to hyphenate an undisputed pseudonym in the same texts." ...|$|E
2500|$|Research has {{identified}} {{a number of}} demographic characteristics that appear to be important influences on cheating, including age, gender and grade point average. Older students, females, and students with higher academic achievement are less likely to cheat, whereas students involved with many extra-curricular activities are more likely to do so. Students involved in [...] extra-curricular activities may be less committed to their studies, or may have more demands on their time, which interfere with their studies, creating a greater incentive to cheat. [...] It has been found that younger students are somewhat more likely to cheat: one study finding the highest incidence of cheating occurs during sophomore year at college. Although cheating might be expected to decline with greater moral development, one experiment found that there was no relationship between how a student performed on a morality test and his likelihood of cheating (that is, students at a pre-conventional stage of morality <b>are</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> cheat as those at a post-conventional stage). [...] Higher academic procrastination was also found to increase the frequency of seven different forms of academic misconduct (using fraudulent excuses, plagiarism, copying from someone else in exams, using forbidden means in exams, carrying forbidden means into exams, copying parts of homework from others, and fabrication or falsification of data) as well as the variety of academic misconduct. This German panel study among thousands of university students argues that academic misconduct might be a coping-strategy to overcome the negative consequences of academic procrastination such as lower performance.|$|E

60|$|Nothing secures the {{tradesman}} {{against those}} men so {{well as his}} being thoroughly knowing in business, having a judgment to weigh all the delusive schemes and the fine promises of the wheedling projector, and to see which are likely to answer, or which not; to examine all his specious pretences, his calculations and figures, and see whether they <b>are</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> answer the end as he takes upon him to say they will; to make allowances for all his fine flourishes and outsides, and then to judge for himself.
