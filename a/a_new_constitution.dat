5|$|Many other {{military}} figures, such as bunker designer Josif Zagali, were also {{caught up in}} the 1974 purges.

County borders were kept largely intact, with few adjustments, and the total number of counties was raised to 71; this lasted until the beginning of World War II.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{was among}} those {{dissatisfied}} with the weak national government. He led the Annapolis Convention, which successfully influenced Congress to issue a call for the Philadelphia Convention {{in order to create}} <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>constitution.</b> He was an active participant at Philadelphia, and he helped achieve ratification by writing 51 of the 85 installments of The Federalist Papers which, to this day, are the single most important reference for Constitutional interpretation.|$|E
5|$|In January 2001, al-Jamri was {{released}} {{along with other}} opposition activists. The new emir, Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, proposed a reform plan, the National Action Charter of Bahrain, which was accepted by the opposition and later gained widespread popular support. A year later, Hamad issued <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> which al-Jamri said fell short of the opposition's demands.

5|$|It {{is likely}} that these {{appointments}} were considered possible because the Irish Free State continued to recognise the British monarch as its official head of state. In 1937, however, the Irish Free State adopted <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>constitution,</b> rendering the Crown's position in Irish affairs ambiguous. The ambiguity was resolved 12 years later when the Irish Free State formally declared itself a republic and left the British Commonwealth. The basis for such appointments thus ceased and no further ones have been made.|$|E
5|$|Several {{hundred million}} dollars in {{accounts}} traced to Abacha were discovered in 1999. The regime {{came to an end}} in 1998, when the dictator died in the villa. His successor, General Abdulsalami Abubakar, adopted <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> on 5 May 1999, which provided for multiparty elections. On 29 May 1999 Abubakar transferred power to the winner of the elections, Obasanjo, who had since retired from the military.|$|E
5|$|Tensions mounted and, on May 14, 1864, Cuza {{carried out}} a coup d'état, coinciding with the moment when Conservatives imposed a censure vote. Kogălniceanu read in Parliament the monarch's {{decision}} to dissolve it, after which Cuza introduced <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>constitution,</b> titled Statutul dezvoltător al Convenției de la Paris ("Statute Expanding the Paris Convention").

5|$|The precipitating event {{leading to}} the 1893 {{overthrow}} of the Kingdom of Hawaii, was the attempt by Queen Liliʻuokalani to promulgate <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> to regain the power for the monarchy and Native Hawaiians that had been lost under the Bayonet Constitution. The stated goals of her opponents, who were non-native Hawaiian Kingdom subjects (five American nationals, one English national, and one German national), were to depose the Queen, overthrow the monarchy, and seek Hawaii's annexation to the United States.|$|E
5|$|The {{seat of the}} {{municipal}} government is El Hatillo Town, founded in 1784 by Don Baltasar de León, who {{was instrumental in the}} area's development. Although the town had its origins during the Spanish colonisation, {{the municipal}}ity was not established until 1991. In 2000 – the year after <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> was enacted in Venezuela – some of the municipality functions were delegated to a consolidated mayor's office called Alcaldía Mayor, which also has some authority over the other four municipalities of Caracas.|$|E
5|$|Under the power-sharing agreement, {{a number}} of limited reforms were passed. In early 2009, Mugabe's {{government}} declared that—to combat rampant inflation—it would recognise U.S. dollars as legal tender and would pay government employees in this currency. This helped to stabilise prices. ZANU-PF blogged many of the proposed reforms although <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> was passed in March 2013.|$|E

5|$|Zimbabwe is a {{republic}} with a presidential system of government. The semi-presidential system was abolished with {{the adoption of}} <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> after a referendum in March 2013. Under the constitutional changes in 2005, an upper chamber, the Senate, was reinstated. The House of Assembly is the lower chamber of Parliament. President Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front (commonly abbreviated ZANU-PF) has been the dominant political party in Zimbabwe since independence.|$|E
5|$|After {{several years}} of {{comparatively}} weak government under the Articles of Confederation, a Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia proposed <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> on September 17, 1787, featuring a stronger chief executive and other changes. George Mason, a Constitutional Convention delegate and the drafter of Virginia's Declaration of Rights, proposed that {{a bill of rights}} listing and guaranteeing civil liberties be included. Other delegatesincluding future Bill of Rights drafter James Madisondisagreed, arguing that existing state guarantees of civil liberties were sufficient and that any attempt to enumerate individual rights risked the implication that other, unnamed rights were unprotected. After a brief debate, Mason's proposal was defeated by a unanimous vote of the state delegations.|$|E
5|$|Albania still {{maintained}} some {{links with}} the outside world at this time, trading with neutral countries, such as Austria and Sweden, and establishing links across the Adriatic Sea with its former colonial power Italy. However, a modest relaxation of domestic controls was curtailed by Hoxha in 1973 with a renewed wave of repression and purges directed against individuals, the young and the military, whom he feared might threaten his hold on the country. <b>A</b> <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> was introduced in 1976 that increased the Communist Party's control of the country, limited private property and forbade foreign loans. The country sank into a decade of paranoid isolation and economic stagnation, virtually cut off from the outside world.|$|E

When <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> restored the bicameral Congress, the House of Representatives stayed at the Batasang Pambansa Complex, while the Senate remained at the Old Congress Building. In May 1997, the Senate transferred to a new building it shares with the Government Service Insurance System at reclaimed land at Pasay. The Supreme Court will also transfer to its new campus at Bonifacio Global City, Taguig in 2019.|$|E
5|$|Crittenden {{ordered the}} {{refurbishing}} {{of the state}} penitentiary, which had been damaged by a fire, and called for an extensive state geological survey. He also advised {{the creation of a}} sinking fund to retire the state's debt. The state adopted <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> during Crittenden's term, though Crittenden was not a delegate to the constitutional convention and apparently had little influence on the drafting of the document. Most Whigs opposed the calling of a constitutional convention because it would necessarily involve reapportionment of the state's legislative districts and threaten Whig dominance in the General Assembly; nevertheless, Crittenden belatedly supported the call for a convention during his 1848 gubernatorial campaign.|$|E
5|$|During {{its first}} decade, {{the newly formed}} Irish Free State was governed by the victors of the civil war. When de Valera {{achieved}} power, he {{took advantage of the}} Statute of Westminster and political circumstances to build upon inroads to greater sovereignty made by the previous government. The oath was abolished and in 1937 <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>constitution</b> was adopted. This completed a process of gradual separation from the British Empire that governments had pursued since independence. However, it was not until 1949 that the state was declared, officially, to be the Republic of Ireland.|$|E
