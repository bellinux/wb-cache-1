5|$|The Vaishnava Bhakti (devotional) {{movement}} involving well-known haridasas (devotee saints) of the 14th through 16th centuries made <b>an</b> <b>indelible</b> {{imprint on}} Kannada literature, {{with the development}} of a body of literature called Haridasa Sahitya ("Haridasa literature"). This philosophy presented another strong current of devotion, pervading the lives of millions, similar to the effects of the Veerashaiva movement of the 12th century. The haridasas conveyed the message of Madhvacharya through esoteric Sanskrit writings (written by Vyasa kuta or Vyasa school) and simple Kannada language compositions, appealing to the common man, in the form of devotional songs (written by the Dasa Kuta or Dasa school). The philosophy of Madhvacharya was spread by eminent disciples such as Naraharitirtha, Jayatirtha, Vyasatirtha, Sripadaraya, Vadirajatirtha, Purandara Dasa, Kanaka Dasa and others.|$|E

40|$|An {{underlying}} {{issue to}} our current healthcare system is how decisions {{made in the}} emergency department affect patients. This is paramount for underserved populations, which {{are more likely to}} have poor physical and mental health, lack of primary care, greater use of health services, and be generally dissatisfied with their medical care. 1, 2 What should the emergency physician (EP) do for these patients? These decisions are largely based upon individual risk tolerance. While risk is <b>a</b> <b>indelible</b> part of emergency medicine (EM), a risk profile of EM residents has not been compiled. Knowledge of risk taking tendencies among this niche of medical professionals could be critical. If EM residents have great risk aversion, they might practice defensive medicine, thereby incurring crippling costs 4. On the other hand, if emergency medicine residents are greatly risk tolerant, they may make decisions that lead to significant morbidity and mortality. It is essential to establish a baseline risk profile before any corrective measures can be advanced. This study attempted to accomplish precisely that using Risk Type CompassTM. [URL]...|$|R
5|$|Among {{the oldest}} {{surviving}} examples of Ottoman architecture in Istanbul are the Anadoluhisarı and Rumelihisarı fortresses, which assisted the Ottomans during their siege of the city. Over {{the next four}} centuries, the Ottomans made <b>an</b> <b>indelible</b> impression on the skyline of Istanbul, building towering mosques and ornate palaces. The largest palace, Topkapı, includes a diverse array of architectural styles, from Baroque inside the Harem, to its Neoclassical style Enderûn Library. The imperial mosques include Fatih Mosque, Bayezid Mosque, Yavuz Selim Mosque, Süleymaniye Mosque, Sultan Ahmed Mosque (the Blue Mosque), and Yeni Mosque, {{all of which were}} built {{at the peak of the}} Ottoman Empire, in the 16th and 17th centuries. In the following centuries, and especially after the Tanzimat reforms, Ottoman architecture was supplanted by European styles. An example of which is the imperial Nuruosmaniye Mosque. Areas around İstiklal Avenue were filled with grand European embassies and rows of buildings in Neoclassical, Renaissance Revival and Art Nouveau styles, which went on to influence the architecture of a variety of structures in Beyoğlu—including churches, stores, and theaters—and official buildings such as Dolmabahçe Palace.|$|E
5|$|Life {{under the}} Japanese changed rapidly {{as many of}} the {{traditional}} structures were replaced by a military power. Aborigines who wished to improve their status looked to education rather than headhunting as the new form of power. Those who learned to work with the Japanese and follow their customs would be better suited to lead villages. The Japanese encouraged aborigines to maintain traditional costumes and selected customs that were not considered detrimental to society, but invested much time and money in efforts to eliminate traditions deemed unsavory by Japanese culture, including tattooing. By the mid-1930s as Japan's empire was reaching its zenith, the colonial government began a political socialization program designed to enforce Japanese customs, rituals and a loyal Japanese identity upon the aborigines. By the end of World War II, aborigines whose fathers had been killed in pacification campaigns were volunteering to serve in Special Units and if need be die for the Emperor of Japan. The Japanese colonial experience left <b>an</b> <b>indelible</b> mark on many older aborigines who maintained an admiration for the Japanese long after their departure in 1945.|$|E
5|$|Of Tchaikovsky's Western contemporaries, Robert Schumann {{stands out}} as an {{influence}} in formal structure, harmonic practices and piano writing, according to Brown and musicologist Roland John Wiley. As mentioned earlier, Asafyev comments that Schumann left his mark on Tchaikovsky {{not just as a}} formal influence but also as an example of musical dramaturgy and self-expression. Leon Botstein claims the music of Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner also left their imprints on Tchaikovsky's orchestral style. The late-Romantic trend for writing orchestral suites, begun by Franz Lachner, Jules Massenet, and Joachim Raff after the rediscovery of Bach's works in that genre, may have influenced Tchaikovsky to try his own hand at them. His teacher Anton Rubinstein's opera The Demon became a model for the final tableau of Eugene Onegin. So did Léo Delibes' ballets Coppélia and Sylvia for The Sleeping Beauty and Georges Bizet's opera Carmen (a work Tchaikovsky admired tremendously) for The Queen of Spades. Otherwise, it was to composers of the past that Tchaikovsky turned—Beethoven, whose music he respected; Mozart, whose music he loved; Glinka, whose opera A Life for the Tsar made <b>an</b> <b>indelible</b> impression on him as a child and whose scoring he studied assiduously; and Adolphe Adam, whose ballet Giselle was a favorite of his from his student days and whose score he consulted while working on The Sleeping Beauty. Beethoven's string quartets may have influenced Tchaikovsky's attempts in that medium. Other composers whose work interested Tchaikovsky included Hector Berlioz, Felix Mendelssohn, Giacomo Meyerbeer, and Henry Litolff.|$|E
