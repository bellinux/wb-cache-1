50|$|This form of {{magnesium}} supplementation has increased bioavailability compared to oxide and citrate. There were some promising clinical trials {{conducted in the}} 1960s that found a combination {{of magnesium}} and potassium aspartates had {{a positive effect on}} fatigue and they reduced muscle hyper-excitability.In its evaluation in 2005, the <b>AFC</b> <b>Panel</b> concluded that in humans the bioavailability of magnesium from magnesium L-aspartate was similar to that from other organic magnesium salts and the more soluble inorganic magnesium salts. Overall, it was concluded that organic salts of magnesium have the greatest water solubility and demonstrate a greater oral absorption and bioavailability compared to less soluble magnesium preparations such as magnesium oxide, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium carbonate and magnesium sulphate.|$|E

[...] "The experts of the EFSA <b>AFC</b> <b>panel</b> and its working group on food additives will look at this issue to see if new scientific evidence is available that may require further actions. If the experts conclude that consumer exposure to diacetyl can reach levels well above those considered as safe and, that a possible health risk for consumers cannot be excluded when inhaling diacetyl, EFSA will give priority to the re-evaluation of this substance and provide detailed scientific advice." ...|$|E
40|$|The 26 th Plenary {{meeting of}} the <b>AFC</b> <b>Panel</b> on 27 - 29 November 2007 {{discussed}} the flavouring group evaluation 19 (FGE. 19) which included alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehydes or ketones {{considered to be a}} structural alert for genotoxicity. The flavour industry was requested to submit data on genotoxicity of 3 -acetyl- 2, 5 -dimethylthiophene [FL-no 15. 024] (subgroup 5. 2 in the FGE. 19; the other substances of this subgroup were evaluated in FGE. 224). An in vitro bacterial mutation assay was positive in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA 98, TA 100 and TA 102 in the presence of rat liver metabolic activation system (S 9 -mix), and an in vivo study on mutant frequency in Muta™Mice was positive in liver after exposure to 3 -acetyl- 2, 5 -dimethylthiophene. Based on this outcome the CEF Panel considered 3 -acetyl- 2, 5 -dimethylthiophene as mutagenic in vitro and in vivo and concluded that its use as flavouring substance raises a safety concern...|$|E
