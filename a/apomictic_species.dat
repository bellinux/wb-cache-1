Clone diversity indices calculated according to the Shannon — Weaver index differed in two latter species in the average sampling by 4 and in the overall sampling by 1. 8 times. The results corroborate the tendency characteristic of <b>apomictic</b> earthworms: small <b>species</b> have higher level of genetic diversity than big ones. So, the tendency typical of all animals is confirmed: under same conditions, small organisms have higher level of genetic diversity in comparison with big ones. This universal tendency is explained by a higher speed of metabolic and physiological processes characteristic of quickly maturing small animals...|$|R

Based on the critical treatment of herbarium material both collected by authors in various regions of Azerbaijan and that deposited in BAK and LE, as well as analysis of relevant literature, D. talyschensis (Askerov et A. Bobr.) Askerov et U. Aktcay, D. schorapanensis Askerov, D. iranica Fras. -Jenk., and D. raddeana (Fomin) Fomin are recognized as worthy being accepted at the rank of a species, and D. borreri (Newm.) Newm. ex Oberh. et Tavel, D. remota (A. Br. ex Döll.) Druce, and D. assimilis S. Walker are prior names for the other South Caucasian representatives of the genus. Dryopteris talyschensis known before as D. raddeana var. talyschensis Askerov et A. Bobr. (Asgarov, Bobrov, 1972) by its morpho-biological and ecological featers differs considerably from D. raddeana which is a relic and endemic species of hircanian flora. Dryopteris schorapanensis initially (Askerov, 1978) described as a hybrid, later, based on morphological and cytogenetic studies, has been {{proven to be a}} distinct <b>apomictic</b> triploid <b>species</b> (Johns et al., 1996; Fraser-Jenkins, 2007). Similarly, it was demonstrated that D. affinis subsp. coriacea Fras. -Jenk. is rather widespread in the Caucasus, possess original morphology and should better be treated as another <b>apomictic</b> triploid <b>species,</b> D. iranica. Although Fraser-Jenkins (1977, 1986) considered D. radd­eana as D. pallida (Bory) Fomin subsp. subsp. raddeana (Fomin) Fr. -Jenk., we accepte it with species status.

40|$|Background and Aims: Apomixis {{in plants}} generates clonal progeny with a {{maternal}} genotype through asexual seed formation. Hieracium subgenus Pilosella (Asteraceae) contains polyploid, highly heterozygous <b>apomictic</b> and sexual <b>species.</b> Within <b>apomictic</b> Hieracium, dominant genetic loci independently regulate the qualitative developmental components of apomixis. In H. praealtum, LOSS OF APOMEIOSIS (LOA) enables formation of embryo sacs without meiosis and LOSS OF PARTHENOGENESIS (LOP) enables fertilization-independent seed formation. A locus required for fertilization-independent endosperm formation (AutE) {{has been identified}} in H. piloselloides. Additional quantitative loci appear to influence the penetrance of the qualitative loci, although the controlling genes remain unknown. This study aimed to develop the first genetic linkage maps for sexual and <b>apomictic</b> Hieracium <b>species</b> using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers derived from expressed transcripts within the developing ovaries. Methods: RNA from microdissected Hieracium ovule cell types and ovaries was sequenced and SSRs were identified. Two different F 1 mapping populations were created to overcome difficulties associated with genome complexity and asexual reproduction. SSR markers were analysed within each mapping population to generate draft linkage maps for apomictic and sexual Hieracium species. Key Results: A collection of 14 684 Hieracium expressed SSR markers were developed and linkage maps were constructed for Hieracium species using {{a subset of the}} SSR markers. Both the LOA and LOP loci were successfully assigned to linkage groups; however, AutE could not be mapped using the current populations. Comparisons with lettuce (Lactuca sativa) revealed partial macrosynteny between the two Asteraceae species. Conclusions: A collection of SSR markers and draft linkage maps were developed for two apomictic and one sexual Hieracium species. These maps will support cloning of controlling genes at LOA and LOP loci in Hieracium and should also assist with identification of quantitative loci that affect the expressivity of apomixis. Future work will focus on mapping AutE using alternative populations. Kenta Shirasawa, Melanie L. Hand, Steven T. Henderson, Takashi Okada, Susan D. Johnson, Jennifer M.

50|$|While the {{boundaries}} of the Rosaceae are not disputed, there is not general agreement as to how many genera it contains. Areas of divergent opinion include the treatment of Potentilla s.l. and Sorbus s.l.. Compounding the problem is that apomixis is common in several genera. This results in an uncertainty in the number of species contained in each of these genera, due to the difficulty of dividing <b>apomictic</b> complexes into <b>species.</b> For example, Cotoneaster contains between 70 and 300 species, Rosa around 100 (including the taxonomically complex dog roses), Sorbus 100 to 200 species, Crataegus between 200 and 1,000, Alchemilla around 300 species, Potentilla roughly 500, and Rubus hundreds, or possibly even thousands of species.|$|R

The total of 109 samples collected from various locations in Croatia were compared {{on the basis}} of RAPD profiles obtained by amplifications with six primers. Materials and Methods: Total cellular DNA was extracted from the samples collected from 8 locations in Croatia. PCR amplification was performed using 6 decamer oligonucleotide primers. Allele frequencies were computed according to Bayesian method with non-uniform prior distribution. The number of polymorphic loci (95 % criterion) and Nei’s gene diversity for population and the group of subspecies were calculated using program package AFLP-SURV 1. 0. Results and Conclusions: The results obtained show gene diversity in H. perforatum L. in a range between 0. 121 and 0. 301. Three populations had significantly lower level of diversity, four populations had slightly higher, while one population was polymorphic. Higher polymorphism of one population as well as variations in values between different populations may be explained by residual fertility and outcrossing which may have occurred in some populations.

Polyploidy and apomixis are strongly associated with hybrid speciation, presumably due to the opportunities they provide for both reestablishing reproductive function in hybrids with incomplete chromosomal homology and creating rapid reproductive isolation in sympatry. Boechera, a species-rich genus closely related to Arabidopsis, is a particularly fertile ground {{for the study of}} hybrid speciation. Thirty-eight <b>apomictic</b> triploid hybrid <b>species</b> are currently recognized in Boechera.

Given this complexity, focused studies of individual species complexes are critical to understanding speciation and diagnosing biodiversity in Boechera. Here we analyze DNA sequences from seven nuclear loci and multilocus genotypes from 15 microsatellite markers in a group of closely related taxa formerly included in B. fendleri. Our results support the recognition of four species previously segregated from B. fendleri s. l., including three genetically distinct, sexual diploids (B. fendleri, B. spatifolia, and B. texana) and one apomictic triploid hybrid (B. porphyrea). We also identify four novel <b>apomictic</b> diploid hybrid <b>species</b> (B. carrizozoensis, B. centrifendleri, B. sanluisensis, and B. zephyra) and additional apomictic triploid hybrids.

To investigate their breeding system, four nonapomictic diploid and 10 nonapomictic triploid hybrids were pollinated with diploids and the progenies were analysed. Seed fertility was significantly reduced in two diploid hybrids. Nine triploid hybrids were fertile and could be classified into three types, {{with respect to the}} composition of their progenies. Type A produced n + n hybrids. Type B produced either a mixture of n + n and 2 n + n hybrids, or a mixture of pseudogamous 2 n + 0 apomicts and 2 n + n hybrids. Type C produced exclusively 2 n + n hybrids. Inheritance of a microsatellite marker strongly suggested that 2 n egg cells in type C plants were produced by a first division restitution mechanism. As in apomicts, microsporogenesis in type C plants was reductional. This suggests that type C plants are diplosporous plants that lack parthenogenesis. Such plants are very rare in other <b>apomictic</b> plant <b>species.</b> It is concluded that 'elements of apomixis', diplospory and parthenogenesis, can be uncoupled.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the genetic diversity among accessions of Paspalum notatum based on morphological marker traits and identify those morphological traits that contribute most to the variability among accessions. Fifty-three accessions were evaluated for the following traits: length, width, color, and pubescence of sheath; length, width, insertion angle, color of midrib, and pubescence of leaves; number, length, and angle of racemes; length of flowering stems; and plant growth habit (erect or prostrate). Multivariate analysis of the quantitative morphological data based on the Mahalanobis distance and UPGMA method grouped the accessions into 19 heterogeneous clusters. The relative contribution of each trait to cluster formation was obtained using the Singh method. Qualitative morphological traits were used to construct a dendrogram based on Jaccard's similarity, generating 13 clusters. Based on the morphological traits investigated, there is high genetic variation among accessions of P. notatum, demonstrating that these accessions have a good potential for a breeding program. Length of racemes, width of sheath, length of flowering stems, and length of leaves were found to contribute most to the variability among accessions. A number of traits contributed to a lesser degree.
