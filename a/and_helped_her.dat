25|$|During {{her life}} as a courtesan, her {{discretion}} and loyalty to her benefactors became the focal point of her career. There were many rumours about her being involved with certain wealthy men of the time, but she never confirmed or denied these rumours. This gave her great weight in the courtesan lifestyle, and made her a sought-after commodity. It also gave long life to her career, <b>and</b> <b>helped</b> <b>her</b> to retire a wealthy woman of society around 1890. Her estate was worth a very considerable £2,764 19s. 6d at her death. As well as her home in Mayfair, which according to DNB she had from 1872, she seems to have had other addresses, judging from a court case in which she was sued for non-payment of a tailoring bill. The other addresses may have been properties she owned. Two were hotels, one in France.|$|E

She returned home <b>and</b> <b>helped</b> <b>her</b> parents manage a hotel and taught in two mountain schools before accepting a position to be director of music at a Methodist school for girls in Huzhou, (now Wuxing, Zhejiang), China. She was not a churchgoer and did not consider herself religious, however this time abroad gave way for a pivotal moment in Smith's awareness of the Southern double standard. She studied Chinese philosophy during her time overseas and by living there was exposed to the similarities between the suppression of the Chinese and African Americans in the States.|$|E
