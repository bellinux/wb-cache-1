40|$|The {{additive}} manufacturing process Selective Laser Melting (SLM) {{can be used}} to directly produce functional components made out of metal. During the construction process, however, thermally induced internal stress occurs due to the layered build-up and the local input of energy by means of a focused laser beam, which can lead to distortion of the component or sections of the component itself. Normally, distortion is prevented by means of supporting structures between the component and the substrate plate. It is not always possible, however, to provide all the areas of a component with supporting structures or to remove them later, depending on how complex the geometry or how accessible the structures are. When the substrate plate is heated during the construction process, the distortion can be reduced or eliminated entirely. Nonetheless, a systematic investigation {{of the extent to which}} preheating influences distortion of aluminum components has not yet been conducted. This works aims at systematically investigating the effects of preheating during SLM of aluminum components and determining <b>an</b> appropriate <b>preheating</b> temperature at which distortion practically no longer occurs. A significant reduction in distortion compared to the distortion without preheating can be seen beginning at <b>a</b> <b>preheating</b> temperature of 150 °C. At <b>a</b> <b>preheating</b> temperature of 250 °C, distortion can no longer be detected within the scope of the measuring accuracy independent of the twin cantilever test geometry investigated. In addition reducing distortion, the preheating changes the stress-related cracks in the component, which can lead to tearing of the parts of the test geometry. With 90 HV 0. 1 at <b>a</b> <b>preheating</b> temperature of 250 °C, the hardness is greater than the required minimum hardness according to DIN EN 1706 of die-cast parts from the material AlSi 10 Mg. From these results it can be concluded that <b>a</b> <b>preheating</b> temperature of 250 °C is suitable for reliably manufacturing components made out of the material AlSi 10 Mg using SLM free of defects and for preventing distortion completely...|$|R

Bulk textures and through-wall variations were determined using neutron diffraction. We correlate these with microstructures determined by transmission electron microscopy. With <b>a</b> <b>preheat</b> temperature of 925 ?K where {{the material is}} ~ 90 % [alpha]-phase, the basal plane are distributed between radial (R) and transverse (T) directions with a small bias towards the T direction.
