5000|$|A {{compensation}} winding in a DC shunt motor is a winding {{in the field}} pole face plate that carries armature current to reduce stator field distortion. Its purpose is to reduce brush arcing and erosion in DC motors that are operated with weak fields, variable heavy loads or reversing operation such as steel-mill motors. When flux from the armature current is about equal to the flux from the field current, the flux at the field pole plate is shifted. Under a fixed load, there is an optimal commutation point for the brushes that minimizes arcing and erosion of the brushes. When the ratio of <b>armature</b> <b>flux</b> to field flux varies greatly or reverses, the optimum commutation point shifts as result of the varying flux at the pole face plate. The result is arcing of the brushes. By adding a compensating winding in the pole face plate that carries armature current {{in the opposite direction}} of current in the adjacent armature windings, the position of the flux at the pole face plate can be restored to the position it would have with zero armature current. The main drawback of a {{compensation winding}} is the expense.|$|E
40|$|Linear {{synchronous}} motors can be {{used for}} large scale electromagnetic launch. The machines are short time rated and can therefore use substantial values of stator current loading. This leads to high values of <b>armature</b> <b>flux</b> and the risk of demagnetising the excitation magnets. In order to mitigate this risk by reducing the <b>armature</b> <b>flux,</b> quadrature axis flux barriers can be positioned in the permanent magnet backing iron. These reduce the armature field but leave the permanent magnet excitation field largely unchanged. In addition to improving the force due to the larger usable stator current loading, the barriers are beneficial in reducing the synchronous reactance and hence improving the power factor and reducing the Volt Amps per Newton of useful force (VA/N) of a linear motor. The paper explores the use of these barriers for a typical configuration and shows the performance improvements that can be obtained...|$|E
40|$|The {{inductance}} {{characteristic of}} doubly salient permanent magnet (DSPM) motors {{is the basis}} of design, analysis, and control of the motor. Due to the nonlinearity and doubly salient structure of the motor, this characteristic is a function of not only the rotor position, but also the strengthening and weakening actions of the <b>armature</b> <b>flux</b> to the permanent magnet (PM) flux, which makes the measurement of inductance difficult. This article proposes new methods for the measurement of the motor inductance for any rotor positions and level of excitation. The methods are applied to the two newly proposed DSPM motors and the results are compared with those obtained by finite element analysis.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} three reluctance {{machines with}} flux assistance. These machines provide alternative novel geometries that provide high efficiencies with {{a reduction in}} the ampere turns in the armature windings for torque production, lowering armature winding switching losses and reducing the power electronic rating. The Dual Stack Variable Reluctance Machine is a switched reluctance variant of the homopolar inductor alternator topology. The Single Stack Variable Reluctance Machine is a simplification of the Dual Stack machine. Both machines use a toroidal field winding to provide additional flux. The methods of connecting armature coils on each stator pole to utilise the <b>armature</b> <b>flux</b> and the choice of power electronic circuitry are important. Testing shows that such machines favour unipolar excitation with single coil per pole for the armature windings. Use of the field winding in series with the armature windings improves torque production. The Dual Stack Variable Reluctance Machine can have the mechanical angular displacement between the two stator stacks varied to provide an improved back emf waveshape for smoother torque production. The Single Stack Variable Reluctance Machine has parasitic and axial air gaps that pose interesting design issues (e. g. end thrust). Magnets can be placed in steel sections where flux is unidirectional. An ideal candidate for magnet insertion is the Flux Switching Motor. A Permanent Magnet Flux Switching Motor has been built that replaces the field windings with ferrite magnets. The Permanent Magnet Flux Switching Motor achieves efficiencies of over 80 %. It adds no additional cost to the fan application as cost savings in lower temperature rated thermoplastics offsets the cost of magnets. A prototyping circuit incorporating a novel micro-processor program to alter the commutation timings as the machine operates has been designed to allow fast optimisation of each machine for minimum input power. ...|$|E

In the first stage machine the superconducting field winding was shielded from <b>armature</b> reaction <b>fluxes</b> with the aid of iron and compensating windings. In the second stage machine the superconducting field winding was subjected to the full effects of the <b>armature</b> reaction <b>fluxes.</b> Tests conducted with these machines indicated that the operation of the superconducting field winding was not influenced by the flow of armature currents. A third, four pole superconducting D. C. machine which exhibits all the advantages gained by using superconductors in the field windings has been constructed. This machine has most of the construction features of a full size prototype machine for future industrial applications. As a result of difficulties encountered in inducing the superconducting state into the field windings operational tests on this machine could not be conducted. Possible reasons for the difficulties are discussed with the result that some of the reasons are rejected and measures that could overcome the difficulties are forwarded. The project began with no experience in cryogenics, cryostat design and construction nor superconductivity. Consequently details of practical techniques utilised during the project are included. Continued development of superconducting heteropolar D. C. machines should prove that the design and operation of a prototype machine with a rating in excess of 10 MW is possible.

40|$|In hybrid {{excitation}} machines (HEMs), {{there are}} two main flux sources which are permanent magnet (PM) and field excitation coil (FEC). These HEMs have better features when compared with interior permanent magnet synchronous machines (IPMSM) used in conventional hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). Since all flux sources including PM, FEC and armature coils are located on stator core, the rotor becomes a single piece structure similar with switch reluctance machine (SRM). The combined flux generated by PM and FEC established more excitation fluxes that are required to produce much higher torque of the motor. In addition, variable DC FEC can control the flux capabilities of the motor, thus the machine can be applied for high-speed motor drive system.

50|$|The diagram shows three {{arrangements}} of a metadyne machine. In all cases, compensation windings have been omitted for clarity. The first arrangement represents a one-cycle cross-field machine. In a normal DC machine, {{the effect of}} the excitation current generates a flux (A1), which in turn generates a quadrature flux which is at right angles to the exciting flux. By wiring the quadrature brushes together, current is produced in the <b>armature,</b> and the <b>flux</b> that this produces (A2) is again at right angles to the quadrature axis, resulting in an armature reaction which is directly opposed to the original excitation. This feature is fundamental to the machine, and does not depend on its direction of rotation. When the armature reaction is partially compensated by a compensation winding, the uncompensated portion of the armature reaction acts in this way. As the output current rises, it suppresses {{the effect of the}} excitation, until it reaches a state where there is just enough excitation to maintain the current. Any further increase would eliminate the flux which sustains its operation, and the current is maintained irrespective of the resistance of the load or the back emf produced by it. The machine thus acts as a constant-current generator, where the current is proportional to the excitation.|$|R
