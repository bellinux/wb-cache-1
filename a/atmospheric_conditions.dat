The {{microstructure}} and tribological {{properties of}} space copper-based friction material fabricated by Powder Metallurgy technology were studied using optical metallographic microscope and MM- 1000 -type tribo-tester, respectively. The results are shown as follows: The lubricant MoS 2 was resolved during sintering, {{resulting in the}} loss of S element. MoS 2 and its resolvents reacted with other components into some new compounds which contribute to the tribological properties of friction material. The lubrication mechanism of these new compounds showed essential difference in comparison to that for MoS 2; the friction coefficient was higher under <b>atmospheric</b> <b>condition</b> than that under vacuum conditions, but almost the same under low and high vacuum conditions. It decreased under both atmospheric and low vacuum conditions with the increase of load. The environmental temperature had insignificant effect on the friction coefficient; under <b>atmospheric</b> <b>condition</b> as load increased, the mass loss of material decreased linearly, then increased. With regard to low vacuum condition as load increased, the mass loss of material increased, then decreased; the stable coefficient of friction material under vacuum condition was higher than that under <b>atmospheric</b> <b>condition...</b>|$|R

5|$|Hurricane Iselle was {{the strongest}} {{tropical}} cyclone to make landfall on the Big Island of Hawaii in recorded history. The eleventh named storm of the annual hurricane season, Iselle developed from an area of disturbed weather southwest of Mexico on July31, 2014. Assuming a west-northwest course that it would maintain throughout its existence, generally favorable <b>atmospheric</b> <b>conditions</b> allowed for gradual strengthening, with the cyclone attaining hurricane status a day after formation. Continued strengthening progressed for several days up until August4, when Iselle reached peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 140mph (220km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 947mbar (hPa; 27.96inHg), making it a Category4hurricane. Thereafter, Iselle encountered hostile environmental conditions and quickly weakened before making landfall on the Big Island on August8 as a moderate tropical storm. Its passage over the island disrupted the cyclone, and Iselle later dissipated on August9.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Katia was {{a classic}} Cape Verde {{hurricane}} that had substantial impact across Europe as a post-tropical cyclone. The eleventh named storm, second hurricane, and second major hurricane of the active 2011 Atlantic hurricane season, Katia originated as a tropical depression from a tropical wave over the eastern Atlantic on August29. It intensified into a tropical storm the following day and further developed into a hurricane by September1, although unfavorable <b>atmospheric</b> <b>conditions</b> hindered strengthening thereafter. As the storm began to recurve over the western Atlantic, a more hospitable regime allowed Katia to become a major hurricane by September5 and peak as a Category4 hurricane with winds of 140mph (220km/h) that afternoon. Internal core processes, increased wind shear, an impinging cold front, and increasingly cool ocean temperatures all prompted the cyclone to weaken almost immediately after peak, and Katia ultimately transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September10.|$|E

The PAGASA consequently named the system Juaning for local purposes.

5|$|Initially, Cecil was {{forecast}} {{to maintain}} a northward track into a weakness in a subtropical ridge left behind by Typhoon Brenda; however, Cecil turned westward on May23 due to another ridge over China. With favorable <b>atmospheric</b> <b>conditions,</b> Cecil continued to intensify through May24. By 0600UTC, a ragged 75km (45mi) wide eye developed over the center of circulation, indicating {{it had become a}} typhoon. The storm ultimately attained peak winds of 140km/h (85mph) while situated just off the coast of central Vietnam. However, the JMA reported Cecil to have been slightly weaker, classifying it as a severe tropical storm with ten-minute sustained winds of 110km/h (70mph). Around 1800UTC, the storm made landfall near Hoi An with winds of 130km/h (80mph). Once onshore, Cecil quickly weakened to a tropical depression. Turning slightly to the west-northwest, the remnants of Cecil continued inland before dissipating over eastern Laos early on May26.|$|E
5|$|Many {{tropical}} cyclones develop {{when the}} <b>atmospheric</b> <b>conditions</b> around a weak disturbance {{in the atmosphere}} are favorable. Others form when other types of cyclones acquire tropical characteristics. Tropical systems are then moved by steering winds in the troposphere; if the conditions remain favorable, the tropical disturbance intensifies, and can even develop an eye. On {{the other end of}} the spectrum, if the conditions around the system deteriorate or the tropical cyclone makes landfall, the system weakens and eventually dissipates. A tropical cyclone can become extratropical as it moves toward higher latitudes if its energy source changes from heat released by condensation to differences in temperature between air masses. A tropical cyclone is usually not considered to become subtropical during its extratropical transition.|$|E
