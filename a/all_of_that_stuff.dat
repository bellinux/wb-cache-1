500|$|At the time, it was {{unheard of}} for a debuting artist {{to receive the}} coveted rating. Author Matthew Gasteier writes, “It's {{difficult}} to overestimate the impact of receiving the five out of five mics, the first such rating given to any new release by the magazine since its then-editor Reginald Dennis put a moratorium on them." [...] Reginald Dennis, former music editor of the magazine and XXL co-founder, later recounted, [...] "Awarding records 5 mics – classic status – has always been, on some levels, troubling to me. I mean, we are not only saying that a particular piece of music is superior to everything that is out now, {{but it will be}} better than most things released in the future as well [...] I only gave one 5 under my watch and it went to Nas's Illmatic." [...] Dennis cited it as [...] "the only time I ever broke the 'no 5' rule" [...] and added, [...] "I told Jon that we'd work <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff</b> out {{when it was time to}} review the album. But everyday, Jon was like, 'yo, this album is 5 mics — seriously, Reg, 5 mics!' ...|$|E
500|$|The film's {{visual effects}} were created using mostly {{practical}} effects, supplemented by computer-generated imagery (CGI) created by Hammerhead VFX for about 15% of the film's special effects, {{such as the}} transformations. Wirkola said: [...] "I’m {{a big believer in}} just using CGI to polish what you get on camera. For me that’s the ideal use of CGI. We have a troll in the film that is animatronic. I loved him. It took some convincing to get the studio along with the animatronic creature. There have been bad experiences with animatronics throughout various productions but I saw this company Spectral Motion. They did the Hellboy movies and I just loved it." [...] Wirkola added: [...] "I come from Norway where we can’t afford CGI. But this is a fantastical world of witches and trolls and I wanted to ground the movie where I could. The blood should look real." [...] Janssen, however, despite Wirkola's warnings, [...] "was not entirely prepared for how involved and long that was going to be" [...] and [...] "actually wanted to burn the prosthetic make-up {{by the end of the}} movie." [...] She recalled being [...] "so overwhelmed by what this prosthetic business was all about", saying: [...] "Acting has been so specific for me and what I've learned - eyes, facial expressions, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff</b> - and with something like this, you're robbed of all of this. Or I could no [...] rely on things I've done in the past. It was different and frustrating at times because I had this circus of people around me in case something became unglued." [...] Muriel and the other principal witches were prepared by Mike Elizalde's Spectral Motion, who also created and handled the animatronic troll. Jon Farhat was the visual effects supervisor and aerial second unit director.|$|E
2500|$|The Dust Brothers had a {{bunch of}} music {{together}}, before we arrived to work with them. As a result, a lot of the tracks come from songs they'd planned to release to clubs as instrumentals – [...] "Shake Your Rump," [...] for example. They'd put together some beats, basslines and guitar lines, all these loops together, and they were quite surprised when we said we wanted to rhyme on it, because they thought it was too dense. They offered to strip it down to just beats, but we wanted <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff</b> on there. I think half of the tracks were written when we got there, and the other half we wrote together." ...|$|E

5000|$|The mall {{opened in}} June 1958. It {{was billed as}} the largest {{shopping}} centre in Western Canada, with about 30 stores and services.

A lot has happened since 1995; a lot has happened in our lives and we've never talked about it or discussed it publicly. So some of that is what's addressed here. That's the way we operate, it's about what really happened in life. We're not really the fast cars and chicks songs. It's basically what's happened in life, but a lot has happened since the last record. And it's on this record." [...] The title track, [...] "Black Gives Way to Blue", was written as a tribute to Staley. Regarding the lyrics to other specific songs, Cantrell said the first single from the album, [...] "A Looking in View", [...] "basically speaks to any number of things that keep you balled up inside." [...] The second single, [...] "Check My Brain", features lyrics dealing with Cantrell's move from Seattle to Los Angeles in 2003. The third single, [...] "Your Decision", contains lyrics about [...] "surviving pain and choosing to live." [...] Cantrell also denied a popular misconception that the song [...] "Private Hell" [...] is about Layne Staley. He stated that the song is in fact about himself breaking up with a girl that he loved a lot and he [...] "wasn't man enough to go through with it". But Cantrell also pointed out that there's {{a lot of things in}} the song that aren't specifically about that and other people can relate to.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2015, Jonathan Levine, Ted Melfi, Jason Moore, {{the writing}} team of John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein, and Jared Hess were being {{considered}} {{to direct the}} film. Butterfield, Holland, Judah Lewis, Matthew Lintz, Charlie Plummer, and Charlie Rowe screen tested for the lead role against Robert Downey Jr., who portrays Tony Stark / Iron Man in the MCU, for [...] "chemistry". The six were chosen out of a search of over 1,500 actors to test in front of Feige, Pascal, and the Russo brothers, the directors of Captain America: Civil War. By early June 2015, Levine and Melfi had become the favorites to direct the film, with Daley and Goldstein, and Jon Watts also in consideration, while Feige and Pascal narrowed the actors considered to Holland and Rowe, with both screen testing with Downey again. Holland also tested with Chris Evans, who portrays Steve Rogers / Captain America in the MCU, and emerged as the favorite. On June 23, Marvel and Sony officially announced that Holland would star as Spider-Man, and that Watts would direct the film. The Russos [...] "were pretty vocal about who [...] wanted for the part", pushing to cast an actor close {{to the age of}} Peter Parker in order to differentiate from the previous portrayals. They also praised Holland for having a dancing and gymnastics background. Watts was able to read the Civil War script, talk with the Russos, and was on set for the filming of Spider-Man's scenes in that film. He was able to [...] "see what they were doing with it" [...] and provide [...] "ideas about this and that", including what Parker's bedroom and wardrobe looked like [...] "so that my movie transitions seamlessly with theirs." [...] On joining the MCU and directing the film, Watts said, [...] "I was really excited about that, because the other movies have shown what I described as the Penthouse level of the Marvel world, what it’s like to be Thor, Iron Man, you know, a billionaire playboy and <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff.</b> But what’s great about Spider-Man is that he’s a regular kid and so by showing his story you also get to show what the ground level is like in a world where the Avengers exist".|$|E
5000|$|Elisabeth Moss later {{remarked on}} Wheatley and the shoot: [...] "I don't {{know anyone who}} makes movies like he does... (it was) like if you gave him a bigger crew, {{a little bit more}} money, costumes and hair and makeup, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff</b> that maybe he hasn't had before. It was so fun, he is just a fucking genius and he's so funny." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{a regular}} sell," [...] Bill said. [...] "I {{wanted to hear}} old Plunket stid <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff</b> about nothin'. <b>That</b> was a lunkin' good-lookin' woman though," [...] he added, with a coarse {{suggestion}} in his voice, which exasperated Johnny to the pitch of giving him a kick on the heel as he walked in front.

5000|$|This water-charged {{inspiration}} {{comes from}} their home, {{the north of}} England. Andrew Craighan said that they [...] "subscribe very much to {{the ideas of the}} mist and the fog and the castles. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> typical English <b>stuff.</b> Constantly fucking raining. And it's just always bleak here. It's always cold. It's always miserable.

Soon it is over, and to th' Earth I render, To the {{everlasting}} Sun, the atoms, Which {{for pain}} and pleasure join'd to form me; And {{of the mighty}} Talbot, whose renown Once fill'd the world, remains nought but a handful Of light dust. Thus man comes to his end; And our one conquest in this fight of life Is the conviction of life's nothingness, And deep disdain <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> sorry <b>stuff</b> We once thought lofty and desirable.|$|R
5000|$|When {{describing}} Igor, Christopher Fitzgerald said, [...] "Igor {{is certainly}} very clown like, Shakespearean clown like. Kind of {{comments on the}} action, and {{has a lot of}} very bizarre non sequiturs, with a kind of higher status {{than anyone else in the}} show. Or believes he does. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff,</b> that was all my background growing up, a lot of vaudeville stuff traveling around New England doing those types of shows. Igor is a devoted servant who loves to serve, although maybe isn't very good at it. He does it in his own kind of personal way." ...|$|E
5000|$|The song has a 1980s feel to it. Natasha Khan (aka Bat for Lashes) {{explained}} to BBC's Newsbeat: [...] "Well, I've {{always been an}} '80s girl, and I think on the first record I was quite shy really and I wanted to just keep it how I'd been playing it in my bedroom. I {{grew up listening to}} The Cure and I loved early Madonna and Prince and <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff,</b> so I think what prompted me was just probably having more confidence to kind of reach out and reveal even more of myself and what I love and not be too shy about it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Critics {{have charged}} that the school's {{training}} is overpriced and that students are pressured to pay exorbitant amounts of money for additional courses or seminars of questionable value. Even some critics of the school, however, acknowledge that the rigorous training includes valuable self-defense skills, and students report further benefits such as greatly improved health and even recovery from injury and illness. One student described the training as [...] "like paying for therapy and personal trainers and a gym and <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff</b> rolled into one", and another said that Oom Yung Doe charges [...] "twice what other schools charge. But what they teach there is 10 times more than what they teach at other schools." ...|$|E
5000|$|Regarding {{the state}} of music sampling, Deborah has always {{considered}} it an art, [...] "I think sampling is an art and I think it’s incredible. When I first started, I was told how it was theft. I was told that hip-hop and rap was a phase. That it wasn’t going to be around. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> horrible, negative <b>stuff.</b> I kept saying “well, a collage, that’s not real art? Jambalaya isn’t real food?” That’s a great meal mixed up of different foods and spices, that’s what sampling is." ...|$|R
5000|$|I {{never use}} it, I hate the term {{pure and simple}} and agree with Tom’s {{assessment}} of it. I can’t remember ever hearing it {{in the office and}} only really see it used online for the most part. I think the term really came into vogue when the Ultimate Universe came into prominence, but in my world, the language and distinctions are simple, there is the Marvel Universe and the Ultimate Universe. Anything other than <b>that</b> reeks <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> DC Earth 1, Earth 2, Earth Prime stuff which I’ve never really taken to, but then again, I got into DC when they got rid <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff</b> so it was from and for a different era than my own.|$|R
5000|$|The then Conservative Party Chairman, Grant Shapps MP, also defended Bashir. When {{questioned}} about Bashir's defection {{at a press}} conference in Westminster, Shapps said [...] "I can't believe that cynical hacks are believing this stuff to be honest. What happened is to be clear: they (Ukip) were perfectly content with him, they had him in the diary for last weekend for a Ukip rally. They had him in the diary for this weekend, as I mentioned, for another Ukip rally. Farage has been out and defended him on really their key accusation — and then they get wind of this defection and suddenly they rush out <b>of</b> the door <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stuff</b> <b>that's</b> already been there for years. It's pretty desperate stuff to be perfectly honest".|$|R

In November 2004 Cavaleri reflected on his early career [...] "When I was doing <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff</b> (it) doesn't even feel like it was my life ... It feels like a haze. It feels like a dream. It just feels like images in the head, almost like a western movie." [...] Cavaleri was managed by Jane Barnes (wife of Jimmy Barnes) and, with his parents, he decided to pause his musical career - he finished secondary school and became a brickie's labourer [...] "I just totally escaped music ... It can be a dark time when you’re finding yourself creatively." ...|$|E
5000|$|Because of {{the studio}} {{attitude}} toward child actors of the time, Herbert had {{a keen interest in}} the child actors of today. [...] "I lost a lot more than the financial things. Financial things are way down the list for me. The way it’s set up in Hollywood is, I did 50 TV shows, the 20 movies, the commercials, <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>stuff...</b> and when I turned 21, zero had been put away in the bank for me. It was not that way for every actor: If you signed a long-term contract--for instance, if you did Lassie or The Donna Reed Show or something--they put away like 5 percent for you. But if you were not on a long-term contract, ALL of the money you earned for the movies, for ALL the TV things, went to your guardians; and your guardians could do with it whatever they saw fit." [...] The only money put away for Herbert until age 21 from his TV and film earnings was $1,700.|$|E
5000|$|During an {{interview}} with etalk that same month, Azalea commented while talking about her upcoming album, [...] "My first single has no feature on it which was my number one goal, to try to achieve a song which was strong without needing somebody else to sing it." [...] "It was good {{to get back to}} doing a song where I only had to consider myself when creating," [...] elaborating later on how her experience influenced the making of the track, [...] "If I'm gonna have everyone try to come at me, then I have to support my own self and I have to be strong on my own and I don't need <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> extra <b>stuff.</b> I'm just gonna rock it myself." [...] On 14 March, she continued teasing the track on Twitter posting another preview addressing: [...] "Kylie Jenner, we know you're technically a Jenner, but you're still a Kardashian in our hearts," [...] with the pun lyrics, [...] "Watch a new car dash/ Call me Kylie." [...] On March 18, a [...] "dance video" [...] for [...] "Team" [...] was uploaded on Azalea's Vevo channel and the song became available for digital download on iTunes.

5000|$|Avant is a Christian. Avant {{has spoken}} about his faith saying [...] "I devoted {{my life to}} Jesus Christ on May 4, 2003. It was a day when, {{if you can imagine}} it, your eyes are opened to a whole {{different}} light. On that day, I had a consciousness <b>of</b> God <b>that</b> I never really had before. It’s sort of like being in darkness, but you finally start to see. I realized <b>that</b> day <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> I learned growing up was backwards, according to the Scripture. It was the day that changed my life. I started realizing that I had a purpose, and every thought from that day on went through a filter of Jesus Christ first.

5000|$|In February 2015, while {{promoting}} his newest film, Chappie, director Neil Blomkamp expressed some regrets regarding Elysium, commenting: [...] "I feel like I fucked it up, I feel like ultimately {{the story is}} not the right story.. I still think the satirical idea of a ring, filled with rich people, hovering above the impoverished Earth, is an awesome idea. I love it so much, I almost {{want to go back and}} do it correctly. But I just think the script wasn’t… I just didn’t make a good enough film is ultimately what it is. I feel like I executed <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> could be executed, like costume and set design and special effects very well. But, ultimately, it was all resting on a somewhat not totally formed skeletal system, so the script just wasn’t there; the story wasn’t fully there." ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{asked about}} Finn's {{character}} traits, Boyega replied, I think {{the element of}} having {{to step up to}} a bigger calling, when your circumstances don't particularly reflect that.

I feel like it's the same kind of journey that Finn has when he leaves the First Order. He leaves a curriculum, he leaves a system and embarks on his own journey. He also noted that initially [...] "most of his decisions are based on adrenaline. Like, 'Okay, you know what? I'm just going to get this blaster and run away.'&thinsp;" [...] Boyega further noted that [...] "not only is the character in over his head and someone who is just dropped into an extraordinary circumstance, the scenes and the script prove that and it's not a problem that can just be erased." ...|$|E

5000|$|Three 6 Mafia member DJ Paul {{spoke about}} the feud saying “It wasn’t a real beef,” DJ Paul says. “It {{was more of a}} {{misunderstanding}} because we was rapping about triple six, devil shit, and tongue twisting over slow beats. We had been doing that since 1989 {{and then all of a}} sudden when Bone came out—I think it was 1993… We didn’t know the Faces Of Death album because it was their underground stuff.

But there was never no fight or nothing like that.” DJ Paul continued “After a while we became cool,” he says. “Our first song was with Krayzie Bone on Project Pat’s Ghetty Green album maybe in 1997 or 1998 or something like that. We’ve been cool ever since then. We’re actually talking about doing a tour together soon. We did some shows together. They was fun as fuck. We had a blast with Bone.” ...|$|E

Although Joel Schumacher had seen the Broadway play before writing the script, none of the Broadway play's writing was incorporated into the film's.|$|R
2500|$|Due to Halo being a first-person shooter, {{significant}} {{emphasis was}} put into the design of human weaponry. The chief designer for human weapons was Robt McLees, {{who at the time}} of Combat Evolveds development was the only staff member at Bungie with knowledge of firearms; McLees {{wanted to make sure that}} the weapons looked [...] "cool", but were also grounded by real-world physics and considerations. The game designers also [...] wanted items that would be recognizable to players, yet futuristic-looking enough to plausibly exist in Halos 2552. In an interview, McLees noted that after human weapons had been vetted and the rough design worked out, [...] "I went ahead and built the highest-res LOD (level of detail) – and this is where I get [...] "bogged down" [...] with <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stuff</b> <b>that</b> [...] "nobody cares about" [...] like correct barrel diameter, placement of safeties, sights, magazine release buttons, and making sure that the magazines are actually large enough to hold all the bullets they're supposed to, that they would feed correctly and that the casings eject out of the correct side of the gun." [...] Occasionally, technical restraints forced design changes; the submachine gun introduced in Halo 2 originally featured a transparent magazine which allowed players to see the caseless ammo feed into the gun, but it proved too ambitious given the time and hardware available.|$|R
