5|$|The Pranotasani Tantra narrates {{that once}} Parvati longed {{to go back}} to her {{maternal}} house for some days and asked Shiva's permission to do so. The reluctant Shiva agreed on the condition that if she did not return in a few days, he would come to fetch her. Parvati agreed and went to her father Himalaya's place, where she stayed for many days. The lovesick Shiva went to Himalaya's abode disguised as an ornament seller and sold shell ornaments to Parvati. In order to test her fidelity, the disguised Shiva asked for sex in return. The disgusted Parvati was about to curse the ornament-seller, when she realizes by her yogic powers that it was none other than Shiva. She agrees to grant sexual favours but at the appropriate time. In the evening, Parvati returns to Shiva's abode disguised as a Chandala huntress. She is dressed in red and had a lean figure and large breasts and performs a seductive dance to lure him. She told Shiva that she had come to do penance. Shiva replied that he is the one gives fruit to all penance <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> and kissed her. Further, they made love when Shiva himself changed into a Chandala and recognized the Chandala woman as his wife. After the love-making, Parvati asked Shiva to grant her wish that her form as a Chandalini (the Chandala female form in which Shiva made love to her) might last forever as Ucchishta-Chandalini and that her worship in this form precede his for his worship to be considered fruitful. This tale is also found in many Bengali Mangalkavyas. In these texts, however, Parvati is not explicitly identified with Matangi.|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Gradgrind {{had drawn}} his chair a little nearer to <b>her,</b> <b>and</b> <b>taken</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> But, <b>her</b> {{repetition}} {{of these words}} seemed to strike with some little discord on his ear.

60|$|She {{stood before}} me with {{flashing}} eyes, her face glowing with enthusiasm; then I also rose {{to my feet}} <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> in mine, for I was intoxicated with her loveliness and almost ready to throw all restraints to the winds.|$|R

Grace: is this your first love affair? ...|$|R

6000|$|She {{looked like}} a Queen stooping to plead. My love for her grew and grew. I stood up beside her; <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> and said: ...|$|E
