One of the requirements for good practice in modelling is appropriate <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>rates</b> and probabilities. In spite of previous descriptions of appropriate use of rates and probabilities, confusions persist beyond a simple understanding of their definitions. The objective {{of this article is to}} provide a concise guide to understanding the issues surrounding the use of rates and probabilities reported in the literature in economic models, and an understanding of when and how to transform them appropriately. The article begins by defining rates and probabilities and shows the essential difference between the two measures. Appropriate conversions between rates and probabilities are discussed, and simple examples are provided to illustrate the techniques and pitfalls. How the transformed rates and probabilities may be used in economic models is then described and some recommendations are suggested. Modelling...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This study {{estimated}} {{the amount of}} nitrogen taken up by spring triticale from different sources depending on varied nitrogen fertilization and the development phase when the previous crop – yellow lupine was harvested. Lupine was cultivated in three fertilization variants: without nitrogen fertilization and after the <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>rates</b> 30 kg·ha- 1 N and 150 kg·ha- 1 N. Lupine harvest was performed in full flowering and full maturity phases. At the first harvest time, the whole biomass was introduced into soil. At the second time, seeds were collected and {{the other parts of}} lupine were introduced into soil. Spring triticale as a successive crop was cultivated without additional fertilization with nitrogen and harvested in the full maturity phase. Ammonium sulfite enriched in nitrogen 15 N isotope was used in the study as well as the method of isotopic dilution. The highest yield of grain and the whole biomass as well as the total amount of nitrogen taken up by triticale were obtained after the application under lupine of 150 kg·ha- 1 N. Yields and nitrogen uptake by triticale were higher when the previous crop was harvested in flowering than in full maturity. Nitrogen content in triticale grain and biomass was not dependent on the harvest phase and nitrogen fertilization of the previous crop. Proportio...|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of medicinal plants {{as raw material}} for industry must associate quality with biomass formation and, with this purpose, the application of plant growth regulators has been studied in these crops. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of a biostimulant on growth, inflorescence production and flavonoid content in marigold. The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse and the treatments consisted of increasing doses of the biostimulant (0, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 mL L- 1) applied by foliar spraying in ten consecutive applications. The experiment was arranged in a completely randomized design, with six treatments and ten repetitions. The number of leaves and flowerheads and dry matter of roots increased linearly with increasing doses of the growth promoter, with 20 %, 36. 97 % and 97. 28 % increases, respectively, compared with the control. The total dry mass and shoot dry mass showed maximum values at the highest dose tested of 15 mL L- 1 (with increases of 40. 09 % and 46. 30 %, respectively). Plant height and flavonoid content reached the highest values at a dose of 6 mL L- 1. The biostimulant promoted the development of marigold and positively influenced the synthesis of the secondary compound of medicinal interest.

40|$|A integração lavoura-pecuária (ILP) tem sido uma prática que, quando bem manejada e associada ao sistema plantio direto (PD), aumenta a qualidade do solo. Todavia, a maioria dos solos brasileiros apresenta baixa fertilidade natural de fósforo (P). Desta forma, o desenvolvimento de estratégias que aumentem a eficiência de uso de fertilizantes fosfatados possibilita um agronegócio mais sustentável do ponto de vista agronômico e econômico. Os objetivos desse estudo foram avaliar o acúmulo de P e o rendimento das culturas de milho, soja, aveia preta e azevém anual adubados com fontes e doses de P 2 O 5 na ILP em PD. Ainda, avaliar a biodisponibilidade de P para a cultura do milho, extraído pelos métodos de Melich- 1 (M 1), Resina trocadora de íons (RTI) e Morgan modificado (MM), após 36 meses de experimentação. O experimento foi instalado em abril/ 2009, no município de Castro-PR em um Cambissolo Háplico textura muito argilosa. Foi empregado delineamento em blocos ao acaso em esquema fatorial incompleto (3 x 3 + 1) com quatro repetições. Os tratamentos consistiram na aplicação {{superficial}} (em área total) de doses (0, 60, 120 e 180 kg ha- 1 ano- 1 de P 2 O 5) por ocasião da semeadura da forrageira de inverno (aveia preta ou azevém anual), nas formas de superfosfato triplo (SFT), fosfato natural reativo (FNR) e termofosfato magnesiano (TFM). Foram avaliados os rendimentos de massa seca da aveia preta (2009 e 2011) e azevém anual (2010), de grãos de milho (2009 / 10 e 2011 / 12) e soja (2010 / 11), e o acúmulo de P nessas culturas. Aos 36 meses de estudo, foram coletadas amostras de solo das camadas de 0 - 5, 5 - 10, 10 - 15 e 15 - 20 cm, para determinação das concentrações de P disponível pelos diferentes métodos extratores (M 1, RTI e MM) e, para avaliação da disponibilidade de P para a cultura do milho (2011 / 12). O uso de SFT, por ocasião da semeadura da aveia preta proporcionou maior rendimento de massa seca total (MST) e acúmulo de P na MST (P-MST) nesta cultura. No entanto, para a cultura do milho, os tratamentos não influenciaram o rendimento de grãos (RG) e acúmulo de P na parte área (P-Ac), no primeiro ano de uso. Os tratamentos não influenciaram o rendimento de MST do azevém anual e o RG de soja no segundo ano de avaliação. Porém, houve maior acúmulo de P-MST do azevém anual mediante aplicação de TFM e, para a soja, o P-Ac foi maior nos tratamentos com aplicação antecipada de SFT e TFM. A aplicação de TFM por ocasião da semeadura da aveia preta proporcionou maior rendimento de MST e P-MST nesta cultura, e também, maior RG e P-Ac no milho, no terceiro ano de estudo. A RTI extraiu maiores quantidades de P disponível, seguida do extrator de M 1 e do MM. Nos tratamentos que receberam aplicação de SFT, os extratores de M 1 e RTI obtiveram eficiência semelhante quando correlacionados com os atributos de RMS, RG, P-MS e P-Ex do milho. Para as fontes insolúveis em água (FNR e TFM), o P extraído pela RTI melhor se correlacionou com o P-MS e o P-Ex. A solução de MM foi ineficiente para prever a biodisponibilidade de P para o milho, cultivado em solo com alto teor de argila e óxidos de ferro e alumínio, que recebeu a aplicação de doses e fontes de P, em um sistema de ILP em PD. Crop-livestock integration (CLI) is {{a practice}} that, when properly managed and associated with no-tillage (NT), has been improving a soil quality. However, most of soils in Brazil {{have a low}} level of phosphorus (P). Thus, the development of strategies to increase phosphorus use efficiency has been crucial for sustainable agribusiness in an agronomic and economic viewpoint. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the accumulation of P and yields of corn, soybean, black oat and ryegrass fertilized with sources and levels of P 2 O 5 in CLI under NT and to evaluate the bioavailability of P for maize, extracted by the methods Melich- 1 (M 1), ion exchange resin (IER) and modified Morgan (MM), after 36 months of experimentation. The experiment was established in April 2009, in the municipality of Castro-PR in a Dystric Cambisol and the experimental design was an incomplete factorial (3 x 3 + 1), with four replications. The treatments consisted in surface (total area) application of levels (0, 60, 120 and 180 kg ha- 1 yr- 1 P 2 O 5) during sowing of winter forage (black oat or annual ryegrass) in the form of triple superphosphate (TSP), reactive rock phosphate (RRP) and magnesium termophosphate (MTP). The dry matter yields for black oat (2009 and 2011) and ryegrass (2010), grain yield for maize (2009 / 10 and 2011 / 12) and soybean (2010 / 11), and P accumulation were evaluated in these crops. In 36 months of study, soil samples were collected from the layers 0 - 5, 5 - 10, 10 - 15 and 15 - 20 cm, to determine the concentrations of available P by different methods extractants (M 1, IER and MM) and to assess the availability of P for maize (2011 / 12). The use of TSP, during sowing of black oat occasioned the highest yield of dry matter (DM) and P accumulation in DM (P-DM) in this crop. However, for the maize crop, the treatments did not affect grain yield (GY) and P accumulation in plant (P-Ac) at the first year of use. The treatments did not affect the yield of DM annual ryegrass and GY of soybean, in the second year of assessment. However, there was a greater accumulation of P-DM in the annual ryegrass, when applying MTP. For soybeans, the P-Ac was higher in the treatments with early application of TSP and MTP. The application of MTP during sowing of black oat occasioned the highest yield of DM and P-DM in this crop. The GY and P-Ac were higher in maize, occasioned by the use TFM, in the third year of study. Concentrations of available P in soil after 36 months of study, had variations according to each extractor. The ion exchange resin extracted greater amounts of P, followed by the extractor M 1 and MM. In the treatments that received application of TSP, the M 1 and IER extractants has obtained similar efficiency when correlated with the maizes attributes (DMY, GY, P-DM and P-Ex). IER was the most efficient extractor which correlated with the P-DM and P-Ex when were applied sources insoluble in water (RRP and MTP). The MM extractor was ineffective to predicting the bioavailability of P for the maize grown in a soil with high content of clay and Fe and Al oxides, which received the <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>rates</b> and sources of P in a CLI system under NT...|$|E

Even though streams are fundamentally dynamic, we find two essential concepts <b>of</b> stream <b>rate</b> control — throughput ratio and natural rate — are intimately related to the program structure itself and can be effectively reasoned about by a type system. RATE TYPES is proven sound over a time-aware and parallelism-aware operational semantics.
