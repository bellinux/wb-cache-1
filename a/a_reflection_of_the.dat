Black reviews the videotape, finding <b>a</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> killer in a glass pane.

5|$|Davis led a septet at the concert; saxophonist Sonny Fortune, bassist Michael Henderson, and guitarist Pete Cosey {{were given}} space to improvise against a dense {{backdrop}} of riffs, electronic effects, cross-beats, and funk grooves from the rhythm section—drummer Al Foster, guitarist Reggie Lucas, and percussionist James Mtume. Davis controlled their rhythmic and musical direction with hand and head gestures, phrases played on his wah-wah processed trumpet, and drones from an accompanying electronic organ. The evolving {{nature of the}} performance led to the widespread misunderstanding {{that it had no}} compositional basis, while its dark, angry, and somber musical qualities were seen as <b>a</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> musician's emotional and spiritual state at the time.|$|E

Steven Plunkett suggests that the founding of Gipeswic took place under Wuffingas supervision. It took another hundred years for the settlement to develop into a town, but its beginnings can be seen as <b>a</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> personal importance of Rædwald during the period of his supremacy.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th century AD, the French Port-Royal Grammarians {{developed}} {{the idea that}} the grammars of all languages were <b>a</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> universal basics of thought, and therefore that grammar was universal. In the 18th century, the first use of the comparative method by British philologist and expert on ancient India William Jones sparked the rise of comparative linguistics. The scientific study of language was broadened from Indo-European to language in general by Wilhelm von Humboldt. Early in the 20th century, Ferdinand de Saussure introduced the idea of language as a static system of interconnected units, defined through the oppositions between them.|$|E

5|$|At {{the outset}} of his reign, Caracalla {{declared}} divine support for Egyptian deity Serapisa god of healing. The Iseum et Serapeum in Alexandria was apparently renovated during Caracalla's co-rule with his father Septimius Severus. The evidence for this exists in two inscriptions found near the temple that appear to bear their names. Additional archaeological evidence exists for this {{in the form of}} two papyrii that have been dated to the Severan period and also two statues associated with the temple that have been dated to around 200AD. Upon Caracalla's ascension to sole ruler in 212, the imperial mint began striking coins bearing Serapis' image. This was <b>a</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> god's central role during Caracalla's reign. After Geta's death, the weapon that had killed him was dedicated to Serapis by Caracalla. This was most likely done to cast Serapis into the role of Caracalla's protector from treachery.|$|E

5|$|Folklorist Gary R. Varner has {{suggested}} that the origin of the belief in water horses that preyed on and devoured humans may be <b>a</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human sacrifices once made to appease the gods of water. The association with horses may have its roots in horse sacrifices performed in ancient Scandinavia. Stories of malevolent water spirits served the practical purpose of keeping children away from perilous areas of water, and of warning adolescent women to be wary of attractive young strangers. The stories were also used to enforce moral standards, as they implied that the creatures took retribution for bad behaviour carried out on Sundays. The intervention of demons and spirits was possibly a way to rationalise the drowning of children and adults who had accidentally fallen into deep, fast flowing or turbulent water.|$|E
5|$|In Shahîd's judgment, the {{imprecision}} and unemphatic tone of Eusebius' passage at 6.34 is {{the major}} cause {{of the lack of}} scholarly consensus on Philip's Christianity. To Shahîd, Eusebius' wording choice is a reflection of his own lack of enthusiasm for Philip's Christianity, which is in turn <b>a</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> special position Constantine held in his regards and in his written work. A number of scholars, following E. Schwartz, believe the later editions of Eusebius' Historia to have been extensively revised to adapt to the deterioration of Licinius in the public memory (and official damnatio memoriae) after Constantine deposed and executed him in 324–25. Passages of the Historia incompatible with Licinius' denigration were suppressed, and an account of the last years of his life was replaced with a summary of the Council of Nicaea. Shahîd suggests that, in addition to these anti-Licinian deletions, Eusebius also edited out favorable notices on Philip to better glorify Constantine's achievement.|$|E
5|$|Obama's {{inaugural address}} {{received}} mixed reviews, with some describing {{the tone of}} the speech a praiseworthy one of restraint and plain speaking, while others described the speech as low-brow and cliched. Despite his optimism, Obama was critical of former Presidents GeorgeW. Bush and BillClinton. David E. Sanger, chief Washington correspondent for The New York Times, described the speech as the harshest rebuke of an outgoing President during an inaugural address since Franklin Roosevelt's call for restoration of American values. The Bush administration was upset about {{the tone of the}} speech, saying that the speech veered from that of a ritualistic but respectful thanks to that of a public diatribe. Members of the Republican party viewed the speech as a missed chance to seek unity, while Rahm Emanuel, Obama's White House Chief of Staff, described the speech as <b>a</b> <b>reflection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mandate of the people. In an analysis of the inaugural address, one reporter described the speech as one that emphasized the burdens of the moment and the cloudy future whose challenges may be met with the resolve that is part of our American heritage.|$|E
