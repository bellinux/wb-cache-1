5|$|Although the camas {{pocket gopher}} is {{fiercely}} defensive when cornered, {{it may become}} tame in captivity. While population trends are generally stable, threats to the species' survival include urbanization, habitat conversion for agricultural use and active attempts at eradication with trapping and poisons. It is prey for raptors and carnivorous mammals, <b>and</b> <b>host</b> to several parasitic arthropods and worms. Scientists believe that the gopher's evolutionary history was disrupted when the Missoula Floods washed over the Willamette Valley {{at the end of}} the last ice age. The floods almost completely inundated its geographic range, which may have caused a genetic bottleneck as survivors repopulated the region after the waters receded.|$|E

5|$|Envelope: Some {{species of}} virus envelop {{themselves}} in a modified form {{of one of the}} cell membranes, either the outer membrane surrounding an infected host cell or internal membranes such as nuclear membrane or endoplasmic reticulum, thus gaining an outer lipid bilayer known as a viral envelope. This membrane is studded with proteins coded for by the viral genome <b>and</b> <b>host</b> genome; the lipid membrane itself and any carbohydrates present originate entirely from the host. The influenza virus and HIV use this strategy. Most enveloped viruses are dependent on the envelope for their infectivity.|$|E

5|$|Ethernet {{standards}} require {{electrical isolation}} between the networked device (computer, phone, etc.) {{and the network}} cable up to 1500VAC or 2250VDC for 60seconds.

This gives Ethernet a significant safety advantage over USB with peripherals such as cable and DSL modems connected to external wiring that can assume hazardous voltages under certain fault conditions.|$|E

5|$|Some teleosts are parasites.
