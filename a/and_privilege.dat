5|$|Biko saw white {{racism in}} South Africa as {{the totality of}} the white power structure. He argued that under apartheid, white people not only participated in the oppression of black people but were also the main voices in {{opposition}} to that oppression. He thus argued that in dominating both the apartheid system and the anti-apartheid movement, white people totally controlled the political arena, leaving black people marginalised. He believed white people were able to dominate the anti-apartheid movement because of their access to resources, education, <b>and</b> <b>privilege.</b> He noted that white South Africans were poorly suited to this role because they had not personally experienced the oppression that their black counterparts faced.|$|E

He has shown an interest in supporting charitable organisations, primarily those addressing the needs of children with disabilities. In December 2009, Nicholas suffered serious spinal injuries in a horse riding accident. He crushed his vertebrae in the fall. While he experienced initial paralysis necessitating the use of a wheelchair, physical therapy has helped restore his health {{to the point where he}} is able to walk, with limitations. With continued rehabilitation, doctors expect a full recovery.|$|E

5|$|The Macedonian {{king was}} an autocratic figure {{at the head}} of both {{government}} and society, with arguably unlimited authority to handle affairs of state and public policy, but he was also the leader of a very personal regime with close relationships or connections to his hetairoi, the core of the Macedonian aristocracy. These aristocrats were second only to the king in terms of power <b>and</b> <b>privilege,</b> filling the ranks of his administration and serving as commanding officers in the military. It was in the more bureaucratic regimes of the Hellenistic kingdoms that succeeded Alexander the Great's empire where greater social mobility for members of society seeking to join the aristocracy could be found, especially in Ptolemaic Egypt. Although governed by a king and martial aristocracy, Macedonia seems to have lacked the widespread use of slaves seen in contemporaneous Greek states.|$|E

40|$|Provides an {{extensive}} survey of current Commonwealth laws that limit traditional rights, freedoms <b>and</b> <b>privileges,</b> considers how such laws may be justified, and seeks {{feedback from the}} public. Overview This is the 2 nd consultation document for this Inquiry. The ALRC was asked to review Commonwealth laws that encroach on traditional rights, freedoms <b>and</b> <b>privileges</b> (Freedoms Inquiry). Traditional rights include such fundamental freedoms as freedom of speech, religion, movement and association; and other important rights <b>and</b> <b>privileges</b> such as property rights, client legal privilege, {{the right to a}} fair trial, and access to the courts, to name a few. The Terms of Reference list 19 such rights, freedoms <b>and</b> <b>privileges</b> to consider. In the Interim Report, the ALRC discusses the source and rationale of these important common law rights, freedoms <b>and</b> <b>privileges,</b> <b>and</b> discusses how they have been protected by the Constitution, the Parliament and the courts. The Interim Report also provides {{an extensive}} survey of current Commonwealth laws that limit traditional rights, freedoms <b>and</b> <b>privileges</b> <b>and</b> considers how such laws may be justified. The ALRC invites submissions in response to this Interim Report and, in particular, submissions identifying Commonwealth laws that warrant further review. The closing date for submissions is  21 September 2015.   Find out more about making submissions here...|$|R

25|$|Greek letter {{organizations}} {{have often been}} characterized as elitist or exclusionary associations, organized {{for the benefit of}} a largely white, upper-class membership base. Members of fraternities and sororities disproportionately come from certain socio-economic demographics, which perpetuates an unhealthy divisiveness within the student body based on ethnicity and income and a perpetuation of patterns of exclusivity <b>and</b> <b>privilege.</b> Fraternities specifically have been criticized for what is perceived as their promotion of an excessively alcohol-fueled, party-focused lifestyle.|$|E
25|$|Armstrong {{was largely}} {{accepted}} into white society, both {{on stage and}} off, a privilege reserved for very few African-American public figures, and usually those of either exceptional talent or fair skin tone. As his fame grew, so did his access to the finer things in life usually denied to African-Americans, even famous ones. It was a power <b>and</b> <b>privilege</b> that he enjoyed, although he was {{very careful not to}} flaunt it with fellow performers of color, and privately, he shared what access that he could with friends and fellow musicians.|$|E

25|$|The {{end of the}} {{genocide}} resulted in {{the election of a}} Tutsi government—the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF). This shift in power provided the minority Tutsi with access to power <b>and</b> <b>privilege,</b> completely shifting social conceptions. Attempts to re-build the war-torn country focused on eclipsing identity for fear that retaliation and punishment towards the Hutus would occur. The government’s agenda thus was to reduce identity to that of just being “Rwandan”. In this post-genocide society, identity was supposedly re-conceptualized to divert the emphasis from ethnicity to a division of the population into categories of victim, victors, survivors, and perpetrators.|$|E
25|$|The Twelve Traditions {{encourage}} {{members to}} practice the spiritual principle of anonymity in the public media and members are also asked to respect each others' confidentiality. This is a group norm, however, and not legally mandated; there are no legal consequences to discourage those attending twelve-step groups from revealing information disclosed during meetings. Statutes on group therapy do not encompass those associations that lack a professional therapist or clergyman to whom confidentiality <b>and</b> <b>privilege</b> might apply. Professionals and paraprofessionals who refer patients to these groups, to avoid both civil liability and licensure problems, have been advised that they should alert their patients that, at any time, their statements made in meetings may be disclosed.|$|E
25|$|Other {{communities}} of Pashto speakers {{are found in}} Tajikistan, and further in the Pashtun diaspora. There are also Hindu and Muslim {{communities of}} part Pashtun descent in India, including Bollywood families and Indian Film Cinema such as Khans and Kapoors. They are integrated into Indian languages, hold mixed races, ethnicities, religions and culture and do not hold cultural reverence to the ethnicity or their origins.Though Pashtuns are Iranian origin, the intermixing of foreign armies, races, and south-asian royalty has {{made it difficult to}} determine their true origins. There is a significant difference in Pashtuns from Afghanistan, Pakistan and other mixed diaspora depending on who they came in contact with, and by status <b>and</b> <b>privilege.</b>|$|E

25|$|Third-wave {{feminism}} harmonizes {{the thoughts}} that while individuals have rights, overarching inequalities hinder women's capabilities. Third-wave feminism also considers {{that women who}} are trafficked and face oppression do not all face {{the same kinds of}} oppression. For example, third-wave feminist proponent Shelley Cavalieri identifies oppression <b>and</b> <b>privilege</b> in the intersections of race, class, and gender. Women from low socioeconomic class, generally from the Global South, face inequalities that differ from those of other sex trafficking victims. Therefore, it advocates for catering to individual trafficking victim because sex trafficking is not monolithic, and therefore there is not a one-size-fits-all intervention. This also means allowing individual victims to tell their unique experiences rather than essentializing all trafficking experiences. Lastly, third-wave feminism promotes increasing women's agency both generally and individually, so that they have the opportunity to act on their own behalf.|$|E
25|$|Hamilton Rowan {{returned}} to Ireland in his thirties, in 1784, {{to live at}} Rathcoffey near Clane in north County Kildare. He became a celebrity and, despite his wealth <b>and</b> <b>privilege,</b> a strong advocate for Irish liberty. He joined the Killyleagh Volunteers (a militia group later associated with radical reform) under his father's command, also in 1784. Hamilton Rowan first gained public attention by championing the cause of fourteen-year-old Mary Neal in 1788. Neal had been lured into a Dublin brothel and then assaulted by Lord Carhampton. Hamilton Rowan publicly denounced Carhampton and published a pamphlet A Brief Investigation of the Sufferings of John, Anne, and Mary Neal in the same year. An imposing figure at more than six feet tall, Hamilton Rowan's notoriety grew when he entered a Dublin dining club threatening several of Mary Neal's detractors, with his massive Newfoundland at his side, and a shillelagh in hand. The incident won him public applause and celebrity {{as a champion of}} the poor.|$|E
25|$|Other public festivals {{were not}} {{required}} by the calendar, but occasioned by events. The triumph of a Roman general was celebrated as the fulfillment of religious vows, though these tended to be overshadowed by {{the political and social}} significance of the event. During the late Republic, the political elite competed to outdo each other in public display, and the ludi attendant on a triumph were expanded to include gladiator contests. Under the Principate, all such spectacular displays came under Imperial control: the most lavish were subsidised by emperors, and lesser events were provided by magistrates as a sacred duty <b>and</b> <b>privilege</b> of office. Additional festivals and games celebrated Imperial accessions and anniversaries. Others, such as the traditional Republican Secular Games to mark a new era (saeculum), became imperially funded to maintain traditional values and a common Roman identity. That the spectacles retained something of their sacral aura even in late antiquity is indicated by the admonitions of the Church Fathers that Christians should not take part.|$|E
