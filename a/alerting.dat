40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} {{to what extent}} clustering of related drug interaction <b>alerts</b> (drug-drug and drug-disease interaction <b>alerts)</b> would decrease the <b>alert</b> rate in clinical decision support systems (CDSSs). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of drug interaction <b>alerts</b> generated by CDSSs in community pharmacies. Frequently generated combinations of <b>alerts</b> were analyzed for associations in a 5 % random data sample (dataset 1). <b>Alert</b> combinations with similar management recommendations were defined as clusters. The <b>alert</b> rate was assessed by simulating a CDSS generating 1 <b>alert</b> per cluster per patient instead of separate <b>alerts.</b> The simulation was performed in dataset 1 and replicated in another 5 % data sample (dataset 2). RESULTS: Data were extracted from the CDSSs of 123 community pharmacies. Dataset 1 consisted of 841 [*] 572 dispensed prescriptions and 298 [*] 261 drug interaction <b>alerts.</b> Dataset 2 was comparable. Twenty-two frequently occurring <b>alert</b> combinations were identified. Analysis of these associated <b>alert</b> combinations for similar management recommendations resulted in 3 clusters (related to renal function, electrolytes, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases). Using the clusters in <b>alert</b> generation reduced the <b>alert</b> rate within these clusters by 53 - 70 %. The overall number of drug interaction <b>alerts</b> was reduced by 11 % in dataset 1 and by 12 % in dataset 2. This corresponds to a decrease of 21 <b>alerts</b> per pharmacy per day. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Using clusters of drug interaction <b>alerts</b> with similar management recommendations in CDSSs can substantially decrease the overall <b>alert</b> rate. Further {{research is needed to}} establish the applicability of this concept in daily practice...|$|R

Our objective was to apply human factors principles to creatinine clearance <b>alert</b> design and assess whether the redesigned <b>alerts</b> increase usability and reduce prescribing errors compared with the original <b>alerts.</b> Methods Twenty Veterans Affairs (VA) outpatient providers (14 physicians, 2 nurse practitioners, and 4 clinical pharmacists) completed 2 usability sessions in a counterbalanced study to evaluate original and redesigned <b>alerts.</b> Each session consisted of fictional patient scenarios with 3 medications that warranted prescribing changes because of renal impairment, each associated with creatinine clearance <b>alerts.</b> Quantitative and {{qualitative data were collected}} to assess <b>alert</b> usability and the occurrence of prescribing errors. Results There were 43 % fewer prescribing errors with the redesigned <b>alerts</b> compared with the original <b>alerts</b> (P =. 001). Compared with the original <b>alerts,</b> redesigned <b>alerts</b> significantly reduced prescribing errors for allopurinol and ibuprofen (85 % vs 40 % and 65 % vs 25 %, P =. 012 and P =. 008, respectively), but not for spironolactone (85 % vs 65 %). Nine providers (45 %) voiced confusion about why the <b>alert</b> was appearing when they encountered the original <b>alert</b> design.

While the need for mining critical <b>alerts</b> over large scale <b>alert</b> se-quences is evident, most <b>alert</b> analysis techniques stop at modeling and mining the causal relations among the <b>alerts.</b> This paper studies the critical <b>alert</b> mining problem: Given a set of <b>alert</b> sequences, we aim to find a set of k crit-ical <b>alerts</b> such that the number of <b>alerts</b> potentially trig-gered by them is maximized.

Moreover, we show a faster approximation ex-ists, when the <b>alerts</b> follow certain causal structure. Second, we propose two fast heuristic algorithms based on tree sam-pling techniques. On real-life data, these algorithms identify a critical <b>alert</b> from up to 270, 000 mined causal relations in 5 seconds; meanwhile, they preserve more than 80 % of so-lution quality, and are up to 5, 000 times faster than their approximation counterparts. 1...|$|R
