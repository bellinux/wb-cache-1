He became the assistant of Tsungming Tu, who was researching on basic medical studies and, at the time, the only Taiwanese professors in the medical department.

25|$|Having seen {{politicians}} like Lloyd George and Churchill run rings around Kitchener, Robertson’s {{policy was}} {{to present his}} professional advice <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>on</b> repeating it, flatly refusing to enter into debate, arguing {{that the government should}} accept his advice or else find another adviser. However, Robertson reduced the government’s freedom of action by cultivating the press, much of which argued that the professional leadership of Haig and Robertson was preferable to civilian interference which had led to disasters like Gallipoli and Kut. He was particularly close to H. A. Gwynne and Charles Repington, who worked for the Northcliffe Press until it ceased to support the generals late in 1917, and advised Haig to cultivate journalists also. Robertson communicated by secret letters and “R” telegrams to generals in the field, including Milne, whom he discouraged from offensive operations at Salonika, and Maude who may have “consciously or unconsciously” ignored his secret orders from Robertson not to attempt to take Baghdad.|$|E
500|$|When {{naming the}} company, Sundberg, Blomberg {{and the other}} {{employees}} brought {{up a list of}} military code words used during World War II. They ultimately decided upon [...] "Avalanche" [...] as the company's name. The company worked on a prototype project called Rico: Terror in the Tropics in 2003. The project, designed by Sundberg himself, would eventually become Avalanche's first title, Just Cause. He pitched the game's concept to publisher Eidos Interactive, which was accepted. According to Sundberg, he wanted to develop a game [...] "where you could skydive onto the roof of a car <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>on</b> going". The game was released in 2006 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360. Sundberg considered Just Cause to be the 'DNA' and 'center point of the studio', since it was the first game they developed.|$|E

[...] This discussion is included in Stages on Life's Way (1845).

Reznor {{went on to say}} that he hated Interscope, and in later years the [...] "climate" [...] of record labels may have an increasingly ambivalent impact on consumers who buy music. Reznor's post, specifically his criticism of the recording industry at large, elicited considerable media attention.

500|$|Takumi learns of the {{existence}} of people called [...] "gigalomaniacs", who can use special powers to project delusions onto others' minds; they can also project delusions into reality, which is referred to as [...] "real-booting". Takumi and several of the girls he met are revealed to be such individuals, and can use illusory [...] "Di-Sword" [...] weapons projected into reality. The Nozomi Group in Shibuya is revealed to have created a synthetic gigalomaniac machine called the Noah II, which they use for their own gain, causing people to panic from experiencing delusions. Takumi learns that he is an artificial delusional clone with fabricated memories, created by the real Takumi to stop the Nozomi Group from taking over humanity. He did this as his body had been aged from overuse of gigalomaniac powers, hindering him from stopping the Nozomi Group personally. Takumi reveals the nurse Hazuki as the criminal behind the murders by projecting her memories onto screens on buildings, and destroys the Noah II and Nozomi's president with his Di-Sword.
