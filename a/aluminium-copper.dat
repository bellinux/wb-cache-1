40|$|Aluminium alloys are {{frequently}} pre-treated by a conversion coating before application of an organic coating {{in order to}} improve the corrosion resistance and adhesive properties of the surface and the corrosion resistance provided by the system. Chromate-containing conversion coatings are commonly used for this purpose. However, legislation limits future use of hexavalent chromium compounds due to their toxic and carcinogenic nature. Therefore, alternative, so-called chromium-free conversion coatings are being developed that are more environmentally-compliant. The purpose of the present work has therefore been to contribute {{to a better understanding of}} how the aluminium substrate affects the formation and properties of conversion coatings for adhesive bonding. In particular, a chrome-free zirconium-based conversion treatment process has been investigated as a possible replacement for conventional chromate conversion treatment. The influence of the conversion time on the thickness of the formed layer on pure aluminium was investigated using complementary surface analytical techniques. The conversion time was varied between 30 and 600 seconds. In this study, the structure and composition of zirconium-based chromium-free conversion coatings on magnetron sputtered superpure aluminium and a range of <b>aluminium-copper</b> alloys were characterised as a function of immersion time in the aqueous conversion bath to understand the mechanism of coating formation and protection. However, the presence of copper significantly influences the coating development and ultimately the performance of the conversion coatings formed on binary copper-containing aluminium alloys. The morphology and composition of the coatings have been probed using transmission electron microscopy, Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy and glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy, with loss of substrate through growth of the conversion coating also quantified. A comparison of the RBS spectra obtained for the superpure aluminium specimens after different immersion times revealed that zirconium (Zr) and oxygen (O) peaks were wider for longer immersion times, indicating thickening of the coating with increased immersion times. Thus, increasing the immersion time resulted in an increase in coating thickness but little change in coating composition occurred as determined by the RBS RUMP simulations. Alloying decreases the coating thickness, as well as metal consumption. Here, aspects of the corrosion behaviour of superpure aluminium and <b>aluminium-copper</b> alloys were also considered using electronoptical, electrochemical and surface analytical probing. The influence that short and prolonged treatment times exert on the performances of such conversion coating is discussed. The conversion coating formed after 60 s and 180 s of immersion in the zirconium-based conversion coating bath provide good corrosion resistance which can be attributed to the high stability of the compounds that constitute the surface oxide layer, and good adhesion properties.

40|$|Several {{causes of}} tool wear have been {{investigated}} in dry machining of aluminium alloy with cemented carbide insert; {{some of the most}} important are: adhesion and diffusion. The formation of built-up edge (BUE) and adhesive layer on the tool rake face degrades on the one hand, the shape and efficiency of cutting tool and on the other hand, the surface quality and dimensional accuracy of the finished product. This paper describes tool wear mechanisms in dry machining of a usual <b>aluminium–copper</b> alloy (2024) with an uncoated cemented carbide tool (WC–Co). Orthogonal cutting tests were performed using an instrumented planer machine. The morphology of chips, cutting forces and contact lengths were analyzed for several cutting conditions. The tool–chip interface temperature and the average pressure were calculated by conducting calibration–cutting experiments in conjunction with FEM simulations. This allowed to define the contact parameters associated with different cutting conditions on the tool rake face. High-speed camera movies (CCD), white light interferometry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) were investigated to show the development of the built-up edge and the adhesive layer on the tool rake face during machining process.

The strength to weight ratio and other properties of these materials make them ideal materials for rivet design. Six different rivets were produced each using pure aluminium ingot, pure copper ingot and aluminium copper alloy {{and each of the}} rivet was used to join mild steel together using the same pressing force of 50 kN. Each of the joint was subjected to impact test to measure the amount of impact energy they can absorb before failure. The impact test analysis showed that copper rivets had the highest impact resistance as only partial failure occurred. Impact test analysis of aluminium rivet resulted in fracture, thereby making it a weak material for riveting when it comes to components that requires high loading force. Also, Al- 30 %Cu alloy has high impact resistance, but less than that pure copper.

The spin-lattice relaxation rate in the rotating frame, T 1 ρ^- 1 of 27 Al has been measured {{as a function of}} the plastic strain rate ε· at 77 K. For finite strain rates ε·, the movement of dislocations induces an additional relaxation rate arising from time fluctuations in the nuclear quadrupole interaction. From this motion-induced part of the relaxation rate the mean free path L of mobile dislocations can be calculated which is determined by the distribution of lattice defects acting as obstacles for moving dislocations. The NMR experiments are combined with transmission electron microscopic investigations to reveal the static structure of defects in the samples. Correlations between the in situ observed mean free path L of mobile dislocations and between the microscopic defect structure arising from the ageing process (θ’ phase, solid solution) and the degree of plastic deformation ε are shown. It turns out that in the θ’ phase at small strains L is determined by the microstructure and is equal to the mean separation between the precipitates. For large strains L is determined by the statistical distribution of the dislocation loops lying between the precipitates. On the other hand, in ultrapure aluminium L is determined by the dislocation cell structure. ...|$|E

40|$|This alloy was {{solution}} treated. Hardening {{is achieved}} by the controlled rejection of copper from a supersaturated solid solution. There is some additional hardening from precipitates such as MgSi 2. From the phase diagram for the pure <b>aluminium-copper</b> binary system, {{it can be seen}} that the solubility of copper in -aluminium increases with increasing temperature up to the eutectic temperature of about 550 °C. The equilibrium microstructure below the eutectic temperature is a two-phase mixture of -aluminium and the Al 2 Cu intermetallic phase (also known as θ phase). The initial solution heat treatment aims to obtain the maximum possible concentration of copper in solution. Rapid quenching from the solution temperature prevents the kinetically slow precipitation of, forming a highly supersaturated solid solution of copper. Rapid quenching also preserves the large number density of vacancies in the aluminium lattice from the high solution temperature. This increases copper diffusion rates at low temperature and accelerates ageing. Care must be taken with commercial alloys where the additional alloying elements reduce the eutectic temperature. This reduces the maximum solution heat treatment temperature since heating above the eutectic temperature causes the growth of a brittle intergranular eutectic. Ageing may occur at room temperature (Natural Ageing) or above (Artificial Ageing), and takes place via a sequence of precipitation reactions. At low temperatures, the sequence may not be completed even after very long times, whereas at high temperatures, where diffusion is rapid, the early stages may not be observed. The microstructure in this sample shows θ phase at high magnification. The crystallographic relationship between the precipitates and the aluminium lattice is apparent from the alignment of the precipitates. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Aluminium-copper</b> hybrid parts, as a {{substitution}} to copper parts, {{result in}} weight and cost reduction, and are relevant in applications {{related to the}} electronic, heating and cooling sector. However, aluminium to copper joined by thermal welding processes presents challenges in terms of achieving good joint quality. This is attributed to their dissimilar mechanical and thermal properties which result in large stress gradients during heating. This study investigated joining of aluminium to copper sheets by electromagnetic pulse welding, which is a solid-state process that uses electromagnetic forces for joining of dissimilar materials. Hybrid sheet welds were obtained for all parameters conditions, selected according to a Taguchi L 18 design. The structural and mechanical characteristics were examined and related to the welding parameters {{by means of a}} Pareto analysis and response graphs. The welded zone started with a wavy interface with interfacial layers and defects and evolved to a flat interface without interfacial layers. The maximum transferable force depended on the minimum specimen thickness and the strength of the hybrid sheet weld. In case of aluminium sheet thickness reduction, the maximum transferable force was linearly correlated with the aluminium sheet thickness. High quality joints were obtained for no aluminium sheet thickness reduction and for a sheet weld strength which was at least as high as that of the base material. The most effective way to increase the transferable force was to lower the initial gap and to increase the free length, which resulted in no aluminium sheet thickness reduction. Alternatively, the use of a rounded spacer decreased the effect of the aluminium sheet thickness on the transferable force. An increase in weld width was achieved for an increase in capacitor charging energy and gap, whereas an increase in weld length was obtained for a decrease in gap. An increase in weld width did not necessarily result in an increase in the transferable force. In the regarded cases, a hybrid sheet with narrow weld width could therefore have higher quality...|$|E

Fractography was undertaken on the failed fatigue specimens to assess the impact of ageing temperature and temperature exposure on fatigue behaviour. The L 169 alloy exhibited a significant reduction in properties following 1000 hours exposure at 205 °C due to extensive precipitate coarsening. The A 201 exhibited comparably better elevated temperature performance due to the increased stability of the Ω- phase precipitate however the extensive shrinkage porosity observed in the alloy had a negative impact on fatigue performance and will limit its use in a pressure tight environment. In addition to the investigation into currently commercially available alloys a detailed investigation was taken into a novel dilute <b>aluminium-copper</b> based castable metal matrix composite with the potential for use at elevated temperatures. This alloy exhibits unique solidification mechanisms which result in an increased resistance to conventional aluminium copper alloy casting defects such as shrinkage porosity, segregation and hot tearing. A detailed investigation was undertaken to assess the impact of chemical composition on the alloys unique solidification behaviour and to assess whether there was any possibility for further optimisation. Following on from this investigation the alloy was characterised in similar terms to the L 169 and A 201 alloys in terms of its fatigue behaviour at both ambient and elevated temperatures to provide an assessment of the alloys potential to meet the predicted next generation aero-engine component operating conditions...|$|E
40|$|Chapter I {{contains}} {{a summary of}} solidification theory, including theories of the interface processes in pure materials and alloys and applications of analytical diffusion treatments to complex solidification problems. Chapter II contains more detailed literature surveys related to the present work. Section (a) gives a summary of work on dendritic growth, spacing and segregation, including a collation of spacing data, to complement an earlier, more discursive review. (1) Section (b) gives an extensive discussion of theoretical and experimental studies of temperature gradient zone melting and similar migration phenomena. Section (c) is a summary of experimental studies using transparent organic analogues for metallic solidification as in the present work, while section (d) covers previous work (1) by the author. Literature surveys also appear in chapter IV(a) (dendrite tip shapes, effects of convection and the container surface), Chapter V(a) (interdendritic solidification models), chapter VIII(c) (theory of fibre coarsening) and chapter VIII(d) (temperature gradient zone melting during crystal growth.) Chapter III describes the temperature gradient stages for the optical microscope used in the experimental work of chapters IV and VII. A new type of stage was designed for fixed-area studies during solidification, in which the hot and cold plates were together driven across the stage while the specimen cell was held stationary in the microscope viewfield. Horizontal and vertical thermal gradients in specimen cells, with and without the plates moving, were measured with thermocouples and by observing temperature gradient zone melting. As a result, the apparatus was modified to reduce local convective heat losses, to control the heating plate temperatures and reduce heat transfer problems {{in order to make}} the thermal field reproducible, and to minimize vertical thermal gradients in cells. Some observations on optical perfection and image contrast are also presented. Chapter IV describes experimental studies on dendritic growth of succinonitrile and CBr 4 alloys in thin specimen cells using the above apparatus. The effects of constraint by the cell walls on growth direction were studied, partly to test the effectiveness of the technique in reproducing bulk dendritic growth features but also to investigate the crystallography of preferred dendritic growth direction. For a given material, dendritic growth form depended largely on grain orientation, and some orientations produced growth forms reasonably similar to bulk growth. There were, however, distinct differences between different alloys although all were cubic, non-faceting, with preferred growth direction [100]. Dendrite spacings and tip temperatures were also measured. There was clear evidence of the influence of convection on primary spacing. Growth temperature measurements were in reasonable agreement with theory. (51) Chapter V covers theoretical developments of established models of interdendritic solidification. Liquid-state diffusion is discussed in order to correct errors in earlier work and integrate the diffusion analysis with the more intuitive "complete mixing" (49) treatment of dendritic solidification. An analytical treatment (49) of solid-state diffusion is marginally improved and included in the analysis but found to remain quite inaccurate. Previous calculations on microsegregation in <b>aluminium-copper</b> alloys (103) are re-assessed, using self-consistency of the results to obtain a reliable estimate of the solid-state diffusion coefficient, and it is concluded that only one-quarter of the observed (104) homogenization during solidification can be explained by the solid-state diffusion model. Chapter VI describes theoretical work on temperature gradient zone melting. In previous work, the concentration gradient across a migrating region has generally been assumed, e. g. as linear. Such an assumption is not adequate to discuss TGZM during solidification. In this chapter, exact TGZM diffusion solutions are presented for special cases. These are then used to derive approximate solutions of wider validity. Besides describing TGZM during solidification, these solutions show serious faults in previous treatments of fibre coarsening by differential migration (124) (see also chap. VTII(c)), droplet shape distorsions, (144) and interface stability during TGZM. (129) Solid-state diffusion outside migrating zones and droplets is also analyzed: "forces" on migrating droplets and droplet shape distorsions and retardations during TGZM are discussed. An expression is given for the distance migrated during solidification by an interdendritic liquid pool. Chapter VII covers experimental studies of TGZM in organics. Migration of interdendritic liquid pools during solidification was shown experimentally to be similar to droplet migration in a static thermal gradient. Detailed observations of migration velocities as a function of droplet size in succinonitrile showed considerable variations at low temperatures. Possible explanations in terms of interface kinetics affected by adsorption, or dislocation dragging by migrating drops, are presented and discussed. Much smaller size dependences of migration velocity were obtained at higher temperature and these were satisfactorily explained in terms of the curvature effect alone. Grain boundaries in succinonitrile were sometimes observed to migrate up the temperature gradient like liquid drops, suggesting that they (and perhaps also dislocations) can behave as microscopic liquid zones. Some observations on gas bubbles and diffusion coefficient measurements in TGZM are also presented. Chapter VIII includes various applications of TGZM theory. The simplicity of the theory is used to advantage in calculating the purity required of a "pure" material in which phase transformations can be said to be "controlled" by heat flow rather than solute diffusion: a purity ≳ 99 - 99 % is obtained. It is shown that despite their very different thermal properties, organic materials remain good analogues for metals in this respect. The theory of chapter VI is shown not to invalidate theories (18) of interface kinetics in TGZM, but some special features of the melting kinetics are discussed. The theory (124) of fibre coarsening by differential migration is extensively amended but shown not to account for experimental observations satisfactorily. Using insights gained from the introduction of a dimensionless parameter unifying the theories of various solidification phenomena in a thermal gradient (chap. IV(e)), it is shown that droplets inside a crystal growing with a planar interface often migrate as fast as the crystal grows. Implications for high-quality crystal growth are discussed. Finally, some amendments and extensions to earlier work (1) on homogenization and coarsening by TGZM during dendritic solidification are presented. </p...|$|E
