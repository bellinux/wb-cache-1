5|$|A one-vertex crease pattern {{consists}} {{of a set of}} rays or creases drawn on a flat sheet of paper, all emanating from the same point interior to the sheet. (This point is called the vertex of the pattern.) Each crease must be folded, but the pattern does not specify whether the folds should be mountain folds or valley folds. The goal is to determine whether it is possible to fold the paper so that every crease is folded, no folds occur elsewhere, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> folded sheet of paper lies flat.|$|E
5|$|By {{the evening}} of 20 September, Chauvel's {{communications}} with his cavalry divisions, were limited to wireless and aircraft. The last aerial reconnaissance on 20 September reported three large fires burning at Nablus railway station, fires burning at the Balata dumps, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> Ottoman front line from El Lubban to the Jordan alarmed. They also reported a brigade of British cavalry entering Beisan.|$|E

5|$|Despite token {{criticism}} of the partition from the Austrian archduchess, Empress Maria Theresa, Austrian statesman Wenzel Anton Graf Kaunitz considered the Austrian share an ample compensation; despite Austria being the least interested in the partition, it received the largest share of formerly Polish population, and second largest land share (83,000km2 and 2,650,000 people). Austria gained Zator and Auschwitz (Oświęcim), part of Little Poland embracing parts of the counties of Kraków and Sandomierz (with the rich salt mines of Bochnia and Wieliczka), <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> of Galicia, less the city of Kraków.|$|E
5|$|Eventually {{the water}} {{remaining}} in the geyser cools back to below the boiling point and the eruption ends; heated groundwater begins seeping back into the reservoir, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> cycle begins again.

5|$|It {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} {{to a number of}} Amanita species. It can be distinguished from A.praegraveolens microscopically by the absence of clamp connections between the cells in S.thiersii. Both S.thiersii and A.aureofloccosa have hollow stems but the latter has a more tapering stipe <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> fruit body is yellower. A.silvifuga is another species that grows in similar locations in grassland in Texas and H. D. Thiers described the taste of both it and A. thiersii as being bitter. It can be distinguished by its darker coloration and more warted appearance.|$|E

Allegri added that to improve on the season would not mean winning a treble, but remaining within Europe's top 8 teams for the future.|$|E

5|$|Local {{symptoms}} include immediate and intense pain, followed {{after a few}} minutes (but perhaps by as much as 30 minutes) by swelling and a tingling sensation.

Swelling may also spread to the trunk, and with children, throughout the entire body. Necrosis and intracompartmental syndromes are very rare.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{north of}} Aylesbury the Buckinghamshire Railway was being built by Sir Harry Verney.

The first section opened on 1May1850, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> on 20May1851.
