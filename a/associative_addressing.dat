Object Space allows for decoupled communication between program components {{by providing a}} shared data space of objects. This style of communication was inspired by Linda. The Object Space approach extends a sequential language (C++ in our case) with coordination and communication primitives. It integrates inheritance into <b>associative</b> <b>addressing</b> as known from Linda and facilitates passing of arbitrary objects between program components. Furthermore we introduce the notion of applicationspecific matching functions. A prototype for Object Space has been implemented in C++ under UNIX.

40|$|Datapath {{components}} in modern high performance superscalar processors employ {{a significant amount}} of <b>associative</b> <b>addressing</b> logic based on the use of comparators that dissipate energy on a mismatch. These comparators are used to detect a full match, but as mismatches are much more common than full matches in some components of the CPU, considerable energy [...] inefficiencies occur within the associative logic. We propose the design of two new comparator circuits that predominantly dissipate energy on a match, thus resulting in very significant savings in comparator power dissipation. The proposed designs are evaluated using SPICE simulations of actual VLSI layouts of the comparators in 0. 18 micron 6 [...] metal layer process and micro [...] architectural level statistics...|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{pulldown}} comparators {{that are}} used to implement <b>associative</b> <b>addressing</b> logic in superscalar microprocessors dissipate energy on a mismatch in any bit position in the comparands. As mismatches occur much more frequently than matches in many situations, such circuits are extremely energy–inefficient. In recognition of this inefficiency, a series of dissipate–on–match comparator designs have been proposed to address the power considerations. These designs, however, are limited to at most 8 –bit long arguments. In this paper, we examine the designs of energy–efficient comparators capable of comparing arguments as long as 32 bits in size. Such long comparands are routinely used in the load–store queues, caches, BTBs and TLBs. We use the actual layout data and the realistic bit patterns of the comparands (obtained from the simulated execution of SPEC 2000 benchmarks) to show the energy impact from the use of the new comparators. In general, a non–trivial combination of traditional and dissipate–on–match 8 –bit comparator blocks represents the most energy–efficient and fastest solution. As an example of this general approach, we show how fast and energy–efficient comparators can be designed for comparing addresses within the load–store queue of a superscalar processor...|$|E

40|$|Advanced {{inferring}} {{abilities that}} are used for predator recognition and avoidance have been documented {{in a variety of}} animal species that produce alarm calls. In contrast, evidence for cognitive abilities that underpin predation avoidance in nonalarm-calling species is restricted to associative learning of heterospecific alarm calls and predator presence. We investigated cognitive capacities that underlie the perception and computation of external information beyond <b>associative</b> learning by <b>addressing</b> contextual information processing in pigeons, Columba livia, a bird species without specific alarm calls. We used a habituation/dishabituation paradigm across sensory modes to test pigeons' context-dependent inferring abilities. The birds reliably took previous knowledge about predator presence into account and responded with predator-specific scanning behaviour only if predator presence was not indicated before or if the perceived level of urgency increased. Hence, pigeons' antipredator behaviour was not based on the physical properties of displayed stimuli or their referential content alone but on contextual information, indicated by the kind and order of stimulus presentation and different sensory modes...|$|R
40|$|An {{associative}} memory is {{a framework of}} content-addressable memory that stores a collection of message vectors (or a dataset) over a neural network while enabling a neurally feasible mechanism to recover any message in the dataset from its noisy version. Designing an <b>associative</b> memory requires <b>addressing</b> two main tasks: 1) learning phase: given a dataset, learn a concise representation of the dataset {{in the form of}} a graphical model (or a neural network), 2) recall phase: given a noisy version of a message vector from the dataset, output the correct message vector via a neurally feasible algorithm over the network learnt during the learning phase. This paper studies the problem of designing a class of neural associative memories which learns a network representation for a large dataset that ensures correction against a large number of adversarial errors during the recall phase. Specifically, the associative memories designed in this paper can store dataset containing (n) n-length message vectors over a network with O(n) nodes and can tolerate Ω(n/ polylog n) adversarial errors. This paper carries out this memory design by mapping the learning phase and recall phase to the tasks of dictionary learning with a square dictionary and iterative error correction in an expander code, respectively.

40|$|Recently, {{elevated}} ongoing pre-stimulus beta power (13 - 17 Hz) at encoding {{has been}} associated with subsequent memory formation for visual stimulus material. It is unclear whether this activity is merely specific to visual processing or whether it reflects a state facilitating general memory formation, independent of stimulus modality. To answer that question, the present study investigated the relationship between neural pre-stimulus oscillations and verbal memory formation in different sensory modalities. For that purpose, a within-subject design was employed to explore differences between successful and failed memory formation in the visual and auditory modality. Furthermore, <b>associative</b> memory was <b>addressed</b> by presenting the stimuli in combination with background images. Results revealed that similar EEG activity in the low beta frequency range (13 - 17 Hz) is associated with subsequent memory success, independent of stimulus modality. Elevated power prior to stimulus onset differentiated successful from failed memory formation. In contrast, differential effects between modalities were found in the theta band (3 - 7 Hz), with an increased oscillatory activity before the onset of later remembered visually presented words. In addition, pre-stimulus theta power dissociated between successful and failed encoding of associated context, independent of the stimulus modality of the item itself. We therefore suggest that increased ongoing low beta activity reflects a memory promoting state, which is likely to be moderated by modality-independent attentional or inhibitory processes, whereas high ongoing theta power is suggested as an indicator of the enhanced binding of incoming interlinked information...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT This review evaluates {{scientific}} data associ-ated {{with the possibility}} that trans fatty acids compromise fetal and infant early development. Concerns have been triggered by research that has heightened our awareness {{of the importance of}} n- 3 and n- 6 fatty acids; shown that trans fatty acids inhibit z 16 desaturation of linoleic acid; identified trans fatty acid isomers in fetal, infant, and maternal tissues; and reported an inverse association between the trans fatty acid content of tissue lipids and measures of growth and development. Animal studies provide little evidence that trans fatty acids influence growth, reproduction, or gross aspects of fetal development. However, these models may not have been appropriate for addressing all the subtle effects that influence development of human infant retinal, neural, or brain function. Human studies are hampered by the complexity of the interrelations among nutritional, genetic, and environmental factors and by ethical considerations that constrain the research design. Existing data have not established a causal relation between trans fatty acid intake and early development. Conclusions cannot be drawn from the possible association found between trans fatty acid exposure and lower n- 3 and n- 6 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and growth because of confounding factors. Few studies addressed the question of whether trans fatty acids adversely affect human fetal growth. One study reported a correlation between the trans fatty acid content of plasma and birth weight of preterm infants and one study reported a relation between preterm births and the trans fatty acid content of maternal plasma. Limited <b>associative</b> data have <b>addressed</b> whether trans fatty acids adversely affect fetal and infant neurodevelopment and growth. The interpretation of existing research and development of recommendations should be done cautiously. Suggestions for research to clarify these issues are made.

40|$|Increasing {{amounts of}} work have {{demonstrated}} that brain rhythms might constitute clocking mechanisms against which to coordinate sequences of neural firing; such rhythms may be essential to the coding operations performed by the local networks. The sequence of operations underlying a tactile discrimination task in rats requires the animal to integrate two streams of information, those coming from the environment and, from reference memory the rules that dictate the correct response. The current study is a follow up on the work which has described the hippocampal representation of the tactile guided task. We have used a well-established texture discrimination task, in which rats have to associate two stimuli with two different reward locations. We placed microelectrodes in primary somatosensory cortex and the CA 1 region of hippocampus to perform recordings of spiking activity and local field potentials when the animal touched the discriminandum as well as {{when he was in}} a resting state. We also performed recording on an arena in which the animal moved freely and did not perform any task. Earlier work has demonstrated that tactile signals reach the hippocampus during texture discrimination, presumably through the somatosensory cortex. We predicted that neurons in the primary somatosensory cortex (S 1) are entrained to the oscillatory theta rhythm that permeates the hippocampus. Our expectation is that such coherence could serve to increase the reliability of synaptic transmission, linking the acquisition of new sensory information with <b>associative</b> processes. We <b>addressed</b> the following issues: Is the timing of action potentials in S 1 modulated by the ongoing hippocampal theta rhythm? If so, is the occurrence of this modulation aligned in time to the period in which the hippocampus acquires tactile signals? We also predicted that the 10 -Hz whisking that characterizes the acquisition of texture information would be more strongly phase locked to theta rhythm than the whisking in the air that is not accompanied by any explicit tactile task. We speculate that such phase locking could be a means to synchronize sensory and hippocampal processing. The notion that the coordination between brain areas might be related to the rhythmic of sensorimotor cycles is particularly appealing. We have found that the firing of 18...|$|R
40|$|Maintaining memory {{relevance}} {{in the face}} of an ever-changing world is essential for survival. When animals form memories about specific environmental contexts and their associations, they must be able to continually assess the validity of both those associations and of the contextual memories themselves. Without valid associations, animal could express excessively weak or strong behaviors, either of which could be maladaptive. Further, without valid contextual representations, animals could recall the associations in the wrong settings and thus express behaviors in inappropriate situations. To <b>address</b> <b>associative</b> validity, animals can employ a number of well-understood processes. These include extinction, a process by which non-reinforced associations become suppressed through further experience, and the destabilization-reconsolidation sequence, a process by which memories become destabilized, strengthened, and re-consolidated following reinforcement. However, while there are hints that animals may be able to change the composition of their contextual memories through further experience, this has not been adequately proven. Further, the underlying brain mechanisms remain unidentified. In this study, we used context fear conditioning, a paradigm in which animals learn to fear a specific context, to investigate whether inaccurate context memories could be made more accurate through further experience. By assessing context discrimination, we found that memory reactivation in the conditioning context improved the accuracy of initially inaccurate memories. However, reactivation in a slightly different context that was not initially discriminable resulted in discrimination reversal, where fear was retained to the different but not the conditioning context subsequently. Both of these discrimination-altering phenomena weakened and disappeared as initial memory accuracy was improved, suggesting that the underlying process was specifically geared towards altering inaccurate memories. Further, investigations revealed that these phenomena always co-occurred with protein synthesis-dependent reconsolidation and required hippocampal NF-kB and protein degradation but not BDNF, consistent with the destabilization-reconsolidation sequence being the underlying mechanism. Finally, we found that while this precision-altering mechanism could occur in isolation, it was mutually competitive and exclusive with any concurrent extinction processes across the entire accuracy spectrum. These findings could provide a new framework for understanding the relationship between initial context memory encoding accuracy, context memory updating, the destabilization-reconsolidation sequence and extinction...|$|R
40|$|McLaren, I. P., Jones, F. W., McLaren, R. and Yeates, F. (2013) Cue {{competition}} in human incidental learning. In: Reinforcement Learning and Decision Making Meeting 2013, 25 th- 27 th October, Princeton, New Jersey, USA. There {{is a question}} as to whether cue competition effects can be observed in incidental learning paradigms in humans. Some authors have reported that cue competition is not observed, and that previous demonstrations of cue competition have relied on explicit awareness of the task in hand. This would imply that these effects {{are more likely to be}} the product of cognitive inference than <b>associative</b> learning. We <b>addressed</b> this question by using two paradigms previously shown to produce associative learning under incidental conditions. One was a standard SRT task in which the preceding two trials of a run of three predicted the third 2 / 3 of the time, and the other was based on another predictive cue, a colored square, which could also stochastically predict the next response required. We have demonstrated in other studies that both cues would support learning under incidental conditions in the absence of any verbalisable knowledge of the rules involved. The question was to what extent would these two cues compete if run concurrently, as assayed by their ability to make the next response faster and more accurate than controls? We assessed this by comparing a dual cue group to a color only control and a sequence only control. Our results showed that all three groups learned, but that during a test phase where each cue could be assessed independently, the dual group showed a marked decline in performance relative to the color control, and very similar performance to the sequence control. We interpret this as evidence for overshadowing occurring between the two predictive cues in the dual group, such that when combined their performance would be equivalent or superior to either control, but when assessed independently, the color cue actually has a weaker association to the outcome than the equivalent cue in the control group. We conclude that the sequence cues overshadowed the color cues in this task, and discuss possible theoretical accounts of this phenomenon...|$|R

Surakarta This {{research}} investigates non-referential vocative expressions {{employed by}} {{the characters in the}} film entitled “Bring It On”. The objectives of this research are to find out the types of vocative expressions {{employed by the}} characters in the film entitled “Bring It On” and to describe the reasons why those characters employ a certain type of vocative expressions. This research used a descriptive qualitative research referring to the method to formulate the conclusion by collecting, classifying, and interpreting the data of the research. The data sources of the research were the film entitled “Bring It On” directed by Peyton Reed and its script found from the internet. All of the utterances containing non-referential vocative expressions employed by the characters in the film entitled “Bring It On” were used as the data of the research. This research applied purposive sampling technique in which several significant data containing non-referential vocative expressions were analyzed. Derived from the analysis, the research concludes that there are four types of vocative expressions employed by the characters in the film entitled “Bring It On” according to Kubo’s speech act theoretic analysis of vocatives. They are associative non-referential calling, dissociative non-referential calling, <b>associative</b> non-referential <b>addressing,</b> and dissociative non-referential addressing. Those different types of non-referential vocative expressions are certainly influenced by different contexts of situation. The reasons why the characters in the film entitled “Bring It On” employ a certain type of vocative expressions are analyzed based on either a perlocutionary act of association or a perlocutionary act of dissociaton contained in the vocative expression. Basically, there are two reasons why the characters employ a certain type of vocative expressions namely to associate the hearer and to dissociate the hearer. The reason that the speaker intends to associate the hearer is specifically divided into four reasons. The first reason is that the speaker has an intention to show his or her affection and to respect the hearer. This reason maintains a close relationship between the speaker and the hearer. The second reason is that the speaker intends to minimize the speaker- hearer distance. This reason occurs when the speaker has a higher social status than the hearer. The next reason is that the speaker intends to associate the hearer who dissociates the speaker. The basic context of this reason is that the speaker is hated by the hearer but the speaker is still willing to associate the hearer. The last reason is that the speaker has an intention to motivate the hearer. This reason occurs when the hearer needs to be motivated. On the other hands, the reason that the speaker has an intention to dissociate the hearer is divided into three reasons namely to tease the hearer, to show that the speaker does not like the hearer, and to show the speaker’s anger. The first reason is that the speaker has an intention to tease the hearer. This reason occurs when the speaker and the hearer have a bad relationship. The second reason is that the speaker intends to show that he or she does not like the hearer. Similar with the first reason, this reason occurs when the speaker has a bad relationship with the hearer. The last reason is related to the speaker’s intention to show his or her anger. The context occurred in this reason is that the speaker is angry since the hearer has made a mistake. Therefore, {{it can be said that}} the speaker has a bad relationship with the hearer. It is finally expected that this research will be useful for those who are interested in the related study. In addition, it is suggested that those who do research in linguistics are able to develop the research to other aspects of deixis. Furthermore, it is suggested that the film maker can provide vocative expressions containing insincere perlocutionary acts, exploitation of group term distinction and inconsistent vocative phrases so that the analysis will be more various and complete. ...|$|R
