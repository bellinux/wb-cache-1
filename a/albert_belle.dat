5|$|Davis's 50th {{home run}} of the season, which he hit on September 13, tied him with Brady Anderson for the Orioles record of most home runs in a single season. He also became only the third player in MLB history, after Babe Ruth (New York Yankees, 1921) and <b>Albert</b> <b>Belle</b> (Cleveland Indians, 1995), to hit 50 home runs and 40 doubles in a single season. He hit his 51st home run on September 17, setting a new Orioles single season record. This was also his 92nd extra-base hit of the season, again tying Anderson for a {{franchise}} record. He later surpassed that by hitting his first triple of the season against Alex Cobb on September 21 in a 51 loss to Tampa Bay. Davis broke another Orioles record on September 27 with his 28th home {{run of the}} season hit at his home park of Camden Yards, surpassing Frank Robinson's record of 27 home runs hit at Memorial Stadium in 1966.|$|E

Three days later, on April 10, Burrell hit a two-run walk-off {{home run in the}} 11th inning to give the Phillies a 7–5 victory over the Braves. He was the first player in the major leagues to hit two such home runs in a four-day period since <b>Albert</b> <b>Belle</b> did it in 1995, and he was the first Phillie to hit two such in a season since Von Hayes hit two in 1989. In May, he hit eight home runs, the most by a Phillie in May since {{teammate}} Mike Lieberthal hit eight in 1999. From June 2 through June 16, he had an 11-game hitting streak, his longest of the season. During the streak, on June 2, he tied a career-high with five RBI in an 18–3 victory over the Montreal Expos. Burrell had 22 home runs by the All-Star break, the most by a Phillie since Mike Schmidt had 31 by the 1979 All-Star break. On July 15, he hit a game-winning three-run home run against Matt Herges in an 11–8 victory over Montreal. He had two home runs, five RBI, and a grand slam in a 7–6 loss to the Dodgers on August 9. On August 30, Burrell had three RBI (including the game-winner) in a 7–5 victory over the Mets. He had his one hundredth RBI that day, becoming the first Phillie with 100 RBI by August 31 since Greg Luzinski did it in 1977. Burrell finished the season with career highs in almost every offensive category, including runs (96), batting average (.286), and games (157). He was the 12th Phillie with 30 home runs and 100 RBI in a season. His 37 home runs were seventh in the NL, and his 116 RBI were third, behind only Lance Berkman (128) and Albert Pujols (127).

25|$|Prior to Game 3 of the 1995 World Series, Cleveland Indians slugger <b>Albert</b> <b>Belle</b> {{unleashed}} a profanity-laced tirade at NBC reporter Hannah Storm {{as she was}} waiting in the Indians' dugout for a prearranged interview with Indians lead-off man, Kenny Lofton. On the same day, Belle snapped at a photographer near the first base line during batting practice. Belle was ultimately fined US$50,000 for his behavior towards Storm. This particular World Series was remembered for baseball television history being made twice by Storm. Prior to Game 2, she became the first female sportscaster to serve as solo host of a World Series game, and after Game 6 she would be the first female sportscaster to preside over the presentation of the Commissioner's Trophy to the World Series champions. However, she was not the first female sportscaster to cover the World Series: that honor fell to CBS Sports reporter Lesley Visser, who served as a field reporter for the Series from 1990 to 1993.

As an impending free agent, it was Lofton's last season with Cleveland before being traded to near the end of spring training 1997 to the Atlanta Braves of the National League. On trading Lofton, Hart said, [...] "We had to make this trade and based on the fact that Lofton could be a free agent at the end of this season. We went through it with <b>Albert</b> <b>Belle</b> last year, and Albert left and we had nothing in return. We were not prepared to do that again." [...] Lofton, described as [...] "an emotional and offensive catalyst" [...] with the Indians, appeared in three consecutive All-Star Games (19941996) and won four straight Gold Glove Awards (19931996) with the Indians. He led the AL in stolen bases for five straight seasons (19921996) and set the single-season Indians' franchise stolen base record (75).|$|E

5000|$|The Indians {{called on}} the veteran Dennis Martínez for Game 1. The Mariners rode the arm of Bob Wolcott.

In the second, Mike Blowers hit a two-run homer to put the Mariners in front 2-0. However, the Indians would put together a run in the next inning and in the seventh, <b>Albert</b> <b>Belle's</b> solo homer tied the game at two. With Martinez still pitching in a tie game, the Mariners would take the lead thanks to Luis Sojo's go-ahead double in {{the bottom half of the}} seventh.

500|$|As a {{basketball}} owner, {{he has been}} described by Time as a [...] "cheapskate", a reference they also use for his baseball persona. [...] As of 1995, the time when Scottie Pippen was eager to either be traded or be rid of Krause, he had never renegotiated a contract. [...] As a baseball owner, he has had {{a reputation as one of}} the most militant, anti-union, hard-line owners. [...] Newsweek described him as [...] "one of the hardest heads in the 1994 baseball strike". In the baseball offseason between the 1992 and 1993 seasons, he completely abstained from the free agent market. [...] Reinsdorf was one of the last holdouts to the 1996 labor agreement that instituted the salary cap while retaining arbitration rights for the players. [...] His 1996 signing of <b>Albert</b> <b>Belle</b> made news because of his widely publicized general opposition to spiraling player salaries. The $55 million signing was a turning point in the decision by the baseball owners to agree to revenue sharing. The signing also made Reinsdorf the employer of the highest paid Major League Baseball player and highest paid professional basketball player (Jordan) at the same time. [...] Reinsdorf had just re-signed Jordan after the 1995–96 NBA season. However, Jordan had been underpaid most of his career, and Reinsdorf, who did not feel he could justify the $30 million salary from a business standpoint, immediately realized he was going to soon feel buyer's remorse. Even his most successful baseball team was not highly paid: when the White Sox won the 2005 World Series, Reinsdorf had the 13th highest payroll of the 30 Major League Baseball teams.|$|E
500|$|In total, 29 {{players have}} reached the 50 home run club in MLB history and nine have done so more than once. [...] Of these, {{seventeen}} were right-handed batters, eleven were left-handed, and one was a switch hitter, meaning he could bat from {{either side of the}} plate. [...] Four of these players (including two active members of the 50 home run club) have played for only one major league team. [...] The New York Yankees are the only franchise to have five players reach the milestone while on their roster: Ruth, Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris, Alex Rodriguez, and Aaron Judge. [...] Ten players are also members of the 500 home run club and two of them (Willie Mays and Rodriguez) are also members of the 3,000 hit club. [...] Ten players won the Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award in the same year as their 50 home run season. [...] Mantle is the only player to have earned the Major League Triple Crown alongside achieving 50 home runs, leading both leagues in batting average, home runs and runs batted in (RBI). [...] Mantle and Maris—collectively known as the M Boys—are the only teammates to reach the 50 home run club in the same season, hitting a combined 115 home runs in 1961 and breaking the single-season record for home runs by a pair of teammates. <b>Albert</b> <b>Belle</b> is the only player to amass 50 or more doubles in addition to attaining 50 home runs. Prince Fielder, at 23 years and 139 days, was the youngest player to reach the milestone while Bonds, at age 37, was the oldest.|$|E
500|$|During {{his first}} season with Cleveland, in 1992, Lofton hit [...]285. His 66 stolen bases broke the all-time record for an American League rookie and was the most by a Major League rookie since Vince Coleman stole 110 in 1985. His season's stolen base count, which led the AL, also broke a {{franchise}} record (previously set by Miguel Diloné in 1980). Indians first base coach Dave Nelson helped Lofton refine his baserunning technique and helped {{learn how to be}} successful with bunting. Lofton finished second (to the Milwaukee Brewers' Pat Listach) in AL Rookie of the Year balloting. After one season with Cleveland, Lofton agreed to a four-year, $6.3 million contract. The following season, Lofton broke his own Cleveland single-season stolen bases' record, recording 70 (which led the MLB). Lofton was selected to his first career All-Star Game during the 1994 season. His development and impact in the league led Brewers manager Phil Garner to say, [...] "I remember how raw he was, and I've never seen anybody develop into that type of player that fast." [...] Garner, who saw Lofton play in the minors, added, [...] "He went from a guy who could hardly get the ball past the infield to a guy who could hit the ball consistently. He always had good speed, but got lousy jumps and didn't run the bases well. He has turned into a dominant player." [...] The regular season was stopped abruptly with the MLB strike, which also led to the cancellation of the World Series. For the season, Lofton again led the AL with 60 stolen bases. His 160 hits on the season were highest in the AL and his [...]349 batting average would be a career-best. He finished fourth in Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) voting. When the strike began in August, the Indians were in second place by one game in the AL Central to the Chicago White Sox. Indians general manager John Hart said of Lofton, [...] "What a representative for our team and our city. He has the opportunity to be a George Brett-type player here, someone who is synonymous with a franchise." [...] Lofton would join fellow Indians Carlos Baerga, <b>Albert</b> <b>Belle,</b> and Jim Thome to form [...] "the backbone of some Indians teams that were as dominant as any." ...|$|E
