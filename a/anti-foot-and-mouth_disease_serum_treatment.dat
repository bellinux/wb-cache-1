40|$|AIM [...] To {{determine}} serum laminin {{concentrations in}} patients with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. METHODS [...] An enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) {{was used to determine}} serum laminin concentrations in 54 patients with acute uncomplicated P falciparum malaria during and after treatment, and in 17 control subjects in Bangkok, Thailand. RESULTS [...] Raised concentrations of soluble laminin were observed in patients (mean (SD) concentration 628 (225) ng/ml), compared with normal controls (490 (116) ng/ml), during the acute phase of the <b>disease.</b> During <b>treatment,</b> <b>serum</b> laminin concentrations decreased and returned to normal within three days. Serum laminin concentrations were correlated with parasite counts before treatment, and with the serum concentration of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1), soluble E-selectin, and soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor at 55 kilodaltons. CONCLUSIONS [...] These findings are compatible with an increased production or release of laminin in P falciparum malaria, which could indicate a role for the subendothelial basement membrane in the pathogenesis of the disease...|$|R

40|$|Expression of hepcidin, {{a central}} {{regulator}} of systemic iron metabolism, is transcriptionally {{regulated by the}} bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway. However, the factors other than the BMP pathway also participate in the regulation of hepcidin expression. In the present study, we show that <b>serum</b> <b>treatment</b> increased hepcidin expression and transcription without inducing the phosphorylation of Smad 1 / 5 / 8 in primary hepatocytes, HepG 2 cells or Hepa 1 - 6 cells. Co-treatment with LDN- 193189, an inhibitor of the BMP type I receptor, abrogated this hepcidin induction. Reporter assays using mutated reporters revealed {{the involvement of the}} BMP response element- 1 (BMP-RE 1) and signal transducers and activator of transcription (STAT) - and activator protein (AP) - 1 -binding sites in serum-induced hepcidin transcription in HepG 2 cells. <b>Serum</b> <b>treatment</b> induced the expression of the AP- 1 components c-fos and junB in primary hepatocytes and HepG 2 cells. Forced expression of c-fos or junB enhanced the response of hepcidin transcription to <b>serum</b> <b>treatment.</b> By contrast, the expression of dominant negative (dn) -c-fos and dn-junB decreased hepcidin transcription. The present study reveals that serum contains factors stimulating hepcidin transcription. Basal BMP activity is essential for the serum-induced hepcidin transcription, although <b>serum</b> <b>treatment</b> does not stimulate the BMP pathway. The induction of c-fos and junB by <b>serum</b> <b>treatment</b> stimulates hepcidin transcription, through possibly cooperation with BMP-mediated signaling. Considering that AP- 1 is induced by various stimuli, the present results suggest that hepcidin expression is regulated by more diverse factors than had been previously considered...|$|R

40|$|By {{studying}} {{the effect of}} hookworm <b>disease</b> <b>serum</b> injection on the iron metabolism in rabbits given such injections and. comparing the same in experimental anemia, the following conclusions have been drawn. 1. In the rabbits given injection of hookworm <b>disease</b> <b>serum,</b> serum iron shows a decrease, while non-hemin iron content in the viscera tends to show an increase in each fraction (4 non-hemin iron fractions of Yoneyama and Konno's method). 2.

From these findings there seems to exist a factor in serum, which inhibits iron mobilization, thus bringing about iron deficiency in the erythropoietic system in bone marrow; and this seems to constitute an important causative factor for the anemia in this disease...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: We have {{previously}} found that overexpression of CHF 1 /Hey 2 in the myocardium prevents {{the development of}} phenylephrine-induced hypertrophy. To identify transcriptional pathways regulated by CHF 1 /Hey 2, we cultured primary neonatal mouse cardiac myocytes from wild type and transgenic mice overexpressing CHF 1 /Hey 2 and treated them with serum, a potent hypertrophic stimulus. We verified that overexpression of CHF 1 /Hey 2 suppressed cardiac myocyte hypertrophy induced by serum and then determined transcriptional profiles by microarray hybridization. We identified and verified important downstream target genes by single gene analysis and qRT-PCR and then identified important biological processes by Gene Set Analysis using Biological Process Gene Sets from the Gene Ontology Consortium. We found that CHF 1 /Hey 2 suppresses pathways involved in water transport, adenylate cyclase activity, embryonic eye morphogenesis, gut development and fluid transport after serum stimulation. Genes involved in protein dephosphorylation, demonstrate increased expression in myocytes overexpressing CHF 1 /Hey 2, independent of <b>serum</b> <b>treatment.</b> Genes overexpressed prior to <b>serum</b> <b>treatment</b> are involved in regulation of transcription factor activity, nuclear protein export and steroid hormone receptor signaling.

40|$|The {{possible}} {{roles of}} Src family kinases in the enhanced malignant properties of melanomas related to GD 3 expression were analyzed.

Yes was located upstream of p 130 Cas and paxillin and at an equivalent level to focal adhesion kinase. Yes underwent autophosphorylation even before <b>serum</b> <b>treatment</b> and showed stronger kinase activity in GD 3 + cells than in GD 3 − cells following <b>serum</b> <b>treatment.</b> Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that Yes bound to focal adhesion kinase or p 130 Cas more strongly in GD 3 + cells than in GD 3 − cells. As a possible mechanism for the enhancing effects of GD 3 on cellular phenotypes, it was shown that majority of Yes was localized in glycolipid-enriched microdomain/rafts in GD 3 + cells even before <b>serum</b> <b>treatment,</b> whereas it was scarcely detected in glycolipid-enriched microdomain/rafts in GD 3 − cells. An in vitro kinase assay of Yes revealed that coexistence of GD 3 with Yes in membranous environments enhances the kinase activity of GD 3 − cell-derived Yes toward enolase, p 125, and Yes itself. Knockdown of GD 3 synthase resulted in the alleviation of tumor phenotypes and reduced activation levels of Yes.

Methods: Subjects comprised 94 patients admitted to a hospital or nursing home during the 5 years between April 2007 and April 2012 with central nervous symptoms. Serum SP levels were measured by enzyme immunoassay, and video endoscopy using a nasal endoscope in all subjects to ob-jectively evaluate swallowing function.
