Large print publications (thick books, especially instructional in nature) and electronic pages (web pages) require meta data for <b>automatic</b> <b>indexing,</b> automatic reformatting, database publishing, dynamic page display and end-user interactivity. Much of the meta data (meta tags) must be hand coded or specified during the page layout process.

5000|$|The use of {{categories}} was proposed by user Stan Silver on August 27, 1996. His initial post suggested: [...] "If everyone adds a category and topic to their page, then the category and topic pages themselves {{can be used}} as <b>automatic</b> <b>indexes</b> into the pages." [...] Initially Silver had proposed both categories and topics: categories denoted the specific nature of the page's subject (a book, a person, a pattern), while topics denoted the theme of the page (Java, extreme programming, Smalltalk). However, people ignored this separation, and topics were collapsed into the categories.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a new {{research}} direction, <b>automatic</b> linguistic <b>indexing</b> of pictures, for data mining and machine learning researchers. <b>Automatic</b> linguistic <b>indexing</b> of pictures is an imperative but highly challenging problem. In our on-going research, we introduce a statistical modeling approach to this problem. Computer algorithms {{have been developed to}} mine numerical features automatically extracted from manually annotated categorized images. These image categories form a computer-generated dictionary of hundreds of concepts for computers to use in the linguistic annotation process. In our experimental implementation, we focus on a particular group of stochastic processes for describing images. We implemented and tested our ALIP (<b>Automatic</b> Linguistic <b>Indexing</b> of Pictures) system on a photographic image database of 600 different semantic categories, each with about 40 training images. Tested using more than 4600 images outside the training database, the system has demonstrated good accuracy and high potential in linguistic indexing of photographic images. Such a system can potentially be used in many areas such as semantic Web and counter terrorism...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>indexing</b> follows set {{processes}} of analyzing frequencies of word patterns and comparing results to other documents {{in order to}} assign to subject categories. This requires no understanding of the material being indexed. This therefore leads to more uniform indexing but this is {{at the expense of}} the true meaning being interpreted. A computer program will not understand the meaning of statements and may therefore fail to assign some relevant terms or assign incorrectly. Human indexers focus their attention on certain parts of the document such as the title, abstract, summary and conclusions, as analyzing the full text in depth is costly and time consuming [...] An automated system takes away the time limit and allows the entire document to be analyzed, but also has the option to be directed to particular parts of the document.|$|E
