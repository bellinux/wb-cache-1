5|$|Adamant was {{at first}} fitted for reserve duty in July 1792, but with the {{outbreak}} of war with Revolutionary France in April 1793 she was hurriedly recommissioned, at first under Captain William Bentinck <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> in 1794 William Mitchell was her acting-captain. From June 1794 she was under Captain Henry D'Esterre Darby. Darby took Adamant back to the Leeward Islands in September 1794, and by April 1796 Adamant was serving with George Vandeput's squadron. Captain Henry Warre took command in November 1796, and was succeeded by Captain William Hotham on 11 January 1797.|$|E
5|$|For most of {{the eighth}} century, Mercia was {{dominant}} among the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms south of the river Humber. Æthelbald, {{who came to the}} throne in 716, had established himself as the overlord of the southern Anglo-Saxons by 731. He was assassinated in 757, and was briefly succeeded by Beornred, but within a year Offa ousted Beornred and took the throne for himself. Offa's daughter Eadburh married Beorhtric of Wessex in 789, and Beorhtric became an ally thereafter. In Kent, Offa intervened decisively in the 780s, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> became the overlord of East Anglia, whose king, Æthelred, was beheaded at Offa's orders in 794.|$|E

Although this never came about, Hooker gave Buxton a number of botanical books <b>and,</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point,</b> Buxton accepted the position of President of the Manchester Working Men's Botanical Society.|$|E
5|$|The Alpine Spaniel is an extinct {{breed of}} dog {{which was used}} in {{mountain}} rescues by the Augustinian Canons, who run hospices in the region around the Great St. Bernard Pass. The spaniel was a large dog notable for its thick curly coat. One {{of the most famous}} specimens of the Alpine Spaniel is Barry, however his preserved body has been modified {{on more than one occasion}} to fit with descriptions of the extinct breed from earlier time periods. Due to the conditions in the Alps, and a series of accidents, extinction was discussed as a possibility by authors during the 1830s, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> prior to 1847 the entire breed was reduced to a single example due to disease. Evidence held at the Natural History Museum in Bern show that two distinct breeds of dog were being used in the area during this time period. The breed is thought to be the predecessor to the modern St. Bernard and the Clumber Spaniel.|$|E
5|$|The {{first half}} of the 12th century was a violent period in Gower, with {{extensive}} fighting occurring between the Anglo-Normans and the local Welsh. Loughor Castle was attacked and burnt down around the middle of the century, probably {{as a part of a}} Welsh rebellion that devastated the area in 1151. Henry II and the Welsh prince Rhys ap Gruffydd later agreed peace terms, and the castle was rebuilt. The inside of the ringwork was partially filled by debris during the 1151 attack, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> in the next few decades the bank of the ringwork was also deliberately widened inwards in places, allowing buildings to be constructed on it. These changes started the process of filling in the middle of the ringwork which led to the castle today having a mound, or motte-like, appearance.|$|E

5|$|Within a year, Laurel Grove failed. Fred was inexperienced {{and made}} poor bargains with local merchants. Before the war, {{plantations}} {{had been largely}} self-sufficient, but Fred paid high prices for goods shipped in from Savannah and Charleston. He took days off {{at a time to}} visit saloons in Jacksonville. An unanticipated infestation of cotton-worm larvae (Helicoverpa zea) destroyed much of the cotton crop. Only two bales were produced by Laurel Grove; Stowe realized the venture was a failure. Fred committed himself to a rehabilitation asylum in New York, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> in 1867, Stowe purchased the cottage and the attached grove in Mandarin.|$|E
5|$|All {{vertebrates}} have {{a similar}} basic body plan <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> in their lives, mostly in the embryonic stage, share the major chordate characteristics; a stiffening rod, the notochord; a dorsal hollow tube of nervous material, the neural tube; pharyngeal arches; and a tail posterior to the anus. The spinal cord is protected by the vertebral column and is above the notochord and the gastrointestinal tract is below it. Nervous tissue {{is derived from the}} ectoderm, connective tissues are derived from mesoderm, and gut is derived from the endoderm. At the posterior end is a tail which continues the spinal cord and vertebrae but not the gut. The mouth is found at the anterior end of the animal, and the anus {{at the base of the}} tail. The defining characteristic of a vertebrate is the vertebral column, formed in the development of the segmented series of vertebrae. In most vertebrates the notochord becomes the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs. However, a few vertebrates, such as the sturgeon and the coelacanth retain the notochord into adulthood. Jawed vertebrates are typified by paired appendages, fins or legs, which may be secondarily lost. The limbs of vertebrates are considered to be homologous because the same underlying skeletal structure was inherited from their last common ancestor. This is one of the arguments put forward by Charles Darwin to support his theory of evolution.|$|E
5|$|Guard {{units were}} {{generally}} neglected when the United States Air Force was created. Despite {{the introduction of}} jet fighters, the Guard units were left with generally overused World War II propeller aircraft, and had few funds for training. As the Cold War intensified, the Air Force looked to the Guard to fill United States-based interception missions and started overhauling their organization. Although the Massachusetts Air National Guard wasn't federalized for the Korean War, many airmen volunteered for active duty and flew in Korea. On 1 November 1950, the 67th Fighter Wing was inactivated and replaced by the 102d Fighter Wing, including just the 101st and 131st squadrons and their associated support units, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> before 1961 the wing was renamed a Tactical Fighter Wing. Additionally, the wing kept the 567th, and the 1801st. The squadrons were issued F-84B Thunderjets, but these were recalled and replaced by F-51 Mustangs which were flown until 1954 when the F-94 Starfire replaced the Mustangs. In 1952 the 253rd Combat Communications Group was activated and added to the 102d. In 1958 the Wing converted to the F-86H Sabre.|$|E

5|$|In 733, Bede {{travelled}} to York {{to visit}} Ecgbert, {{who was then}} bishop of York. The See of York was elevated to an archbishopric in 735, {{and it is likely}} that Bede and Ecgbert discussed the proposal for the elevation during his visit. Bede hoped to visit Ecgbert again in 734, but was too ill to make the journey. Bede also travelled to the monastery of Lindisfarne, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> visited the otherwise-unknown monastery of a monk named , a visit that is mentioned in a letter to that monk. Because of his widespread correspondence with others throughout the British Isles, and {{due to the fact that}} many of the letters imply that Bede had met his correspondents, it is likely that Bede travelled to some other places, although nothing further about timing or locations can be guessed. It seems certain that he did not visit Rome, however, as he would have mentioned it in the autobiographical chapter of his Historia Ecclesiastica. Nothhelm, a correspondent of Bede's who assisted him by finding documents for him in Rome, is known to have visited Bede, though the date cannot be determined beyond the fact that it was after Nothhelm's visit to Rome.|$|E
5|$|The Crosby Garrett helmet is {{an almost}} {{complete}} example of a two-piece Roman cavalry helmet. The visor portrays {{the face of a}} youthful, clean-shaven male with curly hair. The headpiece is {{in the shape of a}} Phrygian cap, on the crest of which is a winged griffin that stands with one raised foot resting on an amphora. The visor was originally attached to the headpiece by means of a hinge; the iron hinge pin has not survived, but its existence has been inferred from the presence of powdery deposits of iron oxide residue. The helmet would have been held in place using a leather strap attached from the wearer's neck to a decorated rivet on either side of the helmet, below the ear. Wear marks caused by opening and closing the visor are still visible, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> the helmet was repaired using a bronze sheet which was riveted across two splits. Only two other Roman helmets complete with visors have been found in Britain – the Newstead Helmet and Ribchester Helmet.|$|E
5|$|Trevor is Canadian, born {{just north}} of the border of the United States. He grew up with a {{physically}} abusive father and an emotionally abusive mother. Trevor had a brother, Ryan, who died prior to the game's events. Trevor's father abandoned him in a shopping mall, which he later burned down in retaliation. His father died when Trevor was 10. This upbringing combined with Trevor's violent temper led Trevor to be severely unhinged, leading to numerous fights at school, including an assault on a teacher. Trevor loved planes, <b>and</b> <b>at</b> <b>some</b> <b>point</b> entered the military as a pilot, but was quickly forced to leave after being reproved in a psychological evaluation. Later on, Trevor committed crimes, the first one being a small robbery that landed him in jail for six months (however, due to good behavior, he was out in four). He would continue his criminal ways, including using his piloting skills to become a smuggler. Trevor eventually met Michael Townley and both men realised that they wanted to earn money by performing large heists, and both men became successful in doing so. However, their partnership began to strain after Michael married a stripper named Amanda and started a family with her.|$|E
