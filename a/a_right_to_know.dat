He granted Khadr a letter of commendation to take back to Canadian mosques, calling for donations. However, the pair had a sensationalist showdown when Khadr insisted that he had <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> how the money would be spent, and Azzam's supporters labelled Khadr a Western spy. A Sharia court was convened in bin Laden's compound, and Azzam was found guilty of spreading allegations against Khadr, though no sentence was imposed.|$|E
25|$|Ishihara {{returned}} to the House of Representatives afterward, and {{worked his way up}} the party's internal ladder, serving as Director-General of the Environment Agency under Takeo Fukuda (1976) and Minister of Transport under Noboru Takeshita (1989). During the 1980s, Ishihara was a highly visible and popular LDP figure, but unable to win enough internal support to form a true faction and move up the national political ladder. In 1983 his campaign manager put up stickers throughout Tokyo stating that Ishihara's political opponent was an immigrant from North Korea. Ishihara denied that this was discrimination, saying that the public had <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>know.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Sixth Amendment (1791) {{provides}} several protections {{and rights}} {{to an individual}} accused of a crime. The accused {{has the right to}} a fair and speedy trial by a local and impartial jury. Likewise, a person has the right to a public trial. This right protects defendants from secret proceedings that might encourage abuse of the justice system, and serves to keep the public informed. This amendment also guarantees a right to legal counsel if accused of a crime, guarantees that the accused may require witnesses to attend the trial and testify {{in the presence of the}} accused, and guarantees the accused <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the charges against them. In 1966, the Supreme Court ruled that, with the Fifth Amendment, this amendment requires what has become known as the Miranda warning.|$|E
25|$|Erik Andersen Hylkje in Bergen, Norway who ran his own garage, Erik Andersen Lakkeringsverksted. Andersen {{has been}} active in motor sports for several years, {{particularly}} as a trainer in Bergen Trial Team. He is divorced and has two children. Andersen sometimes spelled his name as Eric Andersen, despite the fact that his legal name is Erik Andersen. He was identified on the front cover of Verdens Gang, the largest newspaper of Norway, on August 22, 2009. He was also identified by Bergens Tidende the following day. Subsequently, he has been identified by Dagbladet, Nettavisen, TV 2, Dagsavisen, Bergensavisen and Aftenposten. Norwegian media had previously refrained from using his name and picture as requested by the police, in order not to harm the investigation. However, the investigation was completed in May 2009. Legally, the media are allowed to identify suspects in criminal cases. Bernt Olufsen stated that Verdens Gang chose to identify him because of the scale and seriousness of the crimes, which according to Olufsen meant the public had <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> his identity.|$|E

In May 2007, senators from both major U.S. political parties drafted legislation to make the review public.

40|$|Background Although the “right not to know” is well {{established}} in international regulations, it has been heavily debated. Ubiquitous results from extended exome and genome analysis have challenged the <b>right</b> not <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) Recommendations urge to inform about incidental findings that pretend to be accurate and actionable. However, ample clinical cases raise the question whether these criteria are met. Many incidental findings are of uncertain significance (IFUS). The eager to feedback information appears to enter the field of IFUS and thereby threaten the <b>right</b> not <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> This makes it imperative to investigate the arguments for and against <b>a</b> <b>right</b> not <b>to</b> <b>know</b> for IFUS. Discussion This article investigates how the various arguments for and against <b>a</b> <b>right</b> not <b>to</b> <b>know</b> hold for IFUS. The main investigated arguments are: hypothetical utilitarianism, the right-based argument, the feasibility argument, the value of knowledge argument, the argument from lost significance, the empirical argument, the duty to disclose argument, the avoiding harm argument; the argument from principle, from autonomy, from privacy, {{as well as the}} argument from the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> open future. The analysis shows that both sides in the debate have exaggerated the importance of incidental findings. Summary Opponents of <b>a</b> <b>right</b> not <b>to</b> <b>know</b> have exaggerated the importance of IFUS, while proponents have exaggerated the need to be protected from something that is not knowledge. Hence, <b>to</b> <b>know</b> or not <b>to</b> <b>know</b> is not the question. The question is whether {{we should be able to}} stay ignorant of incidental findings of uncertain significance, if we want to. The answer is yes: As long as the information is not accurate and/or actionable: ignorance is bliss. When answering questions that are not asked, we need to think twice...|$|R

2500|$|Two years later, similar {{concerns}} followed Jobs's 2008 WWDC keynote address. Apple officials stated that Jobs was victim to a [...] "common bug" [...] and was taking antibiotics, while others surmised his cachectic appearance {{was due to}} the Whipple procedure. During a July conference call discussing Apple earnings, participants responded to repeated questions about Jobs's health by insisting that it was a [...] "private matter".

2500|$|In January 2014, Snowden {{said his}} [...] "breaking point" [...] was [...] "seeing the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, {{directly}} lie under oath to Congress." [...] This referred to testimony on March 12, 2013—three months after Snowden first sought to share thousands of NSA documents with Greenwald, and {{nine months after}} the NSA says Snowden made his first illegal downloads {{during the summer of}} 2012—in which Clapper denied to the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that the NSA wittingly collects data on millions of Americans. Snowden said, [...] "There's no saving an intelligence community that believes it can lie to the public and the legislators who {{need to be able to}} trust it and regulate its actions. Seeing that really meant for me there was no going back. Beyond that, it was the creeping realization that no one else was going to do this. The public had <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> about these programs." [...] In March 2014, Snowden stated that he had reported policy or legal issues related to spying programs to more than ten officials, but as a contractor had no legal avenue to pursue further whistleblowing. In May 2014, Vanity Fair reported that Snowden first contemplated leaking confidential documents around 2008 but held back, partly because he believed the newly elected Barack Obama might introduce reforms.|$|E

Some of them believed he was being held at the Bowie County Jail surrounded by Texas Rangers with submachine guns on their knees. Others believed he was flown to an out-of-town jail. The Gazette and News offices were drowned with phone calls, both local and long distance, inquiring about the apprehension of the killer. [...] "Newspapers Will Tell Public If Killer Is Caught", read one of the sub-headlines of the May 19th edition of Texarkana Gazette. Sheriff Presley declared that innocent people were being accused of being the Phantom and asked the residents to show more consideration for their fellow citizens. Presley stated, [...] "These rumors positively are not true. We can understand why the people believe them. All of us are tense and are hopeful that at any hour officers will announce they have the killer in custody. The people must not become so anxious to rid themselves of the killer, however, that they brand innocent persons as the murderer and believe unfounded stories.
