40|$|There is {{increasing}} concern about chemical pollutants {{that have the}} ability to mimic hormones, the so-called endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs). One of the main reasons for concern is the possible effect of EDCs on human health.

The main objective of this research was to evaluate the treatment performance of different wastewater treatment procedures (biological treatment, filtration, advanced oxidation processes) for the reduction of chemical oxygen demand and seven selected EDCs (dimethyl phthalate, diethyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, benzyl butyl phthalate, bis(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate, bisphenol A and nonylphenol) from wastewaters from a mill producing 100 % recycled paper.

Both aerobic and <b>anaerobic</b> <b>biological</b> <b>treatment</b> methods have been extensively used to treat domestic and industrial wastewater (Visvanathan et al., 2000). After removal of the soluble biodegradable matter in the biological process, any biomass formed needs to be separated from the liquid stream to produce the required effluent quality.

The passage of the effluent into the second biological reactor is continued until the biological solids in the second reactor enter into a negative growth phase. It becomes relatively stable, where the flow of waste through the reactors is reversed by terminating introduction of the waste into the first reactor and passing the same into the second reactor.

40|$|In situ {{accelerated}} {{anaerobic biodegradation}} is an innovative remediation technology that addresses common groundwater contaminants such as perchloroethene (PCE) and trichloroethene (TCE).

Developing strategies to control biological fouling in these systems increases the viability of this remediation technology. Successful in situ anaerobic biodegradation of chlorinated solvents requires distributing an organic carbon source (or substrate) throughout the aquifer to accelerate biological activity, which degrades the contaminants. Often, the substrate is delivered through injection wells. Maintaining maximum flow through injection wells is vital for successful remediation and is frequently limited by biological fouling.

Effective control of the reaction conditions was necessary to avoid the inhibition of high salt to the processes. Hazardous materials and pollutants with poor biodegradability can be eliminated by the preset micro electrolysis (Huang et al. 2013) and the ratio of BOD/COD can be greatly improved so that microorganism activity is not restrained by hazardous materials in the wastewater (Li et al. 2010; Tao and Kang 2014). Other organic pollutants, ammonia nitrogen, and biodegradable pollutants can be removed by <b>anaerobic</b> and aerobic <b>biological</b> <b>treatment</b> (Abou-Elela et al. 2010; Shi et al. 2014).

30|$|In {{anaerobic}} treatment, {{the high}} organic content in industrial wastewater decomposes into methane and CO 2 {{with the help}} of microorganisms. Anaerobic treatment of industrial wastewater shows interesting advantages such as production of very little sludge, requirement of less amount of energy, operation at high organic loading rate, need of low nutrient amount and production of biogas which can be utilized for energy production in this treatment process (Nandy et al. 2002). Inoculum source and feed pretreatment are the main steps, which can affect the treatment efficiency. However, due to the presence of low pH and slow growth rate, longer hydraulic retention time (HRT) results. To solve this problem a high-rate configuration was developed to treat industrial wastewater at relatively shorter HRT (Patel and Madamwar 2000). Enright et al.

40|$|A new {{integrated}} multi-environment {{wastewater treatment}} {{technology has been}} developed for high-rate removal of organic carbonaceous compounds and inorganic contaminants, notably nitrogen and phosphorus, as well as suspended solids. This technology uses two separate but interlinked reactors containing four zones with different environmental conditions of aerobic, microaerophilic, anoxic and <b>anaerobic</b> for <b>biological</b> <b>treatment</b> {{as well as two}} clarification zones and a filtration unit for efficient separation of solids from liquid. The first reactor of the treatment system is designed based on the concept of airlift reactors. The influence of operating and process parameters such as the hydraulic retention time (HRT) and superficial gas velocity (U G) on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the first reactor was examined. The liquid circulation velocity, gas hold-up and overall volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient increase with the increase of superficial gas velocity, while the mean circulation time decreases with the increase of air flow rate. The theoretical analysis of time dependent changes in the volume of mixed liquor demonstrated that liquid circulates from 363 to 1686 times between the three zones of aerobic, microaerophilic and anoxic before 99 % of the bioreactor's content is replaced by the added wastewater. At air flow rates higher than 30 L/min, the mixing performance of the first reactor resembles the patterns observed in continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs).

This paper reports on the seasonal operation of a UASB treatment plant treating a distillery wastewater stream with particular focus on seasonal start-up conditions after the first process commissioning. The start-up period was typically one week before process stability could be achieved. It is recommended that the loading rate to the plant be controlled between 4 and 8 kg COD/m 3 ·d until the process is stable and COD removal efficiencies remain, on average, higher than 90 %. After the start-up period the loading rate applied (4 to 18 kg COD/m 3 d) did not significantly affect the COD removal efficiency of the plant. High removal efficiencies of higher than 90 % were achieved and stop-start operation of the UASB process posed no problem for treatment...|$|E

The PCP concentrations, which ranged from 2. 0 to 13. 0 mg/L, were controlled by adding synthetic substrate. The HAIB reactor reduced 97 % of COD and removed 99 % of PCP. The microbial biofilm communities of the HAIB reactor amended with PCP, without previous acclimatization, were characterized by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) with specific Archaea oligonucleotide primers.

When applying photo-Fenton alone for treatment of Remazol Red RR (100 mg/l), optimal conditions were 3. 0 mM H 2 O 2 and 0. 25 mM Fe 2 +. These conditions resulted in complete decolorization and a residual COD of 2. 9 mg/l. When reducing the H 2 O 2 dose to 1 mM, residual COD was 22 mg/l. In the combined photo-Fenton/aerobic treatment complete decolorization and COD removal was achieved at 3 mM H 2 O 2 and 0. 25 mM Fe 2 +, while 9 mg/l of residual COD remained at the H 2 O 2 concentration 1 mM. When applying photo-Fenton as post-treatment after the anaerobic step, the residual COD was 14 mg/l independent of the H 2 O 2 concentration being set to 1 or 3 mM, however the Fe 2 + concentration needed to be increased to 2 mM, due to complex formation with the phosphate added as a macronutrient. Phytotoxicity tests showed higher residual toxicity after the photo-Fenton treatment alone than after the combined processes.

40|$|INFLUENCE OF ANAEROBIC TECHNOLOGY ON BIODEGRADATION OF COMPOUND PRECURSORS WITH HORMONAL ACTIVITY CONTAINED IN EFFLUENTS OF THE KRAFT CELLULOSE INDUSTRY Chile {{produces}} an annual average of 2 {{million tons of}} Kraft cellulose for which pine and eucalyptus are used as raw material. New investments indicate the possibility of increasing the cellulose production in 50 % in the next decade. These kinds of industries consume great amounts of water and chemical reactants and generate active organic waste, which {{have been identified as}} the main causes for negative environmental impacts of the Kraft cellulose industry. The Kraft pulping process uses an alkaline solution and sodium sulphur in the digestion to dissolve lignin and release cellulose fibres. After digestion, cellulose fibres are separated through filtering processes and the filtered product is called “black liquor”, which is usually recovered through evaporation and combustion. In spite of this, operation of this equipment is not always optimal. On the other hand, some industries will continue operating with old technologies. Due to the above, there is {{a small part of the}} black liquor that remains in the fibre and is dragged by it into the washing and bleaching process. These compounds contribute to the acute and chronic toxicity of effluents to which fish are exposed, that include, among others, alterations at the level (profile) of sexual steroids in fish plasma and decrease in their reproductive adaptation. In this last case, the compounds responsible for these effects are known as sterols and resinic acids, whose concentration is closely related to the type of raw material used by the Kraft cellulose industry (pine or eucalyptus). Studies conducted in the USA, Canada and Finland, among others, show the incidence of sterols and resinic acids in the discharge effluent from industries of processing of Kraft cellulose and pulp, which use treatments through aerated ponds and aerobic biological systems. However, there are no studies on the behaviour of these compounds in <b>anaerobic</b> <b>treatment</b> systems. <b>Anaerobic</b> <b>biological</b> <b>treatments</b> have advantages in comparison to aerobic systems in terms of low production of biological solids, nutritional requirements and operation with high organic loads. This allows thinking that anaerobic digestion might be a feasible alternative for cellulose plants that have already implemented new bleaching processes (lower toxicity in the final effluent), but that address the degradation of specific compounds, such as sterols. Due to the above stated, the project has the fundamental objective of studying the influence of anaerobic technology on biodegradation of precursors of compounds with hormonal activity contained in effluents of the Kraft cellulose industry. In order to conduct this research, the anaerobic biodegradation of precursors of compounds with hormonal activity (sterols and resinic acids) contained in effluents from the Kraft cellulose industry was studied in optimized systems. Results obtained show that resinic acids cannot be degraded in anaerobic systems, while they are completely mineralized in aerobic systems. The influence of technology, in turn, may affect sterols biodegradation. Aerobic ponds feature an incomplete mineralization of these compounds which is strongly dependant on the type of system operation. While in aerated systems, such as optimized activated muds, these compounds can be totally biodegraded. Analyses of cellulose effluents through bioindicators show that they can produce chronic toxicity in Daphnia. Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica - CONICY...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays {{formaldehyde}} {{is used as}} {{raw material}} in many industries. It has also disinfection applications in some public places. Due to its toxicity for microorganisms, chemical or <b>anaerobic</b> <b>biological</b> methods are applied for treating wastewater containing formaldehyde. In this research, formaldehyde removal efficiencies of aerobic <b>biological</b> <b>treatment</b> systems including moving bed biofilm (MMBR) and sequencing batch reactors (SBR) were investigated. During all experiments, the efficiency of SBR was more than MBBR, but {{the difference was not}} significant statistically. According to the results, the best efficiencies were obtained for influent formaldehyde COD of 200 mg/L in MBBR and SBR which were 93 % and 99. 4 %, respectively. The systems were also capable to treat higher formaldehyde concentrations (up to 2500 mg/L) with lower removal efficiency. The reaction kinetics followed the Stover-Kincannon second order model. The gram-positive and gram-negative bacillus and coccus as well as the gram-positive binary bacillus were found to be the most dominant species. The results of 13 C-NMR analysis have shown that formaldehyde and urea were converted into N-{[(aminocarbonyl) amino] methyl}urea and the residual formaldehyde was polymerized at room temperature...|$|R
