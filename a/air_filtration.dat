Apples are commonly stored in chambers with higher concentrations {{of carbon dioxide and}} high <b>air</b> <b>filtration.</b> This prevents ethylene concentrations from rising to higher amounts and preventing ripening from occurring too quickly. Ripening continues when the fruit is removed from storage.|$|E
5|$|The HL234, {{an engine}} born from the {{developments}} initiated {{by attempting to}} convert the Maybach HL230 to fuel injection, would have increased the power to about 800 to 900 PS (hp). The Entwicklungskommission Panzer unanimously decided that HL234 be immediately included in the engine design and procurement program. The AK-7-200 was also explored {{as an alternative to}} the Maybach Olvar-B drive train, but Waffenamt research and development department Wa Prüf 6 found that it offered inferior driving characteristics and so the Maybach Olvar-B was retained. There are also a program using the Simmering- Graz-Pauker Sla.16 engine, but the war's constraint on supplies and capitulation resulted in the cancellation of this program. Krupp proposed mounting a new main weapon, the 10.5cm KwK L/68. Wa Prüf 6 was not supportive of this as the Heer had not accepted the cannon itself. Other suggested improvements included stabilised sights, a stabilised main gun, an automatic ammunition feed, a Zeiss stereoscopic range finder, heated crew compartment, stowage for an additional 12 rounds, and an overpressure & <b>air</b> <b>filtration</b> system to protect against poison gas. However, these also never got beyond the proposal stage or did not enter production before the war ended.|$|E

25|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} {{is generally}} avoided {{as far as}} is reasonably practicable by positioning of the air intake in uncontaminated <b>air,</b> <b>filtration</b> of particulates from the intake air, use of suitable compressor design and appropriate lubricants, and ensuring that running temperatures are not excessive. Where the residual risk is excessive, a hopcalite catalyst {{can be used in}} the high pressure filter to convert carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide, which is far less toxic.|$|E
50|$|Although {{primarily}} used {{to catalyse}} {{the conversion of}} carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide, Hopcalite catalysts are also used to remove ethylene oxide and other VOCs as well as ozone from gas streams. Hopcalite-type mixtures are used in <b>air</b> <b>filtrations</b> systems for purify breathing air supplies, for example those utilised in scuba diving, and firefighting. Hopcalite is also used as the main filtration ingredient in the self rescue respirators issued to miners. Carbon Monoxide is not removed by activated charcoal air filters.|$|R

25|$|The {{operation}} did {{not bring}} about the desired success; for instance, on occasions when troops found a tunnel, they would often underestimate its size. Rarely would anyone be sent in to search the tunnels, as it was so hazardous. The tunnels were often rigged with explosive booby traps or punji stick pits. The two main responses in dealing with a tunnel opening were to flush the entrance with gas, water or hot tar to force the Viet Cong soldiers into the open, or to toss a few grenades down the hole and “crimp” off the opening. This approach proved ineffective due {{to the design of}} the tunnels and the strategic use of trap doors and <b>air</b> <b>filtration</b> systems.|$|E

25|$|The new Social Sciences Building at the University of Ottawa is the university’s latest green initiative. The fifteen-storey {{building}} that took {{about four years}} of planning and construction to complete opened its doors in September 2012. The Social Sciences Building that cost {{a grand total of}} $112.5 million provides students and faculty with an array of space for individual studying and group work. This building is the newest addition to the University of Ottawa with its green and sustainable architecture and facilities. This building is very different among the rest of the university’s buildings as its structure and characteristics are very eco-friendly. Some features that the building includes are: construction materials that were chosen due to their recycled content, a living wall that is five stories tall and composed of numerous plants that with act as an <b>air</b> <b>filtration</b> system, and a green roof. The green wall is the tallest living biofilter wall in North America. The wall is situated in the main agora of the Faculty of Social Science building and is visible from the outside. The green wall is a unique component of the building’s air handling system, for it is capable of treating a large quantity of air at a time, and it provides a source of humidity that doesn’t need to be artificially introduced.|$|E

2500|$|Various {{practices}} can {{be followed}} to mitigate mold issues in buildings, {{the most important}} of which is to reduce moisture levels that can facilitate mold growth. Properly functioning air conditioning (AC) units are essential to controlling levels of indoor airborne fungal spores. <b>Air</b> <b>filtration</b> reduces the number of spores available for germination, especially when a High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter is used. A properly functioning AC unit also reduces the relative humidity, or the moisture inherent in the air. [...] The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) currently recommends that relative humidity be maintained between 30% to 50% to preempt mold growth. [...] Considering that fungal growth requires cellulose, plant fiber, as a food source, using building materials that do not contain cellulose is an effective method of preventing fungal growth.|$|E
