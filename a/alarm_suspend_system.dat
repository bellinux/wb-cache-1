The seismic {{damage of}} nonstructural system is severely, and has affect escaped from {{building}} and rescue. <b>Suspending</b> <b>system</b> is the typical {{one of the}} nonstructural system. This paper investigated the seismic damage of <b>suspending</b> <b>system</b> in Lushan earthquake. <b>Suspending</b> <b>system</b> of many buildings are failure, especially for the hospital and gymnasium which is used for disadvantaged group and rescue. Moreover, design of suspending systerm is lack of industrial standards, so much attention should be paid...|$|R
40|$|An electromagnetically <b>suspended</b> <b>system</b> can be {{regarded}} as a typical second order mass-spring-damping system. The system dynamic response and stability are somehow related to its PID (proportional, integral and derivative) controller feedback parameters. Although the integral feedback is largely used to eliminate its offset errors at lower frequency, the actual stiffness and damping coefficients related to PD control are vital for the accurate prediction of the <b>suspended</b> <b>system</b> responses during design stage. Numerous studies have attempted to estimate these coefficients directly or indirectly without much success. The problem is due to the frequency-dependent nature of the active magnetic bearing (AMB) system i. e. time lags in sensors, digital signal processing, amplifiers, filters, eddy current and hysteresis losses in the electromagnetic coils. This paper seeks to address this problem, by proposing a one-axis electromagnetic suspension system to simplify the measurement requirements and eliminate the possibility of control force cross-coupling capabilities. This would lead to a better understanding and a design platform for optimal vibration control strategy of <b>suspended</b> <b>system.</b> This is achieved by injecting Schroeder Phased Harmonic Sequences (SPHS), a multi-frequency test signal, to persistently excite all possible <b>suspended</b> <b>system</b> modes. By treating the system as a black box, the parameter estimation of the “actual ” stiffness and damping coefficients in the frequency domain are realised experimentally. The digitally implemented PID controller also facilitated changes on the feedback gains, and this allowed numerous system response measurements with their corresponding estimated stiffness and damping coefficients...|$|R
30|$|The rail, {{includes}} {{running and}} transverse rails that allow movement within a plane. Because the worker and the vehicle body move long distances {{in the production}} line, B-PaDY must operate over a wide workspace. To address this situation, we adopt a <b>suspended</b> <b>system</b> that moves along rails. Although a robot moving on the floor can have a greater working range, it can be affected by a rough floor surfaces or obstacles, and has difficultly in managing stairs in the work space. The bumper assembly process has a wide workspace and its corresponding floor space synchronizes with the production line. Considering these features, we selected a <b>suspended</b> <b>system.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{growth and}} {{starvation}} responses of Acanthamoeba castellanii and Hartmannella vermiformis were investigated {{in the presence}} and absence of Escherichia coli on an agar surface or within shaken suspensions. The amoebae perceived all the <b>suspended</b> <b>systems</b> to be unfavourable for growth, despite being challenged {{with high levels of}} prey, and as a consequence they exhibited a starvation response. However, the response differed between species, with A. castellanii producing characteristic cysts and H. vermiformis producing round bodies. These amoebic forms were reactivated into feeding trophozoites in the presence of bacterial aggregates, which formed in the <b>suspended</b> <b>systems</b> after 68 h of incubation. In contrast, both species of amoebae grew well in the presence of attached E. coli at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells cm 2 of agar and yielded specific growth rates of c. 0. 04 h 1. Starvation responses were induced {{at the end of the}} growth phase, and these were equivalent to those recorded in the <b>suspended</b> <b>systems.</b> We conclude that, when suspended, amoebae in the ‘floating form’ cannot feed effectively on suspended prey, and hence the starvation response is initiated. Thus the majority of amoebic feeding is via trophozoite grazing of attached bacterial prey...|$|R
40|$|Cyanobacteria have {{tremendous}} applications {{in areas such}} as production of biofuels and pharmaceutically important pigments and are used as an adsorbent for the removal of toxic metabolites. However, large scale production of Cyanobacteria is not economically feasible due to high cost involved in separation of biomass. In this context, different attachment systems have been developed for the growth of Cyanobacteria on a solid support. In this study, a simple and economical attachment system using polystyrene foam for growth of Cyanobacteria has been presented. Results clearly indicate that high biomass yield can be obtained in attached system when compared to <b>suspended</b> <b>system.</b> In attachment system, the biomass yield showed 21. 4 %, total protein content showed 29. 2 %, chlorophyll content showed 11. 1 %, and carotenoid content showed 13. 1 % increase as compared to the <b>suspended</b> <b>system.</b> The attachment system can also support the growth of Cyanobacteria in presence of copper mine waste water with concomitant removal of copper ions. These results were corroborated by COD analysis, which indicated significant reduction. Further, copper removal was high in attached system as compared to <b>suspended</b> <b>system.</b> It appears that attachment system offers protection for growing Cyanobacteria and can be effectively employed for growing Cyanobacteria in presence of waste water coming from different sources...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{the rising}} energy (and electricity) cost it is {{essential}} that an active magnetic bearing (AMB) system is operated as efficiently as possible. Frequency switching caused by an external source can cause an AMB system to operate at a higher than expected energy level and lower than expected efficiency. The {{purpose of this paper is}} therefore to investigate the impact of frequency switching (caused by an external source) on the efficiency of a fully <b>suspended</b> AMB <b>system.</b> The shaft of the fully <b>suspended</b> AMB <b>system</b> for this project is mechanically connected and driven by an induction motor and the vertical and horizontal displacements of the driven unit are controlled by means of PID controllers. The model of the fully <b>suspended</b> AMB <b>system</b> with the external fault and the process diagram used for frequency extraction during the fault condition is presented.

40|$|The {{failure of}} <b>suspended</b> ceiling <b>systems</b> {{has been one}} of the most widely {{reported}} types of nonstructural damage in building structures in past earthquakes. Despite repeated damage to such systems, there has been no systematic study of their seismic behavior beyond qualification studies for selected manufacturers. Fragility methods are used herein to characterize the behavior and vulnerability of <b>suspended</b> ceiling <b>systems.</b> Since <b>suspended</b> ceiling <b>systems</b> are not amenable to traditional structural analysis, full-scale experimental testing on an earthquake simulator was performed to obtain fragility data. The results from the full-scale testing are presented as seismic fragility curves. Four variables that affect the seismic performance of <b>suspended</b> ceiling <b>systems</b> were investigated: (1) the size and weight of tiles, (2) the use of retainer clips, (3) the use of compression posts, and (4) the physical condition of grid components. A total of six ceiling system configurations were studied using different combinations of these variables: (1) undersized tiles, (2) undersized tiles with retainer clips, (3) undersized tiles with recycled grid components, (4) normal sized tiles, (5) normal sized tiles with retainer clips, and (6) normal sized tiles without the compression post. Four limit states of response that cover most of the performance levels described in the codes and guidelines for the seismic performance of nonstructural components were defined using physical definitions of damage. Data were obtained for every limit state to compare the effect of each variable on the response of <b>suspended</b> ceiling <b>system...</b>|$|R

The anemometer measures true airspeed when suspended beneath the airplane on a long cable in regions of undisturbed air. The electrical output of the propeller driven tachometer is a sine wave, the frequency of which is proportional to true airspeed. The anemometer measures true airspeed over a range from 20 to 60 m/sec at altitudes to 3000 m, with an accuracy of + or - 0. 5 percent of full scale range. This accuracy is exclusive of errors in the recording system. The stability of the <b>suspended</b> <b>system</b> was investigated and was found adequate in the airspeed range.

As these mechanisms employ a staged process, idle <b>systems</b> can be <b>suspended.</b> For a rising number of servers, this yields a load proportional power proﬁle. Request distribution is implemented by a router device; servers report their utilisation to the router.

40|$|This review {{explores the}} use of microalgae for {{nutrient}} removal in municipal wastewater treatment, considering recent improvements {{in the understanding of}} removal mechanisms and developments of both <b>suspended</b> and non-suspended <b>systems.</b> Nutrient removal is associated to both direct and indirect uptake, with the former associated to the biomass concentration and growth environment (reactor). Importantly, direct uptake is influenced by the Nitrogen:Phosphorus content in both the cells and the surrounding wastewater, with opposite trends observed for N and P. Comparison of <b>suspended</b> and non-suspended <b>systems</b> revealed that whilst all were capable of achieving high levels of nutrient removal, only non-suspended immobilized systems could do so with reduced hydraulic retention times of less than 1 day. As microalgae are photosynthetic organisms, the metabolic processes associated with nutrient assimilation are driven by light. Optimization of light delivery remains a key area of development with examples of improved mixing in <b>suspended</b> <b>systems</b> and {{the use of}} pulsating lights to enhance light utilization and reduce costs. Recent data provide increased confidence in the use of microalgae for nutrient removal in municipal wastewater treatment, enabling effluent discharges below 1  mg L− 1 to be met whilst generating added value in terms of bioproducts for energy production or nutrient recovery. Ultimately, the review suggests that future research should focus on non-suspended systems and the determination of the added value potential. In so doing, it is predicted that microalgae systems will be significant in the delivery of the circular economy...|$|R
