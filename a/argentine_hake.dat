5000|$|The largely {{autonomous}} Fisheries Secretariat {{became a}} part of the newly established Ministry of Agriculture in 2009. The fishing sector in Argentina had been declining for years as a result of overexploitation and high discard rates; the important <b>Argentine</b> <b>hake</b> catch in particular had declined by around 70% since the mid-1990s. Yauhar offered the commercial fishing lobby the lifting of a long-standing regulation requiring the use of special fishing nets designed to free juvenile hake, citing widespread non-compliance. This concession was granted in return for stricter catch share quotas and government monitoring of fishing vessels. The difficulty of monitoring vessel movements along the vast Argentine Sea made implementation of this latter policy unfeasible, however, and by April 2010, Yauhar admitted the failure of this new policy {{from the point of view}} of conservation; the lifting of special net requirement proved a boon to the hake fishing industry, however, which saw its catch double to around 800,000 tons in the interim. The Director of the Greenpeace Oceans Campaign, Milko Schvartzman, cited lax enforcement of the catch quotas as another factor.|$|E
50|$|So {{after the}} coordinated work, the first {{fisheries}} management model based in Argentina´s ecosystem based in Golfo San Matías, Rio Negro province, was developed. This model fishery was concrete evidence {{that all this}} is possible. Since 2004, together with local companies, {{the government of the}} province of Rio Negro and the Marine Biology Institute (MBI) in San Antonio Oeste, Vida Silvestre promotes the Golfo San Matias as a model to follow.At the same time the national authorities were encouraged to back planning of the industry based on the best scientific data available, considering the sustainability of the resource as a basis for fishing. Vida Silvestre works simultaneously on informing on fishing problems, especially with hake, having campaigned towards dealing only with adult specimens (yielding fillets of over 20 cm in length) and proposals of markets for other species of fish.As to the certification, Vida Silvestre promoted a sustainable environmental alternative through a program of fishery licensing of the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC). Such licensing of fisheries aims at recognizing and favoring good fishing practices and providing a simple way for buyers and consumers to identify sustainable marine resources. In Argentina at present there are three fisheries with MSC certification: Patagonian Scallops (2006), the first scallop in the world to be thus certified, the Anchovy Sardine of Buenos Aires (2012) the world´s first such fishery to be certified (2011) and the <b>Argentine</b> <b>hake</b> (2012).

Data from these three sources were combined, with the aim of producing assessments of M. hubbsi. There was no relationship between abundance indices for Falkland Islands waters and high seas areas, suggesting little interaction between the populations in the two areas. Virtual population analysis suggested that the spawning stock biomass in Falklands waters declined from approximately 60, 000 t in 1987 to about 15, 000 t in the early 1990 s but has since made a partial recovery to approximately 20, 000 t. However, low recruitment levels are, apparently, impeding the recovery of the population.

40|$|The {{development}} of a deep-sea fishery for aristeid shrimps off Brazil is reviewed from its early days in 2002. Descriptive data were collected by observers on board 75 directed fishing trips conducted in the study period, {{with a total of}} over 15, 000 monitored trawls. An incipient fishing phase took place between No-vember 2000 and October 2002, when aristeid shrimps were occasionally reported in the bycatch of operations mostly targeting the <b>Argentine</b> <b>hake</b> (Merluccius hubbsi). After that, a directed fishery was established for these resources. All nine vessels involved in this fishery (one national and eight chartered) concentrated on 11 limited grounds between 700 and 800 m deep and 18 °S and 34 °S. The main species caught between November 2002 and May 2007 was the "carabinero" Aristaeopsis edwardsiana (456, 710 kg), followed by the "moruno" Aristaeomorpha foliácea (121, 497 kg), and then the "alistado" Aristeus antillensis (27, 919 kg). The trawlers operate in conjunction, such that the total area of each fishing ground was swept at least twice. This harvest pattern substantially reduced "carabinero" catch rates from 14 kg hour- 1 in the first sampled trimester to 4 kg hour- 1 in the last.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The recent {{development}} of deep-water fisheries off Brazil is reviewed from biological, eco-nomic, and political perspectives. This {{process has been}} centered in the southeastern and southern sectors of the Brazilian coast (19 °- 34 °S) and was motivated by the overfishing of the main coastal resources and a gov-ernment-induced vessel-chartering program. Shelf break (100 - 250 m) operations by national hook-and-line and trawl vessels intensified in the 1990 s. Around 2000 - 2001, however, foreign-chartered longliners, gillnet-ters, potters, and trawlers started to operate in Brazilian waters, leading the occupation of the upper slope (250 - 500 m), mostly targeting monkfish (Lophyus gastrophysus), the <b>Argentine</b> <b>hake</b> (Merluccius hubbsi), the Bra-zilian codling (Urophycis mystacea), the wreckfish (Polyprion americanus), the Argentine short-fin squid (Illex argentinus), the red crab (Chaceon notialis), and the royal crab (Chaceon ramosae). Between 2004 and 2007, chartered trawlers established a valuable fishery on deep-water shrimps (family Aristeidae), heavily ex-ploiting the lower slope (500 - 1000 m). Total catches of deep-water resources varied annually from 5, 756 ton in 2000 {{to a maximum of}} 19, 923 ton in 2002, decreasing to nearly 11, 000 ton in 2006.

Mean values and anomalies of bottom temperatures and salinity fields were determined. The most extreme positive thermal anomalies occurred in 1999 and 2000, whereas 1996 was the coldest year. The salinity anomaly was lowest in 1996 and highest in 2000. <b>Argentine</b> <b>hake</b> was found mainly in thermal and saline gradient zones.

40|$|AbstractThe <b>Argentine</b> <b>hake</b> Merluccius hubbsi {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{commercial}} resources of the Southwest Atlantic region, with a reported catch of 259, 202 tons in 2014. Hake recruitment shows high interannual variability, yet the environmental and biological factors that influence reproduction are not fully understood. The increasing availability of ocean color data presents an opportunity to investigate a wide variety of fundamental topics including ocean primary productivity, climate change, and fisheries, among others. However, differences in the timing, length, and radiometer characteristics of the different missions result in a number of relatively short data records that are not suitable, individually, for the analysis of interdecadal changes. The combination of these datasets to produce longer time series of consistent data is essential for interpreting variability and trends in key parameters. We analyzed almost 5 years of high spatial resolution overlapping data from the SeaWiFS and MODIS Aqua sensors in the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean to assess differences in chlorophyll concentration retrievals, estimate uncertainties, and develop corrections. Data from SeaWiFS (1997 – 2006) and corrected MODIS (2007 – 2015) were analyzed jointly as a > 17 -year time series of consistent and continuous chlorophyll concentration data, the longest record to date in the region. Trend analyses performed in the main spawning and nursery areas of M. hubbsi revealed significant increases in chlorophyll concentrations since 1997. The environmental factors likely influencing the observed changes and the potential implications for recruitment of M. hubbsi are discussed...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the first}} {{detailed}} study on the age and growth of the <b>Argentine</b> <b>hake</b> Merluccius hubbsi in Brazilian waters. A total of 3, 651 specimens obtained from surveys and sampling landings using trawlers and long-lines in the South-Southeast Region (21 ºS to 34 ºS) between 1996 and 2001 were analyzed. Readings of sliced and burned otoliths were conducted on 686 individuals (397 females, 129 males and 160 young - sex not identified), identifying opaque and translucent zones. Marginal increment and edge type percentage methods were used for validation, resulting in one ring per year, formed during summer-autumn. Fish {{with no more than}} eight rings and six years of age were found, the two first rings after the core being formed during the first year. Back-calculation methods were applied to length/age data and the parameters of von Bertalanffy's growth model were fitted based on average length per ring. The value of maximum theoretical length varied between 470. 27 mm and 807. 40 mm; growth coefficient varied from 0. 1657 to 0. 3555 year- 1 and the theoretical age at length zero between - 1. 2846 and - 0. 4552 years. Growth of females and males differed significantly. The techniques applied and the results obtained are discussed and compared with studies on hake conducted in Uruguay and Argentina, providing important information for the management of the species in Brazil, where it presents clear signs of overexploitation...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, the mislabelling of seafood {{products}} {{has come to}} prominence {{in the fields of}} food science and marine conservation. This study aims to determine whether differences in fish labelling accuracy can be explained by factors associated with governance, legislation and product availability, using cod (Gadus spp.) as a case study. A total of 401 cod products from a range of different supermarket retailers in each of nine countries bordering the North Atlantic Ocean were purchased and genetically identified. The countries sampled were grouped into primarily cod-importing or cod-producing states, and belonging/not-belonging to the European Union. They comprised the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Estonia, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Canada. Estonia showed the highest incidence of mislabelling, with 59. 4 % samples mislabelled, followed by Denmark with 18. 6 %, Canada with 7. 3 %, Sweden with 4. 4 % and finally the United Kingdom with 2. 4 %. Substitute species included species within the Gadidae and Merlucciidae, such as haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), Alaskan pollock (Gadus chalcogrammus) and <b>Argentine</b> <b>hake</b> (Merluccius hubbsi), respectively, but also included species more distantly-related to cod, such as snailfish (Liparis spp.), spotted wolffish (Anarhichas minor) and yellow perch (Perca flavescens), the latter a freshwater species. The remaining countries showed no mislabelling. Neither EU affiliation, production nor the type of product, i. e. fresh or processed, had a significant effect on mislabelling. It is suggested that other factors, such as country-specific differences at social, cultural or legal levels, may be the greater drivers of mislabelling...|$|E
40|$|The {{influences}} of age, size, and condition of spawning females on fecundity and oocyte quality were analyzed for the Patagonian stock of <b>Argentine</b> <b>Hake</b> (Merluccius hubbsi). Samples of mature females {{were collected in}} the spawning area as part of 2 research surveys conducted in January 2010 and 2011, during {{the peak of the}} reproductive season. Batch fecundity (BF) ranged between 40, 500 (29 cm total length [TL]) and 2, 550, 000 (95 cm TL) hydrated oocytes, and was positively correlated with TL, gutted weight, age, hepatosomatic index (HSI), and the relative condition factor (Kn). Relative fecundity ranged between 85 and 1040 hydrated oocytes g– 1 and showed significant positive relationships with gutted weight, HSI, and Kn; however, coefficients of determination were low for all regressions. Dry weights of samples of 100 hydrated oocytes ranged between 1. 8 and 3. 95 mg and were positively correlated with all variables analyzed, including batch and relative fecundity. Multiple regression models created with data of the morphophysiological characteristics of females supported maternal influences on fecundity and egg weights. Within the studied size range (29 – 95 cm TL), larger individuals had better somatic and egg condition, mainly revealed by higher HSI and hydrated oocytes with larger oil droplets (275. 71 μm [standard error 1. 49]). These results were associated with the higher feeding activity of larger females during the spawning season in comparison with the feeding activity of young individuals (< 5 years old); the better nutritional state of larger females, assumed to result from more feeding, was conducive to greater production of high-quality eggs...|$|E
40|$|Peale's dolphin, Lagenorhynchus australis, is {{a common}} but little known species from {{southern}} South America. A {{review of the literature}} produced several observations of feeding behaviour, but only four reports on the examination of stomach contents of this species; all four were from the east coast of the continent in the southern South Atlantic. The seven animals sampled had fed on Argentine shrimp (Pleoticus muelleri), small octopus, three species of squid (Loligo gahi; Illex argentinus), kingklip fish (Genypterus blacodes), <b>Argentine</b> <b>hake</b> (Merluccius hubbsi) and southern cod (Salilota australis). These species are common in the waters of the Patagonian shelf. We report on further observations on dolphin feeding during regular shore-based studies along the central Strait of Magellan and on nine specimens from Tiera del Fuego, seven from the northeastern Atlantic coast and two young animals from the northeastern coast of the Beagle Channel. All nine animals probably died incidentally in shore-based nets set for Patagonian blenny (Eleginops maclovinus). We found at least 15 taxa represented in the stomach contents: eight species of fish, three of cephalopods, one bivalve mollusc, two crustaceans and one species of salp. The salps had been taken by the youngest dolphins, which also had milk in their stomachs. The most important prey species were bottom fish: hagfish (Myxine australis), southern cod (Salilota australis) and Patagonian grenadier (Macruronus magellanicus), followed by the red octopus (Enteroctopus megalocyathus) and Patagonian squid (L. gahi). The remaining species, among others Sprattus fuegensis and Illex argentinus, were marginal or perhaps items ingested by the other actual prey species. The feeding ecology of Peale's dolphin off northeastern Tierra del Fuego seems to be associated with demersal and bottom species captured in or near kelp beds...|$|E
40|$|The {{relative}} abundance and fishing {{potential of the}} commercially valuable fishes and cephalopods with marketable size was assessed using two seasonal bottom trawl surveys performed in 2001 and 2002 on the outer shelf and upper slope (100 - 600 m depth) {{off the coast of}} southern Brazil. These surveys were part of REVIZEE, a national program designed to assess the fishery potential within the Economic Exclusive Zone. Of the 228 fish and cephalopod species caught during the surveys, only 27 species and genera were considered to be of commercial interest. Commercial-sized individuals of these species made up 52. 3 % of the total catch. The total biomass was estimated to be 167, 193 ton (± 22 %) and 165, 460 ton (± 25 %) in the winter-spring and summer-autumn surveys, respectively. The most abundant species were the Argentine short-fin squid Illex argentinas, a species with highly variable recruitment, followed by the <b>Argentine</b> <b>hake</b> Merluccius hubbsi, the gulf-hake Urophycis mystacea, and the monkfish Lophius gastrophysus. The latter three were intensively fished prior to the surveys, as well as the beardfish Polymixia lowei and silvery John dory Zenopsis conchifera, both relatively abundant but with a very low market value. The potential yield of the demersal fish species, not considering Illex argentinus, estimated with the Gulland equation for a mean natural mortality of M = 0. 31, was 20, 460 ton. When considering only Merluccius hubbsi, Urophycis mystacea, and Lophius gastrophysus, the potential yield decreased to 6, 625 ton. The surveys showed that the fishery potential of the outer shelf and upper slope was substantially lower than that of the inner shelf. Therefore, this environment should be carefully monitored to avoid overfishing and fast depletion...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Argentine</b> <b>hake</b> (Merluccius hubbsi) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} fishery resources in the Southwest Atlantic. This species is widely distributed in the Patagonian shelf area and it is a major target species by international fleets in this South West Atlantic area. This paper presents results on the spatio-temporal distribution pattern of hake M. hubbsi abundance and environmental influence in the Patagonian shelf area. Spanish commercial fisheries data from 1989 to 1999 were used in the analysis. Data were collected by observers deployed by the IEO, Vigo (Instituto Español de Oceanografía, Vigo). The data include 15343 fishing haul records. CPUE (Catch Per Unit Effort, kg⋅hr- 1) was used as an abundance index. The analyses of the general spatio-temporal pattern of fish abundance, and the influence of environmental factors, such as SST, SBT, depth, moon phase and cloud cover, on fish abundance and distribution, were based on correlation, variograms, and timeseries maps created using GIS. Hake-targeted fishing by Spanish fleets was mainly focused on the shelf-edge area between 44. 5 °S – 47. 0 °S outside the Argentinean EEZ and in the area northwest of the Falkland Islands. The centre of high abundance is located in the shelf-edge area between 44. 5 °S – 47. 0 °S, particularly in the west part (i. e. in shallower waters) and in winter. The correlations between fish abundance and cloud cover are overwhelming negative, indicating that higher catches usually occur in cloudy weather conditions. In the major hake-targeted fishing area between 44. 5 °S – 47. 0 °S, the negative relationship between fish abundance and sea surface temperature in most months may suggest that high fish abundance is related to the strong northward cold Falklands current, and abundance is positively related to sea depth in summer...|$|E

North American Association of Fisheries Economists (NAAFE), Corvallis, 2017. While rights-based management is generally purported enhance economic efficiency in fisheries and reduce over-capitalization, {{the social and}} economic outcomes due to this regulatory regime are less comprehensively understood. Relatively recently, industrialized and export-oriented Latin American fisheries began adopting individual transferable quota (ITQ) regimes to recover collapsed fish stocks. While these programs tend to follow standard, Western approaches to ITQ design and implementation, Argentina experimented with a new design model by interjecting social and ecological objectives into ITQ design through the creation of Artisanal and Social Quota reserves and through determining initial allocation based on historical vessel landings, employment, at-sea and on-land production, investment, historical landings across species, and record of fishery violations. In 2010, Argentina established ITQs for four commercially important and export-oriented fisheries: <b>Argentine</b> <b>hake</b> (Merluccius hubbsi), Patagonian grenadier (Macruronus magellanicus), Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides), and southern blue whiting (Micromesistius australis). The first part of this study, to be presented, is a comprehensive institutional analysis of the ITQ fishery management program in Argentina to preliminarily evaluate how configurations of rights-based managed influence social, economic, and ecological outcomes in regulated fisheries. This paper analyzes legislative documents and government data on program design, vessel landings, and participation in the ITQ program from 2000 - 2016, to evaluate how program design, specifically initial allocation and trading restrictions, potentially influences fishery outcomes. The results of this study are broadly applicable to understanding how the design of rights-based management regimes influence compliance behavior, social equity, and economic efficiency outcomes in developing country fisheries...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Argentine</b> <b>hake,</b> Merluccius hubbsi, a demersal-pelagic species found from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to the Tierra del Fuego, Argentina, {{has become}} an {{important}} target of the Brazilian bottom-trawler fleet since 2001. Earlier studies focusing on the species have suggested {{that more than one}} stock might occur off the Brazilian coast, in accordance with environmental features. In order to evaluate this hypothesis, fish were collected from four different areas in the Brazilian waters in which the hake is distributed, during the summers and winters of 1996 - 2001 and 2004, the females being used to analyze and compare spatial-temporal variations in ovarian maturation. Gonad indexes were also applied for the same purpose. Results indicate a north-south spawning gradient occurring as from summer at around 21 °S to winter near 34 °S, leading to the identification of two distinct stocks: one located between 21 °S and 29 °S (Southeastern stock) and the other between 29 °S and 34 °S (Southern stock), this latter shared with Uruguay and Argentina. Brazilian stocks present clear signs of overexploitation, the situation calling for an urgent solution. A merluza Merluccius hubbsi, espécie demerso-pelágica distribuída desde o Rio de Janeiro, Brasil, até a Terra do Fogo, Argentina, tornou-se alvo das frotas de arrasto de fundo da região Sudeste-Sul do Brasil desde 2001. Estudos anteriores sobre a biologia da espécie sugeriram a existência de mais de um estoque em águas brasileiras, relacionados a características ambientais. Para verificar esta hipótese, exemplares oriundos de quatro áreas em águas brasileiras foram coletados durante o verão e o inverno nos períodos 1996 - 2001 e 2004, sendo as fêmeas utilizadas para analisar variações espaço-temporais na maturação gonadal. Para corroborar estas análises também foram aplicados índices gonadais. Os resultados mostraram a ocorrência de um gradiente norte-sul para a desova, que é mais intenso no verão em 21 °S e no inverno em 34 °S. Foram identificados dois estoques: um denominado Sudeste, que se distribui entre 21 °S- 29 °S, e outro Sul, entre 29 °S- 34 °S, este último compartilhado com o Uruguai e a Argentina.

Se evaluó la abundancia relativa y el potencial pesquero de peces y cefalópodos de especies y tamaños de valor comercial en dos muéstreos estacionales con redes de arrastre de fondo realizados en los años 2001 y 2002 sobre la plataforma externa y talud superior, 100 a 600 m de profundidad, a lo largo del extremo sur de la costa brasilera, como parte de un programa nacional de evaluación del potencial pesquero de la Zona Económica Exclusiva (Programa REVIZEE).
