5|$|A major {{accident}} occurred <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> in August 1931. The paddle steamer E.R.O. struck the lift {{span of the}} bridge. The span had not been raised to a high enough level, causing it to clip {{the top of the}} steamer's funnel and rip apart the upper deck. High pressure steam was released during the accident causing some onlookers to believe the boat was on fire. It was at first thought the captain would be found amongst the wreckage of the upper deck, but he had been navigating the boat from the lower deck at that time. The captain displayed considerable skill; he immediately realised that further raising of the span despite being given the all clear meant it was not quite high enough. And through his actions as the boat progressed downstream caught in the current, he prevented the boat becoming stuck <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge,</b> Frost's forces {{continued}} to hold but without supply or reinforcement their position was becoming weaker. The Germans—realising that infantry attacks were unlikely to remove the stubborn defenders—began to systematically destroy the houses the British were in using tanks, artillery and mortars. In {{the absence of any}} Allied air cover, the Luftwaffe were able to make strafing runs on the British occupied houses as well.|$|E

5|$|Elsewhere, about 150 men {{landed at}} Cape Murro di Porco and {{captured}} a radio station. Based on a warning of imminent glider landings transmitted by the station's previous occupants, the local Italian commander ordered a counter-attack but his troops {{failed to get}} the message. The scattered nature of the landings now worked in the brigade's favour as {{they were able to}} cut all telephone wires in the immediate area. Forces <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> came under repeated attacks from the Italians while the expected 5th Infantry Division relief did not appear at 10:00 as planned. By 15:30 only 15 of men <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> remained fit to fight and they were out of ammunition, as a result the Italians then recaptured the bridge. The first unit from the 5th Division, the 2nd Northamptonshire Regiment of the 17th Brigade, arrived <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> at 16:15 and mounted a successful counterattack. The prior removal of demolition charges from the bridge had prevented the Italians from destroying it. The brigade then took no further part in the fighting and was withdrawn back to North Africa on 13 July. During the landings in Sicily, the losses by the 1st Airlanding Brigade were the worst of all the British units involved so far. They amounted to 313 killed and 174 missing or wounded. The accompanying glider pilots lost 14 killed, and a further 87 were missing or wounded.|$|E
5|$|Major Tatham-Warter {{was able}} to escape German captivity and later led nearly 140 men to safety in Operation Pegasus. Upon his return to England he wrote {{a report on the}} action <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge,</b> which led to Grayburn's posthumous {{promotion}} to captain and the award of the Victoria Cross.|$|E

5|$|With no {{word from}} the {{division}} or brigade Lieutenant-Colonel Frost assumed command of the brigade units <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b> With their casualties mounting and supplies of food and ammunition running low, a request for the force to surrender was rejected by Frost, who decided they would fight on.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{accidents}} took place <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> over the years, with vessels colliding with the piers {{due to the}} hazardous nature of the waterway. In 1960, two river barges hit one of the piers on the bridge, causing two spans to collapse into the river. Repair work was under consideration when a similar collision occurred the following year, after which {{it was decided that}} it would be uneconomical to repair the bridge. It was demolished between 1967 and 1970, with few traces remaining.|$|E
5|$|According to Di Carlo, {{the remains}} of De Mauro were buried under a bridge over the Oreto river near Palermo. However, the police, after a search, did not find the body. The pentito Francesco Marino Mannoia later {{explained}} why. He had been ordered by Bontade in 1977 or 1978 to dig up several bodies <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> and dissolve them in acid. According to the new testimony of the pentito Naimo, De Mauro {{was taken to a}} terrain in Pallavicino neighbourhood in Palermo where the Mafia boss Francesco Madonia owned a chicken farm. He was killed there and dumped in a pit.|$|E

5|$|By day four, 20September, {{the brigade}} still holding out <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> had {{been split into}} two groups during the night by the Germans who had managed to {{infiltrate}} close enough to separate them into positions east and west of the bridge road. Any movement was subjected to machine-gun and sniper fire and they were under almost constant mortar and artillery attack. Added to this were probes by tanks and self propelled guns, which approached the defenders' buildings and opened fire at point blank range. The brigade, out of anti-tank ammunition, could do nothing to stop them in the east, but the 6pounders in the west still proved an effective deterrent. During the day, Lieutenant John Grayburn of the 2nd Battalion was killed and later posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for his bravery during the fighting <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b> That morning, communications with 1st Airborne Division were established and Frost, on asking for reinforcements and supplies, was informed that the division was surrounded at Oosterbeek and the brigade was on their own. Frost was later wounded and command of the brigade assumed by Major Frederick Gough of the reconnaissance squadron. By midday the brigade position was untenable and the last defenders were withdrawn into {{what had been the}} Headquarters Company, 2nd Battalion's position. By nightfall they were still holding out, and in the darkness some men tried unsuccessfully to break out. At dawn on day five, {{what was left of the}} brigade was forced to surrender.|$|E
5|$|By now, the {{division}} {{was too weak}} to attempt to reach Frost <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b> Of the nine infantry battalions, only one (1st Battalion, The Border Regiment) still existed as a unit, the rest were badly mauled or scattered. Urquhart made the difficult decision to form a defensive perimeter around Oosterbeek, abandoning the 2nd Parachute Battalion. By securing the Driel Ferry Crossing, Urquhart hoped to hold out until XXX Corps could reach them and establish a new bridgehead over the Rhine using the ferry crossing platforms.|$|E
5|$|The {{corncrake}} {{can be seen}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> of Banagher in the summer. Once {{a common}} summer visitor to Ireland, corncrakes have suffered drastic population declines {{over the last few}} decades and are threatened with global extinction. Conservation efforts have focused on changing harvesting times to avoid the nesting season, May to August. The hay meadows of the callows support large numbers of these birds – {{one of the few places}} in the world where this globally threatened species is still common.|$|E

5|$|The {{sport was}} first {{developed}} at a bridge located in Ashdown Forest, {{close to the}} village of Upper Hartfield, East Sussex, England. Built in 1907 and originally called Posingford Bridge, it is considered to be the bridge on which Milne and his son first played the game. However, it is uncertain whether the sport was first played <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> then written into the story, or vice versa. The bridge maintained the public's interest and a campaign to rebuild it in the late seventies was considered important enough to feature on the BBC NineO'Clock News. The bridge was subsequently reopened by Christopher Robin Milne and officially renamed as Poohsticks Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Those {{men of the}} 1st Parachute Brigade {{that landed}} on the {{southern}} drop zone were well within range of the 1st Fallschirmjäger Machine Gun Battalion. In the darkness, the Germans initially thought that the paratroopers were their own reinforcements landing, but they soon realised their mistake and opened fire. Some of those who escaped the machine gun fire were rounded up on the drop zone, and about 100of them became prisoners of war {{as soon as they}} had touched ground. In the confusion of the landing, 50 men of the 1st Parachute Battalion had assembled, assaulted and managed to capture the bridge before the 50 Italian defenders could destroy it with the attached demolition charges. The Italians were taken prisoner, just as a second group of 40 paratroopers led by Brigadier Lathbury arrived <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b> Lathbury organised the safe removal of the demolition charges and set up a defensive perimeter. More paratroopers continued to gather <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge,</b> and soon they numbered around 120men, who dug in to the north and south.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the morning, the Germans mopped up British {{survivors}} and stragglers in hiding around Arnhem bridge. It took several hours {{to clear the}} bridge of debris allowing German armour to cross and reinforce Nijmegen. Crucially, the British had held the bridge long enough to allow Nijmegen bridge to be captured by the 82nd Airborne and Guards' Armoured Division working together. With the resistance <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> crushed, the Germans had more troops available to commit to the Oosterbeek engagement, although this changed suddenly in the afternoon.|$|E

5|$|A lucky break allowed 3rd Battalion to ambush {{the staff}} car {{carrying}} Generalmajor Friedrich Kussin, the German commandant of Arnhem, {{and kill him}} and his driver. Nevertheless, most of the battalion had been stopped by the Germans in Oosterbeek while 'C' Company had entered Arnhem but were halted on the road leading to the bridge. At 15:30 the 1st Parachute Battalion were released from the reserve and directed along the Ede-Arnhem road. Here they first encountered German armoured vehicles and a column of five tanks and fifteen half-tracks, which were engaged by the battalion. They continued fighting their way forward, and by morning had reached the outskirts of Arnhem. By this time around {{a quarter of the}} battalion had been killed, wounded or were missing. Before this, at nightfall, Brigadier Lathbury had contacted Lieutenant-Colonel Frost in command <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> and informed him the brigade would stay put during the night and attempt to reach him in the morning.|$|E
5|$|After the {{parachute}} brigade withdrew, the Axis forces gathered <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge.</b> They now comprised the Italian 372nd Coastal Battalion and the Arditi Battalion, with the German 1st Fallschirmjäger Machine Gun Battalion and Captain Stangenberg's Battle group. The German High Command {{was aware of}} the importance of holding the bridge, and overnight they dispatched reinforcements who arrived by parachute. These came from the 1st Fallschirmjäger Division, and consisted of the 1st Fallschirmjäger Engineer Battalion, the 1st Battalion, 4th Fallschirmjäger Regiment and a battalion of the 1st Fallschirmjäger Artillery Regiment. The Fallschirmjäger engineers started to form a defensive line to the north of the bridge, and a smaller one on the southern bank.|$|E
5|$|An {{extension}} is also {{planned for}} the A5 motorway north of Osijek, across the Drava River, to the Hungarian border, where it will connect to the Hungarian M6 motorway at a Branjin Vrh/Ivándárda border crossing. This route will also contain two new exits near Čeminac and Beli Manastir and a new bridge over the Drava River. In July 2011, a groundbreaking ceremony was held <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>bridge</b> construction site, as a preparation for extension of the A5. In May 2012, Hrvatske autocestethe investor in the construction works contractproposed cancellation of the construction works as a cost-cutting measure, even though funding of the works was secured through European Investment Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development loans.|$|E
