40|$|In this paper, we empirically studied passengers’ modal-choice {{behaviors}} to access an international <b>hub</b> <b>airport</b> from local areas. Through {{the data collected}} by using stated preference method and constructing binomial logit model, we found that passengers’ modal choices were affected by the level of service variables of access modes, such as travel time, travel cost, waiting time at <b>hub</b> <b>airports</b> and scheduled delay cost. Furthermore, an increase in frequency would reduce waiting time at <b>hub</b> <b>airports.</b> However, when passengers chose available access modes to <b>hub</b> <b>airports</b> in advance provided that the departure time was fixed, they especially considered the timing of departure from home and the timing of arrival at the airport (that is, convenience of schedule), as well as frequency of access modes. We also calculated the value of scheduled delay.

40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of global civil aviation industry, {{the significance of}} non-aeronautical revenue has become increasingly evident from the 1990 s. Nowadays, many airports are focusing on being more creative with non-aeronautical revenue. According to the latest statistics, the world’s non-aeronautical revenue occupies about 45. 8 % of the total revenue with 7. 2 % of the annual rate of growth, (ACI, 2015). Therefore, to examine the significant role of the non-aeronautical activities for international <b>hub</b> <b>airports</b> in a multi-view, thus to make practical recommendations accordingly will be worthy for the future development of these airports. This study consists of methods of literature review, case study, survey, and professional interview. Through carrying out a desktop research by literature review to gain an insight into current world’s non-aeronautical activities. And through a case study to reveal the current situation of worldwide international <b>hub</b> <b>airports</b> in a large extent, {{which is based on}} the historical statistics of six target at-grade international <b>hub</b> <b>airports</b> worldwide. Moreover, by conducting a passenger survey in HKIA to gain an insight into the current situation of passenger satisfaction in international <b>hub</b> <b>airports.</b> And by conducting two professional interviews to gain an in-depth understanding of the current situation of non-aeronautical activities in international <b>hub</b> <b>airports,</b> and the views also is a guidance for making relevant recommendations.

40|$|Airports {{have stepped}} beyond {{the stage of}} being simply pure {{infrastructure}} facilities. <b>Hub</b> <b>airports</b> in particular are considered to function as supra-regional and international gateway infrastructure thus having a decisive impact on firms' competitiveness and stimulating urban development. <b>Hub</b> <b>airports</b> have ? through their capability of concentrating different types of flows, from local to global ? morphed into strategic nodes within the networked economy. Recent studies indicate that <b>hub</b> <b>airports</b> increasingly {{play a significant role}} for multi-branch multi-location firms with their decision making process about where to locate. Successively, knowledge-intensive companies have settled their regional, national and sometimes supranational branches in close spatial proximity to primary and secondary airports. Simultaneously to their enhanced functionality, <b>hub</b> <b>airports</b> in Europe are increasingly recognized as general urban activity centres; that is, key assets for cities and regions as economic generators and catalysts of investment, in addition to being critical components of efficient city infrastructure. <b>Hub</b> <b>airports</b> thus represent ? against the backdrop of knowledge intensive firms optimizing physical and relational proximity within their knowledge generation efforts ? a crucial case where new urban functionalities co-produce new emerging urban patterns and vice-versa. The paper will shed light on the following questions: Which role does the knowledge generation process of firms and their respective locational needs play for geographical and relational proximity? What role does the <b>hub</b> <b>airport</b> represent within the value chains of knowledge-intensive companies? What role does an airport assume within a multi-branch firm's decision-making process about locating activities? The paper reflects the empirical results of a research project that compares the firm location behavior at the airports of Amsterdam, Munich, Dusseldorf and Frankfurt. We conclude with some recommendations on how airport-linked real estate sites need to be planned in order to reach certain robustness towards the constantly changing spatial needs of its users...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} links between {{domestic}} market regulation, dominant airline performance, and international market liberalization in Northeast Asia (NEA). The study focuses on China, where substantial regulations are still present in the aviation market, particularly {{in areas such as}} route entry, airport slot allocation, input supply, and aviation support services. These regulations limit the ability of entrant airlines to compete in <b>hub</b> <b>airports,</b> and allow dominant airlines to strengthen their market power and achieve substantial growth at the expense of their competitors. Current Chinese regulations assist major state-owned carriers by suppressing domestic competition, particularly in markets linked to <b>hub</b> <b>airports.</b> If national policy in China continues to be guided by requirements created to support the dominant airlines, in the short term there will be limited liberalization on routes linked with <b>hub</b> <b>airports.</b> Promoting LCC services in the region is one practical alternative for the short term which could prevent major disruption to network carriers. This investigation suggests that Chinese airlines would be less resistant to bilateral liberalization with ASEAN, Oceanian or European nations than they would with other regions, as they are well positioned in these markets, and may be able to develop their <b>hub</b> <b>airports</b> into Asia's gateways to Europe. In the long term, however, {{there is no substitute for}} full liberalization if NEA governments want their nations to fully benefit from enabling their carriers and <b>hub</b> <b>airports</b> to achieve global competitiveness...|$|R
50|$|Airline <b>hubs</b> or <b>hub</b> <b>airports</b> {{are used}} {{by one or more}} {{airlines}} to concentrate passenger traffic and flight operations at a given airport. They serve as transfer (or stop-over) points to get passengers to their final destination. It is part of the hub-and-spoke system. An airline operates flights from several non-hub (spoke) cities to the <b>hub</b> <b>airport,</b> and passengers traveling between spoke cities need to connect through the hub. This paradigm creates economies of scale that allow an airline to serve (via an intermediate connection) city-pairs that could otherwise not be economically served on a non-stop basis. This system contrasts with the point-to-point model, in which there are no hubs and nonstop flights are instead offered between spoke cities. <b>Hub</b> <b>airports</b> also serve origin and destination (O&D) traffic.|$|R

40|$|The {{aviation}} {{industry in the}} African region, in order {{to compete with the}} global market, is exploring and actively pursing expansion either through strategic alliances or by adopting the hub and spoke (H&S) network development. Hubbing has the major benefits of consolidating passengers, thus increasing frequency of travel while increasing accessibility and improving the economies of scale to operate the service. The African region is vast and is characterised by sparse passenger demand; therefore, the decisions made in locating <b>airports</b> as <b>hubs</b> pose a challenge. This paper aims to explore the use of the multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) tools as a method of choosing <b>hub</b> <b>airports.</b> The reason why the MCDA tools are most appropriate is because choosing a <b>hub</b> <b>airport</b> is a complex decision which has to take into account various issues like: network costs, infrastructure costs, security, economic viability, safety, passenger travel time expenditure, etc. The various tools, processes and methodologies used in decision making theory are explored and applied in order to choose <b>hub</b> <b>airports</b> with the lowest transport costs in an efficient H&S network. The major findings in this study show that because Africa has a sparse network, with a few role players, the choice in hub location options relies greatly on the cost of routing passengers through the <b>hub</b> <b>airport.</b> MCDA is shown to be a useful tool whose only limitation is maintaining the uniformity of weighting the criteria for the whole region...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the economic regulation of a <b>hub</b> European <b>airport</b> and the relationship system between actors involved in, or subjected to, this regulation. Studying the case of Aéroports de Paris, {{it is argued that}} airport economic regulation is produced by the strong conjunction of interests between the <b>hub</b> <b>airport’s</b> operator, the dominant airline, and public authorities. These three categories of actors form an “iron triangle ” framing and shaping the terms of economic regulation to satisfy their interests, and the shift from a cost-plus to a price-cap regulation does not dramatically threaten the maintenance of the triangle. All other actors (nondominant, domestic airlines, and international air carriers) are excluded from the iron triangle even if they remain deeply affected by its decisions. Finally, this article calls for an analytical generalization of this theorization for semiprivatized European <b>hub</b> <b>airports...</b>|$|R
