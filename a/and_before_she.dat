25|$|Later, {{the scandal}} behind P.J. {{is that in}} order to receive his trust fund he must marry before he turns 28 years old, and so he proposes to Naomi, unbeknownst to her. Annie finds out about the clause and tells P.J. to come clean to Naomi, which he is about to but {{chickens}} out and ask if she will take his last name instead of saying what he should have. Annie and the girls are with Naomi at a wedding dress store and Annie tells Naomi about P.J's secret. As Naomi learns the truth, she breaks off the engagement. While Dixon is away, Austin returns to town and suggests that Adrianna should start a country music career with his help. Adrianna accepts his offer.

This causes a dramatic turn, as both Liam and Navid want to be with Silver. A fight breaks out between Liam and Navid during the premiere of Liam's new movie. As a result, Silver decides to side with Navid. Meanwhile, Naomi is the event planner for a young woman named Madison who is enthused by her upcoming nuptials.

500|$|In {{the fourth}} {{episode of the}} eighth series, Oleg Darshavin, who {{had been one of}} Lucas's interrogators in Russia, {{approaches}} him for help in stopping a planned bombing by Sudanese extremists; Lucas takes the case despite Harry's suspicion that he developed Stockholm syndrome during his captivity. Harry's suspicions are solidified when Lucas goes off-piste, but ultimately, Lucas is able to bring Darshavin in and takes him into FSB custody after uncovering his involvement in the plot, while Ros stops the bomb. During the same series, Lucas conducts an affair with CIA liaison Sarah Caufield (Genevieve O'Reilly), who is later revealed to be an operative of [...] "Nightingale", a multinational shadow organisation bent on a New World Order. When he discovers this and confronts Sarah about her involvement, she flees. She returns in the series eight finale, <b>and</b> <b>before</b> <b>she</b> is assassinated, she reveals that Nightingale is attempting to provoke a nuclear war between India and Pakistan.

500|$|McDermott {{said his}} character, Ryan Malloy, [...] "probably {{would have the}} balls to kill Archie" [...] {{and it would be}} a {{possibility}} due to the character's past, although he accused Janine of the murder, making it unlikely unless he was [...] "quite conniving." [...] He stated Ryan's only motive would be out of love for Janine. Glynis Barber, who plays Archie's first wife Glenda Mitchell and was not seen in the programme until after the murder, said her instinct was that Glenda did not kill Archie, even though she had been told it was possible. Bradley Branning's motive came from the discovery that Archie raped his partner Stacey, and Clements said that if other characters knew, it would give Bradley a motive and the fact that Bradley punched Archie would make him a prime suspect. He stated that he hoped Bradley was not the killer, though in an interview with daytime television show This Morning, he stated it would be [...] "quite historical to go down as the one who killed Archie Mitchell". The rape also gave Stacey a motive, <b>and</b> <b>before</b> <b>she</b> was sectioned in 2009 for bipolar disorder she accused Archie of trying to kill her. Jack Branning's motive came from his love for Ronnie and hatred of Archie, and he threatened Archie on Christmas Day. Maslen said it would be [...] "great" [...] if Jack was the murderer, but added that he may have taken the blame if Ronnie was guilty. Other possible suspects included Peggy's son Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp), Billy Mitchell and Tracey the barmaid (Jane Slaughter). Slaughter said Tracey's only motive would be to protect The Queen Victoria or one of the Mitchells.|$|E

2500|$|The {{founders of}} Gestalt therapy, Fritz and Laura Perls, {{had worked with}} Kurt Goldstein, a {{neurologist}} who had applied principles of Gestalt psychology to {{the functioning of the}} organism. Laura Perls had been a Gestalt psychologist before she became a psychoanalyst <b>and</b> <b>before</b> <b>she</b> began developing Gestalt therapy together with Fritz Perls. The extent to which Gestalt psychology influenced Gestalt therapy is disputed, however. In any case it is not identical with Gestalt psychology. On the one hand, Laura Perls preferred not to use the term [...] "Gestalt" [...] to name the emerging new therapy, because she thought that the gestalt psychologists would object to it; on the other hand Fritz and Laura Perls clearly adopted some of Goldstein's work. Thus, though recognizing the historical connection and the influence, most gestalt psychologists emphasize that gestalt therapy is not a form of gestalt psychology.|$|E

2500|$|It is {{a matter}} of debate whether Watson and Crick should have had access to Franklin's results without her {{knowledge}} or permission, <b>and</b> <b>before</b> <b>she</b> had a chance to formally publish the results of her detailed analysis of her X-ray diffraction data which were included in the progress report. However, Watson and Crick found fault in her steadfast assertion that, according to her data, a helical structure was not the only possible shape for DNA—so they had a dilemma. In an effort to clarify this issue, Max Ferdinand Perutz later published what had been in the progress report, and suggested that nothing was in the report that Franklin herself had not said in her talk (attended by Watson) in late 1951. Further, Perutz explained that the report was to a Medical Research Council (MRC) committee that had been created in order to [...] "establish contact between the different groups of people working for the Council". Randall's and Perutz's laboratories were both funded by the MRC.|$|E
2500|$|Her next {{assignment}} for Lewton {{was to write}} the story and screenplay for The Leopard Man based on Black Alibi, a novel by Cornell Woolrich. [...] Later in 1943, she was loaned out to Maurice Geraghty's production group to write the story and screenplay for The Falcon and the Co-Eds, the seventh in his popular 'Falcon' detective series. [...] Back with the Lewton group in 1944, she developed Isle of the Dead (story and screenplay inspired by Boecklin’s symbolist painting), Bedlam (historical research for a story inspired by A Rake's Progress, the paintings by William Hogarth), and an A-movie property titled Blackbeard The Pirate (original screenplay based {{on the life of}} the notorious English pirate, Edward Teach). [...] She also wrote dialogue for Youth Runs Wild (Mark Robson's directorial debut) <b>and,</b> <b>before</b> <b>she</b> left the group the following year, she and Lewton began to discuss ideas for a screenplay about the life of Lucrezia Borgia.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{his return}} from a {{vacation}} in Europe, in early 1871, Creighton attended a lecture by art critic John Ruskin at the Sheldonian Theatre. [...] After the lecture, he noticed his friend, the future author Humphry Ward, talking to an unfamiliar {{young woman who was}} wearing a yellow scarf. [...] Yellow was Creighton's favourite colour; the scarf aroused his interest enough for him to ask Ward about the woman, whose name was Louise von Glehn. [...] Soon Ward was inviting Creighton and von Glehn to a Valentine's Day lunch hosted in his rooms in Brasenose College. [...] In a few weeks, von Glenn found herself won over by Creighton's charm, <b>and</b> <b>before</b> <b>she</b> left Oxford {{at the end of the}} month, the two were engaged. [...] They had agreed to be married the following winter; however, as Christmas approached, it was still not certain whether Merton College would waive its requirement of celibacy for its teaching fellows. [...] On Christmas Eve, the college finally relented and elected four married fellows, one of whom was Creighton. [...] Von Glehn and Creighton were married on 8 January 1872 in her home town of Sydenham, Kent. [...] They spent a week [...] honeymooning in Paris before returning to Oxford for Creighton's new teaching term.|$|E

2500|$|On October 5, 2003, Kimberly [...] "Kim" [...] Long {{went out}} bar-hopping with her boyfriend, Oswaldo [...] "Ozzy" [...] Conde and a mutual friend, Jeff Dills. When they {{returned}} to the apartment in Corona that Conde and Long shared, the couple got into an intense argument and Long left the apartment, accompanied by Dills, to cool off. Dills later dropped Long off at her apartment, where she found Conde brutally bludgeoned to death, the entire place covered with blood. She immediately called 911. No blood was found on Long. After being taken to the police station and questioned, Long was asked to take a polygraph test and passed it. Friends of the deceased man pointed to Conde's former girlfriend as a possible suspect. Dills, however, told police that he had dropped Long off at 1:20 am, rather than at 2:00 am, as she had told police. Police theorized that Long could have committed the murder of Conde after 1:20 am <b>and</b> <b>before</b> <b>she</b> called 911 at 2:09 am. (Dills died shortly afterwards in a motorcycle accident and thus could not be questioned about the time discrepancy.) Long was tried twice for Conde's murder: the first trial resulted in a hung jury, and the second resulted in a second-degree murder conviction. The judge at the second trial, Patrick F. Magers, stated that {{if it had been a}} court trial, rather than a jury trial, he would have acquitted the defendant. [...] "This is one of those classic cases where the person who finds the dead person ends up becoming a suspect," [...] said Brooks. After the CIP became involved in Long's case, they got the case retried in front of the same judge, with forensic evidence proving that Conde had definitely died before 1:20 am that morning; that, even assuming Dills was correct about the time he dropped Long off, it would have been physically impossible for Long to kill Conde and conceal her involvement within the period of less than an hour between 1:20 am and 2:09 am; and that a cigarette butt in the apartment revealed DNA from an unknown male. On June 10, 2016, Judge Magers reversed Long's original conviction, determining that she had been inadequately defended, and she was freed on bail after six years in prison.|$|E
