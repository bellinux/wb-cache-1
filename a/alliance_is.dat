40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the quality of}} the therapeutic alliance in a cognitive-behavioural treatment for anxious children, and examined possible predictors of the <b>alliance.</b> Participants <b>were</b> 20 clients diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. The therapeutic <b>alliance</b> <b>was</b> measured from the patient, therapist, and observer perspective early and late in therapy. Predictors included in the study were: 1) background predictors (gender, age condition, and treatment format); 2) parental style; 3) self-concept; 4) symptom severity; and 5) motivation and treatment credibility. Firstly, results showed that patients' and therapists' <b>alliance</b> ratings <b>were</b> high and similar, while observer-rated <b>alliance</b> <b>was</b> lower. Secondly, the correlation between patient-, therapist-, and observer-rated <b>alliance</b> varied. There <b>was</b> a significant correlation between patient- and therapist-rated early <b>alliance.</b> No correlation <b>was</b> found between observer-rated alliance and patient-rated alliance. Observer-rated and therapist-rated <b>alliance</b> <b>was</b> significantly correlated. Thirdly, the therapeutic <b>alliance</b> <b>was</b> stable over time for all the perspectives. Fourthly, predictors of the alliance varied for the different perspectives. Predictors of patient-rated <b>alliance</b> <b>were</b> mother-rated treatment credibility and self concept. Predictors of therapist-rated <b>alliance</b> <b>were</b> motivation, mother-rated treatment credibility, gender (girls were rated higher) and patient-rated treatment credibility.

5|$|At {{about the}} time of his union with Cacht, Donnchad aspired to become High King of Ireland. With {{powerful}} maritime forces at his command, Echmarcach would have certainly been regarded as an important potential ally. Clear evidence of an alliance between Echmarcach and the Uí Briain is preserved by the twelfth-century Banshenchas, a text which records the marriage of Echmarcach's daughter, Mór, to Tadc (died 1086), son of Toirdelbach Ua Briain (died 1086). Annalistic evidence of such an <b>alliance</b> <b>is</b> found well into the late eleventh century. In fact, kinship between Echmarcach's descendants and the Uí Briain even led to the accession of one of Echmarcach's maternal grandsons, Domnall mac Taidc (died 1115), to the kingship of the Isles at about the turn of the twelfth century.|$|E

5|$|The Grey Havens, an Elven port on {{the western}} shores, is {{attacked}} by the Corsairs of Umbar, allies of Sauron. The Dwarves, who {{have been reluctant to}} ally with the Elves, eventually decide to {{come to the aid of}} the Grey Havens. With the Goblins defeated and all of Eriador pacified, the Dwarven-Elven <b>alliance</b> <b>is</b> tested by Sauron's forces. Mordor's overwhelming forces besiege the Lake Town of Esgaroth and the Dwarven city of Erebor. The Dwarven king Dáin leads a small group of Dwarves and men of Dale to defend their homeland and manage to eliminate the Mordor presence in Esgaroth but are forced to retreat back to Erebor to defend themselves against an overwhelming army led by the Mouth of Sauron. After a long battle against the Mouth of Sauron's army, Elven reinforcements from Mirkwood led by the Elven king Thranduil arrive and save the Dwarves, defeating the Mouth of Sauron and his army. Elrond leads the first attack, but later, Thranduil, Glorfindel, Glóin, Arwen, and King Dáin all unite under the Dwarven-Elven alliance for a final battle in Dol Guldur, the stronghold of Sauron in Mirkwood, aided by the Ents and Eagles. The Good forces and its three combined armies overcome the defenses and destroy the fortress, eliminating the last threat in the North.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{investigates the}} {{outcomes}} and durations of strategic alliances among competing firms, using alliance outcomes {{as indicators of}} learning by partner firms. We show that alliance outcomes vary systematically across link and scale <b>alliances.</b> Link <b>alliances</b> <b>are</b> interfirm partnerships to which partners contribute different capabilities, while scale <b>alliances</b> <b>are</b> partnerships to which partners contribute similar capabilities. We find that partners {{are more likely to}} reorganize or take over link alliances than scale alliances. By contrast, scale <b>alliances</b> <b>are</b> more likely to continue without material changes. The two types of <b>alliances</b> <b>are</b> equally likely to shut down, at similar ages. These results support the view that link alliances lead to greater levels of learning and capability acquisition between the partners than do scale alliance...|$|R
