This act provides for uniform and equitable treatment of persons displaced by a federal programs from their homes, businesses, or farms, including assuring just compensation and assisting in relocation. For example, if {{the construction of a}} highway under a federal program requires the expropriation of homes, the expropriation must be made by either providing fair compensation for that property or providing assistance for, or reimbursement of, relocation expenses incurred by the affected person. The Compliance Supplement suggests verifying that the property acquired is appraised by qualified independent appraisers, the appraisals are examined by a review <b>appraiser</b> to assure acceptability, and that after acceptance, the review <b>appraiser</b> certifies the recommended or approved value of the property for just compensation to the owner.|$|E

However, a month before the election the state’s World War Veterans’ State Aid Commission fired Overturf from his position as a veteran loan <b>appraiser.</b> The commission alleged that Overturf had inflated the value of some appraisals.
