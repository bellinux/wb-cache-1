50|$|A candy {{thermometer}} {{is similar}} to <b>a</b> <b>meat</b> <b>thermometer</b> except that it can read higher temperatures (usually 400 °F/200 °C or more).|$|R
25|$|A direct {{indicating}} {{dial thermometer}} (such as a patio <b>thermometer</b> or <b>a</b> <b>meat</b> <b>thermometer)</b> uses <b>a</b> bimetallic strip wrapped into a coil. One {{end of the}} coil is fixed to the housing of the device and the other drives an indicating needle. A bimetallic strip is also used in a recording thermometer. Breguet's thermometer consists of a tri-metallic helix.|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>meat</b> <b>thermometer</b> is <b>a</b> unit {{which will}} measure core {{temperature}} of meats while cooking. It {{will have a}} metal probe with a sharp point which is pushed into the <b>meat,</b> and <b>a</b> dial or digital display. Some show the temperature only; others also have markings to indicate when different kinds of meat are done to a specified degree (e.g., [...] "beef medium rare").|$|R
2500|$|Beef can {{be cooked}} to various degrees, from very rare to well done. The degree of cooking {{corresponds}} to {{the temperature in the}} approximate center of the meat, which can be measured with <b>a</b> <b>meat</b> <b>thermometer.</b> Beef can be cooked using the sous-vide method, which cooks the entire steak to the same temperature, but when cooked using a method such as broiling or roasting it is typically cooked such that it has a [...] "bulls eye" [...] of doneness, with the least done (coolest) at the center and the most done (warmest) at the outside.|$|R

5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>meat</b> <b>{{thermometer}}</b> or cooking thermometer is {{a thermometer}} {{used to measure}} the internal temperature of meat, especially roasts and steaks, and other cooked foods. The degree of [...] "doneness" [...] of meat or bread correlates closely with the internal temperature, so that a thermometer reading indicates when it is cooked as desired. When cooking, food should always be cooked so that the interior reaches a temperature sufficient, {{that in the case of}} meat is enough to kill pathogens that may cause foodborne illness or, in the case of bread, that is done baking; the thermometer helps to ensure this.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> 2012 chicken <b>meat</b> {{study found}} 60% of home cooks {{were at risk}} of food {{poisoning}} by washing whole poultry before it was cooked, which can spread bacteria around the kitchen. A further 16% of those surveyed incorrectly tasted chicken {{to see if it}} was cooked properly rather than using <b>a</b> safe <b>meat</b> <b>thermometer.</b>|$|R
40|$|A hand injury {{occurred}} at a U. S. facility in 1985 involving a pointed shaft (similar to <b>a</b> <b>meat</b> <b>thermometer)</b> that <b>a</b> worker was using to remove scrap solid plutonium from a plastic bottle. The worker punctured his right index finger on the palm side at the metacarpal-phalangeal joint. The wound was not through-and- through, although it was deep. The puncture wound resulted in deposition of ~ 48 kBq of alpha activity from the weapons-grade plutonium mixture with a nominal 12 to 1 Pu-alpha to {sup 241 }Am-alpha ratio. This case clearly showed that DTPA was very effective for decorporation of plutonium and americium. The case is a model for management of wounds contaminated with transuranics: (1) a team approach for dealing {{with all of the}} issues surrounding the incident, including the psychological, (2) early surgical intervention for foreign-body removal, (3) wound irrigation with DTPA solution, and (4) early and prolonged DTPA administration based upon bioassay and in vivo dosimetry...|$|R

Five years later, Edie is having a party with her friends Johnny, Eva, Colin, Liz and Shane in her house. Colin puts on the same mask as Edie's mother's killer and scares Edie. This causes her to have a psychotic break and stab him {{to death with a}} kitchen knife. She then hacks Liz to death with a cleaver, stabs Shane in the neck with <b>a</b> <b>meat</b> <b>thermometer,</b> and bludgeons Johnny with a frying pan. She then advances menacingly towards Eva, but Eva coaxes Edie out of her psychotic episode. However, a still living Johnny then appears and smashes a block of ice on Eva's head. He then reveals that he killed Edie's mother and [...] strangles Edie with the cord for the refrigerator. However, just as Johnny is about to leave the house, a dying Eva beats him to death with two frying pans before collapsing on the floor.|$|R
50|$|Upon waking, Chad and Scarlet {{discover}} that Sam and Lilith intend to torture and kill them. They nearly drown Scarlet in a barrel, but {{after they leave}} the room Chad resuscitates her, and the couple tries to flee the farmhouse. Chad is caught by Lilith, but wrestles away a shotgun from her and knocks her unconscious. Scarlet, aided by Alal, runs away into a vineyard field, but is eventually caught by Sam, who kills Alal and takes Scarlet back into the house. While Sam goes to look for Chad, Lilith tortures Scarlet by scraping the flesh off her knees with a grater. Chad interrupts the torture session and kills Lilith by stabbing her {{in the head with}} <b>a</b> <b>meat</b> <b>thermometer.</b> Chad tries to set Scarlet free, but is unable to do so before Sam gets back. Chad and Sam fight, and Scarlet stabs Sam in the back with a chef's knife. The couple flees in Sam's pickup truck, but Sam revives and pursues them; Chad runs Sam over with the truck several times before they drive off.|$|R
40|$|Field {{procedures}} for collecting soil cores and soil {{samples from the}} steam injection plot were modified {{in an effort to}} minimize VOC losses that can occur when sampling soil at elevated temperatures (Battelle, 2001). The primary modifications included: (1) additional personnel safety equipment, such as thermalinsulated gloves for core handling; (2) the addition of a cooling period to bring the soil cores to approximately 20 ºC before collecting samples; and (3) capping the core ends while the cores were cooling. Concerns were raised about the possibility that increased handling times during soil coring, soil cooling, and sample collection may result in an increase in VOC losses. An experiment was conducted using soil samples spiked with a surrogate compound to investigate the effectiveness of the field procedures developed for LC 34 in minimizing VOC losses. Materials and Methods Soil cores were collected in a 2 -inch diameter, 4 -foot long acetate sleeve that was placed tightly inside a 2 -inch diameter stainless steel core barrel. The acetate sleeve was immediately capped on both ends with a protective polymer covering. The sleeve was placed in an ice bath to cool the heated core to below ambient groundwater temperatures (approximately 20 ºC). The temperature of the soil core was monitored during the cooling process with <b>a</b> <b>meat</b> <b>thermometer</b> that was pushed into one end cap (see Figure G- 1). Approximately 30 minutes was required to cool each 4 -foot long, 2 -inch diameter soil core from 50 - 95 ºC to below 20 ºC (see Figure G- 2). Upon reaching ambient temperature, the core sleeve was then uncapped and cut open along its length to collect the soil sample for contaminant analysis (see Figure G- 3) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{best way}} to prevent {{trichinellosis}} is to fully cook <b>meat.</b> <b>A</b> food <b>thermometer</b> can verify that the temperature inside the meat is high enough. Infection is typically treated with antiparasitic medication such as albendazole or mebendazole. Rapid treatment may kill adult worms and thereby stop further worsening of symptoms. Both medications are considered safe but {{have been associated with}} side effects such as bone marrow suppression. Their use during pregnancy or in {{children under the age of}} 2 years is poorly studied but appears to be safe. Treatment with steroids is sometimes also required in severe cases. Without treatment symptoms typically resolve within three months.|$|R
50|$|For beef, lamb, or veal <b>insert</b> the <b>meat</b> <b>thermometer</b> {{away from}} bone, fat, or cartilage. The <b>meat</b> should reach <b>a</b> {{temperature}} of between 63 °C (145 °F) for medium-rare, and 77 °C (170 °F) for well done.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, House sees {{a patient}} named Michael Tritter during his clinic hours. When House refuses to run tests on Tritter's rash, {{attributing}} it to dehydration, a confrontation ensues. Tritter trips House, House swabs the rash, and House leaves Tritter with a <b>thermometer</b> <b>inserted</b> in his rectum while House leaves for the day.|$|R
50|$|For poultry <b>insert</b> the <b>meat</b> <b>thermometer</b> {{into the}} thigh, {{but do not}} touch the bone. The {{suggested}} temperature for poultry to reach before {{it is safe to}} consume is 74 °C (165 °F), unless the poultry is stuffed, in which case the temperature {{in the center of the}} stuffing should be about 74 °C (165 °F).|$|R
30|$|During general anaesthesia, a {{pulse oximetry}} device {{measured}} pulse and oxygen saturation {{in the ear}} to monitor for reliable anaesthesia. Mean arterial pressure was monitored in the rabbits through arterial cannulization of the opposite ear. Body temperature was measured with a digital <b>thermometer</b> <b>inserted</b> rectally and during anaesthesia body temperature was held at 37 – 39  °C.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Meat</b> <b>thermometers</b> {{are usually}} {{designed}} {{to have the}} probe in the meat during cooking. Some use a bimetallic strip which rotates a needle which shows the temperature on a dial; the whole thermometer can be left inside the oven during cooking. Another variety commonly used on turkey is the pop-up timer, which uses a spring held in by a soft material that [...] "pops up" [...] when the <b>meat</b> reaches <b>a</b> set temperature.|$|R
50|$|Accidents or torture {{may cause}} an {{involuntary}} insertion {{of a foreign}} body. A mercury medical <b>thermometer</b> <b>inserted</b> into the anus {{in order to measure}} the temperature, but broke off while inside, {{is an example of a}} foreign rectal body due to an accient. Ancient Greece knew the Rhaphanidosis as a punishment for male adulterers. It involved the insertion of a radish into the anus. Many self-inserted rectal bodies are stated as accidentally by the patients due to feelings of shame.|$|R
5000|$|The {{dropping}} point test procedures {{are given in}} ASTM standards D-566 and D-2265. [...] The test apparatus consists of a grease cup with a small hole in the bottom, test tube, two thermometers, a container, stirring device if required and an electric heater. The inside surfaces of the grease cup are coated with the grease to be tested. A <b>thermometer</b> is <b>inserted</b> into the cup and held in place so that the thermometer does not touch the grease. This assembly is placed inside a test tube. The test tube is lowered into the container which is filled with oil in D-566 and has an aluminum block in D-2265. Another <b>thermometer</b> is <b>inserted</b> into the oil/block.|$|R
50|$|Thermometers are {{important}} in food safety where food at temperatures within 41 and 135 F can be prone to potentially harmful levels of bacterial growth after several hours {{which could lead to}} foodborne illness. This includes monitoring refrigeration temperatures and maintaining temperatures in foods being served under heat lamps or hot water baths.Cooking thermometers {{are important}} for determining if a food is properly cooked. In particular <b>meat</b> <b>thermometers</b> are used to aid in cooking <b>meat</b> to <b>a</b> safe internal temperature while preventing over cooking. They are commonly found using either a bimetallic coil, or a thermocouple or thermistor with a digital readout.Candy thermometers are used to aid in achieving a specific water content in a sugar solution based on its boiling temperature.|$|R
50|$|A medical {{thermometer}} is {{used for}} measuring human or animal body temperature. The tip of the <b>thermometer</b> is <b>inserted</b> into the mouth under the tongue (oral or sub-lingual temperature), under the armpit (axillary temperature), or into the rectum via the anus (rectal temperature).|$|R
5000|$|The {{process begins}} with gas under some pressure, , at {{temperature}} , confined to {{one half of}} a thermally isolated container (see the top part of the drawing {{at the beginning of}} this article). The gas occupies an initial volume ,mechanically separated from the other part of the container, which has a volume , and is under near zero pressure. The tap (solid line) between the two halves of the container is then suddenly opened, and the gas expands to fill the entire container, which has a total volume of [...] (see the bottom part of the drawing). A <b>thermometer</b> <b>inserted</b> into the compartment on the left (not shown in the drawing) measures the temperature of the gas before and after the expansion.|$|R
40|$|Objective – The {{objective}} was to determine a technique for obtaining accurate rectal temperature measurements using commonly available digital thermometers. Design – The design tested the accuracy of rectal temperature measurements using commonly available digital thermometers intended for use in humans {{as well as the}} effect of insertion technique. Animals and Procedures – Students measured rectal temperature on sixteen crossbred cows on 53 separate occasions. Students' initial measurements were made with techniques acquired from their own previous experience. The students then repeated the temperature measurements after being instructed to <b>insert</b> the digital <b>thermometer</b> up to the display window. Rectal temperatures were also measured with a Cornell-style mercury <b>thermometer</b> completely <b>inserted</b> intra-rectally and allowed to incubate for two minutes. Accuracy of both types of thermometers, was determined by comparison with temperature measurements of a water bath using two calibrated traceable thermometers. The affect of three intra-rectal angles of insertion was also determined. Results - Rectal temperatures based on student initial temperature measurements, Cornell mercury thermometer, and digital <b>thermometers</b> <b>inserted</b> to the window were 38. 46 +/- 0. 07 oC, 38. 95 +/- 0. 05 oC, 38. 77 +/- 0. 06 oC, respectively. Temperature readings were affected by 0. 1 oC by angle of insertion. In a water bath, student-owned and traceable (reference) thermometers recorded temperatures that were not significantly different. Cornell mercury thermometers measured water bath temperatures that were 0. 2 oC higher than that of calibrated thermometers. One of ten student digital thermometers was inaccurate. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance – Accurate temperature measurements can be obtained using digital thermometers if the <b>thermometer</b> is <b>inserted</b> to the display window. Angle of insertion of the digital thermometer is clinically unimportant and the thermometer's accuracy should be checked periodically...|$|R
5000|$|A sensor's {{sensitivity}} indicates {{how much}} the sensor's output changes when the input quantity being measured changes. For instance, if the mercury in a thermometer moves 1 cm when the temperature changes by 1 °C, the sensitivity is 1 cm/°C (it is basically the slope Dy/Dx assuming a linear characteristic). Some sensors can also affect what they measure; for instance, a room temperature <b>thermometer</b> <b>inserted</b> into a hot cup of liquid cools the liquid while the liquid heats the thermometer. Sensors are usually designed to have a small effect on what is measured; making the sensor smaller often improves this and may introduce other advantages.. [...] Technological progress allows more and more sensors to be manufactured on a microscopic scale as microsensors using MEMS technology. In most cases, a microsensor reaches a significantly higher speed and sensitivity compared with macroscopic approaches.|$|R
50|$|Body {{temperature}} {{can also}} be taken in the rectum. Rectal temperature can be taken by <b>inserting</b> a medical <b>thermometer</b> not more than 25 mm (1 inch) into the rectum via the anus. A mercury <b>thermometer</b> should be <b>inserted</b> for 3 to 5 minutes; a digital <b>thermometer</b> should remain <b>inserted</b> until it beeps. Normal rectal temperature generally ranges from 36 to 38 °C (96.8 to 100.4 °F) and is about 0.5 °C (1 °F) above oral (mouth) temperature and about 1 °C (2 °F) above axilla (armpit) temperature.|$|R
