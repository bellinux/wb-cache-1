50|$|By {{the late}} 1790s the tower {{had already been}} made fully {{obsolete}} by innovations {{in the treatment of}} mental patients. Despite appearances, the Narrenturm was not an implementation of Jeremy Bentham's hypothetical panopticon, as the cells could not be monitored from <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>post.</b>|$|E
50|$|Gilberte Fouineteau, another French inventor, {{has been}} {{credited}} as {{the creator of}} the modern salad spinner. He filed a patent for a device in 1973. It too used centrifugal force to dry and drain vegetables and salads. The patent describes its difference being the removable basket and a lack of <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>post.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> large <b>Central</b> <b>Post</b> Office, {{designed}} by Jasper Wager, {{was built in}} 1898, and extended with a sorting office {{designed by}} John Rutherford in around 1913 (although the original buildings were replaced by a modern structure designed by an unknown architect at the Ministry of Works in 1961).|$|R
50|$|Katharina Henot was a {{well-known}} and influential citizen in Cologne, and {{was married to}} Heinrich Neuden. Together with her brother, Harger Henot (1571-1637), she had inherited the postal office from her father Jacob and worked as perhaps the first female postmaster in Germany. They were in a conflict in the Imperial court with Count Leonhard II von Taxis, who wished to create <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>post</b> office.|$|E

5000|$|A {{king post}} (or king-post or kingpost) is <b>a</b> <b>central</b> {{vertical}} <b>post</b> used in architectural or bridge designs, working in tension {{to support a}} beam below from a truss apex above (whereas a crown post, though visually similar, supports items above from the beam below).|$|R
50|$|Confederation Square {{was created}} in the late 1930s, and Canada's National War Memorial was erected. It used lands that once {{contained}} the prestigious Russell House hotel, the Russell Theatre, and old City Hall, all which succumbed to fire, and the old post office and Knox Presbyterian Church were demolished. <b>A</b> new <b>Central</b> <b>Post</b> Office was erected facing the memorial.|$|R
5000|$|The mine has {{an olive}} green steel {{cylindrical}} body {{which has an}} offset fuze well on the top. The mine is used with the T253 trip and pressure fuze, similar to the M605 fuze used with the US M16 mine. The fuze has three prongs with <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>post</b> for attaching a trip wire. The fuze is triggered by either pressure applied to the prongs or tension on an attached tripwire.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>central</b> <b>post</b> {{office was}} already in existence, from the period when Kraków {{was part of the}} Duchy of Warsaw. On 1 June 1816 the Post Office of the Free City of Kraków took control of the {{existing}} central post office. Its staff consisted of a director, four secretarial staff, two postmen and a conductor. Two post stations were established in Kreszkowice and Cla. Post routes to and from each of the three Polish areas, Galicia, Congress Poland and Prussia were soon established.|$|E
5000|$|The PM-79 is a small, {{circular}} Bulgarian blast-resistant anti-personnel mine, superficially {{similar to}} the Russian PMN. The mine uses a unique trigger design; {{on the top of}} the mine, beneath a thin rubber cover is a dish shaped pressure plate. Pressure on the outer rim of the dish shaped plate levers up <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>post,</b> which triggers the mine. The mine also incorporates a mechanical arming delay using a pin cutting through a thin lead strip. The mine arms in between two minutes and four hours depending on the temperature.|$|E
5000|$|The {{center post}} church, (Midtmastkyrkje) has <b>a</b> single <b>central</b> <b>post</b> {{reaching}} {{all the way}} up to and connected to the roof construction. But the roof is a simple hipped one, without the raised central part of the Type B churches. This variation on the common type of church, found in Numedal and Hallingdal, dates to around 1200.|$|R
50|$|The {{need for}} <b>a</b> new <b>central</b> <b>post</b> office in Buenos Aires was first raised in 1888 by the {{director}} of the Correo Argentino (Argentine Postal Service) at the time, Dr. Ramón J. Cárcano. Later that year a Congressional bill providing for its construction was signed by President Miguel Juárez Celman. The Ministry of Public Works commissioned French architect Norbert Maillart for its design in 1889.|$|R

50|$|Blank CD and DVD {{media are}} often sold in bulk {{packages}} called spindles or, less formally, cake boxes. This {{type of packaging}} consists of a round, clear plastic cup that mates bayonet-style to a base with <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>post</b> that holds a stack of discs; dummy discs made of clear polycarbonate with no recording surface are often packed {{on the ends of}} the stack to avoid scratches from contact with the hard plastic of the packages. Such packages have been designed to hold anywhere from ten up to 100 discs, and offer the user multiple options for packaging the finalized disc.|$|E
5000|$|The park {{featured}} [...] "The Crows Nest" [...] observation tower, {{which had}} originally [...] "been the Belgian Aerial Tower at the 1964/1965 New York World's Fair". This structure [...] "was bought second hand after the fair" [...] and {{transported to the}} site, where it was re-erected. It consisted of <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>post</b> from which was suspended four metal cages by cables, designed [...] "to carry several standing passengers." [...] "To balance the structure, two cages {{would be in the}} air while two were being loaded on the ground," [...] and the cages would be raised and lowered simultaneously.|$|E
50|$|After the fire, {{the square}} was reconstructed by the French {{architect}} Ernest Hébrard. His initial plans were to construct <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>post,</b> call and telegraph {{office in the}} middle of the square and banks and other buildings in the perimeter. He did not succeed due to the instability of the ground. In 1924, Hotel Ritz was built in the corner of Venizelou and Mitropoleos Street but was eventually destroyed in the fire of 1968. Two more buildings were added in 1929. Left of the Hotel Ritz, the building of Ioniki Bank and in the corner of Mitropoleos and Dragoumi Street the building of Bank of Greece, which still stands.|$|E
2500|$|The Dutch [...] {{was invented}} around 1600 and {{specifically}} designed for sawing wood. Several hundred have existed {{of this type of}} windmill; however, only five paltrok mills remain in the Netherlands, at Zaanse Schans, Haarlem, Zaandam, Amsterdam and at the Netherlands Open Air Museum, Arnhem. Dutch paltrok mills are, like post windmills, supported on <b>a</b> <b>central</b> wooden <b>post</b> around which the entire millhouse rotates. The <b>central</b> <b>post,</b> however, is short and, to provide stability, a rim bearing is added on a brick base, on which the millhouse rotates with numerous rollers. Side extensions protect the sawing floor and workmen from the weather.|$|R
5000|$|King~ 1) (U.S.) <b>A</b> single, <b>central</b> <b>post</b> in <b>a</b> {{roof truss}} in {{tension between the}} rafters (top chords) and a tie beam (bottom chord), or 2) (U.S.) A short of the tie beam only {{supporting}} the rafters via struts. 3) (U.K.) A king post specifically carries a ridge beam otherwise is called a king strut. [...] "King post" [...] was formerly used to describe a crown post in the U. K., but no longer.|$|R
5000|$|... On D-Deck the {{staircase}} opened {{directly onto the}} Reception Room and adjoining Dining Saloon. Instead of <b>a</b> cherub, the <b>central</b> <b>post</b> of {{the staircase}} contained an impressive gilt candelabra with electric lights. Behind the staircases were installed the three First-Class elevators which ran between E and A Decks.|$|R
5000|$|The BM/85 is an Italian blast {{resistant}} bounding anti-personnel mine that {{was produced by}} Tecnovar italiana SpA. The mine is cylindrical with a three pronged tilt/pressure fuze on the top with <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>post</b> for attaching a tripwire. A plastic safety clip prevents the fuze from tilting when in transit. Once the pressure clip is removed the mine is armed. Once the fuze is pulled sideways by a trip wire or by downward pressure, the mine is triggered. A small charge launches the mine to a height of about 0.45 meters where it explodes scattering 1,000 fragments to a lethal radius of about 25 meters.|$|E
5000|$|Oil-rich {{vegetable}} {{materials have}} been processed mechanically {{to extract the}} valuable oils for thousands of years, typically using vertical millstones moving around <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>post</b> (edge runner stones or kollergangs in an edge mill) to crush or bruise the seeds or fruit which can then be stamped or pressed to extract the oil. A treadmill, windmill or watermill was later used to drive the milling and pressing machinery, replaced in modern times with steam and later other power sources. In some areas, watermills may be [...] "double" [...] water mills, with machinery for grinding wheat {{on one side of}} the watercourse and machinery for extracting oils on the other side.|$|E
5000|$|The entire mill has to {{be rotated}} to face the wind. To {{accomplish}} this two types of tjasker have developed. In the first type, known as paaltjasker (English: post tjasker), the mill is supported on and turned around <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>post.</b> The Archimedes' screw pumps water from the outer circular ditch to a central circular ditch or pool. The screw moves in a circle when the mill is turned so these circular ditches enable the mill to function in whatever direction it is pointing. Only the outlet from the central pool taking the raised water across the outer circular ditch prevent {{the use of the}} mill facing opposite that particular direction as the screw would collide with the water outlet. The second type of tjasker, the boktjasker (English: trestle tjasker), is not balanced on <b>a</b> <b>central</b> <b>post</b> but supported on a trestle. The lower submerged support is fixed, the mill is rotated around this point, while the other end is movable. Here the trestle is commonly equipped with rollers or wheels on a fixed ring to make winding easier. In this method of construction the Archimedes' screw takes water from a central pool and deposits it in a circular ditch that surrounds the central pool. Water can be taken to the central pool by a pipe or a gap in the circular ditch.Besides the structural differences, a typical paaltjasker is designed so it can relatively easily be dismantled to be moved to another location or stored indoors though nowadays this feature is rarely used. A boktjasker is more or less fixed to its location.|$|E
5000|$|The Henderson Longster is a {{conventional}} landing gear equipped, wire braced parasol wing aircraft. Aeronautical designer Ivan Diggs designed a new 30 ft wing for the Longster. The wire bracing is supported by <b>a</b> <b>central</b> cabane <b>post</b> located over a [...] above-wing fuel tank. The fuselage is steel tubing. The design also features pinned and brazed gusset joints as opposed to conventionally welded joint clusters.|$|R
5|$|Charing Cross was <b>a</b> <b>central</b> staging <b>post</b> for coaches, but the {{congested}} {{narrow road}} {{was a frequent}} scene of accidents; here, a bonfire has caused the Salisbury Flying Coach to overturn. Festive bonfires were usual but risky: a house fire lights the sky in the distance. A link-boy blows on the flame of his torch, street-urchins are playing with the fire, and one of their fireworks is falling in at the coach window.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} years of the railway, block posts were local signal boxes manned with block post keepers. Today there are only a few of these classic, railway staff-operated block posts. Their {{function}} has been largely superseded by equipment that forms part of an automatic block signalling (Selbsttätigen Streckenblocks or Sbk) system or by <b>a</b> <b>central</b> block <b>post</b> in <b>a</b> station signal box at one end of the section between two stations.|$|R
