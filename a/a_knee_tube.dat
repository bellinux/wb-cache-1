40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the differences in}} leg strength and walking ability among groups with different knee problems. The participants were 328 elderly females (60 - 94 years old; mean age 76. 1 years; SD = 6. 2) who were classified into three groups: those without <b>knee</b> pain or <b>a</b> <b>knee</b> disorder, those with knee pain, and those with <b>a</b> <b>knee</b> disorder. The subjects took knee extension strength and 12 meter maximum effort walk tests. Knee extension strength was significantly lower in the groups with <b>knee</b> pain and <b>a</b> <b>knee</b> disorder than in the group without pain or <b>a</b> <b>knee</b> disorder. Walking speed was significantly slower in the group with <b>a</b> <b>knee</b> disorder than {{in the other two}} groups. In conclusion, the female elderly with <b>knee</b> pain or <b>a</b> <b>knee</b> disorder are inferior in knee extension strength and walking ability. In addition, the elderly with <b>a</b> <b>knee</b> disorder are inferior in walking ability to the elderly with knee pain...|$|R
40|$|An above knee {{prosthesis}} {{that is used}} by femoral amputees has <b>a</b> <b>knee</b> joint mechanism as {{an alternative}} function of <b>a</b> <b>knee.</b> <b>A</b> <b>Knee</b> brace also has <b>a</b> <b>knee</b> joint mechanism for securing stability of <b>a</b> <b>knee</b> during the stance phase. Performance of the prosthetic knee joint highly affects activity and a cure of the patient. However, the practical knee joint mechanism that can generate active joint torque has almost never appeared, because of the problems of overweight, mechanical noise and energy consumption. In this study, a new joint mechanism that would be able to generate extensional knee joint torque by utilizing ground reaction force without an external energy source was examined. The torque generator composed of hydraulic cylinders was designed by considering the results of gait analysis. The experimental trial model of <b>a</b> <b>knee</b> brace was made for a normal subject. Effect of the torque generator was experimentally examined by electromyogram of vastus medialis and by measuring generative torque during extension of <b>a</b> <b>knee</b> joint...|$|R

50|$|Bridging {{exercises}} are done with <b>a</b> flexed <b>knee</b> {{to lessen the}} stretch on the hamstring (<b>a</b> <b>knee</b> flexor) and focus the hip extension work on the gluteus maximus. In that same respect, the reduced knee flexion makes plantar flexion work comparable to a seated calf raise, due to the lessened stretch on the gastrocnemius (like the hamstring, also <b>a</b> <b>knee</b> flexor).|$|R

30|$|Complete {{absence of}} the tibia {{presents}} the biggest challenge for reconstruction {{because there is no}} knee joint. While ankle fusion gives good function with little disability, knee fusion leads to significant disability for sitting and climbing stairs. It is preferable to avoid <b>a</b> <b>knee</b> fusion. Even if active knee motion cannot be achieved, <b>a</b> mobile <b>knee</b> joint supported by a brace is preferable to <b>a</b> <b>knee</b> fusion. This is not dissimilar to <b>a</b> paralytic <b>knee</b> from polio. Therefore, the following methods have been developed to reconstruct the knee.|$|R
40|$|There is an {{insufficient}} {{supply of}} young human knees for evaluating ACL reconstructions, which has researchers investigating other alternatives. An {{alternative is to}} use <b>a</b> <b>knee</b> from <b>a</b> large farm animal (eg, porcine, bovine, ovine, and caprine). † The disadvantages of using <b>a</b> <b>knee</b> from <b>a</b> large farm animal as a substitute are that the stiffness and yield of 1 type of fixation device (ie, interference screw) are overestimated, 19 and the geometry and kinematics of <b>a</b> <b>knee</b> from <b>a</b> large farm animal {{differ from those of}} <b>a</b> human <b>knee.</b> 3, 12, 16 Therefore, the challenge is to devise a substitute that both approximates the fixation properties of young human bone and has the geometry and kinemat-ics of <b>a</b> human <b>knee.</b> <b>A</b> technique that has not been reported and that might circumvent the insufficient supply of young human knees is the use of foam to reinforce the osteopenic cancellous bone in <b>an</b> elderly human <b>knee.</b> <b>A</b> block of polyurethane foam has been used to test fixation devices. 8, 11, 29, 34 A 2 -part kit of liquid polyurethane foam, which when mixed an...|$|R
