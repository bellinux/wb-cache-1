40|$|This {{research}} {{is a report}} of the findings of a study of the information seeking behaviour of <b>agricultural</b> <b>scientists</b> working in the Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) institutions of Delhi, and Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana. A structured questionnaire was developed to explore the information seeking behaviour of <b>agricultural</b> <b>scientists.</b> Data collected were analysed using the latest version of MS-Excel for appropriate statistical procedures for description (frequencies, per cent, means, and standard deviations), etc. The paper discusses the findings of various strategies and procedures adopted by the <b>agricultural</b> <b>scientists</b> in meeting their information requirement. The <b>agricultural</b> <b>scientists</b> were asked to rank the information sources indicating their order of priority while seeking information. They were asked to use a scale in order to their priority on the basis of I, II and III. The results show that <b>agricultural</b> <b>scientists</b> have expressed great dependence in meeting their information requirement on their institutional library/information centre. Seventy-two per cent of the respondents for all categories of <b>agricultural</b> <b>scientists</b> preferred their library/information centre as the most preferred source. For accessing information <b>agricultural</b> <b>scientists</b> highly depend on the library collection, followed by the personal collection, collection of their supervisor and of colleagues in order of decreasing priority...|$|R
