25|$|Lisa {{protests that}} the Simpsons cannot accept the tobacco executives' money, but Homer misinterprets this {{statement}} and rejects the offer as insulting, demanding $150 billion for tomacco, which they refuse. Dumped {{back at the}} farmhouse, the family sees tomacco-addicted animals from other farms eating their crops. With only one plant left, the family runs into the house, where Lisa urges Homer to destroy it, but Homer refuses until the livestock breaks in. He tosses the plant {{into the air and}} it lands {{in the hands of a}} Laramie executive. The executives' helicopter leaves, but a tomacco-addicted sheep has sneaked on board and attacks them. The helicopter crashes, killing everyone on board except for the sheep and destroying the final tomacco plant. The Simpsons return home to find that the Southern gentleman and his wife <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> Homer to go through the duel. Homer does and is shot in the arm, but declines to go to the hospital until after eating one of Marge's mincemeat pies.|$|E

They locate the fourth Star Piece on Star Hill and learn that Mallow's real parents <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> him to return. The five travel to Seaside Town, where the residents inform them that a Star Piece has fallen in the sunken ship in the lake that is owned by the Jonathan Johnny Jones, a shark pirate. After defeating a giant blooper named King Calamari (who was responsible for sinking the ship) and challenging Jones and his crew to a fight, they win the fifth Star Piece. Returning to Seaside Town, they discover that the townsfolk are actually Yaridovich (another member of the Smithy Gang) in disguise. He threatens the real townsfolk in order to force Mario to hand over the Star Piece. He tries to escape with it but is unable to when his ride doesn't arrive.

2500|$|On 8 June 2011, Williams {{said that}} the British Government was {{committing}} Britain to [...] "radical, long-term policies for which no-one voted". Writing in the New Statesman magazine, Williams raised concerns about the coalition's health, education and welfare reforms. He said there was [...] "indignation" [...] {{due to a lack}} of [...] "proper public argument". He also {{said that the}} [...] "Big Society" [...] idea was viewed with [...] "widespread suspicion", noting also that [...] "we <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> a full and robust account of what the Left would do differently and what a Left-inspired version of localism would look like". The article also said there was concern that the government would abandon its responsibility for tackling child poverty, illiteracy and poor access to the best schools. He also expressed concern about the [...] "quiet resurgence of the seductive language of 'deserving' and 'undeserving' poor" [...] and the steady pressure to increase [...] "what look like punitive responses to alleged abuses of the system". In response, David Cameron said that he “profoundly disagreed” with Williams's claim that the government was forcing through “radical policies for which no one voted”. Cameron said that the government was acting in a “good and moral” fashion and defended the “Big Society” and the Coalition’s deficit reduction, welfare and education plans. “I am absolutely convinced that our policies are about actually giving people a greater responsibility and greater chances in their life, and I will defend those very vigorously”, he said. “By all means let us have a robust debate but I can tell you, it will always be a two-sided debate.” ...|$|E

60|$|All {{this is only}} {{an analogy}} and proves nothing. However, it may suggest, if one thinks about it, that {{possibly}} {{we have made a}} slightly similar mistake about the animals; that we are not quite through with them when we have cried instinct and named their species, nor altogether justified in killing them industriously {{off the face of the}} earth--as we once did with the poor Beothuk Indians for the skins that they wore. Beneath their fur and feathers is their life; and a few observers are learning that their life also, with its faint suggestion of our own primeval childhood, is one of intense human interest. Some of them plan and calculate; and mathematics, however elementary, is hardly a matter of instinct. Some of them build dams and canals; some have definite social regulations; some rescue comrades; some bind their own wounds, and even set a broken leg, as will be seen in one of the following chapters. All higher orders communicate more or less with each other, and train their young, and modify their habits to meet changing conditions. These things, and many more quite as wonderful, are also facts. We <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> the naturalist who will tell us truly what they mean.|$|E
