5000|$|In 1855 {{one of the}} {{original}} Turner brothers built, in partnership with another, a cotton mill called Clod Mill alongside the river, at Spotland Fold. The firm of Turner Brothers was formed in 1871, and diversified firstly into the manufacture of asbestos packing, then, by 1879, into weaving <b>asbestos</b> <b>yarn</b> and asbestos cloth. It rapidly assumed a national, and later a global, prominence. The Clod Mill site expanded considerably. Later still, the firm manufactured combination products with rubber and asbestos, including clutch and brake linings, leading to the mill complex being described as [...] "Asbestos and India Rubber Works" [...] in 1910. With the growing awareness {{in the third quarter of}} the 20th Century of the health risks of asbestos, and a growing number of asbestosis claims from past and present employees, the company went into decline, and ceased operations on site. Partial demolition of the works commenced in 2001, though problems continued until 2013.|$|E

25|$|Nellie Kershaw {{was born}} to Elizabeth and Arthur Kershaw in Rochdale in 1891. In 1903 she left school, aged 12, to take up {{employment}} as a cotton rover in a cotton mill and 5 months later began working at Garsides asbestos mill. She transferred to Turner Brothers Asbestos on 31 December 1917, where she was employed as a rover, spinning raw <b>asbestos</b> fibre into <b>yarn.</b> She was married to Frank Kershaw, a slater's labourer, and had at least one child, a daughter born in about 1920.|$|R
2500|$|The first {{diagnosis}} of asbestosis {{was made in}} the UK in 1924. Nellie Kershaw was employed at Turner Brothers Asbestos in Manchester, England from 1917, spinning raw <b>asbestos</b> fibre into <b>yarn.</b> Her death in 1924 led to a formal inquest. Pathologist Dr William Edmund Cooke testified that his examination of the lungs indicated old scarring indicative of a previous, healed, tuberculosis infection, and extensive fibrosis, in which were visible [...] "particles of mineral matter... of various [...] shapes, but the large majority have sharp angles." [...] Having compared these particles with samples of asbestos dust provided by Dr S.A. Henry, His Majesty's Medical Inspector of Factories, Cooke concluded that they [...] "originated from asbestos and were, beyond a reasonable doubt, the [...] primary cause of the fibrosis of the lungs and therefore of death".|$|R
40|$|Phenolic {{friction}} composite (PFC) of the non-woven type {{clutch facing}} {{was made from}} whole asbestos yam and zinc wire cored <b>asbestos</b> <b>yarn,</b> by dipping in rn-phenol based formaldehyde resin. The moulding was performed at a temperature of 140 'C and was post-cured for 2 h. The coefficient of friction of the PFC showed {{a decrease in the}} 3 rd to 4 th cycle when testing was performed at an interface temperature of 250 °C. Gravimetric analysis showed some loss in weight when the unpost-cured PFC was exposed to 300 °C. This was attributed to the presence of moisture and the volatile materials formed from the decomposed ingredients. Similar phenomenon was expected to occur when the coefficient of friction testing performed at higher temperatures. It was shown that the moisture increases the coefficient of friction, whereas, the volatiles decrease it and even prevents the effect of moisture. Extending the post-curing time to 4 h helps in elimination of this slippage behaviour and marginally improves many desirable properties.
