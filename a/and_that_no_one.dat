The people of Ocute explained that the great wilderness separated them, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> alive had ever crossed it due to the war, despite what De Soto's guide had claimed. Nevertheless, the army departed on April 13. A party from Ocute initially joined the Spanish to raid Cofitachequi, but De Soto sent them home upon realizing there was no easy way through the wilderness.|$|E
5|$|Although his {{prestige}} {{was on the}} rise, Rosas made {{no serious}} attempts to further liberalise his regime. Every year he presented his resignation and the pliant House of Representatives predictably declined, claiming that maintaining him in office was vital for the nation's welfare. Rosas also allowed exiled Argentines {{to return to their}} homeland, but only because he was so confident of his control <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> was willing to risk defying him. The execution in August 1848 of the pregnant young Camila O'Gorman, charged with a forbidden romance with a priest, caused a backlash throughout the continent. Nonetheless, it served as a clear warning that Rosas had no intention of loosening his grip.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, most {{financial}} institutions and some economists feel that all too often, banks are accused unfairly of discrimination against minority owned businesses when said business is simply not worth such a credit risk, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> would find such a decision discriminatory if the business were not minority owned. These charges of reverse racism or prejudicial analysis are a longstanding source of controversy {{in the study of}} economic discrimination.|$|E

25|$|In 1777, George Rogers Clark was a 25-year-old {{major in}} the Kentucky County, Virginia, militia. Clark {{believed}} that he could end the raids on Kentucky by capturing the British posts in the Illinois Country and then moving against Detroit. In April 1777, Clark sent two spies into the Illinois country. They returned after two months and reported that the fort at Kaskaskia was unguarded, that the French-speaking residents were not greatly attached to the British, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> expected an attack from Kentucky.

25|$|During the hearings, a {{photograph}} of Schine was introduced, and Joseph Welch accused Cohn of doctoring the image to show Schine alone with Army Secretary Robert T. Stevens. On the witness stand Cohn and Schine both insisted that the picture entered into evidence (Schine and Stevens alone) was requested by Stevens <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> was edited out of the photograph. Welch then produced a wider shot of Stevens and Schine with McGuire AFB wing commander Colonel Jack Bradley standing to Schine's right.

25|$|During {{the speech}} former General {{secretary}} Jiang Zemin seemed very tired, was constantly yawning, {{and was not}} paying much attention. Jiang seldom talked to Wen Jiabao, who was sitting to his left. Wen was paying full attention to Hu's speech for its entire length. Hong Kong media noted that Jiang left the Great Hall without shaking anyone's hand, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> came up to shake his. Surprisingly, Mao's successor Hua Guofeng also attended the Congress as a delegate.

25|$|Ebroin endeavoured to {{maintain}} {{at any rate}} the union of Neustria and Burgundy, but the great Burgundian nobles too wished to remain independent. They rose under bishop Leodegar (or Léger) of Autun, and defeated Ebroin and Theuderic. They decided to tonsure Ebroin, interning him in the monastery of Luxeuil. A proclamation was then issued {{to the effect that}} each kingdom should keep its own laws and customs, {{that there should be no}} further interchange of functionaries between the kingdoms, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> should again set up a tyranny like that of Ebroin.

I wanted {{people to know that}} thousands upon thousands of their fellow citizens were being assaulted daily, and that the police—in this case, the federal government—had done nothing to remedy the situation.

25|$|Another {{significant}} step towards achieving a final agreement {{was made on}} January 19, with the announcement of a trilateral mechanism for the verification and monitoring of a final ceasefire, cessation of hostilities and surrender of weapons composed of the government, the FARC and a political mission of the United Nations composed by observers from member states of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC). The international component would preside and coordinate the mechanism. In other words, the negotiators asked the United Nations Security Council to create such a political mission with unarmed observers for a renewable 12-month period. The decision was highlighted by negotiators from both sides as an historic step {{towards the end of}} the conflict and confirmation of both parties' commitment to peace. Peace commissioner Sergio Jaramillo said that, with the UN Security Council involved, the government and the FARC would have to fulfill their obligations. FARC Secretariat member Carlos Antonio Losada, in an interview with Semana, noted that the bilateral ceasefire had been installed on the ground by the force of events <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> would accept that this situation be reversed, specially with the UN involved. President Santos had previously contacted the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council to secure their support, and the FARC had been convinced following consultations with UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon.|$|E

500|$|Personally, Burnside {{was always}} very popular, both {{in the army and}} in politics. He made friends easily, smiled a lot, and remembered everyone's name.

In response, the townspeople banish the real Skinner from town by tying him to a chair on a flatcar of a freight train.
