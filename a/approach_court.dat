Using a mixed method <b>approach,</b> <b>court</b> records were examined over a five year period and interviews with thirty fathers were conducted. The data reveal that the majority of fathers were in non-marital relationships, pointing to the vulnerability of children born within such unions especially when family finances are scarce. Perceptions on the father child relationship were sought from fathers on their relationship with their children. The study found that fathers understood their financial responsibilities to their children and yearned for improved relationships with their offspring but their economic situation, relationships with the mother of the child, geographic proximity, family of origin and the court system hindered these relationships. Options to consider when fathers cannot meet their financial commitment have been proposed...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{argues that}} New Zealand 2 ̆ 7 s current youth justice system, which was {{introduced}} {{with so much}} hope for Māori, has not delivered as was envisaged. Abstract New Zealand’s youth justice system in the 1980 s {{was the subject of}} growing public dissatisfaction and criticism. There was a heavy emphasis on charging, followed by formalised “official” decision making and a relatively high reliance on the institutionalisation of young offenders. Families and communities felt disempowered. In particular, Māori (the indigenous peoples of Aotearoa New Zealand) claimed to be marginalised and disadvantaged by the mono-cultural process. The enactment of the Children, Young Persons and their Families Act in 1989, which in today’s public climate might struggle to be passed, introduced a new paradigm. Namely, a clear two-fold emphasis in the legislation: first, on not charging young offenders and if at all possible using Police organised alternative responses; and, secondly (where Police diversion was not possible), relying on the Family Group Conference (FGC) - both as a diversionary mechanism to avoid charging, and as the prime decision making mechanism for all charges that were not denied or which were subsequently proved. Clear principles were also enshrined, emphasising the importance of involving and strengthening whānau (family), hapū (sub-tribe) and family group in all decision making and interventions. The FGC paved the way for a restorative justice approach (although the term was not en vogue at the time the legislation was passed) and increasingly the Youth Court adopted a therapeutic, multi-disciplinary <b>approach.</b> <b>Court</b> numbers plummeted, government youth residences and prisons were closed, and youth offending rates stabilised. Yet the challenge presented by a “hard core” group of problematic youth offenders, about 5...|$|E

40|$|Social media {{posts and}} {{photographs}} are increasingly denied admission as evidence in criminal trials. Courts often cite issues with authentication when refusing to admit social media evidence. Cases and academic writings separate recent case law into two approaches: The Maryland Approach and the Texas Approach. The first method {{is often seen}} as overly skeptical of social media evidence, setting the bar too high for admissibility. The second approach is viewed as more lenient, declaring that any reasonable evidence should be admitted {{in order for a}} jury to weigh its sufficiency. This Brief addresses the supposed differences between the two sets of cases and suggests that courts are not actually employing two distinct approaches. The Maryland <b>Approach</b> <b>courts</b> are not holding social media content to a higher standard than the Texas <b>Approach</b> <b>courts,</b> but are merely responding to a lack of evidence connecting the proffered content to the purported author...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} paper I have {{analyzed}} the institution of renvoi, institution specific to the international private law, because it indicates importance from theoretical {{point of view and}} practical point of view, too. Thereby, the renvoi interferes in case of a negative conflict of laws which take place related to a juridical report with a foreign element. In this case the question arises whether the report will be settled by the law, because both the conflict norm of the <b>approached</b> <b>court</b> of law and the foreign conflict norm are declaring themselves unqualified in solving the refered to report. Thus, renvoi reperesents the juridical situation emerged when the conflict norm of the <b>approached</b> <b>court</b> of law refers to a foreign law system, and this, by its own conflict norm, doesn’t get the competence which is adjudged to it and it sends back to the forum law, or sends farther to a law of a third party state.
