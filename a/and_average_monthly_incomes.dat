Epilepsy affects various aspects of ones' social life. The present study aimed to investigate the influence of marital status {{on the quality of}} life of adult Chinese patients with epilepsy. Methods: This study surveyed 805 Chinese adults who have been clinically diagnosed with epilepsy for longer than 1 year in 11 hospitals in Beijing. In this survey, 532 (66. 1 %) participants were married. All of them completed the case report form with enquiries on demographic data, social factors, and illness. The marriage status of adult epileptic quality of life was the dependent variable, and demographic data and clinical data were independent variables, analyzed through the multiple linear regression analysis methods. The patients' quality of life was assessed using the Quality of Life in patients with Epilepsy- 31 items (QOLIE- 31) questionnaire, the Patient Health Questionnaire- 9 items (PHQ- 9), and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder- 7 items (GAD- 7). Results: The PHQ- 9 and GAD- 7 scores in the unmarried group (PHQ- 9 = 6. 0 and GAD- 7 = 5. 0) were significantly higher than that of the married group (PHQ- 9 = 4. 0 and GAD- 7 = 3. 0). The scores of married adult patients with epilepsy on QOLIE (61. 8 ± 15. 3) and social function (70. 9 ± 22. 7) were higher than the scores of the unmarried patients aged between 20 and 44 years. The scores of married adult epileptics on the QOLIE (58. 4 ± 14. 6) and the energy/fatigue (62. 1 ± 20. 4) were higher than the scores of the unmarried patients (QOLIE = 58. 4 ± 14. 6 and the energy/fatigue = 62. 1 ± 20. 4) aged between 45 and 59 years.

40|$|OBJETIVO: A relação entre renda e mortalidade por violência vem sendo estudada nos últimos anos. A Síntese de Indicadores Sociais 2002, lançada pelo IBGE, refere que o traço mais marcante da sociedade brasileira é a desigualdade. O propósito do estudo é testar a associação entre as taxas de homicídios e alguns indicadores de saúde e socioeconômicos. MÉTODOS: Estudo ecológico, de corte transversal. Foram analisados dados do Município de São Paulo, ano 2000, quanto a coeficientes de homicídios e cinco indicadores: taxa de mortalidade infantil, renda média do chefe de família, percentual de adolescentes de 15 a 17 anos que não freqüentavam a escola, percentual de adolescentes grávidas de 14 a 17 anos e densidade demográfica. Para testar essas associações foram utilizados o coeficiente de correlação de Pearson e a regressão linear múltipla. RESULTADOS: O coeficiente de homicídios foi 57, 3 / 100. 000. A correlação entre taxas de homicídios e renda média foi negativa e forte (r=- 0, 65). Maiores coeficientes foram encontrados nos distritos com menor renda e menores naqueles com maiores rendas. Para o percentual de adolescentes que não freqüentavam a escola (r= 0, 68) e para o percentual de adolescentes grávidas (r= 0, 67) a associação encontrada foi positiva e forte. Para a taxa de mortalidade infantil a correlação encontrada foi r= 0, 24 (para todos p OBJECTIVE: The {{relation}} between income and mortality due to violence {{has been studied}} in recent years. The Synthesis of Social Indicators of 2002 [Síntese de Indicadores Sociais, 2002], published by The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), states {{that one of the}} most outstanding characteristic of Brazilian society is inequality. The proposal of this ecological study was to test the association between homicide rates, and some health and socioeconomic indicators. METHODS: This is an ecological cross-sectional study. Data regarding Sao Paulo City, Brazil in the year 2000 was analyzed. The association between homicide coefficients and the following five indicators were tested: infant mortality rates, <b>monthly</b> <b>average</b> <b>income</b> of household heads, percentage of adolescents aged 15 to 17 years not attending school, proportion of pregnant adolescent women aged 14 to 17 years and demographic density. Pearson's correlation coefficient and a multiple linear regression model were utilized to test these associations. RESULTS: The municipal homicide rate was 57. 3 / 100, 000. The cor{{relation between}} homicide rates <b>and</b> <b>average</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>income</b> was strong <b>and</b> negative (r=- 0. 65). Higher homicide rates were found in the districts whose inhabitants had lower incomes and lower rates were found in those districts whose inhabitants had higher incomes. The correlation between homicide rates and proportion of adolescents not attending school was positive and strong (r= 0. 68). The correlation between homicide rates and the proportion of pregnant adolescent women was positive and strong (r= 0. 67). The correlation between homicides and the rate of infant mortality was r= 0. 24 (for all: p< 0. 05). The correlation between demographic density and homicides was not significant. Although the univariate regression was positive for four indicators, the multivariate regression test was only significant for <b>average</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>income</b> (negative) <b>and</b> proportion of adolescents not attending school (positive) (for both indicators: p< 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the problem of homicides and socioeconomic disparities in S. Paulo City.

50|$|Alongside {{other ethnic}} groups, Indians from all social {{backgrounds}} have achieved significant advances in their educational levels, income, life expectancy {{and other social}} indicators. Singapore's extraordinary economic growth from the 1960s to 1990s lifted many out of poverty and created a broad middle class. In the process, many Indians experienced upward social mobility for the first time. Despite this progress, Indians remain somewhat stratified in terms of class relative to other ethnic groups. With the influx of highly qualified Indian Permanent Residents, the socio-economic indicators of the Indian community have improved, arguably masking the under-achievement of some Indians. In 2005, both the <b>average</b> <b>and</b> median <b>monthly</b> <b>income</b> for Indian Residents (S$3,660 and $2,480 respectively) exceeded those for all Residents (S$3,500 and S$2,410 respectively).

In addition, we investigate how far non-disease-specific HRQoL measures can distinguish groups in terms of sociodemographic characteristics. The Portuguese versions of the EQ- 5 D, SF- 6 D, AQLQ(S) and ACQ were administered using personal interviews to a representative sample of the Portuguese population with asthma. Most of the individuals did not report significant problems in the dimensions used, {{with the exception of the}} physical functioning, where individuals reported moderate limitations. The mean utility value was 0. 86. Male gender, young, single, individuals with high educational attainment level, employed, individuals with high income and those residing in urban areas reported higher utility levels. As expected, those who were in a severe stadium of the disease reported lower mean utility levels than those who were in a less severe stadium of the disease. Normative values for the SF- 6 D were computed for patients with asthma by gender, age, marital status, educational attainment level, employment status, area of residence <b>and</b> <b>average</b> <b>monthly</b> net <b>income.</b> The preference-based measures used in this study distinguish patient groups with asthma in terms of socio-demographic groups. The normative values can be used in economic evaluation and clinical studies as they incorporate patients’ preferences and translate the value attributed to patients’ health state.

Removing the differences of economic development between the regions among the European Union embodies one of the strategic objectives of the policy of European economic cohesion. In the view of achieving an intra and inter-regional cohesion, we consider that a great significance corresponds to the programmes of non-refundable financing, operationalized by means of structural Instruments of regional development. Highlighting the effects of non-refundable financing upon the economic development of the regions implies the identification of its determinant factors, the dynamic of the absorption level of available funds and a comparative ex-ante analysis during {{the implementation of the}} project and another one, ex-post. This is why there will be made a study upon the two Romanian regions with different level of economic development: the West Region (area {{with a high level of}} economic development) and the Nord-East Region (area with a low level of economic development). In order to measure the economic differences between the two regions and to highlight the level of economic development influenced by the non-refundable finances allocated by the European Union, we will take into consideration synthetic indicators, relevant for the analysis and comparable in terms of space. Therefore, the specific indicators relevant to the objective of our study are: the GDP - indicator for measuring the level of development, the Unemployment Rate - indicator for characterising the local labour market, <b>and</b> the <b>Average</b> <b>Monthly</b> <b>Income</b> due to its influence upon the standard of living.

With help from the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations, Marcos brought the Green Revolution (industrialized, chemical agriculture) to the Philippines. These reforms resulted in high profits for transnational corporations, but were generally harmful to small, peasant farmers who were often pushed into poverty. After declaring martial law in 1972, Marcos promised to implement agrarian reforms. However, the land reforms served largely to undermine Marcos's landholder opponents, not to lessen inequality in the countryside, and encouraged conversion to cash tenancy and greater reliance on farm workers. Under Marcos, timber products were among the nation's top exports but little attention was paid to the environmental impacts of deforestation as cronies never complied with reforestation agreements. By the early 1980s, forestry collapsed because most of the Philippines' accessible forests had been depleted—of the 12 million hectares of forestland, about 7 million had been left barren." ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Little {{is known}} about the {{nutritional}} adequacy and feasibility of breastmilk replacement options recommended by WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF. The study aim was to explore suitability of the 2001 feeding recommendations for infants of HIV-infected mothers for a rural region in KwaZulu Natal, South Africa specifically with respect to adequacy of micronutrients and essential fatty acids, cost, and preparation times of replacement milks. METHODS: Nutritional adequacy, cost, and preparation time of home-prepared replacement milks containing powdered full cream milk (PM) and fresh full cream milk (FM) and different micronutrient supplements (2 g UNICEF micronutrient sachet, government supplement routinely available in district public health clinics, and best available liquid paediatric supplement found in local pharmacies) were compared. Costs of locally available ingredients for replacement milk were used to calculate monthly costs for infants aged one, three, and six months. Total monthly costs of ingredients of commercial and home-prepared replacement milks were compared with each other <b>and</b> the <b>average</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>income</b> of domestic or shop workers. Time needed to prepare one feed of replacement milk was simulated. FINDINGS: When mixed with water, sugar, and each micronutrient supplement, PM and FM provided < 50 % of estimated required amounts for vitamins E and C, folic acid, iodine, and selenium and < 75 % for zinc and pantothenic acid. PM and FM made with UNICEF micronutrient sachets provided 30 % adequate intake for niacin. FM prepared with any micronutrient supplement provided no more than 32 % vitamin D. All PMs provided more than adequate amounts of vitamin D. Compared with the commercial formula, PM and FM provided 8 - 60 % of vitamins A, E, and C, folic acid, manganese, zinc, and iodine. Preparations of PM and FM provided 11 % minimum recommended linoleic acid and 67 % minimum recommended alpha-linolenic acid per 450 ml mixture. It took 21 - 25 minutes to optimally prepare 120 ml of replacement feed from PM or commercial infant formula and 30 - 35 minutes for the fresh milk preparation. PM or FM cost approximately 20 % of <b>monthly</b> <b>income</b> <b>averaged</b> over {{the first six months of}} life; commercial formula cost approximately 32 %. CONCLUSION: No home-prepared replacement milks in South Africa meet all estimated micronutrient and essential fatty acid requirements of infants aged < 6 months. Commercial infant formula is the only replacement milk that meets all nutritional needs. Revisions of WHO/UNAIDS/UNICEF HIV and infant feeding course replacement milk options are needed. If replacement milks are to provide total nutrition, preparations should include vegetable oils, such as soybean oil, as a source of linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids, and additional vitamins and minerals...|$|R

This research consisted of two phases: in the first one the LPA foundation process was characterized, with the evaluation of {{the first three years of}} the arrangement operation (2005 - 2007). LPA managers were interviewed, a sample of 20 clothing workers, which was divided into two groups according to the degree of participation in the arrangement actions (attendance) : group A, with a high degree of participation and involvement with LPA; and group B (control), with low degree of participation and involvement with LPA. In the second phase, the goal was to know the degree of involvement of the clothing workers in the LPA, to characterize the clothing and the businessmen families and to investigate the LPA consequences on both environments. In general, most of the actions proposed by the Action Plan in 2005 was held until 2007. Clothing workers of group A showed higher level of involvement with LPA, with greater awareness of the Plan of Action, and were more present in the arrangement actions as compared to the group B. Most of the industries are micro or small businesses, averaged 15 years, manufacture parts based on the "jeans" and their production is targeted to adult consumers. The participation of clothing workers in LPA improved the clothing business, such as structure and layout of the firms, access to credit, product quality, HR management, finance, employee training, and relationship with the network business and energy efficiency. Businessmen of group A observed greater improvement in their businesses.

Depression {{is one of the}} most common mental disorders affecting 121 million people in the world, and it frequently goes unrecognized among patients. It is estimated that 5 %– 10 % of the population at any given time is suffering from identifiable depression needing psychiatric or psychosocial intervention. An institution-based cross-sectional study design was implemented to determine the magnitude and associated factors of unrecognized depression among patients attending the adult medical outpatient department in Adare Hospital, Hawassa, Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples’ Region, Ethiopia, among 326 patients selected using systematic random sampling technique. Data were collected using the interviewer-administered technique. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data on sociodemographic characteristics and other independent variables. Depression was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9. Data were entered and analyzed using SPSS 20.
