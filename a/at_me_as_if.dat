500|$|In 1847 Felix Mendelssohn {{attended}} a London performance of Robert – an opera which musically he despised – {{in order to}} hear Jenny Lind's British debut, {{in the role of}} Alice. The music critic Henry Chorley, who was with him, wrote [...] "I see as I write the smile with which Mendelssohn, whose enjoyment of Mdlle. Lind's talent was unlimited, turned round and looked <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> a load of anxiety had been taken off his mind." ...|$|E
500|$|At Fairbanks, {{the three}} B-29s {{encountered}} significant headwinds; {{more than the}} [...] "slight" [...] headwinds observed up to this time. They had expected tailwinds from the jet stream, yet could complete the distance without them, but headwinds meant that Washington might be too far. At 7am Eastern War Time, aircraft Number 2 was over Northway, Alaska, and navigator Bill Townes determined that they were behind schedule. He said later, [...] "When I reported that fact to General LeMay, he looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{he thought it was}} my fault, so I retreated behind my bulkhead to check my figures." [...] Later, the airmen learned that the typhoon near Okinawa the week before had greatly affected the jet stream.|$|E
500|$|Nielsen's half-uncle Jean Hersholt was {{an actor}} {{known for his}} {{portrayal}} of Dr. Christian in a radio series of that name, and the subsequent television series and films. In a 1994 Boston Globe article, Nielsen explained, [...] "I did learn very early that when I would mention my uncle, people would look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I were the biggest liar in the world. Then I would take them home and show them 8-by-10 glossies, and things changed quite drastically. So I {{began to think that}} maybe this acting business was not a bad idea, much as I was very shy about it and certainly without courage regarding it. My uncle died not too long after I {{was in a position to}} know him. I regret that I had not a chance to know him better." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mysie {{coloured}} and answered, 'I don't know; I saw the Fitzhughs look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>at</b> first <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{they did}} not think I belonged, and Ivinghoe was always so awfully polite that I thought he was laughing at me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|He looked round <b>at</b> <b>me</b> now, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> in {{recognition}} of my understanding him; then ever so gently, [...] "To let me alone," [...] he replied.|$|R
60|$|He looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> queerly, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I {{were beyond}} his comprehension, {{picked up his}} hat, called out that he would see me in the morning, and was gone.|$|R
500|$|Mendelssohn met {{and worked}} with Lind many times, and started an opera, Lorelei, for her, based on {{the legend of the}} Lorelei Rhine maidens; the opera was {{unfinished}} at his death. He is said to have tailored the aria [...] "Hear Ye Israel" [...] in his oratorio Elijah to Lind's voice, although she did not sing this part until after his death, at a concert in December 1848. In 1847 Mendelssohn attended a London performance of Meyerbeer's Robert le diable– an opera which musically he despised– in order to hear Lind's British debut, in the role of Alice. The music critic Henry Chorley, who was with him, wrote [...] "I see as I write the smile with which Mendelssohn, whose enjoyment of Mdlle. Lind's talent was unlimited, turned round and looked <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> a load of anxiety had been taken off his mind. His attachment to Mlle. Lind's genius as a singer was unbounded, as was his desire for her success".|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} published in ABC Film Review in November 1964, Cushing stated, [...] "People look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I were {{some sort of}} monster, but I can't think why. In my macabre pictures, I have either been a monster-maker or a monster-destroyer, but never a monster. Actually, I'm a gentle fellow. Never harmed a fly. I love animals, and when I'm in the country I'm a keen bird-watcher." [...] In {{an interview}} published in 1966, he added, [...] "I do get terribly tired with the neighbourhood kids telling me 'My mum says she wouldn't want to meet you in a dark alley'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mendelssohn {{was present}} at Lind's London debut in Robert le Diable, and his friend, the critic H. F. Chorley, who was with him, wrote [...] "I see as I write the smile with which Mendelssohn, whose {{enjoyment}} of Mdlle. Lind's talent was unlimited, turned round and looked <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> a load of anxiety had been taken off his mind. His attachment to Mademoiselle Lind's genius as a singer was unbounded, as was his desire for her success". Mendelssohn worked with Lind on many occasions and wrote the beginnings of an opera, Lorelei, for her, based on {{the legend of the}} Lorelei Rhine maidens; the opera was unfinished at his death. He included a high F sharp in his oratorio Elijah ("Hear Ye Israel") with Lind's voice in mind.|$|E
6000|$|He took {{no notice}} of her; he looked <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> but <b>as</b> <b>if,</b> instead of <b>me,</b> {{he saw what}} he spoke of. [...] "For general uncanny ugliness and horror and pain." ...|$|R
6000|$|Jacko {{looked again}} at the pear and put one finger towards it with great caution, but drew back and looked up <b>at</b> <b>me</b> again, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> to say, [...] "Won't you help me?" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{sprang to}} his feet, and looked a {{question}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> clear <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he had spoken.|$|R
60|$|Traddles looked <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he {{wondered}} what I was talking about.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Dick {{looked hard}} <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> to {{identify}} {{me in this}} character.|$|E
60|$|My {{mother looked}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she doubted the {{evidence}} of her own senses.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No change, sir, {{for better}} or wuss. Will you please to walk in, sir? She lies there takin' no notice o' nothin', no more nor a baby as is on'y a week old, an' looks <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> blank <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she didn't know me. O what can it be, Mr. Gilfil? How come she to leave the Manor? How's his honour an' my lady?' ...|$|R
60|$|The joy {{passed from}} her face. She glanced <b>at</b> <b>me</b> a moment <b>as</b> <b>if</b> without understanding.|$|R
60|$|She stopped, {{and looked}} <b>at</b> <b>me</b> doubtingly, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she felt far from sure, poor soul, of winning my {{confidence}} to begin with. I acted on that hint, with the headlong impetuosity {{of a man}} who was in love.|$|R
60|$|My lady stared <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I knew. And I didn't know. And that perplexed me afresh.|$|E
60|$|My {{navigator}} threw a quick, jealous glance <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he distrusted {{the nature}} of the question.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Dick {{secretly}} {{shook his}} head <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he thought there was no getting over this.|$|E
60|$|She looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> expectantly, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{she were}} {{waiting for me to}} swoon, or yell, or something. I took a steady look at Clarence's effort. It was another Classical picture. It seemed to me very much like the other one.|$|R
6000|$|He looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> again, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he {{expected}} <b>me</b> {{to say something}} more. I remained silent. He took a letter out of the breast-pocket of his coat {{and laid it on}} the table before me--just where the Confession had lain before I destroyed it! ...|$|R
60|$|Sir Percival looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> sharply, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he {{was about}} to say something. But at the same moment, Madame Fosco {{attracted}} his attention by rising from her chair. She had caught her husband's eye, and had evidently received her orders to leave the room.|$|R
60|$|She {{compressed}} {{her lips}} with an angry glance <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I {{could help her}} wrinkles, then she sighed.|$|E
60|$|She {{lifted her}} {{face from the}} floor, and looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she doubted whether she had heard aright.|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} imagine why Dora had been making tempting little faces <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she wanted to kiss me.|$|E
60|$|She looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> hopefully, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I were a mine of ideas. Her {{voice was}} level, without a {{suggestion}} of fear in it. Women have the gift of being courageous at times when they might legitimately give way. It {{is part of their}} unexpectedness.|$|R
60|$|The gentleman {{was serious}} immediately, and looked <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> I thought, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he would entreat {{me to say}} nothing about the window.|$|R
6000|$|Hiram looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> in surprise, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> not {{crediting}} all I told him, and then, much <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{dismissing the}} matter from his mind, he said: ...|$|R
60|$|I saw {{her thin}} lips working while she looked <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they {{were eager to}} load her with reproaches.|$|E
60|$|They {{all stood}} looking <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they {{was waiting for}} something. I folded my arms--tight--and stared back at 'em.|$|E
6000|$|... "To"--the Story Girl threw {{a defiant}} glance <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> to say, [...] "You can't spoil the {{surprise}} of THIS, anyway,"--"to--the Awkward Man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Out?" [...] he repeated. For {{a moment}} he looked <b>at</b> <b>me</b> intently, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I had started some new idea in his mind. I asked as lightly <b>as</b> I could <b>if</b> I had said {{anything}} to surprise him. Instead of answering me, he sprang to his feet with a cry of terror, and left the room.|$|R
6000|$|... "She looks <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> cool <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I {{was the man}} come to {{see about}} the weeding of the garden, but I thought I saw just a slight twinkle of fun in her eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{speak in}} such a strange way. Oh, Frances, I have been longing for you to keep me company! And now you are here, you look <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> coldly <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I had {{offended}} you. Perhaps you are not well?" ...|$|R
