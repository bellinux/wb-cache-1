A red-colored artificial ruby {{may also be}} achieved by doping chromium(III) into artificial corundum crystals, thus making chromium a requirement for making synthetic rubies.

25|$|The <b>aluminum</b> <b>oxide</b> {{serves as}} {{dielectric}} and also protects the metallic aluminum against aggressive chemical reactions from the electrolyte. However, the converted layer of <b>aluminum</b> <b>oxide</b> {{is usually not}} homogeneous. It forms a complex multilayer structured laminate of amorphous, crystalline and porous crystalline <b>aluminum</b> <b>oxide</b> mostly covered with small residual parts of unconverted aluminum hydroxide. For this reason, {{in the formation of}} the anode foil, the oxide film is structured by a special chemical treatment so that either an amorphous oxide or a crystalline oxide is formed. The amorphous oxide variety yields higher mechanical and physical stability and fewer defects, thus increasing the long term stability and lowering the leakage current.|$|E

When it is emitted into the environment, it imposed many adverse health and environmental impacts, such as impairment of respiratory system, reduction of visibility and acid rain. Traditional sulfur dioxide removal technologies have the disadvantages disposal of large amount of by-products with low market value.;Fly ash, a by-product of coal combustion rich in iron and <b>aluminum</b> <b>oxides</b> and sodium chlorate as an oxidant were utilized in this project to produce a complex coagulant with the removal of sulfur dioxide in simulated flue gas. Conversion efficiency of iron and <b>aluminum</b> <b>oxides</b> in fly ash was temperature dependant. The removal efficiency of sulfur dioxide was influenced by reaction temperature, diffusing method, and sulfur dioxide initial concentration. The produced complex coagulant performed better in the removal of total suspended solid (TSS) and turbidity in wastewater treatment.;Investigations of reaction kinetics showed that the reaction orders of iron and <b>aluminum</b> <b>oxides</b> under the same reaction temperature are the same. Empirical Arrhenius expressions were derived based on rate constants at each reaction temperature. Reaction kinetics of iron and <b>aluminum</b> <b>oxides</b> in ground and unground fly ash were compared and analyzed.

40|$|Pastures cover nearly 50 million {{hectares}} in the Cerrado region. The Oxisols, which cover approximately half this area, are highly weathered soils composed mainly of kaolinite, iron and <b>aluminum</b> <b>oxides.</b> Iron and <b>aluminum</b> <b>oxides</b> {{have a great}} influence on the retention of phosphorus (P) in these soils. The {{aim of this study}} was to quantify the total phosphorus levels, as well as P availability and retention in Oxisols under pasture in the Cerrado region and to relate the data with soil mineralogical, textural and chemical characteristics. The relations between the studied parameters were analyzed by principal component analysis and linear correlation analysis. The ion-exchange resin extractable P was negatively correlated with mineralogical and texture soil characteristics, and positively with soil organic matter contents. Both the total free and the poorly crystalline oxides were negatively correlated with equilibrium P (Prem). Gibbsite, goethite as well as the total free and poorly crystalline oxides were negatively correlated with Prem, indicating their effects on P adsorption to Cerrado Oxisols. Conversely, kaolinite was not significantly correlated with Prem. The negative correlation between Prem and total carbon (C total) was due to the linear increase of soil carbon with the clay and silt contents. The iron and <b>aluminum</b> <b>oxides</b> were the characteristics that most influenced Prem of Cerrado Oxisols...|$|R

25|$|In the 1970s, this problem, {{which is}} {{particularly}} nettlesome for GaAs-based lasers emitting between 0.630µm and 1µm wavelengths (less so for InP-based lasers used for long-haul telecommunications which emit between 1.3µm and 2µm), was identified. Michael Ettenberg, a researcher and later Vice President at RCA Laboratories' David Sarnoff Research Center in Princeton, New Jersey, devised a solution. A {{thin layer of}} <b>aluminum</b> <b>oxide</b> was deposited on the facet. If the <b>aluminum</b> <b>oxide</b> thickness is chosen correctly, it functions as an anti-reflective coating, reducing reflection at the surface. This alleviated the heating and COD at the facet.|$|E
25|$|The <b>aluminum</b> <b>oxide</b> {{layer in}} the {{electrolytic}} capacitor is resistant to chemical attacks, {{as long as}} the pH value of the electrolyte is in the range of pH 4.5 to 8.5. However, the pH value of the electrolyte is ideally about 7 (neutral); and measurements carried out as early as the 1970s have shown that leakage current is increased, due to chemically induced defects, when the pH value deviates from this ideal value. It is known that water is extremely corrosive to pure aluminum and introduces chemical defects. It is further known that unprotected <b>aluminum</b> <b>oxide</b> dielectrics can be slightly dissolved by alkaline electrolytes, weakening the oxide layer.|$|E
25|$|In this case, it {{may happen}} that the {{hydroxide}} {{formed in the}} first step becomes mechanically detached from the metallic aluminum surface {{and will not be}} transformed into the desired stable form of <b>aluminum</b> <b>oxide.</b> The initial self-healing process for building a new oxide layer is prevented by a defect or a weak dielectric point, and generated hydrogen gas escapes into the capacitor. Then, at the weak point, further formation of aluminum hydroxide is started, and prevented from converting into stable <b>aluminum</b> <b>oxide.</b> The self-healing of the oxide layer inside the electrolytic capacitor can't take place. However, reactions do not come to a standstill, as more and more hydroxide grows in the pores of the anode foil, and the first reaction step produces more and more hydrogen gas in the can, increasing the pressure.|$|E

25|$|Normally the anode foil {{is covered}} by the {{dielectric}} <b>aluminum</b> <b>oxide</b> (Al2O3) layer, which protects the base aluminum metal against the aggressiveness of aqueous alkali solutions. However, some impurities or weak points in the oxide layer offer the possibility for water-driven anodic corrosion that forms aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)3). In e-caps using an alkaline electrolyte this aluminum hydroxide will not be transformed into the desired stable form of <b>aluminum</b> <b>oxide.</b> The weak point remains and the anodic corrosion is ongoing. This corrosive process can be interrupted by protective substances in the electrolyte known as inhibitors or passivators. Inhibitors—such as chromates, phosphates, silicates, nitrates, fluorides, benzoates, soluble oils, and certain other chemicals—can reduce the anodic and cathodic corrosion reactions. However, if inhibitors are used in an insufficient amount, they tend to increase pitting.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{adsorption}} of phosphate on two crystallized <b>aluminum</b> <b>oxides,</b> pseudo-boehmite (pseudo-gamma-AIOOH) and alpha-Al 2 O 3, was studied. The adsorption {{experiments were}} carried out in 0. 01 M KNO 3 solutions at pH 4 and 6, respectively. Adsorption densities were calculated to evaluate the phosphate adsorption affinity for the two <b>aluminum</b> <b>oxides.</b> To better understand the effect of surface properties on the adsorption behavior of phosphate, the surface structure and properties were investigated with X-ray diffraction, N- 2 adsorption-desorption, electron microscope observation and surface acid-base titrations. The results from adsorption isotherms showed that at both pH 4 and 6, pseudo-gamma-AIOOH exhibited greater adsorption capacity than alpha-Al 2 O 3. For both pseudo-gamma-AlOOH and alpha-AL(2) O(3), the adsorbed amount of phosphate at pH 4 was higher than that at pH 6. Adsorption density calculation indicated that alpha-Al 2 O 3 had greater affinity for phosphate than pseudo-gamma-AlOOH. Information gained from examinations of surface properties revealed that the specific surface area {{played an important role}} on adsorption capacity, while the acidity of surface aluminol groups evaluated from acid-base titration curves contributed more to adsorption affinity and consequently the adsorption density.
