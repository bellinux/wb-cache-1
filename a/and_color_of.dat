At that time, Grapico {{consisted of}} a syrup that, when mixed with soda water, had the taste, smell, <b>and</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> a genuine grape drink. The product was artificially colored and flavored with only an infinitesimal amount of grape juice or fruit of the grape.|$|E

5|$|Dramatic performances, often {{accompanied}} by music, were popular in the markets. The actors were distinguished in rank by type <b>and</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> clothing, honing their acting skills at drama schools. Satirical sketches denouncing corrupt government officials were especially popular. Actors on stage always spoke their lines in Classical Chinese; vernacular Chinese that imitated the common spoken language was not introduced into theatrical performances until the subsequent Yuan dynasty. Although trained to speak in the erudite Classical language, acting troupes commonly drew their membership {{from one of the}} lowest social groups in society: prostitutes. Of the fifty some theatres located in the pleasure grounds of Kaifeng, four of these theatres were large enough to entertain audiences of several thousand each, drawing huge crowds which nearby businesses thrived upon.|$|E
5|$|Past {{experiences}} {{or general}} knowledge {{is often called}} upon in conversation, {{so it is a}} useful context for children to learn words. Recalling past experiences allows the child to call upon their own visual, tactical, oral, and/or auditory references. For example, if a child once went to a zoo and saw an elephant, but did not know the word elephant, an adult could later help the child recall this event, describing the size <b>and</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> the animal, how big its ears were, its trunk, and the sound it made, then using the word elephant to refer to the animal. Calling upon prior knowledge is used not only in conversation, but often in book reading as well to help explain what is happening in a story by relating it back to the child's own experiences.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} {{originally}} described from California as Armillaria olida by mycologists Harry D. Thiers and Walter Sundberg in 1976. The type specimen was collected on May 6, 1972, in the Crystal Basin Recreation Area in El Dorado County. Thiers and Sundberg classified {{it in the}} section Ponderosa of genus Armillaria due to its inamyloid spores, but noted that its relationship to other species was unclear. They also noted the similarity of the form <b>and</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> its cap to species in section Constricta of genus Lyophyllum.|$|E

25|$|During {{his studies}} in Tallinn, Tigran Maytesian met Igor Bezrodny, a {{distinguished}} violinist and pedagogue of the 20th century, who initiated {{him into the}} traditions of the Russian violin school of Abram Yampolsky (Bezrodny was a student of the latter). Since then Tigran has followed the best practices of the Russian violin school with its focus on technical skills, relaxed handplay, peculiar sense for the acoustic characteristics of the violin, the capabilities for creating sound, the richness <b>and</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> the created sound, and the artistic freedom and self-development of the violinist.|$|E

25|$|When thermal {{radiation}} strikes an object, part will be reflected, part transmitted, {{and the rest}} absorbed. The fraction that is absorbed depends on the nature <b>and</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> the material. A thin material may transmit a lot. A light colored object may reflect much of the incident radiation and thus escape damage, like anti-flash white paint. The absorbed {{thermal radiation}} raises {{the temperature of the}} surface and results in scorching, charring, and burning of wood, paper, fabrics, etc. If the material is a poor thermal conductor, the heat is confined {{to the surface of the}} material.|$|E
25|$|The {{functions}} of neural oscillations are wide-ranging and vary for {{different types of}} oscillatory activity. Examples are the generation of rhythmic activity such as a heartbeat and the neural binding of sensory features in perception, such as the shape <b>and</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> an object. Neural oscillations also {{play an important role}} in many neurological disorders, such as excessive synchronization during seizure activity in epilepsy or tremor in patients with Parkinson's disease. Oscillatory activity can also be used to control external devices in brain–computer interfaces, in which subjects can control an external device by changing the amplitude of particular brain rhythmics.|$|E
25|$|Kimonos {{range from}} {{extremely}} formal to casual. The level of formality of women's kimono is determined mostly by {{the pattern of}} the fabric, and color. Young women's kimonos have longer sleeves, signifying that they are not married, and tend to be more elaborate than similarly formal older women's kimono. Men's kimonos are usually one basic shape and are mainly worn in subdued colors. Formality is also determined by the type <b>and</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> accessories, the fabric, and the number or absence of kamon (family crests), with five crests signifying extreme formality. Silk is the most desirable, and most formal, fabric. Kimonos made of fabrics such as cotton and polyester generally reflect a more casual style.|$|E

25|$|While {{containers}} {{are usually}} {{made from a}} single type <b>and</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> plastic, making them relatively easy to sort, a consumer product like a cellular phone may have many small parts consisting of over a dozen different types and colors of plastics. In such cases, the resources {{it would take to}} separate the plastics far exceed their value and the item is discarded. However, developments are taking place in the field of active disassembly, which may result in more product components being reused or recycled. Recycling certain types of plastics can be unprofitable as well. For example, polystyrene is rarely recycled because the process is usually not cost effective. These unrecycled wastes are typically disposed of in landfills, incinerated or used to produce electricity at waste-to-energy plants.|$|E
25|$|Amulets are {{plentiful}} in the Jewish tradition, {{with examples of}} Solomon-era amulets existing in many museums. Due to the proscription of idols and other graven images in Judaism, Jewish amulets emphasize text and names. The shape, material, <b>and</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> a Jewish amulet makes no difference. Examples of textual amulets include the Silver Scroll, circa 630 BCE, and the still contemporary mezuzah and tefillin. A counter-example, however, is the Hand of Miriam, an outline of a human hand. Another non-textual amulet is the Seal of Solomon, {{also known as the}} hexagram or Star of David. In one form. it consists of two intertwined equilateral triangles, and in this form it is commonly worn suspended around the neck to this day.|$|E
25|$|New York {{photographer}} Alfred Stieglitz (1864–1946) befriended and championed {{several of}} the most visionary modern painters to emerge in early twentieth-century America. Five modern artists who were closely identified with Stieglitz’s circle are represented in the ACMAA collection. They are Charles Demuth (1883–1935), Arthur G. Dove (1880–1946), Marsden Hartley (1877–1943), John Marin (1870–1953), and Georgia O'Keeffe (1887–1986). The collection houses early works by Demuth, Dove, Hartley, and O’Keeffe, produced between 1908 and 1918, and a focused group of later paintings by Dove, Hartley, Marin, and O’Keeffe that capture their response to the light <b>and</b> <b>color</b> <b>of</b> the New Mexican landscape near Taos. Charles Demuth’s Chimney and Water Tower (1931), painted in the artist’s hometown of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, depicts a local linoleum factory as a grid of austere, monumental forms and passages of steel gray, blue, and deep red. Chimney and Water Tower entered the ACMAA collection in 1995.|$|E
