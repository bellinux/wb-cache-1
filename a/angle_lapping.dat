The second-order polynomial profile model proposed by Stewart et al. [3] is confirmed, and the dependence of the model characteristics on fabrication conditions is analyzed. Use of the resulting relationships is demonstrated by the compilation of a design table of expected waveguide mode structures for given fabrication conditions. Methods of exchangedion concentration profile determination are reviewed and a simple method based on sample <b>angle</b> <b>lapping</b> is proposed. Copyrigh...|$|E
40|$|Focused {{ion beam}} (FIB) {{micromachining}} {{has been carried}} out to angle-lap multilayer structures for layer thickness measurements. A Ga+ FIB originating from a liquid metal ion source (LMIS), operated at 10 kV, was employed throughout. The FIB was digitally rastered, pixel by pixel, in a serpentine fashion over the area of interest, and the pixel dwell time was incremented line by line. The multilayers used were Al/SiO 2 /Si and Al/TiW/SiO 2 /Si. For the conditions set up for the FIB scan routine, control in micromachining the angle of the lapped surface is of the order of 1 arcsec per scan of the ion beam over the area of interest.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{substrate}} orientation {{on the quality}} of silicon epitaxial ayers was studied in terms of deposition rate and surface topography. The layer was deposited by the hydrogen reduction of silicon tetrachloride. Deposition rate was determined from the time of deposition and from the layer thickness ob-tained by <b>angle</b> <b>lapping</b> and staining. Deposition rate was lowest on accurately oriented substrates and increased as the degree of misorientation from the direction increased. The frequently observed surface pyramid de-fect was found to be a function of (a) deposition rate and (b) substrate orientation. These pyramidal defects were not observed for low deposition rates, and when the substrate was misoriented from the direction. These observations are consistent with the proposal that the deposition rate used in practice is determined by two fundamental rate processes, namely, (a) reaction rate and (b) growth rate. During the development of epitaxial deposited sil...|$|E
40|$|A high donor {{concentration}} (> 10 is cm- 3) obviously {{enhances the}} thermal oxidation. The p-type SiC oxida-tion data are added in Table III for comparison. Electrolytic etching in a 2 : 1 mixture {{of alcohol and}} 40 % HF is mainly used for the delineation of p+p- and n+n- junct ions and for those p-n junctions where both sides are very lightly doped. The delineation which is accomplished partly by surface attack and partly by sLaining may be markedly enhanced by a subsequent oxidation. Thus, the combination of electrolytic etch-ing and oxidation {{has been found to}} be successful for the delineation of all junctions of practical interest. Furthermore, the existence of doping inhomogeneities can be revealed by this technique. Figure 3 shows an <b>angle</b> <b>lap</b> of an n-type pitaxial SiC layer on an n-type substrate. It is clearly seen that there are impurity striations in the substrate whereas the doping of the epitaxial layer is uniform. In conclusion, it can be stated that the thermal oxidation of silicon carbide is a useful tool for polytype discrimination. An unambiguous determination of the polytype (6 H or 15 R), however, is possible only in those cases where the dependence of the oxidation rate on the conductivity type and the doping level is neg-ligible or can be taken into account properly. The electrolytic etching technique serves for the delineation of impurity concentration gradients. A combination of both methods often provides an enhanced contrast.

40|$|When an extrinsic, direct {{band-gap}} semiconductor {{sample is}} irradiated by photons of an energy {{higher than the}} energy of the band gap between valence and conduction bands, excess electron-hole pairs are generated which, while diffusing through the sample, produce luminescence via radiative recombination. If, furthermore, the intensity of the impinging beam of photons is modulated sinusoidally, the luminescence radiation escaping from the sample will be phase shifted with respect to the original photon beam in a characteristic way. It will be shown that by measuring the phase shift at different modulation frequencies, the Shockley-Read-Hall lifetime of minority carriers may be ascertained. The method is nondestructive inasmuch as {{there is no need to}} fabricate p-n junctions or Ohmic contacts, nor is it necessary to remove already existing Ohmic contacts of <b>angle</b> <b>lap</b> the surface, etc., procedures often needed when determining lifetimes with the scanning electron microscope (in which case a p-n junction must be present) ...|$|R

40|$|Approximately 50 % {{of solar}} cells {{are based on}} {{multicrystalline}} silicon (mc-Si). A major limiting factor in their efficiency is recombination of electron-hole pairs at dislocations. Manufacturers of mc-Si wafers are focussing on reducing dislocation densities by modified casting techniques. However, an alternative approach is to remove the dislocations after growth and wafering. This thesis aims to explore the feasibility of using chemical processing to remove dislocations from mc-Si wafers. For measuring the depth to which dislocation cores are removed an <b>angle</b> <b>lapping</b> technique is First developed. This allows the pit diameters and depth of bulk material removed to be measured. The parameter "aspect ratio" {{is defined as the}} ratio of dislocation etch pit depth to diameter; a high aspect ratio is desirable. The results gained allow the dislocation core removal process to be studied and optimised. The first etching system explored is the Secco etch (1 K₂Cr₂O₇ (0. 15 M) : 2 HF (49 %)), a commonly used defect-revealing etch. Samples are immersed in Secco etch for various durations at a range of temperatures, and pits are formed at the locations of dislocations and grain and twin boundaries. Secco etch is found to remove dislocations to depths of up to 40 m. The activation energies for dislocation etching, etch pit widening and bulk etching are calculated as 0. 20, 0. 23 and 0. 30 eV respectively. Scanning electron microscopy is used to determine the geometry of the etch pits. Their structure is shown to be somewhat tubular, but the diameter of the pits is relatively large; too much bulk material is being removed. Further, at all temperatures the aspect ratio decreases with an increase in etch duration, so the aim of long, narrow etch tubes {{does not appear to be}} feasible using Secco etch. Finding an alternative etching system with a lower bulk etch rate is the next aim. Anodic etching, where the silicon sample is biased whilst immersed in a solution, is therefore investigated, as control of the etch strength is provided by varying the electrical parameters. The overall etch rates for both dislocation etching and bulk etching are approximately two orders of magnitude lower; etch durations of over a day are needed to produce pits comparable to 20 minutes Secco etching. This, however, does not lead to improvements in aspect ratio, and the etching behaviour is hard to control. Anodic etching appears to be much more sensitive to small, local changes in condition, evidenced by varying results across different regions of a single sample. Slower acting chemical etches are the final system that is investigated, and are chosen based on the strength of the oxidising agent present. The aim here is that the alternative etch solutions provide a very low bulk etch rate and are used at very long etch durations to produce long etch tubes with very high aspect ratio. An iodine-based etch (1 I₂ (0. 01 M) : 2 HF (49 %)) is the only candidate found to produce good defect delineation, but the dislocation etch rate is very low and again the aspect ratio is unsuitable for removing dislocations deep into wafers.

In this study, the tensile behavior of nonwoven structures including needlepunched and thermal bonded has been predicted by modifying the micromechanical model based upon the geometrical and mechanical properties of the constituent fibers (Adanur, S. and Liao, T. (1999). Fiber Arrangements Characteristics and Their Effects on Nonwoven Tensile Behavior, Textile Research Journal, 69 (11) : 816 – 824). In the modified model, the effects of fiber orientation in addition to the fiber curl factor are incorporated. The theoretical models have been validated with experimental results. The effects of <b>lapping</b> <b>angle</b> and curl factor have also been investigated on the thermal bonded nonwoven structures. Furthermore, the distribution of fiber orientation within a nonwoven structure is related to the lapping and fiber orientation angles using Fourier series...|$|R

The {{effect of}} {{recessing}} on the stresses distributed along the mid-bondline in both standard single lap joints and co-axial ones {{were analyzed using}} elasto-plastic finite element method (FEM). The results obtained show that {{the values of the}} peak stresses of all the stresses distributed in the mid-bondline were changed greatly as the preformed <b>angle</b> in over <b>lap</b> zone was about 10 0 when the high elastic modulus adhesive is used. The effect of the elastic modulus level on the stress distribution (especially the peak stresses) is small in the middle part of the lap zone. When taken the stress distributed in the middle part of the lap zone into account, there is nearly {{no significant difference between the}} peel stress distributed in the standard joint and co-axial single lap joint when the adhesives with lower elastic modulus was used. It is recommended that a co-axial joint is suitable for the recessing joint made by aluminum alloy and a higher elastic modulus adhesive...|$|R

An investigation {{on the effect of}} dynamic behavior of ball support system on the performance of ball lapping in rotated dual-plates lapping method is carried out. Sinusoidal waveform in terms of Fourier analysis is employed to express the shape error of the ball surface, and a dynamic model for support is setup. It is found with numerical calculation that the variation of lapping load lags behind the variation of the shape error for the damping of support. A lower natural frequency of the support system, higher spin speed of balls and a larger value of spin <b>angle</b> in RDP <b>lapping</b> are better to rectify the shape error of balls and reduce the lagged effect. It is concluded that dynamics of lapping system must be taken into consideration in order to understand comprehensively the spherical surface generation mechanism...|$|R

Grinding is conducted using the diamond wheels with grain size degradation, and then polishing is performed with very fine diamond of average grain size of nano-meter. It is found that the grain size degradation grinding method has very effective performance of finishing of the silicon nitride ball.

They suggest if {{it was possible to}} create a device capable to log data from a motorbike during a race or testing seasons, mentioning some other similar systems out on the market, but is really expensive. Taking an initial idea, we thought about one way to design a system capable of satisfy the demand of our contractor, trying to reduce costs on the design. At this point we accept the project offered by TriCAT racing team. Known the several issues that they have about the design and studying the different ways to make it, the design is starting to be thought. The contractor needs that the system has to be capable of store the data into a SD card, this data are: position, velocity, RPM, cornering <b>angle</b> and <b>lap</b> time of a motorbike in a circuit race. For solve this issues we thought about microprocessors, GPS’s, and other kind of possibilities, arriving to one possible solution. Now the solution of design question is solved, it is possible to design a system capable to accomplish the demands of the contractor, with a microcontroller PIC 18 F 4550 and a GPS Unit, one Accelerometer, and programming a complex program on C for microcontrollers it is possible arrive to a solution. When we start to build the first prototype and we decide to test it a problem appears, not enough space in ROM memory. During the implementation part, we arrived the conclusion that we made an error choosing the microprocessor PIC 18 F 4550, this error is because the ROM memory.
