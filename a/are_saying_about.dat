500|$|Kim Novak, {{who worked}} on Hitchcock's 1957 Vertigo, disputed Hedren's (and the film's) view of the director. Novak told The Daily Telegraph, [...] "I feel bad about all the stuff people <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>about</b> him now, {{that he was a}} weird character. I did not find him to be weird at all. I never saw him make a pass at anybody or act strange to anybody." [...] Louise Latham, who played Hedren's mother in Marnie, {{dismissed}} claims of Hitchcock's predatory nature in Broadcast magazine: [...] "I find some of the allegations hard to believe...I wasn't aware of her being hassled on the set." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That's better!" [...] he {{said with}} a hoarse laugh. [...] "But man, what is it you <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>about</b> having run out of the wind? Look at the glass!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "What is {{that you}} <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>about</b> Piero de' Medici and small wits, Messer Niccolo?" [...] said Nello, whose light figure {{was at that moment}} predominating over the Herculean frame of Niccolo Caparra.|$|E
6000|$|... “I’m {{just going}} down to the town,” {{announced}} Mr. James Gurtleberry, with an air of some importance: “I want to hear what people <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>about</b> Albania. Affairs there are beginning to take on a very serious look. It’s my opinion that we haven’t seen the worst of things yet.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Fred," [...] said Isa, with a {{good deal}} of {{decision}} in her tone, [...] "I'm not at all satisfied with your explanation. These mysterious and long visits you make to London ought to be accounted for, and as I have agreed to become your wife within the next three or four months, just to please you, the least you can do, I think, is to have no secrets from me. Besides, {{you have no idea what}} the people here and your former shipmates <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>about</b> you." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "None {{of these}} things they <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>about</b> the war," [...] she said, [...] "really matter in the {{slightest}} degree. It is all about a spoilt carpet and nothing else in the world--a madman and a spoilt carpet. If people had paid the slightest attention to common sense none of this war would have happened. The thing was perfectly well known. He was a delicate child, difficult to rear and given to screaming fits. Consequently he was never crossed, allowed to do everything. Nobody but his grandmother had the slightest influence with him. And she prevented him spoiling this carpet as completely as he wished to do. The story is perfectly well known. It was at Windsor--at the age of eight. After that he had but one thought: war with England....|$|E
6000|$|But now, if this rumour were true, {{there had}} been {{positive}} dishonesty. From whichever source the man might have got the money first, if the money had been twice got, the second payment had been fraudulently obtained. Surely if the accusation had been untrue Lopez would have come to him and declared it to be false, knowing what must otherwise be his thoughts. Lately, in the daily worry of his life, he had avoided all conversation with the man. He would not allow his mind to contemplate clearly what was coming. He entertained some irrational, undefined hope that something would at last save his daughter from the threatened banishment. It might be, if he held his own hand tight enough, that {{there would not be}} money enough even to pay for her passage out. As for her outfit, Lopez would of course order what he wanted and have the bills sent to Manchester Square. Whether or not this was being done neither he nor Emily knew. And thus matters went on without much speech between the two men. But now the old barrister thought that he was bound to speak. He therefore waited on a certain morning till Lopez had come down, having previously desired his daughter to leave the room. [...] "Lopez," [...] he asked, [...] "what is this that the newspapers <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>about</b> your expenses at Silverbridge?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I can’t imagine it,” she admitted. “Of course,” she continued, “there are {{heaps of}} ways of leading a real {{existence}} without committing sensational deeds of violence. It’s the dreadful little everyday acts of pretended importance that give the Mappin stamp to our life. It would be entertaining, if it wasn’t so pathetically tragic, to hear Uncle James fuss in here {{in the morning and}} announce, ‘I must just go down into the town and find out what the men there <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>about</b> Mexico. Matters are beginning to look serious there.’ Then he patters away into the town, and talks in a highly serious voice to the tobacconist, incidentally buying an ounce of tobacco; perhaps he meets one or two others of the world’s thinkers and talks to them in a highly serious voice, then he patters back here and announces with increased importance, ‘I’ve just been talking to some men in the town about the condition of affairs in Mexico. They agree with the view that I have formed, that things there will have to get worse before they get better.’ Of course nobody in the town cared in the least little bit what his views about Mexico were or whether he had any. The tobacconist wasn’t even fluttered at his buying the ounce of tobacco; he knows that he purchases the same quantity of the same sort of tobacco every week. Uncle James might just as well have lain on his back in the garden and chattered to the lilac tree about the habits of caterpillars.” ...|$|E

6000|$|In a {{few minutes}} Peter thrust a sleepy-looking face out from the Old Briar-patch and grinned rather sheepishly. [...] "What was that you <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> <b>about</b> Reddy Fox?" [...] he asked again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen, Midgetina," [...] {{her voice}} broke out coldly. [...] "I can guess easily enough what's saving {{up for me}} when I come home--which won't be yet a while, I can assure you. I can guess, too, what your friends, Lady Pollacke and Co., <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>about</b> me. Let them rave. That can't be helped. I shall bear it, and try to grin. Maybe there would be worse still, if worse were known. But your worse I won't have, not even from you. I was not his keeper. I did not play him false. I deny it. Could I prevent him--caring for me? Was he man enough to come openly? Did he say to his mother, 'Take her or leave her, I mean to have her'--as I would have done? No, he blew hot and cold. He temporized; he--he was a coward. Oh, this {{everlasting}} dog-fight between body and mind! Ages before you ever crept upon the scene he pestered and pestered me--until I have almost retched {{at the sound of}} church bells. What was it, I ask you, but sheer dread of what the man might go and do that kept me shilly-shallying? And what's more, Miss Wren, who told me to throw the stone? Pff, it sickens me, this paltering world. I can't and won't see things but with my reason. My reason, I tell you. What else is a schoolma'am for? Did he want me for my sake? Who begged and begged that his beautiful love should be kept secret? There was once a philosopher called Plato, my dear. He poisoned Man's soul." ...|$|E
6000|$|His {{name was}} {{once more in}} many mouths. [...] "Come back and be made of more than ever!" [...] cried that society which he had once enlivened. [...] "Come and hear the pretty things we <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>about</b> you. Come and make the prettier replies that {{are already on the}} tip of your tongue; for oh, Tommy, you know they are! Bring her with you if you must; but don't you think that the nice, quiet country with the thingumbobs all in bloom would suit her best? It is {{essential}} that you should run up to see your publisher, is it not? The men have dinners for you if you want them, but we know you don't. Your yearning eyes are on the ladies, Tommy; we are making up theatre-parties of the old entrancing kind; you should see our new gowns; please come back and help us to put on our cloaks, Tommy; there is a dance on Monday--come and sit it out with us. Do you remember the garden-party where you said--Well, the laurel walk is still there; the beauties of two years ago are still here, and there are new beauties, and their noses are slightly tilted, but no man can move them; ha, do you pull yourself together at that? We were always the reward for your labours, Tommy; your books are move one in the game of making love to us; don't be afraid that we shall forget it is a game; we know it is, and that is why we suit you. Come and play in London as you used to play in the Den. It is all you need of women; come and have your fill, and we shall send you back refreshed. We are not asking you to be disloyal to her, only to leave her happy and contented and take a holiday." ...|$|E
6000|$|And for the rest, {{there is}} {{undoubtedly}} an enormous mass of sensible, rather thoughtless people, whose rooted sentiment {{it is that}} any deep change in our society must be in some way infinitely distant. They cannot believe that men in hats and coats like themselves can be preparing a revolution; all their Victorian philosophy has taught them that such transformations are always slow. Therefore, when I speak of Eugenic legislation, or {{the coming of the}} Eugenic State, they think of it as something like The Time Machine or Looking Backward: a thing that, good or bad, will have to fit itself to their great-great-great-grandchild, who may be very different and may like it; and who in any case is rather a distant relative. To all this I have, to begin with, a very short and simple answer. The Eugenic State has begun. The first of the Eugenic Laws has already been adopted by the Government of this country; and passed with the applause of both parties through the dominant House of Parliament. This first Eugenic Law clears the ground and may be said to proclaim negative Eugenics; but it cannot be defended, and nobody has attempted to defend it, except on the Eugenic theory. I will call it the Feeble-Minded Bill both for brevity and because the description is strictly accurate. It is, quite simply and literally, a Bill for incarcerating as madmen those whom no doctor will consent to call mad. It is enough if some doctor or other may happen to call them weak-minded. Since there is scarcely any human being to whom this term has not been conversationally applied by his own friends and relatives on some occasion or other (unless his friends and relatives have been lamentably lacking in spirit), it can be clearly seen that this law, like the early Christian Church (to which, however, it presents points of dissimilarity), is a net drawing in of all kinds. It must not be supposed that we have a stricter definition incorporated in the Bill. Indeed, the first definition of [...] "feeble-minded" [...] in the Bill was much looser and vaguer than the phrase [...] "feeble-minded" [...] itself. It is a piece of yawning idiocy about [...] "persons who though capable of earning their living under favourable circumstances" [...] (as if anyone could earn his living if circumstances were directly unfavourable to his doing so), are nevertheless [...] "incapable of managing their affairs with proper prudence"; which is exactly what all the world and his wife <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>about</b> their neighbours all over this planet. But as an incapacity for any kind of thought is now regarded as statesmanship, there is nothing so very novel about such slovenly drafting. What is novel and what is vital is this: that the defence of this crazy Coercion Act is a Eugenic defence. It is not only openly said, it is eagerly urged, that the aim of the measure is to prevent any person whom these propagandists do not happen to think intelligent from having any wife or children. Every tramp who is sulky, every labourer who is shy, every rustic who is eccentric, can quite easily be brought under such conditions as were designed for homicidal maniacs. That is the situation; and that is the point. England has forgotten the Feudal State; it is in the last anarchy of the Industrial State; there is much in Mr. Belloc's theory that it is approaching the Servile State; it cannot at present get at the Distributive State; it has almost certainly missed the Socialist State. But we are already under the Eugenist State; and nothing remains to us but rebellion.|$|E
