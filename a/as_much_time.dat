5|$|Dirks and Ueda {{married in}} 2007. She {{initially}} also worked at D. E. Shaw Research, but stopped in 2010 {{to raise the}} first of two children. The couple settled in the Westchester County suburb of Chappaqua, New York. He rose early to commute to his job via Metro-North Railroad's Harlem Line, and returned late but devoted <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> as possible on evenings and weekends to his children.|$|E
5|$|During summer {{holidays}} {{with his family}} in Dublin he met {{and fell in love with}} Cherrie Matheson, a friend of one of his cousins and a member of the Plymouth Brethren. He proposed to her in 1895 and again the next year, but she turned him down on both occasions because of their differing views on religion. This rejection affected Synge greatly and reinforced his determination to spend <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> as possible outside Ireland.|$|E

Gravel, as with some of the other second-tier candidates, did not get <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> as the leaders; during the June 2, 2007, New Hampshire debate, which lasted two hours, he was asked 10 questions and allowed to speak for five minutes and 37 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Prinz zur Lippe-Weißenfeld {{never married}} or had children. In January 1941 he became acquainted with Hannelore Ide, nicknamed Idelein. She was a {{secretary}} for a Luftgau. The two shared {{a close relationship}} and spent <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> together as the war permitted, listening to music and sailing on the IJsselmeer {{until his death in}} 1944.|$|E
5|$|There is {{difficulty}} in labeling the trobairitz as either amateurs or professionals. The distinction {{between these two}} roles was complicated in the medieval era, since professionals were generally lower class, and amateurs had <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> as professionals to devote to their craft. Joglaresse were lower class, professional composers far less respected than the trobairitz.|$|E
50|$|In 1980 {{the brand}} was renamed Energizer. Modern {{alkaline}} batteries, due to technological improvements, can last <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> 40 <b>times</b> {{longer than the}} original prototype.|$|R
50|$|The {{metabolism}} of bupropion {{is highly}} variable: the effective doses of bupropion received by persons who ingest {{the same amount}} of the drug may differ by <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> 5.5 <b>times</b> (with a half-life of 12-30 hours), while the effective doses of hydroxybupropion may differ by <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> 7.5 <b>times</b> (with a half-life of 15-25 hours). Based on this, some researchers have advocated monitoring of the blood level of bupropion and hydroxybupropion. The half-lives of erythrohydrobupropion and threohydrobupropion are roughly 23-43 hours and 24-50 hours respectively.|$|R

5|$|After his {{marriage}} to Yanti, she ended her singing career to become a housewife. When the couple had children, Chrisye often had little {{time to spend with}} them as he was busy performing or recording; however, he attempted to spend <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> with them as possible. In a 1992 interview, he said that his children did not want to follow in their parents' footsteps and become singers because they had seen the stresses it put on the family.|$|E
5|$|Because {{bulk cargo}} is so {{difficult}} to discharge, bulkers {{spend more time in}} port than other ships. A study of mini-bulkers found that it takes, on average, twice <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> to unload a ship as it does to load it. A mini-bulker spends 55hours at a time in port, compared to 35hours for a lumber carrier of similar size. This time in port increases to 74hours for Handymax and 120hours for Panamax vessels. Compared with the 12-hour turnarounds common for container ships, 15-hour turnarounds for car carriers, and 26-hour turnarounds for large tankers, bulker crews have more opportunities to spend time ashore.|$|E
5|$|By the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War, he had gained a reputation among the others in the squadron as an experienced pilot and a capable section leader. He was well-liked among other pilots and the black stewards and support staff of the carrier. Brown did not socialize much with the other pilots, however, and was known to spend <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> as possible visiting his wife. He was able to reveal his marriage following his commissioning.|$|E

5|$|Compared {{with the}} rival MiG-29K, the Su-33's maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) is 50% higher; fuel {{capacity}} {{is more than}} double, allowing it to fly 80% further at altitude (or 33% at sea level). The MiG-29K can spend <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> as the Su-33 on station by using external fuel tanks, but this limits its ordnance capacity. The Su-33 can fly at speeds as low as 240km/h (149mph), in comparison the MiG-29K needs to maintain a minimum of 250km/h (155mph) for effective control. However, the MiG-29K carries more air-to-ground munitions than the Su-33. The Su-33 is more expensive and physically larger than the MiG-29K, limiting the numbers able to be deployed on an aircraft carrier.|$|E
5|$|Not {{only did}} Gibbons work {{to repair the}} damage to the company offices, he made it a {{priority}} to allow its staff to deal with their personal situations. He made staff members job descriptions more flexible, encouraging staff members to take the initiative to perform a wide range of tasks. A corporate day care system was established, allowing staff to bring their children to work. Staff members were allowed to take off <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> as needed to reestablish themselves and corporate dress codes were relaxed. The company brought in counselors, insurance experts, tax consultants, child care advisers and construction companies to help the staff reorient themselves. The company also {{went so far as to}} arrange emergency loans for its employees.|$|E
5|$|On 4 July 2009, Mills {{opened a}} vegan {{restaurant}} called VBites at Hove Lagoon, Hove, Sussex. Mills {{is quoted as}} saying that she intends it to be the first in a worldwide chain of vegan restaurants. Whilst promoting the restaurant, Mills gave an interview to the BBC, stating that she'd been very proactive in the building stages and now that it was open, would give <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> to it as she could – working it around her charity work. In May 2013 she sold the restaurant premises to local record producer Fatboy Slim and opened a new, enlarged VBites in East Street in Brighton.|$|E

5|$|Rather {{than trying}} to release the game {{in tandem with the}} movie, Rare founders Tim and Chris Stamper made sure to give the {{developers}} <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> as they needed to finish the game. GoldenEye 007 was developed through two and a half years, the first year of which was spent developing the engine and producing art assets. The game was released on a 96Mb cartridge on 25 August 1997, nearly two years after the film. Additionally, every cartridge of the game contains a fully functional ZX Spectrum emulator with ten Rare developed games. This function was originally made as an experimental side project by Rare staff and was deactivated in the final build of the game, but has since been unlocked through fan-made patches.|$|E
5|$|With only 4:25 {{remaining}} and a lead well in hand, Stanford {{began running}} down the clock by executing running plays, which keep the game clock running {{as long as the}} ball carrier is downed in the field of play. Three rushes gained Stanford 16yards, but the effectiveness of this strategy was undermined by a 15-yard personal foul penalty against Stanford that prevented the Cardinal from gaining a first down. Stanford also accepted a delay of game penalty in order to squeeze <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> as possible from the clock before punting back to Virginia Tech. The final drive of the game began from the Tech 11-yard line with 2:10 remaining, and quarterback Taylor controlled the ball on all of its five plays. Taylor completed a five-yard pass to Coale, then ran for 18yards and a first down. He was then sacked for a 15-yard loss, but gained much of that back with an 11-yard run. On the game's final play, Taylor completed a 17-yard first-down pass to Wilson, who was tackled as the last second ticked off the clock and Stanford clinched a 40–12 victory.|$|E
5|$|Nearly {{six months}} after filming began, Yuvan Shankar Raja left the project, {{because he could not}} spend <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> on this film as Selvaraghavan wanted. Subsequently, the role of the music {{director}} was handed to G. V. Prakash Kumar, for whom Aayirathil Oruvan became his biggest project to that point. Rambo Rajkumar, the film's stunt director, died in April 2009 and was posthumously praised for his action choreography. The film's music released two months later to much appraisal in a well-held audio release function. Soon after the filming finished, the lead actors moved onto other projects as did Selvaraghavan whilst post-production continued. In August 2009, Selvaraghavan divorced his wife, Sonia Agarwal with his close proximity to Andrea being a speculated cause. During the period, G. V. Prakash Kumar and Selva also worked on the music in Mumbai whilst re-recording was also held in Austria and London. Towards the end of the year, the film began to announce release date of Christmas which was later further delayed to coincide with the Pongal festival. A date clash occurred with Karthi's Paiyaa, with an eventual hearing leading to the Karthi's latter film being delayed. Throughout December 2009, release work began with a trailer and promotional songs being released on 13 December. The film was subsequently certified {{before the end of the}} year by the Central Board of Film Certification and settled with an adult rating, after Selvaraghavan refused to remove some gory scenes. On 31 December, it was announced that the film was sold worldwide for 350million rupees for theatrical, television and other rights.|$|E

5|$|Norman {{was born}} in Ulverston, Lancashire (now part of the {{administrative}} county of Cumbria), on 6 September 1883 to Thomas Birkett, a draper, and his wife Agnes, who died in 1884 of tuberculosis. He attended the Wesleyan primary school in Ulverston until 1894, {{when he moved to}} Barrow-in-Furness Grammar School. Although intelligent, Birkett was not noted as a particularly academic student and spent <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>time</b> on practical jokes as he did on his studies. He left school in 1898, starting work as an apprentice in one of the draper's shops owned by his father and beginning to preach. He was a popular local preacher on the local Methodist circuit, and, on deciding that he was unlikely to be a good draper, his father allowed him to leave the business in 1904 to become a minister under Charles Bedale. In 1905, Bedale suggested Birkett should go to Cambridge University to study history and theology. Birkett liked the idea, having previously conversed with A. C. Benson, the Master of Magdalene College, and applied to Emmanuel College, Cambridge. The college offered him a place, with the condition {{that he would have to}} pass an entrance examination and complete the responsions to be accepted into the university as a whole. He spent three months learning Latin and Greek and was accepted into the university in October 1907.|$|E
