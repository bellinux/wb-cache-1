5|$|During {{the first}} phase of the attack by {{infantry}} in the 75th Division (XXI Corps) were to capture the line Tel el Turmus–Qastina–Yazur and then seize Mesmiye. On their left infantry in the 52nd (Lowland) Division were to secure the line Yazur–Beshshit and then seize Qatra. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>pause</b> for the artillery to be brought forward, the second phase attacks on the final objectives of Junction Station for the 75th and al-Mansura for the 52nd (Lowland) Divisions were to be made. The first phase was due to start at 08:00 hours on 13 November preceded by one hour's bombardment.|$|E
5|$|In mid-February, Wellington's army {{broke out}} of its small area of conquered {{territory}} near Bayonne. Moving east, the Allies drove the French back from several river lines. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>pause</b> in the campaign, the western-most Allied corps surrounded and isolated Bayonne. Resuming their eastward drive, the remaining two Allied corps pushed Soult's army back to Orthez where the French marshal offered battle. In subsequent operations, Soult decided to abandon the large western port of Bordeaux and fall back east toward Toulouse. The next action was the Battle of Toulouse.|$|E
5|$|The program's {{producers}} and Brockman met {{to review the}} videotape. They noticed that Larson would immediately celebrate after many of his spins instead of waiting the {{fraction of a second}} it would take for a contestant to see and respond to the space he or she had stopped on, effectively showing he {{knew he was going to}} get something good. It was also noticed that Larson had an unusual reaction to his early prize of a Kauai trip, which was out of his pattern – he initially looked puzzled and upset, but then recovered and celebrated <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>pause.</b>|$|E

5|$|Sandgate was {{intended}} to defend a vulnerable point along the Kent cliffs, just west of Folkestone, where an enemy force could potentially land and make their way easily further inland. Sandgate's construction was supervised by the Moravian engineer Stefan von Haschenperg, and Thomas Cockys and Richard Keys acted as commissioners for the project. In {{the initial stages of}} the work in 1539, a team of 237 men were employed, with masons, quarrymen, limeburners and wood fellers preparing the site; the masons were drawn {{from as far away as}} Somerset and Gloucestershire. By the summer, over 500 were at work, including labourers, bricklayers, carpenters and sawyers. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>pause</b> during the winter months, work picked up again in the summer of the next year, with 630 working on the castle that July.|$|E
5|$|Cosell:... but (the game)'s {{suddenly}} {{been placed}} in total perspective for us; I'll finish this, they're in the hurry-up offense.Gifford: Third down, four. (Chuck) Foreman... it'll be fourth down. (Matt) Cavanaugh will let it run down for one final attempt, he'll let the seconds tick off to give Miami no opportunity whatsoever. (Whistle blows.) Timeout is called with three seconds remaining, John Smith is on the line. And I don't care what's on the line, Howard, {{you have got to}} say what we know in the booth.Cosell: Yes, we have to say it. Remember this is just a football game, no matter who wins or loses. An unspeakable tragedy confirmed to us by ABC News in New York City: John Lennon, outside of his apartment building on the West Side of New York City, the most famous perhaps, of all of the Beatles, shot twice in the back, rushed to Roosevelt Hospital, dead on arrival. Hard {{to go back to the}} game after that newsflash, which, in duty bound, we have to take. Frank?Gifford: (<b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>pause)</b> Indeed, it is.|$|E
5|$|Drumming {{is a form}} of non-vocal {{communication}} used by {{most species}} of woodpecker and involves the bill being repeatedly struck on a hard surface with great rapidity. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>pause,</b> the drum roll is repeated, each species having a pattern which is unique in the number of beats in the roll, the length of the roll, the length of the gap between rolls and the cadence. The drumming is mainly a territorial call, equivalent to the song of a passerine, with male birds drumming more frequently than females. Woodpeckers choose a surface that resonates, such as a hollow tree, and may use man-made structures such as gutters and downpipes. Drumming serves for the mutual recognition of conspecifics and plays a part in courtship rituals. Individual birds are thought to be able to distinguish the drumming of their mates and that of their neighbours.|$|E

25|$|The Turkish {{counter-attack}} on Jerusalem {{began on}} 27 December. When 180th Brigade relieved the defenders who had beaten off the initial Turkish attacks, it {{went over to}} the offensive, with 2/19th capturing the slopes of Shab Saleh. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>pause,</b> Allenby resumed his advance and the 2/19th took part in the capture of Jericho on 19–21 February 1918, storming Talat ed Dumm.|$|E
25|$|Nansouty's division, less Antoine Louis Decrest de Saint-Germain's brigade, began {{pressing}} back Karl von Vincent's {{rear guard}} early on 21 April 1809. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>pause</b> at mid-day, the French horsemen finally advanced and routed Vincent's cavalry which fled across the bridges of Landshut. The cuirassiers' {{role in the}} Battle of Landshut ended with the cavalrymen charging {{through the streets of}} the west bank suburb. Soon, infantry came up to occupy the town and later to successfully rush the bridges.|$|E

25|$|<b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>pause</b> for {{evaluation}} of procedures, the Army continued its use of reactors, operating the Mobile Low-Power Reactor (ML-1), which started full power operation on February 28, 1963, becoming the smallest nuclear power plant on record to do so. This design was eventually abandoned after corrosion problems. While the tests had shown that nuclear power was likely to have lower total costs, the financial pressures of the Vietnam War caused the Army to favor lower initial costs and it stopped the development of its reactor program in 1965, although the existing reactors continued operating (MH-1A until 1977).|$|E
25|$|<b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>pause</b> {{of several}} weeks caused by bad {{weather and the}} need to repair his lines of communication, Allenby {{advanced}} eastward to capture Jericho in February 1918. However, in March, the Germans launched their Spring Offensive on the Western Front, intending to defeat the Allied armies in France and Belgium. Allenby was ordered to send reinforcements (two complete divisions, another 24 infantry battalions from other divisions and nine dismounted yeomanry regiments) to the Western Front. Allenby's tank force was also returned to France. In total approximately 60,000 officers and men were transferred to the Western Front in 1918.|$|E
25|$|In the centre, the 169th Brigade {{advanced}} {{quickly at}} the start but veered {{to the right to}} go round boggy ground, then entered Glencorse Wood. The defenders were overrun after a mutually costly engagement, the intermediate objective at a line of pillboxes in the sunken road inside the wood was captured. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>pause,</b> the support battalions leapfrogged the leading battalions and pressed on against greater opposition and delays caused by machine-guns sited in old artillery positions and boggy ground. The troops lost the barrage but a few parties reached the final objective, the Wilhelmstellung pillboxes in Polygon Wood and northwards along Anzac Farm spur to the vicinity of Iron Cross Redoubt.|$|E

25|$|As the Franco-Italian army {{fell back}} to the Piave River, it met Jean Maximilien Lamarque's {{infantry}} division and Charles Joseph Randon de Malboissière de Pully's dragoon division moving forward. Eugène used these fresh units to cover his retreat. After holding {{the line of the}} Piave for four days, he began a withdrawal to the Adige on 21 April. At this time the army was joined by Teodoro Lechi's Royal Italian Guard. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>pause</b> on the Brenta on the 24th, the retreat was resumed. Anxious for his northern flank, Eugène authorized Baraguey d'Hilliers to fall back to Rovereto. Chasteler followed this up, taking Trento on 23 April and appearing before Rovereto on the 26th.|$|E
25|$|After {{participating}} in the Tullahoma campaign's maneuvers, the Regular Brigade had spent its time drilling and then repairing roads and guarding railroad lines. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>pause</b> to regroup, Rosecrans moved his army again on August 16, 1863 across the Cumberland Plateau to the Tennessee River and Sequatchie River banks. In early September 1863, the Army of the Cumberland began to advance on Chattanooga. With Thomas's and McCook's corps threatening his supply lines, Bragg evacuated Chattanooga on September 8, 1863. On September 10, 1863, the Regular Brigade crossed the Tennessee River at Bridgeport, Alabama with General King in command. Captain Albert B. Dod had joined the 15th U.S. Infantry and, since he outranked Captain Keteltas, assumed command of the 1st Battalion while Keteltas resumed command of Company E.|$|E
25|$|After the Austrian Empire's {{declaration}} of war on 12 August 1813, Eugène moved his army east to defend Illyria. At the end of September, the Franco-Italian army abandoned Illyria and fell back to the Soča (Isonzo) River. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>pause,</b> the Franco-Italian army retreated again, this time to the Adige River, which was reached {{at the end of}} October. In early November, Eugène reorganized the army and Marcognet emerged as commander of the 4th Division in Paul Grenier's corps. The 1st Brigade, which was commanded by Jean-Baptiste Jeanin, comprised the 29th and 31st Provisional Demi-Brigades. The 2nd Brigade under Vincent Martel Deconchy included the 36th Light, 102nd Line, and 106th Line Infantry Regiments. The 29th Provisional was formed from one battalion each of the 20th and 101st Line; the 31st Provisional was composed of single battalions of the 131st and 132nd Line.|$|E

25|$|The 4th Army {{had held}} on to the Gheluvelt Plateau in August but its {{casualties}} worsened the German manpower shortage. Haig transferred the main offensive effort to the Second Army on 25 August and moved the northern boundary of the Second Army closer to the Ypres–Roulers railway. More heavy artillery was sent to Flanders from the armies further south and placed opposite the Gheluvelt Plateau. Plumer continued the tactical development of the Fifth Army, during its slow and costly progress in August. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>pause</b> of about three weeks, Plumer intended to capture the plateau in four steps, at six-day intervals to bring forward artillery and supplies. The Second Army attacks were to remain limited and infantry brigades re-organised to attack the first objective with a battalion each and the final one with two battalions, the opposite of the Fifth Army practice.|$|E
25|$|<b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>pause</b> in the fighting, Chamberlain's {{division}} commander, Brigadier General (Brevet Major General) Charles Griffin {{came forward}} and told Chamberlain that the Confederate position must be taken. Deploying men to {{both sides of the}} Quaker Road, Chamberlain, on horseback, led a charge up the Quaker Road toward the Confederate strong point, a large sawdust pile that provided cover for many Confederate soldiers. Chamberlain got ahead of his men and became an obvious target. He was wounded in the arm and his horse was wounded in the neck. Chamberlain slumped on his horse, initially unconscious, but regained consciousness in time to respond to General Griffin who had come up to check on Chamberlain's condition. Then Chamberlain rallied his Pennsylvania regiment who were retreating from a Confederate charge. When his wounded horse could not continue, Chamberlain went to the front of his line on foot. Several Confederate soldiers soon appeared and demanded Chamberlain's surrender. Chamberlain had lost his hat and was wearing a faded coat, almost gray in color. Pretending to be a Confederate officer, he led the Confederates back toward Union soldiers who promptly captured them.|$|E

Having apparently relieved himself, the singer explained to his new fiancee that his love for her was genuine and she had to believe him. In 2010, Presley acknowledged to Oprah Winfrey that Jackson did formally propose one day in the library, taking out a 10 carat diamond ring and getting down on his knees.|$|E
