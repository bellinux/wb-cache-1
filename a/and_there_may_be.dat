5|$|Betelgeuse is {{classified}} as a semiregular variable star, indicating that some periodicity is noticeable in the brightness changes, but amplitudes may vary, cycles may have different lengths, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> standstills or periods of irregularity. It is placed in subgroup SRc; these are pulsating red supergiants with amplitudes around one magnitude and periods from tens to hundreds of days.|$|E
5|$|Commercial {{sex workers}} (including those in pornography) have an {{increased}} rate of HIV. Rough sex can be a factor {{associated with an increased}} risk of transmission. Sexual assault is also believed to carry an increased risk of HIV transmission as condoms are rarely worn, physical trauma to the vagina or rectum is likely, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> a greater risk of concurrent sexually transmitted infections.|$|E
5|$|Crystals {{are often}} {{idealized}} as being perfectly periodic. In that ideal case, the atoms are positioned on a perfect lattice, the electron density is perfectly periodic, and the Fourier transform F(q) is zero except when q {{belongs to the}} reciprocal lattice (the so-called Bragg peaks). In reality, however, crystals are not perfectly periodic; atoms vibrate about their mean position, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> disorder of various types, such as mosaicity, dislocations, various point defects, and heterogeneity in the conformation of crystallized molecules. Therefore, the Bragg peaks have a finite width <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> significant diffuse scattering, a continuum of scattered X-rays that fall between the Bragg peaks.|$|E

5000|$|According to [...] "Explaining Gender Differences in Hookup Regret", {{there are}} at least four {{explanations}} for why women may regret hookups more than men: (1) They may have different attitudes towards relationships, hooking up, <b>and</b> sex, (2) <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> differences in sexual initiation and agency within hookups, (3) <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> differences in the frequency of orgasm within hookups, <b>and</b> (4) <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> differences in perceived inequality in orgasms during hookups.|$|R

5|$|The problem {{develops}} in puppyhood although often subclinically, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> pain or stiffness, discomfort on extension, or other compensating characteristics. Diagnosis generally depends on X-rays, arthroscopy, or MRI scans. While cases of OCD of the stifle go undetected and heal spontaneously, others are exhibited in acute lameness. Surgery is recommended once the animal has been deemed lame.|$|E
5|$|A {{commonly}} studied {{variation of}} the problem involves networks of interior-disjoint smooth curves, with junctions where three {{or more of the}} curves meet. When the junctions all have exactly three curves meeting at angles of 2/3 (the same conditions seen in an optimal Steiner tree or two-dimensional foam of soap bubbles) the flow is well-defined for the short term. However, it may eventually reach a singular state with four or more curves meeting at a junction, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> {{more than one way to}} continue the flow past such a singularity.|$|E
5|$|New {{material}} from the Kaiparowits Formation of Utah, in Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, includes a skull and partial skeleton that represent the species G. monumentensis. Its skull was more robust {{than that of the}} other species, and its predentary had enlarged prongs along its upper margin, where the lower jaw's beak was based. This new species greatly expands the geographic range of this genus, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> a second, more lightly built species present as well. Multiple gryposaur species are known from the Kaiparowits Formation, represented by cranial and postcranial remains, and were larger than their northern counterparts.|$|E

Acute apical periodontitis is characterized by well-localized, spontaneous, persistent, moderate to severe pain. The alveolar process may be tender to palpation over the roots. The tooth may be raised in the socket and feel more prominent than the adjacent teeth.|$|E
5|$|In cool {{temperate}} regions, conifers often predominate; {{a widely}} distributed climax {{community in the}} far north of the northern hemisphere is moist taiga or northern coniferous forest (also called boreal forest). Taiga is the world's largest land biome, forming 29% of the world's forest cover. The long cold winter of the far north is unsuitable for plant growth and trees must grow rapidly in the short summer season when the temperature rises and the days are long. Light is very limited under their dense cover <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> little plant life on the forest floor, although fungi may abound. Similar woodland is found on mountains where the altitude causes the average temperature to be lower thus reducing {{the length of the}} growing season.|$|E
5|$|Drinking {{more than}} one drink a day for women or two drinks for men {{increases}} the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke. Risk is greater in younger people due to binge drinking which may result in violence or accidents. About 3.3 million deaths (5.9% of all deaths) are believed to be due to alcohol each year. Alcoholism reduces a person's life expectancy by around ten years and alcohol use is the third leading cause of early death in the United States. No professional medical association recommends that people who are nondrinkers should start drinking wine. Long-term alcohol abuse can cause a number of physical symptoms, including cirrhosis of the liver, pancreatitis, epilepsy, polyneuropathy, alcoholic dementia, heart disease, nutritional deficiencies, peptic ulcers and sexual dysfunction, and can eventually be fatal. Other physical effects include an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, malabsorption, alcoholic liver disease, and cancer. Damage to the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system can occur from sustained alcohol consumption. A wide range of immunologic defects can result <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> a generalized skeletal fragility, in addition to a recognized tendency to accidental injury, resulting a propensity to bone fractures.|$|E

5|$|The {{mating season}} lasts from August to February, and {{coincides with the}} arrival of the rainy season in {{northern}} Australia. The female does the bulk of the nest building, although the male does assist; this is unusual for the genus Malurus. Concealed in grass tussocks or low shrubs, the spherical nest is constructed of dried grasses and usually lined with smaller, finer grasses and hair. Nests examined in southeast Queensland tended to be larger and untidier than those in northern Australia; the former measured 1215cm high by 912cm wide and bore a partly covered 36cm diameter entrance, whereas the latter average around 1013cm in height by 68cm wide with a 24cm entrance. Construction takes around one week, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> an interval of up to another seven days before eggs are laid. The eggs produced are white with reddish-brown spots in clutches of three to four, and measure 14.517 x 1013mm; those of subspecies melanocephalus are a little larger than those of cruentatus. The eggs are incubated for two weeks by the female alone. The nestlings are hidden under cover for one week after hatching. The juveniles depend on parents and helpers for approximately one month. They learn to fly between 1112days after hatching. Broods hatched earlier in the season will help to raise the broods hatched later on. They will stay as a clutch group for the season after hatching.|$|E
