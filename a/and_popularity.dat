40|$|Little {{is known}} about {{individual}} differences in adolescents' motivation to achieve <b>and</b> maintain <b>popularity.</b> This study examined the moderating effects of prioritizing popularity on the associations between <b>popularity</b> <b>and</b> adjustment outcomes in late adolescence. Participants were 314 Dutch eleventh-grade students (M age = 16. 83 years; 52 % male) who completed measures of <b>popularity,</b> prioritizing <b>popularity,</b> <b>and</b> prosocial, antisocial, and risk behaviors. It was hypothesized that associations between <b>popularity</b> <b>and</b> adjustment outcomes are stronger for adolescents who prioritize popularity. The {{results indicate that the}} combination of being popular <b>and</b> valuing <b>popularity</b> was strongly related to antisocial and risk behaviors, but not to prosocial behaviors. Adolescents' social status motivations thus {{play an important role in}} the association of <b>popularity</b> with antisocial <b>and</b> risk behaviors in late adolescence...|$|R

5|$|All {{students}} {{have the right to}} enter upper secondary education when they turn sixteen. Around 97% of students leaving lower secondary education enter into upper secondary education; however there is a notable drop-out rate. There are specific entry requirements for different courses, but as all {{students have}} the right to this sort of education, a general program of study is available for those students who may fail to meet requirements. Some schools enjoy more prestige <b>and</b> <b>popularity</b> than others, especially in Reykjavík, and those may need to turn away hundreds of students every year.|$|E
5|$|American {{football}} leagues exist {{throughout the}} world, {{but the game}} has yet to achieve the international success <b>and</b> <b>popularity</b> of baseball and basketball.

5|$|Back at Rome, Tiberius instituted the Sodales Augustales, a priesthood of {{the cult}} of Augustus which Germanicus became a member of. When news arrived of his raid, Tiberius commemorated his {{services}} in the Senate with elaborate, but insincere praise: the proceedings gave him joy that the mutiny had been suppressed, but anxiety at the glory <b>and</b> <b>popularity</b> afforded to Germanicus. The Senate, in absence of Germanicus, voted {{that he should be}} given a triumph. Ovid's Fasti dates the Senate vote of Germanicus' triumph to 1 January AD 15.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Marcos was campaigning to become President, Imelda's {{influence}} in Marcos's political career was crucial. Her husband {{may have been}} a good tactician, but it was Imelda's determination <b>and</b> <b>popularity</b> that ensured votes for him. Marcos heavily relied on Imelda, and as time passed, Imelda was no longer a clone of Marcos. Instead, she had become his political partner.|$|E
5|$|Despite her {{publicity}} <b>and</b> <b>popularity,</b> Mansfield had no quality film roles after 1959. She {{was also}} unable {{to fulfill a}} third of her time contracted to Fox because of her repeated pregnancies.

She was first loaned out to English studios and then to Italian studios for a series of low-budget films, many of them obscure and some considered lost.|$|E

5|$|Heroes of Mana {{sold over}} 98,500 copies in Japan {{by the end}} of 2007. It sold 30,000 copies in North America and 50,000 in Europe as of November 2007, a few weeks after release in North America. Initial sales were lower than those for Children of Mana, the other Nintendo DS title in the series {{released}} one year earlier. Koichi Ishii attributed this to the overall lack of experience <b>and</b> <b>popularity</b> of the RTS genre in Japan.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1954 Donen made Deep in My Heart, a {{biography}} of the Hungarian-born American operetta composer Sigmund Romberg starring José Ferrer. The film included cameos by many MGM contract actors, including the only screen pairing of Gene Kelly and his brother Fred. Although it received mediocre reviews, Romberg's cult status <b>and</b> <b>popularity</b> helped make the film a hit financially.|$|E
5|$|The Priory of Sion myth {{has been}} exhaustively debunked by journalists and {{scholars}} {{as one of}} the great hoaxes of the 20th century.

Others are troubled by the romantic reactionary ideology unwittingly promoted in these works.|$|E

5|$|The actual musical {{ingredients}} of the Vespers were not novel to Mantua – concertato {{had been used}} by Lodovico Grossi da Viadana, a former choirmaster at the cathedral of Mantua, while the Sonata sopra had been anticipated by Archangelo Crotti in his Sancta Maria published in 1608. It is, writes Denis Arnold, Monteverdi's mixture of the various elements that makes the music unique. Arnold adds that the Vespers achieved fame <b>and</b> <b>popularity</b> only after their 20th-century rediscovery; they were not particularly regarded in Monteverdi's time.|$|E
5|$|Warwick {{had been}} such an {{influential}} figure in 15th-century English politics that, on his death, no one matched him in terms of power <b>and</b> <b>popularity.</b> Deprived of Warwick's support, the Lancastrians suffered their final defeat at the Battle of Tewkesbury on 4 May, which marked {{the downfall of the}} House of Lancaster and the ascendancy of the House of York. Three centuries after the Battle of Barnet, a stone obelisk was raised on the spot where Warwick purportedly died.|$|E

5|$|After the ban was lifted, Clouzot {{reestablished}} {{his reputation}} <b>and</b> <b>popularity</b> in France {{during the late}} 1940s with successful films including Quai des Orfèvres. After the release of his comedy film Miquette et sa mère, Clouzot married Véra Gibson-Amado, who would star in his next three feature films. In the early and mid-1950s, Clouzot drew acclaim from international critics and audiences for The Wages of Fear and Les Diaboliques. Both films would serve as source material for remakes decades later. After the release of La Vérité, Clouzot's wife Véra {{died of a heart}} attack and Clouzot's career suffered due to depression, illness and new critical views of films from the French New Wave. Clouzot's career became less active in later years, limited to a few television documentaries and two feature films in the 1960s. Clouzot wrote several unused scripts in the 1970s and died in Paris in 1977.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{had been}} the {{agreement}} before the war that Ernest would stay and manage Paterson, Laing and Bruce while his brothers were serving, Ernest Bruce decided to enlist in the British Army in 1915. Hence, in September 1916 Bruce sought to resign his commission and return to Australia to resume management of the family business. The War Office refused his request but granted him leave to return to Australia while recuperating from his injuries. As a decorated soldier on crutches with a gift for public speaking, he was enlisted to become a spokesperson for government recruitment in Australia. His success <b>and</b> <b>popularity</b> in this role brought the attention of the Nationalist League and then Prime Minister Billy Hughes, who lobbied the British government on his behalf and succeeded in convincing the War Office to allow Bruce to relinquish his commission in June 1917.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Civil Rights Movement {{challenging}} the restrictions and discrimination practiced against blacks exercise of constitutional rights, a series of US Supreme Court cases, beginning with Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, the 24th Amendment, and federal legislation: the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 had overturned the most controversial aspects of the 1902 Constitution – the provisions restricting voting by African Americans and mandating school segregation. Combined with the election of Governor Mills Godwin in 1965, there was impetus for governmental change. Godwin strongly advocated the loosening of the strict constitutional restrictions on state-issued bonds and borrowing, and used his power <b>and</b> <b>popularity</b> to push for a new constitution. In 1968 a joint resolution of the Virginia General Assembly approved a new commission, chaired by former Governor Albertis Harrison, to revise the constitution.|$|E
