5|$|The chapel predates the {{existing}} house, and {{functioned as a}} chantry chapel, where masses could {{be said for the}} souls of the family, both living and dead. It was built by Peter Lyte in about 1343, and was completed by 1358, and would have served both the original manor which now no longer survives and later {{the existing}} house. It has <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>window,</b> or squint, that permitted servants and others to observe communion from the house.|$|E
5|$|The {{principle}} transit circle was a 3-inch Combined Transit and Zenith telescope {{designed by}} Warner & Swasey especially for Illinois. The objective, by John Brashear, {{was held in}} place by a special cell that compensated for the different temperature conductivities of the brass and glass so that temperature had no effect on the location or separation of the lenses. Designated as model M-505, the transit included a handing level, micrometer and a built in reversing mechanism. This transit was located in the east-central transit room allowing direct access to the clock room through <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>window.</b> The instrument cost $1200 in 1896.|$|E

5|$|The prison {{reformer}} John Howard travelled {{around the}} country in the 1770s inspecting jails, and presented his research in The State of the Prisons in England and Wales (1777). In a jail owned by the Bishop of Ely, Howard wrote, prisoners had ten years earlier been kept chained to the floor on their backs, with spiked collars round their necks and iron bars over their legs. The Duke of Portland had a one-room cellar in Chesterfield that housed four prisoners, with no straw or heat, which had not been cleaned for months. Lord Arundel owned a jail in Penzance, where Howard found a debtor in a room 11ftx11ft and 6ft high, with <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>window.</b> The door of the room had not been opened for four weeks.|$|E
5|$|Cave 1 {{is divided}} into four parts: a veranda, a middle room, a cell, and a half cell. The veranda has a bench along the right wall. Its front {{possibly}} had two quadrangular pillars, traces of one are seen around the ceiling. A rock beam was present over the pillars, above the beam ribs and a rail pattern could have existed. In a recess below the veranda is an earth-filled cistern. A door with <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>window</b> to the left leads into the middle room. The middle room has a bench along the right wall. Towards {{the back of the}} middle room, to the left, is the half cell and to the right the cell. The half-cell has a bench along the right wall and to the left, has a square window connecting it to cave 2. A door with grooves for fitting a wooden frame, leads into the cell which has a bench along its right wall.|$|E

5|$|The {{computor}} cabinet {{included only}} four main controls. On {{the left side}} of the chassis, from top to bottom, were dials that set the wind direction, wind speed, target altitude and terminal velocity of the bomb. All of these inputs were set by reading their value in <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>window</b> on {{the left side of}} the dials. Additional windows provided output values for the indicated airspeed, course, and bombing angle (or range angle). Clips in the upper right held a card with levelling data, as well as notes about the sight or the bombs being dropped. The computor was also connected to several external sources. Compressed air was supplied from the engines to drive the mechanism, and an exhaust allowed the less dense used air to escape. Tubes were also connected to the pitot tube and static air source, which allowed the accurate measurement of airspeed. A separate electrical connection input the direction measured on the distant reading compass, using a selsyn.|$|E
5|$|With {{all of the}} {{evidence}} of the Bay Harbor Butcher murders pointing to Doakes as the killer, the case is closed. Forensic investigator Vince Masuka (C. S. Lee) tells Dexter the gas in the cabin was turned on while the stove was lit, and when Dexter sees his own satellite navigation system while cataloging evidence, he realizes that Lila must have found the cabin. He meets with her at the aquarium and tells her that he, like her, has no emotion and lives a life devoid of feeling. They form plans to leave Miami together, though Dexter secretly intends to kill her. When he visits her apartment the next day, though, he finds Debra there, trying to persuade Lila to leave town. Dexter is forced to lie about running away with Lila in front of Debra, so a hurt Lila then leaves with what she recognizes as Dexter's bag of murder equipment. She goes to Rita's house and drugs the babysitter so that she can abduct the children, Astor and Cody (Christina Robinson and Preston Bailey). When Dexter realizes that Astor and Cody are missing, he goes straight to Lila's apartment, where she lights another fire and locks the three of them inside. Rita calls Debra for her help, and Debra decides to skip her flight to Oregon with Lundy to help with finding the children. Dexter manages to free Astor and Cody through <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>window</b> and eventually rams down a thin wall allowing him to escape.|$|E

However, the viewers hear audio from the advertisers instead of the race broadcast. Other networks in the U.S. later followed with this procedure.|$|R

25|$|The oldest {{structure}} {{still standing}} is the log cabin, built ca. 1890. It is a ten by fifteen foot rectangle, {{the exterior of}} the building is covered with finished planks, fitted at the corners. The single entrance faces south, away from the Milligan ditch. Its wood-shingled roof is side-gabled with a medium pitch. There is a fireplace on its east side, with <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>window</b> on the corresponding west end of the building.|$|E
25|$|Taking low-key {{photographs}} {{is possible}} in dark rooms where light penetrates only through <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>window,</b> but the best results are achieved by using artificial studio lights. Sometimes, a single directed light source is sufficient. Usually, well-targeted sources are used to get the desired effect, since a large light source could considerably reduce the desired result. Special {{attention is paid to}} having sufficient details that will, invariably, be left in the shade. This type of lighting it's also known as Rembrandtian light.|$|E

25|$|American Motors {{created the}} Pacer by {{identifying}} emerging trends and design technologies, but it faced <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>window</b> of opportunity since {{a product that}} comes out either too early or too late can fail even if the opportunity was there initially. A further complication was the purchasing dynamics and the Pacer's design was focused on maximizing the internal sense of space, while the market focused on external dimensions. Many of the attributes the Pacer incorporated became the goal of all manufacturers in the two decades that followed.|$|E
25|$|The Ōfuna Camp {{consisted}} of three interconnected one-story buildings surrounding a large field, in turn surrounded by an eight-foot-high wooden fence. The area had formerly been an elementary school. The buildings were of unpainted wood roofed with tar paper, and had a long central corridor with thirty rooms to a side, each about six by nine feet (1.83 by 2.74 meters), a single electric light, bunk, bamboo mat, and door with <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>window.</b> One of the cells was a dispensary. The camp contained two latrines and one shower room, along with a barracks for the guards, kitchen, and rooms for the Japanese commandant, non-commissioned officers and orderly.|$|E
25|$|Olmsted also {{designed}} the Summer House, the open-air brick building that sits {{just north of}} the Capitol. Three arches open into the hexagonal structure, which encloses a fountain and twenty-two brick chairs. A fourth wall holds <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>window</b> that looks onto an artificial grotto. Built between 1879 and 1881, the Summer House was intended to answer complaints that visitors to the Capitol had no place to sit and no place to obtain water for their horses and themselves. Modern drinking fountains have since replaced Olmsted's fountain for the latter purpose. Olmsted intended to build a second, matching Summer House on the southern side of the Capitol, but congressional objections led to the project's cancellation.|$|E
