5|$|It was {{recognized}} {{early on that}} SiC had such a voltage-dependent resistance, and so columns of SiC pellets were connected between high-voltage power lines and the earth. When a lightning strike to the line raises the line voltage sufficiently, the SiC column will conduct, allowing strike current to pass harmlessly to the earth instead of along the power line. Such SiC columns proved to conduct significantly at normal power-line operating voltages and thus had {{to be placed in}} series with a spark gap. This spark gap is ionized and rendered conductive when lightning raises the voltage of the power line conductor, thus effectively connecting the SiC column between the power conductor and the earth. Spark gaps used in lightning arresters are unreliable, either failing to strike an arc when needed or failing to turn off afterwards, in the latter case due to material failure or contamination by dust or salt. Usage of SiC columns was originally intended to eliminate the need for the spark gap in a lightning <b>arrester.</b> Gapped SiC lightning arresters were used as lightning-protection tool and sold under GE and Westinghouse brand names, among others. The gapped SiC <b>arrester</b> has been largely displaced by no-gap varistors that use columns of zinc oxide pellets.|$|E
5|$|The Admiralty {{predicted}} that all Majestic-class carriers would require upgrades to their aircraft lifts and <b>arrester</b> gear {{in the early}} 1950s, to operate the faster and heavier carrier aircraft under development. Originally, the RAN wanted to upgrade Sydney to the same or similar standard as sister ship , after the second carrier was delivered. The installation of an angled flight deck and mirror landing aid, would have allowed Sydney to operate modern jet aircraft. However, financial and manpower restrictions led to the cancellation of this program.|$|E

The flight deck and hangar areas were enlarged, increasing the carrier's aircraft capacity. The ship was completely overhauled from 15 November 1939 to 15 November 1940 before returning to active service. In the meantime, a new generation of aircraft had entered service and Kaga embarked 12 Mitsubishi A5M fighters, 24 Aichi D1A dive bombers and 36 Yokosuka B4Y torpedo bombers. Another 18 aircraft were carried in crates as spares.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, the {{zinc oxide}} surge <b>arresters</b> (ZnO) {{are widely used}} in power systems, however, {{a large number of}} silicon carbide surge <b>arresters</b> (SiC) are still in service in the utilities. On the other hand, it is not {{possible}} to replace all SiC surge <b>arresters</b> in a short time period, being necessary to review the maintenance program taking into account the surge <b>arresters</b> that are more degraded. In this context, a research project was established between the University of Sao Paulo and the electrical utility CTEEP, aiming the investigation of its SiC surge <b>arresters.</b> This work shows that the leakage current measurement, a diagnostic method for the ZnO surge <b>arresters,</b> can provide useful information related to the condition of the SiC surge <b>arresters.</b> Analysis of the amplitude and distortion of the leakage current, also considering thermovision measurements, resulted in better evaluation of the SiC surge <b>arresters...</b>|$|R
5|$|During {{the late}} 1960s, No.1 and No.6 Squadrons were {{scheduled}} to be re-equipped with General Dynamics F-111C strike aircraft from 1968. Mechanical problems with United States Air Force (USAF) F-111s caused the RAAF to postpone its acceptance of these aircraft, however, leading for a requirement for an interim aircraft to equip both squadrons. McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom IIs were leased from the USAF, and No.6 Squadron was re-equipped with these aircraft between September and October 1970. The Phantoms proved highly successful, though one was severely damaged on its first flight at Amberley when it attempted an emergency landing and the <b>arrester</b> cable failed. It was repaired by No. 3 Aircraft Depot. No.6 Squadron's remaining Phantoms were handed back to the USAF on 4 October 1972 prior to the delivery of the F-111Cs.|$|E
5|$|An adult {{dragonfly}} {{has three}} distinct segments, the head, thorax, and abdomen {{as in all}} insects. It has a chitinous exoskeleton of hard plates held together with flexible membranes. The head is large with very short antennae. It {{is dominated by the}} two compound eyes, which cover most of its surface. The compound eyes are made up of ommatidia, the numbers being greater in the larger species. Aeshna interrupta has 22650 ommatidia of two varying sizes, 4500 being large. The facets facing downward tend to be smaller. Petalura gigantea has 23890 ommatidia of just one size. These facets provide complete vision in the frontal hemisphere of the dragonfly. The compound eyes meet {{at the top of the}} head (except in the Petaluridae and Gomphidae, as also in the genus Epiophlebia). Also, they have three simple eyes or ocelli. The mouthparts are adapted for biting with a toothed jaw; the flap-like labrum, at the front of the mouth, can be shot rapidly forward to catch prey. The head has a system for locking it in place that consists of muscles and small hairs on the back of the head that grip structures on the front of the first thoracic segment. This <b>arrester</b> system is unique to the Odonata, and is activated when feeding and during tandem flight.|$|E

40|$|Surge <b>arresters</b> are {{installed}} on {{transmission and distribution}} lines and in substations between phase and earth {{in order to improve}} the lightning performance and reduce the failure rates. High-energy stresses and housing deterioration are the main factors of degradation and damage of surge <b>arresters.</b> Thus, there is need for testing and monitoring the electrical network's <b>arresters,</b> in order to verify their good condition and their ability to effectively protect the lines. The most common method used, is the measurement of the arresters' total leakage current (with the isolation of the resistive part), which is an indicator of the <b>arrester's</b> condition, since every change, deterioration or damage leads to an increase of the resistive leakage current. In the current work, the total leakage current of two 20 kV ZnO surge <b>arresters</b> without gaps is measured and the resistive component for three different cases (brand new <b>arresters,</b> measurements under artificial rain and measurements after impulse voltage subjection) is computed. The analysis of the produced results can be useful in correct diagnosis of arresters' condition and in more effective schedule maintenance, since any recorded high-resistive currents do not necessarily result <b>arrester's</b> repair or replacement.
