5|$|During the 1948 Revolt of the Admirals, {{a number}} of naval {{officers}} publicly disagreed with the administration's policy over cuts to naval aviation and amphibious warfare capability, resulting in the relief of the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Louis Denfeld, and his replacement by Admiral Forrest Sherman. In testimony before the House Armed Services Committee investigation into the affair in October 1949, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Omar Bradley, doubted that there would ever be another large scale <b>amphibious</b> <b>operation.</b>|$|E
5|$|On September 15, Howe landed {{his army}} in an <b>amphibious</b> <b>operation</b> at Kip's Bay, {{on the eastern}} shore of Manhattan, along the East River. After a {{bombardment}} of the American positions on the shore, 4,000 British and Hessian troops landed, and they fought the Battle of Kip's Bay. The American troops began to flee {{at the sight of the}} enemy, and even after Washington arrived on the scene and took immediate command, demanding that his soldiers fight, they refused to obey orders and continued to flee.|$|E

5|$|In 468, Leo chose Basiliscus {{as leader}} of the famous {{military}} expedition against Carthage. The invasion of the kingdom of the Vandals {{was one of the greatest}} military undertakings recorded in the annals of history, a combined <b>amphibious</b> <b>operation</b> with over ten thousand ships and one hundred thousand soldiers. The purpose of the operation was to punish the Vandal king Geiseric for the sacking of Rome in 455, in which the former capital of the Western Roman Empire was overwhelmed, and the Empress Licinia Eudoxia (widow of Emperor Valentinian III) and her daughters were taken as hostages.|$|E
5|$|The Landing at Jacquinot Bay was an Allied <b>amphibious</b> <b>operation</b> {{undertaken}} on 4 November 1944 {{during the}} New Britain Campaign of World War II. The landing was conducted {{as part of}} a change in responsibility for Allied operations on New Britain with the Australian 5th Division, under Major General Alan Ramsay, taking over from the US 40th Infantry Division, which was needed for operations in the Philippines. The purpose of the operation was to establish a logistics base at Jacquinot Bay on the south coast of New Britain to support the 5th Division's planned operations near the major Japanese garrison at Rabaul.|$|E
5|$|The Landing at Lae was an amphibious landing to {{the east}} of Lae and then the {{subsequent}} advance on the town during the Salamaua–Lae campaign of World War II. Part of Operation Postern, which was undertaken to capture the Japanese base at Lae, the landing was undertaken between 4 and 6 September 1943 by Australian troops from the 9th Division, supported by US naval forces from the VII Amphibious Force. The first major <b>amphibious</b> <b>operation</b> undertaken by the Australian Army since the failed Gallipoli Campaign, the Australians invested a significant amount of effort into planning the operation.|$|E

5|$|The {{production}} hired Samuel Jaskilka, {{a retired}} Marine Corps Lieutenant General {{who took part}} in the Battle of Inchon as a company commander, as technical advisor to the film. A portion of the movie was filmed aboard the USS Cleveland, an Austin-class amphibious transport dock during an <b>amphibious</b> <b>operation</b> off the coast of South Korea in 1978. The United States Department of Defense allowed 1,500 soldiers from the United States Army and United States Marine Corps to participate as extras in the film, at a cost of $77,000.|$|E
5|$|Anticipating {{that the}} Japanese would strike at Port Moresby again, the {{garrison}} was strengthened and MacArthur ordered {{the establishment of}} new bases at Merauke and Milne Bay to cover its flanks. The Battle of Midway in June 1942 led to consideration of a limited offensive in the Pacific. MacArthur's proposal for {{an attack on the}} Japanese base at Rabaul met with objections from the Navy, which favored a less ambitious approach, and objected to an Army general being in command of what would be an <b>amphibious</b> <b>operation.</b> The resulting compromise called for a three-stage advance. The first stage, the seizure of the Tulagi area, would be conducted by the Pacific Ocean Areas, under Admiral Chester W. Nimitz. The later stages would be under MacArthur's command.|$|E
5|$|Florida {{returned}} to normal peacetime duties in January 1919, when she arrived in Norfolk on the 4th. She steamed to the Azores to take weather observations for Navy seaplanes that were {{to make the first}} aerial crossing the Atlantic. In August 1920, Florida was present during the 300th anniversary of the Pilgrims' landing at Provincetown, Massachusetts. In December 1920, she made a good-will cruise to South America with US Secretary of State Bainbridge Colby aboard and {{over the next three years}} conducted <b>amphibious</b> <b>operation</b> training with the Marine Corps in the Caribbean. Florida also participated in the normal routine of exercises and midshipman cruises. During this period, she was made the flagship of the Commander, Control Force, US Fleet.|$|E

5|$|Following training, the {{battalion}} was deployed to New Guinea, arriving in Milne Bay in early August 1943. It saw {{action in the}} final stages of the Salamaua–Lae campaign in September 1943. The 2/15 took part in the landing at Lae, the first <b>amphibious</b> <b>operation</b> undertaken by Australian forces since the failed Gallipoli campaign in 1915. During the operation, the 2/15th was initially assigned the task of securing the beachhead following the 20th Brigade's landing. After being relieved it joined the advance west towards the town, slowed by heavy rains that turned the many creeks in the area into raging torrents, which were invariably covered by heavy Japanese fire from the opposite bank.|$|E
5|$|For {{two weeks}} the British and French squadrons watched one another, the British unable to attack and the French unable to escape. In {{an effort to}} break the deadlock, Cochrane sent to Martinique for a body of 3,000 men under Major-General Frederick Maitland. With this force he {{launched}} a surprise invasion of the islands on 14 April, the <b>amphibious</b> <b>operation</b> commanded by Captain Philip Beaver in HMS Acasta and executed successfully with only minor casualties. Parties of seamen went ashore {{in the wake of}} the soldiers, working rapidly to establish a battery of two 8-inch howitzers on Morne-Russell. These guns began firing during the afternoon and by 20:00 Troude had given orders for his squadron to sail through the western channel during the night.|$|E
5|$|The Invasion of Isle de France was a {{complicated}} but successful <b>amphibious</b> <b>operation</b> in the Indian Ocean, launched in November 1810 during the Napoleonic Wars. During the operation, a substantial British military force was landed by the Royal Navy at Grand Baie on Isle de France (now Mauritius). Marching inland against weak French opposition, the British force {{was able to}} overwhelm the defenders {{in a series of}} minor engagements, culminating in the capture of the island's capital Port Napoleon and the surrender of Charles Decaen, the French governor. The surrender eliminated the last French territory in the Indian Ocean and among the military equipment captured were five French Navy frigates and 209 heavy cannon. Isle de France was retained by Britain {{at the end of the}} war under the name of Mauritius and remained part of the British Empire until 1968.|$|E

5|$|The Invasion of Île Bonaparte was an <b>amphibious</b> <b>operation</b> in 1810 {{that formed}} an {{important}} part of the British campaign to blockade and capture the French Indian Ocean territories of Île Bonaparte (now Réunion) and Isle de France (now Mauritius) during the Napoleonic Wars. These islands formed a fortified base for a French frigate squadron under Commodore Jacques Hamelin to raid British convoys of East Indiamen travelling between Britain and British India. Hamelin's ships had destroyed two convoys the previous year despite the attention of a squadron of Royal Navy ships under Commodore Josias Rowley. Rowley had responded by raiding the fortified anchorage of Saint Paul on Île Bonaparte and capturing one of Hamelin's frigates and two captured East Indiamen.|$|E
5|$|The Raid on Saint-Paul was an <b>amphibious</b> <b>operation</b> {{conducted}} by a combined British Army, Royal Navy and Royal Marines force against the fortified French port of Saint Paul on Île Bonaparte (now known as Réunion) during the Napoleonic Wars. The operation was launched on 20September 1809 as both a precursor to a future full-scale invasion of Île Bonaparte {{and in order to}} capture the French frigate Caroline and the East Indiamen she had seized in the Action of 31 May 1809 which were sheltering in the harbour. The operation was a complete success, with British storming parties capturing the batteries overlooking the port, which allowed a naval squadron under Commodore Josias Rowley to enter the bay and capture the shipping in the harbour.|$|E
5|$|The {{invasion}} of Martinique of 1809 {{was a successful}} British <b>amphibious</b> <b>operation</b> against the French West Indian island of Martinique that took place between 30 January and 24 February 1809 during the West Indies Campaign 1804–1810 of the Napoleonic Wars. Martinique, like nearby Guadeloupe, was {{a major threat to}} British trade in the Caribbean, providing a sheltered base from which privateers and French Navy warships could raid British shipping and disrupt the trade routes that maintained the British economy. The islands also provided a focus for larger scale French operations in the region and in the autumn of 1808, following the Spanish alliance with Britain, the Admiralty decided to order a British squadron to neutralise the threat, beginning with Martinique.|$|E

5|$|A partial {{evacuation}} of British citizens {{was completed by}} 17 January, when the army riots in Southeast Africa prompted Rhyls diversion to Tanganyika so the troops she was carrying could assist in quelling the mutiny. In replacement, a company of the Gordon Highlanders was loaded aboard Owen so an intervention could still be made if necessary. The aircraft carriers Centaur and Victorious were also transferred to the region as part of Operation Parthenon. Although never enacted, Parthenon {{was intended as a}} precaution should Okello or the Umma party radicals attempt to seize power from the more moderate ASP. In addition to the two carriers, the plan involved three destroyers, Owen, 13 helicopters, 21 transport and reconnaissance aircraft, the second battalion of the Scots Guards, 45 Commando of the Royal Marines and one company of the second battalion of the Parachute Regiment. The island of Unguja, and its airport, were to be seized by parachute and helicopter assault, followed up by the occupation of Pemba. Parthenon would have been the largest British airborne and <b>amphibious</b> <b>operation</b> since the Suez Crisis.|$|E
5|$|After the Allied {{invasion}} of Italy in early September, the Eighth Army advanced rapidly. By {{the middle of}} October the army {{was on the line}} of Termoli, Campobasso and Vinchiaturo. German resistance had stiffened in the last stages of the advance. The Fifth Army captured Naples on 1 October and then crossed the Volturno against strong German resistance. By this point the Allies had run up against the fortifications of the Winter Line. The 15th Army Group commander Harold Alexander revised the plan for the winter, which involved the capture of the high ground north of Pescara after crossing the Trigno, Sangro and Pescara rivers. The Fifth Army would advance up the Liri Valley and when both armies were close to Rome, an <b>amphibious</b> <b>operation</b> would be launched south of the Tiber. To prepare for the offensive, the Allies advanced through the outlying Winter Line defences. The Eighth Army crossed the Trigno in late October and Montgomery planned to advance along the coast road to Pescara, which was the most defended route. Montgomery considered his four infantry divisions too weak to break the line without reinforcement.|$|E
5|$|Duperré did {{not meet}} any British ships on his journey back to the French island, {{as most of the}} British {{blockade}} squadron were engaged {{in the aftermath of the}} Invasion of Île Bonaparte, conducted during July by Commodore Rowley. With the British distracted by this <b>amphibious</b> <b>operation,</b> it was simple for Duperré to reach Grand Port on the south east coast of Île de France in spite of the small blockade squadron under Captain Samuel Pym. This narrow and well-protected anchorage was considered to be the best place to refit the battered French squadron, but in August it came under attack by a British squadron in the Battle of Grand Port. This action was a disaster for the British as their ships became grounded in the unfamiliar shoals of the harbour and four frigates were lost under fire from shore batteries and Duperré's squadron.|$|E
