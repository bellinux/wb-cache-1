40|$|Locoweed, a {{well-known}} teratogenic plant affecting livestock, is prevalent in mountain {{regions of the}} Western United States. Two common species (Astragalus lentiginosus and A. wootoni), administered to pregnant rats, induced behavioral deviations in their offspring. Treated mothers consumed less feed and gained less wieght during gestation than controls when gavaged locoweed {{at the rate of}} 1 gram whole plant per day on days 7 through 17 of gestation. A. lentiginosus reduced pup weight at birth (13 % less than controls) and this weight reduction (as much as 29 % less than controls) continued at least four weeks. A. lentiginosus also reduced number of offspring born alive (34. 9 % less than controls) and number which survived until weaning (86. 4 % less than controls). No gross malformations were observed in the offspring of loco-treated dams. however, when the pups were subjected to behavioral testing (beginning at 30 days of age), deviations were observed. there was considerable difference among the treatment groups when tested with the activity wheel (P=. 0000). Water-intubated controls did not differ from non-fed controls, but the two loco-treated groups differed in opposite directions from controls. A. lentiginosus offspring were more active (26. 5 %) overall than other groups, and had an abnormal pattern of activity in the day to evening night <b>activity</b> <b>totals.</b> A. wootoni offpsring were less active (25 %) than other groups in the activity wheel. Significant differences among groups were also observed in the open-field test. The trend was toward decreased activity (P=. 027; 31 and 43 % less than controls - A. lentiginosus and A. wootoni respectively) and increased number of fecal boluses (P=. 06; 45. 5 and 19. 3 % more than controls - A. lentiginosus and A. wootoni respectively) in the loco-treated offspring. There {{were no significant differences in}} avoidance conditioning in a two-way shuttle box among the groups, though the loco offspring made fewer avoidance responses than controls. Alizarin Red-S staining of fetuses revealed no skeletal defects in the pups. Microscopic examination of maternal tissues showed the kidney and liver degenerative changes which are typical of locoweed intoxication: primarily vacuolation of proximal tubular epithelium and of the hepatocytes. Tissues from pups on day of birth also showed mild kidney and liver changes. Older pups had no visible microscopic deviations from normal. The results indicate that the locoweed teratogen produces behavioral deviations in the offspring of rats in the absence of gross malformations...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION Pages 1 - 2 Policy question: How should World Vision best train {{children}} and youth in conflict zones in conflict analysis methods? The purpose of this project is to enable World Vision to reach its objective of “empowering children as agents of transformation” (World Vision International). That is, to make informed recommendations for all World Vision’s conflict analysis programs for youth in conflict zones, using the completed Empowering Children as Peacebuilders (ECaP) project from the World Vision Development Foundation, Philippines as a baseline. POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS Pages 30 - 37 Options that would most clearly improve conflict analysis programs for {{children and}} youth in conflict zones include: Option 2 : Formalize a worldwide ECaP practitioner group Design an ongoing professional development program for ECaP practitioners to facilitate contact among themselves, distribute well-curated information, and to help build connections with other organizations. This option would likely {{take the form of}} a mobile application, website, and/or newsletter and annual or biannual conferences. Option 1 : Parent-child conflict analysis training Based on the ECaP model, World Vision would conduct conflict analysis training where a parent and a child go through the training together. Option 3 : Develop simulations World Vision would develop simulations where ECaP participants play the roles of stakeholders in real conflicts. A narrator will describe events and offer possible choices, and the participants will arrive at a possible resolution. Then, they will compare the version of events they created to the events as they actually happened. Option 8 : Have trigger events for scaling a program up Events, such as reaching a certain saturation of ECaP-trained kids in an area, would trigger new options for scaling up. These would include advocacy training and activities, further involvement with interfaith groups, and facilitation of conflict analysis programs for other organizations. Option 4 : Develop a series of follow-up activities These may include the simulations and case studies listed above, opportunities for training, or involvement in community volunteer work. They are designed to help {{children and youth}} practice and refresh their skills, and to keep those over 18 years old involved. METHODS Pages 8 - 10 I gathered data from a literature review, expert and stakeholder interviews, and from field research at World Vision Development Foundation’s Mindanao 2 field office and Matina Aplaya Area Development Program office in the Philippines. Research <b>Activity</b> <b>totals</b> for research trip to Davao City, Philippines: •	 4 focus group discussions •	 5 WVDF staff interviews (Mindanao, national office staff) •	 8 individual interviews with ECaP trainers and ECaP trainer parents •	 2 home visits to ECaP trainer parents •	 2 debriefings with preliminary findings CRITERIA I weigh each policy option by how well it fulfills the general criteria below: •	Gives participants skills they use effectively •	Likely to reduce conflict in the short term •	Likely to reduce conflict in the long term •	Allows WV to contribute to peacebuilding field •	Financially and programmatically sustainable FINDINGS Pages 18 - 29 There are many challenges to effective peacebuilding, but conflict analysis training seems to empower children to contribute to peace in their families and communities. My findings show that the ECaP project in Davao, Philippines improved children’s lives by improving their relationships and giving them key skills. ECaP was even more successful than anticipated. Not only did children become more responsible and dutiful; they also mediated in family conflicts. The ECaP trainers have the capacity to be effective trainers, but they need resources to keep their skills up-to-date and applicable. In implementing conflict analysis programs for youth, World Vision must The key tasks will be ensuring that ECaP participants have ongoing encouragement and training even after they age out of the programs, and that World Vision conflict analysis programs set appropriate goals, assess the program’s context, identify the group of children or youth to be trained, design the program, and evaluate the results...|$|E
