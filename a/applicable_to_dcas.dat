40|$|As {{an immune}} {{inspired}} algorithm, the Dendritic Cell Algorithm (DCA) {{has been applied}} to a range of problems, particularly in the area of intrusion detection. Ideally, the intrusion detection should be performed in real-time, to continuously detect misuses as soon as they occur. Consequently, the analysis process performed by an intrusion detection system must operate in real-time or near-to real-time. The analysis process of the DCA is currently performed offline, therefore to improve the algorithm’s performance we suggest the development of a real-time analysis component. The initial step of the development is to apply segmentation <b>to</b> the <b>DCA.</b> This involves segmenting the current output of the DCA into slices and performing the analysis in various ways. Two segmentation approaches are introduced and tested in this paper, namely antigen based segmentation (ABS) and time based segmentation (TBS). The results of the corresponding experiments suggest that applying segmentation produces different and significantly better results in some cases, when compared <b>to</b> the standard <b>DCA</b> without segmentation. Therefore, we conclude that the segmentation is <b>applicable</b> <b>to</b> the <b>DCA</b> for the purpose of real-time analysis...|$|R

40|$|Dichloroacetic acid (DCA), a minor {{metabolite}} of trichloroethylene (TCE) {{and water}} disinfection byproduct, remains an important risk assessment issue {{because of its}} carcinogenic potency. DCA {{has been shown to}} inhibit its own metabolism by irreversibly inactivating glutathione transferase zeta (GSTzeta). To better predict internal dosimetry of DCA, a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of DCA was developed. Suicide inhibition was described dynamically by varying the rate of maximal GSTzetamediated metabolism of DCA (V max) over time. Resynthesis (zero-order) and degradation (first-order) of metabolic activity were described. Published iv pharmacokinetic studies in naïve rats were used to estimate an initial Vmax value, with Km set to an in vitro determined value. Degradation and resynthesis rates were set to estimated values from a published immunoreactive GSTzeta protein time course. The first-order inhibition rate, kd, was estimated to this same time course. A secondary, linear non-GSTzeta-mediated metabolic pathway is proposed <b>to</b> fit <b>DCA</b> time courses following treatment with DCA in drinking water. The PBPK model predictions were validated by comparing predicted <b>DCA</b> concentrations <b>to</b> measured concentrations in published studies of rats pretreated with DCA following iv exposure to 0. 05 <b>to</b> 20 mg/kg <b>DCA.</b> The same model structure was parameterized <b>to</b> simulate <b>DCA</b> time courses following iv exposure in naïve and pretreated mice. Blood and liver concentrations during and postexposure <b>to</b> <b>DCA</b> in drinking water were predicted. Comparisons of PBPK model predicted to measured values were favorable, lending support for the further development of this model for application <b>to</b> <b>DCA</b> or TCE human health risk assessment.

40|$|Dichloroacetate (DCA) is a {{structural}} analog of pyruvate {{that has been}} recommended {{for the treatment of}} primary lactic aci-demia, particularly in patients with pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDHC) deficiency. Recent reports have demonstrated that the response <b>to</b> <b>DCA</b> may depend on the type of molecular abnor-mality. In this study, we investigated the response <b>to</b> <b>DCA</b> in various PDHC-deficient cell lines and tried to determine the mechanism involved. The effect of chronic 3 -d DCA treatment on PDHC activity was assessed in two PDHC-deficient cell lines, each with a different point mutation in the E 1 subunit gene (R 378 C and R 88 C), and one cell line in which an 8 -bp tandem repeat was deleted (W 383 del). Only two (R 378 C and R 88 C) of the three PDHC-deficient cell lines with very low levels of PDHC activity and unstable polypeptides were sensitive <b>to</b> chronic <b>DCA</b> treatment. In these cell lines, DCA treatment resulted in an increase in PDHC activity by 125 and 70 %, respectively, with concomitant increases of 121 and 130 % in steady-state levels of immunoreactive E 1. DCA treatment re-duced the turnover of the E 1 subunit in R 378 C and R 88 C mutant cells with no significant effect on the E 1 subunit. Chronic DCA treatment significantly improved the metabolic function of PDHC in digitonin-permeabilized R 378 C and R 88 C fibroblasts. The occurrence of DCA-sensitive mutations suggests that DCA treatment is potentially useful as an adjuvant to ketogenic and vitamin treatment in PDHC-deficient patients...|$|R

40|$|Pyruvate {{dehydrogenase}} complex (PDHC) is a {{key enzyme}} in metabolism linking glycolysis to tricarboxylic acid cycle and its activity is tightly regulated by phosphorylation catalyzed by four pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) isoforms.
