However, in Paris, she refused permission for the Gaîté to mount the work in that form, and {{the directors of the}} Théâtre des Nouveautés, Boulevard des Italiens therefore procured a much altered libretto from Alfred Delacour and Victor Wilder, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>form</b> the Paris première was produced at that theatre on 15 March 1879, with costumes by Grévin, running for 59 nights. Revived in April 1882, the production received 55 more performances, with Marguerite Ugalde in the title role.|$|E

He portrayed a bloodthirsty pirate in Captain Kidd (1945) and a malevolent judge in The Paradine Case (1948). Laughton played a megalomaniac press tycoon in The Big Clock (1948). He had supporting roles as a Nazi in pre-war Paris in Arch of Triumph (1948), as a bishop in The Girl from Manhattan (1948), as a seedy go-between in The Bribe (1949), {{and as a}} kindly widower in The Blue Veil (1951). He played a Bible-reading pastor in the multi-story A Miracle Can Happen (1947), but his piece wound up being cut and replaced with another featuring Dorothy Lamour, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>form</b> the film was retitled as On Our Merry Way. However, an original print of A Miracle Can Happen was sent abroad for dubbing before the Laughton sequence was deleted, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>form</b> it was shown in Spain as Una Encuesta Llamada Milagro.|$|E

25|$|Amulets are {{plentiful}} in the Jewish tradition, {{with examples of}} Solomon-era amulets existing in many museums. Due to the proscription of idols and other graven images in Judaism, Jewish amulets emphasize text and names. The shape, material, and color of a Jewish amulet makes no difference. Examples of textual amulets include the Silver Scroll, circa 630 BCE, and the still contemporary mezuzah and tefillin. A counter-example, however, is the Hand of Miriam, an outline of a human hand. Another non-textual amulet is the Seal of Solomon, {{also known as the}} hexagram or Star of David. In one form. it consists of two intertwined equilateral triangles, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>form</b> it is commonly worn suspended around the neck to this day.|$|E
25|$|After the war {{production}} restarted {{with the}} 532cc Standard Tourer and in 1922 Scott introduced the Squirrel, its first sporting model {{to be offered}} to the general public. This had a slightly smaller 486cc engine to bring it within the 500cc competition limit but, with aluminium pistons and careful preparation, it produced more power. In addition, many heavy accessories such as foot boards and leg shields which had been fitted to the touring models were dispensed with, making it a very light and competitive motorcycle. It {{was followed by the}} Super Squirrel, with a further revised engine of 498cc or 596cc, which was the mainstay of production in the mid-1920s. Although they never regained their pre-war form, Scotts continued to compete successfully in sporting events scoring a 3-4 in the 1922 TT and a third in 1924. A three-speed gearbox with conventional clutch was offered from 1923 <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>form</b> the machine had some success as a trials motorcycle.|$|E

2500|$|The {{convention}} of using colors originates from coloring {{the countries of}} a map, where each face is literally colored. [...] This was generalized to coloring the faces of a graph embedded in the plane.

[...] In mathematical and computer representations, it is typical to use the first few positive or nonnegative integers as the [...] "colors".

2500|$|According to {{traditional}} Malay lore, {{the human soul}} (semangat or essence) {{is about the size}} of a thumb and appears as a miniature form of the body (sarung or casing) in which it resides. Able to fly and quickly [...] "flash" [...] from one location to another, the soul is often compared to and addressed as if it were a bird. It temporarily leaves the person's body during sleep, trance and sickness, before departing permanently at death. When the soul leaves the body it assumes the form of a sort of homunculus, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>form</b> can feed on the souls of others. At death, the soul usually passes into another person, animal or plant. The spirit or ghost, usually called the Anitu or Hantu, continues to linger and may be harmful to its survivors.|$|E

2500|$|In early Christianity, {{a program}} of {{exorcism}} was preliminary to baptism {{as a kind of}} purification and to drive away evil spirits, and not necessarily because the person was thought to be possessed. The ambiguous state of the unbaptized is expressed by conflicting views of the infant: that the newborn had not sinned, and that the newborn nonetheless bore the pollution of original sin and was thus closer to the Devil than to God. The travel writer Sonnini de Manoncourt recorded that the Greeks called an unbaptized child drako (or dracon, [...] "serpent, python, dragon"). At baptism, the name Drako is shed and replaced with a Christian name. The names of Gylo include Chomodracaena, containing drakaina, [...] "female dragon." [...] In one text dealing with the gello, she is banished to the mountains to drink the blood of the drako; in another, she becomes a drako <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>form</b> attacks human beings. In other texts, the child itself is addressed as Abouzin (Abyzou).|$|E
2500|$|Another {{feature of}} Nordström's {{theory is that}} it can be written as the theory of a certain scalar field in Minkowski spacetime, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>form</b> enjoys the {{expected}} conservation law for nongravitational mass-energy together with gravitational field energy, but suffers from a not very memorable force law. [...] In the curved spacetime formulation the motion of test particles is described (the world line of a free test particle is a timelike geodesic, and by an obvious limit, the world line of a laser pulse is a null geodesic), but we lose the conservation law. [...] So which interpretation is correct? [...] In other words, which metric is the one which according to Nordström can be measured locally by physical experiments? [...] The answer is: the curved spacetime is the physically observable one in this theory (as in all metric theories of gravitation); the flat background is a mere mathematical fiction which is however of inestimable value for such purposes as writing down the general vacuum solution, or studying the weak field limit.|$|E
2500|$|Heidegger's later works, {{beginning}} by 1930 {{and largely}} {{established by the}} early 1940s, seem to many commentators (e.g. William J. Richardson) to at least reflect a shift of focus, if not indeed {{a major change in}} his philosophical thinking which is known as [...] "the turn" [...] (die Kehre). One way this has been understood is as a shift from [...] "doing" [...] to [...] "dwelling" [...] and from Being and Time to Time and Being. However, others feel that this is to overstate the difference. Heidegger himself held between 1 and 4 December 1949 at Bremen Club four lectures, which were repeated in the spring of 1950 (25 and 26 March) unchanged at [...] The titles were Das Ding, Das Gestell, Die Gefahr and Die Kehre.

In 1962, Die Frage nach der Technik and the fourth lecture Die Kehre were published together in a small book called Die Technik und die Kehre, which is still in print. The Bremen lectures were published all four together, and in their original form, only in 1994 in volume 79 of the Gesamtausgabe.|$|E
