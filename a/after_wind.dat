5|$|Cyclone Cilla {{affected}} several {{islands in}} the South Pacific. The cyclone developed from a monsoon trough on January 26 northwest of Fiji, and initially moved to the east in conditions unfavourable for cyclones. <b>After</b> <b>wind</b> shear lessened, Cilla reached its peak intensity on January 28, attaining maximum winds of 75km/h (45mph) sustained over 10minutes. After slightly weakening, Cilla was able to intensify again to match this intensity on January 29. Strong vertical wind shear conditions then returned, and Cilla transitioned into an extratropical cyclone.|$|E

5|$|A low {{pressure}} area developed along {{the end of a}} quasi-stationary frontal trough. Initially, vertical wind shear prevented deep convection from forming on the western portion of the system. <b>After</b> <b>wind</b> shear decreased, the system became a gale center late on October 22. By early on the following day, the gale center had transitioned into a tropical storm, and it is estimated that Tropical Storm Frances developed at 0600UTC on October 23. Frances quickly strengthened after becoming a tropical storm, and was upgraded to a hurricane by 1800UTC on that same day. After becoming a hurricane, Frances curved northeastward, and remained well east of Bermuda. By midday on October 24, Frances peaked as an 85mph (140km/h) Category1 hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Barry was {{a rapidly}} forming {{tropical}} cyclone that made landfall on Florida, United States, in early June 2007. The second named storm of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season, Barry developed from a trough of low {{pressure in the}} southeastern Gulf of Mexico on June 1. It tracked rapidly northeastward, reaching peak winds of 60mph (95km/h) before weakening and making landfall near Tampa Bay as a tropical depression. Barry quickly lost tropical characteristics <b>after</b> <b>wind</b> shear removed much of the convection, and early on June 3 it completed the transition into an extratropical cyclone. The extratropical remnants tracked up the East Coast of the United States, and were absorbed by a larger extratropical cyclone on June 5.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Amara brought stormy {{conditions}} to Rodrigues in December2013. Amara {{was the first}} named storm in the southwest Indian Ocean during the later half of 2013, and developed from a disturbance within the monsoon trough on December14. The following day, the system attained tropical depression status. Despite its ill-defined organization, the depression was able to continue strengthening, reaching moderate tropical storm status on December16 as it tracked southwest. Situated in a favorable atmospheric environment, a period of rapid intensification ensued after Amara reached tropical cyclone status on December18. After fluctuating in strength, the cyclone peaked with maximum sustained winds of 205km/h (125mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 933mbar (hPa; 27.55inHg) on December21, making it an intense tropical cyclone based on the intensity scale utilized by Météo-France. Shortly <b>after,</b> <b>wind</b> shear strengthened as Amara tracked southeast, resulting in a weakening phase. The shearing effects caused the cyclone to rapidly decay, and by December23, Amara degenerated into a remnant low.|$|E

5|$|Patterns {{can form}} {{for other reasons}} in the vegetated {{landscape}} of tiger bush and fir waves. Tiger bush stripes occur on arid slopes where plant growth is limited by rainfall. Each roughly horizontal stripe of vegetation effectively collects the rainwater from the bare zone immediately above it. Fir waves occur in forests on mountain slopes <b>after</b> <b>wind</b> disturbance, during regeneration. When trees fall, the trees that they had sheltered become exposed and are in turn {{more likely to be}} damaged, so gaps tend to expand downwind. Meanwhile, on the windward side, young trees grow, protected by the wind shadow of the remaining tall trees. Natural patterns are sometimes formed by animals, as in the Mima mounds of the Northwestern United States and some other areas, which appear to be created over many years by the burrowing activities of pocket gophers, while the so-called fairy circles of Namibia appear to be created by the interaction of competing groups of sand termites, along with competition for water among the desert plants.|$|E
25|$|The {{leaves are}} flat linear, 3–8cm long and 2–5mm broad. They are {{arranged}} spirally on the shoot but twisted {{at the base}} to appear in two or four flattened ranks. As the leaves mature, they develop from bright lime-green to a more yellowish-green. The seed cones are green, 6–12cm long and 5–10cm in diameter, and mature about 18–20 months <b>after</b> <b>wind</b> pollination. They disintegrate at maturity to release the seeds which are small and brown, thin and papery with a wing around the edge to aid wind-dispersal. The male (pollen) cones are slender conic, 5–11cm long and 1–2cm broad and reddish-brown in colour and are lower on the tree than the seed cones. Seedlings appear to be slow-growing and mature trees are extremely long-lived; {{some of the older}} individuals today are estimated to be between 500 and 1,000 years old.|$|E

500|$|Located to {{the south}} of a ridge across the southwestern Atlantic Ocean, the {{depression}} tracked west-northwestward through an area of dry air and westerly wind shear.

Convection deepened and expanded, though wind shear displaced the low-level center {{to the west of the}} convection. By August 26, the structure had become much better-defined, and within five days Ernesto was forecast to be located about 275mi (445km) south of the Gulf Coast of the United States as a powerful hurricane.

500|$|After the {{previous}} Tropical Storm Chantelle lost its circulation near Diego Garcia on November30, residual convection persisted {{and moved to}} the southwest due to a large ridge. A new tropical disturbance developed on December2 <b>after</b> <b>wind</b> shear diminished. Because the remnants took longer than 48hours to redevelop, the MFR policy at the time was to treat the disturbance as a new system. On December3, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Daniella, and an eye began to form the next day, indicative of further strengthening. The MFR upgraded Daniella to tropical cyclone status on December5. At 1800UTC that day, both the MFR and JTWC estimated peak winds; the former agency estimated 10minute winds of 185km/h (115mph), making Daniella an intense tropical cyclone, and the JTWC estimated 1minute winds of 220km/h (140mph). Around that time, the cyclone turned to the south due to an approaching trough. The eye, previously well-defined and [...] in diameter at its peak, gradually became less organized due to decreasing water temperatures. Daniella turned more to the southeast on December8, bringing it between the islands of Réunion and Mauritius after weakening into a strong tropical storm. A sharp increase in wind shear removed the convection from the circulation on December9, weakening Daniella to tropical depression status. Two days later, the circulation dissipated.|$|E
