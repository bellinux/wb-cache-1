5|$|Since the {{development}} staff had {{an equal number}} of writers as illustrators, it was originally planned to pair each illustrator with a single scenario writer; Mistumi was also to provide designs for the main heroine. Though this would have simplified the project's workload by easing communications among the staff, the idea was scrapped once the staff realized that the final product might merely be a collection of four distinct pieces. Ultimately, writing and design responsibilities were divided based on the staff members' individual preferences. The staff also commented that {{the development}} team faced communication difficulties because of the physical distance between the two Aquaplus studios. Early in production, members from both studios gathered in a single location to discuss development, but as production progressed, they began to rely on other methods of communication such as telephone calls <b>and</b> <b>instant</b> messaging. Washimi noted that these methods made it complicated for the writers and illustrators to communicate effectively, and during the development of To Heart 2 X Rated, Miyake took a two-month-long business trip to Osaka to rectify the problem.|$|E
5|$|Turner marketed Real Adventures {{through a}} {{substantial}} diversity of products, considering its Quest campaign {{a role model}} for future shows. Galoob acquired figurine licensing rights in 1995 and created a product line of vehicles, figures, and Micro Machines for fall 1996 release. Turner felt that Galoob's commitment legitimized the Quest marketing plan, and next secured partnership with Pizza Hut and food retailers. Pillsbury included $3mail-in rebates for future Quest videos, display contests, <b>and</b> <b>instant</b> coupon offers on over 20million packages. Campbell Soup Company released six holographic miniature posters on the same number of SpaghettiOs cans; the posters were awarded in Converting in 1997. General Mills outfitted boxes of Honey Nut Cheerios and Cinnamon Toast Crunch with offers for T-shirts and other items. Over five thousand Pizza Hut restaurants held a two-month-long give-away of figurines with meals during the show's launch. Galoob failed to build popularity for its toys outside the United States, and discontinued the line in 1997.|$|E
60|$|The {{theory of}} continuity, {{with which we}} shall be {{occupied}} in the present lecture, is, in most of its refinements and developments, a purely mathematical subject--very beautiful, very important, and very delightful, but not, strictly speaking, a part of philosophy. The logical basis of the theory alone belongs to philosophy, and alone will occupy us to-night. The way the problem of continuity enters into philosophy is, broadly speaking, the following: Space and time are treated by mathematicians as consisting of points <b>and</b> <b>instants,</b> {{but they also have}} a property, easier to feel than to define, which is called continuity, and is thought by many philosophers to be destroyed when they are resolved into points <b>and</b> <b>instants.</b> Zeno, as we shall see, proved that analysis into points <b>and</b> <b>instants</b> was impossible if we adhered to the view that the number of points or instants in a finite space or time must be finite. Later philosophers, believing infinite number to be self-contradictory, have found here an antinomy: Spaces and times could not consist of a finite number of points <b>and</b> <b>instants,</b> for such reasons as Zeno's; they could not consist of an infinite number of points <b>and</b> <b>instants,</b> because infinite numbers were supposed to be self-contradictory. Therefore spaces and times, if real at all, must not be regarded as composed of points <b>and</b> <b>instants.</b>|$|R
60|$|But {{even when}} points <b>and</b> <b>instants,</b> as {{independent}} entities, are discarded, {{as they were}} by the theory advocated in our last lecture, the problems of continuity, as I shall try to show presently, remain, in a practically unchanged form. Let us therefore, to begin with, admit points <b>and</b> <b>instants,</b> <b>and</b> consider the problems {{in connection with this}} simpler or at least more familiar hypothesis.|$|R

Sushi, sashimi, <b>and</b> <b>instant</b> ramen are highly popular at {{opposite}} ends of the income scale, with instant ramen being a common low-budget meal. Sushi and sashimi takeout began in Vancouver and Toronto, and is now common throughout Canada. The largest supermarket chains all carry basic sushi and sashimi, and Japanese ingredients <b>and</b> <b>instant</b> ramen are readily available in most supermarkets.

60|$|The above brief outline {{must not}} be {{regarded}} as more than tentative and suggestive. It is intended merely to show the kind of way in which, given a world {{with the kind of}} properties that psychologists find in the world of sense, it may be possible, by means of purely logical constructions, to make it amenable to mathematical treatment by defining series or classes of sense-data which can be called respectively particles, points, <b>and</b> <b>instants.</b> If such constructions are possible, then mathematical physics is applicable to the real world, {{in spite of the fact}} that its particles, points, <b>and</b> <b>instants</b> are not to be found among actually existing entities.|$|R

25|$|Telegraphy {{requires}} that the method used for encoding the message be known to both sender and receiver. Many methods are designed according {{to the limits of}} the signalling medium used. The use of smoke signals, beacons, reflected light signals, and flag semaphore signals are early examples. In the 19th century, the harnessing of electricity led to the invention of electrical telegraphy. The advent of radio in the early 20th century brought about radiotelegraphy and other forms of wireless telegraphy. In the Internet age, telegraphic means developed greatly in sophistication and ease of use, with natural language interfaces that hide the underlying code, allowing such technologies as electronic mail <b>and</b> <b>instant</b> messaging.|$|E

25|$|Instead, {{scholars}} like Fish {{suggest that the}} humanities offer a unique kind of pleasure, a pleasure based on the common pursuit of knowledge (even if it is only disciplinary knowledge).
