40|$|Herein {{we report}} an {{efficient}} procedure to synthesize S- 4 -(3 -thienyl) phenyl-α-methylacetic acid, an enantiomerically pure intermediate of a recently approved nonsteroidal antiinflammatory cyclooxygenase inhibitor, <b>atliprofen</b> [methyl RS- 4 -(3 -thienyl) phenyl-α-methylacetate]. The interactions {{of the active}} S-isomer of the acid were theoretically {{compared with those of}} S-ibuprofen through molecular docking studies using COX- 1 and COX- 2 protein structures. The results were corroborated by in vitro and in vivo studies. An efficient process for the preparation of S- 4 -(3 -thienyl) phenyl-α-methylacetic acid, an enantiomerically pure intermediate of recently approved NSAID <b>atliprofen</b> is reported. The pharmacologically active isomer, S- 4 -(3 -thienyl) phenyl-α-methylacetic acid was compared with S-ibuprofen by docking studies on COX enzyme structures followed by biological evaluations...|$|E
