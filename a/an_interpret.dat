HREM images were used because they allow to select (by computer software) only the very thin regions {{close to the}} edge of the crystal for structure analysis (see also crystallographic image processing). This is of crucial importance since in the thicker parts of the crystal the exit-wave function (which carries the information about the intensity and position of the projected atom columns) is no longer linearly related to the projected crystal structure. Moreover, not only do the HREM images change their appearance with increasing crystal thickness, they are also very sensitive to the chosen setting of the defocus Δf of the objective lens (see the HREM images of [...] for example). To cope with this complexity Michael O'Keefe started in the early 1970s to develop image simulation software which allowed to understand <b>an</b> <b>interpret</b> the observed contrast changes in HREM images.|$|E

40|$|Concrete Poetry Translator’s Tasks. Methodological Prolegomena The paper {{focuses on}} the methodological {{approach}} {{to the problem of}} translating experimental poetry. The presented analysis is based on three texts: Julian Kornhauser’s Przekład jako objaśnienie (O tłumaczeniu poezji konkretnej) from 1983, Jerzy Jarniewicz’s Tłumacze na urlop! and Leszek Engelking’s Konkretne decyzje tłumacza, both from 2006. Each of these three articles includes a translative strategy towards the concrete poetry. The term, in narrow meaning, can be used to describe the worldwide movement founded simultaneously in Switzerland/Germany (by Eugen Gomringer), Sweden (by Őyvind Fahlstrőm) and in Brazil (by the Noigandres group – Haroldo and Augusto de Campos and Décio Pignatari) in the early 1950 s. The movement itself represents a form consisting of both verbal and visual elements and, in consequence, unites the distinctive marks of poetry and painting. With a vague status of a hybrid, as well as the experimental character, this specific genre is situated beyond the traditional categories of analysis and interpretation. Despite the confusion in terminology, though, there is fundamental requirement which the various kinds of concrete poetry meet: concentration upon the physical material from which the poem or text is made. Considered as an object, the concrete poem causes a fundamental problem in the frames of the translatology. The concrete poetry interpreters and researchers are disunited on the question of its translatabilty. Julian Kornhauser distinguishes the two major kinds of the concrete poem – a “poster-poem” and the “non-poster” one, the latter allowing or even requiring a translator’s intervention. The “poster-poem”, owing the complicated visual structure, cannot be translated. Jerzy Jarniewicz defines the entire concrete poetry as untranslatable, classifying it in the terms of the visual arts. Leszek Engleking presents a contrary view, which considers a translator as <b>an</b> <b>interpret</b> who promotes the experimental forms of poetry in the new literary context. The author of this paper attempts to put these methodological concepts into translation practice, examining the concrete poems of Eugen Gomringer, Friedrich Achleitner, Gerhard Rühm, Hansjörg Mayr and Jiří Kolář among others. While the most significant component of the concrete poem is language itself, treated predominantly as a graphic structure, the translation strategies can differ significantly. The analysis evokes its internal status, which appears to be miscellaneous from different perspectives, as it initiated an interdisciplinary genre by searching for new artistic horizons...|$|E
40|$|The existance of new {{hotel in}} Malang emerges a tight competition. Thus, every hotel shows its own {{distinctive}} feature wich can support to service. To get a special competitive quality service, each hotel management {{must be able}} to satisfy the customer. A lot of strategies is needed to applied continiously to the hotel management, especially hotel located in Malang, to improve the service quality. A hotel is service business which has a direct contact with it consumer, thus consumer satisfaction is an aim to achieve. A consumer who is satisfied and comfortable with the service is one of PR public on making a positive or good I,age to the company (Muslimin, 2004 : 91). Therefore if public relation officer wants to create a good image to the company, she or he needs to observe the quality of service in order to fulfil the consumer satisfaction. Perception is a process which we organize <b>an</b> <b>interpret</b> a stimulus pattern on environment (Atkinson 1983 : 225). The stimulus pattern on this research is the service quality from the hotel management. The organizer and interpreter are the consumer. While service quality is how far the difference between reality and expectationof customer for the achievement of service (Parasuraman, et. all, 1998 on Lupiyoadi, 2001 : 148). In this case, consumer perception about the service quality is how the consumer organize and interprete it which is served by the hotel service. There are 5 service quality elements which also the indication on this research. 1 st tangibles is the capability to show its existence to the public (external side) through the performance and capability of facility and infrastructure. 2 nd reliability is the capability to serve the consumer with committed service. 3 rd reponsiveness is the capability to serve precise and perceptive service to consumer needs. 4 th assurance is the capability perform hospitality and good manner of employee to convionce consumer trust and the last is empathy, the capability to make consumer as special individuals. Consumer satisfaction is a goal setting of hotel management. It refers to fulfilled exceeded customer expectation. This research uses survey method with quantitative approach. Besides, the research type is explanative research. Sampling technique uses quota-sampling technique, dan the sample used is 75 respondents from 568 population. To collect data, researcher uses questionnaire. While the data scaling used is Likert Scale. Simple linear regression analysis is used for analyzing data. From the research result, equation of Y = 12. 180 + 0. 0807 X is obtained, which is interpreted that Y (consumers’ satisfaction) will be rise 0. 087 units (to positive direction) for every one unit addition of X (perception on service quality). If there is no X variable, it means that Y value is 12. 180. So, if consumers’ perception on service quality rises toward positive, hence consumers are more satisfy on the given services. And it is also obtained 67. 6...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Teacher noticing is a {{necessary}} skill in order for teachers to elicit and respond to their students' mathematical ideas and support the ambitious learning goals of school mathematics. The purpose of this dissertation is to investigate what teacher candidates noticed about their teaching as they were provided supports and opportunities to develop skills with ambitious instruction during a mathematics teacher preparation program. Previous research on teacher noticing suggests that teacher candidates are challenged to notice student thinking and how instructional interactions unfold in a classroom. The focus {{of this study was}} to examine how teacher candidates' reflections attended to the interactions among the teacher's instruction, students' participation, and mathematical content within the instructional system. The research questions driving this study were: (1) What did teacher candidates most frequently notice when they analyzed their teaching? (2) What were the patterns of teacher candidates' noticing within and across four written reflections? and (3) How were the stances that teacher candidates took as they analyzed their teaching related to other noticing dimensions? Eleven teacher candidates enrolled in mathematics methods courses participated in the study. During the teacher education coursework, teacher candidates developed skills with ambitious teaching by working on four lessons, called instructional activities (IAs), organized around high leverage teaching practices. These practices provide equitable opportunities for students to engage in authentic tasks of the discipline. During the enactment of these activities with students, teacher candidates' classroom teaching was videotaped. After each enactment, teacher candidates watched the video recording of their classroom teaching and composed a reflection structured by a set of questions. The reflection questions guided them to analyze their use of high leverage teaching practices within the context of the instructional system and reflect on their successes and challenges in teaching ambitiously. Four reflections from each candidate were used as data sources for this study. Results from analyses of these written reflections reveal that teacher candidates frequently and consistently focused on the topic of the teacher's instruction than other topics across reflections. Teacher candidates more frequently and consistently used evidence in their reflections. Teacher candidates increased their attention to the interaction of the teacher, student, and content over time from reflections one to three. Also, their attention to the interaction of the teacher, student, and content was more consistent over time from reflections one to three. Similarly, teacher candidates' taking of <b>an</b> <b>interpret</b> stance increased and was more consistent from reflections one to three. In addition, when teacher candidates interpreted teaching, they tended to equally focus on the topics of teacher's instruction and students' participation. As they interpreted teaching, teacher candidates mostly included evidence and paid attention to the interaction of the teacher and student and the interaction of the teacher, student, and content. From syntheses of these results, I found that when teacher candidates analyzed teaching, they frequently and consistently noticed important moments in their instruction. They interpreted the teaching with the use of evidence to support their interpretation. Teacher candidates' noticing of classroom teaching increased the complexity over time. This was shown in the increasing of their attention to the interaction of the teacher, student, and content. Even though offer teaching alternative was reported as a stance with a positive relationship to teacher candidates' interpretation and attention to the interaction of teacher, student, and content, teacher candidates rarely attended to offering teaching alternative. These results and findings suggest the use of videotapes of IA enactments as a possible approach to supporting teacher candidates' learning to notice the interactions of instructional features. They also suggest the effectiveness of using prompts to guide teacher candidates to focus on the topic of teacher's instruction, use evidence, pay attention to the interactions instructional features, and interpret teaching. Importantly, they suggest the necessity of prompts guiding teacher candidates to offer teaching alternative. Additionally, the results and findings suggest the implications for future studies. Longitudinal studies could be conducted in order to explore the change and development of teacher candidates' noticing over time. The qualitative methods could be employed in order to get insights about what and how teacher candidates notice. A subset of teacher candidates in my study could be selected as a focus group to obtain more details about what and how they notice...|$|E
