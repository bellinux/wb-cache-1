2500|$|In 2003, New York City amended its smoke-free law {{to include}} {{virtually}} [...] all restaurants and bars, {{including those in}} private clubs, making it, along with the California smoke-free law, {{one of the toughest}} in the United States. The city's Department of Health found in a 2004 study that air pollution levels had decreased sixfold in bars and restaurants after the restrictions went into effect, and that New Yorkers had reported less second-hand smoke in the workplace. The study also found the city's restaurants and bars prospered despite the smoke-free law, with increases in jobs, liquor licenses, and business tax payments. The President of the New York nightlife <b>association</b> <b>remarked</b> <b>that</b> the study was not wholly representative, as by not differentiating between restaurants and nightclubs, the reform may have caused businesses like nightclubs and bars to suffer instead.

5000|$|In Thomas Hobbes's {{psychology}} much {{importance is}} assigned to what he called, variously, the succession, sequence, series, consequence, coherence, train of imaginations or thoughts in mental discourse. But not before David Hume is there express question as to what are the distinct principles of association. John Locke had, meanwhile, introduced the phrase [...] "association of ideas" [...] {{as the title of}} a supplementary chapter incorporated with the fourth edition of his Essay, though with little or no suggestion of its general psychological import. Hume reduced the principles of association to three: similarity, contiguity in time and place, and cause and/or effect. Dugald Stewart suggested resemblance, contrariety, and vicinity in time and place, though he added, as another obvious principle, accidental coincidence in the sounds of words, and further noted three other cases of relation: cause and effect, means and end, and premise and conclusion, as connecting trains of thought under circumstances of special attention. Thomas Reid, made light of <b>association,</b> <b>remarking</b> <b>that</b> it seems to require only the power of habit to explain the spontaneous recurrence of trains of thinking, which become familiar by frequent repetition (Intellectual Powers, p. 387).|$|R

30|$|Optimizing STA/AP {{associations}} {{has been}} investigated {{in a number of}} works. For example,[4] attempts to characterize the capacity region of multi-channel WLANs under different association policies. The authors conclude that the PHY rate and the load dependent throughput must be considered to achieve high performance.[3] presents a user-centric framework to select an AP and its operational channel. STAs exchange information with APs, which then periodically compute the optimal channel and <b>associations.</b> The authors <b>remark</b> <b>that</b> too frequent reoptimziation results in frequent reassociation which influences the user experience due to the hard breakdown in the reassociation process.[3] however does not aim to derive how often to reoptimize. For their simulations they reoptimize every 600 s, which seems to be very long in dynamic networks.[9] proposes a constant-factor approximation scheme for max-min fair bandwidth allocation in WLANs. For the online optimization of networks with STAs joining and leaving the authors adopt a Hysteresis approach.[2] applies an approach, in which a reoptimization is only performed when a time or a load threshold is exceeded.[1] proposes an NP-hard, non-linear optimization problem and heuristic solution algorithm for computing proportional fair AP association in multi-rate WLANs.[10] presents a MILP formulation of the STA/AP association problem and implements an optimization system adapting cell-breathing concepts known from cellular networks.[11 – 15] propose systems for controlling STA/AP associations using simple heuristics.[16] proposes a multi-objective optimization problem that tries to avoid unnecessary handovers. However, all those approaches do not consider the costs for handovers in their optimization models.|$|R

50|$|After Vivekananda's {{return from}} the West when Ramakrishna Mission was formed as <b>an</b> <b>Association</b> on 1 May 1897, at Baghbazar in Calcutta (now Kolkata) Vivekananda was elected its General President and Brahmananda was elected {{the first and only}} ever Calcutta President. After {{establishing}} the monastery at Belur, when Vivekananda got Ramakrishna Math registered as a Trust, Brahmananda became its President. He held this post till the end of his life. Vivekananda gave over the responsibility of running the organisation to Brahmananda, remembering that Ramakrishna had once <b>remarked</b> <b>that</b> Rakhal had the capacity to rule a kingdom. Thus, Brahmananda, the 'spiritual son' of Ramakrishna is generally said to be the first president of the order, though in truth Vivekananda was. Brahmananda's uncanny sense in solving even knotty problems and spiritual eminence took the organisation to new levels of development. It was a long stewardship marked by work and worship remarkably blended together. During his tenure as President, the order underwent great expansion, and several new branch centres were opened in India and abroad. The mission, which had been founded by Vivekananda as <b>an</b> <b>association,</b> was revived and registered during his time. His stress on contemplative life served to counterbalance the activities undertaken by the monks. During those difficult formative years he gave great stability to the Sangha. During his tenure as the head, he also guided many earnest spiritual seekers by taking them under his protection, thus fulfilling Vivekananda's prophetic <b>remark</b> <b>that</b> Brahmananda was veritably a spiritual dynamo.|$|R
