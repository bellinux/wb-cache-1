5|$|Leaves of Ficus obliqua {{serve as}} a food source for the larvae of the {{butterfly}} species the common crow (Euploea core), the no-brand crow (Euploea alcathoe), and the Geometer moth species Scopula epigypsa. The thrips species Gynaikothrips australis feeds {{on the underside of}} new leaves of F. obliqua, as well as F. rubiginosa and F. macrophylla. As plant cells die, nearby cells are induced into forming meristem tissue. A gall results and the leaves become distorted and curl over. The thrips remain in the galls at night <b>and</b> <b>wander</b> about in the daytime before returning in the evening, possibly to different galls about the tree. The thrips begin feeding when the tree has flushes of new growth, and the life cycle is around six weeks. At other times, thrips reside on old leaves without feeding or pupate sheltered in the bark.|$|E
5|$|Springbok {{are mainly}} active around dawn and dusk. Activity is {{influenced}} by weather; springbok can feed at night in hot weather, and at midday in colder months. They rest {{in the shade of}} trees or bushes, and often bed down in the open when weather is cooler. The social structure of the springbok {{is similar to that of}} Thomson's gazelle. Mixed-sex herds or harems have a roughly 3:1 sex ratio; bachelor individuals are also observed. In the mating season, males generally form herds <b>and</b> <b>wander</b> in search of mates. Females live with their offspring in herds, that very rarely include dominant males. Territorial males round up female herds that enter their territories and keep out the bachelors; mothers and juveniles may gather in nursery herds separate from harem and bachelor herds. After weaning, female juveniles stay with their mothers until the birth of their next calves, while males join bachelor groups.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} people counted in the census of 1381 was 59,873,305; however, this number dropped {{significantly}} when the government found that some 3 million people were missing from the tax census of 1391. Even though underreporting figures was made a capital crime in 1381, the need for survival pushed many to abandon the tax registration <b>and</b> <b>wander</b> from their region, where Hongwu had attempted to impose rigid immobility on the populace. The government tried to mitigate this by creating their own conservative estimate of 60,545,812 people in 1393. In his Studies on the Population of China, Ho Ping-ti suggests revising the 1393 census to 65 million people, noting that large areas of North China and frontier areas were not counted in that census. Brook states that the population figures gathered in the official censuses after 1393 ranged between 51 and 62 million, while the population was in fact increasing. Even the Hongzhi Emperor (r. 1487–505) remarked that the daily increase in subjects coincided with the daily dwindling amount of registered civilians and soldiers. William Atwell states that around 1400 the population of China was perhaps 90 million people, citing Heijdra and Mote.|$|E

25|$|Through 2010, Homestar Runner {{remained}} {{financially viable}} for the brothers through sales of related merchandise. Both brothers were married by 2010 and had {{their children to}} care for, and they recognized that {{they would need to}} find other jobs to support their respective families. When Matt had a second daughter, the two agreed to put the series on hiatus, knowing they would {{want to come back to}} it but could not guarantee a time frame. Mike also noted that they had spent nearly ten years delivering a weekly cartoon, and believed that, creatively, they needed a break. The success of Homestar Runner led to Matt and Mike getting writing jobs for television animated series Yo Gabba Gabba!, Gravity Falls, The Aquabats Super Show, <b>and</b> <b>Wander</b> Over Yonder.|$|E
25|$|Ronnie and Jack {{decide to}} move to Ongar, Essex, to Roxy's displeasure as Amy would be moving with them, though Ronnie then {{suggests}} that Roxy move to a nearby house in the same town. Roxy suspects that Jack and Honey are having an affair and tells Ronnie, who confronts Jack. He denies this and later, Roxy decides Amy should move without her and then asks Ronnie to adopt Amy. After an emotional discussion, Ronnie agrees but later the sisters secretly plan for Roxy to join the couple in Essex. However, on her wedding day, Roxy packs her things as she reveals she is moving away to live with Glenda and Danny, feeling as if she will ruin Ronnie's happiness. After an argument, Ronnie convinces Roxy to give her away, and she agrees. While {{on the way to}} the wedding, Ronnie and Roxy visit Phil for a final time and take a picture with him, unbeknownst to him that it'll be the last time he'll see them. At the wedding, Roxy begins to break down and says she cannot give Ronnie away and runs out. Ronnie is unable to face Jack and runs off in tears, later revealing she wishes Roxy to move with them and will not accept any other outcome. Jack eventually accepts and they marry after Roxy gives her away. Later, the two sisters get drunk after a happy day <b>and</b> <b>wander</b> outside the hotel; precariously perched on the hotel roof, still drinking champagne, they discuss their time in the square and the start of a new era. Ronnie and Roxy find the hotel swimming pool, and Roxy jumps in. Ronnie is unable to remove her wedding dress and sees Roxy motionless at the bottom of the pool. Ronnie jumps in to rescue her, but is weighed down by her wedding dress and drowns alongside her sister. The following morning, police find their bodies in the pool and inform Jack's brother Max Branning (Jake Wood), who then breaks the news to a devastated Jack. A few days later, Jack receives their wedding video and watches Ronnie saying how much she loves him, and is emotional watching it. Jack later visits her body in the chapel of rest a day before her and Roxy's funerals and says an emotional farewell to her. At the inquest into Ronnie and Roxy's deaths, their deaths are ruled as misadventure.|$|E

Bono was also inspired by the city's Berlin Zoologischer Garten railway station and {{used it as a}} metaphor for a reuniting Germany. [...] "Zoo Station" [...] was performed as the opening song at every concert on U2's Zoo TV Tour. The song received positive reviews from critics, many of whom analysed the song as a representation of the band's reinvention.|$|E
500|$|After its {{announcement}} at 2009's Electronic Entertainment Expo, Armada of the Damned was {{met with}} positive reactions from most video game journalists. Daemon Hatfield from IGN named it [...] "a promising action RPG," [...] elaborating that [...] "even though Armada of the Damned uses the Pirates of the Caribbean license... is its own game, an adventure that lets players create their own pirate <b>and</b> <b>wander</b> the seas of the Caribbean seeking fame and fortune." [...] Chris Antista from GamesRadar praised its gameplay, comparing it with Assassin’s Creed. He stated that [...] "the game has spectacularly preserved {{the spirit of the}} films, and they’ve done it without parasitically clinging to moments you’ve already seen on the big screen." ...|$|E
500|$|Puzzles {{in a given}} {{section of}} the island are {{presented}} in a non-linear fashion, and with the open world nature of the game, the player may encounter puzzle panels that {{they have yet to}} learn the symbolic language for. As such, players are not required to finish a puzzle once they start, and can leave <b>and</b> <b>wander</b> to any other area to solve the puzzles there, potentially gaining insight on the new symbolic language or inspiration for difficult solutions. Blow has stated that there is more to the game than these mazes, in response to concerns from players; to Blow, [...] "the point is the magic that happens in the player's mind when he understands the subtle things that the mazes are saying - because the mazes aren't just puzzles, they are lines of communication that aggregate, become more complex and eventually say surprising things".|$|E

500|$|As {{the wave}} of {{mutilation}} breaks over Europe, the force animating the monsters proves fatal: any contact with their bodies or blood provokes a frenzy of organic growth, so that {{animals of different species}} grow into each other and humans are strangled by their own growing organs. The populations remaining in the cities move underground. The ruling technocrats, led by Francis Delvil, begin to devise biological weapons to combat the monsters. Using the energy of the remaining tourmaline veils, they construct massive towers—the eponymous [...] "Giants"—out of humans, animals, and plants, grotesque assemblages of organic life that, planted on mountains or in the sea, serve as defensive turrets. In a frenzied technological mania, some of the scientists turn themselves into giant monsters <b>and</b> <b>wander</b> around Europe, wreaking havoc and forgetting their original intent. A group of the original Iceland expedition led by Kylin returns to Europe, bearing the memory of the devastation they caused.|$|E
500|$|In {{polygynous}} species, males {{will try}} to monopolize and mate with multiple females. As with monogamy, polygyny in rodents can come in two forms; defense and non-defense. Defense polygyny involves males controlling territories that contain resources that attract females. This occurs in ground squirrels like yellow-bellied marmots, California ground squirrels, Columbian ground squirrels and Richardson's ground squirrels. Males with territories are known as [...] "resident" [...] males and the females that live within the territories are known as [...] "resident" [...] females. In the case of marmots, resident males {{do not appear to}} ever lose their territories and always win encounters with invading males. Some species are also known to directly defend their resident females and the ensuing fights can lead to severe wounding. In species with non-defense polygyny, males are not territorial <b>and</b> <b>wander</b> widely in search of females to monopolize. These males establish dominance hierarchies, with the high-ranking males having access to the most females. This occurs in species like Belding's ground squirrels and some tree squirrel species.|$|E
500|$|In the Shiva Purana, the Bhagavata Purana, and the Vishnu Purana, the rakshasa disguises {{himself as}} a Brahmin cook and gains entry to the king's kitchen. When Vashishtha arrives in Ayodhya on the king's {{invitation}} for a Shraddha ceremony, or simply dinner, the demon cooks human flesh and offers that to the sage {{on behalf of the}} king. The enraged sage curses him to be transformed into a human-eating rakshasa <b>and</b> <b>wander</b> the forests. The pious king is outraged by the unjust curse and quarrels with the sage. Vashishtha reduces the curse to 12 years when he hears of the rakshasa's deception. But the king is not satisfied. He takes water in his hand to cast a curse on Vashishtha, but the queen dissuades him. However, the curse-ridden water cannot be wasted. If thrown on the ground, it will destroy the crop. If thrown in the air, it will spoil the rains. Throwing in any direction would harm some living beings. Ultimately, the king throws the water on his own feet. Since the king's feet become black and white in colour, he gains the epithets Kalmashapada and Kalmasanghri (literally, [...] "pied feet").|$|E

2500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for the album began at Island Records' newly opened Basing Street Studios, London, {{at the same}} time as Jethro Tull's Aqualung in December 1970. Upon the recommendation of Fleetwood Mac, the band then moved to Headley Grange, a remote Victorian Estate house in East Hampshire, England, to conduct additional recordings. Here they used the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio. Jimmy Page later recalled: [...] "We needed the sort of facilities where we could have a cup of tea <b>and</b> <b>wander</b> around the garden and go in and do what we had to do." [...] This relaxed, atmospheric environment at Headley Grange also provided other advantages for the band.
