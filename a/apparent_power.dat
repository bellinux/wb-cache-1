5|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, Ramírez Treviño {{was a close}} {{associate}} of Jaime González Durán (El Hummer), a founder and top leader of Los Zetas drug cartel. In 2008, González Durán was arrested and sentenced to 35 years in prison; by 2010, Los Zetas, who were working as the armed wing of the Gulf Cartel, separated from the organization to operate independently. Both criminal organizations went to war with each other, but Ramírez Treviño remained in the Gulf Cartel. Under the tutelage of Samuel Flores Borrego (El Metro 3), he worked as the second-in-command for the criminal organization in Reynosa, Tamaulipas. In an <b>apparent</b> <b>power</b> struggle within the Gulf Cartel, however, El Metro 3 was killed, and he became the regional kingpin in September 2011.|$|E
5|$|The {{state of}} Tamaulipas {{is home to}} two {{transnational}} criminal organizations – the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas – who fight {{for control of the}} smuggling routes along the Texan border. This border area is a major route for human trafficking, arms smuggling, and for the international narcotics trade. The Gulf Cartel, according to the United States Department of State, started in the 1930s as a bootlegging gang and later transformed into a full-fledged drug trafficking organization in the 1980s. Los Zetas, on the other hand, were formed in the late 1990s and early 2000s by former soldiers of the Mexican Army who were hired by the imprisoned Osiel Cárdenas Guillén to become the Gulf Cartel's new muscle. In an <b>apparent</b> <b>power</b> struggle, however, Los Zetas and the Gulf Cartel broke relations in early 2010 and went to war in the state of Tamaulipas and its bordering states, prompting daily shootouts, kidnappings, and mass slayings.|$|E
25|$|For example, to get 1kW of real power, if {{the power}} factor is unity, 1kVA of <b>apparent</b> <b>power</b> {{needs to be}} {{transferred}} (1kW ÷ 1 = 1kVA). At low values of power factor, more <b>apparent</b> <b>power</b> needs {{to be transferred to}} get the same real power. To get 1kW of real power at 0.2 power factor, 5kVA of <b>apparent</b> <b>power</b> needs to be transferred (1kW ÷ 0.2 = 5kVA). This <b>apparent</b> <b>power</b> must be produced and transmitted to the load, and is subject to the losses in the production and transmission processes.|$|E
5000|$|The {{power plant}} has six {{vertical}} Francis turbines, with a nominal power of [...] each, which rotate at 88 rpm. The <b>apparent</b> <b>powers</b> are of 200 MVA for each generator, and 180 MVA for each transformer.|$|R
5000|$|The Cobweb is a {{comic book}} heroine co-created by famed writer Alan Moore and veteran {{underground}} artist Melinda Gebbie. Cobweb's only <b>apparent</b> <b>powers</b> were allure {{and the ability to}} make an entrance. The Cobweb first appeared in the premier issue of Tomorrow Stories, an anthology title in the America's Best Comics line.|$|R
60|$|Like all {{the rest}} {{he had taken a}} theme that was far beyond his <b>apparent</b> <b>powers,</b> and the <b>apparent</b> {{comprehension}} of his audience; but they had been fed so long upon William Tell, Rienzi, Marc Antony and Spartacus, that every line was familiar. Nothing was too ponderous, too lofty, too peak-addressing for them.|$|R
25|$|The {{power factor}} {{is defined as}} the ratio of real power to <b>apparent</b> <b>power.</b> As power is {{transferred}} along a transmission line, it does not consist purely of real power that can do work once transferred to the load, but rather consists of a combination of real and reactive power, called <b>apparent</b> <b>power.</b> The power factor describes the amount of real power transmitted along a transmission line relative to the total <b>apparent</b> <b>power</b> flowing in the line.|$|E
25|$|Electrical loads {{consuming}} {{alternating current}} power consume both real power and reactive power. The vector sum of real and reactive {{power is the}} <b>apparent</b> <b>power.</b> The presence of reactive power causes the real power {{to be less than}} the <b>apparent</b> <b>power,</b> and so, the electric load has a power factor of less than 1.|$|E
25|$|As {{the power}} factor decreases, {{the ratio of}} real power to <b>apparent</b> <b>power</b> also decreases, as the angle θ {{increases}} and reactive power increases.|$|E
50|$|Golden Boy was {{a public}} {{relations}} tool and having no <b>apparent</b> <b>powers,</b> he {{was more of a}} liability than an aid to Titan. On Golden Boy's first solo mission he was captured and tortured, resulting in the loss of an eye. Grace then retired the boy, having his mind erased by her aide Madison.|$|R

25|$|In {{electrical}} engineering, {{the power}} factor of an AC {{electrical power system}} {{is defined as the}} ratio of the real power flowing to the load to the <b>apparent</b> <b>power</b> in the circuit, and is a dimensionless number in the closed interval of −1 to 1. A power factor of less than one means that the voltage and current waveforms are not in phase, reducing the instantaneous product of the two waveforms (V × I). Real power is the capacity of the circuit for performing work in a particular time. <b>Apparent</b> <b>power</b> is the product of the current and voltage of the circuit. Due to energy stored in the load and returned to the source, or due to a non-linear load that distorts the wave shape of the current drawn from the source, the <b>apparent</b> <b>power</b> will be greater than the real power. A negative power factor occurs when the device (which is normally the load) generates power, which then flows back towards the source, which is normally considered the generator.|$|E
25|$|Also in 2002, after Warren Jeffs assumed leadership, Winston Blackmore, who {{had been}} serving in Canada as the Bishop of Bountiful for the FLDS Church, was excommunicated by Jeffs in an <b>apparent</b> <b>power</b> struggle. This led to a split within the {{community}} in Bountiful, British Columbia, with an estimated 700 FLDS members leaving the church to follow Blackmore.|$|E
25|$|Since an RMS value can be {{calculated}} for any waveform, <b>apparent</b> <b>power</b> can {{be calculated}} from this. For active power it would at first appear {{that we would have}} to calculate many product terms and average all of them. However, if we look at one of these product terms in more detail we come to a very interesting result.|$|E
50|$|While Scarlet {{does not}} have any <b>apparent</b> <b>powers,</b> she {{possesses}} a mysterious psychic bond with Moon Knight. This psychic bond is not systematic. It appears when Stained Glass Scarlet concentrates on Moon Knight, and can manifest in the form of dreams during which their thoughts intermingle and allow them to briefly communicate. This bond between Stained Glass Scarlet and Moon Knight could be due to an entity close to the Egyptian god of the moon, Khonshu, and reincarnated as Stained Glass Scarlet.|$|R
5000|$|The game {{consists}} of the user playing as the eponymous Fatman, superhero protector of Shadowlawn, investigating an explosion at the ACNE chemical plant, and how exactly the CEO of Mary & Kate cosmetics was involved. The villain {{of the game is}} Toxicman, a mutated thug who has no <b>apparent</b> <b>powers.</b> The game features over 30 locations, and over 20 characters with 1,000 fully recorded lines of dialog, with an original soundtrack featuring over 50 tracks. The game also enables you to listen to an [...] "Audio Commentary" [...] while playing, for every location.|$|R
50|$|When {{exposed to}} sunlight, {{artificial}} light, or infrared radiation (even {{the heat of}} a hand nearby can be enough), the vanes turn with no <b>apparent</b> motive <b>power,</b> the dark sides retreating from the radiation source and the light sides advancing.|$|R
25|$|In the diagram, P is {{the active}} power, Q is the {{reactive}} power (in this case positive), S is the complex {{power and the}} length of S is the <b>apparent</b> <b>power.</b> Reactive power does not do any work, so it is represented as the imaginary axis of the vector diagram. Active power does do work, so it is the real axis.|$|E
25|$|A typical {{multimeter}} {{will give}} incorrect results {{when attempting to}} measure the AC current in a non-sinusoidal waveform; the instruments sense the average value of the rectified waveform. The average response is then calibrated to the effective RMS value. An RMS sensing multimeter must be {{used to measure the}} actual RMS currents and voltages (and therefore <b>apparent</b> <b>power).</b> To measure the real power or reactive power, a wattmeter designed to work properly with non-sinusoidal currents must be used.|$|E
25|$|At 21.4cm × 16.2cm {{the work}} is a greatly reduced {{miniature}} portrait. Blake generally worked on a small scale; most of his illuminated pages, engravings {{and many of his}} paintings are only inches high. Although Ghost of a Flea is one of Blake's smallest works, it is monumental in its imagination. Its tiny scale achieves drama in contrasting the muscular bulk and <b>apparent</b> <b>power</b> of the creature against its incarnation in the panel as an insect.|$|E
5000|$|Red Hulk assembles his {{incarnation}} of the Thunderbolts to be a strike team that is close to [...] "Code Red." [...] He has gathered Deadpool, Elektra, Punisher, and Agent Venom because [...] "their conditions cannot be cured." [...] Red Hulk has his Thunderbolts {{do things that are}} similar to X-Force. Red Hulk has obtained Samuel Sterns' body and hooks it up to a machine that emits Red Gamma Radiation onto Samuel Sterns. Deadpool later finds Samuel Sterns' as a Red Leader with no <b>apparent</b> <b>powers</b> as he expresses his view that the Punisher won't be pleased. Punisher finds Red Leader's body and shoots him between the eyes disrupting whatever plans Red Hulk has for Red Leader.|$|R
5000|$|Musimu began {{diving in}} 1999 {{at the age}} of 28, {{intrigued}} by what he called [...] "dolphin-men". His secret lay in years and years of training and preparation, but special attention should be given to his ear clearing technique: instead of equalizing his ears by the regular maneuvers, he flooded his air spaces (sinus and middle ears) with seawater before reaching the depth where ordinary equalization would become hard. He had a lung capacity of 9 litres and could hold his breath for more than 8 min 33 sec. In Stan Lee's Superhumans, a show on the History Channel, Musimu claimed meditation and yoga to be the reason behind his <b>apparent</b> <b>powers</b> of holding breath.|$|R

25|$|Power Quality Analyzers, often {{referred}} to as Power Analyzers, make a digital recording of the voltage and current waveform (typically either one phase or three phase) and accurately calculate true power (watts), <b>apparent</b> <b>power</b> (VA) power factor, AC voltage, AC current, DC voltage, DC current, frequency, IEC61000-3-2/3-12 Harmonic measurement, IEC61000-3-3/3-11 flicker measurement, individual phase voltages in delta applications where there is no neutral line, total harmonic distortion, phase and amplitude of individual voltage or current harmonics, etc.|$|E
25|$|Incandescent lamps {{are nearly}} pure {{resistive}} loads {{with a power}} factor of 1. This means the actual power consumed (in watts) and the <b>apparent</b> <b>power</b> (in volt-amperes) are equal. Incandescent light bulbs are usually marketed according to the electrical power consumed. This is measured in watts and depends mainly on {{the resistance of the}} filament, which in turn depends mainly on the filament's length, thickness, and material. For two bulbs of the same voltage, type, color, and clarity, the higher-powered bulb gives more light.|$|E
25|$|A {{high power}} factor is {{generally}} desirable in a power delivery system to reduce losses and improve voltage regulation at the load. Compensating elements near an electrical load will reduce the <b>apparent</b> <b>power</b> demand on the supply system. Power factor correction may be applied by an electric power transmission utility to improve the stability and efficiency of the network. Individual electrical customers who are charged by their utility for low power factor may install correction equipment to increase their power factor so as to reduce costs.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the reasons}} for the {{widespread}} press coverage of the incident, particularly in South Korea, is that it illustrates the <b>apparent</b> widespread <b>power</b> (and abuse of it) held by the members of South Korean family businesses (chaebols). Passenger rates on Korean Air domestic flights dropped 6.6% in December 2014, compared to the previous year.|$|R
25|$|When {{households}} are not charged for the reactive power they consume {{there is almost}} no monetary incentive for them to install power factor correction equipment. This is generally the case today, as household electric meters do not measure <b>apparent</b> <b>power</b> but only real power. Adding power factor correction merely affects the reactive power supplied or drawn and not real power, so utility costs are unaffected. However if there are high-resistance lines connected between the utility meter and a relatively high load then the power as measured by the meter can be reduced by a small amount with power factor correction. Any such savings are usually insignificant.|$|E
25|$|Power factors below 1.0 {{require a}} utility to {{generate}} more than the minimum volt-amperes necessary to supply the real power (watts). This increases generation and transmission costs. For example, if the load power factor were as low as 0.7, the <b>apparent</b> <b>power</b> would be 1.4 times the real power used by the load. Line current in the circuit would also be 1.4 times the current required at 1.0 power factor, so the losses in the circuit would be doubled (since they are proportional to {{the square of the}} current). Alternatively all components of the system such as generators, conductors, transformers, and switchgear would be increased in size (and cost) to carry the extra current.|$|E
25|$|Energy {{stored in}} {{capacitive}} or inductive {{elements of the}} network give rise to reactive power flow. Reactive power flow strongly influences the voltage levels across the network. Voltage levels and reactive power flow must be carefully controlled to allow a power system to be operated within acceptable limits. A technique known as reactive compensation is used to reduce <b>apparent</b> <b>power</b> flow to a load by reducing reactive power supplied from transmission lines and providing it locally. For example, to compensate an inductive load a shunt capacitor is installed close to the load itself. This allows all reactive power needed by the load to be supplied by the capacitor {{and not have to}} be transferred over the transmission lines. This practice alone does not save energy in a direct way, because reactive power does no work. But because the reactive component of the current is now only flowing locally, it is producing heat only in the local conductors and thus saving total energy.|$|E
50|$|Even {{if there}} is a direct line of sight between the {{transmitting}} and receiving antenna, reflections from objects near the path of the signal can decrease <b>apparent</b> signal <b>power</b> through phase cancellations. Whether and how much signal is lost from a reflection is determined by the location of the object in the Fresnel zone of the antennas.|$|R
50|$|An {{instrument}} {{which measures}} electrical energy in watt hours (electricity meter or energy analyser) {{is essentially a}} wattmeter which accumulates or averages readings. Digital electronic instruments measure many parameters {{and can be used}} where a wattmeter is needed: volts, current,in amperes, <b>apparent</b> instantaneous <b>power,</b> actual power, power factor, energy in kW·h over a period of time, and cost of electricity consumed.|$|R
