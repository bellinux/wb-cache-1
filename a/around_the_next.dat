Bears reach sexual maturity {{shortly after they}} disperse; at around 3–6 years depending on the species. Male Alaskan brown bears and polar bears may continue to grow until they are 11 years old. Lifespan may also vary between species. The brown bear can live an average of 25 years.|$|E
5|$|The Norman invaders of the 11th century {{took the}} city without resistance, {{and by the}} 12th century the walls were ill-maintained and of little {{military}} value. Fears of a French invasion during the Hundred Years' War led to an enquiry into Canterbury's defences in 1363. The decision was taken to restore the city walls and for <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> thirty years the old Roman defences were freshly rebuilt in stone, incorporating the older walls where they still remained. 24 towers were constructed around the circuit, and over the coming years many of the gatehouses were rebuilt in stone and brick, defended {{by some of the}} first batteries of guns in England. Parts of the wall were deliberately damaged by Parliament during the English Civil War of the 17th century and the doors to the city's gates burnt; with the restoration of Charles II in 1660, new doors were reinstalled.|$|E

Out of the greater part of the territory, three separate nations would be formed through the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, namely Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia. Lastly and equally important, as a result of Russia's imposing of the two treaties, it also decisively parted the Azerbaijanis and Talysh ever since between the two nations.|$|E
25|$|Later that year, Ginger Baker {{and a host}} {{of former}} Bruce band colleagues joined him for two special 50th birthdays concerts in Cologne, Germany, hosted by the TV show Rockpalast. Selections from these were {{released}} as the live double CD Cities of the Heart, and much later as the DVD set Rockpalast: The 50th Birthdays Concerts. One special guest was the Irish blues-rock guitarist Gary Moore, who joined Bruce and Baker for a set of Cream classics. Inspired by this performance, the three formed the power trio BBM and their subsequent (and only) album, <b>Around</b> <b>the</b> <b>Next</b> Dream, was a top ten hit in the UK. However, the old Bruce/Baker arguments arose again and the subsequent tour was cut short and the band broke up. A low-key solo album, Monkjack, followed in 1995, featuring Bruce on piano and vocals, accompanied only by Funkadelic organist Bernie Worrell.|$|E

500|$|On July 5, Davis {{was sent}} back down {{to make room for}} Josh Hamilton who was coming off the {{disabled}} list. Although he had 15 home runs in 258 at bats, he was leading the American League with 114 strikeouts and had, on June 21, become the quickest player in Major League history to reach 100 strikeouts, requiring only 219 at bats. His batting average was at [...]202. While talking about the Rangers' handling of another player, Julio Borbon, in 2010, Washington mentioned the decision to send Davis down in 2009: [...] "We gave Chris a good amount of time last year. With young players, they can look bad for 100 at bats and then turn it <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> 100 and look exactly like you want them to."

500|$|In contrast, reviewers from GamesRadar and Computer and Video Games {{appreciated}} the linear nature; the former stated that [...] "the streamlined, focused structure eliminates potential tedium without dumbing anything down", {{while the latter}} felt it was [...] "a clever move", and kept the player from being [...] " [...] down with mundane number crunching, [...] finicky and repetitive leveling-up." [...] Many negatively noted the gradual unfurling of the player's abilities over this {{first part of the}} game, from battle gameplay to selecting the party leader. Combined with the game's linear nature, some reviews went as far as to describe these chapters as [...] "boring" [...] until the world of Gran Pulse was revealed. Edge noted that while it did not do enough {{to make up for the}} opening chapters, at Gran Pulse the game [...] "hits a sweet spot" [...] as the narrative offers [...] "hunting side-quests and the simple joy of exploring to see what visual marvel is <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> corner." ...|$|E
500|$|With Achtung Baby, {{the group}} sought to recover {{some of the}} Dadaist {{characters}} and stage antics they had dabbled with in the late 1970s as teenagers. U2 had abandoned these ideas for more literal themes in the 1980s. However, for the new album, the band was interested in no longer making obvious sense. Accordingly, the lyrics for [...] "Zoo Station" [...] were inspired by the surrealism of a story about Berlin during World War II that Bono heard. Animals escaped the city's zoo after it was damaged in overnight bombing, and as a result, rhinoceroses, pelicans and flamingoes wandered <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> morning while people were sifting through the rubble. Bono was also inspired by Berlin Zoologischer Garten railway station, also known as [...] "Zoo station", previously the main railway station in West Berlin. The station was notorious as a haunt for drug dealers, prostitutes and pimps, pick-pockets and transients, particularly prior to German reunification, when it was run by the East German railway. He compared the song to the station, saying [...] "it was written as an opening track, the beasts breaking out of their cages", and was interested in using the zoo as a metaphor and he took further inspiration from the subway station representing Europe at a crossroads.|$|E

500|$|A cruiser {{reported}} aircraft {{detected by}} R.D.F {{on the port}} bow of the convoy and Ledbury was taken through the convoy {{to get to the}} engaged side; but a heavy and sustained attack by Junkers 88s dive bombing developed when the destroyer was still in between the two columns. The attack became increasingly indefensible; two ships were hit, one exploded, the other remained afloat but both were creating a huge mass of burning petrol on the water. Torpedo planes were now sighted on the starboard bow very close, but the light was failing quickly. Ledbury engaged the torpedo planes, but one delivered a very good attack, dropping two torpedoes. Another ship exploded, and Captain Hill assumed that [...] was torpedoed at this time. Ledbury called Manchester to make sure that she was standing by the damaged ships; the destroyer sighted six ships out in the darkness steaming on various courses, mostly in a north or north-western direction.

Ledbury then returned to Ohio intending to take her in tow, but the tanker reported that she could steam with her steering aft but had no compass. The destroyer switched on a brighter stern light and told the tanker to follow her to Malta. Ledbury informed stragglers of the presence of a minefield near Zembra, while she also contacted [...] that the survivors from the damaged ships had not been picked up and that she was going on with the tanker. It seemed to the crew that a very long time had passed before the ships were clear of the glare of the burning ships.

2500|$|Metal Gear Solid 2 {{carries the}} {{subtitle}} of [...] "Tactical Espionage Action", {{and most of}} the game involves the protagonist sneaking around avoiding being seen by the enemies. Most fundamental are the wider range of skills offered to the player. The first-person aiming mode allows players to target specific points in the game, greatly expanding tactical options; guards can be blinded by steam, distracted by a flying piece of fruit or hit in weak spots. Players can walk slowly, allowing them to sneak over noisy flooring without making a sound, or hang off walkways to slip past below guards' feet. The corner-press move from Metal Gear Solid, which allowed players a sneak peek <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> bend is expanded to allow players to fire from cover. Other abilities included leaping over and hanging off of railings, opening and hiding in storage lockers, and sneaking up behind enemies to hold them at gunpoint for items and ammunition. Players are able to shoot out the enemy's radio so they are unable to communicate with others on their team. [...] The environment also has a greater impact on the stealth gameplay, taking into account factors such as weather, smell, atmosphere and temperature.|$|E
