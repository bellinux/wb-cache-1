25|$|A legendary blood fighter, {{considered}} a , {{founder of the}} Big Dipper style blood technique and the master of Zapp & Zed. It is not known if he is alien or human, as he lost most of his body during blood training, being only <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> barely visible face under a tattered robe & a wild boar skull. With a biting personality and brutal discipline of training, he and Zapp stood on acrimonious terms. Known for disappearing for decades {{at a time and}} taking down high-ranked Blood Breeds, he comes to Hellsalem's Lot while fighting the Blood Breed Herlelle Lucando Lozo Thietkaua gi Murmhavat, along the way testing Zapp and leaving Zed at the hands of Libra, before a sudden disappearance.|$|E

While Bond and Leiter are scouting one of Mr Big's warehouses used for storing exotic fish, Solitaire is kidnapped by Mr Big's minions. Leiter later {{returns to the}} warehouse by himself, but is either captured and fed to a shark or tricked into standing on a trap door over the shark tank through which he falls; he survives, but loses <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> leg. Bond finds him in their safe house with a note pinned to his chest [...] "He disagreed with something that ate him". Bond then investigates the warehouse himself and discovers that Mr Big is smuggling gold [...] coins by hiding them {{in the bottom of}} fish tanks holding poisonous tropical fish, which he is bringing into the US. He is attacked in the warehouse by [...] "the Robber", Mr Big's gunman, and in the resultant gunfight Bond outwits the Robber and causes him to fall into the shark tank.|$|E

500|$|While {{the editor}} of Personal Computer World was on holiday in May 1981, his colleagues publicised the magazine's review of the ZX81 with a cover showing a {{chimpanzee}} with the machine above the strapline [...] "Editor benchtests the ZX81". (The chimp returned in later issues to [...] "benchtest" [...] all of Sinclair's subsequent computers.) The review, which was written by PCW staffer Dave Tebbutt, acknowledged that the machine had significant shortcomings but nonetheless represented [...] "absolutely amazing value for money". He described the ZX81 as [...] "a lovely product which will have enormous appeal to people wanting {{to find out more}} about computers, but without it costing them <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> leg" [...] and concluded: [...] "If you know nothing about computers and you want to enjoy finding out about them, then this machine offers a value for money way of doing just that. Children will love the ZX81, there can be no question about that, and I suspect that more than a few people who are already familiar with computers will buy one, just to have a bit of fun." ...|$|E
500|$|Fleming {{builds the}} main {{character}} in Live and Let Die to make Bond come across as more human than in Casino Royale, becoming [...] "a much warmer, more likeable man from the opening chapter", according to the American novelist Raymond Benson, who between 1997 and 2002 wrote a series of Bond novels and short stories. Savoye sees {{the introduction of a}} vulnerable side to Bond, identifying the agent's tears {{towards the end of the}} story as evidence of this. Similarly, over the course of the book, the American character Leiter develops and also emerges as a more complete and human character and his and Bond's friendship is evident in the story. Despite the relationship, Leiter is again subordinate to Bond. While in Casino Royale his role was to provide technical support and money to Bond, in Live and Let Die the character is secondary to Bond, and the only time he takes the initiative, he loses <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> leg, while Bond wins his own battle with the same opponent. Although Fleming had initially intended to kill Leiter off in the story, his American literary agent protested, and the character was saved.|$|E

2500|$|The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) defined this {{classification}} for para-Alpine as competitors typically having [...] "one upper-limb and one lower-limb amputation skiing {{with the}} equipment of their choice." [...] This classification has two subclasses, LW9.1 and LW9.2. In July 1997, at the World Cup Technical Meeting for para-Alpine skiing, this class was subdivided into two classes {{in order to improve}} factoring for the range of disabilities found within the class at the time. In 2002, the Australian Paralympic Committee described this classification as a standing skiing classification with [...] "Two skis, two poles, combination of disability in <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> leg." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} was subsequently killed off, dying {{in her sleep}} in July 1988 after being frequently ill throughout the year. The character's final episodes were written by Tony Holland and directed by Julia Smith. Lou spent her final day arranging her affairs, seeing various members of her family, passing on advice and giving them presents {{and at the end}} of the episode she announced: [...] "That's you lot sorted. I can go now." [...] At the start of episode 359, Lou was found to have died peacefully in her sleep. The episode then jumped a few days later to the day of her funeral — an emotional episode, which featured Pete breaking down at Lou's graveside and ended with him proposing a toast in the Vic to absent friends and that [...] "bloody old bag." [...] The episode was also notable for featuring, for the first time, a train crossing the railway viaduct in Bridge Street — a special-effects shot commissioned especially for the occasion. The train was actually a ten-second illusion, produced by the BBC's electronic workshop. One EastEnders official commented: [...] "It cost <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> leg, but old Lou was worth it." ...|$|E

50|$|Another {{variant of}} the multi-armed bandit problem is called the {{adversarial}} bandit, first introduced by Auer and Cesa-Bianchi (1998). In this variant, at each iteration <b>an</b> agent chooses <b>an</b> <b>arm</b> <b>and</b> <b>an</b> adversary simultaneously chooses the payoff structure for each arm. This {{is one of the}} strongest generalizations of the bandit problem as it removes all assumptions of the distribution <b>and</b> <b>a</b> solution to the adversarial bandit problem is a generalized solution to the more specific bandit problems.|$|R
