5|$|The 100-Mile Diet: A Year of Local Eating (or Plenty: One Man, One Woman, and <b>a</b> <b>Raucous</b> Year of Eating Locally) is a non-fiction {{book written}} by Canadian writers Alisa Smith and J.B. MacKinnon. In the book, the authors recount their experiences, {{including}} motivations and challenges, on restricting their diet, for one year, to include only foods grown within 100 miles of their residence. Beginning in March 2005, with little preparation the urban couple began only purchasing foods with ingredients they knew were all from within 100 miles. Finding little in grocery stores, {{they relied on}} farmers' markets and visits to local farms. Staples in their diet included seafood, chicken, root vegetable, berries, and corn. They lacked cooking oils, rice, and sugar. They preserved foods {{for use in the}} winter but ended with extra supplies.|$|E

5|$|Heavy metal is {{characterized}} by aggressive, driving rhythms, amplified and distorted guitars, grandiose lyrics, and virtuosic instrumentation. Heavy metal's origins lie in the hard rock bands who took blues and rock and created a heavy sound built on guitar and drums. Most of the pioneers in the field were British; the first major American bands came in the early 1970s, like Blue Öyster Cult, KISS, and Aerosmith. Heavy metal remained, however, a largely underground phenomenon. During the 1980s the first major pop-metal style arose and dominated the charts for several years kicked off by metal act Quiet Riot and dominated by bands such as Mötley Crüe and Ratt; this was glam metal, a hard rock and pop fusion with <b>a</b> <b>raucous</b> spirit and a glam-influenced visual aesthetic. Some of these bands, like Bon Jovi, became international stars. The band Guns N' Roses rose to fame {{near the end of}} the decade with an image that was a reaction against the glam metal aesthetic.|$|E

5|$|Hermética was a thrash metal band, drawing {{influences}} from Motörhead, Megadeth, and Black Sabbath. Their {{music was}} composed primarily by bassist Ricardo Iorio with occasional input from guitarist Antonio Romano, who composed the guitar solos. The band used a counterpoint between the singing styles {{of their two}} vocalists; lead singer Claudio O'Connor's vocals were high pitched, while Iorio had <b>a</b> <b>raucous</b> style of singing. Iorio sang segments of some songs but rarely performed songs in their entirety. Iorio thought that his singing style in Hermética was inferior to his later work with Almafuerte because the songs had not been composed specifically for him. The success of Hermética's second studio album Ácido Argentino allowed the band to increase the budget {{for the production of}} its follow-up, Víctimas del Vaciamiento. Iorio proposed re-recording the band's first album with drummer Claudio Strunz and a higher budget, but the label refused his proposal.|$|E

25|$|For {{most of its}} history, Airdrieonians {{played at}} Broomfield Park, which was opened in 1892. The ground was located in a hollow in Airdrie town centre. The Broomfield pitch was very narrow, at just 67 yards wide. These {{physical}} features and {{the proximity of the}} stands to the pitch meant that Broomfield had <b>a</b> <b>raucous</b> atmosphere, which visiting clubs disliked. Broomfield was known for its distinctive corner pavilion, which was built in 1907. After winning the 1923–24 Scottish Cup, the club built a main stand, adjacent to the pavilion.|$|E
25|$|Hopes and {{expectations}} for the 1939–40 team were high, as {{all but one of}} the key players returned from the previous season's SWC champion and NCAA Tournament squad. Texas opened the season with seven wins by an average of 18 points (and by no fewer than 11), including two wins over the Texas Tech Red Raiders in a home series that marked the first meetings between the two schools in basketball. Gray was intent both upon raising national recognition of the program and upon toughening his team in the early part of the season for the conference slate ahead, and to both ends he sought to involve the Longhorns in intersectional competition against prominent teams in high-profile venues across the country. Ned Irish, director of Madison Square Garden and a pioneer in the promotion of college basketball in the 1930s, had invited Gray's Longhorns to play Manhattan College as part of a doubleheader that included Southern California and Long Island University. The UT Athletic Council agreed to fund the team's trip to New York for the contest, followed by a stop in Philadelphia to play Temple. In front of 18,425 fans, the Longhorns overwhelmed Manhattan by a score of 54–32, earning the praise of the New York sports media and basketball fans for their speed and the accuracy of their one-handed shooting, which Gray had popularized as a player and continued teaching as a coach. Continuing on to Philadelphia, Texas fell 47–37 to Temple, winners of the first National Invitation Tournament two years prior. Having lost one of two road contests against Arkansas and a road game against SMU in overtime, Texas entered the penultimate game of the season at 18–3 and tied at 8–2 in conference play with the preseason conference favorite Rice Owls—a team that the Longhorns had defeated on Rice's home court earlier in the season, 50–46. In front of <b>a</b> <b>raucous</b> pro-Texas crowd of more than 8,000 fans packed into Gregory Gymnasium, the Longhorns suffered a heartbreaking one-point loss to the Owls, 42–41, to see their hopes of winning a second consecutive outright SWC championship dashed and their chances of even sharing the championship greatly diminished. Another painful defeat followed in the final game of the season, as the Longhorns fell to a 10–11 Texas A team in College Station, 53–52, on a long running shot from the Aggies' backup center in the final seconds. Texas finished 18–5 with no invitation to a postseason tournament. The Premo-Porretta Power Poll retroactively assigned the 1939–40 Longhorn team a national ranking of No. 17.|$|E
