5|$|This coup {{was soon}} {{followed}} {{by his first}} world title in 1942. Over the following three decades, Crane won almost two dozen major championships, including the World Crown in 1946, 1955, 1966, 1968, 1970 and 1972, the Ballantine International Championship in 1965, the International Roundrobin championship in 1968, and the World Series of Billiards in 1978 at age 65. Of these triumphs, his win at the 1966 World Crown is the most celebrated. At that tournament, he ran 150 and out in the finals, never letting his opponent {{back to the table}} after an early safety battle; <b>an</b> <b>accomplishment</b> that has never been equaled. Crane also holds the record for the most runner-up finishes for the World Crown with 13.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his WWE career, Cena has won 25 {{champion}}ships, with 16 reigns as a {{world champion}} (13 times as WWE Champion and three times as WWE's World Heavyweight Champion), <b>an</b> <b>accomplishment</b> only previously achieved by WWE Hall of Famer Ric Flair. He is also a five-time United States Champion and a four-time world tag team champion (two World Tag Team and two WWE Tag Team). Furthermore, he is a Money in the Bank ladder match winner (2012), a two-time Royal Rumble winner (2008, 2013), and a three-time Superstar of the Year Slammy Award winner (2009, 2010, 2012). Cena has the fourth-highest number of combined days as WWE Champion, behind Bruno Sammartino, Bob Backlund, and Hulk Hogan. He has also headlined WWE's flagship event, WrestleMania, on five different occasions (WrestleManias 22, 23, XXVII, XXVIII, and 29) {{over the course of}} his career, as well as many others pay-per-view events.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} seventeenth music became less <b>an</b> <b>accomplishment</b> of the gentle classes and {{increasingly}} a skill pursued by professionals. It was enjoyed in otherwise silent concert rooms {{rather than as}} incidental entertainment in the houses of royalty and nobles. The German flute was probably introduced into Scotland {{towards the end of}} the seventeenth century. The Italian style of classical music was probably first brought to Scotland by the Italian cellist and composer Lorenzo Bocchi, who travelled to Scotland in the 1720s, introducing the cello to the country and then developing settings for Lowland Scots songs. He possibly had a hand in the first Scottish Opera, the pastoral The Gentle Shepherd, with libretto by Allan Ramsay. Music in Edinburgh prospered through the patronage of figures including the merchant Sir John Clerk of Penicuik, who was also a noted composer, violinist and harpiscordist. The growth of a musical culture in the capital was marked by the incorporation of the Musical Society of Edinburgh in 1728.|$|E

25|$|The tournament was won by Spain, who {{defeated}} Germany 1–0 in the final.

25|$|While neither William Page or Henry Rogers {{operated}} the railway, it was arguably a crowning achievement for each man. Together, they had conceived {{and built a}} modern, well-engineered railroad from the coal mines of West Virginia to tidewater at Hampton Roads. The Virginian Railway operated more efficiently than its larger competitors, had all-new infrastructure, and no debt. It was <b>an</b> <b>accomplishment</b> unparalleled in US railroading, before or since.|$|E

University scholarships were introduced {{to ensure that no}} one who was qualified “should be deprived of a university education for financial reasons,” while a large school building programme was organised. A rapid {{increase in the number of}} trained teachers took place, and the number of new school places was increased.|$|E

25|$|Historically, the {{photoelectric}} effect {{is associated with}} Albert Einstein, who relied upon the phenomenon to establish the fundamental principle of quantum mechanics in 1905, <b>an</b> <b>accomplishment</b> for which Einstein received the 1921 Nobel Prize. It is worthwhile to note that Heinrich Hertz, working 18 years earlier, had not recognized that the kinetic energy of the emitted electrons {{is proportional to the}} frequency but independent of the optical intensity. This fact implied a discrete nature of light, i.e. the existence of quanta, for the first time.|$|E
25|$|After {{his first}} imprisonment, his public life {{consisted}} of good works (charity, teaching, and spreading Islam), exercising public responsibility, and suffering short prison sentences for upsetting the secular authorities. Between these incarcerations, Faizani {{was able to}} create a library in Pul-i-Khumri (in Baghlan Province). It was here that Faizani attracted a large following of professionals (teachers and government officials), military personnel, and students. In time, his followers encompassed both Sunni and Shiite Muslims, <b>an</b> <b>accomplishment</b> not repeated by other groups in Afghanistan. To this day, the school of Islam that he initiated, the Madrassa-e Tawheed, consists of both Sunnis and Shi'ites.|$|E
25|$|The {{pitcher who}} has the most shutouts {{at the end of}} the season is {{recognized}} as the league leader in that statistic. The National League and American League both have their own league leaders. A pitcher that leads the league in shutouts is often regarded as one of the best pitchers in the league. Such <b>an</b> <b>accomplishment</b> often makes that pitcher a contender for the Cy Young Award or even rarer as the league's Most Valuable Player, because a high number of shutouts may yield a high number of wins and a low earned run average.|$|E

25|$|Such <b>an</b> <b>accomplishment</b> is more {{significant}} than it at first appears. Anaximander most likely drew this map for three reasons.

Second, Thales would probably have found it easier to convince the Ionian city-states to join in a federation in order to push the Median threat away if he possessed such a tool. Finally, the philosophical idea of a global representation of the world simply for the sake of knowledge was reason enough to design one.|$|E
25|$|I Love Lucy was {{the most}} watched show in the United States in four of its six seasons, {{and it was the}} first to end its run at the top of the Nielsen ratings (<b>an</b> <b>accomplishment</b> later matched only by The Andy Griffith Show in 1968 and Seinfeld in 1998). The show is still {{syndicated}} in dozens of languages across the world and remains popular with an American audience of 40 million each year.

The Pats also set a record for most regular season wins in a single season. The victory was the Patriots’ 19th consecutive regular season victory, breaking their own record set during the 2003–2004 season.
