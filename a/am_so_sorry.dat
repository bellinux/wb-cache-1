25|$|The {{execution}} {{by lethal}} injection began at 10:53pm EDT. In his final words, Davis maintained his innocence, saying:Well, first of all I'd like to address the MacPhail family. I'd like to let you all know, despite the situation – I know {{all of you are}} still convinced that I'm the person that killed your father, your son and your brother, but I am innocent. The incident that happened that night was not my fault. I did not have a gun that night. I did not shoot your family member. But I <b>am</b> <b>so</b> <b>sorry</b> for your loss. I really am – sincerely. All I can ask is that each of you look deeper into this case, so that you really will finally see the truth. I ask my family and friends that you all continue to pray, that you all continue to forgive. Continue to fight this fight. For those about to take my life, may God have mercy on all of your souls. God bless you all. He was declared dead at 11:08pm EDT.|$|E
500|$|On 15 August 1915, Tatiana {{wrote her}} mother another letter expressing {{her desire to}} help her bear the burdens {{brought on by the}} war: [...] "I simply can't tell you how awfully sorry I am for you, my beloved ones. I <b>am</b> <b>so</b> <b>sorry</b> I can in no way help you or be useful. In such moments I am sorry I'm not a man." [...] As Tatiana grew into adulthood, she {{undertook}} more public appearances than her sisters and headed committees. Vyrubova recalled that she became better known to the public than her three sisters because of her attention to duty and her ability to engage those she met. In their memoirs, both her mother's friend, Vyrubova, and lady in waiting Lili Dehn recalled that Tatiana, the most social of the sisters, longed for friends her own age but her social life was restricted by her rank and her mother's distaste for society. She also had a more introspective side, known only to her closest friends and family. [...] "With her, as with her mother, shyness and reserve were accounted as pride, but, once you knew her and had gained her affection, this reserve disappeared and the real Tatiana became apparent," [...] Dehn recalled. [...] "She was a poetical creature, always yearning for the ideal, and dreaming of great friendships which might be hers." ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 21, Lynch's {{longtime}} friend and manager Johnny Fratto became the first to report his death. Fratto tweeted [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>so</b> <b>sorry</b> and so sad to inform everyone that my friend Eric [...] "The Actor" [...] Lynch passed away yesterday afternoon!!!" ...|$|E

2500|$|After his {{performance}} on {{stage at the}} 2005 Screen Actors Guild Awards, when he had giggled in presenting Brokeback Mountain as a nominee for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture, the Los Angeles Times referred to his presentation as an [...] "apparent gay spoof". Ledger called the Times later and explained that his levity resulted from stage fright, {{saying that he had}} been told that he would be presenting the award only minutes earlier; he stated: [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>so</b> <b>sorry</b> and I apologise for my nervousness. I would be absolutely horrified if my stage fright was misinterpreted as a lack of respect for the film, the topic and for the amazing filmmakers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Whilst Rouvas was {{disappointed}} with his seventh-place finish, announcing to Greek media [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>so</b> <b>sorry,</b> I {{wanted us to}} win", there was still unanimous support towards the artist himself in the country. [...] "Seventh in Europe, first in our hearts" [...] many journalists reported on Greek television. The media and public pronounced their support for Rouvas, the general consensus being that the artist gave it his best even though this did not translate in enough votes in the contest. All criticism in Greece focused on {{the selection of the}} song itself, rather than the artist's performance. Rouvas stated that, overall, it has all been a wonderful experience for him: [...] "some win, some lose, personally, I gave everything I had. But it was a wonderful experience".|$|E

60|$|There were {{formerly}} a king and a queen, who <b>were</b> <b>so</b> <b>sorry</b> {{that they had}} no children; <b>so</b> <b>sorry</b> that it cannot be expressed. They went to all the waters in the world; vows, pilgrimages, all ways were tried, and all to no purpose.|$|R
