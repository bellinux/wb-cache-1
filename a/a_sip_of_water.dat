2500|$|In the Bhagavata Purana, Ambarisha {{was a great}} {{devotee of}} Vishnu who adhered firmly to the truth. He {{performed}} a yajna with such great devotional fervour that Narayana was pleased to bless him with his Sudarshana Chakra("Sudarshana" [...] meaning [...] "good-looking" [...] or [...] "beautiful"), as a shield of protection over him. Once, Ambarisha performed a religious rite known as the Ekadashi and Dvadashi vrata, for 1 year(i.e. the king would fast on the 11th day of every lunar month and break his fast the next day). After observing this practice for a year, he took up a final fast of 3 days and nights to conclude the rite. As the moment for breaking this fast drew near, sage Durvasa arrived where Ambarisha was and the king received him with due respect. Durvasa agreed to the king's request to be his honoured guest and asked the king to wait until he had finished his bath in the river Yamuna. The auspicious moment soon arrived when the king had to break his fast to fulfill his vow, but Durvasa had not yet returned from his bath. Ambarisha was in a dilemma, as, on the one hand, it was impolite to take food before serving a guest, but on the other, {{the time had come}} for the fast to be broken. After consulting his priests, the king broke his fast by taking <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and awaited Durvasa's arrival to offer him food.|$|E

60|$|To {{pass the}} first day there was not difficult. The novelty of the {{position}} was great; {{the interest of the}} thing immense. Indefinite hopes of the future were strong, and they had plenty to say and speculate about during the passing hours. When night came, preparation was made for departure. The provision bags were slung, <b>a</b> moderate <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> indulged in, and they set forth, after a very brief prayer by Stevenson, that God would guide them safely on their way. There was no formality in that prayer. The marine did not ask his comrades to kneel or to agree with him.

60|$|Behind {{the wooden}} erection, {{by which he}} was fenced from more {{ordinary}} mortals, the learned Judge leaned forward. The electric light, just turned on above his head, fell on his face, and mellowed it to an orange hue beneath the snowy crown of his wig; the amplitude of his robes grew before the eye; his whole figure, facing the comparative dusk of the Court, radiated like some majestic and sacred body.

40|$|A four-years-old female {{cocker spaniel}} dog was {{presented}} {{with a history of}} vomiting and tenesmus for the last six days. There was no defecation, only fresh blood was coming from rectum and the animal was taking only <b>a</b> few <b>sips</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> for last two days. Physical examination revealed that the animal was dehydrated. Tenderness was appreciable on abdominal palpation while a firm, painful mass was felt in the mid-caudal abdomen. The clinical history and physical examination was suggestive of intestinal intussusception. Later on an ultrasound examination revealed a sausage-shaped mass with folded layers of intestinal wall. The intussusception was found to be ileocolic on laparotomy. Resection and end-to-end anastomosis was performed. Intussusception is commonly observed in puppies < 1 year of age, less commonly in cocker spaniel...|$|R

The incident was also brought up during a [...] "Celebrity Secrets" [...] comedy bit on Late Night with Conan O'Brien in the late 1990s, where a nervous-acting Ritter jokingly says [...] "Somebody asked me if I did that on purpose...", after taking <b>a</b> nervous <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> he responds [...] "You bet I did!" ...|$|R
60|$|Early {{next morning}} I left Tolosa and {{travelled}} {{the whole day}} in a south-westerly direction. I did not hurry, but frequently dismounted to give my horse <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> clear <b>water</b> and <b>a</b> taste of green herbage. I also called during the day at three or four estancia houses, but failed to hear {{anything that could be}} advantageous to me. In this way I covered about thirty-five miles of road, going always towards {{the eastern part of the}} Florida district in the heart of the country. About an hour before sunset I resolved to go no farther that day; and I could not have hoped to find a nicer resting-place than the one now before me--a neat rancho with a wide corridor supported by wooden pillars, standing amidst a bower of fine old weeping-willows. It was a calm, sunshiny afternoon, peace and quiet resting on everything, even bird and insect, for they were silent, or uttered only soft, subdued notes; and that modest lodge, with its rough stone walls and thatched roof, seemed to be in harmony with it all. It looked like the home of simple-minded, pastoral people that had for their only world the grassy wilderness, watered by many clear streams, bounded ever by that far-off, unbroken ring of the horizon, and arched over with blue heaven, starry by night and filled by day with sweet sunshine.|$|R
60|$|So it {{was that}} Maud found her duties not at all arduous this evening. Indeed, the sympathy she felt for these brave men {{was so strong that}} it wearied her more than the actual work of nursing them. <b>A</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> here, a cold {{compress}} there, the administration of medicines to keep down or prevent fever, little attentions of this character were all that were required. Speaking French fluently, she was able to converse with all those under her charge and all seemed eager to relate to their beautiful nurse their experiences, hopes and griefs. Soon she realized she was beginning to learn more of the true nature of war than she had ever gleaned from the correspondents of the newspapers.|$|E
60|$|Then {{began our}} dreadful march. The lion-skin that had saved our lives, {{and was now}} baked hard as a board, we left behind, but the rifles we took.

Indeed, once we did see it, green and shining, not more than three miles away, but when we got to the head of the hill beyond which it should lie we found that the vision was only a mirage, and our hearts nearly broke with disappointment. Oh! to men dying of thirst, that mirage was indeed a cruel mockery.|$|E

50|$|Zipes {{believes}} that Baum was against {{any kind of}} violence. In The Emerald City of Oz (1910), the Nome King's invasion of Oz is therefore defeated in a non-violent way. Baum invented a fountain filled with the <b>water</b> <b>of</b> oblivion. <b>A</b> single <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> this <b>water</b> makes the drinker forget everything, including any evil intentions. The would-be invaders of Oz drink from the fountain, forget everything, and return home. Zipes argues that Baum was not going for a message of turning the other cheek. He was aware that if someone uses the same methods as his/her enemies, then that person risks becoming like them. If the defenders of Oz became cutthroat and militant like the Nome King and his forces, this would have tarnished the spirit and principles of Oz. So their victory, as orchestrated by Ozma is using a different method, oblivion. The method is creative, humane, and humanitarian.|$|R

60|$|My {{constant}} torment was thirst. I {{was in the}} prairie, and it was scorched {{and brown}} to the horizon. I searched and prayed pitifully for water,--for only <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> the brown <b>water</b> with the specks in it {{that was in the}} swamp. There were no swamps. I was on the bed in the cabin looking at the shifts and hunting shirts on the pegs, and Polly Ann would bring a gourdful <b>of</b> clear <b>water</b> from the spring as far as the door. Nay, once I got it to my lips, and it was gone. Sometimes {{a young man in a}} hunting shirt, square-shouldered, clear-eyed, his face tanned and his fair hair bleached by the sun, would bring the water. He was the hero of my boyhood, and part of him indeed was in me. And I would have followed him again to Vincennes despite the tortures of the damned. But when I spoke his name he grew stouter before me, and his eyes lost their lustre and his hair turned gray; and his hand shook as he held out the gourd and spilled its contents ere I could reach them.|$|R
60|$|Then a cow caribou {{came out}} of the woods onto the grassy point above me to drink. First she wandered all over the point, making it look {{afterwards}} as if a herd had passed. Then she took <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> by a rock, crossed to my side of the point, and took a sip there; then {{to the end of the}} point, and another sip; then back to the first place. A nibble of grass, and she waded far out from shore to sip there; then back, with a nod to a lily pad, and a sip nearer the brook. Finally she meandered a long way up the shore out of sight, and when I picked up the paddle to go, she came back again. Truly a Wandergeist of the woods, like the plover of the coast, who never knows what he wants, nor why he circles about so, nor where he is going next.|$|E
60|$|In any case, how {{unsatisfactory}} is the mosquitoes' existence, {{and what}} a curious position they occupy in nature! Let us suppose that, owing to some great change in {{the conditions of the}} earth, rapacious birds were no longer able to capture prey, and that, by a corresponding change in their organizations, they were able to subsist on the air they breathed, with perhaps an occasional green leaf and <b>a</b> <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> and yet retained the old craving for solid food, and the old predatory instincts and powers undiminished; they would be in the position of mosquitoes in the imago state. And if then fifty or a hundred individuals were to succeed every year in capturing something and making one hearty meal, these few fortunate diners would bear about the same proportion to all the raptors on the globe as the mosquitoes that succeed in sucking blood to their unsuccessful fellows. In the case of the hawks, the effect of the few meals on the entire rapacious family or order would certainly be nil; and it is impossible to believe for a moment that the comparatively infinitesimal amount of blood sucked by mosquitoes can. serve to invigorate the species. The wonder is that the machinery, which accomplishes nothing, should continue in such perfect working order.|$|E

5000|$|T. P. O'Connor {{refers to}} Biggar's {{attributes}} : ...the obstructionist wants, as a rule, {{strength of character}} rather than of oratory - as witness the extraordinary work in obstruction done by the late Mr. Biggar, who, by nature, {{was one of the}} most inarticulate of men. It was because Biggar had nerves of steel - a courage that did not know the meaning of fear, and that remained calm in the midst of a cyclone of repugnance, hatred, and menace......Joe Biggar, his Parnell's associate, was also able to speak in any circumstances with exactly the same ease of spirit. To him, speaking was but a means to an end, and whether people listened to him or not - stopped to hang on his words or fled before his grating voice and Ulster accent - it was all one to him.The Freeman's Journal reported Biggar's obstruction of the Threshing Machines Bill on 27 February 1877 :With sturdy Northern resolution, Mr. Biggar in the last hour of the sitting of the House of Commons yesterday, assailed and defeated the Threshing Machines Bill. If your readers ask me why Mr. Biggar defeated the Threshing Machines Bill, I really must confess my inability to inform them. Perhaps it was that the Bill was proposed by Mr. Chaplin, and perhaps Mr. Biggar wished to punish Mr. Chaplin for his attack on Mr. Gladstone. It was a daring thing to do - I mean it was daring in one to get up with the knowledge that you must talk for a half an hour on Threshing Machines. But Mr. Biggar triumphed. Once or twice I really fancied all was over with the hon. member. He, to all appearance, had exhausted every possible branch of his subject, and Mr. Chaplin was already chuckling in anticipation of the break-down of his foe. But no! Mr. Biggar bethought him of [...] "the old flail". It was a moment of inspiration. Who could not talk for fifteen minutes on [...] " [...] the old flail". A groan of mortal anguish escaped Mr. Chaplin as, in eloquently rounded periods, the honourable member for Cavan turned over, ogled, turned over again, and genially touched upon the beauties of flails. At length the hour struck. Mr. Biggar sank down victorious, and Mr. Chaplin rushed in anger from the House.T. D. Sullivan refers to Biggar's preparation and delaying technique :Of course he could not get the materials for his lengthy discourses [...] "all out of his own head" [...] but he knew whence there was a perfect mine of such matter, and thence he provided himself with supplies.
