40|$|Development {{of animal}} models has furthered our {{understanding}} of mechanisms underpinning cancer-induced <b>bone</b> <b>pain</b> (CIBP). Cancer-induced <b>bone</b> <b>pain</b> is a unique pain state with mechanisms akin to those of chronic inflammatory and neuropathic pain. I aim to highlight the role of both neuronal and non-neuronal mechanisms in a rat model of cancer-induced <b>bone</b> <b>pain</b> (MRMT- 1). Anti-convulsant drugs are useful {{in the treatment of}} neuropathic pain and {{have been shown to be}} effective in animal models of inflammatory pain. Carbamazepine reduced neuronal excitability seen at time of peak behaviour after MRMT- 1 but not sham injection, highlighting the possible role of sodium channel activity in maintaining the neuronal excitability in cancer-induced <b>bone</b> <b>pain.</b> Furthermore carbamazepine reduced pain-like ipsilateral hypersensitivity after MRMT- 1 injection in awake animals further indicating the usefulness of sodium channel antagonism in cancer-induced <b>bone</b> <b>pain.</b> Peptidergic C fibre population, which co-express calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP) and the receptor for nerve growth factor trkA, carry sensory information from bone. It is for these reasons that modulation of CGRP signalling in the MRMT- 1 model of cancer-induced <b>bone</b> <b>pain</b> has been investigated using "drug X" (donated from Pfizer UK) which interrupts CGRP signalling in nociceptive pathways. Subcutaneous administration of drug X reduced ipsilateral pain-like behaviours seen following MRMT- 1 injection, suggesting that CGRP antagonism may be a useful target in the treatment of cancer-induced <b>bone</b> <b>pain.</b> Microglia have been implicated in the pathophysiology underlying neuropathic pain and have become activated in models of cancer-induced <b>bone</b> <b>pain.</b> OX 42 labelled microglial in the lumbar dorsal horn ipsilateral to MRMT- 1 increase between days 5 and 11 post surgery. Microglial inhibition using minocycline between days 0 and 9 but not between days 5 and 9 post-MRMT- 1 injection delays pain-like behaviour in the post-operative period, indicating that early microgliosis is key in the initiation of cancer-induced <b>bone</b> <b>pain...</b>|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: One {{of the key}} {{targets for}} metastatic cancer cells is the skeleton. Once metastatic cells are {{established}} within the bone matrix, skeletal integrity becomes increasingly compromised. Bone lesions lead to various complications, including <b>bone</b> <b>pain,</b> fractures and spinal cord compression. MECHANISMS OF <b>BONE</b> PAIN: <b>Bone</b> <b>pain</b> is debilitating and affects {{quality of life of}} the patient. In addition, it increases the use of health care resources. Many patients with metastatic bone disease experience substantial <b>bone</b> <b>pain</b> despite state-of-the-art systemic analgesic treatment. Incident pain is the predominant pain syndrome. TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR BONE PAIN: Typically, this syndrome requires moderate baseline analgesia with increased on-demand doses. Other techniques for treating <b>bone</b> <b>pain,</b> including radiation therapy, neuraxial application of analgesics, nerve blocks and local stabilisation procedures, should be considered. In addition, therapy with bisphosphonates targeting bone-specific pain is an important strategy. This review discusses the various management options for <b>bone</b> <b>pain</b> arising from metastatic bone disease...|$|R

40|$|Background/Aim: Severe <b>bone</b> <b>pain</b> is {{experienced}} by 60 – 80 % {{of patients with}} metastatic bone disease, and has {{a profound impact on}} quality of life. Therefore, effective pain relief is an important goal in managing metastatic bone disease. Orthopedic surgeons are often challenged with patients presenting with newly diagnosed bone metastases and severe and disabling <b>bone</b> <b>pain.</b> It is important to provide fast and sufficient analgesia. Clinical trials have demonstrated that bisphosphonates reduce effectively and sustained <b>bone</b> <b>pain</b> by approved standard dosage over time. Open label prospective trials have shown that short time high dose i. v. Ibandronate is effective in rapid pain relief in different primary tumors. Patients and methods: In 33 patients with metastatic <b>bone</b> <b>pain</b> from newly diagnosed skeletal metastases we utilized the loading-dose concept for intravenous ibandronate (6  mg infused over 1  h on 3 consecutive days). Results: In 33 patients loading-dose ibandronate therapy significantly reduced <b>bone</b> <b>pain</b> within the first 5 – 7 days (VAS day 0 : 6 – 8 vs. day 7 : 3 – 4). Only 3 patients showed no response concerning a distinct pain reduction within the first days of therapy. There was no increase in pain medication. Conclusion: This clinical observational study in selected patients with severe metastatic <b>bone</b> <b>pain</b> undergoing an intensive high dosed ibandronate-therapy for a short period demonstrated that loading-dose ibandronate (6  mg i. v., 3 consecutive days) resulted in a reduction of pain within days...|$|R

50|$|<b>Bone</b> <b>pain</b> (also known {{medically}} {{by several}} other names) is pain {{coming from a}} bone. It {{occurs as a result}} of a wide range of diseases and/or physical conditions and may severely impair the quality of life for patients who suffer from it. <b>Bone</b> <b>pain</b> belongs to the class of deep somatic pain, often experienced as a dull pain that cannot be localized accurately by the patient. This is in contrast with the pain which is mediated by superficial receptors in, e.g., the skin. <b>Bone</b> <b>pain</b> can have several possible causes ranging from extensive physical stress to serious diseases such as cancer.For many years it has been known that bones are innervated with sensory neurons. Yet their exact anatomy remained obscure due to the contrasting physical properties of bone and neural tissue. More recently, it is becoming clear what types of nerves innervated which sections of bone. The periosteal layer of bone tissue is highly pain-sensitive and an important cause of pain in several disease conditions causing <b>bone</b> <b>pain,</b> like fractures, osteoarthritis, etc. However, in certain diseases the endosteal and haversian nerve supply seems to play an important role, e.g. in osteomalacia, osteonecrosis, and other bone diseases. Thus there are several types of <b>bone</b> <b>pain,</b> each with many potential sources or origins of cause.|$|R
40|$|AbstractMetastatic <b>bone</b> <b>pain</b> is a {{significant}} cause of morbidity in patients with advanced cancer and greatly reduces quality of life. Standard palliative treatments such as opioids may not provide effective relief of metastatic <b>bone</b> <b>pain,</b> particularly acute breakthrough pain, without unacceptable side effects at the high doses required. A mouse model of metastatic <b>bone</b> <b>pain</b> has been developed in which tumor cells are injected directly into the marrow space of mice femora. As the tumor cells proliferate, mice display reproducible behaviors associated with pain, such as flinching or guarding the affected limb, that increase as bone destruction progresses. The model also enables measurement of other endpoints, including tumor growth and migration, and monitoring of relevant cell types such as osteoclasts, macrophages, and neurons. Mouse studies have provided important information on the mechanisms behind metastatic <b>bone</b> <b>pain</b> and the specific effects of potential therapies. These {{studies have demonstrated that}} metastatic bone disease is caused by multiple factors and that osteoclasts are particularly important in pain generation through destruction of bone and nerve fibers and acidotic stimulation of pH-sensitive receptors. Clinical studies with bisphosphonates demonstrate that these agents provide relief of metastatic <b>bone</b> <b>pain,</b> and preliminary experiments using the mouse model suggest that this may occur via multiple mechanisms. Further studies are under way...|$|R

Methods: Consecutive breast cancer patients undergoing surgery between 1988 and 1998 were examined for signs of skeletal metastasis until December 2006. Patients who were diagnosed as having skeletal metastasis were the subjects of this study. Bone scans were performed annually for 5, 7 or 10 years; they were also conducted if skeletal metastasis was suspected. Data concerning <b>bone</b> <b>pain</b> and tumor markers {{at the time of}} skeletal metastasis diagnosis, and data relating to various factors including tumors, lymph nodes and hormone receptors at the time of surgery, were investigated. The relationships between factors such as <b>bone</b> <b>pain,</b> SRE and CSD were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox’s analysis. Results: Skeletal metastasis occurred in 668 patients but the pain status of two patients was unknown, therefore 666 patients were included in the study. At the time of skeletal metastasis diagnosis 270 patients complained of pain; however, 396 patients did not. Analysis of data using Cox’s and Kaplan-Meier methods demonstrated that patients without pain had fewer SREs and better survival rates than those with pain. Hazard ratios regarding SRE (base = patients without pain) were 2. 331 in univariate analysis and 2. 243 in multivariate analysis.

Patients of all thalassemia syndromes in the Thalassemia Clinical Research Network, $ 6 yr of age, with no preexisting medical condition affecting bone mass or requiring steroids, participated. We measured spine and femur BMD and whole body BMC by DXA and assessed vertebral abnormalities by morphometric X-ray absorptiometry (MXA). Medical history by interview and review of medical records, physical examinations, and blood and urine collections were performed.
