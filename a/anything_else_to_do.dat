A number of compositions credited to Wright came out of improvisation and randomly trying ideas, some of which were picked up enthusiastically by his band mates. Wright later said [...] "I just play and don't really think about what I'm doing, I just let it happen". Of all the Pink Floyd members, Wright was the most reserved, sitting down behind the keyboards and concentrating on the music.|$|E

To Andy's great dismay, they earn 5,000 points {{by the end of}} the day. When Andy and the crew go to the tattoo parlor, Andy backs down and admits to Jim that he is not sure why Robert made him manager. Jim reassures Andy that he managed to pick up sales, and that no one in the office expects him to go through with the tattoo idea. Pepped up by Jim's talk, Andy enthusiastically agrees to getting the tattoo, which Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) changes, without telling Andy, to an image of a dog that has [...] "Nard" [...] written on it, a reference to Andy's nickname [...] "Nard Dog." [...] Upon seeing his completed tattoo in a mirror, Andy is pleased with the result. Robert then reveals to the cameras that he picked Andy because he is an uncomplicated choice which causes people to rally behind him, because he is an underdog. Meanwhile, Pam and Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) become walking buddies at Angela's request, but after Angela says she's reported Pam to Social Services for drinking herbal tea out of coffee mugs while pregnant, a disgusted Pam tells Angela they should not have <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with each other.|$|E

I was a straight-up church girl. I did a lot of stuff in the community such as singing in various choirs and at my school." [...] In discussing the musical transition she said, [...] "it wasn't a hard transition at all. This is something that has been in my heart to do, so I had to do it.

2500|$|After the Nazi {{seizure of}} power work became {{harder for the}} Social Democrats in Cuxhaven. The NSDAP put the elected mayor Werner Grube (DVP) on leave, {{claiming}} that the composition of Council and City Parliament did no longer fit [...] "the people's will". Grube was now temporarily deputised by government building officer Sch√§tzler (NSDAP). On 9 May 1933 the SPD councillors were removed from all boardp. Anna Strohsahl thereupon claimed that [...] "it cannot be {{the sense of the}} Gleichschaltung to completely exclude the Left from cooperation, which is representing 4000 voterp." [...] 19 May 1933 the Council decided to pay the 50 Reichsmark expense allowance only to councillors heading a board in future. In a City Parliament session counsillor Morisse declared to no longer setting value on the Social Democrats' work: [...] "You don't have <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> than to be ashamed and to keep silent." [...] After this, Anna Strohsahl and the complete SPD group left the City Parliament. Following the prohibition of SPD on 22 June 1933 her political work ended for the time being. Also the personal situation of the Strohsahl family worsened, harassing controls by the National Socialists increased. The supervisory school authority retroactively changed the passed high school diploma of her daughter Ruth from [...] "good" [...] to [...] "poor/fail" [...] which made her flee to the UK. With the prohibition of the [...] "Alte Liebe" [...] on 16 March 1933 John Strohsahl was unemployed. Anna Strohsahl supported her family during the Second World War as a house maid and sewer.|$|E
2500|$|After its {{victory in}} the Battle of Britain in 1940 and the Luftwaffe having {{switched}} to night bombing {{in the fall of}} 1940, the day fighters of the Royal Air Force's Fighter Command were [...] "a force without a mission". Without <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> the day fighters of RAF Fighter Command were in the spring of 1941 deployed on a series of search-and-destroy missions of flying over France to engage the Luftwaffe in combat. When these missions involved two or three fighters, they were known as rhubarbs, and rodeos if they involved more than three aircraft. In the second half of 1941, the aerial offensive over France was greatly stepped up, leading to the losses of 411 British and Canadian aircraft in the rhubarb and rodeo attacks. In response, in the spring of 1942 the Luftwaffe deployed the new Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighter to its airfields in France. The Fw 190 fighters were greatly superior to the Supermarine Spitfires and Hawker Hurricanes used by the British and Canadian pilots, and Allied losses over France climbed rapidly. However, the RAF was convinced it was winning the air war, believing their losses of 259 Spitfires over France {{in the first six months}} of 1942 were justified by the reported destruction of 197 German aircraft in the same period (the Luftwaffe actually lost 59 aircraft). A major problem for the RAF was that the Luftwaffe fighters declined to engage in combat over the French coast and instead operated inland, forcing the Spitfires to fly deep into France to engage in combat and thereby using up their fuel, placing the British aircraft at a distinct disadvantage when they finally encountered the Luftwaffe. Thanks to intelligence provided by Ultra, the British knew that if any Allied force attempted to seize a port in France, the Germans would assume it to be the beginning of an invasion and that the Luftwaffe was to mount an all-out effort against the Allied forces in the port, whenever it might be. Armed with this knowledge, Fighter Command pressed very strongly in the spring and summer of 1942 for a raid to temporarily seize a French port in order to provoke the Luftwaffe into committing most of its fighters in France to a battle along the French coast that would favour the RAF. It was largely because of pressure from the RAF to fight the [...] "greatest air battle" [...] over the French coast that Operation Rutter/Jubilee went ahead.|$|E

The cyberpunk setting of the game is extremely cool, and since the game is a little similar to Shenmue in style, it's one that adventure fans (like me) will dig. If they spent a little more time and polished up the port more (by reducing the jittering streaming, for example) it would have been a must-have adventure for DC owners. As it stands at release, however, only hardcore adventure gamers should apply." [...] Nash Werner of GamePro said the PC version [...] "will take you by surprise, as it did me. And, hell, you're getting original David Bowie songs right out of the box! Omikron will take away your soul."

60|$|Man is imperfect; yet, in his literature, he must express {{himself and}} his own views and preferences; for <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>else</b> is <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a far more perilous thing than to risk being immoral: {{it is to be}} sure of being untrue. To ape a sentiment, even a good one, is to travesty a sentiment; that will not be helpful. To conceal a sentiment, if you are sure you hold it, is to take a liberty with truth. There is {{probably}} no point of view possible to a sane man but contains some truth and, in the true connection, might be profitable to the race. I am not afraid of the truth, if any one could tell it me, but I am afraid of parts of it impertinently uttered. There is a time to dance and a time to mourn; to be harsh as well as to be sentimental; to be ascetic as well as to glorify the appetites; and if a man were to combine all these extremes into his work, each in its place and proportion, that work would be the world's masterpiece of morality as well as of art. Partiality is immorality; for any book is wrong that gives a misleading picture of the world and life. The trouble is that the weakling must be partial; the work of one proving dank and depressing; of another, cheap and vulgar; of a third, epileptically sensual; of a fourth, sourly ascetic. In literature as in conduct, you can never hope <b>to</b> <b>do</b> exactly right. All you can <b>do</b> is <b>to</b> make as sure as possible; and for that there is but one rule. Nothing should be done in a hurry that can be done slowly. It is no use to write a book and put it by for nine or even ninety years; for in the writing you will have partly convinced yourself; the delay must precede any beginning; and if you meditate a work of art, you should first long roll the subject under the tongue to make sure you like the flavour, before you brew a volume that shall taste of it from end to end; or if you propose to enter on the field of controversy, you should first have thought upon the question under all conditions, in health as well as in sickness, in sorrow as well as in joy. It is this nearness of examination necessary for any true and kind writing, that makes the practice of the art a prolonged and noble education for the writer.|$|R
