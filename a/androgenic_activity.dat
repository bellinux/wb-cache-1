25|$|Due to its {{combined}} {{disadvantages of}} a relatively poor ratio of anabolic to <b>androgenic</b> <b>activity,</b> unusually high estrogenicity, {{and the potential for}} hepatotoxicity (as with other 17α-alkylated AAS), methyltestosterone has not been used as commonly as many other AAS either in medicine or for physique- or performance-enhancing purposes.|$|E
25|$|NET (0.5 to 3mg/day) {{has been}} found to dose-dependently {{decrease}} circulating SHBG levels, which is a common property of androgens and is due to AR-mediated suppression of hepatic SHBG production.

30|$|Estrogenic and <b>androgenic</b> ED <b>activities</b> of the {{remaining}} substances cannot be excluded, but are less likely. Because the structural alerts perform much better for substances with (very) high estrogenic and <b>androgenic</b> <b>activities</b> (< 10 % false-negative classifications for strong binders) as compared to > 15 % false-negative classifications for (very) weak binders, there is reasonable probability that the candidates with potential endocrine activities based on structural alerts include the most hazardous EA-EDs.|$|R
25|$|Cyproterone acetate is a 6-chloro-1,2-methylene {{derivative}} of 17α-acetoxyprogesterone. It shows major antiandrogenic <b>activity</b> together with <b>androgenic</b> <b>activities.</b> Cyproterone acetate displays high affinity for AR in rats which increases when the 1,2-methylene group {{is removed from}} the compound. If the chlorine atom is replaced by a methyl group the binding slightly decreases, whereas further removal of the C6 double bond modifies the binding kinetics, see figure 7.|$|R
25|$|The {{measurement}} of the dissociation between anabolic and androgenic effects among AAS is based largely on a simple although arguably unsophisticated and outdated model involving rat tissue bioassays. It {{is referred to as}} the myotrophic-androgenic index. In this model, anabolic (myotrophic) activity is measured by change in the weight of the rat bulbocavernosus/levator ani muscle and <b>androgenic</b> <b>activity</b> is measured by change in the weight of the rat ventral prostate (or, alternatively, the rat seminal vesicles) in response to exposure to the AAS, and the measurements are then compared and used to form a ratio.|$|E
25|$|Although it {{functions}} as an endogenous precursor to more potent androgens such as testosterone and DHT, DHEA {{has been found}} to possess some degree of <b>androgenic</b> <b>activity</b> in its own right, acting as a low affinity (Ki = 1 μM), weak partial agonist of the androgen receptor (AR). However, its intrinsic activity at the receptor is quite weak, and on account of that, due to competition for binding with full agonists like testosterone, it can actually behave more like an antagonist depending on circulating testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels, and hence, like an antiandrogen. However, its affinity for the receptor is very low, and for that reason, is unlikely to be of much significance under normal circumstances.|$|E
25|$|High {{doses of}} progestogens exert {{negative}} {{feedback on the}} hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis by activating the progesterone receptor. As a result, they have antigonadotropic effects – that is, they suppress the gonadal production of sex hormones such as androgens. As such, sufficient dosages of progestogens, such as cyproterone acetate, gestonorone caproate, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, megestrol acetate, and MPA, can considerably lower androgen levels. In addition, certain other progestogens, such as cyproterone acetate, megestrol acetate, drospirenone, and nomegestrol acetate, bind to and block the activation of the androgen receptor. On the other hand, certain other progestogens, including 19-nortestosterone derivatives like levonorgestrel, norgestrel, norethisterone, and norethisterone acetate, as well as, to a lesser extent, the 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivative MPA, have weak <b>androgenic</b> <b>activity</b> because they bind to and activate the androgen receptor similarly to testosterone, and may produce androgenic effects such as acne, hirsutism, and increased sex drive.|$|E

40|$|Background: The European chemicals' {{legislation}} REACH aims {{to protect}} {{man and the}} environment from substances of very high concern (SVHC). Chemicals like endocrine disruptors (EDs) {{may be subject to}} authorization. Identification of (potential) EDs with regard to the environment is limited because specific experimental assessments are not standard requirements under REACH. Evidence is based on a combination of in vitro and in vivo experiments (if available), expert judgement, and structural analogy with known EDs. Objectives: The objectives of this study are to review and refine structural alerts for the indication of potential estrogenic and <b>androgenic</b> endocrine <b>activities</b> based on in vitro studies; to analyze in vivo mammalian long-term reproduction studies with regard to estrogen- and androgen-sensitive endpoints in order to identify potential indicators for endocrine activity with regard to the environment; to assess the consistency of potential estrogenic and <b>androgenic</b> endocrine <b>activities</b> based on in vitro assays and in vivo mammalian long-term reproduction studies and fish life-cycle tests; and to evaluate structural alerts, in vitro assays, and in vivo mammalian long-term reproduction studies for the indication of potential estrogenic and androgenic endocrine disruptors in fish. Results: Screening for potential endocrine activities in fish via estrogenic and androgenic modes of action based on structural alerts provides similar information as in vitro receptor-mediated assays. Additional evidence can be obtained from in vivo mammalian long-term reproduction studies. Conclusive confirmation is possible with fish lifecycle tests. Application of structural alerts to the more than 33, 000 discrete organic compounds of the EINECS inventory indicated 3585 chemicals (approx. 11 %) as potential candidates for estrogenic and androgenic effects that should be further investigated. Endocrine activities of the remaining substances cannot be excluded; however, because the structural alerts perform much better for substances with (very) high estrogenic and <b>androgenic</b> <b>activities,</b> there is reasonable probability that the most hazardous candidates have been identified.

25|$|In females, {{synthesis}} of estrogens starts in theca interna {{cells in the}} ovary, by the {{synthesis of}} androstenedione from cholesterol. Androstenedione is a substance of weak <b>androgenic</b> <b>activity</b> which serves predominantly as a precursor for more potent androgens such as testosterone as well as estrogen. This compound crosses the basal membrane into the surrounding granulosa cells, where it is converted either immediately into estrone, or into testosterone and then estradiol in an additional step. The conversion of androstenedione to testosterone is catalyzed by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17β-HSD), whereas the conversion of androstenedione and testosterone into estrone and estradiol, respectively is catalyzed by aromatase, enzymes which are both expressed in granulosa cells. In contrast, granulosa cells lack 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, whereas theca cells express these enzymes and 17β-HSD but lack aromatase. Hence, both granulosa and theca cells are essential {{for the production of}} estrogen in the ovaries.|$|E
25|$|Testosterone can be robustly {{converted}} by 5α-reductase into DHT {{in so-called}} androgenic tissues such as skin, scalp, prostate, and seminal vesicles, {{but not in}} muscle or bone, where 5α-reductase either is not expressed or is only minimally expressed. As DHT is 3- to 10-fold more potent as an agonist of the AR than is testosterone, the AR agonist activity of testosterone is thus markedly and selectively potentiated in such tissues. In contrast to testosterone, DHT and other 4,5α-dihydrogenated AAS are already 5α-reduced, and for this reason, cannot be potentiated in androgenic tissues. 19-Nortestosterone derivatives like nandrolone can be metabolized by 5α-reductase similarly to testosterone, but 5α-reduced metabolites of 19-nortestosterone derivatives (e.g., 5α-dihydronandrolone) tend to have reduced activity as AR agonists, resulting in reduced <b>androgenic</b> <b>activity</b> in tissues that express 5α-reductase. In addition, some 19-nortestosterone derivatives, including trestolone (7α-methyl-19-nortestosterone (MENT)), 11β-methyl-19-nortestosterone (11β-MNT), and dimethandrolone (7α,11β-dimethyl-19-nortestosterone), cannot be 5α-reduced. Conversely, 17α-alkylated AAS can be 5α-reduced and are potentiated in androgenic tissues similarly to testosterone, with an exception being 17α-alkylated AAS that are already 4,5α-reduced.|$|E
2500|$|Aromatase inhibitors {{can be used}} {{to reduce}} or prevent the estrogenic effects of {{methyltestosterone}} and 5α-reductase inhibitors {{can be used to}} prevent its potentiation in so-called [...] "androgenic" [...] tissues and thereby improve its ratio of anabolic to <b>androgenic</b> <b>activity</b> and reduce its rate of androgenic side effects.

2500|$|NET, {{also known}} as 17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone or as 17α-ethynylestra-4-en-17β-ol-3-one, is a {{synthetic}} estrane steroid and a derivative of testosterone. It is specifically a derivative of testosterone in which an ethynyl group has been added at the C17α position and the methyl group at the C19 position has been removed; hence, it is a combined derivative of ethisterone (17α-ethynyltestosterone) and nandrolone (19-nortestosterone). These modifications result in gaining progestogenic and oral activity and reducing <b>androgenic</b> <b>activity.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Prasterone, {{also known}} as {{dehydroepiandrosterone}} (DHEA), is a naturally occurring steroid which {{is used as a}} supplement and medication. It is an androstane derivative and a precursor of steroid hormones like testosterone and estradiol. Prasterone has weak <b>androgenic</b> <b>activity,</b> weak estrogenic activity, and neurosteroid activity, and acts as a prohormone of androgens and estrogens depending on its [...] and route of administration. As a medication, prasterone may be used to restore or increase DHEA levels in deficiency or old age, for menopausal women as a weak androgen or to treat vaginal atrophy, and, in its sulfate form, for cervical dilation during childbirth.|$|E
2500|$|As an AAS, {{methyltestosterone}} is an agonist of the {{androgen receptor}} (AR), similarly to androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It is a substrate for 5α-reductase like testosterone, {{and so is}} potentiated analogously in so-called [...] "androgenic" [...] tissues like the skin, hair follicles, and prostate gland via transformation into the more potent AR agonist mestanolone (17α-methyl-DHT). As such, methyltestosterone has a relatively low ratio of anabolic to <b>androgenic</b> <b>activity,</b> with a similar ratio to that of testosterone (close to 1:1), and this makes it among the most androgenic AAS. Due to efficient aromatization into the potent and metabolism-resistant estrogen methylestradiol (17α-methylestradiol), methyltestosterone has relatively high estrogenicity and hence potential for estrogenic side effects such as gynecomastia and fluid retention. The drug possesses negligible progestogenic activity.|$|E

30|$|The {{performance}} of existing and new structural alerts was evaluated with the collected dataset of estrogenic and <b>androgenic</b> <b>activities</b> in vitro {{based on the}} number of substances with endocrine activity that contain the structural alert (“true positives”) relative to the number of substances without endocrine activity that contain the same structural alert (“false positives”). Table  2 lists the structural alerts together with their occurrences in either active or inactive substances. Generally, a structural alert is considered a relevant EA-ED indicator (X in column “relevance for EA-ED screening”) if it could be found more often in active substances than in inactive substances. An empirical threshold of two-thirds was used to balance between too many “false positives” and too many “false negatives”. A few structural alerts with lower percentage of actives were included when either addressing very potent EA-EDs or covering large numbers of actives. Some structural alerts with high percentage of actives were not included because very similar structural alerts were available with even better performance (see Table  2, for example SA 6 as compared to SA 4 and 5). Some structural alerts could not be evaluated because they are not represented by the chemicals of the collected dataset of estrogenic and <b>androgenic</b> <b>activities</b> in vitro (see Table  2, for example SA 10, 13, 22, 31 b, 36 b).|$|R

2500|$|Due to its weak <b>{{androgenic}}</b> <b>activity,</b> NET {{can produce}} androgenic side effects such as acne, hirsutism, and voice changes of slight severity in some women at high dosages (e.g., 10 to 40mg/day). This is notably {{not the case}} with combined oral contraceptives that contain NET and EE, however. Such formulations contain low dosages of NET (0.35 to 1mg/day) in combination with estrogen and are actually associated with improvement in acne symptoms. In accordance, they are in fact approved by the [...] for the treatment of acne in women in the United States. The improvement in acne symptoms is believed to be due to a 2- to 3-fold increase in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels and a consequent decrease in free testosterone levels caused by EE, which results in an overall decrease in androgenic signaling in the body.|$|E
50|$|Some progestins have <b>{{androgenic}}</b> <b>activity</b> and {{can produce}} androgenic side effects such as acne, hirsutism, and weight gain, {{as well as}} changes in hepatic protein production. Only certain progestins are androgenic however, these being the testosterone (19-nortestosterone and 17α-ethynyltestosterone) derivatives and, to a lesser extent, medroxyprogesterone acetate; no other progestins have such activity (though some, conversely, possess antiandrogen activity (see above)). Moreover, the <b>androgenic</b> <b>activity</b> of progestins within the testosterone derivatives also varies, and while some may have high or moderate <b>androgenic</b> <b>activity,</b> others have only low or no such activity.|$|E
50|$|Extension of the C17α alkyl chain {{longer than}} an ethyl group abolishes <b>androgenic</b> <b>activity</b> and {{converts}} the drug into an antiandrogen, as in topterone (17α-propyltestosterone) and allylestrenol (17α-allyl-3-deketo-19-nortestosterone) (an extended-chain variant of ethylestrenol). Conversely, {{replacement of the}} C17α alkyl group with an ethynyl group greatly reduces but does not abolish <b>androgenic</b> <b>activity,</b> as in ethisterone (17α-ethynyltestosterone) and norethisterone (17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone). Similarly to extension of the C17α alkyl chain, extension of the C17α ethynyl chain abolishes <b>androgenic</b> <b>activity,</b> as with dimethisterone (6α,21-dimethylethisterone). Dienogest, which is antiandrogenic, features extension of the C17α chain {{in the form of}} a cyanomethyl group at the C17α position.|$|E
30|$|For {{application}} to EINECS, the structural alerts (Table  2) {{have been implemented}} in a computerized screening tool (EDC-Scan). 1 To support prediction confidence of the structural alerts in EDC-Scan, their applicability domain (AD) was defined based on atom-centered fragments (ACFs) [32]. The collected dataset of estrogenic and <b>androgenic</b> <b>activities</b> in vitro (see Additional file 1) {{was used as the}} training set for the determination of the AD of the structural alerts. If a chemical is within the AD because it is similar to the substances used to set up the model, predictions are considered most trustworthy.

Mean differences (beta) in 17 beta-estradiol equivalents (EEQs) and dihydrotestosterone equivalents (AEQs) between exposure groups were estimated using general linear models. Mean plasma AEQs and EEQs were 9. 1 x 10 (- 1) ng/ml and 12. 0 pg/ml, respectively. Elevated AEQs were found in smokers (beta 1. 9 (95 %CI 0. 1 - 3. 6) x 10 (- 1) ng/ml) and heavy drinkers (1. 4 (0. 2 - 3. 1) x 10 (- 1) ng/ml), and in men occupationally exposed to disinfectants (1. 6 (0. 3 - 3. 5) x 10 (- 1) ng/ml) or welding/soldering fumes (1. 4 (- 0. 2 - 2. 9) x 10 (- 1) ng/ml).
