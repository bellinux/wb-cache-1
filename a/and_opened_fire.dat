5|$|On 16 December 2014, seven gunmen {{belonging}} to the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) entered an Army Public School in Pakistani city of Peshawar <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>fire</b> on school staff and children, killing 145 people consisting majority of students. The spokesperson of Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, Mohammad Omar Khorasani, took {{the responsibility for the}} attack and said it was revenge for Operation Zarb-e-Azb.|$|E
5|$|Around 02:45, several British destroyers {{mounted a}} torpedo {{attack against the}} rear half of the German line. Markgraf {{initially}} held her fire as {{the identities of the}} destroyers were unknown. But gunners aboard Grosser Kurfürst correctly identified the vessels as hostile <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>fire</b> while turning away to avoid torpedoes, which prompted Markgraf to follow suit. Heavy fire from the German battleships forced the British destroyers to withdraw. At 05:06, Markgraf and several other battleships fired at what they thought was a submarine.|$|E
5|$|At {{approximately}} 1:43p.m. CST (19:43 UTC), Hawkins {{stepped out}} of the elevator on the third floor <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>fire.</b> He killed eight people and wounded four others over the course of six minutes, before dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head near the customer service desk. He fired more than 30 rounds, striking 12 people. Six were killed instantly, one died before reaching the hospital, and another died 45 minutes after reaching the ER of another hospital.|$|E

50|$|As Janice {{is taken}} to a {{detention}} area, two Haydonite soldiers blast into the hallway and confront her. After Janice refuses to cooperate, the soldiers decide she is now expendable. Just then, Scott Bernard appears in combat armor <b>and</b> <b>opens</b> <b>fire,</b> killing one of the soldiers. The remaining soldier then removes his cloak, revealing the true form of the Haydonites. As it flies toward Scott, Grant also in combat armor, appears <b>and</b> <b>opens</b> <b>fire,</b> mortally wounding it. Realizing that Janice was also betrayed by the Haydonites (who now want her dead), Grant asks her to continue to serve with the REF, to which Janice readily agrees.|$|R
50|$|In {{numerous}} occasions, {{small groups}} {{of one of the}} warring parties would progress between enemy positions and UN positions <b>and</b> <b>open</b> <b>fire</b> on the Blue helmets in the hope of triggering a response from the UN troops.|$|R
5|$|Surrounded, he {{told his}} men to die as martyrs, <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>fire.</b> His {{defiance}} and manner of his death (which stunned the traditional leadership) electrified the Palestinian people. Thousands forced their way past police lines at the funeral in Haifa, and the secular Arab nationalist parties invoked his memory as the symbol of resistance. It was the largest political gathering ever to assemble in mandatory Palestine.|$|E
5|$|In 1758, Washington {{participated in}} the Forbes Expedition to capture Fort Duquesne. He was embarrassed by a {{friendly}} fire episode in which his unit and another British unit each thought that {{the other was the}} French enemy <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>fire,</b> with 14 dead and 26 wounded in the mishap. Washington was not involved in any other major fighting on the expedition, and the British scored a major strategic victory, gaining control of the Ohio Valley when the French abandoned the fort. Following the expedition, he retired from his Virginia Regiment commission in December 1758. He did not return to military life until the outbreak of the revolution in 1775.|$|E
5|$|The North Korean {{aircraft}} {{split off}} into two groups, with two climbing rapidly into {{the clouds and}} the remaining three descending. Two F-82s piloted by Lieutenant Charles B. Moran (tail number 46-357) and Lieutenant William G. Hudson (tail number 46-383) followed the ascending pair. The two North Korean aircraft maneuvered around Moran's aircraft <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>fire,</b> damaging the tail of his plane. Hudson responded by attacking the lead plane, forcing it to ascend further. Hudson's shots struck the aircraft in the fuselage and right wing.|$|E
60|$|Jethro {{ordered the}} troops {{who had just}} joined him, all of whom carried bows and arrows, to ascend the walls <b>and</b> <b>open</b> <b>fire</b> upon the {{buildings}} occupied by the Egyptians. Then he with his own band joined Amuba.|$|R
50|$|After riding {{to within}} 36 metres of the Zulu force, Uys ordered {{his men to}} {{dismount}} <b>and</b> <b>open</b> <b>fire.</b> Volleys from the Voortrekkers decimated the first two lines of the impi, while the third turned and fled. The battle appeared won.|$|R
6000|$|... "I should load with {{round shot}} now, Rawlins, <b>and</b> <b>open</b> <b>fire</b> {{into the wood}} {{on both sides of}} the landing-place. The sound of the shot {{crashing}} among the trees will demoralize the scoundrels even if you do not hit anyone." ...|$|R
5|$|The United States Capitol {{shooting}} {{incident of}} 1998 {{was an attack}} on July 24, 1998, {{which led to the}} deaths of two United States Capitol Police officers. Detective John Gibson and Officer Jacob Chestnut were killed when Russell Eugene Weston, Jr., entered the Capitol <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>fire.</b> Chestnut was killed instantly and Gibson died during surgery at George Washington University Hospital. Weston's exact motives are unknown, but he has a mental disorder and maintains a strong distrust of the federal government. He remains in a mental institution due to paranoid schizophrenia and has yet to be tried in court.|$|E
5|$|The attack {{occurred}} at 21:15 on a Wednesday evening, {{as a football}} game featuring Spain and Iceland was being shown. The four participants exited their car carrying shotguns and machine guns <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>fire</b> on the bar. The bullets shattered the skull {{of three of the}} victims and hit the fourth in the heart. Three of the targets were killed instantly, with the fourth dying shortly afterwards in hospital. A fifth person was injured after being hit in the foot, but survived the attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} Vietnam's {{colonisation}} began in 1858 when a Franco-Spanish force landed at Da Nang in central Vietnam {{and attempted to}} proceed to the capital Hue. After becoming tied down, they sailed to the less defended south, targeting Saigon. The southern offensive started on February 10, 1859 with a naval bombardment of Vũng Tàu. Within six days, the Europeans had levelled 12 Vietnamese fortresses and three river barriers. They then sailed along the Saigon River {{to the mouth of}} the Citadel of Saigon <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>fire</b> with naval artillery from close range. The fort was manned by 1,000 soldiers and stored enough rice to feed 10,000 defenders for an entire year.|$|E
50|$|Assailants {{tried to}} enter the {{courthouse}} auto park with their car full of explosives. Security forces identified the vehicle as a threat as it approached a checkpoint, causing the attackers to leave their car, detonate their explosives <b>and</b> <b>open</b> <b>fire</b> with AK-47 rifles.|$|R
50|$|Scott {{stops at}} a {{convenience}} store to relay {{the information to the}} team. Curtis provides him with more ammunition, but Asani, waiting in the car, happens to spot the badge of another agent talking with Curtis <b>and</b> <b>opens</b> <b>fire.</b> Curtis is wounded and Scott has to kill Asani.|$|R
5000|$|The {{formation}} marched {{toward the}} enemy, accompanied by drums, to within 50 m from the enemy's line. There, it halted {{for the third}} and fourth rows of musketeers to aim <b>and</b> <b>open</b> <b>fire.</b> The march continued some 20 m further and halted again for the first and second rows of musketeers to aim <b>and</b> <b>open</b> <b>fire.</b> The zombie like appearance of rapidly approaching Swedes, along with major casualties from the first and second blasts, should induce the enemy to panic and flee, allowing Swedish swords and pikes to kill enemies on the run. It was rare for opposing forces to engage each other in close combat with swords and pikes. [...] Light artillery units were sometimes placed in the gap between battalions - a practice in use {{at the end of the}} Great Northern War.|$|R
5|$|U.S. officials, {{convinced}} that the British Band was hostile, mobilized a frontier militia <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>fire</b> on a delegation from the Native Americans on May 14, 1832. Black Hawk responded by successfully attacking the militia at the Battle of Stillman's Run. He led his band to a secure location {{in what is now}} southern Wisconsin and was pursued by U.S. forces. Meanwhile, other Native Americans conducted raids against forts and settlements largely unprotected with the absence of U.S. troops. Some Ho-Chunk and Potawatomi warriors with grievances against European-Americans took part in these raids, although most tribe members tried to avoid the conflict. The Menominee and Dakota tribes, already at odds with the Sauks and Meskwakis, supported the U.S.|$|E
5|$|A British assault force {{landed on}} the island on 7 February, after which Nelson moved to intensify the {{blockade}} off Bastia. For {{the rest of the}} month he carried out raids along the coast and intercepted enemy shipping. By late February St Fiorenzo had fallen and British troops under Lieutenant-General David Dundas entered the outskirts of Bastia. However, Dundas merely assessed the enemy positions and then withdrew, arguing that the French were too well entrenched to risk an assault. Nelson convinced Hood otherwise, but a protracted debate between the army and naval commanders meant that Nelson did not receive permission to proceed until late March. Nelson began to land guns from his ships and emplace them in the hills surrounding the town. On 11 April the British squadron entered the harbour <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>fire,</b> whilst Nelson took command of the land forces and commenced bombardment. After 45 days, the town surrendered. Nelson subsequently prepared for an assault on Calvi, working in company with Lieutenant-General Charles Stuart.|$|E
5|$|After 17:30 Kamimura led his {{division}} in a fruitless pursuit {{of some of}} the Russian cruisers, leaving Tōgō's battleships to their own devices. He abandoned his chase around 18:03 and turned northwards to rejoin Tōgō. His ships spotted the rear of the Russian battleline around 18:30 <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>fire</b> when the range closed to 8000–9000 meters. Nothing is known of any effect on the Russians and they ceased fire by 19:30 and rejoined Tōgō at 20:08 as night was falling. The surviving Russian ships were spotted the next morning and the Japanese ships opened fire around 10:30, staying beyond the range at which the Russian ships could effectively reply. Rear Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov therefore decided to surrender his ships as he could neither return fire nor close the range.|$|E
50|$|Davids last {{confirmed}} action came on April 18, 1864 {{when she}} tried to sink the screw frigate USS Wabash. Alert lookouts on board the blockader sighted David in time to permit the frigate to slip her chain, avoid the attack, <b>and</b> <b>open</b> <b>fire</b> on the torpedo boat. Neither side suffered any damage.|$|R
50|$|Tonya's father, Carl Lee Hailey, {{contacts}} Jake Brigance, a white lawyer. Brigance {{admits the}} possibility that the rapists will walk free. Carl Lee goes to the county courthouse <b>and</b> <b>opens</b> <b>fire</b> with an automatic rifle, killing both rapists and unintentionally injuring Deputy Looney. Carl Lee is arrested. Brigance agrees to defend Carl Lee.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{are useful}} enough for close work," [...] the sheriff said, [...] "but {{if they see}} us coming, and {{barricade}} their house <b>and</b> <b>open</b> <b>fire</b> upon us, you will want something that carries further than a revolver. I can lend you a rifle {{as well as a}} horse, if you will accept them." ...|$|R
5|$|An {{additional}} Iraqi column {{crossed the}} Saudi border to the East, although still along the coast, towards {{the city of}} Khafji. These Iraqi tanks were screened by the 5th Mechanized Battalion of the 2nd Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigade. This battalion withdrew when it came under heavy fire, {{as it had been}} ordered to not engage the Iraqi column. Elements of the 8th and 10th Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigades also conducted similar screening operations. Due to the order to not engage, the road to Khafji was left open. At one point, Iraqi T-55s of another column rolled up to the Saudi border, signaling that they intended to surrender. As they were approached by Saudi Arabian troops, they reversed their turrets <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>fire.</b> This prompted air support from a nearby AC-130, destroying 13 vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Astorias bridge crew called general {{quarters}} upon sighting the flares {{south of}} Savo, around 01:49. At 01:52, {{shortly after the}} Japanese searchlights came on and shells began falling around the ship, Astorias main gun director crews spotted the Japanese cruisers <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>fire.</b> Astorias captain, awakened to find his ship in action, rushed to the bridge and ordered a ceasefire, fearful that his ship might be firing on friendly forces. As shells continued to cascade around his ship, the captain ordered firing resumed {{less than a minute}} later. Chōkai, however, had found the range, and Astoria was quickly hit by numerous shells and set afire. Between 02:00 and 02:15, Aoba, Kinugasa, and Kako joined Chōkai in pounding Astoria, destroying the cruiser's engine room and bringing the flaming ship to a halt. At 02:16, one of Astorias remaining operational main gun turrets fired at Kinugasas searchlight, but missed and hit Chōkais forward turret, putting the turret out of action and causing moderate damage to the ship.|$|E
5|$|At 05:00 on 13 April Stopford {{gave the}} order for the inshore {{squadron}} to withdraw back to Gambier's fleet. Cochrane was again furious, and even suggested taking Imperieuse and Indefatigable on a desperate attack on the still-grounded Océan. Captain John Tremayne Rodd on the latter refused. Frustrated, Cochrane remained in the anchorage, joined by Pallas and the smaller vessels as the larger ships returned to more open waters. At 08:00 he ordered a renewed attack on the remaining grounded ships {{at the mouth of}} the Charente, and by 11:00 the small vessels were in position <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>fire</b> on the French flagship. Although Aetnas gun split, forcing her withdrawal, the barrage otherwise continued throughout the day, although to little effect. It was not until 16:00 when the battered Océan and Régulus, most of their stores thrown overboard, were able to safely retreat towards the mouth of the Charente.|$|E

50|$|Strolling down to Claphands' warehouse, Doc and Val {{draw their}} pistols <b>and</b> <b>open</b> <b>fire.</b> A firefight commences, during which Doc and Val shoot at Claphands and his men, killing {{both of the}} latter. A firefight between them and Claphands ensues. The camera pans above the building, and the sky turns into one of Doc's sunrise paintings.|$|R
5|$|At 05:00 {{the leading}} British ship, HMS Monarch, was within range <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>fire</b> on the French squadron, which divided. One frigate went north and was intercepted by HMS Mars, while another, {{accompanied}} by the two corvettes, turned south and managed to outrun HMS Windsor Castle. The {{main body of the}} French force remained together and met the attack of Monarch and the British flagship HMS Centaur with their broadsides. Although outnumbered and outclassed by the British squadron the French ships fought hard, inflicting damage on the leading British ships and severely wounding Commodore Hood. Eventually the strength of the British squadron told, and despite a fierce resistance the French ships surrendered one by one, the British capturing four of the seven vessels in the squadron.|$|E
5|$|At age 76, Librescu {{was among}} the 32 people who were murdered in the Virginia Tech shooting. On April 16, 2007, Seung-Hui Cho entered the Norris Hall Engineering Building <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>fire</b> on classrooms. Librescu, who taught a solid {{mechanics}} class in Room 204 in the Norris Hall during April 2007, held {{the door of his}} classroom shut while the gunman attempted to enter it. Although he was shot through the door, Librescu managed to prevent the gunman from entering the classroom until most of his students had escaped through the windows. He was struck by five bullets, with a shot to the head proving to be fatal. Of the 23 registered students in his class, only one, Minal Panchal, died.|$|E
5|$|Check's 1st Battalion was not {{attacked}} until 06:30 on July 24, {{shortly after}} daybreak {{in a heavy}} fog that allowed the North Koreans to approach {{very close to the}} US positions before they were observed. Two US infantry companies {{on either side of the}} road on low ridges held the forward positions. North Korean mortar fire fell on the men there, and then T-34 tanks appeared at the bend in the road <b>and</b> <b>opened</b> <b>fire</b> with their main cannons and machine guns as they approached. North Korean infantry followed the tanks. Although the two rifle companies stopped the North Korean infantry, the tanks penetrated their positions and fired into the battalion command post which was behind B Company. This tank fire destroyed several vehicles and killed the medical officer. A company commander knocked out one tank but was injured in the process.|$|E
