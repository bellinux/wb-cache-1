5|$|The primary {{wildlife}} reservoirs for Trypanosoma cruzi in the United States include opossums, raccoons, armadillos, squirrels, woodrats, <b>and</b> <b>mice.</b> Opossums {{are particularly}} important as reservoirs, because the parasite can complete its life cycle in the anal glands of this animal without having to re-enter the insect vector. Recorded prevalence of the disease in opossums in the U.S. ranges from 8.3% to 37.5%.|$|E

5|$|According to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), {{the total}} number of animals used in the US during 2015 was 820,812, down from almost 1.2 million in 2005, however, this number does not include rats <b>and</b> <b>mice,</b> which make up around 90% of {{research}} animals. By comparing with EU data, where all vertebrate species are counted, Speaking of Research estimated that around 12 million vertebrates were used in research in the US in 2016. A 2015 article published in the Journal of Medical Ethics, argued that the use of animals in the US has dramatically increased in recent years. Researchers found this increase is largely the result of an increased reliance on genetically modified mice in animal studies.|$|E
5|$|Any {{of these}} {{conditions}} that occurs in a family can indicate a diagnosis of Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome, though it is only confirmed by a genetic test for a mutation in the FLCN gene, which codes for the protein folliculin. Though its function is not fully understood, {{it appears to be}} a tumor suppressor gene that restricts cell growth and division. Versions of FLCN have been found in other animals, including fruit flies, German shepherds, rats, <b>and</b> <b>mice.</b> The disease was discovered in 1977, but the connection with FLCN was not elucidated until 2002, after kidney cancer, collapsed lungs, and pulmonary cysts were all definitively connected to BHD.|$|E
5|$|Coloured {{gold and}} green, the frogs are {{voracious}} eaters of insects, {{but will also}} eat larger prey, such as worms <b>and</b> <b>mice.</b> Unlike most frogs, they are active at day, although this is mostly to warm in the sun.

Males reach maturity after around 9 months, while for the larger females, this does not occur until they are two years old. The frogs can engage in cannibalism, and males frequently attack and injure one another if they infringe on one another's space.|$|E

40|$|Background: The choroid plexus {{epithelium}} (CPE) is a lobed neuro-epithelial {{structure that}} forms the outer blood-brain barrier. The CPE protrudes into the brain ventricles and produces the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is crucial for brain homeostasis. Malfunction of the CPE is possibly implicated in disorders like Alzheimer disease, hydrocephalus or glaucoma. To study human genetic diseases and potential new therapies, mouse models are widely used. This requires a detailed knowledge of similarities and differences in gene expression and functional annotation between the species. The {{aim of this study}} is to analyze and compare gene expression and functional annotation of healthy human <b>and</b> <b>mouse</b> CPE. Methods: We performed 44 k Agilent microarray hybridizations with RNA derived from laser dissected healthy human <b>and</b> <b>mouse</b> CPE cells. We functionally annotated and compared the gene expression data of human <b>and</b> <b>mouse</b> CPE using the knowledge database Ingenuity. We searched for common and species specific gene expression patterns and function between human <b>and</b> <b>mouse</b> CPE.

5|$|Genes {{related to}} FLCN and {{diseases}} similar to BHD {{have been found}} in dogs, fruit flies, rats, <b>and</b> <b>mice.</b> In German Shepherd dogs, missense mutations in the canine ortholog of FLCN cause a similar phenotype to human BHD—kidney cancers (in this case, mutifocal renal cystadenocarcinoma) and skin tumors (nodular dermatofibrosis). They had a similar pattern of tumorigenesis to human BHD in that the skin lesions were heterozygous for the FLCN mutation and the renal tumors were likely caused by loss of heterozygosity. Female German shepherds with a FLCN mutation are also prone to uterine leiomyomas.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the Scottish Terrier can make a good watchdog due to its tendency to bark only when necessary and because it is typically reserved with strangers, although this is not always the case.

Therefore, the Scottie is prone to dig as well as chase small vermin, such as squirrels, rats, <b>and</b> <b>mice.</b>|$|E

5|$|Noronhomys vespuccii, {{also known}} as Vespucci's rodent, is an extinct rat species from the islands of Fernando de Noronha off northeastern Brazil.

5|$|Rodents may be born either altricial (blind, hairless and {{relatively}} underdeveloped) or precocial (mostly furred, {{eyes open and}} fairly developed) depending on the species. The altricial state is typical for squirrels <b>and</b> <b>mice,</b> while the precocial state usually occurs in species like guinea pigs and porcupines. Females with altricial young typically build elaborate nests before they give birth and maintain them until their offspring are weaned. The female gives birth sitting or lying down and the young emerge in the direction she is facing. The newborns first venture out of the nest {{a few days after}} they have opened their eyes and initially keep returning regularly. As they get older and more developed, they visit the nest less often and leave permanently when weaned.|$|E

40|$|We {{identified}} the most frequent, variable-length DNA sequence motifs {{in the human}} <b>and</b> <b>mouse</b> genomes <b>and</b> sub-selected those with multiple recurrences in the intergenic and intronic regions {{and at least one}} additional exonic instance in the corresponding genome. We discovered that these motifs have virtually no overlap with intronic sequences that are conserved between human <b>and</b> <b>mouse,</b> <b>and</b> thus are genome-specific. Moreover, we found that these motifs span a substantial fraction of previously uncharacterized human <b>and</b> <b>mouse</b> intronic space. Surprisingly, we found that these genome-specific motifs are over-represented in the introns of genes belonging to the same biological processes and molecular functions in both the human <b>and</b> <b>mouse</b> genomes even though the underlying sequences are not conserved between the two genomes. In fact, the processes and functions that are linked to these genome-specific sequence-motifs are distinct from the processes and functions which are associated with intronic regions that are conserved between human <b>and</b> <b>mouse.</b> The findings show that intronic regions from different genomes are linked to the same processes and functions in the absence of underlying sequence conservation.

5|$|Some rodent {{species are}} serious {{agricultural}} pests, eating {{large quantities of}} food stored by humans. For example, in 2003, the amount of rice lost to mice and rats in Asia {{was estimated to be}} enough to feed 200 million people. Most of the damage worldwide is caused by {{a relatively small number of}} species, chiefly rats <b>and</b> <b>mice.</b> In Indonesia and Tanzania, rodents reduce crop yields by around fifteen percent, while in some instances in South America losses have reached ninety percent. Across Africa, rodents including Mastomys and Arvicanthis damage cereals, groundnuts, vegetables and cacao. In Asia, rats, mice and species such as Microtus brandti, Meriones unguiculatus and Eospalax baileyi damage crops of rice, sorghum, tubers, vegetables and nuts. In Europe, as well as rats <b>and</b> <b>mice,</b> species of Apodemus, Microtus and in occasional outbreaks Arvicola terrestris cause damage to orchards, vegetables and pasture as well as cereals. In South America, a wider range of rodent species, such as Holochilus, Akodon, Calomys, Oligoryzomys, Phyllotis, Sigmodon and Zygodontomys, damage many crops including sugar cane, fruits, vegetables, and tubers.|$|E
