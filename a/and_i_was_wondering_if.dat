6000|$|... "I am {{not quite}} worn out; {{but is it}} not an unfair question, {{considering}} my present employment? This skein is getting mixed, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> you {{would allow me to}} help you in straightening it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well--"--Jno. Peters coughed tactfully--"I {{see that}} you are engaged with a client, Mr. Samuel, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> any little point of law had arisen with which you did not feel {{yourself}} quite capable of coping, in which case I might perhaps be of assistance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah. I {{heard from}} Brander {{that she was}} shut up there, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> whether you had run against her. He is very savage at what he calls her vagaries. Did she get through the {{starvation}} all right?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sometimes when I'm {{alone in}} the bush I think of God. Mr Young has been {{talking to me about}} Him lately, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>and</b> wanting to know more about Him. Do you know {{anything}} about Him, father?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are like}} two fires of green weeds in a mealie patch, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>wondering</b> which {{of you will}} be the first to break into flame or whether you will both be choked by the reek of your own thoughts." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know that}} I'm {{very proud of}} the part I played," [...] and though Courthorne smiled there was a faint flush in his face. [...] "Still, you see, I hadn't a dollar then, and what could I do? Any way, that's done with, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> you would let me congratulate you. Potter seems to be a general favorite." ...|$|E
6000|$|Miss Deringham seemed thoughtful. The man's grim code of honour, {{inflexible}} {{as it was}} primitive, caused her, for {{no apparent}} reason, indefinite misgivings, and she made a little gesture of weariness. [...] "I think," [...] she said, [...] "it {{would be better if}} we did not talk of Carnaby, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> {{it would be possible to}} catch a trout if there is a little more wind presently." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{looked at}} him more closely. He was superlatively well-built, light, and lithe and strong; he was well-featured; his yellow eyes were very large, though, perhaps, not very expressive; take him altogether, he was a pleasant-looking lad, and I had no fault to find with him, beyond that he was of a dusky hue, and {{inclined}} to hairiness; two characteristics that I disliked. It was his mind that puzzled, and yet attracted me. The doctor's phrase--an innocent--came back to me; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> that were, after all, the true description, when the road began to go down into the narrow and naked chasm of a torrent. The waters thundered tumultuously in the bottom; and the ravine was filled full of the sound, the thin spray, and the claps of wind, that accompanied their descent. The scene was certainly impressive; but the road was in that part very securely walled in; the mule went steadily forward; and I was astonished to perceive the paleness of terror {{in the face of}} my companion. The voice of that wild river was inconstant, now sinking lower as if in weariness, now doubling its hoarse tones; momentary freshets seemed to swell its volume, sweeping down the gorge, raving and booming against the barrier walls; and I observed it was at each of these accessions to the clamour that my driver more particularly winced and blanched. Some thoughts of Scottish superstition and the river-kelpie passed across my mind; I wondered if perchance the like were prevalent in that part of Spain; and turning to Felipe, sought to draw him out.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{were many}} queer things inside, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> {{what they could}} be {{when all of a}} sudden I saw him. He was lying down, and there was {{something}} the matter with him. I tapped on the window to him <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> hurried back here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We've {{just come}} on a visit, you know," [...] said Ozma. [...] "Both Dorothy <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>wondering</b> how we should pass the day when we {{happened}} to think we'd not been to your Quadling Country for weeks, so we took the Sawhorse and rode straight here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Before {{you can go}} out on {{the road}} and learn the more {{complicated}} and higher details of the profession," [...] he said, [...] "you will, of course, have to work in the car-house with the men who install and repair the motors. (By this time <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sure that it <b>was</b> his daughter, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> how much stock he might own in the company.) ...|$|R
5000|$|This was the band's {{favourite}} song {{to perform}} live, as lead singer Richard Archer said, [...] "'Hard to Beat' is going crazy at the moment. We were in Bristol yesterday <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> {{my voice was}} going to last on tour, but the crowd sings it for me, so that's going well. But the most fun playing is probably 'Unnecessary Trouble', that's always a good laugh, and 'Living for the Weekend' is the last number, so is a high energy one, but after last night, Hard To Beat." ...|$|E

Thanks a lot as it sure does come in handy. They say that Maryland is in the South, {{but as far as the}} weather is concerned, the state may as well be called part of the North. I would have been up to see you while on my furlough, but it came on the Thanksgiving holiday and you were all on a furlough too. My address is still the same as you have it listed, and you can rest assured that I 2 ̆ 7 m trying my best to help win the battle of Aberdeen. By the way, Ed Rosner 2 ̆ 7 s mother passed away <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> the club would please send him a little card. It would mean so much to him and I know it would make him feel a little better. I have been corresponding with some of the fellows thanks to the addresses you sent me, and I was surprised to learn that Hockey and Jimmy were in England. (Lucky fellows) Well, THANKS AGAIN, and I hope it won 2 ̆ 7 t be long before we 2 ̆ 7 ll all be back in school again. P. S. You sure will have to change our dorm back to Scott House again first. Pfc.

"In {{conversation}} with Nathaniel Butler I learned {{that you were}} in charge of the open lectures of the summer term at the Universtiy, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>wondering</b> whether you cannot use me for another series similar to the one I gave several years ago.

6000|$|We breakfasted as silently on {{his part}} as we had supped, but when we had finished, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> what he <b>was</b> {{going to let me}} do with myself, and on the whole what the deuce I had come for, he said, in the longest speech I had yet had from him, [...] "Wouldn't you like to come up and see what I've been doing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Egad, Richard," [...] said my Lord, {{when we had}} got to my lodgings, [...] "I {{made him}} change colour, did I not? Do {{you know how the}} little fool looks to me? 'Od's life, he looks hunted, and cursed near brought to earth. We must fetch this thing to a point, Richard. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>wondering</b> what Chartersea's next move will be," [...] he added thoughtfully.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] he said, [...] "I don't know; but, after all, it wouldn't {{be worth}} while our raising wheat here unless there were folks back East to eat it, and {{if some of}} them only eat it {{in the shape of}} dainty cakes that doesn't affect the question. Anyway, there's only another dance or two, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> whether <b>I</b> could drive you home; I've got Wyllard's Ontario sleigh." ...|$|R
60|$|It was a {{question}} of mental equipment that was on the carpet, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> still <b>wondering</b> whether he meant what he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had noticed}} {{there was a}} kind of a village back of the beach, and enough scenery to outfit a dozen moving-picture shows. But I thought, of course, it was a cannibal suburb, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> whether <b>I</b> <b>was</b> to be served with carrots or mushrooms. <b>And,</b> as <b>I</b> say, this dressed-up man sits beside me, and we become friends in the space of a minute or two. For an hour we talked, and he told me all about it.|$|R
60|$|While Robertson <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>wondering</b> what {{we should}} do with the poor old {{creature}} whom it seemed cruel to leave here to perish, she cleared up the question by suddenly expiring before our eyes. Uttering the name of someone with whom, doubtless, she had been familiar in her youth, three or four times over, she just sank down and seemed to go to sleep and on examination we found that she was dead. So we left her and went on.|$|R
6000|$|... "Naturally, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{somewhat}} abashed," [...] {{he said in}} {{the account}} he was presently called to give Isabel of the interview, [...] "but I remembered that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> an American citizen, and tried to maintain a decent composure. For several minutes we sat silent behind a dish of flabby cucumbers, expecting the dinner, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> whether <b>I</b> should address him in French or German,--for I knew you'd never forgive me if I let slip such a chance,--when he turned and spoke himself." ...|$|R

60|$|But, {{sitting at}} work, {{not far from}} Doctor Strong, was a very pretty young lady--whom he called Annie, and who <b>was</b> his daughter, <b>I</b> supposed--who got {{me out of my}} {{difficulty}} by kneeling down to put Doctor Strong's shoes on, and button his gaiters, which she did with great cheerfulness and quickness. When she had finished, and we were going out to the schoolroom, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> much surprised to hear Mr. Wickfield, in bidding her good morning, address her as 'Mrs. Strong'; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> could she <b>be</b> Doctor Strong's son's wife, or could she be Mrs. Doctor Strong, when Doctor Strong himself unconsciously enlightened me.|$|R
6000|$|The boys {{resumed their}} seats. 'Your mamma <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>wondering</b> what you boys are to become, {{and we do}} not see any {{openings}} likely to occur here. Now, what should you say to us all emigrating?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{had been}} {{at work on a}} big double-sheet sketch, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> what people would think of it at home. The sight of that field taught me a good deal. It looked just like a bed of horrible toadstools in all colours, and--I'd never seen men in bulk go back to their {{beginnings}} before. So I began to understand that men and women were only material to work with, and that what they said or did was of no consequence. See? Strictly speaking, you might just as well put your ear down to the palette to catch what your colours are saying.' ...|$|R

"My father <b>and</b> mother, <b>I</b> mean," [...] I {{explained}} in some confusion, [...] "were just of the com--of the ordinary size. <b>And</b> what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>is,</b> whether you yourself would be sorry--in quite a general way, of course--if you found your practice going down like that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can assure}} you that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> eminently respectable, but find other respectable people tiresome."

5000|$|... “We were in {{the worst}} {{physical}} condition {{we have been in}} the season <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> still <b>wondering</b> how some of them stayed in there as well as they did.

6000|$|... "I thank you, indeed," [...] Malcolm replied.

60|$|The {{house of}} Shaws stood some five full storeys high, not {{counting}} lofts.

If <b>I</b> did not cry out, it was because fear had me by the throat; <b>and</b> if <b>I</b> did not fall, it was more by Heaven's mercy than my own strength. It was not only that the flash shone in on every side through breaches in the wall, so that <b>I</b> seemed to <b>be</b> clambering aloft upon an open scaffold, but the same passing brightness showed me the steps were of unequal length, and that one of my feet rested that moment within two inches of the well.|$|R
