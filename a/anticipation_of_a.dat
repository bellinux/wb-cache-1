On September25, a special advisory was issued for Bermuda as tropical storm-force winds were likely to impact the island. Following the unexpected intensification, another special advisory was issued stating that hurricane-force winds would impact the island during the day on September25.

5|$|In the meantime, the company's former test pilot, Lou Leavitt, had {{purchased}} {{the wreckage of}} the XR-1A at a price of 4 cents per pound.

5|$|The First Ostend Raid on 23 April 1918 {{was largely}} a failure, the blockships {{grounded}} {{too far from the}} channels to obstruct them. The second attempt also failed, due to heavy German resistance and British navigational difficulties in poor weather. In <b>anticipation</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> raid, the Germans had removed the navigation buoys and without them the British had difficulty finding the narrow channel into the harbour in poor weather. When they did discover the entrance, German resistance proved too strong for the operation to be completed as originally planned: the obsolete cruiser HMS Vindictive was sunk, but only partially blocked the channel.|$|E
