25|$|In particular, Equity Theory {{research}} has tested employee sentiments regarding equitable compensation. Employee inputs {{take the form}} of work volume and quality, performance, knowledge, skills, attributes and behaviors. The company-generated outcomes include rewards such as compensation, praise and <b>advancement</b> <b>opportunities.</b> The employee compares his inputs relative to outcomes; and, then, extrapolating to the social context, the employee compares his input/outcome ratio with the perceived ratios of others. If the employee perceives an inequity, the theory posits that the employee will adjust his behavior to bring things into balance.|$|E
25|$|As Commodore Commandant of the Coast Guard one of Reynolds first {{concerns}} was {{a renewed}} {{effort by the}} Navy to control the Coast Guard by congressional action and a bill was introduced by Pennsylvania Representative Guy Campbell to accomplish a transfer to the Navy.

Traditional rewards for participation include personal development or <b>advancement</b> <b>opportunity,</b> cash bonus, or non-financial rewards. Not all ERGs give tangible rewards, as participation and engagement are desirable from the start.|$|R
25|$|Edge's {{second term}} as {{governor}} {{was marked by}} numerous battles with Hague. In 1944, Edge and Hague fought over how certain railroad tax money should be allocated (with Hague’s position ultimately prevailing), while Edge won the passage of legislation that required the use of voting machines in Hudson County to reduce the chance of electoral fraud. Edge also obtained legislation authorizing the governor to appoint jury commissioners for each county, bypassing county sheriffs, who had previously hand-picked grand jurors who they knew would refuse to indict those engaged in illegal activities protected by political bosses like Hague. The most important battle between Edge and Hague involved constitutional revision. In early 1944, Republican legislators drafted a new proposed constitution that would have, among other things, deprived Hague of {{a major source of}} patronage by restructuring the judiciary. Hague strongly opposed the revised constitution, and several weeks prior to the November 1944 election he launched a multi-pronged attack on it, charging that it would restrict the activities of labor unions, inhibit <b>advancement</b> <b>opportunities</b> for returning veterans, and subject all church owned property to taxation. Voters rejected the proposed constitution.|$|E
500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1780 the {{regiment}} was headquartered at Nelson's Point in Garrison, New York, directly across the Hudson River from West Point, before entering winter quarters at Fishkill, New York, in November. [...] During this time eleven officers of the regiment, led by Major James Reid, complained to General Washington (without first consulting Hazen) over the lack of <b>advancement</b> <b>opportunities</b> in the regiment, which were {{due in part to}} its unusual position as being the direct responsibility of Congress, rather than under a state's supervision. [...] Reid also made complaints against Hazen, which were heard and dismissed in a November 1780 court martial. [...] Hazen had Reid arrested and confined to quarters afterwards; a long court martial (running from December 1780 to February 1781) resulted in Reid's conviction on two counts and a public reprimand by General Washington.|$|E

[...] In some cases, EMDs may choose to retrain and move to fire dispatch (EFD), to police dispatch (EPD), or to the 9-1-1 call centre. [...] The inequities in the sheer amount of training required for certification make advancement of EMDs to paramedic status an extremely infrequent event. [...] The required additional training, depending on the jurisdiction, might take two years or more, part-time, in addition to regular full-time employment, putting this option beyond the reach of all but the most determined. Typically, EMDs who are also certified paramedics tend to have been paramedics first.|$|E
