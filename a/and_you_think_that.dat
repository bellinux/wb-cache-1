500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Unapologetic Bitch" [...] {{talks about}} a scorned lover rediscovering their inner strength, with Madonna [...] "shooting a few poison arrows {{into the heart of}} some dude who's done her wrong," [...] as noted by Rolling Stone Rob Sheffield. During the song, she {{repeatedly}} labels an ex's bad behavior as [...] "bullshit" [...] and tells him, [...] "fuck you". In another part, she mocks, [...] "When we did it, I'll admit it, wasn't satisfied." [...] In the chorus, she sings: [...] "It might sound like I’m an unapologetic bitch / but sometimes you know I gotta call I like it is." [...] The song was allegedly written about Madonna's ex-boyfriend Brahim Zaibat. She told Rolling Stone that the song [...] "it's like, fuck you, I'm going to have fun. You think you're going to ruin my life <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it's over for me, but guess what? It's not. Life goes on." [...] While commenting to Billboard over the usage of the word [...] "bitch" [...] numerous times in two songs from the album, Madonna explained: ...|$|E

"Age of Reason" [...] was {{composed}} by Todd Hunter and partner Johanna Pigott, {{who had previously}} written the song [...] "Rain" [...] for Dragon and played together in the XL Capris. Pigott said, [...] "You write songs and you're surprised at what <b>you</b> wrote sometimes, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>think,</b> goodness, is <b>that</b> me, did I do that? It's not something you consider of perfect taste or anything, and someone records them <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> fantastic. It's a really exciting and thrilling thing." ...|$|R

She is tame and quiet,--a cat that will {{sleep on the}} rug before the fire, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> she will never scratch. Do not suppose that I mean to abuse her. She was my dear friend before you had ever seen her. And men, I know, have tastes which we women do not understand. You want what you call--repose." ...|$|E
60|$|JENNIFER. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> is your doing. Oh doctor, doctor! Sir Patrick is right: you {{do think}} you are a little god. How {{can you be so}} silly? You did not paint those {{pictures}} which are my imperishable joy and pride: you did not speak the words that will always be heavenly music in my ears.

"I {{care not}} greatly for the flapjack, nor {{yet for the}} dried apples," [...] said Victor, whom the {{intelligent}} reader has at once recognised, [...] "but a single cup of coffee sweetened by those glances and offered by those fair hands--which I kiss!--are to me enough. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the Meestrees Conroy does not live happily with her husband.

6000|$|She {{looked at}} him with perplexed eyes. [...] "I know you are vexed with me, Dick, and it is because the first Sunday I have curls and a hat and feather since I have been here happens to be the very day you are away and won't be with me. Yes, say it is, for that is it! <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> all this week I ought to have remembered you wouldn't be here to- day, and not have cared to be better dressed than usual. Yes, you do, Dick, and it is rather unkind!" ...|$|E

[...] Yet Mary Snow was not younger than Madeline Staveley. [...] "You {{have been told to}} love me; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> you do love me because you wish to do what you think to be your duty. But I believe that people can never really love each other merely because they are told to do so. Of course I cannot say what sort of a young man Mr. Fitzallen may be; but if I find that he is fit to take care of you, and that he has means to support you,--with such little help as I can give,--I shall be very happy to promote such an arrangement." ...|$|E

60|$|What a sweet {{time we had}} together. I shall never, {{never forget}} it! O Frank, how good you are to me! And how I hope you won't regret what you are doing. It is all very well just now, when I am young <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I am pretty. I love that you should think so, but I am {{compelled}} {{to tell you that}} it is not really so. I can't imagine how you came to think it! I suppose it was from seeing me so often beside papa. If you saw me near Nelly Sheridan, or any other REALLY pretty girl, you would at once see the difference. It just happens that you like grey eyes and brown hair, and the other things, {{but that does not mean}} that I am really pretty. I should be so sorry if there were any misunderstanding about this, and you only found out when too late. You ought to keep this letter for reference, as papa always says, and then it will be interesting to you afterwards.|$|E
60|$|By and by to the {{elephant}} stables, and I took a ride; {{but it was}} by request--I {{did not ask for}} it, and didn't want it; but I took it, because otherwise they would have thought I was afraid, which I was. The elephant kneels down, by command--one end of him at a time--and you climb the ladder and get into the howdah, and then he gets up, one end at a time, just as a ship gets up over a wave; and after that, as he strides monstrously about, his motion is much like a ship's motion. The mahout bores into {{the back of his head}} with a great iron prod and you wonder at his temerity and at {{the elephant}}'s patience, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> perhaps the patience will not last; but it does, and nothing happens. The mahout talks to the elephant in a low voice all the time, and the elephant seems to understand it all and to be pleased with it; and he obeys every order in the most contented and docile way. Among these twenty-five elephants were two which were larger than any I had ever seen before, and if I had thought I could learn to not be afraid, I would have taken one of them while the police were not looking.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{flashed through}} my mind at once, Paolo; but at present neither file, rope, nor {{disguise}} would be of any use. However, they may be so later. The first {{thing for you to}} do when you get this pass will be to make yourself master of the plan of the town and the fortifications, and see if there is any place where you think an escape is possible. But even when you find one, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> it might be managed, you must afterwards find a place where I can be hidden for a time, at any rate for a few hours. You see, were I to go out in disguise I must do so in broad daylight, for my supper is served almost directly after the gates are closed; and were I missing there would be a search for me at once, the sentries on the wall would all be warned, and {{it would be impossible to}} get past them. If I could get out two or three hours before the gates are closed at nine o'clock I might, as soon as it became dark, attempt to get over the walls before the alarm was given, or I might possibly go out in the same disguise that I left here in, through the city gate and across the bridge." ...|$|E
6000|$|I seized her {{reluctant}} hand--"Dear friend," [...] I cried, [...] "misguided victim, do you {{not intend}} to escape with me?
