In 1912, shortly after the founding of the Republic of China, the mine went bankrupt and the owners fled, cheating Peng out of half his <b>annual</b> <b>wages.</b> Peng returned home in 1912 and took a number of odd jobs. In 1913 Hunan suffered another drought, and Peng participated in a public demonstration that escalated into the seizure of a grain merchant's storehouse, and the redistribution of grain among the peasants. Village police issued a warrant for Peng's arrest, and he fled to northern Hunan, where he worked for two years as a construction laborer {{for the construction of a}} dam near Dongting Lake. When the dam was completed, in 1916, Peng assumed that he was no longer in danger of being arrested and returned home, joining the army of a local Kuomintang-aligned warlord, Tang Xiangming.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method to {{estimate}} the truncated right tail of the <b>annual</b> <b>wage</b> and salary income distribution 2 using {{the rest of the}} distribution. The right tail of the wage and salary income distribution is the distribution of earners over large wage and salary incomes. See figure 1. The metaphor of regenerating a tail that has been cut off suggests the name of this paper’s model: the Salamander. The model is in need of a name more compact than “a mixture of gamma probability density functions (pdfs) with parameters quite restricted in a particular way”. The U. S. Bureau of the Census masks, or 3 “topcodes”, large <b>annual</b> <b>wage</b> and salary incomes in public use microdata samples (PUMS) of the March Current Population Survey (CPS) (Weinberg, Nelson, Roemer, and Welniak, 1999) and other household surveys and censuses to prevent the disclosure of the identity of respondents reporting large incomes. The Federal Committee on Statistical Methodology (FCSM, 1994 : 62) sees a growing risk of disclosure of the identity of respondents whose data appear in a PUMS particularly those with rare traits, such as large incomes. Angle and Tolbert (1999) discuss the impact of topcoding on the analysis of <b>annual</b> <b>wage</b> and salary income data in the PUMS of the March, CPS. The Salamander was developed to estimate statistics of <b>annual</b> <b>wage</b> and salary income from a PUMS despite topcoding which effectively truncates the right tail of the <b>annual</b> <b>wage</b> and salary income distribution at the minimum topcodeable income...|$|R

40|$|The {{principal}} {{objectives of}} this study were to chronicle the hybrid approach to data collection adopted to formulate a regional economic overview of the Robson Valley Forest District (RVFD), and to summarize a suite of baseline economic indicators relevant to the forestry, visitor, public, and agriculture sectors in the RVFD region. Secondary data collection was augmented with primary data collected through formal and informal survey techniques. Data were collected for traditional economic indicators, such as gross revenue, employment, and income. The forestry sector is the largest contributor to the regional economy. It provides the highest estimates of average <b>annual</b> <b>wage</b> (ranging from $ 46 975 to $ 64 007), number of employment positions (574 jobs including full-time and part-time or seasonal positions), and total revenue ($ 74. 1 million).
