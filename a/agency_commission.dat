The footnote claimed that because Istanbul did not make such a payment, the bid lost the support of Lamine Diack.

5000|$|In reality, {{the high}} {{turnover}} rate among these commissioners or board members means that most presidents {{have the opportunity}} to fill enough vacancies to constitute a voting majority on each independent <b>agency</b> <b>commission</b> within {{the first two years of}} the first term as president. In some famous instances, presidents have found the independent agencies more loyal and in lockstep with the president's wishes and policy objectives than some dissenters among the executive agency political appointments. [...] Presidential attempts to remove independent agency officials have generated most of the important Supreme Court legal opinions in this area. Presidents normally do have the authority to remove heads of independent agencies, but they must meet the statutory requirements for removal, such as demonstrating that the individual has committed malfeasance. In contrast, the president can remove regular executive agency heads at will.|$|E
5000|$|In the February 2004 {{report that}} prefaced the Gomery Commission, Auditor General Sheila Fraser said the Sponsorship Program created in 1997 by the Jean Chrétien {{government}} {{was designed to}} generate commissions for private companies—while hiding {{the source of the}} funding—rather than to provide any benefit for Canadians. One of the offenders, Canada Post, was asked why it paid $1,625,000 to a production company, L'Information essentielle Inc. to produce a television series on Maurice Richard, despite the fact that no contract was signed and there was no documentation provided to show how the corporation would benefit. Robert Scully was part owner and the executive producer of L'Information essentielle Inc. In another instance of questionable money transfers, Fraser's audit showed that Via Rail Canada Inc. was used by Lafleur Communication Marketing to handle the transfer of nearly $1 million towards the same television series on Maurice Richard, using what the auditor general called a [...] "fictitious contract." [...] Via was reimbursed all but $160,000 of the money; of that, Lafleur kept $112,500 as an <b>agency</b> <b>commission.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the 2013-14 season, Immers {{continued}} to be a first team regular and was preferred in the attacking midfield {{since the start of the}} season. He scored his first goal for the club on 15 September 2013, as well as, providing one of the goals, in a 3-3 draw against NEC. By the end of 2013, he scored six goals, including Go Ahead Eagles, and PEC Zwolle (twice). As a result, on 24 October 2013, it was announced that Feyenoord hired Immers the first two years to avoid paying an <b>agency</b> <b>commission.</b> Immers went on to score five more goals and scored two goals in two matches on two occasions; one was between 4 February 2014 and 8 February 2014 against Roda JC, and NEC, while another was between 16 March 2014 and 30 March 2014 against Heerenveen Go Ahead Eagles.At the end of the 2013-14 season, having missed one match, due to suspension, Immers went on to make thirty-eight appearances and scoring twelve times in all competitions. Although he was linked a move away from the club, Immers ended the transfer speculation by signing a contract extension, keeping him until 2017.|$|E

50|$|The {{inspectors}} {{feared that}} Taha's team had experimented on human beings. During one inspection, they discovered two primate-sized inhalation chambers, one measuring 5 cubic meters, {{though there was}} no evidence the Iraqis had used large primates in their experiments. According to former weapons inspector Scott Ritter in his 1999 book Endgame: Solving the Iraq Crisis, UNSCOM learned that, between July 1 and August 15, 1995, 50 prisoners from the Abu Ghraib prison were transferred to a military post in al-Haditha, in the northwest of Iraq. Iraqi opposition groups say that scientists sprayed the prisoners with anthrax, though no evidence was produced to support these allegations. During one experiment, the inspectors were told, 12 prisoners were tied to posts while shells loaded with anthrax were blown up nearby. Ritter's team demanded to see documents from Abu Ghraib prison showing a prisoner count. Ritter writes that they discovered the records for July and August 1995 were missing. Asked to explain the missing documents, the Iraqi government charged that Ritter was working for the CIA and refused UNSCOM access to certain sites like Baath Party headquarters. Although Ekéus has said that he resisted attempts at such espionage, many allegations have since been made against the <b>agency</b> <b>commission</b> under Butler, charges which Butler has denied.|$|E
50|$|Although the use {{of video}} and film has often been {{incorporated}} as an element of Deacon’s live work, several of his projects explored these mediums in their own right. His early video pieces were short, single channel video works such as What is a Performance Artist? (2005), a compilation of uses of the word ‘performance art’ or ‘performance artist’ in popular cultural contexts such as cinema and television. In 2005, he received a Live Art Development <b>Agency</b> <b>commission</b> for the film They Used to Call it a White Elephant which was screened {{as part of the}} Variety season at the De La Warr Pavilion, Bexhill, UK. In 2009, he began initial work on what would become his first feature-length documentary film on the life of the late US American performance artist and filmmaker Stuart Sherman. The completed film, Spectacle: A Portrait of Stuart Sherman saw its first screening in 2013 in a curatorial collaboration between Performa and the 'Rituals of Rented Island' Exhibition at the Whitney Museum, New York. There were subsequent screenings at the BBC Art Screen Festival at the Glasgow Film Theatre (2014), Tate Britain in London (2014), and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago (2015). Parallel to this film Robin Deacon performed and directed a series of live solo and group re-enactments of Sherman's performances, including Sherman's ensemble version of Hamlet (A portrait), which was shown as part of the Sacred: US Radical season at London's Chelsea Theatre in 2009.|$|E
50|$|In 1948 Israel officially {{became a}} state. The Kingdom of Jordan assumed {{control of the}} water {{resources}} of the Judea and Samaria Mountains. They retained control over the region until the Six-Day War in 1967. Additional wells drilled during this period and the maximum water supply in the region reached 66 MCM/Y. Only four of 708 Palestinian towns, however, were connected to the water supply at the time. In 1965 an additional 350 wells were drilled, supplying a total of 41 MCM/Y.In the Israeli War of Independence (1948) the Jewish Army destroyed the Rutenburg electric plant in trying to prevent the exclusive Arab control of both the Jordan and Yarmouk Rivers. As a direct result the Jordanian Government and the United Nations Relief and Works <b>Agency</b> <b>commission</b> the MacDonald Plan, which resembled the Ionides Plan (1939) in limiting {{the waters of the}} Jordan River Basin to the Jordan River Valley. It also called for a diversion of the Yarmouk River for storage in Lake Tiberias to be used to support agricultural developments {{on both sides of the}} Jordan River. Jordan and Syria backed the Bunger Plan, which proposed a dam of the Yarmouk River and the creation of two hydroelectric power plants to supply electricity to Jordan and Syria. In 1953, shortly after construction had started, increased pressure from the U.S. forced Jordan and Syria to abandon their plans. The Eisenhower Administration sent Eric Johnston as a special envoy. The Johnston Plan implemented the policies of a Tennessee Valley Authority study conducted by Chales Main - the Main Plan - that included water distribution quotas of the Jordan River Basin. Although neither side accepted the plan, it has been used as the basis for many subsequent water conflict negotiations.|$|E
