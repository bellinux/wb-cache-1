5|$|Upon its release, it {{received}} positive reviews from music critics. Some complimented the composition, noting {{a departure from}} her previous J-pop influenced music, and commended the songwriting. Commercially, the song fared better in Japan than her previous releases, peaking at number 47 on the Oricon Singles Chart. An accompanying music video was directed by Nozomi Tanaka, which featured Chisuga in a large aquarium surrounded by bright lights. To promote the single, Chisuga appeared on radio stations throughout Japan including Rajira Sunday and Hiroshi Kamiya's <b>All</b> <b>Night,</b> <b>and</b> {{was used as the}} closing theme song for the second season of Japanese anime television series, The Asterisk War.|$|E
5|$|Although {{considered}} an average pilot at best by his instructors, Ball qualified for his Royal Aero Club certificate (no.1898) on 15 October 1915, and promptly requested {{transfer to the}} Royal Flying Corps (RFC). He was seconded to No.9 (Reserve) Squadron RFC on 23 October, and trained at Mousehold Heath aerodrome near Norwich. In {{the first week of}} December, he soloed in a Maurice Farman Longhorn after standing duty <b>all</b> <b>night,</b> <b>and</b> his touchdown was rough. When his instructor commented sarcastically on the landing, Ball angrily exclaimed that he had only 15 minutes experience in the plane, and that if this was the best instruction he was going to get, he would rather return to his old unit. The instructor relented, and Ball then soloed again and landed successfully in five consecutive flights. His rough landing was not the last Ball was involved in; he survived two others. He completed his training at Central Flying School, Upavon, and was awarded his wings on 22 January 1916. A week later, he was officially transferred from the North Midlands Cyclist Company to the RFC as a pilot.|$|E
5|$|Immediately upon {{arriving}} in South Africa, Gandhi faced discrimination {{because of his}} skin colour and heritage, like all people of colour. He {{was not allowed to}} sit with European passengers in the stagecoach and told to sit on the floor near the driver, then beaten when he refused; elsewhere he was kicked into a gutter for daring to walk near a house, in another instance thrown off a train at Pietermaritzburg after refusing to leave the first-class. He sat in the train station, shivering <b>all</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> pondering if he should return to India or protest for his rights. He chose to protest and was allowed to board the train the next day. In another incident, the magistrate of a Durban court ordered Gandhi to remove his turban, which he refused to do. Indians were not allowed to walk on public footpaths in South Africa. Gandhi was kicked by a police officer out of the footpath onto the street without warning.|$|E

5|$|Jared {{initially}} {{tells the}} police nothing {{of what he}} saw. He is torn between the need {{to tell the truth}} and the desire to protect his friends; his anger leads to the breakdown of his relationships with both Rachel and Diane. Despite Jared's silence, police arrest Toby and the three other boys within a few days. Jared decides to tell the police what he saw, as he believes Toby and the other boys will be charged with Tracy's murder; however, on his way into the police station he is confronted by Ricko. Ricko confesses to Jared that he killed Tracy, but claims it was an accident – that she hit her head on a rock when he attempted to have sex with her. He has already told police that he was with Jared <b>all</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> asks Jared to confirm his alibi in the name of mateship. Diane, who still {{has not been able to}} tell Jared that she has cancer due to his behaviour, goes in to have surgery.|$|E
5|$|Udell {{recorded}} that in {{the late}} afternoon of August 27, 1858, the Rose–Baley Party reached the Black Mountains. They made their crossing at Sitgreaves Pass, elevation 3,652 feet and named after Lieutenant Lorenzo Sitgreaves, who led an expedition party to the region in 1851. From the crest they could see the Colorado River in the distance. Having traveled <b>all</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> worked continuously during the morning and afternoon, the Rose–Baley Party stopped to prepare their first meal of the day. Soon afterward, a small group of Mohave warriors approached and asked, in a combination of broken English and Spanish, how many people their wagon train included and whether they intended to permanently settle near the Colorado River. The Mohave, who appeared friendly and had brought with them corn and melons, which they sold to the emigrants, were promised that the wagon train planned to travel through the region en route to their intended destination in Southern California. This seemed to appease the Natives, many of whom helped the party during their descent down the western slope of the Black Mountains to the Colorado River below. The emigrants were now entering Mohave country, near present-day Needles, California.|$|E

25|$|Also in 1964, Audrey Hepburn {{starred in}} My Fair Lady, the {{film of the}} musical of the George Bernard Shaw play Pygmalion. George Cukor's {{decision}} to award the role of Eliza Doolittle to Hepburn was perceived by many as a snub to Julie Andrews, who had played the part to great acclaim on Broadway. This is another film with some famous songs, including Wouldn't it be Loverly, I Could have Danced <b>all</b> <b>Night</b> <b>and</b> Get Me to the Church on Time.

25|$|Far from {{endangering}} kids, teen dances keep kids safe. If {{the young}} people hadn't been at a crowded public dance overseen by extensive security (19 guards were at CHAC on Saturday night) where no one got hurt, the kids would likely have been out at unchaperoned and completely unregulated house parties—not after the dance, but <b>all</b> <b>night.</b> <b>And,</b> without a fat calendar of all-ages events, that's {{where they would be}} every weekend. Because without organized all-ages dances and live-music events, house parties and parking lots are all kids have.|$|E

25|$|For the Sprint All-Star Race, Earnhardt started 6th, but battled a tight car <b>all</b> <b>night,</b> <b>and</b> {{was never}} a real contender. Earnhardt crossed the finish line 4th. The {{following}} week at the Coca-Cola 600, he raced inside the Top 5 {{for most of the}} night, before making an unscheduled pit stop for an engine vibration. This resulted in a 19th-place finish, only two laps down.

25|$|This {{set off a}} {{chain of}} events that {{produced}} further casualties and destruction as the both sides engaged in armed fighting for several days to come. That evening, Abkhaz and Georgians began mobilizing all over Abkhazia and western Georgia. Svans, an ethnic Georgian subgroup from northeastern Abkhazia, and Abkhaz from the town of Tkvarcheli in Abkhazia clashed in a shootout that lasted <b>all</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> intermittently for several days afterward. Meanwhile, up to 25,000 Georgians from western Georgia, and the predominantly Georgian Gali district in southern Abkhazia, gathered near Ochamchire. Soviet Interior Ministry troops were sent in to restore order, and by 17 July the violence had largely dissipated.|$|E
25|$|Seine {{underwent}} a refit at Chatham Dockyard between June and July 1803, with Milne recommissioning her in May for the North Sea. However, {{shortly after her}} return to service she grounded on a sandbank to the northward of Terschelling on 21 July 1803. That evening Milne had ordered the pilots to keep her out of shallow water and they had assured {{him that she was}} safe; forty minutes later she struck. The crew labored <b>all</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> well into the morning, with the assistance of two passing merchant vessels to pull her off and to lighten her, but to no avail. At about 11:30am the crew abandoned Seine; they set fire to her as they left to prevent the French recapturing her.|$|E

We rowed backwards and forwards between the rocks and the steamer <b>all</b> <b>night,</b> <b>and</b> a weary time it was. Guns were fired, and rockets sent up; but our signals of distress were not answered, though a light we saw at some distance on the shore made us hopeful that assistance was at hand. The masts were cut down to lighten the ship, and the crash as they fell into the water sounded very fearful.|$|E
25|$|At Auto Club Speedway, Earnhardt started 15th. However, on lap 44, his car lost a {{right front}} tire {{and hit the}} outside wall in turn 2, {{bringing}} out a caution, making him one of several victims of tire failures that plagued the race. After being repaired and falling {{to the back of}} the lead lap, Earnhardt made several charges through the field to salvage a 12th-place finish, keeping him at 2nd place in the points. The following week at Martinsville, Earnhardt battled inside the Top 5 all day, leading 25 laps, and finished 3rd, giving him his 4th Top 3 finish of the season, and regained the points lead. At Texas, he crashed on Lap 13 and caught on fire. He finished last and fell 5 positions in points and dropped to 31 points behind new points leader Jeff Gordon. The following week at Darlington, Earnhardt raced among the Top 5 <b>all</b> <b>night,</b> <b>and</b> was leading on a green-white-checkered finish, before finishing 2nd to Kevin Harvick.|$|E
25|$|Three {{lifeboats}} were dispatched from Northern Ireland to {{the area}} where the aircraft was last seen on radar, along with two helicopters from Prestwick and Anglesey and one from the Strathclyde Police (during daytime hours), and the HMS Penzance, a Royal Navy minesweeper that was conducting training operations 35nm away. Coast Guard rescue teams conducted searches along the shoreline <b>all</b> <b>night</b> <b>and</b> the next day along with officers from the Strathclyde Police Department. Two investigators from the AAIB were also sent to the scene. Some wreckage of the aircraft was quickly found floating in the water (all three doors, the paramedic's bag, the left main landing gear leg, and other light material), with the main wreckage submerged on the seabed. The wreckage was 7.7nm west-northwest of the Campbeltown airport. The fuselage had broken into three main sections: front, centre, and rear. The centre section included the wing. The engines and propellers had been torn from the wings on impact. The paramedic's body was found strapped to his seat. The pilot's body was not found {{in the vicinity of the}} debris field.|$|E
