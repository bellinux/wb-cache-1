5|$|As {{with other}} forms of climbing, bouldering {{technique}} is largely centered on proper footwork. Leg muscles are significantly stronger than arm muscles; thus, proficient boulderers use their arms primarily to maintain balance and body positioning, relying on their legs to push them up the boulder. Boulderers also keep their <b>arms</b> <b>straight</b> whenever possible, allowing their bones to support their body weight rather than their muscles.|$|E
25|$|As {{soon as the}} oar blade {{is placed}} in the water at the catch, the rower begins to lever the boat past the blade by {{straightening}} the legs while the body remains leaned forward and the <b>arms</b> <b>straight.</b> This is called the leg drive.|$|E

60|$|All {{about us}} in the garden lay their {{sinister}} craft, which the therns for some reason, then unaccountable to me, {{made no effort to}} injure.

60|$|As Barney turned {{both the}} men fired simultaneously, and both missed. The American raised his revolver, {{and with the}} flash of it the {{foremost}} brigand came to a sudden stop. An expression of bewilderment crossed his features. He extended his <b>arms</b> <b>straight</b> before him, the revolver slipped from his grasp, and then like a dying top he pivoted once drunkenly and collapsed upon the turf.|$|E
60|$|Elsley {{looked at}} him still askance, puzzled, inquiring. Suddenly his great {{beautiful}} eyes opened to preternatural wideness, {{as if trying to}} grasp a new thought. He started, shifted his feet to and fro, his <b>arms</b> <b>straight</b> down by his sides, his fingers clutching after something. Then he looked up hurriedly again at Campbell; and Thurnall {{looked at him}} also; and his face was as the face of an angel.|$|E

60|$|At last I could endure {{no longer}} to sit supinely by while a fellowman was dragged down to a horrible death by that repulsive reptile. Embedded in the prow of the skiff lay the spear that had been cast after me by him whom I {{suddenly}} desired to save. With a wrench I tore it loose, and standing upright in the wobbly log drove it with all the strength of my two <b>arms</b> <b>straight</b> into the gaping jaws of the hydrophidian.|$|E
60|$|Thus urged, {{the ghost}} {{could do no}} less than make his appearance, and he arose from his place of partial {{concealment}} as majestically as he could, {{considering the fact that}} the sheet had been caught upon a nail, and he was obliged to stoop two or three times to unfasten it. But he did succeed in rising at last, and then, to make himself look as much like a spectre as possible, he held both <b>arms</b> <b>straight</b> out as he walked slowly down the stage.|$|E

50|$|There {{is no need}} {{to think}} of {{delivering}} the strike with a 'blade edge'. In fact, it's better to deliver the strike with your palm facing down, so that the thumb side of the stick strikes the target to striking with the back edge of your blade. That helps enormously in keeping the <b>arm</b> <b>straight</b> throughout.|$|R
50|$|The Sulcus sign is an {{orthopedic}} evaluation test for glenohumeral instability of the shoulder. With the <b>arm</b> <b>straight</b> and relaxed {{to the side}} of the patient, the elbow is grasped and traction is applied in an inferior direction. With excessive inferior translation, a depression occurs just below the acromion. The appearance of this sulcus is a positive sign.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike most bowlers {{who keep}} their <b>arm</b> <b>straight</b> on the {{backswing}} {{as they are}} about to release the ball, Carter kept his elbow bent, never straightening his arm.

60|$|The {{lieutenant}} {{went to his}} post, and the parapet being now apparently clear Captain Ransome {{returned to}} it {{to have a look}} over. As he mounted the banquette a man sprang upon the crest, waving a great brilliant flag. The captain drew a pistol from his belt and shot him dead. The body, pitching forward, hung over the inner edge of the embankment, the <b>arms</b> <b>straight</b> downward, both hands still grasping the flag. The man's few followers turned and fled down the slope. Looking over the parapet, the captain saw no living thing. He observed also that no bullets were coming into the work.|$|E
6000|$|He {{turned and}} looked at me. [...] "Ha, old Ten Per Cent!" [...] he called out, struggling. [...] "It's you, then, is it? Never, never to you, sir!" [...] And as he spoke, he somehow flung his <b>arms</b> <b>straight</b> out behind him, and let the {{dust-coat}} slip off, which it easily did, the sleeves being new and smoothly silk-lined. The suddenness of the movement threw me completely off my guard, and off my legs as well. I was clinging to the coat and holding him. As the support gave way I rolled over backward, in the mud of the street, and hurt my back seriously. As for Colonel Clay, with a nervous laugh, he bolted off at full speed in his evening coat, and vanished round a corner.|$|E
60|$|As we descended, {{the left}} {{bank of the}} river was entirely {{occupied}} with cocos; and the contrast between them and the mangroves on the right was made all the more striking by the afternoon sun, which, as it sank behind the forest, left the mangrove wall in black shadow, while it bathed the palm-groves opposite with yellow light. In one of these palm-groves we landed, for we were right thirsty; and to drink lagoon water would be to drink cholera or fever. But there was plenty of pure water in the coco-trees, and we soon had our fill. A Negro walked--not climbed--up a stem like a four-footed animal, his legs and <b>arms</b> <b>straight,</b> his feet pressed flat against it, his hands clinging round it--a feat impossible, as far as I have seen, to an European--tossed us down plenty of green nuts; and our feast began.|$|E

50|$|In North America, semaphores were {{employed}} as train order signals, {{with the purpose}} of indicating to engineers whether they should stop to receive a telegraphed order. It was common for train order signals to point the <b>arm</b> <b>straight</b> down to indicate 'proceed'. Train order signals were typically located at the station building, with a tall common post mounting signal arms facing in opposing directions.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, then, ye don't onderstand me? Well, well, now, isn't that strange? Look you, avic, have ye seen a brig or a brig's crew {{anywhere}} betune {{this and}} the north pole--try, now, an' remimber." [...] He illustrated this question by holding up both <b>arms</b> <b>straight</b> above his head to represent the masts of a brig, and sticking his right leg straight {{out in front of}} him, to represent the bowsprit; but the woman gazed at him with an air of obtuse gravity that might have damped the hopes even of an Irishman. O'Riley prided himself, however, on not being easily beat, and despite his repeated failure, and the laughter of his messmates, was proceeding to make a third effort, when a loud shout from the cliffs caused the whole party to start and turn their eyes in that direction. The cry had been uttered by a figure whose costume bore so close a resemblance to that which they themselves wore that they thought for a moment it was one of their own shipmates, but a second glance proved that they were mistaken, for the individual in question carried a spear which he brandished with exceedingly fierce and warlike intentions.|$|E
60|$|His expression, as he {{shot out}} from the archway at them, may have been {{something}} between a grin of recognition and a scowl of annoyance at himself for the unintentional intrusion. But disconcerted as he was, he was yet able to appreciate something of the peculiarity of their mutual attitudes. The bicycles were lying by the roadside, and the two riders stood face to face. The other man in brown's attitude, as it flashed upon Hoopdriver, was a deliberate pose; he twirled his moustache and smiled faintly, and he was conscientiously looking amused. And the girl stood rigid, her <b>arms</b> <b>straight</b> by her side, her handkerchief clenched in her hand, {{and her face was}} flushed, with the faintest touch of red upon her eyelids. She seemed to Mr. Hoopdriver's sense to be indignant. But that was the impression of a second. A mask of surprised recognition fell across this revelation of emotion as she turned her head towards him, and the pose of the other man in brown vanished too in a momentary astonishment. And then he had passed them, and was riding on towards Haslemere to make what he could of the swift picture that had photographed itself on his brain.|$|E
6000|$|... "My mind's upset, sir; {{and whether}} things are wrong or whether things are right {{is more than}} I can say.

[...] "And asked," [...] she proceeded, [...] "when you was expected back, ma'am. I told him what my master had telegraphed, and the man says upon that, 'Wait a bit,' he says; 'I'm coming back.' He came back in a minute or less; and he carried a Thing in his arms which curdled my blood--it did!--and set me shaking from the crown of my head to the sole of my foot. I know I ought to have stopped it; but I couldn't stand upon my legs, much less put the man out of the house. In he went, without 'with your leave,' or 'by your leave,' Mr. Benjamin, sir--in he went, with the Thing in his <b>arms,</b> <b>straight</b> through to your library. And there It has been all these hours. And there It is now. I've spoken to the police; but they wouldn't interfere; and what to do next is more than my poor head can tell.
