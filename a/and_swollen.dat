5|$|In 1870, George Bentham {{published}} the first infrageneric arrangement of Adenanthos in Volume 5 of his landmark Flora Australiensis. Bentham divided the genus into two sections, placing A.obovata in A.sect. Eurylaema, defined as containing those species with one sterile stamen, and perianth tubes that are curved <b>and</b> <b>swollen</b> above the middle.|$|E
5|$|Phlegmasia cerulea dolens is a {{very large}} and {{dangerous}} type of DVT. It is characterized by an acute and almost total venous occlusion of the entire extremity outflow, including the iliac and femoral veins. The leg is usually painful, tinged blue in color, <b>and</b> <b>swollen,</b> which may result in venous gangrene.|$|E
5|$|Gout {{is a form}} of {{inflammatory}} arthritis characterized by recurrent attacks of a red, tender, hot, <b>and</b> <b>swollen</b> joint. Pain typically comes on rapidly in less than twelve hours. The joint {{at the base of the}} big toe is affected in about half of cases. It may also result in tophi, kidney stones, or urate nephropathy.|$|E

5|$|Reversion is {{a serious}} disease {{transmitted}} by the blackcurrant gall mite Cecidophyopsis ribis. It causes a decline in yield and is quite widespread in Europe but is rarely encountered on other continents. Symptoms include a modification of leaf shape in summer <b>and</b> <b>swollen</b> buds ("big bud") in winter, each housing thousands of microscopic mites. As pest control has limited effectiveness, severely infected bushes should be destroyed. All new plants purchased should be certified as virus-free.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it appears}} to be a single star to the naked eye, Capella is {{actually}} a system of four stars in two binary pairs. The first pair consists of two bright yellow giant stars, both of which are around 2.5 times as massive as the Sun. They have exhausted their core hydrogen, and cooled <b>and</b> <b>swollen,</b> moving off the main sequence. Designated Capella Aa and Capella Ab, they are in a very tight circular orbit some 0.76 astronomical units (au) apart, and orbit each other every 104 days. Capella Aa is the cooler and more luminous of the two with spectral class K0III; it is 78.7 ± 4.2 times the Sun's luminosity and 11.98 ± 0.57 times its radius.|$|E
5|$|By 1859, Rosalie Cadron-Jetté's {{health was}} {{worsening}} significantly. Information about the particular conditions she was afflicted with is contradictory. Testimony from Cadron-Jetté's family suggests that Cadron-Jetté had become ill {{when she was}} 36 years old and never fully recovered. Other sources suggest generalised edema, known {{at the time as}} dropsy, while still others diagnose her with chronic nephritis, known at the time as Bright's disease, which worsened over the following years. Symptoms observed in Cadron-Jetté by her contemporaries included difficulty breathing, almost constant coughing, fits of breathlessness while standing and at rest, <b>and</b> <b>swollen</b> legs displaying open sores.|$|E

50|$|Goniobranchus tasmaniensis is a chromodorid nudibranch {{which has}} a {{translucent}} white mantle with scattered orange or red spots. The edge of the mantle is opaque white <b>and</b> somewhat <b>swollen</b> <b>and</b> ruffled in resting animals. Compare with Goniobranchus splendidus, Goniobranchus hunterae and Goniobranchus daphne which all have similar coloration.|$|R
50|$|Heat {{urticaria}} presents {{within five}} minutes after the skin has been exposed to heat above 43 degrees Celsius (109.4 degrees Fahrenheit), with the exposed area becoming burned, stinging, <b>and</b> turning red, <b>swollen,</b> <b>and</b> indurated.|$|R
5|$|Elizabeth David Ltd {{was never}} more than {{modestly}} profitable, but David would not lower her standards {{in search of a}} commercial return. A new manager was brought in to run the shop and David fought against many of his changes, but she was always in the minority against her fellow directors. The stress of disagreements over company policy—and the deaths of her sister Diana in March 1971 and her mother in June 1973—contributed to health problems and she suffered from chronic fatigue <b>and</b> <b>swollen,</b> ulcerous legs. Gradually her business partners found her commercial approach unsustainable, and in 1973 she left the company. To her annoyance, the shop continued to trade under her name, although she tried periodically to persuade her former colleagues to change it.|$|E
5|$|The fungus grows {{predominantly}} in coniferous forests, forming symbiotic ectomycorrhizal {{associations with}} living trees by enveloping the tree's underground roots with sheaths of fungal tissue. The fungus produces spore-bearing fruit bodies above ground {{in summer and}} autumn. The large, edible fruiting bodies known as mushrooms appear under pine trees, generally in summer and autumn. It has a matte brown to maroon-coloured cap and its stem is often large <b>and</b> <b>swollen,</b> and the overall colour may have an orange-red tinge. As with other boletes, {{the size of the}} fruiting body is variable.|$|E
5|$|Van Eyck {{does not}} shy from showing the {{physical}} {{effects of the}} canon's illness, including worn, crevassed and tired skin, weak vision, enlarged temporal arteries <b>and</b> <b>swollen</b> fingers. The awkwardness with which van der Paele clutches his breviary suggests weakness in his left arm; van de Paele probably suffered acute arm and shoulder pain, borne out by early 1430s church records documenting that he was excused from morning duties, and absent all day by 1434. His condition has been diagnosed by modern doctors as possibly polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis.|$|E

25|$|Y. pestis bacilli {{can resist}} {{phagocytosis}} and even reproduce inside phagocytes and kill them. As the disease progresses, {{the lymph nodes}} can haemorrhage <b>and</b> become <b>swollen</b> <b>and</b> necrotic. Bubonic plague can progress to lethal septicemic plague in some cases. The plague is also known to spread to the lungs and become the disease known as the pneumonic plague.|$|R
25|$|Bubonic plague is one {{of three}} types of plague caused by {{bacterium}} Yersinia pestis. One to seven days after exposure to the bacteria, flu like symptoms develop. These include fever, headaches, <b>and</b> vomiting. <b>Swollen</b> <b>and</b> painful lymph nodes occur in the area closest to where the bacteria entered the skin. Occasionally the swollen lymph nodes may break open.|$|R
5|$|The {{threat of}} the {{hurricane}} prompted widespread tropical cyclone warnings and watches along the eastern United States and prompted some people to evacuate. Damage was heaviest in southeastern North Carolina near New Bern, where the combination of high tides <b>and</b> <b>swollen</b> rivers flooded much of the town. Across North Carolina, the hurricane caused power outages, washed out roads, and damaged crops. Several houses were damaged, leaving about 1,000people homeless. Damage was estimated at $4.5million, and there were 21deaths in the state, mostly from drowning. Hurricane-force winds extended into southeastern Virginia, where there were two deaths. High tides isolated a lighthouse near Norfolk and covered several roads. Farther north, two people on a small boat were left missing in Maine, and another person was presumed killed when his boat sank in Nova Scotia.|$|E
5|$|With an {{apparent}} magnitude of 3.68, Alpha Pyxidis is {{the brightest star}} in the constellation. Located 880 ± 30 light-years distant from Earth, it is a blue-white giant star of spectral type B1.5III that is around 22,000 times as luminous as the Sun and has 9.4 ± 0.7 times its diameter. It began life with a mass 12.1 ± 0.6 times that of the Sun, almost 15 million years ago. Its light is dimmed by 30% due to interstellar dust, so would have a brighter magnitude of 3.31 if not for this. The second brightest star at magnitude 3.97 is Beta Pyxidis, a yellow bright giant or supergiant of spectral type G7Ib-II that is around 435 times as luminous as the Sun, lying 420 ± 10 light-years distant away from Earth. It has a companion star of magnitude 12.5 separated by 9 arcseconds. Gamma Pyxidis is a star of magnitude 4.02 that lies 207 ± 2 light-years distant. It is an orange giant of spectral type K3III that has cooled <b>and</b> <b>swollen</b> to 3.7 times the diameter of the Sun after exhausting its core hydrogen.|$|E

25|$|This {{process was}} later {{performed}} on the human body (in {{the image on the}} left): the physician tied a tight ligature onto the upper arm of a person. This would cut off blood flow from the arteries and the veins. When this was done, the arm below the ligature was cool and pale, while above the ligature it was warm <b>and</b> <b>swollen.</b> The ligature was loosened slightly, which allowed blood from the arteries to come into the arm, since arteries are deeper in the flesh than the veins. When this was done, the opposite effect was seen in the lower arm. It was now warm <b>and</b> <b>swollen.</b> The veins were also more visible, since now they were full of blood.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} stages, signs of {{inflammation}} {{may not be}} apparent if the bacteria are deep within the tissue. If they are not deep, signs of inflammation, such as redness <b>and</b> <b>swollen</b> or hot skin, develop very quickly. Skin color may progress to violet, and blisters may form, with subsequent necrosis (death) of the subcutaneous tissues.|$|E
25|$|These {{conditions}} {{are closely related}} and may occur alone or in combination. If the rotator cuff and bursa are irritated, inflamed, <b>and</b> <b>swollen,</b> they may become squeezed between {{the head of the}} humerus and the acromion. Repeated motion involving the arms, or the aging process involving shoulder motion over many years, may also irritate and wear down the tendons, muscles, and surrounding structures.|$|E

25|$|But word reached Lillinonah of her father's {{arrangement}} with Eagle Feather -- and she reacted immediately. Down {{on the shore}} of the Housatonic River, now rapid <b>and</b> <b>swollen</b> with the heavy rains of autumn, she climbed into a canoe and shoved off into the teeth of the roaring current. As the canoe was carried faster and faster toward the turbulent waters above the dangerous falls of the river, Lillinonah tossed away her paddle and sank back {{in the bottom of the}} canoe to await her fate.|$|E
25|$|Systemic lupus {{erythematosus}} (SLE), also {{known simply as}} lupus, is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue {{in many parts of}} the body. Symptoms vary between people and may be mild to severe. Common symptoms include painful <b>and</b> <b>swollen</b> joints, fever, chest pain, hair loss, mouth ulcers, swollen lymph nodes, feeling tired, and a red rash which is most commonly on the face. Often there are periods of illness, called flares, and periods of remission during which there are few symptoms.|$|E
5000|$|Early on, {{the primary}} symptom is loss of {{feeling in the}} skin. In the numb areas, the skin is numb, <b>and</b> {{possibly}} <b>swollen,</b> with a reddened border.|$|R
50|$|The {{historical}} {{understanding of}} the disease suggests dysfunctional apocrine glands or dysfunctional hair follicles, possibly triggered by a blocked gland, create inflammation, pain, <b>and</b> a <b>swollen</b> lesion.|$|R
