5|$|Additionally, {{the actual}} piano sheet music {{from each of}} the ten Final Fantasy Piano Collections albums has been {{published}} as ten corresponding music books by Yamaha Music Media. Each book contains the original music, exactly as arranged and performed on the albums. Unlike the Original Score arrangements, these pieces are intended only for advanced players as they are generally more difficult. Sheet music for the Final Fantasy XI Piano Collections album included in the Final Fantasy XI OST Premium Box Set was included in that box set, <b>and,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> album itself, is unavailable for purchase elsewhere; sheet music for the identically named standalone piano album is published by Yamaha.|$|E

5|$|Although the 1915 {{season was}} a success, the next year's team {{was one of}} the {{greatest}} of Warner's career. The Panthers were again undefeated <b>and,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> previous year, six of the eight games were shutouts. Thirty-two of their 35 players were from Western Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh. The team scored 255 points, conceding 25. Warner considered the team an improvement because its defense was more dominant than the previous year's. The Panthers were the consensus national champions, and Warner became recognized as one of football's greatest coaches.|$|E
5|$|Development of the fertilized eggs is direct, {{in other}} words there is no {{distinctive}} larval form. Juveniles of all groups are generally planktonic, and in most species resemble miniature adult cydippids, gradually developing their adult body forms as they grow. In the genus Beroe, however, the juveniles have large mouths <b>and,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> adults, lack both tentacles and tentacle sheaths, and in some groups, such as the flat, bottom-dwelling platyctenids, the juveniles behave more like true larvae, as they live among the plankton and thus occupy a different ecological niche from their parents, and only attain the adult form by a more radical metamorphosis after dropping to the sea-floor.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, {{four new}} {{performances}} were scheduled, taking stage in Tokyo, Stockholm, and a reprise in Cologne. These performances featured slightly modified {{versions of the}} original arrangements, <b>and</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> original concerts, were sold out. Another performance was held in London in October 2016 by the London Symphony Orchestra. The original concert and the Tokyo concert both sparked the release of an album. These albums, along with the concerts themselves, were heavily praised, both {{for the quality of}} the performance and for the quality of Valtonen's arrangements, which overlaid themes from multiple pieces rather than relying on a traditional medley.|$|E

5|$|Live {{performances}} {{before an}} audience constitute a major form of entertainment, especially before the invention of audio and video recording. Performance takes {{a wide range of}} forms, including theatre, music and drama. In the 16th and 17th centuries, European royal courts presented masques that were complex theatrical entertainments involving dancing, singing and acting. Opera is a similarly demanding performance style that remains popular. It also encompass all three forms, demanding a high level of musical and dramatic skill, collaboration <b>and</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> masque, production expertise as well.|$|E
5|$|Marlborough {{now had to}} {{turn his}} {{attention}} from the fleeing enemy to direct Churchill to detach more infantry to storm Blenheim. Orkney's infantry, Hamilton's English brigade and St Paul's Hanoverians moved across the trampled wheat to the cottages. Fierce hand-to-hand fighting gradually forced the French towards the village centre, {{in and around the}} walled churchyard which had been prepared for defence. Hay and Ross's dismounted dragoons were also sent, but suffered under a counter-charge delivered by the regiments of Artois and Provence under command of Colonel de la Silvière. Colonel Belville's Hanoverians were fed into the battle to steady the resolve of the dragoons, and once more went to the attack. The Allied progress was slow and hard, <b>and</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> defenders, they suffered many casualties.|$|E
5|$|Mystery Train was {{released}} theatrically by Orion Classics under a restricted rating in the United States, where it grossed over $1.5 million. It enjoyed critical acclaim {{on the film}} festival circuit, <b>and</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> director's earlier films premiered at the New York Film Festival and was shown in competition at Cannes, where Jarmusch was awarded the Best Artistic Achievement Award. The film was also shown in the Edinburgh, London, Midnight Sun, Telluride, and Toronto film festivals, and was nominated in six categories at the Independent Spirit Awards. Critical reaction was overwhelmingly positive, with reviewers praising the structure, humor, and characters of the film, though there was criticism that the director had not been sufficiently adventurous.|$|E

The polycarbonate unibody MacBook, like its aluminum predecessor, lacks FireWire <b>and,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> 13-inch MacBook Pro, has a combined audio in/out port. There is no infrared port and the Apple Remote is not included. On May 18, 2010, the MacBook was refreshed with a faster processor, a faster graphics card, improved battery life, {{and the ability to}} pass audio through the Mini DisplayPort connector. On July 20, 2011, the MacBook was discontinued for consumer purchases, but was still available to educational institutions until February 2012.|$|E
5|$|One of Ford's {{greatest}} challenges {{was dealing with}} the continued Vietnam War. American offensive operations against North Vietnam had ended with the Paris Peace Accords, signed on January 27, 1973. The accords declared a cease fire across both North and South Vietnam, and required the release of American prisoners of war. The agreement guaranteed the territorial integrity of Vietnam <b>and,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Geneva Conference of 1954, called for national elections in the North and South. The Paris Peace Accords stipulated a sixty-day period for the total withdrawal of U.S. forces.|$|E

5|$|The National Weather Service, in {{anticipation}} of a possible landfall in the Carolinas, issued a gale warning and a hurricane watch from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina to Norfolk, Virginia on September 18 (tropical storm warnings were not issued at the time). A hurricane warning was issued from Cherry Point, North Carolina to the Virginia capes on September 19, but was discontinued early on September 20 as the hurricane passed to the east. A hurricane watch was also issued from Cape May, New Jersey to the Massachusetts coast on September 19, <b>and</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> warning, was discontinued on September 20.|$|E

The models for the Stage 3 are the Nord Stage 3 88, with 88 Hammer Action keys, the smaller and lighter HP 76, with 76 Hammer Action Portable keys, and the Compact, with 73 semi-weighted waterfall keys <b>and,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Electro 5D, physical drawbars for the organ section.|$|E
5|$|The Red {{fire started}} near Lewis Lake on July 1 <b>and</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Shoshone fire, {{advanced}} little for several weeks. The fire then moved northeast on July 19 and {{combined with the}} Shoshone fire in August. As these two fires advanced towards the Grant Village area, evacuations were ordered so fire fighting crews could concentrate on structure protection. In {{the midst of a}} large lodgepole pine forest, the Grant Village complex was the first major tourist area impacted that season. A number of small structures and some of the campground complex were destroyed. After the Red and Shoshone fires combined, they were referred to as the Shoshone fire, since it was much larger.|$|E

5|$|The greater {{adjutant}} is omnivorous {{and although}} mainly a scavenger, it preys on frogs and large insects and will also take birds, reptiles and rodents. It {{has been known}} to attack wild ducks coming within reach and swallowing them whole.

They are often found on garbage dumps and will feed on animal and human excreta. In 19th-century Calcutta, they fed on partly burnt human corpses disposed along the Ganges river. In Rajasthan, where it is extremely rare, it has been reported to feed on swarms of desert locusts (Schistocerca gregaria) but this has been questioned.|$|E
5|$|The ride {{vehicles}} are themed {{to look like}} cars from a classic dark ride, <b>and</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> previous Back to the Future attraction, the vehicles feature fake wheels and gull-wing doors. Each dome features 12 8-passenger ride vehicles arranged with 3 cars on the first level, 5 on the second and 4 on the third. Each vehicle is mounted on a motion platform atop a scissor lift, which raises the vehicle 9 feet into the dome. The motion platforms are capable of a total motion of three feet. In addition to the motion-based ride vehicles, riders also feel water effects, smoke, mist, and experience lighting effects and scents. As of 2017, the smoke and water effects only work on a few vehicles at the Florida location.|$|E
