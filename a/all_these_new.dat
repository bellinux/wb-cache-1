25|$|In late 1778, British {{strategy}} shifted south. As {{their attention}} went, so too did their efforts, their armies, and their supplies, including those slated for the Southern Indians. The Southern theater had the added {{advantage of being}} home to more Loyalists than the North. With <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>new</b> advantages, the Cherokee were able to greatly renew their territorial defense. Both the Cherokee (all of them) and the Upper Creek signed on for active participation.|$|E
25|$|In 1947, {{a team of}} {{scientists}} led by Maurice Ewing utilizing the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution's research vessel Atlantis and an array of instruments, confirmed the existence of a rise in the central Atlantic Ocean, and found that the floor of the seabed beneath the layer of sediments consisted of basalt, not the granite which is the main constituent of continents. They also found that the oceanic crust was much thinner than continental crust. <b>All</b> <b>these</b> <b>new</b> findings raised important and intriguing questions.|$|E
25|$|On August 28, 1922, Mayor John Francis Hylan {{revealed}} his own {{plans for the}} subway system, which was relatively small at the time. His plan included taking over nearly 100 miles of existing lines and building over 100 miles of new lines. Construction of <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>new</b> lines would be completed by December 31, 1925, and passengers {{would be able to}} ride between the ends of New York City on one fare. The lines were designed to compete with the IRT and BMT.|$|E

25|$|Roach had {{recognized}} {{the growing demand}} for steel products in the U.S. economy, and in 1880 he established the Combination Steel and Iron Company downriver from his Chester shipyard, which began production in January 1881. He soon discovered however that U.S. steelmakers could {{not keep up with}} national demand, so he also established his own steel manufacturing company, the Standard Steel Casting Company, which began production early in 1884. <b>All</b> <b>these</b> <b>new</b> facilities would soon be utilized for supplying steel to his shipyard.|$|E
25|$|By 1937, {{plans were}} being {{finalised}} {{for the construction}} of several more hydro-electric plants. The plans called for stations at Poulaphouca, Golden Falls, Leixlip (all in Leinster), Clady, Cliff and Cathaleen's Fall (between Belleek and Ballyshannon in County Donegal), Carrigadrohid and Inniscarra (in County Cork). <b>All</b> <b>these</b> <b>new</b> plants were completed by 1949, and together harnessed approximately 75% of Ireland's inland water power potential. Many of these plants are still in operation – however as could be expected with continuing growth in demand their combined capacity falls far short of Ireland's modern needs.|$|E
25|$|Since Euclid, {{geometry}} {{had meant}} {{the geometry of}} Euclidean space of two dimensions (plane geometry) or of three dimensions (solid geometry). In {{the first half of}} the nineteenth century there had been several developments complicating the picture. Mathematical applications required geometry of four or more dimensions; the close scrutiny of the foundations of the traditional Euclidean geometry had revealed the independence of the parallel postulate from the others, and non-Euclidean geometry had been born. Klein proposed an idea that <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>new</b> geometries are just special cases of the projective geometry, as already developed by Poncelet, Möbius, Cayley and others. Klein also strongly suggested to mathematical physicists that even a moderate cultivation of the projective purview might bring substantial benefits to them.|$|E

25|$|After the {{discovery}} at Manson's Creek in July of '71, more large strikes {{were made on}} nearby creeks. Among these were Blackjack Creek, Kildare Creek, Mosquito Creek, Slate Creek and Nugget Gulch. One of this richest creeks was found by accident by James Carson, H. Guest and J Griffith, who had gotten lost while looking for Manson's Creek and literally stumbled across it, thus they called it Lost Creek. The very first panful taken from Lost Creek yielded 3/4 of an ounce of gold. With <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>new</b> strikes in the district, new towns sprang up practically overnight: Manson's Creek, Howellton and Dunkeld. The residence of the Gold Commissioner's would be built at Dunkeld. There would be three Gold Commissioners for the Omineca district in the 1870s and they were, Peter O'Reilly, WH Fitzgerald and D. Ballentyne, who would also act as Stipendary Magistrates.|$|E
25|$|Napoleon conquered most of Italy in {{the name}} of the French Revolution in 1797–99. He {{consolidated}} old units and split up Austria's holdings. He set up a series of new republics, complete with new codes of law and abolition of old feudal privileges. Napoleon's Cisalpine Republic was centered on Milan; Genoa became a republic; the Roman Republic was formed as well as the small Ligurian Republic around Genoa. The Neapolitan Republic was formed around Naples, but it lasted only five months. He later formed the Kingdom of Italy, with his brother as King. In addition, France turned the Netherlands into the Batavian Republic, and Switzerland into the Helvetic Republic. <b>All</b> <b>these</b> <b>new</b> countries were satellites of France, and had to pay large subsidies to Paris, as well as provide military support for Napoleon's wars. Their political and administrative systems were modernized, the metric system introduced, and trade barriers reduced. Jewish ghettos were abolished. Belgium and Piedmont became integral parts of France.|$|E
25|$|To {{find jobs}} for <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>new</b> Malay graduates, the {{government}} created several agencies for {{intervention in the}} economy. The {{most important of these}} were PERNAS (National Corporation Ltd.), PETRONAS (National Petroleum Ltd.), and HICOM (Heavy Industry Corporation of Malaysia), which not only directly employed many Malays but also invested in growing areas of the economy to create new technical and administrative jobs which were preferentially allocated to Malays. As a result, the share of Malay equity in the economy rose from 1.5% in 1969 to 20.3% in 1990, and the percentage of businesses of all kinds owned by Malays rose from 39 percent to 68 percent. This latter figure was deceptive because many businesses that appeared to be Malay-owned were still indirectly controlled by Chinese, but {{there is no doubt that}} the Malay share of the economy considerably increased. The Chinese remained disproportionately powerful in Malaysian economic life, but by 2000 the distinction between Chinese and Malay business was fading as many new corporations, particularly in growth sectors such as information technology, were owned and managed by people from both ethnic groups.|$|E

25|$|Napoleon conquered most of Italy in {{the name}} of the French Revolution in 1797–99. He {{consolidated}} old units and split up Austria's holdings. He set up a series of new republics, complete with new codes of law and abolition of old feudal privileges. Napoleon's Cisalpine Republic was centred on Milan. Genoa the city became a republic while its hinterland became the Ligurian Republic. The Roman Republic was formed out of the papal holdings and the pope was sent to France. The Neapolitan Republic was formed around Naples, but it lasted only five months before the enemy forces of the Coalition recaptured it. In 1805 he formed the Kingdom of Italy, with himself as king and his stepson as viceroy. In addition, France turned the Netherlands into the Batavian Republic, and Switzerland into the Helvetic Republic. <b>All</b> <b>these</b> <b>new</b> countries were satellites of France, and had to pay large subsidies to Paris, as well as provide military support for Napoleon's wars.

25|$|In 1998, Smith {{recruited}} Brett Detar, guitarist of Pennsylvania emocore band Pensive, to {{help him}} build a new incarnation of Zao. Detar suggested a pair of his friends, guitarist Russ Cogdell and enigmatic writer / poet (and future tattoo artist) Daniel Weyandt. Both Cogdell and Weyandt had played in Christian Hardcore band Seasons in the Field, who had released a split EP with Pensive. Smith would drive several hours to Greensburg, where <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>new</b> members lived, to co-write and rehearse {{what would become the}} first (and in many ways, defining) album from the new Zao, Where Blood and Fire Bring Rest. The group played fewer and fewer songs from the old version of the band as Blood and Fire took hold. They toured without a bassist and set stages ablaze with their raw emotion and Weyandt's personal storytelling, which detailed the hardships that informed their songs. With a rockabilly look and Smith's oddly engaging habit of setting up his drums facing away from the audience, their live reputation grew large in the underground. Not long after recording their half of a split EP with labelmates Training for Utopia in California, Detar left the group in 1999 to focus his energy on his rock side-project The Juliana Theory, who would sign to Sony and have a successful career before disbanding in 2006.|$|E
25|$|Buildings {{rose and}} roads were {{constructed}} in the new neighbourhoods north of Lisbon, works initiated by the city council {{with the support of}} the bourgeoisie. In 1878 the public promenade was demolished; it was replaced in 1886 by the Avenida da Liberdade (Liberty Avenue), designed by Ressano Garcia to be the central urban axis of the city, connecting the Baixa with the newly developed areas of the city and extending into agricultural land in anticipation of further urban expansion. At the head of the avenue was constructed Marquis of Pombal Square (Praça do Marquês de Pombal), the new geographical centre of Lisbon, from which radiated the newly built avenues of Lisbon. The upper class of Lisbon built palaces on these thoroughfares; the most important was the Avenida Fontes Pereira de Melo, running northeast and ending in the new Praça Duque de Saldanha, whence it became a part of another great avenue, today República but initially Ressano Garcia. In the vicinity was the Campo Grande (then an open field and not a Garden) and the new Campo Pequeno bullring, completed in 1892 in a Moorish Revival architectural style. New neighbourhoods were built nearby on plans similar to that of the Baixa, including Campo de Ourique to the west, and Estefânia to the east. Adjacent to the Estefânia neighbourhood was the grand new avenue Avenida Rainha Dona Amélia (now rebuilt as Avenida Almirante Reis), linking it to the Martim Moniz. <b>All</b> <b>these</b> <b>new</b> developments transformed the city. The lower middle class and the common people settled in the eastern side of the city, while the upper middle classes and the wealthy bourgeoisie moved to the western side, with the Baixa being the location of the larger retail establishments.|$|E

500|$|The main {{character}} of the series was originally meant to be Toshiro Hijikata as Sorachi was {{a fan of the}} Shinsengumi, most notably from Hijikata Toshizō (the Shinsengumi who was the base for the one of Gin Tama), after he saw the film Burn! Sword!. When Sorachi could not [...] "shake off" [...] Hijikata's initial design, he decided not to use him as the lead character, but added him along with the Shinsengumi to the story. The pilot chapter from the series had a different plot to the one from the serialization: Shinpachi already met Gintoki in the story and there were more Shinsengumi to the story such as one based on Harada Sanosuke. As <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>new</b> Shinsengumi were older than most of the recurring characters [...] from the series, Sorachi removed them thinking they were not entertaining.

500|$|A main {{element of}} Debuts sound is its {{incorporation}} of dance music, reflecting the contemporary styles of London's club culture, {{with which the}} singer had established close ties. While the echoes of subgenres such as Euro-house, acid jazz, worldbeat and IDM can be noted, [...] "they hadn't yet broken free from the primal thump of four-on-the-floor house music." [...] Tom Breihan of Stereogum asserts that [...] "even as dance music took on <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>new</b> sounds, that basic pulse was still {{the most important thing}} about it, and that pulse reverberates all through Debut." [...] Björk said: [...] "A lot of the songs on my record have dance beats, but I think they're beats that are more reflective of daily life—like life in the middle of the day in a city, as opposed to the night life of the clubs." [...] The [...] "four-on-the-floor" [...] style —typical of house music— is mostly evident in songs such as [...] "Human Behaviour", [...] "Crying", [...] "Big Time Sensuality", [...] "There's More to Life Than This" [...] and [...] "Violently Happy".
