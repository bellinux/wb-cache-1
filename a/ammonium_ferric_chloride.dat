When gonococci and spermatozoa were mixed together in media with and without AFC, the proportion of spermatozoa with adherent gonococci was approximately the same in each case.

Comparable results are obtained with these iron salts. To determine cholesterolin biologicalfluids,use of the ferric chloride-sulfuric acid reagent introduced by Zlatkis et al. (1) is relatively simple and reliable (2, 3), and the sensitivityof the reagent for cholesterol is four to five times greater than that of the Liebermann-Burchard re-agent (2). However, Parekh and Jung (4) reported that hydrogen chloride is evolved during the ferric chloride-sulfuric acid reaction,leading to poor control of reaction temperature.

40|$|Ferrate is {{believed}} to have a dual role in water treatment, both as oxidant and coagulant. Few studies have considered the coagulation effect in detail, mainly because of the difficulty of separating the oxidation and coagulation effects. This study aims to evaluate the coagulation performance of ferrate together with its oxidation effect in water and wastewater treatment processes, as it has not been studied thoroughly in previous work. The study involves laboratory-based experiments that investigate the coagulation reaction dynamically via a PDA instrument, between ferrate and a suspension of kaolin powder, and humic acid solution at different doses and pH values, and comparing the observation with the use of <b>ferric</b> <b>chloride.</b> The PDA output gives a comparative measure of the rate of floc growth and the magnitude of floc formation. The results of the tests with kaolin suspension show some similarities and significant differences in the pattern of behaviour between ferrate and <b>ferric</b> <b>chloride.</b> Ferrate demonstrated very similar coagulation characteristics to <b>ferric</b> <b>chloride</b> with regard to the influence of pH and Fe dose. However, the magnitude of floc formation with ferrate was always inferior to that with <b>ferric</b> <b>chloride.</b> The rate of floc growth with ferrate was slower and sometimes less extensive than that with <b>ferric</b> <b>chloride</b> in most cases. It was discovered that the reason for the inferior performance of ferrate was the slow formation of Fe(III) species at neutral to high pH owing to the low degradation rate of ferrate in aqueous solution at these pH values. The interaction between HA and ferrate was extensively investigated in comparison to <b>ferric</b> <b>chloride</b> in this study. The results reveal that ferrate achieved comparable or better floc formation to <b>ferric</b> <b>chloride</b> over a much broader Fe dose range. However, the degree of organics removal (DOC) was lower than <b>ferric</b> <b>chloride</b> (~ 5 %). The results obtained from model waters containing HA were consistent with those for samples of a natural upland coloured water.

In this study, raw water samples were collected from a lake located at the Faculty of Engineering, Universiti Putra Malaysia. The experiments were carried out in three stages: the first stage used distilled water, the second stage used lake water stored in a tank and the third stage used lake water stored in the tank and mixed with <b>ferric</b> <b>chloride</b> as coagulant. A storage tank and a separation tank were used; the storage tank is used to store water pumped from the lake (used in the second stage) while in the third stage, the stored water in tank was used for pretreatment or coagulation with optimum dosage of <b>ferric</b> <b>chloride</b> (determined from jar test). The experimental results show that the flux obtained from second and third stages was low. For lake water stage, the best flux was found to be 4. 97 Â l/m 2 /h. The distilled water stage shows that shaft rotational speed of peristaltic pump was one of the factors affecting the flux. Therefore, a pump shaft rotational speed of 7 Â rpm was chosen based on flux and suction pressure. The experimental results show the ability of microfiltration using hollow fibre membrane together with <b>ferric</b> <b>chloride</b> as coagulant to produce treated water with 97 % turbidity removal and 85 % removal of total suspended solids (TSS). For treated raw water, it is found that the removals of TSS were ranged from 71. 7 to 91. 6 % when alum was used as a coagulant while the TSS removals were ranged from 74. 4 to 89. 20 % when <b>ferric</b> <b>chloride</b> was used as a coagulant.
