5000|$|<b>Astrobotany</b> is an applied sub-discipline of botany that is {{the study}} of plants in space environments. It {{includes}} the possibility that plant life may exist on other planets. Russian astronomer Gavriil Adrianovich Tikhov is considered to be the father of <b>astrobotany.</b> [...] It is a branch of astrobiology and botany.|$|E
5000|$|Russian {{scientist}} Konstantin Tsiolkovsky {{was one of}} {{the first}} people to discuss using photosynthetic life as a resource in space agricultural systems and speculation about plant cultivation in space has been around since the early 20th century. [...] The term <b>astrobotany</b> was first used in 1945 by Russian astronomer and astrobiology pioneer Gavriil Adrianovich Tikhov.|$|E
5000|$|The {{study of}} plant {{response}} in space environments {{is the subject}} of <b>astrobotany</b> research. In space, plants encounter unique environmental stressors not found on Earth including microgravity, ionizing radiation, and oxidative stress. [...] Experiments have shown that these stressors cause genetic alterations in plant metabolism pathways. Changes in genetic expression have shown that plants respond on a molecular level to a space environment.|$|E

By installing a ring-shaped diaphragm {{in front of the}} objective he enabled an observer to deduce the color and spectral class of a star very easily. He {{was one of the first}} to use color filters to increase the contrast of surface details on planets. He was appointed head of <b>Astrobotany</b> in Alma-Ata, and investigated the possibility of life on other bodies in the solar system.|$|E
50|$|Fesenkov Astrophysical Institute (Астрофизический институт имени В. Г. Фесенкова, АФИФ), or FAPHI, is a {{research}} institute in Almaty, Kazakhstan. The institute was founded in 1941 as the Institute for Astronomy and Physics of the Kazakh branch of the USSR Academy of Sciences, {{when a group of}} Soviet astronomers was evacuated during World War II from the European parts of the USSR to Almaty. In 1948 G.A. Tikhov had organized an independent sector of <b>astrobotany,</b> and in 1950 astronomers established the Astrophysical Institute of the Kazakh SSR. In 1989 the Institute was renamed after Vasily Fesenkov, one of its founders.|$|E
