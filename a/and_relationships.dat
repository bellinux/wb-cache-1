40|$|Given the {{positive}} individual <b>and</b> <b>relationship</b> {{benefits associated with}} interpersonal forgiveness, the present study examines the association of trait forgiveness <b>and</b> <b>relationship</b> satisfaction with episodic forgiveness. One hundred and eighty participants in romantic relationships answered questions about forgiving the most serious transgression in their relationship. Both trait forgiveness <b>and</b> <b>relationship</b> satisfaction were related to forgiveness of the transgression. For participants {{in the process of}} forgiving, relationship satisfaction moderated the link between trait forgiveness and episodic forgiveness. At relatively higher levels of relationship satisfaction, trait forgiveness and episodic forgiveness were positively related whereas they were negatively related at lower levels of relationship satisfaction. Results are discussed in terms of the roles that trait forgiveness <b>and</b> <b>relationship</b> satisfaction play in regard to episodic forgiveness in romantic relationships...|$|R

5|$|Claims that Stroheim's {{original}} cut was {{a completely}} unabridged version of McTeague are not accurate. Stroheim's 300-page script was {{almost as long as}} the original novel, but he rethought the entire story and invented new scenes, as well as extensively elaborating existing ones. In the Norris novel, McTeague's back story in Placer County <b>and</b> <b>relationships</b> with his father, mother and Potter were remembered as a flashback and took two paragraphs. In Stroheim's original Greed, this sequence took up the first hour of the film and was not a flashback. Stroheim also modernized the novel's time span to between 1908 and 1923, a quarter-century later than the novel.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{stresses}} that SCI places on people <b>and</b> <b>relationships,</b> {{studies have shown}} that people with SCI are able to have happy and fulfilling romantic relationships and marriages, and to raise well-adjusted children. People with SCI who wish to be parents may question their ability to raise children and opt not to have them, but studies have shown no difference in parenting outcomes between injured and uninjured groups. Children of women with SCI do not have worse self-esteem, adjustment, or attitudes toward their parents. Women who have children post-SCI have a higher quality of life, even though parenting adds demands and challenges to their lives.|$|E

40|$|Sexual <b>and</b> <b>relationship</b> {{violence}} {{are two major}} public health issues that affect an alarming number of undergraduate students. As a result, many {{colleges and universities have}} protocols to serve victims of these forms of violence. Despite federal legislation stating that all students should have equitable experiences, current protocols and programs focus primarily on heterosexual students. College student victims of sexual <b>and</b> <b>relationship</b> violence who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender can face particular challenges, including disclosure of their sexual and gender orientations, and revictimization when seeking services. In recent years an increasing number of campuses have adopted bystander prevention strategies to address sexual <b>and</b> <b>relationship</b> violence. These strategies seek to engage community members in the prevention of sexual <b>and</b> <b>relationship</b> violence by training them to identify and safely intervene in situations where sexual or relationship violence is about to occur, is occurring, or has occurred.

5|$|For the album, the Strokes strived {{to capture}} a simple rock sound that was not {{significantly}} enhanced in the studio. Building {{on the work of}} their 2001 extended play, The Modern Age, the band members molded compositions largely through live takes during the recording sessions, while songwriter Julian Casablancas continued to detail the lives <b>and</b> <b>relationships</b> of urban youth. Following the completion of Is This It, the Strokes embarked on a promotional world tour before its release. The album's cover photograph courted controversy for being too sexually explicit and was replaced for the US market. The American track listing was also amended in light of the September 11 terrorist attacks.|$|E
