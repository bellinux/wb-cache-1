The Khmer Navy had 171 vessels; the Khmer Air Force had 211 aircraft, including 64 North American T-28s, 14 Douglas AC-47 gunships and 44 helicopters. American Embassy military personnel – who were only supposed to coordinate the arms <b>aid</b> <b>program</b> – sometimes found themselves involved in prohibited advisory and combat tasks.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 962 {{vehicles}} were produced from 1942 to 1943. It {{had originally been}} planned that Britain would receive all of the examples produced through Lend-Lease, intending to use them in the Western Desert, {{but by the time}} they arrived the campaign was over. Additionally, the purpose-built M10 tank destroyer, armed with a 3-inch gun (and later a 17-pounder gun in British service) had begun to enter production. As a result, the British transferred 650 half-tracks to the Soviet Union under the Soviet <b>Aid</b> <b>Program.</b> Britain retained 30 and the remainder were taken by the US; except for one kept by the U.S. Army, these British and American vehicles were converted back to standard M3 Half-tracks.|$|E

40|$|State {{financial}} aid policies have long focused on need-based <b>aid</b> <b>programs</b> to reduce inequalities {{in higher education}} access and completion. During the last 15 years, however, many states have shifted toward broad-based merit <b>aid</b> <b>programs</b> (Dynarski, 2004). Although such <b>aid</b> <b>programs</b> can increase access, they can also encourage grade inflation in high school (Henry & Rubenstein, 2002) and provide incentives for college students to enroll in fewer and easier courses, withdraw from classes, and increase summer school credits (Cornwell, Kyung, & Mustard, 2005). Thus, although the new merit <b>aid</b> <b>programs</b> seem to increase the probability of enrolling in higher education, they can lead to student behavior that partially undermines academic achievement. The implementation of new financial <b>aid</b> <b>programs</b> may also provide postsecondary institutions with incentives to alter {{the way that they}} operate, particularly when they exist in increasingly difficult and competitive funding environments. Despite the fact that community colleges currently enroll nearly half of all students in higher education (National Center for Education Statistics, 2006), previous research on the response of colleges to new <b>aid</b> <b>programs</b> has been largely limited to four-year colleges. A recent study conducted by the Community College Research Center (CCRC) sought to better understand how two-year public colleges react to new state merit-based financial <b>aid</b> <b>programs</b> by evaluating the institutional behavior of each of Florida’s 28 community colleges before and after th...|$|R
5|$|In the {{afternoon}} before the raids, trucks filled with soldiers headed past {{the offices of}} media outlets—from where the journalists saw them—destined for the Ấn Quang Pagoda. More troops were seen congregating at police headquarters, ready to board trucks moving towards Xá Lợi. The American-made trucks had been provided {{as part of the}} U.S. military <b>aid</b> <b>program</b> for South Vietnam. Late at night, the convoys arrived and surrounded Xá Lợi from several sides, causing a traffic jam in the city center. Several thousand personnel were estimated to have been present. Journalists were informed as soon as the attacks began, even as Nhu's men cut communications lines, and rushed to Xá Lợi.|$|E
5|$|The M19 MGMC {{served in}} Europe in World War II with the U.S. Army. By {{the time the}} M19 arrived, the Luftwaffe had been driven from the skies by Allied air power, so the M19 found use as an assault gun, which was a role it {{performed}} very well. It was never delivered to other countries for Lend-Lease or the Military <b>Aid</b> <b>Program</b> (though a few examples were transferred to the newly established JGSDF in 1954). It also served in the Korean War, for the same purpose as it was used in World War II. It {{was used in the}} defense against the North Korean forces in the Pusan Perimeter fighting and later fighting in Korea. The 40mm guns were especially effective against Chinese mass infantry charges in North Korea.|$|E
5|$|By 1985, {{international}} {{isolation and}} economic hardships had forced Vietnam to rely {{more and more}} on the Soviet Union for help. During the Chinese invasion in February 1979, the Soviet Union provided $1.4 billion worth of military aid to Vietnam, a figure that peaked at $1.7 billion in the period between 1981 and 1985. Then, to help Vietnam implement its third Five Year Plan (1981–1985), the Soviet Union provided a sum of $5.4 billion to the Vietnamese Government for its expenditures; economic aid ultimately reached $1.8 billion annually. The Soviet Union also provided 90 percent of Vietnam’s demand for raw materials and 70 percent of its grain imports. Even though the figures suggest the Soviet Union was a reliable ally, privately Soviet leaders were dissatisfied with Hanoi's handling of the stalemate in Kampuchea and resented the burden of their <b>aid</b> <b>program</b> to Vietnam as their own country was undergoing economic reforms. In 1986, the Soviet Government announced that it would reduce aid to friendly nations; for Vietnam, those reductions meant the loss of 20 percent of its economic aid and one-third of its military aid.|$|E
