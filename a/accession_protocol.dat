40|$|This {{descriptive}} paper {{examines the}} prevalence of ‘WTO-plus’ commitments in <b>accession</b> <b>protocols</b> of newly acceded Members, {{with a focus on}} commitments on the elimination of export duties. It presents preliminary results of a mapping exercise carried out with respect to these commitments and seeks to answer two questions. First, can any general conclusions be drawn as to {{the prevalence of}} these commitments or are they, per definition, country-specific. Second, has the political nature of the WTO accession process allowed {{for the creation of a}} two-tier membership. The first question is answered by relying on data gathered as part of the ongoing PhD-research project conducted by the author. The project aims to construct a typology of WTO-plus commitments to allow for a more detailed analysis of the relationship between these commitments and the baseline obligations in the covered agreements. The accession of China to the WTO is commonly considered as the prime example of the inclusion of WTO-plus obligations in <b>accession</b> <b>protocols.</b> The paper tries to answer the question whether this particular accession was truly unique in nature, or whether the inclusion of “Plus” obligations is less exceptional than often assumed. Additionally, the <b>accession</b> <b>protocols</b> of other recently acceded-Members are examined to establish whether the hypothesis holds. In the PhD-research project this comparative methodology will also be applied to map WTO-plus commitments in other areas, such as anti-dumping and transparency. The second question will be answered in two stages. In a preliminary stage, international institutional law will be used to by analyzing the way in which the WTO’s Dispute Settlement Body has dealt with this type of WTO-plus commitment in its jurisprudence. The second stage deals with the question of hierarchy: <b>Accession</b> <b>Protocols</b> are negotiated with the WTO Membership, by each country willing to accede to the WTO. This poses questions as to their exact position in the system of WTO law. To establish whether evidence of a two-tier membership is present, one first has to turn back to the question whether <b>Accession</b> <b>Protocols</b> are a separate (or independent) legal instrument or an “integral part” of the WTO system of covered agreements. If newly acceded Members do not benefit from the general exceptions in order to balance their more stringent, WTO-plus, obligations, this may support the conclusion that the membership of the World Trade Organization is becoming, in fact, two-tiered...|$|R

40|$|The use {{of export}} {{restrictions}} {{has become more}} and more common in recent years, evidencing the substantial loopholes existing in the WTO regulation on the matter. As a result of this deficient legal framework, the WTO membership experiences important losses of welfare and increasing political tensions.

Consequently, members have established a set of preferential bilateral and multilateral agreements to relieve the negative effects of these measures. Likewise, some recent WTO members have committed to stricter regulations as part of their <b>Accession</b> <b>Protocols.</b> Nevertheless, these methods have evidenced some important flaws, and the multilateral scene remains the optimum forum to address export restrictions.

However, the Slovenian parliament ultimately ratified Croatia's NATO accession. An unforeseen complication arose when the small, extra-parliamentary Party of Slovenian Nation (SSN) and the Institute 25 June gathered over 5,000 signatures; according to the Slovenian Constitution, this gave it time until March 2009 to gather an additional 40,000 signatures to mandate a referendum on Croatia joining NATO. NATO then expressed concern about such a complication.

40|$|The WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA) is a {{plurilateral}} Agreement, {{meaning that}} it comprises only {{a subset of the}} full Membership of the WTO. Currently, a number of WTO Members that are not Parties to the Agreement either are actively seeking accession to it, have commitments to accede to the GPA in their respective WTO <b>accession</b> <b>protocols</b> or are, on their own initiative, looking at the potential pros and cons of accession. In this context, {{there is a need for}} factual information concerning the potential consequences of GPA accession, and a framework to assess related benefits and costs. Of interest is both the systemic value of such accessions - i. e. the value they will add to the extent of market access commitments under the Agreement - and their potential benefits and costs for individual acceding Parties. This Working Paper introduces new sources of information relevant to these topics (principally, the statistical reports that have been circulated recently by GPA Parties) and shows their relevance to and usefulness in assessing the above-noted matters. The Paper presents estimates of the size of potential market access gains from pending and possible future GPA accessions, based on simple extrapolations from the data sources identified. Next, the Paper shows how the same data sources can assist in throwing light on the potential benefits and costs of GPA accession for individual WTO Members/countries contemplating accession. The latter use of the data is developed in the context of a more general discussion of the benefits and costs of GPA accession for individual WTO Members, also drawing on existing literature, qualitative aspects and insights from the field (i. e. our own work in advising and conducting seminars for such countries and other WTO Members) ...|$|R

The article examines three related concerns: how quickly large developing economies can become intensive users of antidumping measures, an evolution raising concerns about China's recent antidumping enforcement, how China could minimize its exposure to foreign antidumping cases, a recipe for both improving trade outcomes and for China's taking a leading role in reforming WTO antidumping; and the opportunities that the Doha Round of trade negotiations offer to China for negotiating stricter disciplines both on WTO contingent protection and on the use by China's trading partners of the special provisions included in China's <b>accession</b> <b>protocol.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1947 (GATT 1947) and its successor, the World Trade Organization (WTO) {{operate under}} the {{assumption}} that its Members, its participants, are “market economies. ” Economies that are characterized by a substantial or complete governmental monopoly of its trade have received special attention {{in the context of the}} multilateral trading system. In the context of Anti-dumping measures, the second Ad Note to Article VI: 1 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1947 (GATT 1947) already stipulated that in the context of Anti-dumping investigations concerning imports originating in such ‘Non-Market Economies’ (NMEs), it might not ‘be appropriate’ to rely on a strict comparison with domestic prices. The integration of NMEs into the multilateral trading system continues to raise interpretative questions for WTO panels and the Appellate Body (AB). This paper proceeds in two parts. First, it examines the way in which the incumbent membership of the GATT, and subsequently the World Trade Organization (WTO), has historically dealt with the accession of NMEs. How has the (liberal) economic theory that underpins the multilateral trading system influenced the way in which it has sought to integrate economies that arguably do not fit within this theory? The WTO <b>Accession</b> <b>Protocols</b> of NMEs such as China, Vietnam and Tajikistan for example explicitly stipulate that, for a limited period of time, special dumping methodologies may be used by the incumbent membership. This first part outlines the prevalence of ‘WTO-Plus’ commitments in the field of Anti-dumping. In the second part of this paper the practical implications of this approach will be assessed by taking a closer look at the use of the NME-methodology in the recent Anti-dumping practice of the European Union (EU) and the United States. This paper examines these recent developments and offers some preliminary observations. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Document {{presented}} for discussion at the OECD Directorate for Science Technology 2 ̆ 6 Industry, Steel Committee Meeting, 10 - 11 December 2009. The GATT authorizes three trade remedies {{that can be}} utilized {{by members of the}} WTO to address troublesome imports: antidumping measures and countervailing duties, which are authorized by Article VI, and safeguards which are authorized by Article XIX. Detailed roadmaps for the application of these measures were adopted in the Uruguay Round implementing agreements that each WTO member is required to observe in applying trade measures against imports from other WTO member countries. This Report summarizes the rules governing application of these three trade remedies and points out the major areas where there are proposals to amend the antidumping and countervailing duty implementing agreements in the Rules Negotiations that are one of the four main pillars of the DOHA Round which has been underway since the Development Agenda was agreed to by WTO members in November 2001. There is also a discussion of special rules that apply when these trade remedies are applied against imports from nonmarket economies. The discussion focuses on China which is not only the most frequent subject of antidumping and countervailing duty actions by WTO members, but is also a frequent user of the antidumping measure and has recently initiated countervailing duty investigations of imports from the United States. China is in a unique situation as a result of special provision in its WTO <b>Accession</b> <b>Protocol</b> concerning the application of these measures to its exports. The <b>Accession</b> <b>Protocol</b> also authorizes WTO members to adopt safeguards applicable uniquely to Chinese imports, such as those that were recently applied by the United States in a case involving Chinese passenger vehicle and light truck tires...|$|E
