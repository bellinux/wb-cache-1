Previous battlecruisers were built {{with a combination of}} transverse and longitudinal steel frames; the Derfflinger-class ships dispensed with the transverse frames and used only the longitudinal ones.

As with all preceding capital ships, the outer hull spaces between the hull wall and the torpedo bulkhead were used for coal storage.|$|E

Truck drivers are limited by the number of daily and weekly hours they may drive, the roads and highways they may drive upon, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> legal definition of drunkenness. The Federal Highway Administration has established 0.04 percent as the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level at or above which a CMV driver is deemed to be driving under the influence of alcohol. States maintain a BAC level between 0.08 and 0.10 percent for non-CMV drivers. In some states, trucks also have special speed limits, in addition to restrictions on driving in certain lanes (normally the far right lanes of multi-lane highways).|$|E

The superior portion is also described as the Hilfsmuskel. These two parts are now considered anatomically distinct, with the suspensory muscle referring solely to the lower structure attaching at the duodenum.|$|E

Known specimens were smaller than other tyrannosaurids like Tarbosaurus bataar and Tyrannosaurus rex, but their adult size is difficult to estimate since both Alioramus species are known only from juvenile or sub-adult remains. The recent discovery of Qianzhousaurus indicates that it belongs to a distinct branch of tyrannosaur.

5|$|Barn owls are hosts to a {{wide range}} of parasites. Fleas are present at nesting sites and {{externally}} the birds are attacked by feather lice and feather mites which chew the barbules of the feathers and which are transferred from bird to bird by direct contact. Blood-sucking flies such as Ornithomyia avicularia are often present, moving about among the plumage. Internal parasites include the fluke Strigea strigis, the tape worm Paruternia candelabraria, several species of parasitic round worm and spiny-headed worms in the genus Centrorhynchus. These gut parasites are acquired when the birds feed on infected prey which provide intermediate hosts for the parasites. There is some indication that female birds with more and larger spots have a greater resistance to external parasites. This is correlated with smaller bursae of Fabricius, glands associated with antibody production, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> fecundity of the blood-sucking fly Carnus hemapterus that attacks nestlings.|$|E
5|$|Challenging {{the very}} core of the caste-based society, the Veerashaivas {{conducted}} a marriage between an upper caste Brahmin bride <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> caste Shudra groom. The resulting confrontation between rebellious Veerashaivas and the conservative upper classes lead to the assassination of King Bijjala II and the eviction of most devotees, including Basavanna, from Kalyani. The successors of King Bijjala II were weak, prompting Chalukya Someshvara IV, ruling from Annigeri, to attempt rebuilding his empire by invading Kalyani in 1183. Though his invasion was successful, his overall efforts failed and the dynasty was ended by the Seuna rulers who drove Someshvara IV into exile in Banavasi in 1189. Though these turbulent events caused a setback to the Veerashaiva gatherings and creation of poems, the movement had set roots in the Kannada soil and regained popularity in the 15th century under the patronage of the rulers of the Vijayanagara Empire.|$|E

The working age population (females and males between 16 and 64) is lower than England and Wales average, 60% compared to 64%. Data collected between 2010 and 2012 shows that average life expectancy at birth in the county is 85.3 years for females and 81.2 years for males. This compares favourably with the averages for England and Wales of 82.9 and 79.1 years respectively. Around 95.2% of Dorset's population are of white ethnicity, 60.9% of the population are Christian and 28.5% say they are not religious.|$|E

5|$|During period Q, Tell Brak was an {{important}} trade city in the Mitanni state. A two-story palace was built c. 1500 BC in the northern section of the tell, {{in addition to an}} associated temple. However, the rest of the tell was not occupied, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> town extended to the north but is now all but destroyed through modern agriculture. Two Mitannian legal documents, bearing the names of kings Artashumara and Tushratta, were recovered from the city, which was destroyed between c.1300 and 1275 BC, in two waves, first {{at the hands of the}} Assyrian king Adad-Nirari I, then by his successor Shalmaneser I.|$|E
5|$|Following its destruction, Nagar was rebuilt by the Akkadian empire, to form {{a center}} of the provincial administration. The city {{included}} the whole tell <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> town at {{the southern edge of}} the mound. Two public buildings were built during the early Akkadian periods, one complex in area SS, and another in area FS. The building of area FS included its own temple and might have served as a caravanserai, being located near the northern gate of the city. The early Akkadian monarchs were occupied with internal conflicts, and Tell Brak was temporarily abandoned by Akkad at some point preceding the reign of Naram-Sin. The abandonment might be connected with an environmental event, that caused the desertification of the region.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, Peter and Barbara McGregor {{began to}} restore {{the ruins of the}} castle, {{with the support of the}} Department of the Environment, Kent County Council and the British Army. As part of the project, archaeological {{investigations}} were carried out between 1975 and 1979 by Edward Harris. The part of the 1806 esplanade around the north-east bastion was excavated, revealing the lower 16th-century stonework of the tower and the east side of the 1859 magazine, and a retaining wall was built to support the newly exposed walls. This created two levels in the outer bailey: a higher level on the western side, which still covered the north-west tower, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> one on the eastern. The keep was turned into a private residence, with a new sun room built on top of the gun platform. In 2000, Geoffrey Boot and his wife acquired the castle, which is now used by Boot's company, AMT South Eastern Ltd.|$|E

5|$|Lōʻihi is {{following}} the pattern of development that is characteristic of all Hawaiʻian volcanoes. Geochemical evidence from Lōʻihi lavas indicates that Lōʻihi is in transition between the preshield and shield volcano stage, providing valuable clues to the early development of Hawaiian volcanoes. In the preshield stage, Hawaiian volcanoes have steeper sides <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> level of activity, producing an alkali basalt lava. Continued volcanism is expected to eventually create an island at Lōʻihi. Lōʻihi experiences frequent landslides; {{the growth of the}} volcano has destabilized its slopes, and extensive areas of debris inhabit the steep southeastern face. Similar deposits from other Hawaiian volcanoes indicate that landslide debris is an important product of the early development of Hawaiian volcanoes. Lōʻihi is predicted to rise above the surface in 10,000 to 100,000 years.|$|E

5|$|Surface {{decompression}} is {{a procedure}} {{in which some}} or all of the staged decompression obligation is done in a decompression chamber instead of in the water. This reduces the time that the diver spends in the water, exposed to environmental hazards such as cold water or currents, which will enhance diver safety. The decompression in the chamber is more controlled, in a more comfortable environment, and oxygen can be used at greater partial pressure as there is no risk of drowning <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>lower</b> risk of oxygen toxicity convulsions. A further operational advantage is that once the divers are in the chamber, new divers can be supplied from the diving panel, and the operations can continue with less delay.|$|E
