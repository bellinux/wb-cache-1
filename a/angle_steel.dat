Also, an analytical model was developed using a simple stress mechanics and strain compatibility to obtain the ultimate loads of the strengthened columns including the effect of the confining stress due to the steel cage and axial forces in the vertical angles considering both directly and indirectly connected cases. It was concluded that using this strengthening method is very efficient and a gain in the axial load capacity of the strengthened columns was obtained. This gain was due to the confinement effect of the external steel cage, and the ability of the <b>steel</b> <b>angle</b> to resist an extensive part of the applied axial load.

40|$|AbstractColumn is an {{important}} structural element in a building, because it carries some loads from the beams and the floors connecting to the column. Sometimes it needs to strengthen the existing column for some reasons. For example the load capacity of the column must be increased due to the compressive strength of the concrete column does not comply with the specified requirement. Investigation of the reinforced concrete column with <b>angle</b> <b>steel</b> shapes embedded {{at the corner of}} the column is limited. Therefore, it needs to investigate before developing the analysis for practical purpose design. This research conducts the experimental program of the reinforced concrete column with equal-leg <b>angle</b> <b>steel</b> shapes embedded at corner of the column. Eight specimens were tested in this experimental program. Four columns were subjected to the concentrically load and the others were subjected to eccentrically load. The specimens which embedded with <b>angle</b> <b>steel</b> shapes have various stiffeners spacing of 50 mm; 100 mm, and 150 mm. The column has length of 750 mm with sectional dimension of (75 mm x 75 mm). The column has four longitudinal reinforcements of 8 mm and stirrup of 5 mm. The equal-leg <b>angle</b> <b>steel</b> shape has size of (22. 1 mm x 22. 1 mm x 2 mm).

Advanced composites have {{become one of the}} most popular techniques of repairing and/or strengthening civil infrastructure in the past couple of decades. The use of FRP material for the repair and rehabilitation of steel members has numerous benefits over the traditional methods of bolting or welding of steel plates. Carbon FRPs (CFRPs) have been preferred over other FRP material for strengthening of steel structures due to CFRPs possess higher stiffness. The emergence of high modulus CFRP, with an elastic modulus higher than that of steel, enables researchers to achieve substantial load transfer in steel beams before the steel yields. In the present work, experimental investigation is carried out to analyze the behavior of <b>steel</b> <b>angle</b> sections wrapped with carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) to increase flexural strength and stiffness of parent structural member <b>steel</b> <b>angle</b> section due to CFRP wrapping. A total of 4 tensile coupon tests are conducted to determine the engineering properties of structural steel used. A novel flexural strengthening technique using bonded CFRP wrapping to enhance the strength and stiffness of existing <b>steel</b> <b>angle</b> sections has been developed. This is carried out by varying the CFRP wrap configurations and keeping adhesive properties constant. The experimental program consists of two sets each with 15 specimens to test a total of 30 specimens. Each set has five subsets as four different strengthening configurations and a set representing reference control specimens. The parameters studied include the slenderness ratio (b/t) of <b>steel</b> <b>angles,</b> the thickness and orientation of the CFRP wrap, comparative study on behavior of strengthened specimens, investigation on stiffness enhancement and strain variation across the section in relation with load. This research investigated experimentally the behavior transformation of open sections into closed section, stiffening enhancement in elastic region and strength enhancement in both elastic and post yield regions of high strength CFRP vi strengthened structural <b>steel</b> <b>angles</b> tested under four point bending system in comparison with bare <b>steel</b> <b>angles.</b> Proposed external wrapping (bonded) CFRP reinforcement has been clearly established as a promising alternative to existing strengthening technique for steel structures.
