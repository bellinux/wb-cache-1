5|$|At {{the final}} {{meeting of the}} World Motorsports Commission in December 2011, a series of {{amendments}} to the sporting regulations were published. Chief among these is the re-introduction of a rule that will allow all lapped traffic under the safety car (which remained the Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG introduced in 2010) {{to be released from}} the queue before the car returns to pit lane, allowing the drivers to unlap themselves <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> a clean restart.|$|E

5|$|Life in a workhouse was {{intended}} to be harsh, to deter the able-bodied poor <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> that only the truly destitute would apply. But in areas such as the provision of free medical care and education for children, neither of which was available to the poor in England living outside workhouses until the early 20th century, workhouse inmates were advantaged over the general population, a dilemma that the Poor Law authorities never managed to reconcile.|$|E

5|$|After any of {{the above}} {{approaches}} are used to design the secondary structure of a target complex, an actual sequence of nucleotides that will form into the desired structure must be devised. Nucleic acid design is the process of assigning a specific nucleic acid base sequence to each of a structure's constituent strands so that they will associate into a desired conformation. Most methods have the goal of designing sequences so that the target structure has the lowest energy, and is thus the most thermodynamically favorable, while incorrectly assembled structures have higher energies and are thus disfavored. This is done either through simple, faster heuristic methods such as sequence symmetry minimization, or by using a full nearest-neighbor thermodynamic model, which is more accurate but slower and more computationally intensive. Geometric models are used to examine tertiary structure of the nanostructures <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> that the complexes are not overly strained.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Agrippa in 12BC, a {{solution}} had {{to be found in}} maintaining Rome's water supply system. This came about because it was overseen by Agrippa when he served as aedile, and was even funded by him afterwards when he was a private citizen paying at his own expense. In that year, Augustus arranged a system where the Senate designated three of its members as prime commissioners in charge of the water supply <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> that Rome's aqueducts did not fall into disrepair.|$|E
5|$|Bills {{for three}} {{similarly}} inspired new underground railways were also submitted to Parliament for the 1892 parliamentary session, <b>and,</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> a consistent approach, a Joint Select Committee {{was established to}} review the proposals.

After rejecting the construction of stations on land owned by the Crown Estate and the Duke of Portland between Oxford Circus and Baker Street, the Committee allowed the BS bill to proceed for normal parliamentary consideration.|$|E

5|$|In 1961, Nasser {{sought to}} firmly {{establish}} Egypt {{as the leader}} of the Arab world and to promote a second revolution in Egypt with the purpose of merging Islamic and socialist thinking. To achieve this, he initiated several reforms to modernize al-Azhar, which serves as the de facto leading authority in Sunni Islam, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> its prominence over the Muslim Brotherhood and the more conservative Wahhabism promoted by Saudi Arabia. Nasser had used al-Azhar's most willing ulema (scholars) as a counterweight to the Brotherhood's Islamic influence, starting in 1953.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{appointed}} nine Article III {{federal judges}} during his presidency, all to United States district courts; {{he did not}} appoint a justice {{to serve on the}} Supreme Court.

5|$|Responsibility {{for running}} the {{university}} is held at an executive level by the vice-chancellor, but the council is the only body that can recommend changes to the university's statutes and charter, {{with the exception of}} academic ordinances. These can only be made with the consent of the senate, the chief academic body in the university which also holds responsibility for teaching and learning, examinations and research and enterprise. The chancellor and pro chancellors are nominated by council and appointed formally by court, whose additional powers are now limited to these appointments and a few others, including some lay members of council. Finally, Convocation, the body of all staff, ceremonial officers and graduates of the university, returns 100 members to court and one member to council, but is otherwise principally a forum for discussion <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> graduates stay in touch with the university.|$|E

In 2005, Alexandria's Archaeological Protection Code requirement forced Diamond Properties to halt its construction to allow for an archaeological excavation of the Colross site. The excavation occurred between March and June 2005, as mandated by the city of Alexandria. Diamond Properties paid R.

5|$|After {{the ruler}} of the other {{dimensional}} realm Outworld, Shao Kahn, conquered the realm of Edenia and merged it with his own, he decided he would keep the former king's daughter Kitana alive and raise her as his own. Though she grew up knowing nothing of her origin, the emperor nonetheless feared that one day Kitana would discover her true parentage and turn against him, and so he ordered Shang Tsung to bring to life a more vicious and loyal version of Kitana that could take her place if necessary. This was done by fusing her essence with a Tarkatan warrior from Baraka's race. The process was not a complete success, however, as the hybrid clone was disfigured with the hideous mouth of the Tarkata. Instead of replacing Kitana, as originally planned, Mileena {{would be used to}} spy on her <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> her allegiance to him, and so Shao Kahn introduced Mileena to Kitana as her supposedly lost twin sister. The two thus grew up together as his daughters and elite personal assassins, although Mileena grew to harbor a great bitterness and jealousy towards Kitana, whom Kahn favored over her.|$|E
5|$|As a result, castle {{building}} by the Norman nobility across England and the Marches lacked a grand strategic plan, reflecting local circumstances such as military factors and {{the layout of}} existing estates and church lands. Castles were often situated along the old Roman roads that still formed the backbone for travel across the country, both to control {{the lines of communication}} <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>ensure</b> easy movement between different estates. Many castles were built close to inland river ports and those built on the coast were usually located at the mouths of rivers or in ports, Pevensey and Portchester being rare exceptions. Some groups of castles were located so as to be mutually reinforcing – for example the castles of Littledean Camp, Glasshouse Woods and Howle Hill Camp were intended to act as an integrated defence for the area around Gloucester and Gloucester Castle for Gloucester city itself, while Windsor was one of a ring of castles built around London, each approximately a day's march apart. Some regional patterns in castle building can also be seen – relatively few castles were built in East Anglia compared to the west of England or the Marches; this was probably due to the relatively settled and prosperous nature of the east of England and reflected a shortage of available serfs, or unfree labour.|$|E
