500|$|After {{graduating from}} Shortridge in 1940, Vonnegut {{enrolled}} at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. He {{wanted to study}} the humanities or become an architect like his father, but his father and brother, a scientist, urged him to study a [...] "useful" [...] discipline. As a result, Vonnegut majored in biochemistry, but he had little proficiency {{in the area and}} was indifferent towards his studies. As his father had been a member at MIT, Vonnegut was entitled to join the Delta Upsilon fraternity, <b>and</b> <b>did.</b> <b>He</b> overcame stiff competition for a place at the university's independent newspaper, The Cornell Daily Sun, first serving as a staff writer, then as an editor. By the end of his freshman year, he was writing a column titled [...] "Innocents Abroad" [...] which reused jokes from other publications. He later penned a piece, [...] "Well All Right", [...] focusing on pacifism, a cause he strongly supported, arguing against U.S. intervention in World War II.|$|E
500|$|Van Chester Thompkins was {{considered}} a suspect in a fatal shooting on January 10, 2000 in Southfield, Michigan. After advising Thompkins of his Miranda rights, police officers interrogated him. Thompkins did not state at any time {{that he wanted to}} rely on his right to remain silent, nor {{that he did not want}} to talk to the police, nor that he wanted an attorney. The court record suggested that he had been almost completely silent during the three-hour interrogation and the few sporadic comments he made had no bearing on the case (police described it as [...] "nearly a monologue"), but near the end, detectives changed their approach and [...] "tried a spiritual tac" [...] and an [...] "appeal to his conscience and religious beliefs". Thompkins was asked in sequenceâ€”did he believe in God, did he pray to God, <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> pray to God to forgive him for shooting the victim. He answered [...] "yes" [...] to each of these. Thompkins made a motion to suppress his statements, claiming that he had invoked his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, that he had not waived that right, and that his inculpatory statements were involuntary. The trial court denied his motion and Thompkins was found guilty by a jury and sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Of note, there had been significant other evidence of guilt corroborating the conviction.|$|E

2500|$|Audio: At {{one point}} Warhol carried a {{portable}} recorder with him wherever he went, taping everything everybody said <b>and</b> <b>did.</b> <b>He</b> {{referred to this}} device as his [...] "wife". Some of these tapes were the basis for his literary work. Another audio-work of Warhol's was his Invisible Sculpture, a presentation in which burglar alarms would go off when entering the room. Warhol's cooperation with the musicians of The Velvet Underground was driven by an expressed desire to become a music producer.|$|E
2500|$|On 15 December, Robert Barton was {{questioned}} by Kevin O'Higgins about his notes on Lloyd George's statement about signing the agreement or facing {{a renewal of}} war: [...] "Did Mr Lloyd George single Mr Barton out as the left wing of the delegation <b>and</b> <b>did</b> <b>he</b> say, 'The man who is against peace may bear now and forever the responsibility for terrible and immediate war?'" [...] Barton replied: [...] "What he did say was that the signature and the recommendation of {{every member of the}} delegation was necessary, or war would follow immediately and that the responsibility for that war must rest directly upon those who refused to sign the Treaty". This was seized upon by opponents of the treaty as a convenient proof that the Irish delegates had been subjected to duress at the last minute, and [...] "terrible and immediate war" [...] became a catch-phrase in the debates that followed. The next day, de Valera took up this point: [...] "... therefore what happened was that over there a threat of immediate force upon our people was made. I believe that that document was signed under duress and, though I have a moral feeling that any agreement entered into ought to be faithfully carried out, I have no hesitation in saying that I would not regard it as binding on the Irish nation." ...|$|E
