25|$|Early (1973) {{evaluations}} of the processes for removing dissolved arsenic from drinking water demonstrated the efficacy of co-precipitation with either iron or aluminum oxides. In particular, iron as a coagulant was found to remove arsenic with an efficacy exceeding 90%. Several adsorptive media systems have been approved for use at point-of-service in a study funded by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) and the National Science Foundation (NSF). A team of European and Indian scientists and engineers have set up six arsenic treatment plants in West Bengal based on in-situ remediation method (SAR Technology). This technology does not use any chemicals and arsenic is left in an insoluble form (+5 state) in the subterranean zone by recharging <b>aerated</b> <b>water</b> into the aquifer and developing an oxidation zone that supports arsenic oxidizing micro-organisms. This process does not produce any waste stream or sludge and is relatively cheap.|$|E
25|$|Presented as W Smith's Chemist and JR & D Edis Photographers, a two-storey {{building}} housing both {{a chemist}} and photographers shops {{under one roof}} opened on 7 May 2016 and represents {{the growing popularity of}} photography in the era, with shops often growing out of or alongside chemists, who had the necessary supplies for developing photographs. The chemist features a dispensary, and equipment from various shops including John Walker, inventor of the friction match. The photographers features a studio, where visitors can dress in period costume and have a photograph taken. The corner building is based on a real building on Elvet Bridge in Durham City, opposite the Durham Marriot Hotel (the Royal County), although the second storey {{is not part of the}} display. The chemist also sells <b>aerated</b> <b>water</b> (an early form of carbonated soft drinks) to visitors, sold in marble-stopper sealed Codd bottles (although made to a modern design to prevent the safety issue that saw the original bottles banned). Aerated waters grew in popularity in the era, due to the need for a safe alternative to water, and the temperance movement - being sold in chemists due to the perception they were healthy in the same way mineral waters were.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the oxygen transfer characteristics of an ejector aeration system. In order to evaluate the oxygen transfer performance of the ejector aeration system, a comparative experiment was conducted on a conventional blower aeration system. The effect of entrained air flow rate and <b>aerating</b> <b>water</b> temperature on the oxygen transfer efficiency was investigated. The dissolved oxygen concentration increased with increasing entrained air flow rate, but decreased with increasing <b>aerating</b> <b>water</b> temperature for two aeration systems. The volumetric mass transfer coefficient increased with increasing entrained air flow rate and with increasing <b>aerating</b> <b>water</b> temperature for both aeration systems. The average mass transfer coefficient for the ejector aeration system was about 20 % and 42 % higher than that of the blower aeration system within the experimental range of entrained air flow rates and <b>aerating</b> <b>water</b> temperatures...|$|R

2500|$|Holes, or [...] "hydraulics", (also {{known as}} [...] "stoppers" [...] or [...] "souse-holes". See also Pillows), are formed when water pours {{over the top}} of a {{submerged}} object, or underwater ledges, causing the surface water to flow back upstream toward the object. [...] Holes can be particularly dangerous - a boater may become stuck under the surface, in the recirculating water, or entertaining play-spots, where paddlers use the holes' features to perform various playboating moves. [...] In high and low volume water flow, holes can subtly aerate the water, enough to allow craft to fall through the <b>aerated</b> <b>water</b> to the bottom of a deep 'hole'.|$|E
2500|$|According to the New York City Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), {{plans to}} reactivate the {{flushing}} tunnel pump were proposed in 1982. Various events caused {{the project to}} be delayed until 1994. The tunnel was finally reactivated in 1999. The new design employed a 600 horsepower (450kW) motor, that pumped an average rate of [...] a day of <b>aerated</b> <b>water</b> from Buttermilk Channel of the East River into the head end of the canal. Although water was circulating through the tunnel, {{it could only be}} pumped 11 hours a day, due to tidal forces. Water quality was reported to have improved, at least the quality of water samples taken while the flushing pump was operating.|$|E
2500|$|In {{subterranean}} arsenic removal (SAR), aerated groundwater is recharged {{back into}} the aquifer to create an oxidation zone which can trap iron and arsenic on the soil particles through adsorption process. The oxidation zone created by <b>aerated</b> <b>water</b> boosts {{the activity of the}} arsenic-oxidizing microorganisms which can oxidize arsenic from +3 to +5 state [...] No chemicals are used and almost no sludge is produced during operational stage since iron and arsenic compounds are rendered inactive in the aquifer itself. Thus toxic waste disposal and the risk of its future mobilization is prevented. Also, it has very long operational life, similar to the long lasting tube wells drawing water from the shallow aquifers.|$|E

2500|$|A boulder or ledge in {{the middle}} of a river or near the side can obstruct the flow of the river, and can also create a [...] "pillow"; when water flows {{backwards}} upstream of the obstruction, or a [...] "pour over" [...] (over the boulder); and [...] "hydraulics" [...] or [...] "holes" [...] where the river flows back on itself—perhaps back under the drop—often with fearful results for those caught in its grasp. (Holes, or hydraulics, are so-called because their foamy, <b>aerated</b> <b>water</b> provides less buoyancy and can feel like an actual hole in the river surface.) If the flow passes next to the obstruction, an eddy may form behind the obstruction; although eddies are typically sheltered areas where boaters can stop to rest, scout or leave the main current, they may be swirling and whirlpool-like. As with hydraulics (which pull downward rather than to the side and are essentially eddies turned at a 90-degree angle), the power of eddies increases with the flow rate.|$|E
2500|$|Triathletes {{will often}} use their legs less vigorously and more {{carefully}} than other swimmers, conserving their leg muscles for the cycle and run to follow. Many triathletes use altered swim strokes {{to compensate for}} turbulent, <b>aerated</b> <b>water</b> and to conserve energy for a long swim. In addition, the majority of triathlons involve open-water (outdoor) swim stages, rather than pools with lane markers. As a result, triathletes in the swim stage must jockey for position, and can gain some advantage by drafting, following a competitor closely to swim in their slipstream. Triathletes will often use [...] "dolphin kicking" [...] and diving to make headway against waves, and body surfing to use a wave's energy {{for a bit of}} speed {{at the end of the}} swim stage. Also, open-water swims necessitate [...] "sighting": raising the head to look for landmarks or buoys that mark the course. A modified stroke allows the triathlete to lift the head above water to sight without interrupting the swim or wasting energy.|$|E
2500|$|The Alexander Chaplin & Co. distilling {{apparatus}} {{was designed}} initially {{for use on}} board steam vessels where it could be supplied with steam from either the main boiler or a donkey boiler with cooling water circulation from a pump driven from the main engine or an auxiliary. The subsequent addition of a steam powered circulating pump integral with the apparatus meant it could then {{also be used as}} a standalone apparatus on any vessel equipped with an existing donkey (auxiliary) boiler, such as a sailing ship equipped with steam winches. The apparatus consisted of a coiled condensing pipe approximately [...] in length placed inside a cylindrical casing filled with constantly changed cooling water. The casing was cast iron and the coils were made of copper. The coils were supplied with steam either from the exhaust of the engine, or from a feed directly from the boiler. A circulating pump, either driven from the main engine on a steam ship, or integrated with the apparatus on a sailing ship, supplied a constant stream of cooling water flowing through the condenser. A covered brass cup with small adjustable holes around the circumference was fitted at {{the upper end of the}} steam coil. In operation, a steam jet drew air in from the circumferential openings in the cup and filled the coils with a mixture of air and steam, both cooling the steam and reducing its pressure. As it passed down the coil, the air/steam mixture was further cooled by the surrounding water, and condensed as water droplets on the walls of the coil. The <b>aerated</b> <b>water</b> would collect as a clear, bright and odourless liquid at a temperature of about [...] at the bottom of the coil, to be drawn off for use. The machine could supply approximately [...] of water per hour. [...] "The samples of water subjected to analysis were collected at different times directly from the Patent Apparatus on board ship... and the results of my experiments with the water distilled in Alexander Chaplin & Co.'s are conclusive in showing that is of excellent quality in every particular." ...|$|E
