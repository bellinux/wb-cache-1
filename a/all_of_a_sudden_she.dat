It became the first adaptation to show the character's progression from Batgirl to Oracle, which included her paralysis {{at the hands of}} the Joker. Meyer commented on her character's complex history stating: [...] "She's multidimensional. She was a former superhero. She was extremely active physically for years, fighting alongside Batman. The unfortunate incident with the Joker took away the use of her legs... but rather than give up and throw in the towel, as she could've done so easily, she went and studied escrima (a martial art), got stronger in her mental state and, while helping out her father on a case one day, realized she had a knack for solving mysteries. And <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> <b>she</b> became this computer genius." [...] Overall, the series received criticism for its emphasis on aesthetics over plot. It aired for one season before receiving cancellation. In the fourth season of the TV series Arrow, after Felicity Smoak suffered a similar paralyzing injury, Oliver Queen gives her the codename Overwatch while commenting that [...] "Oracle" [...] was taken. Although, in the comic books Barbara Gordon was never a member of the Teen Titans she was slated to appear in the live-action Titans series for TNT. This version of the character will be a wheelchair-bound computer expert, but will not yet be known as Oracle. This series has since been abanndoned ...|$|E
