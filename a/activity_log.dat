25|$|<b>Activity</b> <b>Log</b> is {{a system}} {{application}} that tracks game-play and keeps a record of which games have been played and for how long, {{as well as physical}} activity, such as counting every step taken while carrying a Nintendo 3DS using its built in pedometer. The feature encourages walking every day with the system in order to earn Play Coins, at a maximum of 10 each day at a rate of one per 100 steps, to a total of 300 coins. Play Coins can then be used with compatible games and applications to acquire special content {{and a variety of other}} benefits.|$|E
25|$|In November 2013, Jawbone {{announced}} the UP24 and a software update. With similar dimensions to the UP, UP24 features {{the ability to}} sync wirelessly via Bluetooth to the updated app. UP24 has as a 7-day battery life (depending on use) and the previous 3.5mm connector {{was replaced by a}} 2.5mm connector. The software provided more real-time information to help motivate users. The app also suggests goals based on user's habits. Live notifications are provided on the UP24 so users will get push notifications when they get close to their goals. A new <b>activity</b> <b>log</b> gives a snapshot of a user's day and when the UP24 last synced. The 3.0 app also will automatically analyze sleep data from the previous night if users forget to press the button for sleep mode, and lets users edit sleep/wake times.|$|E

50|$|UAM uses screen-recording {{technology}} that captures individual user actions. Each video-like playback is saved {{and accompanied by}} a user <b>activity</b> <b>log.</b> Playbacks differ from traditional video playback to screen scraping, which is the compiling of sequential screen shots into a video like replay. The user activity logs combined with the video-like playback provides a searchable summary of all user actions. This enables companies to not only read, but also view exactly what a particular user did on company systems.|$|E

The type of project, its rigor and its expectations are set by the individual school district. At Central Dauphin graduation projects require a portfolio which includes: research, an <b>activity</b> <b>log,</b> a reflection paper, and a final presentation of the project. The project may focus on career options, service options or academic options which are all described in the graduation project manual for students. Effective with the graduating class of 2017, the Pennsylvania State Board of Education eliminated the state mandate that students complete a culminating project in order to graduate.|$|E

Rikuo Sakisaka, who has taken robots for granted for his entire life, one day discovers that Sammy, his home android, has been acting {{independently}} and coming and going on her own. He finds a strange phrase recorded in her <b>activity</b> <b>log,</b> [...] "Are you enjoying the Time of Eve?". He, along with his friend Masakazu Masaki, trace Sammy's movements and finds an unusual cafe, [...] "The Time of Eve". Nagi, the barista, informs them that the cafe's main rule is to not discriminate between humans and androids. Within the cafe, androids do not display their status rings, and, when patrons depart, the door is automatically locked for two minutes to prevent someone from following them to discover their true nature.|$|E

50|$|Kappa Fornacis A's colours and {{temperature}} {{indicate that it}} has a spectral type of G1 V, meaning that it is about 100 kelvins hotter than the Sun. On the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (left) the star lies somewhat above the main sequence, indicating that it {{is in the process of}} evolving between the dwarf and subgiant stage; this is supported by its surface gravity being lower than a typical G-dwarf and its low level of chromospheric <b>activity</b> (<b>log</b> R'HK ≈ -5.0). The star has a mass that is about a fifth larger than solar, a value that would be typical of a late F-dwarf (~F7V) when it was on the main sequence. Different methods to estimate the age of the star generally agree that Kappa Fornacis A is 5 to 6 billion years old, making it perhaps 1 billion years older than the Sun. This age corresponds to both the oldest members of the thin disk and the youngest members of the thick disk, though the system falls into the former population based on its kinematics (UVW = -19.5, -16.2, -9.6 km/s) and its close-to-solar metallicity.|$|E
5000|$|The Wii U Menu is {{the main}} {{dashboard}} of the system, acting as an application organizer and launcher. It is a graphical shell similar to the Wii's [...] "Wii Menu" [...] and Nintendo 3DS HOME Menu. It allows launching software stored on Wii U optical discs, applications installed in the internal memory or an external storage device, or Wii titles through the system's [...] "Wii Mode". The WaraWara Plaza is displayed on the TV screen, while the Wii U GamePad screen displays the application icons available for launch; the two screens' display roles can be swapped with the press of a button. Like the original Wii, discs can also be hot-swapped while in the menu. The Wii U Menu may {{also be used to}} launch applications entirely beyond just gaming: the Miiverse social network which is integrated with all games and applications; the Internet Browser for the World Wide Web; play media through Netflix, Amazon Video, Hulu, YouTube, and more; download Wii U software and content through the Nintendo eShop; and receive official notifications from Nintendo. System settings, parental controls and the <b>activity</b> <b>log</b> can also be launched through the menu.|$|E
50|$|Upper {{extremity}} dysfunction {{results from}} a variety of different diseases and disorders. The degree of dysfunction ranges from the subject's self-reported pain, weakness, and impairment of the shoulder, elbow, wrist, and hand, to larger symptoms such as debilitating post-stroke. Multiple studies have chosen to incorporate the Wii into both movement therapy and exercise regimens for patients displaying these symptoms, in order to test whether the use of Wii's motion controller will benefit these patients through a kind of gaming rehabilitation. A study done by Hsu et al. examined the effect of Wii bowling on shoulder motion range. Elderly long-term care patients with upper extremity debilities supplemented their standard exercise regimen by playing Wii Sports bowling with the affected arm for 20 minutes at least twice a week, for one month. This resulted in an overall improvement of patients' active range of shoulder motion, as well as better scores in the modified PACES (Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale) and the NHPPT (Nursing Home Physical Performance Test). Research has also shown a positive effect from Wii Sports movement therapy for stroke patients. Stroke patients with upper limb dysfunction underwent movement therapy consisting of monitored, intense Wii Sports gaming for two weeks. These patients displayed improved functional use of their dominantly affected arm and hand, along with an increase in joint range of motion. Furthermore, significant clinical improvement on test metrics such as the WMFT (Wolf Motor Function Test) and MAL-QOM (Motor <b>Activity</b> <b>Log</b> Quality of Movement) suggests that the skills gained from Wii-based movement therapy are transferable to daily-living activities.|$|E
