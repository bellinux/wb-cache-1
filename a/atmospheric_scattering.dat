We {{utilized}} this unique opportunity to compute {{the contribution of the}} scattered light within the Twin Telescope optics at Kodaikanal. The instrumental and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>scattered</b> light are derived from the model point spread function which is a combination of four Gaussians with different widths and weights. The restoration procedure has significantly improved the rms contrast of the images. The rms contrast of the stray light corrected images are almost two fold larger than that those of the uncorrected images. The derived network element sizes matches well with previous observations...|$|R

40|$|This {{report is}} the second {{in a series of}} {{companion}} papers describing the effects of <b>atmospheric</b> light <b>scattering</b> in observations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2) by the Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT), in orbit since 23 January 2009. Here we summarize the retrievals from six previously published algorithms; retrieving column-averaged dry air mole fractions of CO 2 (XCO 2) during 22 [*]months of operation of GOSAT from June 2009. First, we compare data products from each algorithm with ground-based remote sensing observations by Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON). Our GOSAT-TCCON coincidence criteria select satellite observations within a 5 Â° radius of 11 TCCON sites. We have compared the GOSAT-TCCON XCO 2 regression slope, standard deviation, correlation and determination coefficients, and global and station-to-station biases. The best agreements with TCCON measurements were detected for NIES 02. xx and RemoTeC. Next, the impact of <b>atmospheric</b> light <b>scattering</b> on XCO 2 retrievals was estimated for each data product using scan by scan retrievals of light path modification with the photon path length probability density function (PPDF) method. After a cloud pre-filtering test, approximately 25 % of GOSAT soundings processed by NIES 02. xx, ACOS B 2. 9, and UoL-FP:[*] 3 G and 35 % processed by RemoTeC were found to be contaminated by <b>atmospheric</b> light <b>scattering.</b> This study suggests that NIES 02. xx and ACOS B 2. 9 algorithms tend to overestimate aerosol amounts over bright surfaces, resulting in an underestimation of XCO 2 for GOSAT observations. Cross-comparison between algorithms shows that ACOS B 2. 9 agrees best with NIES 02. xx and UoL-FP:[*] 3 G while RemoTeC XCO 2 retrievals are in a best agreement with NIES PPDF-D...|$|R

The system should thus be able to operate as a mesosphere-stratosphere-troposphere (MST) radar, a so-called ionospheric modification facility, incoherent-scatter radar, coherent-scatter radar, and solar radar. Basically, the new facility should be a device that can operate simultaneously on several frequencies in the frequency range 5 to 50 MHz not covered by other instruments. It should comprise: powerful transmitters, capable of delivering a total average power of several megawatts; an advanced phased antenna array of high gain forming one or two steerable and well collimated beams; and an advanced data collection and analysis system...|$|R
