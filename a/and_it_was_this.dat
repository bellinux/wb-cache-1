5|$|As {{a form of}} Western esotericism, the New Age has antecedents {{that stretch}} back to {{southern}} Europe in Late Antiquity. Following the Age of Enlightenment in 18th century Europe, new esoteric ideas developed {{in response to the}} development of scientific rationality. This new esoteric trend is termed occultism by scholars, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> occultism which would be a key factor {{in the development of the}} worldview from which the New Age emerged.|$|E
5|$|Fanning married Andrea Moreno in February 2007 in Brisbane, Australia. Moreno is from Spain, {{where the}} two met while Fanning was writing and {{recording}} Tea & Sympathy in Europe. This relationship followed a twelve-year union Fanning had had with his previous girlfriend, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> break-up (along with the then-recent death of his older brother) which influenced much of the lyrical content and sombre atmospheric mood of Tea & Sympathy. Through Moreno, Fanning has learned to speak some of the Spanish language. Fanning and Moreno have performed together while Powderfinger was on hiatus and Fanning was touring as a solo artist.|$|E
5|$|Knox's {{death was}} barely noticed at the time. Although his funeral was {{attended}} by the nobles of Scotland, no major politician or diplomat mentioned his death in their letters that survive. Mary, Queen of Scots made only two brief references to him in her letters. However, what the rulers feared were Knox's ideas more than Knox himself. He was a ruthless and successful revolutionary <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> revolutionary philosophy that had {{a great impact on}} the English Puritans. Despite his strictness and dogmatism, he has also been described by partisans as contributing to the struggle for genuine human freedom, by teaching a duty to oppose unjust government in order to bring about moral and spiritual change.|$|E

5|$|When the Umayyad Muslims {{invaded the}} Iberian {{peninsula}} in 711 AD, their invasion brought Barb horses, which were crossed with native Iberian horses. The cross {{between these two}} breeds produced a war horse superior even to the original Iberian horse, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> new type that the Conquistadors introduced to the Americas. Called the Iberian war horse, this ancestor of the Lusitano was used both on the battlefield and in major riding academies throughout Europe. Bullfighting on horseback and displays of high school dressage were common entertainment for the Portuguese gentry.|$|E
5|$|After her parents' {{separation}} in 1976, Jolie and {{her brother}} lived with their mother, who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children. Her mother raised her Catholic, but did not require {{her to go to}} church. As a child, she often watched films with her mother <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>this,</b> rather than her father's successful career, that inspired her interest in acting, though at age five she had a bit part in Voight's Lookin' to Get Out (1982). When Jolie was six years old, Bertrand and her live-in partner, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York; they returned to Los Angeles five years later. Jolie then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions.|$|E
5|$|Discus {{is one of}} {{the events}} where the athlete has to throw a heavy disc in the attempt to mark a farther {{distance}} than their competitors. As one of the events within the ancient pentathlon, the history of the discus throw dates back to 708 BC. In ancient times a heavy circular disc was thrown from a set standing position on a small pedestal, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> style that was revived for the 1896 Olympics. This continued until the 1906 Intercalated Games in Athens, which featured both the ancient style and the increasingly popular modern style of turning and throwing. By the 1912 Olympics, the ancient standing throw style had fallen into disuse and contests starting within a 2.5m squared throwing area became the standard. The discus implement was standardised to 2kg (4.4pounds) in weight and 22cm (8inches) in diameter in 1907. The women's discus was among the first women's events on the Olympic programme, being introduced in 1928., although they had been competing at some national and regional levels previously.The first modern athlete to throw the discus while rotating the whole body was Czech athlete Frantisek Janda-Suk. He invented the technique when studying the position of the famous statue of Discobolus.|$|E

5|$|Prior to enclosure, Low Fell was {{predominantly}} {{inhabited by}} {{a small number of}} tinkers and hawkers but after enclosure the character of the suburb changed rapidly as people moved to be close to the new turnpike road. Although neighbouring Sheriff Hill thrived through an influx of heavy industry, built upon a colliery and pottery particularly, by 1827 new allotment owners on Low Fell had spent heavily to improve land so that sod cottages were a rarity and the last remaining pit heaps had been removed. The result was that numerous wealthy individuals were drawn to the area <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> influx which helped shape and grow the early settlement, as opposed to the more usual means of growth allied to work and industry. The 1880s were a decade of considerable building in the village, fueled by the completion of a tramway with nearby Gateshead in 1883 and this brought some light industry to the area; in the same year Mawson & Swan built their dry plate works in Kells Lane and this proved to be the first of several light industries to locate in that area. These smaller industries, allied to several farms in the Dryden Road area of the village (Dryden Farm, Orchard Cottage Dairy Farm and Derwent Crook Farm all survived in this area until the Second World War), generated a small economy in an area where inhabitants had built and settled predominantly to escape the dirt and grime of industrial Tyneside.|$|E

25|$|The New Delhi town plan, {{like its}} architecture, was chosen with one single chief consideration: to be {{a symbol of}} British power and supremacy.

25|$|On 13 July 1940, the Volksdeutsche Bewegung (VdB) {{was founded}} in Luxembourg City under the {{leadership}} of Damian Kratzenberg, a German teacher at the Athénée de Luxembourg.

25|$|Upon {{learning}} of the alleged death of Alexander, Theban exiles in Athens raced off to their native city in Boeotia and sought to incite a revolt from Macedonian rule there. The Cadmaea, the citadel that was situated upon a hill in Thebes, was occupied by a Macedonian garrison, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> place that the Thebans sought to attack. To this effect, they killed two Macedonian officers who had been roaming the city, and declared their independence from Macedonia.|$|E

25|$|Before King Kong entered production, a long {{tradition}} of jungle films existed, and, whether drama or documentary, such films generally adhered to a narrative pattern that followed an explorer or scientist into the jungle to test a theory only to discover some monstrous aberration in the undergrowth (see Stark Mad). In such films, scientific knowledge could be turned topsy-turvy at any time, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> that provided the genre with its vitality, appeal, and endurance.|$|E
25|$|Logically speaking, {{the prior}} {{question}} was whether evolution had taken place at all. It is to this question that much of Darwin's On the Origin of Species was devoted. Its publication in 1859 completely convinced Huxley of evolution <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> and no doubt his admiration of Darwin's way of amassing and using evidence that {{formed the basis of}} his support for Darwin in the debates that followed the book's publication.|$|E
25|$|Originally, {{there were}} two {{sections}} of 16 bars in 2/4 time separated by an instrumental section on the Spanish guitar called the pasacalle. The bolero proved to be exceptionally adaptable, and led to many variants. Typical was the introduction of sychopation leading to the bolero-moruno, bolero-beguine, bolero-mambo, bolero-cha. The bolero-son became for several decades the most popular rhythm for dancing in Cuba, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> rhythm that the international dance community picked up and taught as the wrongly-named 'rumba'.|$|E

25|$|After the {{decision}} to switch to diesel traction, the site was completely rebuilt in 1962 to accommodate diesels, including the Warship Class that were used on the Exeter to Waterloo services. The Factory was reformed to provide four roads with servicing pits and cab level platforms, providing facilities to repair eight locomotives at the same time. Access was via the existing traversing table. A daily servicing and fuelling point was built beside the old steam shed <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> which provided the main facility after the factory closed in 1970.|$|E
25|$|Initially, Rupert Bopape {{formed a}} team of female singers that would record songs under various group pseudonyms. Some of the most {{successful}} early recordings had been issued with the same name, Mahotella Queens, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> name that became the most recognisable to listeners. The line-up of the group would consist of five singers taken from a larger pool of vocalists that included Hilda Tloubatla, Juliet Mazamisa, Ethel and Francisca Mngomezulu, Mildred Mangxola, Nobesuthu Mbadu, Windy Sibeko, Mary Rabotapi (formerly of The Skylarks (South African vocal group) and Nunu Maseko.|$|E
