25|$|Both high RD and RI {{individuals}} {{are found to}} have difficulty in making decisions that have future consequences. Individuals high in RD experience greater reinforcement when initially engaging in the <b>addictive</b> <b>behaviour,</b> and experience stronger conditioned associations with continued use. Individuals high in RI experience greater difficulty resisting cravings {{even in the face}} of negative consequences. Some moderators of RD and RI on the severity of addiction are stress and negative affect (such as feeling depressed). That is, individuals high in RD/RI who also experience high levels of negative affect or stress, present more severe addictive behaviours. For example, if an individual is experiencing emotional distress, the distress experienced may lessen impulse control if they believe that engaging in <b>addictive</b> <b>behaviour</b> will decrease negative affect. According to this model, adolescents who are high in RI are at greater risk for developing addictions. Interestingly, low RI has been shown to moderate some of the risk of addiction due to family history. High RI for individual without a family history of addiction has been related to poor decision-making.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Attitudinal ambivalence {{occurs when}} {{individuals}} endorse {{both positive and}} negative attitudes toward the same target object. Ambivalent attitudes are particularly relevant for <b>addictive</b> <b>behaviours,</b> as these behaviours may have {{both positive and negative}} evaluations associated with them. For example, drinking alcohol may make someone relaxed but can also produce feelings of nausea. Despite this, the majority of research focused on attitudes toward <b>addictive</b> <b>behaviours</b> assume that these attitudes are either positive or negative, not positive and negative. By assessing ambivalence toward <b>addictive</b> <b>behaviours,</b> a greater {{understanding of the nature of}} attitudes underlying these behaviours can be realised. Method: A total of 247 participants (M= 28. 76 years) took part in this study. A measure of potential ambivalence, which asks participants to indicate their positive and negative evaluations on split semantic differential scales, was completed for five different health behaviours: drinking on a weekday and a weekend, exercising, increasing fruit and vegetable intake and smoking. Results: Attitudes toward alcohol consumption were found to be the most ambivalent. When examining drinking behaviour, a pattern emerged suggesting that the greater the quantity of alcohol consumed, the more ambivalent participants were toward drinking. Similar patterns were found for smoking. Conclusions: The results suggest that attitudinal ambivalence is an important aspect of <b>addictive</b> <b>behaviours,</b> as participants engaging in greater levels of these behaviours also reported higher levels of ambivalence. This indicates that individuals are aware of the positives and negatives of <b>addictive</b> <b>behaviours</b> but continue to perform them anyway...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{prevalence}} of problem gambling in a population of youths in Switzerland and to determine its association with other potentially <b>addictive</b> <b>behaviours.</b> METHODS: Cross-sectional survey including 1, 102 participants {{in the first and}} second year of post-compulsory education, reporting gambling, socio-demographics, internet use and substance use. For three categories of gambling (nongambler; nonproblem gambler and at-risk/problem gambler). socio-demographic and addiction data were compared using a bivariate analysis. All significant variables were included in a multinominal logistic regression using nongamblers as the reference category. RESULTS: The prevalence of gamblers was 37. 48 % (n = 413), with nonproblem gamblers being 31. 94 % (n = 352) and at-risk/problem gamblers 5. 54 % (n = 61). At the bivariate level, severity of gambling increased among adults (over 18 years) and among males, vocational students, participants not living with both parents and youths having a low socio-economic status. Gambling was also associated to the four <b>addictive</b> <b>behaviours</b> studied. At the multivariate level, risk of nonproblem gambling was increased in males, older youths, vocational students, participants of Swiss origin and alcohol misusers. Risk of at-risk/problem gambling was higher for males, older youths, alcohol misusers, participants not living with both parents and problem internet users. CONCLUSIONS: One-third of youths in our sample had gambled in the previous year and gambling is associated with other <b>addictive</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Clinicians should screen their adolescent patients for gambling habits, especially if other <b>addictive</b> <b>behaviours</b> are present. Additionally, gambling should be included in prevention campaigns together with other <b>addictive</b> <b>behaviours...</b>|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS: If sexual compulsivity {{and other}} <b>addictive</b> <b>behaviours</b> share common aetiology, {{contemporary}} proposals {{about the role}} of attentional processes in understanding <b>addictive</b> <b>behaviours</b> are relevant. METHODS: To examine attentional biases for sex-related words among sexually active individuals and the relationship between sexual compulsivity and sexual behavioural engagement with attentional bias, 55 sexually active individuals completed a modified Stroop task and the sexual compulsivity scale. RESULTS: Findings showed attentional bias towards sex-related stimuli among sexually active participants. In addition, among those with low levels of sexual compulsivity, levels of attentional bias were the same across all levels of sexual experience. Among those with higher levels of sexual compulsivity, greater attentional bias was linked with lower levels of sexual experience. CONCLUSION: Attentional preference for concern-related stimuli varies {{as a function of the}} interaction between how long a person has been active sexually and how compulsive their sexual behaviour is...|$|R

40|$|Gender-dependent {{differences}} {{in the rate of}} initiation and frequency of misuse of addicting drugs have been widely described. Yet, men and women also differ in their propensity to become addicted to other rewarding stimuli (e. g., sex, food) or activities (e. g., gambling, exercising). The goal of the present review is to summarize current evidence for gender differences not only in drug addiction, but also in other forms of <b>addictive</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Thus, we first reviewed studies showing gender-dependent {{differences in}} drug addiction, food addiction, compulsive sexual activity, pathological gambling, Internet addiction and physical exercise addiction. Potential risk factors and underlying brain mechanisms are also examined, with particular emphasis given to the role of sex hormones in modulating <b>addictive</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Investigations on factors allowing the pursuit of non-drug rewards to become pathological in men and women are crucial for designing gender-appropriate treatments of both substance and non-substance addictions...|$|R
40|$|Poor {{response}} inhibition {{has been}} associated {{with a wide range of}} problem <b>behaviours,</b> including <b>addictive</b> <b>behaviours,</b> and could represent a general vulnerability factor. Standard tests of response inhibition have used neutral stimuli. Here we tested whether a deficit in response inhibition in heavy drinkers would be stronger for stimuli related to their problem (alcohol) or not. Response inhibition was assessed with a stop signal task, using four classes of pictures: alcohol-related, soft drinks, erotic (control appetitive categories) and neutral pictures. Participants were 32 heavy and 32 light drinkers. An equal amount of men and women were tested in both drinking groups, in view of recent studies reporting that response disinhibition may be most pronounced in heavy drinking women. Main results were first that no domain-specific differences in response inhibition were found in both groups. Second, heavy drinking females showed stronger response inhibition deficits than other groups. Results are discussed in light of a possible gender difference in response inhibition as a risk factor for <b>addictive</b> <b>behaviours...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{journey of}} this book started more than 10 years ago. At this time, the {{efficacy}} of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) in treating anxiety and mood disorders was well established. However, the efficacy of CBT in treating problem gambling was still unclear. In addition, due to changes in government policies and social factors gambling, in particular casino and electronic machine gambling were legalized and thus, widely accessible {{to the public in}} general. Thus, problem gambling and in particular the treatment of problem gambling became an important issue. Professor Oei is one of the earlier researchers examining the efficacy of CBT for the treatment of <b>addictive</b> <b>behaviours,</b> in particular alcohol addiction (Jackson & Oei, 1978; Oei & Jackson, 1980; 1982; 1984).
