5|$|<b>Accession</b> <b>to</b> EU {{required}} {{a new law}} compliant with the European Firearms Directive, which was passed in 2002.

5|$|According to Cassius Dio, {{the conspirators}} {{approached}} Nerva {{as a potential}} successor prior to the assassination, suggesting {{that he was at}} least aware of the plot. He does not appear in Suetonius' version of the events, but this may be understandable, since his works were published under Nerva's direct descendants Trajan and Hadrian. To suggest the dynasty owed its <b>accession</b> <b>to</b> murder would have been less than sensitive.|$|E

In the summer of 1160, Foliot wrote to Pope Alexander III, whom the king had just {{recognised}} as pope instead of Alexander's rival, Victor IV, intimating that the canonisation of King Edward the Confessor, which had been delayed by Alexander's predecessor Innocent II, might be warranted as a reward for Henry's recognition of Alexander.|$|E
5|$|Ali Abu Nuwar (surname also spelled Abu Nuwwar, Abu Nawar or Abu Nowar; 1925 – 15 August 1991) was a Jordanian army officer, {{serving as}} chief of staff in May 1956 – April 1957. He participated in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War as an {{artillery}} officer in the Jordanian army's predecessor, the Arab Legion, but his vocal opposition to British influence in Jordan led to his virtual exile to Paris as military attaché in 1952. There, he forged close ties with Jordanian crown prince Hussein, who promoted Abu Nuwar after his <b>accession</b> <b>to</b> the throne.|$|E

Shortly after John became king, de Gray began travelling between England and the continent on royal business, and for {{the first two years of}} John's reign was active in the royal chancery, sealing royal charters.|$|E
5|$|Béla was crowned king {{at least}} {{two months after the}} death of Stephen II, {{implying}} that his <b>accession</b> <b>to</b> the throne did not happen without opposition. Two violent purges were carried out among the partisans of his predecessors to strengthen Béla's rule. King Coloman's alleged son Boris tried to dethrone Béla but the king and his allies defeated the pretender's troops in 1132. In the second half of Béla's reign, Hungary adopted an active foreign policy. Bosnia and Split seem to have accepted Béla's suzerainty around 1136.|$|E
5|$|Cleomenes III {{ascended the}} throne of Sparta in 236 BC or 235 BC, after deposing his father, Leonidas II. His <b>accession</b> <b>to</b> power ended a decade-long period of {{heightened}} conflict between the two royal families. Sparta's ancient dual kingship was explained by the founding legend, that the original conquerors of Sparta were twin brothers and their descendants shared Sparta. During the turmoil, Leonidas II had executed his rival king, the reformist Agis IV.|$|E

40|$|Local accessions of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) are {{extensively}} {{grown in}} Southern Ghana, where they {{play an important}} role in food security of the country. Information on the reaction of these local <b>accessions</b> <b>to</b> major diseases is scanty. This study was conducted to document the reaction of these <b>accessions</b> <b>to</b> diseases. Seventy seven accessions collected from 55 districts in southern Ghana were screened in a high disease pressure zone for seven years. Several of the accessions cultivated by farmers were found to be susceptible to African cassava mosaic disease (ACMD), cassava bacterial blight (CBB), cassava anthracnose disease (CAD) and brown leaf spot (BLS). Using DNA hybridisation and Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) techniques, a number of <b>accessions</b> were found <b>to</b> be capable of resisting the ACMD virus. Polyporus root rot disease was found on few farms in the Ashanti region. Bud necrosis disease of cassava was found in a number of farms in the humid rain forest areas of Ashanti and Brong-Ahafo regions. Disease control in cassava production was found to be highly limited in all the southern Ghana regions...|$|R

5|$|Croatia {{first elected}} 12 {{members of the}} European Parliament (MEPs) in a {{by-election}} held after its <b>accession</b> <b>to</b> the EU in 2013. Thereafter, its number of members in the European Parliament was reduced to 11 and the country elected {{them as part of}} the regular election in 2014. The elections are regulated by special legislation enacted by the Sabor. Provisions of the legislation are very similar to the parliamentary-election legislation, with the main difference being that the 11 members of the European Parliament are elected in a single constituency encompassing all of Croatia, instead of multiple constituencies used in the parliamentary elections.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before his}} <b>accession</b> <b>to</b> {{the throne of}} Belgium in 1865, the future king Leopold II began {{lobbying}} leading Belgian politicians to create a colonial empire in the Far East or Africa, which would expand and enhance Belgian prestige. Politically, however, colonisation was unpopular in Belgium as it was perceived as a risky and expensive gamble with no obvious benefit {{to the country and}} his many attempts to persuade politicians met with little success.|$|E
5|$|Hungary {{recognised}} Croatian independence on 15 January 1992 (with {{the rest}} of the European Economic Community member states), and established diplomatic relations with Croatia three days later. During the Croatian War of Independence, Croatia obtained arms from several countries (including Hungary), despite a United Nations-imposed arms embargo. As of December 2011, Hungary and Croatia have 96 treaties and agreements in force regulating a wide range of activities and relations (including diplomatic, cultural, economic, energy, transport, education, minority and other issues). Furthermore, Hungary supported the Croatian NATO membership request and Croatian <b>accession</b> <b>to</b> the European Union.|$|E

40|$|Arabidopsis thaliana, {{as a model}} species, {{has been}} widely genotyped and sequenced. Many {{studies have been done}} to {{understand}} the kinship and population structure of the species. This data and information is beneficial for understanding the genetic mechanisms of complex traits. In this thesis, we first used genotyped data for 5, 967 <b>accessions</b> <b>to</b> study the occurrence of tetraploidy in the species. We found that tetraploidy is a transient character state, and the species is a diploid species. Secondly, we used 211 K and 1. 6 M SNPs for 440 <b>accessions</b> <b>to</b> run genome-wide analyses (GWA) for four traits: glufosinate tolerance, hybrid incompatibilities, seed size, and secondary metabolites. We used two different statistical methods, EMMAX and MLMM, to calculate the associations between SNP and phenotype. Putative gene lists for each trait from each statistical model are available for the general public to find candidate genes that are involved in these traits. ...|$|R
