500|$|Miller {{had been}} warned before he began his work that he would face difficulties, but was {{unprepared}} for the level of harassment that he endured. While researching the book in the U.S., he was spied upon and was constantly followed. His friends and business associates also received hostile visits from Scientologists and private detectives trying to find [...] "dirt" [...] on him. In October 1987, Miller commented: [...] "There are teams of private detectives in the U.S. <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> questioning my friends and trying to discredit me." [...] Attempts were made to implicate him {{in the murder of}} a private detective in South London, for a fire in a Wiltshire aircraft factory and for the murder of American singer Dean Reed. Reed had died the day before Miller had arrived in East Berlin to interview him. Miller's family was approached by private detectives seeking to implicate him in Reed's death, although they would not say who their client was. Another private investigator interviewed Miller's friends and associates, claiming to be acting for Reed's family, though they denied employing him. A former Scientology insider told the Sunday Times that Miller [...] "is kept under constant watch. Every time he goes abroad a two-man mission will be waiting for him at the airport when he arrives. They will monitor where he goes, who he sees, where he stays. This information will be added to his file, which is already more than 100 pages thick." ...|$|E

2500|$|Amongst the Cuman-Kipchaks ethnic names often became {{personal}} names– {{this was}} also practiced amongst the Mongols. This practice involved naming newborns after the names of conquered tribes and people. Names such as 'Baskord' (from the Bashkirs), 'Imek' (from the Kimeks), 'Kitan' (from the Mongol Khitan people), and 'Urus' were used by the Cumans. Friar William of Rubruk, a Franciscan traveler who visited the Mongols in 1253-55, provides another account of Cuman customs. He mentions that Cumans built statues for dead notables, facing east and holding a cup (these statues {{are not to be}} confused with the balbals, which represent the enemies that were killed by him). He also notes that for richer notables, the Cumans built tombs in the form of houses. Rubruk gives an eyewitness account about a man who had recently died: the Cumans had hung up sixteen horses' hides, in groups of four, between high poles, facing the four points of the compass. The mourners then also placed kumis (a fermented mares' milk drink widely drunk in Inner Asia) for the dead man to consume. Other graves had plenty of stones statues placed around them (balbals), with four tall ones placed to face the points of the compass. Rubrick also wrote [...] "Here the Cumans, who are called Chapchat [...] used to pasture their flocks, but the Germans call them Valans and their province Valania, and Isidorus calls (the region stretching) from the river Don as far as the Azov Sea and the Danube, Alania. And this land stretches from the Danube as far as the Don, the borderline of Asia and Europe; one can reach there in two months with quick riding as the Tatars ride.... <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> which extends from the Danube to the Tanais [...] was all inhabited by the Chapcat Comans, and even further from the Don to the Volga, which rivers are at a distance of ten days' journey...And in the territory between these two rivers [...] where we continued our way, the Cuman Kipchaks lived." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract I {{examine the}} {{legitimacy}} of immigration controls {{in the context of}} Canada <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>country’s</b> restrictive immigration policies. Despite the fundamental, philosophical arguments against immigration restrictions, the necessity of immigration controls is rarely questioned in Canadian politics. In this paper I suggest that there is an incredible cynicism of Canadian immigration policies with respect to <b>this</b> <b>country’s</b> own political principles. The idea of international migration controls is neither sustainable from a larger liberaltheory perspective nor a political-economy viewpoint. I suggest that geographers should imagine alternatives to the current systems of immigration control and the regulation of the international movement of people...|$|R
