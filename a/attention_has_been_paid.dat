5|$|Scholarship in {{the area}} of Jewish Christian studies has tended to be based on {{artificial}} constructs similar to those developed by the early Christian heresiologists, with the underlying assumption that all of the beliefs and practices of these groups were based on theology. This has led to the perpetuation of ideological definitions that fail {{to take into account the}} pluriformity of these groups, reflecting differences in geography, time periods in history, and ethnicity. With respect to Epiphanius, and the Ebionites in particular, insufficient <b>attention</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> to the highly speculative nature of his theological constructs and his mixing together of disparate sources, including his use of a gospel harmony that may have had nothing to do with the Ebionite sect known to Irenaeus. In the end, he presents an enigmatic picture of the Ebionites and their place in early Christian history.|$|E

Considerable <b>attention</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> to the removal or filling of unnecessary surface join gaps and resonant cavities. Where the F/A-18A-D used grilles to cover various accessory exhaust and inlet ducts, the F/A-18E/F uses perforated panels that appear opaque to radar waves at the frequencies used. Careful <b>attention</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> to the alignment of many panel boundaries and edges, to direct reflected waves {{away from the}} aircraft in uniformly narrow angles.|$|E

25|$|When {{the light}} {{components}} in crude oil evaporate over time, they form an explosive compound with air. For this reason special <b>attention</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> to prevent sparks and high surface {{temperatures in the}} ship and its equipment. In case of chemical spills, the ship can be overpressurized to prevent potentially toxic chemical substances from entering the ship and harming its crew.

The spoon-shaped bow has a low stem angle to reduce icebreaking resistance and {{the sides of the}} barge are flared to prevent the combination from becoming immobilized by ice ridges and compressive ice fields. When the pusher is coupled to the barge, the deep stern notch forms a streamlined aftship with seakeeping characteristics similar to those of conventional ships.|$|E

The first time this issue has raised June 7, one delegate laymen offered to meet three requirements of the Russian Orthodox Church - the canonization of martyrs and confessors of the Cathedral of Russian condemnation declaration of Metropolitan Sergius (Stragorodsky) from 1927; rejection of ecumenism. Relations with the ROCOR Metropolitans were devoted to presentations Krutitsa Juvenal, Vienna Irenaeus (Zuzemilya), Archbishops Kirill of Smolensk, Saratov Pimen (Khmelevskiy), Yaroslavl Plato, Archpriest Basil Stoyanova priest Vitaly Shastina, Hieromonk Hilarion (Alfeyev) and others.|$|E
25|$|In {{the period}} from 1999 to 2016, {{increasing}} <b>attention</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> to the risks posed by so-called laser pointers and laser pens. Typically, the sale of laser pointers is restricted to either class3A (<5nbsp&mW) or classnbsp&2 (<1nbsp&mW), depending on local regulations. For example, in the US, Canada and the UK, classnbsp&3A is the maximum permitted, unless a key actuated control or other safety features are provided. In Australia, classnbsp&2 is the maximum allowed class. However, because enforcement is often not very strict, laser pointers of classnbsp&2 and above are often available for sale even in countries where they are not allowed.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{have offered}} various {{interpretations of the}} film's message and its {{significance}} for the series. Particular <b>attention</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> to the ambiguous imagery in the ending: set 700 years after the main events, the last scene depicts a statue of Caesar shedding a single tear as the Lawgiver recounts Caesar's story to an integrated audience of ape and human children. By one interpretation, the statue cries tears of joy because the species have broken the cycle of oppression, giving the series an optimistic finale. By another, the statue weeps because racial strife still exists, implying the dystopian future of Planet and Beneath is unavoidable.|$|E

25|$|Particular <b>attention</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> to {{improving}} systems in recent reforms. Many industrial multiversities and specialist colleges have been established, strengthening some incomplete subjects and establishing new specialties, e.g., automation, nuclear power, energy resources, oceanography, nuclear physics, computer science, polymer chemistry, polymer physics, radiochemistry, physical chemistry and biophysics. A project for creating 100 world class universities began in 1993, which has merged 708 schools {{of higher learning}} into 302 universities. Merging schools of higher learning has produced far-reaching reform of higher education management, optimizing of educational resources allocation, and further improving teaching quality and school standards. More than 30 universities have received help from a special national fund to support their attainment of world elite class.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the serious}} human-rights {{problems}} that face Mongolia, especially within {{the police and}} security sector, are the abuse of prisoners by police, uneven law enforcement, poor prison conditions, arbitrary arrest, excessively long periods of pretrial detention, judicial corruption, lack of media independence, government secrecy, domestic violence, and trafficking in persons. Discrimination “on the basis of ethnic origin, language, race, age, sex, social origin, or status” is forbidden, and there is official sexual equality “in political, economic, social, cultural fields, and family.” Increasing <b>attention</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> recently to the human-rights impact of {{the rapid expansion of}} the mining industry in Mongolia, which in many cases has had a deleterious impact upon the environment of traditional herders and therefore upon their everyday lives and occupational prospects.|$|E
25|$|Black {{flight is}} a term applied to the out-migration of African Americans from {{predominantly}} black or mixed inner-city areas in the United States to suburbs and outlying edge cities of newer home construction. While more <b>attention</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> to this since the 1990s, the movement of blacks to the suburbs has been underway for some time, with nine million people having migrated from 1960 to 2000. Their goals have been {{similar to those of}} the white middle class, whose out-migration was called white flight: newer housing, better schools for their children, and attractive environments. From 1990 to 2000, the percentage of African Americans who lived in the suburbs increased to a total of 39 percent, rising 5 percent in that decade. Most who moved to the suburbs after World War II were middle class.|$|E

On the inner face of the octagon the declaration of faith is followed by conflated verses describing the powers of God. Next Muhammad is introduced, with a blessing that, though not directly quoted from the Quran, was clearly already in use in 694 AD. Then comes an exhortation to Christians that Jesus was also a prophet and mortal, followed by the claim that God is sufficient unto Himself. Finally comes a command to bend to His will and the threat of reckoning for those who do not.|$|E
25|$|Galápagos green turtles {{have been}} {{recorded}} and observed in the Galápagos {{as far back as}} the 17th century by William Dampier. Not much <b>attention</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> to them due to the overwhelming research done on the Galápagos giant tortoises. Only over the last 30 years have extensive studies been performed covering the behaviors of the Galápagos green turtles. Much of the debate that has surrounded them recently is over the binomial classification of the species. It is the only subpopulation of green sea turtle to be given premise for separate species delineation, proposing Chelonia agassizii as a separate species. At this time, no distinctions have been made, mainly due to analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA of 15nesting beaches. This analysis has showed little distinction between the populations of the East Pacific waters and those of other nesting areas.|$|E
25|$|The Ultimatum caused violent anti-British sentiments in Portugal {{and demonstrations}} leading to riots.

Although much <b>attention</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> to the Portuguese reaction to the Ultimatum, less has been given to the attitude of the British government in using tactics that could have led to war, and it has been plausibly argued that Lord Salisbury, whose government was diplomatically isolated, feared being humiliated by a Portuguese success. The British government had also granted a Royal Charter to Rhodes’ British South Africa Company in October 1889, before it received news of Serpa Pinto's skirmish with the Makololo. This allowed the company to claim Mashonaland and also Manicaland and the Zambezi valley above Zumbo. Only Portugal had any claim to effective occupation of any part of the latter two areas.|$|E
