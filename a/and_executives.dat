40|$|Research {{indicates}} that youths with SCD experience {{increased levels of}} pain-related anxiety <b>and</b> <b>executive</b> functioning impairments, {{even in the absence}} of stroke. Research also {{indicates that}} pain <b>and</b> anxiety predict <b>executive</b> functioning <b>and</b> that anxiety might mediate the relation between pain <b>and</b> <b>executive</b> functioning difficulties. The current study sought to evaluate the direct associations among pain, anxiety, <b>and</b> <b>executive</b> functioning, <b>and</b> to examine whether anxiety mediates the relation between pain <b>and</b> specific <b>executive</b> functioning impairments in a sample of youths (age 10 to 19 years) with SCD with no history of stroke.

5|$|Although Enron's {{compensation}} and performance management system {{was designed to}} retain and reward its most valuable employees, the system contributed to a dysfunctional corporate culture that became obsessed with short-term earnings to maximize bonuses.

5|$|Despite Paramount's {{failure to}} build a {{national}} broadcast television network, the company retained KTLA, <b>and</b> <b>executives</b> at Paramount continued to toy {{with the idea of}} entering the television medium once more. Paramount sold its library of shorts and cartoons in separate deals to U.M. & M. TV Corporation, Associated Artists Productions and Harvey Comics (the Superman cartoons were already sold to National Comics when Paramount's license to Superman expired). In 1957, Paramount sold most of its pre-1950 sound live action feature film library to EMKA, Ltd., a subsidiary of MCA. The live action films would end up with what became Universal Television after MCA bought Universal Pictures in 1962. KTLA was eventually sold to Golden West Broadcasters, a company owned by actor and singer Gene Autry, for $12 million in 1964.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} preschoolers’ drawing flexibility, operationalized as {{their ability to}} draw a dog {{that is different from}} the human figure.

Regression analyses showed that both M capacity <b>and</b> <b>executive</b> function predicted development in dog drawing; the dog drawing score correlated with M capacity <b>and</b> <b>executive</b> function even partialling out age, motor coordination, and drawing ability (measured with Goodenough’s Draw-a-man test).

40|$|Attentional {{control has}} been {{conceptualized}} as executive functioning by neuropsychologists and as working memory capacity by experimental psychologists. We {{examined the relationship}} between these constructs using a factor analytic approach in an adult life span sample. Several tests of working memory capacity <b>and</b> <b>executive</b> function were administered to more than 200 subjects between 18 and 90 years of age, along with tests of processing speed and episodic memory. The correlation between working memory capacity <b>and</b> <b>executive</b> functioning constructs was very strong (r. 97), but correlations between these constructs and processing speed were considerably weaker (rs. 79). Controlling for working memory capacity <b>and</b> <b>executive</b> function eliminated age effects on episodic memory, and working memory capacity <b>and</b> <b>executive</b> function accounted for variance in episodic memory beyond that accounted for by processing speed. We conclude that tests of working memory capacity <b>and</b> <b>executive</b> function share a common underlying executive attention component that is strongly predictive of higher level cognition...|$|R
