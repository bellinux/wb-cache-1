60|$|There was a {{rustling}} {{and snapping}} of branches <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>pushed</b> {{her way through}} the bushes, a little stir that died insensibly into quiet again; and then the camping place became very still....|$|E
6000|$|Imogene {{lifted her}} head at last, and softly dried her eyes. Then, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>pushed</b> her {{handkerchief}} back {{into the pocket of}} her robe, [...] "What sort of looking girl was that other one?" ...|$|E
60|$|She ran quickly {{down the}} stairs, and <b>as</b> rapidly <b>as</b> <b>she</b> could, <b>pushed</b> back the heavy bolts {{of the front}} door, and slipped out into the street.|$|R
50|$|Mizuki is {{the student}} council {{president}} that works in class. To people who don't know her, {{she is the}} typical student idol, out of reach to most. To those who do know her, she can sometimes be busy and strict, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>pushes</b> all of the work onto other people. Mizuki comes from a rich family and doesn't see her own future, even the most simple one of living to the next day - something most people take for granted.|$|R
6000|$|... "This and the parlors count three, and {{the kitchen}} here is the fourth room of the eight," [...] <b>she</b> said, and <b>as</b> <b>she</b> spoke <b>she</b> <b>pushed</b> {{open the door of}} a small room, blazing with light and dense with the fumes of the dinner and the dish-washing which was now going on in a closet opening out of the kitchen.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, sir," [...] said Susan, with a glow of {{pleasure}} on her good-looking face, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>pushed</b> the tea-pot from her, and dropt the cloth, in her haste {{to get away}} to see her sire.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{had begun}} to suspect this," [...] Pamela confessed. [...] "You don't mind being put into the witness box, do you?" [...] she added, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>pushed</b> aside the menu with a little sigh of satisfaction. [...] "How wonderfully you order an American dinner!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, my dear," [...] she said, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>pushed</b> {{her hand}} through {{my arm and}} began to propel {{me away from the}} sight and hearing of people on the piazza, [...] "I hope you didn't make a fool of {{yourself}} with Kendricks. They're engaged!" ...|$|E
5000|$|The most {{successful}} version of [...] "I Found Someone" [...] {{was released by}} American singer/actress Cher as the first U.S. and European single from her eighteenth album, Cher and was released on November 19, 1987 by Geffen. The single was also released on VHS containing the concert version of the video. Cher's version was produced by Michael Bolton. Fashion photographer Matthew Rolston's full cover photo featured a slightly overexposed close-up of Cher's face, gazing into the lens <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>pushes</b> back a mane of tight curls before a bright blue background.|$|R
50|$|The Benedicts' {{neighbor}} Doc Lindquist watches Joanna warily one day <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>pushes</b> Tara {{to exhaust}} herself swimming. At a party, he overhears Joanna tell his grandson Scotty (Wallace) {{that she had}} lived in Seattle prior to working for the Benedicts. He points out to Jeff that this story does not match the one that she had told Liz. Doc begins his own quiet investigation into Joanna's background and finds it almost impossible to recreate where she has lived, because of the many foster homes where she had lived {{and the fact that she}} is legally an adult.|$|R
50|$|Jessica survives surgery, but mentally regresses {{herself into}} an alter named Teen Jessica {{in order to}} forget about the rape. This alter is Jessica's {{personality}} from high school. Mitch is soon arrested for the kidnapping, and Schuyler Joplin is later revealed to be Mitch's biological son instead of Rex, making Schuyler Jessica's half-brother. In her mind, Jessica is still 17 and in love with Cristian, who is now dating Layla Williamson. She pursues him with no luck <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>pushes</b> a heartbroken Brody away. Teen Jessica disappears and Jessica's memories return on May 21, 2010 <b>as</b> <b>she</b> is being seduced by Cristian and Layla's womanizing roommate, Robert Ford. She reunites with Brody, not knowing that he and Natalie had slept together the night before as well.|$|R
6000|$|... "Please tell me, if you may. I should so love {{to pay my}} debts {{by being}} of some use;" [...] and Dolly was all attention, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>pushed</b> back her vail as if to get a clear and {{impartial}} view of the case about to be submitted.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said she, [...] "we'll divide it," [...] and she bit in {{two parts}} what remained. In a {{twinkling}} she had gulped down the smallest part, for you know she was very, very hungry. [...] "That is your share," [...] said she, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>pushed</b> what remained over to Reddy.|$|E
60|$|Miss Violet Harby removed Ursula's {{waterproof}} {{from the}} peg {{on which it}} was hung, to one a little farther down the row. She had already snatched the pins from her own stuff hat, and jammed them through her coat. She turned to Ursula, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>pushed</b> up her frizzed, flat, dun-coloured hair.|$|E
60|$|These {{were her}} last words <b>as</b> <b>she</b> was <b>pushed</b> over the bank, and, like her companion, {{forcibly}} held, {{down with a}} halbert. Before she was quite suffocated, however, Winram ordered her to be dragged out, and, when able to speak, she was asked if she would pray for the King.|$|R
5000|$|The Continental {{has both}} a {{telescope}} {{with which to}} [...] "spy" [...] on his female neighbors {{and a collection of}} [...] "erotic" [...] Hummel figurines he acquired on eBay. These sketches are always shot from the woman's point of view, so we never see her face, just her gloved arms <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>pushes</b> him out of her way. Whenever he offers her a glass of champagne or, as he calls it, champagna , she invariably ends up throwing it in his face. The character also has the catchphrase of [...] "Wow! Wowie-wow-wow-wow!" [...] which is usually said at some point when the woman has physically shown she has no interest in him, only for him to become even more aroused by her [...] "tempestuousness".|$|R
50|$|Michonne's backstory is {{slightly}} altered {{in the television}} series, having a three-year-old son named Andre Anthony, while the fate of her boyfriend and friend remain the same. In the television series, Michonne's trauma and guarded nature gradually diminishes <b>as</b> <b>she</b> slowly recovers and finds herself opening up and investing in a {{community as well as}} Rick's core group. Her conflict with The Governor is motivated by his attempt to kill her after leaving the town under suspicion that he is dangerous and trying to protect her friend, Andrea. In addition, her relationship with the Grimes family is explored in more depth <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>pushes</b> her group to strive for a sanctuary in Washington, DC. She also develops a romance with protagonist Rick Grimes, which is implied in the comic, but never developed. In both media, she becomes a constable at the Alexandria Safe-Zone.|$|R
6000|$|... "My own darling!" [...] He stooped, {{and their}} lips {{met for the}} first time. Then, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>pushed</b> open the folding windows she heard his quick, firm step as it passed down the graveled path. A lamp was lit as she entered the room, and there was Ida, dancing about like a mischievous little fairy in front of her.|$|E
60|$|Either the {{distance}} {{was less than}} the hackman fancied, or else he drove thither with unheard-of speed, for two minutes later he set them down on Liverpool Wharf. But swiftly as they had come the steamer had been even more prompt, and she now turned toward them a beautiful wake, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>pushed</b> farther and farther out into the harbor.|$|E
60|$|It was {{a fearful}} {{struggle}} {{in which the}} Deal lugger engaged that night. The sea threatened to bury her altogether <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>pushed</b> off through the breakers, {{and some of the}} men seemed to think it would be too much for them. A man named Davis took the helm; he had saved many a life on that coast in his day.|$|E
6000|$|They {{then saw}} that his face was, indeed, very pale and jaded, and that his dress was muddied from head to foot, and in some places there were marks of blood; but <b>as</b> <b>she</b> almost <b>pushed</b> {{him down on the}} chest beside the bed, he said, in a voice hoarse and sunk, betraying weariness-- ...|$|R
60|$|He {{drew her}} into his arms. She made no resistance. Her lips, even, were seeking his. It seemed to him in those breathless moments that a greater thing than even the destiny of nations was born into the world. There was a new vigour in his pulses <b>as</b> <b>she</b> gently <b>pushed</b> him back, a new splendour in life.|$|R
60|$|Jill {{spoke softly}} lest she should disturb the others, and, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> turned to <b>push</b> up her pillow, she saw Mrs. Minot {{looking at her}} with a smile she did not understand.|$|R
6000|$|Seeing {{that her}} dinner {{was a success}} {{in spite of its}} homeliness, Edith added the last surprise, which had also been one to Patty and herself when it arrived, just in time to be carried out. She forgot to be Madam now, and said with a face full of mingled merriment and satisfaction, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>pushed</b> her cap askew and pulled off her mitts: ...|$|E
60|$|One by one {{the doors}} opened before her touch, only to reveal empty interiors. In her {{absorption}} she did not note the sudden activity upon the vessel, the purring of the engines, the throbbing of the propeller. She had reached the last door upon the right now, and <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>pushed</b> it open she was seized from within by a powerful, dark-visaged man, and drawn hastily into the stuffy, ill-smelling interior.|$|E
6000|$|... "It 's {{the genius}} that {{gets into the}} books, which makes us like the poverty, I fancy. But I don't quite agree that the real thing is n't interesting. I think it would be, if we knew how {{to look at and}} feel it," [...] said Polly, very quietly, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>pushed</b> her chair out of the arctic circle of Miss Perkins, into the {{temperate}} one of friendly Emma.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the host}} nation's cyclists, Fatema Chingby Marma, was disqualified <b>as</b> <b>she</b> was being <b>pushed</b> by an {{enthusiastic}} local motor cycle rider from behind during the cycling event at Khulna - Gopalganj.|$|R
500|$|Running for {{approximately}} 43minutes, the episode {{was written by}} Stacy McKee and directed by Denzel Washington. The episode featured the songs [...] "My Girl", [...] "I Surrender". In October 2015, it was announced by TVLine that two-time Academy Awards winner Washington was to direct the ninth episode of the season, which would be Washington's first time at directing television.

Before {{the release of the}} episode a video was leaked from the set where Washington could be seen passing behind Chandra Wilson, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>pushes</b> Pompeo around in a wheelchair, wearing full arm and leg casts. The video substantiated Washington’s involvement with the show and speculated Meredith’s injuries." ...|$|R
50|$|Her newfound anger towards outer beauty drives her to push Patrice’s {{face into}} {{a pot of}} boiling water, thus {{bringing}} his now beast-like face to her lowly status.

6000|$|Both sat {{silent for}} a few minutes, as their hands moved briskly and they thought of their {{different}} lots. An inquisitive ray of sunshine peeped in at them, touching Becky's hair till it shone like red gold. The same ray dazzled Emily's eyes; she put up her hand to pull her hat-brim lower, and touched the little curls on her forehead. This recalled her pet grievance, and made her say impatiently, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>pushed</b> the thick short locks under her net,-- ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was nearly}} dusk when, with a scream of brakes, the cars lurched into a desolate {{mountain}} station, and Millicent shivered as she alighted in the frost-dried dust of snow. A nipping wind sighed down the valley. The tall firs {{on the hillside}} were fading into phantom battalions of climbing trees, and above them towered a dim chaos of giant peaks, weirdly awe-inspiring under the last faint glimmer of the dying day. A few lights blinked among the lower firs, and Millicent, hurrying towards them at the station agent's direction, was greeted by the odors of coarse tobacco <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>pushed</b> {{open the door of}} the New Eldorado saloon.|$|E
60|$|The Queen {{smiled and}} led her to a doorway. <b>As</b> <b>she</b> <b>pushed</b> aside a heavy drapery a flood of silvery light greeted them, and Betsy saw before her a splendid banquet hall, with a table spread with snowy linen and crystal and silver. At one side was a broad, throne-like seat for Erma and beside her now sat the {{brilliant}} maid Electra. Polychrome {{was placed on the}} Queen's right hand and Betsy upon her left. The other five messengers of light now waited upon them, and each person was supplied with just the food she liked best. Polychrome found her dish of dewdrops, all fresh and sparkling, while Betsy was so lavishly served that she decided she had never in her life eaten a dinner half so good.|$|E

When it gets back to the woman with the heart, she moves her hands away from the heart, now we see N-Dubz together again, then we see the heart shatter in front of the woman sending her forward. The pieces are sent flying everywhere. We see the woman with the rose <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>pushes</b> the rose away and it catches fire. She looks back at the rose and tries to touch it but her hand recoils. Tulisa pushes the man away and walks away from him while he walks in the other direction. He gets out a little box from his pocket and reveals a ring inside it. He takes off his glasses before throwing the ring into silver slime.|$|R
