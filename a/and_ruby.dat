5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the Maine Coon's {{popularity}} {{began to decline}} {{with the introduction of}} other long-haired breeds, such as the Persian, which originated in the Middle East.

The prosecution called 137witnesses, including Michael Fortier and his wife Lori, and McVeigh's sister, Jennifer McVeigh, all of whom testified to confirm McVeigh's hatred of the government and his desire to take militant action against it.
