5|$|Amid loud outcry, Playford {{started a}} Royal Commission {{to review the}} case. However, two of the Commissioners appointed, Chief Justice Mellis Napier and Justice Geoffrey Reed, had already been involved, Napier as {{presiding}} judge in the Full Court appeal and Reed as the trial judge. This provoked worldwide controversy with claims of bias {{from the likes of}} the President of the Indian Bar Council, the esteemed British judge Norman Birkett, the leader of the United Kingdom Liberal Party Jo Grimond and former British Prime Minister Clement Attlee. Years later, Playford admitted that he erred in his appointments of Reed and Napier <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> have shaken public confidence on the fairness of the hearing.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, John Foster {{suggested}} that the differences usually cited to differentiate Amphicoelias altus from the more well known Diplodocus are not significant and {{may be due to}} individual variation. Foster argued that Amphicoelias is probably the senior synonym of Diplodocus, and that if further research bears this out, the familiar name Diplodocus would need to be abandoned in favor of Amphicoelias, {{as was the case with}} Brontosaurus and its senior synonym Apatosaurus. In 2015, Woodruff and Foster reiterated this conclusion, stating that there is only one species of Amphicoelias <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be referred to Diplodocus as Diplodocus altus. They considered the name Amphicoelias to be a nomen oblitum. It has also been hypothesized that Amphicoelias should be considered an apatosaurine, and therefore should be placed in the subfamily Apatosaurinae.|$|E
5|$|On 8 November 1917, No. 2 Wireless School {{was formed}} at Penshurst. It {{operated}} {{a variety of}} aircraft, including Airco DH.6, Avro 504K, Avro 504N, Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2c and B.E.2e, Sopwith Camel and Sopwith Snipe. Aircrew attended the school for a one-week-long course in wireless telephony procedures. The school was disbanded on 23 March 1919. Knotley Hall was offered for sale in May 1919. In September 1919, {{it was announced that}} Penshurst had been disposed of by the Royal Air Force, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be considered as an emergency landing ground for civil aircraft.|$|E
5|$|While earlier {{findings}} {{suggested that}} the Milky Way galaxy contained more dark matter than Andromeda, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be {{the largest in the}} Local Group - the 2006 observations by the Spitzer Space Telescope led to the revelation that the Andromeda galaxy contains one trillion stars; at least twice the amount of the Milky Way’s stars, with the figure being estimated at 200-400 billion. It is also now evident that spanning approximately 220,000 light years across, Andromeda is the largest galaxy in our Local Group, which is also home to the Triangulum Galaxy and other minor galaxies. The mass of the Andromeda Galaxy is estimated to be 1.5 solar masses, whereas the Milky Way's mass is estimated to be 8.5 solar masses.|$|E

5|$|The Commonwealth of Australia {{was founded}} on 1 January 1901. On 1 March, 29,010 colonial soldiers, {{consisting}} of 1,544 professional soldiers, 16,105 paid militia and 11,361 unpaid volunteers, were transferred to the new Australian Army. However, the units continued to be administered under the various colonial Acts. Major General Sir Edward Hutton, a former commander of the New South Wales Military Forces, was appointed as the first commander of the Commonwealth Forces, assuming command in early 1902 with Army Headquarters subsequently formed at Victoria Barracks in Melbourne. The Defence Act 1903 brought all of the state units under one piece of legislation; although more significantly, it prevented the raising of standing infantry units, only allowing the establishment of permanent administrative and instructional staff for headquarters, garrison artillery, fortress engineers, submarine mining engineers, and service, medical and ordnance units. It also stipulated that the force could only be maintained by voluntary enlistment <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> not serve outside Australia. In this it effectively established the pre-eminence of the Citizen Forces, ensuring that the Australian Army would primarily consist of part-time militia and volunteer forces, which would be supported by a small permanent force limited to filling staff, training and garrison roles. It equally ensured that any force sent overseas could only be done so on a voluntary basis.|$|E

25|$|John Wesley, {{the founder}} of the Methodist movement, taught that there were two {{distinct}} phases in the Christian experience.
