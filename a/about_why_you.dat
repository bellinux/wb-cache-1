This trend is a curious, latter-day parallel to the very different cultural shift Max Weber describes in The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism 2 (1958). The current cultural shift differs in the object of its ideas (love and not work), in the social sphere it most affects (the family and not the economy) and in the population most immediately influenced (women, not men). The cultural shift reflected in advice books concerns a more marginal ideology, feminism, and the commercial transmutation of it is a shift that is smaller, I hope, in scale. Like the earlier trend, this one represents the outcome of an ongoing cultural struggle, gives rise to countertrends, and is uneven in its effect. But the parallel is there...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} {{good reasons to}} keep data and here are three of the best [...] . 1) Re-use 2) Re-purposing 3) Citation. This {{presentation}} is all <b>about</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> {{were asked to provide}} CCMVal data to the BADC in CF complient NetCDF and how this self-describing standard enables the BADC to fulfill it's role as custodian of the CCMVal data archive. RE-USE Providing data in CF complient NetCDF allows your data to be shared with other scientist now and in the future. Right now the CF NetCDF common fomat is facilitating the quick verification of data from different CCMVal models with the use of standard diagnositic tools. Twenty years from now the data will still be understood because it uses the self describing CF NetCDF standard. RE-PURPOSING Using CF standard names to describe the CCMVal variables will enable scientists from other diciplines {{to make use of the}} CCMVal data when it is eventually made available to them. The CF standard names facilitate data discovery through vocabulary servers which allow users to find data without needing to know the exact names of variables. Such value added services satisfy the increasing expactation from funders that science data can be used by different research communities. CITATION CCMVal data is an ideal candidate for publication in the new data journals because it used the CF NetCDF standard. Once the CCMVal data has been verified and moved to the archive at the BADC our data scientists can help with the process of publishing the data so that your data can be cited. ...|$|E

My questions are: (1) Do principals feel that students' views are heard in school? (2) To what extent do the principals feel that students get to be involved and have student influence and {{how important is it}} for the school? (3) Do principals feel that students may be involved in decision-making? United Nations (UN) drew up a Convention on the Rights of the Child, 1989. A convention is rules that many countries have developed and {{come to the conclusion that}} they must follow. In the book Var – dags - inflytande written by the Ministry of Education it is a discussion about if the children learn at an early age about human rights, gender equality, equal worth and how a democratic society works, this will benefit society in the long run. I have used qualitative methods to gather data and I did three interviews with principals. I also interviewed a employed at barn – och utbildningsförvaltningen.

All informants said that they know what the Convention on the Rights of the Childs (CRC) is but they don’t know everything about it.

However, when I posed the question of they believed that CRC was applied enough in school in general in Sweden later in the interview they were doubtful.

40|$|Enterprise Architectures (EA) {{are used}} to {{describe}} an enterprise’s structure in a standardized way. An Enterprise Architecture also provides decision-support when choosing a direction or making changes {{at different levels of}} an enterprise, such as the business architecture or technology architecture level. This can involve decisions such as: What kind of enterprise should this be, what kind of technologies should be used for new system developments etcetera. Therefore, using the Unified Modelling Language (UML) or Systems Modelling Language (SysML) together with standardized guidelines that help you decide what to do before, during, and after modelling could be important for producing correct and useful system models, which later on will be used to develop actual systems. At the moment, standardized guidelines of this kind do not really exist. However, {{there are a lot of}} information <b>about</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> should use UML or SysML, what kinds of UML or SysML diagrams that exist, or what notations to follow when creating a specific UML or SysML diagram. In this thesis, the objective has been to research about the usefulness and creation of standardized guidelines for UML or SysML modelling in an Enterprise Architecture (i. e. mainly intended for the automotive industry domain). For this reason, the two research questions: “how can you create useful standardized guidelines for UML or SysML modelling?” and “what do useful standardized guidelines for UML or SysML modelling look like?” were chosen. A case study was performed on a real-life project at the company Volvo Construction Equipment, which resulted in the two research questions being answered. Firstly, a three-step method (i. e. create guidelines – test guidelines – improve guidelines) was proven to create useful standardized guidelines. Secondly, useful standardized guidelines were created from this three-step method. Hopefully, these created standardized guidelines can be used by the targeted companies right away to make their modelling work more efficient, or serve as a foundation when creating their own standardized guidelines later on...|$|E
40|$|Professional {{accountants}} are {{an integral}} part of business management, and they are increasingly being called upon to take a more active role in ensuring that SMEs are sustainable. This study will assist accountants in this challenge. The main objectives of this study were to examine: firstly, how the management of practices and capabilities of environmental sustainability are developed, maintained and managed in SME ‘environmental sustainability leaders’, with the view to develop a conceptual framework for environmental sustainability (ES) change management in Australian SMEs. These ‘star’ SMEs or ‘sustainability leaders’ have distinguished themselves as recognised leaders in implementing environmental sustainability initiatives. Secondly this study examined what learning in particular is involved in developing environmental change practices and capabilities; thirdly, how this learning might be fostered by other leaders and professional accountants in SMEs. Semi-structured interviews have been conducted with CEOs/MDs and other management staff involved in the management of sustainability in twelve Queensland SME sustainability leaders. By conducting a content analysis, emerging codes, themes and comparative development of key logics were analysed in order to develop an initial conceptual best practice framework which can be used for driving ES initiatives in SMEs. In relation to the first research objective, four stages of managing environmental sustainability (ES) change have been distinguished in this report including: the design for ES; internalising ES in the culture of the organisation; implementation; and becoming a leader in ES. Several components associated with each of these stages have been identified in the course of this research. The design stage comprises four main activities, including setting the foundations of success, developing the business case for ES; establishing a strategic orientation to environmental sustainability; and utilising strategic change capabilities. The internalisation stage comprises two components: utilising strategic change capabilities and developing an ES Culture through creating conditions that motivate desired ES behaviour. The implementation stage consists of three main components: the implementation of ES change initiatives; the identification of barriers and overcoming these barriers; and integrating external support for ES initiatives. The main focus of the final stage is on becoming a leader in ES. Two main components are associated with this stage, including: the achievement of economic, social (human resource and community) and environmental sustainability outcomes; and becoming known as a renowned ES leader. The activities associated with the various components are discussed in detail in this report, culminating in a best practice framework for managing environmental sustainability titled: the ‘Leaders in Managing Environmental Sustainability’ framework. SME environmental sustainability leaders offered the following advice to SMEs and accountants in SMEs: understand your business and be clear <b>about</b> <b>why</b> <b>you</b> are doing it; be strategic about it and build it in your business model; take manageable steps; make it about the triple bottom line—people, profitability and the environment; find a way to work ‘on’ your business; engage a sustainability leader; make it simple, start small and do it; target the big areas first and work your way down; engage people and make them part of the change; make ES part of the culture and belief system of the organisation; start with process improvement and understand the processes; focus and do it well; pursue support from government agencies; learn from your mistakes and from others; find relevant information; participate in ecoBiz initiatives; and continue and revisit environmental sustainability progress ever so often. Since the framework in our study has been developed as a situational analysis of existing SME environmental sustainability leaders, accountants could benefit from drawing on the experiences and successes of these firms in further achieving the goals of developing mechanisms to access and engage with senior executives; and developing a ‘borderless mind’ through ‘thinking out of the box’. The results and associated best practice framework in this report has the potential to assist accountants with implementing innovative approaches to managing environmental sustainability. This report supports the notion that ‘sustainability is the future’ and provides accountants with useful guidelines in fulfilling the critical role of managing environmental assets. ...|$|E
