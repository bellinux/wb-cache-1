The following steep increase in real-estate values of formerly depressed areas like Mamilla near the former armistice {{line and the}} Old City was perceived by evicted Mizrahi Jews as <b>an</b> <b>injustice.</b> This became a key issue in 1970s Israeli social upheaval and {{the founding of the}} Black Panthers movement in Israel.|$|E

5|$|Jean-Baptiste Morain, {{writing in}} Les Inrockuptibles, noticed how the strong {{do not accept}} their own {{weakness}} and have no qualms about perpetuating <b>an</b> <b>injustice</b> to defend their interests. This wider political sense is, he argued, accentuated by its English setting, where class differences are more marked than in the USA. The film pits passion and the dream of happiness against ambition and arrivisme, resolving the dispute with a pitiless blow that disallows all chance of justice.|$|E
5|$|Cochrane's work forms {{part of the}} {{political}} turn in animal ethics—that is, the emergence of academic literature exploring the normative aspects of human/nonhuman animal relationships from a political perspective. He is known for his interest-based account of animal rights, a theory of justice according to which animals have rights based on their possession of normatively-significant interests. The account is a two-tiered one, with individuals' strong interests grounding prima facie rights, and some prima facie rights becoming concrete, or all-things-considered, rights. In this picture, the violation of concrete rights, but not necessarily prima facie rights, represents <b>an</b> <b>injustice.</b> In particular, Cochrane argues that sentient animals' interests against suffering and death ground prima facie rights against the infliction of suffering and death. These prima facie rights convert to concrete rights in, for example, animal agriculture and animal testing, meaning that killing nonhuman animals or making them suffer for these purposes is unjust.|$|E

5|$|The lower magistrates {{included}} the tribune of the plebs, {{who was elected}} by the Plebeian Council, and the aediles and quaestors, elected by the Tribal Assembly. The tribune was sacrosanct, i.e. declared inviolable, with summary execution for violators of his sanctity. It was on this basis that the tribune could veto any political act or to protect any individual from <b>an</b> <b>injustice</b> committed by a magistrate, known as intercessio and auxilium, respectively. This power was used increasingly to block public business in the later republic, and was only limited in that a tribune could not oppose {{the will of the}} people as a whole.|$|E
5|$|Writing for American Humor, {{academic}} Robert G. Pielke {{observed that}} the sketch was a very well-done, and moving, reflection on NBC management's fealty to Nielsen ratings and profit. Pielke went on to analyze the sketch and characterized it {{as an example of}} Saturday Night Live resisting conformist authority. He commented that <b>an</b> <b>injustice</b> had been wrought by NBC the company, whereas the NBC executives who came to shut down Star Trek were simply pawns in the process. He posited that the U.S.S. Enterprise crew members were against cancelling the television program because their self-worth had become tied to it. Pielke noted that {{within the confines of the}} sketch's plot itself, as each crew member realized there was no option other than cancellation, they each showed their actual identity and humanity.|$|E

40|$|Background: A growing {{field of}} {{investigation}} into social justice cognitions and pain suggests perceived <b>injustice</b> has <b>a</b> {{negative impact on}} pain, but {{little is known about}} individual variation in the impact of <b>a</b> perceived <b>injustice.</b> One published study found that individuals with a strong rather than a weak just-world belief reported greater pain from the cold pressor task after experiencing <b>a</b> perceived <b>injustice,</b> but <b>an</b> overt measure of perceived unfairness is needed to investigate this relationship. Methods: Following the completion of just-world belief and state anxiety scales and the cold pressor task, 114 healthy participants were interviewed about either <b>an</b> experienced <b>injustice</b> or the characteristics of their home, before repeating the cold pressor task. Pain and anxiety measures were completed following each cold pressor task. Results: Opposing the hypotheses, no differences were found on pain and anxiety between the two interview conditions and individuals with a strong just-world belief did not report higher pain and anxiety levels following <b>a</b> recalled <b>injustice.</b> However, within the recalled injustice condition, unfairness ratings were associated with significantly increased pain and anxiety. Conclusions: Recalled personal injustice unrelated to one’s current pain experience had a negative impact on pain and anxiety associated with the cold pressor task. These findings indicate that intervention development should be cognisant of the role of everyday injustices and not just those related to pain, on the pain experience...|$|R

Socrates says to the court that these old accusations arise from years of gossip and prejudice against him; hence, are matters difficult to address. He then embarrasses the accusing Orators, by reformulating their diffuse accusations against him into proper, legal form, that: “Socrates is committing <b>an</b> <b>injustice,</b> in that he inquires into things below the earth and in the sky; and makes the weaker argument the stronger; and teaches others to follow his example” (19b-c).|$|E
