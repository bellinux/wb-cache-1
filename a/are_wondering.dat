2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1950, the Michigan Chronicle, an African-American {{newspaper}} in Detroit, also questioned the treatment of Mann. [...] Bill Matney wrote in the Chronicle:"Has a 'freeze' been put on Bob Mann? Mann was expected to have his best year in 1950. He played {{a total of three}} minutes in four exhibition games. Officially, Mann has been told by the New York Yanks that he is 'too small to make the team.' Consider the following - the previous year he was considered one of the best receivers in the league. Rival coaches were comparing him to the great Don Hutson in pass catching ability, and shiftiness. Still, after a great year, he was asked to take a pay cut from $8,000 to $6,500. However, after his release, not one NFL team has indicated any interest in picking him up...Many fans believe Mann to be the victim of a 'league fix,' a situation which may be created by team owners which spells 'finis' to the grid career of the player in question...They [...] are still wondering why such a superior player as Mann in 1949, would not be wanted by any team in the NFL just nine months later. Fans <b>are</b> <b>wondering</b> if outside forces or a situation in which he became innocently involved, have created a 'boycott' which has driven Mann right out of the league." ...|$|E
