40|$|Atherosclerosis is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} disease char-acterized by {{the accumulation of}} lipids and fibrous el-ements in large arteries. 1 – 3 This complex disease involves interactions of modified lipoproteins, monocyte-derived macrophages or foam cells, T lymphocytes, endothelial cells (ECs), vascular smooth muscle cells (VSCMs), and fibro-blasts. Monocytes and macrophages lead to the inflammatory pathology of atherosclerosis, whereas changes in <b>athermanous</b> plaque thickness and matrix composition are attributed to VSMCs. VSMCs are responsible for promoting plaque stabil-ity in advanced lesions. In this regard, studies from Bennett laboratory have elegantly demonstrated that VSMC apoptosis alone is sufficient to induce multiple features of atheroscle-rotic plaque vulnerability. 4 Interestingly, in vitro {{studies have indicated that}} VSMCs isolated from atheromas in humans and mice have downregulated the activity of the Akt signaling pathway and are more prone to apoptosis. 4, 5 The serine/threonine kinase Akt (also known as protein kinase B) is a multifunctional kinase implicated in the regula-tion of cellular growth, survival, and metabolism. 6, 7 Akt {{is at the center of}} a complex signaling network regulating multiple cellular functions, suggesting a possibility that Akt signaling pathways may be involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclero...|$|E

40|$|Currently, {{angiography}} {{is still}} {{considered to be the}} gold standard for the diagnosis of a renal artery stenosis (RAS). However, angiography is invasive and carries the potential risk of haematoma, pseudoaneurysm, contrast agent induced nephropathy, and <b>athermanous</b> embolization. Color-coded duplex ultrasound is a noninvasive frequently repeatable bed-side examination and is currently the only diagnostic method to reliably differentiate between a hemodynamically relevant or irrelevant stenosis using the side-to-side difference of the intrarenal resistance index (RI). There is a highly specific correlation between a side difference of the RI of > 0. 05 and an at least 70 % angiographic diameter stenosis. All other duplex parameters like a peak systolic flow velocity > 200 cm/sec or a renal aortic flow velocity ratio > 3. 5 are correlated to a 50 or 60 % angiographic diameter stenosis and offer therefore indeed a high sensitivity in terms of detecting a RAS; however, the specificity detecting a hemodynamically relevant RAS is low. Provided that duplex ultrasound is performed by an experienced physician with an adequate machine it should be the preferred imaging method. The present article gives an overview about the literature related to duplex based diagnosis of RAS and as a follow-up diagnostic procedure following RAS revascularization...|$|E

Methods: The present study comprised 40 randomly selected healthy male hospital staff without {{a history of}} hy-pertension or cardiac or pulmonary disease. Participants {{were divided into two}} groups. The first group included 20 professional smokers (at least 5 pack/year till the time of study) and the second group consisted of 20 non-professional smokers defined as 0. 5 pack / year or less till the time of study. Participants were instructed not to smoke for 6 hours before the study. Patients underwent echocardiography before smoking. The participants were then asked to smoke a whole cigarette. After smoking, echocardiography was repeated within 7 to 15 minutes. Echocardiographic indices of diastolic function (E wave, A wave, Ea, E/A ratio and deceleration time) were measured before and after smoking. Results: There was no statistically significant difference in the baseline measures in both groups before smoking and also {{there was no significant difference}} between measures in the two groups after smoking. The analysis of the pooled data from two groups showed that, smoking resulted in significant increase of heart rate (P< 0. 001).

40|$|Tests {{have shown}} that adipose tissue is very {{important}} in the production of chemical substances that {{have a major impact on}} atherosclerosis. The basic fat cells adiposity is very active in bio secretion hormones and other substances. Adiposities secrete chemical substances such as leptin, resistin, adiponectin, and others who participate in metabolic processes. One of the most important adipocytokine affecting the formation and the regression of atheromas plaque in the coronary blood vessels are adiponectin and resistin. So our aim was to determine the value of the concentration of adiponectin and resistin on patient with myocardial heart attack and determine their correlation with the control group of healthy subjects. In this study were included 68 subjects, 40 with myocardial heart attacks and 28 control groups of normal healthy. In the group with myocardial 78. 6 % of respondents were male and 21. 4 % female. Tests {{have shown that}} the concentration of adiponectin in the group with myocardial heart attack was significantly lower than the control group (4. 94 to 6. 74, p= 0. 043, p 0. 05). All this indicates that in patients with myocardial heart attack there is a decline in the concentration of adiponectin, which has cardio protective effect. The increase in resistin in myocardial heart attack in directly related to the appearance of <b>athermanous</b> plaques in the coronary blood vessels and has a bad prognostic significance...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a measurement of temperature in a steelmaking furnace with an oxygen refining process, specifically in a tandem furnace. Knowledge of {{the temperature is}} important for optimizing the manufacturing process and extending {{of the life cycle}} of the inner furnace lining. Conditions in the furnace are very demanding; the temperature may temporarily exceed 2000 °C and exhibits changes of 60 °C s− 1. The atmosphere in the furnace is mainly oxidizing and its chemical composition is very variable. In the atmosphere there are also present liquid and solid compounds which act chemically and abrasively on the lining and on the sensor. These conditions make it impossible to use a suction pyrometer, contactless optical or acoustic measurement methods. It was decided to use a thermocouple in a protective tube. The sensor was inserted into the furnace through a steel bushing with water cooling. For the first measurement the type B thermocouple in Al 2 O 3 protective tube inside an outer shielding tube made from SiC was used. The second sensor used the type C thermocouple in a special thick-walled protective tube made from sintered SiC. The sensor does not measure the temperature of the gas itself, since it is affected by radiation of the surrounding areas. Conditions for heat transport from the furnace to the sensor are variable and difficult to determine; therefore, the accurate identification of the atmosphere temperature is not possible. Limit values of the temperature interval of the atmosphere were determined, for hypothetical cases of <b>athermanous</b> and ideally diathermic atmospheres. Web of Science 751039...|$|E

Experiments {{were designed to}} test whether or not Rap 1 is present in atheromatous lesions and affects NF-κB dependent inflammation in macrophages, the predominant cell type involved in the progression of atherosclerotic lesions. METHODS: The expression of Rap 1 and macrophages in human atheromatous lesions was detected by immunohistochemistry. The expression of lipopolysaccharide- (LPS, 50 ng/mL, 4 h) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α, 100 ng/mL, 4 h) induced NF-κB dependent genes and proteins in wild type and Rap 1 knockdown THP- 1 cells were measured using real-time PCR and enzyme-linked immune sorbent assays. Western blotting was applied to determine the expression of p 65 and its phosphorylation in wild type and Rap 1 knockdown THP- 1 cells. RESULTS: Rap 1 co-localized with macrophages and its staining positively correlated with graded human atherosclerosis. In THP- 1 cells, Rap 1 knockdown suppressed the phosphorylation of p 65 and reduced the expression of LPS- or TNFα-induced NF-κB dependent pro-inflammatory cytokines at mRNA and protein levels. CONCLUSION: Telomere-independent Rap 1 is present in human <b>athermanous</b> lesions. Cytoplasmic Rap 1 within macrophages may impact on inflammation during atherosclerosis. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Background: Morbidity {{related to}} {{vascular}} access {{is the leading}} cause of hospitalization for chronic hemodialysis patients and is associated with high cost. Since data on vascular access complications are scarce, this study was designed to focus on vascular access complications in hemodialysis patients. Methods: 119 patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) on regular hemodialysis were recruited for the study, They were subjected to the following Laboratory blood tests: Kidney function tests, CBC, KT/V, serum albumin, fasting blood sugar, swab culture and sensitivity from the skin over the vascular access and blood culture and sensitivity from both central and peripheral samples, In addition, radiological Doppler ultrasound was done for all patients to evaluate the vascular access. Results: 27 out of 119 patients (22 %) have positive blood culture, 64 (53. 7 %) patients have positive swab culture, 68 (57 %) patients have stenosis, 25 patients (21 %) have <b>athermanous</b> plaques and 44 (36. 9 %) patients have aneurysmal dilatation. There was a significant low Kt/V in patients with stenosis and aneurysmal dilatation (p <  0. 001). Low Kt/V, low serum albumin level and low BMI were significant in patients with central blood infection (p <  0. 008, < 0. 008 and < 0. 001 respectively). There was significant increase in the risk of infection in male patients, patients with low BMI, increased BUN and increased duration of HD session (p <  0. 046, < 0. 008, < 0. 002 and < 0. 009 respectively). Stenosis was the most common risk factor for vascular failure as it occurred in (29 %) of patients. Diabetes was the second common risk factor for vascular failure as it occurred in (17 %) of patients. Conclusion: Stenosis and infection are the most common complications of the vascular access. DM is an important risk factor for the incidence of infection. Other risk factors for dialysis CRBSI include older age, low serum albumin, high BUN and decreasing the duration of dialysis...|$|E
40|$|Dissertação (mestrado) - Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Centro Tecnológico. Programa de Pós-Graduação em Engenharia Química. O poliestireno expansível (EPS), mais conhecido pela marca {{comercial}} ISOPOR, é um material que possui inúmeras aplicações dentre as quais destaca-se o isolamento térmico em câmaras frigoríficas, paredes duplas, acondicionamento de materiais sensíveis, entre outras. Isto deve-se a sua capacidade de isolante térmico, já que à estrutura do EPS é muito porosa (2 % de poliestireno e 98 % de ar) e mantém, permanentemente uma grande quantidade de ar, quase imóvel, dentro da sua estrutura. Esta propriedade de isolante do EPS pode ser melhorada pela incorporação de materiais atérmanos, tais como o grafite. Industrialmente, o EPS é produzido via polimerização em suspensão. Vários aspectos deste processo ainda precisam ser melhor compreendidos, entre eles destaca-se a influência da evolução da conversão sobre a distribuição final de tamanho das partículas (DTP). Para tentar esclarecer este aspecto, empregou-se neste trabalho a espectroscopia Raman no monitoramento em linha de reações de polimerização do estireno em suspensão. Foi observado que o Raman consegue captar a evolução da conversão e que o seu o espectro é afetado pela DTP. Este trabalho também apresenta um estudo sobre a influência do grafite na polimerização em suspensão do estireno em relação a distribuição de tamanho das partículas final e a evolução da conversão ao longo da reação. Os resultados mostraram que o aumento da concentração de grafite diminui a taxa de reação e afeta a DTP final. The expandable styrene polymers (EPS), usually {{known by}} its commercial mark ISOPOR, is a material that possesses innumerable applications amongst which stands out the thermal isolation in refrigerating chambers, double walls, preservation of sensible materials, among others. This is due to its thermal insulator capacity, as the EPS structure is very porous (2 % of polystyrene and 98 % of air) and it maintains, permanently {{a great amount of}} air, almost immobile, inside its structure. This EPS insulating property can be improved by the incorporation of <b>athermanous</b> material, such as the graphite. Industrially, EPS is produced via suspension polymerization. Several aspects of this process still need to be understood better, among them stands out the influence of the evolution of the conversion on the final particle size distribution (PSD). In order to try to clarify this aspect, the Raman spectroscopy was used in this work to monitor the in-line reactions of styrene suspension polymerization. It was observed that Raman is able to capture the evolution of the conversion and that its spectrum is affected by PSD. This work also presents a study on the graphite influence over styrene suspension polymerization in relation to the final particle size distribution and the evolution of the conversion along the reaction. The results had shown that the increase of the graphite concentration diminishes the reaction tax and affects the final PSD...|$|E
