5|$|As intended, {{it would}} have functioned as a stealth helicopter, {{incorporating}} {{a number of different}} techniques and technologies in order to reduce its radar cross-section (RCS) along with other areas of visibility and detectability. The exterior surfaces of the RAH-66 were faceted and covered with both radar-absorbent material (RAM) coatings and infrared-suppressant paint; {{as a result of these}} combined measures, the Comanche's RCS was claimed to have been 360 times smaller than that of the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter. The acoustic signature of the rotorcraft was also reported to be noticeably lower than comparative helicopters; this reduction had been partially achieved through the adoption of an <b>all-composite</b> five-blade main rotor and pioneering canted tail rotor assembly.|$|E
25|$|Sikorsky S-75 : The Advanced Composite Airframe Program (ACAP) was an <b>all-{{composite}}</b> Sikorsky early LHX {{proof of}} concept aircraft. Designated S-75, it mated a new composite airframe with S-76 engines, rotors and powertrain components.|$|E
25|$|The Scaled Composites Model 81 Catbird is a high-efficiency five-seat {{single-engine}} <b>all-composite</b> {{general aviation}} aircraft designed by Burt Rutan. It {{is unusual in}} that it incorporates both a small forward wing and a small conventional horizontal stabilizer on the tail.|$|E

25|$|Bell Helicopter {{proposed}} an update of the OH-58D concept in a militarized {{version of the}} Bell 407, using a more powerful Honeywell HTS900 turboshaft engine, an <b>all-composite</b> main rotor based on the Bell 430's rotor, and the Bell 427 tail assembly.|$|E
25|$|In {{support of}} the LHX program the United States Army started the Advanced Composite Airframe Program (ACAP) to develop an <b>all-composite</b> {{helicopter}} fuselage. In February 1981 contracts were awarded to Sikorsky (for the Sikorsky S-75) and Bell Helicopter (for the Bell D-292).|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s Grob {{also decided to}} build the G 109, the world's first {{production}} <b>all-composite</b> motor glider which was certified in 1981. This was following by the G 115 which was certified by the FAA in 1987. In the late 1980s the G 520 Egrett/STRATO 1 high-altitude aircraft was produced which established five world records. Glider production ceased in 1996 and production concentrated on powered aircraft.|$|E
50|$|The Fascination was marketed by WD Flugzeugleichtbau of Germany as the Dallach D.4 Fascination. This was an {{aircraft}} of mixed construction, including wood, composites and steel components with fabric covering. It first flew in 1996. An <b>all-composites</b> version, the Dallach D.4 BK Fascination was flown in 1999. UL-Jih fabricated these models and claimed sole production and marketing rights {{both to the}} D.4 and D.5 when WD Flugzeugliechtbau ceased trading in 2005, though those rights are challenged by Swiss Light Aircraft AG, who build their own versions.|$|R
25|$|The Tiger has the {{distinction}} of being the first <b>all-composite</b> helicopter developed in Europe; even the earliest models also incorporate other advanced features such as a glass cockpit, stealth technology, and high agility to increase its survivability. Improved variants have since entered service, outfitted with more powerful engines and compatible with a wider range of weapons. Since the type's introduction to service, Tigers have been used in combat in Afghanistan, Libya, and Mali.|$|E
25|$|The Mississippi State University XV-11A Marvel was an {{experimental}} American STOL research aircraft of the 1960s. The MARVEL (Mississippi Aerophysics Research Vehicle with Extended Latitude) was a single-engined pusher monoplane {{fitted with a}} boundary layer control system. The first <b>all-composite</b> aircraft, it carried out its initial program of research {{on behalf of the}} US Army in the late 1960s, and was rebuilt in the 1980s as a proof-of-concept for a utility aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The Tiger is {{the first}} <b>all-composite</b> {{helicopter}} developed in Europe. The fuselage of the Tiger is made from 80% carbon fibre reinforced polymer and kevlar, 11% aluminium, and 6% titanium. The entire tail section is made of composites, including the single section tail boom. The rotors are composed of a fibre plastic composite material able to withstand combat damage and bird strikes. The structure of the Tiger also incorporates protection against lightning strikes and electromagnetic pulses via an embedded copper/bronze grid and copper bonding foil.|$|E
25|$|Hoffmann Flugzeugbau quickly {{set about}} the {{development}} of a suitable aircraft to launch its product range with. Accordingly, during the early 1980s, the company launched production of a two-seat <b>all-composite</b> motor glider, initially known as the H36 Dimona. The H36 demonstrated the company's ambition to raise both the quality and performance of such aircraft while making them available at competitive prices. The type was relatively successful, becoming the biggest-selling motor glider in Europe and, by 2004, four separate versions of the Dimona - which were marketed as the HK36 Super Dimona or Xtreme - were available for purchase.|$|E
25|$|The Katana {{has several}} {{distinctive}} features, including its <b>all-composite</b> construction, low-mounted wing, T-tail arrangement, and a castering nosewheel. All models {{make use of}} a composite airframe which is constructed of glass- and carbon-fiber reinforced plastic. The one-piece fuselage has removable wings, which assists with transportation and servicing activities. The wings themselves have transparent plexiglas panels present so that key control elements can be readily inspected without disassembly. The airframe is complete with a sleek finish across the entirety of its exterior, which serves to eliminate corrosion and rivets in order to lower maintenance requirements. The maintenance costs of the Katana have been considered to be relatively low.|$|E
25|$|The Klapmeier brothers, Alan Lee Klapmeier (born October 6, 1958) and Dale Edward Klapmeier (born July 2, 1961), are American {{aircraft}} designers, aviation businessmen, {{and entrepreneurs}} who together founded the Cirrus Aircraft Corporation in 1984. Under {{the leadership of}} the Klapmeiers, Cirrus was the first aircraft manufacturer to install a whole-plane parachute recovery system as a standard on all its models—designed to lower the airplane (and occupants) safely to the ground in case of an emergency. The device is attributed with saving over 140 lives to date. Cirrus was also the first to use <b>all-composite</b> airframe construction and glass panel cockpits on production aircraft, which many say revolutionized general aviation for light aircraft pilots.|$|E
25|$|It was an <b>all-composite</b> {{construction}} aircraft, {{based on}} the commercial single-engine, low-wing Windecker Eagle. The YE-5A, delivered in 1973, was used in tests relating to the radar detectability (commonly known as 'stealth') of composite aircraft. A single YE-5A (serial number 73-1653) was built. The YE-5A composite airframe benefited from the U.S. Army project and was shown {{to be difficult to}} detect using radar; however other components, including the metal engine, could be seen on radar. The YE-5A was destroyed in a crash during a classified project in 1985, and was replaced by a modified conventional civilian model Windecker Eagle (N4196G), to complete the project. This aircraft is disassembled and in storage in the United States Army Aviation Museum at Fort Rucker, Alabama.|$|E
25|$|At the 2010 EAA Oshkosh Airshow, Alan {{introduced}} his new venture, the Kestrel Aircraft Company, and {{would serve as}} its CEO. Kestrel is to produce the Kestrel K-350, a single turboprop-engined <b>all-composite</b> six-seat aircraft. Some of his ex-Cirrus colleagues join him in the project, including Steve Serfling, Cirrus' former Director of Product Development. The company was originally set to locate its headquarters in Brunswick, Maine, but after complications with state tax credits, Alan decided in 2012 to move manufacturing operations to Wisconsin where they received a better financial package; {{the total value of}} loans, grants and tax credits was $118 million, $112 million from the state. Kestrel is now based in Superior, Wisconsin, right across the border from Cirrus, and employs about 60 workers. A smaller workforce resides in Brunswick creating composite components for the plane.|$|E
25|$|The Airbus Helicopters H160 takes {{advantage}} of several advanced manufacturing technologies and materials {{in order to produce}} a lighter, more efficient design. One weight-saving measure was the replacement of conventional hydraulic landing gear and brakes with electrical counterparts, the first helicopter in the world to do so; according to Airbus the elimination of hydraulic components makes the rotorcraft both lighter and safer. In 2015, Airbus claimed that the <b>all-composite</b> H160 would deliver the same basic performance as the rival AgustaWestland AW139 while being a ton lighter, having a lower fuel consumption and offering 15–20% lower direct operating costs. The composite fuselage also provided for greater design freedom of the rotorcraft's external styling. During the aircraft's development, features such as full de-icing equipment and a fly-by-wire control system, were deemed too heavy or costly for the benefits involved and were eliminated.|$|E

2500|$|The {{resultant}} {{design was}} a shoulder-winged monoplane {{powered by a}} single Allison T63 turboprop engine driving a pusher ducted propeller. The aircraft's structure was made completely of fiberglass, making the Marvel the first example of an <b>all-composite</b> aircraft. The boundary layer control system used a blower driven by the engine to draw suction through {{more than one million}} tiny holes in the wings and fuselage, while instead of conventional flaps the Marvel used a form of wing warping to deflect the wing trailing edges to vary the wing's camber. The aircraft's tail surfaces were attached to the duct around the propeller, extending behind the duct. The undercarriage, of the so-called [...] "Pantobase" [...] configuration, with tandem wheels fitted within two sprung wooden pontoons, was meant to allow operation from rough surfaces, or even from water. [...] It was constructed mainly of fiberglass, with steel used for reinforcement and as heat shields around the engine.|$|E
2500|$|Through the Klapmeiers' vision, the SR20 {{became the}} first of many {{aviation}} advancements within production aircraft, including glass computer-monitored flight-displays instead of round analog dials (which would boast flat-panel avionic utilities such as satellite weather, traffic awareness and GPS steering), side-yoke flight controls instead of traditional yoke or stick consoles, <b>all-composite</b> construction instead of aluminum, and, most popularly known, the Cirrus Airframe Parachute System (CAPS). The Cirrus team spent several weeks during the summer of 1997 in the high desert of southern California testing the parachute. They would drop barrels of sand out a C-123 Cargo plane and flip a switch that would deploy the chutes when the barrels reached nearly 200mph. By the summer of 1998, they were ready to try the tests with an actual SR20. Chief Test Pilot Scott D. Anderson, a Stanford graduate and [...] "Renaissance man" [...] who was known as a beloved and charismatic figure in Duluth, successfully made the first deployment of CAPS, and would go on to make all seven of the inflight test-deployments for development and certification of the SR20.
