25|$|While its storage {{capacity}} {{is too low}} {{to make it the}} sole mechanism for storage, nonsynaptic plasticity could contribute to synaptic storage methods.

This specificity makes the {{storage capacity}} of nonsynaptic plasticity larger than if it were taken to be whole neuron modulation. Procedural memories are a good fit for this type of storage system because they do not require the high specificity that declarative memories do.

25|$|Chinese {{policies}} on College Entrance Examination {{have been influenced}} by the recruitment systems of western countries and the traditional culture of imperial examinations. Since Fudan University and Shanghai Jiao Tong University started independent enrolment before College Entrance Examination in 2007, some of the top Chinese colleges began to follow them using a new method to choose students besides unified examination system. In accordance with university regulations, those colleges appoint their own staff and are responsible for selecting students. Students can get admitted by taking a specific exam or interview before the College Entrance Examination. In this way, students have more chance to get admitted by the top colleges. In 2010, there were several critical reforms in the education field. In January 31, the education ministry in Guangdong province began to implement parallel voluntary admission in college entrance recruiting system, which is <b>an</b> <b>efficient</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> decrease the risk of getting into a college for the majority of students. In November 20, the education ministry of China cancelled the additional Olympics points in College Entrance Exam policy.

2500|$|By {{the late}} fifteenth century, {{the design of}} the carpets {{depicted}} in miniatures changed considerably. Large-format medaillons appeared, ornaments began to show elaborate curvilinear designs. Large spirals and tendrils, floral ornaments, depictions of flowers and animals, were often mirrored along the long or short axis of the carpet to obtain harmony and rhythm. The earlier [...] "kufic" [...] border design was replaced by tendrils and arabesques. All these patterns required a more elaborate system of weaving, as compared to weaving straight, rectilinear lines. Likewise, they require artists to create the design, weavers to execute them on the loom, and <b>an</b> <b>efficient</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> communicate the artist's ideas to the weaver.

The engine cost £1,184, and the engine house another £835. It was installed where the Whitehouse Drain met the River Little Ouse (otherwise known as Brandon Creek), and was commissioned in 1832, when it became known as the Brandon Engine. There were initial teething problems, which resulted in one of the scoop wheels being removed, repairs to the boiler, and a second boiler being installed, but once these problems had been sorted out, it became obvious that the new system was <b>an</b> <b>efficient</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> drain the Fens.|$|E

2500|$|Cyanomethyl groups {{represent}} {{an easy way}} to protect an iminium ion during allylic vinylation of the ketone. [...] Cyanamide groups and analogs have been often used in the generation iminium ions. [...] They are typically installed by nucleophilic addition onto an iminium ion, generally produced by amine alkylation with formaldehyde. [...] The iminium ion is thus masked. [...] It follows that usage of a cyanomethyl group provides <b>an</b> <b>efficient</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> control the aza-Cope/Mannich reaction. [...] The cyanomethyl group protects the nitrogen at the 2-position during formation of the other allylic analog by logic similar to cyanide-type umpolung. [...] It then later provides a good leaving group for formation of the iminium ion, in accordance with its usage in iminium ion generation. [...] Iminium ion generation from cyanomethyl groups is normally promoted by addition of silver nitrate, although other silver and copper compounds have been used. [...] This added step allows for more precise control of iminium ion generation. [...] Importantly, these preparatory reactions must be carried out at -78°C to prevent cyanomethyl/vinyllithium interaction. [...] This method also allows for many different possible N-substituents, and can be used to simplify the synthesis of octahydroindoles and pyrroles.|$|E
