While small, transfers would augment the wellbeing of most households in a meaningful way. However the economic impacts would not be transformational as the greatest barriers to development in the region are structural (such as the provision of infrastructure and security) which we argue still require government action. The limited economic benefits are outweighed by the potential associated conflict and governance risks. Cash transfers are unlikely to reduce conflict in the Niger Delta and could actually spark new tensions over the identification of recipients.

This article contends that more nuanced explanations can be provided by taking seriously the political economy context within which the process of securitisation is embedded. The article has two aims. First, it contributes to further refining securitisation theory by embedding Balzacq’s pragmatic act – which implies that securitising actors gain the assent of an audience based on a shared view of vulnerabilities – within a broad social conflict analysis. This latter can explain the socio-political struggles that create popular support for securitisation, and what social groups benefit from it. Second, it contributes to explanations of Bali’s contemporary political economy by operationalising the refined approach to explain how struggles over the spoils of tourism have created a receptive audience among a cross-class section of Balinese for the securitisation of “outside influences” – a euphemism for migrants, non-local investors and Western cultural influences.

This research brings together several pieces of high-performance interconnection technology: bus backplanes for symmetric multiprocessors, low-latency networks for connections between machines, and simple, user-level primitives for communication. The paper describes the shared memory message-passing protocol and analyzes the multiprotocol implementation with both microbenchmarks and Split-C applications. Three aspects of the communication layer are critical to performance: the overhead of cache-coherence mechanisms, the method of managing concurrent access, {{and the cost of}} <b>accessing</b> <b>state</b> with the slower protocol.

It particularly focuses on big business and highlights the central role that greater exposure to international competition during the course of opening up and liberalization played in the evolution of its regime preferences. The article suggests that the central mechanism which has led to the regime preference change is socialization by strategic calculation facilitated by business' increasing incorporation into transnational networks. It asserts that the Turkish big business' experience is particularly interesting because international exposure not only created new opportunities for big business, but also new divisions and rivalries within the business community. These new rivals formed flourishing alliances with the government, with their accompanying claims to power that challenged the big business' previous hegemony in <b>accessing</b> <b>state</b> resources. In the process, big business' fear of losing its privileged status to rival business groups and the resulting uncertainties led big business to associate democratization with higher benefits, as they became increasingly aware of the link between democratization and diminished uncertainties, through their interaction with transnational business networks.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 22 nd Annual Southern African Transport Conference 14 - 16 July 2003 "National issues affecting the movement of people and goods - strategic approaches", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. ABSTRACT: This paper presents findings from and commentary on a selection of four recent research projects that were carried out by students from the Sociology Discipline at the University of Natal with the financial and other support of the National DoT's Eastern Centre of Transport Development (ECOTD). The research projects selected for presentation are all based on transportation related issues facing residents of rural cum semi rural areas {{in various parts of}} KwaZulu Natal. Obviously the scope of these investigations is limited by the constraints inherent in students' independent work and hence the results cannot be expanded to give generalities. Nonetheless, the projects are considered to give a useful initial insight of rural transport issues. People commuting from a rural area of Vulindela to the urban centre of Pietermaritzburg are the subject of the first two projects. Whilst one project dealt with users of minibus taxis, the other dealt with bus passengers. The main issues arising from these projects were the cost and low level of public transport services. However, the basic pattern of land use development - low residential densities and large distances between settlements - are not conducive to the provision of a high standard of road infrastructure or a viable public transport service. Elderly people <b>accessing</b> <b>state</b> grants are the subject of the third project. Again travel costs were a major issue with this group of people: low incomes and relatively large fares must inevitably result in a cause for concern. However, the main issues for these people related primarily to the conditions under which they had to queue for grant payments at the end point of their trips. The fourth and final project deals with the provision of transport services as opposed to the usership issues of the other projects. In this case the subject of study is small hauliers. As may be expected the issues arising are similar to those pertaining to service users. The problems created by the pattern of land use development in rural areas are a common denominator - as are low income levels. It is suggested that attention should be given to the possibility of a change in settlement patterns but that the social implications of such a change are examined very carefully. Experience shows that many social disasters were created {{in the latter half of}} last century in Europe by moving people out of their communities and into high density developments.

40|$|Housing {{has ever}} been the major concern of Hong Kong people. The housing prices of Hong Kong have fluctuated up and down largely {{in the past two}} decades. Housing prices reached a new record high in December 2013. Although the housing prices slide down {{slightly}} in recent months, they remain at very high level. Private housing became more and more unaffordable to Hong Kong people including the middle class. Many Hong Kong people resort to public rental housing (PRH) to meet their housing needs. As at the end of 2013, there were about 122, 200 for non-elderly one-person applicants under Quota and Points System (QPS) and that were even more than 121, 100 for general waiting list applicants. This reflects the large housing needs of young singletons for one-person household flats and alarms the public and the government of the serious shortage of housing for young singletons. The housing needs and aspirations of young singletons have ever been marginalised by the government that can be indicated by the housing policy carried out in Hong Kong. Singletons aged 21 or over have only been allowed to apply for PRH since 1985. However, the priorities of allocating PRH are given to family households, elderly and the disadvantaged. The successful housed number of non-elderly one-person applicants in permanent public rental housing increased from only 125 in 1996 / 1997 to 3, 700 in 2004 / 2005. The implementation of QPS since 2005 has greatly restricted the access of PRH by young singletons because the allocation of PRH is mainly on the basis of age and subject to the annual maximum allocation quota of 2, 000 units. On the other hand, singletons have only been allowed to apply for purchase of subsidised sale flats and home purchase loans for purchase of self-occupied flat since 1998. All these are restricted by limited quota, size of flats to be purchased and half of the loans granted to general family applicants. Following the cease of various subsidised sale schemes and home purchase loans from end of 2002, the assistance to singletons to purchase their self-occupied flats also has stopped. From the perspective of housing policy in developed countries, government interventions in the housing market have been reduced for the past few decades especially after Asian Financial Crisis and Global Financial Tsunami. Governments of western countries and developed countries of Asia have shifted to adopt more market oriented housing policy and to encourage homeownership since 1990 s. Governments emphasize provision of social rental housing to those in need. People living in social rental housing have then been stigmatized. Consequently, housing prices in these countries have been fluctuating up and down largely and supply of housing has not been matched by the needs of people. Accessibility to social rental housing by young singletons is dampened. Shortage of affordable housing affects young singletons seriously. Many young singletons tend to stay longer at parental home as what Yamada (1999) described as “parasite” single. Mckee (2012) finds that it is an international phenomenon of reducing self-occupied homeownership rates for young people as more young people staying with their parents, studying longer, having difficulty in getting employments, facing restriction on <b>accessing</b> <b>state</b> welfare benefit and in changing household formation. In acknowledging the housing needs and demands of young people, governments of Asian countries tend to adopt policy promoting self-occupied homeownership to assist young people in meeting their housing aspirations. Singapore government adopts housing policy encouraging homeownership by introducing different schemes to meet varied needs and aspirations of Singaporeans at different stages of life-cycle. In recognition of the housing aspirations and contribution of singletons, Singapore government has provided housing benefits of singletons aged 35 years or over to buy resale Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats in HDB estates and since 2013 they has been allowed to buy new flats of particular size in non-matures estates from HDB. In South Korea, the previous LEE Myung-bak administration introduced new housing policy to assist newly married couples by providing long-term self-occupied home financing with low interest rates and increasing supply of self-occupied homes for low-income newly married couples to solve the housing problems of young families. The Australian government has introduced various measures to deal with the housing affordability problem including a first self-occupied home owner savings account, a notional rental affordability scheme, national housing affordability fund and establishment of a land supply council. Many researches have found that housing pathways of young people in developed countries are similar in following a sequence that individuals move from the parental self-occupied homes through sharing accommodation, private rental housing and into self-occupied homes. Young singletons have different tenure preferences that may vary according to the educations levels, income levels, security of jobs, family backgrounds, gender, views on marriage and stages of life cycle. This paper attempts to understand the housing needs and aspirations of young singletons in Hong Kong, the reasons causing them to have different needs and aspirations and their expectations on the government in meeting their housing needs and aspiration. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were adopted to obtain the general information and views of young singleton respondents by questionnaires survey and to have better understanding of the relationship of young singleton’s backgrounds, reasons for moving out from parents, their preferences and affordability fro housing and expectations on government by in-depth interviews. The results indicate that nearly half (44 %) of young singleton respondents had no plan to buy their self-occupied flats and chose renting and only 56 % of young singleton respondents had plan to buy their self-occupied flats. To a certain extent, young singletons of Hong Kong change their housing needs and aspiration according to their stages of life-cycle. After leaving parental home, young singletons would choose sharing accommodation in private rental housing. They plan to buy their self-occupied flat when they get older or married. Factors such as age, education levels, income levels, gender, Chinese traditions, household size and present housing tenures of young singletons as well as government policy affect their housing needs and aspirations. Young singletons expect the government to provide them with more in-kind and in-cash housing subsidies in order to assist them meeting their housing needs and aspirations. published_or_final_versionHousing ManagementMasterMaster of Housing Managemen...|$|E

However, stably <b>accessing</b> such <b>states</b> is complicated by thermo-optic dispersion. For example, in the Si 3 N 4 platform, precisely dispersion-engineered structures can support broadband operation, but microsecond thermal time constants have necessitated fast pump power or frequency control to stabilize the solitons.

Our model agrees with experimental results as well as numerical simulations based on a Lugiato-Lefever equation that incorporates thermo-optic dispersion. Moreover, it also explains an experimental observation that {{a member of an}} adjacent mode family on the red-detuned side of the pump mode can mitigate the thermal requirements for <b>accessing</b> soliton <b>states...</b>|$|R

40|$|The dancer's {{consciousness}} {{is an integral}} component of choreography and performance, but has been afforded little significant attention within dance theory or practice. This thesis aims to investigate {{the nature of the}} dancer's consciousness and it develops a model which allows dancers to access particular conscious states in choreography and performance. This model is entitled the Dance Consciousness Model. The model is founded on consciousness theory and, within it, two states of dance consciousness have been defined: intrattentive consciousness and non-intrattentive consciousness. These are based on the states of consciousness described by consciousness researchers, dance theorists and practitioners and theatre theorists. The Dance Consciousness Model comprises methods for examining and accessing the dance consciousness. During the formulation of these methods a variety of theories and practices were explored: phenomenological reduction, the explicitation session, somatics, sport psychology, visual and verbal processing, attention studies, Buddhist Introspection and Bodyweather. Relevant components were extracted from each theory and practice and applied to the discipline of dance. This resulted {{in the development of a}} series of methods for examining and <b>accessing</b> <b>states</b> of intrattention and non-intrattention. These methods were explored, by trained dancers, in three empirical projects which comprised exploratory workshops, choreographic and rehearsal processes and performances. The projects were recorded on video and the dancers were interviewed at regular intervals. The analysis of the information collected was combined with the consciousness theory established at the start of the study and resulted in the formulation of a consciousness training programme and the Dance Consciousness Model. The training precedes the application of the model and comprises a series of workshops in which dancers are taught to access, examine and switch between states of intrattention and non-intrattention. The Dance Consciousness Model is believed to be the first of its kind and is intended for application by dancers in the choreography and performance of contemporary dance.

In this letter, we compare the dynamics of CT states formed in the different charge-transfer pathways in a range of model systems. We show that the nature and dynamics of the generated CT states are similar in the case of electron and hole transfer. However the yield of bound and free charges is observed to be strongly dependent on the HOMOD-HOMOA and LUMOD-LUMOA energy differences of the material system. We propose a qualitative model in which the effects of static disorder and sampling of states during the relaxation determine the probability of <b>accessing</b> CT <b>states</b> favourable for charge separation...|$|R
40|$|In situ FT-IR {{measurements}} and electronic structure calculations are {{reported for the}} reduction of CO_ 2 catalyzed by the macrocyclic complex [Co^(II) N_ 4 H]^(2 +) (N_ 4 H = 2, 12 -dimethyl- 3, 7, 11, 17 -tetraazabicyclo-[11. 3. 1]-heptadeca- 1 (17), 2, 11, 13, 15 -pentaene). Beginning from the [Co^(II) N_ 4 H]^(2 +) resting state of the complex in wet acetonitrile solution, two different visible light sensitizers with substantially different reducing power are employed to access reduced <b>states.</b> <b>Accessing</b> reduced <b>states</b> of the complex with a [Ru(bpy) _ 3]^(2 +) sensitizer yields an infrared band at 1670 cm^(– 1) attributed to carboxylate, which is also observed for an authentic sample of the one-electron reduced complex [CoN_ 4 H(MeCN) ]^+ in CO_ 2 saturated acetonitrile solution. The results are interpreted based on calculations using the pure BP 86 functional that correctly reproduces experimental geometries. Continuum solvation effects are also included. The calculations show that Co is reduced to Co^I in the first reduction, {{which is consistent with}} experimental d–d spectra of square Co(I) macrocycle complexes. The energy of the CO_ 2 adduct of the one-electron reduced catalyst complex is essentially the same as for [CoN_ 4 H(MeCN) ]^+, which implies that {{only a fraction of the}} latter forms an adduct with CO_ 2. By contrast, the calculations indicate a crucial role for redox noninnocence of the macrocyclic ligand in the doubly reduced state, [Co^I(N_ 4 H) –•], and show that [Co^I(N_ 4 H) –•] binds partially reduced CO_ 2 fairly strongly. Experimentally accessing [Co^I(N_ 4 H) –•] with an Ir(bpy) _ 3 sensitizer with greater reducing power closes the catalytic cycle as FT-IR spectroscopy shows CO production. Use of isotopically substituted C^(18) O_ 2 also shows clear evidence for ^(18) O-substituted byproducts from CO_ 2 reduction to CO...|$|R
40|$|We {{probed the}} charge {{transfer}} {{interaction between the}} amine-containing molecules: hydrazine, polyaniline and aminobutyl phosphonic acid, and carbon nanotube field effect transistors (CNTFETs). We successfully converted p-type CNTFETs to n-type and drastically improved the device performance in both the ON- and OFF- transistor states utilizing hydrazine as dopant. We effectively switched the transistor polarity between p- and n- type by <b>accessing</b> different oxidation <b>states</b> of polyaniline. We also demonstrated the flexibility of modulating the threshold voltage (Vth) of a CNTFET by engineering various charge-accepting and -donating groups in the same molecule.
