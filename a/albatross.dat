5|$|After {{entering}} service, Nautilus and <b>Albatross</b> alternated between {{service with}} the High Seas Fleet; Nautilus {{participated in the}} annual fleet maneuvers in 1907 and 1908, {{and was replaced by}} <b>Albatross</b> thereafter. Nautilus was modernized at the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) in Kiel in 190910, and <b>Albatross</b> underwent a similar modernization there in 191011. While <b>Albatross</b> was out of service, Nautilus temporarily returned to the fleet. Once the former's refit was completed in 1911, the latter was transferred to mine warfare training in the North Sea before being decommissioned {{at the end of the}} year. <b>Albatross</b> remained in service through 1914, but apart from a collision with the steamer , the time passed uneventfully.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{the work}} on <b>albatross</b> genera, Robertson and Nunn went on in 1998 to propose a revised {{taxonomy}} with 24 different species, compared to the 14 then accepted. This expanded taxonomy elevated many established subspecies to full species, but was criticised for not using, in every case, peer reviewed information to justify the splits. Since then, further studies have in some instances supported or disproved the splits; a 2004 paper analysing the mitochondrial DNA and microsatellites agreed with {{the conclusion that the}} Antipodean <b>albatross</b> and the Tristan <b>albatross</b> were distinct from the wandering <b>albatross,</b> per Robertson and Nunn, but found that the suggested Gibson's <b>albatross,</b> Diomedea gibsoni, was not distinct from the Antipodean <b>albatross.</b> For the most part, an interim taxonomy of 21 species is accepted by ITIS and many other researchers, though by no means all—in 2004 Penhallurick and Wink called for the number of species to be reduced to 13 (including the lumping of the Amsterdam <b>albatross</b> with the wandering <b>albatross),</b> although this paper was itself controversial. On all sides is the widespread agreement on the need for further research to clarify the issue.|$|E
5|$|<b>Albatross</b> was {{returned}} to Germany {{after the war ended}} in 1918, and both vessels were stricken from the naval register in 1919. <b>Albatross,</b> never repaired from the damage sustained in 1915, was sold for scrap immediately, but Nautilus was retained as a hulk until 1928, when she too was broken up.|$|E
5|$|The <b>albatrosses</b> {{comprise}} between 13 and 24 species (the {{number of}} species is still {{a matter of some}} debate, 21 being the most commonly accepted number) in four genera. These genera are the great <b>albatrosses</b> (Diomedea), the mollymawks (Thalassarche), the North Pacific <b>albatrosses</b> (Phoebastria), and the sooty <b>albatrosses</b> or sooties (Phoebetria). The North Pacific <b>albatrosses</b> are considered to be a sister taxon to the great <b>albatrosses,</b> while the sooty <b>albatrosses</b> are considered closer to the mollymawks.|$|R
50|$|The mollymawks are a {{group of}} {{medium-sized}} <b>albatrosses</b> that form the genus Thalassarche. The name has sometimes been used for the genus Phoebetria as well, but these are usually called sooty <b>albatrosses.</b> They are restricted to the Southern Hemisphere, where {{they are the most}} common of the <b>albatrosses.</b> They were long considered {{to be in the same}} genus as the great <b>albatrosses,</b> Diomedea, but a study of their mitochondrial DNA showed that they are a monophyletic taxon related to the sooty <b>albatrosses,</b> and they were placed in their own genus.|$|R
5|$|More recent {{research}} by Gary Nunn of the American Museum of Natural History (1996) {{and other researchers}} around the world studied the mitochondrial DNA of all 14 accepted species, finding four, not two, monophyletic groups within the <b>albatrosses.</b> They proposed the resurrection {{of two of the}} old genus names, Phoebastria for the North Pacific <b>albatrosses</b> and Thalassarche for the mollymawks, with the great <b>albatrosses</b> retaining Diomedea and the sooty <b>albatrosses</b> staying in Phoebetria. Both the British Ornithologists' Union and the South African authorities split the <b>albatrosses</b> into four genera as Nunn suggested, and the change has been accepted by the majority of researchers.|$|R
5|$|Karpf {{ordered the}} slow <b>Albatross</b> {{to make for}} neutral Swedish waters, where {{theoretically}} she would be protected from the Russian attack, while he tried to escape with Augsburg to the south. Soon, all four Russian cruisers were firing at <b>Albatross,</b> allowing Augsburg and the torpedo boats to escape freely. At 07:20, <b>Albatross</b> was hit for the first time. As the range closed, the Russian ships came close enough that <b>Albatross</b> could reply with her 8.8guns, but {{by this time the}} Russian fire was beginning to take its toll. The forecastle was riddled with holes, the foremast was knocked down, and the conning tower was destroyed, killing the men inside. At 07:45, <b>Albatross</b> entered Swedish territorial waters, but the Russians continued firing for another twenty minutes, checking their fire only at 08:07 after the ship had Östergarn Sound. By this time, the ship was badly damaged and was listing heavily to port. Fearing that the ship would capsize, her captain ordered her to be beached.|$|E
5|$|On 1 July, the {{minelayer}} , {{escorted by}} the cruisers Lübeck, Roon, and Augsburg and seven destroyers, laid a minefield north of Bogskär. While returning to port, the flotilla separated into two sections; Augsburg, <b>Albatross,</b> and three destroyers made for Rixhöft while {{the remainder of}} the unit went to Libau. Augsburg and <b>Albatross</b> were intercepted by a powerful Russian squadron commanded by Rear Admiral Bakhirev, consisting of three armored and two light cruisers. Commodore Johannes von Karpf, the flotilla commander, ordered the slower <b>Albatross</b> to steam for neutral Swedish waters and recalled Roon and Lübeck. <b>Albatross</b> was grounded off Gotland and Augsburg escaped, and the Russian squadron briefly engaged Roon before both sides broke contact. Upon being informed of the situation, Hopman sortied with Prinz Heinrich and Prinz Adalbert to support von Karpf. While en route, the cruisers encountered the British submarine , which scored a hit on Prinz Adalbert. Hopman broke off the operation and returned to port with the damaged cruiser.|$|E
5|$|The Maori {{used the}} wing {{bones of the}} <b>albatross</b> to carve flutes.|$|E
50|$|The feeding {{habits of}} these <b>albatrosses</b> {{are similar to}} other <b>albatrosses</b> in that they eat fish, squid, crustacea, and carrion.|$|R
5|$|<b>Albatrosses</b> {{are among}} the largest of flying birds, and the great <b>albatrosses</b> from the genus Diomedea have the largest wingspans of any extant birds.|$|R
5|$|Another {{threat to}} <b>albatrosses</b> is {{introduced}} species, such as rats or feral cats, which directly attack <b>albatrosses</b> or their chicks and eggs. <b>Albatrosses</b> {{have evolved to}} breed on islands where land mammals are absent and have not developed defences against them. Even species as small as mice can be detrimental; on Gough Island the chicks of Tristan <b>albatrosses</b> are attacked and eaten alive by introduced house mice. Introduced species can have other indirect effects: cattle overgrazed essential cover on Amsterdam Island, threatening the Amsterdam albatross; on other islands introduced plants reduce potential nesting habitat.|$|R
5|$|The adult plumage {{of most of}} the {{albatrosses}} {{is usually}} some variation of dark upper-wing and back with white undersides, often compared to that of a gull. The extent of colouration varies: the southern royal <b>albatross</b> is almost completely white except for the ends and trailing edges of the wings in fully mature males, while the Amsterdam <b>albatross</b> has an almost juvenile-like breeding plumage {{with a great deal of}} brown, particularly a strong brown band around the chest. Several species of mollymawks and North Pacific albatrosses have face markings like eye patches or have grey or yellow on the head and nape. Three <b>albatross</b> species, the black-footed <b>albatross</b> and the two sooty albatrosses, vary completely from the usual patterns and are almost entirely dark brown (or dark grey in places in the case of the light-mantled <b>albatross).</b> Albatrosses take several years to get their full adult breeding plumage.|$|E
5|$|The <b>albatross</b> diet is {{predominantly}} cephalopods, fish, crustaceans, and offal (organ meat), although {{they will also}} scavenge carrion and feed on other zooplankton. It {{should be noted that}} for most species a comprehensive understanding of diet is known for only the breeding season, when the albatrosses regularly return to land and study is possible. The importance of each of these food sources varies from species to species, and even from population to population; some concentrate on squid alone, others take more krill or fish. Of the two <b>albatross</b> species found in Hawaii, one, the black-footed <b>albatross,</b> takes mostly fish while the Laysan feeds on squid.|$|E
5|$|The next operation, VII, {{began on}} the night of 30 June, when <b>Albatross,</b> Roon, and five torpedo boats steamed out of the Vistula River; they were met the {{following}} morning by Augsburgthe flagship of Kommodore (Commodore) Johannes von KarpfLübeck, and two more torpedo boats. <b>Albatross</b> was to lay another minefield off Bogskär. Later that day, Roon, Lübeck, and two torpedo boats separated {{from the rest of the}} flotilla to guard a channel between German minefields, while <b>Albatross</b> and the rest of the ships continued north to Bogskär. That evening, <b>Albatross</b> laid a field of 160mines, after which she and Augsburg turned back south and rendezvoused with Roon and Lübeck. Karpf then issued via wireless a report to headquarters that gave his position, speed, and bearing. This message was intercepted and decrypted by the Russians; coincidentally, the Russian fleet had planned an operation to bombard Memel the following day, and several cruises had put to sea on 1 July.|$|E
40|$|International audienceSouthern Royal <b>Albatrosses</b> (Diomedea epomophora) were satellite-tracked from Campbell Island {{during the}} {{incubation}} period in 1997 and 1999. Their foraging activity {{was restricted to}} shelf and shelf-break areas within 1250 km of their breeding site. Foraging activity by 8 of the 14 individuals tracked was concentrated at a zone near the Snares Islands, on the Campbell Plateau. Southern and Northern Royal <b>Albatrosses</b> (D. sanfordi) foraged on average nearer their breeding site than two other species of greater <b>albatrosses</b> (Gibson's [D. gibsoni], and Wandering [D. exulans] <b>Albatrosses)</b> studied during the incubation period...|$|R
50|$|One Legend {{says that}} on his death, the <b>albatrosses</b> got {{together}} and sang a song (their normal call). This is where the family name for <b>albatrosses</b> comes from (Diomedeae).|$|R
5|$|The <b>albatrosses</b> {{are among}} the largest of flying birds, and the great <b>albatrosses</b> from the genus Diomedea have the largest wingspans of any extant birds. One species has been {{recorded}} in Maryland.|$|R
5|$|The ships' hulls were {{constructed}} from transverse and longitudinal steel frames, and {{were divided into}} nine watertight compartments, with a double bottom that extended for 60percent {{of the length of}} the hull. Both vessels had two pole masts fitted with spotting tops. Nautilus and <b>Albatross</b> had different bows; Nautilus received a clipper bow, while <b>Albatross</b> had a ram bow like contemporary German light cruisers. <b>Albatross</b> also had a higher forecastle that extended {{to the base of the}} main mast, while Nautilus was completed with a superstructure deck that began just aft of the fore mast.|$|E
5|$|The use of data loggers at {{sea that}} record {{ingestion}} of water against time (providing a likely time of feeding) suggests that albatrosses predominantly feed during the day. Analysis of the squid beaks regurgitated by albatrosses {{has shown that}} many of the squid eaten are too large to have been caught alive, and include mid-water species likely to be beyond the reach of <b>albatross,</b> suggesting that, for some species (like the wandering <b>albatross),</b> scavenged squid may be {{an important part of the}} diet. The source of these dead squid is a matter of debate; some certainly comes from squid fisheries, but in nature it primarily comes from the die-off that occurs after squid spawning and the vomit of squid-eating whales (sperm whales, pilot whales and southern bottlenose whales). The diet of other species, like the black-browed <b>albatross</b> or the grey-headed <b>albatross,</b> is rich with smaller species of squid that tend to sink after death, and scavenging is not assumed to play a large role in their diet. The waved <b>albatross</b> has been observed practising kleptoparasitism, harassing boobies to steal their food, making it the only member of its order to do so regularly.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I in July 1914, both ships were mobilized to lay a series of minefields, initially to protect Germany's coastlines in the North and Baltic Seas. In August, the two ships laid offensive minefields off the British coast, and Nautilus made a similar attempt in October that was cancelled when radio intercepts indicated British naval forces were present. In June 1915, <b>Albatross</b> {{was transferred to the}} eastern Baltic, where she began to lay offensive minefields. The last of these resulted in the Battle of Åland Islands on 2 July after a group of Russian armored cruisers intercepted <b>Albatross</b> and her escorts. The cruisers badly damaged <b>Albatross,</b> and to prevent her sinking, her captain beached the ship off the coast of neutral Sweden.|$|E
40|$|Visceral {{fat from}} Black-footed <b>Albatrosses,</b> Diomedea nigripes, and Laysan <b>Albatrosses,</b> D. immutabilis, from Midway Atoll, North Pacific Ocean, in 1969 {{contained}} appreciable residues of DDT, DDE, and PCBs, and measurable quantities of DDD, dieldrin, and mercury. Greater residues in Black-footed <b>Albatrosses</b> {{may have resulted}} from scavenging. No gamma-emitting radionuclides were detected. No decreases in eggshell weight occurred in either species between 1910 and 1969...|$|R
50|$|The great <b>albatrosses</b> range {{across the}} Southern Ocean, and nest (for the most part) on {{isolated}} oceanic islands. The wandering <b>albatrosses</b> nest on islands around the Southern Ocean, from the Atlantic Ocean (South Georgia and Tristan da Cunha), to the Indian Ocean and New Zealand's Subantarctic islands. The royal <b>albatrosses</b> nest only on New Zealand's Subantarctic islands, with one unusual colony on New Zealand's Otago Peninsula.|$|R
500|$|<b>Albatrosses,</b> of the {{biological}} family Diomedeidae, are large seabirds related to the procellariids, storm petrels and diving petrels in the order Procellariiformes (the tubenoses). They range widely in the Southern Ocean and the North Pacific. They are absent from the North Atlantic, although fossil remains show they once occurred there and occasional vagrants are found. <b>Albatrosses</b> are among the largest of flying birds, and the great <b>albatrosses</b> (genus Diomedea) have the longest wingspans of any extant birds, reaching up to [...] The <b>albatrosses</b> are usually regarded as falling into four genera, but there is disagreement over the number of species.|$|R
5|$|<b>Albatross</b> chicks take a {{long time}} to fledge. In the case of the great albatrosses, it can take up to 280 days; even for the smaller albatrosses, it takes {{anywhere}} between 140 and 170 days. Like many seabirds, <b>albatross</b> chicks will gain enough weight to be heavier than their parents, and prior to fledging they use these reserves to build up body condition (particularly growing all their flight feathers), usually fledging at the same weight as their parents. Between 15% and 65% of those fledged survive to breed. <b>Albatross</b> chicks fledge on their own and receive no further help from their parents, who return to the nest after fledging, unaware their chick has left. Studies of juveniles dispersing at sea have suggested an innate migration behaviour, a genetically coded navigation route, which helps young birds when they are first out at sea.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} for certain why the {{albatrosses}} became extinct in the North Atlantic, although rising sea levels due to an interglacial warming period {{are thought to have}} submerged the site of a short-tailed <b>albatross</b> colony that has been excavated in Bermuda. Some southern species have occasionally turned up as vagrants in the North Atlantic and can become exiled, remaining there for decades. One of these exiles, a black-browed <b>albatross,</b> returned to gannet colonies in Scotland for many years in an attempt to breed.|$|E
5|$|Scientists and conservationists (most {{importantly}} BirdLife International {{and their}} partners, {{who run the}} Save the <b>Albatross</b> campaign) are working with governments and fishermen to find solutions to the threats albatrosses face. Techniques such as setting longline bait at night, dyeing the bait blue, setting the bait underwater, {{increasing the amount of}} weight on lines and using bird scarers can all reduce the seabird bycatch. For example, a collaborative study between scientists and fishermen in New Zealand successfully tested an underwater setting device for longliners which set the lines below the reach of vulnerable <b>albatross</b> species. The use of some of these techniques in the Patagonian toothfish fishery in the Falkland Islands is thought to have reduced the number of black-browed <b>albatross</b> taken by the fleet in the last 10 years. Conservationists have also worked on the field of island restoration, removing introduced species that threaten native wildlife, which protects albatrosses from introduced predators.|$|E
5|$|The <b>albatrosses</b> {{are among}} the largest of flying birds, and the great <b>albatrosses</b> from the genus Diomedea have the largest wingspans of any extant birds. One species has been {{recorded}} in New Jersey.|$|R
5|$|<b>Albatrosses</b> {{combine these}} soaring {{techniques}} {{with the use}} of predictable weather systems: <b>albatrosses</b> in the Southern Hemisphere flying north from their colonies will take a clockwise route, and those flying south will fly counterclockwise. <b>Albatrosses</b> are so well adapted to this lifestyle that their heart rates while flying are close to their basal heart rate when resting. This efficiency is such that the most energetically demanding aspect of a foraging trip is not the distance covered, but the landings, take-offs and hunting they undertake having found a food source. A common assumption is that <b>albatrosses</b> must be able to sleep in flight, although no direct evidence has ever been obtained.|$|R
40|$|By extracting {{energy from}} the highly dynamic wind and wave fields that typify pelagic habitats, <b>albatrosses</b> are able to proceed almost {{exclusively}} by gliding flight. Although energetic costs of gliding are low, enabling breeding <b>albatrosses</b> to forage hundreds to thousands of kilometers from their colonies, these and time costs vary with relative wind direction. This causes <b>albatrosses</b> in some areas to route provisioning trips to avoid headwind flight, potentially limiting habitat accessibility during the breeding season. In addition, because female <b>albatrosses</b> have lower wing loadings than males, {{it has been argued}} that they are better adapted to flight in light winds, leading to sexual segregation of foraging areas. We used satellite telemetry and immersion logger data to quantify the effects of relative wind speed, sex, breeding stage, and trip stage on the ground speeds (Vg) of four species of Southern Ocean <b>albatrosses</b> breeding at South Georgia. Vg was linearly related to the wind speed component in the direction of flight (Vwf), its effect being greatest on Wandering <b>Albatrosses</b> Diomedea exulans, followed by Black-browed <b>Albatrosses</b> Thalassarche melanophrys, Light-mantled Sooty <b>Albatrosses</b> Phoebatria palpebrata, and Gray-headed <b>Albatrosses</b> T. chrysostoma. Ground speeds at Vwf = 0 were similar to airspeeds predicted by aerodynamic theory and were higher in males than in females. However, we found no evidence that this led to sexual segregation, as males and females experienced comparable wind speeds during foraging trips. Black-browed, Gray-headed, and Light-mantled Sooty <b>Albatrosses</b> did not engage in direct, uninterrupted bouts of flight on moonless nights, but Wandering <b>Albatrosses</b> attained comparable Vg night and day, regardless of lunar phase. Relative flight direction was more important in determining Vg than absolute wind speed. When birds were less constrained in the middle stage of foraging trips, all species flew predominantly across the wind. However, in some instances, commuting birds encountered headwinds during outward trips and tail winds on their return, with the result that Vg was 1. 0 – 3. 4 m/s faster during return trips. This, we hypothesize, could result from constraints imposed by the location of prey resources relative to the colony at South Georgia or could represent an energy optimization strategy...|$|R
5|$|The {{fossil record}} of the {{albatrosses}} in the Northern Hemisphere is more complete {{than that of the}} southern, and many fossil forms of <b>albatross</b> have been found in the North Atlantic, which today has no albatrosses. The remains of a colony of short-tailed albatrosses have been uncovered on the island of Bermuda, and the majority of fossil albatrosses from the North Atlantic have been of the genus Phoebastria (the North Pacific albatrosses); one, Phoebastria anglica, has been found in deposits in both North Carolina and England. Due to convergent evolution in particular of the leg and foot bones, remains of the prehistoric pseudotooth birds (Pelagornithidae) may be mistaken for those of extinct albatrosses; Manu may be such a case, and quite certainly the supposed giant <b>albatross</b> femur from the Early Pleistocene Dainichi Formation at Kakegawa, Japan, actually is from one of the last pseudotooth birds. For more data on fossil species of the living <b>albatross</b> genera, see the genus articles.|$|E

50|$|Observations {{made during}} June 2010 from the Hokkaido University {{research}} vessel the Oshoro Maru {{in the western}} North Pacific showed an apparent symbiotic relationship between a school of 57 ocean sunfish (Mola mola) and Laysan and black-footed <b>albatrosses.</b> The sunfish were infected with the mesoparasitic copepods from the genus Pennella and the <b>albatrosses</b> were seen to remove these parasites from the sunfish which appeared to be actively attempting to attract the <b>albatrosses.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{recorded}} {{the age of}} individual wing and tail feathers of Black-browed and Grey-headed <b>Albatrosses</b> Diomedea melanophris and D. chrysostoma of known age and breeding status at Bird Island, South Georgia. Breeders and non-breeders of both species moult their rectrices annually. Non-breeders moult primaries biennially. In {{the first year of}} a cycle, the outer three and some inner primaries are moulted descendantly; in the next year the inner primaries are moulted ascendantly, starting from primary seven. There is a general progression to moulting equal numbers of primaries in each half of the cycle by the time breeding starts at about 10 years of age. Grey-headed <b>Albatrosses</b> usually moult fewer primaries than Black-browed <b>Albatrosses,</b> particularly as 3 -year-olds, when they undertake substantial plumage change in body moult. Most secondaries in Black-browed <b>Albatrosses</b> have been replaced once by age 4 years. Breeding Black-browed <b>Albatrosses</b> continue the moult pattern established as immatures whether they fail or not, as do failed Grey-headed <b>Albatrosses.</b> Successful Grey-headed <b>Albatrosses,</b> which breed again 16 months later, moult their three innermost primaries after breeding in the remainder of the current year and, after a period when moult is interrupted, renew the remaining primaries the following year. Comparisons between species and between failed and successful birds within species indicate that moult rate is not closely linked to the length of the interval between breeding attempts. Interspecies differences are better explained by breeding latitude, with tropical <b>albatrosses</b> moulting twice as fast as sub-Antarctic species, possibly reflecting food availability outside the breeding season...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe highly mobile {{wandering}} <b>albatrosses</b> (Diomedea exulans) are {{adapted to}} navigate the extreme environment of the Southern Ocean and return to isolated islands to breed. Each year they cover several {{hundreds of thousands of}} kilometers during travels across the sea. Little is known about the dispersal flights and migration of young <b>albatrosses.</b> We tracked, by satellite telemetry, the departure dispersal of 13 juvenile wandering <b>albatrosses</b> from the Crozet Islands and compared them with tracks of 7 unrelated adults during the interbreeding season. We used the satellite tracks to identify different behavioural steps of the inherited migration program used by juvenile wandering <b>albatrosses</b> during their first solo-migration. Our results show that the juvenile wandering <b>albatrosses</b> from Crozet Islands moved to sex-specific foraging zones of the ocean using at departures selectively the wind. The results suggest that the inherited migration program used by the juvenile wandering <b>albatrosses</b> encode several distinct steps, based on inherited preferred departure routes, differences in migration distance between sexes, and selective use of winds. During long transportation flights the <b>albatrosses</b> were influenced by winds and both adult and juveniles followed approximate loxodrome (rhumbline) routes coinciding with the foraging zone and the specific latitudes of their destination areas. During the long segments of transportation flights across open seas the juveniles selected routes at more northerly latitudes than adults...|$|R
