5|$|Native Americans have {{inhabited}} the Table Rocks area {{for at least}} 15,000 years before European-American settlement. Starting in the mid-19th century during a gold rush, the settlers forced the Takelma tribe <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Table</b> Rocks and into reservations. The surrounding area was quickly developed. The Table Rock post office was established in 1872, an airstrip was built atop Lower Table Rock in 1948, and a very high frequency omni-directional range (VOR) aviation tower was constructed on Upper Table Rock in the 1960s. The Table Rocks were not protected until the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Director Jewison can put {{his cards}} on the table, let his camera cut suspensefully to the players' intent faces, but a pool shark sinking a tricky shot into a side pocket {{undoubtedly}} offers more range. Kid also has a less compelling subplot. <b>Away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> McQueen gambles on a blonde (Tuesday Weld) and on the integrity of his dealer pal, Karl Malden. Pressure comes from a conventionally vicious Southern gentleman (Rip Torn), whose pleasures include a Negro mistress, a pistol range adjacent to his parlor, and fixed card games. As Malden's wife, Ann-Margret spells trouble of another kind, though her naive impersonation of a wicked, wicked woman recalls the era when the femme fatale wore breastplates lashed together with spider web. By the time all the bets are in, Cincinnati Kid appears to hold a losing hand.|$|E
25|$|However, in January 2009 {{the company}} {{appointed}} Rothschild to advise on talks with its banking syndicate, led by Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and Mediobanca to restructure a EUR 1.1bn debt. Initially Candover {{was expected to}} participate in a EUR 100m capital injection but by February, it had walked <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> writing off its investment; Permira had already done so.|$|E

6000|$|MRS. CLANDON. Thank you, yes. (She {{turns her}} chair <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> writing <b>table,</b> {{and sits down}} again. Gloria crosses to the hearth and sits {{crouching}} there with her face averted.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thank your ladyship, I don't like tanzing, and I don't like cards," [...] says Miss Hester, tossing up her head; and, {{dropping}} a curtsey like a [...] "cheese," [...] she strutted <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Countess's <b>table.</b>|$|R
500|$|At 8:05 am, as Missouri sailed past Fort Wool, Captain Brown turned {{control of}} the ship (known in naval terms as the [...] "conn" [...] of the ship) over to the officer of the deck and {{departed}} for the chart house. His arrival at the chart house caused Ensign E. R. Harris, who had been tracking the battleship's course on the chart, to move <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> resulting in the interruption of the plot. Around the same time Captain Brown informed Commander Peckham that Missouri would soon run an acoustical range. This {{was the first time}} that the executive officer had heard about a planned acoustical range run.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{a renewed}} push on {{jurisdiction}} in reality programming by the WGA, including a rally outside North American headquarters of non-signatory reality producer FremantleMedia, talks again broke off on December 7 when the AMPTP walked <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> issuing {{a press release}} that they would return only upon the WGA dropping several key proposals, among them the reality proposal. This move had been predicted by reporter Nikki Finke and others, many of whom suspected the AMPTP was intentionally delaying negotiations {{so that it could}} terminate unwanted production contracts via force majeure. According to Wall Street, the impact of accepting all of WGA's proposals was [...] "largely negligible" [...] and [...] "financially small", suggesting that the studios were afraid that reaching a favorable settlement with the writers might [...] "embolden directors and actors in their coming renegotiations." ...|$|E
2500|$|Clinton blamed Arafat {{after the}} failure of the talks, stating, [...] "I regret that in 2000 Arafat missed the {{opportunity}} to bring that nation into being and pray for the day when the dreams of the Palestinian people for a state and a better life will be realized in a just and lasting peace." [...] The failure to come to an agreement was widely attributed to Yasser Arafat, as he walked <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> without making a concrete counter-offer and because Arafat did little to quell the series of Palestinian riots that began shortly after the summit. Arafat was also accused of scuttling the talks by Nabil Amr, a former minister in the Palestinian Authority. In My Life, Clinton wrote that Arafat once complimented Clinton by telling him, [...] "You are a great man." [...] Clinton responded, [...] "I am not a great man. I am a failure, and you made me one." ...|$|E
50|$|It {{is a tough}} plant, {{capable of}} {{resisting}} long periods of drought. It grows preferably in dry areas, often far <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> water <b>table,</b> both in flat {{as well as in}} mountainous terrain. This plant can also resist high salinity.|$|R
5000|$|Similarities {{with the}} Mexican coffee are apparent, though the sequentiality of the drink has taken it <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> typical dinner <b>table.</b>|$|R
40|$|In 50 {{cases in}} which hernioplasty was carried out with atraumatic {{technique}} under local anesthesia, <b>the</b> patients walked <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> operating <b>table,</b> then through <b>the</b> corridors, without assistance. They usually drove home {{the next day and}} returned to their regular occupations immediately. Few had pain necessitating more than mild analgesia...|$|R
2500|$|Harris {{approached}} another {{table where}} two girls were hiding. He {{bent down to}} look at them and dismissed them as [...] "pathetic". Harris then moved to another table where he fired twice, injuring 16-year-olds Nicole Nowlen and John Tomlin. When Tomlin attempted to move <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> Klebold kicked him. Harris then taunted Tomlin's attempt at escape before Klebold shot the youth repeatedly, killing him. Harris then walked back {{over to the other side}} of the table where Lauren Townsend lay dead. Behind the table, a 16-year-old girl named Kelly Fleming had, like Bree Pasquale, sat next to the table rather than beneath it due to a lack of space. Harris shot Fleming with his shotgun, hitting her in the back and killing her instantly. He shot at the table behind Fleming, hitting Townsend and Kreutz again, and wounding 18-year-old Jeanna Park. An autopsy later revealed that Townsend died from the earlier gunshots inflicted by Klebold.|$|E
2500|$|At this point, several {{witnesses}} {{later said}} they heard Harris and Klebold comment {{that they no}} longer found a thrill in shooting their victims. Klebold was quoted as saying, [...] "Maybe we should start knifing people, that might be more fun." [...] (Both youths were equipped with knives.) They moved <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and went toward the library's main counter. Harris threw a Molotov cocktail toward the southwestern end of the library, but it failed to explode. Harris went around {{the east side of the}} counter and Klebold joined him from the west; they converged close to where Todd had moved after having been wounded. Harris and Klebold mocked Todd, who was wearing a white hat. When the shooters demanded to see his face, Todd partly lifted his hat so his face would remain obscured. When Klebold asked Todd to give him one reason why he should not kill him, Todd said: [...] "I don't want trouble." [...] Klebold said, [...] "You [...] used to call me a fag. Who's a fag now?!" [...] The shooters continued to taunt Todd and debated killing him, but they eventually walked away.|$|E

50|$|Later, the White Witch herself {{arrives at}} <b>the</b> Stone <b>Table,</b> {{demanding}} that Edmund {{be given to}} her, as all traitors in Narnia belong to her. Aslan discusses the matter in private with the Witch, then announces to all that Edmund will be spared, but the camp has to be moved <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Stone <b>Table</b> before nightfall.|$|R
6000|$|At {{last the}} day of her {{adventure}} arrived, and as soon as she could get <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> breakfast <b>table</b> Twinkle ran out to the tub. There was her fairy turtle, safe as could be, and as she leaned over the tub he put out his head and called [...] "Good morning!" [...] in his small, shrill voice.|$|R
50|$|Later, the White Witch herself {{arrives at}} <b>the</b> Stone <b>Table,</b> {{demanding}} that Edmund {{be given to}} her, as all traitors in Narnia belong to her.

60|$|LESBIA. Good morning, Collins. How {{well you}} are looking! And how young! [She turns the middle chair <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and sits down].|$|E
60|$|Miss Panney now sat down, and La Fleur, {{pushing her}} chair a little <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> availed herself of the {{permission}} to do likewise.|$|E
60|$|The Chemist {{pushed his}} plate <b>away,</b> and, rising <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> walked across <b>the</b> room {{to where the}} old man stood looking at a little sprig of holly in his hand.|$|R
25|$|A {{recurring}} {{issue in}} Northwest's history was its troubled labor relations. In 1998, Northwest walked <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bargaining <b>table,</b> locked out its pilots (represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, International) {{and shut down}} the airline {{for more than two}} weeks. The airline sustained heavy losses as a result, and ended 1998 in the red, after being profitable since 1993.|$|R
50|$|Following 2005, {{negotiations}} {{between the two parties}} aiming at the long-term resolution of the tensions and a power-sharing accord took place, but they suffered repeated setbacks. The most notable of these took place in April 2008, when <b>the</b> CUF walked <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> negotiating <b>table</b> following a CCM call for a referendum to approve of what had been presented as a done deal on the power-sharing agreement.|$|R
60|$|Allen turned <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> As {{he did so}} he came face to {{face with}} Hal. He started back, and gave the youth a keen look.|$|E
6000|$|... "John," [...] {{said his}} mother, drawing her chair {{somewhat}} <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> [...] "if you flurry {{me in this}} way, you will drive {{me out of the}} room." ...|$|E
60|$|She blushed again, {{dropped her}} eyes, replied to his {{significant}} thanks {{with a few}} indistinct words, and drew <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> with a sudden timidity that was half confession.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s the US {{recreational}} diving community {{tended to}} move <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> US Navy <b>tables</b> {{to a range}} of tables published by other organisations, including several of the diver certification agencies (BSAC, NAUI, PADI).|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1990s {{the story was}} relaunched in a self-published {{full-sized}} comic. There were also two [...] "special issues": a shorter 99 cent special and a [...] "flip book" [...] with Amy Unbounded by Rachel Hartman. The first six issues were collected in a graphic novel, Galaxion: The Graphic Novel Volume One. This second version of Galaxion made it to eleven full issues but ceased publication in 1999 as the demands of parenthood pulled Tara <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> drawing <b>table.</b>|$|R
50|$|The main {{stars of}} the strip were four stuffed animals. Mossfoot, the adventurous green teddy bear, is leader and Game Master for the group. Violet, the violet and {{sometimes}} violent teddy bear, is Mossfoot's girlfriend. The others stars are Target, the black cat who hates LARPs (Live Action Role-Playing), and Ben Bunny, who speaks with a Scottish accent that occasionally slips into Jamaican. Collectively they call their role-playing group the Fuzzy Knights and they have had several adventures <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> gaming <b>table.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "'Which charge shall I take first, Harry?' he asked, {{turning his}} chair <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> and {{crossing}} his legs as if {{ready for a}} talk. 'You are jealous, as I gather, about the Marquis?' ...|$|E
60|$|The maître d'hôtel departed, but for {{the next}} hour or so his eyes were seldom far <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> where sat his most esteemed client. Once or twice, others of the diners sent for him.|$|E
60|$|Somebody else {{got hold}} of Charnock. He was dragged back, hustled <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> and towards the door. Then the bar was torn from his hands and a man pushed {{him out in the}} snow.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Just wait while I put five francs on number eight,' {{said the}} aunt, {{and in another}} moment her money was lying on <b>the</b> <b>table.</b> <b>The</b> horses {{commenced}} to move round, it was a slow race this time, and number eight crept up at the finish like some crafty demon and placed his nose just a fraction in front of number three, who had seemed to be winning easily. Recourse had to be had to measurement, and the number eight was proclaimed the winner. The aunt picked up thirty-five francs. After that the Brimley Bomefields {{would have had to}} have used concerted force to get her <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>tables.</b> When Roger appeared on the scene she was fifty-two francs to the good; her nieces were hovering forlornly in the background, like chickens that have been hatched out by a duck and are despairingly watching their parent disporting herself in a dangerous and uncongenial element. The supper-party which Roger insisted on standing that night in honour of his aunt and the three Miss Brimley Bomefields was remarkable for the unrestrained gaiety of two of the participants and the funereal mirthlessness of the remaining guests.|$|R
60|$|She {{threw her}} lapful of flowers <b>away</b> <b>from</b> her on <b>the</b> <b>table</b> at {{which she was}} sitting. She became {{perfectly}} furious with him for taking my side. I permitted myself (the poor child could not see it, remember), the harmless indulgence of a smile.|$|R
2500|$|International Harvester's {{behavior}} at and <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bargaining <b>table,</b> coupled with <b>the</b> company's exceedingly positive economic news, hardened the UAW's bargaining position. [...] On September 14, 1979, the UAW {{said it would}} strike all heavy-equipment manufacturers it was negotiating with if new collective bargaining agreements were not reached. The UAW's contract at International Harvester expired on October 1, 1979. But despite the union's more rigid stands, a council of all 51 IH local unions agreed to extend the contract {{on a day-to-day basis}} as negotiations continued.—a decision opposed by the international union.|$|R
