40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the eye {{movement}} depending on putting distance and accuracy in golf putting. The subjects were semi-professional 5 golfers. Golfers had performed golf putting on 2 m and 15 m distances. Visual search had used in order to examine the eye movement in success and failure of putting by eye tracker (Dikablis 2. 0). During golf putting, eye movement analysis had analyzed on the ball and the hole of putting distance and accuracy. Data were analyzed with analysis of variance for repeated measures using SPSS ver. 15. 0 program. Visual search to distance and accuracy on ball were as followed.

5|$|Doxorubicin is {{also known}} to be fluorescent. This has often been used to {{characterize}} doxorubicin concentrations, and has opened {{the possibility of using}} the molecule as a theranostic agent. However, there <b>are</b> <b>significant</b> limitations, as doxorubicin's fluorescence spectrum is known to depend on a variety of factors, including the pH of the environment, solvent dielectric constant and others. Doxorubicin fluorescence is quenched by binding to DNA, and shielded by micelle encapsulation. It {{is also known}} to self-quench at high concentrations. In contrast, histone binding amplifies fluorescence.|$|E

Schlumbergera species, such as S. truncata, have flowers that correspond closely to this syndrome. Other hummingbird-pollinated genera include Cleistocactus and Disocactus.|$|E

5|$|Orangutan {{hands are}} similar to human hands; they have four long fingers and an opposable thumb. However, the joint and tendon {{arrangement}} in the orangutans' hands produces two adaptations that <b>are</b> <b>significant</b> for arboreal locomotion.

Additionally, {{without the use of}} the thumb, the fingers and hands can grip tightly around objects with a small diameter by resting the tops of the fingers against the inside of the palm, creating a double-locked grip.|$|E
