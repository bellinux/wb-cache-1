50|$|Bird Machine Company {{can trace}} its origin to a {{partnership}} established by Charles Sumner Bird {{in the early}} 1900s. The first product, the BIRD Rotary Paper Screen, was a major contribution in the advancement for stock cleaning in paper mills. The Company was incorporated in 1909. Bird soon expanded to a broad line of equipment for stock preparation and cleaning in the pulp and paper industry, as well as significant <b>accessory</b> <b>equipment</b> used in the making and finishing of paper and paperboard.|$|E
50|$|Home audio {{systems are}} audio {{electronics}} intended for home entertainment use, such as shelf stereos and surround sound receivers. Home audio generally {{does not include}} standard equipment such as built-in television speakers, but rather <b>accessory</b> <b>equipment,</b> which may be intended to enhance or replace standard equipment, such as standard TV speakers. Since surround sound receivers, which are primarily intended to enhance the reproduction of a movie, {{are the most popular}} home audio device, the primary field of home audio is home cinema.|$|E

50|$|A {{constant}} speed drive (CSD) is a mechanical gearbox that takes {{an input shaft}} rotating at {{a wide range of}} speeds, delivering this power to an output shaft that rotates at a {{constant speed}}, despite the varying input. They are used to drive mechanisms, typically electrical generators, that require a constant input speed. Constant speed drives are usually found as part of the accessory drives of gas turbine engines, such as aircraft jet engines. Constant-speed drives are usually found supplying <b>accessory</b> <b>equipment</b> and are rarely needed for an engine's main power output.|$|E
5000|$|A typical amine gas {{treating}} process (the Girbotol process, {{as shown in}} the flow diagram below) includes an absorber unit and a regenerator unit as well as <b>accessory</b> <b>equipment.</b> In the absorber, the downflowing amine solution absorbs H2S and CO2 from the upflowing sour gas to produce a sweetened gas stream (i.e., a gas free of hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide) as a product and an amine solution rich in the absorbed acid gases. The resultant [...] "rich" [...] amine is then routed into the regenerator (a stripper with a reboiler) to produce regenerated or [...] "lean" [...] amine that is recycled for reuse in the absorber. The stripped overhead gas from the regenerator is concentrated H2S and CO2.|$|E
50|$|Thousands {{of items}} that were {{traditionally}} not computer-related include microprocessors. These include large and small household appliances, cars (and their <b>accessory</b> <b>equipment</b> units), car keys, tools and test instruments, toys, light switches/dimmers and electrical circuit breakers, smoke alarms, battery packs, and hi-fi audio/visual components (from DVD players to phonograph turntables). Such products as cellular telephones, DVD video system and HDTV broadcast systems fundamentally require consumer devices with powerful, low-cost, microprocessors. Increasingly stringent pollution control standards effectively require automobile manufacturers to use microprocessor engine management systems, to allow optimal control of emissions over widely varying operating conditions of an automobile. Non-programmable controls would require complex, bulky, or costly implementation to achieve the results possible with a microprocessor.|$|E

40|$|Objective: This study {{evaluated}} {{our results}} with ureteroscopic lithotripsy (URS) {{in patients with}} failed {{extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy}} therapy (ESWL) and examined the effect of previous ESWL on the use of tools during URS, operating time, and outcome. Materials and methods: URS performed in two centers between 2008 and 2011 was reviewed retrospectively. The patients were divided into two groups according to the history of previous ESWL: 1) patients who underwent ESWL previously (n= 39) and 2) no previous ESWL (n= 116). Results: The demographic data were similar in both groups. The use of accessory tools and treatment failure was statistically higher in Group 1. The operating time was longer in Group 1. The need for re-operation, balloon dilatation, and ureteral catheter was similar in the two groups. However, the use of <b>accessory</b> <b>equipment</b> was increased by 56 % in those with a previous ESWL. Balloon dilatation was required in 17. 9 % of the patients in Group 1. Conclusion: URS is the main treatment modality after the failure of ESWL. In patients with a history of ESWL, the need for <b>accessory</b> <b>equipment</b> is increased...|$|E

During laparoscopic surgery, there is two-dimensional vision and a loss of depth perception to some extent, as well as a fulcrum effect with tremor enhancement. There are only four degrees of freedom, and the major limitation is that the view is not {{under the control of the}} surgeon.|$|E

30|$|The {{self-contained}} {{oil filling}} cable uses a very mature technique and its rated voltage level can reach 800 kV. The cable {{is filled with}} low viscosity cable oil and tits insulating paper is made from brown paper of coniferous wood pulp. When the cable is damaged due to the external force resulting in oil leakage, it is unnecessary to stop the operation {{to deal with the}} leakage immediately. The cables can keep normal operation by adding oil form the oil compensating equipment. But form the environment point of view, the cable oil leakage will cause environmental pollution, especially the pollution caused by the seabed cables to the marine environment. The oil filling cable needs fuel tanks and other <b>accessory</b> <b>equipment,</b> so the workload of its operation and maintenance is large and the cost is also high.|$|E
