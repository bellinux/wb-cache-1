5|$|Blitzball is a minigame that {{requires}} strategy and tactics. The underwater sport is {{played in a}} large, hovering sphere of water surrounded by a larger audience of onlookers. The player controls one character at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> they swim through the sphere performing passes, tackles, and attempts to score. The gameplay {{is similar to that}} of the main game in the way that the controlled character moves through the area until they encounter an enemy. In this case, the enemy is a member of the opposing team. Status effects are also implemented in the minigame as each player can learn techniques that are equivalent to abilities in the main game.|$|E

5|$|Despite this outburst, {{the studio}} liked him, and before his three-week {{contract}} was up—while {{the film was}} still shooting—they gave Cagney a three-week extension, which {{was followed by a}} full seven-year contract at $400 a week. The contract, however, allowed Warners to drop him at the end of any 40-week period, effectively only guaranteeing him 40 weeks income at <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> <b>As</b> when he was growing up, Cagney shared his income with his family. Cagney received good reviews, and immediately starred in another gangster role in The Doorway to Hell. The film was a financial hit, helping cement Cagney's growing reputation. He made four more movies before his breakthrough role.|$|E

5|$|Shark {{teeth are}} {{embedded}} in the gums rather than directly affixed to the jaw, and are constantly replaced throughout life.

The rate of tooth replacement varies from once every 8 to 10 days to several months. In most species, teeth are replaced one at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>as</b> opposed to the simultaneous replacement of an entire row, which is observed in the cookiecutter shark.|$|E
