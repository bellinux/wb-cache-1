50|$|Resinated wine {{is a type}} of wine which derives part of its flavor from {{exposure}} to tree resins, most generally pine resin. Prior to the widespread use of barrels in Europe, wine was stored in amphorae, often sealed with <b>Aleppo</b> <b>pine</b> <b>resin.</b> Wines thus sealed were flavored by the resin, and over time this became a feature of the wine itself rather than an unwanted side effect.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to Attica, the grape {{is also found}} in Euboea and the Bulgarian town of Pomorie which used to be a Greek colony known as Anchialos. While Assyrtiko is the most commonly blending partner for Savatiano in Attica, Rhoditis is used most commonly on Euboea and Pomorie. In Kantza, a village east of Paiania, a single varietal style of Savatiano is made without the <b>Aleppo</b> <b>pine</b> <b>resin</b> found in Retsina.|$|E
50|$|Retsina (Ρετσίνα) is a Greek white (or rosé) resinated wine, {{which has}} been made for at least 2000 years. Its unique flavor {{is said to have}} {{originated}} from the practice of sealing wine vessels, particularly amphorae, with <b>Aleppo</b> <b>Pine</b> <b>resin</b> in ancient times. Before the invention of impermeable glass bottles, oxygen caused many wines to spoil within the year. Pine resin helped keep air out, {{while at the same time}} infusing the wine with resin aroma. The Romans began to use barrels in the 3rd century AD, removing any oenological necessity for resin, but the flavor itself was so popular that the style is still widespread today.|$|E

5000|$|Today the {{traditional}} grape for Retsina is Savatiano with Assyrtiko and Rhoditis sometimes blended in, {{as well as}} other grape varieties throughout Greece. On the island of Rhodes, Athiri is the main grape. Modern Retsina is made following the same winemaking techniques of white wine or rosé with the exception of small pieces of <b>Aleppo</b> <b>pine</b> <b>resin</b> added to the must during fermentation. The pieces stay mixed with the must, and elute an oily resin film on the liquid surface; at racking the wine is clarified and the solids and surface film are removed from the finished wine. [...] Nowadays, protecting the new wine from oxidation is easy to do with far simpler means and much less resin is used than traditionally called for. Such wines lack the pungent [...] "whiff of turpentine" [...] streak of old, and are considered ideal accompaniments to such strong-tasting local cuisine as pastırma or garlic dips, which are often consumed as mezes with alcoholic beverages.|$|E
40|$|<b>Aleppo</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus halepensis Mill.) is {{the most}} widely {{disturbed}} conifer tree in native forest and plantations throughout the Adriatic coast of Montenegro. However, pathogenic fungi {{in the region are}} extremely diversified and constitute the principal threat to healthy tree growth: 15 pathogenic fungal species have beden identified in the Eumediterranean zone - a typical habitat of <b>Aleppo</b> <b>pine,</b> whereas 21 fungal pathogens occurred in northern Submediterranean zone - an atypical habitat for <b>Aleppo</b> <b>pine</b> in Montenegro.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the pyric environment that influences the crown fire initiation and spread in <b>Aleppo</b> <b>pine</b> forests in Greece. Regression equations that predict the canopy fuel load by diameter class were developed for <b>Aleppo</b> <b>pine</b> in northern Evia, Greece. The log/log transformation of the allometric model y=axb gave the best fit for all crown fuel components except the branches with diameter > 7. 5 cm. The R 2 values were between 0. 82 and 0. 88 and SEE were small. Forty <b>Aleppo</b> <b>pine</b> trees were classified into groups according to their expected available canopy fuel load, by applying multivariate statistical methods (Hierarchical Cluster Analysis and Canonical Discriminant Analysis) on the values of their most significant dendrometric characteristics (diameter at breast height, total height, live crown length, crown width). Inventory of the critical canopy fuel characteristics that influence the initiation and spread of crown fires was conducted in representative <b>Aleppo</b> <b>pine</b> stands in the Kassandra peninsula, Greece. Vertical profiles of available canopy fuel load, canopy base height and canopy bulk density are presented. <b>Aleppo</b> <b>pine</b> crown fuel complexes are characterized by low canopy base height, while available canopy fuel load and canopy bulk density values are similar with other conifer fuel types worldwide. Crown fire behavior (probability of crown fire initiation, fire type, crown fire rate of spread, fireline intensity and flame length) in <b>Aleppo</b> <b>pine</b> stands with various surface fuel types and under various meteorological conditions, was simulated with modern and field-tested models of crown fire prediction. The simulation results indicated that crown fires in <b>Aleppo</b> <b>pines</b> forests cover a wide range of expected fire behavior. The probability of crown fire initiation was found high and passive crown fires and high intensity active crown fires were observed in uneven aged and even aged stands, respectively. Assessment of potential crown fire behavior is required in regional fire management planning and suppression tactics. Nomographs for the calculation of the pyric parameters (probability of crown fire initiation, active crown fire rate of spread, fireline intensity and flame length) of crown fires burning in the <b>Aleppo</b> <b>pines</b> stands in Greece were created. Fuel complexes typical of <b>Aleppo</b> <b>pine</b> forests were comprised and used as inputs to recent models of crown fire prediction, in order to calculate the pyric parameters under a wide range of environmental conditions. The results are considered as realistic, based on common experience of crown fire behavior in conifer forests, worldwide. Such nomographs are presented for the first time in Greece and are expected to offer substantial help to fire management practice. Fuel treatments that affect crown fire behavior in <b>Aleppo</b> <b>pine</b> stands were simulated under extreme and normal fuel moisture conditions. Treatments were simulated by adjusting surface fuels (total load, load-by-size class, depth) and canopy fuels (available canopy fuel load, canopy base height, canopy bulk density). Under typical conditions, stand thinning followed by prescribed burning and/or controlled grazing with slash removal avert crown fire initiation in most cases. Restoration of <b>Aleppo</b> <b>pines</b> ecosystems must include an analysis of how proposed treatments affect fuel structures. Fuel treatments must be incorporated in the forest management plan of <b>Aleppo</b> <b>pine</b> forests in Greece. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of drought {{resistance in the}} seedlings of <b>Aleppo</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus halepensis) and Brutia pine (Pinus brutia) was investigated. Both species showed anatomical and morphological adaptations to conserve moisture. <b>Aleppo</b> <b>pine</b> had a thicker cuticle, fewer stomata per unit length, per unit area, and per needle than Brutia pine. A significant number of <b>Aleppo</b> <b>pine</b> stomata were sealed with a waxy layer. Brutia pine had shorter needles, smaller needle surface area, a smaller surface area-to-volume ratio, and longer main root length. The two species were similar in height growth and in the seasonal trend of total non-structural carbohydrates (reducing sugars and starch). Brutia pine had more reducing sugars and less starch in its shoots than <b>Aleppo</b> <b>pine.</b> The latter had a greater amount of total non-structural carbohydrates and starch when the seedlings were subjected to dry down moisture stress. Electron microscopy techniques were used to monitor ultrastructural changes in the chloroplasts of mesophyll cells. <b>Aleppo</b> <b>pine</b> was found to contain chloroplasts exhibiting water stress-related damage at a relative water content of 62 percent, where as Brutia pine chloroplasts were disrupted.

40|$|We {{analysed}} {{the physiological}} bases that explain why large and high nitrogen (N) concentration seedlings frequently have improved survival and growth relative to small seedlings in Mediterranean woodland plantations. Large seedlings of <b>Aleppo</b> <b>pine</b> (Pinus halepensis Mill.) and holm oak (Quercus ilex L) with high N concentration (L+), and small seedlings with either high (S+) or low (S-) N concentration, were planted on two sites of different weed competition intensity that created contrasting stress conditions. Seedling survival, growth, gas exchange, N remobilization (N(R)) and uptake (N(U)), and water potential were assessed {{through the first}} growing season. Weeds reduced survival and growth, but seedling response to weed competition varied among phenotypes and between species. At {{the end of the}} first growing season, L+ <b>Aleppo</b> <b>pine</b> seedlings had higher survival than both small seedling types in presence of weeds but no differences were observed in absence of weeds. Mortality differences among phenotypes occurred in spring but not in summer. L+ <b>Aleppo</b> <b>pines</b> grew more than small <b>Aleppo</b> <b>pines</b> independently of weed competition. No holm oak seedling type survived in presence of weeds and no mortality differences among phenotypes where observed in absence of weeds, although L+ holm oak seedlings grew more than small seedlings. Mortality and growth differences in <b>Aleppo</b> <b>pine</b> were linked to marked physiological differences among phenotypes while physiological differences were small among holm oak phenotypes. L+ <b>Aleppo</b> <b>pines</b> had greater root growth, gas exchange. N(R), and N(U) than small seedlings, irrespective of their N concentration. Seedling size in <b>Aleppo</b> <b>pine</b> had a greater role in the performance of transplanted seedlings than N concentration. The functional differences among oak phenotypes were small whereas they were large in pine seedlings, which led to smaller differences in transplanting performance in holm oak than in pine. This suggests that the nursery seedling quality improvement for planting in dry sites could depend on the species-specific phenotypic plasticity and functional strategy. Improved transplanting performance in large <b>Aleppo</b> <b>pine</b> seedlings relative to small seedlings was linked to greater gas exchange, root growth and N cycling. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.

In this study, only one bacterium was isolated from <b>Aleppo</b> <b>pine</b> knots, and this bacterium was constantly associated with the pine weevil Pissodes castaneus. The hyperplastic growth started either in the cortex or in the xylem, while the knot was formed in the cortical parenchyma.

40|$|Abstract: It {{was widely}} {{accepted}} that, in the past, forests of <b>Aleppo</b> <b>pine,</b> Pinus halepensis (‘Jerusalem pine’ in Hebrew), were common in Israel-Palestine and covered vast areas of its mountains. However, an interdisci-plinary research project, using botanical, historical and geographical evidence, shows a different picture. The pine is mentioned {{only once in}} the Bible, and rarely in other religious sources. Descriptions of pine forests, or even isolated stands, by pilgrims and travellers who visited the Holy Land up to and during the nineteenth century, are rare. Palynological investigations in the area do not reveal any significant amounts of pine pollen except for the twentieth century. Investigations of wood remains from archaeological excavations show that <b>Aleppo</b> <b>pine</b> was rather rare, and constituted only a minute percentage of the wood assemblage. It can therefore be assumed quite safely that the <b>Aleppo</b> <b>pine,</b> which covered in the 1980 s about 50 % of the planted forests of Israel, was rare in the native arboreal vegetation of Israel in the past...|$|R
