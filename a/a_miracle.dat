5|$|A {{story is}} told of <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> that {{occurred}} {{more than a hundred}} years after his death.|$|E
5|$|Ancient {{and medieval}} Christian writers treated this as <b>a</b> <b>miracle,</b> and {{believed}} {{it to be}} one of the few episodes from the New Testament which were confirmed by non-Christian sources; modern scholars, however, have found no contemporary references to it outside the New Testament.|$|E
5|$|If {{consciousness}} (the mind) {{can exist}} independently of physical reality (the brain), one must explain how physical memories are created concerning consciousness. Dualism must therefore explain how consciousness affects physical reality. One {{possible explanation is}} that of <b>a</b> <b>miracle,</b> proposed by Arnold Geulincx and Nicolas Malebranche, where all mind–body interactions require the direct intervention of God.|$|E

5|$|In the {{following}} months, Fox received multiple chemotherapy treatments; however, the disease continued to spread. As his condition worsened, Canadians hoped for <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> and Pope John Paul II sent a telegram {{saying that he}} was praying for Fox. Doctors turned to experimental interferon treatments, though their effectiveness against osteogenic sarcoma was unknown. He suffered an adverse reaction to his first treatment, but continued the program after a period of rest.|$|E
5|$|Non-Christian {{sources are}} {{valuable}} in two ways. First, {{they show that}} even neutral or hostile parties never evince any doubt that Jesus actually existed. Second, they present a rough picture of Jesus that is compatible with that found in the Christian sources: that Jesus was a teacher, {{had a reputation as}} <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> worker, had a brother James, and died a violent death.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} thieves stole, {{on a summer}} day, horses {{that belonged to the}} Monastery of StJovan Vladimir. When they came to the nearby stream of Kusha to take the horses across, it {{appeared}} to them like an enormous river. They moved away from it in fear, but when they looked back from a distance, the stream appeared small. As they approached it again, the Kusha again became huge and impassable. After several such attempts to cross the stream, the thieves realized that this was <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> of the saint, so they released the monastery's horses and ran away in horror.|$|E

5|$|Cynesige perhaps {{came from}} Rutland, as {{he owned the}} manor of Tinwell there later in life. The Liber Eliensis claimed {{that he had been}} born by Caesarian section, but this is most likely a later {{accretion}} to his lifestory, added after his death because of efforts to have him declared a saint. The belief was that for an infant to survive a caesarian section was <b>a</b> <b>miracle,</b> and thus a fitting beginning for a future saint.|$|E
5|$|Even though Sava's {{diplomacy}} was of {{no effect}} either, Strez died the night after Sava's departure. Serbian sources present the death of Strez as <b>a</b> <b>miracle,</b> Strez being stabbed by an angel, though in reality he was very likely murdered in a plot orchestrated by Sava. Historian John V. A. Fine theorizes that Sava may have found supporters among Strez's nobles, {{some of whom had}} turned against him and organized his murder, only to defect to Serbia immediately afterwards. According to the hagiography of Saint Sava, in his dying words Strez claimed he was stabbed by a young soldier on the order of Sava.|$|E
5|$|Following {{two decades}} of uneasy peace, Britain and France {{declared}} war against one another in 1689. Despite the 1669 Treaty of Whitehall, in which European forces agreed that Continental conflicts would not disrupt colonial peace and neutrality, the war was fought primarily by proxy in New France and New England. The British of New York prompted local Iroquois warriors to attack New France's undefended settlements. While the British were preparing to engage in acts of warfare, the inhabitants of New France were ill-prepared to defend against the Indian attacks” due to {{the isolation of the}} farms and villages. Denonville was quoted as saying “If we have a war, nothing can save the country but <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> of God,”.|$|E

5|$|His {{place in}} the genealogical {{tradition}} of the MacDonalds is the only reason for believing in his existence, a genealogical tradition that not all historians have accepted. Beyond his actual existence, there is little that is certain. Three entries in Irish annals may discuss him, though he is never named; a praise poem surviving from the Early Modern period may be descended from a poem originally written for him; <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> in a Manx chronicle {{may or may not}} have Domhnall as its subject; and a doubtful charter surviving from a similarly late era was allegedly issued by him.|$|E
5|$|In John, Mary {{is alone}} at first, but Peter and the beloved disciple {{come and see}} the tomb as well. Jesus then appears to Mary at the tomb. He later appears to the disciples, {{breathes}} on them, and gives them the power to forgive and retain sins. In a second visit to disciples, he proves to a doubting disciple ("Doubting Thomas") that he is flesh and blood. The disciples return to Galilee, where Jesus makes another appearance. He performs <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> known as the catch of 153 fish at the Sea of Galilee, after which Jesus encourages Peter to serve his followers.|$|E

However, Kevin's mother, hurt by Gates, runs the car into a ditch, dying as a result. Scully tells Kevin she'll protect him. They bring him to a hotel where Scully notices an additional wound on Kevin's side. Scully becomes upset at Mulder for his unwillingness to accept the possibility of <b>a</b> <b>miracle.</b> As they talk, Gates breaks into the bathroom, kidnapping Kevin by prying {{an opening in the}} barred window. Scully returns to see Kevin's father but finds him heavily drugged.|$|E

5|$|Ladislaus {{contracted}} {{an unidentified}} serious illness, but recovered from it. He attributed this recovery to <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> by his deceased saintly aunt, Margaret, {{and approached the}} Holy See to promote her canonization in 1275. In the same year, a new civil war broke out between Joachim Gutkeled and Peter Csák. Ladislaus took part in Csák's military expedition against the Kőszegis, who were Gutkeled's supporters. However, Gutkeled and his supporters removed their opponents from power at an assembly of the barons and noblemen at Buda around 21 June 1276.|$|E
5|$|On 10 February 1889, {{the town}} of Sibu was burnt to the ground. This has caused a {{developmental}} delay in Sibu. The first hospital in Sibu was built by the Brooke government in 1912. It was a wooden single-storey building measuring 50 to 60 feet long, with an outpatient department, male and female wards. On 8 March 1928, Sibu was again consumed by a great fire. However, the Tua Pek Kong Temple remained intact. The locals considered this <b>a</b> <b>miracle.</b>|$|E
5|$|The close {{relations}} with Byzantium, however, {{did not help}} Prince Vladimir. Samuel attacked Duklja in 1009 or 1010, {{as part of his}} campaign aimed at breaking up that pro-Byzantine bloc, which could have threatened him. Vladimir retreated with his army and many of his people to his fortress on a hill named Oblik, close to the southeastern tip of Lake Skadar. According to the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja, he performed <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> there: the hill was infested with venomous snakes, but when he offered up a prayer to the Lord, their bites became harmless.|$|E

5|$|A notable {{feature on}} the wall of the front porch on the ground floor is a foot print on a stone slab. It is said that this foot print belonged to a {{resident}} of the monastery, who was a water carrier, known as Chitenpa. He served in the monastery for a long time and on one fine day he announced that he had completed his service to the monastery and then stamped his left foot on the stone slab which created a dented formation of his step. This step is venerated as <b>a</b> <b>miracle</b> in view of a belief among the people of the region that such an imprint on a stone slab could only be created by a divine person who was a true devotee of the monastery.|$|E
5|$|After Gallagher's {{team had}} {{returned}} to the Special Forces Camp, Van Cleeff waited on the runway for two minutes to extract the survivors, but when nobody appeared he pulled the throttle and took off. As soon as Van Cleeff's aircraft was airborne, another C-130 pilot reported to General McLaughlin that the evacuation had been completed, and the facility could now be destroyed at will. Van Cleeff quickly notified all aircraft in the vicinity that he had just reinserted the CCT. Gallagher's team searched the Special Forces compound, the Americal Division battalion command post, and the artillery compound, but everybody either had been evacuated or was dead. Additionally, Khâm Đức was in North Vietnamese hands, so Gallagher and the other two men ran to the ditch beside the runway, where they tried to make contact with the aircraft overhead, but the radio was disabled along with all other equipment. While waiting for <b>a</b> <b>miracle,</b> members of the CCT clashed with North Vietnamese troops who had set up a machine gun position beneath the wing of Delmore's crashed C-130, and successfully disabled their opponent's weapon.|$|E

Magdalena's father apologizes to her at Tomas's funeral, believing her conception to be <b>a</b> <b>miracle,</b> and she forgives him.|$|E
