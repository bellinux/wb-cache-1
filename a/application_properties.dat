50|$|Chemometrics {{is applied}} to solve both {{descriptive}} and predictive problems in experimental natural sciences, especially in chemistry.

In both cases, the datasets can be small but are often very large and highly complex, involving hundreds to thousands of variables, and hundreds to thousands of cases or observations.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The <b>application</b> <b>property</b> and {{structural}} characteristics of bark lignosulfonate (LS) was studied. Results showed that bark LS had perfect <b>application</b> <b>property</b> in concrete. The fluidity of cement paste was 214 mm, which was 87. 0 % of commercial superplasticiser of naphthalene sulfonate; the loss on fluidity of cement paste of bark LS was very small, which {{was much better}} than that of naphthalene sulfonate. The loss on fluidity of cement paste of bark LS after 60 min was only 5. 6 %, but that of naphthalene sulfonate was 30. 6 %. Bark LS had low foaming capacity and high foam stability. Surface tension of 1 % bark LS solution was 48. 1 mN/m. Structural characteristics of bark LS was also studied. It showed that the reason that bark LS had good <b>application</b> <b>property</b> was that it had high content of hydrophilic sulfonic group, carboxyl group and phenolic hydroxyl group, and uniform molecular weight distribution...|$|R

50|$|Pigments offer great {{potential}} in modifying the <b>application</b> <b>properties</b> of a coating. Due to their fine particle size and inherently high surface energy, they often require a surface treatment {{in order to}} enhance their ease of dispersion in a liquid medium. A wide variety of surface treatments have been previously used, including the adsorption on the surface of a molecule in the presence of polar groups, monolayers of polymers, and layers of inorganic oxides on the surface of organic pigments.|$|E
50|$|The main {{purposes}} of the diluent are to dissolve the polymer and adjust the viscosity of the paint. It is volatile and does not {{become part of the}} paint film. It also controls flow and <b>application</b> <b>properties,</b> and in some cases can affect the stability of the paint while in liquid state. Its main function is as the carrier for the non volatile components. To spread heavier oils (for example, linseed) as in oil-based interior house paint, a thinner oil is required. These volatile substances impart their properties temporarily—once the solvent has evaporated, the remaining paint is fixed to the surface.|$|E
50|$|The {{primary use}} for {{poligeenan}} is for clinical diagnostic applications, and specifically {{the suspension of}} barium sulfate slurries used in X-ray studies of the mouth, throat, and esophagus during swallowing. For this application, poligeenan delivers three essential properties: First, its viscosity imparts lubricity to make the slurry easier to swallow. Second, this same viscosity is high enough to maintain full suspension of all barium sulfate particles during the complete X-ray procedure. Third, the high charge density of the poligeenan solution (ester sulfate units) prevents caking or aggregation of the barium sulfate particles during long-term storage of ready-to-use slurry products, these being easily reconstituted by shaking. The combination of these three <b>application</b> <b>properties</b> necessitates poligeenan to have molecular weights in the range 10-20 kDa.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{suggests}} that deposition paste area {{is one of}} those leading control indicators of mix proportion design for the macroporous ecological concrete without sand.

40|$|Desiccant {{composites}} {{were prepared}} from seven {{high impact polystyrene}} copolymers (HIPS) and two homopolymers (PS) to study the effect of structure and elastomer content on their functional and <b>application</b> <b>properties.</b> Composites containing an 4 A type zeolite up to 50 vol% were homogenized in an internal mixer and then compression molded to 1 mm thick plates. The water absorption capacity of the composites increases strongly with zeolite, but decreases slightly with increasing polybutadiene content. The overall rate of water adsorption decreases with increasing zeolite content and it is influenced quite significantly {{by the amount of}} elastomer as well. Zeolite and elastomer contents determine both functional and <b>application</b> <b>properties,</b> but structural parameters also play a role. The size of the dispersed butadiene droplets, the amount of PS embedded into them as well as the encapsulation of the zeolite into the droplets also influence all properties in smaller or larger extent...|$|E
