25|$|In June 2013, Gleeson {{made his}} {{comeback}} to basketball after signing a three-year deal {{to be the}} Head Coach of the Perth Wildcats – the NBL's most successful franchise with five championships. In the months prior to joining the Wildcats, Gleeson was inches from turning his back on basketball for good. Feeling refreshed after his AFL stint, but unsure of his coaching future long-term, the chance to join the Wildcats in 2013 came <b>at</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>time.</b> Gleeson took over from coach Rob Beveridge, who had developed a winning-culture at the Wildcats (one championship and three grand finals in four years) behind a core group consisting of Shawn Redhage, Damian Martin, Jesse Wagstaff, Matthew Knight and Greg Hire.|$|E
25|$|Australia dug {{themselves}} out of the hole, however, Michael Clarke and Michael Hussey slowly accumulating to increase the rate. England clearly lacked a fifth bowler, opting instead for Vikram Solanki to bat down the order, so they used a combination of Michael Vaughan, Solanki and Collingwood to get through their ten required overs. That let Australia off the hook, with Clarke and Hussey adding 105, before Jon Lewis – who had been taken to the cleaners earlier on – dug out Michael Clarke with an inside edge onto the stumps, taking the fifth wicket of the game <b>at</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>time.</b> Shane Watson accumulated well with Hussey, however, hitting six an over as Lewis was smashed about again, but Harmison got his revenge by completing his first five-wicket haul in ODIs as Hussey was beaten by a slower ball – the first time Hussey had been dismissed in One Day Internationals, for a batting average of 229. Then, Andrew Flintoff was brought back, getting a splendid yorker in for Watson, who was out for 25 just as the Aussies were preparing to hit out – the score 220 for 7 after 44.1 overs. Jason Gillespie and Brad Hogg survived a couple of overs from Flintoff and Harmison – meaning that Harmison finished with five for 33 off ten overs. Towards the end, Australia built up again, before losing Gillespie to a top edge, but 244 for 8 with seven balls remaining still looked difficult for England to chase. Gough dug out Michael Kasprowicz with a yorker with two balls to spare, and four legbyes ended the innings to take Australia to 252 for 9.|$|E

500|$|Voormann, a {{close friend}} of Harrison's since 1960, found the {{atmosphere}} at the sessions unpleasant; he later cited the heavy drug use typical of the LA music scene, in particular, but also the ex-Beatle's [...] "frame of mind when he was doing this album". Keltner, who described his own friendship with Harrison as [...] "like brothers", has similarly spoken of Los Angeles as an unsuitable environment for Harrison during this period, while commenting that Arias [...] "came into the picture <b>at</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>time,</b> a crazy, dark time". With Voormann choosing to absent himself, Harrison played some of the album's bass parts himself, using either ARP or Moog synthesizer.|$|E

2500|$|American {{teenagers}} of the mid-1950s, when James Dean's major {{films were}} made, identified with Dean and the roles he played, especially that of Jim Stark in Rebel Without a Cause. The film depicts {{the dilemma of}} a typical teenager of the time, who feels that no one, not even his peers, can understand him. Humphrey Bogart commented after Dean's death about his public image and legacy: [...] "Dean died <b>at</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>time.</b> He left behind a legend. If he had lived, he'd never {{have been able to}} live up to his publicity." ...|$|E

50|$|Hand after hand POTRIPPER’s play is {{consistent}} {{with that of a}} player who had knowledge of every player’s hole cards. The majority of hands show POTRIPPER bluffing <b>at</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> times when his opponents were weak. Yet, when he was hopelessly outmatched, even with good cards, he laid them down.|$|R
2500|$|On January 30, 1943, {{the second}} day of the Battle of Rennell Island, Feightner shot down three Mitsubishi G4M [...] "Betty" [...] torpedo bombers in a single engagement. In this engagement, a force of twelve [...] "Bettys" [...] {{approaching}} Enterprise were intercepted by VF-10 aircraft. The [...] "Betty"s turned away from Enterprise and went after , a heavy cruiser that had been disabled the night before. VF-10 destroyed six of the [...] "Betty"s before they could reach the cruiser, but the remaining aircraft released their torpedoes with devastating effectChicago sank within minutes. Two more of the [...] "Bettys" [...] were dispatched by the pursuing VF-10 Wildcats as they passed the ring of destroyers that had been protecting the cruiser. Flatley shot down another and the remaining three fell to his wingman, Feightner, who had been delayed due to a balky engine but arrived <b>at</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>time.</b> Feightner was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and an air medal for downing three aircraft on that day and ended his first combat tour with four confirmed kills.|$|E
2500|$|Within robotics, inverse {{dynamics}} algorithms {{are used}} to calculate the torques that a robot's motors must deliver to make the robot's end-point move in the way prescribed by its current task. The [...] "inverse dynamics problem" [...] in Robotics Engineering was solved by Eduardo Bayo in 1987. This solution calculates how each of the numerous electric motors that control a robot arm must move to produce a particular action. Humans can perform very complicated and precise movements, such as controlling the tip of a fishing rod well enough to cast the bait accurately. Before the arm moves, the brain calculates the necessary movement of each muscle involved and tells the muscles what to do as the arm swings. In the case of a robot arm, the [...] "muscles" [...] are the electric motors which must turn by a given amount at a given moment. Each motor must be supplied with {{just the right amount of}} electric current, <b>at</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>time.</b> Researchers can predict the motion of a robot arm if they know how the motors will move. This is known as the forward dynamics problem. Until this discovery, they had not been able to work backwards to calculate the movements of the motors required to generate a particular complicated motion., Bayo's work began with the application of frequency-domain methods to the inverse dynamics of single-link flexible robots. This approach yielded non-causal exact solutions due to the right-half plane zeros in the hub-torque-to-tip transfer functions. Extending this method to the nonlinear multi-flexible-link case was of particular importance to robotics. When combined with passive joint control in a collaborative effort with a control group, Bayo's inverse dynamics approach led to exponentially stable tip-tracking control for flexible multi-link robots.|$|E

60|$|Now, as {{the chief}} of these parties, he found himself the strongest power in the community. So he {{proceeded}} to his next move--a no less important one than the impeachment of the chief magistrate, James Russell Nickoy; a man of character and ability, and possessed of great wealth, he being {{the owner of a}} house with a parlor to it, three acres and a half of yam land, and the only boat in Pitcairn's, a whaleboat; and, most unfortunately, a pretext for this impeachment offered itself <b>at</b> <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
