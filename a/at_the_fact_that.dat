5|$|In 1932 Emmy Noether and Emil Artin {{received}} the Ackermann–Teubner Memorial Award {{for their contributions}} to mathematics. The prize carried a monetary reward of 500Reichsmarks and {{was seen as a}} long-overdue official recognition of her considerable work in the field. Nevertheless, her colleagues expressed frustration <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> she was not elected to the Göttingen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften (academy of sciences) and was never promoted to the position of Ordentlicher Professor (full professor).|$|E
5|$|In December 1990, the NHL held {{a meeting}} in Palm Beach, Florida, to {{consider}} expansion applications. The NHL executives were reportedly impressed by the Ottawa presentation, including Finnigan's participation, the several hundred fans and the marching band who traveled to Palm Beach, but apparently were more impressed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the group {{was one of the}} few applicants willing to pay the $50 million franchise fee without reservations. On December 6, 1990, the Terrace group was approved to purchase one of the two franchises (along with the Tampa Bay Lightning) to start play in the 1992–93 season.|$|E

5|$|With the win, Schilling became {{only the}} fifth pitcher to ever win a World Series {{game with a}} team from both leagues, having {{previously}} done it with National League teams, the Philadelphia Phillies in 1993, and the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2001. He later donated the bloody sock he wore during the game to the Baseball Hall of Fame museum. Much {{of the blame for}} the Cardinals' losses {{in the first two games}} was directed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Rolen, Edmonds and Reggie Sanders, three of the Cardinals' best batters, had combined for one hit in 22at-bats.|$|E
5|$|Alpha Flights Northstar, {{a member}} of the {{original}} Alpha Flight superhero team, was the first major gay character created by Marvel Comics. Creator John Byrne said that Northstar was planned to be gay from his inception in 1979. The character was finally revealed to be gay in 1992's Alpha Flight issue 106, the only comic book issue to have been inducted into the Gaylactic Hall of Fame. Storylines involving Northstar in Alpha Flight and his limited series have generally ignored his sexuality: Criticism has been levelled <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> in 30 years Northstar has never been shown kissing another man, though he finally kissed his boyfriend Kyle in the first issue of the 2011 relaunch of the series. Northstar eventually became {{a member of}} the X-Men. During his time in this team he became a mentor to gay teenage mutant Anole, who later became a Young X-Men member along with another gay teen, Graymalkin.|$|E

50|$|This {{seemed to}} be in line with <b>the</b> culture <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> devastation in Germany was so great made it easy to {{consider}} Germany ‘new’.

50|$|The case {{also created}} anger among many Egyptians who sympathized with Nasser {{because of the}} general anti-Israeli {{sentiment}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> he was <b>the</b> son of Gamal Abdel Nasser, a popular figure in the country, and reports that the evidence was provided by American intelligence.

5|$|Regional {{conflicts}} with the Order escalated. Alexander Nevsky of Novgorod, Tautvilas, and Tautvilas's son Constantine agreed to form a coalition in opposition to Mindaugas, but their plans were unsuccessful. Treniota emerged {{as the leader of}} the Samogitian resistance; he led an army to Cēsis (now in Latvia), reaching the Estonian coast, and battled Masovia (now in Poland). His goal was to encourage all the conquered Baltic tribes to rise up against the Christian orders and unite under Lithuanian leadership. His personal influence grew while Mindaugas was concentrating on the conquest of Ruthenian lands, dispatching a large army to Bryansk. Treniota and Mindaugas began to pursue different priorities. The Rhymed Chronicle mentions Mindaugas's displeasure <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Treniota did not create any alliances in Latvia or Estonia; he may have come to prefer diplomacy. In the midst of these events Mindaugas's wife Morta died, and he took her sister, Daumantas' wife, as his own. In retaliation, Daumantas and Treniota assassinated Mindaugas and two of his sons in fall 1263. According to a late medieval tradition, the assassination took place in Aglona. He was buried along with his horses, in accordance with ancestral tradition. After Mindaugas's death, Lithuania lapsed into internal disorder. Three of his successors—Treniota, his son-in-law Svarn, and his son Vaišvilkas—were assassinated during the next seven years. Stability did not return until the reign of Traidenis, designated Grand Duke c. 1270.|$|E
5|$|Sky Sports {{said that}} during the 2011–12 season McLean had begun to emerge {{as one of the}} top young talents in the SPL. His first game of the season was on 6 August, in a 1–1 draw against Dundee United, where he came on as an 80th-minute substitute. His first start came a week later in a 1–0 loss to Motherwell. McLean then played {{regularly}} in the first team over the next few months and was in excellent form. He scored his first senior goal in a 1–0 win over St Johnstone on 29 October and was rewarded with the SPL Young Player of the Month award for October 2011. After this, team-mate Gary Teale said that he thought McLean was very similar to former Rangers and Scotland captain Barry Ferguson, and that he thought McLean would have a brilliant future in the game. In the weeks leading up to his award, McLean had been watched by English Championship clubs Burnley and Crystal Palace, with Celtic also reportedly interested in him. Lennon encouraged interest from other clubs, saying that he took it as a compliment to McLean's development. But he also said that he would not consider selling McLean in the near future and expressed his delight <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> he had already signed McLean on a long-term contract. On 19 November, McLean scored his second goal for St Mirren, in a 2–1 win over Dunfermline Athletic. He then scored St Mirren's first goal, on 10 December, as they came from behind to secure a 2–2 draw against Aberdeen. McLean was one of the four players nominated for the SPL young Player of the Year Award. In January 2014 it was announced that McLean would be out-of-action for 6 weeks following knee surgery.|$|E

50|$|In a warm {{alkaline}} solution acetaminosalol is broken up into salicylic acid and paracetamol. It is decomposed in the intestines, even when given as an injection. It {{was used as}} a substitute for salicylic acid in acute rheumatism, and as an intestinal antiseptic. It was similarly effective and much safer than salol, another intestinal antiseptic commonly used <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> it is tasteless renders it easy to administer.|$|R
25|$|Voltaire's {{critique}} concerns not {{the nature}} of the Pascalian wager as proof of God's existence, but the contention that the very belief Pascal tried to promote is not convincing.

25|$|On March 19 a {{demonstration}} in Times Square, New York City originally meant {{to protest the}} Iraq War turned into a protest against the military intervention in Libya. U. S.

Nearly 80 people attended the demonstration.|$|E
25|$|Though the {{practice}} of the prozbul is largely archaic, its institution has far reaching effects to this day, setting somewhat of a precedent in terms of legal fiction. The decision was groundbreaking and controversial. “Later Amoraim expressed their astonishment <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Hillel dared to abrogate the Mosaic institution of the release of all debts every seventh year”. There is a major debate in the Talmud whether rabbis have the authority to uproot from the Torah and the issue of prozbul {{is one of the first}} examples of this debate being tested.|$|E

Before the match started, Hardy and Triple H shook hands. During the match, Hardy seemed dazed after he {{suffered}} a series of clotheslines and shoulder blocks. Triple H tried to execute a Pedigree but Hardy countered it into a jackknife roll-up which won Jeff Hardy the match. As Jeff Hardy celebrated Triple H was smiling <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> he was pinned so easily, Triple H then celebrated with Hardy.|$|E
25|$|Minister of the Interior Otar Khetsia stated on 21 November that {{criminal}} cases had been opened {{by law enforcement}} agencies in Gagra and Aradu. He noted that Azhiba's car had stood along the road at a far distance from his home, and while he confirmed that fire had broken out, he cautioned that {{it was up to}} the investigation to establish whether the car had exploded or been set fire to. Khetsia also confirmed that a warehouse for kiwifruit had burned down in Aradu, and that everything would be done to find the perpetrators, but he expressed his surprise <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> reporters from Abaza TV (owned by Butba) had been at the crime scene before officers from the Ochamchira police department.|$|E
25|$|Fourier {{used the}} work of Laplace and Lagrange to solve the heat {{equation}} by separation of variables in his famous 1822 book Théorie analytique de la chaleur. Sturm developed Fourier's ideas further and {{brought them to the}} attention of Cauchy, who combined them with his own ideas and arrived <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> real symmetric matrices have real eigenvalues. This was extended by Hermite in 1855 to what are now called Hermitian matrices. Around the same time, Brioschi proved that the eigenvalues of orthogonal matrices lie on the unit circle, and Clebsch found the corresponding result for skew-symmetric matrices. Finally, Weierstrass clarified an important aspect in the stability theory started by Laplace by realizing that defective matrices can cause instability.|$|E

25|$|The {{reason of}} Pakistan's {{opposition}} to India's {{entry into the}} Organization of Islamic Cooperation {{is due to the}} human rights issues and problems faced by the Kashmiris in the Indian state of Jammu & Kashmir(J). The Muslim world has always supported Pakistan rather than India, however the role of the OIC concerning the Kashmir issue is that India has the largest Muslim minority and those people have shown desire to join the OIC. While the First Islamic Summit did not have the issue of the Kashmir people, granting the 60 million Muslims living in India membership in the OIC was discussed. While General Yayha Khan of Pakistan did agree, he showed his extreme displeasure <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> at induction of Muslim representative Fakhruddin Ali Ahmad, he took a seat, which caused major controversy. Meanwhile, there were Muslims killed in anti-Muslim riots in Ahmedabad. Pakistan rejected this development and demanded the expulsion of India from the summit.|$|E
25|$|Light's {{personality}} dramatically changes {{after he}} has a Death Note compared to when he does not. This can be seen when Light puts himself in L's captivity because he 'might be Kira'. Light tells Ryuk to relinquish his ownership of the Death Note after saying 'get rid of it'. Afterwards, Light loses all memory of the Death Note and he reverts to his normal personality. Without the Death Note, he has cares for {{the people around him}} and is reluctant to manipulate them. He even refuses to 'use' Misa Amane to get information out of her when L asks him to; however, later in the story, when Light regains his memories, he seems to have no problem 'using' Kiyomi Takada and manipulating her feelings in order to get what he wants. Despite serving Light faithfully, he repays her devotion with a painful death the moment she is no longer of use to him, expressing no emotion other than elation <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> her death has moved him closer to his goal.|$|E
50|$|Therefore, {{economic}} capital and cultural capital {{have the ability}} to influence the type of academic capital that one accrues both within schools and <b>at</b> home. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> people who gain most of their cultural capital in schools are considered to have more legitimate tastes and preferences makes it seem like they have more academic capital in some cases.|$|R
