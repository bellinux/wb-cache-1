5|$|The Palisades Interstate Parkway begins <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> Bridge (GWB) in Fort Lee, New Jersey. Passengers {{from the}} upper level of the GWB can {{directly}} get on the PIP northbound, while passengers from the lower level of the bridge must travel through GWB Plaza on US9W before getting on the parkway. Passengers riding northbound on the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95) must be in local lanes to directly get on the PIP. Once the PIP leaves the GWB, it proceeds north along the New Jersey Palisades, past the Englewood Cliffs Service Area. Unlike service areas further north along the parkway, there are two in Englewood, one for northbound drivers and one for southbound drivers. The others are in the center median shared by drivers going in both directions. There are also three different scenic lookout points over the Palisades near {{the northern tip of}} the island of Manhattan at the Harlem River. After this, the PIP parallels US9W and the Hudson River for its entire run in New Jersey. All four exits in New Jersey are either with US9W, or within mere feet of the route.
