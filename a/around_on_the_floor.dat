25|$|Very {{little is}} known about the biology of the species, since it was not {{recognized}} as a separate species until after it is believed to have become extinct. Edgar Stead visited Taukihepa/Big South Cape Island in 1936 and made several observations. He described the species as flying no more than “ten feet above the ground” and always after dusk. At one point he found seven bats roosting in a tree cavity in a state of torpor. After capturing a few and putting them in a cage they crawled <b>around</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> much like New Zealand lesser short-tailed bats are known to do. As well as roosting in tree cavities, it is known that they roosted in granite caves on Taukihepa/Big South Cape Island and Rerewhakaupoko/Solomon Island.|$|E
500|$|Jeff {{appeared}} at Kick Butts Day, a protest {{organized by the}} Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids and youth advocates, which was held outside Philip Morris' annual shareholders' meeting in New York City on May 6, 2015. The protests featured a flash mob with fifty dancers performing a choreographed dance to a song with the lyrics, [...] "We don't want your cigarettes. Jeff we can!" [...] The performance ended with the mascot: [...] "rolling <b>around</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> in a coughing fit and loss of breath". Shana Narula, the campaign's coordinator, said: The whole concept is to use Jeff and the hashtag #JeffWeCan and #StopMarlboro to show that these marketing tactics are not allowed and tobacco is still {{the leading cause of}} preventable disease and death in the world. And the fact is it's the only consumer product that when used as intended, it kills its user. This is very, very unique — no other consumer product does this. Most people think that tobacco is not really an issue in this country anymore and that's completely not true. That's what we want to shed light on today, in a fashion where people will take notice.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{generally}} {{favored the}} songs accompanying music video, in particular Scherzinger's intricate choreography. On {{the day the}} video premiered, a reviewer from Rap-Up wrote [...] "It’s getting hot in here," [...] referencing Scherzinger's [...] "smokin’ body" [...] and [...] "steamy visuals". Staff of Idolator spoke favorably of Scherzinger's choreography, stating that it [...] "would make the other Pussycat Dolls blush". Amy Sciarretto of PopCrush gave the video a positive review stating that she was impressed of Scherzinger's athletic and acrobatic methods of dancing. She continued, [...] "she doesn’t even {{have to try and}} be sexy; she just is". Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV Buzzworthy appreciated Scherzinger's writhing <b>around</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> in [...] "somewhat compromising positions" [...] and added that Scherzinger is wet for about 50 percent of the video, so [...] "we're guessing guys across the country aren't going to be writing complaint letters anytime soon." [...] Sophie Forbes of Daily Mail positively stated [...] "Clutching a net round her body, she looked sensational in her taupe two piece as she stared wistfully off into the distance." [...] David Griffiths of 4Music positively reviewed the song's music video stating it [...] "featur some jaw-droppingly good dancing, a hair flick or two and some serious thrusting, it gets a big thumbs up from us." [...] "Wet" [...] ranked at number 70 on MTV's most watched music videos of 2011.|$|E

500|$|The {{production}} {{moved to}} the United Kingdom and shot in a converted airship hangar in Cardington, Bedfordshire, north of London. There, the hotel bar set which tilted 30 degrees was built. A hotel corridor was also constructed by Guy Hendrix Dyas, the production designer, Chris Corbould, the special effects supervisor, and Wally Pfister, the director of photography; it rotated a full 360degrees to create the effect of alternate directions of gravity for scenes set during the second level of dreaming, where dream-sector physics become chaotic. The idea {{was inspired by a}} technique used in Stanley Kubrick's [...] (1968). Nolan said, [...] "I was interested in taking those ideas, techniques, and philosophies and applying them to an action scenario". The filmmakers originally planned to make the hallway only 40ft (12m) long, but as the action sequence became more elaborate, the hallway's length grew to 100ft (30m). The corridor was suspended along eight large concentric rings that were spaced equidistantly outside its walls and powered by two massive electric motors. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who plays Arthur, spent several weeks learning to fight in a corridor that spun like [...] "a giant hamster wheel". Nolan said of the device, [...] "It was like some incredible torture device; we thrashed Joseph for weeks, but in the end we looked at the footage, and it looks unlike anything any of us has seen before. The rhythm of it is unique, and when you watch it, even if you know how it was done, it confuses your perceptions. It's unsettling in a wonderful way". Gordon-Levitt remembered, [...] "it was six-day weeks of just, like, coming home at night battered ... The light fixtures on the ceiling are coming <b>around</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> and you have to choose the right time to cross through them, and if you don't, you're going to fall." [...] On July15,2009, filming took place at University College London for the sequences occurring inside a Paris college of architecture in the story, including the library, Flaxman Gallery and Gustav Tuck Theatre.|$|E
2500|$|During the Second World War, {{some new}} types of toys were created through {{accidental}} innovation. After {{trying to create a}} replacement for synthetic rubber, the American Earl L. Warrick inadvertently invented [...] "nutty putty" [...] during World War II. Later, Peter Hodgson recognized the potential as a childhood plaything and packaged it as Silly Putty. Similarly, Play-Doh was originally created as a wallpaper cleaner. In 1943 Richard James was experimenting with springs as part of his military research when he saw one come loose and fall to the floor. He was intrigued by the way it flopped <b>around</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> He spent two years fine-tuning the design to find the best gauge of steel and coil; the result was the Slinky, which went on to sell in stores throughout the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Draco is parodied as Jerko Phoenix in {{the series}} Wizards of Waverly Place, during the episodes [...] "Wizard School Part 1" [...] and [...] "Wizard School Part 2", in which Alex and Justin Russo go to a wizarding school named Wiz-tech, where {{everyone}} wears yellow and black robes, and glasses reminiscent of Harry Potter. Draco also appears as Sacco (played by Shane Lyons) in the Harry Bladder sketches in All That, in which Harry Bladder and other students often encounter Sacco's mischief-making. In the stage production Harry Potter and the Obnoxious Voice, Malfoy is seen interacting with Hagrid and a dementor. Draco was also parodied in a Big Bite sketch, where {{he was known as}} Mailboy (with his father Lucius being parodied as Mailman). In Neil Cicierega's Potter Puppet Pals, Draco stars in the episode [...] "Draco Puppet". He is different from all the other characters, simplistically made out of paper and is a smaller puppet, held and voiced by the Harry puppet. Harry created him in order to torture him, and after the puppet [...] "annoys" [...] Harry, he does a series of strange things to the paper Draco and eventually burns it on a stove. In A Very Potter Musical Draco is played by actress Lauren Lopez. He has a very obvious crush on Hermione and spends {{a great deal of time}} posing and rolling <b>around</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E

"A strong place, truly, {{and well}} chosen," [...] said Eric and looked <b>around.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> {{of the rock}} and some paces from him a turf fire still smouldered, and by it were sheep's bones, and beyond, {{in the face of}} the {{overhanging}} precipice, was the mouth of a cave.|$|E
60|$|Whenever the Wizard went {{to sleep}} {{he would take the}} nine tiny piglets from his pocket and let them run <b>around</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> of his room to amuse {{themselves}} and get some exercise; and one time they found his glass door ajar and wandered into the hall and then into the bottom part of the great dome, walking through the air as easily as Eureka could. They knew the kitten, by this time, so they scampered over to where she lay beside Jim and commenced to frisk and play with her.|$|E
6000|$|One {{of the red}} visitors--a wild, lean-looking Indian, the one in {{the black}} woolen wrapper--has an empty buffalo head, with the horns on, for his {{personal}} surmounting. I see a markedly Bourbonish countenance among the chiefs--(it is not very uncommon among them, I am told.) Most of them avoided resting on chairs during the hour of their [...] "talk" [...] in the Commissioner's office; they would sit <b>around</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> leaning against something, or stand up by the walls, partially wrapt in their blankets. Though some of the young fellows were, as I have said, magnificent and beautiful animals, I think the palm of unique picturesqueness, in body, limb, physiognomy, &c., was borne by the old or elderly chiefs, and the wise men.|$|E

I remember, too, she had an ugly old stone-idol she used to yammer to and crawl <b>around</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> before. It's in the Deacon Museum now.

40|$|Nowadays, {{customers}} request more {{variation in}} a company's product assortment {{leading to an}} increased amount of parts moving <b>around</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shop <b>floor.</b> To cope with this tendency, a kitting process can be implemented.

However, the performance of this preparation technique in an assembly process has merely been investigated. Therefore, we study a kitting process with two parts as a continuous-time Markovian queueing model. In particular, our study {{assess the impact of}} production interruptions on kitting...|$|R
