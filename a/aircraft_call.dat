5|$|While {{over the}} South China Sea on October12, a United States Air Force WC-130H Hercules {{reconnaissance}} <b>aircraft</b> (<b>call</b> sign Swan 38), {{with a crew}} of six, went missing while collecting data on the cyclone. The plane took off from Clark Air Base during the night on October12 and made its final contact six hours later roughly 95km (60mi) north of Manila. A rescue team of five Air Force aircraft and the USS White Plains was dispatched to look for survivors. Search and rescue missions for the crew only found pieces of debris, such as an aircraft survival radio, soundproofing material, and orange cushion-like material. All six crewmen were never found and are presumed dead. Following the incident, the 53d Weather Reconnaissance Squadron established the Swan 38 Memorial Scholarship for outstanding students in the 403d Wing.|$|E

5000|$|In most countries, the <b>aircraft</b> <b>call</b> sign or [...] "tail number"/"tail letters" [...] (also {{known as}} {{registration}} marks) {{are linked to}} the international radio call sign allocation table and follow a convention that aircraft radio stations (and, by extension, the aircraft itself) receive call signs consisting of five letters. For example, all British civil aircraft have a five-letter call sign beginning with the letter G. Canadian aircraft have a call sign beginning with C-F or C-G, such as C-FABC. Wing In Ground-effect vehicles (hovercraft) in Canada are eligible to receive C-Hxxx call signs, and ultralight aircraft receive C-Ixxx call signs. In days gone by, even American aircraft used five letter call signs, such as KH-ABC, but they were replaced prior to World War II by the current American system of civilian <b>aircraft</b> <b>call</b> signs (see below).|$|E

5000|$|The presidential {{call sign}} was {{established}} for security purposes during {{the administration of}} Dwight D. Eisenhower. The change stemmed from a 1953 incident where an Eastern Airlines commercial flight (8610) had the same call sign as the flight the president was on (Air Force 8610). The airliner accidentally entered the same airspace, and after the incident, the unique presidential <b>aircraft</b> <b>call</b> sign [...] "Air Force One" [...] was introduced. The first official flight of Air Force One was in 1959, during the Eisenhower administration.|$|E
50|$|The Victoria Police Air Wing had a {{partnership}} with Air Ambulance Victoria (AAV) from 1986 to 2017 to provide a 24-hour emergency air ambulance capability utilising one of the AS365N3 Dauphin helicopters. This <b>aircraft</b> <b>call</b> sign Air 495 was fitted out for the aeromedical role. The partnership covered joint operations and joint use of the aeromedical Dauphin {{so it could be}} utilised for police roles when not required for evacuation, as well as providing a replacement Dauphin helicopter while it is receiving maintenance. This co-operation was aided by having the two organisations sharing facilities at Essendon Airport.|$|E

50|$|Navigating with a sextant and resupplied when {{possible}} with fuel and supplies dropped by a turboprop DeHavilland Twin Otter, the expedition members spent 43 days, 11 hours traveling {{on the ice}} before reaching their final camp {{on the evening of}} April 19. Navigator Jerry Pitzl made hourly sextant sightings over the next two days to confirm their location. On the morning of April 20, the party journeyed somewhat less than four miles to account for ice drift, and signaled a United States Air Force C-135 weather reconnaissance aircraft using a handheld radio. At 10:30 am eastern daylight time, the <b>aircraft,</b> <b>call</b> sign LARK-47, flew overhead confirming the party was exactly at the North Pole. The party was then flown out.|$|E

5000|$|As {{previously}} stated, {{the helicopters}} were not equipped with armor. The crew would wear the [...] "flak vest" [...] and place another flack vest under the pilot seats to provide personal protection. Their only weapons were the crewmember's personal weapons, an M-16 rifle and a [...]38 caliber revolver. The infil {{portion of the}} mission required secrecy and not a firefight.

5000|$|... 22 Wing/CFB North Bay has {{continued}} as the centre {{for the air}} defence of the country, and partner with the United States in NORAD guarding the air sovereignty of the continent. In the late 1990s plans were enacted for a new air defence facility to replace the aging Underground Complex. The complex's air defence electronic, communications and computer systems—the leading edge of early 1980s technology—had become antiquated, struggling {{to cope with the}} demands and crises of an Internet Age world. Moreover, the cost of operating the decades-old, shopping centre-size subterranean complex was rapidly becoming prohibitive. On 20 August 2003, Prime Minister the Right Honourable Jean Chrétien turned soil inaugurating {{the construction of a new}} above ground complex. Three years later, 12 October 2006, 43 years and 11 days after the Underground Complex's birth, a brand new, state-of-the-art surface installation was opened by Minister of National Defence, the Honorable Gordon O'Connor, officially taking the baton of air defence operations from the Underground Complex. The new installation was named the Sgt David L. Pitcher Building, in honour of a Canadian Forces Air Defence Technician who was killed in the crash of an Boeing E-3 Sentry Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) <b>aircraft,</b> <b>call</b> sign Yukla 27, at Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, on 22 September 1995. The aircraft ingested birds into two of its four engines during takeoff; all 24 crew members were killed.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{variations}} of call signs exist to express safety concerns to all operators and controllers monitoring the transmissions. <b>Aircraft</b> <b>call</b> signs {{will use the}} suffix [...] "heavy" [...] for heavy aircraft, to indicate an aircraft {{that is going to}} cause significant wake turbulence, e.g. United Two-Five Heavy; All aircraft capable of operating with a gross take-off weight of more than 136 tonnes. must use this suffix {{whether or not they are}} operating at this weight during a particular phase of flight. These are typically Boeing 747, some models of the 757, 777, or 767, Airbus A340, A330, A350 and A300, McDonnell Douglas DC-10 or MD-11, or Lockheed L-1011 aircraft. The suffix [...] "super" [...] is used for the Airbus A380. For air ambulance services or other flights involving the safety of life (such as aircraft carrying a person who has suffered a heart attack), [...] "lifeguard" [...] is added to the call sign. For flights in which life is not in direct danger (such as transporting organs for transplant), the call sign prefix [...] "Pan-Pan-Medical" [...] is used before the normal call sign, e.g. Pan-Pan-Medical Three-Three-Alpha, Pan-Pan-Medical Northwest Four-Five-Eight, or Pan-Pan-Medical Singapore Niner-Two-Three. Pan Pan (pronounced [...] "pahn-pahn") is the voice radio signal for [...] "urgent", while Mayday is the voice radio signal for [...] "distress". The word may be omitted for air ambulance services with assigned call signs, especially when they have notified air traffic control operators that they are on an air ambulance mission at the beginning of their flight and do not change from one controller to another. The Life Flight air ambulance service, for example, might simply identify as Life-Flight Three. An aircraft that has declared an in-flight emergency will sometimes prefix the word Mayday to its call sign.|$|E
40|$|Communication errors {{involving}} <b>aircraft</b> <b>call</b> {{signs were}} portrayed in reports of 462 hazardous incidents voluntarily {{submitted to the}} ASRS during an approximate four-year period. These errors resulted in confusion, disorder, and uncoordinated traffic conditions and produced the following types of operational anomalies: altitude deviations, wrong-way headings, aborted takeoffs, go arounds, runway incursions, missed crossing altitude restrictions, descents toward high terrain, and traffic conflicts in flight and on the ground. Analysis of the report set resulted in identification of five categories of errors involving call signs: (1) faulty radio usage techniques, (2) call sign loss or smearing due to frequency congestion, (3) confusion resulting from similar sounding call signs, (4) airmen misses of call signs leading to failures to acknowledge or readback, and (5) controller failures regarding confirmation of acknowledgements or readbacks. These error categories are described in detail and several associated hazard mitigating measures that might be aken are considered...|$|E
