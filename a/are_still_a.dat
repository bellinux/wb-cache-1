5|$|Technologically and socially, {{most of the}} civilizations in Eora are in what roughly {{corresponds}} to {{the early stages of}} the Renaissance. Firearms <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> relatively new invention and are quite cumbersome to use; as a result, their use is not widespread. They have, however, proven quite effective against magic users.|$|E
5|$|The Anthracite {{regions of}} northeastern Pennsylvania, {{including}} {{the cities of}} Wilkes-Barre, Scranton, and Hazleton, had an influx of miners to {{the area in the}} 1800s and brought the pasty with them. To this day, pasties <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> local favourite. In 1981, a Pennsylvania entrepreneur started marketing pasties under the brand name Mr. Pastie.|$|E

5|$|Lakes in the {{watershed}} of Leggetts Creek include the Griffin Reservoir, Maple Lake, and Summit Lake. These {{bodies of water}} are in South Abington Township and Scott Township. The Griffin Reservoir supplies water {{to people in the}} Leggetts Creek watershed. The creek and the reservoir serve as a supplemental drinking water supply for more than 100,000 people as of the late 20th century. A spring known as Fountain Springs is in {{the watershed}} in South Abington Township. The Justus Meadows are in the watershed in Scott Township. Most of the watershed is developed, but there <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> few undeveloped reaches of the creek.|$|E
5|$|Most {{stations}} on the Bloor–Danforth line have side platforms; however, there <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> few stations {{which use}} a centre platform instead. At the surface, some stations {{are designed to}} be a part of the shopping area which are located above the subway. Other stations are large facilities on the surface which also contain bus and/or streetcar platforms to allow transfers to take place.|$|E
5|$|Platinum is an {{extremely}} rare metal, occurring at a concentration of only 0.005 ppm in Earth's crust. It is sometimes mistaken for silver. Platinum is often found chemically uncombined as native platinum and as alloy with the other platinum-group metals and iron mostly. Most often the native platinum is found in secondary deposits in alluvial deposits. The alluvial deposits used by pre-Columbian people in the Chocó Department, Colombia <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> source for platinum-group metals. Another large alluvial deposit is in the Ural Mountains, Russia, {{and it is still}} mined.|$|E

5|$|Some {{surviving}} stories regarding Iðunn {{focus on}} her youth-maintaining apples. English scholar Hilda Ellis Davidson links apples to religious practices in Germanic paganism. She points out that buckets of apples {{were found in the}} 9th-century Oseberg ship burial site in Norway and that fruit and nuts (Iðunn having been described as being transformed into a nut in Skáldskaparmál) have been found in the early graves of the Germanic peoples in England and elsewhere on the continent of Europe which may have had a symbolic meaning and also that nuts <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> recognized symbol of fertility in Southwest England.|$|E
5|$|The 1950s brought {{little league}} success, but were notable for goal-scoring by Jack Connor, whose 140 goals in five seasons <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> club record. These {{included}} 13 hat-tricks (three {{of which were}} consecutive – once against Crewe Alexandra and twice against Chester), two instances of four goals in a match (against Workington and Carlisle United), and two of five goals in a match (against Bradford Park Avenue and the Tranmere Rovers). When the regional Third Divisions were to be combined into national Third and Fourth Divisions after the 1957–58 campaign, Stockport {{finished in the top}} half of the Third Division North and so were placed in the following season's national Third Division.|$|E
5|$|Within Earth's crust, osmium, like iridium, {{is found}} at highest {{concentrations}} in {{three types of}} geologic structure: igneous deposits (crustal intrusions from below), impact craters, and deposits reworked {{from one of the}} former structures. The largest known primary reserves are in the Bushveld Igneous Complex in South Africa, though the large copper–nickel deposits near Norilsk in Russia, and the Sudbury Basin in Canada are also significant sources of osmium. Smaller reserves {{can be found in the}} United States. The alluvial deposits used by pre-Columbian people in the Chocó Department, Colombia <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> source for platinum group metals. The second large alluvial deposit was found in the Ural Mountains, Russia, which is still mined.|$|E

5|$|According to Expanded Universe material, the {{peaceful}} Mon Calamari converted their passenger liners into warships {{to support the}} rebellion against the Galactic Empire. Expanded Universe texts state that the ships are crewed almost entirely by Mon Calamari due to the ships' Mon Calamari-oriented controls and interface. The primary opponent of Mon Calamari cruisers are the Imperial Star Destroyers. Although Mon Calamari cruisers are roughly {{the same size as}} most Imperial Destroyers, in head-to-head engagements the Mon Calamari cruisers are usually at a disadvantage, due to their thinner armor. Even so, Mon Calamari cruisers <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> formidable threat to the Imperial fleet; their large numbers of fighter squadrons, modular weapons systems and overlapping shields make them ideal for hit-and-run attacks on Imperial ships, bases, and military outposts.|$|E
5|$|In Norse mythology, {{the goddess}} Iðunn is {{portrayed in the}} Prose Edda (written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson) as {{providing}} apples to the gods that give them eternal youthfulness. English scholar H. R. Ellis Davidson links apples to religious practices in Germanic paganism, from which Norse paganism developed. She points out that buckets of apples {{were found in the}} Oseberg ship burial site in Norway, and that fruit and nuts (Iðunn having been described as being transformed into a nut in Skáldskaparmál) have been found in the early graves of the Germanic peoples in England and elsewhere on the continent of Europe, which may have had a symbolic meaning, and that nuts <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> recognized symbol of fertility in southwest England.|$|E
5|$|Part of the canonization of the Zhou yi bound it {{to a set}} of ten commentaries {{called the}} Ten Wings. The Ten Wings are of a much later {{provenance}} than the Zhou yi, and are the production of a different society. The Zhou yi was written in Early Old Chinese, while the Ten Wings were written in a predecessor to Middle Chinese. The specific origins of the Ten Wings <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> complete mystery to academics. Regardless of their historical relation to the text, the philosophical depth of the Ten Wings made the I Ching a perfect fit to Han period Confucian scholarship. The inclusion of the Ten Wings reflects a widespread recognition in ancient China, found in the Zuo zhuan and other pre-Han texts, that the I Ching was a rich moral and symbolic document useful for more than professional divination.|$|E

5|$|The {{peoples of}} early Iron Age Scotland, {{particularly}} {{in the north and}} west, lived in substantial stone buildings called Atlantic roundhouses. The remains of hundreds of these houses exist throughout the country, some merely piles of rubble, others with impressive towers and outbuildings. They date from about 800 to 300 with the most imposing structures having been created around the 2ndcentury. The most massive constructions that date from this time are the circular broch towers. On average, the ruins only survive up to a few metres above ground level, although there are five extant examples of towers whose walls still exceed 6.5m (21ft) in height. There are at least 100 broch sites in Scotland. Despite extensive research, their purpose {{and the nature of the}} societies that created them <b>are</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> matter of debate.|$|E
