40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} ethnic differences in left ventricular (LV) remodeling between highly-trained <b>athletes</b> of African/Afro-Caribbean (black) and Caucasian (white) <b>athletes.</b> BackgroundThe upper limits of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) are established in white <b>athletes</b> and aid the differentiation of physiologic LVH from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). However, there are few data regarding LV remodeling in black <b>athletes,</b> in whom deaths from HCM are more prevalent. MethodsBetween 2003 and 2007, 300 nationally ranked black male <b>athletes</b> (mean age 20. 5 years) underwent 12 -lead electrocardiogram and 2 -dimensional echocardiography. The results were compared with 150 black and white sedentary individuals and 300 highly-trained white male <b>athletes</b> matched for age, size, and sport. ResultsBlack <b>athletes</b> exhibited greater LV wall thickness and cavity size compared with sedentary black and white individuals. Black <b>athletes</b> had greater LV wall thickness compared with white <b>athletes</b> (11. 3 ± 1. 6 mm vs. 10 ± 1. 5 mm; p 12 mm compared with 12 white <b>athletes</b> (4 %), and 3 % of black <b>athletes</b> exhibited LV wall thickness ≥ 15 mm compared with none of the white <b>athletes.</b> Black <b>athletes</b> with LVH displayed an enlarged LV cavity and normal diastolic function. ConclusionsBlack <b>athletes</b> develop a greater magnitude of LVH compared with white athletes; therefore, extrapolation of conclusions derived from white <b>athletes</b> has the potential of generating false-positive diagnoses of HCM in black <b>athletes...</b>|$|R

30|$|For flexibility, {{evaluated}} by the sit-and-reach test, there were wide-ranging results, with variations of 22  cm in adults and senior fighters [81] and up to 43  cm in high-performance <b>athletes</b> [3].

40|$|Introduction: Previous {{research}} has stereotyped many overhead <b>athletes</b> as baseball pitchers. Due {{to the different}} physiological stresses in each overhead sport, {{it may not be}} appropriate to group all overhead <b>athletes</b> together. The objective {{of this study was to}} show sport specific physical adaptations in common overhead sports. Methods: Forty-three healthy, male <b>athletes</b> participated in this cross-sectional study; fifteen baseball pitchers, fifteen volleyball <b>athletes,</b> thirteen tennis <b>athletes</b> and fifteen control <b>athletes.</b> Internal rotation (IR) and external rotation (ER) shoulder range of motion (ROM), glenohumeral internal rotation deficit (GIRD), external rotation gain (ERG), posterior shoulder tightness (PST) (supine and side-lying methods), shoulder strength and scapular kinematics were assessed in a neuromuscular research laboratory. ROM was assessed with a goniometer while PST was assessed with a goniometer (supine) and carpenters' square (side-lying). Strength was assessed with an isokinetic dynamometer and scapular kinematics with an electromagnetic tracking device. Results: Pitchers had more dominant IR ROM than tennis <b>athletes</b> and less dominant IR ROM than control <b>athletes.</b> Tennis <b>athletes</b> had the lowest IR ROM of all groups included in this study. Volleyball <b>athletes</b> had less dominant IR ROM than control <b>athletes.</b> Pitchers and tennis <b>athletes</b> had more GIRD than control <b>athletes</b> had. Pitchers and tennis <b>athletes</b> had higher between limb differences with the supine method of assessing PST. With the supine assessment, tennis <b>athletes</b> had increased dominant PST compared to control athletes; additionally, all overhead <b>athletes</b> had decreased non-dominant PST. At 90 ° and 120 ° humeral elevation, pitchers had the most scapular elevation, volleyball <b>athletes</b> had more elevation than tennis <b>athletes</b> did, and tennis <b>athletes</b> had less elevation than control <b>athletes</b> did. There were no differences in external rotation ROM, total rotation ROM, or strength measures. Conclusion: Not all overhead <b>athletes</b> had the same physical characteristics. The differences between sports in each of the variables could be due to the different amount of physiologic stress on the shoulder in each sport. These results may help to show healthy, sport specific adaptations in each sport. Clinicians should develop sport specific rehabilitation protocols and return to play criteria for <b>athletes</b> to return to play earlier and stronger...|$|R
