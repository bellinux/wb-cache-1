5|$|MSU's newest {{residential}} {{college is}} the Residential College in Arts & Humanities. Founded October 21, 2005, the college provides around 600 undergraduates with <b>an</b> <b>individualized</b> curriculum in the liberal, visual and performing arts. Though {{all the students}} will graduate with the same degree, MSU encourages students in the college {{to get a second}} degree or specialization. The university houses the new college in a newly renovated Snyder-Phillips Hall, the location of MSU's first residential college, Justin Morrill College.|$|E
5|$|The Wrongs of Woman usually uses third-person narration, {{although}} large {{sections of}} Maria's and Jemima's tales are in first-person narrative. The narrator often relates Maria's feelings to the reader through the new technique of free indirect discourse, which blurs {{the line between the}} third-person narrator and the first-person dialogue of a text. Wollstonecraft juxtaposes the events of the novel with both Maria's own retelling of them and her innermost feelings. The first-person stories allow Maria and Jemima to address each other as equals: their stories of suffering, while still allowing each character to retain <b>an</b> <b>individualized</b> sense of self, are a levelling and bonding force between the two.|$|E

25|$|As of January 2013 about 49,900 {{students}} attend Detroit Public Schools. As {{of that year}} about 9,000 of them, over 18%, have <b>an</b> <b>Individualized</b> Education Program (IEP) plan required by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of the federal government. At the same time, the state average is 12%. In 2012 about 17% had IEPs.|$|E
30|$|<b>As</b> <b>individualized</b> {{differences}} were expected {{with respect to}} the ability to perceive face pareidolia [25], we performed subject-dependent classification where models for each subject were trained separately. In this work, we report the individual as well as averaged classification performance in this framework, which is referred to as personalized average model. In general, experimental designs that involve personalized model analyses provide higher statistical power and therefore require fewer subjects compared to those that involve subject-independent analysis [27].|$|R

25|$|FI {{is one of}} {{the most}} psychologically and {{socially}} debilitating conditions in an otherwise healthy individual, but it is generally treatable.

25|$|According to {{a review}} in 2009, there is {{apparently}} {{no evidence of}} benefit of fluid restriction in patients with clinically stable heart failure otherwise receiving optimal pharmacological treatment. The same review suggested that clinicians still choosing to restrict fluid intake for patients with HF should consider <b>an</b> <b>individualized</b> fluid prescription, potentially based on patient body weight, sodium intake, and likelihood of adherence.|$|E
40|$|A stepped care {{approach}} to treatment decisions for alcohol problems {{consists of the}} application of decision rules derived from practice {{in other areas of}} health care. The treatment used should be (<b>a)</b> <b>individualized,</b> (b) consistent with the research literature and supported by clinical judgment, and (c) least restrictive but still likely to be successful. Used in this way, stepped care emphasizes serving the needs of clients efficiently but without sacrificing quality of care. Issues concerning stepped care are discussed, and the application of a stepped care {{approach to}} alcohol treatment services is described...|$|R

25|$|The {{principal}} possible {{indicators of}} movement toward <b>an</b> <b>individualized</b> conception of security {{lie in the}} first place in the evolution of international society's consideration of rights of individuals in the face of potential threats from states. The most obvious foci of analysis here are the UN Charter, the UN Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and its associated covenants (1966), and conventions related to particular crimes (e.g.,genocide) and the rights of particular groups (e.g., women, racial groups, and refugees).|$|E
25|$|Lactation {{consultants}} are {{health care}} professionals whose primary goal is to promote breastfeeding and assist mothers with breastfeeding on <b>an</b> <b>individualized</b> or group basis.

Lactation consultants are board-certified by the International Board of Lactation Consultant Examiners. The majority of lactation consultants hold a certification in another healthcare profession, often as a nurse, midwife, dietician or physician. However, there is no specific post-secondary education required to become a lactation consultant.|$|E

Harple's research and experience with Patronet and Context Labs led him to subsequently found Context Media. Some time later in 2004, Harple acquired the pyramid stage set from Rundgren’s 1976 Ra (Utopia album) tour and installed it as a sculpture in a natural setting in coastal Massachusetts.|$|E
25|$|Many {{experts have}} {{suggested}} that establishing mechanisms to coordinate care for the dual-eligibles could yield substantial savings in the Medicare program, mostly by reducing hospitalizations. Such programs would connect patients with primary care, create <b>an</b> <b>individualized</b> health plan, assist enrollees in receiving social and human services as well as medical care, reconcile medications prescribed by different doctors to ensure they do not undermine one another, and oversee behavior to improve health. The general ethos of these proposals is to “treat the patient, not the condition,” and maintain health while avoiding costly treatments.|$|E

Though all the students will graduate with the same degree, MSU will encourage students in the college {{to get a second}} degree or specialization. The new college will be MSU's fourth residential college, after James Madison College, the Lyman Briggs School, and the now-defunct Justin Morrill College. Although early proposals named the college after Nelson Mandela, university officials have not decided on a permanent name , saying that it is still too early to fix a permanent name to the college.|$|E

First we aimed to study if prenatal maternal obesity plays a role in determining bone marrow insulin sensitivity in elderly female offspring. Secondly we studied if <b>a</b> four-month <b>individualized</b> resistance training intervention increases bone marrow insulin sensitivity in elderly female offspring and whether this possible positive outcome is regulated by the offspring's mother's obesity status. 37 frail elderly females (mean age 71. 9 +/- 3. 1 years) of which 20 were offspring of lean/normal-weight mothers (OLM, maternal BMI = 28. 1 kg/m(2)) were studied before and after <b>a</b> four-month <b>individualized</b> resistance training intervention.

25|$|Students {{with special}} needs {{struggle}} not only with writing and reading acquisition, but with social and emotional development and confidence about their writing. Dialogue journals as <b>an</b> <b>individualized</b> means of private, mutual communication can provide students with support in handling emotions, conflicts, and frustrations. For students with limited writing confidence and proficiency, the opportunity to express ideas and thoughts with teacher elaboration and modeling, and without correction, {{has been shown to}} increase their time on task, writing length, and writing quality. Using a single-subject baseline and intervention design, Anderson, Nelson, Richardson, Webb, and Young explored the value of dialogue journals in developing a more supportive student-teacher relationship with emotionally and behaviorally challenged middle school students.|$|E
25|$|The {{school is}} known for {{establishing}} a curative therapy for testicular cancer. Patients from around the world, including Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong, have traveled to the Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center for this therapy and comprehensive care. The school has been a pioneer in establishing a cure for Fanconi Anemia (a precancerous condition in children), specific radiation therapy techniques, techniques in a type of nerve-sparing surgery for urological cancers, the development of drugs to stimulate blood cell production, and novel drug therapies for breast cancer. Researchers at the medical school also discovered the cancer-fighting agent in Tamoxifen. In 2011, the school announced plans for an institute specializing in personalized medicine, which would pursue <b>an</b> <b>individualized</b> and genomics-based approach to treating cancer, pediatrics, and obstetrics.|$|E

Each class in the game has <b>an</b> <b>individualized</b> SSD, and most expansions revolve around providing new classes and 'variants' of ships to the game, with new SSDs. These displays consist of check-off boxes for all the ship's structure and systems (shields in all six directions, systems and hull damage, how much power the engines produce, how many transporters there are, etc. checked off when damaged) in the general layout of the ship, along with general reference information for that ship (tracks to check off use for weapons in limited supply like drones, shuttles, probes, plus weapons fire resolution tables, firing arcs, and miscellaneous ship data).|$|E
