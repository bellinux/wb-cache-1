40|$|Destruction of {{salmonellae}} in inoculated {{and naturally}} contaminated natural <b>animal</b> <b>casings</b> was studied. Salmonellae were effectively destroyed (99. 999 %) in inoculated hog casings after exposure for 24 h to saturated brine at pH 4. 0 and 10. 0 adjusted with acetic acid and sodium hydroxide, respectively. Treatment of inoculated hog and sheep casings in saturated brine or saturated brine with citric acid {{was not nearly}} as effective as brine containing acetic acid or sodium hydroxide. Salmonellae in naturally contaminated hog casings were virtually eliminated after 21 days of storage in crystalline sodium chloride. Salmonella in sheep and hog casings were eliminated after 7 days of storage in crystalline salt. Treatment of naturally contaminated hog casings with glycerin-salt or sorbitol-salt solutions was not as effective in destroying salmonellae as treatment with crystalline salt...|$|E

Quite by accident, he discovered that when the casing was removed from the product the sausages retained their shape and were firm.

50|$|An {{important}} {{renewable resource}} is wood provided {{by means of}} forestry, which {{has been used for}} construction, housing and firewood since ancient times. Plants provide the main sources for renewable resources, the main distinction is made between energy crops and non-food crops. A large variety of lubricants, industrially used vegetable oils, textiles and fibre made e.g. of cotton, copra or hemp, paper derived from wood, rags or grasses, bioplastic are based on plant renewable resources. A large variety of chemical based products like latex, ethanol, resin, sugar and starch can be provided with plant renewables. Animal based renewables include fur, leather, technical fat and lubricants and further derived products, as e.g. <b>animal</b> glue, tendons, <b>casings</b> or in historical times ambra and baleen provided by whaling.|$|R
40|$|Accurate and {{reliable}} in vivo measurement systems for orthopedic applications will allow {{a better understanding}} of native joint loading, gait patterns, and changes during healing and tissue regeneration. Robust {{and reliable}} telemetry units with an implantable transmitter and data acquisition software are necessary to insure long-term measurements. It was the goal of this study to update the current implantable telemetry system. Updates included using a new tablet computer for increased rates of data acquisition and encasing transmitters in a new waterproof casing. Software was developed using Labview on a Windows based Acer Iconia Tab. The Labview program allowed the user to save data to a measurement file and view the data in real time. The increased processing power of the tablet resulted in an increase in data collection rates from 29 Hz to 87 Hz. Interfacing the tablet computer with the telemetry system required the use of a RS- 232 protocol to USB adapter. The newly developed tablet computer system was also used for load measurement collection during the most recent in vivo study. In order to insure transmitter function in vivo it was necessary to characterize the factors affecting transmission in vivo and develop transmitter and power coil designs that operated reliably. In the past implantable transmitters were noted to operate properly during bench top testing, but often failed after being placed in vivo. The two factors studied that limited power transfer to the transmitters were immersion in an aqueous environment and exposure to elevated temperatures. An aqueous environment significantly decreased power transfer by 11. 9 % (p-value = 0. 014) relative to testing on the bench top. Additionally, a temperature increase to 40 °C decreased power transfer by 6. 2 % (p-value = 0. 017) when compared to power transfer in room temperature air. A solution that restored transmitter function required encasing transmitters in a new waterproof casing. Different casing designs made of silicone and semi-solid triglycerides were developed and tested on the bench top. Two different casing designs were used during in vivo testing and implanted into test <b>animals.</b> One <b>casing</b> design insured transmission while the other separated in vivo and did not facilitate transmission...|$|R
40|$|Natural casings are {{portions}} of animal intestines {{that have been}} used for centuries in the manufacturing of many typical dry-fermented sausages. Because of their intestinal origin, casings have a high microbial load, but their possible role as inoculants of microorganisms that can {{play a role in the}} ripening of dry-fermented sausages has not been investigated yet in detail. Here, we analyzed by means of culture-dependent methods and Illumina high- throughput sequencing of 16 S rRNA amplicons the bacterial ecology of hog, cow and ovine casings at different stages of their preparation for sausages production. We also compared the bacterial ecology of casings, meat mixtures and sausages at different ripening stages in the production chains of Salame Mantovano, a typical Italian dry-fermented sausage. Culture-based methods relied on the isolation and characterization of strains on different typical media, while for the molecular methods multi-million reads were originated and analyzed after amplification and Illumina MiSeq sequencing of 16 S rRNA amplicons. From the <b>animal</b> <b>casings,</b> several strains of Staphylococcus, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Vagococcus and Clostridium were counted in significant amounts, isolated and characterized at phylogenetic level. High-throughput sequencing analyses revealed a high bacterial diversity, which differed strongly between casings of different animal species. It was also found that the technological processes had a strong impact on the casings bacterial ecology, with a significant reduction of undesired microorganisms, and an increase in the proportion of lactobacilli and staphylococci. Finally, the analyses on the production chain of Salame Mantovano revealed that several strains found in the casings before stuffing were also detected in the final ripened products, thus confirming our main hypothesis. This work shows the importance of the use of natural casings in the manufacturing of typical dry-fermented products, and highlights the role of high-throughput sequencing technologies as powerful tools to gain a better comprehension of food fermentations...|$|E
40|$|Archaea are prokaryotic organisms {{thriving}} {{mostly at}} extreme environments and sharing characteristics with both bacteria and eukaryotes. Within the Archaea domain, the Halobacteriaceae family comprises {{species that are}} mainly found in solar salterns, marine environments and salted food products. A major representative of this group is Halobacterium salinarum. Recently, these microorganisms have raised an increasing scientific interest, since they {{have been found in}} both food and human intestinal mucosa. Very little is known about their antibiotic resistances, and it is thus important to establish microbiological breakpoints for Halobacteriaceae, as done in the past for bacteria. At present only few works have studied antibiotic resistance in halophilic Archaea, but the Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) proposed by these studies can’t be considered acceptable since they didn’t use at least 50 different strains for each species, as the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility (EUCAST) requires. Fifty-two different strains of Halobacterium salinarum were isolated and characterised by RAPD (Random Amplification of Polymorphic DNA) and 16 S rRNA analyses within a study on the microbial ecology of <b>animal</b> <b>casings.</b> We assessed the microbiological breakpoints of these isolates and other three collection strains against anisomycin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, erythromycin, novobiocin, rifampicin and trimethoprim. While for rifampicin, ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim the MICs previously found have been confirmed, for the other antibiotics we obtained for clindamycin, novobiocin and anisomycin MICs lower than the reported ones, while for erythromycin they were higher. In particular, we observed that H. salinarum is mainly susceptible to antibiotics that inhibit DNA replication rather than those which interact with protein synthesis. High variability among strains was mainly found with novobiocin. This work provides new insights about MICs for H. salinarum, a strain that is often found along the food chain, and which can be a first model for the assessment of antibiotic resistance profiles in Archaea...|$|E
40|$|Agriculture is the {{backbone}} and single largest sector of Pakistan’s economy as {{its contribution to}} Gross Domestic Product (GDP) exceeded 25. 3 percent during 1997 - 98. Crops, livestock, fishing and forestry sub-sectors being its main components, only crop and livestock sub-sectors are of critical importance. They accounted for 59. 6 and 36. 2 percent of the sector’s output respectively. Because of the ongoing process of structural transformation, agriculture’s share in the national economy is shrinking. From 39 percent of GDP in 1969 - 70 it has fallen to its current levels [Pakistan (1999 a) ]. The livestock sub-sector however has not followed suit. It has risen from 27. 3 percent in 1969 - 70 to 36. 2 percent in 1997 - 98. This trend in fact would be more pronounced if the national accounts did not underestimate the sub-sector’s components such as farm yard manure, dung cakes for household fuels and animal draft power. Apart from its contributions to national income, the livestock sub-sector is an active employer of thousands of landless poor and subsistence and semi-subsistence small farming families. Being a household activity, women are a special beneficiary of employment in the sub-sector. It is {{a major source of}} nourishment like milk, butter oil, eggs and meat and adds immensely to the health, nutrition and well being of rural as well as urban people. While animal fat and butter oil supplies are helpful in containing vegetable oil imports, many products of livestock origin such as wool and wool products, leather and leather made-ups and <b>animal</b> <b>casings</b> are exported and contribute significantly to hard earned foreign exchange [Ahmad, Ahmad and Chaudhry (1996) ]. It follows from the above that the livestock sub-sector is likely to maintain its position as the dominant sub-sector of Pakistan’s agricultural sector or even that of the national economy for quite sometime in the future. Despite the rising and critical importance of the sub-sector, there, however, is no corresponding emphasis on analysing its achievements, problems and future prospects and likely policies to brighten these up. In view of this limitation, the present paper makes a limited attempt to study the growth process of the livestock sub-sector. ...|$|E
40|$|Natural sausage casings are {{produced}} from the intestines of various species {{and used as}} edible containers for {{many different types of}} sausage around the world. Casings must therefore be fit for human consumption and must meet all food safety and hygiene requirements that apply to food of animal origin. As a hazard analysis of sausages would either focus on the final product or on the meat batter inside the casing, it becomes clear that many studies were done on sausages and only a handful on casings. Salt has been in use for centuries as the main preservative agent of casings and a study was done to determine whether this technique can meet the current microbiological criteria. Results indicate that the antimicrobial properties of salt used for the preservation of casings are sufficient to reduce the bacterial contamination (except for Clostridium spores) well below acceptable levels at a water activity level of 0. 85 or lower during a 30 -day storage period. To prevent the outgrowth of bacterial spores, additional preservation measures should be implemented. In the experiments described the use of the bacteriocin nisin was evaluated to reduce outgrowth of spores in desalinated casings. Additionally, the binding of nisin to casings, using 14 C-labeled nisin Z and subsequent bioavailability of nisin were evaluated. Results demonstrate that nisin is bound to casings but if sufficient nisin was present the outgrowth of Clostridium spores in this model was reduced. Neural and lymphoid tissue can be regarded as marker tissues for the potential presence of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) disease-specific prion protein (PrPPScP). These tissue types can also be present in cleaned beef casings. Based on the results from a quantitative histological analysis it was calculated that a standard 200 g sausage produced in beef casings contains 0. 09 g lymphoid and 0. 02 g neural tissue originating from the casing. Using these quantitative histological results a BSE infectivity risk - consumer exposure assessment was made, indicating that the potential risk when consuming a sausage produced in beef casings is far less than consuming a T-bone steak from the same <b>animal.</b> <b>Casings</b> {{are produced}} and shipped {{all over the world and}} this trans-global movement of casings means that restrictive measures, implemented to prevent the spread of contagious animal diseases, are also applicable. Two studies describe the efficacy of FMD and CSF virus inactivation in cleaned casings, either by salt (NaCl) or by using phosphate supplemented salt. After storage at about 20 C for 30 days, no remaining FMDV infectivity was found after either treatment, whereas casings stored at 4 oC still contained infectivity. CSFV infectivity was no longer present after treatment with phosphate supplemented salt and storage for 30 days at either 4 oC or 20 oC. To verify that phosphate supplemented salt was used, a commercially available phosphate assay kit was validated for the qualitative determination of phosphate present in treated casings without interference of naturally occurring phosphate in salt used for brines in which casings are preserved...|$|E
