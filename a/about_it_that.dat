The second and third chapters look at the negative divine - the characterisation of God as void, silence or non-being - which Stace maintains is an idea found in all religions. He maintains that mystical experience is shared by all mankind, {{it is only the}} theories <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> differ. On this point he says he is in agreement with Otto. In this experience the distinction between subject and object is overcome, indeed there is no difference between the experiencer and the experience.|$|E

25|$|In summertime village cricket is {{the delight}} of everyone. Nearly every village has its own cricket field where the young men play and the old men watch. In the village of Lintz in County Durham {{they have their own}} ground, where they have played these last 70 years. They tend it well. The wicket area is well rolled and mown. The outfield is kept short. It has a good club house for the players and seats for the onlookers. The village team play there on Saturdays and Sundays. They belong to a league, {{competing}} with the neighbouring villages. On other evenings after work they practise while the light lasts. Yet now after these 70 years a judge of the High Court has ordered that they must not play there any more. He has issued an injunction to stop them. He has done it at the instance of a newcomer who is no lover of cricket. This newcomer has built, or has had built for him, a house {{on the edge of the}} cricket ground which four years ago was a field where cattle grazed. The animals did not mind the cricket. But now this adjoining field has been turned into a housing estate. The newcomer bought one of the houses on the edge of the cricket ground. No doubt the open space was a selling point. Now he complains that when a batsman hits a six the ball has been known to land in his garden or on or near his house. His wife has got so upset <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> they always go out at week-ends. They do not go into the garden when cricket is being played. They say that this is intolerable. So they asked the judge to stop the cricket being played. And the judge, much against his will, has felt that he must order the cricket to be stopped: with the consequence, I suppose, that the Lintz Cricket Club will disappear. The cricket ground will be turned to some other use. I expect for more houses or a factory. The young men will turn to other things instead of cricket. The whole village will be much the poorer. And all this because of a newcomer who has just bought a house there next to the cricket ground.|$|E

An elaborate set was assembled near the top station of the Canadian chairlift, taking three months to build. The production {{had to wait for}} a huge snowstorm, which eventually arrived. The ski-chase sequence was inspired by Nolan's favorite James Bond film, On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969): [...] "What I liked <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> we've tried to emulate in this film is there's a tremendous balance in that movie of action and scale and romanticism and tragedy and emotion." ...|$|E

In 2008, Alicia Wade of the Daily Egyptian said the episode and its theme about genetic engineering still felt fresh more than 10 years after its original broadcast. In 2009, Travis Fickett from IGN rated this episode an 8.3 out of 10, and concluded <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> [...] "It's a bit shocking, perhaps offensive to some, but {{in the context of}} murdering mutants and five-assed monkeys created by Brando parodies in Hawaiian moo-moos – it all makes perfect sense.

He also considered cyberpunk influences that came from around 1978 when he was participating in a themed Dungeons & Dragons campaign created and led by Bruce Sterling, who had adapted that campaign based on the choice Spector and the other players made. Troubleshooter, in contrast to the other games he had been making at Origin, would have been a [...] "real-world role-playing game", relying more on player choices and assuring that every player could reach {{the end of the game}} but in the manner they choose.|$|E

[...] "He's more like a weirdly sincere space cadet, babbling to himself with puppyish befuddlement, breaking into funky soft dance moves that look as if he's been doing them in his bedroom since he was 8.

That's {{what happens when}} you're not a boy, but not yet a man: One Direction can't go straight from the G-rated sweetness of “What Makes You Beautiful” to something akin to Enrique Iglesias's [...] "Tonight, I’m F****** You," [...] so instead they’re stuck with this in between clumsiness that the not-so-little girls will understand." [...] Grady Smith of Entertainment Weekly characterised it as [...] "not-so-innocent" [...] and a [...] "party jam". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard felt that its sexual suggestive lyricism [...] "arrives too soon after the more accomplished puppy-love odes of previous hits [...] "What Makes You Beautiful" [...] and [...] "One Thing" [...] to further the conversation." ...|$|E

Azaria {{served as an}} executive producer {{on the show and}} directed an episode of its second season. After reading the pilot script, he sent it to Platt, who took the role of Huff's friend Russell Tupper. Azaria enjoyed working on the show, but struggled with the bleak subject matter and was often in dispute with its creator Bob Lowry, noting that it [...] "was tough to marry our visions all the time, [...] we both cared so much <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> neither of us were willing to let go." [...] Gillian Flynn of Entertainment Weekly called Azaria [...] "impressively subtle" [...] in the role, while John Leonard of New York magazine said he was a [...] "shrewd bit of casting." [...] The show garnered seven Emmy nominations in 2005, including a nomination for Azaria for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series. Despite the awards, the show continually received low ratings, and Showtime chose not to commission it for a third season.|$|E

500|$|Criticism of Irwin's career {{following}} his death came from Dan Mathews, vice-president {{of the animal}} rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. Comparing Irwin to a [...] "cheap reality TV star", Mathews accused him of [...] "antagonising frightened wild animals ... a very dangerous message to send to children", contrasted his methods with the behaviour of [...] "a responsible conservationist like Jacques Cousteau", {{and said it was}} [...] "no shock at all that Steve Irwin should die provoking a dangerous animal." [...] The son of Jacques Cousteau, Jean-Michel Cousteau—also a producer of wildlife documentaries—took issue with Irwin's [...] "very, very spectacular, dramatic way of presenting things" [...] and suggested instead that [...] "You don't touch nature, you just look at it." [...] Jacques Cousteau's grandson and Jean-Michel's nephew, Philippe Cousteau Jr., on the other hand, called Irwin [...] "a remarkable individual"; describing the Ocean's Deadliest project (on which he worked along with Irwin), Philippe said, [...] "I think why Steve was so excited <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> we were looking at these animals that people think of as, you know, dangerous and deadly monsters, and they're not. They all have an important place in the environment and in the world. And that was what his whole message was about." ...|$|E

[...] La Rivière's attention is drawn to one of Mac's lines {{at the end of the}} pilot, in a scene that he considers [...] "amusing"; the professor's admonition [...] "Don't come crying to me if you get hurt!"
