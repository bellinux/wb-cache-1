5000|$|The Commander {{is powered}} by the 26.7L Rolls-Royce/Perkins CV12 TCE twin {{turbocharged}} diesel engine that produces approximately [...] and is coupled to an Allison automatic transmission. The Scammell Commander CV12 engine {{is very similar to}} the ones used in the Challenger 1 and 2 main battle tanks but with an increased power output of around 1,200 bhp 895 kW. Designed to tow loads up to 65 tonnes, the Commander tows a special semi-trailer onto which tanks can be tail-loaded using a hydraulic 20-tonne capacity winch. A prominent bonnet houses the vehicle's Perkins (Rolls-Royce) CV 12 TCE V12 and although the Commander {{is powered by}} the Perkins/Rolls-Royce engine, other types were also proposed - one of the prototypes used a Cummins KTA 600 diesel. The cab has provision for up to three or four passengers and there is space for two bunks behind the front seats. Due to the front <b>axle</b> <b>lock</b> angle, the Commander is highly maneuverable and can negotiate a 'T' intersection with only 9.15 meters between the walls.|$|E

On 6x6 models front axle suspension via adjustable torsion bars, rear axles suspended by longitudinal semi elliptic leaf springs. For 4x4 configuration rear axle was also suspended via torsion bars. Manually selectable front drive via homo-kinetic driveshafts, constant rear drive with the <b>axle</b> <b>locks</b> standard on all models.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the mid-1970s}} the Big Three all started using this axle. GM began phasing {{it out in}} 1988 in favor of Independent suspension, while still {{offering}} it in some higher GVWR trucks (V-30) until 1991. Dodge used a Dana 60 up to 2002. 3rd Generation Dodge Rams dropped the Dana 60 in favor of AAM axles. Ford still uses the Dana 60 front axle. Manufactured in both Kingpin and Ball joint variations, [...] "standard" [...] (low pinion) and [...] "reverse cut" [...] rotation (high pinion) variations and open and limited slip, and locking variations. The housing material is Gray iron in early axles and Ductile iron in later axles. GM and Ford Dana 60 <b>axles</b> utilize <b>locking</b> hubs. Dodge Dana 60 <b>axles</b> utilized <b>locking</b> hubs until 1994 when a Center Axle Disconnect (CAD) system was adopted. However, model year 2002 Rams phased out the CAD system leaving some 2002 Dana 60 <b>axles</b> permanently <b>locked</b> in.|$|R
5000|$|Manual Shift On-the-Fly {{transfer}} {{cases have}} a selector lever on the driver's side floor transmission hump {{and may also}} have either two sealed automatic front <b>axle</b> <b>locking</b> hubs or two manual front axle hub selectors of [...] "LOCK" [...] and [...] "UNLOCK" [...] or [...] "FREE". To engage the four-wheel-drive system the vehicle must be moving at a low speed, {{the speed at which}} 4x4 can be engaged depends on the vehicle. This is only for the four-wheel-drive high setting. To engage the four-wheel-drive low setting, the vehicle must be stopped and the transmission must be shifted to neutral, then the four-wheel-drive low can be selected.|$|R
50|$|Additional CLS 63 AMG models include CLS 63 AMG 4MATIC, CLS 63 AMG 4MATIC S-Model, in {{sedan and}} Shooting Brake variants. CLS 63 AMG 4MATIC {{includes}} AMG 4MATIC all-wheel drive, three-link front suspension optimisation, 10-spoke light-alloy wheels painted in matt titanium grey with a high-sheen rim flange {{on top of}} the updated CLS 63 AMG vehicles. CLS 63 AMG 4MATIC S-Model is based on CLS 63 AMG 4MATIC, but includes increased engine power to @5500rpm and 800 Nm@1750-5000rpm, rear <b>axle</b> differential <b>lock,</b> <b>axle</b> components produced in aluminium.|$|R
50|$|AMG Performance Package {{includes}} increasing {{engine power}} to @5500rpm and 900 Nm@2250-3750rpm, raising top speed to 300 kph mph, carbon fibre AMG engine cover and AMG spoiler lip, AMG rear <b>axle</b> differential <b>lock,</b> red-painted callipers, AMG performance steering wheel in nappa leather/DINAMICA.|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} types of {{different}} wheels: normal plastic, one-way, aluminum, and lock-nut. Normal plastic wheels are fine, {{but they are not}} adequate for really fast cars. They become loose after disconnecting them from the axle several times. Additionally, they create drag when the car going through turns as the <b>axle</b> <b>locks</b> the two wheels at same speed, since the outer wheel must cover more distance than the inner wheel (relatively to the turn of the course). One-way wheels allow either side to roll faster than the other when turning, and minimize the speed loss in turns. Aluminum wheels are very light, sturdy, and best for speed. Some aluminum wheels have preventive measures against loosening with the axle. However, lock-nut wheels are the best in preventing the cars from losing the wheels during a run.|$|R
50|$|Sensitrak {{traction}} management {{monitors the}} speed differential between {{the front and}} rear wheels. If the system detects that the front wheels are slipping, power is automatically directed to the rear wheels. The system reduces wheel slip but not the manoeuvrability. The operator can select permanent 4WD and a manually applied front <b>axle</b> differential <b>lock</b> further boosting traction.|$|R
50|$|Although {{a widely}} used system, {{this system is}} not as {{efficient}} as a system with locking hubs. A CAD system spins the axle shafts, spider gears, and side gears in the carrier during normal driving. Locking hubs disengage the axle at the wheels, allowing all of the axle to be at rest during normal driving. Not as efficient as locking hubs, a CAD system still makes for much less drag than having the <b>axle</b> completely <b>locked</b> in.|$|R
5000|$|Active Drive II {{includes}} {{all of the}} features of Active Drive I but adds a low gear range. When in [...] "4-Low" [...] mode the front and rear <b>axles</b> are <b>locked</b> together and power is sent to all four-wheels through a 2.92:1 gear reduction in the power transfer unit; providing a crawl ratio of 56:1 for four cylinder Jeep Cherokees and a 47.8:1 crawl ratio for six-cylinder Cherokees. All Cherokees with this system have a raised ride height of one inch.|$|R
5000|$|Active Drive Low {{includes}} {{all of the}} features of Active Drive I but denotes a greater possible crawl ratio. When in [...] "4-Low" [...] mode the front and rear <b>axles</b> are <b>locked</b> together and power is sent to all four-wheels through the power transfer unit although no low range gear reduction occurs. Active Drive low relies on shorter axle gear ratios while holding first gear in the ZF9HP transmission to achieve a crawl ratio of 20:1; similar in effect to Freedom Drive II.|$|R
40|$|Investigates the braking {{performance}} {{requirements of the}} UltraCommuter, a lightweight series hybrid electric vehicle currently under development at the University of Queensland. With a predicted vehicle mass of 600 kg and two in-wheel motors each capable of 500 Nm of peak torque, decelerations up to 0. 46 g are theoretically possible using purely regenerative braking. With 99 % of braking demands less than 0. 35 g, essentially all braking can be regenerative. The wheel motors have sufficient peak torque capability to lock the rear wheels in combination with front axle braking, {{eliminating the need for}} friction braking at the rear. Emergency braking levels approaching 1 g are achieved by supplementation with front disk brakes. This paper presents equations describing the peak front and rear axle braking forces which occur under straight line braking, including gradients. Conventionally, to guarantee stability, mechanical front/rear proportioning of braking effort ensures that the front <b>axle</b> <b>locks</b> first. In this application, all braking is initially regenerative at the rear, and an adaptive ''by-wire'' proportioning system presented ensures this stability requirement is still satisfied. Front wheel drive and all wheel drive systems are also discussed. Finally, peak and continuous performance measures, not commonly provided for friction brakes, are derived for the UltraCommuter's motor capability and range of operation...|$|R
50|$|The axles are {{manufactured}} by American Axle & Manufacturing, Inc. The front is an AAM 9.25 and the rear is a hybrid AAM 10.5 {{with the larger}} axle shafts from the AAM 11.5. Despite the fact the <b>axles</b> have <b>locking</b> differentials, the rear axle is also a helical-type limited slip differential when unlocked. The axles are only available with a 4.56:1 gear ratio. Non Power Wagon 2500 Ram trucks only have 3.42:1, 3.73:1, or 4.10:1 gear ratios. 2010 models (along with other Ram trucks) received larger universal joints.|$|R
50|$|The car was {{developed}} in the late 60s based on the successful L-3314 series and went into production in 1974. This version was produced both as a 4x4 and a 6x6. An 8x8 was planned but dropped. Engines were the B30 (B20 in the prototypes) from Volvo's civilian cars. The C3 series feature portal <b>axles</b> with <b>locking</b> differentials resulting in very high ground-clearance (similar to the Unimog) and outstanding performance offroad. The cars are narrow to make it possible to navigate between trees and on narrow forest roads.|$|R
5000|$|The 3.8-litre unit {{found in}} the 991 GT3 is {{replaced}} with a 4.0-litre unit with 500 horsepower and 339 lb.ft Nm of torque. The transmission is PDK only.

5000|$|More commonly, Command-Trac is used {{to refer}} to the NP/NV-231 or NP-207 {{transfer}} cases introduced along with the Jeep Cherokee (XJ) in 1984. The system offers a chain-driven, aluminum, [...] "shift-on-the-fly" [...] transfer case. The [...] "shift-on-the-fly" [...] feature provides manual ease and assist while engaging 4WD. Command-Trac should only be driven in 4WD on low-traction surfaces due to the front and rear <b>axles</b> being <b>locked</b> together (no differential action in the transfer case). Driving in 4WD on dry pavement causes excessive wheel and drivetrain wear. Four-wheel modes are most commonly used for wet/slick surfaces or extreme weather conditions (rain, snow, etc.) (4H), towing (N), and off-road activities (4L).|$|R
50|$|Axle {{counters}} {{are used}} in rail yards to detect train cars as they are sorted. Axle counters are placed on the track before each switch and on each track that exits the switch.

40|$|Mechanically {{interlocked}} molecules such as rotaxanes and catenanes {{have potential}} as components of molecular machinery. Rotaxanes {{consist of a}} dumb-bell-shaped molecule encircled by a macrocycle that can move unhindered along the axle, trapped by bulky stoppers. Previously, rotaxanes have been made {{from a variety of}} molecules, but not from DNA. Here, we report the design, assembly and characterization of rotaxanes in which both the dumb-bell-shaped molecule and the macrocycle are made of double-stranded DNA, and in which the axle of the dumb-bell is threaded through the macrocycle by base pairing. The assembly involves the formation of pseudorotaxanes, in which the macrocycle and the <b>axle</b> are <b>locked</b> together by hybridization. Ligation of stopper modules to the axle leads to the characteristic dumb-bell topology. When an oligonucleotide is added to release the macrocycle from the axle, the pseudorotaxanes are either converted to mechanically stable rotaxanes, or they disassemble by means of a slippage mechanism to yield a dumb-bell and a free macrocycle. Our DNA rotaxanes allow the fields of mechanically interlocked molecules and DNA nanotechnology to be combined, thus opening new possibilities for research into molecular machines and synthetic biology...|$|R

50|$|A notable feature {{available}} in this generation was the automatic {{four wheel drive}} option called Quadra-Drive, which employed the New Venture Gear NV247 transfer case. This two-speed chain-driven transfer case uses a gerotor, a clutch pack coupled to a hydraulic pump, to transfer torque between {{the front and rear}} axles. The transfer case contains three modes, 4-All Time, Neutral, and 4-Lo. In 4-All Time, 100% of torque is sent to the rear axle in normal conditions. If the rear axle starts spinning at a higher rate than the front axle, hydraulic pressure builds up in the gerotor and causes the clutch pack to progressively transfer torque to the front axle until both axles return to the same speed. Neutral mode is intended for towing the vehicle. In 4-Lo, the front and rear <b>axles</b> are <b>locked</b> together through a 2.72 reduction gear ratio. The NV247 transfer case is mated to front and rear axles containing Jeep's Vari-Lok differentials. Vari-Lok differentials also use a gerotor to transfer torque between the wheels {{on either side of the}} axle. The major advantage of Quadra-Drive was that the combined transfer case and progressive locking differentials in each axle could automatically control traction between all four wheels. However, only the center differential could be permanently locked, and only in 4Lo. The Quadra-Trac II system included the NV247 transfer case with the standard open front and rear differentials.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1960s, Jeep used {{a unique}} Dana 44 IFS setup, that was short lived. In the 1980s and 1990s, Ford used {{a form of}} IFS known as [...] "Twin Traction Beam" [...] (TTB). This Dana 44 had no axle tubes but {{attached}} to the driver side traction beam, which also acted as a cover plate, and had [...] "open air" [...] axles which traveled through the beams to the spindles. The axles had u-joints {{to allow for the}} independent action of the beams. Individual pivot points for the beams at greater than center made each beam longer than half the overall width crossing in the middle. This allowed for an independent front suspension design.
