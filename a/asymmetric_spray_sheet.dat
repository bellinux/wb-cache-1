40|$|Metofluthrin is a newly {{synthesized}} pyrethroid possessing high knockdown and lethal activity against mosquitoes. Studies of metofluthrin-impregnated plastic strips {{have been}} performed with dengue vectors. This study reports {{the efficacy of the}} new prototypes of metofluthrin-impregnated plastic strips against malaria vectors, Anopheles gambiae complex, in the Kongo villages of Bagamoyo district in coastal Tanzania. The study, using 20 houses, half intervention, half control, was conducted for a 124 -day period. Pyrethrum <b>spray</b> <b>sheets</b> and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention light traps were used to sample mosquito population indices. The mosquito density indices of the intervention houses were observed to be significantly lower than those of the control houses when pyrethrum <b>spray</b> <b>sheet</b> collection was used (F = 4. 61, 1 df, P = 0. 038; 98. 7 % reduction of total mosquito collection compared with that for the controls). These low indices were observed despite the large openings found in Bagamoyo houses, which were predicted to have a considerable negative effect on the spatial repellency of metofluthrin.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the influence of nozzle configurations on spray drift and explain the influences using several atomization characteristics (length of <b>spray</b> <b>sheet,</b> <b>spray</b> angle, velocity distribution of flow field, fluctuation of velocity, and droplet size). Nozzles manufactured by one company (Lechler GmbH, Germany) were tested by spraying local tap water in a wind tunnel at an operating pressure of 0. 3 MPa and under room temperature. The nozzles tested were compact air-induction flat fan nozzles (IDK 120 - 02, IDK 120 - 03), standard flat fan nozzles (ST 110 - 02, ST 110 - 03), and hollow-cone swirl nozzles (TR 80 - 02, TR 80 - 03). The atomization process was recorded using a Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system, droplet size was measured by a Sympatec Helos laser-diffraction particle-size analyzer, and spray drift was evaluated in a wind tunnel with deposition measured using a calibrated fluorometer (Turner-Sequoia model 450). Results showed that spray drift was significantly different among nozzle types (P< 0. 0005) and that nozzle configurations influenced breakup length, spray angle, droplet size, and velocity. Nozzles producing larger droplet sizes had lower velocity. Smaller droplets were produced when longer and wider <b>spray</b> <b>sheets</b> were produced. Compared to ST and TR nozzles, IDK nozzles started to breakup in the center of the liquid sheet, producing droplets with larger diameter, lower velocity, and less velocity fluctuation. The IDK nozzle is a good choice for low spray drift at higher wind speeds...|$|R

The properties of these spray droplets {{can influence the}} effectiveness and risks {{associated with the use}} of pesticides. Initial spray characteristics (initial droplet size and velocity, fan angle and spray liquid density) were therefore measured for a range of hydraulic nozzles and spray mixtures. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) was used to measure the <b>spray</b> <b>sheet</b> velocity. There was a significant difference between a standard hydraulic nozzle, Turbo TeeJet® and air induction nozzle for all measured spray characteristics.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{method has}} been developed to model a high speed planing craft in waves with particular emphasis on the non-linearfties associated with high speed motion. These non-linearities include, amongst others, hydrodynamic impact loading, bottom emergence and forces due to large changes in wetted surface area and wetted length. The method consists of a 2 D time simulation model based on a modified stop theory approach. The hydrodynamic coefficients are usually considered to be constant for most linear applications. For planing craft in waves, the draft and wetted lengths are very time dependent and so the equations of motion are solved in the time domain. The benefits of a two-dimensional method include the ability to provide accurate solutions without the need to solve the full 3 D fluid problems. The method is flexible enough to include an added resistance solution and investigation into hydroolastic responses.

40|$|Abstract Background This {{study was}} part of the work to prepare for a cluster-randomized {{controlled}} trial to evaluate the effect of combining indoor residual spraying and long-lasting insecticidal nets on malaria incidence. A pilot study was done to estimate the variations of malaria incidence among villages, combined with entomological collections and an assessment of susceptibility to insecticides in malaria vectors. Methods A cohort of 5309 residents from four kebeles (the lowest government administrative unit) in 996 households was followed from August to December 2013 in south-central Ethiopia. Blood samples were collected by a finger prick for a microscopic examination of malaria infections. A multilevel mixed effect model was applied to measure the predictors of malaria episode. Adult mosquitoes were collected using light traps set indoors close to a sleeping person, pyrethrum <b>spray</b> <b>sheet</b> catches and artificial outdoor pit shelters. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were used to detect the sources of mosquito blood meals, while mosquito longevity was estimated based on parity. The World Health Organization’s tube bioassay test was used to assess the insecticide susceptibility status of malaria vectors to pyrethroids and carbamates. Results The average incidence of malaria episode was 4. 6 per 10, 000 person weeks of observation. The age group from 5 to 14  years (IRR =  2. 7; 95  % CI 1. 1 – 6. 6) and kebeles near a lake or river (IRR =  14. 2, 95  % CI 3. 1 – 64) were significantly associated with malaria episode. Only 271 (27. 3  %) of the households owned insecticide-treated nets. Of 232 adult Anopheles mosquitoes collected, Anopheles arabiensis (71. 1  %) was the predominant species. The average longevity of An. arabiensis was 14  days (range: 7 – 25 human blood index days). The overall human blood index (0. 69) for An. arabiensis was higher than the bovine blood index (0. 38). Statistically significant differences in Anopheline mosquitoes abundance were observed between the kebeles (P =  0. 001). Anopheles arabiensis was susceptible to propoxur, but resistant to pyrethroids. However, An. pharoensis was susceptible to all pyrethroids and carbamates tested. Conclusions This study showed a high variation in malaria incidence and Anopheles between kebeles. The observed susceptibility of the malaria vectors to propoxur warrants using this insecticide for indoor residual spraying, and the results from this study will be used as a baseline for the trial...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{the impact}} between a water surface and a {{structure}} is addressed in two related experiments. In the first experiment, {{the impact of}} a plunging breaking wave on a partially submerged 2 D structure is studied. The evolution of the water surface profiles are measured with with a cinematic laser-induced flourescence technique, while the pressure distribution on the wall is measured simultaneously with an array of fast-response pressure sensors. When the structure is placed at a particular streamwise location in the wave tank and the bottom surface of the structure is located 13. 3 ~cm below the mean water level, a ``flip-through'' impact occurs. In this case, the water surface profile between the crest and the front face of the structure is found to shrink to a point as the wave approaches the structure without breaking. High acceleration of the contact point motion is observed in this case. When the bottom of the structure is located at the mean water level, high-frequency pressure oscillations are observed. These pressure oscillations are believed to be caused by air that is entrapped near the wave crest during the impact process. When the bottom of the structure is sufficiently far above the mean water level, the first contact with the structure is the impact between the wave crest and the bottom corner of the structure. This latter condition, produces the largest impact pressures on the structure. In the second experiment, the slamming of a flat plate on a quiescent water surface is studied. A two-axis high-speed carriage is used to slam a flat plate on the water surface with high horizontal and vertical velocity. The above-mentioned LIF system is used to measure the evolution of the free surface adjacent to the plate. Measurements are performed with the horizontal and vertical carriage speeds ranging from zero to 6 m/s and 0. 6 to 1. 2 m/s, respectively, and the plate oriented obliquely to horizontal. Two types of splash are found, a spray of droplets and ligaments that is ejected horizontally from under the plate {{in the beginning of the}} impact process and a highly sloped <b>spray</b> <b>sheet</b> that is ejected later when the high edge of the plate moves below the water surface. Detailed measurements of these features are presented and simple models are used to interpret the data...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the thickness measurement of liquid <b>sheet</b> <b>spray.</b> Two types of liquid <b>sheet</b> <b>spray</b> were measured, i. e. the wall impingement spray and flat spray. The measurement {{was carried out}} by a light absorption method using He-Cd laser and diode laser. Figure 1 shows the experimental apparatus in this study. Moreover, the thickness change of the flat spray prior to the breakup point was further clarified from the movement of 4 -points of photochromic dye traces by using laser tagging method (See Fig. 2). In other words, the thickness data both from the light absorption method and laser tagging method was compared to clarify the characteristics of the breakup phenomena of liquid sheet. As can be seen in Fig. 3, there were two kinds of thickness change for both sprays. The first one shows the decreasing trend up until the breakup point. Another kind of change was the increasing trends of the thickness after having the decreasing trend. The reason for these phenomena {{can be attributed to the}} ligament formation in the liquid sheet as shown in the Fig. 4. In other words, the increasing trend re{{presents the}} moment when the 4 -points of dye traces accumulated into the ligament, while the decreasing trends indicates the moment when the dye traces were located in between two ligaments. Therefore, the change of liquid sheet thickness between two ligaments can be clarified by the laser tagging method, which is normally difficult to be achieved by using the light absorption method...|$|R
40|$|Interaction {{between two}} conical sheets of liquid formed by a coaxial swirl {{injector}} {{has been studied}} using water in the annular orifice and potassium permanganate solution in the inner orifice. Experiments using photographic techniques have been conducted to study {{the influence of the}} inner jet on outer conical <b>sheet</b> <b>spray</b> characteristics such as spray cone angle and break-up length. The core spray has a strong influence on the outer sheet when the pressure drop in the latter is low. This is attributed to the pressure variations caused by ejector effects. This paper also discusses the merging and separation behavior of the liquid sheets which exhibits hysteresis effect while injector pressure drop is varied...|$|R
40|$|It is very {{important}} to start and maintain the curing of concrete at the early age in hot weather environment. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the effect of curing by reviewing the various characteristics according to curing method in order to control the quality of floor slab concrete under hot weather environment. Concrete curing was performed through three kinds of method: water <b>spray</b> curing, <b>sheet</b> curing and non-curing. Especially in the case of water spray curing, the start time of watering was set different. As the result of experiments, Even if floor slab concrete is manufactured in hot weather, the temperature of concrete did not rise significantly in comparison with column concrete specimen. In addition, Experiment results indicate that water spray curing is effective on the compressive strength, neutralization and air permeability. On the other hand, the characteristic difference of floor slab concrete according to curing method was not significant under standard weather environment. In addition, it was confirmed that the water curing within a few hours of placing is effective in order to satisfy both the strength and durability of concrete under hot weather environment...|$|R
6000|$|And {{the last}} night of the seven was the stormiest of all. There was no thunder, no noise but the {{pounding}} bows of the ship, the keen whistling of the gale through the cordage, and the rush of the seething waters. But the vessel climbed aloft as if she would climb to heaven--then paused an instant that seemed a century and plunged headlong down again, as from a precipice. The <b>sheeted</b> <b>sprays</b> drenched the decks like rain. The blackness of darkness was everywhere. At long intervals a flash of lightning clove it with a quivering line of fire that revealed a heaving world of water where was nothing before, kindled the dusky cordage to glittering silver, and lit up the faces of the men with a ghastly luster! ...|$|R
40|$|Graded {{distributions}} of copper particles in ultrafine-grained aluminium sheets {{are produced by}} accumulative roll bonding and particle reinforcement. The metallic copper particles are <b>sprayed</b> on the <b>sheet</b> surfaces under variation of spray distance and/or relative velocity of the spray gun to the sheet. Therewith, the particle content could be varied {{by a factor of}} three. After solutionizing, the successful gradation is clearly proven by tensile tests showing a steady and monotonous gradient along the rolling direction. By a systematic analysis of the spraying process, the particle content profile is calculated. Accuracy of the calculation is confirmed by electrical resistivity measurements. The presented method enables the production of tailored sheets by graded particle reinforcement. The graded sheets are also used for basic investigation of materials properties along graded compositions...|$|R
