5|$|A {{prototype}} of the automatic strobe unit was produced in October, along with a new Mk. IVA-like radar unit with a manual strobe for testing. EMI was then asked to provide another breadboard {{prototype of}} the strobe unit for air testing, which was delivered on 12 October. A raft of problems were found and addressed. Among these, {{it was found that}} the strobe would often stick to the ground reflection, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> did not, would not stick until it had a strong signal at shorter ranges, or might stick to the wrong target. Eventually a panacea button was added to unstick the strobe in these cases.|$|E

5|$|A {{urinary tract}} {{infection}} (UTI) is an infection that affects part of the urinary tract.

Symptoms from a lower urinary tract include pain with urination, frequent urination, and feeling the need to urinate despite having an empty bladder. Symptoms of a kidney infection include fever and flank pain usually in addition to the symptoms of a lower UTI. Rarely the urine may appear bloody. In the very old and the very young, symptoms may be vague or non-specific.|$|E
5|$|After these conversions, Augustine sent Laurence back to Rome with {{a report}} of his success, along with {{questions}} about the mission. Bede records the letter and Gregory's replies in chapter 27 of his Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum; {{this section of the}} History is usually known as the Libellus responsionum. Augustine asked for Gregory's advice on a number of issues, including how to organise the church, the punishment for church robbers, guidance on who was allowed to marry whom, and the consecration of bishops. Other topics were relations between the churches of Britain and Gaul, childbirth and baptism, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> was lawful for people to receive communion and for a priest to celebrate mass.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1904 {{he built}} the Chalet de Catllaràs, in La Pobla de Lillet, for the Asland cement factory, owned by Eusebi Güell.

This building fell into ruin when the cement works closed, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> was eventually restored its appearance was radically altered, the ingenious original staircase being replaced with a simpler metal one. In the same area he created the Can Artigas Gardens between 1905 and 1907, in an area called Font de la Magnesia, commissioned by the textile merchant Joan Artigas i Alart; men who had worked the Park Güell were also involved on this project, similar to the famous park in Barcelona.|$|E

5|$|Brown {{thinks that}} no matter where it is speculated to be, if Planet Nine exists, then its mass is higher than what is {{required}} to clear its feeding zone in 4.6 billion years, and thus that it dominates {{the outer edge of}} the Solar System, which is sufficient to make it a planet by current definitions. Using a metric based on work by Jean-Luc Margot, Brown calculated that only at the smallest size and farthest distance was it on the border of being called a dwarf planet. Margot himself says that Planet Nine satisfies the quantitative criterion for orbit-clearing developed by him in 2015, and that according to that criterion, Planet Nine will qualify as a planet—if <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> is detected.|$|E
5|$|Cylinders {{should not}} be left {{standing}} unattended unless secured {{so that they can}} not fall in reasonably foreseeable circumstances as an impact could damage the cylinder valve mechanism, and conceivably fracture the valve at the neck threads.

On 17 or 18 September, Drusus was sent to deal with the troops in Illyricum, and a delegation was sent to confer proconsular imperium maius upon Germanicus, who dealt with the situation on the Rhine.

5|$|Dry air {{and land}} {{weakened}} the tropical wave, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> entered {{the area of}} the Bay of Campeche, it merged with a stationary frontal boundary.

A large high pressure system over the northern Gulf of Mexico forced the system southward, where it developed significant convection.

5|$|Due to an overcommitment of {{resources}} {{early in the}} war, the Australian economy suffered badly from manpower shortages as early as 1942. As a result, the government began the demobilisation process before the war was even over, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> had finally come to an end, the government was necessarily very keen for the demobilisation process to be completed as quickly as possible.

5|$|During {{construction}} of the Voss Line from Bergen to Voss, there was a proposal to extend the line from Voss to Granvin on the Hardangerfjord.

Some people wanted the line to be a tramway <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> was passed by the Parliament of Norway on 12 July 1919; the plans incorporated some elements of a tramway, giving the line a lower standard than the mainline. The railway was to be built electrified, and construction started in 1921. However, {{there was a lack of}} engineers, forcing a slow pace.
