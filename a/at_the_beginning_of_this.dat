5|$|The proto-Scotland landmass moved northwards, {{and from}} 460–430 Ma, sandstone, {{mudstone}} and limestone were {{deposited in the}} area that is now the Midland Valley. This occurred in shallow tropical seas at the margins of the Iapetus Ocean. The Ballantrae Complex near Girvan was formed from this ocean floor and is similar in composition to rocks found at The Lizard in Cornwall. Nonetheless, northern and southern Britain were far apart <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> period, although the gap began to close as the continent of Avalonia broke away from Gondwana, collided with Baltica and drifted towards Laurentia. The Caledonian orogeny began forming a mountain chain from Norway to the Appalachians. There was an ice age in the southern hemisphere, and the first mass extinction of life on Earth took place {{at the end of this}} period.|$|E
5|$|With a few exceptions, {{the farther}} a planet or belt {{is from the}} Sun, the larger the {{distance}} between its orbit and the orbit of the next nearer object to the Sun. For example, Venus is approximately 0.33 AU farther out from the Sun than Mercury, whereas Saturn is 4.3 AU out from Jupiter, and Neptune lies 10.5 AU out from Uranus. Attempts {{have been made to}} determine a relationship between these orbital distances (for example, the Titius–Bode law), but no such theory has been accepted. The images <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> section show the orbits of the various constituents of the Solar System on different scales.|$|E
5|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> {{period the}} {{boundaries}} of Alba contained only {{a small proportion of}} modern Scotland. Even when these lands were added to in the tenth and eleventh centuries, the term Scotia was applied in sources only to the region between the River Forth, the central Grampians and the River Spey and only began to be used to describe all of the lands under the authority of the Scottish crown from {{the second half of the}} twelfth century. By the late thirteenth century when the Treaty of York (1237) and Treaty of Perth (1266) had fixed the boundaries with the Kingdom of the Scots with England and Norway respectively, its borders were close to the modern boundaries. After this time both Berwick and the Isle of Man were lost to England, and Orkney and Shetland were gained from Norway in the fifteenth century.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} Paleogene period between 63 and 52 Ma, the last {{volcanic}} {{rocks in the}} British Isles were formed. As North America and Greenland separated from Europe, the Atlantic Ocean slowly formed. This led to a chain of volcanic sites west of mainland Scotland including on Skye, the Small Isles and St. Kilda, in the Firth of Clyde on Arran and Ailsa Craig and at Ardnamurchan. Sea levels began to fall, {{and for the first}} time the general outline of the modern British Isles was revealed. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> period the climate was sub-tropical and erosion was caused by chemical weathering, creating characteristic features of the Scottish landscape such as the topographical basin of the Howe of Alford near Aberdeen. The vegetation of the period is known from Paleocene sedimentary deposits on Isle of Mull. The rich flora here included temperate-climate tree species such as plane, hazel, oak, Cercidiphyllum, Metasequoia and ginkgo.|$|E

25|$|While primary chloroplasts have {{a double}} {{membrane}} from their cyanobacterial ancestor, secondary chloroplasts have additional membranes outside of the original two, {{as a result of}} the secondary endosymbiotic event, when a nonphotosynthetic eukaryote engulfed a chloroplast-containing alga but failed to digest it—much like the cyanobacterium <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> story. The engulfed alga was broken down, leaving only its chloroplast, and sometimes its cell membrane and nucleus, forming a chloroplast with three or four membranes—the two cyanobacterial membranes, sometimes the eaten alga's cell membrane, and the phagosomal vacuole from the host's cell membrane.|$|E

25|$|Several tinamou fossils {{have been}} found in the 16–17 Mya Early-Middle Miocene Santa Cruz Formation and the contemporary, or {{slightly}} older, Pinturas Formation, in Santa Cruz Province of Argentinian Patagonia, including a tinaminid, Crypturellus reai. Associated fossils indicate that the local palaeoenvironment <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> period was characterised by a humid, subtropical climate, with forest vegetation, becoming drier and more open with time. Some of the tinamou fossil material appears to be intermediate between the two subfamilies, suggesting that the period coincides with the origins of the radiation of the Nothurinae into the expanding open-country habitats.|$|E
