5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows. The animal's sense organ is altered when it detects an object. This causes a perceptual {{change in the}} animal's seat of sensation, which Aristotle {{believed}} was the heart, not as we now think the brain. This in turn causes <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> heart's heat, which causes a quantitative change sufficient to make the heart transmit a mechanical impulse to a limb, which moves, moving the animal's body. The alteration {{in the heat of}} the heart also causes <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> consistency of the joints, which helps the limb to move.|$|E

It is believed that less-entrenched streams in the region shifted to a more north-flowing drainage pattern in response to <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tilt of the surrounding terrain. The west-flowing Gunnison, however, was essentially trapped in the hard Precambrian rock of the Black Canyon and could not change its course.|$|E

5|$|English has {{two primary}} tenses, past (preterit) and non-past.

Since Ken Adam was busy with the film Pennies from Heaven, Peter Lamont, who had worked in the art department since Goldfinger, was promoted to production designer. Following a suggestion from Glen, Lamont created realistic sets, instead of the elaborate scenery for which the series had been known.|$|E
5|$|Gamma decay: {{this process}} results from <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> energy {{level of the}} nucleus to a lower state, {{resulting}} in the emission of electromagnetic radiation. The excited state of a nucleus which results in gamma emission usually occurs following the emission of an alpha or a beta particle. Thus, gamma decay usually follows alpha or beta decay.|$|E

The phase {{difference between the two}} beams results in <b>a</b> <b>change</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> intensity of the light on the detector. The resulting intensity of the light after mixing of these two beams is measured, or the pattern of interference fringes is viewed or recorded. Most of the interferometers discussed in this article fall into this category.|$|E
