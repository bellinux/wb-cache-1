50|$|Due {{to lack of}} {{passengers}} the route was closed and the buses transferred to the new <b>A-bus</b> line 11A on October 24, 2010.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the large}} side, the 3B4000 (1986) {{was the first}} [...] "snugly coupled" [...] {{multiprocessor}} (the [...] "network in a box"), containing the <b>A-BUS</b> which supported 16 large single-board computer (SBC) circuit panels, and featured the first SVR4 distributed UNIX kernel (codenamed [...] "Apache", {{nothing to do with}} the open source project started in the 1990s). Although the SBCs did not share address space, the UNIX kernel was distributed across all SBCs in a single virtual image.|$|E
50|$|There {{are five}} main bus {{companies}} operating across the Greater Bristol area. They are First, National Express, <b>A-Bus,</b> Bugler's and Wessex Connect. They provide services around Bristol and in to South Gloucestershire. The University of the West of England sponsors bus services (ULink) {{open to the}} public throughout the year, which are operated by Wessex Connect. National Express provides services including London, Plymouth, Glasgow and Swansea. Megabus run services to London, Newport and Cardiff. City Sightseeing Bristol operate tourist buses from all year except January.|$|E
50|$|A compute drawer {{consists}} of two sets of three PU chips and one Storage Controller chip (SC chip). Even though each PU chip has 128 MB L3 cache shared by the 10 cores and other on-die facilities, the SC chip adds 672 MB off-die eDRAM L4 cache shared by the six PU chips in the drawer. The SC chips also handle the communications between the sets of three PU in the drawer as well as communications between drawers using the <b>A-Bus.</b> The SC chip is manufactured on the same 14 nm process as the z14 PU chips, has 17 metal layers, similarly measures 25.3 × 27.5 mm (696 mm2), but {{consists of}} 9.7 billion transistors due to amount of L4 memory and runs at half the clock frequency of the PU chip.|$|E
40|$|Since the Chek Lap Kok (CLK) Hong Kong International Airport debuted on 6 July 1998 ground {{trips to}} the airport have {{undergone}} drastic changes. A number of transit modes are provided to connect the new airport with the territory, including these major ones: the Airport Express Line (AEL), the Air bus (or <b>A-bus),</b> the External Bus (or E-bus) and taxis. All of these transit services are operated by profit-driven businesses. Currently, the Hong Kong government imposes fare control on the bus services and taxi fares while the rail service (e. g., AEL) is immune to such control. Lo et al (1999) have studied the impact of deregulating this policy of fare control, allowing the buses operators to compete freely in a non-cooperative manner. This paper will study the impact that the taxis or some illegally hired vehicles violate the fare control and join the non-cooperative competition...|$|E
40|$|Movia’s A-buslines are {{the fastest}} way to get around Copenhagen by bus. Leaving several stops with high frequencies, the <b>A-bus</b> {{efficiently}} transports people from A to B, without them having to transport themselves. Despite leaving with high frequencies, severe mobility problems causing the bus to que up, hurt its reputation as a reliable form of transport. This paper examines the optimal and expected frequencies, by which users can expect the bus to leave certain pivotal stops on it’s route. By observing busses in peak hours of transportation, the paper continues to analyze on key issues concerning mobility. Bringing in conceptual framework by Paul Virilio and John Urry, the paper identifies essential mobility issues from a bus users point of view, in search of solutions to overcoming critical hurdles. Through document analysis and surveys we seek to evaluate on the concept for the busses and whether it compliments the users flexibility and life cycle. Ultimately we attempt to locate causes of the problems, where to place responsibility and lastly how to overcome said issues...|$|E
