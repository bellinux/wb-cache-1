This is similar to the Jain Pancha-Namaskara Mantra, in which three more entities <b>are</b> <b>invoked</b> <b>in</b> addition to the Arihants and the Siddhas. The inscription also mentions that Kharavela brought back an idol of Agrajina to Kalinga. Many historians identify Agrajina with Rishabha, the first Jain tirthankara. Kharavela is thus believed to be a follower of Jainism. However, the Jain records do not mention Kharavela.|$|E
500|$|Lamashtu is a {{historically}} older image that left {{a mark on}} the figure of Lilith. Many incantations invoke her as a malicious [...] "Daughter of Heaven" [...] or of Anu, and she is often depicted as a terrifying blood-sucking creature with a lion's head and {{the body of a}} donkey. Akin to Lilitu, Lamashtu primarily preyed on newborns and their mothers. She was said to watch pregnant women vigilantly, particularly when they went into labor. Afterwards, she would snatch the newborn from the mother to drink its blood and eat its flesh. In the Labartu texts she is described; [...] "Wherever she comes, wherever she appears, she brings evil and destruction. Men, beasts, trees, rivers, roads, buildings, she brings harm to them all. A flesh-eating, bloodsucking monster is she." [...] Gallu was a demon closely associated with Lilith, though the word (like [...] "Utukku") is also used as a general term for demons, and these are [...] "evil Uttuke" [...] or [...] "evil Galli". One incantation tells of them as spirits that threaten every house, rage at people, eat their flesh, and as they let their blood flow like rain, they never stop drinking blood. Lamashtu, Lilitu, and Gallu <b>are</b> <b>invoked</b> <b>in</b> different amulet texts, with Gallu showing up in Graeco-Byzantine myth as Gello, Gylo, or Gyllo. There she appears as a child-stealing and child-killing female demon, in the manner of Lamia and Lilith.|$|E

2500|$|The Roman Catholic Church commemorates {{him as a}} saint, {{along with}} Elizabeth, on September 23. He is also venerated as a prophet in the Calendar of Saints of the Lutheran Church on September 5. The Eastern Orthodox Church also celebrates the feast day of Zechariah on September 5, {{together}} with Elizabeth, who is considered a matriarch. Zechariah and Elizabeth <b>are</b> <b>invoked</b> <b>in</b> several prayers during the Orthodox Mystery of Crowning (Sacrament of Marriage), as the priest blesses the newly married couple, saying [...] "Thou who didst... accept Zechariah and Elizabeth, and didst make their offspring the Forerunner..." [...] and [...] "...bless them, O Lord our God, as Thou didst Zechariah and Elizabeth...". In the Greek Orthodox calendar, Zechariah and Elizabeth are also commemorated on June 24.|$|E
2500|$|He is {{the patron}} saint of those in the {{hospitality}} industry. The Eastern Orthodox Church commemorates him as the [...] "Righteous Forefather Abraham", with two feast days in its liturgical calendar. The first time is on 9 October (for those churches which follow the traditional Julian Calendar, 9 October falls on 22 October of the modern Gregorian Calendar), where he is commemorated together with his nephew [...] "Righteous Lot". The other is on the [...] "Sunday of the Forefathers" [...] (two Sundays before Christmas), when he is commemorated together with other ancestors of Jesus. Abraham is also mentioned in the Divine Liturgy of Saint Basil the Great, just before the Anaphora, and Abraham and Sarah <b>are</b> <b>invoked</b> <b>in</b> the prayers said by the priest over a newly married couple.|$|E
60|$|The coolies of Dr. Campbell's {{party were}} {{completely}} knocked {{up by the}} rarified air; they had taken a whole day to march here from Yeumtso, scarcely six miles, and could eat no food at night. A Lama of our party offered up prayers* [All diseases are attributed by the Tibetans to the four elements, who are propitiated accordingly in cases of severe illness. The winds <b>are</b> <b>invoked</b> <b>in</b> cases of affections of the breathing; fire in fevers and inflammations; water in dropsy, and diseases whereby the fluids are affected; and the God of earth when solid organs are diseased, as in liver-complaints, rheumatism, etc. Propitiatory offerings are made to the deities of these elements, but never sacrifices.] to Kinchinjhow for the recovery of a stout Lepcha lad (called Nurko), who {{showed no signs of}} animation, and had all the symptoms of serous apoplexy. The Lama perched a saddle on a stone, and burning incense before it, scattered rice to the winds, invoking Kinchin, Donkia, and all the neighbouring peaks. A strong dose of calomel and jalap, which we poured down the sick lad's throat, contributed materially to the success of these incantations.|$|E

50|$|Oxidative {{addition}} and {{reductive elimination}} <b>are</b> <b>invoked</b> <b>in</b> many catalytic processes both in homogeneous catalysis (i.e., in solution) {{such as the}} Monsanto process and alkene hydrogenation using Wilkinson's catalyst.

Metals are however characterised by band structures, so oxidation states are not meaningful. Oxidative addition is also needed in order for nucleophilic addition of an alkyl group to occur. Oxidative insertion is also a crucial step in many cross-coupling reactions like the Suzuki coupling, Negishi coupling, and the Sonogashira coupling.|$|E
