5000|$|The {{roadshow}} faced a [...] "rough start" [...] initially.

500|$|Asashōryū {{received}} {{criticism from}} Sumo Association {{officials and the}} media throughout his yokozuna career for various other infractions of the strict code of conduct expected of top sumo wrestlers, both on the dohyō and off it. His breaches of etiquette during tournament bouts ranged from merely accepting the prize money with the wrong hand, and raising his arms in victory after clinching the championship, to giving opponents an extra shove after the bout was already over (such as Hakuhō in May 2008), and appealing to judges to overturn the referee's decision. In July 2003, he pulled on fellow Mongolian Kyokushūzan's mage (traditional Japanese top knot) during their bout on day five of the tournament, resulting in an immediate hansoku-make, or disqualification. He was the first yokozuna to be disqualified from a bout. They reportedly brawled in the communal bath afterwards, and Asashōryū was also accused of breaking the wing mirror of Kyokushūzan's car. Some Japanese fans called on him to [...] "go back to Mongolia" [...] after this incident. During the same year, Asashōryū was taking interviews from journalists when he called a Korean journalist a , sparking controversy within South Korean newspapers. He also had an uneasy relationship with his stablemaster Takasago. In July 2004, he apologized after a row with Takasago over his wedding arrangements resulted in him being seen drunk in public and damaging stable property, and his tendency to return to Mongolia without informing his stablemaster led to embarrassments like being unable to attend the funeral of Takasago stable's previous head coach Fujinishiki in December 2003. He was also sometimes seen in public in <b>a</b> <b>business</b> <b>suit</b> or in casual dress instead of the traditional kimono that wrestlers are expected to wear.|$|E
500|$|This {{theme of}} absence was {{reflected}} in the ideas produced by his long hours spent brainstorming with the band. [...] Thorgerson had noted that Roxy Music's Country Life was sold in an opaque green cellophane sleeve – censoring the cover image – and he copied the idea, concealing the artwork for Wish You Were Here in a black-coloured shrink-wrap (therefore making the album art [...] "absent"). [...] The concept behind [...] "Welcome to the Machine" [...] and [...] "Have a Cigar" [...] suggested the use of a handshake (an often empty gesture), and George Hardie designed a sticker containing the album's logo of two mechanical hands engaged in a handshake, to be placed on the opaque sleeve (the mechanical handshake logo would also appear on the labels of the vinyl album this time in a black and blue background). [...] The album's cover images were photographed by Aubrey 'Po' Powell, Storm's partner at the Pink Floyd design studio Hipgnosis and was inspired by the idea that people tend to conceal their true feelings, for fear of [...] "getting burned", and thus two businessmen were pictured shaking hands, one man on fire. [...] "Getting burned" [...] was also a common phrase in the music industry, used often by artists denied royalty payments. [...] Two stuntmen were used (Ronnie Rondell and Danny Rogers), one dressed in a fire-retardant suit covered by <b>a</b> <b>business</b> <b>suit.</b> [...] His head was protected by a hood, underneath a wig. [...] The photograph was taken at the Warner Bros. studios in Los Angeles. [...] Initially the wind was blowing in the wrong direction, and the flames were forced into Rondell's face, burning his moustache. [...] The two stuntmen changed positions, and the image was later reversed.|$|E
