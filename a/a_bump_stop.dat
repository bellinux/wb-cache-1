40|$|The {{performance}} of piezoelectric cantilever beam energy harvesters subjected to base excitation is considered in this work. Based on the linear assumption, a theoretical model is developed {{to predict the}} mechanical and electrical responses of the harvester and in comparison to other theoretical models, more accurate mode shape functions are used for the structural part of the harvester. The model is validated against experimental measurements and parameter studies are carried out to investigate the maximum power output in different situations. In some applications, like powering tyre pressure monitoring sensors (TPMS), energy harvesters are subjected to large amplitude shocks {{and high levels of}} acceleration, which can cause large bending stresses to develop in the beam, leading to mechanical failure. In this work, <b>a</b> <b>bump</b> <b>stop</b> is introduced in the energy harvester design to limit the amplitude of vibration and prevent large amplitude displacement. A theoretical model is developed to simulate the energy harvester impacting a stop, and the model is used to investigate how the electrical output of the harvester is affected by the stop. The work demonstrates how the model {{can be used as a}} design tool for analysing the compromise between the electrical output and structural integrity. Nonlinear behaviour of the energy harvester is observed to have a significant effect on the resonance frequencies when the harvester is subjected to large amplitude base accelerations. To correctly predict the behaviour of the harvester, piezoelectric material nonlinearity and geometric nonlinearity are incorporated in the theoretical model. It is found that the nonlinear softening effect is dominated by the material nonlinearity, while the geometric nonlinearity is less significant. The nonlinear energy harvester model is used in conjunction with the bump stop and results obtained using the linear and nonlinear models are compared to experimental measurements to investigate the importance of using a nonlinear model. The inclusion of nonlinear behaviour is shown to improve significantly the accuracy of predictions under some circumstances. The energy harvester models developed in this work are used to simulate the electrical power generated in a TPMS application, where the harvester embedded in the tyre is subjected to large radial accelerations as the tyre rolls along the road. The simulated results are compared to reported experimental work and agreement is found between the results. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|The studied <b>bump</b> <b>stop</b> is <b>a</b> hollow folded {{polyurethane}} cylinder mounted {{around the}} damper rod in a MacPherson front wheel suspension, restricting the upward wheel displacement. It {{is a critical}} component for durability since the force transfer through the <b>bump</b> <b>stop</b> determines the vertical peak loads to the car body. In extreme load cases as driving over <b>a</b> curb, the <b>bump</b> <b>stop</b> is subjected to impact loading giving a highly non-linear behavior. The nominal compressive strain can reach 80 % under a load duration of milliseconds. The presented model is based on impact test data. By performing drop tests, high load levels and short contact times can be combined, giving a realistic loading in view of road load data from the test track. The main objective of the model is to predict the behavior at high strain rates and strain levels. The strongly progressive behavior, shown in a stress strain diagram, {{both in terms of}} the loading curve and the hysteresis, requires special attention. The main feature of the model is a linear viscoelastic Maxwell model combined with a function that takes care of the strongly progressive behavior. This function, obtained from a dynamic loading curve in the impact test, is multiplied with the Maxwell stress, giving the sought progressive behavior. The model is accurate, simple to obtain from the impact test, computationally efficient, and easy to implement in commercial multi-body-system codes as ADAMS and can thus successfully be used in the product development of new cars...|$|R
40|$|<b>Bump</b> <b>stops</b> are {{components}} used in {{the truck}} chassis for the wheel suspension and cab suspension. Their main purpose {{is to reduce the}} impact between e. g. front axle and frame when the suspension bottoms. In these situations, the <b>bump</b> <b>stop</b> undergoes compressions with large deformations and high velocities. The dynamics of these components are difficult to describe since the material characteristics for rubber are highly non-linear. The simulation models that are available for the MBS software Adams are highly simplified and do not describe these events in a satisfactory manner. Hence the goal for this thesis work was to develop a simulation model for <b>bump</b> <b>stops</b> based on the results from dynamic testing. The simulation model uses the variables displacement and velocity to calculate the force being transferred through the <b>bump</b> <b>stop.</b> Four different <b>bump</b> <b>stops</b> were subjected to quasi-static and dynamic loading while the force and displacement were measured. The experiments were carried out in a hydraulic press and a test rig designed for this purpose where several weights were dropped onto the <b>bump</b> <b>stop</b> from different heights. A simulation model consisting of an elastic and a visco-elastic force response along with a rate-independent friction model was derived based on the experimental data. The model includes 14 parameters that can be identified through quasi-static and dynamic measurements of the particular component. A subroutine was written in order to implement the proposed model in Adams and a virtual model of the test rig was created. A number of dynamic simulations were performed in order to verify the model by comparing the results to experimental data. A FE-analysis was carried out on two of the tested <b>bump</b> <b>stops</b> and it was found that some of the <b>bump</b> <b>stop</b> characteristics could possibly be obtained without performing any experiments on physical components.
