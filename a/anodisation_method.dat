40|$|Nanoporous {{titanium}} dioxide (TiO 2) layers were successfully formed by an electrochemical <b>anodisation</b> <b>method</b> on microroughened titanium (Ti) surfaces in fluoride containing aqueous electrolyte. Microroughened Ti surfaces were produced by sandblasting with Al 2 O 3 particles of 50 μm {{in diameter and}} acid-etching in a blend of HCl/H 2 SO 4 solution. The surface morphology, topography and chemical composition of the specimens were analysed by scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The surface roughness and the wettability of treated Ti surfaces were measured using profilometry and a contact angle measurement system, respectively. With anodising of sandblasted-/acid etched surfaces, micrometre- and nanometre-scale textures on titanium specimens were created. Results showed that these developed nanoporous-microroughened surfaces exhibited lower contact angle values than the other treated Ti surfaces. The sandblasted/acid-etched/anodised Ti specimen had a surface morphology with distinctively formed hills and valleys and higher surface roughness than the other anodised specimens. This study indicated that nanoporous TiO 2 structures fabricated on microroughened Ti {{can be an effective}} way to modify the titanium surfaces for the future development of implant applications.

40|$|Anodic alumina nanohoneycombs (AAO) {{have been}} widely used because of its {{convenient}} fabrication and controllable pores’ geometry. A lot of investigations have been conducted to study its physical and chemical properties. However, the mechanical properties, especially tribological properties, of such a popular nanomaterial still remain almost unknown. In this project, a series of scratch experiments were conducted on AAO films fabricated by a two-step <b>anodisation</b> <b>method.</b> The testing system is a G 200 Nanoindenter provided by Agilent Corporation. A standard diamond Berkovich tip is used as the scratch tip. A scanning electron microscope was used to image the microstructure of the material deformation after scratching. Strengths of AAO domains with different pore regularities were compared by performing the scratch tests at constant normal loads crossing the boundaries separating these domains. Ramping load tests were carried out to show the effects of the normal load on the deformation and friction of the AAO. Scratch cycles and velocities were also varied to see their influence on friction and wear. The results show that the more ordered AAO structure has higher strength than disordered counterparts under scratch testing. The friction coefficient reduces rapidly on increasing normal load, and an explanation of this unusual behaviour is offered by considering the row-by-row deformation of the AAO structure. In multicycle scratch tests, the friction reaches a maximum at the fourth cycle. A step-like deformation behaviour was observed when the scratch velocity became extremely large, and this is probably due to the dynamic response of the instrument. published_or_final_versionMechanical EngineeringMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|TiO 2 {{thin films}} were {{fabricated}} on titanium substrates by the <b>anodisation</b> <b>method.</b> Different anodisation parameters, such as anodising voltage, electrolyte concentration and anodising time, {{have been investigated}} in order to explore their effects on the photocatalytic performance of the films. Regarding the effect of anodisation voltage, GAXRD analysis showed that anatase was the only oxide phase in the samples anodised at voltages from 100 to 200 V (at 10 min for 0. 2 M oxalic acid and current density 60 mA / cm^ 2). Data from Raman showed that anatase was present in all films and its intensity increased with increasing voltage. FESEM images showed that, at anodisation voltages of 10 - 20 V, a flat layer was formed, which became rougher with increasing voltage in the range 50 - 100 V. With further increase in the voltage to 120 - 200 V, increased porosity resulted. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed an increase in film thickness with increasing anodisation voltage. The photocatalytic performance showed that the activities increased with increasing anodisation voltage and hence thickness and roughness. With regard {{to the effect of}} varying electrolyte concentration, mineralogical analysis showed that anatase was the only phase present in the films (at 10 min for 0. 2, 0. 4 and 0. 6 M oxalic acid at 120 V and current density 60 mA / cm^ 2). However, there was an increase in the intensity of the Raman anatase peaks with increasing electrolyte concentration, which was confirmed by TEM analysis, which showed that the film thickness increased with increasing electrolyte concentration. FESEM analysis showed that the areal density of the pores and cracks increased with increasing electrolyte concentration. The photocatalytic performance showed that the activities with increasing electrolyte concentration. With regard to the effect of anodising time, GAXRD and Raman analysis showed that anatase was the only phase in all the films fabricated at different anodisation times (5, 10 and 20 minfor 0. 2 M oxalic acid at 200 V and current density 60 mA / cm^ 2). Further, the data showed that anatase peaks for both types of analysis increased with increasing anodising time. FESEM analysis showed that the diameter and areal density of the pores increased with increasing anodising time formed. Correspondingly there was an increase in the photocatalytic performance with increasing anodising time for the reasons mentioned above...|$|E
40|$|TiO_ 2 {{thin films}} {{prepared}} by CVD and <b>anodisation</b> <b>methods</b> and their {{applications for the}} photoelectrocatalytic and photocatalytic destruction of organic effluents are described in this thesis. The theoretical background of CVD, photoelectrocatalysis (PEC) and photocatalysis (PC) is introduced in Chapter 1. This chapter also contains an intensive literature review about TiO_ 2 thin film preparation, mainly by CVD, and about PEC and PC destruction of organic effluents by TiO_ 2 thin films. The experimental methods, which include CVD reactors, PEC cells and film characterisation and chemical analysis, are described in Chapter 2. The results for TiO_ 2 films deposited by LPCVD on SnO_ 2 coated glass using either TTIP or TTB precursors {{in the presence of}} O_ 2, with or without water as a reagent, are discussed in Chapter 3 for a small CVD reactor and Chapter 4 for a large reactor. The effects of precursor, water and annealing on the crystal structure of the films have been investigated and compared. It was found that phase transition temperatures for changes from amorphous to anatase and anatase to rutile with TTIP were higher than those obtained with TTB. Water also had an effect by decreasing the temperature for depositing crystalline films. The other kind of TiO_ 2 films prepared by anodisation of titanium mesh was studied and the results are presented in Chapter 5. PEC or PC destruction of MPA, RDX and 4 -CP have been studied using TiO_ 2 thin film anodes in small and large PEC reactors which are described in Chapter 6 and Chapter 7, respectively. PC destruction rates of organics are found to be improved significantly with an applied potential; i. e. by a PEC process. The effects of film properties, such as film crystallinity, thickness and film type on the PEC and PC efficiencies have been investigated. It was found that the different behaviour of films in PEC processes probably was due to surface effects rather than internal electric field differences. The extent of PEC and PC destruction of organics for CVD films was higher than for anodised films. The thesis concludes with an overall summary of the results and some suggestions for future work (Chapter 8).
