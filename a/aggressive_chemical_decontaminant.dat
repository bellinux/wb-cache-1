50|$|The {{introduction}} of Polypropylene drums permitted the routine commercial {{use of a}} range of highly corrosive chemicals in the tanning industry, for processes such as depilation and bleaching. In spite of the cheapness of the processes the chemicals they require are too aggressive for most practical choices of metal drums. ==Polypropylene drums for <b>aggressive</b> <b>chemical</b> processes== Polypropylene is a semi-crystalline thermoplastic with high bonding strength, tough, stable, elastic, hard and highly abrasion- and impact-resistant. Because of its chemical and physical molecular structure, solid masses of polypropylene are highly resistant {{to a wide range of}} <b>aggressive</b> <b>chemicals</b> including aqueous solutions of salts, acids and alkalis.Applying these characteristics to the demands of the tannery, professor Mario Serrini invented the first polypropylene drum in the 1990s and subsequently he exploited the attributes of the material to refine the technical advantages and performance of the tanning process.|$|R

50|$|A similar process (environmental stress cracking) {{occurs in}} polymers, when {{products}} {{are exposed to}} specific solvents or <b>aggressive</b> <b>chemicals</b> such as acids and alkalis.

On the other hand, polyesters are readily degraded by acids, and SCC is a likely failure mechanism. Polymers are susceptible to environmental stress cracking where attacking agents do not necessarily degrade the materials chemically.Nylon is sensitive to degradation by acids, {{a process known as}} hydrolysis, and nylon mouldings will crack when attacked by strong acids.|$|R

25|$|The {{aluminum}} oxide serves as dielectric and also protects the metallic aluminum against <b>aggressive</b> <b>chemical</b> reactions from the electrolyte. However, the converted layer of {{aluminum oxide}} {{is usually not}} homogeneous.

For this reason, {{in the formation of}} the anode foil, the oxide film is structured by a special chemical treatment so that either an amorphous oxide or a crystalline oxide is formed. The amorphous oxide variety yields higher mechanical and physical stability and fewer defects, thus increasing the long term stability and lowering the leakage current.|$|R
