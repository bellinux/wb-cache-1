25|$|Authorization: The {{cardholder}} {{presents the}} card as payment to the merchant and the merchant submits the transaction to the acquirer (<b>acquiring</b> <b>bank).</b> The acquirer verifies {{the credit card}} number, the transaction type and the amount with the issuer (card-issuing bank) and reserves that amount of the cardholder's credit limit for the merchant. An authorization will generate an approval code, which the merchant stores with the transaction.|$|E
40|$|In an era {{of rapid}} {{consolidation}} in banking, the effect of mergers {{on the availability of}} credit to agricultural businesses is unclear. Commercial bank mergers have profoundly altered the urban credit marketplace and are positioned {{to do the same for}} the agricultural credit marketplace. Adjustment models are estimated with data on independent bank consolidations from 1988 through 1995. The regression results bode well for agricultural lending if <b>acquiring</b> <b>banks</b> have larger concentrations of assets in agriculture than <b>acquired</b> <b>banks.</b> Conversely, if <b>acquiring</b> <b>banks</b> have smaller concentrations than <b>acquired</b> <b>banks,</b> acquisitions have a negative impact on agricultural lending. Since most <b>acquiring</b> <b>banks</b> have smaller agricultural loan concentrations than <b>acquired</b> <b>banks,</b> there is concern for agricultural lending.

25|$|Electronic {{verification}} systems allow merchants {{to verify}} {{in a few}} seconds that the card is valid and the cardholder has sufficient credit to cover the purchase, allowing the verification to happen at time of purchase. The verification is performed using a credit card payment terminal or point-of-sale (POS) system with a communications link to the merchant's <b>acquiring</b> <b>bank.</b> Data from the card is obtained from a magnetic stripe or chip on the card; the latter system is called Chip and PIN in the United Kingdom and Ireland, and is implemented as an EMV card.|$|E
500|$|Financially, {{the paper}} {{continued}} {{to stay out}} of the red, but long-term trouble was on the horizon. [...] After Elisabeth Mills Reid died in 1931—after having given the paper $15 million over her lifetime—it was discovered that the elder Reid had treated the subsidies as loans, not capital investments. [...] The notes on the paper were willed to Ogden Reid and his sister, Lady Jean Templeton Reid Ward. [...] The notes amounted to a mortgage on the Herald Tribune, which prevented the newspaper from <b>acquiring</b> <b>bank</b> loans or securing public financing. [...] Financial advisors at the newspaper advised the Reids to convert the notes into equity, which the family resisted. [...] This decision would play a major role in the Reids' sale of the Herald Tribune in 1958.|$|E

50|$|In {{a credit}} card or debit card {{transaction}}, the card-issuing bank in a payment transaction deducts the interchange fee from the amount it pays the <b>acquiring</b> <b>bank</b> that handles a credit or debit card transaction for a merchant. The <b>acquiring</b> <b>bank</b> then pays the merchant {{the amount of the}} transaction minus both the interchange fee and an additional, usually smaller, fee for the <b>acquiring</b> <b>bank</b> or independent sales organization (ISO), which {{is often referred to as}} a discount rate, an add-on rate, or passthru. For cash withdrawal transactions at ATMs, however, the fees are paid by the card-issuing bank to the <b>acquiring</b> <b>bank</b> (for the maintenance of the machine).|$|E
50|$|The <b>acquiring</b> <b>bank</b> {{enters into}} a {{contract}} with a merchant and offers it a merchant account. This arrangement provides the merchant with a line of credit.

40|$|A {{considerable}} number of acquisitions {{have taken place in}} the ASEAN banking industry from the 1997 Asian financial crisis onwards. The trend raises the question as to what ex-ante factors motivate the involvement of banks in acquisitions, as existing literature indicates inconclusive benefits from M&As. As such, the study examines the determinants of acquisitions for 47 <b>acquired</b> <b>banks</b> and 33 <b>acquiring</b> <b>banks</b> in ASEAN from 2003 to 2011. Three logistic regressions are employed to identify the bank-specific and country-specific determinants of bank acquisitions. The results indicate that growth is an important determinant of bank acquisitions. Banks with higher growths are {{more likely to engage in}} acquisitions. Furthermore, <b>acquired</b> <b>banks</b> tend to have poorer performance in terms of lower profitability. Thus, the evidences support the inefficient management hypothesis and growth-resource hypothesis. The division of the sample into sub-samples reflects significant changes in the determinants of the likelihood of being acquired over different time periods. In the normal period prior to the financial crises, <b>acquired</b> <b>banks</b> are also found to have greater loan activities. Interestingly, asset quality and liquidity played important roles in determining the likelihood of being acquired in the period after the onset of the global financial crisis and the European sovereign debt crisis. On the other hand, <b>acquiring</b> <b>banks</b> are characterised by high growth. Larger banks with higher growth and greater profitability are also more likely to engage in acquisitions as <b>acquiring</b> <b>banks</b> rather than as <b>acquired</b> <b>banks.</b> Besides bank-specific determinants, external factors also drive bank acquisitions in ASEAN. This is evidenced by the significant influence of a country‟s economic freedom on the likelihood of engaging in acquisitions...|$|R

40|$|Credit {{markets in}} many Eastern European {{countries}} are now dominated by foreign-owned banks. We analyze the development for foreign ownership {{and its impact}} on lending rate in ten Eastern European countries between 1995 and 2003. Currently, the majority of loans from foreign banks is granted by <b>acquired</b> <b>banks.</b> The presence of foreign <b>acquired</b> <b>banks</b> as measured by their relative number among the banks in our dataset increased somewhat slower than that of foreign de novo banks. However, since market entry through acquisition allows acquiring a credit portfolio and a customer base, <b>acquired</b> <b>banks</b> were able to expand their market share much faster than the foreign de novo banks. Our results also show that the interest rate decreased after foreign bank entry. Moreover, while the reduction in interest rates of domestic banks is more pronounced in the case of foreign entry through a de novo investment, foreign de novo banks charge higher interest rates than foreign <b>acquired</b> <b>banks.</b> ...|$|R
