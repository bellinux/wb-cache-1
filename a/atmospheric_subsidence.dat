The cause of this subseasonal variation in the PM 2. 5 climatology is investigated through dynamical downscaling and large-scale diagnostics. Climatological analysis of the U.

We propose a classification according to several main ABL prototypes. Further, we performed {{a case study of}} a single day characterized as a convective boundary layer to analyse the influence of the dynamics on the chemical evolution of the ABL, using a systematic analysis that can easily be extended to other periods during HUMPPA-COPEC- 2010. We used a mixed layer model, initialized and constrained by observations. In particular, we investigated the role of large scale <b>atmospheric</b> dynamics (<b>subsidence</b> and advection) on the ABL development and the evolution of chemical species concentrations. We find that, if the large scale forcings are taken into account, the ABL dynamics are represented satisfactorily. Subsequently, we studied the impact of mixing with a residual layer aloft during the morning transition on atmospheric chemistry. The time evolution of NOx and O 3 concentrations, including morning peaks, can be explained and accurately simulated by incorporating the transition of the ABL dynamics from night to day. We demonstrate the importance of the ABL height evolution for the representation of atmospheric chemistry. Our findings underscore the need to couple the dynamics and chemistry at different spatial scales (from turbulence to mesoscale) in chemistry-transport models and in the interpretation of observational data...|$|R

The quality of coherence is often envisaged to be controlled substantially by the magnitude of baseline, wavelength and time span. However, weather conditions (i. e. rainfall) during SAR acquisitions would also cause pronounced effects on the coherence image. For this reason, this study evaluated the impacts of rainfall, and wind conditions in term of weather condition. This study demonstrated the effect of rainfall overwhelming those main factors conducted in Sydney of New South Wales and Gippsland Plain of Victoria at Australia. Differential InSAR was performed in advance to identify any <b>atmospheric</b> effect or <b>subsidence</b> events in the study area.

Comparatively speaking, under different environmental condition, a Tandem pair with shorter baseline did not definitely yield better coherence than another did in the given land cover. This might be by virtue of high rainfall record received during the acquisitions of that shorter baseline tandem pair. 1...|$|R

It is however possible to improve deformation analysis by tracking some natural or man-made objects with steady radar reflectivity, i. e., permanent scatterers (PS), in the frame of time series of SAR images acquired over the same area. For detecting land subsidence in Shanghai, China, this paper presents an attempt to explore an approach of PS-neighborhood networking SAR interferometry. With use of 26 ERS- 1 / 2 SAR images acquired 1992 through 2002 over Shanghai, the analysis of subsiding process in time and space is performed {{on the basis of a}} strong network which is formed by connecting neighboring PSs according to a distance threshold.

40|$|A {{multichannel}} singular {{spectrum analysis}} (MSSA) applied simultaneously to tropical sea surface temperature (SST), zonal wind, and burstiness (zonal wind variability) reveals three significant oscillatory modes. They all show a strong ENSO signal {{in the eastern}} Pacific Ocean (PO) but also a substantial SST signal in the western Indian Ocean (IO). A correlation-based analysis shows that the western IO signal contains linearly independent information on ENSO. Of the three Indo-Pacific ENSO modes of the MSSA, one resembles a central Pacific (CP) El Niño, while the others represent eastern Pacific (EP) El Niños, which either start in the central Pacific and grow eastward (EPe) or start near Peru and grow westward (EPw). A composite analysis shows that EPw El Niños are preceded by cooling in the western IO about 15 months earlier. Two mechanisms are discussed by which the western IO might influence ENSO. In the <b>atmospheric</b> bridge mechanism, <b>subsidence</b> over the cool western IO in autumn (year 0) leads to enhanced convection above Indonesia, strengthening easterlies over the western PO, {{and the creation of}} a large warm water volume. This is essential for the creation of (EP) El Niños in the following spring–summer. In the state-dependent noise mechanism, a cool western IO favors a strong intraseasonal zonal wind variability over the western PO in early spring (year 1), which can partly be attributed to the Madden–Julian oscillation. This intraseasonal variability induces Kelvin waves, which in early spring lead to a strong warming of the eastern PO and can initiate EPw El Niños...|$|R

The surface temperature in Medford is often influenced by the mountains, but the 850 millibar temperature, well off the surface, is about even with the mountain ridges in the area, and therefore unaffected.

Except during cyclone periods where delta O- 18 (v) is highly depleted (- 20. 5 %), a significant diurnal variability {{can be seen on}} both delta O- 18 (v) and q(v) with enriched (depleted) water vapor (mean delta O- 18 (v) is - 13. 4 % (- 16. 6 %)) and moist (dry) conditions (mean q(v) is 9. 7 g/kg (6. 4 g/kg)) during daytime (nighttime). We show that d 18 Ov diurnal cycle arises from mixing processes for 65 % of cases with two distinct sources of water vapor. We suggest that delta O- 18 (v) diurnal cycle is controlled by an interplay of thermally driven land-sea breezes and upslope-downslope flows, bringing maritime air to the observatory during daytime, whereas at night, the observatory is above the atmospheric boundary layer and samples free tropospheric air. Interestingly, delta O- 18 (v) record also shows that some nights (15 %) are extremely depleted (mean delta O- 18 (v) is - 21. 4 %). They are among the driest of the record (mean q(v) is 2. 9 g/kg).

The dynamic nature of the ocean is important, particularly for northern Australia where the long-term scatter due to daily and sub-daily oceanic changes increases by 20 – 55 % compared to that estimated using the inverted barometer (IB) assumption. Correcting the daily Global Positioning System (GPS) time series for NTOAL employing either a dynamic ocean model or the IB assumption leads to a reduction of up to 52 % in the weighted scatter of daily coordinate estimates. Differences between the approaches are obscured by seasonal variations in the GPS precision along the northern coast. Two compensating signals during the cyclone require modelling at high spatial and temporal resolution: uplift induced by the <b>atmospheric</b> depression, and <b>subsidence</b> induced by storm surge. The latter dominates (> 135 %) the combined net effect that reaches a maximum of 14 mm, and 10 mm near the closest GPS site TOW 2. Here, 96 % of the displacement is reached within 15 h due to the rapid transit of cyclones and the quasi-linear nature of the coastline. Consequently, estimating sub-daily NTOAL is necessary to properly account for such a signal that can be 3. 5 times larger than its daily-averaged value.

Lindzen said that predicted warming may be overestimated because of their handling of the climate system's water vapor feedback. The feedback due to water vapor {{is a major factor}} in determining how much warming would be expected to occur with increased atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, and all existing computer models assume positive feedback — that is, that as the climate warms, the amount of water vapour held in the atmosphere will increase, leading to further warming. By contrast, Lindzen believes that temperature increases will actually cause more extensive drying due to increased areas of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>subsidence</b> {{as a result of the}} Iris effect, nullifying future warming. This claim was criticized by climatologist Gavin Schmidt, Director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, who notes the more generally-accepted understanding of the effects of the Iris effect and cites empirical cases where large and relatively rapid changes in the climate such as El Nino events, the Ultra Plinian eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991, and recent trends in global temperature and water vapor levels to show that, as predicted in the generally-accepted view, water vapor increases as the temperature increases, and decreases as temperatures decrease.|$|E

AGCM simulations—with SSTs prescribed from climatological and El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) conditions—show substantial changes in circulation when CMT is added, such as an eastward shift of the climatological trade winds and west Pacific convection. The CMT also alters the ENSO wind anomalies by shifting them eastward and widening them meridionally, despite only subtle changes in the precipitation anomaly patterns. During ENSO, CMT affects the low-level winds mainly via the anomalous convection acting on the climatological westerly wind shear over the central Pacific—so that an eastward shift of convection transfers more westerly momentum toward the surface than would occur without CMT.

40|$|Stratocumulus clouds (SC) often exist {{over the}} eastern {{subtropical}} oceans {{during the summer}} and have significant impacts on the surface radiation budget. Both <b>atmospheric</b> <b>subsidence</b> and lower troposphere stability (LTS) have been found to play important roles in maintaining SC. Using global climate model simulations, we find that irrigation in California's Central Valley results in a decrease of land surface temperature, leading to a smaller land-sea heat contrast, and a corresponding reduction in sea breeze, subsidence, and LTS over the near-coastal region. The decrease in LTS directly drives a reduction in modeled SC coverage, and it would arguably do so in reality because of the well-known link between LTS and SC coverage. Consequently, simulated absorbed surface solar radiation over this region increases by 8 [*]W/m 2  (3. 7 %) due to the reduction in SC cover, resulting in the warming at the Earth's surface. This study has important implications for how SC can change with regard to future climate. In contrast to the general effects of climate change on the formation of SC, our results suggest that irrigation practices in the Central Valley may drive a decrease in nearby SC coverage...|$|E

For two selected high ozone episodes in April and May 2008, composite NCEP/NCAR reanalysis maps of various meteorological parameters and/or their anomalies (geopotential height, specific humidity, vertical wind velocity omega, vector wind speed and temperature) at various tropospheric pressure levels have been examined together with the corresponding satellite Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) ozone measurements (at 3 and 10  km), CHIMERE simulations, vertical ozone soundings and HYSPLIT back trajectories. The observations show that high ozone values are detected in several countries simultaneously over several days.

The tenuous clouds and sparse particulate matter in the relatively particle-free 5 -micron "hot spot" region of the Probe's descent were documented from about 0. 46 bars to about 12 bars. Three regions of apparent coherent structure were noted, in addition to many indications of extremely small particle concentrations along the descent path. From the first valid measurement at about 0. 46 bars down to about 0. 55 bars a feeble decaying lower portion of a cloud, corresponding with the predicted ammonia particle cloud, was encountered. A denser, but still very modest, particle structure was present in the pressure regime extending from about 0. 76 to a distinctive base at 1. 34 bars, and {{is compatible with the}} expected ammonium hydrosulfide cloud. No massive water cloud was encountered, although below the second structure, a small, vertically thin layer at about 1. 65 bars may be detached from the cloud above, but may also be water condensation, compatible with reported measurements of water abundance from other Galileo Mission experiments. A third small signal region, extending from about 1. 9 to 4. 5 bars, exhibited quite weak but still distinctive structure, and, although the identification of the light scatterers in this region is uncertain, may also be a water cloud perhaps associated with lateral atmospheric motion and/or reduced to a small mass density by <b>atmospheric</b> <b>subsidence</b> or other explanations. Rough descriptions of the particle size distributions and cloud properties in these regions have been derived, although they may be imprecise because of the small signals and experimental difficulties.

A regional continuous O 3 pollution episode was detected over the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region in China during 7 – 12  August 2013, {{in which the}} O 3 concentrations {{in more than half}} of the cities exceeded the national air quality standard. The maximum hourly concentration of O 3 reached 167. 1  ppb. By means of the observational analysis and the numerical simulation, the characteristics and the essential impact factors of the typical regional O 3 pollution are comprehensively investigated. The observational analysis shows that the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>subsidence</b> dominated by the western Pacific subtropical high plays a crucial role in the formation of high-level O 3. The favorable weather conditions, such as extremely high temperature, low relative humidity and weak wind speed, caused by the abnormally strong subtropical high are responsible for the trapping and the chemical production of O 3 in the boundary layer. In addition, when the YRD cities are at the front of Typhoon Utor, the periphery circulation of typhoon system can enhance the downward airflows and cause worse air quality. However, when the typhoon system weakens the subtropical high, the prevailing southeasterly surface wind leads to the mitigation of the O 3 pollution. The integrated process rate (IPR) analysis incorporated in the Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model is applied to further illustrate the combined influence of subtropical high and typhoon system in this O 3 episode. The results show that the vertical diffusion (VDIF) and the gas-phase chemistry (CHEM) are two major contributors to O 3 formation. During the episode, the contributions of VDIF and CHEM to O 3 maintain the high values over the YRD region. On 10 – 12 August, the cities close to the sea are apparently affected by the typhoon system, with the contribution of VDIF increasing to 28. 45  ppb h − 1 in Shanghai and 19. 76  ppb h − 1 in Hangzhou. In contrast, the cities far away from the sea can hardly be affected by the periphery circulation of typhoon system. When the typhoon system significantly weakens the subtropical high, the contribution values of all individual processes decrease to a low level in all YRD cities.

40|$|International audienceTropical islands, such as Reunion Island (21 °S, 55. 5 °E) in {{the southwestern}} Indian Ocean, have {{significant}} solar resource that is highly variable in both spatial and temporal scales because of heterogeneous and rapidly changing cloudiness. The characterization of this variability is essential to enhance penetration of solar energy systems, such as photovoltaic or thermal farms. This work focuses on the large-scale, meso-scale and local-scale variability in cloudiness and surface solar irradiance at different temporal scales. Vertical velocity at 500. hPa from ERA-Interim reanalyses are used to study large-scale subsidence. CALIPSO, MODIS and Meteosat- 7 satellite observations are used to study cloud properties and associated irradiances at the meso-scale. Solar irradiance measurements at seven Meteo-France stations around Reunion Island are used to investigate three meteorologically-distinct regions, namely the windward and leeward coasts, and the coasts parallel to the general trade wind direction. Day-to-day variations in daily irradiation values and diurnal-scale variability of solar irradiances are seasonally dependent. Winter seasons are characterized by large-scale <b>atmospheric</b> <b>subsidence</b> and broken low-level cloudiness, while in summer, clouds are found both at low and high altitudes. Three parameters are introduced to characterize solar irradiance diurnal cycle regimes. Five physically-sensible regimes are found, identified as clear, morning clear, overcast, afternoon clear, and random cloudiness. Regime occurrences have marked seasonal dependencies and vary significantly between the windward, leeward and lateral coasts. In winter and early summer, when cloudiness is driven predominantly by local (thermal, orographic) processes, the aggregated solar daily irradiation (average of the seven ground stations) remains near 80 % of the clear-sky irradiation. In late summer, this values drops below 65 % as large-scale overcast systems regularly affect the entire island. The station-to-station dis-correlation distance in terms of daily clear-sky index, defined as the distance for which the correlation coefficient drops to 0. 5, is 62. km in summer and 29. km in winter. For hourly clear-sky indexes, the station-to-station dis-correlation distances is 4 and 3. km, for summer and winter, respectively. Accordingly, aggregate analyses show that compensation effects are more important at hourly than daily time scales. The measurements also reveal that the atmosphere over the island tends to be clearer in the morning than in the afternoon while over the ocean surrounding the island, the opposite is true. These results provide insights and tools to help develop improved diurnal-scale solar irradiance forecast systems for tropical islands. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

First, up to 25 years (1988 - 2013) of climate data obtained from 11 weather stations located within the HaleNet climate network on Maui, Hawai‘i, were used to characterize the climate along a 2030 -m leeward and 810 -m windward elevation transect. Ten climate variables were assessed for trends occurring over the period of record at each station for the 6 -month dry (May-October) and wet (November-April) seasons. In general a drying trend was identified along both leeward and windward transects during the dry season. At the five highest elevation sites (2120 to 2990 m), significant increases in solar radiation (2 to 4 % decade- 1), vapor pressure deficit (9 to 10 % decade- 1), potential evapotranspiration (3 to 7 % decade- 1), {{and the number of}} zero rainfall days (4 to 5 % decade- 1), and significant decreases in relative humidity (- 3 to 5 % decade- 1), and rainfall (- 3 to - 8 % decade- 1) were identified at two or more of these sites over the period of record. Increases in Trade Wind Inversion (TWI) frequency of occurrence and or decreases in TWI base height were identified as potential agents driving these changes. A second part of this research is to test this hypothesis. To accomplish this, forty years (1973 - 2013) of radiosonde data obtained from the atmospheric sounding stations located at Hilo and Līhu‘e were used to calculate TWI frequency, base height and strength variability over time. Results indicate a 16 % average increase in TWI frequency of occurrence beginning in the early 1990 ’s. TWI frequency was significantly correlated with the vertical wind velocity variable “omega” obtained from 4 reanalysis data sets, suggesting that observed increases in TWI frequency are a result of increased <b>atmospheric</b> <b>subsidence</b> over the Hawai‘i region. Increased TWI frequency has resulted in 16 and 40 % average decreases in high elevation rainfall for the dry and wet seasons, respectively. The upward shift in TWI frequency is not explained by phase changes in the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) or the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Over shorter time periods, however, such as the post-TWI shift period (1991 - 2013), both ENSO and PDO indices were found to be significantly correlated with TWI frequency, but the sign of the relationship is opposite for the two season. The final component of this research is to identify the role that ENSO and PDO have on TWI frequency of occurrence on ~ 20 year time scales and to quantify the subsequent effects that TWI variability has on climate variables at mid and high elevations in Hawai‘i. Results show that, during the dry season, mean TWI frequency is higher during the cool phases of ENSO and PDO relative to the warm phases and an opposite relationship is observed in the wet season. Cool phase ENSO and PDO conditions that have dominated over the most recent period of record may help to explain a 4 % decade- 1 increase and a 2 % decade- 1 decrease in TWI frequency for the dry and wet seasons, respectively. The opposite response of TWI frequency during the dry and wet seasons helps to explain why high elevation energy and moisture regimes have opposite patterns of change within each season over the same period. The increase in TWI frequency explain some of the observed increases in solar radiation and decreases in rainfall and relative humidity observed at high elevations but much of the variability is still unaccounted for...|$|E
