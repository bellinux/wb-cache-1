5|$|Despite {{being located}} in remote Scapa Flow, Battleship Division Nine {{was unable to}} avoid a global killer that struck just as World War I was coming to a close. Spanish Influenza—which killed {{millions}} worldwide in 1918–1919—did not spare the Grand Fleet. By late fall, an average of seven men per day were dying of the virus throughout the Fleet, and some ships were so badly affected that they were practically unmanageable. Though they were not <b>as</b> <b>badly</b> hit {{as some of the}} British vessels, the American battleships were not immune. By early November, only Florida was not in quarantine, and Arkansas had 259 cases, with 11 deaths.|$|E
5|$|The global {{population}} was reduced {{by more than}} 99% during the 20th century. Most of {{this was in the}} Antarctic, which had been reduced to 360 individuals or about 0.15% of their original numbers; other populations were not <b>as</b> <b>badly</b> depleted. The Antarctic blue whale population is growing at the relatively rapid rate of about 7.3% per year, but it was hunted to such a low level that it remains at a tiny fraction of pre-whaling numbers. The {{global population}} still requires protection, but it is not in immediate danger of extinction.|$|E

5|$|Two rioters {{were hidden}} in Lakenheath by a {{labourer}} who eventually betrayed them for £5 each (£). One rioter, William Gotobed, a bricklayer, escaped and was eventually pardoned {{a few years}} later. He returned to Littleport after seven years {{and then went to}} America. The rioting spread to nearby areas such as Little Downham, Cambridgeshire, although such areas were not <b>as</b> <b>badly</b> affected. It took until 10 June before the areas were finally cleared of trouble and all of the rioters had been captured.|$|E
25|$|Annie feels {{guilty for}} {{injuring}} him <b>as</b> <b>badly</b> as she did, however. She attempts {{to apologize to}} him, but Selby calls her a vermin and rebuffs her apology.

25|$|Apart {{from the}} fact that it has not {{suffered}} <b>as</b> <b>badly</b> at the hands of later popularizers, the particular advantage of this matrix is that it highlights the assumptions that are hidden in the Growth-Share Matrix. It may also give a better feel for the optimum strategy and the likely profits, but it does not give any feel for the cash flow, which was the main feature of the original matrix.|$|E

25|$|Kansas City Industrial Airport {{was built}} after the Great Flood of 1951 {{destroyed}} the facilities {{of both of}} Kansas City's hometown airlines Mid-Continent Airlines and TWA at Fairfax Airport across the Missouri River from the city's main Kansas City Municipal Airport (which was not <b>as</b> <b>badly</b> damaged). TWA's main overhaul base was a former B-25 bomber factory at Fairfax, although TWA commercial flights flew out of the main downtown airport.|$|E
25|$|Many {{areas of}} the county were very much {{involved}} in the Tithe War (1831–36). This {{can be seen from}} the many people, from many {{areas of the}} county, included in the lists of those who refused to pay tithes, known as the Tithe Defaulter Schedules. County Wexford wasn't <b>as</b> <b>badly</b> affected as some other areas by the Famine in the 1840s, but it still had a major impact on the county.|$|E
25|$|Even {{from the}} {{earliest}} reports it was suspected that the signals were tests of an over-the-horizon radar, and this remained the most popular hypothesis during the Cold War. Several other theories were floated as well, including everything from jamming western broadcasts to submarine communications. The broadcast jamming theory was discarded early on when a monitoring survey showed that Radio Moscow and other pro-Soviet stations were just <b>as</b> <b>badly</b> affected by woodpecker interference as Western stations.|$|E

25|$|The 1996–97 season started just <b>as</b> <b>badly</b> as the last, {{with three}} {{straight}} losses. However, {{the introduction of}} young forward Andrew Fotiadis saw Luton burst into life, as they shot up {{the table with a}} run of eight wins and two draws in eleven games. Tony Thorpe, too, proved to be a revelation, scoring 28 goals to become the division's top scorer. Luton were nearly promoted, but finished in third place on goal difference and then lost to Crewe Alexandra in the play-offs.|$|E
25|$|At {{the next}} race in Belgium Trulli struggled, only {{being able to}} finish 16th, as his gearbox was damaged in a {{collision}} with Sébastien Bourdais' Toro Rosso on the first lap. Timo Glock, on the other hand, was doing <b>as</b> <b>badly</b> as Trulli until a few laps {{before the end of}} the race the rain came down. Glock changed to wet tyres, and was able to move up the order to 8th place. After the race, however, Glock was penalized 25-seconds for overtaking Mark Webber under yellow flags during the final lap of the race. The penalty pushed Glock to ninth place.|$|E
25|$|While {{the western}} {{portion of the}} Soviet Union had been <b>as</b> <b>badly</b> {{affected}} as {{any part of the}} world by the war, the eastern portion of the country was largely untouched and had seen a rapid industrialization during the war. The Soviets also imposed large reparations payments on the Axis allies that were in its sphere of influence. Austria, Finland, Hungary, Romania, and especially East Germany were forced to pay vast sums and ship large amounts of supplies to the USSR. These reparation payments meant the Soviet Union itself received about the same as 16 European countries received in total from Marshall Plan aid.|$|E

25|$|Al-Husayn's second {{campaign}} was to end <b>as</b> <b>badly</b> as the first. Once again the Turks defending the land between Baghdad and al-Anbar attacked the Baghdadi army. Al-Husayn {{was able to}} fight them off for several days, but eventually the Turks were able to outmaneuver him and rout the guards stationed on his flanks. When they attacked al-Husayn's army itself, they quickly defeated his men and overran his camp. Al-Husayn himself managed to escape on a river skiff, but a hundred of his men were killed and 170 had been taken prisoner, including several of the officers. Al-Husayn and the other survivors returned to Baghdad, {{and there were no}} further attempts to retake al-Anbar.|$|E
25|$|The post-cranial remains are <b>as</b> <b>badly</b> preserved, or worse, {{than the}} cranial elements, and their {{interpretation}} by Chatterjee {{are in many}} cases unsubstantiated or speculative. Of the postcranial skeleton, Chatterjee has isolated the axial skeleton as displaying a suite of avian characters, including heterocoelus centra, hypapophyses and reduction of the neural spines. First and foremost, the preservation quality of the vertebrae is poor. While the centra are modified, they {{do not appear to}} be truly heterocoelus. The presence of incipient hypapophyses in and of itself might be considered indicative of avian affinity, but their poor development and presence on vertebrae otherwise thoroughly non-avian, is most parsimoniously regarded as mild convergence until further material should be brought to light. The reduction of the neural spines is questionable.|$|E
25|$|The Communist radical {{of today}} will be the {{administrator}} of tomorrow, and the Communist Society will need the radical <b>as</b> <b>badly</b> as the capitalist society needs him now. It will then be {{the business of the}} radical, as it is now, not to take an appointment as justice of the Supreme Court, not to perform any particular function {{as a part of the}} established order, but to stand apart and speak his mind about the established order.... A radical who wishes to continue being a radical cannot do so if he is an essential part of the existing order, for then he owes a certain fealty to his position. I have seen Socialists elected to office; they become, not critical functionaries, but administrators, and one cannot be both at the same time.|$|E

50|$|The Lapua Movement {{started in}} 1929 and was {{initially}} dominated by anti-communist nationalists, emphasizing {{the legacy of}} the nationalist activism, the White Guards and the Civil War in Finland.

25|$|Consequently, the Australian Cricket Board {{refused to}} select players who {{had signed up}} with the rebel league, and {{as many of the}} Australian Test side had joined, the Australian side was left without most of its star players for the tour. Australian fast bowler Jeff Thomson had {{originally}} signed up for World Series Cricket, but an existing media contract prevented him from joining, and so he remained free to lead the Australian bowling attack. Eventually all but two of the squad would take part in WSC, the exceptions being Kim Hughes and Craig Serjeant. England was also affected, but not <b>as</b> <b>badly.</b> The English captain Tony Greig was stood down from the captaincy as punishment, but retained his place in the side. Mike Brearley replaced Greig as England captain. Despite reasonable returns the inexperienced Australians were outplayed, and England won the series 3–0 with two matches drawn. England therefore regained The Ashes {{for the first time since}} 1972.|$|E
25|$|As {{a policy}} of {{controlling}} and rewarding his generals, Mari Djata adopted their sons. These children were raised at the mansas court and became Keitas upon reaching maturity. Seeing the throne as their right, two adopted sons of Mari Djata waged a devastating war against one another that threatened to destroy what the first two mansas had built. The first son to gain the throne was Mansa Ouati Keita (also spelt Wati) in 1270. He reigned for four years, spending lavishly and ruling cruelly, according to the djelis. Upon his death in 1274, the other adopted son seized the throne. Mansa Khalifa Keita is remembered as even worse than Ouati Keita. According to the djelis, he governed just <b>as</b> <b>badly,</b> was insane and fired arrows {{from the roof of}} his palace at passers by. Ibn Khaldun recounts that the people rushed upon him and killed him during a popular revolt. The Gbara replaced him with Manding Bory Keita in 1275.|$|E
25|$|Torquay {{started their}} second {{season in the}} Conference Premier <b>as</b> <b>badly</b> as the first one had finished, picking up only 5 points from their opening 7 games. The {{following}} 3 months however were {{to be the best}} in years, as Torquay remained unbeaten from 7 September 2008 to 2 December 2008, setting a 17-game unbeaten record. They reached the FA Cup 3rd round with a 2–0 win over Oxford United at the end of November. The start of 2009 was shaky but on 3 January 2009 Torquay beat Blackpool 1–0 at home in the FA Cup 3rd round to reach the 4th round of the competition {{for the first time in}} 19 years where they faced Coventry City. They struggled for goals throughout January and against Coventry City with a sell out crowd of 6,018 they lost a game which they should have won; losing dramatically late on to an 87th-minute goal by Elliot Ward. At the end of the month they lost to Southport 3–0 in the FA Trophy 3rd round.|$|E
