Because of its importance and broad range, {{it has been the}} subject of numerous research studies and books. Simulation is about techniques for using computers to imitate (simulate) the operations of various kinds of real world complex systems. It has been an accepted tool for the improvement of decision making through learning how to deal with the complexity of the real world. The complexity slows the learning loop and reduces the learning gained on each cycle. This paper illustrates the importance of system thinking in enhancing the simulation process and providing the ability to see the world as a complex system, where “you cannot just do one thing ” and that “everything is connected to everything else”. It is a holistic worldview that enables people to act in consonance with the best interests of the system as a whole and thus enhance the learning loop through various system thinking tools.
