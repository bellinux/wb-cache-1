Because of {{the integration of}} long-stroke actuation and an active magnetic bearing, DQ-decomposition cannot be applied. Therefore, these actuators are a special class of synchronous machines. A newly developed model-based commutation algorithm for linear and planar actuators enables long-stroke motion by switching between different sets of coils.

The developed Rulebased Sensor Network (RSN) system provides network-centric communication and data processing {{with a very}} small footprint of necessary instructions.

In particular, we show the feasibility of data pre-processing mechanisms such as data aggregation as well as data-centric communication based on rules that are distributed throughout the entire network. The support of heterogeneous nodes is inherently integrated in terms of different hardware, e. g. sensors and actuators, and different data processing algorithms.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{inertial}} actuators can remove regenerative chatter in many milling processes. They are useful when active control techniques are needed and the use of passive dampers is not enough. Moreover, complex control laws can easily be implemented leading to large improvements. However, the main limitation of inertial actuators is that they can only be used in a particular range of frequencies. This limitation is due to a low frequency suspension mode, which only allows the actuator to work at larger frequencies than this suspension mode. This is an important drawback in many big milling machines where chatter appears close to this low frequency. This paper deals with this problem and shows a possible solution to avoid this limitation from a control point of view. Some real milling tests will be presented showing the usefulness of the technique. Keywords: Active damping, Chatter, Inertial <b>actuato...</b>|$|E
40|$|One of {{the great}} {{challenges}} {{in the development of}} passive dynamic walking robots (useful for an understanding of human gait and for future applications in entertainment and the like) is the stabilization of three-dimensional motions. This is a difficult problem due to the inherent interaction between fore–aft motions and sideways motions. In this paper we propose a simple solution. Conceptually, one can avert a sideways fall by steering in that direction, similar to skateboards and bicycles. We propose to implement this concept for walking robots by the introduction of an ankle joint that kinematically couples lean to yaw. The ankle joint has an unusual orientation; its axis points forward and downward, without any left–right component. The effect of the ankle joint is investigated in a simple three-dimensional model with three internal degrees of freedom: one at the hip and two at the ankles.

One of the main failure cases of interest is the Oscillatory Failure Case (OFC) which directly impacts the structural design of the aircraft.

This paper presents new fault detection architecture, dedicated to other kind of actuators, based on linear model with a feedback loop including a dynamic filter {{in order to increase}} fault detection efficiency in a specific bandwidth. This scheme uses a second-order linear model, corresponding to an Electro-Hydrostatic Actuator (EHA).

40|$|Similar to {{dark-field}} microscopy annular apertures may {{be introduced}} in ophthalmic instrumentation to eliminate low angular-scattering components. When used with coherent light, apodization {{of the incident}} beam with a central obstruction or conversion to an annular beam using beam-shaping techniques {{may be used to}} increase the effective numerical aperture and thus to squeeze down the width of the light at focus. For scanning retinal imaging applications this holds promise for improved resolution with an up to 60 % increase of the ocular numerical aperture. In this study we discuss alternatives that may generate an annular illumination and show examples with scanning laser ophthalmoscopy images acquired by use of an annular incident beam created with a central stop [1]. The approach is discussed in relation to matching of the focused incident beam to the expected waveguide modes of individual cone photoreceptors [2]. The pros and cons of the scheme are discussed and requirements for wavefront correction with an annulus are established in relation to the retinal imaging application.

40|$|The {{accurate}} {{performance evaluation}} {{is crucial to}} the design and development of macro/micro sized piezoelectric devices, and key to this is the proper use of the stiffness/compliance and piezoelectric coefficients of the piezoelectric ceramics involved. Although the literature points out effective piezoelectric coefficients: and for thin film materials, and reduced dimensionality of equations for bulk material, the elastic and piezoelectric coefficients remain unchanged from the 3 D equations in most of the reported macro/micro sized device’s 1 D and 2 D analyses involving the e form of the constitutive equations. This leads to variations between numerically predicted and experimental results in most devices. In order to understand effects of the dimensional reduction from 3 D to 2 D and 1 D on stiffness/compliance and piezoelectric coefficients, this paper derives the 2 D and 1 D constitutive equations from the 3 D equations with focus upon the discussion of often required device configurations for sensor and actuator design and analysis. Two modified coefficients are proposed, termed reduced and enhanced and these enable better understanding of effects of the dimensional reduction and also effects on the design and analysis of sensors and <b>actuato...</b>|$|E
40|$|Aerodynamic {{properties}} of an airfoil {{can be modified}} by trapping concentrations of vor-ticity close to the trailing edge. Experimental work has shown that synthetic jet actuators {{can be used to}} manipulate and control this trapped vorticity. A time-resolved detailed model is used to simulate the action of tangential-blowing synthetic jet actuators mounted near the trailing edge of the airfoil at low angle of attack. This detailed model resolves the temporal and spatial scales involved in the synthetic jet dynamics. The detailed synthetic jet model along with the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) computations in which they are embedded are validated against wind tunnel data acquired by Dr Ari Glezer’s group at Georgia Tech. Numerical results show the effects of the actuators on the vortical structure of the flow, {{as well as on the}} aerodynamic properties. The main effect of the actuation on the time averaged vorticity field is a bending of the separation shear layer from the actuator toward the airfoil surface, resulting in changes in the aerodynamic prop-erties. Similar to the experimental observations, full actuation of the suction side actuator reduces the pitching moment and increases the lift force, while the pressure side actuator increases the pitching moment and reduces the lift force.

40|$|One of the {{weaknesses}} of the operator splitting method (OSM) is that its corrector step employs the approximation that incremental forces are linearly related to the tested structure’s initial stiffness matrix. This paper presents a new predictor–corrector technique in which the assumptions about the tested structure’s response are shifted to the predictor step, which results in an enhancement in overall simulation accuracy, especially for nonlinear structures. Unlike OSM, which splits the displacement and velocity operators into explicit and implicit terms, the new method uses predicted accelerations to compute fully explicit displacement and velocity values in the predictor step. Another advantage of the proposed technique, termed the full operator method (FOM) is that its formulation makes it suitable for both quasi-static and real-time hybrid simulation. The effectiveness of FOM is first evaluated by investigating error propagation in an undamped single degree-of-freedom model. It is shown that the corrector step in FOM is able to significantly suppress aberrant simulation results caused by incorrect estimation of the structure’s stiffness matrix. The performance of FOM is demonstrated by exercising two additional models, which exhibit significant inelastic behavior under the prescribed excitation. The simulation {{results show that the}} proposed FOM algorithm is capable of producing accurate solutions and that the corrector step is influential in effectively reducing simulation errors. It is also shown that FOM suppresses <b>actuato...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{potential}} problem {{that could possibly}} restrict the application of dielectric electro-active polymer (DEAP) actuators for active vibration damping is highlighted in this contribution. If a periodic electric field is applied to a DEAP actuator to counteract a periodic vibratory disturbance, a very common vibration attenuation problem, then the mechanical output will be {{the square of the}} periodic input. This will result in an actuator output with several harmonics. Therefore from a vibration damping perspective not only does the first harmonic of the periodic disturbance need to be considered but also additional harmonics, introduced by the actuator itself. Feedforward active damping of periodic vibratory disturbances using a tubular DEAP actuator is addressed in this contribution. Initially the addition of a d. c. bias offset to the periodic voltage signal applied to the actuator is investigated to try and reduce the effect of the higher harmonics. The use of a linearizing gain schedule is then also examined. Using a comparatively large d. c. bias voltage offset has a linearizing affect on the voltage-strain characteristics of the tubular actuator thereby reducing the influence of the higher harmonics on the resulting vibration damping characteristics. The disadvantage of this approach is that the operating range, in terms of the actuator stroke that can be achieved, is decreased. The use of a linearizing gain schedule also reduces the influence of the higher harmonics but provides less of a constraint on the operating range of the <b>actuato...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background Current {{procedures}} for repairing {{damage to the}} articular cartilage in the ankle are not satisfying patient needs and have a minimum rehabilitation time of 4 months. The Chondro project aims to develop an all-in-one polyclinical procedure where diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation can be performed in one session reducing the rehabilitation time greatly. Methods This project aims to develop a flexible steerable needle used {{in the treatment of}} the damaged cartilage. The needle will have to apply a two-component hydrogel to the lesion. The device is designed at 5 mm diameter with the aim to downscale this to 3 mm in the future. The bending radius of the device needs to be at least 16 mm at the 3 mm scale. These and other requirements were tested in several setups and a pilot study with 15 participants. Results Several materials were used to produce different prototype. The best performing prototype was successfully used in the pilot study. The best performing prototype was produced with NinjaFlex and had a bending radius of 25 mm at 5 mm scale, bucking strength of 3. 2 N, rotational stiffness of 5. 8 μNm/deg and was able to reach the target areas with a mean absolute distance to the centre of the target of 1. 5 mm. Conclusion The designed device is highly precise, relatively stiff in axial direction and could certainly be used to successfully perform the procedure.

40|$|Algorithms {{involving}} {{artificial intelligence}} (i. e. neural networks and fuzzy logics) {{have begun to}} spread in the space applications in recent years. This has been made possible thanks to the increase of the know-how on machine-learning techniques and the advance of the computational capabilities of on-board processing. Thanks to the advance of technology and miniaturization, the implementation of such techniques is now feasible even on small platforms, such as CubeSats. The paper presents an algorithm for magnetorquers fault detection and identification applied to a 3 U CubeSat design. The implementation was developed in MathWorks Matlab & Simulink environment, following the model-based fault identification methodology. This approach involves artificial intelligence techniques, in particular fuzzy logic and multi-layer feed-forward offline-trained pattern recognition neural network. The simulated system is a CubeSat to fly a Low Earth Orbit mission: the attitude is controlled by three magnetorquers and a single reaction wheel, while the attitude determination {{is based on the}} measures from MEMS gyroscopes and magnetometers. Magnetorquers provide a reliable way to control attitude, and {{are one of the most}} used technologies for LEO CubeSats as, unlike other actuator options (e. g. thrusters), are relatively cheap, have low power consumption, and are lightweight. As any other component, they are subject of failures, whether temporary or definitive. Typical problems encountered by magnetorquers are: Float, Lock in Place, Hard-Over and Loss of Efficiency. Each of them alters in a peculiar way the behaviour of the actuator. The paper describes the simulator and algorithm architecture, with a particular focus on the design of fuzzy logics (connection and implication operators, rules and input/output qualificators) and the neural network architecture (number of layers, neurons per layer), threshold and activation functions, offline training algorithm and its data management. In conclusion, the paper presents the neural network and fuzzy states evolution and performance, in the different faulty configurations. Results show that the implementation of the fuzzy logics and neural networks helps to meet the specified performance requirements even in the event of some malfunctioning of a system <b>actuato...</b>|$|E

This thesis addresse s this issue and presents novel manufacturing sche mes for fabricating MEMS actuators using wafer-lev el integration of SMA wires to silicon struct ures. The SMA wires are integrated to a rrays of micromachined single crystalline sil icon cantilevers, which provide the cold state res et mechanism. The wires are eccentrically placed o nto the cantilever beams, thus providing ecce ntric loading of the cantilevers and resulting int o out-of-plane deflection. Tensioning of NiT i wires, alignment and placement to the wafer ¨is performed using specially built wire fram e tools and a coarse adhesive bonding approach. Anchoring of the wires to the individual devices is demonstrated using two different m ethods: the first method is based on adhesive bond ing of the SMA wires to the array of micromac hined cantilevers using a negative photoresist (SU - 8) and the actuators are operated using an extern al energy source. The second method uses elec troplating to form nickel anchors that both provid e a strong mechanical coupling between the SMA wir es and the silicon microstructures and that serve¨ as electrical contact pads.
