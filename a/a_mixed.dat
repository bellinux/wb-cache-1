40|$|To achieve {{anonymity}} in open environments {{such as the}} Internet, special proxies, denoted as mixes, were {{proposed to}} relay messages for senders and receivers. <b>A</b> <b>mix</b> may delay, batch and reorder packets to disrupt the packet-level timing correlation of packets {{into and out of}} the mix. Often multiple mixes are grouped into <b>a</b> <b>mix</b> network, which preserves anonymity in presence of compromised <b>mixes.</b> In <b>a</b> flow-based <b>mix</b> network, so-called flow correlation attacks have been proposed earlier to explore flow-level correlation and have been shown empirically to seriously degrade mix-based anonymous communication systems. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the effectiveness of <b>a</b> <b>mix</b> network under flow correlation attacks. Our formulae clearly show how <b>a</b> <b>mix</b> network will ultimately fail when an adversary has access to sufficiently long flow samples, independently of the type of flows (TCP or UDP). We illustrate the analysis methodology by modeling <b>a</b> continuous-time <b>mix,</b> which randomly delays each incoming packet. Our queuingmodel-based analysis captures the essence of flow correlation attacks and can provide useful guidelines for designers who develop and deploy anonymity systems...|$|R
