5|$|Bush {{was criticized}} internationally and {{targeted}} by the global anti-war and anti-globalization campaigns for his administration's foreign policy. Views of him within the international community—even in France, a close <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States—were more negative than those of most previous American presidents in history.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{this popular}} enthusiasm, however, Urban ensured {{that there would}} be an army of knights, drawn from the French aristocracy. Aside from Adhemar and Raymond, other leaders he {{recruited}} throughout 1096 included Bohemond of Taranto, a southern Italian <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reform popes; Bohemond's nephew Tancred; Godfrey of Bouillon, who had previously been an anti-reform <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy Roman Emperor; his brother Baldwin of Boulogne; Hugh I, Count of Vermandois, brother of the excommunicated Philip I of France; Robert Curthose, brother of William II of England; and his relatives Stephen II, Count of Blois and Robert II, Count of Flanders. The crusaders represented northern and southern France, Flanders, Germany, and southern Italy, and so were divided into four separate armies that were not always cooperative, though they were held together by their common ultimate goal.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Ptolemy III of Egypt, who {{had been}} an <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Achaean League in their wars against Macedon, shifted his {{financial}} support to Sparta. Ptolemy made this decision after calculating that a resurgent Sparta {{would be a more}} valuable ally against Macedon than a failing Achaean League.|$|E
50|$|<b>Allies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Night is <b>the</b> eighth book <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Saga <b>of</b> Darren Shan by Darren Shan (his real name, Darren O'Shaughnessy).

5|$|After the Cold War, the {{conflict}} in the Middle East triggered a crisis in 1990, when Iraq under Sadaam Hussein invaded and attempted to annex Kuwait, an <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States. Fearing that the instability would spread to other regions, President George H.W. Bush launched Operation Desert Shield, a defensive force buildup in Saudi Arabia, and Operation Desert Storm, in a staging titled the Gulf War; waged by coalition forces from 34 nations, led by the United States against Iraq ending in the successful expulsion of Iraqi forces from Kuwait, restoring the former monarchy.|$|E
5|$|Baird held ministerial {{responsibilities}} for the Toronto Harbourfront Centre and the Toronto Waterfront Revitalization Corporation. He developed a {{working relationship with}} Toronto Mayor David Miller soon after his appointment, and was present for the announcement of a comprehensive new waterfront strategy in June 2006. Ontario cabinet minister David Caplan described Baird {{as a champion of}} waterfront renewal and Miller described him as an <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city. Baird spent Christmas 2006 meeting with Canadian soldiers in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|Bohemond {{remained}} a close <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Byzantine Empire. He fought against Mleh, Lord of Armenian Cilicia, assisting in {{the restoration of}} Byzantine rule in the Cilician plain. He also made alliances with the Muslim rulers of Aleppo and Damascus against Saladin, who had begun to unite the Muslim countries along {{the borders of the}} crusader states. Since Bohemond repudiated his second wife and married an Antiochene lady, Patriarch Aimery excommunicated him in 1180.|$|E

5|$|Denmark was an <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Habsburg Holy Roman Empire, and it {{was evident}} that Sweden {{was on the verge of}} yet another war with that country. A remedy was {{attempted}} by chancellor Nils Brahe, who traveled to Copenhagen in the spring of 1675 to try to get the Danish princess Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark engaged to the Swedish king. In mid-June 1675, the engagement was officially proclaimed. However, when news arrived of the Swedish defeat at the Battle of Fehrbellin, Danish king Christian V declared war on Sweden that September.|$|E
5|$|From a {{historical}} perspective Britain’s situation was likened to that which the Austrian Empire found itself in after it was defeated by the Kingdom of Prussia in the Battle of Königgrätz in 1866. As Austria was thereafter formally excluded from German affairs, so too would Britain be excluded from continental affairs {{in the event of}} a German victory. Yet afterwards, Austria-Hungary became a loyal <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German Empire in the pre-World War I power alignments in Europe, and it was hoped that Britain would come to fulfill this same role.|$|E
5|$|In 1702, Swedish forces {{invaded the}} Commonwealth {{as part of}} the Great Northern War, which had begun in 1700 between the Swedish Empire and the Tsardom of Russia. Augustus II, king of Poland and Elector of Saxony, was an <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Russian tsar Peter I. Augustus's forces were defeated, and the king himself was forced back to Saxony. He was {{replaced}} by Charles with Stanisław Leszczyński, a Polish nobleman and count of the Holy Roman Empire. Poniatowski, serving as a negotiator between the Wielkopolska Confederation and Charles XII, took the side of Leszczyński and distanced himself from the Sapiehas, formerly his patrons.|$|E

50|$|Frangieh was {{a leading}} journalist. During <b>the</b> term <b>of</b> {{president}} Émile Lahoud, he was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opposition leaders, who tried to challenge close <b>allies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> president. The opposition group was also led by Rafik Hariri and Walid Jumblatt. Frangieh was a political <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> Jumblatt.|$|R
5|$|In April 1598, Sigismund {{resigned}} as Prince of Transylvania {{in favor of}} the Holy Roman Emperor, Rudolf II (who was also the King of Hungary); reversed his decision in October 1598; and then resigned again in favor of Cardinal Andrew Báthory, his cousin. Báthory had strong ties to the Polish chancellor and hetman Jan Zamoyski and placed Transylvania {{under the influence of the}} King of Poland, Sigismund III Vasa. He was also a trusted <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new Moldavian Prince Ieremia Movilă, one of Michael's greatest enemies. Movilă had deposed Ştefan Rǎzvan with the help of Polish hetman Jan Zamoyski in August 1595.|$|E
5|$|Jordan {{is a key}} <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> USA and UK and, {{together}} with Egypt, {{is one of only}} two Arab nations to have signed peace treaties with Israel, Jordan's direct neighbour. Jordan views an independent Palestinian state with the 1967 borders, as part of the two-state solution and of supreme national interest. The ruling Hashemite dynasty has had custodianship over holy sites in Jerusalem since 1924, a position re-inforced in the Israel–Jordan peace treaty. Turmoil in Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque between Israelis and Palestinians created tensions between Jordan and Israel concerning the former's role in protecting the Muslim and Christian sites in Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|Mackandal has expert {{knowledge}} {{of the nature of}} the forest, using its herbs and fungi as weapons against the planters. The ecological landscape of Haiti is used to represent the wreckage of the Revolution, being initially described as fertile and bountiful with the plantations, but later as worn down and bare. The powerful climate of the Caribbean is more similar to Africa than Europe, making nature an <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slaves. Natural elements also act on their own, with Henri Christophe's Citadel being attacked by fungi and thunderstorms before its completion.|$|E

5|$|Morpheus– The God of Dreams and {{the silent}} <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> goddess Persephone in Chains of Olympus. After Helios {{was taken from}} the sky by Atlas, which plunged the world into darkness, Morpheus forced both gods and mortals to slumber as his black fog covered the lands. An unseen character, Morpheus was thwarted when Kratos killed Persephone, imprisoned the Titan Atlas, and {{returned}} Helios to the sky. Morpheus did not appear in any other game, leaving his fate unknown.|$|E
5|$|The Ayyubid sultan, Al-Adil I, stormed {{into the}} County of Tripoli, {{creating}} {{an opportunity for}} Leo to plunder the land around Antioch in 1208. Bohemond persuaded Kaykaus I, Sultan of Rum, to invade Cilicia, forcing Leo to withdraw from Antioch. Pope Innocent tasked Albert Avogadro, Patriarch of Jerusalem, to mediate a peace. Avogadro, who was an <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Knights Templar, urged Leo to return Bagras to them. In an attempt to renew the truce, Leo obeyed the legate's demand, promising to withdraw from Bagras.|$|E
5|$|The Cuban Revolution {{led to the}} {{overthrow}} of Fulgencio Batista, an <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States, in 1959. Fidel Castro severed Cuba's formerly strong ties with the United States. The United States soon instituted a embargo against Cuba, which has made it illegal for United States corporations to enter into business with Cuba. The Baltimore Orioles, who were slated to hold an 1960 exhibition series against the Cincinnati Reds in Havana, moved the games to Miami, Florida.|$|E

Less than one month later, George Hawi, a former secretary general of the Lebanese Communist Party and an <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> DLM, was killed in a similar car bombing in Beirut. In the 2009 elections, the party again won a single seat, instead representing the West Bekaa district. It {{is a member of the}} March 14 Alliance parliamentary coalition.|$|E
5|$|The Latin Emperor of Constantinople, Robert I, died in January 1228. His brother Baldwin II succeeded him, but a regent {{was needed}} to rule the Latin Empire since Baldwin was ten years old. Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria was {{willing to accept the}} regency, but the barons of the Latin Empire {{suspected}} that he wanted to unite the Latin Empire with Bulgaria. They offered the imperial crown instead to John, an <b>ally</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy See.|$|E
