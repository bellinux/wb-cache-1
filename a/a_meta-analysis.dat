5|$|<b>A</b> <b>meta-analysis</b> {{found that}} {{psychological}} therapy {{is effective in}} reducing self-harm. The proportion of the adolescents who self-harmed over the follow-up period was lower in the intervention groups (28%) than in controls (33%).

5|$|An example {{he gives}} of the {{difficulty}} of obtaining missing data from drug companies is that of oseltamivir (Tamiflu), manufactured by Roche to reduce the complications of bird flu.

Bad Pharma charts the efforts of independent researchers, particularly Tom Jefferson of the Cochrane Collaboration Respiratory Group, to gain access to information about the drug.|$|E

5|$|In 2008 <b>a</b> <b>meta-analysis</b> of 25 {{independent}} studies assessing {{effects of}} Bt Cry proteins on honeybee survival (mortality) showed that Bt proteins used in commercialized GE crops to control lepidopteran and coleopteran pests do not negatively impact {{the survival of}} honeybee larvae or adults. Additionally, larvae consume only a small percent of their protein from pollen, {{and there is also}} a lack of geographic correlation between GM crop locations and regions where CCD occurs.|$|E
5|$|One {{study of}} 118 exocrine {{pancreatic}} cancer (EPC) patients and 399 hospital controls in eastern Spain found high selenium concentrations to be inversely {{associated with the}} risk of EPC. However, in randomized, blinded, controlled prospective trials in humans, selenium supplementation has not succeeded in reducing the incidence of any disease, nor has <b>a</b> <b>meta-analysis</b> of such selenium supplementation studies detected a decrease in overall mortality.|$|E

5|$|A 2009 {{consensus}} {{from the}} studies of {{the introduction of the}} euro concluded that it has increased trade within the eurozone by 5% to 10%, although one study suggested an increase of only 3% while another estimated 9 to 14%. However, <b>a</b> <b>meta-analysis</b> of all available studies suggests that the prevalence of positive estimates is caused by publication bias and that the underlying effect may be negligible. Furthermore, studies accounting for time trend reflecting general cohesion policies in Europe that started before, and continue after implementing the common currency find no effect on trade. These results suggest that other policies aimed at European integration might be the source of observed increase in trade.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all cases}} of {{pituitary}} apoplexy arise from a pituitary adenoma, a benign tumor of the pituitary gland. In 80%, {{the patient has}} been previously unaware of this (although some will retrospectively report associated symptoms). It was previously thought that particular types of pituitary tumors were more prone to apoplexy than others, but {{this has not been}} confirmed. In absolute terms, only a very small proportion of pituitary tumors eventually undergoes apoplexy. In an analysis of incidentally found pituitary tumors, apoplexy occurred in 0.2% annually, but the risk was higher in tumors larger than 10mm ("macroadenomas") and tumors that were growing more rapidly; in <b>a</b> <b>meta-analysis,</b> not all these associations achieved statistical significance.|$|E
5|$|Dean, a {{scientist}} and former astrologer, and psychologist Ivan Kelly conducted {{a large scale}} scientific test that involved {{more than one hundred}} cognitive, behavioural, physical, and other variables—but found no support for astrology. Furthermore, <b>a</b> <b>meta-analysis</b> pooled 40 studies that involved 700 astrologers and over 1,000 birth charts. Ten of the tests—which involved 300 participants—had the astrologers pick the correct chart interpretation out of a number of others that were not the astrologically correct chart interpretation (usually three to five others). When date and other obvious clues were removed, no significant results suggested there was any preferred chart.|$|E

5|$|Individuals {{infected}} with H. pylori have a 10 to 20% lifetime {{risk of developing}} peptic ulcers and a 1 to 2% risk of acquiring stomach cancer. Inflammation of the pyloric antrum {{is more likely to}} lead to duodenal ulcers, while inflammation of the corpus (body of the stomach) is more likely to lead to gastric ulcers and gastric carcinoma. However, H. pylori possibly plays a role only in the first stage that leads to common chronic inflammation, but not in further stages leading to carcinogenesis. <b>A</b> <b>meta-analysis</b> conducted in 2009 concluded the eradication of H. pylori reduces gastric cancer risk in previously infected individuals, suggesting the continued presence of H. pylori constitutes a relative risk factor of 65% for gastric cancers; in terms of absolute risk, the increase was from 1.1% to 1.7%.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolution}} of chemical defences in plants {{is linked to}} the emergence of chemical substances that are not involved in the essential photosynthetic and metabolic activities. These substances, secondary metabolites, are organic compounds that are not directly involved in the normal growth, development or reproduction of organisms, and often produced as by-products during the synthesis of primary metabolic products. Although these secondary metabolites have been thought {{to play a major role}} in defenses against herbivores, <b>a</b> <b>meta-analysis</b> of recent relevant studies has suggested that they have either a more minimal (when compared to other non-secondary metabolites, such as primary chemistry and physiology) or more complex involvement in defense.|$|E
