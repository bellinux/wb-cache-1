Another approach, used by modern hardware graphics adapters with accelerated geometry, can convert exactly all Bézier and conic curves (or surfaces) into NURBS, that can be rendered incrementally without first splitting the curve recursively to reach the necessary flatness condition. This approach also allows preserving the curve definition under all linear or perspective 2D and 3D transforms and projections.|$|R

Adopting the coordinate system shown in Figure 5, the trajectory is described by r(t):where the added π/4 sets the path angle at 45° to start with (just an arbitrary choice of direction), uR is a unit vector in the radial direction pointing {{from the center of}} the carousel to the walker at time t. The radial distance R(t) increases steadily with time according to:with s the speed of walking. According to simple kinematics, the velocity is then the first derivative of the trajectory:with uθ a unit vector perpendicular to uR at time t (as can be verified by noticing that the vector dot product with the radial vector is zero) and pointing in the direction of travel.The acceleration is the first derivative of the velocity:The last term in the acceleration is radially inward of magnitude ω2 R, which is therefore the instantaneous centripetal acceleration of circular motion. [...] The first term is perpendicular to the radial direction, and pointing in the direction of travel. Its magnitude is 2sω, and it represents the acceleration of the walker as the edge of the carousel is neared, and the <b>arc</b> <b>of</b> <b>circle</b> traveled in a fixed time increases, as can be seen by the increased spacing between points for equal time steps on the spiral in Figure 5 as the outer edge of the carousel is approached.|$|E
5000|$|The Sages of Israel {{permitted}} an Israelite {{to extend}} his [...] "Sabbath limit" [...] for another 2,000 cubits, in {{what is known as}} ʿeruḇ tǝḥūmīm (the amalgamation of boundaries), and which, if proper care had been taken on the eve of Sabbath to set-up a temporary abode at the prescribed 2,000 cubits' distance, would count as a man's Sabbath abode and would facilitate his going beyond the one biblical mile limit on the Sabbath day for another biblical mile. Setting up a temporary abode in this manner required of him to deposit on the eve of Sabbath enough food for two meals in an accessible place at the spot of the current 2,000 cubit limit, but did not require of him to actually rest there. He would also declare there, [...] "Let my cessation of labor (Heb. shǝvitathi) be in this place." [...] For the ʿeruḇ tǝḥūmīm to be effective, the food must be prepared by day (before the Sabbath) and be still in existence when Sabbath commences. Even so, this was a special allowance, and was only permitted when a certain religious duty or function warranted going beyond two-thousand cubits on the Sabbath day. Since the Sabbath day limit of 2,000 cubits was a rabbinic ordinance, the Rabbis had the power to exercise leniency in what concerns its proper observance. The Mishnah (Shabbat 23:5), however, prohibits a man from going out as far as the [...] "Sabbath limit" [...] and waiting there till nightfall (until the Sabbath departs) in order to engage forthwith in some business activity or in labor otherwise forbidden to do on the Sabbath day, since by preemptively going out on the Sabbath day for such purposes, even if it is merely to wait there until nightfall to get an early start, he transgresses a different prohibition of not being absorbed in one's own personal business affairs and thoughts on the Sabbath day (Isaiah 58:13). If, however, it was merely to call back an animal that had gone astray, he is permitted to stand at the [...] "Sabbath limit" [...] and call out to his animal, and thereby have the animal come back within his domain on its own power.Although a man has an extension of 2,000 cubits (1 biblical mile) from his town or from the place that he makes his ʿeruḇ tǝḥūmīm, the Rabbis state that, from that central point of reference, the one traveling is to delineate the bounds outward {{as if it had been}} a square, rather than the <b>arc</b> <b>of</b> <b>circle.</b> The difference between these two systems of delineation is that if the Sabbath limit was merely measured outward in the form of the arc of a circle, the person has merely a radius of 2,000 cubits to walk in any direction. Yet, since the actual measurement is done in the form of a square, with the point of reference (ʿeruḇ tǝḥūmīm) being in the center, this enables him to travel 2,000 cubits head-on (in relation to the square), or about 2,800 cubits diagonally.|$|E
