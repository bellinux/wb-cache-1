Keller determines that the shrine is emitting dangerous radiation that is causing the parasite to shrink so as to protect itself. As the parasite would rapidly and fatally re-expand were McKay to leave the shrine, and they cannot retrieve medical supplies from Atlantis due to the Wraith, Keller operates on him inside the shrine using improvised tools.

25|$|Brady's first {{witnesses}} {{during the}} trial included Betty Campbell, a model, who attended the September 5 party and testified that she saw Arbuckle with <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> his face hours after the alleged rape occurred; Grace Hultson, a local hospital nurse who testified it was very likely that Arbuckle raped Rappe and bruised her body in the process; and Dr. Edward Heinrich, a local criminologist who claimed he found Arbuckle's fingerprints smeared with Rappe's blood on room 1219's bathroom door. Dr. Arthur Beardslee, the hotel doctor who had examined Rappe, testified that an external force seemed to have damaged the bladder. During cross-examination, Betty Campbell, however, revealed that Brady threatened to charge her with perjury {{if she did not}} testify against Arbuckle. Dr. Heinrich's claim to have found fingerprints was cast into doubt after McNab produced the St. Francis hotel maid, who testified that she had cleaned the room before the investigation even took place and did not find any blood on the bathroom door. Dr. Beardslee admitted that Rappe had never mentioned being assaulted while he was treating her. McNab was furthermore able to get Nurse Hultson to admit that the rupture of Rappe's bladder could very well have been a result of cancer, and that the bruises on her body could also have been a result of the heavy jewelry she was wearing that evening. During the defense stage of the trial, McNab called various pathology experts who testified that although Rappe's bladder had ruptured, there was evidence of chronic inflammation and no evidence of any pathological changes preceding the rupture; in other words, there was no external cause for the rupture.|$|E
25|$|Cruyff is {{sometimes}} {{described as a}} typical kind of ‘artist-footballer’ or ‘footballer-thinker’ who considers football, the so-called 'beautiful game', not a purely athletic/physical competition but an artistic-oriented mind-body game. Because of his distinctive footballing views, Cruyff was called ‘the Spinoza of football’ by some. He believed in a certain style of play, which {{has the power to}} put <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> the people's faces as he described it. When Cruyff, both as a player and as a manager, spoke about football he often mentioned the entertainment value of the game, that there is more to it than winning. In a 2009 interview with Sportmails Martin Samuel, Arsène Wenger, as a devout follower of Cruyff's footballing ideology, once shared his opinion about football's artistic value, “I believe the target of anything in life should be to do it so well that it becomes an art. When you read some books they are fantastic, the writer touches something in you that you know you would not have brought out of yourself. He makes you discover something interesting in your life. If you are living like an animal, {{what is the point of}} living? What makes daily life interesting is that we try to transform it to something that is close to art. And football is like that. When I watch Barcelona, it is art.” , the author of Cruyff's French biography, called him ‘the greatest actor in the history of football’ because Cruyff was a glorious exception (possibly the only one ever) being the man who ‘played’ outstandingly well multiple roles in the world of football: player, manager, and thinker.|$|E

500|$|Half an {{hour after}} Michael Vaughan {{resigned}} from the Test captaincy, Collingwood relinquished charge of the ODI squad because it was affecting his ability to enjoy the game. Collingwood told his wife {{on the night before}} his century against South Africa {{that it was time to}} go. [...] He later explained, [...] "I've found the extra workload to be very difficult [...] [...] It's mentally tiring, and that's the top and bottom of it.

And also like his charisma, his character, he can always put <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> your face.

[...] John Terry described the victory as a [...] "perfect start", and added it gave Chelsea a psychological edge over Arsenal. Drogba felt the result was good for the team's confidence, though confessed Chelsea did not play well – particularly in midfield.|$|E

500|$|The Movie Ramblings {{review of}} the short {{highlighted}} its [...] "short, sharp and witty script mixed with some equally sharp action" [...] and D'Esposito's direction, naming it the best Marvel One-Shot at that point. Flickering Myth called the short [...] "a great effort. A nice, compact story that gives {{us a lot of}} great moments with the character." [...] The reviewer felt Flynn made a [...] "great foil" [...] to Carter, and also noted the [...] "great cameos and a post credit scene that should put <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> everybody’s face....Agent Carter is another great Marvel offering that shows how committed they are to the idea of an expanded universe where these great characters get time to shine." ...|$|E
500|$|A young, {{struggling}} British filmmaker Sue McKinley (Alice Patten) {{comes across}} {{the diary of}} her grandfather, Mr. McKinley (Steven Mackintosh), {{who served as a}} jailer in the [...] Imperial Police during the Indian independence movement.

[...] McKinley reveals that it was then that he met with the third kind— those who die with <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> their face.|$|E

In the Rolling Stone {{review of the}} album, critic Rob Sheffield wrote: [...] "'God Put a Smile Upon Your Face' is the slinkiest and best thing Coldplay have ever done." [...] Adrien Begrand of PopMatters wrote: [...] "Buckland's lead fills highlight the wondrous 'God Put <b>a</b> <b>Smile</b> <b>on</b> Your Face', as the song's chorus reaches heights that rival those of their fellow countrymen Doves." [...] Ted Kessler of NME wrote: [...] "Over a pounding garage tattoo Martin poses a deep, mortality-based teaser ('where {{do we go from}} here?'), asserts some self-belief ('God gave me style, God gave me grace') and then hits upon the bottom line as the song's mood suddenly improves with another fat and glorious chorus: 'Yeah, when you work it out I'm the same as you....your guess is as good as mine.'" ...|$|E

500|$|During pre-production, {{media reports}} {{suggested}} that several actresses including Genelia D'Souza, Priyanka Chopra and Kareena Kapoor were {{being considered for}} the role of Kaali Gawde. However, Chopra was approached over the others, who agreed to do the film instantly. While initial reports suggested that Chopra would be playing the role of a sex worker in the film, they were later denied as rumours. In an interview with Rediff.com, she clarified that she was playing a prostitute's daughter. On Chopra's character, Malhotra commented, [...] "Despite being a male dominated film, the part played by Priyanka is very prominent. It isn't that of a simple or ordinary lover. She is there for Vijay unconditionally and without any expectations. With all the dangerous people around her, she is like this pretty flower standing there with <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> her face." [...] In preparation for her role, Chopra wanted to visit a brothel, but Malhotra insisted that she doesn't for safety reasons.|$|E
500|$|I {{was running}} back and forth, literally, from the editing room with [...] Jonas Akerlund to working with Stuart, who was also mixing the music in the film. We were together, non-stop, all of us. Cutting 350 hours of film down to two hours. There {{are a lot of}} serious aspects to the movie. I needed a release. When I would go to Stuart's, and we'd go up to his loft, it was like, 'Honey, I want to dance.' I wanted to be happy, silly and buoyant. I wanted to lift myself and others up with this record. So, yes, the new album was a {{reaction}} to all the other stuff I was doing, which was very serious in nature. I hope that doesn't imply that I wanted to make a superficial record, because it's not. I want people to smile when they hear this record. I wanted it to put <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> my face, too.|$|E

Ganatra said that there is tension between AJ and Zainab, and although Zainab does not necessarily dislike AJ, she does not like that AJ gets Masood into trouble, and Zainab's hatred for Aliyah does not help. Inside Soap called Zainab AJ's archrival and Jaci Stephen from the Daily Mail said AJ's arrival was [...] "Something else not to put <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> Zainab's face" [...] though made it an [...] "exciting week" [...] for Masood.|$|E

The song marks the end of the sorrow of the Stranger, and his redemption years later. The album ends with the instrumental song [...] "Bandera".|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stone critic Peter Travers gave Begin Again {{three out}} of four stars, praising the [...] "subtle magic" [...] of the lead actors' {{performances}} and Carney's creation of [...] "surreal, enchanting loveliness" [...] without being overly sentimental. Ian Freer of Empire awarded the film four out of five stars, describing it as [...] "lovely stuff, winningly played, open-hearted and guaranteed to slap on <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>on</b> a balmy summer night." [...] In a review for Variety, Peter Debruge wrote that [...] "Gregg Alexander's music is undeniably the best thing" [...] about the film, which [...] "lays emotions on the line and then drives them home with music." [...] The Hollywood Reporters David Rooney praised the [...] "disarming emotional candor and intimacy" [...] of Carney's script and the chemistry between Knightley and Ruffalo, while David Edelstein of New York enjoyed Ruffalo's [...] "very funny" [...] performance and Knightley's [...] "surprisingly sweet singing voice".|$|E
