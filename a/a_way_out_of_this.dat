25|$|The war {{was thus}} {{locked in a}} stalemate. As the Pandavas mulled over this situation, Krishna advised them to visit Bhishma himself and request him to suggest <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> stalemate. Bhishma loved the Pandavas and knew that he stood as the {{greatest}} obstacle in their path to victory and so when they visited Bhishma, he gave them a hint {{as to how they}} could defeat him. He told them that if faced by one who had once been of the opposite gender, he would lay down his arms and fight no longer.|$|E
25|$|The {{human need}} for art, on this view, {{stems from the}} need for {{cognitive}} economy. A concept is already a sort of mental shorthand standing for {{a large number of}} concretes, allowing a human being to think indirectly or implicitly of many more such concretes than can be held explicitly in mind. But a human being cannot hold indefinitely many concepts explicitly in mind either—and yet, on the Objectivist view, needs a comprehensive conceptual framework to provide guidance in life. Art offers <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> dilemma by providing a perceptual, easily grasped means of communicating and thinking about a wide range of abstractions, including one's metaphysical value-judgments. Objectivism regards art as an effective way to communicate a moral or ethical ideal. Objectivism does not, however, regard art as propagandistic: even though art involves moral values and ideals, its purpose is not to educate, only to show or project. Moreover, art need not be, and usually is not, the outcome of a full-blown, explicit philosophy. Usually it stems from an artist's sense of life (which is preconceptual and largely emotional).|$|E
25|$|The ties {{of kinship}} {{meant that the}} {{relatives}} of a murdered person were obliged to exact vengeance {{for his or her}} death. This led to bloody and extensive feuds. As <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> deadly and futile custom the system of 'wergilds' was instituted. The 'wergild' set a monetary value on each person's life according to their wealth and social status. This value could also be used to set the fine payable if a person was injured or offended against. Robbing a thane called for a higher penalty than robbing a ceorl. On the other hand, a thane who thieved could pay a higher fine than a ceorl who did likewise. Men were willing to die for the lord and to support their 'comitatus'; their warrior band. Evidence of this behavior (though it may be more a literary ideal than an actual social practice), can be observed in the story, made famous in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle entry for 755, of Cynewulf and Cyneheard, in which the followers of a defeated king decided to fight to the death rather than be reconciled after the death of their lord.|$|E

500|$|The album's {{style and}} themes are {{exemplified}} by the bookending track [...] "Peace Go with You, Brother", with Scott-Heron's bluesy, jazzy vocals and Afrocentric lyrics accompanied by Jackson's soulful piano arrangements. It features a dreamy, moody soundscape, produced by Jackson's Rhodes electric piano, which evokes the In a Silent Way-era jazz of Miles Davis. [...] "Peace Go with You, Brother" [...] has Scott-Heron criticizing the selfishness of certain members of his generation, {{as well as people}} for forgetting their common humanity. The song continues to examine the significance of a person's cultural roots, regardless of where they prove to blossom. [...] "Rivers of My Fathers" [...] is the album's longest track and features drummer Bob Adams' swing-style drum rim shots and pianist Jackson’s wide, blocky chords, play in a blue-influenced style. Scott-Heron uses the water motif, a common metaphor in African-American culture, to evoke feelings of home and freedom and represent faith, amid the frustrations of a modern black man. As the opening verse and chorus suggest, [...] "Looking for <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> confusion/I'm looking for a sign, carry me home/Let me lay down by a stream and let me be miles from everything/Rivers of my fathers, could you carry me home." [...] The narrator beseeches the [...] "river" [...] to deliver him home, which is revealed at the last seconds of the song as Scott-Heron silently whispers [...] "Africa".|$|E

As {{long as the}} function in question is reasonably well-behaved, it can be estimated by randomly selecting points in 100-dimensional space, and taking some kind of average of the function values at these points.

2500|$|A non-violent Quebec {{independence}} movement slowly took {{form in the}} late 1960s.

An architect of the Quiet Revolution, Lévesque was frustrated by federal-provincial bickering over what he saw as increasing federal government intrusions into provincial jurisdictions. He saw a formal break with Canada as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this.</b> He broke with the provincial Liberals who remained committed to the policy of defending provincial autonomy inside Canada.|$|E

2500|$|Eugene Koonin said, [...] "Despite {{considerable}} {{experimental and}} theoretical effort, no compelling scenarios currently {{exist for the}} origin of replication and translation, the key processes that together comprise the core of biological systems and the apparent pre-requisite of biological evolution. The RNA World concept might offer the best chance for the resolution of this conundrum but so far cannot adequately account {{for the emergence of}} an efficient RNA replicase or the translation system. The MWO [...] version of the cosmological model of eternal inflation could suggest <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> conundrum because, in an infinite multiverse with a finite number of distinct macroscopic histories (each repeated an infinite number of times), emergence of even highly complex systems by chance is not just possible but inevitable." ...|$|E

[...] In his {{interpretation}} of Scott-Heron's lyrics, music writer and author Mtume ya Salaam explained [...] "Gil sings of 'looking for a way out' out of the cold, hard city; he wants to 'lay down by a stream' that is 'miles away from everything.' But he’s {{too far away from}} home, there is no way out—instead of warm, open fields and flowing waters, there is only brick, asphalt and mortar." [...] Following several vocal deliveries of whole choruses, the narrator pleads to the [...] "river" [...] to take him home, which is revealed at closing seconds of the song as Scott-Heron silently says [...] "Africa".|$|E
2500|$|As <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> seeming double-bind, or to his admissions {{that poetry}} is, as Pound observed, [...] "news that stays news", that it remains {{an active and}} viable (or [...] "actively situated") {{principle}} within the social dynamic, critics and readers alike point to Palmer's own avowals of an emerging countertradition to the prevailing literary establishment: an 'alternative tradition' that just slipped under the radar {{as far as the}} Academy and its various 'schools' of poetry are concerned. Though not always so visible, this counter-tradition continues to exert an underground influence. Poetry, as critique or praise, can perhaps in its reach exceed the grasp of modernism and procure for us as visible again, that which is all or nothing except for the 'ghostlier demarcations' of the social wager within sight of the shipwreck of the singular (as George Oppen characterized it) which denotes or delimits the very idea of the social, if not the very idea that there is a definition of the social other than this : the community of those who have no community. Indeed, the unavowable community (to borrow a title and phrasing from Maurice Blanchot).|$|E

2500|$|Both Citigroup and the Mets {{maintain}} that the naming rights deal is secure, despite Citigroup's economic troubles. This deal has been criticized {{in light of the}} late-2000s financial crisis and the $45 billion of taxpayer funds allocated to Citigroup by the U.S. federal government in two separate rescue packages, prompting New York City Council members Vincent Ignizio and James Oddo to suggest that the new ballpark be called [...] "Citi/Taxpayer Field." [...] Radio talk show host Brian Lehrer suggested the name [...] "Debits Field" [...] which combines baseball history with public outrage over the Citi bailout. [...] Congressman Elijah Cummings of Maryland, who serves on the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, stated in regards to the Citi Field naming rights deal, [...] "This type of spending is indefensible and unacceptable to Citigroup's new partner and largest investor: the American taxpayer.... I strongly urge Citigroup to find <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> contract and instead spend that $400 million on retaining its employees and restoring confidence in its operations." [...] On January 29, 2009, congressmen Dennis Kucinich of Ohio and Ted Poe of Texas sent a letter to United States Secretary of the Treasury Timothy F. Geithner urging him to scrap Citigroup's $400 million naming rights deal. [...] "We request that you intervene and demand that Citigroup dissolve the agreement they have with the New York Mets," [...] reads the letter. [...] "Absent this outcome, we feel strongly that you should compel Citigroup to return immediately all federal monies received to date, as well as cancel all loan guarantees." [...] However, Geithner rejected congressional demands to cancel the naming rights deal.|$|E
