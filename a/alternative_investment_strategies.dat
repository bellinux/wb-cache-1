The study adopts the Dogs of the Dow <b>investment</b> <b>strategy</b> that entails a buy and hold strategy of the highest dividend yielding stocks in the market.

Specifically, we look at how credit risk can be diminished when a portfolio is diversified across countries, industry sectors, maturities, seniority types and credit ratings.

Our results show that geographical diversification is more effective in reducing portfolio risk than any <b>alternative</b> <b>investment</b> <b>strategy</b> we consider, and that industry effects are not material to this result.

40|$|This paper {{constructs}} an <b>alternative</b> <b>investment</b> <b>strategy</b> to portfolio {{optimization model}} {{in the framework of}} the Mean–Variance portfolio selection model. To differentiate it from the ubiquitously applied Mean–Variance model, which is constructed on an assumption that returns are normally distributed, our model makes two assumptions: Firstly, that asset prices follow a Geometric Brownian Motion and that secondly asset prices are Log-normally distributed meaning that continuously compounded returns are normally distributed. The traditional Mean–Variance optimization approach has only one objective, which fails to capture the stochastic nature of asset returns and their correlations. This paper presents an alternative approach to the portfolio selection problem. The proposed optimization model which is an optimal portfolio strategy is produced for investors of various risk tolerance, taking into account the stochastic nature of the returns. Detailed analysis based on log– optimal growth optimization and the application of the model are provided and compared to the standard Mean–Variance approach. ...|$|R
40|$|When investors make {{financial}} plans, {{their strategies}} {{depend on the}} returns they expect from investments in the stock market.

40|$|Lump Sum (LS), Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA), and Value Averaging (VA) {{are among}} the most popular <b>investment</b> <b>strategies.</b> However, {{conflicting}} conclusions on their relative performances have been given in the literature due to the use of different time periods of data and simulations. We propose an <b>alternative</b> <b>investment</b> <b>strategy</b> called Threshold Control (TC) based on statistical process monitoring. The idea is that the investor only makes portfolio moves when its market value is far above or below the target value set by the investor. TC {{can be viewed as a}} generalization of both LS and VA, and provides more flexibility to the investor. We present theoretical results for the mean returns and standard deviations of returns for the four strategies under the independent and identically distributed (i. i. d.) model for the stock return. This model includes, as special cases, the i. i. d. t distribution model and the discrete-time versions of the famous geometric Brownian motion model and the double exponential jump-diffusion model. We also present numerical results on the performances of these <b>investment</b> <b>strategies</b> for the i. i. d. t distribution model, the geometric Brownian motion model, and the double exponential jump-diffusion model; and simulation results for the stochastic volatility model. The results show that setting the appropriate target return rate (target value) is critical to successful investing. This implies that the investor needs to have a good understanding of the valuations and expected returns and risks of the assets in which he or she invests...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the critical final five-year period leading up to retirement and analyzes whether traditional asset-allocation strategies effectively and consistently assist individuals in reaching their retirement income goals as they approach retirement. These traditional strategies are evaluated against <b>alternative,</b> option-based <b>investment</b> <b>strategies</b> that assure {{a certain amount of}} retirement income, after adjusting for inflation, while maximizing stock participation with the remaining funds in the portfolio through the use of options. In this simulation, we find higher overall expected yields in the traditional <b>investment</b> <b>strategies</b> over the evaluated five-year period. However, after applying a constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) coefficient, the leveraged option-based <b>investment</b> <b>strategies,</b> offering a more right-skewed payoff profile, quickly become the preferred strategies compared to the traditional asset-allocation methods. As most individuals approaching retirement possess high levels of risk aversion, these alternative strategies should be seriously considered in this important asset-allocation decision and its implications should not be overlooked by practitioners...|$|R

40|$|Freight {{transportation}} {{is vital to}} the economy of the United States. The total volume of freight moving inside the nation is expected to continue growing, while the U. S. transportation system is aging and becoming more costly to maintain. The revenue streams that allow for its preservation and expansion are decreasing rapidly. Because resources are scarce and long-range consequences difficult to anticipate, great care must be placed in freight transportation investment decisions, a complex process usually involving many stakeholders with diverse interests, modal and jurisdictional silos, diverse and vocal constituents, and a set of final system users that are typically removed from the decision-making process. This thesis explores how freight investment decisions can be helped by the use of scenario planning, a collaborative approach that enhances consensus-building and helps organizations to shift from prediction to preparation for the future, converting uncertainty into a competitive advantage. First, a review of the relevant literature is conducted in order to present a comprehensive description of scenario planning and the transportation planning process. Afterwards, case studies are presented to picture the observed practices in transportation infrastructure planning at different stages of a project lifecycle, followed by a characterization of past and current uses of scenario planning in transportation investment decisions. At that point, a methodology to evaluate <b>alternative</b> <b>investments,</b> <b>strategies</b> or policies under different scenarios is introduced, providing a hypothetical example of use. Finally, a list of recommendations are identified and explained. by Miguel Ángel Sánchez-Valero. Thesis (M.
