40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2017 This thesis {{argues that}} the state’s {{sovereignty}} is an illegitimate expropriation of power because it prevents individuals from developing their capacity to care for themselves and others. This argument is constructed around two main theoretical assertions. First, through Mark Purcell’s deconstruction of Hobbes’ Leviathan, that the proper place of power is within everyone, not within the sovereign state. Second, through Saul Newman, that equality and liberty within the liberal democratic imagination are always in tension. Contrastingly, the indeterminate space outside of the sovereign state wherein we all take up our power, resolves that tension, making possible a collective liberty. Equality then is not a distributable good but a social and political practice we <b>all</b> engage <b>in</b> <b>together.</b> <b>This</b> political practice amounts to developing our capacities to care for ourselves and others, rather than leaving those activities to a sovereign authority like the state or market...|$|R

We’d like get in our underwear and get crazy, and play stupid hardcore songs. I would pick up the guitar and play fun riffs, and then Chad would grab the mic and start screaming stuff, and then we thought, “Man, we should actually really write some hardcore songs and just record the songs on our equipment that we have here.” So that’s what we did, and we ended up recording like, sixteen songs just for fun and started playing it for people and people were like, “Man, this is really good. You guys sound like a real, seasoned hardcore band.” We’re like, “That’s awesome, ‘cause the songs are kind of like talking about Harry Potter and superheroes, and things like that." ...|$|R
40|$|Transcription begins] Headquarters, First Air Force Mitchel Field, Long Island New York Friday, 31 July, 1942 Bryant Service Club Bryant College Providence, Rhode Island Dear Friends: Thank {{all of you}} for the two flat- 50 {{boxes of}} Camel {{cigarettes}} that I received from you last Monday, the 27 th of July. This is the third time that you have sent me cigarettes I believe, and I certainly appreciate your kindness because I find myself smoking cigarettes a good deal these days. However, instead of beating around the bush I may as well come to the point by saying that my conscience would be considerably eased, grateful though I am, if your generous actions towards me were redirected to one of the $ 50 -a-month boys. I hope that you will not misunderstand me or think me ungracious <b>in</b> making <b>this</b> suggestion. Nevertheless I do feel that my receiving cigarettes from you may prevent some Bryant alumnus who cannot as well afford to buy cigarettes from having anything at all to smoke, and I hate to think that my thoughtlessness in continuing to accept your gifts might deprive him of the pleasure of receiving them somewhere beyond the continental limits of the United States or at some station in the United States more distant from home than mine is at present. I realize that many members of the Bryant Service Club must be foregoing pleasures and luxuries that they might otherwise enjoy if they were not contributing towards these pleasant surprise packages to Bryant alumni, whom they have never actually seen or known in person in many instances. Your organization is most assuredly doing a great morale-building piece of work for <b>all</b> of us <b>in</b> military service, because {{there is nothing in the}} world quite like a remembrance from friends back home. It is so personal [...] I don’t know, it just makes a fellow feel that folks at home do care a little about where we all are, that they realize that our lives have been disrupted, and that we are <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> war <b>together</b> hoping and endeavoring eventually to make a better world and happier days for everyone.

When we undressed the boy Ralph, we found hanging by a gold chain to his neck, where he said his mother placed it the night before she died, a large locket, also of gold. This locket contained three little pictures painted on ivory, one in each half of it and one with the plain gold back on a hinge between them. That to the right was of a handsome man in uniform, who, Ralph told me, was his father (and indeed he left <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>in</b> writing, <b>together</b> with his will); that to the left, of a lovely lady in a low dress, who, he said, was his mother; {{that in the middle}} a portrait of the boy himself, as anyone could see, which must have been painted not {{more than a year before}} we found him.
