5|$|A {{moderately}} strong hurricane with {{winds of}} 105mph (165km/h) was first spotted on October 6 east of Jamaica. Passing {{a short distance}} south of the island, the hurricane tracked northwestward <b>and</b> <b>brushed</b> the Yucatán Peninsula before turning north-northeastward into the Gulf of Mexico. Late on October 9, it made landfall a short distance east of Apalachicola, Florida at peak winds with an estimated pressure of 969mbar. Rapidly weakening to tropical storm status, the cyclone continued northeastward and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from North Carolina on October 11. Later that day, it was last observed about 250mi (400km) southeast of Cape Cod.|$|E
5|$|As Hurricane Ophelia {{moved past}} Cape Hatteras it {{turned to the}} east. Wind shear {{increased}} on September 16 and weakened Ophelia into a tropical storm for the last time. Ophelia turned to the northeast <b>and</b> <b>brushed</b> past Nantucket Island, Massachusetts on the next day. As it approached Nova Scotia on September 17, the storm became extratropical, but maintained its strength as it made landfall in the extreme eastern portion of the province. The extratropical storm passed over southern Newfoundland later that day, before finally dissipating on September 23 in the North Sea.|$|E

Ewiniar turned northward <b>and</b> <b>brushed</b> eastern China, forcing evacuations in many cities.|$|E
5|$|Having been {{ratified}} by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several states (27 of the 36 states, including those {{that had been in}} rebellion), Secretary of State Seward, on December 18, 1865, certified that the Thirteenth Amendment had become valid, to all intents and purposes, {{as a part of the}} Constitution.

5|$|On February2, Groundhog Day, a {{disturbance}} was first {{observed in the}} western Caribbean Sea. Winds were estimated at around 35mph (55km/h), and it tracked rapidly northward, initially to the north-northwest. After passing near Cancún along the Yucatan Peninsula, it turned northeastward <b>and</b> <b>brushed</b> the northwest coast of Cuba. Early on February3 the storm approached Key West, and shortly thereafter moved ashore near Cape Sable, Florida. It quickly crossed the state, passing near Miami before emerging into the western Atlantic Ocean. The Miami National Weather Service office recorded a wind gust of 68mph (110km/h), as well as sustained tropical storm force winds for about four hours; the station also recorded a barometric pressure of 1004mbar (29.66inHg).|$|E

5|$|The remnant {{tropical}} wave gradually curved northwestward <b>and</b> <b>brushed</b> western Jamaica on August14. As {{the wave}} approached the south coast of central Cuba, it rapidly re-organized into a tropical cyclone, becoming a tropical depression again at 18:00UTC on August15. Around 00:00UTC the following day, the depression re-intensified into {{a tropical storm}} and made landfall in Cuba near Playa Girón in Matanzas Province. Dennis moved northward across the island and emerged into the Straits of Florida near Cárdenas shortly after 06:00UTC. While crossing the Straits of Florida, deep convection associated with the cyclone attempted to become concentrated near the center and develop an eyewall. However, interaction with a trough prevented Dennis from intensifying despite passing over warm sea surface temperatures. The storm decelerated while approaching Florida due to weak steering currents.|$|E
5|$|Visual display was prized. Brilliant {{colors were}} {{obtained}} by the addition of, for example, juices from spinach and the green part of leeks.

Elaborate and showy dishes were the result, such as tourte parmerienne which was a pastry dish {{made to look like}} a castle with chicken-drumstick turrets coated with gold leaf. One of the grandest showpieces of the time was roast swan or peacock sewn back into its skin with feathers intact, the feet and beak being gilded. Since both birds are stringy, and taste unpleasant, the skin and feathers could be kept and filled with the cooked, minced and seasoned flesh of tastier birds, like goose or chicken.|$|E

5|$|The 2011 season had a minor hiccup at {{the very}} {{beginning}} with a two-point loss to the Blues. Their second round match against the Hurricanes was cancelled, and match declared a draw after the Christchurch earthquake on 22 February which caused 182 deaths. In their first match after the earthquake they played the Waratahs, a team that had only conceded six points in their previous two games. The Crusaders triumphed 33–18 in a convincing display in front of a sold-out stadium. They next played the Brumbies <b>and</b> <b>brushed</b> them aside in a 52–10 demolition. They next played the Highlanders who had previously only lost one match in the season, to the undefeated and table-topping Stormers. The Crusaders won comfortably 44–13 in Dunedin. The next team they played, the Sharks, had like the Highlanders previously only lost one match in the season before the Crusaders won 44–28 at Twickenham for a one off match due to earthquake damage at their own ground. They played the second match in Timaru Alpine Stadium against the Bulls in a sell out crowd winning 27–0. Round 9 they played the Chiefs in Mt Maunganui and gained four tries winning 34–16 with Richie McCaw returning after eight weeks off with injury.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Hermine caused {{significant}} {{flooding in}} Mexico during September1980. The eleventh tropical cyclone and eight named storm of the 1980 Atlantic hurricane season, Hermine developed from a tropical wave that emerged into the Atlantic {{from the west}} coast of Africa on September 11. After uneventfully crossing the Atlantic Ocean, the system developed a well-defined circulation while in the Caribbean Sea on September 20 and was then classified as a tropical depression. After becoming a tropical cyclone, the depression steadily strengthened as it tracked nearly due westward. By September 21, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Hermine <b>and</b> <b>brushed</b> the northern coast of Honduras shortly thereafter. It nearly became a hurricane before it made landfall in Belize on September 22. After weakening over the Yucatan Peninsula, Hermine restrengthened to near-hurricane status again over the Gulf of Mexico before making landfall in the Mexican state of Veracruz. Hermine steadily weakened inland and eventually dissipated on September 26.|$|E
5|$|Saturday evening's {{qualifying}} {{session was}} divided into three parts. The first part ran for twenty minutes and eliminated the cars that finished the session eighteenth or lower. The second part of qualifying lasted fifteen minutes and eliminated cars that finished in positions eleven to seventeen. The final part of qualifying determined the positions from first to tenth and decided pole position. Cars which competed in the final qualifying session {{were not allowed to}} change tyres before the race; these started the race fitted with the tyres with which they set their quickest lap times. It was held in dry weather conditions. Alonso was fastest in the first and third sessions, and clinched his second consecutive pole position with a lap time of 1:45.390 which he set on his first run of the third session. He was restricted to one timed lap in the second session because of an engine mapping problem, which meant Ferrari immediately re-programmed Alonso's engine upon discovering the issue. Alonso was joined on the front row of the grid by Vettel, who recorded a lap 0.067seconds off Alonso's pace, and felt he could have taken pole position as he misjudged a gap while following Schumacher <b>and</b> <b>brushed</b> the wall exiting the Singapore Sling chicane. Hamilton qualified third and was happy with his starting position despite losing downforce on the track's final sector while running in teammate Button's tow. Button secured fourth and pushed hard in the final session which meant he had slight damage to his rear tyres on his first run, and could not get the optimum tyre temperature in the first section on his second run. Webber managed fifth and admitted that he was struggling to find a good rhythm when driving the circuit. Barrichello qualified in sixth. The two Mercedes drivers took seventh and ninth; Rosberg ahead of Schumacher. Rosberg believed that he should have performed better in qualifying than in the practice session, as he felt the soft tyres lacked grip; Schumacher was satisfied with his qualifying performance. The Mercedes drivers were separated by Kubica, in the faster Renault, who was happy with his lap time despite his car sliding from a lack of grip. Kobayashi rounded out the top ten qualifiers.|$|E

25|$|Initially a {{tropical}} depression, it headed westward without significant strengthening {{for four days}} due to unfavorable upper-level winds. While nearing the Lesser Antilles upper-level winds decreased, allowing the depression to become Tropical Storm Hortense on September7. Hortense crossed Guadeloupe on September8 and entered the Caribbean Sea. By on the following day, it was upgraded to a hurricane while curving northwestward. Hortense made landfall in Puerto Rico on September9 <b>and</b> <b>brushed</b> the Dominican Republic shortly thereafter.|$|E
25|$|By {{early on}} September9, Hortense was {{upgraded}} to a hurricane, while curving northwestward. Around 0600UTC {{on the following}} day, the storm made landfall near Guánica, Puerto Rico with winds of 80mph (130km/h); this made it the first hurricane landfall on the island since Hurricane Hugo in 1989. Initially, most tropical cyclone forecast models anticipated Hortense would pass south of the island and instead strike the Dominican Republic. After two hours, Hortense emerged into the Mona Passage <b>and</b> <b>brushed</b> the eastern tip of Dominican Republic; Punta Cana near the eastern tip of the country reported the calm of the eye on September10. Land interaction with Hispaniola weakened the storm slightly, though it would soon re-strengthen.|$|E

25|$|After his {{successful}} Tullahoma Campaign, Rosecrans renewed the offensive, aiming {{to force the}} Confederates out of Chattanooga. In early September, Rosecrans consolidated his forces scattered in Tennessee and Georgia and forced Bragg's army out of Chattanooga, heading south. The Union troops followed it <b>and</b> <b>brushed</b> with it at Davis's Cross Roads. Bragg was determined to reoccupy Chattanooga and decided to meet a part of Rosecrans's army, defeat it, and then move back into the city. On September 17 he headed north, intending to attack the isolated XXI Corps. As Bragg marched north on September 18, his cavalry and infantry fought with Union cavalry and mounted infantry, which were armed with Spencer repeating rifles.|$|E
25|$|Blair's {{academic}} performance reports {{suggest that he}} neglected his academic studies, but during his time at Eton he worked with Roger Mynors to produce a College magazine, The Election Times, joined {{in the production of}} other publications – College Days and Bubble and Squeak – and participated in the Eton Wall Game. His parents could not afford to send him to a university without another scholarship, and they concluded from his poor results {{that he would not be}} able to win one. Runciman noted that he had a romantic idea about the East, and the family decided that Blair should join the Imperial Police, the precursor of the Indian Police Service. For this he had to pass an entrance examination. His father had retired to Southwold, Suffolk, by this time; Blair was enrolled at a crammer there called Craighurst, <b>and</b> <b>brushed</b> up on his Classics, English, and History. He passed the entrance exam, coming seventh out of the 26 candidates who exceeded the pass mark.|$|E
25|$|On lap 35, Schumacher went wide at the East Terrace corner <b>and</b> <b>brushed</b> the wall. He {{lost time}} {{but at the}} time, {{it was unclear whether}} his car was damaged or not. Hill was {{suddenly}} right behind him and saw his chance to pass, taking the inside line into the next corner. As Hill's Williams drew alongside the Benetton, Schumacher appeared to turn in aggressively and there was contact between the two rival cars. The Benetton was then momentarily flung into the air and was damaged badly enough to mean immediate retirement for the German. Hill's car initially appeared to be undamaged but it was soon apparent the Briton's front left wishbone was broken. Hill toured back slowly to the pits and after some time trying to repair the damage, retired. Whether this accident had been deliberately caused by Schumacher – in the knowledge he had damaged his car in running wide at the East Terrace Corner – remains a matter of some debate, however it handed Michael Schumacher the first of his FIA Formula One World Championships.|$|E
