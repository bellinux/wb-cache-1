5|$|Although {{the economy}} was already in a mild {{recession}} at this point, conditions worsened substantially after the devaluation of the Mexican peso during December 1994. The economy shrank by 4%, and a dozen banks collapsed. With the labour force continuing to expand and employment falling sharply along with aggregate demand, unemployment rose by over 6% in 6 months. But the government responded effectively: it tightened bank regulation and capital requirements, and encouraged foreign banks to take over weaker local ones. The economy soon recovered and, between 1996 and 1998, both output and employment grew rapidly <b>and</b> <b>unemployment</b> declined substantially. However, {{at the beginning of}} 1999, the Brazilian currency underwent a strong depreciation. The Argentine economy contracted 4% in 1999, <b>and</b> <b>unemployment</b> increased again.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} initial months {{following}} Katrina, {{the labor force}} reduced faster than the demand <b>and</b> <b>unemployment</b> rates skyrocketed. However, as of September 2006, the unemployment rates have never fallen below national average, indicating improvement. In the second quarters of both 2005 and 2007, the firms' wages were increased by 21%, twice more than national increases, indicating even further improvement, although the gains were varied across the sectors.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{construct}} a North-South product-cycle model of trade with fully-endogenous growth {{in which both}} countries experience unemployment due to union wage bargaining. We show {{that the existence of}} labor unions matters for trade liberalization to have any effect on Northern innovation and worldwide growth. We find that unilateral Northern trade liberalization reduces growth <b>and</b> increases <b>unemployment</b> in both countries, while unilateral Southern trade liberalization has the opposite effects. For empirically plausible parameter values, bilateral trade liberalization by equal amounts increases growth <b>and</b> reduces <b>unemployment</b> in both countries. Stronger Northern labor unions hurt both countries by reducing growth <b>and</b> increasing <b>unemployment.</b> However, stronger Southern labor unions exert a positive growth effect for both countries, while decreasing Northern <b>unemployment</b> <b>and</b> increasing Southern <b>unemployment...</b>|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{cyclical}} <b>unemployment,</b> structural <b>unemployment,</b> <b>and</b> classical <b>unemployment</b> are largely involuntary in nature. However, {{the existence of}} structural unemployment may reflect choices made by the unemployed in the past, while classical (natural) unemployment may result from the legislative and economic choices made by labour unions or political parties. So, in practice, the distinction between voluntary <b>and</b> involuntary <b>unemployment</b> is hard to draw.|$|R
5|$|As a major {{industrial}} city into the mid-20th century, Omaha shared in social tensions of larger cities that accompanied rapid growth and many new immigrants and migrants. By the 1950s, Omaha was {{a center for}} illegal gambling, while experiencing dramatic job losses <b>and</b> <b>unemployment</b> because of dramatic restructuring of the railroads and the meatpacking industry, {{as well as other}} sectors. Persistent poverty resulting from racial discrimination and job losses generated different crimes in the late 20th century, with drug trade and drug abuse becoming associated with violent crime rates, which climbed after 1986 as Los Angeles gangs made affiliates in the city.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a new framework for examining the distributional consequences of trade liberalization {{that is consistent}} with increasing inequality in every country, growth in residual wage inequality, rising <b>unemployment,</b> <b>and</b> reallocation within and between industries. While the opening of trade yields welfare gains, <b>unemployment</b> <b>and</b> inequality within sectors are higher in the trade equilibrium than in the closed economy. In the open economy changes in trade openness have nonmonotonic effects on <b>unemployment</b> <b>and</b> inequality within sectors. As aggregate <b>unemployment</b> <b>and</b> inequality have within- and between-sector components, changes in sector composition following the opening of trade complicate its impact on aggregate <b>unemployment</b> <b>and</b> inequality. However, when countries are nearly symmetric, the sectoral composition effects reinforce the within-sector effects, and both aggregate inequality <b>and</b> aggregate <b>unemployment</b> rise with trade liberalization. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{adopts a}} Neo-Schumpeterian {{approach}} {{to analyze the}} relationship between <b>unemployment</b> <b>and</b> growth.

Industrial policies {{in the form of}} production subsidies to young small firms, production taxes to old large firms, and R&D subsidies to entrepreneurs all stimulate growth but also increase unemployment. In contrast, recovery policies reducing job vacancy costs lead to higher growth <b>and</b> lower <b>unemployment...</b>|$|R
5|$|During the Great Depression, {{unemployment}} exceeded 25% statewide. Southern Indiana {{was hard}} hit, <b>and</b> <b>unemployment</b> topped 50% during the worst years. The federal Works Progress Administration (WPA) began operations in Indiana in July 1935. By October of that year, {{the agency had}} put 74,708 Hoosiers to work. In 1940, there were still 64,700 people working for agency. The majority of these workers were employed to improve the state's infrastructure: roads, bridges, flood control projects, and water treatment plants. Some helped index collections of libraries, and artists were employed to create murals for post offices and libraries. Nearly every community had a project to work on.|$|E

5|$|Scottish {{industry}} {{came out}} of the depression slump by a dramatic expansion of its industrial activity, absorbing unemployed men and many women as well. The shipyards were the centre of more activity, but many smaller industries produced the machinery needed by the British bombers, tanks and warships.

Real wages, adjusted for inflation, rose 25 per cent, <b>and</b> <b>unemployment</b> temporarily vanished. Increased income, and the more equal distribution of food, obtained through a tight rationing system, dramatically improved the health and nutrition; the average height of 13-year-olds in Glasgow increased by 2inches.|$|E

40|$|A simple {{labor market}} with spatial {{separation}} and Markov production shocks is presented. In the stationary equilibrium, some workers are frictionally unemployed {{and others are}} long-term unemployed. The amounts of frictional <b>and</b> long-term <b>unemployment</b> at each location depend on its recent history of productivity shocks, producing a local hysteresis effect. Changes in the parameters affect the equilibrium aggregate amounts of frictional <b>and</b> long-term <b>unemployment</b> differently. In particular, economies with larger moving costs will have more long-term <b>and</b> total <b>unemployment,</b> but less frictional unemployment. This finding is broadly consistent with recently reported stylized facts. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{documents}} and examines the {{demographic characteristics of}} the workforce in the context of <b>unemployment</b> <b>and</b> long-term <b>unemployment</b> with an emphasis on recessions. We first look at the historical tracking of <b>unemployment</b> <b>and</b> long-term <b>unemployment.</b> Long-termers, those out of work for at least six months, have become a relatively larger share of the unemployed in good times and bad. Secondly, annual data from 2009 is presented. We give extensive demographic breakdowns to examine differential rates of <b>unemployment</b> <b>and</b> long-term <b>unemployment</b> across <b>and</b> within groups. Those disproportionally affected by the on going recession that began in December 2007 were those who were the least educated; males; Blacks and Hispanics; teenagers; and young workers. Workers in the construction and production occupations were hit hard as were those in the construction and manufacturing industries. The latter part of this paper compares and contrasts labor market outcomes demographically across the last four recessionary periods. In general, less educated, young and non-whites continue to disproportionally bear the brunt of economic downturns but less so than in the past. Economics...|$|R
