50|$|A key {{component}} of language is its arbitrariness and what a word can represent, as a word is a sound created by humans <b>with</b> <b>attached</b> <b>meaning</b> to said sound. No one can determine {{the meaning of a}} word purely by how it sounds. However, in onomatopoeic words these sounds are much less arbitrary; they are connected in their imitation of other objects or sounds in nature. Vocal sounds in the imitation of natural sounds doesn’t necessarily gain meaning, but can gain symbolic meaning. An example of this sound symbolism in the English language is the use of words starting with sn-. Some of these words symbolize concepts related to the nose (sneeze, snot, snore). This does not mean that all words with that sound relate to the nose, but at some level we recognize a sort of symbolism associated with the sound itself. Onomatopoeia, while a facet of language, is also in a sense outside of the confines of language.|$|R
