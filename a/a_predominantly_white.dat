5|$|Adult {{males and}} juveniles are quite {{different}} in appearance to the female. They are smaller in size, being about one sixth {{the size of an}} adult female. Juveniles have a brown carapace, with <b>a</b> <b>predominantly</b> <b>white</b> abdomen which has a series of red-orange diamonds running along the dorsal region bordered on either side by irregular black lines. Males retain this coloration into adulthood. Due to its much smaller size, Urquhart (1886) believed the male to be a separate species and named it Theridion melanozantha. This was not rectified until 1933 when it was correctly identified as the male Latrodectus katipo.|$|E

5|$|In 1920, Donaldson made a then-controversial move {{by hiring}} an African-American {{journalist}} James Albert Jackson {{to write a}} weekly column devoted to African-American performers.

Jackson {{was the first black}} critic at a national magazine with <b>a</b> <b>predominantly</b> <b>white</b> audience. According to his grandson, Donaldson also established a policy against identifying performers by their race. Donaldson died in 1925.|$|E

5|$|Rhodesia was an unrecognised {{state in}} {{southern}} Africa, run by <b>a</b> <b>predominantly</b> <b>white</b> minority government headed by Prime Minister Ian Smith. Taking {{exception to the}} UK's insistence on majority rule {{as a condition for}} independence, Smith's colonial administration had unilaterally declared independence in 1965 following a long dispute over the terms. International uproar and the first ever United Nations economic sanctions had ensued, making Rhodesia deeply isolated. This quarantine variously extended to sports. Rhodesian athletes, including the 1968, 1972 and 1976 Olympic squads (which were racially integrated), were barred from international competition on political grounds. Rhodesian cricket and rugby were not greatly affected as these sports largely operated in tandem with South Africa. The Rhodesia cricket team, for example, took part in the annual Currie Cup tournament against South African provincial sides.|$|E

40|$|Although student {{organizations}} {{have the potential}} to significantly contribute to the diversity efforts of <b>predominantly</b> <b>White</b> institutions (PWI), colleges continue to undermine the value of these organizations (Kuk 2 ̆ 6 Banning, 2010). Ethnic student organizations, specifically the students who lead them, can {{play a crucial role in}} promoting diversity and inclusion on college campuses yet few studies examine their role in institutional diversity efforts. This study explores the perceptions of student leaders of ethnic or minority student organizations enrolled in <b>a</b> four year <b>predominantly</b> <b>White,</b> Christian university to better understand how they perceive their university’s diversity efforts and their own role within these efforts. The study asks the following research questions: (1) How do student leaders of ethnic student organizations perceive institutional diversity efforts at <b>a</b> faith-based, <b>predominantly</b> <b>White</b> university? (2) How do student leaders of ethnic student organizations perceive their role in institutional diversity efforts at <b>a</b> faith-based, <b>predominantly</b> <b>White</b> university? Using <b>a</b> phenomenological approach, semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine ethnic student organization leaders at a faith-based PWI. Findings reveal that ethnic student organization leaders hold mixed perceptions of institutional diversity efforts. Some participants are optimistic about the university’s efforts while others are either unaware of the university’s diversity efforts or believe the university is not doing enough to create a more diverse and inclusive campus. Student leaders’ perceptions are frequently impacted by a challenging campus climate, which often includes experiences of marginality or “otherness. ” Furthermore, ethnic student organization leaders perceive their role as helpful and salient to promoting diversity and inclusion on their campus...|$|R

5|$|There are two {{accepted}} coat colours, red and blue, though {{chocolate and}} cream do occur. Blue dogs can be blue, blue mottled, or blue speckled {{with or without}} black, tan, or white markings. Red dogs are evenly speckled with solid red markings. Both red dogs and blue dogs are born white (except for any solid-coloured body or face markings) and the red or black hairs grow in as they mature. The distinctive adult colouration {{is the result of}} black or red hairs closely interspersed through <b>a</b> <b>predominantly</b> <b>white</b> coat. This is not merle colouration (a speckled effect that has associated health issues), but rather the result of the ticking gene. A number of breeds show ticking, which is the presence of colour through white areas, though the overall effect depends on other genes that will modify the size, shape and density of the ticking.|$|E
