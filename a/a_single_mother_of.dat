Initially sceptical about playing a mother on screen early in her career, she changed her mind after reading the script.

She bought such props as a handbag, a comb, a pocket mirror, and rubber chappals. She also drew guidance from her mother's experiences of handling a teenage daughter. After the film's release, Bhaskar {{said in an interview with}} Daily News and Analysis that her friends in the Hindi film industry advised her not to take up the role as they felt it would be a [...] "career suicide" [...] for her.

500|$|Noonan's 1976 book {{chronicled the}} unwillingness by legal {{scholars}} {{to utilize the}} [...] "multitude of legal facts not mentioned by Cardozo and Andrews", even though the lower-court record in Palsgraf was reproduced in a civil procedure casebook in the 1950s. Noonan criticized Cardozo for not taking Palsgraf's circumstances into account when making his decision, and listed factors that may have influenced Cardozo against the plaintiff, including {{that he was a}} lifelong bachelor who did not have Palsgraf's experience of caring for children, and he may have frowned upon Wood's representation of Palsgraf (likely on a contingent fee, something not favored at the time). Posner, writing in 1990, disagreed with Noonan and with feminist critics following him, noting that judges take an oath to do equal justice to rich and poor, [...] "so the fact that Mrs. Palsgraf was poor would not have been a principled ground for bending the rules in her favor". Noonan had considered unjust the award of court costs against Palsgraf, and in her 2016 book, law professor Cathleen Kaveny agreed, [...] "the penalty imposed on Palsgraf for seeking justice through the courts was to deprive her, <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>of</b> the ability to support her children... All judges, however can develop empathy. And in telling the story of Helen Palsgraf, Judge Noonan makes a good case for why they should." ...|$|E
