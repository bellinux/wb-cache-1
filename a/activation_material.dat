40|$|Background: This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the development of ameliorating inventory models. The ameliorating inventory is the inventory of goods whose utility increases over the time by ameliorating <b>activation.</b> 	<b>Material</b> and Methods: This study is performed according to two areas: one is an economic order quantity (EOQ) model for the items whose utility is ameliorating in accordance with Weibull distribution, and the other is a partial selling quantity (PSQ) model developed for selling the surplus inventory accumulated by ameliorating activation with linear demand. The aim of this paper was to develop a mathematical model for inventory type concerned in the paper. Numerical examples were presented show the effect of ameliorating rate on inventory polices. 	 Results and Conclusions:  The inventory model for items with Weibull ameliorating is developed. For the case of small ameliorating rate (less than linear demand rate), EOQ model is developed, and for the case where ameliorating rate is greater than linear demand rate, PSQ model is developed.  . 	 ...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} different exercise sequences during agonist-antagonist paired sets on training volume, ratings of perceived exertion, and muscle <b>activation.</b> <b>Material</b> and methods: Thirteen recreationally trained males participated in this study. Two protocols were adopted in two non-consecutive days. BS — participants performed three repetition to failure sets (with 8 repetition maximum loads) of bench-press (BP) followed by seated row exercise in alternate manner. SB — the seated row (SR) was performed before bench press. Two-minute rest interval was adopted between sets and exercises. The number of repetitions and electromyography signals of the posterior deltoids (PD), biceps brachii (BB), pectoralis major (PM), and triceps brachii (TB) muscles were recorded during both exercises. Results: No significant differences were noted in training volume (1486. 6 ± 200. 3; 1492 ± 282. 5) and total work (22. 3 ± 1. 3; 22 ± 2) BS and SB sequences for BP, respectively. Higher training volume (1709. 7 ± 177. 6; 1424. 4 ± 196) and total work (25. 3 ± 1. 8; 21 ± 1. 6) were noted for SR under BS compared to SB.

Soluble P-selectin is a well-established marker of platelet activation. Aim : To show whether the long-term treatment of psoriasis with biological drugs can reduce elevated platelet <b>activation.</b> <b>Material</b> and methods : An observational study of 27 patients with chronic plaque psoriasis, treated with infliximab, adalimumab, etanercept, or ustekinumab for up to 12 months was conducted. Psoriasis area and severity index (PASI), serum P-selectin and interleukin (IL) - 6 were monitored throughout the treatment. Results : There was no significant correlation between PASI and platelet activation in our patients. After 3 months of treatment, {{a significant reduction in}} PASI and IL- 6 was found, while P-selectin was not significantly reduced. When a cohort of patients who had shown elevated P-selectin prior to the treatment was evaluated, a significant reduction in P-selectin was observed in all 8 patients following 3 months; a reduction that was sustained after 6 and 12 months of therapy. Conclusions : We conclude that PASI is not a good predictor of platelet activity in patients with PASI near to 10.

The development of new techniques andmaterials, such as laser-activated bleaching, has gained popularity. However, due to {{the small number of}} publications in this area, theiraggressiveness to the enamel is still not known. Objective: To determine the roughness of the enamel surface of bovine teeth bleached with and without laser <b>activation.</b> <b>Material</b> and methods: Twenty-seven bovine incisors were extracted, cleaned and stored in a 1 % thymol solution for 7 days and divided into 3 groups (n = 9) : I – without any treatment(control); II – submitted to 3 sessions of bleaching with a hydrogen peroxide gel at 37 % (Whiteness HP), 3 applications of 15 minutes per session; and III – submitted to 3 sessions of bleaching with the same gel, 3 applications of 9 minutes per session, activated by laser(Whitening Lase II). Between each session, the teeth were kept in saline solution. Upon completion of the bleaching treatment, the enamel surface roughness of the specimens was determined at the incisal area,using the Ra parameter. The results were statistically analyzed by Anova and Tukey’s test (α = 0. 05). Results: Group I presented the lowest mean values of roughness (2. 8 ± 1. 7 µm), followed by group III (3. 8 ± 1. 5 µm) and group II (4. 9 ± 1. 8 µm).

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the intrapulpal temperature variation after bleaching treatment with 35 % hydrogen peroxide using different sources of <b>activation.</b> <b>Material</b> and Methods: Twenty-four human teeth were sectioned in the mesiodistal direction providing 48 specimens, and were divided into 4 groups (n= 12) : (G 1) Control - Bleaching gel without light activation, (G 2) Bleaching gel + halogen light, (G 3) Bleaching gel + LED, (G 4) Bleaching gel + Nd: YAG Laser. The temperatures were recorded using a digital thermometer at 4 time points: before bleaching gel application, 1 min after bleaching gel application, during activation of the bleaching gel, and after the bleaching agent turned from a dark-red into a clear gel. Data were analyzed statistically by the Dunnet's test, ANOVA and Tukey's test (alpha= 0. 05). Results: The mean intrapulpal temperature values (degrees C) in the groups were: G 1 : 0. 617 +/- 0. 41; G 2 : 1. 800 +/- 0. 68; G 3 : 0. 975 +/- 0. 51; and G 4 : 4. 325 +/- 1. 09. The mean maximum temperature variation (MTV) values were: 1. 5 degrees C (G 1), 2. 9 degrees C (G 2), 1. 7 degrees C (G 3) and 6. 9 degrees C (G 4). When comparing the experimental groups to the control group, G 3 was not statistically different from G 1 (p> 0. 05), but G 2 and G 4 presented significantly higher (p< 0. 05) intrapulpal temperatures and MTV. The three experimental groups differed significantly (p< 0. 05) from each other.

40|$|Introduction: A {{link between}} serum hepatokine levels (proteins {{produced}} by the liver and acting distantly) and insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes has been recently suggested. Here, we wanted to explore the liver expression of several hepatokines at the initiation of a high fat diet in mice, {{as well as their}} relation with liver macrophage (Kupffer cell) <b>activation.</b> <b>Material</b> and methods: Male mice of 5 weeks of age were fed a normal diet (ND) or a high fat diet (HFD) for 3 days, known to induce steatosis and insulin resistance. A preventive Kupffer cell (KC) depletion was obtained by intravenous injection of clodronate loaded liposomes and compared with PBS liposomes. The mRNA expression of hepatokines (selenoprotein-P, fetuin-A, fibroblast growth factor 21, angiopoietin-like protein 3) was evaluated by RT-PCR on liver tissue. Results: Short term HFD induced steatosis, KC activation and insulin resistance with a significant increased expression of selenoprotein P (1. 6 fold, p< 0. 001), fetuin-A (1. 7 fold, p< 0. 01) and fibroblast growth factor 21 (9 fold, p< 0. 01). However, the liver expression of angiopoietin-like protein 3 remains unchanged under short term HFD. Kupffer cell depletion in this setting did not reduce hepatic steatosis but significantly ameliorated insulin sensitivity proved by clamp studies. This amelioration in insulin sensitivity in KC-depleted mice was associated with a significant decrease in fetuin A mRNA expression (0. 7 fold, p< 0. 001) compared to animals with KC. Interestingly, while selectively depleting liver macrophages without affecting adipose tissue macrophage infiltration, intravenous clodronate injection was associated with a significant reduction in epididymal adipose tissue expansion compared to PBS injection (1. 1 % of body weight versus 1. 6 % of body weight, p< 0. 001), suggesting a role of liver-derived products in peripheral tissue alterations associated with obesity. Conclusions: We demonstrate liver hepatokine overexpression at the initiation of HFD feeding, concurrent with hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance. Targeting KC in this setting improved insulin sensitivity and was associated with a decreased adiposity and a reduced liver fetuin A expression. The impact of this hepatokine on adipose tissue metabolism needs to be confirmed and the search for pathogenic liver-derived factors in obesity associated disorders intensified...|$|E

The high initial activity of the SiC highly irradiated components translates directly into a higher initial decay heat for these structures than for the well-protected steel-based components. However, after a one-hour cool-down period, the SiC decay heat drops by two decades to levels comparable to the steel-based components.
