50|$|When {{sulphanilic acid}} is added (in the picture its {{sulphonamide}} is shown instead), the nitrites form a diazonium salt. When the azo dye agent (N-alpha-naphthyl-ethylenediamine) is formed a pink colour develops. This diamine {{is used in}} place of the simpler and cheaper <b>alpha-naphthylamine</b> because this latter is a potent carcinogen and moreover the diamine forms a more polar and hence a much more soluble dye in acidic aqueous medium.|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} {{carcinogenesis}} is most advanced in bladder cancer through {{the study of}} what is called aniline bladder cancer. Bladder cancer has also {{played a key role in}} introducing the concept of 'occupational' cancer. Industrial Safety and Health Law defines various chemical substances as carcinogens of 'occupational' cancer, many of which are related to the urinary tract tumor, including benzidine, beta-naphthylamine, <b>alpha-naphthylamine,</b> 4 -aminodiphenyl, 4 -netrodiphenyl, auramine, magenta, orthotolidine, dianisidine, dichlorobenzidine and paradimethylaminoazobenzene. When a patient has been exposed to any of these substances, a diagnosis of 'occupational' cancer is made after consultation in the Central Labor Standards Council. Few bladder cancer patients are acknowledged as victims of 'occupational' cancer. In most cases the cause of bladder cancer remains unknown. However, cases of cancer caused by chemical substances are increasing, and many other chemical substances are probably carcinogenic. Although regulations on 'occupational' cancer have been completed, there are many cases of inconvenience in practice. In this report I investigated into such clinical problems and also studied the above-mentioned carcinogens...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to determine: (a) {{the rate of}} disappearance of glyceryl trinitrate from the blood stream after intravenous injection; (b) if any relationship exists between the rate of elimination and {{the duration of the}} characteristic effects, and (c) if tolerance has any effect on the rate of disappearance. No information on these aspects of the pharmacology of glyceryl trinitrate seems to be available. METHODS Our method for the quantitative determination of nitrates in body fluids is based on that proposed by Griess (1) and modified by Ilosvay (2). It depends on the formation of a pink azo-dye by suiphanilic acid and <b>alpha-naphthylamine</b> in the presence of nitrous acid. Griess originally used a mineral acid as the medium. By substituting acetic acid, Ilosvay found that the color develops more rapidly. The color will form in the presence of as little as 0. 001 mgm. nitrous acid per liter, but quantitative determina-tions are inaccurate at this low concentration. With a concen-tration of 0. 3 mgm. nitrous acid per liter, the red coloration is so â€˜This paper represents part of an extended study of the pharmacology of the nitrites and nitrates which was begun under the direction of Professor Arthur S. Loevenhart (1878 - 1929). The publication of much of this work has now to be undertaken by his colleagues. This paper is affectionately dedicated to his memory...|$|E
40|$|Rice (Oryza sativa L.) root systems play an {{important}} role in uptake of water and nutrients from soil. A 4 -year field experiment was conducted to determine the effects of different nutrient and water regimes on root growth by measuring the root diameter, root density, and root activity. Three nutrient regimes were used: (i) combined application of chemical fertilizers with farmyard manure (CM), (ii) integrated use of chemical fertilizers and wheat straw (CS), (iii) chemical fertilizers only (CK). Two soil moisture regimes included continuous waterlogging (CWL) and alternate wetting and drying (AWD). Incorporation of organic sources into paddy soil markedly improved root morphological characteristics of rice plant. In the alternate wetting and drying (AWD), root length density (RLD), and root weight density (RWD) for organic fertilization treatments (CS and CM) increased by 30 and 40 %, respectively, as compared with the sole chemical fertilization (CF). Relative to root activity, CWL had adverse effects on root active absorption area (AAA), root oxidation ability of <b>alpha-naphthylamine</b> (alpha-NA) (ROA), and root surface phosphatase (RSP) of rice plants treated by integrated application of organic and inorganic fertilizers. In particular for the CM treatment, the AAA, ROA, and RSP of rice plants by the continuous flooding decreased by 22, 28, and 35 %, respectively, compared to the alternately flooded regime. In the water regime of AWD, incorporation of organic manure significantly increased N, P, and K uptake by rice plants and facilitated the allocation and transfer of nutrient elements, especially P to rice ears and grains. This resulted in significant increases in the filled grains panicle(- 1), 1000 -grain weight and grain yield. The beneficial effects of integrated use of organic and mineral fertilizers on grain yield were significantly (P < 0. 05) decreased by the water regime of CWL. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V.
