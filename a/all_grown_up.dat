[...] J. Hoberman of The Village Voice said it is [...] "the most entertaining, least pretentious genre movie Steven Spielberg has made in the decade since Jurassic Park." [...] Randy Shulman of Metro Weekly said that [...] "the movie is a huge leap forward for the director, who moves once and for all into the world of adult movie making." [...] Roger Ebert called the film a [...] "masterpiece" [...] and said that when most directors of the period were putting [...] "their trust in technology", Spielberg had already mastered it, and was emphasizing [...] "story and character" [...] while merely using technology as a [...] "workman uses his tools". David Edelstein of Slate echoed the positive sentiments, saying [...] "t {{has been a long time}} since a Spielberg film felt so nimble, so unfettered, so free of self-cannibalizing."

Yet most stories of these women teachers emerge from other (Western) contexts, with little known about how changing education processes affect the gendered identities of women in other cultural settings. This paper explores how women teachers negotiate their gendered identities in Hong Kong, where modernization has already mingled with the indigenous Chinese culture.

All are ethnically Chinese, of different ages and at different stages of their personal and professional lives, and <b>all</b> have <b>grown</b> <b>up</b> in Hong Kong. A framework of post-colonial concepts of hybridity and border crossing helps to suggest how identity resources develop in relation to a range of contemporary practices which are experienced as both pressures and opportunities.

Boyne was not sorry; there had always been hours of the night when he felt the need of getting at his mother for reassurance as to forebodings which his fancy conjured up to trouble him in the wakeful dark. It was understood that he might freely do this, and though the judge inwardly fretted, he could not deny the boy the comfort of his mother's encouraging love. Boyne's visits woke him, but he slept the better for indulging in the young nerves that tremor from impressions against which the old nerves are proof. But now, in the strange fatality which seemed to involve him, Boyne could not go to his mother.
