5|$|Although press freedoms have {{improved}} {{since the first}} decade of the 21st century, the press is corrupt and beholden to special interests and political groups. Newspapers routinely self-censor to avoid government reprisals. The major radio and television stations are state-run and other communications, such as land-based telephones and telegraphs, <b>are</b> <b>largely</b> under government control. However, cell phone networks and Internet providers have increased dramatically since {{the first decade of}} the 21st century and <b>are</b> <b>largely</b> unregulated.|$|E

50|$|The Scotto family's palace <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> {{destroyed}} {{during the}} Second World War {{and the garden}} grew ever more degraded until 2008 when it <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> reconstructed and refitted.|$|R
50|$|Such {{theories}} were proposed before tectonic theory <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> understood, {{and therefore}} <b>are</b> now <b>largely</b> discredited.|$|R
5|$|Although colleges <b>are</b> <b>largely</b> {{concerned}} with welfare, leisure and accommodation, University College {{has been running}} the 'Durham Castle Lecture Series' since 2012. Past and forthcoming speakers include Saskia Sassen, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, Rowan Williams, Anthony Giddens, Justin Welby and Martin Wolf.|$|E
5|$|At the 2011 census, Shapinsay had a {{population}} of 307. The economy of the island is primarily based on agriculture {{with the exception of}} a few small businesses that <b>are</b> <b>largely</b> tourism-related. Plans for the construction of a wind turbine are under consideration.|$|E
5|$|Chopin's études <b>are</b> <b>largely</b> in {{straightforward}} ternary form. He {{used them}} to teach his own technique of piano playing—for instance playing double thirds (Op.25, No.6), playing in octaves (Op.25, No.10), and playing repeated notes (Op.10, No. 7).|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: One of Darrach's more {{prominent}} designs. The {{current design of}} the Elgin County Courthouse <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> due to {{his work in the}} late 19th century after the building <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> destroyed by fire ...|$|R

Youth members comprise {{a substantial portion}} of the movement; Elias Atallah stated that half of the party's members was 26 or younger.|$|E
5|$|Heavy metals {{up to the}} {{vicinity}} of iron (in the periodic table) <b>are</b> <b>largely</b> made via stellar nucleosynthesis. In this process, lighter elements from hydrogen to silicon undergo successive fusion reactions inside stars, releasing light and heat and forming heavier elements with higher atomic numbers.|$|E
50|$|Secret {{societies}} in Singapore have <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> eradicated {{as a security}} issue in the city-state. However many smaller groups remain today which attempt to mimic societies of the past. The membership of these societies <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> adolescent.|$|R

5000|$|The {{light of}} the inner portion of the solar corona <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> inherent, whereas the {{light of the}} outer portion <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> {{reflected}} sunlight, as proven at the Sumatra eclipse by means of spectroscopic and polariscopic observations.|$|R
5|$|Most {{academic}} sources {{maintain that}} the associations made between world events and Nostradamus's quatrains <b>are</b> <b>largely</b> the result of misinterpretations or mistranslations (sometimes deliberate) or else are so vague as to render them useless as evidence of any genuine predictive power.|$|E
5|$|People {{from the}} North-West and South-West provinces, {{which used to}} be a part of British Cameroons, <b>are</b> <b>largely</b> Protestant. The French-speaking regions of the {{southern}} and western regions <b>are</b> <b>largely</b> Catholic. Southern ethnic groups predominantly follow Christian or traditional African animist beliefs, or a syncretic combination of the two. People widely believe in witchcraft, and the government outlaws such practices. Suspected witches are often subject to mob violence. The Islamist jihadist group Boko Haram has been reported as operating in North Cameroon.|$|E
5|$|The Cleveland Ironstone Formation {{represents}} the Middle Lias or Upper Pliensbachian-Domerian. Two Ammonite zones (rock layers identified by particular fossils) <b>are</b> (<b>largely)</b> included: those indexed by Pleuroceras spinatum and Amaltheus margaritatus.|$|E
50|$|Despite her {{fame and}} {{recognition}} during her lifetime, Beach <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> neglected {{after her death}} in 1944 until the late 20th century. Efforts to revive interest in Beach's works have <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> successful {{during the last few}} decades.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} thought that {{through most of}} Earth's history, oceans <b>were</b> <b>largely</b> oxygen-deficient. During the Archean, euxinia <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> absent because of low {{availability}} of sulfate in the oceans, but during the Proterozoic, it would become more common.|$|R
50|$|The land {{being used}} <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> {{marshland}} and reclaimed from the sea: in particular, it <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> unoccupied. As a result, {{the social and}} fiscal costs of development are less than are usual for Chinese urban and industrial development.|$|R
5|$|The European bailouts <b>are</b> <b>largely</b> about {{shifting}} exposure {{from banks}} and others, who otherwise {{are lined up}} for losses on the sovereign debt they have piled up, onto European taxpayers.|$|E
5|$|The {{most basic}} type of {{meetings}} are all-comers track meets, which <b>are</b> <b>largely</b> small, local, informal competitions that allow {{people of all}} ages and abilities to compete. As meetings become more organized they can gain official sanctioning by the local or national association for the sport.|$|E
5|$|A small {{detachment}} of men performs a reconnaissance mission on Tall's orders {{to determine the}} strength of the Japanese bunker. Private Bell reports there are five machine guns in the bunker. He joins another small team of men (including Witt), led by Captain John Gaff, on a flanking mission to take the bunker. The operation is a success and C Company overruns one of the last Japanese strongholds on the island. The Japanese they find <b>are</b> <b>largely</b> malnourished and dying, and put up little resistance.|$|E
50|$|Until 1947, {{the second}} track <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> {{dismantled}} for reparations to the Soviet Union, but it <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> restored from Halle to Sangerhausen by 1954. In 1965, the line near Berga-Kelbra was relocated {{for the new}} Kelbra Dam on the Helme.|$|R

5|$|A {{study of}} 27 Milky Way neighbors {{found that in}} all dwarf galaxies, the central mass is {{approximately}} 10 million solar masses, {{regardless of whether the}} galaxy has thousands or millions of stars. This has led to the suggestion that galaxies <b>are</b> <b>largely</b> formed by dark matter, and that the minimum size may indicate a form of warm dark matter incapable of gravitational coalescence on a smaller scale.|$|E
5|$|According to the National Register of Historic Places nomination, {{the first}} bridge was {{constructed}} in the early 1870s by the New York and Boston Air Line Railroad. The details on this bridge <b>are</b> <b>largely</b> unknown, but contradictory evidence exists placing {{the construction of the}} bridge between 1876 and 1877. According to Marshall, the Air Line Railroad was completed in 1873 and the Colchester branch was completed in 1877.|$|E
5|$|After the September 11, 2001 {{terrorist}} attacks, government {{scrutiny of}} train and airplane passengers substantially increased, but bus passengers <b>are</b> <b>largely</b> free of it. Baggage is seldom inspected, and cash customers {{do not require}} identification. Greyhound says that security wands have been deployed on buses, {{but they do not}} appear to be routinely used.|$|E
25|$|MacKay's {{campaign}} <b>was</b> <b>largely</b> {{based on}} his leadership skills and a national organization rather than on policies or new directions. MacKay <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> viewed by political analysts as a Red Tory. The Honourable Peter MacKay voted in favour of same-sex marriage in 2006.|$|R
50|$|The liquor {{produced}} from the flowers <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> colourless, with a whitish tinge {{and not very}} strong. The taste is reminiscent of sake with a distinctive smell of mahua flowers. It is inexpensive and the production <b>is</b> <b>largely</b> done in home stills.|$|R
