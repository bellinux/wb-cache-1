5|$|Following the battle, Santa Anna was {{alternately}} {{viewed as}} a national hero or <b>a</b> <b>pariah.</b> Mexican perceptions of the battle often mirrored the prevailing viewpoint. Santa Anna had been disgraced following his capture at the Battle of San Jacinto, and many Mexican accounts of the battle were written by men who had been, or had become, his outspoken critics. Petite and many other historians believe {{that some of the}} stories, such as the execution of Crockett, may have been invented to further discredit Santa Anna. In Mexican history, the Texas campaign, including the Battle of the Alamo, was soon overshadowed by the Mexican–American War of 1846–48.|$|E

25|$|Aside {{from several}} {{memorials}} in Germany, {{after the war}} Litten remained unknown for decades because neither western nor communist governments found him suitable for their cold war propaganda. For the west, Litten had been too involved with communists and for communists, Litten's rejection of Stalinism made him <b>a</b> <b>pariah.</b>|$|E
25|$|Under Taylor's leadership, Liberia became {{internationally known}} as <b>a</b> <b>pariah</b> state {{due to its}} use of blood {{diamonds}} and illegal timber exports to fund the Revolutionary United Front in the Sierra Leone Civil War. The Second Liberian Civil War began in 1999 when Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy, a rebel group based in the northwest of the country, launched an armed insurrection against Taylor.|$|E
25|$|Yugoslav President Milošević {{survived the}} {{conflict}} and declared its outcome a major victory for Yugoslavia. He was, however, indicted for war crimes by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia along {{with a number of}} other senior Yugoslav political and military figures. His indictment led to Yugoslavia as a whole being treated as <b>a</b> <b>pariah</b> by much of the international community because Milošević was subject to arrest if he left Yugoslavia. The country's economy was badly affected by the conflict, and in addition to electoral fraud, this was a factor in the overthrow of Milošević.|$|E

25|$|During the 2003 {{parliamentary}} election, the SRS condemned {{cooperation with}} the war crimes tribunal, corruption scandals in government, poor living standards, and slightly moderated its formerly aggressive rhetoric. While it won a clear plurality with 28% of the vote and 82 seats, the party was still viewed as <b>a</b> <b>pariah</b> by its democratic rivals and was thus left in opposition. In the 2007 parliamentary election it won 29% of the vote and 81 seats. The SRS caucus in parliament elected Nikolić as its president and Aleksandar Vučić vice-president. Nikolić was later chosen as parliamentary speaker, supported by the DSS amidst a deadlock in coalition talks. He stepped down just five days later, as the DS and DSS agreed to form a coalition government.|$|E
25|$|Though Rushmore thought {{himself a}} hero for exposing Confidential, he became <b>a</b> <b>pariah</b> in the {{publishing}} world. He {{was no longer}} an editor at the Police Gazette, though he would stop by to scrounge up work. By 1957, he was reduced to writing occasional articles on hunting for outdoors magazines. His last known assignments were for True War magazine. In December 1957, Rushmore chased his wife and teenaged step-daughter Lynn out of their Manhattan home with a shotgun. Two days before Christmas, Frances and her daughter left their home on the advice of her psychiatrist and stayed with Frances' eldest daughter, 20-year-old Jean Dobbins of Greenwich Village. Mother and daughter later took over a friend's apartment. While Frances was under psychiatric care since the East River incident, Howard himself was now under psychiatric care.|$|E
25|$|As Shadow Chancellor in 1967 Iain Macleod {{helped to}} found the {{homeless}} charity Crisis. In 1968 Macleod defied a {{decision of the}} Shadow Cabinet by voting against the Labour Government’s Commonwealth Immigration Bill, believing {{it to be a}} breach of promises made by the Conservative Government to the Kenyan Asians. He fell out with his former friend Enoch Powell over the latter's 1968 Rivers of Blood speech, after which Macleod refused to speak to Powell again. Macleod's subsequent dealings with him were, Powell said, as if he was <b>a</b> <b>pariah</b> though Macleod 'knew what I said was not motivated by what is crudely called racialism, but he behaved as if he did not know'. Powell's speech generated huge public support and Macleod was horrified at the open racism of many {{of the members of the}} public who wrote to him on the topic, likening them to the disgusting creatures which are revealed when one overturns a stone.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{before her}} death, {{when asked if}} she had been too cruel in her writing, Phillips replied, [...] "We all have our standards. People behaved in an ugly and despicable fashion towards me. I felt no constraints. Nothing I did in my book is as mean as any of the people I wrote about." [...] She was {{similarly}} unrepentant about her subsequent expatriation, saying [...] "I wasn't <b>a</b> <b>pariah</b> because I was a drug-addicted, alcoholic, rotten person and not a good mother. I was <b>a</b> <b>pariah</b> because I hit them with a harsh, fluorescent light and rendered them as contemptible as they truly are." ...|$|E

500|$|The play {{starts with}} the term [...] "May I come", a warning to higher-caste people that Dalits had to cry out before {{entering}} any street, so as to not pollute the higher caste members. The Nayanar first clashes with his own Dalit brethren. They oppose his devotion for the Lord of Chidambaram, whom they call a Brahmin god. The Dalit elders— headed by Pariyakilavan— define his duties as <b>a</b> <b>pariah</b> and advise him to not confront caste rules. They tell him to worship the folk deities of the pariah, instead of Shiva, the god of Brahmanical Hinduism. The Dalits also feel that Nandanar needs {{to abide by the}} social norms and give up his taboo idea of entering a temple.|$|E
500|$|Eberhardt and Ehnni {{relocated}} to Ténès in July 1902 after Ehnni obtained employment {{there as a}} translator. Eberhardt was incorrigibly bad with her money, spending anything she received immediately on tobacco, books, and gifts for friends, and pawning her meagre possessions or asking for loans when she realised {{there was no money}} left for food. This behaviour made her even more of <b>a</b> <b>pariah</b> among the other European residents of the town. Eberhardt would frequently leave for weeks at a time, being either summoned to Algiers by Barrucand or sent on assignments. She was given a regular column in his newspaper, where she wrote about the life and customs of Bedouin tribes. Both Ehnni and Eberhardt's health deteriorated, with Eberhardt regularly suffering from bouts of malaria. She was also probably affected by syphillis.|$|E
500|$|Succeeding {{in their}} mission, {{a small band}} of demon warriors known as the Quarter Knights kept watch over the body of Mother in their {{fortress}} protected behind a powerful force field, and began gathering information as to the whereabouts of the guardian statues with the hope of one day reviving her and claiming Filgaia as their own. As time passed, talk of the ancient invasion began to dwindle, though stories of demonic weaponry such as [...] "ARMs" [...] and robotic soldiers still persisted in the minds of many. When a mysterious child named Rudy drifted into the small town of Surf, he came with an ARM at his side.

500|$|And the Band Played On was {{critically}} acclaimed {{and became a}} best-seller. Judith Eannarino of the Library Journal called it [...] "one {{of the most important}} books of the year", upon its release. It made Shilts both a star and <b>a</b> <b>pariah</b> for his coverage of the disease and the bitter politics in the gay community. He described his motivation to undertake the writing of the book in an interview after its release, saying, [...] "Any good reporter could have done this story, but I think the reason I did it, and no one else did, is because I am gay. It was happening to people I cared about and loved." [...] The book was later adapted into an HBO film of the same name in 1993. Shilts was tested for HIV while he was writing the book; he died of complications from AIDS in 1994.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{being made}} <b>a</b> <b>pariah,</b> Brian is banned from every bar and {{convenience}} store in Quahog, {{making it impossible}} for him to drink. Desperate, and suffering from delirium tremens (he hallucinates seeing several alcoholic beverages begging him to drink them), Brian fakes his repentance and convinces Meg to cease all hostilities against him so he can get back to drinking, but she takes him to burn books that are [...] "harmful to God" [...] (including On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin, A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking, and a book titled Logic for First Graders). A disgusted Brian admits his bluff and attempts to convince Meg that what she is doing is wrong. When Meg refuses to listen, Brian points out to her that if there were truly a loving God, then he would not have created Meg to have an attractive mother like Lois but have her be unattractive like Peter, and that she would not be living with a family that holds her in contempt and otherwise pretends that she does not exist (along with not even caring enough about her to get her a mumps shot). Feeling ashamed, Meg concedes to Brian's argument and apologizes for her behavior, confessing that she does not know how she can feel loved. Brian then assures her that the answers are inside herself, and the real meaning of their existence is out there somewhere. Afterward, it is revealed that the entire Family Guy universe takes place within the molecules of a lampshade in the shared bedroom of Adam West and Rob Lowe.|$|E
500|$|Henry faced many {{challenges}} to secure possession of his father’s and grandfathers’ lands {{that required the}} reassertion and extension of old suzerainties. [...] In 1162 Theobald, Archbishop of Canterbury, died, and Henry saw an opportunity to re-establish {{what he saw as}} his rights over the church in England by appointing his friend Thomas Becket to succeed him. [...] Instead, Becket proved to be an inept politician whose defiance alienated the king and his counsellors. [...] Henry and Becket clashed repeatedly: over church tenures, Henry’s brother’s marriage and taxation. Henry reacted by getting Becket, {{and other members of the}} English episcopate, to recognise sixteen ancient customsgoverning relations between the king, his courts, and the churchin writing for the first time in the Constitutions of Clarendon. When Becket tried to leave the country without permission, Henry attempted to ruin him by laying a number of suits relating to Becket’s time as chancellor. In response Becket fled into exile for five years. Relations later improved, allowing Becket's return, but soured again when Becket saw the coronation of Henry's son as coregent by the Archbishop of York as a challenge to his authority and excommunicated those who had offended him. When he heard the news, Henry said: [...] "What miserable drones and traitors have I nurtured and promoted in my household who let their lord be treated with such shameful contempt by a low-born clerk." [...] Three of Henry's men killed Becket in Canterbury Cathedral after Becket resisted a botched attempt to arrest him. Within Christian Europe Henry was widely considered complicit in Becket's death. The opinion of this transgression against the church made Henry <b>a</b> <b>pariah,</b> so in penance he walked barefoot into Canterbury Cathedral where he was scourged by monks.|$|E

And reticence is but a habit. Practise it for a year, and you will find it harder to betray than to conceal your thoughts. It hath its joy also.
