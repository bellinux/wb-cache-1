40|$|Although workers, employers, and {{insurance}} companies by 1910 supported the adoption of workers' compensation, they fiercely debated the specific features of the legislation. In this paper we examine how workers' compensation benefit levels were determined {{in the political process}} of forging compromises across interest groups, and even within individual groups. A quantitative analysis of the benefit levels in each state between the time of adoption and 1930 shows several important trends. Employers in dangerous industries effectively imposed limits on <b>accident</b> <b>benefits,</b> while organized labor and the commissions that administered the laws were instrumental in achieving higher expected benefit levels. Political reformers that gained control of state legislatures {{in the early twentieth century}} aided organized labor in achieving their goal of improving workers' compensation <b>accident</b> <b>benefits.</b> The paper also presents case-studies of the political struggle over benefits that occurred in" three states [...] Ohio, Minnesota, and Missouri. These qualitative descriptions of the fight over benefit levels provide a more detailed picture of the political process through which workers' compensation was created because the cross-state quantitative study largely abstracts away from the political nuances that shaped workers' compensation legislation. ...|$|R

METHODS: Records of benefit decisions from the National Benefits System of the National Social Security Institute for the State of Bahia in 2000 were utilized. Occupational accidents were defined {{in accordance with the}} clinical diagnoses of External Causes, Injuries and Poisoning (SS- 00 to T 99) of the International Classification of Diseases, 10 th Revision, and with the benefit type, which distinguishes between occupational and non-occupational health problems. RESULTS: A total of 31, 096 benefits granted due to illnesses or health problems were studied. Of these, 2, 857 (7. 3 %) were caused by work accidents. Greater proportions were found among workers in the manufacturing, construction, electricity and gas industries, accounting for 18 % of the total benefits. The costs of occupational <b>accident</b> <b>benefits</b> were estimated to be R$ 8. 5 million, with around half a million work days lost during the year studied.

40|$|Thesis (M. Soc. Sc.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, [2008]. This study {{aimed at}} {{exploring}} the agenda setting {{process of the}} Road Accident Fund (RAF), a road accident compensation system operating in South Africa using Kingdon's model of Agenda Setting. This study focused on the period between 1996 when the RAF was introduced to 2005 when the focus in the Fund was put mainly {{on how to deal}} with fraud and corruption issues. When the RAF was put into place, the main aim was to establish a compensation system that will be able to deal with the effects of road accidents that the people suffer. These are mostly the vulnerable road users and public transport passengers who account for most of the road casualties. However there has been a shift in the focus of the Road Accident Fund Act of 1996, hence the majority of the people who were meant to be beneficiaries ended up not benefiting from the Fund due to corruption. A theoretical framework based on the work of John Kingdon (1995) is used to explore the developments in the RAF that led to the Road <b>Accident</b> <b>Benefit</b> Scheme (RABS) as a proposed system. Qualitative research method was used in order to trace the unfolding of the events and action of participants in the RAF in order to see whether the developments in the Fund can be explained using Kingdon's framework of agenda setting. Historical documents were used to collect data and to trace the chronology of events. These include formal records, including Annual Reports on the RAF and media articles, including newspapers. Content analysis method was done on material such as: Annual Reports on the Road Accident Fund, Meeting Minutes, Parliamentary Proceedings, Newspaper Articles and Speeches, primarily from the Department of Transport in order to analyse data. The findings of this study revealed that using Kingdon's theory of agenda setting, it is possible to come to a better understanding of the agenda setting process that led to a current state of the RAF. In the RAF case study, the three policy streams proposed by Kingdon namely: problem stream, policy stream and political stream, were identified. In the problem stream, the financial 'crisis' together with feedback from the formal as well as the media reports that indicated that the financial condition of the RAF was getting worse served as an indication that there was a problem in the Fund. Several ideas were generated in the policy stream of the Fund. Amongst other things, studies, discussions, hearings, meetings and conferences conducted by the RAF Commission for the purpose of investigating the Fund and come up with alternative solutions, created pressure for policy change. While RABS which incorporated in it a "no fault" system of compensation was proposed as a solution by the RAF Commission, liquidation of the Fund was also a concern. In the political stream, the national mood, change of administration and interest group pressure were evident and contributed to the agenda setting of the RAF. Media reports also contributed to the whole agenda setting process of the Fund. The implications of the analysis for future processes are drawn...|$|E

In this example, the drivers insured may also become liable for other expenses related to damaging the telephone pole, such as loss of service claims (by the telephone company), depending on the jurisdiction. An example of bodily injury is where an insured driver causes bodily harm to a third party and the insured driver is deemed responsible for the injuries. However, in some jurisdictions, the third party would first exhaust coverage for <b>accident</b> <b>benefits</b> through their own insurer (assuming they have one) and/or would have to meet a legal definition of severe impairment {{to have the right to}} claim (or sue) under the insured driver's (or first party's) policy.

MÉTODOS: Utilizam-se registros dos despachos de benefícios do Sistema Único de Benefícios do Instituto Nacional de Seguridade Social da Bahia, em 2000. Acidentes de trabalho foram definidos com o diagnóstico clínico para Causas Externas, Lesões e Envenenamentos (SS- 00 a T 99) da Classificação Internacional de Doenças 10 ª Revisão, e o tipo de benefício que distingue problemas de saúde ocupacionais e não ocupacionais. RESULTADOS: Foram estudados 31. 096 benefícios concedidos por doenças ou agravos à saúde, dos quais 2. 857 (7, 3 %) eram devidos a acidentes de trabalho. Maiores proporções foram estimadas entre os trabalhadores da indústria da transformação e construção/eletricidade/gás, 18 % do total dos benefícios.
