5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that schoolchildren in Malawi {{are at risk}} of being exposed to HIV by their teachers, who sometimes value them as sexual partners because they believe that children have not yet been exposed to the virus. Children are particularly vulnerable to exploitation by adults who offer them money in exchange for sex; because they are often unable to afford basic necessities, they might feel compelled to accept gifts in exchange for sex out of desperation. Interviews indicate that teachers and school administrators in Malawi often misinterpret the definition of sexual assault, as some believe that sexual relations between teachers and students are appropriate as long as the children have consented. Although most schools have strict policies against sexual abuse, children are often hesitant to accuse adults of wrongdoing, and many <b>administrators</b> <b>are</b> unwilling or unable to investigate the truth behind the accusations.|$|E
5|$|Wes and Rui {{then go to}} Realgam Tower. All four <b>administrators</b> <b>are</b> {{there and}} ready to face Wes again. After doing so, he is granted access to the Colosseum {{at the top of}} the building. There, he is greeted by a large crowd. A Cipher man named Nascour tells Wes that he will have to face four trainers. After Wes defeats all four trainers, Nascour fights him. Once defeated, Nascour tries to leave, only to be {{interrupted}} by Es Cade. Es Cade reveals that he is really none other than Evice, the head of Cipher, and battles Wes. When Wes defeats him, Evice attempts to escape by helicopter, but the legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh swoops in and blasts it out of the sky. Evice and Nascour are presumably arrested.|$|E

50|$|Accordingly, an <b>Administrator</b> <b>is</b> {{appointed}} {{when the}} Governor-General dies, resigns or is absent from Australia. The <b>Administrator</b> <b>is</b> styled either <b>Administrator</b> of the Commonwealth or, less commonly, Administrator of the Government of the Commonwealth. By convention, the <b>Administrator</b> <b>is</b> usually the longest serving state Governor, {{who holds a}} dormant commission from the sovereign (currently Elizabeth II).|$|R
50|$|The plan <b>administrator</b> <b>is</b> {{the entity}} charged with general plan {{administration}} duties, {{similar to a}} trustee {{in the case of}} a trust. The plan <b>administrator</b> <b>is</b> always a plan fiduciary; the plan administrator can share the fiduciary duty with other entities, but the plan <b>administrator</b> <b>is</b> required to assume some fiduciary duty and cannot disclaim that duty. In general, the plan <b>administrator</b> <b>is</b> the employer - but new trends in the industry are seeing more and more groups outsourcing plan administrator duties to TPAs or other entities for a fee.|$|R

25|$|Disable Admin Approval Mode (UAC prompts for administrators) entirely; note that, {{while this}} {{disables}} the UAC confirmation dialogs, {{it does not}} disable Windows' built-in LUA feature, which means that users, even those marked as <b>administrators,</b> <b>are</b> still limited users with no true administrative access.|$|E
50|$|The <b>administrator</b> <b>was</b> appointed, by the {{national}} government, for a five-year term {{and could not be}} removed except by the Governor General for “cause assigned”.

25|$|On September 24, 2013, {{a session}} cookie {{persistence}} security flaw {{was reported in}} Ruby on Rails. In a default configuration, the entire session hash is stored within a session cookie known as CookieStore, allowing any authenticated session possessing the session cookie to log in as the target user {{at any time in}} the future. As a workaround, <b>administrators</b> <b>are</b> advised to configure cookies to be stored on the server using mechanisms such as ActiveRecordStore.|$|E
25|$|Most {{distributions}} install packages, {{including the}} kernel and other core operating system components, in a predetermined configuration. Few now require or even permit configuration adjustments at first install time. This makes installation less daunting, particularly for new users, {{but is not}} always acceptable. For specific requirements, much software must be carefully configured to be useful, to work correctly with other software, or to be secure, and local <b>administrators</b> <b>are</b> often obliged to spend time reviewing and reconfiguring assorted software.|$|E
50|$|Certain of the Administrator's {{powers and}} {{functions}} are {{set forth in}} the Tokelau Act 1948, as amended from time to time. (The office of <b>Administrator</b> <b>is</b> not, however, created by this Act.) The most important power of the <b>Administrator</b> <b>is</b> the power to disallow any Rule passed by the Parliament of Tokelau (the General Fono); this must, however, be done within 30 days after the <b>Administrator</b> <b>is</b> sent a copy of the Rule.|$|R

25|$|Phishing is {{typically}} {{carried out by}} email spoofing or instant messaging, and it often directs users to enter personal information at a fake website, {{the look and feel}} of which are identical to the legitimate one and the only difference is the URL of the website in concern. Communications purporting to be from social web sites, auction sites, banks, online payment processors or IT <b>administrators</b> <b>are</b> often used to lure victims. Phishing emails may contain links to websites that are infected with malware.|$|E
25|$|Hedge fund <b>administrators</b> <b>are</b> {{responsible}} for operations, accounting, and valuation services. This back office support allows fund managers {{to concentrate on}} trades. Administrators also process subscriptions and redemptions, and perform various shareholder services. Hedge funds in the United States {{are not required to}} appoint an administrator, and all of these functions can be performed by an investment manager. A number of conflict of interest situations may arise in this arrangement, particularly in the calculation of a fund's net asset value (NAV). Some funds voluntarily employ external auditors, thereby offering a greater degree of transparency.|$|E
25|$|If these {{comments}} were, indeed, spoken by Mr. Pelini, we are extremely disappointed, {{but it only}} reaffirms the decision that he should {{no longer be a}} leader of young men at Nebraska. His habitual use of inappropriate language, and his personal and professional attacks on <b>administrators,</b> <b>are</b> antithetical to the values of our university. His behavior is consistent with a pattern of unprofessional, disrespectful behavior directed by Mr. Pelini toward the passionate fans of Nebraska, employees of the university and, most concerning, our student-athletes. This behavior is not tolerated at the University of Nebraska and, among many other concerns, played a role in his dismissal.|$|E

25|$|School <b>administrators</b> <b>are</b> {{consulting}} with architects about {{the construction of}} a handicapped elevator in front of the school's most recognizable building, Wood Hall. Architects unveiled a plan for a four-story elevator tower in front of the school's signature archway, complete with a bridge to take handicapped students into the building. Staff were shocked at the drastic proposal, which would be costly and would have an extensive impact on many of the campus' most well-known architectural features. An elevator of some sort may be necessary to comply with handicapped accessibility laws. Administrators have formed a committee to look into alternative ways to provide that accessibility.|$|E
25|$|As more {{students}} take courses and assessments online, {{there is a}} persistent perception that {{it is easier to}} cheat in an online class than a face-to-face course. Moreover, there are online services that offer to prepare any kind of homework of high school and college level and take online tests for students. While <b>administrators</b> <b>are</b> often aware of such websites, they have been unsuccessful in curbing cheating in homework and non-proctored online tests, resorting to a recommendation by the Ohio Mathematics Association to derive at least 80% of the grade of online classes from proctored tests. In addition, colleges and universities are increasingly turning to online proctoring services to oversee tens of thousands of exams per year.|$|E
25|$|When public administrators perform {{emotional}} labor, {{many scholars}} argue <b>administrators</b> <b>are</b> dealing with significantly more sensitive situations than {{employees in the}} service industry. The {{reason for this is}} because they are {{on the front lines of}} the government, and are expected to by citizens to serve them quickly and efficiently. When confronted by a citizen or a co-worker public administrators use emotional sensing to size up the emotional state of the citizen in need. Workers then take stock of their own emotional state in order to make sure that the emotion they are expressing is appropriate to their roles. Simultaneously, they have to determine how to act in order to elicit the desired response from the citizen as well as from co-workers. Public Administrators perform emotional labor through five different strategies: Psychological First Aid, Compartments and Closets, Crazy Calm, Humor, and Common Sense.|$|E
