40|$|Abstract Background Migraine {{and other}} {{headache}} disorders affect {{a large percentage}} of the population and cause debilitating pain. Activation and sensitization of the trigeminal primary <b>afferent</b> <b>neurons</b> innervating the dura and cerebral vessels is a crucial step in the “headache circuit”. Many dural <b>afferent</b> <b>neurons</b> respond to algesic and inflammatory agents. Given the clear role of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family of channels in both sensing chemical stimulants and mediating inflammatory pain, we investigated the expression of TRP channels in dural <b>afferent</b> <b>neurons.</b> Methods We used two fluorescent tracers to retrogradely label dural <b>afferent</b> <b>neurons</b> in adult mice and quantified the abundance of peptidergic and non-peptidergic neuron populations using calcitonin gene-related peptide immunoreactivity (CGRP-ir) and isolectin B 4 (IB 4) binding as markers, respectively. Using immunohistochemistry, we compared the expression of TRPV 1 and TRPA 1 channels in dural <b>afferent</b> <b>neurons</b> with the expression in total trigeminal ganglion (TG) neurons. To examine the distribution of TRPM 8 channels, we labeled dural <b>afferent</b> <b>neurons</b> in mice expressing farnesylated enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFPf) from a TRPM 8 locus. We used nearest-neighbor measurement to predict the spatial association between dural <b>afferent</b> <b>neurons</b> and neurons expressing TRPA 1 or TRPM 8 channels in the TG. Results and conclusions We report that the size of dural <b>afferent</b> <b>neurons</b> is significantly larger than that of total TG neurons and facial skin afferents. Approximately 40 % of dural <b>afferent</b> <b>neurons</b> exhibit IB 4 binding. Surprisingly, the percentage of dural <b>afferent</b> <b>neurons</b> containing CGRP-ir is significantly lower than those of total TG neurons and facial skin afferents. Both TRPV 1 and TRPA 1 channels are expressed in dural <b>afferent</b> <b>neurons.</b> Furthermore, nearest-neighbor measurement indicates that TRPA 1 -expressing neurons are clustered around a subset of dural <b>afferent</b> <b>neurons.</b> Interestingly, TRPM 8 -expressing neurons are virtually absent in the dural afferent population, nor do these neurons cluster around dural <b>afferent</b> <b>neurons.</b> Taken together, our results suggest that TRPV 1 and TRPA 1 but not TRPM 8 channels likely contribute to the excitation of dural <b>afferent</b> <b>neurons</b> and the subsequent activation of the headache circuit. These results provide an anatomical basis for understanding further the functional significance of TRP channels in headache pathophysiology. </p...|$|R

40|$|After a {{long period}} of {{inconclusive}} observations, the intrinsic primary <b>afferent</b> <b>neurons</b> of the intestine have been identified. The intestine is thus equipped with two groups of <b>afferent</b> <b>neurons,</b> those with cell bodies in cranial and dorsal root ganglia, and these recently identified <b>afferent</b> <b>neurons</b> with cell bodies in the wall of the intestine. The first, tentative, identification of intrinsic primary <b>afferent</b> <b>neurons</b> was by their morphology, which is type II in the terminology of Dogiel. These are multipolar neurons, with some axons that project to other nerve cells in the intestine and other axons that project to the mucosa. Definitive identification came only recently when action potentials were recorded intracellularly from Dogiel type II neurons in response to chemicals applied to the lumenal surface of the intestine and in response to tension in the muscle. These action potentials persisted after all synaptic transmission was blocked, proving the Dogiel type II neurons to be primary <b>afferent</b> <b>neurons.</b> Less direct evidence indicates that intrinsic primary <b>afferent</b> <b>neurons</b> that respond to mechanical stimulation of the mucosal lining are also Dogiel type II neurons. Electrophysiologically, the Dogiel type II neurons are referred to as AH neurons. They exhibit broad action potentials that are followed by early and late afterhyperpolarizing potentials. The intrinsic primary <b>afferent</b> <b>neurons</b> connect with each other at synapses where they transmit via slow excitatory postsynaptic potentials, that last for tens of seconds. Thus the intrinsic primary <b>afferent</b> <b>neurons</b> form self-reinforcing networks. The slow excitatory postsynaptic potentials counteract the late afterhyperpolarizing potentials, thereby increasing the period during which the cells can fire action potentials at high rates. Intrinsic primary <b>afferent</b> <b>neurons</b> transmit to second order neurons (interneurons and motor neurons) via both slow and fast excitatory postsynaptic potentials. Excitation of the intrinsic primary <b>afferent</b> <b>neurons</b> by lumenal chemicals or mechanical stimulation of the mucosa appears to be indirect, via the release of active compounds from endocrine cells in the epithelium. Stretch-induced activation of the intrinsic primary <b>afferent</b> <b>neurons</b> is at least partly dependent on tension generation in smooth muscle, that is itself sensitive to stretch. The intrinsic primary <b>afferent</b> <b>neurons</b> of the intestine are the only vertebrate primary <b>afferent</b> <b>neurons</b> so far identified with cell bodies in a peripheral organ.

Stretch-activated ion channels have been categorized into three distinct [...] "superfamilies": the ENaC/DEG family, the TRP family, and the K1 selective family. These channels are involved with bodily functions such as blood pressure regulation. They are shown to be associated with many cardiovascular diseases. Stretch-activated channels were first observed in chick skeletal muscles by Falguni Guharay and Frederick Sachs in 1983 and the results were published in 1984.

50|$|The axon reflex arc is {{distinct}} from the spinal cord reflex arc. In the spinal cord reflex pathway the <b>afferent</b> <b>neuron</b> transmits information to spinal cord interneurons. These interneurons act collectively, process {{and make sense of}} inbound stimuli, and stimulate effector neurons acting as an integration center. The effector neurons leaving the integration center transmit a response to the original tissue the reflex arose resulting in a response. The axon reflex results in a localized response to only the locally innervated cells of the single neuron where the signal originated. The axon reflex pathway does not include an integration center or synapse that relays communication between neurons in the spinal cord reflex. The stimulus, therefore, is diverted to the effector organ without entering the neuronal cell body and therefore indicates that the axon reflex is not a true reflex where afferent impulses pass through the central nervous system before stimulating efferent neurons.|$|E

50|$|Afferent neurons' somas {{are located}} in the ganglia of the {{peripheral}} nervous system, and the axons of these cells travel from ganglion to ganglion and lead back to the spinal cord. The majority of these are unipolar neurons in that they have a single axon leaving the cell body and is sent towards the sensory organ. All of the axons in the dorsal root, which contains afferent nerve fibers, are used in the transduction of somatosensory information. Somatosensory receptors include senses such as pain, touch, temperature, itch, and stretch. For example, a specific muscle fiber called an intrafusal muscle fiber is a type of <b>afferent</b> <b>neuron</b> that lies parallel to the extrafusal muscle fibers thus functions as a stretch receptor by detecting muscle length. All of these sensations travel along the same general pathway towards the brain, from the dorsal root ganglion they travel to the spinal cord.

5000|$|The {{posterior}} column has {{a prominent}} role in the pain system, it is the first central relay in the nociceptive pathway. The first order <b>afferent</b> <b>neuron</b> carries sensory information to the second order neuron in the dorsal horn. The axon of the second order neuron, if it is a projection neuron and not an interneuron, then goes to the third order neuron in the thalamus. The thalamus is known as the [...] "gateway to the cortex". The third order neuron then goes to the cerebral cortex. The afferent neurons are either A fibers or C fibers. A fibers are myelinated allowing for faster signal conduction. Among these there are A beta fibers which are faster and carry information about non-painful touch and A delta fibers which are slower and thinner than the A beta fibers. The C fibers are not myelinated and therefore slower. C fibers that carry nociceptive signals can be divided into two types: fibers that contain neuropeptides, like substance P, and fibers that do not contain neuropeptides. The two types terminate in very different areas. Non-peptidergic C fibers are linked to the skin, where they innervate the epidermis while peptidergic C fibers innervate other tissues and deeper parts of the skin.|$|E

We used retrograde tracing to identify corneal <b>afferent</b> <b>neurons</b> in the trigeminal ganglion and double label {{in situ hybridization}} and/or immunohistochemistry to determine their molecular profile. In addition, we used immunohistochemistry to reveal the neurochemistry and structure of TRPV 1 expressing nerve endings in the corneal epithelium.

There was no co-expression of TRPV 1 and Piezo 2 in corneal <b>afferent</b> <b>neurons,</b> but 6 % of TRPV 1 neurons co-expressed TRPM 8. The TRPV 1 expressing corneal <b>afferent</b> <b>neurons</b> could be divided into 3 subpopulations {{on the basis of}} calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and/or or glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor family receptor alpha 3 (GFRα 3) co-expression.

In contrast, those that only co-expressed GFRα 3 had ramifying endings that branched and terminated in the squamous cell layer, whereas those that only co-expressed CGRP had simple endings in the basal epithelium. This study shows that the majority of TRPV 1 expressing corneal <b>afferent</b> <b>neurons</b> (> 90 %) are likely to be polymodal nociceptors. Furthermore, TRPV 1 expressing corneal <b>afferent</b> <b>neurons</b> can be subdivided into specific subpopulations based on their molecular phenotype, nerve terminal morphology and distribution in the corneal epithelium...|$|R
