500|$|The first Mega Man game—released in 1987—was not {{successful}} {{enough to justify}} the immediate development of a sequel.

He started piano lessons at age seven after his mother detected his enthusiasm for banging on his grandmother's neighbour's piano. He switched teachers at age 11 to a local piano master, Charles Seed. Passing the 11+-entrance exam to attend grammar school, he learned ukulele playing in a skiffle group formed at school. Andrews' earliest introductions to music came through the radio and his teenage next-door neighbor who bought Elvis and Bill Haley records. Hanging out at a local penny arcade in Blackpool while on a family holiday, he was exposed to The Everly Brothers, where he would sing along to the harmonies. At 13, he discovered Chuck Berry, the Stones, the Beatles and girls, not necessarily in that order, stopped piano lessons, and learned to play bass and electric guitar. <b>A</b> <b>whole</b> <b>new</b> musical <b>world</b> opened up when Andrews heard Howlin’ Wolf and the Chicago blues, and learning those infamous guitar riffs, played underage in pubs.

After his parents divorced at age 3, Blu remained in Los Angeles and began attending Sinai Academy in Beverly Hills, California. He displayed musical talent at an early age, having been in select vocals groups in his early schooling. His mother, Shary Klamer, an actress and trained singer, taught him his basics of singing and piano. At age 10 {{he moved on to}} attend El Rodeo public school in Beverly Hills and subsequently, began attending Beverly Hills High School (a year early) at age 13. Blu also began studying martial arts from age six. Martial Arts study has been a regular part of Blu's life and he has been studying Chinese Shaolin Kung Fu, Kenpo and Qigong for over 12 years. Music, especially singing, would also continue to be a major part of Blu's extracurricular activities through grammar school, high school and college. But, Blu's rebellious nature found him at constant conflict with his music teachers and chorus leaders and thus music became an individual passion of Blu's. Early on, Blu's major musical influences came from pop artists like Harry Connick, Jr., Sting, Billy Joel, Elton John and George Michael. He enjoyed entertaining whoever was around with his renditions of songs like We Are In Love, Faith and Your Song. Because of his mother's love for classical music and opera as well, Blu also developed a passion for these music genres. Reluctantly at first, Blu became enamoured with voices like Luciano Pavarotti and Richard Tucker (who was also a family friend of Blu's grandparents). Classical composers like Beethoven and Bach and Opera composers like Puccini and Bizet (notably, Carmen) opened up <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>new</b> musical <b>world</b> to him.|$|R
40|$|A {{few years}} ago, {{at the end}} of the 1990 s, what was to be called the new economy emerged in the USA and Europe. The new economy was to be {{characterized}} by a faith in uninterrupted economic growth and rapid technical innovation. The mass media reported on new companies which would conquer the future as the value of their shares rose on the stock market. One type of company was the Internet consultan-cies. An example of these was the Swedish Framfab (short for Framtidsfabriken, meaning “Factory of the Future”). They were to produce Internet solutions for customers such as IKEA and Volvo. But above all they produced hopes and dreams about a bright, IT-supported future. Headed by the charismatic CEO Jonas Birgersson, there was talk of how Framfab would both create and conquer the future. What actually happened in companies like Framfab? There seemed to be a tension between the high-fl own optimistic rhetoric about <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>new</b> networked <b>world</b> and the actual activities pursued in the companies of the new economy. It was with an interest in this tension that I began an ethnological study of Framfab in 1999. I wanted to investigate the culture that was shaped in a company that placed itself on the leading edge of the new economy. I spent time at one of the company’s offi ces, interviewing the employees and observing what went on. The result of my study then became my doctoral dissertation. This paper can be seen as a “lite version ” of some of the arguments which I make in the dissertation. One point of access to my analysis of work at Framfab was to ask which objects were crucial there. Computers were the company’s primary means of production and were of course important, but a num-ber of pastel-colored pieces of plastic also acquired a signifi cant role.

40|$|After {{the first}} formal {{description}} of "animacules" by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in 1683, we {{became aware of}} <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>new</b> hidden microscopic <b>world,</b> of which one component is the bacteria. Technological advances in subsequent years allowed us to examine these organisms in ever greater detail, {{to the point that}} protein synthesis could be clearly observed using the electron microscope (Miller et al. 1970). Despite all this activity, apart from the observation of large subcellular particles,such as glycogen granules, the bacterial cell was considered to be a bag of undifferentiated cytoplasm. Cells were so small, all the necessary biochemical reactions needed for survival would be able to occur through simple diffusion. Since the mid- 1990 s, it has become increasingly clear that small though they are, there is a considerable level of subcellular organisation within bacterial cells, and this is important in many processes, including cell division and chromosome segregation. We are just beginning to scratch the surface and are beginning to use an increasing number of sophisticated techniques to probe bacterial cell structure. This chapter focuses on the subcellular organisation of chromosomes and their segregation, cell division, transcription, translation, membranes, and the integrated systems involved in asymmetric division. Most of what we know regarding bacterial subcellular organisation is focused on the model Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Grampositive Bacillus subtilis cells, although the intrinsically asymmetric Caulobacter crescentus has also proved a fertile subject for study...|$|R

2500|$|Lomax, {{aware of}} the {{deficiencies}} of his early education, still wished to improve himself, however, and on September 26, 1906, he {{jumped at the chance}} to attend Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, as a graduate student, having previously received a $500 stipend: The Austin Teaching Fellowships. Here he had the opportunity to study under Barrett Wendell and George Lyman Kittredge, two renowned scholars who actively encouraged his interest in cowboy songs. Harvard, in fact, was the center of American folklore studies (then viewed as a subsidiary of English literature, itself a novel field of scholarship in comparison with the more traditional study of rhetoric focused on classical languages and geared to preparing lawyers and clergy). Kittredge, in addition to being a well-known scholar of Chaucer and Shakespeare, had inherited the professorship in English literature previously held by Francis James Child, whose courses he continued to teach and whose great, unfinished eight-volume edition of the Popular Ballads of England and Scotland he brought to completion.It was Kittredge who pioneered modern methods of ballad study, and who encouraged collectors to get out of their armchairs and library halls and to get out into the countryside to collect ballads first hand. When he met John Lomax in 1907, this was what he encouraged him to do; the cowboy songs Lomax had been writing down were glimpses into <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>new</b> <b>world,</b> and Lomax should follow up on his work. [...] "Go and get this material while it can be found," [...] he told the young Texan. [...] "Preserve the words and music. That's your job." [...] Wendell and Kittredge continued to play an important advisory role in Lomax's career after he returned to Texas in June 1907 to resume his teaching position at A after completing his Master of Arts degree. This included a visit by the two professors to Texas during which Lomax took them to a Sunday service in an African-American church.|$|E
6000|$|The {{inventor}} of movable types, says the venerable Teufelsdröckh, was disbanding hired armies, cashiering most kings and senates, and creating <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>new</b> democratic <b>world.</b> Has any one yet said what great things are {{being done by}} the men {{who are trying to}} banish ugliness from our streets and our homes, and to make both the outside and inside of our dwellings worthy of a world where there are forests and flower-tressed meadows, and the plumage of birds; where the insects carry lessons of color on their wings, and even the surface of a stagnant pool will show us the wonders of iridescence and the most delicate forms of leafage? They, too, are modifying opinions, for they are modifying men’s moods and habits, which are the mothers of opinions, having quite {{as much to do with}} their formation as the responsible father—Reason. Think of certain hideous manufacturing towns where the piety is chiefly a belief in copious perdition, and the pleasure is chiefly gin. The dingy surface of wall pierced by the ugliest windows, the staring shop-fronts, paper-hangings, carpets, brass and gilt mouldings, and advertising placards, have an effect akin to that of malaria; it is easy to understand that with such surroundings there is more belief in cruelty than in beneficence, and that the best earthly bliss attainable is the dulling of the external senses. For it is a fatal mistake to suppose that ugliness which is taken for beauty will answer all the purposes of beauty; the subtle relation between all kinds of truth and fitness in our life forbids that bad taste should ever be harmless to our moral sensibility or our intellectual discernment; and—more than that—as it is probable that fine musical harmonies have a sanative influence over our bodily organization, it is also probable that just coloring and lovely combinations of lines may be necessary to the complete well-being of our systems apart from any conscious delight in them. A savage may indulge in discordant chuckles and shrieks and gutturals, and think that they please the gods, but it does not follow that his frame would not be favorably wrought upon by the vibrations of a grand church organ. One sees a person capable of choosing the worst style of wall-paper become suddenly afflicted by its ugliness under an attack of illness. And if an evil state of blood and lymph usually goes along with an evil state of mind, who shall say that the ugliness of our streets, the falsity of our ornamentation, the vulgarity of our upholstery, have not something to do with those bad tempers which breed false conclusions? ...|$|R
