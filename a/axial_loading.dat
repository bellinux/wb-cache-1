Four two-thirds-scale interior joints, including two control specimens and two specimens strengthened by ferrocement jackets with embedded diagonal reinforcements, are tested. The specimens are subjected to two levels of <b>axial</b> <b>load</b> representing low and high <b>axial</b> <b>load</b> ratios at 0. 2 and 0. 6, respectively.

40|$|Arch microbeams {{have been}} {{utilized}} and proposed for many uses {{over the past}} few years due to their large tunability and bistability. However, recent experimental data have shown different mechanical behavior of arches when subjected to <b>axial</b> <b>loads.</b> This paper aims to investigate in depth the influence of the competing effects of initial rise and <b>axial</b> <b>loads</b> on the mechanical behavior of micromachined arches; mainly their static deflection and resonant frequencies. Based on analytical solutions, the static response and eigenvalue problems are analyzed for various values of initial rises and <b>axial</b> <b>loads.</b> Universal curves showing the variation of the first three resonance frequencies of the arch are generated for various values of initial rise under both tensile and compressive <b>axial</b> <b>loads.</b> This study shows that increasing the tensile or compressive <b>axial</b> <b>loads</b> for different values of initial rise may lead to either increase in the stiffness of the beam or initial decrease in the stiffness, which later increases as the <b>axial</b> <b>load</b> is increased depending on the dominant effect of the initial rise of the arch and the <b>axial</b> <b>load.</b> The obtained universal curves represent useful design tools to predict the tunability of arches under <b>axial</b> <b>loads</b> for various values of initial rises.

40|$|The {{motivation}} {{for this research}} was to apply methods of vibrations testing {{in order to determine}} <b>axial</b> <b>loads</b> in the pin-ended truss members of the Breeding Bam. This method of vibrations testing was necessary {{in order to determine the}} in-situ <b>axial</b> <b>loads</b> of the truss members in the bam. Other common methods, such as strain gauges, were not useful for this application. This is because strain gauges can only detect changes in strain and therefore only changes in load. However due to the size and weight of the roof at the Breeding Bam, significant <b>axial</b> <b>loads</b> are produced in the truss members. This in-situ <b>axial</b> <b>load</b> due to the dead load of the roof is a significant portion of any additional loading and cannot be ignored.

50|$|Another way of fitting more balls into a radial {{ball bearing}} is by {{radially}} 'fracturing' (slicing) one of the rings all the way through, loading the balls in, re-assembling the fractured portion, and then using a pair of steel bands to hold the fractured ring sections together in alignment.

40|$|In {{the design}} of {{reinforced}} concrete beams, the effects of small <b>axial</b> <b>loads</b> (<b>axial</b> <b>load</b> < 10 % of axial capacity of concrete section) are often ignored or at most only nominally allowed for.

In this study, the effects of small <b>axial</b> <b>loads</b> on the flexural strength and ductility of normal- and high-strength concrete beams have been investigated by complete moment–curvature analysis of beam sections cast of different grades of concrete and subjected to different levels of <b>axial</b> <b>load.</b> The results revealed that the application of a small <b>axial</b> <b>load</b> has the beneficial effect of increasing the flexural strength but also the adverse effect of decreasing the flexural ductility.

30|$|The {{previous}} research indicates conflicting {{views on the}} use of high-strength steel as confinement reinforcement. However, by referring to Mugurumu (1991) and Azizinamini et al.

When the level of <b>axial</b> <b>load</b> is relatively low (less than or equal to 20 % of <b>axial</b> <b>load</b> capacity), the use of higher yield strength steel for transverse reinforcement may not result in any improvement in the strength and ductility of HSC columns.|$|R

50|$|A {{linear element}} of a {{structure}} {{is one that is}} essentially one dimensional and is often subject to <b>axial</b> <b>loading</b> only. When a structural element is subjected to tension or compression its length will tend to elongate or shorten, and its cross-sectional area changes by an amount that depends on the Poisson's ratio of the material. In engineering applications, structural members experience small deformations and the reduction in cross-sectional area is very small and can be neglected, i.e., the cross-sectional area is assumed constant during deformation. For this case, the stress is called engineering stress or nominal stress and is calculated using the original cross section.|$|E

40|$|Ultimate load {{capacity}} of slender concrete-filled steel composite columns is investigated in this paper. Nonlinear analyses are {{done by the}} use of finite element software, LUSAS, to study the ultimate <b>axial</b> <b>load</b> behaviour of the columns. Verification of the finite element modelling is done by comparing the result with the corresponding experimental result reported by other researchers. Analyses are carried out to assess different shapes and number of cold-formed steel sheeting stiffeners with various thicknesses of cold-formed steel sheets and their effects on the behaviour and ultimate <b>axial</b> <b>load</b> capacity of the columns.
