In some conceptions, a transmission grid of HVDC transmission lines forms a layer that is distinctly separate {{in the way that}} a superhighway system is separate from the system of city streets and regional highways. In more conventional conceptions such as the proposed unification of the synchronous European grid UCTE and the IPS/UPS system of the CIS, such a mega grid is no different from typical wide area synchronous transmission systems where electricity takes an ad-hoc transit route directly through local utility transmission lines or HVDC lines as required.Studies for such continental sized systems report there are scaling problems as a result of network complexity, transmission congestion, and the need for rapid diagnostic, coordination and control systems. Such studies observe that transmission capacity would need to be significantly higher than current transmission systems in order to promote unimpeded energy trading across distances unbounded by state, regional or national, or even continental borders.As a practical matter, it has become necessary to incorporate smart grid features such as wide <b>area</b> <b>sensor</b> networks (WAMS) into even modest sized regional grids in order to avert major power outages such as the Northeast Blackout of 2003. Dynamic interactions between power generation groups are increasingly complex, and transient disturbances that cascade across neighboring utilities can be sudden, large and violent, accompanied by abrupt changes in the network topology as operators attempt to manually stabilize the network.|$|E

A pixel-to-pixel calibration scheme is introduced to obtain standoff and baseline {{distance of the}} developed <b>area</b> <b>sensor.</b> In the three-dimensional (3 D) space, the <b>area</b> <b>sensor</b> also has an offset angle in a plane parallel to the reference plane. Calibration of this offset angle improves the measurement accuracy. This pixel-to-pixel scheme is particularly useful for calibrating a 3 D optical <b>area</b> <b>sensor</b> with off-the-shelf lenses. An exploding vector method was also developed to transform the measured depth map to a 3 D point cloud. A robotic area sensing system was developed by integrating an <b>area</b> <b>sensor</b> prototype and a robot sensor planning system. Calibration of the integrated system includes robot calibration, part calibration, and robot hand-eye calibration. Calibration error of the robot system {{is related to the}} <b>area</b> <b>sensor</b> positioning accuracy in the robotic system. Experimental results show a successful practice of the developed robotic area sensing system. Measurement performance of the developed system can be improved if advanced lenses are adopted. © 2005 IEEE. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

To explore the system level issues with a wearable node, we show measurements from a wearable electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor prototype. Using heart rate monitoring as an example, we show how ultra low power (ULP) circuit design must be applied to support the stringent energy and/or power demands of long-life wearable sensors. Specifically, sub-threshold operation of digital circuits creates opportunities for re-thinking the entire system. We conclude that we can only reach the lower limits of power consumption through cross-hierarchy design of the entire sensor node that leverages ULP digital circuits. I...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{developed}} a real-time multi-channel Fourier transform spectrometer with an <b>area</b> <b>sensor</b> to track biological sample motion. In order {{to decrease the}} time intervals between measurements, a simultaneous measurement system consisting of two interferograms with opposite phases was constructed by using an <b>area</b> <b>sensor</b> instead of the often-used linear sensor. Since this system requires no mechanical motion for measurement, {{the rate at which}} it outputs spectra depends only upon the frame rate of the <b>area</b> <b>sensor.</b> This spectrometer was employed in the near-infrared region at wavelengths of 900 – 1700 nm to realize non-invasive blood testing. Substances in blood can be measured at 20 Hz using this method, which is higher than the pulse rate of a human blood vessel. This high-frequency technique enables the extraction of only the blood spectra from samples obtained from fingertips. In this study, the concentration of neutral fat within the blood was determined by extracting the periodically changing signal from the 1200 nm peak...|$|E
50|$|Image {{sensor noise}} can be {{compared}} across formats for a given fixed photon flux per pixel area (the P in the formulas); this analysis is useful for a fixed number of pixels with pixel <b>area</b> proportional to <b>sensor</b> <b>area,</b> and fixed absolute aperture diameter for a fixed imaging situation in terms of depth of field, diffraction limit at the subject, etc. Or it {{can be compared}} for a fixed focal-plane illuminance, corresponding to a fixed f-number, in which case P is proportional to pixel <b>area,</b> independent of <b>sensor</b> <b>area.</b> The formulas above and below can be evaluated for either case.|$|R
50|$|Considering {{the signal}} to noise ratio due to read noise at a given exposure, the signal will scale as the <b>sensor</b> <b>area</b> along with the read noise and {{therefore}} read noise SNR will be unaffected by <b>sensor</b> <b>area.</b> In a depth of field constrained situation, the exposure of the larger sensor will be reduced in proportion to the <b>sensor</b> <b>area,</b> and therefore the read noise SNR will reduce likewise.|$|R
50|$|The size of {{the image}} sensor, or {{effective}} light collection <b>area</b> per pixel <b>sensor,</b> is the largest determinant of signal levels that determine signal-to-noise ratio and hence apparent noise levels, assuming the aperture area is proportional to <b>sensor</b> <b>area,</b> or that the f-number or focal-plane illuminance is held constant. That is, for a constant f-number, the sensitivity of an imager scales roughly with the <b>sensor</b> <b>area,</b> so larger <b>sensors</b> typically create lower noise images than smaller sensors. In the case of images bright enough {{to be in the}} shot noise limited regime, when the image is scaled to the same size on screen, or printed at the same size, the pixel count makes little difference to perceptible noise levels - the noise depends primarily on <b>sensor</b> <b>area,</b> not how this area is divided into pixels. For images at lower signal levels (higher ISO settings), where read noise (noise floor) is significant, more pixels within a given <b>sensor</b> <b>area</b> will make the image noisier if the per pixel read noise is the same.|$|R

40|$|Point cloud {{registration}} and sensor calibration are two critical technical issues concerning robot-mounted, <b>area</b> <b>sensor</b> systems. Iterative Closest Point (ICP) -based algorithms {{developed in the}} past are commonly used for point cloud registration. However, due to its least squared fitting nature, registration quality depends on how closely the measured part matches its nominal definition, typical {{in the form of}} a CAD model in modern times. To eliminate the dependency of registration quality on part closeness to the CAD model, we present, in this paper, a more robust approach based in a series of coordinate transformations. Geometric features and surface gradients are accounted for to improve the registration performance. To achieve robot/sensor hand-eye calibration, an ICP-based method is used. The reason is that this calibration step typically utilizes standard parts or gauges machined for the purpose of calibration, as such they are known shapes that match their CAD models with much tighter tolerances. This offers us an unique opportunity to apply an ICP-based tool to find the transformation matrix from the robot end effector to an <b>area</b> <b>sensor</b> mounted onto it. The discussed method was successfully implemented and tested in a feedback-based, robot-mounted <b>area</b> <b>sensor</b> system developed for manufacturing quality control of 3 D freeform surfaces. © 2006 IEEE.
