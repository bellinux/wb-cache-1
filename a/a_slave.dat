5|$|Technically, <b>a</b> <b>slave</b> {{could not}} own property, but <b>a</b> <b>slave</b> who {{conducted}} business might be {{given access to}} an individual account or fund (peculium) that he could use {{as if it were}} his own. The terms of this account varied depending on the degree of trust and co-operation between owner and slave: <b>a</b> <b>slave</b> with an aptitude for business could be given considerable leeway to generate profit, and might be allowed to bequeath the peculium he managed to other slaves of his household. Within a household or workplace, a hierarchy of slaves might exist, with one slave in effect acting as the master of other slaves.|$|E

She was a devout Christian and experienced strange visions and vivid dreams, which she ascribed to premonitions from God.|$|E
5|$|Buchanan rarely {{consulted}} Breckinridge {{when making}} patronage appointments, and meetings {{between the two}} were infrequent. When Breckinridge and Buchanan endorsed the Lecompton Constitution, which would have admitted Kansas as <b>a</b> <b>slave</b> state instead of allowing the people to vote, they managed to alienate most Northern Democrats, including Douglas. This disagreement ended plans for Breckinridge, Douglas, and Minnesota's Henry Mower Rice to build {{a series of three}} elaborate, conjoined row houses in which to live during their time in Washington, D.C. In November 1857, after Breckinridge found alternative lodging in Washington, he sold <b>a</b> <b>slave</b> woman and her young infant which, according to historian James C. Klotter, probably ended his days as a slaveholder. When Breckinridge did not travel to Illinois to campaign for Douglas's re-election to the Senate and gave him only a lukewarm endorsement, relations between them worsened.|$|E
