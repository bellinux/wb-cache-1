25|$|In Leon Festinger's {{cognitive}} dissonance experiment, {{participants were asked}} to perform <b>a</b> <b>boring</b> task. They were divided into 2 groups and given two different pay scales. At the study's end, some participants were paid $1 to say that they enjoyed the task and another group of participants was paid $20 to say the same lie. The first group ($1) later reported liking the task better than the second group ($20). Festinger's explanation was that for people in the first group being paid only $1 is not sufficient incentive for lying and those who were paid $1 experienced dissonance. They could only overcome that dissonance by justifying their lies by changing their previously unfavorable attitudes about the task. Being paid $20 provides a reason for the doing the boring task, therefore no dissonance.|$|E

He became so good at boxing that he envisioned a future as a bouncer in a nightclub, thus avoiding a career in <b>a</b> <b>boring</b> factory job. Iommi initially wanted to play the drums, but due to the excessive noise he chose the guitar instead as a teenager, after being inspired by the likes of Hank Marvin and The Shadows. He has always played guitar left-handed. After completing school, Iommi worked briefly as a plumber and later in a factory manufacturing rings. He states that at one point he worked in a music store but quit after being falsely accused of stealing.|$|E
50|$|The engine {{initially}} displaced 379 cuin L, {{though the}} potential for larger displacements was engineered into the design. It had SOHCs actuating the valves via roller-tipped rockers mounted on rockershafts flanking the centrally located camshaft. Just like the FE Cammer, this allows splayed valves. It has <b>a</b> <b>bore</b> spacing of 4.53 inches, a stroke of 3.74 inches, <b>a</b> <b>bore</b> of 4.015 inches, and a deep-skirted thinwall casting block with cross-bolted mains. The 1950s-designed 390 FE had <b>a</b> <b>bore</b> spacing of 4.63 inches, a stroke of 3.78 inches, <b>a</b> <b>bore</b> of 4.05 inches, and a deep-skirted thinwall casting block. The SOHC version of the FE with cross-bolted maincaps, developed in 1965, had single overhead cams actuating the valves via roller-tipped rockers. A 427 cuin L version of the new Boss engine was put together and tested. It produced 700 hp.|$|R

25|$|The {{anticonvulsant}} {{properties of}} potassium bromide were first noted by Sir Charles Locock {{at a meeting}} of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society in 1857. Bromide can be regarded as the first effective medication for epilepsy. At the time, it was commonly thought that epilepsy was caused by masturbation. Locock noted that bromide calmed sexual excitement and thought this was responsible for his success in treating seizures. In the latter half of the 19th century, potassium bromide was used for the calming of seizure and nervous disorders on an enormous scale, with the use by single hospitals being as much as several tons a year (the dose for a given person being a few grams per day). By the beginning of the 20th century the generic word had become so widely associated with being sedate that bromide came to mean a dull, sedate person or <b>a</b> <b>boring</b> platitude uttered by such a person.|$|E

500|$|Less {{positive}} was Peter Bradshaw, {{film critic}} for The Guardian, {{who gave the}} film two out of five stars.

According to the Dallas Observer, [...] "Brad Pitt... is {{a large part of the}} problem [...] When directors play up his cocky, hunkish, folksy side... he's a joy to watch.

[...] Duke Ferris of Game Revolution said, [...] "It's not that Dark Angel is brutally awful or full of bugs ... it's that it lacks any originality whatsoever.
