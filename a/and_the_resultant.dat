5|$|Floyd's {{rainfall}} {{resulted in}} deadly and extensive flooding that killed {{two people in}} New York. Heavy flooding was reported along numerous creeks, including the Esopus, Catskill, and Schoharie. In the Albany area, the Normanskill rose to extremely high levels, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>resultant</b> flood waters damaged nearby buildings. The Coeymans Creek in Selkirk overflowed and forced 20 families to leave their homes. The main rivers typically remained within their banks. Many roads, including U.S. Route 20 in Guilderland, were flooded or washed out, and seven families had to be evacuated along NY 32 in Menands. Further south, the Saw Mill and Bronx rivers both overflowed, and caused urban flooding. A dam on a mill pond broke near Lake Placid, leading to flooding along the Chubb River.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Beth was a {{short-lived}} tropical cyclone which traveled from Florida to Nova Scotia {{in the middle}} of August 1971. The second named storm of the 1971 Atlantic hurricane season, Beth's genesis was impeded by a cold environment surrounding the storm. However, as it continued on its northeastward course, it achieved fully tropical characteristics and peaked as a modest Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. The cyclone struck Nova Scotia on August 16 before dissipating shortly after. Beth produced substantial precipitation, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>resultant</b> flooding inflicted severe damage to infrastructure and crops.|$|E
5|$|Marx {{continued}} to write articles for the New York Daily Tribune {{as long as}} he was sure that the Tribune's editorial policy was still progressive. However, the departure of Charles Dana from the paper in late 1861 <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>resultant</b> change in the editorial board brought about a new editorial policy. No longer was the Tribune to be a strong abolitionist paper dedicated to a complete Union victory. The new editorial board supported an immediate peace between the Union and the Confederacy in the Civil War in the United States with slavery left intact in the Confederacy. Marx strongly disagreed with this new political position and in 1863 was forced to withdraw as a writer for the Tribune.|$|E
5|$|On 7 October 1964, Vulcan B.2 XM601 crashed during {{overshoot}} from an asymmetric power practice approach at Coningsby.

The federal health exchange, HealthCare.gov, initially faced major technical problems during its rollout in 2013. In 2017, a unified Republican government failed to pass several different partial repeals of the ACA. The law spent several years opposed by a slim plurality of Americans polled, although its provisions were generally more popular than the law as a whole, and the law gained plurality support by 2017.|$|E
5|$|The first variant was {{designed}} during the 1980s as an upgrade of the Su-27, and was initially {{known as the}} Su-27M. This derivative incorporated canards and a multi-function radar that transformed the aircraft into a multi-role aircraft, and was structurally reinforced to support its heavier weight. The first prototype made its maiden flight in June 1988. As the aircraft was not mass produced due {{to the collapse of}} the Soviet Union, Sukhoi re-designated the aircraft as Su-35 to attract export orders. At the same time, the fourteen aircraft produced were used for tests and demonstrations; one example had thrust-vectoring engines installed, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>resultant</b> Su-37 was used as a technology demonstrator. A sole Su-35UB two-seat trainer was also built in the late 1990s that strongly resembled the Su-30MK family.|$|E
5|$|The lantern as {{a source}} of {{illumination}} in art was widely used by Baroque artists, and perfected by Caravaggio.

Illumination by torch or candlelight took on religious connotations; but in The Third of May the lantern manifests no such miracle. Rather, it affords light only so that the firing squad may complete its grim work, and provides a stark illumination so that the viewer may bear witness to wanton violence. The traditional role of light in art as a conduit for the spiritual has been subverted.|$|E

5|$|A {{benzodiazepine}} dependence {{occurs in}} {{about one-third of}} individuals who are treated with benzodiazepines for longer than 4 weeks, which typically results in tolerance and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome when the dose is reduced too rapidly. Midazolam infusions may induce tolerance and a withdrawal syndrome {{in a matter of}} days. The risk factors for dependence include dependent personality, use of a benzodiazepine that is short-acting, high potency and long-term use of benzodiazepines. Withdrawal symptoms from midazolam can range from insomnia and anxiety to seizures and psychosis. Withdrawal symptoms can sometimes resemble a person’s underlying condition. Gradual reduction of midazolam after regular use can minimise withdrawal and rebound effects. Tolerance <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>resultant</b> withdrawal syndrome may be due to receptor down-regulation and GABAA receptor alterations in gene expression, which causes long-term changes in the function of the GABAergic neuronal system.|$|E
5|$|Erromintxela {{is a mixed}} {{language}} (referred to as Para-Romani in Romani linguistics), deriving most of its vocabulary from Kalderash Romani {{but using}} Basque grammar, {{similar to the way}} the Angloromani language of the Roma in England mixes Romani vocabulary and English grammar. The development of the mixed language was facilitated by the unusually-deep integration of the Erromintxela people into Basque society <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>resultant</b> bilingualism in Basque. The language is in decline; most of the perhaps 1000 remaining speakers live on the coast of Labourd and in the mountainous regions of Soule, Navarre, Gipuzkoa and Biscay. The Erromintxela are the descendants of a 15th-century wave of Kalderash Roma, who entered the Basque Country via France. Both ethnically and linguistically, they are distinct from the Caló-speaking Romani people in Spain and the Cascarot Romani people of the Northern Basque Country.|$|E

5|$|Jordan {{signed a}} {{military}} pact with Egypt just before Israel launched {{a preemptive strike}} on Egypt to begin the Six-Day War in June 1967, where Jordan and Syria joined the war. The Arab states were defeated and Jordan {{lost control of the}} West Bank to Israel. The War of Attrition with Israel followed, which included the 1968 Battle of Karameh where the combined forces of the Jordanian Armed Forces and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) repelled an Israeli attack on the Karameh camp on the Jordanian border with the West Bank. Despite the fact that the Palestinians had limited involvement against the Israeli forces, the events at Karameh gained wide recognition and acclaim in the Arab world. As a result, the time period following the battle witnessed an upsurge of support for Palestinian paramilitary elements (the fedayeen) within Jordan from other Arab countries. The fedayeen activities soon became a threat to Jordan's rule of law. In September 1970, the Jordanian army targeted the fedayeen <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>resultant</b> fighting led to the expulsion of Palestinian fighters from various PLO groups into Lebanon, in a civil war that became known as Black September.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} opponent to birth control was the Catholic Church, which mobilized opposition in many venues during the 1920s. Catholics persuaded the Syracuse city council to ban Sanger from {{giving a speech}} in 1924; the National Catholic Welfare Conference lobbied against birth control; the Knights of Columbus boycotted hotels that hosted birth control events; the Catholic police commissioner of Albany prevented Sanger from speaking there; the Catholic mayor of Boston, James Curley, blocked Sanger from speaking in public; and several newsreel companies, succumbing to pressure from Catholics, refused to cover stories related to birth control.Chesler, p. 220 (newsreels). The ABCL turned some of the boycotted speaking events to their advantage by inviting the press, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>resultant</b> news coverage often generated public sympathy for their cause. However, Catholic lobbying was particularly effective in the legislative arena, where their arguments– that contraception was unnatural, harmful, and indecent– impeded several initiatives, including an attempt in 1924 by Mary Dennett to overturn federal anti-contraception laws.For a detailed discussion of religious objection to birth control, see: Tobin, Kathleen (2001), The American Religious Debate Over Birth Control, 1907–1937, McFarland.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Tropical Storm Carrie are {{traced back to}} a {{tropical}} wave—an elongated area of low atmospheric air pressure—that emerged from the western coast of Africa on August 15, 1972. A relatively strong weather system, the wave progressed westward, {{but by the time}} it had reached the Leeward Islands ten days later, it had degenerated substantially. The influence of a nearby upper-level low pressure system caused the disturbance to further deteriorate, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>resultant</b> remnant circulation drifted toward the northwest; by August 28, it was situated at a position just offshore southeastern Florida. The low pressure system maintained a cold core and had not yet established itself at the surface. On August 29, the low began moving northward in response to an approaching trough. For the first time, a low-level circulation center had been identified in association with the system, and the storm became a tropical depression at 1200 UTC while located east of the central Florida peninsula. The depression tracked steadily northeastward as it gradually intensified.|$|E

She goes to Mulder’s apartment (where Fletcher is having a tryst with Kersh's assistant) and tells Fletcher that they traced the telephone call to a pay phone near Area 51 and she suspects it is Mulder's informant. Fletcher is indifferent to this news and Scully yells at him, sensing that his behavior is very strange and his lack of concern for the X-Files is completely out of character. Scully decides to investigate, and drives through the desert towards Area 51. She stops at a burned out gas station and finds a penny and a dime merged. Later, when Scully arrives at Fletcher's house, Mulder tries desperately to convince Scully that he is really Mulder. Scully remains skeptical and thinks that any information Mulder describes could be obtained in other ways. Mulder tells Scully that he will bring proof of the defect of the UFO <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>resultant</b> problems that night, but Fletcher, having eavesdropped on the conversation, calls his old office posing as Mulder to inform them of the source of the leak—Mulder posing as Fletcher.
