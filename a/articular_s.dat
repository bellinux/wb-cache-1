40|$|CASE REPORT We {{present a}} case of a 57 year old female whose patella became locked above a femoral osteophyte. She {{attended}} A & E at the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast. She had been pushing a chair forward under a table with her left knee when she felt a 'pop ' inside it followed by severe pain. She was unable to bend or weightbear on the knee. Her left knee was previously asymptomatic with no recent trauma. She had a right knee arthroscopy and trimming of medial meniscus three years ago. On examination the left knee was locked in full extension. There was a moderate sized effusion and the left patella was positioned higher than its counterpart. There was a prominent vertical sulcus immediately below the inferior pole of the left patella extending towards the tibial tuberosity. On palpation there was pain around the inferior pole of patella and overlying the patellar tendon. She could not actively straight leg raise. Active and passive knee flexion caused severe pain. Examination of collateral and cruciate ligaments was not possible due to inability to flex the knee. The knee lacked the typical boggy swelling of a true patellar tendon rupture but this was the clinical diagnosis. Radiographic investigation demonstrated a highriding patella on A-P view. The lateral view showed an osteophyte on the inferior margin of the patellar articular surface locked over an osteophyte on the superior aspect of the femoral articular surface (Fig. 1). The patella could no longer track freely downwards, explaining the patient's symptoms. Reduction was easily achieved under intravenous analgesia. The limb was flexed at the hip by supporting the heel causing a relative hyperextension at the knee.

Ambos os autores debru?aram-se, em seus textos, sobre os mitos que narram os tr?gicos acontecimentos ocorridos no pal?cio de Agam?mnon: o assassinato de Clitemnestra por seus filhos, Orestes e Electra. Este trabalho tem como objetivo analisar e cotejar entre si as pe?as de Giraudoux e Sartre no intuito de nelas levantar os elementos que apontam para as rela??es tanto entre mito (pensamento m?tico) e logos (raz?o te?rica) quanto entre mito e trag?dia moderna, e, ainda, evidenciar o fato de que o texto de Sartre, al?m de dialogar com o legado grego, constr?i-se em contraponto filos?fico ao drama de Giraudoux. Para alcan?ar nossos objetivos, partimos de uma reflex?o sobre o fen?meno do mito sob as perspectivas da filosofia da linguagem, do sagrado, da antropologia e da literatura, formando um conjunto te?rico que buscamos <b>articular</b> ?<b>s</b> teorias do drama de Arist?teles e Hegel. The French dramatists Jean Giradoux and Jean-Paul Sartre {{revisited}} {{the tragic}} Greek legacy {{and wrote the}} plays ?lectre (1937) and Les mouches (1943), respectively. Both authors, in their texts, drew from myths concerned with the tragic actions {{that took place in}} Agamemnon s palace: the murder of Clytemnestra by her children, Orestes and Electra. This research is centered on the analysis and comparison between Giraudoux s and Sartre s plays aiming at identifying in them the elements that indicate both the relations between myth (mythical thought) and logos (theoretical reason) and that between myth and modern tragedy. It also shows the fact that Sartre s text, maintains a dialog with the Greek legacy, and also offers a philosophical counterpoint to Giraudoux s play. In order to reach our goals we have examined the phenomenon of myth under the light of the philosophy of language, of the sacred, of anthropology and of literature, a theoretical basis that we tried to connect with the theories of Aristotle and Hegel about drama...|$|E
40|$|It {{is common}} to find both {{articular}} and diges-tive manifestations accompanying certain disorders of connective tissue. Impressed by the frequency of those manifestations we decided to study a group of 55 patients suffering from systemic lupus erythema-tosus, scleroderma, dermatomyositis, and poly-arteritis nodosa. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (S. L. E.). -This is a systemic disease of connective tissue running an irregular and generally severe course. 91 per cent. of cases described by Shearn and Pirofsky (1952) were females, and a similar incidence (90 5 per cent.) {{was found in the}} present group.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Lumbar zypapophyseal joints are {{innervated by}} the medial {{branch of the}} {{posterior}} lumbar ramus. The aim of this work was to describe the precise course of the medial ramus on axial CT scans and to define a precise location for its selective infiltration. METHODS: Lumbar spines of two cadavers were first dissected to assess {{the route of the}} L 1 –L 5 posterior ramus. Thirty lumbar spinal nerves of three cadavers were injected in the epineural space with a mixture of iodine contrast and stain to perform a correlation between anatomic gross sections and CT sections in the axial plane. A histologic study was also performed to ensure the neurologic nature of the structure identified. RESULTS: The fibroosseous canal located between the mamillary and the accessory pro-cesses was a constant pathway for the medial branch of the L 1 –L 4 posterior ramus. This former was always located closer to the accessory process. The L 5 posterior ramus and its divisions could also be identified into a groove bounded laterally by the ala of the sacrum and medially by the base of the superior <b>articular</b> process of <b>S</b> 1. CONCLUSION: The accessory process and the groove bounded laterally by the ala of th...|$|R
40|$|Advisors: Chris Hubbard; Karen Samonds. Committee members: Daniel Gebo; Richard King; Virginia Naples. Adaptations {{for hunting}} and {{locomotor}} functions of animals {{are related to}} the limb functional characteristics of limb muscles, muscle attachment sites on bones, and joint articular surface shapes. This dissertation includes study of extant Felis catus, Neofelis nebulosa, Panthera leo, and Acinonyx jubatus and extinct Smilodon fatalis, Panthera atrox, and Canis dirus. The extant species exhibit different locomotor modes. The functional characteristics of extinct species are predicted based on limb bone morphology. N. nebulosa, F. catus, and V. vulpes forelimb musculature was described, muscle maps were generated, and muscle fiber analysis was completed. Muscle attachment sizes were also compared in these species to explore the relationship between the size of a muscle and its attachment area. In addition to the bones of these three species, limb bones of extant Acinonyx jubatus, Panthera leo, Vulpes vulpes and extinct Smilodon fatalis, Panthera atrox, and Canis dirus were analyzed using geometric morphometric techniques to examine muscle attachment sites and joint articular surfaces. This was performed to infer the degree of muscle mechanical advantage and joint mobility in the extinct species and to suggest functional capabilities and behavior, such as different hunting and locomotion modes. When compared to felids, V. vulpes has larger muscles crossing the shoulder joint. Consequently, felids displayed larger ratios for muscles used for scapular and antebrachium rotation. In the geometric morphometric analysis of the forelimb, the cursorial carnivores differed from non-cursorial felids in glenoid fossa shape, humeral greater and lesser tubercles and radial tuberosity positioning, and distal radioulnar joint articular facet shape. P. atrox often clustered with P. leo. S. fatalis showed large attachment sites for scapular retraction muscles. Glenoid and distal radioulnar articular facet shapes in S. fatalis suggest increased shoulder joint and anteroposterior humerus rotation ability. In addition, shapes of elbow joint articulation and distal radioulnar <b>articular</b> facets in <b>S.</b> fatalis point to increased antebrachium rotation ability. These characters together may have aided S. fatalis during grappling with large prey. However, S. fatalis clustered with canids in the analyses of the scapula and ilium, suggesting the need for high endurance muscles needed during prey wrestling. Ph. D. (Doctor of Philosophy...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{and compare}} the expression of cathepsins K and S proteins in joints with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) and {{to determine the effect}} of interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) on the expression of cathepsin K in fibroblast-like synoviocytes. METHOD: Expression and localization of cathepsins K and S were determined by immunohistochemistry in the synovium of 10 RA- and 8 OA-affected joints. Northern and Western blot analyses were performed to analyze cathepsin K and S expression in primary fibroblast-like synoviocyte cultures from RA and OA patients. The effect of IL- 1 beta and TNF alpha on the expression and secretion of cathepsin K in primary cultures of synoviocytes was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. Staining of in situ activity was used to identify active cathepsin K enzyme in primary synovial fibroblast cultures. RESULTS: Cathepsin K and S protein expression was identified in the synovium from patients with RA and OA. Cathepsin K protein was localized in synovial fibroblasts, stromal multinucleated giant cells, and, to a lesser degree, in CD 68 + macrophage-like synoviocytes. Of note is the expression of cathepsin K in synovial fibroblasts and mononuclear macrophage-like cells at sites of cartilage erosion in RA and in interdigitating cells of lymphocyte-rich areas. In contrast, cathepsin S expression was restricted to CD 68 + macrophage-like synoviocytes, interdigitating cells, and endothelial cells of blood vessels. Cathepsin K protein expression in the interstitial areas and perivascular regions of RA-derived synovial specimens was 2 - 5 times higher than in OA samples (P 3 ̆c 0. 001), whereas the expression of cathepsin S did not significantly differ in these diseases. Cathepsin K expression levels in normal synovium were low and restricted to fibroblast-like cells. Of note, cathepsin K also was expressed in repairing fibrocartilage in 1 OA specimen. Primary cell cultures of RA- and OA-derived synovial fibroblasts expressed comparable amounts of cathepsin K at the transcript and protein levels. Both cell cultures secreted mature cathepsin K as well as procathepsin K, and expressed active cathepsin K in cytosolic vesicles. In contrast, neither RA- nor OA-derived fibroblasts expressed detectable levels of cathepsin S. IL- 1 beta and TNF alpha stimulated the transcript (7 - 8 -fold) and protein expression (2 -fold) of cathepsin K (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) in primary synovial fibroblast cultures, without differences in expression between RA- and OA-derived synovial fibroblasts. CONCLUSION: The presence of cathepsin K polypeptide in synovial fibroblasts and macrophage-like cells in normal, OA, and RA synovia suggests a constitutive expression of this protease and a role in synovial remodeling. The comparable increase in cathepsin K expression after stimulation of RA- and OA-derived synovial fibroblasts with IL- 1 beta and TNF alpha further suggests that the expression of cathepsin K is independent of cellular alterations leading to the invasive phenotype of RA-synovial fibroblasts. However, the overexpression of cathepsin K in RA synovia due to {{an increase in the number}} of cathepsin K-expressing cells identifies this enzyme as a candidate protease for the pathologic degradation of <b>articular</b> cartilage. Cathepsin <b>S</b> expression in macrophage-like synoviocytes suggests dual activity in antigen presentation and matrix degradation in the inflamed synovia...|$|R
40|$|InteraÃÃes entre a resposta imune inata e adquirida participam na fisiopatologia de doenÃas auto-imunes. Embora infecÃÃes estejam associadas ao desenvolvimento de artrites crÃnicas, Ã possÃvel que exposiÃÃo a alguns germes, como helmintos e fungos, potencialmente influencie a prevalÃncia e/ou gravidade de doenÃas imunomediadas. Lectinas derivadas de plantas, por aÃÃo em receptores de resposta inata, podem modular inflamaÃÃo. NÃs investigamos o efeito dos extratos de Ascaris suum (AS) e de Coccidioides posadasii (CP) e de uma lectina isolada da Dioclea violacea (Dviol) na artrite induzida por zymosan (AZy). Ratos Wistar e camundongos Swiss receberam 1 mg ou 0, 1 mg de zymosan {{intra-articular}} (i. art.), respectivamente. Grupos foram prÃ-tratados (30 min) com os extratos de AS (0, 25 - 2, 5 mg/animal; i. p ou p. o.), CP (1 - 100 Âg/animal; i. art., i. p. ou p. o.) ou Dviol (0, 3 - 30 Âg i. art. ou 1 - 6 mg/Kg e. v.). Grupo nÃo-tratado (NT) recebeu Zy (i. art.) e veÃculo. Animais naive receberam apenas salina (i. art.) e veÃculo. A hipernocicepÃÃo foi avaliada atravÃs do teste de incapacitaÃÃo <b>articular</b> em <b>s</b> / 1 min. O lavado articular foi usado para anÃlise do influxo celular (IC), nÃveis de nitrito e citocinas. A sinÃvia foi utilizada para histopatologia. O conteÃdo de glicosaminoglicanos (GAG) da cartilagem foi quantificado para medir dano estrutural. O extrato de AS, seja i. p. ou p. o., inibiu de forma dose-dependente a hipernocicepÃÃo e o IC na AZy em relaÃÃo ao grupo NT (P< 0, 01), bem como reverteu o dano articular avaliado pela quantificaÃÃo de GAG e a sinovite vista Ã histologia. A administraÃÃo do extrato de AS, reduziu significantemente os nÃveis de nitrito, inteleucina- 1 &# 946; (IL- 1 &# 946;) e IL- 10, mas nÃo de fator de necrose tumoral alfa (TNF-&# 945;), em relaÃÃo ao NT. Em camundongos, o extrato de AS reduziu os nÃveis de IL- 10, mas nÃo de IL- 1 &# 946; ou TNF-&# 945;. O tratamento com o extrato de CP, seja i. p. ou p. o., inibiu significantemente a hipernocicepÃÃo e o IC na AZy, em relaÃÃo ao NT, no entanto, nÃo reverteu a lesÃo articular medida pela quantidade de GAG e histologia. A administraÃÃo da Dviol, em animais naive promoveu IC significante, embora apenas a maior dose (30 Âg) promoveu hipernocicepÃÃo. Na AZy, a injeÃÃo i. art. da Dviol reduziu o IC e hipernocicepÃÃo de forma dose-dependente, em relaÃÃo ao NT (P< 0, 01). A administraÃÃo da Dviol (i. v.) reduziu ambos hipernocicepÃÃo e IC na AZy, em relaÃÃo ao NT (P< 0, 01). O efeito da Dviol foi revertido quando essa lectina foi prÃ-incubada com manose 1 M. Os dados mostram que um extrato de AS promove melhora funcional e protege do dano estrutural na AZy, que sÃo associados com reduÃÃo na liberaÃÃo de NO e citocinas i. art. Esse efeito independe da espÃcie e ocorre por via oral. Um extrato do fungo CP tem aÃÃo anti-inflamatÃria na AZy. Uma lectina isolada da Dviol reduz IC e hipernocicepÃÃo na AZy, provavelmente por acoplamento a um receptor de manose. Em conjunto, os resultados mostram que substÃncias que agem em receptores de resposta inata modulam a inflamaÃÃo articular imunomediada. The {{interactions between}} innate and acquired immune responses {{participate in the}} pathophysiology of the autoimmune diseases. Though infections are associate {{with the development of}} the chronic arthritis it is possible that exposure to some germs as helminthes and fungi influences potentially the prevalence and/or gravity of the immune diseases. Lectins derivate of the plants can modulate the inflammation by action in receptors of the innate response. We investigated the effect of extracts from Ascaris suum (AS), Coccidioides posadasii (CS) and a lectin isolated from Dioclea violacea (Dviol) in zymosan-induced arthritis (ZyA). Wistar rats and Swiss mice received 1 mg or 0. 1 mg zymosan intra-articular (i. art.), respectively. Groups were pretreated (30 min) with AS (0. 25 - 2. 5 mg/animal; i. p. or p. o.) CP (1 - 100 Âg/animal; i. art. i. p. or p. o) or Dviol (0. 3 - 30 Âg; i. art. or 1 - 6 mg/kg; i. v.). Non-treated group (NT) received Zy (i. art.) and the vehicle. Naive animals received just saline (i. art.) and the vehicle. The hypernociception was evaluated through articular incapacitation test in s/ 1 min. The joint exudate was used for evaluation of cell influx (CI), nitrite and cytokine levels. The synovium was used for histopatology. The glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content of the cartilage was quantificated for the measured of the structural damage. The AS extract both i. p. and p. o. significantly and dose-dependently inhibited CI and hypernociception in ZyA as compared to NT (P< 0. 01) as well as reverted articular damage assessed by quantification of the GAG and by synovitis observed in the histology. The administration of the AS extract reduced significantly levels of nitrite, interleukin- 1 &# 946; (IL- 1 &# 946;) and IL- 10, but not tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&# 945;) as compared to NT. In mice, it reduced IL- 10 but not IL- 1 &# 946; and TNF- &# 945;. The treatment with CP extract both i. p. and p. o. inhibited hypernociception and CI in ZyA as compared to NT, but not reverted articular injury measured by GAG and histology. The administration of the Dviol in naÃve animals promoted CI significant, though just the highest dose (30 &# 61549;g) promoted hypernociception. In ZyA, Dviol (i. art.) reduced the CI and hypernociception dose-dependently (P< 0. 01). The administration of Dviol (i. v.) significantly reduced both the hyperalgesia and CI in ZyA as compared to NT (P< 0. 01). The effect of the Dviol was reverted when it was pre-incubated with mannose (1 M). The date show that AS extract promote functional improve and protect of the articular damage in ZyA that are associate with reduction of the NO and cytokine (i. art.) liberation. This effect is species independent and functions orally. An extract of the fungi CP has anti-inflammatory activity in ZyA. A lectin isolated of the Dviol reduces CI and hypernociception in ZyA probably by coupling the mannose receptor. Together the results show that substances that act in receptors of the innate response modulate the immunomediate articular inflammation...|$|R
