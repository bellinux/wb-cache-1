30|$|In [1] the {{asynchronous}} POWMAC protocol is proposed. This protocol uses {{a so-called}} <b>access</b> <b>window</b> phase, {{to agree on}} a set of transmissions that can simultaneously proceed. During the signaling for a transmission, each potential receiver announces the transmission power to be used by the communication partner as well as a common maximum interference level it can tolerate from a single newly starting transmission. Each transmitter that starts its own signaling afterwards must assure that it does not violate any of the interference tolerance levels included in preceding signals. After the <b>access</b> <b>window</b> phase multiple data transmissions can take place simultaneously.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{majority}} of the power consumption of a high-throughput LDPC decoder is spent on memory. Unlike in a gen-eral-purpose processor, the memory access in an LDPC decoder is deterministic and the <b>access</b> <b>window</b> is short. We {{take advantage of the}} unique memory access characteristic to design a non-refresh eDRAM that holds data for the necessary <b>access</b> <b>window,</b> and fur-ther improve its access time by trading off the excess retention time. The resulting 3 T eDRAM cell is designed to balance wordline cou-pling to reliably retain data for a fast access. We integrate 32 5 x 210 non-refresh eDRAM arrays in a row-parallel LDPC decoder suit-able for the IEEE 802. 11 ad standard. Memory refresh is eliminated and random access is replaced with a simple sequential addressing. With row merging and dual-frame processing, the 1. 6 mm 2 65 nm LDPC decoder chip achieves a peak throughput of 9 Gb/s at 89. 5 pJ/b, of which only 21 % is spent on eDRAMs. With voltage and frequency scaling, the power consumption of the LDPC decoder is reduced to 37. 7 mW for a 1. 5 Gb/s throughput at 35. 6 pJ/b.

40|$|Abstract—In dense IEEE 802. 11 networks, {{improving}} the effi-ciency of contention-based {{media access control}} is an important and challenging issue. Recently, the IEEE 802. 11 ah Task Group has discussed a group-synchronized distributed coordination func-tion (GS-DCF) for densely deployed wireless networks {{with a large number}} of stations. By using the restricted <b>access</b> <b>window</b> (RAW) and RAW slots, the GS-DCF is anticipated to improve the throughput substantially, primarily due to relieving the channel contention. However, optimizing the MAC configurations for the RAW, i. e., the number and duration of RAW slots, is still an open issue. In this paper, we first build an analytical model to track the performance of the GS-DCF in saturated 802. 11 networks. Then, we study and compare the GS-DCF throughput using both cen-tralized and decentralized grouping schemes. The accuracy of our model has been validated with simulation results. It is observed that the GS-DCF obtains a throughput gain of seven times or more over DCF in a network of 512 or more stations. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the decentralized grouping scheme can be implemented with a small throughput loss when compared with the centralized grouping scheme.

MAC layer contention can be improved with assistance from the AP, e.g., the scheduled access mode in WBAN or restricted <b>access</b> <b>window</b> similar to IEEE 802.11 ah. Packet routing strategy has not been a part of this study, leading to us using a simple RSSI based routing. Comparing different centralized and distributed routing mechanism can also be considered as part of future research.|$|E

Because of the need for a laser <b>access</b> <b>window,</b> the facility cannot rely on continuous blade pack suction to achieve stable flow. Instead, a combination of tailboards and strong suction upstream of the blade pack is used to create a two-dimensional periodic flow field at a chord Reynolds number of 500, 000. The distribution of the upstream suction is controlled through a complex baffling system. Details of the inlet and outlet flow are documented using five-hole pressure probes, blade static-pressure measurements, and sublimation flow visualization. Experimental data are presented on the flow field on the suction surface of the blade, the pressure surface, and near-wake flow fields...|$|E

40|$|Offshore {{wind farm}} {{maintenance}} operations {{are complex and}} dangerous, and as such are subject to strict safety constraints. In addition, crew and vessels must be scheduled in advance for both planned and reactive maintenance operations. Meteorological forecasts on many time-scales are used to inform scheduling decisions, but are imperfect. Short-term maintenance scheduling is therefore a problem of decision-making under uncertainty. This paper proposes a probabilistic approach to the short-term scheduling problem based on a cost-loss model for individual maintenance missions, and probabilistic forecasts of appropriate <b>access</b> <b>windows.</b> This approach is found to increase the utilisation of possible <b>access</b> <b>windows</b> compared to using deterministic decision rules. The impact of forecasting on the availability and operational costs of oshore wind is then examined using a Monte Carlo-based cost model.

40|$|Objectives: To {{test whether}} a {{reduction}} of bone window dimension, in a split-mouth randomized study design, focused on lateral sinus floor elevations, can achieve better results than a wider window in terms of augmented bone height and {{a reduction of}} patient discomfort and surgical complications. Materials and methods: Of the sixteen subjects enrolled in the study, each underwent a bilateral sinus lift procedure based on two different access flaps to maxillary sinus. Test side: small <b>access</b> <b>window</b> (6 × 6 mm) + bone filling using a special device. Control side: large <b>access</b> <b>window</b> (10 × 8 mm) + manual bone filling. Alveolar bone height and width were measured at pre-op and 6 -month post-op CT scans; repeatable measurements were obtained using radiographic stents. Surgical intervention duration was also recorded. Patients' evaluation of surgical discomfort was assessed using a VAS diagram at 7 -day, 14 -day and 30 -day follow-up. Results: A significant bone augmentation in height and width of alveolar crest was obtained in both test (8. 71 ± 1. 11 mm, 4. 70 ± 0. 58 mm) and control (8. 5 ± 2. 02 mm, 4. 68 ± 0. 70 mm) sides, although {{no significant differences were}} found between the two groups. Neither any significant differences emerge in data concerning the duration of the intervention (Test 42. 62 ± 6. 67 min, Control 41. 68 ± 8. 34 min). Patients' opinion relating to surgical discomfort showed a preference for test procedure at 7 -day, 14 -day and 30 -day follow-up. Conclusions: A reduction of window dimensions did not affect the safety of the surgical procedure. The two testing techniques showed no statistically significant differences in surgical intervention duration.

We formulate the problem based on overall energy consumption and the data rate of each RAW by applying probability theory. Then, we derive the energy efficiency of the uplink transmission. Last but not the least, a dynamic energy-aware window algorithm to adapt the RAW size is proposed to optimize the energy efficiency by identifying the number of slots in each RAW for different group scales.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The {{benefits}} of the gasoline direct injection engine over the more traditional gasoline port-fuel injection engine are well known and include the ability to operate lean of stoichiometric for fuel efficiency improvements, reduced knock propensity and reduced unburned hydrocarbons during cold start and transients. Nevertheless, {{a number of key}} challenges still remain including cyclic variability, abnormal combustion phenomena and increased particulate emissions. Our progress in each of these challenges is intrinsically linked {{to our understanding of the}} flow field formed within the cylinder. This paper presents the development, validation and subsequent utilisation of a 3 D-CFD gasoline direct injection engine model for making predictions of the in-cylinder flow field through the intake and compression strokes. An extensive validation exercise was completed using experimental data from a single cylinder optical research engine to validate both the intake runner, intake valve jet and in-cylinder flow fields. Validation results showed the model to generally compare well against experimental data including indicating data, intake runner velocities and flow momentum, valve jet and in-cylinder flow structures. Differences were identified in the timing of the detachment of the intake valve jet from the cylinder head and a subsequent reduction in effective flow area was hypothesised as contributing to an over prediction of the valve jet and in-cylinder flow velocities. A comparison of the spatial and temporal development of the in-cylinder flow field identified the model to well predict the flow structures through the intake and compression stroke. The model was then exercised with a view to evaluate the impact of solid boundaries on the spatial and temporal development of the in-cylinder flow structure. An analysis on the impact of using a pent-roof optical <b>access</b> <b>window</b> in research engines on the flow structure is also provided, indicating that significant asymmetry and additional recirculation zones in the corners of the <b>access</b> <b>window</b> should be considered when evaluating experimental results from a research engine of this configuration...|$|E
