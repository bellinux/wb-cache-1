500|$|The {{success of}} the reality series {{resulted}} {{in the development of}} several spin-off shows and other related programming. In April 2009, E! announced the first spin-off of Keeping Up with the Kardashians entitled Kourtney and Khloé in Miami, which was later renamed Kourtney and Khloé Take Miami. The series followed the sisters who moved to Miami to open a new Dash boutique. Ted Harbert, president and CEO of Comcast Entertainment Group, considered the sisters capable of handling their own standalone series. [...] "It's a very simple formula that we took from scripted TV and applied to a reality show. [...] There are a lot of family sitcom elements to 'Kardashians,' <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> humor and warmth will carry over to Miami," [...] Harbert added. The show premiered on August 16, 2009 to very high ratings; the first episode brought in 2.7 million total viewers and then became the most-watched show on the network since The Anna Nicole Show in 2002. The spin-off was subsequently renewed for a second season which premiered on June 13, 2010, and later returned as Kourtney and Kim Take Miami for a third season on January 20, 2013. Additionally, a series of webisodes entitled Lord Disick: Lifestyles of a Lord were released following the show, which showcased Disick as he informed viewers how to live like a [...] "king".|$|E

Pinkner {{defended the}} storyline against some critical fans, [...] "We understand {{that some people}} were frustrated, just like some people were frustrated {{with the idea of}} Bolivia having a baby. But there are things that we feel are entertaining to us, and that allow us to explore themes that... we can’t otherwise access. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> if it’s entertaining, and it allows Anna a chance to stretch, and it gives Walter Bishop his old partner back for an episode so we can see what they were like together... those are also perfectly valid reasons for doing those episodes." [...] Wyman added, [...] "Yeah, it was important. I mean, you know, for people that say it was just a diversion, well, there was something really important involved in that Walter/William relationship. That was part of Walter’s self-actualization, that moment when William Bell says, 'Look, you have to be on your own. You have to walk the path that you believe in. You gain some humility where there once was hubris, and it’s really important that you depend on yourself.' Part of our plan has always been to get Walter to embrace his flaws and uniqueness as strengths, rather than thinking of them inhibiting his performance as a scientist and as a character. We were really anxious to get that across, and the best person to do that for us was William Bell, because Walter depended so much on William in so many different ways. So that story came around at a time where we really needed to have it." [...] Because the season finale did not resolve the plotline of Olivia and the man from the blimp, Pinkner commented in a post-finale interview that [...] "It’s definitely still in play. Without being too spoilery, there are things you think you have time to explore in any given season, but don’t. But yes, we are very interested in that moment and the implications of that." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Seventh Circuit, Williams continued, had [...] "strained {{to find an}} {{interpretation}} other than designed for use ... A court should not strain to find unconstitutionality." [...] He reiterated that the ordinance {{was not meant to}} target a hardware dealer selling alligator clips, but head shops in particular. [...] "I think drug abuse is a serious cancer in our society, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> this will chill the retailing of these items to be used with illegal drugs." ...|$|E

30|$|In our opinion, Ultracision {{could become}} a first choice {{instrument}} for laparoscopic lymphadenectomy, as it enables simultaneous safe tissue dissection, haemostasis <b>and</b> cutting. <b>We</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> its favourable features will encourage more surgeons to perform laparoscopic lymphadenectomies.|$|R
30|$|The FTM {{transsexual}} {{patient is}} most typically childless and even virginal, {{which makes the}} vaginal route more difficult <b>and</b> hazardous. <b>We</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> this population constitutes a perfect indication for a laparoscopic hysterectomy, {{on the condition that}} the technique of laparoscopic hysterectomy does not increase the complication rate.|$|R
2500|$|The [...] "soft" [...] {{utilitarian}} {{position on}} animal rights {{is a moral}} intuition of many, probably most, Americans. We realize that animals feel pain, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> to inflict pain without a reason is bad. Nothing of practical value is added by dressing up this intuition {{in the language of}} philosophy; much is lost when the intuition is made a stage in a logical argument. When kindness toward animals is levered into a duty of weighting the pains of animals and of people equally, bizarre vistas of social engineering are opened up.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{anonymous}} review, in the November 1815 British Review, declared, [...] "The plot naturally claims {{our first}} notice, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> in this Mr. Southey {{has been very}} successful. It is highly dramatic, and affords scope for much play both of passion and feeling, though the latter predominates. Its materials are of heroic caliber, sufficiently dignified for the epic tone, yet blended with those topics to which a chord vibrates in every heart, and to relish which the common feelings of our nature are the only requisite qualification." [...] Like the previous poem, the November review concluded {{with an emphasis on}} the notes: [...] "We cannot conclude without entering a strong protest against the modern fashion of encumbering a poem with a body of notes, swelled by quotations, which nobody reads, and every body must pay for. It is a heavy tax on the reading part of the community, and we doubt whether it is one which answers in the end even to those who impose it".|$|E
2500|$|When {{the case}} was resolved, control of the Legacy of Kain {{trademark}} belonged to Crystal Dynamics, and Kain II was either canceled or superseded when Shifter became Soul Reaver. Though Crystal Dynamics staff who worked on Soul Reaver {{declined to comment on}} the discovery, Dyack had previously affirmed that [...] " [...] tried to take it over". He said that [...] "many people ask us if we like the direction they have gone in but it is so alien to what we created it is pointless to answer now. We understand that some people love the Soul Reaver series <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> is great. However, it is not what we would ever have done". In a 2008 interview, he elaborated his sentiment that [...] "if you look at Legacy of Kain where it is right now -- so diluted, so dysfunctional -- as a property itself, it's pretty much gone in a completely different direction than we would have ever taken it. [...] Even if the developer's good, and I think Crystal Dynamics is not a bad developer, you get this dilution of the content, because the original author is gone".|$|E
500|$|They {{point out}} that each table look-up require several cycles, being more {{expensive}} than simple arithmetic operations. They also found MurmurHash to be superior than tabulation hashing: [...] "By studying the results provided by Mult <b>and</b> Murmur, <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the trade-off for by tabulation (...) is less attractive in practice".|$|R

30|$|Second, {{publication}} and selection bias {{is a study}} limitation in every systematic review. The tendency to not publish studies with negative results might lead to an overestimation of our results. By using the PRISMA approach in combination with an extensive search, selection <b>and</b> inclusion, <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the influence of {{publication and}} selection bias is limited.|$|R

6000|$|It is {{significant}} that Sanazzaro, for what he may be worth, confines himself to the gossip of incest. Nowhere does he mention that Cesare was the murderer, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> his silence upon the matter, if it shows anything, shows that Cesare's guilt was not so very much the [...] "general opinion of the day," [...] as Gregorovius asks us to believe.|$|E

5000|$|In {{answer to}} the {{question}} of why it was a charter school, DeVos explained that [...] "Charter schools are available to everyone.... A charter school is a public school and therefore there's no tuition. So every student would have the possibility of going to this school at no cost <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> very, very important—to reach across the entire West Michigan community to be sure that every child has an opportunity to attend this school." [...] He added that [...] "This is the kind of school that I would have loved to have had if I was a kid." [...] He told a reporter for the Grand Rapids Press: [...] "If you're the kind of person who can't help but look up when you hear a plane overhead, then you're exactly the kind of person who will love this school....I have just a joy of flying....The world is such a different place when you can see it from 5,000 feet.

6000|$|His {{style is}} highly finished, graceful and truly classical. It {{would be hard}} to find a living author who had {{displayed}} such varied powers.

500|$|Initially, {{the game}} had a heavy anime style and Joanna Dark {{received}} many alterations throughout the development process. Lead Art Director Wil Overton {{explained that they}} [...] "wanted {{to bring her back}} in line with the way Rare do things. [...] We sorta wanted to stylize her up a bit and make her more iconic." [...] However, the designers ultimately decided to tone down the styling of the game a bit. The Xbox 360 gave the developers more possibilities to include what they always wanted and allowed them to create the game's co-operative mode, {{which was one of the}} first that could be played via Xbox Live. Designing the co-operative mode over Xbox Live was very challenging for the developers. According to Duncan Botwood, who was responsible for most of the multiplayer, [...] "It was quite an effort to put it in, to be honest. You have to cater for a number of eventualities you just don't get normally. <b>We</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> pulled it off, <b>and</b> because <b>we</b> pulled it off, other people might feel inspired to put the effort in, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>that's</b> a good thing." ...|$|R
60|$|J. D. Harding would paint {{mountains}} very nobly, if he {{made them}} of more importance in his compositions, but they are usually little more than backgrounds for his foliage or buildings; and it is his present system to make his backgrounds very slight. His color is very beautiful: indeed, both his and Fielding's are far more refined than Stanfield's. We wish he would oftener take up some wild subject dependent for interest on its mountain forms alone, as we should anticipate the highest results from his perfect drawing; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> such an exercise, occasionally gone completely through, would counteract a tendency which we perceive in his present distances, to become a little thin and cutting, if not incomplete.|$|E
6000|$|Beside {{the merit}} of conception, Mr. Poe's {{writings}} have also that of form. His style is highly finished, graceful and truly classical.

60|$|Of course, from a narrow, electioneering {{point of}} view, {{there are a}} great many people--I believe they are wrong--who think we should have done much better if we had put another penny on the income tax instead of {{increasing}} the tax upon tobacco. Well, I have come here this afternoon to tell you that we think it right that the working classes should be asked to pay a share towards the conduct of a democratic State. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> taxes on luxuries, however widely consumed, are a proper channel for such payment to be made. We believe that the working classes are able to pay by that channel, and we believe, further, that they are ready to pay.

40|$|One of the {{contemporary}} problems of dwelling concerns {{a threat to the}} interrelationship between settlements <b>and</b> geomorphology. <b>We</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{one of the most important}} peculiarities of public space is the power to represent these relations by means of architecture. Good quality architecture in public spaces would allow inhabitants to be a part of the places and territories in which they live. In the context of these problems, cycle-routes could play an important role, as a new kind of linear public space. They could become "geographical architecture"...|$|R
