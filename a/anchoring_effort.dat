As we near 2015, this article assesses ICTs? role in {{reaching}} the goals, {{with an emphasis}} on urban poverty. Over the lifespan of the MDGs, debate about ICTs and development has grown. At one pole of this debate are those who see ICTs as enabling rapid growth and citizen empowerment; at the other pole are those who warn that ?technical fixes? cannot overcome the historic and structural causes of poverty. In this article, using the organizing framework of the eight MDGs, we discuss these debates by reviewing examples of ICT projects that aim to further the goals? realization. Many of these projects suggest that ICTs are useful, particularly with respect to increasing information and enhancing services, a common theme throughout this article. However, we also raise critical queries about the allure of ?technology-boosterism? (Heeks, 2010, p. 629). These range from questioning the measurable impact and sustainability of ICT 4 D to the vision of development embedded in ICT 4 D and whether new technologies can subvert the underlying causes of global poverty. Our article shows that, while ICTs can be enablers for developmental processes, we must listen to communities in poverty when deciding how ICTs should feature in the post- 2015 agenda...|$|R
40|$|This report shares {{lessons learned}} from The Merck Company Foundation's decade of {{experience}} building immunization capacity in Africa. The Merck Vaccine Network [...] Africa, a philanthropic initiative to train immunization managers in Kenya, Mali, Uganda, and Zambia, suggests seven key lessons that can help other funders, governments, and NGOs designing or implementing similar vaccine delivery training programs improve the effectiveness and sustainability of their work. Merck's experience designing and supporting the initiative can offer valuable lessons for other actors in the immunization and broader global health fields who are engaged in or planning similar work. Specifically, we identify seven forward-looking lessons that can increase the effectiveness and sustainability of programs to build {{the capacity of the}} vaccine workforce in developing countries: Conduct a rigorous needs assessment to <b>anchor</b> <b>efforts</b> in local needs and priorities; Perform ongoing monitoring and evaluation (M&E) to enable programs to adapt, improve, and generate evidence of impact to attract new partners and funding; Create a sustainability plan at the outset to ensure that program impact is maintained beyond the conclusion of initial funding; Embed programs into local health systems to ensure that investments leverage existing infrastructure, relationships, and resources, and that impact can be sustained beyond the life of the program; Employ locally-adapted curricula and appropriate teaching techniques to maximize transfer and retention of relevant knowledge; Incorporate supportive supervision into programs to ensure that transferred knowledge is maintained and acted upon; Facilitate and support regular convening and communication, enabling continuous learning for improvement. In addition to describing the approach taken by MVN-A and the results achieved in the four focus countries, this paper provides additional detail on each lesson, supported by case studies from the MVNA experience...|$|R

40|$|Thermochemistry of gas-phase ion-water {{clusters}} {{together with}} {{estimates of the}} hydration free energy of the clusters and the water ligands are {{used to calculate the}} hydration free energy of the ion. Often the hydration calculations use a continuum model of the solvent. The primitive quasichemical approximation to the quasichemical theory provides a transparent framework to <b>anchor</b> such <b>efforts.</b> Here we evaluate the approximations inherent in the primitive quasichemical approach and elucidate the different roles of the bulk medium. We find that the bulk medium can stabilize configurations of the cluster that are usually not observed in the gas phase, while also simultaneously lowering the excess chemical potential of the ion. This effect is more pronounced for soft ions. Since the coordination number that minimizes the excess chemical potential of the ion is identified as the optimal or most probable coordination number, for such soft ions, the optimum cluster size and the hydration thermodynamics obtained without account of the bulk medium on the ion-water clustering reaction can be different from those observed in simulations of the aqueous ion. The ideas presented in this work are expected to be relevant to experimental studies that translate thermochemistry of ion-water clusters to the thermodynamics of the hydrated ion and to evolving theoretical approaches that combine high-level calculations on clusters with coarse-grained models of the medium...|$|R
40|$|The {{international}} community accepts that peace, justice and development are indivisible properties {{of human freedom}} and thus wants a more coordinated approach to post conflict recovery. Today, transitions to democracy are typically launched through constitutional negotiations and <b>anchored</b> in <b>efforts</b> to fix broken state institutions or create new ones. These are settled strategies for addressing {{the social and economic}} causes of conflict in troubled societies. Transitional justice (TJ) has been slow to appreciate or capitalize on the inherent potential of these political processes to further justice and peace. By not taking a wider view of the opportunities for change that are presented by the transitional moment, TJ limits its capacity to construct the institutions that must work if a return to conflict is to be prevented. With this in mind, prominent practitioners have begun to look at how to extend TJ’s brief to include a wider set of issues linked to social justice. They are also looking for concepts and tools to bridge the divide between the field and related disciplines.

An alternative route to standardisation could be based on an agreement to write programmes in some commonly accepted programming language.

40|$|Poster {{presented}} at BPS Annual Conference 2014. Objective: To investigate {{the impact of}} the anchoring bias and debiasing interventions with professional, expert software engineers. We hypothesised that debiasing strategies would reduce bias. Method: Ethical approval was given prior to conducting the study. Five experiments were conducted with software engineers (N= 118) in two locations. At each location, participants attended a workshop raising awareness of the impact on estimation of a range of cognitive biases, including anchoring. Immediately following the workshop, the participants at each location were divided into two groups (high versus low anchor) and asked to provide an estimate of effort for a familiar task. Data were analysed using Mann-Whitney tests. To test {{the impact of the}} workshop on the <b>anchoring</b> bias, <b>effort</b> estimation data collected previously with different samples of software engineers at each location, were compared with effort estimation data following the workshop (ANOVA). Results: The anchor had a large and significant impact (effect size, large, 0. 3; Mann-Whitney, p< 0. 0001) on the effort estimates. The impact of the anchor was significantly reduced following the workshop (effect size, large 0. 14; two-way ANOVA, p< 0. 0001). Conclusion: The impact of the anchoring bias on expert judgement is substantial and difficult to eradicate. Nevertheless, a debiasing activity such as attending a workshop to raise awareness can significantly reduce the effect. The study is limited in that the samples involved in the analysis {{of the impact of the}} workshop on effort estimation were independent. This will be addressed in further work...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Several {{organizations}} are advocating for patients' preferences {{to be considered}} in clinical practice guideline development and implementation. However, lack of agreement on the goal and meaning of this policy curtails evaluation and development of patient involvement programs. GOAL: To describe guideline developers' discourses on the goal of considering patients' preferences. METHOD: Design: Qualitative study using discourse analysis. Subjects: 18 participants (patients, health professionals, and public health experts) from 2 groups of British guideline developers. Data collection and analysis: Template analysis of semi-structured individual interviews was strengthened by active search for deviant cases, team debriefing, and member checking. RESULTS: All respondents supported the idea of taking account of patients' preferences in guidelines. Divergences with the goal and meaning of considering preferences were structured in 4 discourses: (1) The Governance discourse constructs guideline development as a rational process of synthesizing population data-including evidence on patients' preferences-to maximize public health within the constraints of available resources; (2) the Informed Decision discourse aims at fostering patients' choice by providing tailored information on the risks and benefits of interventions; (3) the Professional Care discourse insists on basing professionals' recommendations on the individual characteristics of patients; (4) The Consumer Advocacy discourse argues for greater political power and influence over guideline development and clinical decision making. CONCLUSIONS: The identified discourses provide a set of hypothesis on how patient involvement programs are expected to work, which could help clarify the goals pursued by guideline organizations and <b>anchor</b> further evaluation <b>efforts...</b>|$|R

5000|$|With {{the water}} in the {{engineering}} spaces rising rapidly, Maennle ordered the engines stopped and the sea <b>anchor</b> launched. These <b>efforts,</b> however, proved unequal to the task of making Arcturus ride the seas head-to. Instead, the yachts comparatively large top-hamper acted as a veritable sail which the wind used to swing the ship around broadside. At 15:25, Arcturus began broadcasting S.O.S. signals — answered swiftly by her old consort Amber and the tugs Oporto and Monsanta. In the meantime, with the engineers laboring in the sloshing, rising waters below, Arcturus put over [...] "oil bags" [...] on the weather side to minimize the effect of the heavy seas. Despite this, however, the yacht rolled [...] "dangerously" [...] in the trough of the sea. In view of the critical situation, Lt. Maennle mustered all hands — except those detailed to the sea anchor, radio, oil bags, and locating the leak in the engine room — at their abandon ship stations, with their life preservers on. Prepared for the worst, Arcturus men hung on. Then, shortly after Amber came close aboard at 15:55 to be told to stand by to leeward. Ens. Powers reported at 16:00 that he and his persevering (and wet) engineers had located the leak — the main injection pump had carried away — and efforts were being made to stop it and pump out the water which had risen to a height of 5 ft in the engine and fire rooms. The situation then looked much better for all concerned, so Arcturus annulled her S. 0. S. signals at 16:08, with Amber and Crucis sticking faithfully near. At 16:25, temporary repairs completed, Arcturus was ready to get underway and proceed to Lisbon.

6000|$|On {{a terrible}} night in 1857 a Portuguese brig struck on the Goodwin Sands. The noble, and now famous, Ramsgate {{lifeboat}} {{was at once}} towed out when the signal-rocket from the lightship was seen, indicating [...] "a wreck on the sands." [...] A terrific battle with the winds and waves ensued. At length the boat was cast off to windward of the sands, and bore down on the brig through the shoal water, which tossed her like a cork on its raging surface. They reached the brig and lay by her for {{some time in the}} hope of getting her off, but failed. The storm increased, the vessel began to break up, so her crew were taken into the boat, which-- having previously cast anchor to windward of the wreck, and eased off the cable until it got under her lee--now tried to pull back to its <b>anchor.</b> Every <b>effort</b> was fruitless, owing to the shifting nature of the sands and the fury of the storm. At last nothing was left for it but to hoist the sail, cut the cable, and make a desperate effort to beat off the sands. In this also they failed; were caught on the crest of a breaking roller, and borne away to leeward. Water and wind in wildest commotion were comparatively small matters to the lifeboat, but want of water was a serious matter. The tide happened to be out. The sands were only partially covered, and over them the breakers swept in a chaotic seething turmoil that is inconceivable by those who have not witnessed it. Every one has seen the ripples on the seashore when the tide is out. On the Goodwins these ripples are great banks, to be measured by yards instead of inches. From one to another of these sand-banks this boat was cast. Each breaker caught her up, hurled her onward a few yards, and let her down with a crash that well-nigh tore every man out of her, leaving her there a few moments, to be caught up again and made sport with by the next billow. The Portuguese sailors, eighteen in number, clung to the thwarts in silent despair, but the crew of the boat did not lose heart. They knew her splendid qualities, and hoped that, if they should only escape being dashed against the portions of wreck which strewed the sands, all might yet be well. Thus, literally fathom by fathom, with a succession of shocks that would have knocked any ordinary boat to pieces, was this magnificent lifeboat driven, during two hours in the dead of night, over two miles of the Goodwin Sands! At last she drove into deep water on the other side; the sails were set, and soon after, through God's mercy, the rescued men were landed safely in Ramsgate Harbour. So, we repeat, the lifeboat is almost indestructible.|$|R
40|$|The Crimean War of 1853 - 1856 {{provoked}} the hostility between the Russian and the English peoples. This {{had contributed to}} the confrontational thinking in {{the consciousness of the}} two peoples. The changes in mentality had for a long time been <b>anchored</b> through the <b>efforts</b> of the authorities and the media of that time (newspapers, magazines and cartoons). Military operations had led to the fact that their members had realized the disparity of the imposed stereotypes. Disappointment with propaganda clichés prompted some British to think over the reason for their personal failure, to get acquainted closer with the life of former enemies and to inform the public of their country about truth. The author carries out the analysis of unpublished archival documents from the State Archive of the Russian Federation (GA RF), which allow talking about the visit of former commander of the Baltic squadron of the English fleet, Vice-Admiral Ch. J. Napier to St. Petersburg in July 1856, and the surveillance of him by the Russian security police. Ch. J. Napier, motivated by the concepts of personal honour, aimed to get the Russian authorities’ confirmation of the correctness of his actions in the maritime campaign of 1854. He partially succeeded, but the Emperor Alexander II was not willing to meet with him. Ch. J. Napier had not succeeded in gaining justification from the British authorities either. Apparently, neither Russian nor British government no longer needed a positive image of the other country. The Russian-British relations had been tense (or worse) throughout the rest part of the 19 th century. Russia reoriented to France and (to a lesser extent) to the United States, while Britain found itself at the threshold of the “splendid isolation” era. Only the appearance of Germany as a dangerous enemy, which had established at the borders of the British colonial possessions {{in different parts of the}} world and had finally broken the “balance of powers” in Europe, made London and St. Petersburg forget the disputes and jointly oppose Berlin in 1914...|$|R
40|$|In April 2014, a {{convening}} {{of national}} housing equity experts was hosted in Jacksonville, Florida by the Jessie Ball duPont Fund. The convening's {{purpose was to}} gain insight from national stakeholders on affordable housing and equitable development challenges and opportunities in Jacksonville. From this two-day engagement, {{a number of major}} challenges and opportunities facing Jacksonville's housing development were clearly identified. Two of these findings directly inform this research effort. First, {{to meet the needs of}} Jacksonville's marginalized communities, an intentional focus on equity must stay at the forefront of community housing and development strategies. Second, if equity-focused development efforts are better aligned with health and/or educational stakeholders, affordable housing and equitable development could blossom in Jacksonville. Stable and affordable housing is essential to educational success and positive health outcomes for families and for communities. While the linkage between housing and educational and health outcomes is clear, educational and health stakeholders have not traditionally been deeply engaged in meeting housing need. Emerging initiatives across the country are countering this disengagement, demonstrating the important role that anchor institutions can play in supporting local housing needs. Community anchor institutions, such as educational entities (particularly higher education) and health care organizations can be powerful institutional resources to support equitable housing and community development. Throughout the nation, successful anchor institute-led housing interventions have been transformational in addressing community housing needs and community revitalization. These efforts have been most effective when equity goals are integrated into the design and implementation of <b>anchor</b> institute-led housing <b>efforts.</b> The following report provides select case studies with a strong social equity focus and comparability to Jacksonville. We identify lessons learned and summarize models which can be equally transformative in Jacksonville from these case studies.

40|$|Current {{treatment}} of neovascular AMD with 0. 5 mg ranibizumab {{consists of a}} 3 -month loading phase and a maintenance phase in which injections happen on a pro re nata basis. This non-interventional study was aimed to evaluate the treatment regimen with ranibizumab in everyday practice during the 12 -month observation period. 185 eyes of 176 patients were treated with three intravitreal injections of ranibizumab 0. 5 mg every 4 weeks. Further follow up visits were {{carried out by the}} patient's primary ophthalmologist. To verify the effectiveness of this strategy, the patients were evaluated for their best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central retinal thickness measured with time-domain optical coherence tomography (TD-OCT) at baseline, during the loading phase and 12 months after the initial injection. Primary endpoint was the proportion of eyes that lost more than 15 ETDRS letters after 12 months compared to baseline. Of 185 initially treated eyes 181 eyes went through the full loading phase. The mean visual acuity increased from 49 ± 16 ETDRS letters to 54 ± 18 ETDRS letters. 25 % (46 / 185 eyes) presented to our clinic during the maintenance phase due to visual deterioration. 42 eyes (23 %) received additional intravitreal injections of 0. 5 mg ranibizumab. 163 eyes of 155 patients (88 %) completed the follow up at month 12. The visual acuity gains at month 3 were lost and mean visual acuity dropped to 47 ± 24 ETDRS letters at month 12. A total of 40 eyes (22 %) experienced a severe loss of visual acuity of more than 15 ETDRS letters during this period.

An intermediary tower-articulated arm device, for {{attachment to}} three-point hitch of mounted implements, with ground whells, more specifically, multiple row seed-planters, {{was developed and}} tested on draft determination works. A single ring with electrical extensometers connected in full bridge, was used for sense traction compression <b>efforts,</b> <b>anchored</b> by flexible steel cables between the implement bar and {{the base of the}} intermediary tower. Designed for works on tie range of 0 - 6, 000 N, submitted to static calibration tests, showed high linearity, with R = 0. 9997, an excellent zero return and a resolution of around 70 N. A seven row seed-planter was then tested in two sites, firm ground, plane and inclined, and plane, prepared for planting. Draft values from the two first conditions were highly consistent with results obtained from simple theoretical calculus. This, allied to it's simplicity of conception, confers to tire device a great deal of reliability. It's use alters the tractor-implement geometry, not being a major problem if there is interest on draft efforts only, for these kind of implements. Results from works in the site prepared for planting, so different from literature citations, say about of convenience of sistematic work for the knowledge of real draft requirements of mounted implements in our conditions...|$|R
