25|$|The BfR {{responded that}} IARC {{reviewed}} only {{a selection of}} what they had reviewed earlier, and argued that other studies, including a cohort study called <b>Agricultural</b> <b>Health</b> Study, do not support the classification. The IARC report did not include unpublished industry-funded studies, including one completed by the IARC panel leader, Aaron Blair, who stated that agency policy required that he not consider this study. The agency's international protocol dictates that only published studies be used in classifications of carcinogenicity, since national regulatory agencies including the EPA have allowed agrochemical corporations to conduct their own unpublished research, which may be biased in support of their profit motives. Monsanto called the IARC report biased and said it wanted it to be retracted. The corporation started a case against California's carcinogen classification in 2016, and lost the suit in March 2017.|$|E

Additionally the COTED resolved the disagreement on duck meat trade between Trinidad and Tobago and Suriname, with Trinidad and Tobago now willing (by mid-November 2017) to approve Suriname as one of the countries that has met the sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) requirements for exporting duck meat to the country.|$|E

40|$|<b>Agricultural</b> {{safety and}} <b>health</b> {{education}} has been an agenda item for various government and non-profit organizations working {{to reduce the number}} of agricultural injuries and deaths to young people. <b>Agricultural</b> safety and <b>health</b> {{education has been}} recognized as effectively helping {{to reduce the number of}} on-farm injuries and deaths, despite facing barriers and challenges. One of the largest challenges <b>agricultural</b> safety and <b>health</b> professionals face is reaching a captivated audience of the desirable age. When audience, learning theories, and teaching methods are considered, one viable route for teaching <b>agricultural</b> safety and <b>health</b> education is in the secondary agricultural education classroom. The purpose of this study was to determine the current practices and attitudes of Iowa high school agricultural educators regarding <b>agricultural</b> safety and <b>health</b> education. The accessible population for this census study consisted of 216 Iowa agriculture teachers. Findings were based on data obtained through a web-based survey from 137 Iowa high school agricultural educators. Non-response error was controlled. Findings from this study indicated that most Iowa high school agriculture teachers are teaching some aspect of <b>agricultural</b> safety and <b>health</b> in their classroom utilizing a variety of teaching tools from various resources. <b>Agricultural</b> safety and <b>health</b> is most commonly taught as part of a larger agricultural science unit, as opposed to being taught as its own unit of study. Iowa agriculture teachers recognized strengths, such as the quality of materials, and weaknesses, including the need for professional development, to <b>agricultural</b> safety and <b>health</b> education and identified limitations they face in teaching the topic. Ultimately, the results of this study brought greater understanding of Iowa high school agriculture teachers 2 ̆ 7 practices in <b>agricultural</b> safety and <b>health</b> education and their attitudes towards <b>agricultural</b> safety and <b>health</b> education. <b>Agricultural</b> safety and <b>health</b> professionals can benefit from addressing the findings and the recommendations of this study in the development of <b>agricultural</b> safety and <b>health</b> education materials...|$|R
