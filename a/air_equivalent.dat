[...] Geiger and Marsden didn't know what the positive charge of the nucleus of their metals were (they had only just discovered the nucleus existed at all), but they assumed it was proportional to the atomic weight, so they tested whether the scattering was proportional to the atomic weight squared. Geiger and Marsden covered the holes of the disc with foils of gold, tin, silver, copper, and aluminum. They measured each foil's stopping power by equating it to an equivalent thickness of air. They counted the number of scintillations per minute that each foil produced on the screen.

5000|$|The Southwest Research and Information Center {{released}} a report on April 15, 2014 that {{one or more of}} 258 contact handled radioactive waste containers located in Room 7, Panel 7 of the underground repository released radioactive and toxic chemicals. The location of the leak was estimated to be approximately 1500 ft from the air monitor that triggered the contaminants in the filtration system. The contaminants were spread through more than 3000 ft of underground tunnels, leading to the 2150 ft exhaust shaft into the surrounding above-ground environment. Air monitoring station #107, located 0.5 mi away, detected the radiotoxins.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this investigation}} were to examine whether airborne particles induceDNA damaging and estrogen-disrupting effectsand to explore the relationships between them. In this study, airborne particulate was collected at an urban, a suburban, and a ruralsite in central Taiwan. The organic solvent extracts of airborne particulate were examined in human MCF- 7 and T 47 D-KBluc breastcancer cells. We observed significant increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in MCF- 7 cells after treatment with theparticulate extracts whereas aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) antagonist blocked the particulate-induced ROS generation in cells. Further, induction of CYP 1 A 1 protein expression was confirmed by immunoblots in cells treated with airborne particles, suggestingthe roles of AhR status in mediating the particulate-induced toxicity. In addition, we observed that at non-cytotoxic concentration(∼ 0. 01 m 3 <b>air</b> <b>equivalent),</b> airborne particles induced decreases in intracellularNAD(P) H andNAD+ in MCF- 7 cells. These decreaseswere completely blocked by three types of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase- 1 (PARP- 1) inhibitors. Moreover, we demonstrated increasesin the number of DNA strand breaks in MCF- 7 cells exposed to airborne particles {{as measured by the}} single-cell gel electrophoresis(Comet) assay. Overall, this evidence confirms that airborne particles induce decreases in intracellular NAD(P) H and NAD+ throughPARP- 1 activation mediated by formation of DNA strand breaks. Furthermore, we confirmed that with series dilution airborneparticles (∼ 10 − 7 – 10 − 2 m 3 <b>air</b> <b>equivalent)</b> possess both estrogenic and anti-estrogenic activities as determined by the ERα-mediatedreporter gene assay in human T 47 D-KBluc breast cancer cells. In conclusions, we confirmed that the DNA-damaging activity andestrogenicity of airborne particles varied considerably with concentration (<b>air</b> <b>equivalent).</b> Our findings add further support to thetheme that ROS formation is a significant determinant factor in mediating the induction of oxidative DNA damage and repair inhuman breast cancer cells exposed to airborne particles and that oxidative stress and the subsequent induction of DNA damage may,in part, contribute to airborne particle-induced carcinogenesis...|$|E

A subsequent re-programming phase followed by characterization was performed to asses their post-irradiation charge restoring capabilities. It was found that up to 73 % of the initial maximum threshold voltage could be recovered. A sensitivity of up to 9 mV/Gy with an uncertainty of less than 1 %, an excellent linearity up to the maximum programmable threshold voltage and low noise suggest {{the use of this}} technology for in vivo dosimetry applications...|$|E

40|$|In this study, a {{numerical}} investigation on the radiative and convective {{performance of the}} combustion of pulverised Russian coal having higher Calorific value in a 0. 5 MWth combustion test facility (CTF) has been conducted for air and CO 2 -rich oxy-fired environment considering an IFRF Aerodynamically Air Staged Burner (AASB) configured with the furnace. This study is carried out considering a finite volume method (FVM) tool using AVL Fire version 2009. 2 coupled with the user defined subroutines especially for the coal devolatilisation and char combustion modelling. This code is validated comparing the experimental radiative heat flux with the numerically predicted data and results show that reasonable agreement has been found with the measured radiative heat flux on the furnace wall. Different combustion environments were investigated including an air-fired as reference case and three recycled flue gas (RFG) fired combustion environments. The different cases are composed of varying recycled ratio (RR) between 65 % and 75 %. It {{was found that the}} flame temperature distribution for the reference case (air fired) and RR 72 % case were found to be similar. The flame temperature increased with O 2 concentration and decreasing RR. With the decrease of RR, the length of the flame is also shortened. The ignition condition improved with enriched O 2 concentration in the RR 65 % (O 230. 9 %, CO 269. 2 % by mass) case. The results show that radiative and convective heat flux is significantly manipulated by the RR. The position of peak radiative flux moves downstream with increasing RR due to increased mass flow rate and reduced O 2 at higher RR. With the increase of normalised total flow (NTF), mean flame temperature and exit temperature decreased whereas with the increase of normalised O 2 flow (NOF), mean flame temperature and exit temperature increase. The presented working range for the Russian coal, suggests that the <b>air</b> <b>equivalent</b> radiative heat flux can be obtained at a RR &# 8776; 71 % while <b>air</b> <b>equivalent</b> flame temperature were observed at RR of 72 %.

40|$|Abstract. Based on the {{existing}} quality problems of external wall insulation system, a new external wall insulation system was developed through the rational use of closed air layer’s thermal insulation performance.

This paper takes the extreme value of indoor and outdoor temperature in summer as the temperature loads of this model and uses ANSYS simulation to obtain its heat flow density, gradient and temperature field, and in the meanwhile, undertakes a comparison with the present form of external wall insulation in the new code. Data indicates that in the same index of energy saving, this system can not only {{meet the needs of}} the code, but also reduce the requirement of heat insulator, as well as greatly improve anti-cracking and waterproofing ability. Thus, the new system follows the direction of the development in this field...|$|E
