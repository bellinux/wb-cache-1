5|$|A major {{difference}} from the US Navy tables is that the repetitive group designators represent nitrogen levels in all tissues, unlike the USN table which represent only the 120-minute compartment. The Huggins repetitive group indicates {{a percentage of the}} M0 for the most saturated tissue, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> intended to make the tables more applicable to multilevel diving procedures.|$|E
5|$|A {{memorial}} {{was erected}} at St Mary's Church and Grange Road cemetery in Gillingham, Kent. It was used from 1867 until 1973 when {{the site was}} largely cleared of memorials to provide a community open space for the local population. Then Woodlands Road Cemetery was used <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the site of HMS Glatton's Memorial with the graves of one officer and 56 men.|$|E

5|$|A {{parasitic}} fly, Lucilia bufonivora, attacks adult common toads. It lays its eggs on the toad's {{skin and}} when these hatch, the larvae crawl into the toad's nostrils and eat its flesh internally with lethal consequences. The European fingernail clam (Sphaerium corneum) {{is unusual in}} that it can climb up water plants and move around on its muscular foot. It sometimes clings to the toe of a common toad <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> believed {{to be one of}} the means by which it disperses to new locations.|$|E
5|$|All cells, {{and many}} viruses, produce {{proteins}} that are enzymes called DNA polymerase and RNA polymerase which make new copies of DNA and RNA. A virus's polymerase enzymes are often {{much more efficient}} at making DNA and RNA than the host cell's. However, RNA polymerase enzymes often make mistakes, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the reasons}} why RNA viruses often mutate to form new strains.|$|E
5|$|All of {{the lower}} {{respiratory}} tract including the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles is lined with respiratory epithelium. This is a ciliated epithelium interspersed with goblet cells which produce mucus, and club cells with actions similar to macrophages. Incomplete rings of cartilage in the trachea and smaller plates of cartilage in the bronchi, keep these airways open. Bronchioles are too narrow to support cartilage and their walls are of smooth muscle, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> largely absent in the narrower respiratory bronchioles which are mainly just of epithelium. The respiratory tract ends in lobules. Each lobule consists of a respiratory bronchiole, which branches into alveolar ducts and alveolar sacs, which in turn divide into alveoli.|$|E

5|$|An {{overhead}} or penetration diving {{environment is}} where the diver enters a space from {{which there is no}} direct, purely vertical ascent to the safety of breathable atmosphere at the surface. Cave diving, wreck diving, ice diving and diving inside other natural or artificial underwater structures or enclosures are examples. The restriction on direct ascent increases the risk of diving under an overhead, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> usually addressed by adaptations of procedures and use of equipment such as redundant breathing gas sources and guide lines to indicate the route to the exit.|$|E
5|$|Arundel's {{body was}} {{initially}} interred at the Franciscan church in Hereford. It {{had been his}} wish, however, to be buried at the family's traditional resting place of Haughmond Abbey in Shropshire, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> where he was finally buried. Though he was never canonised, a cult emerged around the late earl in the 1390s, associating him with the 9th-century martyr king St Edmund. This veneration may {{have been inspired by}} a similar cult around his grandson, Richard FitzAlan, 11th Earl of Arundel, who was executed by Richard II in 1397.|$|E
5|$|At Kilve are {{the remains}} of a red brick retort, built in 1924, when it was {{discovered}} that the shale found in the cliffs was rich in oil. The beach is part of the Blue Anchor to Lilstock Coast SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest). Along this coast the cliffs are layered with compressed strata of oil-bearing shale and blue, yellow and brown lias embedded with fossils. In 1924 Forbes-Leslie founded the Shaline Company to exploit them. This retort house is thought to be the first structure erected here for the conversion of shale to oil but the company was unable to raise sufficient capital <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> now all that remains of the anticipated Somerset oil boom.|$|E
50|$|AT&T {{created a}} {{building}} for recruiting {{staff in the}} 1950s. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> called The Assessment Centre <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> influential on subsequent personnel methods in other businesses.|$|R

5|$|Atlantic puffins are {{probably}} safest when out at sea. Here, the dangers are often from below the water rather than above, and puffins {{can sometimes be}} seen putting their heads underwater to peer around for predators. Seals {{have been known to}} kill puffins and large fish may also do so. Most puffin colonies are on small islands, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> no coincidence as it avoids predation by ground-based mammals such as foxes, rats, stoats and weasels, cats and dogs. When they come ashore, the birds are still at risk and the main threats come from the sky.|$|E
5|$|Because {{almost all}} {{other species of}} amphidromine gastropods, such as ones within the genera Partula and Achatinella, have already become extinct, the genus Amphidromus, {{containing}} over 110 species, is uniquely useful {{for the study of}} the evolution of asymmetry in animals, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> why the conservation of this genus is of essential importance to biologists.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{in central}} California of the {{subspecies}} propinquus {{are considered to}} be still increasing their range, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> probably the case elsewhere in the U.S.A.|$|E

5|$|Certain genera of gram-positive bacteria, such as Bacillus, Clostridium, Sporohalobacter, Anaerobacter, and Heliobacterium, {{can form}} highly resistant, dormant {{structures}} called endospores. In almost all cases, one endospore is formed <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> not a reproductive process, although Anaerobacter {{can make up}} to seven endospores in a single cell. Endospores have a central core of cytoplasm containing DNA and ribosomes surrounded by a cortex layer and protected by an impermeable and rigid coat. Dipicolinic acid is a chemical compound that composes 5% to 15% of the dry weight of bacterial spores. It is implicated as responsible for the heat resistance of the endospore.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of Kithsirimevan (301–328), Sudatta, the sub king of Kalinga, and Hemamala brought the Tooth Relic of the Buddha to Sri Lanka because of unrest in their country. Kithsirimevan carried it in {{procession}} and placed the relic in a mansion named Datadhatughara. He ordered this procession to be held annually, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> still done as a tradition in the country. The Tooth Relic of the Buddha soon {{became one of the}} most sacred objects in the country, and a symbol of kingship. The person who was in possession of the Tooth Relic would be the rightful ruler of the country. Therefore, it was often enshrined within the royal palace itself.|$|E

5|$|For a few centuries, Europeans had {{experimented with}} American vines and plants in their soil, and many {{varieties}} were imported from America without regulation, disregarding {{the possibility of}} pest transfer, and related problems. Jules-Emile Planchon, a French biologist, who identified the Phylloxera in the 1860s, maintained that this transfer of American vines and plants into Europe greatly increased between roughly 1858 and 1862, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> how the Phylloxera was accidentally introduced to Europe around 1860, although the aphid did not enter France until around 1863. It is believed that the advent of steamships was a factor as well, as the ships were faster, and the Phylloxera were able to survive the quicker ocean voyage.|$|E
5|$|Found in open woods, parks, hedges and {{cultivated}} land, the mistle thrush feeds {{on a wide}} variety of invertebrates, seeds and berries. Its preferred fruits including those of the mistletoe, holly and yew. Mistletoe is favoured where it is available, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> reflected in the thrush's English and scientific names; the plant, a parasitic species, benefits from its seeds being excreted by the thrush onto branches where they can germinate. In winter, a mistle thrush will vigorously defend mistletoe clumps or a holly tree as a food reserve for when times are hard.|$|E
5|$|Hwa Chong Institution {{offers a}} wide variety of extra-curricular activities, {{labelled}} Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) by the Ministry of Education, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> in part due to the school's large student population and size.|$|E
