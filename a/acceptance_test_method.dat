40|$|The {{ambiguity}} <b>acceptance</b> <b>test</b> is {{an important}} quality control procedure in high precision GNSS data processing. Although the ambiguity <b>acceptance</b> <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> have been extensively investigated, its threshold determine method is still not well understood. Currently, the threshold is determined with the empirical approach or the fixed failure rate (FF-) approach. The empirical approach is simple but lacking in theoretical basis, while the FF-approach is theoretical rigorous but computationally demanding. Hence, the key of the threshold determination problem is how to efficiently determine the threshold in a reasonable way. In this study, a new threshold determination method named threshold function method is proposed to reduce {{the complexity of the}} FF-approach. The threshold function method simplifies the FF-approach by a modeling procedure and an approximation procedure. The modeling procedure uses a rational function model to describe the relationship between the FF-difference test threshold and the integer least-squares (ILS) success rate. The approximation procedure replaces the ILS success rate with the easy-to-calculate integer bootstrapping (IB) success rate. Corresponding modeling error and approximation error are analysed with simulation data to avoid nuisance biases and unrealistic stochastic model impact. The results indicate the proposed method can greatly simplify the FF-approach without introducing significant modeling error. The threshold function method makes the fixed failure rate threshold determination method feasible for real-time applications...|$|R

These double-walled spherical tanks with powdered insulation in the annular region, have received minimal refurbishment or even inspection over the years. Intrusively inspecting these tanks would mean a significant down time to the program as the cryogenic liquid and the perlite insulation {{would have to be}} removed which would be a significant task and long-term schedule disruption. A study of the tanks was performed {{to determine the extent to}} which performance and structural information could be revealed without intrusive inspection. Thermal images of the tanks were taken over a variety of environmental conditions to determine the best conditions under which to compare and use thermography as a health monitoring technique as the tanks continue to age. The settling and subsequent compaction of insulation is a serious concern for cryogenic tanks. Comparison of images from the tanks reveals significant variations in the insulation in the annual regions and point to the use of thermography as a way to monitor for insulation migration and possible compaction. These measurements, when combined with mathematical models of historical boil-off data provide key insight to the condition of the vessels. <b>Acceptance</b> <b>testing</b> <b>methods</b> for new tanks, before they are filled with cryogenic commodity (and thereby thermally cycled), are needed and we explore how thermography can be used to accomplish this...|$|R

The program plan for selection and qualification of a replacement for NARC rayon was approved in August 1998. Screening activities began in February 1999.

40|$|Sustainability {{has become}} one of the most {{important}} design factors for pavement engineers over the last several years. Much of this focus has been on reducing material costs for pavement infrastructure by using innovative materials into traditional pavement design. Pervious concrete pavement has the ability to offset the typical requirement for stormwater management ponds for large paved areas. It can be considered as an alternative to impervious pavement systems as the open void structure of pervious concrete pavement allows water to infiltrate very quickly through it and join the natural ground water table. As a result, it does not disturb the natural hydrological cycle or increase the demand on the local stormwater management. Besides stormwater management, pervious concrete can also provide environmental and economic benefits such as removing water pollutants, reducing noise pollution, lowering the heat island effect, lowering light demand, and increasing driver safety through improved visibility. Pervious concrete pavement is receiving more and more interest recently due to the pressure by environmental agencies and environmental acts to reduce the quantity of stormwater runoff from urban areas. The introduction of pervious concrete pavements in cold weather climatic regions, specifically Canada, was driven by their sustainable benefits. However, there has been caution in the pavement industry to use pervious concrete in climates that experience freeze-thaw cycles. Literature shows that there is no dedicated <b>test</b> <b>method</b> to assess the performance of pervious concrete, which is structurally substantially different from conventional concrete pavements. The increased use of pervious concrete in roads, walkways, and parking lots demands improved specifications, performance criteria, and <b>acceptance</b> <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> for evaluating structural performance and durability of this innovative concrete product. The main objective of this research is to recommend specifications and performance criteria for pervious concrete based on the results of experimental investigations and field experience in Ontario, Canada. Above all, this study attempts to establish test procedures for evaluation of durability and performance of pervious concrete pavement. Initially the <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> available for conventional concrete were performed, the gaps were identified and the <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> were modified. Field samples were also collected and the modified <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> were performed on the field cores to define correlation between the laboratory and the field samples. Several pervious concrete field sites were constructed by the Centre for Pavement and Transportation Technology (CPATT) at the University of Waterloo, the Cement Association of Canada, and several other industry members from 2007 to 2011. Initial results from this work have been published previously. This research described herein involved continued collection of drainage data from instruments such as the moisture gauge measurements, strain gauge at three sites that are still being monitored. This field/laboratory study provides insight into the longer term drainage performance of pervious concrete pavement. This study has also involved an evaluation of the latest mix design, which has also built upon previous research. In addition new <b>test</b> <b>methods</b> have been evaluated and now that the pervious test sections are more than seven years old, the longer term drainage monitoring has been assessed. Barriers to implementing this technology are being solved, as the research is assisting designers on the various functional and structural design aspects.
