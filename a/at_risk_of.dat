5|$|Alcohol {{detoxification}} or 'detox' for alcoholics is {{an abrupt}} stop of alcohol drinking {{coupled with the}} substitution of drugs, such as benzodiazepines, that have similar effects to prevent alcohol withdrawal. Individuals who are only <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms can be detoxified as outpatients. Individuals <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> a severe withdrawal syndrome {{as well as those}} who have significant or acute comorbid conditions are generally treated as inpatients. Detoxification does not actually treat alcoholism, and it is necessary to follow up detoxification with an appropriate treatment program for alcohol dependence or abuse to reduce the risk of relapse. Some symptoms of alcohol withdrawal such as depressed mood and anxiety typically take weeks or months to abate while other symptoms persist longer due to persisting neuroadaptations. Alcoholism has serious adverse effects on brain function; on average it takes one year of abstinence to recover from the cognitive deficits incurred by chronic alcohol abuse.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Nowadays, {{the problem}} of students’ {{adaptation}} to the educational process proves to be urgent, cardiovascular diseases ranking first among adaptation disorders. Early development of arterial hypertension (AH) is of peculiar concern. However, the mechanisms of adaptation to the educational process {{as well as the}} causes accounting for the development of AH in young people have not been studied sufficiently so far. The objective is to find out the peculiarities of cardiac intervalography and psychological state of virtually healthy young males and females <b>at</b> different <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> AH development. Materials and methods. 150 boys and 173 girls aged 16 to 21 years, all of them were students of the medical university, were examined. Measurement of the arterial pressure (AP) in the lying position was followed by the calculation of the mean hemodynamic pressure. The level above 90 mmHg pointed <b>at</b> high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> AH development, whereas 90 mmHg and lower suggested its insignificant probability. Cardiac activity of autonomous regulation was estimated at the starting point and on the sixth minute of the postural test according to R. M. Baevsky method. The “BHC-Микро” device (Russia) was used. Psychological characteristics were studied by FPI questionnaire (form B). Parametric methods of statistical analysis were used. The sampling contingent was formed by means of stratified randomization. Results. It was found that in the lying position the activity of the sympathetic part of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) prevailed in boys and girls <b>at</b> high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> AH development compared to those with the lower one. Adequate regulatory mechanisms were activated in orthostasis, specifically, the tone of the ANS sympathetic part increased. Students <b>at</b> low <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> AH development revealed enhanced intensity of regulatory mechanisms due to activation of both ANS parts. This appears to be adequate for the given group and indicates larger adaptation reserves, since all values are comparable with those in the group <b>of</b> students <b>at</b> high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> AH development. The tone of the ANS parasympathetic part was found to increase significantly in the female students <b>at</b> low <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> AH development. Meanwhile, reduced tone of the ANS sympathetic part was evident in the girls <b>at</b> high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> AH development. If compared to the boys, more intensive starting activity of the ANS sympathetic part <b>at</b> low <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> AH development alongside with the reduced activity <b>at</b> high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> AH development was noted in the girls in orthostasis. So, the sex difference of ANS tone persisting <b>at</b> low <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> AH development was found to be vanishing <b>at</b> the growing <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> the disease. The latter may be attributed to the aggravated stress state in the given group of youths as well as activated adrenal cortex, thus contributing to the increased <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> AH development. FPI testing of the psychological state found no more than sex difference between the groups <b>at</b> different <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> AH development. Conclusions. 1. In the lying position, cardiac intervalographic findings revealed prevailing activity of the ANS sympathetic part in boys and girls <b>at</b> high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> AH development. 2. In orthostasis, larger adaptation reserves were noted in the students <b>at</b> low <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> AH development compared to those <b>at</b> high <b>risk.</b> 3. <b>At</b> high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> AH development, the sex difference in the autonomous support of the cardiac rhythm was found to be vanishing alongside with the growing activity of the sympathetic part, which predisposes AH development. 4. FPI testing of the psychological state found no difference between the groups <b>at</b> different <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> AH development...|$|R
