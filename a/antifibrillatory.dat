Midrio M, Danieli-Betto D, Megighian A, Velussi C, Catani C, Carraro U. Source Istituto di Fisiologia Umana, Università di Padova, Italy. Abstract The myofibrillar changes of rat denervated soleus muscle were studied in the presence {{and in the absence of}} an <b>antifibrillatory</b> drug. After bilateral sciaticotomy, a concentrated solution of procainamide hydrochloride was steadily released, by way of a miniosmotic pump, in the space between the soleus and the gastrocnemius muscles of one leg. Fibrillation activity of soleus muscles was checked electromyografically at 3 - to 5 -day intervals. On the 21 st day following denervation the muscles were excised, stained for adenosine triphosphatase activity and analysed for myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms. In the denervated-procainamide-treated muscles fibrillation was consistently (- 75 % on average) depressed in comparison to the contralateral denervated muscles. Type 1 (slow) fibres and MHC isoform were also significantly reduced, to the advantage of type 2 A (fast) fibres and MHC isoform. The results support the view that denervation inactivity, like other kinds of muscle inactivity, favours the expression of fast type myofibrillar isoforms, and that this effect is counteracted, at least partially, by the spontaneous activity of the denervated muscle.

Patients with PAF undergoing PV isolation were randomized > 1 month before their procedure into a control group (n = 18) or a fish oil group (n = 18) in an unblinded fashion. The latter were supplemented with fish oil 6 g/day for a mean of 40 ± 12 days. Pulmonary venous and left atrial effective refractory periods (ERPs), PV conduction, and susceptibility to AF initiated within PVs were assessed. Compared to the control group, the fish oil group had (1) longer left-sided (p = 0. 002) and right-sided (p = 0. 001) pulmonary venous ERPs; (2) less dispersion of pulmonary venous ERPs (left PVs p = 0. 001, right PVs p = 0. 07); (3) longer left atrial ERPs (p = 0. 02); (4) no difference in pulmonary venous conduction; (5) lower incidence of AF initiated from PVs during ERP testing (77 % vs 31 %, p = 0. 02); and (6) prolongation of mean AF cycle length (p = 0. 009) and shortest AF cycle length in PVs (p = 0. 04).

40|$|AbstractObjectivesWe {{investigated}} the antiarrhythmic effects of intrapericardial nitroglycerin (NTG) during acute myocardial ischemia in the porcine heart. BackgroundNitroglycerin is a nitric oxide donor that exerts potent {{effects on the}} cardiovascular system. Intrapericardial administration allows investigation of pharmacologic actions on cardiac tissue in an in vivo system while minimizing the confounding influences of systemic effects. MethodsIn 29 closed-chest pigs, myocardial ischemia was induced by intraluminal balloon occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Arrhythmia incidence was monitored during 5 -min balloon inflations performed without drug and at 15, 45, 75, and 105 min after NTG (4, 000 μg bolus) administered by percutaneous transatrial access into the pericardial space. Electrocardiograms were monitored for ischemia-induced T-wave alternans (TWA), a marker of electrical instability. The antiadrenergic potential of NTG was investigated by examining the drug’s suppression of dobutamine-induced increase in myocardial contractility. ResultsControl coronary artery occlusion provoked ventricular fibrillation (VF) in all animals. Intrapericardial NTG suppressed VF at 45 min in all six pigs (p < 0. 05) and reduced TWA across a parallel time course (from 459. 1 ± 144. 4 μV before drug to 42. 22 ± 13. 96 μV at 45 min, p = 0. 047). The <b>antifibrillatory</b> effect occurred as early as 15 min and persisted for up to 75 min.

40|$|AbstractFibroblasts are {{activated}} {{in heart}} failure (HF) and produce fibrosis, which {{plays a role}} in maintaining atrial fibrillation (AF). The effect of HF on fibroblast ion currents and its potential role in AF are unknown. Here, we used a patch-clamp technique to investigate the effects of HF on atrial fibroblast ion currents, and mathematical computation to assess the potential impact of this remodeling on atrial electrophysiology and arrhythmogenesis. Atrial fibroblasts were isolated from control and tachypacing-induced HF dogs. Tetraethylammonium-sensitive voltage-gated fibroblast current (IKv,fb) was significantly downregulated (by ∼ 44 %), whereas the Ba 2 +-sensitive inward rectifier current (IKir,fb) was upregulated by 79 %, in HF animals versus controls. The fibroblast resting membrane potential was hyperpolarized (− 53 ± 2  mV vs. − 42 ± 2  mV in controls) and the capacitance was increased (29. 7 ± 2. 2 pF vs. 17. 8 ± 1. 4 pF in controls) in HF. These experimental findings were implemented in a mathematical model that included cardiomyocyte-fibroblast electrical coupling. IKir,fb upregulation had a profibrillatory effect through shortening of the action potential duration and hyperpolarization of the cardiomyocyte resting membrane potential. IKv,fb downregulation had the opposite electrophysiological effects and was <b>antifibrillatory.</b> Simulated pharmacological blockade of IKv,fb successfully terminated reentry under otherwise profibrillatory conditions. We conclude that HF induces fibroblast ion-current remodeling with IKv,fb downregulation and IKir,fb upregulation, and that, assuming cardiomyocyte-fibroblast electrical coupling, this remodeling has a potentially important effect on atrial electrophysiology and arrhythmogenesis, with the overall response depending on the balance of pro- and <b>antifibrillatory</b> contributions.

40|$|Background: Omega- 3 {{polyunsaturated}} {{fatty acids}} in fish oils may have <b>antifibrillatory</b> effects. Their {{mechanism of action}} in humans is poorly understood. Objective: The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the effects of chronic fish oil supplementation on human atrial electrophysiology (EP). Methods: Two groups of patients without clinical AF or structural heart disease and fish intake ≤ 1 /week were prospectively recruited into a control group (n = 30) and a fish oil group (n = 31). The latter were prescribed 6 g/day of fish oil for ≥ 1 month before an EP study. The following were compared at time of EP study: serum omega- 3 levels; right atrial and coronary sinus effective refractory periods (ERPs); interatrial, intra-atrial, left atrial, and coronary sinus conduction at baseline and the maximal conduction delay with the shortest propagated extrastimulus; and inducibility of AF (10 nductions/patient). Results: The following significant differences were noted favoring the fish oil group at time of EP: (1) twofold higher total omega- 3 levels (P <. 001); (2) lengthening of ERPs by 8 %– 14 % at all measured sites and pacing cycle lengths (P <. 05); (3) no effect on baseline interatrial, intra-atrial, left atrial, and coronary sinus conduction but a significant attenuation of maximal conduction delay (P <. 05); (4) less inducible AF (AF ≥ 30 seconds: 24. 2 % vs. 7. 9 %; P <. 001); (5) shorter mean duration of induced AF (P =. 003); and (6) prolongation of induced AF cycle length (P <. 001).

40|$|Ventricular {{fibrillation}} is {{the leading}} cause of sudden cardiac death. In fibrillation, fragmented electrical waves meander erratically through the heart muscle, creating disordered and ineffective contraction. Theoretical and computer studies, as well as recent experimental evidence, have suggested that fibrillation is created and sustained by the property of restitution of the cardiac action potential duration (that is, its dependence on the previous diastolic interval). The restitution hypothesis states that steeply sloped restitution curves create unstable wave propagation that results in wave break, the event that is necessary for fibrillation. Here we present experimental evidence supporting this idea. In particular, we identify the action of the drug bretylium as a prototype for the future development of effective restitution-based <b>antifibrillatory</b> agents.

40|$|Experimental {{evidence}} suggests {{a number of}} pathologic and electrophysiologic mechanisms that may help initiate ventricular arrhythmias accompanying myocardial ischemia and infarction. Early and late phase events are associated with reentry or an enhancement of focal mechanisms, or both. These can initiate ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF), or both. The presence of distinct mechanisms that may initiate and maintain life-threatening dysrhythmias early in myocardial ischemia suggest different pharmacologic approaches for their prevention or suppression. Another consideration concerns patients subjected to coronary artery angioplasty or thrombolytic therapy {{and the development of}} arrhythmias associated with reperfusion of the once ischemic myocardium. The electrophysiologic mechanisms associated with reperfusion arrhythmias are unknown, and little is known about appropriate therapy for each episode of cardiac dysrhythmia. Ventricular extrasystoles or VT usually precedes VF. These premonitory arrhythmias are poor criteria for the institution of antiarrhythmic drug therapy, because VF develops within 1 to 10 minutes after the appearance of the rhythmic disturbances. Some authorities suggest that all patients with acute myocardial infarction should receive prophylactic antiarrhythmic therapy, because warning arrhythmias either do not occur at all or provide insufficient time to intervene pharmacologically. Many of the new class 1 antiarrhythmic agents effectively reduce the frequency of premature ventricular depolarizations, but lack specific antiflbrillatory activity. However, the recent introduction of bretylium into clinical cardiology opens a new approach to preventing life-threatening ventricular dysrhythmias. Along with other members of class III, bretylium exerts different cardiac electrophysiologic effects than do the other 3 classes of drugs. Bretylium has been designated as class III because it increases the action potential duration and prolongs the effective refractory period. The other class III drugs, including amiodarone, sotalol, clofilium and pranolium, experimentally prevent the establishment of a reentry pathway that can initiate VF. Bretylium along with these other class III agents is primarily <b>antifibrillatory</b> rather than antiarrhythmic. Thus, antiarrhythmic agents that reduce the frequency and complexity of premature ventricular depolarizations are not necessarily <b>antifibrillatory.</b> It is necessary to reorient our thinking about how pharmacologic interventions may influence the course of events in patients at risk of developing life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Because the lethal event is most often associated with VF, it may be sufficient to have an agent that protects against this electrophysiologic disorder even though it does not completely prevent or suppress other ventricular arrhythmias...|$|E

40|$|Background Prolonged {{periods of}} atrial {{fibrillation}} or rapid atrial pacing induce shortening of the atrial {{effective refractory period}} (AERP), which {{is thought to be}} related to the lower success rates of various <b>antifibrillatory</b> treatments when the arrhythmia has lasted for a longer period of time. Methods and Results To investigate whether an increase in intracellular calcium could be the stimulus for electrical remodeling, the effects of verapamil on shortening of the AERP in response to 24 hours of rapid atrial pacing (300 bpm) were studied in five chronically instrumented conscious goats during infusion of saline or verapamil. During rapid atrial pacing, the ventricular rate was kept constant by ventricular pacing (150 bpm). The AERP was measured by programmed electrical stimulation at basic cycle lengths of 430, 300, and 200 ms. Verapamil had no effects on the AERP before rapid atrial pacing. However, in the course of 24 hours of rapid atrial pacing, the AERP shortened significantly less (27 % to 58 %) in the presence of verapamil compared with control (at 430, 300, and 200 ms, P Conclusions Electrical remodeling of the atrium during rapid atrial pacing was significantly attenuated by verapamil. This suggests that electrical remodeling of the atrium is triggered by the high calcium influx during rapid atrial pacing rates...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe L-type Ca current (ICa,L), {{essential}} for normal cardiac function, also regulates dynamic action potential (AP) properties that promote ventricular fibrillation. Blocking ICa,L can prevent ventricular fibrillation, {{but only at}} levels suppressing contractility. We speculated that, instead of blocking ICa,L, modifying its shape by altering kinetic features could produce equivalent anti-fibrillatory effects without depressing contractility. To test this concept experimentally, we overexpressed a mutant Ca-insensitive calmodulin (CaM 1234) in rabbit ventricular myocytes to inhibit Ca-dependent ICa,L inactivation, combined with the ATP-sensitive K current agonist pinacidil or ICa,L blocker verapamil to maintain AP duration (APD) near control levels. Cell shortening was enhanced in pinacidil-treated myocytes, but depressed in verapamil-treated myocytes. Both combinations flattened APD restitution slope and prevented APD alternans, similar to ICa,L blockade. To predict the arrhythmogenic consequences, we simulated the cellular effects using a new AP model, which reproduced flattening of APD restitution slope and prevention of APD/Cai transient alternans but maintained a normal Cai transient. In simulated two-dimensional cardiac tissue, these changes prevented the arrhythmogenic spatially discordant APD/Cai transient alternans and spiral wave breakup. These findings provide a proof-of-concept test that ICa,L can be targeted to increase dynamic wave stability without depressing contractility, which may have promise as an <b>antifibrillatory</b> strategy...|$|E
40|$|In {{ventricular}} fibrillation (VF), the principal cause of sudden cardiac death, waves of electrical excitation break up into turbulent and incoherent fragments. The causes of this breakup have been intensely debated. Breakup {{can be caused}} by fixed anatomical properties of the tissue, such as the biventricular geometry and the inherent anisotropy of cardiac conduction. However, wavebreak can also be caused purely by instabilities in wave conduction that arise from ion channel dynamics, which represent potential targets for drug action. To study the interaction between these two wave-breaking mechanisms, we used a physiologically based mathematical model of the ventricular cell, together with a realistic three-dimensional computer model of cardiac anatomy, including the distribution of fiber angles throughout the myocardium. We find that dynamical instabilities remain a major cause of the wavebreak that drives VF, even in an anatomically realistic heart. With cell physiology in its usual operating regime, dynamics and anatomical features interact to promote wavebreak and VF. However, if dynamical instability is reduced, for example by modeling of certain pharmacologic interventions, electrical waves do not break up into fibrillation, despite anatomical complexity. Thus, interventions that promote dynamical wave stability show promise as an <b>antifibrillatory</b> strategy in this more realistic setting...|$|E

40|$|Every {{heartbeat}} is {{preceded by}} an electrical wave of excitation that rapidly propagates through the cardiac muscle, triggering mechanical contractions of cardiac myocytes. Abnormal propagation of this wave causes severe cardiac arrhythmias. The most dangerous {{of these is}} ventricular fibrillation, {{the leading cause of}} sudden death in the industrialized world. It is well established that ventricular fibrillation is a result of turbulent propagation of the electrical excitation wave. However, despite more than a century of investigation, the precise mechanism of its initiation and maintenance remains largely unknown. Novel experimental tools for the visualization of the excitation wave as well as advanced three-dimensional computer models of the heart, which have become available in recent years, have intensified attempts to solve the puzzle of ventricular fibrillation. These efforts have revealed significantly different manifestations of ventricular fibrillation, suggesting that multiple mechanisms are responsible for this arrhythmia. Several new hypotheses have been put forward recently that deviate considerably from Moe’s standard hypothesis of fibrillation, which has dominated the field for almost four decades. One of the hypotheses that has been most actively discussed is the spiral-breakup (also called the restitution) hypothesis. This hypothesis may lead to a breakthrough in our understanding of the factors that cause this deadly arrhythmia and provide a constructive approach to the development of efficient <b>antifibrillatory</b> drugs...|$|E

Intimal injury and coronary thrombosis produced ST segment changes at 138 +/- 39 minutes ([chi] +/- SEM), followed by premature ventricular beats (at 142 +/- 37 minutes), ventricular tachycardia (at 156 +/- 49 minutes), and ventricular fibrillation (at 163 +/- 51 minutes) in 9 of 10 saline-treated animals. In bretylium-treated animals, ST segment changes appeared at 128 +/- 35 minutes, with six animals surviving for 24 hours (p < 0. 03 vs saline).
