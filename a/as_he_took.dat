5|$|On Monday, 26 August, Gloucestershire met Lancashire {{again at}} the Clifton College Close Ground and, despite another good innings by Hornby, Gloucestershire this time were victorious by 8 wickets. Grace had won the toss and put Lancashire in to bat first. Grace the bowler was once more the star {{performer}} <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> 7–77 and 5–32, {{but this time he}} did well with the bat and made a good 49 in difficult conditions. His brother Fred scored 73 not out and this was crucial to the Gloucestershire success. Grace scored 20 not out in the second innings as Gloucestershire made 32–2 to win.|$|E
5|$|As soon <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> office, Meyszner {{embarked}} on a thorough re-organisation of all police operations in the occupied territory. He created four police area commands, aligned to the four military area commands, and ten police districts, corresponding to the military district commands. He took under his command {{the forces of the}} Serbian puppet government, known as the Serbian State Guard, and also established a number of auxiliary and volunteer police units across the whole territory. One of the units controlled by Meyszner was the Auxiliary Police Troop, recruited from Russian Volksdeutsche from the occupied territory but also from Croatia, Bulgaria, Greece and Romania and trained by the Orpo. It was planned to reach a strength of 400 men but little is known about its activities.|$|E

5|$|Cooper {{appeared}} in four films in 2012, including the critically acclaimed The Place Beyond the Pines and Silver Linings Playbook. His {{performance in the}} latter in particular was widely praised, and earned him nomination for an Academy Award for Best Actor, among other awards. Cooper's profile continued to expand <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> on major roles in several successful films—American Hustle (2013), Guardians of the Galaxy, and American Sniper (both in 2014). After receiving Academy Award nominations for American Hustle and American Sniper, he became the tenth actor in history to receive an Academy Award nomination in three consecutive years. Cooper returned to stage work for a 2014 Broadway production of The Elephant Man, where he played the severely deformed Joseph Merrick. His performance drew praise from critics, and earned him a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play. None of his 2015 films—Aloha, Burnt, or Joy—performed particularly well at the box office. In 2016, he {{appeared in}} the comedy drama War Dogs that he also co-produced under his and Philips' production company, Joint Effort.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{dissolution}} of Netley, on 3 August 1536, King Henry granted the abbey buildings {{and some of its}} estates to Sir William Paulet, his Lord Treasurer and subsequently Marquess of Winchester. As soon <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> over, Sir William started the process of turning the abbey into a palace suitable {{for one of the most}} important politicians in England. He converted the nave of the church into his great hall, kitchens and service buildings, the transepts and crossing became a series of luxurious apartments for his personal use, the presbytery was retained as the chapel of the mansion. The monks' dormitory became the long gallery of the mansion and the latrine block became several grand chambers. He demolished the south range and refectory and built a new one with a central turreted gatehouse to provide the appropriate seigneurial emphasis needed for a classic Tudor courtyard house. He likewise demolished the cloister walks to make a central courtyard for his house and placed a large fountain in the centre. The precinct buildings were demolished to create formal gardens and terraces.|$|E
5|$|Grant {{continued}} his coaching {{success in the}} NFL <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> over from original coach, Norm Van Brocklin. Over his tenure as Vikings head coach, Grant was known for instilling discipline in his teams and displaying a lack of emotion during games. He believed that football is a game of controlled emotion and teams would not follow the coach's lead {{if he were to}} panic or lose his poise {{during the course of a}} game. He required his team to stand at attention in a straight line during the entire national anthem played before the game and even had national anthem practice. Grant required outdoor practice during the winter to get players used to the cold weather and would not allow heaters on the sidelines during games.|$|E

5|$|His career ended unhappily on Australia's {{first ever}} tour to the West Indies. He took match figures of 2/126 in the First Test in Kingston, Jamaica in a high-scoring win. These {{were to be}} his last Test wickets <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> a total of 0/60 in the Second Test in Trinidad. He was {{retained}} for the Third Test but injured himself early in the match while fielding and neither batted nor bowled. He was injured for the next month and missed the Fourth Test but returned for the Fifth. Early {{on the first day}} he suffered yet another knee injury as he changed direction while attempting to catch a Clyde Walcott pull shot. His teammates Alan Davidson and Peter Burge removed a bench from the dressing room wall and used it as an improvised stretcher to carry Johnston from the ground; his Test career ended without bowling or batting in either of his last two matches. His final Test wicket had been that of Glendon Gibbs in the second innings of the First Test. In six first-class matches for the tour, he managed only nine wickets at 51.00.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Lesnar {{pursued a}} career in mixed martial arts (MMA), as he signed with Hero's and won his first fight, against Min-Soo Kim, in June 2007. He then signed with the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) the {{following}} October. Lesnar lost in his UFC debut against Frank Mir and then won his second fight against Heath Herring. In November 2008, Lesnar defeated Randy Couture to become the UFC Heavyweight Champion. Shortly after a successful title defense in a rematch with Mir, Lesnar was sidelined due to diverticulitis. He would return at UFC 116 to defeat Interim UFC Heavyweight Champion Shane Carwin and unify the heavyweight championships, becoming the undisputed UFC Heavyweight Champion in the process. Lesnar then lost the championship to Cain Velasquez at UFC 121. In 2011, he was once again sidelined due to diverticulitis and underwent surgery. Lesnar returned at UFC 141 in December, losing to Alistair Overeem and promptly retiring from MMA. Lesnar was a box office sensation in UFC, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> part in a {{some of the best}} selling pay-per-view events in UFC history, including UFC 100 and UFC 116.|$|E
5|$|Matt Damon is an American actor, {{producer}} and screenwriter. He made his screen debut {{at the age}} of 18 with a minor role in the 1988 film Mystic Pizza. After appearing in a series of supporting parts in much of the 1990s, Damon was cast by Francis Ford Coppola as the lead of the 1997 legal drama The Rainmaker. His breakthrough came later that year when he played the title role of an unrecognized genius in Good Will Hunting, a drama which he also co-wrote with Ben Affleck. Damon and Affleck won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and Damon was nominated for Best Actor. He followed it by playing the title roles of a soldier in Steven Spielberg's war drama Saving Private Ryan (1998) and of the criminal Tom Ripley in the thriller The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), both of which gained critical and commercial success. Damon's profile continued to expand in the 2000s, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> on starring roles in two lucrative film franchises. He featured as a con man in Steven Soderbergh's Ocean's Trilogy (2001–07) and played the titular spy Jason Bourne in four of the five films in the Bourne series (2002–16).|$|E

5|$|On {{the evening}} of 22 July, she was {{flagship}} of Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt, commander of the Harwich Force, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> Carysfort, her half-sister , and eight destroyers to sea to patrol the sea lanes between Felixstowe and the Dutch coast. He split his forces to cover the two routes involved and encountered three German torpedo boats en route to attack merchant shipping in that area around 01:15 of the following morning. Hampered by an inopportune rain squall and a German smoke screen, Tyrwhitt's ships were only able to engage the Germans {{for a short time}} before they disengaged. Tyrwhitt then ordered Canterbury and her escort to intercept the fleeing Germans; they spotted six torpedo boats about a half-hour later and opened fire at 02:02. Visibility was poor because of another smoke screen laid by the Germans and the British ships were forced to disengage without inflicting any damage at 02:25 as they were approaching a minefield.|$|E
5|$|The Carnival of the Animals, Finale was {{directed}} by Goldberg; his wife Susan was its art director. The idea originated from animator Joe Grant, {{one of the two}} story directors on Fantasia who loved the ostriches in Dance of the Hours. When development for Fantasia 2000 began, Grant suggested the idea of having one of the ostriches play with a yo-yo to the last movement of The Carnival of the Animals. The ostriches were later changed to flamingos as Disney wished to avoid reintroducing characters from the original film and thought flamingos would look more colorful on the screen. Goldberg was partly inspired by co-director Mike Gabriel, who would play with a yo-yo <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> a break from working on Pocahontas (1995). The segment was produced with CGI and 6,000 watercolor paintings on heavy bond paper.|$|E
5|$|The castle's {{design was}} unsatisfactory, as its guns {{could not be}} angled so to fire down into the harbour, and its defences were {{considered}} vulnerable to attack. To mitigate this, an additional blockhouse was probably constructed below, closer to the water, but eventually a new fortification, the Star Castle, was built instead on the neighbouring island of St Mary's, which became the main fort in the Scilly Isles. In {{the aftermath of the}} English Civil War, the Scilly Isles were held by the Royalist sympathisers of King Charles I, who gave the castle its current name. The islands were then attacked by a Parliamentary force led by Sir Robert Blake in 1651, who landed on Tresco but bypassed the fort <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> the island. Its Royalist defenders blew up parts of the castle as they left, and some of its stone appears to have been used to build the newer Cromwell's Castle by the harbour.|$|E

5|$|After their stint on Someone Like Me, Carey and Helford {{developed}} and produced the storyline for The Drew Carey Show. The sitcom revolved around a fictionalized version of Carey, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> on {{the stresses of}} life and work with his group of childhood friends. The show premiered on September 13, 1995 on ABC. In his autobiography, Carey revealed his frustration with {{having to deal with}} censors and being unable to employ the off-color humor common in his stand-up routines. Carey initially earned $60,000 per episode in the first seasons, then renegotiated for $300,000. By the final season, he was earning $750,000 per episode. The show had high ratings for its first few seasons, but declining ratings and increasing production costs (around $3 million per episode) precipitated its cancellation. The program had a total of 233 episodes over its nine-year run, and Carey was one of four actors to appear in every episode. The show starred (in order of episode appearances) Carey, Diedrich Bader, Kathy Kinney, Ryan Stiles (all in every episode); Craig Ferguson (starring role in seasons 2–8 and guest appearances in 9); Christa Miller (seasons 1–7); and Ian Gomez (semi-regular from seasons 1–9) and John Carroll Lynch (semi-regular from seasons 3–9).|$|E
5|$|Just a {{year later}} he again moved, {{becoming}} full captain on the 15,000-ton liner SS Minnedosa – an older ship that transported immigrants to Canada. Stuart was {{one of a number of}} Royal Naval Reserve officers employed by Canadian Pacific, part of a deliberate recruitment policy by the company. In 1929, he was given his biggest command yet <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> over the newly completed 20,000-ton ocean liner SS Duchess of York. He commanded her for five years along her route from Liverpool to Saint John, New Brunswick stopping at Belfast and Greenock. He also briefly commanded her on the New York City to Bermuda route. It was during this period, in 1929, that he was awarded the Decoration for Officers of the Royal Naval Reserve (RD) in honour of his long service and in 1935 he was made a full Naval Reserve Captain. He maintained his connection with the RNR throughout his life, becoming Honorary President of the RNR Officer's Club and a part-time naval aide-de-camp to King George VI in 1941 – a position he held part-time throughout World War II. A special warrant was written in 1927 that allowed him to fly the Blue Ensign from any ship, mercantile or military, which he commanded.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was the Steel cage {{match for the}} WWE Championship between Triple H and Randy Orton. During the {{beginning}} of the match, Triple H gained the advantage over Orton, as he performed a High Knee on Orton. Orton came back with a kick to the gut before starting his prolonged attack and attempting to escape through the cage door but Triple H prevented him from escaping. Triple H took control <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>took</b> out Orton's knee with a chop block and applied a figure four leglock. After Orton broke the hold, he crawled across to the cage door to escape, but Triple H grabbed him back inside. But, on the way back in, Orton managed to grab a steel chair that was on the ring floor. Orton tried to hit Triple H with the chair, but Triple H managed to avoid being hit. Triple H grabbed the chair to hit Orton with it, but Orton hit him in the groin. Orton followed this with a chair shot to Triple H's back and performed a DDT. Throughout the match, Orton tried escaping from the cage, but was not in successful in doing so, as Triple H dragged him back in each time. The match came to an end when Orton tried to execute a running punt on Triple H's head, however, Triple H grabbed the chair and hit Orton with it. Triple H followed up by executing a pedigree. Triple H covered Orton for the pinfall victory, and thus retaining his title.|$|E
