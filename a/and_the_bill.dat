Located in three buildings on Capitol Hill, the Library of Congress {{is the largest}} library complex {{in the world with}} a collection of over 147million books, manuscripts, and other materials. The United States Supreme Court Building was completed in 1935; before then, the court held sessions in the Old Senate Chamber of the Capitol.|$|E
5|$|The bill {{then passed}} {{to a third}} reading in the House of Lords, where {{it took a few}} minor amendments, but escaped any {{significant}} opposition barring a brief dispute over the status of Cadet units; it was eventually agreed that they could be supported by the associations provided that no funding was to be provided from money voted by Parliament. This amendment was accepted by the Government, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> passed smoothly to royal assent.|$|E

The head is surrounded by a broad yellow collar that includes the chin. The remainder of the female breeding plumage is identical to the male's.|$|E

5|$|A {{relatively}} small swallow, the nominate subspecies has bronze upperparts and bronze {{sides of the}} head. The ears and lores are duller and the forehead area is more green than bronze. The shoulders, back, rump, and uppertail-coverts are, on the other hand, a coppery-bronze colour. The lesser and median coverts are more coppery, with the greater and primary-wing-coverts being more of a dusky green. The primaries, secondaries, and tail are a dusky bronze-green. The underparts are mostly white. The legs, feet, and irides are dark brown, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> is black. The female is similar but with a mottled grey-brown breast and occasionally throat and undertail-coverts. The juvenile is also mottled-grey brown, in addition to it being duller overall. The extant subspecies, T. e. sclateri, is primarily differentiated by its more deeply forked tail, blue-green forehead and uppertail-coverts, and blue-black wings and tail.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Beauregard was {{reluctant}} to seek amnesty as a former Confederate officer by publicly swearing an oath of loyalty, but both Lee and Johnston counseled him to do so, which he did before the mayor of New Orleans on September 16, 1865. He {{was one of many}} Confederate officers issued a mass pardon by President Andrew Johnson on July 4, 1868. His final privilege as an American citizen, the right to run for public office, was restored when he petitioned the Congress for relief <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> on his behalf was signed by President Grant on July 24, 1876.|$|E
5|$|As it is near several film studios {{including}} those at Pinewood, the airfield {{has been used}} to represent outside locations in a number of feature films. Scenes of the James Bond films Goldfinger, Thunderball and Octopussy were all filmed at Northolt, and station personnel served as extras in the Octopussy hangar fly-through stunt scene. The mini-series The Winds of War <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Bill</b> and the BBC shows Waking the Dead, Doctor Who and Red Dwarf have all used Northolt to represent various fictional airfields. In early 2010 the station was used for action scenes in the final episode of the BBC's final series of Ashes to Ashes.|$|E
5|$|Bhardwaj's {{next project}} was the children's film, The Blue Umbrella (2005), based on Ruskin Bond's {{novel of the}} same name. It won the National Film Award for Best Children's Film in 2005. His followup was Blood Brothers (2007), a short-film on HIV/AIDS, with a run time of 13 minutes.

A week later the full committee, after adding an amendment by Faleomavaega requiring that fins {{be attached to the}} carcasses, sent the bill to the full House. In July it was passed by voice vote and referred to the Senate, where it was sponsored by John Kerry of Massachusetts. It was read twice and referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. No further action was taken before the 110th Congress adjourned, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> died.|$|E
5|$|On April 29, {{the last}} day of the {{legislative}} session, the Senate bill was revived in the Hawaii House following a motion by Majority Leader Blake Oshiro. Speaker Calvin Say immediately ordered a recess and after the representatives returned four votes to suspend legislative rules postponing the issue were taken <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> passed with 31 to 20 votes. Governor Linda Lingle had until July 6 to decide whether to sign or veto the measure. The House vote margin in support is not large enough to override a gubernatorial veto. Lingle vetoed the bill on July 6, arguing civil unions should be decided by referendum. The House had ruled out any attempt to override her vetoes for the legislative session.|$|E
5|$|Sir William Blackstone {{published}} a critical {{edition of the}} 1215 Charter in 1759, and gave it the numbering system still used today. In 1763, Member of Parliament John Wilkes was arrested for writing an inflammatory pamphlet, No. 45, 23 April 1763; he cited Magna Carta continually. Lord Camden denounced the treatment of Wilkes as a contravention of Magna Carta. Thomas Paine, in his Rights of Man, would disregard Magna Carta <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> of Rights {{on the grounds that}} they were not a written constitution devised by elected representatives.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Buffalo <b>Bills</b> (12-2) of <b>the</b> Eastern Division {{hosted the}} {{defending}} AFL champion San Diego Chargers (8-5-1) of the Western Division. The two had met twice in <b>the</b> regular season <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> won both, most recently by three points in San Diego {{a month earlier}} on Thanksgiving Day. Hall of fame wide receiver Lance Alworth of the Chargers was injured in the final regular season game (left knee hyperextension) and did not play. The Chargers had lost three of their last four games to end <b>the</b> regular season, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bills</b> were slight favorites to win the title at home; with Alworth out they became strong favorites.|$|R
5|$|The Hunting Bill was {{introduced}} {{as part of}} Labour’s 2001 general election manifesto pledge to hold a free vote on banning fox hunting and would make it illegal to hunt wild animals in England and Wales with dogs except in limited circumstances. The bill {{was passed by the}} House of Commons on 3 December 2002 but rejected by the House of Lords. It was reintroduced to, and passed by, the House of Commons on 9 September 2004, but was significantly amended by the House of Lords. The House of Commons rejected the amendments on 18 November <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> was granted Royal Assent later that day through the use of the Parliament Acts. The Hunting Act was due to come into force on 18 February 2005.|$|E
5|$|When a {{rebellion}} {{broke out in}} India in 1857, Disraeli took {{a keen interest in}} affairs, having been a member of a select committee in 1852 which considered how best to rule the subcontinent, and had proposed eliminating the governing role of the British East India Company. After peace was restored, and Palmerston in early 1858 brought in legislation for direct rule of India by the Crown, Disraeli opposed it. Many Conservative MPs refused to follow him <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> passed the Commons easily.|$|E
5|$|As he had as {{governor}} of Kentucky, Ford gave attention to improving the efficiency of government. While serving on the Joint Committee on Printing during the One Hundred First and One Hundred Third Congresses, he saved the government {{millions of dollars in}} printing costs by printing in volume and using recycled paper. In 1998, Virginia senator John Warner sponsored the Wendell H. Ford Government Publications Reform Act of 1998; Ford signed on as a co-sponsor. The bill would have eliminated the Joint Committee on Printing, distributing its authority and functions among the Senate Rules Committee, the House Oversight Committee, and the administrator of the Government Printing Office. It would also have centralized government printing services and penalized government agencies who did not make their documents available to the printing office to be printed. Opponents of the bill cited the broad powers granted to the printing office and concerns about the erosion of copyright protection. The bill was reported favorably out of committee, but was squeezed from the legislative calendar by issues related to the impending impeachment of Bill Clinton. Warner did not return to his chairmanship of the Joint Committee on Printing in the next congress, Ford retired from the Senate, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> was not re-introduced.|$|E
