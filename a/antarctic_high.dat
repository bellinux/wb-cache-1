40|$|Numerous ice core {{records are}} now {{available}} that cover the Last Glacial cycle both in Greenland and in Antarctica. Recent developments in coherent ice core chronologies now enable us to depict with a precision of a few centuries the relationship between climate records in Greenland and Antarctica over the millennial scale variability of the Last Glacial period. Stacks of Greenland and Antarctic water isotopic records nicely illustrate a seesaw pattern with the abrupt warming in Greenland being concomitant {{with the beginning of}} the cooling in Antarctica at the Antarctic Isotopic Maximum (AIM). In addition, from the precise estimate of chronological error bars and additional high resolution measurements performed on the EDC and TALDICE ice cores, we show that the seesaw pattern does not explain the regional variability in Antarctic records with clear two step structures occurring during the warming phase of AIM 8 and 12. Our <b>Antarctic</b> <b>high</b> resolution data also suggest possible teleconnections between changes in low latitude atmospheric circulation and Antarctic without any Greenland temperature fingerprint...|$|E

40|$|Benthic {{communities}} in several fjords and sheltered bays {{of the north}} coast of South Georgia Island were examined using SCUBA and shore sampling in November 2004. It {{is one of the}} most northerly islands within the Polar Front and its well studied, terrestrial biota is described as sub Antarctic. The intertidal and subtidal zones and their fauna are, by comparison, little known. We describe the composition of the substratum and benthic communities of sites in several northern bays, including an exceptional community in the extremely sheltered Moraine Fjord with a 2 m sill at its entrance. In this, like those in some other fjordic systems, some taxa occur shallower than elsewhere, and in this instance, get large and are probably old. Elsewhere, we found the coastal fauna was fairly similar to Antarctic shallow {{communities in}} the southern Scotia Arc and Peninsula region. Of the taxa we found, we identified 53 to genus and 41 to species. Most of these were typical Antarctic shallow benthic taxa. Certain flatworms, nemerteans, bivalve and gastropod molluscs, amphipod and isopod crustaceans, asteroid echinoderms and stalked ascidians were very abundant, but some normally common <b>Antarctic</b> <b>higher</b> taxa and species were notably absent or rare...|$|R

To study the exchange of CO 2 between sea ice and the atmosphere as well as the biogeochemical parameters and the spatial and temporal distribution of ikaite in sea ice during different seasons, three field studies were conducted in the Arctic and <b>Antarctic.</b> <b>High</b> pCO 2 values in sea ice of up to 3900 &# 956;atm were observed. The resulting fluxes ranged between - 3. 41 and 9. 5 mmol m- 2 d- 1. Ikaite was found mostly in the uppermost layers of sea ice.

40|$|Glacial meltwaters {{draining}} shield bedrock {{under the}} Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) contain < 0. 4 ?m “total dissolved” Fe (TDFe) {{with an average}} flow weighted concentration of ? 53 nM. The concentrations of < 0. 03 and 0. 03 – 0. 4 ?m Fe vary over the ablation period, with weighted means {{for each of these}} fractions being respectively 22. 4 nM and 30. 8 nM. These concentrations are lower estimates as an adjacent larger glacier (a more representative source of glacial meltwater) had higher dissolved Fe concentrations, and reactions of meltwaters with proglacial sediments could also enhance dissolved Fe concentrations. This source of TDFe is additional to the reactive (oxyhydr) oxide phases identified by Raiswell et al. (2006) that are also introduced to adjacent polar seas from glaciers. The Fe concentrations in the shield bedrock underlying the GIS are lower than those of other crustal rocks (4. 0 % cf. 6. 2 %), but we argue that these Fe concentrations are not limiting on the total dissolved Fe concentrations we measure. The biogeochemical weathering processes operating on the subglacial debris and suspended sediment in our catchment are likely to be similar to those in other glaciated catchments. Therefore the meltwater Fe concentrations reported here can be used to give a first estimate of global fluxes of meltwater dissolved Fe to coastal polar waters. A lower estimate of the global flux of TDFe from glacial meltwaters is ? 75 × 106 moles Fe/a. This glacial meltwater input of Fe to adjacent polar waters will be greatest around Greenland where there are highest annual meltwater discharges. However, the greatest impact of this source of glacial meltwater Fe is anticipated to be in <b>Antarctic</b> <b>high</b> nutrient low chlorophyll (HNLC) waters where phytoplankton productivity is typically limited by availability of Fe. For Antarctic waters the estimated meltwater Fe (TDFe) input is about 10 % of that suggested to come from sea ice melting, but glacial inputs continue throughout the austral summer ablation period after sea ice melt is complete. <br/...|$|E

The <b>high</b> <b>Antarctic</b> plateau may provide appropriate conditions to perform such a survey from the ground. Aims: We investigate the performance of a nulling interferometer optimised for the detection of exozodiacal discs at Dome C, on the <b>high</b> <b>Antarctic</b> plateau, and compare it to the expected performance of similar instruments at temperate sites. Methods: Based on the currently available measurements of the atmospheric turbulence characteristics at Dome C, we adapt the GENIEsim software (Absil et al. 2006, A&A, 448, 787) to simulate the performance of a nulling interferometer on the <b>high</b> <b>Antarctic</b> plateau. To feed a realistic instrumental configuration into the simulator, we propose a conceptual design for ALADDIN, the Antarctic L-band Astrophysics Discovery Demonstrator for Interferometric Nulling. We assume that this instrument can be placed above the 30 -m thick boundary layer, where most of the atmospheric turbulence originates. Results: We show that an optimised nulling interferometer operating on a pair of 1 -m class telescopes located 30 m above the ground could achieve a better sensitivity than a similar instrument working with two 8 -m class telescopes at a temperate site such as Cerro Paranal. The detection of circumstellar discs about 20 times as dense as our local zodiacal cloud seems within reach for typical Darwin/TPF targets in an integration time of a few hours. Moreover, the exceptional turbulence conditions significantly relax the requirements on real-time control loops, which has favourable consequences on the feasibility of the nulling instrument.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{oxidative}} profile of gills of two limpet species (Nacella (Patinigera) magellanica and Nacella (Patinigera) deaurata) (Gmelin, 1971) exposed to different environmental conditions. Due to the tidal characteristics of the Beagle Channel, N. magellanica are exposed to air twice daily for 3 to 5 hours each time, whereas N. deaurata are exposed to air for 3 hours only during spring tides. The different regime of exposure includes extreme temperatures under 0 ºC during winter and more than 20 °C in summer for N. magellanica, whereas N. deaurata are usually covered by more than 0. 3 m of water at 4 °C in winter and 11 °C in summer. No {{significant differences were found}} between the two molluscs regarding the oxygen uptake, the content of ?-tocopherol and ?-carotene and the activities of the antioxidant enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase. Lipid peroxidation in gills was estimated as the content of lipid radicals, assessed by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Lipid radical content and total iron content were respectively 80. 6 and 62 % lower in N. magellanica than in N. deaurata. A typical EPR spectrum of ascorbyl radical in gills from both limpets was observed. Both the ascorbyl radical content and the ascorbyl radical content/ascorbate content ratio were significantly lower in N. magellanica than in N. deaurata. In the Antarctic Nacella concinna inhabits all levels of the littoral zone. Limpets at the highest level in the intertidal showed significantly increased activities of both catalase and superoxide dismutase as compared to their intertidal and subtidal relatives. Thus, it seems that <b>Antarctic</b> <b>high</b> intertidal conditions, involving regular exposure to air and presumably also thermal stress on sunny days during the Antarctic summer, cause a necessity for N. concinna to ward off higher oxygen radical species production by increasing its antioxidant defence. Taken as a whole, the data presented here indicate that coping with environmentally demanding conditions requires a complex adjustment of the physiological metabolic pathways to ensure survival by minimising intracellular damage...|$|E

The first three species were very common on the Weddell Sea shelf and upper slope, whereas {{only a few}} individuals {{of the other two}} species were caught-but these did include some ovigerous females. Our measurements include size at first maturity, fecundity (total number and mass of eggs), individual egg mass, egg length, ovary indices, maximum size encountered and documentation of the reproductive cycle in spring and summer. Egg number generally increases with female size, and the largest species (N. lanceopes) also carries the highest number of eggs.

Using 36 of 57 nominal species described in this area, the degree of endemism has been decreased from 70 % to 31 %. Very close faunistic relationships to northern Argentina are evident as five of six known species (83 %) are shared with the Magellan Province. With a 43 % overlap of Magellan species {{in the southern part of}} the Peruvian faunal Province (44 species), this area shows a transitional character between cold- and warm-temperate waters. Only three of 36 Magellan species are found in common with the <b>high</b> <b>Antarctic</b> (ca. 30 species), revealing a low faunal similarity of about 10 %. <b>High</b> <b>Antarctic</b> waters are characterized by high nudibranch endemism (about 80 %). Of the ten nudibranch species reported from South Georgia, two are exclusively shared with Magellan, two with <b>high</b> <b>Antarctic</b> and three with both Magellan and Antarctic waters, indicating transitional, Subantarctic conditions. One species is endemic to South Georgia, two other species are insufficiently known and may or may not be endemic. Generally, the Antarctic Convergence appears to be a distributional barrier for Magellan nudibranchs. In contrast, some Antarctic nudibranch species extend far into the Atlantic, obviously with cold Antarctic deep water currents. Coastal, cold temperate Magellan nudibranchs have relatively low affinities to the deep water fauna off Argentina, which seems to be predominantly submerged Antarctic species, but this bathymetrical zonation needs to be further investigated...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{records of}} lithodid crabs in deeper waters off the Antarctic {{continental}} slope {{raised the question}} of the return of crabs to Antarctic waters, following their extinction in the lower Miocene about 15 million years ago. Antarctic cooling may be responsible for the impoverishment of the marine <b>high</b> <b>Antarctic</b> decapod fauna, presently comprising five shrimp species only. Effects of Polar conditions on marine life, including lowered metabolic rates and short seasonal food availability, were discussed as main evolutionary driving forces shaping Antarctic diversity. In particular planktotrophic larval stages should be vulnerable to the mismatch of prolonged development and short periods of food availability, selecting against complex life cycles. We hypothesise that larval lecithotrophy and cold-tolerance, as recently observed in Subantarctic lithodids, represent, together with other adaptations in the adults, key features among the life-history adaptations of lithodids, potentially enabling them to conquer polar ecosystems. The return of benthic top predators to <b>high</b> <b>Antarctic</b> waters under conditions of climate change would considerably alter the benthic communities...|$|R

40|$|During {{the late}} 1960 s, larvae of the flightless midge Eretmoptera murphyi Schaeffer were accidentally {{transferred}} from the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia to Signy Island in the maritime <b>Antarctic.</b> <b>Higher</b> insects are rare in the Antarctic and the introduction and establishment of a new species is an unusual event. The fly has overcome the two major barriers to colonization of the Antarctic by new species: the geographical isolation {{of the region and}} its severe climate. Larvae of the flightless midge overwinter in the surface layers of soil on Signy Island where the temperature may fall to below - 10 degrees C, compared with as little as - 1. 5 degrees C on South Georgia. This suggests the possession of a level of pre-adaption to colder conditions. Summer-collected larvae have a supercooling point (SCP or whole body freezing point) of approximately - 5. 0 degrees C but survive experimental exposure to - 13 degrees C, giving them a level of freeze tolerance. After acclimation at - 4 degrees C for 4 days, the SCP changes little but the temperature at which 50 % of the population would die decreases to lower than - 19 degrees C. Larvae are also resistant to dehydration. Under experimental conditions of 88 % relative humidity at 5 degrees C, larvae lose water linearly (0. 42 % h- 1) over the first 30 h but resist further water loss once their water content decreases to approximately 1. 4 g g- 1 dry weight.

By simulating the expected signal-to-noise for varying filter properties within the so-called 'K-DARK' 2. 4 mu m window, filter performance can be tuned and best-case designs are given covering a range of conditions...|$|R

On land, biomes are separated primarily by differences in latitude, height above sea level and humidity. Terrestrial biomes lying within the Arctic or <b>Antarctic</b> Circles, at <b>high</b> altitudes or in extremely arid areas are relatively barren of plant and animal life; species diversity reaches a peak in humid lowlands at equatorial latitudes.|$|R
