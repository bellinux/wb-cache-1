What has been decided by the people is more important than the will of the king unless the king's opinion seems to be the most reasonable one, whereupon they usually obey. During peacetime, they feel to be the king's equals but during wars they obey him blindly or whoever among them that he considers to be the most skillful. If the fortunes of war are against them they pray to one of their many gods (Æsir) and if they win they <b>are</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> him.|$|E

500|$|The program {{received}} a lukewarm reception from critics. Chris Willman from the Los Angeles Times said the program's title was misleading because [...] "it's {{hard to find}} anything the slightest bit untraditional about [...] ". Willman commended the 1960s influence reminiscent of her father's Christmas songs and said the special was [...] "a good-enough live video counterpart" [...] to the album with an obvious inclusion of 'The Christmas Song'". John J. O'Conner of The New York Times gave it a negative review, saying, [...] "a couple of new songs are forgettable" [...] and describing Cole's performance as [...] "sweetly, and somewhat lifelessly", and the production as unable to leave a lasting impression on the viewers. O'Connor also said Cole's rendition of [...] "The Christmas Song" [...] was {{the highlight of the}} show and, [...] "Ms. Cole once again dips in the repertory of her incomparable father". He compared the program to [...] "Perry Como's Irish Christmas" [...] and said both had [...] "the same lulling level". Following Cole's death on December 31, 2015, PBS released a statement saying [...] "we <b>are</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> have been able to capture [...] extraordinary artistry for generations to come" [...] through her Great Performances solo specials including her Christmas special.|$|E

2500|$|The worshipper bows at {{four points}} in the Amidah: at the {{beginning}} and end of both the first blessing of Avot and the second to last blessing of Hoda'ah. At the opening words of Avot and at the conclusion of both these blessings, when the one says [...] "Blessed are You, O Lord," [...] one bends one's knees at [...] "Blessed," [...] then bows at [...] "are You," [...] and straightens while saying [...] "O Lord." [...] The reason for this procedure is that the Hebrew word for [...] "blessed" [...] (baruch) is related to [...] "knee" [...] (berech); while the verse in Psalms states, [...] "The Lord straightens the bent." [...] At the beginning of Hoda'ah, one bows while saying the opening words [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> You" [...] without bending the knees. At each of these bows, one must bend over until the vertebrae protrude from one's back; one physically unable to do so suffices by nodding the head.|$|E
