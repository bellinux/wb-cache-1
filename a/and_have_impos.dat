40|$|IMPOS is an {{integrated}} material planning and operations scheduling methodology for discrete manufacturing systems. Details of <b>IMPOS</b> <b>have</b> been reported elsewhere; this paper emphasises the mathematical {{analysis of the}} operation lead times in IMPOS with some experimental results. It has been proven that the operation lead time is a variable parameter depending on the schedule as well as availability of resources. The calculated lead time of an operation is usually greater than its required lead time had it been the only operation scheduled. Two parameters of an operation which affect the deviations between these two lead times are the total times that the processing on the batch has been paused during the main and surplus processes (i. e. idle times) ...|$|R
40|$|In the past, many {{researchers}} {{have tried to}} automate the processes of feature correspondence and trajectory finding. In doing so, they have made restrictive assumptions such as the visibility of feature points {{in all of the}} frames. In addition, they have demonstrated their algorithms on sequences described by very few feature points. In this thesis, we propose a parallel distributed processing approach to the problems of feature correspondence and trajectory finding. We formulate both of these as energy minimization problems by incorporating into the energy function constraints such as geometrical similarity of the 2 [...] D arrangement of neighbors around the points considered for a match, continuity of 3 [...] D motion and 2 [...] D continuity of trajectories. A Hopfield network is then used to solve the energy minimization problem. The advantages in formulating the problem in this way are that the constraint that all the feature points must be visible in all of the frames doesn't <b>have</b> to be <b>impos</b> [...] ...|$|R
