5|$|Written by Gareth Roberts. Before {{settling}} {{upon the}} storyline {{that would become}} The Lodger, Roberts initially developed a different storyline for the 2010 series which would have featured a disgraced Sontaran called Strom. This idea reached draft stage before being abandoned altogether. However the idea of Strom was later recycled into Sontaran Commander Strax, who first appeared in <b>A</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Man</b> Goes to War and became a recurring character.|$|E
5|$|The first subplot {{involves}} the courtship of Mary Lowther, {{a childhood friend}} of the vicar's wife. Harry Gilmore, a Bullhampton squire {{and a friend of}} the Fenwicks, falls deeply in love with her. Mary recognises that Gilmore is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>man,</b> but she fears that she does not adore him as a woman should adore the man she marries. The Fenwicks and her guardian aunt all urge her to accept his proposal, telling her that the affection she does not now feel will come after marriage. In the face of this advice, she does not reject Gilmore outright, but asks for time to consider.|$|E
5|$|The court enmities {{provoked}} by his twenty years unbroken intimacy and influence with the king, and the denigration of less gifted or less fortunate soldiers, followed him in death. Prince William expressed {{the bitterness of}} his hatred in almost his last words, and Prince Henry's memoirs give a wholly incredible portrait of Winterfeldt's arrogance, dishonesty, immorality and incapacity. Frederick, however, was not apt to encourage incompetence in his most trusted officers, {{and as for the}} rest, Winterfeldt stood first among the very few to whom the king gave his friendship and his entire confidence. On hearing of Winterfeldt's death, he said, I will never ever find again another Winterfeldt,and a little later, He was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>man,</b> a soulful man; he was my friend. Winterfeldt's strength was thinking and acting strategically.|$|E

25|$|The stage {{adaptation}} of the concept album, entitled You're <b>a</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Man,</b> Charlie Brown, went into rehearsal in New York City on February 10, 1967. Prior to its opening, the musical had no actual libretto; it was several vignettes with a musical number for each one.|$|E
25|$|We profess Christian {{religion}} in the country, and that film that depicts some thoughts about this person called Jesus Christ that Christians adore as not only as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>man,</b> but was himself God, and such a film basically undermines the very roots of Christianity in Solomon Islands.|$|E
25|$|You're <b>a</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Man,</b> Charlie Brown is a 1967 {{musical comedy}} {{with music and}} lyrics by Clark Gesner, based on the {{characters}} created by cartoonist Charles M. Schulz in his comic strip Peanuts. The musical has been a popular choice for amateur theatre productions because of its small cast and simple staging.|$|E

25|$|Then the debaters {{return to}} their {{previous}} analysis of Pittacus' and Simonides' poetry. On Socrates' interpretation, Pittacus claims {{that it is difficult}} to be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>man,</b> but presumably possible. Simonides, on the other hand, claims that it is impossible to live without ever being a bad man, and even to be <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>man</b> on occasion is difficult (344a45d). Simonides praises those who at least do not do wrong willingly. Socrates' interpretation is that, since Simonides was a wise man, he must know that no one does any wrong willingly; accordingly, he must mean that he will willingly praise those who do no wrong, not that some do wrong willingly and others unwillingly, only the latter garnering his praise (345d46b). Socrates thus argues that the authority of Simonides does not stand against his understanding of virtue and whether anyone willingly does wrong.|$|E
25|$|Peanuts {{achieved}} considerable {{success with}} its television specials, several of which, including A Charlie Brown Christmas and It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown, won or were nominated for Emmy Awards. The Peanuts holiday specials remain popular and are currently broadcast on ABC in the U.S. during the corresponding seasons. The Peanuts franchise met acclaim in theatre, with the stage musical You're <b>a</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Man,</b> Charlie Brown being a successful and often-performed production.|$|E
25|$|Morrison’s funeral at Bell Brothers Mortuary in West Duluth was well-attended. Mayor Samuel Snively and City Commissioner W. S. McCormick eulogized Morrison as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>man.</b> His {{body was}} sent back to his birthplace, Tabor, Iowa. Morrison’s wife, Nora, was 49 when he died. They had two children: John L. Jr., who died a few years after his father, and Mattie Bell, who went on to have a {{successful}} career in politics in the Chicago area.|$|E

25|$|The {{father of}} the Fowler family, Arthur was {{essentially}} <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>man,</b> but he made some foolish choices and he always ended up paying dearly for them, also being bossed {{to the brink of}} insanity by his mother-in-law and wife, Lou Beale (Anna Wing) and Pauline Fowler (Wendy Richard). During his time in Albert Square he had an affair with another woman, suffered with mental disorder, was sent to prison twice and eventually died of a brain haemorrhage in 1996.|$|E
25|$|The love of <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>man</b> was {{ultimately}} what redeemed Rachel. At a welcoming party thrown in his honor, Rachel crossed paths with wealthy publisher, Mac Cory (Douglass Watson). Originally, Mac was a love interest for Liz Matthews, but Lemay noticed the chemistry between Watson and Wyndham {{and wrote a}} love story for them. Fearing backlash from viewers who may have found an older man-younger woman relationship tasteless, Lemay penned chance encounters for the two characters, which led to innocent yet intimate conversations.|$|E
25|$|In 2016 it {{had been}} {{announced}} {{that there was going}} to an off-Broadway revival of You're <b>a</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Man,</b> Charlie Brown, using some of the young stars of Broadway. The seven-member “Peanuts” gang featured Joshua Colley as Charlie Brown, Gregory Diaz as Schroeder, Aidan Gemme as Snoopy, Milly Shapiro as Sally, Mavis Simpson-Ernst as Lucy, and Jeremy T. Villas as Linus. Graydon Peter Yosowitz played the role of Charlie Brown from June 1-7. The show ran from May 24 – June 26, 2016.|$|E

The Musical were musicals {{though there}} were two songs in Happy New Year, Charlie Brown!. It's the Girl in the Red Truck, Charlie Brown was the only special during this period in which Ed Bogas, Judy Munsen, or Desiree Goyette weren't {{involved}} in music production with Paul Rodriquez as the composer. The former and latter would stop scoring the specials in 1990.|$|E
25|$|According to Mahabharata, when Bhishma has to pick Dhritarashtra's successor, he {{mentions}} to Vidura many of Duryodhana's positive qualities {{in comparison to}} Yudhishthira. Having spent so {{many years in the}} forest, Yudhishthira doesn't have Duryodhana's experience, military expertise, education, and courtly manners. Bhishma adds that Duryodhana is loved by the people, while Yudhishthira is an unknown quantity to them. However, Bhishma ultimately selects Yudhishthira, telling Vidura that in his heart, Duryodhana is a power-hungry, vitriolic individual, while at his core, Yudhishthira is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>man</b> who cares tremendously for his people.|$|E
25|$|The Marvelous Land of Oz {{was also}} {{influenced}} by the story and vaudevillian tone of the stage play. The character of the Wizard was in the book <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>man</b> though a bad wizard but in the play, the villain of the piece; this is reflected by the evil part he is described as having played in the back story of this work. The two armies of women, both Jinjur's and Glinda's, were so clearly intended as future chorus girls that even reviews of the book noted the similarity.|$|E
