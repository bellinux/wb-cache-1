5|$|Other {{than its}} use in the kulintang ensemble, the agung also had other non-ensemble uses among the Maguindanao and Maranao. The agung {{has been used to}} warn others of {{impending}} danger, announcing the time of day and other important occasions. For instance, long ago the sultan would beat the agung repeatedly to announce the onset of a meeting or during the fasting month of Ramadhan, the agung would ring either <b>at</b> <b>three</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> to indicate the signal to eat (sawl) or at sunset, to mark the end for fasting that day. And supposedly due to the deep, loud sound the agung produces, people believed that it possessed supernatural powers. For instance, during an earthquake, the locals of Maguindanao would strike the agung in a fast, loud rhythm called baru-baru, believing its vibrations would either lessen or even halt the jolt of an earthquake.|$|E
500|$|... "Slow Life" [...] {{was written}} in two stages. According to bassist Guto Pryce the [...] "electronic part" [...] was {{composed}} by keyboard player Cian Ciaran [...] "quite a few years" [...] before its eventual release. The band had tried to fit this early, purely electronic, version on previous albums but had [...] "never got 'round to it". By the time the group came to record Phantom Power they were anxious to release the song, however Ciaran was reluctant to leave it in its original form and encouraged {{the rest of the}} band to jam over his original track. According to singer Gruff Rhys the instrumentation was recorded [...] "pretty much live" [...] after which lyrics were written and the band's 10-minute jam session was [...] "chopped ... up and made into a composed song" [...] with the electronic section intact. Strings were later added by Sean O'Hagan. Rhys has stated that renting their own studio in Cardiff has given the band the ability to work on tracks such as [...] "Slow Life" [...] over a period of years—the group visit the studio almost every day and play: [...] "the best parts on any of our records, I think, come out of a couple of us being in our little room in Cardiff <b>at</b> <b>three</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> just wigging out and being ecstatic in the music." ...|$|E

They began shooting, but there was no raid. Then there was the natural reaction— a relaxation. And at 5 a.m. we stormed the place." ...|$|E

2500|$|Stone {{described}} the studios as being so accommodating {{that people would}} tend to hang out rather than leave. He said sometimes musicians would [...] "come and live at the Record Plant for a while" [...] because they could sleep, eat, drink, party and play music. Keith Moon and John Lennon were important enough clients {{to be given a}} gold key to the facility. Stone said, [...] "They would come in <b>at</b> <b>three</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> and help themselves to a beer." [...] If the musicians' antics wrecked any part of the studio—which [...] "was a given" [...] for Moon, according to Stone—they were not scolded or turned out; Stone said he simply charged the recording project an inflated fee for repairs.|$|E

Montgomery Gregory, then a {{professor}} at Howard University, rode the Seminole Limited in Georgia in 1915 {{as part of his}} investigation into [...] "Jim Crow" [...] (segregated) cars on Southern trains. Gregory noted that even though the segregated cars on the Central of Georgia were [...] "superior" [...] to other railroads and that the Seminole Limited in particular was [...] "one of the most favorable trains in the South", the train's conductor forced him from his coach <b>at</b> <b>three</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> to make room for whites who wanted to smoke.

2500|$|The boys run out {{to watch}} the {{carnival}} arrive <b>at</b> <b>three</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning.</b> As the train pulls in, the smoke billows in circles and solidifies as the carnival. Mr. Holloway talks about {{this time of night}} as [...] "soul's midnight," [...] when men are closest to death, locked in the depths of despair. The boys go the next day to explore the carnival and they encounter their seventh grade teacher, Miss Foley, who is dazed after visiting the Mirror Maze. Jim insists on coming back that night and Will agrees, but when they bump into the lightning-rod salesman's bag, they realize that they must stay to learn what happens after dark. After investigating all of the rides, they go up to a carousel. Mr. Cooger suddenly grabs Will and Jim after they climb up on horses and he informs them the merry-go-round is broken. Another man arrives and tells him to put them down, introducing himself as Mr. Dark and tells them the huge man's name is Mr. Cooger. Mr. Dark pays attention only to Jim, who is enthralled by what he sees. He then tells the boys to come back the next day and offers them passes to the carousel. [...] They run away and then hide and wait. Both witness Mr. Cooger riding backwards on the carousel (as the music plays backwards), and when he steps off, to their shock- he is twelve years old.|$|E
