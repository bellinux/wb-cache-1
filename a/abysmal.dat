5|$|During the 1930s–1950s {{heyday of}} the big Hollywood studios, {{the status of women}} in the {{industry}} was <b>abysmal</b> and, while much has improved, many would argue that there is still much to be done. From art films by Sally Potter, Catherine Breillat, Claire Denis and Jane Campion to action movies by Kathryn Bigelow, women now have a stronger voice, but are only too aware of the still lingering gender gap.|$|E
5|$|Four days later, the Dukes {{were blown}} out 39–68 by #7 West Virginia. Saunders {{led the team}} with only 12points. One analyst {{attributed}} this loss to the skill of the Mountaineers, an <b>abysmal</b> night by star Bill Clark, {{as well as the}} continued absence of Melquan Bolding and now senior captain Jason Duty, who missed the game with a sprained ankle.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's {{offense was}} No. 5 nationally in rushing yards, {{averaging}} 270.5 per game. Their passing offense was <b>abysmal,</b> however. The Hokies were ranked No. 100 {{in that category}} after averaging 155.9 yards per game during the regular season. Combined, Tech was ranked No. 20 in total offense. In scoring offense, they found success comparable to their rushing game. After averaging 40.3 points per game, they were ranked No. 5.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} the Mediterranean fruit flies in 1929 {{also contributed to the}} nearly {{complete}} destruction of tourism and citrus in South Florida – two vital economic industries in the region. The federal and state government would spend approximately $7million (1929USD) in eradication efforts. There were foreign and domestic bans on the importation of fruits and vegetables from Florida. Programs established by the New Deal and efforts by Florida governors in mid and late 1930s, particularly David Sholtz, brought relief to the economic slump, but the region remained in an <b>abysmal</b> financial state until the onslaught of American involvement in World War II.|$|E
5|$|Waldron's {{squadron}} sighted {{the enemy}} carriers and began attacking at 09:20, followed by Torpedo Squadron 6 (VT-6, from Enterprise) whose Wildcat fighter escorts also ran low on fuel {{and had to}} turn back at 09:40. Without fighter escort, all 15 TBD Devastators of VT-8 were shot down {{without being able to}} inflict any damage. Ensign George H. Gay, Jr. was the only survivor of the 30 aircrew of VT-8. VT-6 lost 10 of its 14 Devastators, and 10 of Yorktowns VT-3's 12 Devastators were shot down with no hits to show for their effort, {{thanks in part to the}} <b>abysmal</b> performance of their unimproved Mark 13 torpedoes. Midway was the last time the TBD Devastator was used in combat.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese combat air patrol, flying Mitsubishi A6M2 Zeros, made short {{work of the}} unescorted, slow, under-armed TBDs. A few TBDs {{managed to}} get within a few ship-lengths range of their targets before {{dropping}} their torpedoes—close {{enough to be able}} to strafe the enemy ships and force the Japanese carriers to make sharp evasive maneuvers—but all of their torpedoes either missed or failed to explode. Remarkably, senior Navy and Bureau of Ordnance officers never questioned why half a dozen torpedoes, released so close to the Japanese carriers, produced no results. The <b>abysmal</b> performance of American torpedoes in the early months of the war became a scandal. Torpedo after torpedo either missed by running directly under the target, prematurely exploded, or struck targets with textbook right angle hits (sometimes with an audible clang) and failed to explode.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after the selection of Virginia Tech and Boston College, concerns about potential attendance at the 2008 ACC Championship Game arose. Because the same matchup resulted in such low attendance at the 2007 championship game in Jacksonville, it was doubted that Tampa, which is several hundred miles further south and more distant from the two schools, could attract as many spectators as the previous season's game. Adding {{to the problem of}} selling tickets was the 2008 economic crisis, which many fans cited as a reason for not purchasing tickets. By the Wednesday before the game, Virginia Tech had sold just 3,000 of the 10,000 tickets it was required by contract to sell. There also were questions about how many local fans would attend. To mitigate the problems seen in Jacksonville the year before, ticket prices were lowered from $65 to $25, and it was hoped that the lower capacity of Tampa's Raymond James Stadium compared with Jacksonville Municipal Stadium would allow for a quicker sellout. The campaign to attract more fans was moderately successful, as 30,000 of the 43,000 tickets not assigned to either school were sold by December 1, five days before the game. Team ticket sales were <b>abysmal,</b> however, as Virginia Tech and Boston College combined to sell just 5,000 tickets of the 20,000 allotted to the two teams.|$|E
5|$|Turner {{had never}} been a head coach before; he faced a team {{convinced}} that Baugh had been treated shabbily by Wismer and had difficulty uniting the players. After the Titans split their first two games against Oakland and the Chargers (who had moved to San Diego), the team came home to no paychecks. The players refused to practice, though they worked out on their own on Friday. They then flew to Buffalo and defeated the winless Bills. Public attention in New York was focused on the established local teams, as well as the <b>abysmal</b> record of the fledgling Mets, who nevertheless attracted a cult following. The Titans received little publicity and attracted only 4,719 fans to the home opener against Denver. They were required to wait {{until the end of the}} Mets' season before they were allowed to use the Polo Grounds. The Broncos defeated the Titans, 32–10, and Titans quarterback Dean Look suffered a career-ending injury. New York's financial and football woes continued through October 1962, and at the beginning of November, Wismer informed AFL commissioner Joe Foss that he lacked the money to continue operations. The league assumed the cost of running the team for the rest of 1962; Wismer remained in nominal charge. The Titans had little success on the field (the highlight was a 46–45 victory at favored Denver on Thanksgiving), and finished the season insolvent with a 5–9 record.|$|E
5|$|Under new Head Coach Wim Jansen, Celtic had to {{negotiate}} two qualifying rounds {{to qualify for}} the first round proper of the 1997–98 UEFA Cup. Welsh Inter Cabel-Tel were comfortably disposed of 8–0 on aggregate, but the next qualifying round against Tirol Innsbruck proved more difficult. An <b>abysmal</b> first leg performance in Austria was salvaged only by a late Alan Stubbs free kick, Celtic losing 21 on the night but netting a valuable away goal. The return match in Glasgow was an exciting see-saw affair. Celtic twice took the lead in the first half, only for Innsbruck to equalise on each occasion, their second goal an own goal by Henrik Larsson just before half-time. Goals in the second half from Simon Donnelly and Craig Burley put Celtic ahead on aggregate, but Gernot Krinner's header on 82 minutes levelled the tie on aggregate and gave the Austrians the advantage because of the away goals rule. But Celtic responded with three minutes to go, Wieghorst showed excellent skill in the penalty box to control Donnelly's knockdown before shooting in. With the match going into injury time and the tie poised on a knife-edge, Larsson went on a mazy run forward before passing to Burley who scored from close range to clinch a 63 win on the night to progress on aggregate. Celtic were then drawn against Liverpool in the first round proper.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the team}} had an <b>abysmal</b> regular season showing, they excelled in U.S. Open Cup competition, making a run to the semifinals, before bowing out against Columbus.|$|E
25|$|Florida {{traveled}} to Fayetteville and beat Arkansas 42–7. The Gators had an <b>abysmal</b> second quarter, but recovered and Danny Wuerffel threw for a then-school record of 462 yards.|$|E
25|$|In 2006 Crocker {{drove the}} No. 98 {{full-time}} in the Truck Series. She finished an <b>abysmal</b> 25th in the Craftsman Truck standings. After struggling during the 2006 season, Evernham decided {{to close the}} No. 98 team.|$|E
25|$|The {{youth of}} this country know what the stakes are. They're upset. And they're indignant over our {{apparent}} unconcern. Whole student populations are engaging in protests and demonstrations against those who compound their transgressions of pollution with an <b>abysmal</b> ignorance of man's responsibility to his environment.|$|E
25|$|Province wide Question A of the {{plebiscite}} {{passed in}} 33 of the 50 districts while Question B passed in all five districts. Stony Plain voted {{in favour of}} the proposal by a landslide majority. Voter turnout in the district was <b>abysmal</b> falling well under the province wide average of 46%.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, CBS' {{regular season}} ratings earned an <b>abysmal</b> (by the {{standards}} of the time) 26 share on Sunday afternoons. In 1978, the deciding game of the NBA Finals ranked 442nd out of 730 shows from September 1, 1977 to August 31, 1978. The next highest-rated playoff game in prime time only ranked 619th.|$|E
25|$|The 1981–82 season {{represented}} {{a step back}} for the franchise as the Cents ended up second to last in the Interior Division with an <b>abysmal</b> record of 11–35–2. Remarkably, the Vernon Lakers had a worse record, finishing three points behind the Centennials. Merritt was overmatched by BCJHL leading scorer Ray Ferraro and his Penticton Knights in the Interior Division semifinals, going out in four straight games.|$|E
25|$|The Dallas Mavericks {{made the}} playoffs {{for the first time since}} 1990. Along the way they had many <b>abysmal</b> seasons, {{including}} back-to-back years with 11 and 13 wins. By beating Utah in the first round, they won their first playoff series since 1988. Reunion Arena, their home court for 21 years, hosted its last game (Game 4 of the Western Conference Semifinals against the Spurs); they moved to American Airlines Center in 2002.|$|E
25|$|The {{economy in}} America was now {{beginning}} {{to show signs of}} recovery and the unemployment rate was lowering following the <b>abysmal</b> year of 1938. The biggest shift towards recovery, however, came with the decision of Germany to invade France at the beginning of WWII. After France had been defeated, the U.S. economy would skyrocket in the months following. France's defeat meant that Britain and other allies would look to the U.S. for large supplies of materials for the war.|$|E
25|$|The program regressed further {{during the}} Jim Fassel era from 1985 to 1989, with a 25–33 record (.431). His teams {{were marked by}} high scoring offenses and <b>abysmal</b> defenses. In 1989, his final season, the Utes scored 30.42 points per game, but allowed 43.67 points per game. The lone bright spot of his tenure was a 57–28 upset of nationally ranked BYU to end the 1988 season, which was dubbed by Ute fans as The Rice Bowl.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} {{to the lack of}} employment for many of those arriving at the Durst Ranch, living conditions for the temporary field hands were particularly <b>abysmal.</b> Workers lived in tents in the hot summer sun on a barren hillside, paying Durst 75 cents per week for the privilege as a rental fee. More workers were on hand than could be accommodated in these tents, however, forcing some to make do in the elements under crude structures constructed from poles and burlap sacks.|$|E
25|$|In hope {{to salvage}} their <b>abysmal</b> season, United played a full {{strength}} lineup in the U.S. Open Cup semifinals against Eastern Conference-rival Columbus Crew. Thanks to Hernández's 13th-minute penalty kick, United took a 1–0 lead over Columbus for {{nearly the entire}} match; however, in the last minute of play, an own goal by Mark Burch forced the game to go into overtime, where a penalty kick from the Crew's captain, Guillermo Barros Schelotto, ultimately led United to bow out of the tournament.|$|E
25|$|In the Nicaraguan general election, 1990, a {{coalition}} of anti-Sandinista parties (from {{the left and right}} of the political spectrum) led by Violeta Chamorro, the widow of Pedro Joaquín Chamorro Cardenal, defeated the Sandinistas. The defeat shocked the Sandinistas, who had expected to win. Commentators such as Noam Chomsky and Brian Willson attributed the outcome to the U.S.-Contra threats to continue the war if the Sandinistas retained power, the general war-weariness of the Nicaraguan population, and the <b>abysmal</b> Nicaraguan economic situation.|$|E
25|$|After {{winning the}} {{division}} in 2005, the Bucs suffered through an <b>abysmal</b> 2006 season. The season {{was plagued by}} injuries, with starters such as guard Dan Buenning, wide receiver Michael Clayton, running back Cadillac Williams, defensive end Simeon Rice, cornerback Brian Kelly, and quarterback Chris Simms all being placed on injured reserve {{at some point in}} the season. The season also saw a lot of rookies starting for the Bucs, such as quarterback Bruce Gradkowski, tackle Jeremy Trueblood, and guard Davin Joseph.|$|E
25|$|After an <b>abysmal</b> season, Instituto and Tiro Federal were {{relegated to}} the Nacional B Division {{a few weeks before}} the end of the tournament. The next two worst teams in the relegation standings, Argentinos Juniors and Olimpo de Bahía Blanca, played a Promoción playoff (home and away) series against Huracán and Belgrano de Córdoba, respectively, for two spots in next year's Argentine First Division. Argentinos Juniors remains in the top {{category}} after drawing with Huracán twice. Olimpo, however, were relegated to Nacional B after losing twice to Belgrano.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, the Revs {{continued}} the mediocrity that had plagued {{the second half}} of their 2008 season, losing to Chicago again {{in the first round of}} the playoffs. The team also lost to Chicago in the semifinals of the 2009 SuperLiga. 2010 started even more dismally than 2009, with the team failing to put together an unbeaten streak longer than three games until July. Despite the <b>abysmal</b> progress, this unbeaten streak coincided with the Revs' third consecutive SuperLiga appearance, and for the second time in three years, the team made the competition's final, but lost 2–1 to Monarcas Morelia of Mexico.|$|E
25|$|The {{roads in}} Laos were scanty and <b>abysmal,</b> leaving {{aircraft}} as the alternative. The Royal Lao Air Force being incapable of air {{delivery of the}} civic action supplies, another carrier had to be found. The U.S. 483rd Troop Carrier Wing of C-119 Flying Boxcars was forwarded from Ashiya Air Base, Japan. The C-119s were augmented by two new C-130 Hercules detailed to the specific task of air-dropping a pair of bulldozers. The wing was tasked to airlift 37 tons (33.6 metric tons) of freight from Bangkok to Laos, and with airdropping 23 tons (20.9 metric tons) of supplies.|$|E
25|$|After {{winning the}} {{division}} in 2005, the Buccaneers suffered through an <b>abysmal</b> 2006 season. The season {{was plagued by}} injuries, with starters such as G Dan Buenning, WR Michael Clayton, RB Carnell Williams, DE Simeon Rice, CB Brian Kelly, and QB Chris Simms all being placed on injured reserve {{at some point in}} the season. The season also saw a lot of rookies starting for the Bucs, such as QB Bruce Gradkowski, T Jeremy Trueblood, and G Davin Joseph. The league schedule was also unfriendly to the Bucs, scheduling them for 3 games (two of them away games) within 11 days of each other.|$|E
25|$|The whole {{campaign}} on Bommerlward {{had been an}} <b>abysmal</b> failure for the Spanish. They were dealt a fatal blow to their campaign to expand the Spanish Netherlands North of the Mass. Vere reported to Robert Cecil after the campaign that the Spanish army was so wearied and discontented that the soldiers 'disbanded in heaps'. In addition there was no likelihood of good government among them until {{the coming of the}} Archduke. Worse was to follow with the disbandment; a series of mutinies occurred that forced any further Spanish operations to be put on hold as the States and English army now made a counter-offensive.|$|E
25|$|The Hitmen were <b>abysmal</b> {{in their}} first two seasons, winning just 33 games combined. The team also faced further {{controversy}} when head coach Graham James resigned after being charged with, and later convicted of, sexually abusing two of his players {{when he was with}} the Swift Current Broncos. In 1997, the Hitmen were purchased by the Calgary Flames. The team's fortunes improved immediately, as the Hitmen won their division in 1997–98, and the following season, the Hitmen captured the league championship in just their fourth season. The Hitmen advanced {{all the way to the}} 1999 Memorial Cup title game before losing in overtime to the host Ottawa 67's 7-6 in a thrilling final.|$|E
25|$|Jerome's account, {{including}} his estimated speed of only , was corroborated by two further {{letters to the}} Times, from E. Riggs and Clara Claritas commander, Captain Alex Smith. In his response, also published in the Times, Dickerson did not deny the <b>abysmal</b> performance of his engine adaptation, confining his comments instead to a denial of the charge that he had lied in his previous letter. The spectacular failure of the engine {{was not lost on}} Dickerson's enemies in the Navy Department, some of whom quickly published a satirical piece on him entitled Uncle Samuel's Whistle And What It Costs. The piece was later reproduced in Frank M. Bennett's book The Steam Navy of the United States.|$|E
25|$|Just {{when things}} couldn't {{seem to get}} any worse coming off a last place overall finish, they did for the 1983–84 season, as the Cents {{finished}} with an <b>abysmal</b> record of 8–51–1. The team also set a dubious BCJHL record for the most goals allowed in a season with 543, an average of 9.05 against per game. This {{despite the fact that}} forward Brent Demerais set a single season team record that still stands today with 66 goals. His total represents 26.7% of the total goals the team scored that season. In fact, Demerais' point total of 124 was good enough for third overall in the BCJHL, but it was the lone bright spot in a season with very few.|$|E
25|$|In August 2016, Pakistan toured England and Ireland {{for a full}} tour. Azhar Ali had a good test tour,highlight {{of which}} was 139 against England in Birmingham in a losing effort. He scored 30 in the final test at the Oval to finish test series at 2–2.He {{finished}} as the second highest runscorer for Pakistan in the test series. The following ODI series for Pakistan was <b>abysmal</b> {{and was one of}} the worst in history of Pakistan in England. Azhar Ali captained his side in a 4–1 losing effort,which included a thumping 169 run loss in which England scored a world record score of 444 runs in an innings. Azhar Ali scored 208 runs in 5 innings including two scores of 80 and 82.His tally was the second most of any Pakistani in that series.|$|E
25|$|Six months earlier, down-on-his-luck screenwriter Joe tries selling Paramount Pictures {{producer}} Sheldrake on a {{story he}} submitted. Script reader Betty Schaefer harshly critiques it in Joe's presence, unaware {{that he is the}} author. Later, while fleeing from men trying to repossess his car, Joe turns into the driveway of a seemingly deserted mansion. After concealing the car, he hears a woman calling him, apparently mistaking him for someone else. Ushered in by Max, her butler, Joe recognizes the woman as almost-forgotten silent film star Norma Desmond. Learning he is a writer, she asks his opinion of a script she has written for a film about Salome. She plans to play the title role herself in a comeback attempt. Joe finds her script <b>abysmal,</b> but flatters her into hiring him as a script doctor.|$|E
25|$|On February 13, 2010, after a 17–33 {{record at}} the season's midway point, The Wizards traded Butler, Haywood, and Stevenson to the Mavericks in {{exchange}} for Josh Howard, Drew Gooden, Quinton Ross and James Singleton. Three days later, the Wizards traded Antawn Jamison to the Cavaliers {{in exchange for}} Zydrunas Ilgauskas and obtained Al Thornton from the Los Angeles Clippers in a three-team deal. Ilgauskas reported long enough to take a physical (to make the trade official). His contract was immediately bought out, making him a free agent. On February 26, 2010, the Wizards signed Shaun Livingston to a 10-day contract. With Gilbert Arenas suspended and Caron Butler and Antawn Jamison being traded, the Wizards finished the season at 26-56, posting an <b>abysmal</b> 9–23 record to finish the season. They were the only Southeast Division team {{not to make the}} post-season.|$|E
25|$|The Cleveland Browns and the Steelers {{have been}} divisional rivals {{since the two}} cities' teams began playing {{against each other in}} 1950. After posting a 9–31 record in the first 40 games of the series between the two cities, the Steelers {{recently}} took over the all-time series lead {{for the first time ever}} (64–56); partly due to their dominance over the post-1999 Cleveland Browns franchise and won twelve straight before the Browns snapped their losing skid against them by beating them 13–6 on December 10, 2009. Additionally, the Browns lost 16 straight years in Pittsburgh from – and posted an <b>abysmal</b> 5–24 record at Three Rivers Stadium overall. Former Steelers head coach Bill Cowher coached the Browns special teams and secondary before following Marty Schottenheimer for a brief tenure as Kansas City Defensive Coordinator, and then hired by Pittsburgh. This has only intensified the rivalry.|$|E
25|$|During the 1970s, Blackburn Rovers bounced {{between the}} Second and Third Divisions, winning the Third Division title in 1975, but never mounted a {{challenge}} for promotion to the First Division {{despite the efforts of}} successive managers to put the club back on track, and fell back into the Third Division in 1979. They went up as runners up in the Third Division in 1980 and have remained in the upper two tiers of the English league ever since. A second successive promotion was nearly achieved the following year, but the club missed out on goal difference, and promotion-winning manager Howard Kendall moved to Everton that summer. Kendall's successor, Bobby Saxton only managed mid-table finishes for the next three seasons, then nearly achieved promotion in the 1984–85 season, but a poor finish the following year (just one place above relegation) followed by an <b>abysmal</b> start to the 1986–87 season cost Saxton his job.|$|E
