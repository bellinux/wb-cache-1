5|$|On Her Majesty's Secret Service is a 1969 British spy {{film and}} the {{sixth in the}} James Bond series to be {{produced}} by Eon Productions. It {{is based on the}} 1963 novel of the same name by Ian Fleming. Following Sean Connery's decision to retire from the role <b>after</b> <b>You</b> Only Live Twice, Eon Productions selected an unknown actor and model, George Lazenby, to play the part of James Bond. During the making of the film, Lazenby announced that he would play the role of Bond only once.|$|E
5|$|George Lazenby {{was signed}} on to play Bond for OHMSS. Between Sean Connery giving his notice at the {{beginning}} of filming You Only Live Twice and its release, Saltzman had planned to adapt The Man with the Golden Gun in Cambodia and use Roger Moore as the next Bond, but political instability meant the location was ruled out and Moore signed up for another series of the television programme The Saint. <b>After</b> <b>You</b> Only Live Twice was released in 1967, the producers once again picked the often-delayed On Her Majesty's Secret Service, which had previously been considered to follow both Goldfinger and then Thunderball.|$|E

5|$|The Cottage was {{originally}} developed in 1977–1978 by three children: brothers Viggo Kann (then Eriksson) and Kimmo Eriksson, and their friend Olle Johansson, {{who at the}} time of the project's start were ten, twelve and fourteen years old, respectively. As Viggo and Kimmo's parents worked at Stockholms Datamaskincentral ("Stockholm's Computer Center", QZ) and the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), and Johansson's father worked at an office that was a client for QZ, they had access to QZ's DEC-10 mainframe computer Oden. Using Oden and the book What to Do <b>After</b> <b>You</b> Hit Return (1975), the Eriksson brothers and Johansson learned programming.|$|E
5|$|When {{you were}} hungry, {{you began to}} cry, because you could not speak. You were seven months without teeth, always sucking. But <b>after</b> <b>you</b> got one, you began to gnaw a crust of bread. It {{was not long before}} another came pop. At ten months you had four pretty white teeth, and you used to bite me. Poor mamma! Still I did not cry, because I am not a child, but you hurt me very much. So I said to papa, it is time the little girl should eat. She is not naughty, yet she hurts me. I have given her a crust of bread, and I must look for some other milk.|$|E
5|$|With the {{departure}} of Connery <b>after</b> <b>You</b> Only Live Twice, Broccoli and director Peter R. Hunt chose Australian George Lazenby {{to play the role}} of Bond. He first came to their attention after seeing him in a Fry's Chocolate Cream advertisement. Lazenby dressed the part by sporting several sartorial Bond elements such as a Rolex Submariner wristwatch and a Savile Row suit (ordered, but uncollected, by Connery), and going to Connery's barber at the Dorchester Hotel. Lazenby consolidated his claim during a screen test, when he accidentally punched a professional wrestler, who was acting as stunt coordinator, in the face, impressing Broccoli with his ability to display aggression. Lazenby never signed a contract, with negotiations dragging on during production, and he was subsequently convinced by his agent Ronan O'Rahilly that the secret agent would be archaic in the liberated 1970s; as a result he left the role before the release of On Her Majesty's Secret Service in 1969. For his performance as Bond, Lazenby was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actor at the 27th Golden Globe Awards.|$|E

25|$|In stark {{contrast}} to the original portrayals of the Onibaba, the Onibaba has undergone a few striking transformations. One example is that of Bappy-chan, the Onibaba mascot of the Adachigahara Furusatomura Village, a tourist destination in Japan depicting a replica of a traditional Japanese village that lies on the Onibaba’s stomping grounds. Unsurprisingly, Bappy-chan has horns and fangs, sports an angry face, and is posed in a fashion as if she were about to chase <b>after</b> <b>you.</b> But controversially according to her original image, she is drawn in a super-deformed fashion that gives her a harmless, cute, and loveable appearance. The Village sells merchandise featuring Bappy-chan and even offers a virtual Onibaba for download on their website.|$|E
25|$|Phoenix {{appears in}} , voiced by Sarah Waits. She is a NPC for the PS2, Xbox, PS3, Xbox 360, Wii and PSP versions, {{and is a}} striker {{character}} in the Game Boy Advance version. In the PC and next-gen console versions, she is initially kidnapped by Arcade putting her under mind control and forces her to battle the player's team. After she is rescued, she assists the player's mission to rescue Nightcrawler from Mephisto's realm, only to be captured by Blackheart in the process. After defeating Blackheart, the player has the choice to save either Jean or Nightcrawler, since saving one results in the other's death. If Nightcrawler was rescued, then Jean will be resurrected by Mephisto (this will occur during the game). <b>After</b> <b>you</b> defeat Phoenix during the fight against Mephisto, Jean Grey-Summers dismisses herself as an echo of her past self and sacrifices her life to defeat Mephisto. In {{the end of the}} game, it is revealed if the player let Jean die, she will return as the Dark Phoenix and exact her revenge on those who did not save her. On a side note, she has special dialogue with Nightcrawler, Wolverine, Invisible Woman, and Cyclops. On the game's PC Version, Jean is available as a playable Mod character from Marvel Mods. There are several versions of Jean which give her different powersets. These include powersets from the 1990s, Morrison's Run, current Phoenix, Dark Phoenix, and Goblin Queen. She also has powersets based on her XML2 and MUA2 (both the Xbox 360/PS3 and the PSP/PS2/WII) versions. She has many costumes including all her Phoenix costumes, Marvel Girl, Original X-Men, First Class, Black Queen, Maddie Pryor, AOA, Ultimate, 1990s, Here Comes Tomorrow, New X-Men, Evolution, Movie, X-Factor, as well as many custom costumes. On PC mod patch provided by Marvel Mods that both Jean Grey and Nightcrawler can be saved from the Void by a telekinetic user (mainly Magneto by default), then both Jean and Nightcrawler manage to catch up with their four allies, whose having a trouble defeating Mephisto due to his realm is a source of his unlimited power, leaving Jean, whose Phoenix Force can match Mephisto's power finishes the demon lord for good, and with the two X-Men are finally returned safely.|$|E
