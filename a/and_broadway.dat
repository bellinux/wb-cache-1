5|$|Having {{purchased}} the film rights to Journey's End, British producers Michael Balcon and Thomas Welsh agreed that Whale's experience directing the London <b>and</b> <b>Broadway</b> productions {{of the play}} made him the best choice to direct the film.

5|$|NY43 was {{truncated}} on {{its western}} {{end to the}} junction of 3rd Avenue <b>and</b> <b>Broadway</b> in downtown Rensselaer in the early 1970s, eliminating the overlap with US9 and US20 through Albany. Its former routing from Schoharie to Albany was renumbered to NY443. NY43 remained on 3rd Avenue up to the late 1990s when it was rerouted to follow a new highway to I-90 exit8 west of Defreestville. The realignment eliminated the overlap with US4 and also took NY43 outside of the Rensselaer city limits {{for the first time}} since being extended across the Hudson River in 1930. The former alignment of NY43 along 3rd Avenue from Broadway to Barracks Road became part of NY151; the remainder was designated NY915E, an unsigned reference route.|$|E

5|$|New {{construction}} almost halted {{when the}} Great Depression {{began in the}} 1930s. As a result, there are few buildings in the district in that era's architectural styles. The post office at Fourth <b>and</b> <b>Broadway,</b> built despite much public outcry over the demolition of its landmark 1894 predecessor, is the district's most notable building of the 1930s. Its stripped-down Classical Revival style shows the influence of Art Deco in its smooth, finished surfaces. The enameled metal facade on a Third Street storefront, dating to 1940, makes it the only building in the district to show any trace of the Streamline Moderne style.|$|E

5|$|On December 21, 1981, the Tony Award-winning musical Dreamgirls {{opened at}} the Imperial Theatre on Broadway and ran for 1,522 performances.

Several of the {{characters}} in the play are analogues of real-life Supremes/Motown counterparts, with the story focusing upon the Florence Ballard doppelgänger Effie White. While influenced by the Supremes' and Motown's music, the songs in the play are a broader mix of R/soul <b>and</b> <b>Broadway</b> music. Mary Wilson loved the musical, but Diana Ross was reportedly angered by it and refused to see it.|$|E

The New Jersey Department of Transportation built a higher bridge in 1971 on a new alignment.|$|E
