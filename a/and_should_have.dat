Daley Plaza, while other students criticized Nelson for poor timing in showing a racially insensitive image.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, oxygen {{has become}} {{available}} for recreational use in oxygen bars. The US Food and Drug Administration has warned those suffering from {{problems such as}} heart or lung disease not to use oxygen bars. Scuba divers use breathing gases containing up to 100% oxygen, <b>and</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> specific training in using such gases.|$|E
5|$|On 29 April 1969 the Irish {{parliament}} {{passed the}} Nelson Pillar Act, terminating the Pillar Trust and vesting {{ownership of the}} site in Dublin Corporation. The trustees received £21,170 in compensation for the Pillar's destruction, and a further sum for loss of income. In the debate, Senator Owen Sheehy-Skeffington argued that the Pillar had been capable of repair <b>and</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been re-assembled and rebuilt.|$|E

The presence of the dye indicated that the crack was present <b>and</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been detected at a prior inspection. The detection failure arose from poor attention to human factors in United Airlines' specification of maintenance processes.|$|E
5|$|A 1993 study {{commissioned}} by the United States Army to investigate racial discrimination in the awarding of medals. During the investigation {{it was determined that}} one Veteran American Jew and Holocaust survivor, Tibor Rubin, had been the subject of discrimination due to his religion <b>and</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> received the Medal of Honor. In 2005, 55 years later, President George W. Bush presented the Medal of Honor to Rubin in a ceremony at the White House, for his actions in 1950 during the Korean War.|$|E
5|$|Fruit in {{blackcurrants}} {{is borne}} primarily on one-year-old shoots. Newly planted bushes should be pruned severely, cutting all shoots back to two buds above ground level. This gives the plant {{a chance to}} get properly established before needing to put its energy into producing fruit. The general rule when pruning is to remove all weak shoots and those growing out sideways which may get weighed down when fruiting. The remaining branches should be thinned so as to remove old unproductive wood and encourage new shoots. An established bush {{should not be allowed to}} become overcrowded <b>and</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> about one third of its main branches or stems removed each year. When harvesting by machine, plants with an upright growth habit are encouraged.|$|E

5|$|Harper {{was appalled}} when Britain made India {{independent}} in 1947—he {{held that the}} British government had unnecessarily caved in to Indian nationalist demands <b>and</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> continued in the subcontinent indefinitely. He retained this view for years afterwards. He retired from the RAF in April 1949 with the rank of wing commander, and the same year emigrated to Southern Rhodesia, a British colony in southern Africa that had been self-governing since 1923. He settled in the central town of Gatooma, where he farmed, mined and set up an earth-moving contractor's business. In 1953, Southern Rhodesia became a territory of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland alongside Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Each territory retained its own political status and government, and Southern Rhodesia's constitutional status was unaltered.|$|E
5|$|On 28 August 1943, Mackay {{once again}} assumed command of New Guinea Force. This time, {{important}} operations were being {{undertaken in the}} Battle of Finschhafen and Mackay's period of command was marred by disagreements with General Douglas MacArthur's staff over the reinforcement of Finschhafen. Junior commanders felt that Mackay {{should have been more}} forceful, <b>and</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> enlisted the help of his superior, Blamey, at an earlier stage. Blamey agreed with them, feeling that his old colleague was slowing down, and no longer possessed the vigour required for the campaign in New Guinea. Mackay left New Guinea in November 1943, handing over command of New Guinea Force to Lieutenant General Sir Leslie Morshead, and on 20 January 1944 Mackay relinquished command of Second Army and New Guinea Force.|$|E
5|$|Terceira {{argued that}} she had a second horse, Chaka III, who should have been used in the injured Navantus' place, was {{regularly}} faster than Nisbett's Antille 8 <b>and</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> earned the qualification position. She also accused the Bermuda Equestrian Federation of making the decision based on political or racial motivations, which the organization denied. BEF president Mike Cherry explained that Chaka III did not qualify for the event until June 30, the final day, which is the reason why the horse was not considered for Bermuda's Olympic slot. The BEF organized a final day of competition between Nisbett's Antille and Terceira's Chaka to give Terceira one last opportunity to qualify for an Olympic position. Nisbett, however, withdrew from the Olympic position later that June. Terceira took his place.|$|E

5|$|The First Test was a {{continuation}} of the trend of English batsmen being largely unable to cope with Australia's pacemen. Hutton was the only Englishman to pass 50 in the MCC match, and at Trent Bridge only he and Compton managed this feat. Apart from Hardstaff, none of the remaining batsmen passed 25. Wisden's verdict was that England fought back very well, but that avoiding defeat was almost impossible after their poor batting on the first day. Bowes considered the defensive English bowling display worthy of a draw, and blamed the first innings batting for the failure to prevenet defeat. However, he believed the English tactics to be justified <b>and</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been continued.|$|E
5|$|Whitewing was {{the name}} of a special purpose entity used as a {{financing}} method by Enron. In December 1997, with funding of $579 million provided by Enron and $500 million by an outside investor, Whitewing Associates L.P. was formed. Two years later, the entity's arrangement was changed so that it would no longer be consolidated with Enron and be counted on the company's balance sheet. Whitewing was used to purchase Enron assets, including stakes in power plants, pipelines, stocks, and other investments. Between 1999 and 2001, Whitewing bought assets from Enron worth $2 billion, using Enron stock as collateral. Although the transactions were approved by the Enron board, the asset transfers were not true sales <b>and</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been treated instead as loans.|$|E
5|$|Captain Hayes, {{unable to}} reach the MTB, had started {{swimming}} away from the shooting, and came ashore beside Asnieres-en-Bessin. He managed to evade capture and made contact with a local French family who provided him with civilian clothing and contacted the French resistance. Hayes was taken by train to Lisieux and after several weeks reached Paris. Hayes was moved along an escape line to the Spanish border, arriving in October 1942. After crossing into Spain he was stopped by Spanish border guards who handed {{him over to the}} Germans. Hayes was returned to Paris and imprisoned in Fresnes prison. He was kept in solitary confinement for nine months before being executed by firing squad on 13 July 1943. Hayes had landed in uniform <b>and</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been considered a prisoner of war, but he was executed following the issue of the commando order which called for the execution of all commandos upon capture. It was discovered after the war that Hayes had been betrayed to the Germans, who were aware of all his movements from Normandy to the Spanish border. The persons believed responsible for Hayes' betrayal were never punished, as they convinced the authorities they were acting as double agents.|$|E
