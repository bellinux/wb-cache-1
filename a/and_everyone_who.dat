Everybody received autographed copies of the album and Wonder gave interviews. Critical reception was positive. The album {{was viewed as a}} guided tour through a wide range of musical styles and the life and feelings of the artist. It included recollections of childhood, of first love and lost love. It contained songs about faith and love among all peoples and songs about social justice for the poor and downtrodden.|$|E

25|$|In {{a famous}} fragment, Empedocles {{attempted}} {{to explain the}} phenomena of respiration {{by means of an}} elaborate analogy with the clepsydra, an ancient device for conveying liquids from one vessel to another. This fragment has sometimes been connected to a passage in Aristotle's Physics where Aristotle refers to people who twisted wineskins and captured air in clepsydras to demonstrate that void does not exist. There is however, no evidence that Empedocles performed any experiment with clepsydras. The fragment certainly implies that Empedocles knew about the corporeality of air, but he says nothing whatever about the void. The clepsydra was a common utensil <b>and</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>who</b> used it must have known, in some sense, that the invisible air could resist liquid.|$|E
25|$|On several {{occasions}} the Riglers maintained that their home {{had been the}} best available option for Genie at the time, and said that both they <b>and</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>who</b> worked with her thought she was doing well. They also said they genuinely loved Genie and always provided her the best care possible, pointing out {{that she had made}} substantial progress in every aspect of her development while living with them, and they and Curtiss both said Genie's mother had prevented them from continuing to work with Genie as they had wanted. While representing the Riglers in court in 1977 and 1978 John Miner {{went out of his way}} to give them credit for acting as foster parents to Genie for four years, and when Curtiss spoke to Rymer in the early 1990s she praised their work with Genie and their willingness to take her into their home, although she also felt they had not done enough when she told them about Genie's abuse in foster care. Justin Leiber argued that the scientists' inability to do more for Genie was largely out of their control, and primarily the result of legal and institutional processes surrounding her placement.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} on The John and Ken Show on KFI, Headley {{was asked if he}} experienced retaliation from Scientology for speaking critically about the organization. He said that he had been issued a declaration that he was to be considered a [...] "Suppressive Person" [...] by members of the organization, and explained, [...] "That's basically the thing that goes out to anyone <b>and</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>who</b> is in Scientology, saying, 'This person is a Suppressive Person, and you can no longer speak to him ever again.' If you are in Scientology, and you speak to somebody who is a Suppressive Person, you yourself can be declared a Suppressive Person." [...] Headley said when he left Scientology the organization gave him a [...] "freeloader statement", a bill for US$62,000, for courses he had received in Scientology. [...] "It's actually illegal, because they are basically charging me for on-the-job training – in California you can't charge somebody for on-the-job training. It's of no real value, but you don't know that, when you're in Scientology. You think, 'Are they going to garnish my wages, are they going to sue me?' You don't know," [...] said Headley.|$|E
500|$|A pun, the character's name [...] "Kim Possible" [...] {{alludes to}} the word [...] "impossible". Kim is {{referred}} to by several nicknames by various characters throughout the series, including K.P. (Ron); Kimmy Cub (James); K, Miss Perfect, Tin Teeth (Bonnie); Princess, Pumpkin, Cupcake, Miss Snooty, Miss Priss (Shego); and Kimmie by miscellaneous. Unlike traditional superheroes and secret agents, Kim lacks a secret identity; the character is known simply as [...] "Kim Possible, <b>and</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>who</b> knows her knows what she does." [...] Kadeen Griffiths of Bustle observed that Kim [...] "never put on spandex or acquired a secret identity; instead, {{she had her own}} website where people could book her for jobs with a tagline that promised that she could do anything", a claim reinforced by {{the fact that she is}} capable of fighting crime while continuing to perform well in high school and remaining captain of her school's cheerleading squad. Writing for Women Write About Comics, Jamie Kingston observed that Middleton High School [...] "ignores her as a heroine unless something happens on school grounds where she has to do her thing." [...] Thus, Kim rarely receives attention for her work from her family and peers, although her customers remain grateful. However, while describing Kim as a [...] "power fantasy", Stealing Commas believes that Kim is simply [...] "preventing regime change" [...] and [...] "Preserving the status quo rather than doing any real world saving." [...] According to Metacritic, Kim [...] "is stubborn, strong-willed, and has a fuse shorter than a grenade with a three second delay" [...] but remains [...] "extremely humble, refusing to take credit for her truly amazing actions." [...] Meanwhile, David Horiuchi of Amazon.com wrote that the character is [...] "tough, witty, and refreshingly free of any saucy teen attitude." ...|$|E
2500|$|Local {{historian}} Leila M.
