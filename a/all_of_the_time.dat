5|$|As a {{descriptive}} {{model of the}} two levels, Hare posited two extreme cases of people, one of whom would only use critical moral thinking and the other of whom would only use intuitive moral thinking. The former he called the 'archangel' and the latter the 'prole'. It {{is worth noting that}} it is not Hare's intention to divide up the entire human race into either archangels or proles; according to his theory each person shares the traits of both to limited and varying extents at different times. The archangel has superhuman powers of thought, superhuman knowledge and no weaknesses. This unbiased 'ideal observer', when presented with an unfamiliar situation, would be able to immediately scan all potential consequences of all possible actions in order to frame a universal principle from which he/she could decide an appropriate action for the situation. Such a person would not need a set of intuitive moral rules, as he/she would be able to decide the correct response to any possible situation by reason alone. By contrast, the prole has these human weaknesses to an extreme degree. He/she must rely upon intuitions and sound prima facie principles <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> as he is incapable of critical thought. The set of intuitive moral rules that the prole follows must be simple and general enough that they can be easily understood and memorised, and also quick and easy to use.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the rockets}} are {{constructed}} {{exactly the same}} way, and starting {{at the same moment}} in S with the same acceleration, they must have the same velocity <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> in S. Thus they are traveling the same distances in S, so their mutual distance cannot change in this frame. Otherwise, if the distance were to contract in S, then this would imply different velocities of the rockets in this frame as well, which contradicts the initial assumption of equal construction and acceleration.|$|E

However, spies often have to work only with available hand-held receivers, sometimes under difficult local conditions, and in all seasons and sunspot cycles.

The first such friendship was with Piers Dunkerley, 13 years old in 1934 when Britten was aged 20. Other boys Britten befriended were the young David Hemmings and Michael Crawford, both of whom sang treble roles in his works in the 1950s. Hemmings later said, [...] "In <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> that I spent with him he never abused that trust", and Crawford wrote [...] "I cannot say enough about the kindness of that great man... he had a wonderful patience and affinity with young people.

30|$|In conclusion, in our humble view, we {{consider}} that taking measurements may be useless in the ED {{and that we}} need to maintain the focus on training and practice moving the needle in favor of basic TTE over advanced TTE.

500|$|A {{common theme}} that appears {{throughout}} Outliers is the [...] "10,000-Hour Rule", {{based on a}} study by Anders Ericsson. Gladwell claims that greatness requires enormous time, using the source of The Beatles' musical talents and Gates' computer savvy as examples. The Beatles performed live in Hamburg, Germany over 1,200 times from 1960 to 1964, amassing more than 10,000 hours of playing time, therefore meeting the 10,000-Hour Rule. Gladwell asserts that <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> The Beatles spent performing shaped their talent, and quotes Beatles' biographer Philip Norman as saying, [...] "So {{by the time they}} returned to England from Hamburg, Germany, 'they sounded like no one else. It was the making of them.'" [...] Gates met the 10,000-Hour Rule when he gained access to a high school computer in 1968 at the age of 13, and spent 10,000 hours programming on it.|$|E
500|$|The {{first series}} {{features}} Christopher Eccleston as the ninth {{incarnation of the}} Doctor, his only series in the role, accompanied by Billie Piper, as his first and main companion Rose Tyler, whom he plucks from obscurity on planet Earth, and to whom he grows increasingly attached. He also travels briefly with unruly boy-genius Adam Mitchell, played by Bruno Langley, and with 51st-century con man and former [...] "Time Agent" [...] Captain Jack Harkness, portrayed by John Barrowman. Episodes in the series form a loose story arc, based upon the recurring phrase [...] "Bad Wolf", the significance of which goes unexplained until the two-part series finale. Alongside the [...] "Bad Wolf" [...] arc, the revived era re-introduces the Doctor as the sole survivor of an event known as the Time War, which the Doctor claims wiped out <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Time</b> Lords and the Daleks.|$|E
500|$|In {{the second}} season, {{production}} used again mostly F55 cameras, paired with Panavision Primo 11:1 zoom, Carl Zeiss Ultra Prime, and Fujinon 19-90mm Cabrio Premier lenses. Ruhlmann {{returned to work}} with McTeigue in Mexico City, Almesberger with Tykwer in Nairobi, and Toll with Lana Wachowski in all the remaining locations. They used a two camera setup (A and B), with the first being nearly <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> Steadicam, and the second being hand-held all the time. Toll explained this setup was necessitated by both their tight schedule and large volume of the material, but also by Lana's commitment {{to stay with the}} A camera operator, Daniele Massaccesi, and make choices as they were filming. Toll further commented on their approach: [...] "We adopted a system of shooting traditional wide master shots and, {{during the course of the}} shot, gracefully moving into other angles and even close-ups at times. Essentially, we were often doing masters and coverage within the same take." ...|$|E

500|$|Stone said he {{felt the}} episode {{solidified}} major characteristics embodied by the Chef character, particularly {{the fact that he}} is one of the only adults in South Park who always understands the truth of any given situation and believes the children almost <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> Stone said, [...] "It's like the parents are all nuts that live in the town. The boys are kind of the most sane and Chef is really the only one in town who believes the kids when they say (something) is happening, when the kids are actually right and it's the town that's crazy." [...] "Pinkeye" [...] was also the first episode in which Liane Cartman, Eric Cartman's mother, was portrayed as a promiscuous woman who was previously a crack whore and is willing to engage in pornographic sex for money; during the episode, she is mentioned and actually featured on the cover of [...] "Crack Whore Magazine", much to Cartman's shock and dismay.|$|E
500|$|A week into filming, Francis {{felt the}} {{infected}} (referred to as [...] "Darkseekers" [...] or [...] "hemocytes" [...] in the script), {{who were being}} portrayed by actors wearing prosthetics, were not convincing. His decision to use CGI resulted in an increased budget and extended post-production, although the end results were not always well received. The concept behind the infected was that their adrenal glands were open <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> and Lawrence explained, [...] "They needed to have an abandon in their performance that you just can't get out {{of people in the}} middle of the night when they're barefoot. And their metabolisms are really spiked, so they're constantly hyperventilating, which you can't really get actors to do for a long time or they pass out." [...] The actors remained on set to provide motion capture. [...] "The film's producers and sound people wanted the creatures in the movie to sound somewhat human, but not the standard", so Mike Patton, lead singer of Faith No More, was engaged to provide the screams and howls of the infected.|$|E
500|$|Jason Corsaro, the record's audio engineer, persuaded Rodgers to use digital recording, a new {{technique}} at the time which Corsaro believed {{was going to be}} the future of recording because test pressings always sounded consistent. To ensure this, Corsaro used a Sony 3324 24-track digital tape recorder and a Sony F1 two-track for the 12-bit mix. Madonna recorded the lead parts in a small, wooden, high-ceilinged piano room at the back of Studio C, also known as Power Station's [...] "R room". Corsaro then placed gobos around her while using the top capsule of a stereo AKG C24 tube microphone, with a Schoeps microphone preamplifier and a Pultec equalizer. Once the track met with everybody's approval, Robert Sabino added the keyboard parts, playing mostly a Sequential Circuits Prophet-5, as well as some Rhodes piano and acoustic piano, while Rodgers also played a Synclavier. Madonna, although not required, was present every minute of the recording sessions and the mixing process, Corsaro commented: [...] "Nile was there most of the time, but she was there <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> She never left".|$|E

500|$|The {{inhabitants}} of Earth are visited by an extraterrestrial named Nitros Oxide, {{who claims to}} be the fastest racer in the galaxy. Challenging Earth to a game called [...] "Survival of the Fastest", he beckons Earth's best driver to race him. If Earth's driver wins, he promises to leave Earth alone, but if Oxide wins, he will turn Earth into a concrete parking lot and enslave the Earthlings. In response, the player character gathers all four Boss Keys needed to access Oxide's spaceship and races him in a one-on-one match. Upon Oxide's defeat {{at the hands of the}} player character, he temporarily leaves Earth, but promises that he will return when <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Time</b> Relics have been gathered. Oxide faces the player again after all the Time Relics are gathered. After losing once more, Oxide keeps his word and angrily leaves Earth forever. An epilogue is relayed during the end credits, explaining what the characters of the game did after the events of the story. Nitros Oxide himself returns to his home planet of Gasmoxia and secludes himself from society. After undergoing years of therapy to cope with his loss, he takes up unicycle-racing, only to get into a gruesome accident.|$|E
