6000|$|... 'You {{are a very}} rude old woman,' {{he cried}} out. 'First you mess all our nice herbs about with your horrid brown fingers and sniff at them with your long nose till {{no one else will}} care to buy them, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> it's all bad stuff, though the duke's cook himself buys all his herbs from us.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "See there," [...] said Dolly, with a woman's tender tact, [...] "she's fondest o' you. She {{wants to}} go o' your lap, I'll be bound.

[...] "It’s awkward {{when you go}} there and say, ’Good-morning,’ and the girl <b>says,</b> ’Good-morning,’ <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> don’t <b>say</b> any more and she don’t say any more.

6000|$|... "Then {{what the}} d---- {{business}} have {{you to go}} about and talk to a girl like that? Marriage not in your line! Who cares for your line? I never heard such impudence in all my life. You get yourself engaged to a young lady of high rank and position <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> that--marriage isn't in your line." [...] Upon that {{he opened his eyes}} still wider, and glared upon the offender wrathfully.|$|E
6000|$|Em.: Fate! Nothing of the sort; it’s only me. You men {{are always}} such fatalists. I {{deferred}} my departure three whole weeks, {{in order to}} come out in the same boat that I saw you were travelling by. I bribed the steward to put out chairs side by side in an unfrequented corner, and I took enormous pains to be looking particularly attractive this morning, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> “This is fate.” I am looking particularly attractive, am I not? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There, I {{told you}} so!" [...] she said, merrily. [...] "It's {{not the least}} bit of use your pretending you're not in love with him, Una. Why, just look how you tremble!

I forget the exact name of the place where he lives, but I've got it in my desk, and I can tell you to-morrow.--Oh, yes; it's Palmyra, on the Canada Pacific. I suppose you want to write to him. Or perhaps you mean to go out and offer {{yourself}} bodily." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes!--About Mr. Hinkle. I a'n't agoin' to {{have you}} lead him on, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> didn't {{know where he was}} goin'. I can't keep runnin' away everywhe'e, fo' you, the way I done at Woodlake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Since {{yesterday}} {{we have come}} off first best against all that a traitorous comrade could do, and I take no little pride in it, though it did happen by accident and was so close a shave that we were within a hair's breadth of being made prisoners. Put that close shave {{by the side of}} what we have done since morning, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> may <b>say</b> with good reason that we have been of service to the Cause." ...|$|R
30|$|I’ll quote Sultan Mohammed Shah {{in one of}} {{his speeches}} to the {{entrepreneurs}} he said that the first thousand days of a business are the really hard ones and you have to stick with it and you have to give, you know, your every piece of your breath if <b>you</b> <b>say</b> and that comprises of three years right. … it’s the fourth year that you show your 100 % and you achieve <b>you</b> aims <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> can <b>say</b> there <b>you</b> go.|$|R
6000|$|Under {{all these}} circumstances, {{do you really}} feel yourselves {{justified}} to break up this government unless such a court decision as yours is shall be at once submitted to as a conclusive and final rule of political action?

6000|$|... "I think La Fleur {{concerns}} herself {{entirely too}} much in the matter," [...] said the lady. [...] "She first came to me, and then she went to you. You have done a good deal for Mrs. Drane in giving her daughter employment, and we cannot be expected to attend to her every need. I do not consider Mrs. Brinkly's house a very pleasant one in hot weather, and I would be glad to do anything I could to establish them more pleasantly, but I know of nothing to do, at least at present; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> they have not complained. From what I have seen of Mrs. Drane, I think she is a very sensible woman, and under the circumstances probably expects some discomforts." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear creature," [...] replied young Protocol, [...] "what {{nonsense}} you talk! I {{saw that}} very humbug in the Magazine. You {{say you have}} made a great discovery--very good; you puff your discovery--very right; you ask money for it--nothing can be more reasonable; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> that you intend to make your discovery public in the next number of the Magazine. Do you think I will be such a fool as to give you money for a thing which I can have next month for nothing? Good-by, George my boy; the NEXT discovery you make I'll tell you how to get a better price for it." [...] And with this the fellow walked off, looking supremely knowing and clever.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Them clean takes, Mr. Scott, {{they never}} lasts. There was water, but that weren't the worst. Old Weazle knew of that; he {{calculated}} he'd back the metal agin the water, {{and so he}} bought all up he could lay his finger on. But the stuff was run out. Them Cambourne boys--what did they do? Why, they let the water in on purpose. By Monday night old Weazle knew it all, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> may <b>say</b> it {{was as good as}} a play.' ...|$|R

"As for the clothes, {{they will}} always be useful, Osgod; but were I you I would get a stout leathern bag and put the purses and rings into it, and bury them in some place known only to yourself, and where none are ever likely to light upon them. You have no {{occasion}} for money now, and we may hope that ere long all occasion for fighting will be over, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> as <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> <b>you</b> can buy a farm and marry." ...|$|R
5000|$|Note {{that this}} is a {{classical}} definition that, while very often used, is not really consistent with modern naming. In more modern language, one would give a metric on the space of continuous (holomorphic) functions that corresponds to convergence on compact subsets <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> would <b>say</b> [...] "precompact set of functions" [...] in such a metric space instead of saying [...] "normal family of continuous (holomorphic) functions". This added generality however makes it more cumbersome to use since one would need to define the metric mentioned above.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{dare say}} that he was angry, but a gentleman who has been called a loafing young scoundrel is {{somewhat}} apt to lose his temper. You might even do so yourself, Mr. Faulkner, if so addressed. Well, then, he made a step towards you; thereupon you struck him in the face, and judging from his appearance you struck him pretty hard, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> he caught you up and carried you along. It says a good deal for his strength {{that he was able to}} do so. Now you say he carried you towards the fire, and would have thrown you upon it had not some of the coast-guardsmen interfered in time. Now, how do you know that that was his intention?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... '"Yes," [...] they say, [...] "we see {{man does}} not know that his room is dirty and full of cobwebs while it is all dark; and another man, whose room is not half so dirty, because the sun shines into it and shows the dirt, thinks his room much worse than the other. That is like our hearts. It is worse now to be angry {{than it was to}} shoot a man a long time ago. But the more the sun shines in, the more we shall find cobwebs and dirt, long after we thought the room was clean. Yes, we know what that means. We asked you what would help us to go on {{straight}} in the path, now that we are entering at the gate. We said prayer, love, helping our countrymen. Now we see besides watchfulness, self-examination; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> we must at once look forward to being confirmed, as the people you confirmed at Norfolk Island. Then there is the very great thing, the holy and the great, the Supper of the Lord." [...] So, evening by evening and day by day, we talk, this being of course not called school, being, indeed, my great relaxation, for this is the time when they are like children with a father.|$|E
6000|$|My friends, my friends, {{as long as}} a man talks so, blaspheming God's world--which, when He made it, behold it was {{all very}} good--and laying the blame of their own ignorance and peevishness on God who made them, they must expect nothing but tribulation and sorrow. But the tribulation and the sorrow will be their own fault, and not God's. If {{religious}} professors will not take St. Peter's advice and the Psalmist's advice; if they will go on coveting and scheming about money, and how they may get money; if they will go on being neither pitiful, courteous, nor forgiving, and hating and maligning whether it be those who differ from them in doctrine, or those who they fancy have injured them, or those who merely are their rivals in the race of life; then they are but too likely to find this world a thorny place, because they themselves raise the thorns; and a disorderly place, because their own tempers and desires are disorderly; and a wilderness, because they themselves have run wild, barbarians at heart, however civilised in dress and outward manners. St. James tells them that of old. [...] "From whence," [...] he says, [...] "come wars and quarrels among you? Come they not hence, even of the lusts which war in your members? You long, and have not. You fight and war, yet you have not, because you ask not. You ask, and have not. You pray for this and that, and God does not give it you. Because you ask amiss, selfishly to consume it on your lusts." [...] <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> This world is an evil place, full of temptations. What says St. James to that? [...] "Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth He any man. But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, my son; let {{me speak}} on to the end, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> can <b>say</b> what <b>you</b> please. In me {{you have had a}} bad example on one side, and now, in poor Saul, you have a bad example on the other side. Can you fancy no life between the two, which would fit your {{physical}} nature, which is larger than his, and your mental wants, which are higher than mine? Yes, they are, Harry. It is my duty to say this, but it would be unseemly that there should be any controversy between us on the subject." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One thing I know," [...] said Marianne, [...] "and that is, I wish I {{had been}} brought up so, and knew all that I should, and had all the {{strength}} and adroitness that those women had. I should not dread to begin housekeeping, as I now do. I should feel myself independent. I should feel that I knew how to direct my servants, {{and what it was}} reasonable and proper to expect of them; <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> as <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> I shouldn't be dependent on all their whims and caprices of temper. I dread those household storms, of all things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let a man commit no fault, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> what <b>you</b> <b>say</b> will be true. I made a mistake, {{and allowed}} myself to be so governed by it as to commit a great injustice. I am aware of it, and I trust I may never repeat it. Such a mistake as that I think that I shall never commit again. But I did it, and I ask you to forgive me." [...] In answer to this she could only embrace him and hang upon him, and implore him in silence to spare her. [...] "So it has been, and I ask your pardon." ...|$|R
6000|$|For instance: {{some people}} think the income-tax is very unfair; and {{therefore}} they {{think there is no}} harm in cheating the revenue a little, by making out their income less than it is. Others, again, think the laws against smuggling unjust and harsh; and therefore they see no harm in trying to avoid paying duty on goods which they bring home, whenever they have an opportunity, or buying cheap goods, which they must know from their price are smuggled. Others, again, think the game laws are unfair, and therefore see no harm in going out shooting on their own lands without a licence; while many see no harm, or say they see no harm, in poaching on other people's grounds, and killing game contrary to law wherever they can. That it is wrong to break the law in these two first cases, you all know in your own hearts. On the matter of poaching, some of you, I know, have many very mistaken notions. But, my friends, I ask you only to look at the sin and misery which poaching causes, {{if you want to see}} that those who break the law do indeed break the ordinance of God, and that God's laws avenge themselves. Look at the idleness, the untidiness, the deceit, the bad company, the drunkenness, the misery and sin, to man, woman, and child, which that same poaching brings about, and then see how one little sin brings on many great ones; how a man, by despising the authority of law, and fancying that he does no harm in disobeying the laws, from his own fancy about poaching being no harm, falls into temptation and a snare, and pierces himself through with many sorrows. My young friends, believe my words. Avoid poaching, even once in a way. The beginning of sin is like the letting out of water; no one can tell where it will stop. He who breaks the law in little things will be tempted to go on and break it in greater and greater things. He who begins by breaking man's law, which is the pattern of God's law, will be tempted to go on and break God's law also. Is it not so? There is no use telling me, [...] "The game is no one's; there is no harm in taking it." [...] Light words of that kind will not do to answer God with. You know there is harm in taking it; for you know, as well as I do, that you cannot go after game without neglecting your work to get it; or without going to the worst of public-houses, among the worst of company, to sell it. You know, as well as I do, that hand in hand with poaching go lying, and idling, and sneaking, and fear, and boasting, and swearing, and drinking, and the company of bad men and bad women. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> there is no harm in poaching. Do you suppose that I do not know, as well as any one of you here, what goes to the snaring of a hare, and the selling of a hare, and the spending of the ill-got price of a hare? My dear young men, I know that poaching, like many other sins, is tempting: but God has told us to flee from temptation--to resist the devil, and he will flee from us. If we are to give up ourselves without a struggle to every pleasant thing which tempts us, we shall soon be at the devil's door. We were sent into the world to fight against temptation and to conquer it. We were sent into the world to do what God likes, not what we like; and therefore we were sent into the world to obey the laws of the land wherein we live, be they better or worse; because if we break one law because we don't like it, our neighbour may break another because he don't like that, and so forth; till there is neither law, nor peace, nor safety, but every man doing what is right in his own eyes, which is sure to end by every man's doing what is right in the devil's eyes. We were sent into the world to live as brothers, under laws which make us give up our own wills and selfish lusts for the common good. And if we find it difficult to keep the laws, if we are tempted to break the laws, God has promised His Spirit to those who ask Him. God has promised His Spirit to us. If we pray for that Spirit night and morning, He will make it easy for us to keep the laws. He will make us what our Lord was before us, humble, patient, loving, manful and strong enough to restrain our fancies and appetites, and to give up our wills for the good of our neighbours, anxious and careful to avoid all appearance of evil, trusting that because God is just, and God is King, all laws which are not wicked are His ordinance, and therefore being obedient to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake, even as Jesus Christ Himself was, who, though He was Lord of all, paid taxes and tribute money to the Roman government, like the rest of the Jews, and kept the law of Moses perfectly, and was baptised with John's baptism, to show that in all just and reasonable things we are to obey the laws and customs of our forefathers, in the country to which it has pleased the Lord that we should belong.|$|E
