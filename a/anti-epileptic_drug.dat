40|$|In {{recent years}} several new <b>anti-epileptic</b> <b>drugs</b> have been introduced, {{also for the}} {{treatment}} of childhood epilepsy. A major concern is their effect on learning and cognitive development. Testing the genuine effects on cognition of the <b>anti-epileptic</b> <b>drugs</b> is methodologically not easy. At this moment there are very few controlled trials that systematically examine the cognitive side effects of <b>anti-epileptic</b> <b>drugs</b> in childhood epilepsy. The available data indicate that the newer <b>anti-epileptic</b> <b>drugs</b> have a safe cognitive profile when prescribed correctly at the right dose and in monotherapy. Possible negative effects are mainly found for speed of processing and attention processes. As these processes are important instruments in every day learning and cognition, it is necessary to test these newer <b>anti-epileptic</b> <b>drugs</b> in well designed studies and in specific childhood epilepsy syndromes. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Epileptic {{seizures}} {{are associated}} with significant morbidity, impaired quality of life, mortality and substantial healthcare costs. Treatment with <b>anti-epileptic</b> <b>drugs</b> is the mainstay of therapy, with pharmacotherapy aiming to achieve seizure freedom or seizure reduction. Given that approximately 30 % of patients are not controlled with monotherapy regimens, adjunctive therapy with multiple <b>anti-epileptic</b> <b>drugs</b> can be envisaged. This article aims to review economic evaluations of <b>anti-epileptic</b> <b>drugs</b> as adjunctive therapy for refractory epilepsy in adult patients. Studies were included if they examined the costs and consequences of different pharmacotherapeutic adjunctive therapies for refractory epilepsy. Uncertainty surrounds the cost-effectiveness of <b>anti-epileptic</b> <b>drugs</b> as adjunctive therapy for refractory epilepsy owing to methodological limitations and design differences between studies. Although cost-effectiveness estimates vary between studies, adjunctive therapy of refractory epilepsy appears to be cost effective, depending on the cost-effectiveness threshold used by pricing/reimbursement agencies. However, {{there is a need}} for more, better-designed and comprehensive economic evaluations of adjunctive therapy for refractory epilepsy with <b>anti-epileptic</b> <b>drugs.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The rich {{behavioural}} repertoire {{of the fetus}} provides a means of assessing central nervous system integrity, and thus {{the well-being of the}} fetus. Pregnancy in women with epilepsy is associated with a higher risk of congenital malformation and long-term developmental delay. The cause of these risks is thought to be the <b>anti-epileptic</b> <b>drugs</b> that women with epilepsy continue to take during pregnancy to prevent seizures. This thesis, using fetal behaviour as a diagnostic tool, studied the effect of the anti-epileptic drugs; Carbamazepine, Lamotrigine and Valproate on the fetal behaviour. The spontaneous behaviour and the habituation response of the fetus were examined at 12 - 15, 18 - 22, 31 and 37 weeks of gestation in two groups of mothers; those mothers with epilepsy taking <b>anti-epileptic</b> <b>drugs</b> and a control group of mothers not having epilepsy and thus not taking <b>anti-epileptic</b> <b>drugs.</b> Further analyses examined the effects of the specific drug; mothers were taking Carbamazepine, Lamotrigine or Valproate with a group of mothers not taking <b>anti-epileptic</b> <b>drugs.</b> There was {{a significant difference between the}} fetuses in the Carbamazepine group and the control group higher at 12 - 15 weeks gestation. Total activity was significantly higher in the Carbamazepine group compared with fetuses not exposed to <b>anti-epileptic</b> <b>drugs.</b> Mean mouth movement scores were significantly lower at 18 - 22 weeks in fetuses exposed to Carbamazepine. Habituation performance was significantly different for the fetuses exposed to Carbamazepine at 31 weeks gestation. The. fetuses exposed to Carbamazepine showed a poorer habituation performance. Postnatally children who had been exposed Valproate scored significantly lower in both the mental and psychomotor developmental index scores of the Bayleys scale of Infant Development than children who had not been exposed to <b>anti-epileptic</b> <b>drugs.</b> <b>Anti-epileptic</b> <b>drugs</b> were observed to affect the behaviour of the fetus, suggestive of an effect on the central nervous system.

5000|$|Work on the {{ketogenic}} diet as {{a treatment}} for epilepsy have investigated the role of glycolysis in the disease. 2-Deoxyglucose has been proposed by Garriga-Canut et al. as a mimic for the ketogenic diet, and shows great promise as a new <b>anti-epileptic</b> <b>drug.</b> [...] The authors suggest that 2-DG works, in part, by increasing the expression of Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), Nerve growth factor (NGF), Arc (protein) (ARC), and Basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2). Such uses are {{complicated by the fact that}} 2-deoxyglucose does have some toxicity.|$|E
50|$|Palinopsia from {{cerebrovascular}} accidents generally resolves spontaneously, and treatment should {{be focused on}} the vasculopathic risk factors. Palinopsia from neoplasms, AVMs, or abscesses require treatment of the underlying condition, which usually also resolves the palinopsia. Palinopsia due to seizures generally resolves after correcting the primary disturbance and/or treating the seizures. In persistent hallucinatory palinopsia, a trial of an <b>anti-epileptic</b> <b>drug</b> can be attempted. Anti-epileptics reduce cortical excitability and could potentially treat palinopsia caused by cortical deafferentation or cortical irritation. Patients with idiopathic hallucinatory palinopsia should have close follow-up.|$|E

There has therefore been a need for new <b>anti-epileptic</b> <b>drugs,</b> and the past decade has seen the licensing of eight new drugs worldwide, although these drugs have made little impact on the prognosis of refractory epilepsy.

50|$|Hemeralopia {{is known}} to occur in several ocular conditions. Cone {{dystrophy}} and achromatopsia, affecting the cones in the retina, and the <b>anti-epileptic</b> <b>drug</b> Trimethadione are typical causes. Adie's pupil which fails to constrict in response to light; Aniridia, which is absence of the iris; Albinism where the iris is defectively pigmented may also cause this. Central Cataracts, due to the lens clouding, disperses the light before it can reach the retina, is a common cause of hemeralopia and photoaversion in elderly. C.A.R (Cancer Associated Retinopathy) seen when certain cancers incite the production of deleterious antibodies against retinal components, may cause hemeralopia.|$|E

5000|$|Bromide was {{introduced}} {{as the first}} <b>anti-epileptic</b> <b>drug</b> 150 years ago. Because of the adverse effects mentioned above, bromide is not currently in use as an AED. Early treatment discontinuation was occurring far too frequently and eventually resulted in negative effects on several patients. Current treatment options include phenytoin, valproic acid, ethosuximide, and the new anti-epileptic drugs. Over the past 20 years, 15 new anti-epileptic drugs with positive outcomes have been introduced to the public. These new AEDs are aimed at improving the cost-benefit balance in AED therapy, improving tolerability profiles and reducing potential for drug interaction. [...] Despite these major advances, there is always room for improvement, especially regarding the tailored treatment of individuals who have suffered adverse effects from older AEDs.|$|E

50|$|Levetiracetam is an <b>anti-epileptic</b> <b>drug</b> {{than can}} be used to treat partial and {{generalized}} seizures. Levetiracetam inhibits P/Q channel-mediated glutamate release and decreases the excitatory post synaptic currents of both AMPA and NMDA receptors in the hippocampus, specifically the dentate gyrus, which is known to propagate seizure activities. The inhibition of glutamate release results in an anti-epileptic response in patients because it decreases the excitatory postsynaptic current. There are many different types of calcium channels, so to prove that the P/Q type calcium channels are directly involved, a P/Q type voltage gated calcium channel inhibitor, omega-agatoxin TK, was used to block the channel. When blocked, patients no longer benefited from the anti-epileptic effects from the drugs. When blockers for L type and N type calcium channels were used, the effects of Levetiracetam were still seen. This is strong evidence that the P/Q type calcium channels are involved in the Levetiracetam treatment which allow for relief from seizures.|$|E
40|$|SummaryThere is {{emerging}} {{evidence to support}} the unfavorable effects of some anti-epileptic drugs on the plasma homocysteine concentrations. Elevated homocysteine levels induced by <b>anti-epileptic</b> <b>drug</b> administration can theoretically increase not only the risk of vascular occlusive diseases, but also the risk of resistance to anti-epileptics and development of refractory epilepsy. To investigate the effect of common anti-epileptic drugs on the homocysteine metabolism, a total of 75 epileptic patients receiving phenytoin (n= 16), carbamazepine (n= 19), or valproic acid (n= 22) and no <b>anti-epileptic</b> <b>drug</b> (n= 18) were enrolled. Eleven age- and sex-matched healthy subjects served as the control group. Blood concentrations of homocysteine, folic acid, Vitamin B 12 and pyridoxal 5 ′-phosphate (active circulating form of Vitamin B 6) were measured. Compared to the control group, epileptic patients on <b>anti-epileptic</b> <b>drug</b> had higher blood levels of homocysteine. No difference in homocysteine concentrations was observed among epileptic patients in terms of the <b>anti-epileptic</b> <b>drug</b> used. Patients receiving phenytoin had significantly lower folic acid levels and those receiving carbamazepine had marginally lower pyridoxal 5 ′-phosphate levels in comparison with those using other anti-epileptic drugs. A negative correlation between homocysteine and folic acid concentrations was detected in epileptic patients on <b>anti-epileptic</b> <b>drug.</b> The duration of <b>anti-epileptic</b> <b>drug</b> use was correlated to the decrease of folic acid levels, but not with changes observed in homocysteine, Vitamin B 12 and pyridoxal 5 ′-phosphate levels. No relationship between seizure frequency and homocysteine levels was observed in epileptic patients. Our results confirm that common anti-epileptic drugs has disadvantageous effects on homocysteine status. Because there was no significant change in homocysteine concentrations in epileptic patients who were not receiving an <b>anti-epileptic</b> <b>drug,</b> and no positive correlation between seizure frequency and homocysteine levels, we suggest that increase of homocysteine levels may be due to <b>anti-epileptic</b> <b>drug</b> use, rather than being epileptic in origin. Additionally, the underlying mechanism for homocysteine increase seems to be a decrease of cofactor molecules in patients using carbamazepine and phenytoin (pyridoxal 5 ′-phosphate and folic acid, respectively). However, changes observed are not related to the alteration in the levels of cofactors and remain unclear in the patients using valproic acid...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroductionBilateral femoral neck {{fractures}} without major trauma {{are rare}} {{and related to}} several conditions. Insufficiency fractures due {{to the use of}} <b>anti-epileptic</b> <b>drug</b> are one of the rare causes. This case study is about bilateral femoral neck insufficiency fractures resulting from chronic use of <b>anti-epileptic</b> <b>drug.</b> Presentation of caseA 26 -year-old woman was referred to our emergency department with a complaint of bilateral groin pain and a 12 -year history of irregular carbamazepine use. The diagnosis was bilateral femoral neck insufficiency fractures due to irregular long-term carbamazepine use. One-stage bilateral dynamic hip screw osteosynthesis was performed. After 2 years of follow up, good result was obtained. DiscussionThere are several risk factors for insufficiency fracture, and antiepileptic drug related osteoporosis is one of the reason. These drugs have negative effect on bone methabolism and bone mineral density. ConclusionTo our knowledge, this is the first case in the literature of bilateral femoral neck insufficiency fracture due to chronic carbamazepine use. Joint and bone pain with a history of long-term use of <b>anti-epileptic</b> <b>drug</b> should be investigated carefully, and insufficiency fractures should be kept in mind...|$|E
