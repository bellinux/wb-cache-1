50|$|The Hammerstone Quarry Project had {{approximately}} 1 billion tonnes(MegaQuarry) of proven and probable limestone reserves, {{making it}} the largest Quarry in Canada, for use to meet the projected demands for limestone and limestone products in the Athabasca region to the year 2060, {{where there is a}} known shortage of quality aggregate and limestone materials. The expansion was to include the <b>aggregate</b> <b>quarry,</b> a lime plant and cement plant. In the 2006 EIA report, Birch Mountain Resources estimated that the Project construction cost would be about $674 million (2006 dollars). Construction was initially proposed to start in 2006 and was targeted for completion in 2040. Birch Mountain Resources modified the processing plant design in 2007 and the resulting construction cost was revised to $578 million. Later, after the transfer of assets to Hammerstone Corp, a subsidiary of Brookfield Asset Management Special Situations Group, indicated that current cost estimates were used in 2009 to amend the Project construction cost to $737 million. Limestone products were to include construction aggregate for concrete and asphalt, as well as limestone-based products for cement and flue-gas desulphurization(FGD) for the oil sands extraction process.|$|E
50|$|Following the 1987 {{conversion}} to burn coal, the Point Tupper Generating Station was supplied almost exclusively with coal mined from the Sydney Coal Field {{by the federal}} Crown corporation mining company Cape Breton Development Corporation (DEVCO); the coal being delivered to Point Tupper by trains operated first by Canadian National Railway (CN) and after 1993 by the Cape Breton and Central Nova Scotia Railway (CBNS). During the late 1990s, DEVCO began experiencing production shortfalls that led to Nova Scotia Power being forced to import foreign-mined coal from the United States and South America. This coal was delivered to a pier near the Canso Causeway in Aulds Cove adjacent to an <b>aggregate</b> <b>quarry</b> operated by Martin Marietta Materials and loaded onto rail cars for delivery to the Trenton Generating Station {{as well as to}} the Point Tupper Generating Station. In fall 2001, DEVCO shut down its remaining mine in the Sydney Coal Field, forcing Nova Scotia Power to import all coal for its remaining power plants in the Sydney region; NSP purchased all the surface assets from DEVCO, including the International Pier coal terminal on Sydney Harbour which was used to supply the Lingan Generating Station and Point Aconi Generating Station, however it continued to import coal for Trenton and Point Tupper through Aulds Cove to lessen the distance coal for these plants had to travel by rail.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{discoveries of}} an archaeological site near {{a complex of}} an <b>aggregate</b> <b>quarry</b> and a {{concrete}} plant {{on the island of}} Andros, Greece, have caused considerable controversy. More specifically, the continued operation of the <b>aggregate</b> <b>quarry</b> and concrete making plant was questioned, after the discovery of an important Neolithic settlement {{in the vicinity of the}} plants. The relocation of the quarry and the concrete plant is not an easy task, due to the touristic character of the island, as well as the great number of other antiquities found all over the island. On the other hand, the closure of the plant would have had significant implications on the island's economy. In the light of this situation, the symbiosis of these two different activities has been examined.

40|$|More than 80 {{million tonnes}} of {{construction}} aggregate are produced in Peninsular Malaysia. Majority of construction aggregate are produced from granite. Developing regions of Johor Bahru, Kuala Lumpur, Penang and Selangar utilize granite aggregates. Normally {{it is considered}} aggregates as non-alkali reactive. Geological study can identify various rock types, geological structures, and reactive minerals which contribute to Alkali Silica Reaction (ASR). Deformed granites formed through faulting results in reduction of quartz grain size. Microcrystalline quartz and phyllosilicates are found in granites in contact with country rocks. Secondary reactive minerals such as chalcedony and opal {{may be found in}} granite. Alkali Silica reaction is slow chemical reaction in concrete due to reactive silica minerals in aggregates, alkalis in cement and moisture. For long term durable concrete, it is essential to identify potential alkali silica reactive aggregates. Lack of identifying reactive aggregates may result spalling, cracking in concrete and ultimately ASR can result in hazard to concrete structure. This paper deals with geological study of any <b>aggregate</b> <b>quarry</b> to identify rock type and geological structures with laboratory test âpetrographic analysis and bar mortar test can identify type of aggregates being produced. Mine plan with Surpac software can be developed for systematic working for <b>aggregate</b> <b>quarry</b> to meet construction aggregate demand...|$|E

40|$|The dynamic {{properties}} of soil are normally inferred from laboratory tests on collected samples or from empirical relations. The soil properties {{measured in the}} field can {{be very different from}} those predicted from laboratory tests. It is very difficult to determine directly in the field the variation of the shear modulus and damping with the level of excitation (level of strains). This remains today a major gap in our knowledge and our ability to conduct reliable seismic analyses. The main objective {{of this study is to}} assess the feasibility of determining reliably in situ the shear modulus and damping of the soil as functions of the level of strains, developing a method to compute these properties from the measured data and providing practical recommendations for the use of the procedure. To achieve this objective, extensive and comprehensive sets of experimental and analytical studies were conducted in parallel. Some numerical analyses were performed to provide a better understanding for performing in situ tests with the newly developed vibroseis loading systems. In addition, the dynamic response of a surface foundation in vertical vibration were studied. This dissertation mostly focuses on the numerical aspects of the problem while some experimental data are also studied and utilized. Field tests were conducted to estimate shear moduli of silty sands at two sites, the Capital <b>Aggregate</b> <b>Quarry</b> and the Texas A&M University sites. Estimated nonlinear shear moduli presented very consistent trends regardless of the analysis methods and test sites. They showed larger elastic threshold shear strains, 1. 5 ? 10 ? 3 % for the Capital <b>Aggregate</b> <b>Quarry</b> site and 2 ? 10 ? 3 % for the Texas A&M University site, than the mean of shear modulus curve for cohesionless soils proposed by Seed and Idriss (1970). Estimated moduli closely followed the mean of Seed and Idriss (1970) at strains larger than 6 ? 10 ? 3 % for both sites. Internal damping ratio can also be estimated if additional data are gathered from in situ tests in the future...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{case history}} {{describes}} the instrumentation {{of a house}} near an <b>aggregate</b> <b>quarry</b> to assess the effect of changes in blast design on the house response. Velocity response was measured for the superstructure as well as walls and ceilings. Micrometer response of three cracks was measured as well. In all some 11 velocity transducers and 3 crack sensors measured excitation and response for each blast. Dynamic response of these cracks was compared to various measures of ground and/or structure motion to determine those with the best correlation. Variations in the ground motion and air pressure wave (air blast) reflected changes in the blast design. In addition dynamic crack response was compared to the long-term, weather induced crack response {{as well as the}} changes in temperature and humidity that produced the response. The study confirms the domination of long-term, weather induced crack response compared to the dynamic response produced by blast-induced phenomena...|$|E
