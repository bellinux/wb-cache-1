50|$|The {{minimum age}} for a solo glider flight in the UK is 14. A driving licence is {{adequate}} evidence of medical fitness for solo flight. Failing this a medical certificate is required from the pilot's own doctor, {{to the same}} standard as a provisional driving licence, unless the pilot has no higher certificate such as the JAA Class 2 medical needed by PPLs. Gliding in the UK is regulated by the British Gliding Association (BGA) and by its member clubs. Training is based on standards defined by the BGA and is conducted by instructors who have been trained on its courses. Further practical training is required after solo, plus a multiple choice test, before a pilot is given an endorsement to fly cross-country. Most flights do not require radio contact with <b>air</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>control</b> <b>units,</b> but some pilots obtain a radio operator's licence should that eventuality arise.|$|R

The entire site transferred to the army soon after and {{for the duration of the}} Cold War was used by 2 Signals Brigade from the UK Land Forces at Wilton.
