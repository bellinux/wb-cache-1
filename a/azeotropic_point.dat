40|$|Abstract. Wet cassava pulp is {{generated}} in large quantity during {{a production of}} cassava starch. Major utilization of the pulp is in animal feed manufacturing. During a period of low demand, this material could accumulate and decompose causing air pollution in areas surround the starch factories. This research used biomass desiccant prepared from cassava pulp in a bench-scale packed-bed adsorption system to study the dehydration of ethanol and n-propanol vapor at concentration near their <b>azeotropic</b> <b>points.</b> The sorption capacity {{was found to be}} 0. 053 and 0. 119 gwater/gdesiccant for ethanol and iso-propanol at concentration of 80 %(w/w) and 0. 109 gwater/gdesiccant for n-propanol at concentration of 65 %(w/w). Alcoholic solutions with concentration higher than their aqueous <b>azeotropic</b> <b>points,</b> which could not be achieved by normal fractional distillation, were obtained in all the experiments. This study elucidates that cassava pulp could be value-added, and water adsorption using cassava-derived desiccant could be an alternative technique for production of high purity alcohols...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Azeotropic</b> <b>points</b> {{can create}} so called {{distillation}} regions separated by border lines from other regions. If {{the composition of}} a feed lies inside a specific region a residue curve cannot cross a border line and stays in its initial region. This means for a distillation tower {{that it is not}} possible to obtain pure components at the bottom and the head of the column. At least at one outlet an azeotropic mixture is obtained.|$|R
5000|$|Residue curves {{start at}} the {{composition}} of a feed and then move to pure components or azeotropic points with higher temperatures (isobaric condition) or lower vapor pressures (isothermal condition). This happens because more of the light boiling substances are vaporized than of the high boiling substances and therefore the concentration of the high boilers increase in the liquid phase. A residue curve can also be constructed backwards and then moves to the <b>azeotropic</b> <b>point</b> or pure component with lower temperatures or higher vapor pressure.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{parameters}} are relevant {{in the composition}} of the polymer product; namely, one must consider the reactivity ratio of each component. Reactivity ratios describe whether the monomer reacts preferentially with a segment of the same type or of the other type. For example, a reactivity ratio that is less than one for component 1 indicates that this component reacts with the other type of monomer more readily. Given this information, which is available for a multitude of monomer combinations in the “Wiley Database of Polymer Properties”, the Mayo-Lewis equation can be used to predict the composition of the polymer product for all initial mole fractions of monomer. This equation is derived using the Markov model, which only considers the last segment added as affecting the kinetics of the next addition; the Penultimate Model considers the second-to-last segment as well, but is more complicated than is required for most systems. When both reactivity ratios are less than one, there is an <b>azeotropic</b> <b>point</b> in the Mayo-Lewis plot. At this point, the mole fraction of monomer equals the composition of the component in the polymer.|$|E
50|$|In {{mixtures}} of substances, the bubble {{point is the}} saturated liquid temperature, whereas the saturated vapor temperature is called the dew point. Because the bubble and dew lines of a zeotropic mixture's temperature-composition diagram do not intersect, a zeotropic mixture in its liquid phase has a different fraction of a component than the gas phase of the mixture. On a temperature-composition diagram, after a mixture in its liquid phase is heated to the temperature at the bubble (boiling) curve, the fraction of a component in the mixture changes along an isothermal line connecting the dew curve to the boiling curve as the mixture boils. At any given temperature, {{the composition of the}} liquid is the composition at the bubble point, whereas the composition of the vapor is the composition at the dew point. Unlike azeotropic mixtures, there is no <b>azeotropic</b> <b>point</b> at any temperature on the diagram where the bubble line and dew lines would intersect. Thus, the composition of the mixture will always change between the bubble and dew point component fractions upon boiling from a liquid to a gas until the mass fraction of a component reaches 1 (i.e. the zeotropic mixture is completely separated into its pure components). As shown in Figure 1, the mole fraction of component 1 decreases from 0.4 to around 0.15 as the liquid mixture boils to the gas phase.|$|E

They suggested modifying the mole fraction summation such that the same set of governing equations becomes valid for all phase regions. Thanks to judicious additional switch equations, the τ-formulation is extended to dynamic simulation and the minimization problem is transformed into a set of differential algebraic equations (DAE).

A third-order free energy expression in the electric field strength is established, and the dielectric constant is calculated for a needle shaped sample parallel to the field direction. We present and discuss vapor-liquid and liquid-liquid equilibrium curves at a given temperature for some dipolar mixtures exposed to an electric field, including chlorodifluoromethane+difluoromethane and acetonitrile+methanol.

Process feasibility is assessed from the isovolatility curves and the volatility order diagram. It tells us whether the homogeneous original component or the heteroazeotrope is drawn at the column top and establishes the distillation tasks sequence using a batch rectifying column. The theoretical insights are validated via rigourous simulation for {{the separation of the}} mixture acetonitrile – water with hexylamine or butyl acetate.

40|$|Estimating {{reactivity}} ratios in multicomponent polymerizations {{is becoming}} increasingly important. At the same time, using cumulative models is becoming imperative, as some multicomponent systems are inherently so fast that instantaneous "approximate" models can not be used. In {{the first part of}} the thesis, triad fractions (sequence length characteristics) are employed in a multiresponse scenario, investigating different error structures and levels. A comparison is given between instantaneous triad fraction models and instantaneous composition model, which represent the current state-of-the-art. In the second part of the thesis, extensions are discussed with cumulative composition and triad fraction models over the whole conversion range, thus relating the problem of reactivity ratio estimation to the optimal design of experiments (i. e. optimal sampling) over polymerization time and conversion. The performance of cumulative multiresponse models is superior to that of their instantaneous counterparts, which can be explained from an information content point of view.

The method may be applied to the investigation of any binary system where the separation of the contributions of each component to the recorded IR spectra is possible. Although the dynamic configuration of the TG-FTIR experiments causes the method to be less accurate than conventional techniques, its main advantage is the very limited amount of sample required for experimental runs (< 30 mul per run). The methodology proved to be potentially useful for a preliminary investigation of the possibility of separation by distillation methods of binary homogeneous mixtures.

The adsorbent was prepared from the Na-form of a bentonite from Milos by reaction with polyhydroxoaluminium solutions. The adsorption behaviour of the pillared montmorillonite was characterized by the adsorption excess isotherms and the heats of immersion. Sorption capacities and wetting properties differed significantly from those of the Na-montmorillonite. Benzene was adsorbed preferentially from mixtures with n-heptane. Ethanol and propanol were also preferentially adsorbed from mixtures with cyclohexane and toluene but the curves showed <b>azeotropic</b> <b>points</b> at molar fractions of alcohols of 0. 7 - 0. 9.

40|$|ESAT 2014. 27 th European Symposium on Applied Thermodynamics, Eindhoven University of Technology, July 6 - 9, 2014. Thermodynamic {{models have}} been used for decades to {{formulate}} the activity coefficients of the components of non-ideal liquid mixtures in phase equilibrium calculations. Additionally, the use of topological analysis and constrains have been applied with success in the characterization and simultaneous correlation of complex phase equilibrium including condensed phases: Liquid-Liquid, Liquid-Solid, Liquid-Liquid-Solid and Liquid-Liquid-Hydrated Solid. In a recent paper, we presented the results of a systematic topological study of the Gibbs energy of mixing (gM) as a function of composition and showed that the NRTL model exhibits “gaps” or regions where solutions of the NRTL model for miscible binaries do not exist. But what is more important is that the gaps themselves are responsible for the poor correlation of the LLE and VLE data of many systems. On the other hand, the Perry Handbook of Chemical Engineering presents 125 possible theoretical types of ternary systems regarding the distillation boundaries for systems involving up to three binary azeotropes and one ternary azeotrope. The schematic maps for the distillation boundaries are presented, stating that: “residue curves can be constructed from experimental data or can be calculated analytically if equations-of-state or activity-coefficient expressions are available…”. Nevertheless, an initial analysis of these maps reveals that there are many of these theoretical VLE behaviors that equations as Wilson or NRTL cannot predict. Thus, the objective of the present paper is to analyze the topology of the Gibbs energy of mixing and the behavior of its composition derivatives, in relation to the corresponding VL and LL phase equilibrium conditions such as the minor common tangent plane, and the existence and characteristics of <b>azeotropic</b> <b>points</b> and distillation boundaries...|$|R

40|$|The {{convective}} drying of thin {{layers of}} multicomponentliquid mixtures into an inert gas, {{and the influence}} ofdifferent process controlling mechanisms on drying selectivityis studied. Drying experiments under gas-phase-controlledconditions are performed by low intensity evaporation, fromfree liquid surfaces, of ternary mixtures without non-volatilesolutes. Liquid-side-controlled experiments are carried out bydrying a multicomponent polymeric solution containing twovolatile components, one non-volatile polymer and an optionalnonvolatile softening substance. Mathematical models to describe gas- andliquid-side-controlled drying based on interactive diffusion inboth liquid and gas phases as the main mechanisms for masstransfer are developed. For gas-phase-controlled drying, astability analysis of the ordinary differential equations thatdescribes the evaporation process is performed. Isothermal andnon-isothermal drying processes are considered in batch andcontinuous modes. The mathematical model to describe thecomposition profiles during batch drying of the polymeric film,considering liquid resistance, is solved numerically. Due tothe lack of experimental data, properties for this polymericsystem are estimated by using established methods. Ananalytical solution of the diffusion equation, by assuming anisothermal drying process and a constant matrix ofmulticomponent diffusion coefficients is developed. For thecontinuous case, liquid-side resistance is studied by modellingevaporation of a multicomponent falling liquid film into aninert gas including indirect heating. The results of the gas-phase-controlled model are in goodagreement with experimental results. For the polymeric film,the agreement is only qualitative since the model does notaccount for a membrane that develops on the film surface. Thestability analysis permits the prediction of trajectories andfinal state of a liquid mixture in a gas-phase-controlleddrying process. For isothermal evaporation of ternary mixturesinto pure gas, the solutions are trajectories in the phaseplane represented by a triangular diagram of compositions. Thepredicted ternary dynamic <b>azeotropic</b> <b>points</b> are unstable orsaddle. On the other hand, binary azeotropes are stable whenthe combination of the selectivities of the correspondingcomponents is negative. In addition, pure component singularpoints are stable when they are contained within theirrespective isolated negative selectivity zones. Undernon-isothermal conditions, maximum temperature valuescharacterise stable azeotropes. Incremental loading of the gaswith {{one or more of}} the components leads to a node-saddlebifurcation, where a saddle azeotrope and a stable azeotropecoalesce and disappear. For continuous drying, the singularpoints are infinite and represent dynamic equilibrium pointswhose stability is mainly dependent on the ratio of inletgas-to-liquid flow rates. As long as the process isgas-phasecontrolled, these results also apply to a porous solidcontaining a liquid mixture. In general, liquid-side control makes the drying processless selective but it is difficult to maintain this conditionduring the whole process. Under the influence of its owndynamics, a process starting as liquid-side-controlled tendstowards a gas-phase-controlled process. The presence ofnon-volatile components and indirect heating may delay thisdevelopment.
