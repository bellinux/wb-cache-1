5|$|Rwanda is {{a country}} of few natural resources, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> based mostly on {{subsistence}} agriculture by local farmers using simple tools. An estimated 90% of the working population farms, and agriculture constituted an estimated 32.5% of GDP in 2014. Farming techniques are basic, with small plots of land and steep slopes.

2500|$|President Barack Obama {{signed the}} American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 in February 2009; the bill {{provides}} $787billion in stimulus {{through a combination}} of spending and tax cuts.

However, most economists do not think such [...] "crowding out" [...] is an issue when interest rates are near zero <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> stagnant.
