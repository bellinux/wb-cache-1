25|$|The {{strength}} of the Japanese forces was greatly weakened, as their naval supply lines had been cut and they had lost most of their existing supplies at Driniumor River. While the usual size of a Japanese Army division in wartime was 20,000 troops, {{at the start of}} May, 1945, this had been reduced to only around 1000. Takenaga's unit was no exception: while it was a battalion in name, in terms of numbers it was on the scale of a platoon, and <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> with only around half the usual number of infantry. The rest of the unit was made up of former mountain artillery from the 41st Division, whose squads were disbanded when all of their guns were destroyed at Driniumor River, and marines, among others. Takenaga himself was an artillery specialist, and had been moved to the 239th Infantry Regiment from his post as commander of the 3rd Battalion, 41st Mountain Artillery Regiment. The 18th Army had predicted that their food and medicine would run out by September, 1945, and that their weapons would become unusable {{by the end of the}} year. The situation was bad enough that in July the 18th Army gave the order (18th Army Order No. 371) that the entirety of its forces should adhere to gyokusai, or honourable death without surrender, a move unprecedented even among the Imperial Army. One second lieutenant reflected that in the final stages of the campaign, the army had stopped being an army and had become a band of beggars.|$|E
2500|$|The {{pattern of}} {{increasing}} shear wave splitting time-delays {{is typical of}} the increase now seen before many earthquakes in Iceland and elsewhere. [...] The time delays just before earthquakes characteristically decrease immediately following the eruption because the majority of the stress is released <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> time. The increase in normalized time-delays in volcanic eruptions does not decrease {{at the time of the}} eruption but gradually declines at about [...] over several. This decrease is approximately linear and there appeared to be no other significant magmatic disturbances during the period following the eruption.|$|E
2500|$|Bo Jackson {{became a}} popular figure for his athleticism in {{multiple}} sports {{through the late}} 1980s and early 1990s. He served as a spokesman for Nike and {{was involved in a}} popular ad campaign called [...] "Bo Knows" [...] which envisioned Jackson attempting to take up a litany of other sports, including tennis, golf, luge, auto racing, and even playing blues music with Bo Diddley, who scolded Jackson by telling him, [...] "You don't know diddley!" [...] (in a later version of the spot, Jackson is shown playing the guitar expertly, after which an impressed Diddley says, [...] "Bo...you do know Diddley, don't you?") Serendipitously, the original spot first aired during the commercial break immediately following Jackson's lead-off home run in the 1989 Major League Baseball All-Star Game (as Vin Scully exclaimed, [...] "Look <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>one!</b> Bo Jackson says hello!").|$|E

2500|$|Jackson {{began to}} show his true {{potential}} in 1989, when he was voted to start for the American League All-Star team, and was named the game's MVP for his play on both offense and defense. In {{the top of the}} first inning, he caught Pedro Guerrero's 2-out line drive to left-center field to save two runs. Then he led off the bottom of the first—his first All-Star plate appearance—with a monstrous [...] home run off Rick Reuschel of the San Francisco Giants. NBC-TV announcer Vin Scully exclaimed, [...] "Look <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>one!</b> Bo Jackson says hello!" [...] Wade Boggs followed with his own home run, making them the first pair in All-Star history to lead off their sides first with back-to-back home runs. In the 2nd inning, he beat out the throw on a potential double play to drive in the eventual winning run. He then stole second base, making him the second player in All-Star Game history to hit a home run and steal a base in the same game (the first was Willie Mays). Jackson finished the game with two hits in four at-bats, one run scored, and two RBI.|$|E
