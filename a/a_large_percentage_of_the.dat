5|$|<b>A</b> <b>large</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{people killed}} by brain trauma do not die right away but rather {{days to weeks}} after the event; rather than {{improving}} after being hospitalized, some 40% of TBI patients deteriorate. Primary brain injury (the damage that occurs {{at the moment of}} trauma when tissues and blood vessels are stretched, compressed, and torn) is not adequate to explain this deterioration; rather, it is caused by secondary injury, a complex set of cellular processes and biochemical cascades that occur in the minutes to days following the trauma. These secondary processes can dramatically worsen the damage caused by primary injury and account for the greatest number of TBI deaths occurring in hospitals.|$|E
5|$|By 1931, {{more than}} 80percent of the {{services}} offered by industrial laundries were sold to individual families. However, as the Great Depression continued, many people {{could no longer afford}} the services, and business declined. The decline continued after World War II when electric washers and dryers meant for home use became affordable to <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> populace. As individual customers disappeared, factory laundries turned to specialized services such as washing diapers or linens. In 1950, the American Linen Supply Company bought the Yale Laundry Company. In 1959, Perfect Fit Manufacturing began to use the building to make auto seat covers, tire covers, and other automotive fabrics. Perfect Fit remained in the building through 2006.|$|E

5|$|In arid climates, {{the main}} source of erosion is wind. The general wind {{circulation}} moves small particulates such as dust across wide oceans thousands of kilometers downwind of their point of origin, which is known as deflation. Westerly winds in the mid-latitudes of the planet drive the movement of ocean currents from west to east across the world's oceans. Wind has a very important role in aiding plants and other immobile organisms in dispersal of seeds, spores, pollen, etc. Although wind is not the primary form of seed dispersal in plants, it provides dispersal for <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> biomass of land plants.|$|E
5|$|In chapter eleven, History, Wade {{demonstrates}} how genetics {{can be related}} to recorded history. An example given is the substantial genetic legacy of Genghis Khan and his male relatives. History correlates with this, as writers of the period stated that he had hundreds of wives. Wade then covers the origins of the British; contrary to popular belief, he writes, neither the Anglo-Saxons nor the Vikings eradicated the indigenous population, as the Y chromosomes common to Celtic speakers are carried by <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> male population of Britain. Markers in these Y chromosomes can be linked to the Basques, and he suggests that the British and Irish descend from a refuge in Spain they shared during the Last Glacial Maximum.|$|E

5|$|The sand whiting is an inshore species, inhabiting exposed {{coastal areas}} such as beaches, sandbars and surf zones as well as quieter bays, {{estuaries}} and coastal lakes. Sand whiting enter estuaries, including intermittently open ones, and penetrate far upstream to the tidal limits of rivers and creeks where juveniles and adolescent fish may be abundant. The adults congregate around the mouths of estuaries, bars, and spits, in depths down to 5 m where they may constitute <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> icthyofauna of such regions. As implied by their name, they are often found exclusively over sandy substrates, with occasional appearances in Zostera seagrass beds.

A conglomerate body of governments known as the Citadel Council controls <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> galaxy and is responsible for maintaining law and order among races of the galactic community. Races that belong to the Citadel Council include humans, asari, salarians and turians. Other alien races seen in the game include the reptilian krogan and drell, the environmental suited quarians, and a hostile race of networked artificial intelligences called geth. During the events of the original Mass Effect, a geth army attempted to open a portal for the Reapers, a highly advanced machine race of synthetic-organic starships that are believed to eradicate all organic civilization every 50,000 years. The galactic community has since lived in fear of another possible invasion. Meanwhile, a human supremacist organization called Cerberus believes that humans deserve a greater role in the galactic community and supports the principle that any methods of advancing humanity's ascension are entirely justified, including illegal experimentation and terrorist activities.|$|E

The team is after Nathan Zeigler, an independent researcher who has been captured by a Hong Kong triad gang led {{by a man named}} Killian. Joanna and her father successfully rescue Zeigler, but Killian manages to escape. Zeigler explains that Killian was trying to obtain his research, which contains information about a dangerous weapon. As Zeigler refuses to go anywhere without his research, Joanna is sent to retrieve it while her father stays with Zeigler. After Joanna retrieved a case with Zeigler's research from a nearby safe house, Zeigler takes a device called a neurodrive from the case and uses it to implant his research data into Jack's mind. Afterwards, Zeigler succumbs to his injuries sustained by Killian and dies. Before dying, Zeigler says that they must find a scientist named Dr. Eustace Caroll.|$|E
