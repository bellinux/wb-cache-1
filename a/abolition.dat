5|$|<b>Abolition</b> {{continued}} to be associated in the public consciousness with the French Revolution and with British radical groups, resulting in a decline in public support. In 1795, the Society for Effecting the <b>Abolition</b> of the Slave Trade ceased to meet, and Clarkson retired in ill-health to the Lake District. However, despite the decreased interest in <b>abolition,</b> Wilberforce {{continued to}} introduce <b>abolition</b> bills throughout the 1790s.|$|E
5|$|The Quakers, {{already working}} for <b>abolition,</b> also {{recognised}} {{the need for}} influence within Parliament, and urged Clarkson to secure a commitment from Wilberforce to bring forward the case for <b>abolition</b> in the House of Commons.|$|E
5|$|The {{early years}} of the 19th century once again saw an {{increased}} public interest in <b>abolition.</b> Since Napoleon had reintroduced slavery in the French colonies, support of <b>abolition</b> was no longer perceived as being pro-French.|$|E
5|$|As {{his sons}} had desired and planned, Wilberforce {{has long been}} viewed as a Christian hero, a statesman-saint held up {{as a role model}} for putting his faith into action. More broadly, he has also been {{described}} as a humanitarian reformer who contributed significantly to reshaping the political and social attitudes of the time by promoting concepts of social responsibility and action. In the 1940s, the role of Wilberforce and the Clapham Sect in <b>abolition</b> was downplayed by historian Eric Williams, who argued that <b>abolition</b> was motivated not by humanitarianism but by economics, as the West Indian sugar industry was in decline. Williams' approach strongly influenced historians for much of {{the latter part of the}} 20th century. However, more recent historians have noted that the sugar industry was still making large profits at the time of <b>abolition,</b> and this has led to a renewed interest in Wilberforce and the Evangelicals, as well as a recognition of the anti-slavery movement as a prototype for subsequent humanitarian campaigns.|$|E
5|$|Bath {{became part}} of the county of Avon in 1974, and, {{following}} Avon's <b>abolition</b> in 1996, has been the principal centre of Bath and North East Somerset.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the road}} {{continued}} long after Mussolini's death and the <b>abolition</b> of Italian Fascism. The obelisks along the road were installed {{in time for the}} Jubilee of 1950.|$|E

5|$|Hull was {{an early}} theatre of battle in the English Civil Wars. Its 18th century Member of Parliament, William Wilberforce, took a {{prominent}} part in the <b>abolition</b> {{of the slave trade}} in Britain.|$|E
5|$|In 1823, the Anti-Slavery Society {{was founded}} in Britain, {{dedicated}} to abolishing slavery throughout the British Empire; the Slavery <b>Abolition</b> Act 1833 represented the achievement of their goal. The Zong massacre was frequently cited in abolitionist literature in the 19th century; in 1839, Thomas Clarkson published his History of the Rise, Progress, and Accomplishment of the <b>Abolition</b> of the African Slave Trade, which included an account of killings.|$|E
5|$|In 1833, Wilberforce's health {{declined}} {{further and}} {{he suffered a}} severe attack of influenza from which he never fully recovered. He made a final anti-slavery speech in April 1833 at a public meeting in Maidstone, Kent. The following month, the Whig government introduced the Bill for the <b>Abolition</b> of Slavery, formally saluting Wilberforce in the process. On 26 July 1833, Wilberforce heard of government concessions that guaranteed {{the passing of the}} Bill for the <b>Abolition</b> of Slavery. The following day he grew much weaker, and he died early on the morning of 29 July at his cousin's house in Cadogan Place, London.|$|E
5|$|In Wilberforce's absence, Pitt, who {{had long}} been {{supportive}} of <b>abolition,</b> introduced the preparatory motion himself, and ordered a Privy Council investigation into the slave trade, followed by a House of Commons review.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{evidence of the}} wealth brought by the slave trade there are several significant links to the abolitionists. Bristol's Hannah More was an influential member of the Society for Effecting the <b>Abolition</b> of the African Slave Trade. In the Seven Stars Public House Thomas Clarkson collected evidence for William Wilberforce on the cruelty of the trade in humans. Bristol Cathedral contains several memorials to people active in the <b>abolition</b> cause, including a bust of Robert Southey. John Wesley opposed the trade in humans and in 1774 his sermon at the New Room against slavery was disturbed by explosion. Several plays adopted by the abolitionists were performed at the Bristol Old Vic, including Oroonoko, {{the story of an}} enslaved African and The Padlock, which was praised by Clarkson for its importance to the <b>abolition</b> cause.|$|E
5|$|In later years, Wilberforce {{supported}} {{the campaign for}} the complete <b>abolition</b> of slavery, and continued his involvement after 1826, when he resigned from Parliament because of his failing health. That campaign led to the Slavery <b>Abolition</b> Act 1833, which abolished slavery {{in most of the}} British Empire; Wilberforce died just three days after hearing that the passage of the Act through Parliament was assured. He was buried in Westminster Abbey, close to his friend William Pitt.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon was {{responsible}} for spreading {{the values of the}} French Revolution to other countries, especially in legal reform and the <b>abolition</b> of serfdom.|$|E
5|$|On May 20, Paul {{advocated}} {{with the}} <b>abolition</b> of gun free zones during {{a speech to}} the National Rife Association, citing repeated tragedies occurring in these locations.|$|E
5|$|The Division of Charlton in the Hunter Region {{was named}} in his honour {{and had been}} a safe Labor seat since its {{creation}} in 1984 until its <b>abolition</b> in 2016.|$|E
5|$|<b>Abolition</b> of untouchability: Article 17 of the {{constitution}} abolishes the practice of untouchability. Practice of untouchability is an offence and anyone doing so is punishable by law. The Untouchability Offences Act of 1955 (renamed to Protection of Civil Rights Act in 1976) provided penalties for preventing a person from entering a place of worship or from taking water from a tank or well.|$|E
5|$|According to {{historian}} George H. Haynes, {{during his}} nearly {{thirty years of}} public service Wilson practiced principled politics by championing unpopular causes, sometimes {{at the expense of}} his personal ambition. The causes Wilson supported included <b>abolition</b> of slavery, and the rights of workers, both black and white.|$|E
5|$|COBOL 2002 {{suffered}} from poor support: no compilers completely supported the standard. Micro Focus {{found that it}} was {{due to a lack of}} user demand for the new features and due to the <b>abolition</b> of the NIST test suite, which had been used to test compiler conformance. The standardization process was also found to be slow and under-resourced.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain {{sought the}} <b>abolition</b> of the elected Poor Law Boards of Guardians, which {{administered}} relief and {{which in some}} areas were responsible for rates. Many of the Boards were controlled by Labour, and had defied the Government by distributing relief funds to the able-bodied unemployed. Chamberlain's {{first step in the}} direction of <b>abolition</b> was the Rating and Valuation Act 1925, which greatly reduced the number of authorities which administered rates, as well as imposing uniform standards for assessment. Despite policy differences Chamberlain continued to work with Churchill, who showed him the manuscript of a volume of his heavily autobiographical The World Crisis. Churchill confided that he would have wished for two more years to revise the manuscript; Chamberlain wrote to his sisters that he could have done the job in two hours—with a pair of scissors.|$|E
5|$|Comstock and {{his allies}} also took aim at the libertarians and utopians who {{comprised}} the free love movement– an initiative to promote sexual freedom, equality for women, and <b>abolition</b> of marriage. The free love proponents were the only group to actively oppose the Comstock laws in the 19th century, {{setting the stage for}} the birth control movement.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{submitted}} to the Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London included a recommendation to divide Middlesex into two counties of North Middlesex and West Middlesex. However, the commission instead proposed <b>abolition</b> of the county and merging of the boroughs and districts. This was enacted by Parliament as the London Government Act 1963, which came into force on 1 April 1965.|$|E
5|$|Five {{years after}} his death, sons Robert and Samuel Wilberforce {{published}} a five-volume biography about their father, and subsequently a collection of his letters in 1840. The biography was controversial in that the authors emphasised Wilberforce's role in the <b>abolition</b> movement and played down the important work of Thomas Clarkson. Incensed, Clarkson came out of retirement {{to write a book}} refuting their version of events, and the sons eventually made a half-hearted private apology to him and removed the offending passages in a revision of their biography. However, for more than a century, Wilberforce's role in the campaign dominated the history books. Later historians have noted the warm and highly productive relationship between Clarkson and Wilberforce, and have termed it one of history's great partnerships: without both the parliamentary leadership supplied by Wilberforce and the research and public mobilisation organised by Clarkson, <b>abolition</b> could not have been achieved.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{formation}} of an SNP minority government after the Scottish parliamentary election of May 2007, a new debate on the <b>abolition</b> of tolls was opened by Transport Minister Stewart Stevenson on 31 May 2007, where it was agreed by a large majority. Toll levies at that point totalled £16million annually.|$|E
5|$|From 10 September to 10 October Morrissey {{starred in}} Hangmen by Martin McDonagh, at the Royal Court Theatre. The play {{followed}} Harry Wade, England's second-best hangman, after the <b>abolition</b> of hanging in Great Britain in 1965. He {{is also to}} appear from October 2017 as Mark Anthony in Julius Caesar at the new Bridge Theatre.|$|E
5|$|Henry Ward Beecher (June 24, 1813 – March 8, 1887) was an American Congregationalist clergyman, social reformer, and speaker, {{known for}} his support of the <b>abolition</b> of slavery, his {{emphasis}} on God's love, and his 1875 adultery trial.|$|E
5|$|In 1804, Clarkson {{resumed his}} work and the Society for Effecting the <b>Abolition</b> of the Slave Trade began meeting again, {{strengthened}} with prominent new members such as Zachary Macaulay, Henry Brougham and James Stephen. In June 1804, Wilberforce's bill to abolish the slave trade successfully passed all its stages through the House of Commons. However, {{it was too late}} in the parliamentary session for it to complete its passage through the House of Lords. On its reintroduction during the 1805 session, it was defeated, with even the usually sympathetic Pitt failing to support it. On this occasion and throughout the campaign, <b>abolition</b> was held back by Wilberforce's trusting, even credulous nature, and his deferential attitude towards those in power. He found it difficult to believe that men of rank would not do what he perceived to be the right thing, and was reluctant to confront them when they did not.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, the new {{minister}} for the ACT, Gary Punch, received a report recommending the <b>abolition</b> of the NCDC {{and the formation}} of a locally elected government. Punch recommended that the Hawke government accept the report's recommendations, and subsequently Clyde Holding introduced legislation to grant self-government to the Territory in October1988.|$|E
5|$|In August 1833, the British {{parliament}} {{passed the}} 'Act for the <b>abolition</b> of slavery throughout the British Colonies, for promoting the industry of manumitted slaves, and for compensating the persons hitherto {{entitled to the}} services of such slaves', with effect from 1 August 1834. Plantation owners of British Guiana received £4,297,117 10s. 6½d. in compensation {{for the loss of}} 84,915 slaves.|$|E
5|$|In his absence, {{the issue}} of female genital {{mutilation}} (FGM) had become a topic of strong debate in Kikuyu society. The Protestant churches, backed by European medics and the colonial authorities, supported the <b>abolition</b> of this traditional practice, but the KCA rallied to its defence, claiming that its <b>abolition</b> would {{be a threat to}} the structure and customs of Kikuyu society. Anger between the two sides had heightened, with several churches expelling KCA members from their congregations, and it was widely believed that the January 1930 killing of the American nun, Hulda Stumpf, had been due to the issue. As Secretary of the KCA, Kenyatta soon attended a meeting with church representatives. There, he expressed the view that although he personally opposed FGM, he regarded its legal <b>abolition</b> as counter-productive, and that the churches should focus on eradicating the practice through education of its harmful effects on women's health. The meeting ended without compromise, and John Arthur—the head of the Church of Scotland in Kenya—later complained about what he described as Kenyatta's dishonesty during the debate, expelling him from the church. In 1931, Kenyatta took his son out of the church school at Thogota and enrolled him in a KCA-approved, independent school.|$|E
5|$|MF Dnes {{pointed out}} that despite the steady rise of firearm {{ownership}} in the country since <b>abolition</b> of restrictive Communist legislation after the Velvet Revolution, the number of intentional homicide victims has been steadily falling since its peak in 1994.|$|E
5|$|Many voters {{decried the}} bill as a self-serving attempt by Goebel to {{increase}} his political power, and the election board remained a controversial issue until its <b>abolition</b> in a special session of the legislature in 1900.|$|E
5|$|Politically, Robinson opposed both secession and <b>abolition.</b> Though he had Union sympathies, he was {{considered}} a moderate, opposing both fugitive slave laws and the enlistment of black soldiers. As a state senator, he supported the Crittenden Compromise and opposed the Civil War. As governor, he drew criticism from the administration of President Abraham Lincoln for opposing the Emancipation Proclamation.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the other}} issues {{involving}} Hamilton were bypassing the rising issue of slavery in Congress after Quakers petitioned for its <b>abolition</b> (though {{he returned to the}} issue the following year), Duer having resigned as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, and the vote of assumption being voted down 31 votes to 29 on April 12.|$|E
5|$|Tameside {{was created}} on 1 April 1974, by the Local Government Act 1972 {{as one of}} the ten {{metropolitan}} districts of Greater Manchester. It took over the local government functions of nine districts which were formerly in the administrative counties of Lancashire and of Cheshire. In 1986 Tameside effectively became a unitary authority with the <b>abolition</b> of the Greater Manchester County Council.|$|E
