5|$|Betelgeuse is {{travelling}} supersonically {{through the}} interstellar medium <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> of 30km per second (i.e. ~6.3AU per year) creating a bow shock. The shock is not created by the star, but by its powerful stellar wind as it ejects vast amounts of gas into {{the interstellar medium}} <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> of 17km/s, heating the material surrounding the star, thereby making it visible in infrared light. Because Betelgeuse is so bright, {{it was only in}} 1997 that the bow shock was first imaged. The cometary structure is estimated to be at least 1 parsec wide, assuming a distance of 643 light-years.|$|E
5|$|Henry Kolm went on {{to start}} Magplane Technology in the 1990s to develop the {{magnetic}} transportation technology that O'Neill had written about. In 2007, Magplane demonstrated a working magnetic pipeline system to transport phosphate ore in Florida. The system ran <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> of 40mph (65km/h), far slower than the high-speed trains O'Neill envisioned.|$|E
5|$|In 2013 Voyager 1 was {{exiting the}} solar system <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> of about 3.6 AU per year, while Voyager 2 is going slower, leaving {{the solar system}} at 3.3 AU per year. Each year Voyager 1 {{increases}} its lead over Voyager 2.|$|E

5|$|Some seamounts {{have not}} been mapped and thus pose a navigational danger. For instance, Muirfield Seamount is named after the ship that hit it in 1973. More recently, the {{submarine}} USS San Francisco ran into an uncharted seamount in 2005 <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> of , sustaining serious damage and killing one seaman.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships were}} also armed with {{submerged}} torpedo tubes in their hulls. Derfflinger {{was equipped with}} four 50cm tubes; the later ships were armed with more powerful 60cm weapons. The tubes were arranged with one in the bow, one in the stern, and two on the broadside. Derfflingers 50cm torpedoes were the G7 type, 7.02m (276in) long and armed with a 195kg (430lb) Hexanite warhead. The torpedo had a range of 4,000m (4,370yd) when set <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> of 37knots, and up to 9,300m (10,170yd) at 27 knots. The 60cm torpedoes were the H8 type, which were 8m long and carried a 210kg (463lb) Hexanite warhead. The torpedoes had a range of 6,000m (6,550yd) when set <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> of 36knots; at a reduced speed of 30knots, the range increased significantly to 14,000m (15,310yd).|$|E
5|$|In 1994, RA85656, a Tupolev Tu-154 {{operating}} as Baikal Airlines Flight 130, crashed near Irkutsk shortly after departing from Irkutsk Airport, Russia. Damage to the starter caused {{a fire in}} engine number two (located in the rear fuselage). High temperatures during the fire destroyed the tanks and pipes of all three hydraulic systems. The crew {{lost control of the}} aircraft. The unmanageable plane, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> of 275 knots, hit the ground at a dairy farm and burned. All passengers and crew, as well as a dairyman on the ground, died.|$|E
50|$|The {{class was}} rated <b>at</b> <b>a</b> maximum <b>speed</b> of 140 km/h. However, on 12 June 1939 one type 12 {{locomotive}} completed the 105 km from Brussels to Ostend in 57 minutes <b>at</b> <b>a</b> maximum <b>speed</b> of 165 km/h.|$|R
50|$|The 19578 {{service covers}} 2593 km in 49 hours 20 minutes <b>at</b> <b>an</b> average <b>speed</b> of 55.71 km/h and takes 48 hours <b>at</b> <b>an</b> average <b>speed</b> of 56.29 km/h as the 19577 service. <b>As</b> the average <b>speed</b> {{of the train}} is above 55 km/h.|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} this is a {{conveyor}} system that is required to travel <b>at</b> <b>a</b> constant <b>speed.</b> For <b>a</b> constant voltage, the conveyor will move <b>at</b> <b>a</b> different <b>speed</b> depending on the load on the motor (represented here by the weight of objects on the conveyor). In order for the conveyor to run <b>at</b> <b>a</b> constant <b>speed,</b> the voltage of the motor must be adjusted depending on the load. In this case, a closed-loop control system would be necessary.|$|R
5|$|In a medium, light {{usually does}} not {{propagate}} <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> equal to c; further, {{different types of}} light wave will travel at different speeds. The speed at which the individual crests and troughs of a plane wave (a wave filling the whole space, with only one frequency) propagate is called the phase velocityvp. An actual physical signal with a finite extent (a pulse of light) travels at a different speed. The largest part of the pulse travels at the group velocityvg, and its earliest part travels at the front velocityvf.|$|E
5|$|In mathematics, the curve-shortening flow is {{a process}} that modifies a smooth curve in the Euclidean plane by moving its points perpendicularly to the curve <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> {{proportional}} to the curvature. The curve-shortening flow {{is an example of a}} geometric flow, and is the one-dimensional case of the mean curvature flow. Other names for the same process include the Euclidean shortening flow, geometric heat flow, and arc length evolution.|$|E

5|$|On 22 September 2013, Balotelli {{missed a}} penalty in a {{competitive}} match {{for the first time}} in 22 attempts as a professional; the kick was saved by Pepe Reina as Milan lost 2–1 to Napoli. During a match against Catania on 1 December, Balotelli accused opponent Nicolás Spolli of racially abusing him, but there was insufficient evidence for any action to be taken. The following week, Balotelli scored two goals in a 2–2 draw with Livorno, including a sensational 30-yard direct free kick that was clocked <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> of 109km/h.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{destroyed}} by the explosion of her own torpedoes. According to Goodall's theory, the ship's torpedoes could have been detonated either by the fire raging on the boat deck or, more probably, by a direct hit from Bismarck. This would have blown out {{the side of the}} ship, destroying the girder strength of the hull; the force of water entering the hole, <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> of nearly , would then shear the stern section {{from the rest of the}} hull.|$|E
5|$|According to Einstein's {{theory of}} special relativity, as an electron's speed {{approaches}} {{the speed of}} light, from an observer's point of view its relativistic mass increases, thereby making it {{more and more difficult}} to accelerate it from within the observer's frame of reference. The speed of an electron can approach, but never reach, the speed of light in a vacuum, c. However, when relativistic electrons—that is, electrons moving <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> close to c—are injected into a dielectric medium such as water, where the local speed of light is significantly less than c, the electrons temporarily travel faster than light in the medium. As they interact with the medium, they generate a faint light called Cherenkov radiation.|$|E

5|$|An {{atmospheric}} probe {{was released from}} the spacecraft in July 1995, entering the planet's atmosphere on December 7, 1995. After a high-g descent into the Jovian atmosphere, the probe discarded the remains of its heat shield, and it parachuted through 150km of the atmosphere, collecting data for 57.6minutes, before being crushed by the pressure and temperature to which it was subjected (about 22 times Earth normal, at a temperature of 153°C). It would have melted thereafter, and possibly vaporized. The Galileo orbiter itself experienced a more rapid version of the same fate when it was deliberately steered into the planet on September 21, 2003 <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> of over 50km/s, in order to avoid any possibility of it crashing into and contaminating Europa.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of filming, Aston Martin {{were still in the}} final phases of {{designing}} the DBS. The scene involving the car crash was devised using an Aston Martin DB9 that was especially modified to look like Bond's Aston Martin DBS V12 and reinforced to withstand the impact. Due to the low centre of gravity of the vehicle, an 18-inch (450mm) ramp had to be implemented on the road tarmac at Millbrook Proving Grounds and Adam Kirley, the stunt driver who performed the stunt, had to use an air cannon located behind the driver's seat to propel the car into a roll at the precise moment of impact. <b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> exceeding 70mph(113km/h), the car rotated seven times while being filmed, and was confirmed by the Guinness Book of Records on 5 November 2006 as a new world record.|$|E
5|$|Cameras on the Galileo {{spacecraft}} observed {{fragments of}} Comet Shoemaker–Levy9 between 16 and 22 July 1994 as they collided with Jupiter's southern hemisphere <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> of approximately 60kilometres per second. This {{was the first}} direct observation of an extraterrestrial collision of solar system objects. While the impacts {{took place on the}} side of Jupiter hidden from Earth, Galileo, then at a distance of 1.6AU from the planet, was able to see the impacts as they occurred. Its instruments detected a fireball that reached a peak temperature of about 24,000K, compared to the typical Jovian cloudtop temperature of about 130K (−143°C), with the plume from the fireball reaching a height of over 3,000km.|$|E
50|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{different}} applications for trajectory optimization within the field of walking robotics. For example, one paper used trajectory optimization of bipedal gaits on a simple model to show that walking is energetically favorable for moving <b>at</b> <b>a</b> low <b>speed</b> and running is energetically favorable for moving <b>at</b> <b>a</b> high <b>speed.</b>|$|R

5|$|Classified as a red supergiant of {{spectral}} type M1-2, {{the star}} {{is one of the}} largest and most luminous stars visible to the naked eye. If Betelgeuse were at the center of the Solar System, its surface would extend past the asteroid belt, wholly engulfing the orbits of Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, and possibly Jupiter. Calculations of its mass range from slightly under ten to a little over twenty times that of the Sun. It is calculated to be 640 light-years away, yielding an absolute magnitude of about −6. Less than 10 million years old, Betelgeuse has evolved rapidly because of its high mass. Having been ejected from its birthplace in the Orion OB1 Association—which includes the stars in Orion's Belt—this runaway star has been observed moving through the interstellar medium <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> of 30km/s, creating a bow shock over 4 light-years wide. Currently in a late stage of stellar evolution, the supergiant is expected to explode as a supernova within the next million years.|$|E
5|$|Greg Paul (1988) {{proposed}} that the horns were butting weapons and that the small orbita would have minimized the possibility of hurting the eyes while fighting. Gerardo Mazzetta and colleagues (1998) suggested that Carnotaurus used its horns in a way similar to rams. They calculated that the neck musculature {{was strong enough to}} absorb the force of two individuals colliding with their heads frontally <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> of 5.7m/s each. Fernando Novas (2009) interpreted several skeletal features as adaptations for delivering blows with the head. He suggested that the shortness of the skull might have made head movements quicker by reducing the moment of inertia, while the muscular neck would have allowed strong head blows. He also noted an enhanced rigidity and strength of the spinal column that may have evolved to withstand shocks conducted by the head and neck.|$|E
5|$|Magnetic Airborne Detection (MAD) {{was used}} to detect {{submerged}} U-boats. It consisted of a sensitive magnetometer installed in the cone of the aircraft (mostly Catalinas) that could detect anomalies in the Earth's magnetic field within a range of 400 feet and was sensitive to detect a submarine to within a few feet. The mine was {{used in conjunction with}} a 65.5lb retro bomb. It was filled with 25lb of Torpex and the weapon was rocket propelled backwards to the line of flight <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>speed</b> that counteracted the aircraft's forward motion. It was released rearwards from rails on the wings of the aircraft. Thus, with the aircraft's forward motion cancelled-out by the rocket motor, the device fell directly onto the target.|$|E
