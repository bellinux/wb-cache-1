40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} was to outline a {{reformed}} budget for the European Union. The focus was on the fight between net contributors and net recipients {{with regards to the}} theory of fiscal federalism and the current levels of integration by the EU. The advent of the crisis was the motivation for the authorities to learn from the crisis and then to implement reforms. An analysis of the theory of public finance, the theory of fiscal federalism and {{the current state of the}} EU budget reveals three main areas that need to be resolved by this reform. The lack of a stabilisation function, inefficient allocation of expenditure chapters and, mainly the inequity in the distribution of funds between Member States indicated the need for radical change. Optimising operational budgetary balances with a mathematical model that would calculate these balances ex ante was not technically feasible. Thus, the author presents a model that could despite its simplifications bring significant benefits to the problems of "Juste Retour" by contributing towards fairer allocation and a reduction conflict between groups of beneficiaries and contributors. Additionally, significant outcomes were achieved with regards to the EU Budget notably greater flexibility and an overall simplification of the budget.

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the use of <b>automatic</b> fiscal <b>stabilisers,</b> {{particularly}} in relation to New Zealand’s experience over the past business cycle. Allowing the <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilisers</b> to operate in response to cyclical fluctuations in output is likely to yield efficiency gains {{in a country with}} a sound fiscal position and a credible approach to medium-term fiscal stability. However, automatic stabilisation does increase the potential for fiscal ill discipline. A risk is that an imprudent Government could allow the <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilisers</b> to operate during a downturn and not bank the gains in the upturn. The discipline imposed by the FRA in New Zealand helps ensure that the Government acts prudently. And a sound underlying fiscal position ensures that when policy action is required, it can be undertaken in a measured manner. Reflecting this, the New Zealand Government has allowed the <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilisers</b> to operate to a greater extent during the most recent recession than during the 1991 recession. ...|$|R

40|$|The three {{essays in}} this {{collection}} approach taxation {{as a group of}} policy instruments, and study how their use is connected to and affected by wage formation in the economy. Two essays have been published and the third is forthcoming in scientific journals. There is also an introductory essay summarising the three essays and relating them to other studies. In the first essay the role of taxation is to act as an <b>automatic</b> <b>stabiliser</b> in the face of different shocks. Wage formation is uninstitutional. The policy instrument is the degree of indexation of income taxes to prices. The essay combines two theoretical models from previous literature. The essay shows that earlier results, concerning both income tax indexation and the role of openness in deciding the optimal degree of wage indexation, do not hold under some more general assumptions. The second essay was originated by the tax threat experiment in Finland in the late 1980 s. The aim of policy is to cure an acute inflation problem. Thus the time horizon is one bargaining round. Several trade unions take part in wage bargaining. The policy instrument is a conditional threat to increase taxes. The study develops a one-shot game describing the determination of the threat and the decisions of the unions. The article gives one possible rationalisation for the use and success of tax threat policies, and discusses reasons why this instrument is not used more often. In the third essay the aim of policies is to increase efficiency and welfare in the economy. The time span is several decades, long enough for households and firms to have fully adjusted their behaviour to the tax and transfer structure. Wage setting is done by majority-voting by life-cycle optimisers in a centralised monopoly union. The essay extends a well-known dynamic general equilibrium simulation model to include a trade union. Tax and transfer structure is shown to affect the economy through dynamic channels and in a way which depends significantly on wage formation. Endast sammandrag.

40|$|In the {{traditional}} model of financial intermediation, the sources {{and the process}} of liquidity creation through banks’ balance sheets were particularly clear. The robustness of liquidity in such a regime is essentially based {{on the quality of the}} banks’ assets and the credibility offered by the institutional framework within which they operate (deposit insurance, access to central bank money and more generally regulatory and prudential constraints). In the current financial system, with the perpetual supply of new capital and risk transfer instruments, endogenous liquidity sources have undeniably diversified and grown, but they appear to be less stable and reliable. Financial innovation, to an extent, may have let market participants believe that they could, on an enduring basis, escape from the monetary constraint (the need for genuine cash) and that they could make do with the liabilities issued by other institutions to meet their liquidity needs. However, market instruments can satisfy investors’ liquidity preference only as long as the state of confidence in the marketplace supports them. Liquidity preference, which is intimately linked to asset price expectations, is indeed liable to shift swiftly at times, and to bring about runs on the most certain forms of liquidity (bank money, and worse, central bank money). Ultimately, the liquidity of fi nancial assets depends on the trust that they can be redeemed on demand. Such trust is probably more difficult to ascertain in the market-based, highly securitised world. Still, crises may sometimes have educational virtues, and the turmoil of this summer has revealed some urgent needs to “robustify” the sources of liquidity in the system. It is now obvious that some additional suppliers of liquidity are needed in nearly absent secondary markets for complex structured credit products. This probably cannot be achieved without greater disclosure on the structures of investments among market participants. It is also clear that the containment of liquidity risk depends on the ability of fi nancial institutions to properly price complex products, in their regular risk management process as well as in times of crisis. The “liquidity frontier” cannot be pushed back indefi nitely. Those who, in the end, accept illiquidity in their balance sheet must clearly understand and control the risks they are taking on. Such illiquidity is more acceptable for investors with long time horizons, and who are not subject to creditors suddenly calling in their money at short notice. For others, larger liquidity buffers acting as an <b>automatic</b> <b>stabiliser</b> to smooth the financial cycle might be necessary to hedge their risk. Without such precautions, financial innovation could unduly extend the liquidity insurance implicitly expected of central banks. Yet, it is certainly not the role of a central bank to prompt market participants to rush into “not-so-reliable liabilities”. ...|$|E
40|$|In general, {{fundamental}} opinions regarding {{macroeconomic stabilisation}} {{of an economy}} consider that (i) economy autocorrects itself and on the long term tends toward equilibrium and (ii) because of rigidities, the economy cannot correct by itself and {{it is necessary for}} the government to intervene, through anticyclical policies, and bring it to equilibrium. The <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilisers</b> are described as categories of government revenues and expenditures that adjust themselves to the cyclical changes of an economy – for example, as output decreases, revenue collection is reduced, while unemployment benefits increase. These changes will have a direct impact on business and household income.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} the optimality of business cycle dependent unemployment benefits.

Incentives are strengthened in booms, where job search is more efficient, whereas insurance is strengthened in recessions, where job search is less efficient and where involuntary unemployment is higher.

40|$|The classic {{argument}} for a euro area (EA) fiscal capacity {{revolves around the}} need to “dampen the effects of asymmetric shocks”. According to authors who expound this conventional wisdom, the euro area (EA) needs a common fiscal capacity {{along the lines of}} the ‘US federal fiscal system’ because it lacks <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilisers</b> to deal with asynchronous output fluctuations. This paper provides empirical evidence to indicate that the abovementioned view largely overstates the stabilising role of US federal transfers to states. Despite the absence of a centralised EA <b>stabiliser,</b> the <b>automatic</b> <b>stabilisers</b> in the EA bring about a larger degree of insurance against asymmetric shocks (about 20 %) than that provided by the US federal budget (11 %). To some extent, this is attributable to the higher degree of market-based risk sharing in the US and to the existence of other public institutions enhancing financial stability and private risk sharing in the US.

40|$|When {{setting and}} {{monitoring}} fiscal targets, {{there is a}} need to take explicit account of the cyclical position of the economy and its effect on the budget. Most of the discussion on fiscal policy in South Africa deals only with long-term sustainability issues, largely ignoring the effects of the economic cycle. As a result, serious policy mistakes can occur if purely cyclical improvements in the public finances are treated as if they represent structural improvements, or if structural deterioration is interpreted as a cyclical effect. This study considers the countercyclical role of South African fiscal policy during the period 1970 to 2000. More specifically, it presents theoretical and empirical analysis of the significance of <b>automatic</b> fiscal <b>stabilisers</b> in the South African economy and calculates the cyclically adjusted budget balance that can improve fiscal policy-making and analysis. The study compares results for South Africa with six other developing countries (Chile, Mexico, Indonesia, India, Mauritius and Romania) and macroeconomic stabilisation and the potential role of <b>automatic</b> fiscal <b>stabilisers</b> in the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) are also investigated. This study highlights the need for continued caution in the use of discretionary policy, greater focus on making <b>automatic</b> fiscal <b>stabilisers</b> more effective in South Africa and the integration of better measures of fiscal balance into the discretionary policy process. <b>Automatic</b> fiscal <b>stabilisers</b> could also play an important role as a complement to countercyclical monetary policy and the operation of monetary policy could be facilitated by the predictable and automatic responses from <b>automatic</b> fiscal <b>stabilisers.</b> Budget rules could play an important role in developing countries and specifically in African countries. If applied flexibly, fiscal rules could be regarded as restoring at least a moderate countercyclical role in these countries through the operation of <b>automatic</b> fiscal <b>stabilisers.</b> Although <b>automatic</b> fiscal <b>stabilisers</b> are likely to be less important in African countries due to structural reasons, the combination of appropriate rules, taking into account the impact of the business cycle on the public finances and vigilance against the dangers of inappropriate discretionary policy, may make a valuable contribution to Africa’s development.
