5|$|A {{possible}} transitional form of microorganism {{between a}} prokaryote and a eukaryote {{was discovered in}} 2012 by Japanese scientists.

This is seen to be the first plausible evolutionary form of microorganism, showing <b>a</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> development from the prokaryote to the eukaryote.|$|E

5|$|The {{protoplanetary disk}} is an {{accretion}} disk that feeds the central star. Initially very hot, the disk later cools {{in what is}} known as the T tauri star stage; here, formation of small dust grains made of rocks and ice is possible. The grains eventually may coagulate into kilometer-sized planetesimals. If the disk is massive enough, the runaway accretions begin, resulting in the rapid—100,000 to 300,000years—formation of Moon- to Mars-sized planetary embryos. Near the star, the planetary embryos go through <b>a</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> violent mergers, producing a few terrestrial planets. The last stage takes approximately 100million to a billion years.|$|E
5|$|Tracking {{generally}} west-southwestward, {{the storm}} entered <b>a</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> rapid deepening on August10, despite forecasts of an only marginally favorable environment. On August11, Flossie {{became a major}} hurricane, reaching its peak intensity with winds of 140mph (220km/h). With cooler sea surface temperatures and high wind shear in its path, the hurricane weakened steadily, deteriorating to a tropical depression by August16. The storm's center became devoid of strong thunderstorms later that day, indicating Flossie no longer qualified as a tropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|Cavendish was runner-up in the 2010 Tour's points {{classification}} and had won 15 {{stages in}} the three previous Tours; he had won a stage at the Tour of Oman, the one-day race Scheldeprijs and two stages at the Giro during the 2011 season prior to the Tour. Gilbert had amassed a total of eleven wins (not including the national championships) for the season before the Tour, including three spring classics: Liège–Bastogne–Liège, Amstel Gold Race and La Flèche Wallonne. Farrar's form in the lead-up to the Tour included a stage win in both Tirreno–Adriatico and the Ster ZLM Toer. Hushovd, the world road race champion, only had one win in the season before the Tour, <b>a</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> the Tour de Suisse. Petacchi's best results prior the Tour were a trio of {{stages in the}} Giro, the Volta a Catalunya and the Tour of Turkey. The major victory of Boonen's season up to the Tour was the Gent–Wevelgem one-day race.|$|E

5|$|Hirschman {{believed}} that Nurkse's balanced growth theory wasn't {{in fact a}} theory of growth. Growth implies the gradual transformation of an economy from one stage to the chronologically next stage. It entails the series of actions which leads the economy from <b>a</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> infancy to that of maturity. However, the balanced growth theory involves {{the creation of a}} brand new, self-sufficient modern industrial economy being laid over a stagnant, self-sufficient traditional economy. Thus, there is no transformation. In reality, a dual economy will come into existence, where two separate economic sectors will begin to coexist in one country. They will differ on levels of development, technology and demand patterns. This may create inequality in the country.|$|E
5|$|Motor symptoms, if not treated, advance aggressively in {{the early}} stages of the disease and more slowly later. Untreated, {{individuals}} are expected to lose independent ambulation after an average of eight years and be bedridden after ten years. However, it is uncommon to find untreated people nowadays. Medication has improved the prognosis of motor symptoms, while at the same time it is a new source of disability, because of the undesired effects of levodopa after years of use. In people taking levodopa, the progression time of symptoms to <b>a</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> high dependency from caregivers may be over 15 years. However, it is hard to predict what course the disease will take for a given individual. Age is the best predictor of disease progression. The rate of motor decline is greater in those with less impairment at the time of diagnosis, while cognitive impairment is more frequent in those who are over 70 years of age at symptom onset.|$|E
5|$|The main {{hormonal}} {{driver of}} oily sebum {{production in the}} skin is dihydrotestosterone. Another androgenic hormone responsible for increased sebaceous gland activity is DHEA-S. Higher amounts of DHEA-S are secreted during adrenarche (<b>a</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> puberty), and this leads {{to an increase in}} sebum production. In a sebum-rich skin environment, the naturally occurring and largely commensal skin bacterium P. acnes readily grows and can cause inflammation within and around the follicle due to activation of the innate immune system. P. acnes triggers skin inflammation in acne by increasing the production of several pro-inflammatory chemical signals (such as IL-1α, IL-8, TNF-α, and LTB4); IL-1α is known to be essential to comedo formation.|$|E

5000|$|The last {{professional}} {{production from}} Grotowski {{as a director}} was in 1969. Entitled [...] "Apocalypsis Cum Figuris" [...] it is widely admired. Again using text from the Bible, this time combined with contemporary writings from authors such as T.S. Eliot and Simone Weil, this production was cited {{by members of the}} company {{as an example of a}} group 'total act'. The development of Apocalypsis took more than three years, beginning as <b>a</b> <b>staging</b> <b>of</b> Słowacki's Samuel Zborowski and passing through <b>a</b> separate <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> development as <b>a</b> <b>staging</b> <b>of</b> the Gospels, Ewangelie (elaborated as a completed performance though never presented to audiences) before arriving to its final form. Throughout this process, Grotowski can already be seen abandoning the conventions of traditional theatre, straining at the boundaries of what he later termed Art as presentation.|$|R
