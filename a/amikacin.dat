25|$|Aminoglycosides (STM, {{capreomycin}} and <b>amikacin)</b> {{should be}} avoided in patients with mild to severe kidney problems because of the increased risk of damage to the kidneys. If the use of aminoglycosides cannot be avoided (e.g., in treating drug-resistant TB) then serum levels must be closely monitored and the patient warned to report any side-effects (deafness in particular). If patient have end-stage renal failure and have no useful remaining kidney function, then aminoglycosides can be used, but only if drug levels can be easily measured (often only <b>amikacin</b> levels can be measured).|$|E
25|$|A {{standardized}} {{management plane}} of febrile, neutropenic patients must be devised in each institution or agency. Empirical regimens must contain antibiotics broadly active against Gram-negative aerobic bacteria (quinolones: i.e., ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, a third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin with pseudomonal coverage: e.g., cefepime, ceftazidime, or an aminoglycoside: i.e. gentamicin, <b>amikacin).</b>|$|E

2500|$|As of Oct 2006, [...] "Extensively {{drug-resistant}} tuberculosis" [...] (XDR-TB) {{is defined}} as MDR-TB that is resistant to quinolones and also {{to any one of}} kanamycin, capreomycin, or <b>amikacin.</b> [...] The old case definition of XDR-TB is MDR-TB that is also resistant to three or more of the six classes of second-line drugs. This definition should no longer be used, but is included here because many older publications refer to it.|$|E
2500|$|Aminoglycosides (STM, capreomycin, <b>amikacin)</b> {{should be}} used with caution in pregnancy, because they may cause {{deafness}} in the unborn child. The attending physician must weigh the benefits of treating the mother against the potential harm to the baby, and good outcomes {{have been reported in}} children whose mothers were treated with aminoglycosides. [...] Experience in Peru shows that treatment for MDR-TB is not a reason to recommend termination of pregnancy, and that good outcomes are possible.|$|E
2500|$|Resistance to one drug {{within a}} class {{generally}} means resistance to all drugs within that class, but a notable exception is rifabutin: rifampicin-resistance {{does not always}} mean rifabutin-resistance and the laboratory should be asked to test for it. [...] It is only possible to use one drug within each drug class. [...] If it is difficult finding five drugs to treat then the clinician can request that high level INH-resistance be looked for. If the strain has only low level INH-resistance (resistance at 0.2mg/l INH, but sensitive at 1.0mg/l INH), then high dose INH {{can be used as}} part of the regimen. When counting drugs, PZA and interferon count as zero; that is to say, when adding PZA to a four drug regimen, you must still choose another drug to make five. It is not possible to use more than one injectable (STM, capreomycin or <b>amikacin),</b> because the toxic effect of these drugs is additive: if possible, the aminoglycoside should be given daily for a minimum of three months (and perhaps thrice weekly thereafter). Ciprofloxacin should not be used in the treatment of tuberculosis if other fluoroquinolones are available.|$|E
50|$|Treating overdoses of <b>amikacin</b> {{requires}} {{kidney dialysis}} or peritoneal dialysis, which reduce serum concentrations of <b>amikacin,</b> and/or penicillins, {{some of which}} can form complexes with <b>amikacin</b> that deactivate it.|$|E
50|$|In {{dogs and}} cats, <b>amikacin</b> is {{commonly}} used as a topical antibiotic for ear infections and for corneal ulcers, especially those that are caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The ears are often cleaned before administering the medication, since pus and cellular debris lessen the activity of <b>amikacin.</b> <b>Amikacin</b> is administered to the eye when prepared as an ophthalmic ointment or solution, or when injected subconjunctivally. <b>Amikacin</b> in the eye can be accompanied by cephazolin. Despite its use there <b>amikacin</b> (and all aminoglycosides) are toxic to intraocular structures.|$|E
50|$|<b>Amikacin</b> {{should be}} used in smaller doses in the elderly, who often have age-related {{decreases}} in kidney function, and children, whose kidneys are not fully developed yet. It is considered pregnancy category D in both the United States and Australia, meaning they have a probability of harming the fetus. Around 16% of <b>amikacin</b> crosses the placenta; while the half-life of <b>amikacin</b> in the mother is 2 hours, it is 3.7 hours in the fetus. A pregnant woman taking <b>amikacin</b> with another aminoglycoside has a possibility of causing congenital deafness in her child. While it is known to cross the placenta, <b>amikacin</b> is only partially secreted in breast milk.|$|E
50|$|Potent diuretics {{not only}} cause ototoxicity themselves, {{but they can}} also {{increase}} the concentration of <b>amikacin</b> in the serum and tissue, making the ototoxicity even more likely. Quinidine also increases levels of <b>amikacin</b> in the body. The NSAID indomethacin can increase serum aminoglycoside levels in premature infants. Contrast mediums such as ioversol increases the nephrotoxicity and otoxicity caused by <b>amikacin.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The elderly {{tend to have}} <b>amikacin</b> {{stay longer}} in their system; while the average {{clearance}} of <b>amikacin</b> in a 20-year-old is 6 L/hr, it is 3 L/hr in an 80-year-old.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Amikacin</b> is {{most often}} used for {{treating}} severe infections with multidrug-resistant, aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, especially Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Enterobacter, E. coli, Proteus, Klebsiella, and Serratia. The only Gram-positive bacteria that <b>amikacin</b> strongly affects are Staphylococcus and Nocardia. <b>Amikacin</b> {{can also be used}} to treat non-tubercular mycobacterial infections and tuberculosis (if caused by sensitive strains) when first-line drugs fail to control the infection. It is rarely used alone.|$|E
5000|$|Drugs {{that are}} {{resistant}} to streptomycin and capreomycin are still susceptible to amikacin; drugs that {{are resistant to}} kanamycin have varying susceptibility to <b>amikacin.</b> Resistance to <b>amikacin</b> also confers resistance to kanamycin and capreomycin.|$|E
50|$|<b>Amikacin</b> may be {{administered}} {{once or twice}} a day and is usually given by the intravenous or intramuscular route, though it can be given via nebulization. There is no oral form available, as <b>amikacin</b> is not absorbed orally. In people with kidney failure, dosage must be adjusted according to the creatinine clearance, usually by reducing the dosing frequency. In people with a CNS infection such as meningitis, <b>amikacin</b> can be given intrathecally (by direct injection into the spine) or intraventricularly (by injection into the ventricles of brain).|$|E

50|$|The vast {{majority}} (95%) of <b>amikacin</b> from an IM or IV dose is secreted unchanged via glomerular filtration {{and into the}} urine within 24 hours. Factors that cause <b>amikacin</b> to be excreted via urine include its relatively low molecular weight, high water solubility, and unmetabolized state.|$|E

50|$|Resistance to <b>amikacin</b> and {{kanamycin}} in Mycobacterium, the causative {{agent of}} tuberculosis, {{is due to}} a mutation in the rrs gene, which codes for the 16S rRNA. Mutations such as these reduce the binding affinity of <b>amikacin</b> to the bacteria's ribosome. Variations of aminoglycoside acetyltransferase (AAC) and aminoglycoside adenylyltransferase (AAD) also confer resistance: resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa is caused by AAC(6')-IV, which also confers resistance to kanamycin, gentamicin, and tobramycin, and resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis is caused by AAD(4',4), which also confers resistance to kanamycin, tobramycin, and apramycin. Some strains of S. aureus can also inactivate <b>amikacin</b> by phosphorylating it.|$|E
50|$|<b>Amikacin</b> {{should be}} avoided in those who are {{sensitive}} to any aminoglycoside, as they are cross-allergenic (that is, an allergy to one aminoglycoside also confers hypersensitivity to other aminoglycosides). It should also be avoided in those sensitive to sulfite (seen more among people with asthma), since most <b>amikacin</b> usually comes with sodium metabisulfite, which can cause an allergic reaction.|$|E
50|$|Aminoglycosides such as <b>amikacin</b> {{have been}} found to be very effective, as well.|$|E
50|$|A new {{combination}} {{drug therapy}} (sulfonamide, ceftriaxone, and <b>amikacin)</b> has also shown promise.|$|E
50|$|Rifampicin is {{antagonistic}} to the microbiologic {{effects of}} the antibiotics gentamicin and <b>amikacin.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Amikacin</b> is not absorbed orally {{and thus}} must be {{administered}} parenteraly. It reaches peak serum concentrations in 0.5-2 hours when administered intramuscularly. Less than 11% of the <b>amikacin</b> actually binds to plasma proteins. It is distributed into the heart, gallbladder, lungs, and bones, {{as well as}} in bile, sputum, interstitial fluid, pleural fluid, and synovial fluids. It can be found in low concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid (but at high concentrations when administered intraventricularly). In infants, <b>amikacin</b> is normally found at 10-20% of plasma levels in the spinal fluid, but the amount reaches 50% in cases of meningitis. It does not easily cross the blood-brain barrier or enter ocular tissue.|$|E
50|$|<b>Amikacin</b> {{can cause}} neuromuscular {{blockade}} (including acute muscular paralysis) and respiratory paralysis (including apnea).|$|E
50|$|<b>Amikacin</b> may be {{combined}} with a beta-lactam antibiotic for empiric therapy for people with neutropenia and fever.|$|E
50|$|<b>Amikacin</b> {{should not}} be used with neuromuscular {{blocking}} agents, as they can increase muscle weakness and paralysis.|$|E
50|$|Postinfection {{treatment}} {{involves a}} combination of antituberculosis antibiotics, including rifampicin, rifabutin, ciprofloxacin, <b>amikacin,</b> ethambutol, streptomycin, clarithromycin or azithromycin.|$|E
50|$|The type strain {{isolates}} were susceptible {{in vitro}} to ciprofloxacin, <b>amikacin,</b> tobramycin, cefoxitin, clarithromycin, doxycycline, sulfamethoxazole and imipenem.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Amikacin</b> evades {{attacks by}} all antibiotic-inactivating enzymes that are {{responsible}} for antibiotic resistance in bacteria, except for aminoacetyltransferase and nucleotidyltransferase. This is accomplished by the L-hydroxyaminobuteroyl amide (L-HABA) moiety attached to N-1 (compare to kanamycin, which simply has a hydrogen), which blocks the access and decreases the affinity of aminoglycoside-inactivating enzymes. <b>Amikacin</b> ends up with only one site where these enzymes can attack, while gentamicin and tobramycin have six.|$|E
