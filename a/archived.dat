5|$|Theodor Mommsen {{linked the}} {{establishment}} of the law school in Beirut with the need for jurists, since the city was chosen to serve as a repository for Roman imperial edicts concerning the eastern provinces.

The proximity of the repository to the law school allowed the Beiruti jurists to consult <b>archived</b> documents and for students to learn of the most recent imperial decrees—an advantage that the law schools of Caesarea Maritima and Alexandria lacked.|$|E
