25|$|The 2009 offseason {{began with}} Jim L. Mora {{taking over the}} head {{coaching}} job over Holmgren. <b>A</b> <b>big</b> <b>splash</b> {{was made in the}} free agency market when the Seahawks managed to land talented wide receiver T. J. Houshmandzadeh from the Cincinnati Bengals and All-Pro running back Edgerrin James from division rival Arizona. In the draft, the Seahawks used their 4th overall pick on linebacker Aaron Curry from Wake Forest University, and sought to bolster their offensive line in the second round with 49th overall pick Max Unger.|$|E
25|$|The ninth {{match was}} between The New Wild Samoans and the Steiner Brothers. The match started {{back and forth}} until Savage kicked Scott in the face, and threw him outside the ring, where Fatu {{attacked}} him. The New Wild Samoans had the advantage over Scott until Scott fought back with a Frankensteiner to Fatu. After Scott avoided <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>splash</b> from Savage, Rick and Fatu came in without being tagged, and Rick attacked both. Fatu ran at Scott, and Scott sent him over the top rope. Scott was disqualified for doing so, and The New Wild Samoans won the match.|$|E
25|$|The eighth {{match was}} between the team of Rick Steiner and The Nightstalker (replacing the injured Diamond Studd) and the team of Big Van Vader and Mr. Hughes. The match started {{back and forth between}} Vader and Steiner. Hughes tagged in, and {{attacked}} Steiner until Steiner performed a German suplex. After a shoulder block from Steiner, The Nightstalker tagged himself in. The Nightstalker performed a flying clothesline, and Vader tagged in, undetected by Steiner and The Nightstalker. Steiner performed a diving bulldog to Hughes as Vader performed a clothesline to The Nightstalker. Vader then pinned The Nightstalker after <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>splash</b> to win the match.|$|E
50|$|According to Eric Clapton, Cream did {{not perform}} because the band's manager wanted to make <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>splash</b> for their American debut later that year. However, it has since been {{revealed}} that the band were not considered by the festival organizers.|$|R
5000|$|... "Don't Pull the Rope" [...] Although not <b>a</b> very <b>big</b> change, the <b>splash</b> {{that hits}} Moe's head after {{he pulls the}} ropes is <b>a</b> much <b>bigger</b> <b>splash</b> in season two than in season one.|$|R
5000|$|Highlights of an {{otherwise}} forgettable season included the late arrival of <b>a</b> <b>big</b> catcher from Bellows Falls, Vermont, Carlton Fisk, who got into 14 games for the 1971 Sox and hit two home runs. Making <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>splash</b> was <b>a</b> utility fielder who had been acquired in 1970 from the New York Yankees but came into his own in 1971. John Kennedy hit [...]272, with five homers and 22 RBIs, and was nicknamed [...] "Super Sub".|$|R
25|$|The {{main event}} was the Battlebowl battle royal. All twenty wrestlers {{started in the}} first ring. Elimination from the first ring occurs when a wrestler is thrown over the top rope and into the second ring. Elimination from the second ring occurs when a wrestler is thrown over the top rope to the floor. This {{continues}} until one wrestler remained in the first ring, {{and one in the}} second ring. Elimination then occurs when a wrestler is thrown over the top rope to the floor. The remaining wrestler will be the winner. The wrestlers fought in the first ring, on the entrance ramp and at ringside. The final four remaining in the first ring were Sting, Rick Rude, Lex Luger and Big Van Vader. Sting and Rude exchanged punches until they eliminated each other from the first ring. Vader dominated Luger with <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>splash</b> and a body avalanche. Luger fought back, and eliminated Vader with a clothesline to become the last wrestler remaining in the first ring.|$|E
25|$|The main feud {{heading into}} Survivor Series {{included}} André the Giant, One Man Gang, King Kong Bundy, Butch Reed and Rick Rude against Hulk Hogan, Paul Orndorff, Don Muraco, Ken Patera and Bam Bam Bigelow. In January 1987, Hogan {{was awarded a}} trophy for his third year as WWF World Heavyweight Champion while Hogan's best friend André was awarded a smaller trophy than Hogan's, for being undefeated in WWF for 15 years. Hogan congratulated his friend and said that André was the real champion of superstars all around the world. André surprisingly left the place before Hogan could even finish. In February, he came with a new manager Bobby Heenan. When Hogan came to know about that, he begged André not to keep Heenan as his manager because Heenan was Hogan's longtime enemy. André {{said that he had}} come to challenge Hogan for the WWF World Heavyweight Title at WrestleMania. He ripped off Hogan's Hulkamania shirt and golden chain, turning heel. This culminated in their historic match at WrestleMania III, where Hogan defeated André to retain the title. During the match, he set a record by scoop slamming the 520-pound Frenchman. On August 22, 1987 edition of Prime Time Wrestling, Paul Orndorff fired Bobby Heenan as his manager when he came to know that Heenan had brought in a new wrestler Rick Rude to replace Orndorff. Orndorff appointed Oliver Humperdink as his manager to feud with Rude. Superstar Billy Graham got involved in a feud with Butch Reed, culminating in a match between the duo. One Man Gang interfered in a match where he hit Graham with <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>splash</b> on the concrete floor. Don Muraco came to the rescue of Graham and Graham who was scheduled to participate in the main event of the first-ever Survivor Series retired due to an attack by One Man Gang. Muraco replaced him. Ken Patera got involved in a feud with Bobby Heenan and The Heenan Family and turned babyface, and was chosen to be the fourth member on Hogan's team. Many heel managers wanted to manage Bam Bam Bigelow, but Bigelow chose Oliver Humperdink as his manager thus making his WWF debut as a babyface. He also became a part of Hogan's team.|$|E
500|$|This {{approach}} to advertising {{was driven by}} Sinclair's reliance on mail-order marketing. It came with a high up-front cost in terms of purchasing space in publications but it {{had the advantage of}} ensuring that all sales were firm and pre-paid. <b>A</b> <b>big</b> <b>splash</b> on launch produced a large influx of cash at the outset of a campaign, though it did also depend on the advertiser having enough product to satisfy the initial surge in demand. The advertisements served an additional purpose of priming the market for over-the-counter sales by [...] "getting the story across", as Clive Sinclair put it: [...] "Not that big a proportion do buy on mail order, but they see the ads, and that helps to prepare them for buying when the item appears in the shops." ...|$|E

5000|$|Writing for Allmusic, {{music critic}} Richard Foss {{wrote of the}} album [...] "Though nothing else on Gypsy's debut album came quite up to the {{standard}} of the opening number, the whole album is enjoyable for connoisseurs of jazzy progressive rock... In retrospect, it's {{hard to believe that}} this debut didn't make <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>splash</b> when it was first released. Gypsy's work has held up very well compared to most albums from this era, and is still a delightful listen." ...|$|R
50|$|At the NHL Entry Draft, the Rangers chose Chris Kreider {{with their}} first-round pick, 19th overall. The Rangers {{followed}} {{this with a}} couple of trades at the draft to pick up Brian Boyle and Chad Johnson. <b>A</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>splash</b> was made <b>a</b> few days later when the Rangers traded Scott Gomez to the Montreal Canadiens. With Gomez's $7 million contract gone, the Rangers then signed free agent Marian Gaborik on July 1, the first day of free agency. On July 16, the Rangers announced that Mike Sullivan had been hired as an assistant coach.|$|R
500|$|Sgt. Slaughter was a {{guest on}} The Brother Love Show. He {{presented}} Brother Love the [...] "Greatest American Award" [...] and claimed that the United States had become soft and weak. He also declared war on Nikolai Volkoff. Prior to the next match, Duggan and Volkoff sang [...] "God Bless America". They were attacked by The Orient Express (Akio Sato and Pat Tanaka), and all four men fought in the ring. Sato and Tanaka attacked Volkoff while preventing him from tagging Duggan into the match; Mr. Fuji, the manager of The Orient Express, also hit Volkoff with his cane. When Tanaka missed <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>splash,</b> Volkoff tagged in Duggan, who performed several clothelines on Tanaka and Sato. Volkoff and Duggan then Irish whipped their opponents into each other; Duggan clotheslined Tanaka from a three-point stance and pinned him to win the match.|$|E
500|$|Another {{tape splice}} occurs at 2:13, {{transitioning}} to an electric organ playing sustained chords {{set in the}} key of F accompanied by a maraca shaken on every beat. Sound on Sound highlights this change as the [...] "most savage edit in the track ... most people would go straight into <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>splash</b> hook-line section. Brian Wilson decided to slow the track even further, moving into a 23-bar section of church organ ... Most arrangers would steer clear {{of this kind of}} drop in pace, {{on the grounds that it}} would be chart suicide, but not Brian." [...] Harrison says: [...] "The appearance of episode 1 was unusual enough but could be explained as an extended break between verse and refrain sections. Episode 2 however, makes that interpretation untenable, and both listener and analyst must entertain the idea that 'Good Vibrations' develops under its own power, as it were, without the guidance of overdetermined formal patterns. Brian’s own description of the song—a three-and-a-half-minute 'pocket symphony'—is a telling clue about his formal ambitions here." ...|$|E

2500|$|In late August 1995, after expressing to Sting that {{he wanted}} to leave the WWF, Luger got a call from WCW Vice-President Eric Bischoff to set up a meeting about a {{contract}} and Luger possibly [...] "jumping ship". Bischoff was initially reluctant to make the offer, as he did not care for Luger personally or professionally, but relented due to both Sting's urging, and the idea that his appearance would make <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>splash.</b> Bischoff offered Luger only $150,000 a year, 20% of what he was making when he left WCW three years earlier, in a deliberate attempt to have him turn down the offer (and, according to Bischoff, [...] "at least tell Sting that I tried"), only to be surprised to see that Luger accepted the offer.|$|E
2500|$|After making <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>splash</b> in 1934 with an American League record 16 {{consecutive}} wins, Schoolboy Rowe {{had another}} big year in 1935.

[...] While appearing on the Eddie Cantor radio show, Rowe famously asked his fiancee, [...] "How'm I doing, Edna honey?" [...] The line endeared Schoolboy to the nation, and also resulted in relentless teasing from opposing players and fans. [...] Schoolboy and Edna married after the 1934 season and had their first child during the 1935 season. [...] Schoolboy {{led the league in}} 1935 with six shutouts and finished the season with a 19–13 record in 34 starts. [...] Despite a 2.51 ERA in the 1935 World Series, Rowe had a 1–2 record. [...] He was the losing pitcher in Game 1, despite striking out 8 batters, pitching a complete game and allowing only 2 earned runs. [...] In Game 3, Rowe got the win, pitching 4 innings in relief. [...] But Game 5 was another tough loss, as Schoolboy threw a complete game and allowed 2 earned runs, but the Tigers scored only once.|$|E
2500|$|In 1983 Cook {{played the}} role of Richard III in the first episode of Blackadder, [...] "The Foretelling," [...] which parodies Laurence Olivier's portrayal.

5000|$|Lanark {{could be}} viewed as Thaw in a {{personal}} Hell (Thaw drowns in the sea; Lanark arrives in Unthank with the same belongings, and seashells and sand in his pockets). However, the connection between the two narratives is ambiguous. Gray has said that [...] "One is a highly exaggerated form of just about the everyday reality of the other" [...] (for example, Thaw's eczema is mirrored by Lanark's skin disease 'dragonhide'). He also writes in the novel itself: [...] "The Thaw narrative shows a man dying because he is bad at loving. It is enclosed by Lanark's narrative which shows civilization collapsing for the same reason" [...] and (spoken to Lanark) [...] "You are Thaw with the neurotic imagination trimmed off and built into the furniture of the world you occupy". He also write: [...] "The plots of the Thaw and Lanark sections are independent of each other and cemented by typographical contrivances rather than formal necessity. A possible explanation is that the author thinks a heavy book will make <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>splash</b> than two light ones".|$|R

And then he took a good deal of line off the reel. I was surprised to see a sailfish stick his bill out of the water very much closer to the boat than where R. C.'s fish should have been. I had no idea then that this was a fish other than the one R. C. had hooked. But when he cut the line either with his bill or his tail, and R. C. wound it in, we very soon discovered that it was not the fish that he had hooked. This is one of the handicaps of light tackle.|$|E
