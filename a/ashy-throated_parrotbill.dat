50|$|The <b>ashy-throated</b> <b>parrotbill,</b> (Sinosuthora alphonsiana), is a parrotbill. In old sources, it may {{be called}} Alphonse's crow-tit; though superficially {{resembling}} a tit {{it is not a}} member of the Paridae. The native range of this species extends from south-west China to northern Vietnam, and it might have become naturalised in one area in Italy.|$|E
50|$|Contrary {{to their}} western Eurasian {{relatives}} (the typical warblers), these East Asian birds are small omnivores adapted {{to living in}} reed beds. In its native range, the <b>ashy-throated</b> <b>parrotbill</b> inhabits bamboo stands and areas with tall grasses. The parrotbills in Brabbia Swamp Nature Reserve inhabit common reed (Phragmites australis) beds and drier land overgrown with meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria), grey willow (Salix cinerea) and giant goldenrod (Solidago gigantea).|$|E
5000|$|Together {{with the}} other {{lineages}} of parrotbills, these and the golden-breasted fulvetta (Lioparus chrysotis) and species in the genus Rhopophilus form an Asian counterpart to the westward radiation of the typical warblers. Rather than two genera [...] - [...] Paradoxornis and the monotypic Conostoma [...] - , the parrotbills are better considered several independent lineages which show pronounced convergent evolution, due to adaptation to reedbed habitat and a more granivorous diet than their skulking warbler-like ancestor. In this case, the <b>ashy-throated</b> <b>parrotbill</b> would probably be assigned to genus Sinoparadoxornis.|$|E
50|$|A {{population}} of parrotbills was first discovered in northern Italy in 1995, at the Riserva naturale Palude Brabbia (Brabbia Swamp Nature Reserve), between Cazzago Brabbia on Lago di Varese and Varano Borghi on Lago di Comabbio. In March 1998, 21 individuals were captured and photographed, and provisionally identified as <b>ashy-throated</b> <b>parrotbills.</b> It {{is not entirely}} clear, however, whether the birds are indeed S. alphonsiana, its close relative the S. webbiana (vinous-throated parrotbill), both species, or even hybrids between them (as are known from their natural range). While they {{do not seem to}} be brown-winged parrotbills (S. brunnea, another close relative), certain identification to species may be impossible without analysis of both nDNA and mtDNA sequence data.|$|R
40|$|Background: Trait {{polymorphism}} can evolve as {{a consequence}} of frequency-dependent selection. Coevolutionary interactions between hosts and parasites may lead to selection on both to evolve extreme phenotypes deviating from the norm, through disruptive selection. Methodology/Principal finding: Here, we show through detailed field studies and experimental procedures that the ashythroated parrotbill (Paradoxornis alphonsianus) and its avian brood parasite, the common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus), have both evolved egg polymorphism manifested in discrete immaculate white, pale blue, and blue egg phenotypes within a single population. In this host-parasite system the most common egg colours were white and blue, with no significant difference in parasitism rates between hosts laying eggs of either colour. Furthermore, selection on parasites for countering the evolution of host egg types appears to be strong, since <b>ashy-throated</b> <b>parrotbills</b> have evolved rejection abilities for even partially mimetic eggs. Conclusions/Significance: The parrotbill-cuckoo system constitutes a clear outcome of disruptive selection on both host and parasite egg phenotypes driven by coevolution, due to the cost of parasitism in the host and by host defences in the parasite. The present study is to our knowledge the first to report the influence of disruptive selection on evolution o...|$|R
50|$|The vinous-throated parrotbill was {{described}} in 1852 by John Gould {{and placed in the}} genus Suthora, where it sat with other small browner parrotbills. Later parrotbills were merged into two genera, Conostoma and Paradoxornis; with this species being placed in Paradoxornis. Recent DNA {{studies have shown that the}} genus Paradoxornis is paraphyletic, and that it should be split. It is suggested that the vinous-throated parrotbill should be placed in the genus Sinoparadoxornis. The vinous-throated parrotbill is very closely related to the <b>ashy-throated</b> <b>parrotbill,</b> and hybrids have been reported between the two species in Vietnam and China, as well as in Italy where both species have become established.|$|E
50|$|The vinous-throated parrotbill occurs from {{northern}} Vietnam to southern Manchuria, and occupies {{a wide range}} of habitats across its range. It is generally found in somewhat open wooded habitats, including scrub, woodland of early successional to late mature secondary stages, forest edges, thickets and bamboo stands. It also occurs in hedges, reeds and marshes. They also will adapt to human modified habitats such as tea plantations and plant nurseries. In China it is found in lower montane areas, in Sichuan it is replaced at 1000 m above sea level by the <b>ashy-throated</b> <b>parrotbill,</b> whereas in Taiwan, where it is the only species of parrotbill, it occurs from sea level to 3100 m and occupies the widest niche of any bird on that island.|$|E
40|$|Different {{populations of}} a host species subject to {{variable}} patterns of selection due to cuckoo parasitism provide an optimal situation for studying natural selection and coevolution in action. We compared egg appearance and egg-rejection behavior of 2 common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus) hosts, the <b>ashy-throated</b> <b>parrotbill</b> (Paradoxornis alphonsianus) and the vinous-throated parrotbill (Paradoxornis webbianus) between mainland China and Taiwan population that have been segregated for 2 – 3 million years. Avian visual modeling showed that the mainland host population under strong selection from brood parasitism has evolved polymorphic eggs, while the island host population released from brood parasitism has maintained the original monomorphic egg phenotype. Furthermore, experiments indicated that under such long historical segregation, egg rejection in the island population decayed dramatically {{in the absence of}} cuckoo parasitism. This study provides strong evidence that egg-rejection ability can be dramatically deficient in host populations without brood parasitism compared to parasitized ones. The results further enhance our understanding of changes in egg-rejection behavior in birds without the selection pressure of brood parasitism {{for an extended period of}} time...|$|E
40|$|Studies of the {{behavior}} of animals when confronted with tasks differing in complexity can improve our understanding of animal cognition and learning mechanisms. Coevolutionary interactions between brood parasites and their hosts provide an ideal opportunity for studying animal cognition because egg recognition and rejection {{are some of the most}} important adaptations evolved in hosts to counter brood parasitism. The cognitive mechanisms hosts employ in egg recognition have received substantial interest, with 2 main hypotheses being put forward: 1) true egg recognition based on a knowledge of the hosts’ own egg appearance (template that is innate and/or learned) and 2) discordancy by which individuals simply recognize eggs that are in minority as parasitic. These hypotheses are not necessarily mutually exclusive. We conducted egg experiments in the <b>ashy-throated</b> <b>parrotbill</b> (Paradoxornis alphonsianus), a common cuckoo (Cuculus canorus) host that lays immaculate, polymorphic eggs, and we obtained support for both hypotheses. Parrotbills use the presence of own eggs as a cue for recognizing parasitic eggs, supporting true recognition, but without the presence of own eggs as a template they failed to recognize the parasitic egg. Furthermore, some individuals erroneously rejected their own eggs when in minority, supporting recognition by discordancy. Such a combination of cognitive mechanisms that involves true recognition and discordancy in egg recognition in a single population has as far as we can tell never previously been described...|$|E
