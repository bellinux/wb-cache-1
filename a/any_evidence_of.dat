5|$|On 11 March 1982 Widerøe Flight 933 {{crashed into}} the Barents Sea between Berlevåg and Mehamn Airport, after having made two {{intermediate}} stops since leaving Kirkenes Airport, Høybuktmoen. All fifteen people on board the Twin Otter were killed. The accident was caused by structural failure in the rudder and vertical stabilizer following severe clear-air turbulence. A conspiracy theory arose concerning a collision with a British Harrier fighter, which resulted in four investigations—none which found <b>any</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> a collision.|$|E

5|$|In January 1904 six {{specimens}} and an egg {{were collected}} by Albert Stewart Meek, a bird collector for Lord Walter Rothschild, near Choiseul Bay on Choiseul. Several local boys told Meek that the pigeon was also present on the nearby islands of Santa Isabel and Malaita. Though Meek did not travel to these islands, he did search for the Choiseul pigeon on the adjacent Bougainville Island, but did not find <b>any</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> its presence. No other specimens were ever collected or seen by Western scientists.|$|E
5|$|On August 21, 1864, the {{soldiers}} began traveling up Fishing Creek. For the next week, they searched the northern portion of Columbia County for deserters and draft evaders. They {{were unable to}} find any, but on August 28 they arrested 100 local citizens. Most were released, although some were taken to Fort Mifflin. The soldiers continued heading into the northernmost reaches of the Fishing Creek watershed. Unable to find <b>any</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> a conspiracy, they returned to Bloomsburg and remained in the county until December 1864. The last of the prisoners were released from Fort Mifflin several months after their arrest.|$|E
5000|$|Scholars {{disagree}} on the date when infant baptism was first practiced.

5000|$|However, early radar {{analysis}} suggests there's no <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> 'pack ice' tens of meters thick as hypothesized {{based on the}} images from Mars Express of the area.

5|$|The {{evidence}} on the convergence of prices in the eurozone {{with the introduction of}} the euro is mixed. Several studies failed to find <b>any</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> convergence following the introduction of the euro after a phase of convergence in the early 1990s. Other studies have found evidence of price convergence, in particular for cars. A possible reason for the divergence between the different studies is that the processes of convergence may not have been linear, slowing down substantially between 2000 and 2003, and resurfacing after 2003 as suggested by a recent study (2009).|$|E
5|$|These organisms {{appear to}} form two groups: the fractal rangeomorphs and the simpler erniettomorphs. Including such fossils as the iconic Charnia and Swartpuntia, {{the group is}} both the most iconic of the Ediacaran biota and the most {{difficult}} to place within the existing tree of life. Lacking any mouth, gut, reproductive organs, or indeed <b>any</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> internal anatomy, their lifestyle was somewhat peculiar by modern standards; the most widely accepted hypothesis holds that they sucked nutrients out of the surrounding seawater by osmotrophy or osmosis. However, others argue against this.|$|E
5|$|By August16, {{the forward}} motion of Ana began to increase, and the storm quickly entered {{a region of}} dry, stable air. By the afternoon, a Hurricane Hunter {{reconnaissance}} mission did not find <b>any</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> tropical storm-force winds, resulting in Ana being downgraded to a tropical depression. It was determined in post-storm analysis, that Ana had degenerated into a tropical wave shortly afterwards, and {{was no longer a}} tropical cyclone. Several hours later, the system redeveloped convection as it raced towards the west-northwest at 26mph (42km/h). Early on August17, radar imagery from Guadeloupe and San Juan, Puerto Rico depicted a system without a closed, low-level circulation. Despite this, the NHC continued operational advisories until confirmation could be made with visible satellite imagery. Later that day, a final reconnaissance plane flew into the storm and did not find a low-level circulation. Following this, the NHC stated that Ana had dissipated off the coast of Puerto Rico, despite having already degenerated into a tropical wave the previous day. The remnants of Ana were once more monitored for signs of regeneration, but land interaction with Hispaniola and Cuba spoiled the system's chances of redevelopment.|$|E

5|$|Capturing bin Laden {{had been}} an {{objective}} of the U.S. government from the presidency of Bill Clinton {{until his death in}} 2011. Ijaz asserted that in 1996, prior to bin Laden's expulsion from Sudan, the Sudanese government allegedly offered to arrest and extradite him to the United States. Khartoum's offer included detailed intelligence about the growing militancy of Hezbollah, Hamas, Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood and Iran's Revolutionary Guard, among other groups operating in the region. Ijaz further asserted that U.S. authorities allegedly rejected each offer despite knowing of bin Laden's involvement in training terrorists in Somalia, some of whom were allegedly involved in supporting militia members that downed U.S. Black Hawk helicopters in Mogadishu in October 1993. <b>Any</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> bin Laden's involvement in criminal activity against U.S. interests, such as training militia members who attacked U.S. troops in 1993, could have been grounds for indicting him far before Sudan expelled the Saudi fugitive in May 1996.|$|E
5|$|Like other bleeding-hearts, the Sulu bleeding-heart is {{primarily}} a sedentary bird, feeding {{on the forest floor}} and flying only for short distances. Little is known about its behavior due to the paucity of sightings. Searches of Tawi-Tawi in 1971 and 1991 did not discover <b>any</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> the species' continued existence. Most of the bird's habitat was logged on Tawi-Tawi by 1994. However, an ethnobiological survey in 1995 revealed that the bleeding-heart was common until the 1970s and still survives on small islets near Tawi-Tawi. While another survey in 2009 failed to find the species, there is some hope that it may still persist. For this reason, it is currently listed as critically endangered by the IUCN. Any surviving population would be very small, likely numbering fewer than 50 individuals, and would be threatened by habitat destruction and uncontrolled hunting.|$|E
5|$|Located {{within an}} area of {{moderate}} southwesterly wind shear, the depression was slow to organize; early on October 14, a clear center was not depicted on Infrared satellite imagery. The depression moved to the west-northwest and gradually strengthened into Tropical Storm Nicholas late on October 14 while located 1,200miles (1,930km) east of the Windward Islands. On October 15, deep convection became much better organized, though the center of Nicholas remained displaced from the deepest of the shower activity. Despite the shear, the storm continued to strengthen as it moved to the west-northwest, a motion caused by a mid-level ridge to its north. On October 16, Nicholas transitioned from a sheared, unorganized system to a more organized system, {{as a result of}} banding features and improvement in its convective pattern due to lesser amounts of vertical shear and a healthier anticyclone over the storm. Nicholas continued to strengthen, and attained a peak intensity of 70mph (110km/h) on October 17 while located 875miles (1,410km) east of the Leeward Islands. Dvorak estimates suggested Nicholas potentially attained hurricane status, though microwave images of the storm showed a sheared system without <b>any</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> an eye feature.|$|E

5|$|There were gardens at Aberdour Castle from {{at least}} 1540. The terraced garden dates {{from the time of}} the 4th Earl of Morton, who succeeded in 1553, and {{comprises}} four broad L-shaped terraces. At the bottom of the terraces was an orchard, laid out in 1690, and recently replanted. The extent of the terracing was only rediscovered following excavations in the 1970s, after parts of the garden had been in use as a market garden. Archaeological investigations were undertaken between 1977 and 1980, to determine whether the lower terraces, which were depicted on a map of 1740, had indeed existed. Although the foundations of the terraces were found, the remains could not be precisely dated, but are thought to have been constructed in the second half of the 16th century. The high retaining walls were rebuilt in 1981, and the terraces were laid with grass, since the excavations had not revealed <b>any</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> historic planting schemes.|$|E
