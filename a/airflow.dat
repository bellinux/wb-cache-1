5|$|COPD {{is a type}} of obstructive {{lung disease}} in which chronic incompletely {{reversible}} poor <b>airflow</b> (<b>airflow</b> limitation) and inability to breathe out fully (air trapping) exist. The poor <b>airflow</b> is the result of breakdown of lung tissue (known as emphysema) and small airways disease (known as obstructive bronchiolitis). The relative contributions of these two factors vary between people. Severe destruction of small airways can lead to the formation of large air pockets—known as bullae—that replace lung tissue. This form of disease is called bullous emphysema.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilians were {{traditionally}} {{thought to}} breathe like mammals, with <b>airflow</b> {{moving in and}} out tidally, but studies published in 2010 and 2013 conclude that crocodilians breathe more like birds, with <b>airflow</b> moving in a unidirectional loop within the lungs. When a crocodilian inhales, air flows through the trachea and into two primary bronchi, or airways, which branch off into narrower secondary passageways. The air continues to move through these, then into even narrower tertiary airways, and then into other secondary airways which were bypassed the first time. The air then flows back into the primary airways and is exhaled back out. These aerodynamic valves within the bronchial tree have been hypothesised to explain how crocodilians can have unidirectional <b>airflow</b> without the aid of avian-like air sacs.|$|E
5|$|The lungs {{also play}} {{a pivotal role in}} speech by {{providing}} air and <b>airflow</b> for the creation of vocal sounds. Lungs also provide the <b>airflow</b> that enables the expression of many emotions such as sighing, yawning, sobbing, laughing in humans and the vocal sounds in other animals.|$|E
40|$|Recirculation of <b>airflows</b> in a mine {{ventilation}} system can cause concentration of contaminated air {{which results in}} an unsafe working environment for people working in an underground mine. Due to the difficulty in finding the recirculation of <b>airflows</b> in complicated mine {{ventilation system}}, depth-first search method is proposed to find the recirculation of <b>airflows</b> in complicated mine ventilation systems. The searching procedure of a simply depth-first search method is introduced briefly. Then the depth-first search method is modified for searching recirculation of <b>airflows</b> in complicated mine ventilation systems. The proposed method is implemented through MATLAB {{in the form of}} storing ventilation information in a matrix. A few recirculation of <b>airflows</b> are found and are confirmed by the mine ventilation simulation result. It is concluded that the proposed method is a valuable tool in finding recirculation of <b>airflows</b> in a complicated mine ventilation system...|$|R

30|$|Both members showed most <b>airflows</b> {{approaching}} {{the southern tip}} of the northern rainfall region from the south. In # 002, the <b>airflows</b> passed the southern rainfall region at 11 : 30 JST, and their potential temperature decreased before their arrival at the northern rainfall region. In # 006, in contrast, some <b>airflows</b> passed far to the east of the southern rainfall region, and their temperature did not decrease. After the passage of these <b>airflows</b> from the east of the southern rainfall region, their direction of movement was changed by the presence of low pressure near the rainfall region, causing them to approach {{the southern tip of}} the northern rainfall region. That is, the southern rainfall region in # 006 is deduced to have a smaller effect on the <b>airflows</b> that were supplied to the northern rainfall region. This difference of the paths, as a result, might be one reason why # 006 was able to generate intense vorticity near the northern rainfall region. This relationship between the southern rainfall and the intense vortex near the northern rainfall region was obtained with the NHM- 350 system. To confirm the existence of a corresponding observed relationship, observation data of <b>airflows</b> within the lower atmosphere over the Kanto Plain would be needed.|$|R
5|$|Bats are {{the only}} mammals that can truly fly. They fly through the air at a {{constant}} speed by moving their wings up and down (usually with some fore-aft movement as well). Because the animal is in motion, there is some <b>airflow</b> relative to its body which, combined with the velocity of the wings, generates a faster <b>airflow</b> moving over the wing. This generates a lift force vector pointing forwards and upwards, and a drag force vector pointing rearwards and upwards. The upwards components of these counteract gravity, keeping {{the body in the}} air, while the forward component provides thrust to counteract both the drag from the wing and from the body as a whole.|$|E

50|$|Spirometry classically {{reveals a}} {{reduction}} in the vital capacity (VC) with either a proportionate reduction in <b>airflows,</b> or increased <b>airflows</b> for the observed vital capacity. The latter finding reflects the increased lung stiffness (reduced lung compliance) associated with pulmonary fibrosis, which leads to increased lung elastic recoil.|$|R
40|$|A single unifying {{principle}} (based {{upon the}} nonlinear 'momentum-flux' effects produced when different {{components of a}} motion transport different components of its momentum) is used to give a broad scientific background to several aspects {{of the interaction between}} <b>airflows</b> and atmospheric sound. First, it treats the generation of sound by <b>airflows</b> of many different types. These include, for example, jet-like flows involving convected turbulent motions (with the resulting aeroacoustic radiation sensitively dependent on the Mach number of convection) and they include, as an extreme case, the supersonic 'boom' (shock waves generated by a supersonically convected flow pattern). Next, an analysis is given of sound propagation through nonuniformly moving <b>airflows,</b> and the exchange is quantified of energy between flow and sound; while, finally, problems are examined of how sound waves 'on their own' may generate the <b>airflows</b> known as acoustic streaming...|$|R

5|$|Several teams made {{modifications}} to their cars {{in preparation for}} the event. McLaren, Red Bull, and Williams all revised their front wings. McLaren's revision was designed to separate <b>airflow</b> into two separate channels, with both directing <b>airflow</b> around the outside of the car's front tyres. Red Bull's design, used in the Friday practice sessions, had two vertical slots to the rear of its endplate along with another to avoid creating a vortex when it operated with the planes and endplate. A previous design, debuted at the British Grand Prix, was used both in qualifying and in the race. In addition, the team used a revised diffuser to allow for better management of <b>airflow</b> {{to the top of the}} diffuser's side section. Williams's design debuted for the first time and was designed to make the tyre act like a diffuser which took air in to improve its efficiency.|$|E
40|$|This manual {{describes}} {{the computer program}} CONTAMW developed by NIST. CONTAMW is a multizone indoor air quality and ventilation analysis program designed to help you determine: <b>airflows</b> infiltration, exfiltration, and room-to-room <b>airflows</b> in building systems driven by mechanical means, wind pressures acting on {{the exterior of the}} building, and buoyancy effects induced by temperature differences between the building and the outside; contaminant concentrations the dispersal of airborne contaminants transported by these <b>airflows</b> and transformed by a variety of processes including chemical and radio-chemical transformation, adsorption and desorption to building materials, filtration, and deposition to building surfaces; and/or personal exposure the prediction of exposure of building occupants to airborne contaminants for eventual risk assessment. CONTAMW can be useful in a variety of applications. Its ability to calculate building <b>airflows</b> is useful for assessing the adequacy of ventilation rates in a building, to determine the variation in ventilation rates over time, to determine the distribution of ventilation air within a building, and to estimate the impact of envelope airtightening efforts on infiltration rates.

40|$|Anthropogenic {{impact on}} CO 2 levels was {{studied in the}} low-volume chamber {{connected}} with the low-profile corridor in Balcarka Cave, the show cave in Moravian Karst, {{during the period of}} limited ventilation. Modeling showed that the natural CO 2 levels were controlled by the CO 2 fluxes (up to ~ 3. 14 × 10 - 2 mol s- 1) from adjacent spaces. These fluxes changed with cave <b>airflows</b> and ventilation modes. Two main components of anthropogenic impact were recognized: (1) visitor breathing and (2) visitor movement. The CO 2 input derived from individual visitor groups varied from 1. 96 × 10 - 4 to 2. 45 × 10 - 3 mol s- 1, which was the significant part of the CO 2 fluxes from adjacent spaces. The visitor movement induced the <b>airflows</b> up to 0. 2 m 3 s- 1. They exceeded the natural <b>airflows</b> (up to 3. 2 × 10 - 3 m 3 s- 1) by factor of more than 60. These <b>airflows</b> caused cave ventilation mode’s switching and, significant drop of CO 2 fluxes/levels due to changed ventilation. The study therefore indicates that various anthropogenic influences in show cave can balance and neutralize each other, in dependence on cave morphology and seasonal conditions. Peer reviewe...|$|R

5|$|The {{inquiry report}} failed to {{identify}} a definite cause, although it was considered that the most likely cause was a spark from the signalling gear. It would have ignited the firedamp, exacerbated and fuelled by coal dust in the air. The report was critical of {{many aspects of the}} management's practices, and considered it had breached the mining regulations in respect of measuring and maintaining the air quality in the workings, and in the removal of coal dust from the tracks and walkways. The report pointed out that because the management had not implemented the changes needed to the ventilation fans as demanded by the Coal Mines Act 1911, the fans were unable to reverse the direction of the <b>airflow,</b> which would have blown the smoke out through the Lancaster shaft, although Redmayne and his colleagues held differing opinions on the advisability of reversing or stopping the <b>airflow.</b> The historian John H Brown, in his examination of the disaster, states that had the <b>airflow</b> been reversed, firedamp or afterdamp could have been extracted from some sectors into the blaze, causing another explosion.|$|E
5|$|This {{appeared}} {{to offer a}} solution {{to one of the}} most vexing problems of the era, designing an aircraft that was effective at subsonic and supersonic speeds. Subsonic lift is created by the <b>airflow</b> around the wing following streamlines, but supersonic lift is generated by shock waves at points of critical curvature. No single design could offer high performance for both regimes. The blown disk could attack this problem by being laid out for supersonic performance only, and then using jet thrust to modify subsonic <b>airflow</b> into a semblance of a normal wing. The resulting design would be tuned for high supersonic performance, have reasonable subsonic performance, and would also offer VTOL, all in a single design.|$|E
40|$|In todays society energy {{efficiency}} and energy savings are becoming increasingly important. The building sector represents {{a major part of}} Swedens total use of energy. Furthermore, ventilation constitutes the single largest factor in the energy balance of buildings. Hence, demand controlled ventilation, DCV, is an interesting and important field to study. The present work deals with DCV in general and the air ducting of DCV systems in particular. Principal aims are to define the concept of DCV and to analyze the technical consequences of variable <b>airflows</b> for the purpose of design guidance. DCV implies that <b>airflows</b> are controlled on demand. But it can also include the actual design of the ventilation system {{so that it can be}} adapted to future changes of demands. By controlling the amount of air energy can be saved. Heating energy is saved in direct proportion to the decrease in <b>airflows</b> and hours of operation. The drive energy for the operation of fans, however, does not automatically decrease when the <b>airflows</b> decreases. Thus, heating energy is always saved if the <b>airflows</b> goes down but not necessarily the drive energy for fans. The thesis includes definition and design criteria for duct systems regarding <b>airflows</b> and pressure conditions in. It describes the pressure levels in different parts of the air distribution system and the pressure conditions in low-pressure level and in low-pressure loss systems. The results show that it is possible to apply DCV to different structures of duct system. However, the duct system must have certain characteristics. These characteristics also result in additional advantages such as flexibility, stability and symmetry regardless of whether or not the system is a DCV  system. This also means that if the system does not have these characteristics, the effect on the ventilation systems functionality and energy usage can be substantial. There may also be consequences for the flexibility and stability of the system. This study highlights the need for further knowledge regarding pressure levels and losses in duct systems and basic data for correct calculation of pressure losses in duct systems. At present these calculations can only be done approximately and this can lead to systems with higher then necessary pressure levels and consequently higher use of energy...|$|R

5|$|Tobacco {{smoking is}} {{the most common cause of}} COPD, with factors such as air {{pollution}} and genetics playing a smaller role. In the developing world, one of the common sources of air pollution is poorly vented heating and cooking fires. Long-term exposure to these irritants causes an inflammatory response in the lungs, resulting in narrowing of the small airways and breakdown of lung tissue. The diagnosis is based on poor <b>airflow</b> as measured by lung function tests. In contrast to asthma, the <b>airflow</b> reduction does not improve much with the use of a bronchodilator.|$|E

40|$|Ventilation {{corresponds}} to {{a large part of}} the total energy use of a building and a lot of attention has been paid to how to reduce this energy use. However, much of this work on saving energy has been focused on reduction of the <b>airflows</b> and how this in turn reduces the energy use. In this study it is shown that lowered <b>airflows</b> does not automatically result in reduced fan energy. Instead this dissertation is focused on design of large and complex ventilation systems to obtain good function and low energy use, both the prerequisites for the design and actual solutions. In this work the energy use has been mostly limited to fan energy and how to reduce the pressure levels and flow resistances in the ventilation system. Another aspect that has not been widely studied is the interaction between demands and ventilation system design. This becomes important when working to optimise ventilation systems, and especially so for demand controlled ventilation systems. Demand control ventilation, DCV, is a concept that normally refers to a ventilation system with variable <b>airflows.</b> In such a system the <b>airflows</b> are reduced when the demands so permits in order to save energy. This study discusses the concept of DCV from a broader perspective and shows how the demands affect the ventilation system design. In systems with variable <b>airflows</b> pressure levels and pressure losses becomes even more important than in conventional systems with constant <b>airflows.</b> This dissertation is based on measurement studies combined with experiences gathered from building services engineers, manufacturers and so on, literature survey and basic fluid dynamics. Based on these results from the measurements simple models were made and used for simulations. Measurement results and calculations were than analyzed for both the air-conditioning and air distribution systems, using all this information some alternative ventilations system designs are presented and discussed. To show the saving potential for the fan energy with these new designs, calculations were done for an existing ventilation system in a hospital. Based on measurements and design data a basic model for this system was created. This showed that for this representative existing ventilation system it would be possible to save 14 % of the presently used fan energy. With improved motor technology of small fans these savings would increase to 32 %...|$|R
