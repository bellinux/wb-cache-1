Canon also served as NeXT's distributor in Japan.|$|E
5|$|Between Tests, Bradman rested himself {{during the}} match against Northamptonshire, which started {{the day after}} the Test, as Hassett led Australia to victory by an innings. He {{returned}} for the match against Yorkshire. Bradman came in at 1/0 when Barnes fell for a duck and top-scored with 54 as Australia made 249. Bradman pulled many short balls and reached 50 in 76 minutes. After the hosts replied with 209, Bradman came in at 1/17 and put on 154 for the second wicket with Brown, ending with 86 as the match petered into a draw. His innings ended when Hutton caught him in the leg trap. Not wanting to tire his bowlers before the Second Test that started the day <b>after</b> <b>next,</b> Bradman showed little intent to win the match. The batsmen batted unhurriedly and set Yorkshire 329 for victory with only 70 minutes of play remaining and the hosts ended at 4/85. Yardley expressed his displeasure by allowing his part-timers to bowl and then promoting tail-enders to the upper half of the batting order in the second innings. The Australians were booed from the field by the spectators.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time, coalitions of reformists and populist forces {{assembled}} in Popular Fronts. They concentrated largely on calls for autonomy rather than independence. The Supreme Soviet of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic made the Estonian language the state language again in January 1989, and similar legislation {{was passed in}} Latvia and Lithuania soon <b>after.</b> <b>Next,</b> the Baltic republics declared their sovereignty: in November 1988 in Estonia, in May 1989 in Lithuania and July 1989 in Latvia. The Estonian Supreme Soviet reserved the right to veto laws of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The Lithuanian Supreme Soviet even referred to Lithuania's independent past and its illegal annexation into the Soviet Union in 1940. The Supreme Soviet of the Latvian SSR was more cautious. The presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union condemned the Estonian legislation as unconstitutional.|$|E

2500|$|It {{has become}} known here that Charles Baird, long the leading figure in {{athletics}} at the University of Michigan, has sent his resignation to the faculty.... The popular leader will have no fear of the wolf for many a day to come. [...] At present he {{can be regarded as}} the richest man connected with the university; that is, by figuring on the wealth of his wife, Mrs. Baird, it has turned out, is the only heir to her father's estate in Kansas City. [...] Mrs. Baird's father died some time ago and left a fortune well over the $1,000,000 mark. [...] Consequently, Baird himself is anxious to make his home in Kansas City. [...] Baird also has a 'bug' about becoming a baseball magnate. [...] He, of course, loves athletics and is anxious to become an owner. [...] Rumours have him with the Kansas City American association club … The loss of Baird to the University of Michigan would be a severe blow to athletics. [...] The fact that Baird will leave probably is the cause of Coach Yost's hesitation about remaining <b>after</b> <b>next</b> year. [...] The two have worked like a team ever since Yost came here.|$|E

Imagine to yourself everything most profligate and shocking in the way of dancing and sitting down together. I can expose myself however, only once more, because he leaves the country soon <b>after</b> <b>next</b> Friday, on which day we are to have a dance at Ashe after all. He is a very gentlemanlike, good-looking, pleasant young man, I assure you. But as to our having ever met, except at the three last balls, I cannot say much; for he is so excessively laughed at about me at Ashe, that he is ashamed of coming to Steventon, and ran away when we called on Mrs. Lefroy a few days ago.[...] [...]After I had written the above, we received a visit from Mr. Tom Lefroy and his cousin George. The latter is really very well-behaved now; and as for the other, he has but one fault, which time will, I trust, entirely remove — it is that his morning coat is a great deal too light. He is a very great admirer of Tom Jones, and therefore wears the same coloured clothes, I imagine, which he did when he was wounded.|$|E
2500|$|In 1932, when Vishnu Deo {{needed a}} {{candidate}} to oppose a rebel candidate who had nominated for {{a seat in the}} Legislative Council against the call for boycott from Vishnu Deo and other leaders, K. B. Singh was an obvious choice. He was regarded as a loyal supporter of Vishnu Deo and common roll. K.B.Singh defeated his opponent for the Southern Indian Division, capturing 79 percent of the formal votes cast. [...] On 14 October 1932, under the guidance of Vishnu Deo, K.B. Singh [...] put forward a motion for common roll. The Governor convinced him that his fears were unfounded and asked him to withdraw the motion so that he could discuss it with the Secretary of State. Contrary to Vishnu Deo’s advice, he withdrew the motion. In February 1933, the Secretary of State informed the Legislative Council that it was impracticable to have common roll. K.B. Singh resigned and was re-elected with Vishnu Deo’s support (with an increased majority of 94% over the same rival). He took his seat in the Legislative Council, contrary to Vishnu Deo’s instructions and evaded the common roll issue. He was denounced in public meetings organised by Vishnu Deo and his associates but was rewarded by the Government by being made Justice of Peace. On 23 March 1934, he introduced another motion for common roll which was defeated but its consequence was that new motion could not be introduced immediately <b>after</b> <b>next</b> election.|$|E
