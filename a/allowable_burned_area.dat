40|$|Biomass {{burning in}} {{southern}} Africa has brought significant {{challenges to the}} research society as a fundamental driver of climate and land cover changes. <b>Burned</b> <b>area</b> mapping approaches have been developed that generate large-scale low and moderate resolution products made with different satellite data.

Generally, the satellite-derived <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> products produced with dissimilar algorithms provide mapped <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> at different levels of accuracy, as the environmental and remote sensing factors vary both spatially and temporally. This study focused on the inter-comparison and accuracy evaluation of the 500 -meter Moderate Resolution Imaging Spetroradiomter (MODIS) <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> product (MCD 45 A 1) and the Backup MODIS <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> product (hereafter BMBAP) across the main-fire prone South African biomes using reference data independently-derived from multi-temporal 30 -meter Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery distributed over six validation sites. The accuracy of the products was quantified using confusion matrices, linear regression and subpixel <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> measures. The results revealed that the highest <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> mapping accuracies were reported in the fynbos and grassland biomes by the MCD 45 A 1 product, following the BMBAP product across the pine forest and savanna biomes, respectively. Further, the MCD 45 A 1 product presented higher subpixel detection probabilities for the <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> fractions 50 % of a MODIS pixel.

40|$|We {{present a}} method for {{estimating}} monthly <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> globally at 1 &deg;&nbsp;spatial resolution using Terra MODIS data and ancillary vegetation cover information. Using regression trees constructed for 14 different global regions, MODIS active fire observations were calibrated to ''true'' <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> estimates derived from 500 -m MODIS imagery based on the conventional assumption that <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> is proportional to counts of fire pixels. Unlike earlier methods, we allow the constant of proportionality to vary {{as a function of}} tree and herbaceous vegetation cover, and the mean size of monthly cumulative fire-pixel clusters. In areas undergoing active deforestation, we implemented a subsequent correction based on tree cover information and a simple measure of fire persistence. Regions showing good agreement between predicted and observed <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> included Boreal Asia, Central Asia, Europe, and Temperate North America, where the estimates produced by the regression trees were relatively accurate and precise. Poorest agreement was found for southern-hemisphere South America, where predicted values of <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> are both inaccurate and imprecise; this is most likely a consequence of multiple factors that include extremely persistent cloud cover, and degradation {{of the quality of the}} 500 -m <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> maps used for calibration.

40|$|Carnivores play {{a central}} role in {{ecosystem}} processes by exerting top-down control, while fire exerts bottom-up control in ecosystems throughout the world, yet, little is known about how fire affects short-term carnivore distributions across the landscape. Through the use of a long-term data set we investigated the distribution of lions, during the daytime, in relation to <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. We found that lions avoid <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> despite the fact that herbivores, their prey, are attracted to <b>burned</b> <b>areas.</b> Prey attraction, however, likely results from the reduction in cover caused by burning, that may thereby decrease lion hunting success. Lions also do not preferentially utilize the edges of <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> over unburned areas despite the possibility that edges would combine the benefit of cover with proximity to abundant prey. Despite the fact that lions avoid <b>burned</b> <b>areas,</b> lion territory size and reproductive success were not affected by the proportion of the territory burned each year. Therefore, burning does not seem to reduce lion fitness perhaps because of the heterogeneity of <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> across the landscape or because it is possible that when hunting at night lions visit <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> despite their daytime avoidance of these areas [Current Zoology 59 (3) : 335 – 339, 2013]...|$|R

Some of the variability in <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> is predictable on seasonal timescales because fuel characteristics respond to the cumulative effects of climate prior to {{the onset of the}} fire season. Here we systematically evaluated the degree to which annual <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> from the Global Fire Emissions Database version 4 with small fires (GFED 4 s) can be predicted using SSTs from 14 different ocean regions. We found that about 48 of global <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> can be forecast with a correlation coefficient that is significant at a p < 0. 01 level using a single ocean climate index (OCI) 3 or more months prior to the month of peak burning. Continental regions where <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> had a higher degree of predictability included equatorial Asia, where 92 % of the <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> exceeded the correlation threshold, and Central America, where 86 % of the <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> exceeded this threshold. Pacific Ocean indices describing the El Nino-Southern Oscillation were more important than indices from other ocean basins, accounting for about 1 / 3 of the total predictable global <b>burned</b> <b>area.</b> A model that combined two indices from different oceans considerably improved model performance, suggesting that fires in many regions respond to forcing from more than one ocean basin. Using OCI-burned area relationships and a clustering algorithm, we identified 12 hotspot regions in which fires had a consistent response to SST patterns.

This paper presents a method to mapping <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> from satellite images. The study area was the Parque das Emas, that suffered an important wildfire from 12 to 14 August 2010. Thus, the main objective is to develop a method to map accurately the <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> from optical satellite images, specifically, from data recorded by the MODerate Image Spectrometer (MODIS) onboard of TERRA satellite. The method we proposed is based on Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA).

The sampling effort was standardized in relation to the area in the 11 fire locations surveyed using transects. Results: Single <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> contained 0 to 15 open-habitat species (mean = 7. 6), and in all the areas combined there were 22 species, including 17 with an unfavourable conservation status in Europe. The most frequent were Carduelis cannabina, Lullula arborea, Alectoris rufa, Oenanthe hispanica and Emberiza cia, but characteristic steppe-land birds such as O. leucura, Calandrella brachydactyla and C. rufescens also bred in particular <b>burned</b> <b>areas.</b> After controlling for the extent of the species range in the Spanish distribution Atlas, passerine occurrence in <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> was positively related to the species’ habitat breadth in a gradient of unburned habitats. Cluster analysis separated a species-poor group of fire locations from a species-rich group, and showed that some neighbouring areas had a similar species composition. However, there was no spatial autocorrelation between <b>burned</b> <b>areas,</b> and species composition was correlated with the fire extent (Mantel test).

In this work, Système pour l’Observation de la Terre (SPOT) - 4 HRVIR images are introduced in an object-based classification environment in order to develop a classification procedure for <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> mapping.

40|$|A map of burn {{severity}} {{resulting from}} the 1988 fires that occurred in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) was derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery and {{used to assess the}} isolation of <b>burned</b> <b>areas,</b> the heterogeneity that resulted from fires burning under moderate and severe burning conditions, and the relationship between heterogeneity and fire size. About 80 % of the park is covered with coniferous forests dominated by lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia). The majority of severely <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> were within close proximity (50 to 200 m) to unburned or lightly <b>burned</b> <b>areas,</b> suggesting that few burned sites are very far from potential sources of propagules for plant re-establishment. Fires that occurred under moderate burning conditions early during the 1988 fire season resulted in a lower proportion of crown fire than fires that occurred under severe burning conditions later in the season. Increased dominance and contagion of burn severity classes and decrease in the edge:area ratio for later fires indicated a slightly more aggregated burn pattern compared to early fires. The proportion of <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> in different <b>burn</b> severity classes varied as a function of daily fire size. When daily <b>area</b> <b>burned</b> was relatively low, the proportion of <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> in each <b>burn</b> severity class varied widely. When daily <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> exceeded 1250 ha, the <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> contained about 50 % crown fire, 30 % severe surface burn, and 20 % light surface burn. Understanding the effect of fire on landscape heterogeneity is important because the kinds, amounts, and spatial distribution of <b>burned</b> and unburned <b>areas</b> may influence the reestablishment of plant species on burned sites...|$|R

40|$|We {{explore the}} large spatial {{variation}} {{in the relationship between}} population density and <b>burned</b> <b>area,</b> using continental-scale Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) based on 13 years of satellite-derived <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> maps from the global fire emissions database (GFED) and the human population density from the gridded population of the world (GPW 2005). Significant relationships are observed over 51. 5 % of the global land area, and the area affected varies from continent to continent: population density has a significant impact on fire over most of Asia and Africa but is important in explaining fire over < 22 % of Europe and Australia. Increasing population density is associated with both increased and decreased in fire. The nature of the relationship depends on land-use: increasing population density is associated with increased burned are in rangelands but with decreased <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> in croplands. Overall, the relationship between population density and <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> is non-monotonic: <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> initially increases with population density and then decreases when population density exceeds a threshold.

40|$|Abstract. Information on the {{temporal}} and spatial patterns of forest fires can contribute to efficient forest fire management. To evaluate the readjustment of forest fire precautionary periods and to provide information for forest fire prevention and suppression strategies, {{the temporal}} and spatial characteristics of forest fire occurrences and spread in Korea were analysed using statistics from 1970 to 2003. Monthly forest fire occurrences and <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> were examined using time-series analysis, and F-tests were conducted among forest fire occurrences, <b>burned</b> <b>area,</b> and fire area growth rate to understand monthly forest fire characteristics. To understand the spatial characteristics of forest fires, cities and counties with similar forest fire characteristics were grouped based on cluster analysis of forest fire occurrences and spread characteristics. A seasonal exponential smoothing model was selected for forest fire occurrences and <b>burned</b> <b>area.</b> The number of mean annual forest fire occurrences was 429, and mean annual <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> was 2908 ha year− 1 in Korea. The seasonal differences in forest fire characteristics were clearly distinguished, with 61 % of total forest fire occurrences and 90 % of total <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> being in March andApril. Forest fire precautionary periods are suggested based on forest fire occurrence patterns. A total of 226 cities and counties throughout the country were classified into three groups. Group 1, which had frequent forest fire occurrences with smaller <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> and slower fire growth area rates, was distributed {{in the western part}} of Korea and metropolitan regions.

40|$|The data on {{forest fires}} in Portugal {{in the period}} 1980 – 2015 {{were used in the}} research: the annual number of forest fires, the annual <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> and the average <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> per fire. Increasing trend of the annual number of forest fires (statistically {{significant}} at p≤ 0. 01), non-significant increasing trend of the annual <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> and decreasing trend of the average <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> per fire (statistically significant at p≤ 0. 01) were recorded. Portugal is the most endangered country by forest fires in comparison with the other European countries. During the research period, fires in Portugal covered 23. 6 % of the total <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> in five the most affected European countries (Portugal, Spain, France, Italy and Greece). In the research of the connection between forest fires and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) Pearson correlation coefficient (R) was used. Monthly, seasonal and annual values of the AMO index were used in calculations. All R values recorded for the annual number of fires were positive and statistically significant at p≤ 0. 01. The highest values were recorded for August (0. 543) and for summer (0. 525). With the annual <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> all R values were also positive and the highest one on the seasonal level was for summer (0. 359). With the average <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> per fire all R values were negative (− 0. 428 was recorded for winter).

40|$|The extent, {{frequency}} {{and intensity of}} forest fires in Mediterranean regions have become an important problem in recent decades. Nowadays, remote sensing is an essential tool for the planning {{and management of the}} land at different scales. In the field of forest fires remote sensing images have been used in many different types of studies and currently applied to detect <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> by means of images, providing quickly, easily and affordable the limits of <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> immediately during or after the fire season. The importance of these products lies in the possibility to obtain perimeter, area and damage level caused by wildfires. The objective of this study was the evaluation of multi-scale remotely sensed images and various mapping methods for the identification and estimation of <b>burned</b> <b>areas.</b> The area of the study was situated in Galicia, a region of Spain punished year after year by important wildfires. By employing 7 images before, during and after the occurrence of forest fires, and working with different methods it was possible the collection of several products and results. The satellite imagery used was Landsat TM 5 and MODIS, and the methods carried out were mainly spectral indices such as Normalized Burnt Ratio (NBR), Short Wave InfraRed Index (SWIR), Burnt Area Index (BAI), Burnt Area Index for MODIS (BAIM) and supervised classifications. Based on a wide literature review there were selected as suitable techniques for assess, localize and quantify <b>burned</b> <b>areas.</b> The work was separated in two sections, being differenced monotemporal and multitemporal analyses, depending on the images involved in each part. The results showed that which indices can distinguish <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> with the high precision. There were found common problems of all indices as the classification of <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> in shaded regions as unburned areas. Landsat images proved to be the most accurate images to perform studies with <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> due to its high spatial resolution comparing with MODIS images. As a final products were obtained with precision the total <b>burned</b> <b>area,</b> the perimeter, the localization and the burn severity of the regions affected by wildfires. The data obtained could be used to create a database of <b>burned</b> <b>areas,</b> or based in the repetitive patterns, as useful information in order to prevent future forest fires...|$|R
40|$|In several biomes, {{including}} croplands, wooded savannas, {{and tropical}} forests, many small fires occur each year {{that are well}} below the detection limit of {{the current generation of}} global <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> products derived from moderate resolution surface reflectance imagery. Although these fires often generate thermal anomalies that can be detected by satellites, their contributions to <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> and carbon fluxes have not been systematically quantified across different regions and continents. Here we developed a preliminary method for combining 1 -km thermal anomalies (active fires) and 500  m <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to estimate the influence of these fires. In our approach, we calculated the number of active fires inside and outside of 500  m burn scars derived from reflectance data. We estimated small fire <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> by computing the difference normalized burn ratio (dNBR) for these two sets of active fires and then combining these observations with other information. In a final step, we used the Global Fire Emissions Database version 3 (GFED 3) biogeochemical model to estimate the impact of these fires on biomass burning emissions. We found that the spatial distribution of active fires and 500  m <b>burned</b> <b>areas</b> were in close agreement in ecosystems that experience large fires, including savannas across southern Africa and Australia and boreal forests in North America and Eurasia. In other areas, however, we observed many active fires outside of <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> perimeters. Fire radiative power was lower for this class of active fires. Small fires substantially increased <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> in several continental-scale regions, including Equatorial Asia (157 %), Central America (143 %), and Southeast Asia (90 %) during 2001 – 2010. Globally, accounting for small fires increased total <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> by approximately by 35 %, from 345 Mha/yr to 464 Mha/yr. A formal quantification of uncertainties was not possible, but sensitivity analyses of key model parameters caused estimates of global <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> increases from small fires to vary between 24 % and 54 %. Biomass burning carbon emissions increased by 35 % at a global scale when small fires were included in GFED 3, from 1. 9 Pg C/yr to 2. 5 Pg C/yr. The contribution of tropical forest fires to year-to-year variability in carbon fluxes increased because small fires amplified emissions from Central America, South America and Southeast Asia—regions where drought stress and <b>burned</b> <b>area</b> varied considerably from year to year in response to El Nino-Southern Oscillation and other climate modes...|$|R
