5|$|Manju (Sripriya) {{was raised}} in a {{dysfunctional}} family that consisted of a timid father and a philandering mother; she hurtles from one disastrous affair to another, leading to her degenerating into a cynical woman. Into her life enter two radically different men. One of them is her boss, Thyagu (Rajinikanth), who owns the advertising agency she works for. He is a stereotype of the successful man: money-minded, opinionated, arrogant, and a male chauvinist. In sharp contrast is Arun (Kamal Haasan), who has come to Chennai from Coimbatore to make a documentary on women. Sensitive <b>and</b> <b>sincere,</b> he believes his job has a purpose and is both shocked and amused at the cynical attitudes of Manju and Thyagu.|$|E
5|$|The Headphone Masterpiece is {{the debut}} album by American {{recording}} artist Cody Chesnutt. He recorded the album {{in his home}} bedroom with a 4-track recorder and played guitar, bass, keyboard, and an organ. A 36-song double album, The Headphone Masterpiece features neo soul and lo-fi music, and distorted, overdubbed production. It was written and arranged by Chesnutt, whose ironic <b>and</b> <b>sincere</b> lyrics reflect on personal experiences such as {{falling in love with}} his wife and reconciling his love for rock and roll with the drawbacks of the rock lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|At the 1920 elections, {{domestic}} interests aligned {{against those}} of the BSAC, rather than unreservedly in favour of responsible government. The run up to the 1922 referendum was long and acrimonious. For the Union were most of the leading citizens of Salisbury and Bulawayo, the British, South African and Rhodesian presses, the BSAC, and the British government. Against them was the Responsible Government Association, founded in 1917 by Ethel Tawse Jollie. Wallis, in his biography of Coghlan, One Man's Hand, gives him {{the credit for the}} victory of the responsible government lobby. Lewis Hastings, reviewing Wallis's book, recalls campaigning with Coghlan and says that he was the undisputed leader of the movement—highly competent, with a clear vision, principled <b>and</b> <b>sincere.</b> He attributes Coghlan's resolve to his years in Kimberley, where he experienced the autocratic rule of the De Beers mining company, owned by the BSAC.|$|E

5|$|Journalist Ralph McGill, once a {{teammate}} of Cody's, said: He {{was a great}} big fellow {{and one of the}} most seriously dedicated fellows I've ever met. He was a farm boy and he didn't have any polish but he was very honest <b>and</b> <b>sincere.</b> He didn't have scholarshipwe had none in those days but he had a real job. He literally cleaned the gymnasium every day, cleaned up the locker rooms and the showers, and tended to the coal furnace after practice. He was a big man, squarely built, quiet, almost shy, and enormously decent. He practiced long hours to place kick and became the team's place kicker. He wasn't fast, but he was fast for a big man. He didn't like to wear pads. He got a hold of an old quilt and sewed it to the shoulders of the jersey and that was all the padding he wore.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, DCP Prabhakar and Sub-inspector Chari, who is Ambi's friend, {{investigate}} the murders committed by Anniyan. In disguises, they discover clues {{left behind by}} Anniyan, which are {{the names of the}} punishments he meted out to his victims. Prabhakar is determined to bring Anniyan to justice as one of Anniyan's victims, Chockalingam, an errant catering contractor with the Indian Railways, was his elder brother. In a dramatic publicity stunt, Anniyan admits to the murders he committed when he appears amidst the public and the press at the Nehru Stadium. He explains the rationale behind them and says that only when every Indian is responsible <b>and</b> <b>sincere</b> will the country prosper on a par with developed nations. His methods draw both praise and criticism. Prabhakar tries to catch Anniyan, but he escapes.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, the Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) {{was held}} in Havana, where Castro was {{selected}} as NAM president, a position he held till 1982. In his capacity as both President of the NAM and of Cuba he appeared at the United Nations General Assembly in October 1979 and gave a speech on the disparity between the world's rich and poor. His speech was greeted with much applause from other world leaders, though his standing in NAM was damaged by Cuba's abstinence from the U.N.'s General Assembly condemnation of the Soviet war in Afghanistan. Cuba's relations across North America improved under Mexican President Luis Echeverría, Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, and U.S. President Jimmy Carter. Carter continued criticizing Cuba's human rights abuses, but adopted a respectful approach which gained Castro's attention. Considering Carter well-meaning <b>and</b> <b>sincere,</b> Castro freed certain political prisoners and allowed some Cuban exiles to visit relatives on the island, hoping that in turn Carter would abolish the economic embargo and stop CIA support for militant dissidents. Conversely, his relationship with China declined, as he accused Deng Xiaoping's Chinese government of betraying their revolutionary principles by initiating trade links with the U.S. and attacking Vietnam.|$|E

5|$|In {{over half}} of his feature films, Cooper portrayed Westerners, soldiers, pilots, sailors, and explorers—all men of action. In the rest he played {{a wide range of}} characters, {{included}} doctors, professors, artists, architects, clerks, and baseball players. Cooper's heroic screen image changed with each period of his career. In his early films, he played the young naive hero sure of his moral position and trusting in the triumph of simple virtues (The Virginian). After becoming a major star, his Western screen persona was replaced by a more cautious hero in adventure films and dramas (A Farewell to Arms). During the height of his career, from 1936 to 1943, he played a new type of hero—a champion of the common man willing to sacrifice himself for others (Mr. Deeds, Meet John Doe, and For Whom the Bell Tolls). In the post-war years, Cooper attempted broader variations on his screen image, which now reflected a hero increasingly at odds with the world who must face adversity alone (The Fountainhead and High Noon). In his final films, Cooper's hero rejects the violence of the past, and seeks to reclaim lost honor and find redemption (Friendly Persuasion and Man of the West). The screen persona he developed and sustained throughout his career represented the ideal American hero—a tall, handsome, <b>and</b> <b>sincere</b> man of steadfast integrity who emphasized action over intellect, and combined the heroic qualities of the romantic lover, the adventurer, and the common man.|$|E
5|$|Tracy Jordan's storyline {{in which}} his former nanny writes a tell-all book {{revealing}} {{that he has never}} actually had an affair with anyone mirrored—though in reversal—the real life of professional golfer Tiger Woods' extramarital affairs scandal that occurred in late 2009. In one scene, it is revealed that women have come forward admitting to never have had a sexual relationship with Tracy; After news broke of Woods's infidelities, numerous women came forward admitting to having affairs with the golfer. To re-establish his womanizing persona, Tracy holds a press conference announcing he is leaving show business {{to spend more time with}} a stripper; In December 2009, Woods announced he would take an indefinite leave from professional golf to focus on his marriage after he admitted infidelity. Other women, who Tracy did not have a relationship with, have released voice mails to the news media. In one of them, Tracy leaves a message to his wife, Angie (Sherri Shepherd), in which he is loving <b>and</b> <b>sincere</b> in the message; One of Woods's mistress produced voice and text messages as evidence of a relationship with the golfer. As a result of him being outed as monogamous, Tracy loses various endorsements; After admitting to his affairs, Woods lost various endorsement deals with different companies.|$|E

25|$|Often {{overlooked}} in Confucian ethics are the virtues to the self: sincerity and {{the cultivation of}} knowledge.

Cultivating knowledge and sincerity is also important for one's own sake; the superior person loves learning {{for the sake of}} learning and righteousness for the sake of righteousness.|$|E
