5|$|An {{individual}} mandate {{coupled with}} subsidies for private insurance {{as a means}} for universal healthcare was considered the best way to win the support of the Senate because it had been included in prior bipartisan reform proposals. The concept goes back to at least 1989, when the conservative The Heritage Foundation proposed an individual mandate as an alternative to single-payer health care. It was championed for a time by conservative economists and Republican senators as a market-based approach to healthcare reform on the basis of individual responsibility and avoidance of free rider problems. Specifically, because the 1986 Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) requires any hospital participating in Medicare (nearly <b>all</b> <b>do)</b> to provide emergency care to anyone who needs it, the government often indirectly bore the cost of those without the ability to pay.|$|E

25|$|Many theorems from {{classical}} geometry {{hold true}} for spherical geometry as well, but not <b>all</b> <b>do</b> because the sphere fails to satisfy some of classical geometry's postulates, including the parallel postulate. In spherical trigonometry, angles are defined between great circles. Spherical trigonometry differs from ordinary trigonometry in many respects. For example, {{the sum of}} the interior angles of a spherical triangle always exceeds 180degrees. Also, any two similar spherical triangles are congruent.|$|E
25|$|Arborists who climb (as not <b>all</b> <b>do)</b> can use {{a variety}} of {{techniques}} to ascend into the tree. The least invasive, and most popular technique used is to ascend on rope. There are two common methods of climbing, Single Rope Technique (SRT) and Double Rope Technique (DRT or DdRT). When personal safety is an issue, or the tree is being removed, arborists may use 'spikes', (also known as 'gaffs' or 'spurs') attached to their chainsaw boots with straps to ascend and work. Spikes wound the tree, leaving small holes where each step has been.|$|E
25|$|None of the Cherokee in the North {{were present}} at the treaty. Later that month, Gen. Wayne {{sent a message to}} Long Hair (Gitlugunahita), leader of those who {{remained}} in the Ohio country, that they should come in and sue for peace. In response, Long Hair replied that all of them would return south as soon as they finished the harvest. However, they did not <b>all</b> <b>do</b> so; at least one, called Shoe Boots (Dasigiyagi), stayed in the area until 1803, so it's likely others did as well.|$|E

25|$|Most {{assemblies}} do {{not take}} an offering during the time their Sunday sermons are preached; but some, not <b>all,</b> <b>do</b> take an offering at the Breaking of Bread meetings. Only those in fellowship are expected to give. Many assemblies see tithing (the giving of 10 percent of one's income) as a commandment for Israel from the Old Testament law and not binding on Christians, although some assemblies do encourage tithing. Instead, the amount given is normally left to the giver and is a private matter {{between the individual and}} the Lord.|$|E
25|$|Resonant {{vibrational}} modes due to {{vertical loads}} (such as trains, traffic, pedestrians) and wind loads are well understood in bridge design. In {{the case of}} the Millennium Bridge, because the lateral motion caused the pedestrians loading the bridge to directly participate with the bridge, the vibrational modes had not been anticipated by the designers. The crucial point is that when the bridge lurches to one side, the pedestrians must adjust to keep from falling over, and they <b>all</b> <b>do</b> this at exactly the same time.|$|E
25|$|After World War II {{the numbers}} stayed fairly stable: there were 435 Estonian Swedes in 1970, 254 in 1979 and 297 in 1989, when they placed 26th {{on the list}} of Estonia's {{minority}} groups (before the Second World War, they were third in number, after Russians and Germans). The 2000 census shows a number of 300, placing Swedes at 20th {{on the list of}} Estonia's minority groups. However, only 211 of them are Estonian citizens. Since <b>all</b> <b>do</b> not claim their real ethnic background, some have estimated the real number of Estonian Swedes in Estonia to be about 1,000.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, while UN-Habitat reports some slums are more exposed to crimes with higher crime rates (for instance, the {{traditional}} inner-city slums), crime {{is not the}} direct resultant of block layout in many slums. Rather crime {{is one of the}} symptoms of slum dwelling; thus slums consist of more victims than criminals. Consequently, slums in <b>all</b> <b>do</b> not have consistently high crime rates; slums have the worst crime rates in sectors maintaining influence of illicit economy – such as drug trafficking, brewing, prostitution and gambling –. Often in such circumstance, multiple gangs fight for control over revenue.|$|E
25|$|Recent Mesothelae are {{characterized}} by the narrow sternum on the ventral side of the prosoma. Several plesiomorphic characteristics {{may be useful in}} recognizing these spiders: there are tergite plates on the dorsal side and the almost-median position of the spinnerets on the ventral side of the opisthosoma. Although it has been claimed that they lack venom glands and ducts, which almost all other spiders feature, subsequent works have demonstrated that at least some, possibly <b>all,</b> <b>do</b> in fact have both the glands and ducts. All Mesothelae have eight spinnerets in four pairs. Like mygalomorph spiders, they have two pairs of book lungs.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{noticed that the}} {{elements}} in the boron group have similar physical properties, although most of boron's are exceptional. For example, all of the elements in the boron group, except for boron itself, are soft. Moreover, {{all of the other}} elements in group 13 are relatively reactive at moderate temperatures, while boron's reactivity only becomes comparable at very high temperatures. One characteristic that <b>all</b> <b>do</b> have in common is having three electrons in their valence shells. Boron, being a metalloid, is a thermal and electrical insulator at room temperature, but a good conductor of heat and electricity at high temperatures. Unlike boron, the metals in the group are good conductors under normal conditions. This is in accordance with the long-standing generalization that all metals conduct heat and electricity better than most non-metals.|$|E

25|$|It {{caused him}} to reflect. But there was no result. The {{justice of the peace}} was a stern man. On the trial he found fault with the scheme and {{required}} us to explain upon what we based our strange conduct—as he called it. The understudy said:“On the custom of the niggers. They <b>all</b> <b>do</b> it.” The justice forgot his dignity and descended to sarcasm. “Custom of the niggers! Are our morals so inadequate that we have to borrow of niggers?” Then he said to the jury: “Three melons were owing; they were collected from persons not proven to owe them: this is theft; they were collected by compulsion: this is extortion. A melon was added for the widows and orphans. It was owed by no one. It is another theft, another extortion. Return it whence it came, with the others. It is not permissible here to apply to any purpose goods dishonestly obtained; not even to the feeding of widows and orphans, for this would be to put a shame upon charity and dishonor it.” He said it in open court, before everybody, and to me it did not seem very kind.|$|E
