40|$|The {{literature}} review {{in this thesis}} is {{an exploration of the}} recent emphasis in policy on the equality of mental health services for minority ethnic clients, with a focus on cultural competence models in clinical psychology. The review is based on a textual analysis of a policy document to consider whether cultural competence is a promotion or restriction of equality. The policy and models of cultural competence were found to employ essentialist definitions that could be an issue in developing appropriate and relevant services. It is argued that a context-specific and flexible interpretation of culture is required. The empirical research examines clinical psychological discourses about working with minority ethnic clients. It discusses an interview study and a group discussion study conducted among clinical psychologists. Drawing on discourse analysis this research examines the interpretative repertoires and discursive strategies that psychologists use in their accounts of working with minority ethnic clients, and how these construct a particular version of cultural competence. In the interviews, an interpretative framework in terms of 'social context' involved a consideration of the client's cultural background, and an interpretative framework of 'individual context' was considered to be a way of formulating the client's own interpretation of cultural background. In the group discussion, the key interpretative framework was the 'individual/curious' repertoire, which also focused on understanding cultural background from the client's interpretation. It is shown that in using these repertoires the psychologists' construction of cultural competence oscillates between a risk of reifying minority ethnic groups and <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>neglecting</b> issues such as ethnic discrimination. Based upon the literature and empirical parts, the reflective part of this thesis considers the researchers orientation to the research, in terms of epistemology, and as a minority ethnic researcher conducting research on the subject of minorities.

40|$|From the Introduction]. To {{speak about}} {{fundamental}} rights in Europe poses <b>a</b> certain <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>neglecting</b> the complexity <b>of</b> the multiple systems of protection of fundamental rights on the European continent. There are three systems {{to be taken}} into account: (1) national constitutions, (2) the Council of Europe’s European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and the system of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms established in the European Union/Community. Yet, it does not suffice to discuss these three systems separately. The main difficulty when speaking about fundamental rights in Europe is to reveal and analyse the mutual interactions and links between these systems. This paper examines the status of commercial speech {{in the context of the}} protection of rights under the European Convention on Human Rights and in the European Community...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Toddlers are a {{vulnerable}} population for child abuse. The present study examines {{the relationship between}} psychological problems in toddlers and the risk for child abuse. Insight in this relation can help in the prevention and early detection of child maltreatment. The focus is on emotional problems, behaviour problems, hyperactivity- and attention problems and social problems. The definition of child abuse is divided in physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse and neglect. It was expected that psychological problems in toddlers increase the risk for child maltreatment. Method. Data from several questionnaires {{was used for the}} present study. A total of 295 participants in the ages of 2 - 4 years old from 60 locations of early education centres in Utrecht, the Netherlands, participated in this study. Lineair regression analyses have been used {{to examine the relationship between}} the concepts psychological problems and child maltreatment. Results. All kinds of psychological problems tested in this study were positively associated with <b>a</b> higher <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>neglect</b> and emotional maltreatment. Due to constant scores on the variables sexual and physical maltreatment, no judgment could be made about this forms of abuse. Conclusion. This research is of added value because more attention will be given to children with psychological problems in the future. As such, their higher risk for maltreatment can be reduced or even prevented. Suggestions for future research and limitations are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{doctoral}} education process is to create and legitimize scholarly researchers. This transformation, from student to scholar, is widely discussed in the literature. However, recent rapid changes in university culture have resulted in less time for supervision, stricter completion deadlines, and a greater focus on efficiency and productivity. This has {{had an impact on}} this transition process, and this impact has not been widely studied. The aim {{of this article is to}} understand the consequences of the current trends for PhD students and the education of PhD students in general. The article is based on interviews with 14 international students from two different research programs at the Faculty of Engineering and Science at Aalborg University in Denmark. The case of international PhD students in a western setting is singled out as a challenging case for becoming a legitimate scholar, since they face the additional challenge of becoming socialised into their new foreign setting. Overall, the study concludes that the transition process of doctoral students is affected by the way different supervisors deal with current university trends and how PhD students fit or do not fit into their knowledge production practices. The study identifies matches or mismatches in a knowledge production perspective, quality of contact, and degree of independence of the PhD student as factors that influence whether a transition process can be marked as sound, troublesome, or lacking. Finally, the study identifies <b>an</b> overall <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>neglecting</b> the more interdependent types of international PhD students. Suggestions are given as how to address this risk...|$|R
40|$|The paper re-expresses and {{complements}} {{arguments against}} the normative validity of expected utility theory in Robin Pope (1983, 1991 a, 1991 b, 1985, 1995, 2000, 2001, 2005, 2006, 2007). The objections concern the <b>neglect</b> <b>of</b> the evolving stages of knowledge ahead (stages {{of what the}} future will bring) when such evolution is fundamental to <b>an</b> experience <b>of</b> <b>risk.</b> This <b>neglect</b> entails <b>a</b> disregard of emotional and financial effects on well-being before <b>a</b> particular <b>risk</b> is resolved. Problems of the time structure <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> are investigated in a simple temporal framework restricted to a subclass of temporal lotteries {{in the sense of}} David Kreps and Evan Porteus (1978). This subclass is narrow but wide enough to discuss basic issues. It will be shown that there are serious objections against the modification of expected utility theory axiomatised by Kreps and Porteus (1978, 1979). By contrast the umbrella theory proffered by Pope that she has now termed SKAT, the Stages of Knowledge Ahead Theory, offers an epistemically consistent framework within which to construct particular models to deal with particular decision situations. A model by Caplin and Leahy (2001) will also be discussed and contrasted with the modelling within SKAT (Pope, Leopold and Leitner 2006) ...|$|R
40|$|Internationalisation {{of higher}} {{education}} is a current theme in research and politics {{of higher education}}. The theme in this paper is related to present developments and concerns of the growing border-crossing activities that take place between nations and their systems of Higher Education. Higher education {{is expected to be}} based on research, research to be an international activity, and the universities to have an international orientation also in their education of students. The dominant discourse on internationalisation of higher education in research and research based discussions have up till now mainly been from a political, an economic and an organisational perspective. There is also a tendency to place internationalisation within the frame of globalisation and the increasing trade in educational services worldwide. We do not dispute that this research is helpful to clarify some main political and economic conditions for and ways of organising higher education. However, the research does not give much basis for internationalising the teaching and learning and development of scholarship. There is <b>an</b> obvious <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>neglecting</b> the meaning <b>of</b> the development of internationalisation in higher education when it comes to teaching and learning intercultural knowledge and competencies, and development of scholarship. There is a need of addressing questions about the internationalising of the content of education. Both at national and institutional levels, in many countries, internationalisation is stated to be an educational goal, sometimes discussed as a linear homogenization process, sometimes emphasizing a pluralistic process, multilingualism and multiculturalism. In some previous studies we have found that the concretisation of internationalisation as an educational goal is very unclear. The concrete content considered to represent internationalisation seems to be rather haphazardly included in the teaching and learning. There is also a tendency to look at what is considered to be general knowledge and general human qualities as what represents internationalisation without considering cultural differences. In higher education there is no institutionalised educational and didactic thinking as a basis for developing internationalisation of the education. The concrete thinking is very much restricted to organisational and administrative aspects of the education. The thinking about educational content and learning outcomes is much idealised and not developed in terms of students’ competencies and capabilities (attitudes and approaches). In this paper we present and discuss the conditions for an educational didactic framework and approach to internationalisation of higher education...|$|R
40|$|Low-income {{countries}} with high HIV/AIDS burdens in sub-Saharan Africa {{must deal with}} severe shortages of qualified human resources for health. This situation has triggered the renewed interest in community health workers, as they may {{play an important role}} in scaling-up antiretroviral treatment for HIV/AIDS by taking over a number of tasks from the professional health workers. Currently, a wide variety of community health workers are active in many antiretroviral treatment delivery sites. This article investigates whether present community health worker programmes for antiretroviral treatment are taking into account the lessons learnt from past experiences with community health worker programmes in primary health care and to what extent they are seizing the new antiretroviral treatment-specific opportunities. Based on a desk review of multi-purpose community health worker programmes for primary health care and of recent experiences with antiretroviral treatment-related community health workers, we developed an analytic framework of 10 criteria: eight conditions for successful large-scale antiretroviral treatment-related community health worker programmes and two antiretroviral treatment-specific opportunities. Our appraisal of six community health worker programmes, which we identified during field work in Ethiopia, Malawi and Uganda in 2007, shows that while some lessons from the past have been learnt, others are not being sufficiently considered and antiretroviral treatment-specific opportunities are not being sufficiently seized. In particular, all programmes have learnt the lesson that without adequate remuneration, community health workers cannot be retained in the long term. Yet we contend that the apparently insufficient attention to issues such as quality supervision and continuous training will lead to decreasing quality of the programmes over time. The life experience of people living with HIV/AIDS is still a relatively neglected asset, even though it may give antiretroviral treatment-related community health worker programmes better chances of success than their predecessors and may be crucially important for adherence and retention in large-scale antiretroviral treatment programmes. Community health workers as a community-based extension of health services are essential for antiretroviral treatment scale-up and comprehensive primary health care. The renewed attention to community health workers is thus very welcome, but the scale-up of community health worker programmes runs <b>a</b> high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>neglecting</b> the necessary quality criteria if it is not aligned with broader health systems strengthening. To achieve universal access to antiretroviral treatment, this is of paramount importance and should receive urgent attention...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was to {{describe}} mild intellectual disability (ID) from various neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric perspectives in children and young adults. Paper I The objective of the first paper was to analyse coexisting neurodevelopmental disorders/problems and diagnostic concerns in a population-based group of 33 school age children with mild ID. The instrument used was the Five-To-Fifteen questionnaire. The prevalence of mild ID {{in the study area}} was found to be 0. 85 %. High rates of problems were reported regarding motor skills, executive function/attention, social and emotional/ behavioural functioning. It was concluded that school age children with mild ID are in need of a comprehensive work-up covering not only general cognitive abilities, but also many other areas. Paper II In the second paper adaptive functioning was compared between the group of 33 school age children with mild ID (Paper I) and a referral group of 27 school age children with ADHD. The instrument, administered to teachers, was the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System, Second Edition (ABAS-II). At total group levels, the group with ADHD had even lower adaptive functioning compared to the group with mild ID. The difference between the groups was significant in children 12 years or older. The finding has implications for diagnostic concerns and indicates that the level of adaptive functioning cannot be used to differentiate between mild ID and ADHD. Paper III and IV In the third and fourth papers a population based group of 42 children – now young adults – born to mothers with ID was explored with regard to life experiences. Three of the 42 individuals (0. 68 %) had died before the age of 8 years, one had moved abroad and seven declined participation. Ten individuals were personally interviewed and 21 were searched for in different registers. When the interview and register groups were collapsed, it was found that 11 of the 31 individuals (35 %) had mild ID and 9 (29 %) had ADHD. Sixteen children (52 %) had not been primarily raised by their biological mother. Children born to mothers with ID are exposed to several <b>risks.</b> These include <b>an</b> increased <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>neglect</b> and abuse in the family and also <b>an</b> increased <b>risk</b> for the child to have mild ID and other neurodevelopmental disorders, including ADHD. Individuals with ID who become parents need tailored support from social services and their children need early assessment so as to develop physically, mentally and socially in an optimal way...|$|R
40|$|La simpleza de los rankings mundiales de la felicidad ha facilitado su acogida en los debates sobre políticas públicas, que están ávidos por incorporar nuevas medidas del bienestar de las sociedades. Lamentablemente, éstos han sido interpretados de forma poco cuidadosa, tratando las diferencias entre países como si tuvieran una certeza que en la práctica no tienen. En la presente Clave de Política Pública mostramos que es posible reconocer la incertidumbre de estos rankings utilizando intervalos de confianza para los promedios nacionales de felicidad y definiendo puntos de referencia, sin por ello sacrificar la simpleza que hace tan atractivos a los rankings mundiales de felicidad. Al tomar en cuenta sólo las diferencias estadísticamente significativas respecto a Chile, observamos que las conclusiones obtenidas no exageran las diferencias entre países. Global {{happiness}} rankings have flourished {{during the}} past decade, getting increased attention in public policy debates throughout the world. Policymakers and academics are demanding new measures of societal well-being that go beyond income. International {{organizations such as the}} UN and OECD are supporting the development of multidimensional measures of well-being, includinghappiness indicators together with moretraditional indicators such as GDP per capita. The media have been very receptive of the newly developed happiness indicators and published numerous colorful maps that illustrate national levels of happiness across the world. Unfortunately, these rankings and maps have been repeatedly misinterpreted in public policy debates, treating differences between countries as if they were estimated without uncertainty. Ignoring the uncertainty underlying happiness rankings inevitably leads us to exaggerate differences between countries. That is, countries ranked in different positions in a happiness ranking may be treated as if they were statistically different from each other when they are not. Therefore, we argue that happiness rankings –whether presented in maps, figures, or tables– should always accountfor uncertainty by including confidence intervals and a reference point to assess statistical differences across countries. Using the World Values Survey cross-national data on life satisfaction for 91 countries,we illustrate how to build happiness ranking that correctly account for uncertainty. We take Chile as a reference point to make comparisons, and repaint the world map of happiness by classifying countries as statistically happier, unhappier or not different from Chile. The results suggest that when looking for lessons to become a happier society, Chile should mainly look to its Latin American neighbors, rather than to many higher income countries around the world that rank above Chile in the happiness ranking. Overall, these results suggest <b>a</b> serious <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>neglecting</b> uncertainty when using happiness ranking to inform public policy debates. ...|$|R

40|$|Patricia and David Zummo {{were married}} on December 17, 1978. When they {{divorced}} ten years later, the Zummos {{were unable to}} come to agreement about the religious upbringing of their three children. Prior to their marriage, Patricia and David had agreed that they would raise {{their children in the}} Jewish faith, and while they were married, 2 ̆ 2 the Zummo family participated fully {{in the life of the}} Jewish faith and community. 2 ̆ 2 But after the divorce David wanted to take the children to Roman Catholic services as he saw fit, and he refused to arrange for the children 2 ̆ 7 s attendance at Hebrew School during his visitation periods. Patricia Zummo, on the other hand, opposed exposing the children to a second religion. She was concerned that such a mixed spiritual message 2 ̆ 2 would confuse and disorient them. 2 ̆ 2 The Zummos brought their custody dispute to the Court of Common Pleas for Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. The facts of the Zummo case are distressingly typical of the spiritual custody dispute. With high rates of interfaith marriage and divorce, the subject of spiritual custody is certain to be one of continuing concern. To date, courts have treaded with great care on the uncertain constitutional landscape that underlies the competing claims of divorced parents who seek to control the religious education of their children. Of course, the best interests of the child are of central concern in custody cases. In spiritual custody cases, however, the First Amendment rights of the parents significantly complicate the judicial inquiry. Most courts 2 ̆ 2 have refused to restrain the noncustodial parent from exposing a minor child to his or her religious beliefs or practices absent a clear, affirmative showing that these religious activities will be harmful to the child. 2 ̆ 2 Nonetheless, it is argued that even this high degree of deference to parental authority is too open to judicial discretion. Critics of the 2 ̆ 2 best interests 2 ̆ 2 standard point to the 2 ̆ 2 constitutional hazards 2 ̆ 2 of such meddling in religious affairs [...] violations of either or both of the religion clauses of the First Amendment [...] and call for a direct prohibition of such consideration or some stricter version of strict scrutiny. I do not think ignoring these religious disputes is practically desirable. Growing up in the midst of a domestic religious civil war, given the special volatility of such disputes, is never in the best interests of the child. To leave this kind of conflict to the good intentions of feuding parents is to abandon the child to a 2 ̆ 2 Hobbesian space in which there is no law. 2 ̆ 2 The reluctance of courts to intervene in spiritual custody cases is reminiscent of an earlier era in family law where 2 ̆ 2 the state would not make its courts available for resolving disputes between husband and wife. 2 ̆ 2 The notion of family autonomy made women and children particularly vulnerable to 2 ̆ 2 unrestrained authority. 2 ̆ 2 Beyond protection against serious harm, children were subject to public neglect 2 ̆ 2 justified by the theory that only parents are responsible for them. 2 ̆ 2 Judicial deference in spiritual custody cases presents <b>a</b> similar <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>neglect,</b> similarly masked as a matter of constitutional rights. Deference to family autonomy or parental free exercise rights in such cases may be a choice our society wishes to make, but it is not a choice that is constitutionally required. The right that people have to direct the spiritual upbringing of children, I will argue, is contingent on the commitment to the work of social ordering they have agreed to undertake as parents [...] that is, the right of religious parenting (1) is called into existence by a community of interests centered on the welfare of the child, and (2) may cease to exist when that community devolves into a contest of parental religious preferences...|$|R
