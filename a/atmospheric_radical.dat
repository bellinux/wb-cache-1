As part of SHARP (Study of Houston <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Radical</b> Precursors), time series of HONO were obtained by six different measurement techniques {{on the roof of the}} Moody Tower at the University of Houston. Techniques used were long path differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS), stripping coil-visible absorption photometry (SC-AP), long path absorption photometry (LOPAP®), mist chamber/ion chromatography (MC-IC), quantum cascade-tunable infrared laser differential absorption spectroscopy (QC-TILDAS), and ion drift-chemical ionization mass spectrometry (ID-CIMS). Various combinations of techniques were in operation from 15 April through 31 May 2009. All instruments recorded a similar diurnal pattern of HONO concentrations with higher median and mean values during the night than during the day. Highest values were observed in the final 2 weeks of the campaign. Inlets for the MC-IC, SC-AP, and QC-TILDAS were collocated and agreed most closely with each other based on several measures. Largest differences between pairs of measurements were evident during the day for concentrations ~ 100 parts per trillion (ppt). Above ~ 200 ppt, concentrations from the SC-AP, MC-IC, and QC-TILDAS converged to within about 20 %, with slightly larger discrepancies when DOAS was considered. During the first 2 weeks, HONO measured by ID-CIMS agreed with these techniques, but ID-CIMS reported higher values during the afternoon and evening of the final 4 weeks, possibly from interference from unknown sources.

40|$|Ozone in the {{troposphere}} is {{an essential}} constituent that helps determine the atmosphere 2 ̆ 7 s oxidizing power, {{but it is also}} a contaminant responsible for part of global warming, crop damage and causes respiratory problems. The ozone concentration has steadily increased over the last century, reaching levels where plant damage occurs. ^ It is known that VOCs (volatile organic compounds) and NOx (NO and NO 2) from industrial as well as biogenic sources make control of regional tropospheric ozone difficult. For this reason, it is important to understand the mechanism for VOC oxidation, and the relationship between molecular structure and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>radical</b> chemistry. Tropospheric ozone is formed from the OH oxidation of VOCs in the presence of NO. Organic nitrates are also formed through this process. Formation of organic nitrates is a termination step, which competes with ozone formation. Organic nitrate formation from OH oxidation of n-alkenes and n-alkenes has been studied. Other VOCs, such as oxygenated or halogenated compounds could be a significant source of organic nitrates, but they have not been studied. ^ The organic nitrate formation yield from OH oxidation of halocarbons and oxygenated VOCs was studied in a photochemical reaction chamber. These formation yields were compared to those from n-alkanes in order to understand the effect of the functional groups on the organic nitrate yield.

40|$|Gas-phase rate {{coefficients}} {{are fundamental}} to understanding atmospheric chemistry, yet experimental {{data are not}} available for the oxidation reactions {{of many of the}} thousands of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) observed in the troposphere. Here a new experimental method is reported for the simultaneous study of reactions between multiple different VOCs and OH, the most important daytime <b>atmospheric</b> <b>radical</b> oxidant. This technique is based upon established relative rate concepts but has the advantage of a much higher throughput of target VOCs. By evaluating multiple VOCs in each experiment, and through measurement of the depletion in each VOC after reaction with OH, the OH + VOC reaction rate coefficients can be derived. Results from experiments conducted under controlled laboratory conditions were in good agreement with the available literature for the reaction of nineteen VOCs, prepared in synthetic gas mixtures, with OH. This approach was used to determine a rate coefficient for the reaction of OH with 2, 3 -dimethylpent- 1 -ene for the first time; k  =  5. 7 (± 0. 3) × 10 – 11 –cm 3  molecule − 1  s − 1. In addition, a further seven VOCs had only two, or fewer, individual OH rate coefficient measurements available in the literature. The results from this work were in good agreement with those measurements. A similar dataset, at an elevated temperature of 323 (± 10) K, was used to determine new OH rate coefficients for twelve aromatic, five alkane, five alkene and three monoterpene VOC + OH reactions. In OH relative reactivity experiments that used ambient air at the University of York, a large number of different VOCs were observed, of which 23 were positively identified. 19 OH rate coefficients were derived from these ambient air samples, including ten reactions for which data was previously unavailable at the elevated reaction temperature of T  =  323 (± 10) K...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} claimed {{for more than}} a century that {{atmospheric}} new particle formation is primarily influenced by the presence of sulfuric acid. However, the activation process of sulfuric acid related clusters into detectable particles is still an unresolved topic. In this study we focus on the PARADE campaign measurements conducted during August/September 2011 at Mt Kleiner Feldberg in central Germany. During this campaign a set of radicals, organic and inorganic compounds and oxidants and aerosol properties were measured or calculated. We compared a range of organic and inorganic nucleation theories, evaluating their ability to simulate measured particle formation rates at 3 nm in diameter (J 3) for a variety of different conditions. Nucleation mechanisms involving only sulfuric acid tentatively captured the observed noon-time daily maximum in J 3, but displayed an increasing difference to J 3 measurements during the rest of the diurnal cycle. Including large organic radicals, i. e. organic peroxy radicals (RO 2) deriving from monoterpenes and their oxidation products, in the nucleation mechanism improved the correlation between observed and simulated J 3. This supports a recently proposed empirical relationship for new particle formation that has been used in global models. However, the best match between theory and measurements for the site of interest was found for an activation process based on large organic peroxy radicals and stabilised Criegee intermediates (sCI). This novel laboratory-derived algorithm simulated the daily pattern and intensity of J 3 observed in the ambient data. In this algorithm organic derived radicals are involved in activation and growth and link the formation rate of smallest aerosol particles with OH during daytime and NO 3 during night-time. Because the RO 2 lifetime is controlled by HO 2 and NO we conclude that peroxy radicals and NO seem to play an important role for ambient radical chemistry not only with respect to oxidation capacity but also for the activation process of new particle formation. This is supposed to have significant impact of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>radical</b> species on aerosol chemistry and should be taken into account when studying the impact of new particles in climate feedback cycles...|$|E
40|$|Nitrous acid (HONO) {{acts as a}} major {{precursor}} of the hydroxyl radical (OH) in the urban atmospheric boundary layer {{in the morning and}} throughout the day. Despite its importance, HONO formation mechanisms are not yet completely understood. It is generally accepted that conversion of NO 2 on surfaces in the presence of water is responsible for the formation of HONO in the nocturnal boundary layer, although the type of surface on which the mechanism occurs is still under debate. Recent observations of higher than expected daytime HONO concentrations in both urban and rural areas indicate the presence of unknown daytime HONO source(s). Various formation pathways in the gas phase, and on aerosol and ground surfaces have been proposed to explain the presence of daytime HONO. However, it is unclear which mechanism dominates and, in the cases of heterogeneous mechanisms, on which surfaces they occur. Vertical concentration profiles of HONO and its precursors can help in identifying the dominant HONO formation pathways. In this study, daytime HONO and NO 2 vertical profiles, measured in three different height intervals (20 – 70, 70 – 130, and 130 – 300 m) in Houston, TX, during the 2009 Study of Houston <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Radical</b> Precursors (SHARP) are analyzed using a one-dimensional (1 -D) chemistry and transport model. Model results with various HONO formation pathways suggested in the literature are compared to the the daytime HONO and HONO/NO 2 ratios observed during SHARP. The best agreement of HONO and HONO/NO 2 ratios between model and observations is achieved by including both a photolytic source of HONO at the ground and on the aerosol. Model sensitivity studies show that the observed diurnal variations of the HONO/NO 2 ratio are not reproduced by the model if there is only a photolytic HONO source on aerosol or in the gas phase from NO 2 * + H 2 O. Further analysis of the formation and loss pathways of HONO shows a vertical dependence of HONO chemistry during the day. Photolytic HONO formation at the ground is the major formation pathway in the lowest 20 m, while a combination of gas-phase, photolytic formation on aerosol, and vertical transport is responsible for daytime HONO between 200 – 300 m a. g. l. HONO removal is dominated by vertical transport below 20 m and photolysis between 200 – 300 m a. g. l...|$|E

40|$|A {{new method}} (ROxLIF) for the {{measurement}} of <b>atmospheric</b> peroxy <b>radicals</b> (HO(2) and RO(2)) was developed using a two-step chemical conversion scheme and laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) for radical detection. Ambient air is sampled into a differentially pumped flow reactor, in which <b>atmospheric</b> RO(x) <b>radicals</b> (=RO(2) +RO+HO(2) +OH) are chemically converted to HO(2) by a large excess of NO and CO at reduced pressures (ROx mode). When only CO is added as a reagent, the sum of atmospheric HO(2) +OH is converted to HO(2) (HOx mode). At the reactor outlet, part of the air flow is transferred into a low-pressure detection chamber, where the HO(2) is further converted by reaction with NO to OH, which is then detected with high sensitivity by LIF at 308 nm. The ROxLIF technique has been implemented in an existing LIF instrument that is also capable of measuring atmospheric OH. From the concurrent measurements of RO(x), HO(x) and OH, concentrations of HO(2) and RO(2) can be determined. The system is calibrated using the quantitative photolysis of water vapor at 185 nm as a radical source. Addition of CO or hydrocarbons to the calibration gas yields well-defined concentrations of HO(2) or RO(2), respectively, providing an estimated accuracy for the calibration of about 20 %. The ROxLIF technique is extremely sensitive and has detection limits (signal-to-noise ratio= 2) of about 0. 1 pptv of HO(2) or RO(2) at a time resolution of 1 min.

Thus, they served as useful mechanistic probes: they respond differently {{to the presence of}} humidity in the air and give different products. By FT-IR analysis of the postdischarge gas the following products were detected and quantified: CO 2 and CO in the case of CH 2 Br 2, CO 2 and F 2 C=O in the case of CF 2 Br 2 center dot F 2 C=O is a long-lived oxidation intermediate due to its low reactivity with <b>atmospheric</b> <b>radicals.</b> It is however removed from the NTP processed gas by passage through a water scrubber resulting in hydrolysis to CO 2 and HF.

It is concluded that, regardless of the type of corona applied, CF 2 Br 2 reacts in air NTP via a common intermediate, the CF 2 Br radical.

Gas phase chemistry in interstellar clouds can synthesize the molecular building blocks of our universe. Studying gas phase chemistry has also led to basic chemical knowledge of how chemical reactions proceed and how intermolecular forces work. This work is dedicated to studying gas phase chemical reactions with high-sensitivity laser spectroscopy. Laser spectroscopy can be a sensitive and selective way to detect gas phase species. Since laser pulses can both create reactants and detect the products, laser techniques allow the study of chemical kinetics in real time. Consequently, many different laser techniques {{have been developed to}} study gas phase chemistry. 6, 7 This thesis is divided into two sections: a longer first section on my work at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, CA and a smaller second section based on my work at the Université de Rennes 1 in Rennes, France. These two sections, while on different topics – atmospheric chemical reactions and collisional rotational energy transfer at ultra-low temperatures – are united by their study of gas phase with laser spectroscopy, which shows the breadth of this experimental approach. This thesis will both look at kinetics (the rate of chemical reactions) and product yield of chemical reactions, both key pieces of information to modeling gas phase reactions. The first part of this work outlines my work at the California Institute of Technology, studying <b>atmospheric</b> <b>radical</b> chemistry with cavity-ringdown spectroscopy (CRDS). Chapter 1 put this work in a broader picture of current scientific work on Earth’s atmosphere. Chapter 2 provides a detailed description of our cavity-ringdown spectrometer and temperature-controlled flow cell. Next, I discuss work on three important atmospheric reactions: the isomerization of simple alkoxy radicals (Chapter 3), the reaction of HO 2 with NO (Chapter 4), and the reaction of OH with NO 2 (Chapter 5). The second, and smaller, part of this work, contains one chapter – chapter 6 – on work done at the Université de Rennes 1, which describes work on the rotational energy transfer in collisions between CO and Ar at temperatures from 293 to 30 K with infrared-vacuum ultraviolet double resonance CRESU experiments. </p...|$|E
40|$|Atmospheric organics {{originate}} from biogenic and anthropogenic sources including {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) and oxidation products of these VOCs. In the atmosphere, the organics can be processed and become important components of atmospheric aerosols. Methylglyoxal (CH 3 COCHO) is a known oxidation product of VOCs and has been observed in field studies and incorporated into atmospheric models. While the gas-phase chemistry of methylglyoxal is fairly well understood, its modeled concentration and role {{in the formation of}} secondary organic aerosols (SOA) remains controversial. In this thesis, I investigate aqueous chemistry of methylglyoxal to better understand the link between VOCs and the formation of SOA. The gas-phase hydration is a process not previously considered to occur in water-restricted environments, such as the atmosphere, but could have important consequences for the atmospheric processing of organics. Methylglyoxal is an interesting molecule for studying gas-phase hydration of because it contains both a ketone and an aldehyde group. This allows for the simultaneous analysis of the effect of gas-phase hydration on both carbonyl groups. I examine the gas-phase hydration of methylglyoxal leading to diol and hydrates (water clusters), and examine their water and photon mediated chemistry. The gas-phase hydration of methylglyoxal has important consequences to its atmospheric processing. Methylglyoxal diol and its hydrates have a lower vapor pressure than the parent aldehyde and a tendency to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The ability to more readily form hydrogen bonds can increase the diol and diol hydrate contributions to aerosol growth by partitioning more readily into the aqueous phase. This would increase methylglyoxal content in aerosols and affect the organic content of aqueous-phase aerosols and cloud droplets. Additionally, hydration of methylglyoxal to form the diol can alter the electronic state of the parent aldehyde. Formation of methylglyoxal diol will eliminate the n→π* transition of the aldehyde carbonyl, which undergoes near-ultraviolet (UV) photochemistry. This allows for methylglyoxal diol to form new products via UV photochemistry through its remaining ketone carbonyl and opens the way for other photochemistry through excitation of the OH vibrational overtone in the near-infrared (IR). To examine the hydration of methylglyoxal and the formation of methylglyoxal diol I employed a variety of spectroscopic techniques including, Fourier transform IR spectroscopy (FTIR), cavity ringdown spectroscopy (CRDS), incoherent broad band cavity enhanced absorption spectroscopy (IBBCEAS), UV-visible spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The FTIR and CRD are used to observe and characterize the formation of methylglyoxal diol and its hydrates. The IBBCEAS was used to investigate the changes in the UV absorption cross section of methylglyoxal with increasing relative humidity. UV-visible and NMR spectroscopy was used to analyze the aqueous-phase hydration of methylglyoxal and its photolysis products. These results may impact the understanding of the atmospheric fate and processing of methylglyoxal and the role of organics in atmospheric chemistry. Hydration of aldehydes such as methylglyoxal has implications for modification of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>radical</b> production and provides important degradation pathways of potential SOA precursors...|$|E
40|$|Nitrous Acid (HONO) {{plays an}} {{important}} role in tropospheric chemistry as a precursor of the hydroxyl radical (OH), the most important oxidizing agent in the atmosphere. Nevertheless, the formation mechanisms of HONO are still not completely understood. Recent field observations found unexpectedly high daytime HONO concentrations in both urban and rural areas, which point to unrecognized, most likely photolytically enhanced HONO sources. Several gas-phase, aerosol, and ground surface chemistry mechanisms have been proposed to explain elevated daytime HONO, but atmospheric evidence to favor one over the others is still weak. New information on whether HONO formation occurs in the gas-phase, on aerosol, or at the ground may be derived from observations of the vertical distribution of HONO and its precursor nitrogen dioxide, NO 2 , as well as from its dependence on solar irradiance or actinic flux. Here we present field observations of HONO, NO 2 and other trace gases in three altitude intervals (30 – 70 m, 70 – 130 m and 130 – 300 m) using UCLA's long path DOAS instrument, as well as in situ measurements of OH, NO, photolysis frequencies and solar irradiance, made in Houston, TX, during the Study of Houston <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Radical</b> Precursor (SHARP) experiment from 20 April to 30 May 2009. The observed HONO mixing ratios were often ten times larger than the expected photostationary state with OH and NO. Larger HONO mixing ratios observed near the ground than aloft imply, but do not clearly prove, that the daytime source of HONO was located at or near the ground. Using a pseudo steady-state (PSS) approach, we calculated the missing daytime HONO formation rates, Punknown, on four sunny days. The NO 2 -normalized Punknown, Pnorm, showed a clear symmetrical diurnal variation with a maximum around noontime, which was well correlated with actinic flux (NO 2 photolysis frequency) and solar irradiance. This behavior, which was found on all clear days in Houston, is a strong indication of a photolytic HONO source. [HONO]/[NO 2 ] ratios also showed a clear diurnal profile, with maxima of 2 – 3 % around noon. PSS calculations show that this behavior cannot be explained by the proposed gas-phase reaction of photoexcited NO 2 (NO 2 *) or any other gas-phase or aerosol photolytic process occurring at similar or longer wavelengths than that of HONO photolysis. HONO formation by aerosol nitrate photolysis in the UV also seems to be unlikely. Pnorm correlated better with solar irradiance (average R 2 = 0. 85 / 0. 87 for visible/UV) than with actinic flux (R 2 = 0. 76) on the four sunny days, clearly pointing to HONO being formed at the ground rather than on the aerosol or in the gas-phase. In addition, the observed [HONO]/[NO 2 ] diurnal variation can be explained if the formation of HONO depends on solar irradiance, but not if it depends on the actinic flux. The vertical mixing ratio profiles, together with the stronger correlation with solar irradiance, support the idea that photolytically enhanced NO 2 to HONO conversion on the ground was the dominant source of HONO in Houston...|$|E
40|$|Cloud {{droplets}} in {{the atmosphere}} have an organic component which {{has been shown to}} form a monolayer film at the air-water interface of the cloud droplet and the atmosphere. The process by which a cloud droplet film will oxidise and the persistence or loss of an oxidised organic film from the air-liquid interface of a cloud droplet is not well quantified. To determine the surface properties of a cloud droplet film during atmospheric oxidation a measurement of a kinetic variable, the concentration of material comprising an organic film, during reaction with <b>atmospheric</b> <b>radicals</b> was required. The coupling of a Langmuir trough with a neutron reflectometer allows the measurement of the surface coverage of a monolayer in unison with measurement of the monolayer surface pressure. The technique of coupling a Langmuir trough with neutron reflectometry is used extensively for research into the properties of surfactants for industrial and medicinal use. This thesis builds on the work of King et al., (2009) and King et al., (2010), whom produced the first neutron reflectivity measurements of atmospheric proxy monolayers reacting with ozone. This is the first thesis detailing the neutron reflectometry measurement from an atmospheric perspective. Measurements were taken of representative fatty acid molecules which have atmospheric relevance (stearic acid, oleic acid and methyl oleate) as well as measurements of phospholipid molecules which are potential parent species for the fatty acids found in atmospheric waters (I, 2 -dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine). The mono layers were reacted with aqueous phase OH radical and with gas-phase ozone to assess the kinetics of the oxidation of the monolayers at the air-water interface.

40|$|Abstract. We {{suggest a}} {{chemical}} {{model for the}} composition, structure, and atmospheric processing of organic aerosols. This model is stimulated by recent field measurements showing that organic compounds are a significant component of atmospheric aerosols. The proposed model organic aerosol is an “inverted micelle ” consisting of an aqueous core that is encapsulated in an inert, hydrophobic organic monolayer. The organic materials that coat the aerosol particles are surfactants of biological origin. We propose a chemical mechanism by which the organic surface layer will be processed by reactions with <b>atmospheric</b> <b>radicals.</b> The net result of an organic aerosol being exposed to an oxidizing atmosphere is the transformation of an inert hydrophobic film to a reactive, optically active hydrophilic layer. Consequently, processed organic aerosols can grow by water accretion and form cloud condensation nuclei, influencing atmospheric radiative transfer. Radiative transfer may be affected directly by the chromophores left {{on the surface of}} the aerosol after chemical transformation. The chemical model yields certain predictions which are testable by observations. Among them is a curve of the percent organic material as a function of particle diameter which predicts that a high fraction of the mass of the upper tropospheric aerosol will be organic. Atmospheric processing of organic aerosols will lead to the release of small organic fragments into the troposphere which will play a subsequent role in homogeneous chemistry. Organic aerosols are likely to act as a transport vehicle of organics and other water insoluble compounds into the atmosphere. We speculate that biomass burning will produce a similar coating of surfactants derived from land sources. Finally, it is pointed out that the radical-induced transformation of the surface layer of aerosol particles from hydrophobic to hydrophilic offers an additional means by which the biosphere, through atmospheric chemistry, can affect the radiative balance. 1...|$|R
40|$|Aliphatic amines {{can form}} {{secondary}} aerosol via oxidation with <b>atmospheric</b> <b>radicals</b> (e. g., hydroxyl radical and nitrate radical). The particle can contain both secondary organic aerosol (SOA) and inorganic salts. The ratio of organic to inorganic {{materials in the}} particulate phase influences aerosol hygroscopicity and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activity. SOA formed from trimethylamine (TMA) and butylamine (BA) reactions with hydroxyl radical (OH) is composed of organic material of low hygroscopicity (single hygroscopicity parameter, κ, ≤ 0. 25). Secondary aerosol formed from the tertiary aliphatic amine (TMA) with N 2 O 5 (source of nitrate radical, NO 3) contains less volatile compounds than the primary aliphatic amine (BA) aerosol. As relative humidity (RH) increases, inorganic amine salts are formed {{as a result of}} acid–base reactions. The CCN activity of the humid TMA–N 2 O 5 aerosol obeys Zdanovskii, Stokes, and Robinson (ZSR) ideal mixing rules. The humid BA + N 2 O 5 aerosol products were found to be very sensitive to the temperature at which the measurements were made within the streamwise continuous-flow thermal gradient CCN counter; κ ranges from 0. 4 to 0. 7 dependent on the instrument supersaturation (ss) settings. The variance of the measured aerosol κ values indicates that simple ZSR rules cannot be applied to the CCN results from the primary aliphatic amine system. Overall, aliphatic amine aerosol systems' κ ranges within 0. 2 < κ < 0. 7. This work indicates that aerosols formed via nighttime reactions with amines are likely to produce hygroscopic and volatile aerosol, whereas photochemical reactions with OH produce secondary organic aerosol of lower CCN activity. The contributions of semivolatile secondary organic and inorganic material from aliphatic amines must be considered for accurate hygroscopicity and CCN predictions from aliphatic amine systems...|$|R
