5|$|As aforementioned, {{while its}} exact origins are unknown, gumbo is often {{believed}} to be a dish created by slaves, made from slave owners’ unwanted food materials, such as animal innards or fatty cuts.

5|$|Cercaria mirabilis, a trematode, has an {{especially}} large larval stage (known as a cercarium) which looks {{much like a}} small crustacean or mosquito larva. It also mimics the locomotory behavior of such animals, <b>allowing</b> <b>it</b> to be eaten by predaceous fish.|$|E
5|$|For instance, pure diamond is an {{electrical}} insulator, but diamond with boron added is {{an electrical}} conductor (and, in some cases, a superconductor), <b>allowing</b> <b>it</b> {{to be used}} in electronic applications. Nitrogen impurities hinder movement of lattice dislocations (defects within the crystal structure) and put the lattice under compressive stress, thereby increasing hardness and toughness.|$|E
5|$|In the UK, a toffee apple is a {{traditional}} confection made by coating an apple in hot toffee and <b>allowing</b> <b>it</b> to cool. Similar treats in the U.S. are candy apples (coated in a hard shell of crystallized sugar syrup), and caramel apples, coated with cooled caramel.|$|E

5|$|In Japan, Waseda University {{initiated}} the WABOT project in 1967, and in 1972 completed the WABOT-1, the world's first full-scale intelligent humanoid robot, or android. Its limb control system <b>allowed</b> <b>it</b> {{to walk with}} the lower limbs, and to grip and transport objects with hands, using tactile sensors. <b>Its</b> vision system <b>allowed</b> <b>it</b> to measure distances and directions to objects using external receptors, artificial eyes and ears.

5|$|The olive sea snake, Aipysurus laevis, {{has been}} found to have photoreceptors in the skin of its tail, <b>allowing</b> <b>it</b> to detect light and presumably {{ensuring}} it is completely hidden, including its tail, inside coral holes during the day. While other species have not been tested, Aipysurus laevis possibly is not unique among sea snakes in this respect.|$|E

5|$|The soft fins, skin, and {{musculature}} of {{the false}} catshark suggest a sluggish lifestyle. An enormous oil-filled liver makes up 18–25% of its total weight, <b>allowing</b> <b>it</b> to maintain near-neutral buoyancy and hover off the bottom with little effort. This species likely captures prey via quick bursts of speed, with its large mouth <b>allowing</b> <b>it</b> to consume food of considerable size. It feeds mainly on bony fishes such as cutthroat eels, grenadiers, and snake mackerel, and also takes lanternsharks, squids, octopodes, and Heterocarpus shrimp. It likely also scavenges, as examination of stomach contents have found surface-dwelling fishes such as frigate mackerel, needlefishes, and pufferfishes. One specimen caught off the Canary Islands had swallowed human garbage, including potatoes, a pear, a plastic bag, and a soft drink can. There is a record of a false catshark found with bite marks from a great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias).|$|E

5|$|A 1920s {{adaptation}} {{created by}} the Stempel Type Foundry and released for hot metal typesetting by Linotype, that has remained popular. It is sharp, somewhat angular design with a crisp hook rather than a teardrop at top left of the 'a'. Stempel Garamond has relatively short descenders, <b>allowing</b> <b>it</b> to be particularly tightly linespaced. An unusual feature is the digit 0, which has reversed contrast, with the thickest points of {{the number on the}} top and bottom of the digit to make it more distinguishable from a 'o'. The Klingspor Museum credits it to Stempel's head of typeface development Dr. Rudolf Wolf.|$|E
5|$|A {{motion in}} the House to extend Canada's mission in Afghanistan by two years was successful. The motion was {{supported}} by the Conservatives and 30 Liberal MPs, <b>allowing</b> <b>it</b> to narrowly pass 149–145 on May 17, 2006. Even outside of government bills, the Prime Minister's support of Canada's action has been a recurring topic, gaining him both supporters and critics among the Canadian population. On March 13, 2008, the mission was further extended until July 2011 by a vote of 197–77, with Conservative and Liberal MPs in favour, and Bloc and NDP MPs opposed.|$|E

5|$|A {{reflective}} layer behind the tiger shark's retina, called the tapetum lucidum, allows light-sensing cells {{a second chance}} to capture photons of visible light, enhancing vision in low-light conditions. A tiger shark generally has long fins to provide lift as the shark maneuvers through water, while the long upper tail provides bursts of speed. The tiger shark normally swims using small body movements. Its high back and dorsal fin act as a pivot, <b>allowing</b> <b>it</b> to spin quickly on its axis, though the shark's dorsal fins are distinctively close to its tail.|$|E
5|$|After a {{long period}} of {{remaining}} empty, the castle slowly began to decay, until in 1812, when Simon Temple, a local businessman, leased the castle from the Strathmores and made it habitable. He re-roofed the chapel (<b>allowing</b> <b>it</b> to be used for public worship again), added battlements to the wings and cultivated the gardens. However, his failed business ventures prevented him from completing his work, and in 1819 the castle was lived in by a Mr. Thomas Wade.|$|E
