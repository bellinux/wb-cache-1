5|$|Gibraltar {{was a very}} tempting {{target for}} the Italians, who saw it as <b>a</b> <b>refuge</b> <b>for</b> British {{warships}} and allied merchant shipping. The Italian frogmen originally used a Spanish villa (Villa Carmela) located two miles (3km) from Gibraltar owned by an Italian officer who had married a Spanish woman named Conchita Ramognino. Their base was shifted later to the Italian tanker SS Olterra, interned in Algeciras.|$|E
5|$|In October 1933 Einstein {{returned}} to the U.S. and took up a position at the Institute for Advanced Study, noted for having become <b>a</b> <b>refuge</b> <b>for</b> scientists fleeing Nazi Germany. At the time, most American universities, including Harvard, Princeton and Yale, had minimal or no Jewish faculty or students, {{as a result of}} their Jewish quota which lasted until the late 1940s.|$|E
5|$|Maryland {{became a}} prime tobacco {{exporting}} colony in the mid-Atlantic and, for a time, <b>a</b> <b>refuge</b> <b>for</b> Catholic settlers, as George Calvert had hoped. Under {{the rule of}} the Lords Baltimore, thousands of British Catholics emigrated to Maryland, establishing some of the oldest Catholic communities in what later became the United States. Catholic rule in Maryland was eventually nullified by the re-assertion of royal control over the colony.|$|E

5|$|The {{area that}} is now Providence was first settled in June 1636 by Roger Williams {{and was one of}} the {{original}} Thirteen Colonies of the United States. Williams and his company felt compelled to withdraw from Massachusetts Bay Colony. Providence quickly became <b>a</b> <b>refuge</b> <b>for</b> persecuted religious dissenters, as Williams himself had been exiled from Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|The {{second son}} of Irish Catholic parents, Carroll was educated in France {{as a lawyer}} before {{returning}} to England, where he pursued the first steps in a legal career. Before that career developed, he secured a position as Attorney General of the young colony of Maryland. Its founder George Calvert and his descendants intended it as <b>a</b> <b>refuge</b> <b>for</b> Catholics.|$|E
5|$|Bristol sent three {{ships to}} the Royal Navy fleet against the Spanish Armada in 1588, and also {{supplied}} two levies {{of men to}} the defending land forces. Despite appeals to the Privy Council no reimbursement was made for these supplies. The corporation also had to repair the walls and gates of the city. The castle had fallen into disuse in the late Tudor era, but the City authorities {{had no control over}} royal property and the precincts became <b>a</b> <b>refuge</b> <b>for</b> lawbreakers.|$|E

5|$|Later in the century, {{a series}} of civil wars known as the Wars of the Roses broke out between the rival factions of the House of Lancaster and York. After the Battle of Northampton in 1460, Harlech formed <b>a</b> <b>refuge</b> <b>for</b> Queen Margaret of Anjou, and between 1461–68 it was held by her Lancastrian supporters, {{under the command of}} Dafydd ap Ieuan, against the Yorkist Edward IV. Thanks to its natural defences and the supply route by sea, Harlech held out and {{eventually}} became the last major stronghold still under Lancasterian control. It finally fell after a month's siege, the events credited with inspiring the song Men of Harlech.|$|E
5|$|Nasser {{played a}} {{significant}} part in the strengthening of African solidarity in the late 1950s and early 1960s, although his continental leadership role had increasingly passed to Algeria since 1962. During this period, Nasser made Egypt <b>a</b> <b>refuge</b> <b>for</b> anti-colonial leaders from several African countries and allowed the broadcast of anti-colonial propaganda from Cairo. Beginning in 1958, Nasser had {{a key role in}} the discussions among African leaders that led to the establishment of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) in 1963.|$|E
5|$|The {{closure of}} the border region for nearly 40years created a haven for {{wildlife}} in some places. Although parts of the East German {{side of the border}} were farmed, intensive farming of the kind practised elsewhere in Germany was absent and large areas were untouched by agriculture. Conservationists became aware as early as the 1970s that the border had become <b>a</b> <b>refuge</b> <b>for</b> rare species of animals and plants. Their findings led the Bavarian government to begin a programme of buying land along the border to ensure its protection from development.|$|E

5|$|The yamen {{building}} {{is made up}} of three halls. Originally the middle hall served the Assistant Magistrate of Kowloon's administrative office, and the rear block was his residence. After the government officials left the area in 1899, it was used for several other purposes, including an old people's home, <b>a</b> <b>refuge</b> <b>for</b> widows and orphans, a school, and a clinic. It was restored in 1996 and is now found near the centre of the park. It contains a photo gallery of the Walled City, and two cannon dating back to 1802 sit at the sides of its entrance.|$|E
5|$|A land {{of green}} fields for crop {{cultivation}} and cattle rearing limits the space {{available for the}} establishment of native wild species. Hedgerows, however, traditionally used for maintaining and demarcating land boundaries, act as <b>a</b> <b>refuge</b> <b>for</b> native wild flora. This ecosystem stretches across the countryside and acts as a network of connections to preserve remnants of the ecosystem that once covered the island. Subsidies under the Common Agricultural Policy, which supported agricultural practices that preserved hedgerow environments, are undergoing reforms. The Common Agricultural Policy had in the past subsidised potentially destructive agricultural practices, for example by emphasising production without placing limits on indiscriminate use of fertilisers and pesticides; but reforms have gradually decoupled subsidies from production levels and introduced environmental and other requirements.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} modify wetland habitats, most {{dramatically in}} flat {{areas such as}} the Everglades, by constructing small ponds known as alligator holes. This behavior has qualified the American alligator to be considered a keystone species. Alligator holes retain water during the dry season and provide <b>a</b> <b>refuge</b> <b>for</b> aquatic organisms. Aquatic organisms that survive the dry season by seeking refuge in alligator holes are a source of future populations. The construction of nests along the periphery of alligator holes, as well as a buildup of soils during the excavation process, provide drier areas for other reptiles to nest and a place for plants that are intolerant of inundation to colonize. Alligator holes are an oasis during the Everglades dry season, so are consequently important foraging sites for other organisms. In the limestone depressions of cypress swamps, alligator holes tend to be large and deep, while those in marl prairies and rocky glades are usually small and shallow, and those in peat depressions of ridge and slough wetlands are more variable.|$|E

5|$|Calvert took an {{interest}} in the British colonisation of the Americas, at first for commercial reasons and later to create <b>a</b> <b>refuge</b> <b>for</b> persecuted English Catholics. He became the proprietor of Avalon, the first sustained English settlement on the southeastern peninsula on the island of Newfoundland (off the eastern coast of modern Canada). Discouraged by its cold and sometimes inhospitable climate and the sufferings of the settlers, he looked for a more suitable spot further south and sought a new royal charter to settle the region, which would become the state of Maryland. Calvert died five weeks before the new Charter was sealed, leaving the settlement of the Maryland colony to his son Cecil (1605–1675). His second son Leonard Calvert (1606–1647) was the first colonial governor of the Province of Maryland.|$|E
5|$|In November 1937, Baylis {{died of a}} heart attack. Her three {{companies}} continued under the direction of her appointed successors: Tyrone Guthrie at the Old Vic, in overall charge of both theatres, with de Valois running the ballet, and Carey and two colleagues running the opera. In the Second World War, the government requisitioned Sadler's Wells as <b>a</b> <b>refuge</b> <b>for</b> those made homeless by air-raids. Guthrie decided to keep the opera going as a small touring ensemble of 20 performers. Between 1942 and the war's end in 1945, the company toured continuously, visiting 87 venues. Joan Cross led and managed the company, and also sang leading soprano roles in its productions when needed. The size of the company was increased to 50, and then to 80. By 1945, its members included singers from a new generation such as Peter Pears and Owen Brannigan, and the conductor Reginald Goodall.|$|E
5|$|The 1982 Shaw Brothers film Brothers {{from the}} Walled City {{is set in}} Kowloon Walled City. The 1984 gangster film Long Arm of the Law {{features}} the Walled City as <b>a</b> <b>refuge</b> <b>for</b> gang members before they are gunned down by police. In the 1988 film Bloodsport, starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, the Walled City is the setting for a martial arts tournament. The 1992 non-narrative film Baraka features several highly detailed shots of the Walled City shortly before its demolition. The 1993 film Crime Story starring Jackie Chan was partly filmed in the deserted Walled City, and includes real scenes of building explosions. A walled neighbourhood called the Narrows in the 2005 film Batman Begins {{was inspired by the}} Walled City. The 2006 Hong Kong horror film Re-cycle features a decrepit, nightmarish version of the Walled City, complete with tortured souls from which the protagonist must flee. The 2016 TVB martial arts drama A Fist Within Four Walls takes place in the Triad-ridden Walled City in the early 1960s.|$|E

5|$|The British {{were eager}} {{not to lose}} any useful {{inhabitants}} and promised religious tolerance to the French colonists; ultimately 112 French colonists remained in Mobile. The first permanent Jewish settlers came to Mobile in 1763 {{as a result of}} the new British rule and religious tolerance. Jews had not been allowed to officially reside in colonial French Louisiana due to the Code Noir, a decree passed by France's King Louis XIV in 1685 that forbade the exercise of any religion other than Roman Catholicism, and ordered all Jews out of France's colonies. Most of these colonial-era Jews in Mobile were merchants and traders from Sephardic Jewish communities in Savannah, Georgia and Charleston, South Carolina; they added to the commercial development of Mobile. In 1766 the total population was estimated to be 860, though the town's borders were smaller than during the French colonial period. During the American Revolutionary War, West Florida and Mobile became <b>a</b> <b>refuge</b> <b>for</b> loyalists fleeing the other colonies.|$|E
5|$|The {{red panda}} is endemic to the {{temperate}} {{forests of the}} Himalayas, and ranges from the foothills of western Nepal to China in the east. Its easternmost limit is the Qinling Mountains of the Shaanxi Province in China. Its range includes southern Tibet, Sikkim and Assam in India, Bhutan, the northern mountains of Burma, and in south-western China, in the Hengduan Mountains of Sichuan and the Gongshan Mountains in Yunnan. It may also live in south-west Tibet and northern Arunachal Pradesh, but {{this has not been}} documented. Locations with the highest density of red pandas include an area in the Himalayas that has been proposed as having been <b>a</b> <b>refuge</b> <b>for</b> a variety of endemic species in the Pleistocene. The distribution range of the red panda should be considered disjunct, rather than continuous. A disjunct population inhabits the Meghalaya Plateau of north-eastern India.|$|E
5|$|There {{is little}} {{reliable}} {{data on the}} status of wolves in the Middle East, save for those in Israel and Saudi Arabia, though their numbers appear to be stable, and are likely to remain so. Israel's conservation policies and effective law enforcement maintain a moderately sized wolf population, which radiates into neighbouring countries, while Saudi Arabia has vast tracts of desert, where about 300–600 wolves live undisturbed. The wolf survives throughout most of its historical range in Saudi Arabia, probably {{because of a lack of}} pastoralism and abundant human waste. Turkey may play an important role in maintaining wolves in the region, because of its contiguity with Central Asia. The mountains of Turkey have served as <b>a</b> <b>refuge</b> <b>for</b> the few wolves remaining in Syria. A small wolf population occurs in the Golan Heights, and is well protected by the military activities there. Wolves living in the southern Negev desert are contiguous with populations living in the Egyptian Sinai and Jordan. Throughout the Middle East, the species is only protected in Israel. Elsewhere, it can be hunted year-round by Bedouins.|$|E
