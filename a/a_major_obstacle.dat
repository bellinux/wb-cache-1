5|$|A {{shortage}} of engines was <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>obstacle</b> to mass production {{and development of}} the IK-3, so tests were conducted with more powerful engines, including the Daimler-Benz DB 601, Rolls-Royce Merlin II and Hispano-Suiza 12Y51.

Development of a dual-control two-seat trainer variant of the IK-3 had commenced but pressure on the design team had delayed the completion of the project when the invasion intervened.|$|E

A series of meetings with the Conservatives began shortly after the hung parliament was announced, and continued over the weekend after the election. Negotiations were also held with the Labour Party. The Scottish National Party (SNP) signalled its willingness to join Labour and the Liberal Democrats in government {{as part of a}} rainbow coalition, but it quickly became clear that Gordon Brown's continued presence as Prime Minister was seen as <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>obstacle</b> to formulating a Labour–Liberal Democrat deal.|$|E
5|$|Ruthie is a snake charmer and barker for the strongman acts {{of her son}} Gabriel. Their arc in {{the story}} reveals Ruthie as a former lover of the mysterious Henry Scudder. Gabriel, a big and {{powerful}} person but with a low IQ, is the first carny to experience Ben's healing powers. Shortly after Ruthie and Ben grow close, Ruthie dies from a snake bite. Ben first tries unsuccessfully to resurrect Ruthie, but succeeds later when he strangles Lodz, the carnival's blind mentalist. In season 2, Ruthie starts to encounter people who have died a long time ago. Being possessed by Lodz at night, Ruthie repeatedly approaches Lila, leading to Lila turning into <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>obstacle</b> for the carnival's success.|$|E

5|$|Prison officials, {{fed up with}} Stroud's {{activities}} and their attendant publicity, intensified their efforts to transfer him out of Leavenworth. Stroud, however, discovered a Kansas law that forbade the transfer of prisoners married in Kansas. To this end, he married Jones by proxy, which infuriated the prison's administrators, who would not allow him to correspond with his wife. Prison officials {{were not the only}} ones perturbed with Stroud's marriage; his mother was also incensed. They had a close relationship, but Elizabeth Stroud strongly disapproved of the marriage to Jones, believing women were nothing but trouble for her son. Whereas previously she had been a strong advocate for her son, helping him with legal battles, she now argued against his application for parole, and became <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>obstacle</b> in his attempts to be released from the prison system. She moved away from Leavenworth and refused any further contact with him until her death in 1937.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{never again}} went on crusade {{after his return}} to England in 1274, but he {{maintained}} an intention to do so, and took the cross again in 1287. This intention guided much of his foreign policy, until at least 1291. To stage a European-wide crusade, it was essential to prevent conflict between the greater princes on the continent. <b>A</b> <b>major</b> <b>obstacle</b> to this was represented by {{the conflict between the}} French House of Anjou ruling southern Italy, and the kingdom of Aragon in Spain. In 1282, the citizens of Palermo rose up against Charles of Anjou and turned for help to Peter of Aragon, in what has become known as the Sicilian Vespers. In the war that followed, Charles of Anjou's son, Charles of Salerno, was taken prisoner by the Aragonese. The French began planning an attack on Aragon, raising the prospect of a large-scale European war. To Edward, it was imperative that such a war be avoided, and in Paris in 1286 he brokered a truce between France and Aragon that helped secure Charles' release. As far as the crusades were concerned, however, Edward's efforts proved ineffective. A devastating blow to his plans came in 1291, when the Mamluks captured Acre, the last Christian stronghold in the Holy Land.|$|E
5|$|Some large broad-winged birds rely on thermal {{columns of}} rising hot air {{to enable them}} to soar. These include many birds of prey such as vultures, eagles, and buzzards, but also storks. These birds migrate in the daytime. Migratory species in these groups have great {{difficulty}} crossing large bodies of water, since thermals only form over land, and these birds cannot maintain active flight for long distances. Mediterranean and other seas present <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>obstacle</b> to soaring birds, which must cross at the narrowest points. Massive numbers of large raptors and storks pass through areas such as the Strait of Messina, Gibraltar, Falsterbo, and the Bosphorus at migration times. More common species, such as the European honey buzzard Pernis apivorus, can be counted in hundreds of thousands in autumn. Other barriers, such as mountain ranges, can also cause funnelling, particularly of large diurnal migrants. This is a notable factor in the Central American migratory bottleneck. Batumi bottleneck in the Caucasus is one of the heaviest migratory funnels on earth. Avoiding flying over the Black Sea surface and across high mountains, hundreds of thousands of soaring birds funnel through an area around the city of Batumi, Georgia. Birds of prey such as honey buzzards which migrate using thermals lose only 10 to 20% of their weight during migration, which may explain why they forage less during migration than do smaller birds of prey with more active flight such as falcons, hawks and harriers.|$|E

The source of heterogeneity includes {{but is not}} limited to the following aspects: compositional diversity and conformational flexibility. The conformational variation that molecules undergo can be continuous or discrete. Compositional heterogeneity and conformational heterogeneity with discrete states usually lead to a finite number of classes that current 3 D classification algorithms can handle reasonably well. In contrast, continuous conformational change within a molecule would lead to an almost infinite number of classes.|$|R
