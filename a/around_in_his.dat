25|$|Two {{weeks before}} he was killed, Bermúdez Zacarías {{reached out to the}} Metepec {{municipal}} police for help and told them that he suspected that someone was following him. He also told this to Manuel Delgadillo Aguiñaga, one of his coworkers. After the murder, his coworker told investigators that Bermúdez Zacarías saw two suspicious men on a motorcycle one day in his neighborhood when he was coming back home from work. Bermúdez Zacarías decided to turn <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> car and drive away. Minutes later, he arrived home escorted by a Metepec police car. Despite fearing for his life, Bermúdez Zacarías did not officially ask for any sort of security measures or protection, and continued his daily activities as usual. According to his family, Bermúdez Zacarías never told them about this incident or that he faced any work-related death threats.|$|E
25|$|The Qianlong Emperor (25 September 1711– 7 February 1799) was {{the sixth}} emperor of the Manchu-led Qing dynasty, {{and the fourth}} Qing emperor to rule over China proper. Born Aisin Gioro Hongli, {{sometimes}} referred to simply as Hongli, the fourth son of the Yongzheng Emperor, he reigned officially from 11 October 1735 to 8 February 1796. On 8 February, he abdicated in favour of his son, the Jiaqing Emperor – a filial act {{in order not to}} reign longer than his grandfather, the illustrious Kangxi Emperor. Despite his retirement, however, he retained ultimate power as the Emperor Emeritus (or Retired Emperor) until his death in 1799; he thus was the longest-reigning de facto ruler in the history of China, and dying at the age of 87, the longest-living. As a capable and cultured ruler inheriting a thriving empire, during his long reign the Qing Empire reached its most splendid and prosperous era, boasting a large population and economy. As a military leader, he led military campaigns expanding the dynastic territory to the largest extent by conquering and sometimes destroying Central Asian kingdoms. This turned <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> late years: the Qing empire began to decline with corruption and wastefulness in his court and a stagnating civil society.|$|E

25|$|After the 1964 season, Chuck Fairbanks, an {{assistant}} coach at Houston, was offered a job at Tennessee. He wanted to accept, {{but it was the}} middle of the summer and unusually late for a coaching move, so he decided to stay loyal to Houston and remained there. After the next season, he was offered a position as {{an assistant}} on Mackenzie's staff at Oklahoma, a position he felt was a better job than the Tennessee position. Immediately after the 1965 season, Fairbanks was offered a job at Missouri with the promise that he would be the head coach within four years. He declined and stayed at Oklahoma. Four months later, Coach Mackenzie died and Fairbanks was named head coach. It did not take long for Fairbanks to turn the team <b>around.</b> <b>In</b> <b>his</b> first season in 1967, his squad went 10–1. They entered their sixth game with a 5–1 record (their only loss was a two-point loss to rival Texas) and unranked and beat ninth ranked Colorado, 23–0. This propelled Fairbanks's team to a number eight ranking. They continued their romp through the season and beat #2 Tennessee 26–24 in the Orange Bowl. They finished the season ranked number three in the country.|$|E
25|$|Richthofen {{moved his}} HQ to Ochamps {{to keep up}} with events, while he gambled on German air superiority holding out to fill forward airfields up with {{aircraft}} leading to overcrowding. He also had communication difficulties, and flew <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> Storch to organise air support for the army. Hugo Sperrle, chief of Luftflotte 3 (Air Fleet Three) arrived at the same HQ, disrupting staff work and leading Richthofen to explode with rage. The pressures compelled him to risk being shot down in order to pass on orders, and while flying on 22 May he was forced to land owing to a fractured fuel tank. He organised support for Reinhardt and covered Heinz Guderian's Corps, with KG 77, StG 77 and JG 27. While he complained about communication, {{by the standards of the}} day, it was efficient. The radio-equipped forward liaison officers assigned Fliegerkorps VIII new targets, while leaving less important orders to land line officers. The Ju 87s were on 20-minute alert, and within 45 to 75 minutes they were diving onto their targets. In some cases, they were able to respond in 10 minutes. By 21 May, with his fighters based at Charleville-Mézières, Ju 87s at Sint-Truiden, and his Do 17s back in Germany, Richthofen's logistics were overstretched and his fuel was running out.|$|E

When his attempts to control Nancy fails, he reports her to the police, making allegations she is {{having an affair with}} Newt; she is arrested and later fired. Fearing Nancy is not taking the allegations seriously, Jake verbally attacks her, branding her pathetic. She cries and begins blaming herself but Jake then comforts her, turning the situation <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> favour. Nancy is later cleared of the charges. Jake begins to distance her from her friends, deleting messages from her phone. Nancy discovers this and goes out with Hannah and Sarah Barnes who tell Nancy they dislike Jake and his treatment of Nancy. Nancy denies that Jake is mistreating her, further distancing herself from them. Jake later breaks her phone so that she can not contact them. When Charlie falls ill Nancy is unable to call for an ambulance so she has to leave Charlie and go for help. Jake blames Nancy for Charlie's condition. Charlie is diagnosed with leukaemia and needs a bone marrow transplant, leading to Nancy discovering Jake is not a donor match and thus not Charlie's biological father.|$|E

25|$|Gunther is an Australian of German and Scots ancestry, born in Melbourne on 15 August 1950. He {{attended}} Preston East Primary School from 1955 to 1956, and Balwyn North Primary School from 1956 until 1962. For his tenth birthday, Gunther {{received a}} copy of the now famous book entitled The Golden Book of Chemistry Experiments from an older cousin. Inspired by the book, he started working on various experiments, making use of various chemicals that could be found <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> house. After he spilled some potassium permanganate solution on his bedroom carpet his mother confined him to an alcove in the garage which he turned into a small laboratory, replete with industrial chemicals and second-hand laboratory glassware. Gunther was interested in finding out how things like detergents and oils were composed by cracking them in his fractionating column. He took particular interest in mixing paints for his art classes, as well as his chemistry classes in Balwyn High School. His father, being the Superintendent of Melbourne's electrical power station, borrowed an organic chemistry text from the chemists in the quality control laboratory. This ultimately led to an intense interest in synthesizing Azo dyes. At around age 14, Gunther attempted to predict the color of azo dyes based on the chromophore-auxochrome combination. Apart from drawing up empirical tables, this effort was largely unsuccessful due to his lack of knowledge of quantum theory.|$|E

500|$|The title, {{as well as}} Herman's illegal activities, are {{references}} to the 1971 film The French Connection. The couch gag, a parody of the gun barrel sequence in the James Bond films, shows some similarities to that of Sean Connery's own gunbarrel sequences. Several references are made to the 1980s police drama Hill Street Blues: the briefing scene {{at the police station}} is similar and the background and end credits music, are parodies of the show's theme. Marge appears on an episode of COPS, and McGriff the dog is a reference to McGruff the Crime Dog, a US police public relations figure. Additionally, Marge's training sequences features homages to Police Academy (1984) and Speed (1994). The Springfield Pops play the theme to the Star Wars films at an outdoor venue attended by Homer and Marge, and Homer mistakenly believes that the theme's composer John Williams is dead, complaining: [...] "Laser effects, mirrored ballsJohn Williams must be rolling <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> grave!".|$|E

[...] In return for his services and conduct during the engagement, he was decorated by the new Sultan. During {{the course of the war}} Mohun compiled a portfolio of photographs that he later published. [...] After the war Mohun served as a mediator between the Sultan and the British authorities. [...] On 6 July 1897 he informed his superiors of an outbreak of smallpox on the island among the Indian and native population and that an English missionary had been attacked for carrying a victim <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> arms.

500|$|Charles J. Shields, {{who wrote}} the first book-length {{biography}} of Harper Lee, offers {{the reason for the}} novel's enduring popularity and impact is that [...] "its lessons of human dignity and respect for others remain fundamental and universal". [...] Atticus' lesson to Scout that [...] "you never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view—until you climb <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> skin and walk around in it" [...] exemplifies his compassion. [...] She ponders the comment when listening to Mayella Ewell's testimony. [...] When Mayella reacts with confusion to Atticus' question if she has any friends, Scout offers that she must be lonelier than Boo Radley. [...] Having walked Boo home after he saves their lives, Scout stands on the Radley porch and considers the events of the previous three years from Boo's perspective. [...] One writer remarks, [...] "...hile the novel concerns tragedy and injustice, heartache and loss, it also carries with it a strong sense [...] courage, compassion, and an awareness of history to be better human beings." ...|$|E

500|$|On {{the morning}} of 9 July 1918 he {{travelled}} {{to the home of}} his fiancé, Miss Alex-Tweedie in Whitehall Court. Tweedie recalled their conversation revolved around his new posting and his book. He had delivered the manuscript to Mr Grey two days earlier and was expecting its publication. While there, McCudden promised to surpass von Richthofen who had been killed in action on 21 April 1918. In view of what happened to von Richthofen, and John McCudden, he promised that [...] "I won't bustle, or do anything foolish like my brother". He then went next door and had breakfast with his sister Mary. Upon leaving, he fumbled <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> pocket and handed her a bulky envelope containing his Victoria Cross and other decorations. He took his leave of her and drove to Hounslow where he climbed into his S.E.5a (C1126). He took off shortly after 13:00.

500|$|The scene {{takes place}} in Hog Lane, part of the slum {{district}} of St Giles with the church of St Giles in the Fields in the background. Hogarth would feature St Giles again as the background of Gin Lane and First Stage of Cruelty. The picture shows Huguenots leaving the French Church {{in what is now}} Soho. The Huguenot refugees had arrived in the 1680s and established themselves as tradesmen and artisans, particularly in the silk trade; and the French Church was their first place of worship. Hogarth contrasts their fussiness and high fashion with the slovenliness of the group {{on the other side of}} the road; the rotting corpse of a cat that has been stoned to death lying in the gutter that divides the street is the only thing the two sides have in common. The older members of the congregation wear traditional dress, while the younger members wear the fashions of the day.

Leo the Cinnamon Owl is a reference to Killer BOB, who possessed Leland Palmer and often {{took the form of}} an owl. The sheriff's deputy is Deputy Frost, named after Twin Peaks co-creator Mark Frost. The doctors of both Dual Spires and Twin Peaks have coconuts in their offices. Both Paula's and Laura's diaries described meetings with [...] "J". Sheriff Jackson tells Bob he needs to be strong for his wife. Dr Hayward says the same thing to Leland Palmer in Twin Peaks. Upon entering the town Gus mentions that the residents are looking {{at him as if he}} were the first black man they had ever seen. There are very few black men in Twin Peaks. When they enter the Sawmill Diner Bob Barker says [...] "Top of the morning to you." [...] In the first season of Twin Peaks, Pete Martell corrected Josie Packard on the saying. Maudette wears an orchid in her hair; Harold grew orchids in Twin Peaks. In the library Shawn asks if they can [...] "poke around" [...] but he and Gus immediately say [...] "peek" [...] in correction. Thus [...] "peek", as in Twin Peaks, is spoken twice. A man wearing a hat in the Sawmill Diner gives Shawn and Gus a thumbs up. The older room service attendant did the same thing to Agent Cooper in Twin Peaks. A record player is featured prominently in both the Barker and Palmer homes. The Roadhouse was also a location in Twin Peaks. Both Maudette and Audrey Horne love to dance. Paula's friend Jack is completely blind in one eye, referencing Twin Peaks' brothel named [...] "One Eyed Jacks". In the library Shawn and Gus find a book entitled [...] "Putt Your Way to a Better Future." [...] After Leland Palmer killed Maddy Ferguson he was seen putting golf balls <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> living room. When Randy is using the table saw it resembles the sawmill scene from the extended opening credits of Twin Peaks. When Maudette is placed in the body bag it is bent in such a way that it resembles a smile, like the smiling bag clue Agent Cooper found. On Maudette's desk beside her computer is a roll of green tape like the kind used by Leland Palmer to tie up Jacques Renault. In the cabin Bob Barker lights a match and holds it up like Leland Palmer did when describing BOB to Agent Cooper. Bob Barker wears a gold ring on his pinky, something Agent Cooper did in Twin Peaks. In the cabin the walls are red with red drapes as an allusion to the [...] "Red Room" [...] in Agent Cooper's dream.|$|E

Taking into account the appearance of the melody in the Klesch hymnbook and the history of the hymn given in the 1687 Nordhausen Gesangbuch, the Swiss theologian and musicologist Andreas Marti has suggested that it is plausible that, as he lay on his sick-bed in Jena, the cantor Severus Gastorius had the melody of Fabricius spinning [...] <b>around</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> head as an [...] "earworm" [...] and was inspired to add a second half.|$|E
