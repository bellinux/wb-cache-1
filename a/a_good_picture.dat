5|$|<b>A</b> <b>good</b> <b>picture</b> of {{the county}} in 1086 is given by Domesday Book, though there is some {{difficulty}} in identifying the various places since the hundreds are not specified. The total population given for the county, which had different boundaries to those today, was 13,399, however this only included the heads of households, so with their families {{this may have been}} around 67,000. Farming seems to have prospered for the next three centuries but was severely hit by the Black Death which in 1348 arrived in Dorset and quickly spread through Somerset, causing widespread mortality, perhaps as much as 50% in places. It re-occurred, resulting in a change in feudal practices since the manpower was no longer so available.|$|E
25|$|Middle to Late Bronze Age: Beginning {{with the}} Akkadian Empire around 2300 BC, the chronological {{evidence}} becomes internally more consistent. Essentially, for this period, <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>picture</b> {{can be drawn}} of who succeeded whom, and synchronisms between Mesopotamia, the Levant and the more robust chronology of Ancient Egypt can be established. The assignment of absolute dates {{is a matter of}} dispute; the conventional middle chronology fixes the sack of Babylon at 1595 BC while the short chronology fixes it at 1531 BC.|$|E

SR-71s at Mildenhall also {{played a key role}} in the 1986 Operation El Dorado Canyon involving American retaliatory action in Libya. The day after the attack, SR-71s made several unmolested flights over the bombed military targets around Tripoli and Benghazi.|$|E

25|$|Though {{many of the}} Morrison Formation fossils are fragmentary, {{they are}} {{sufficient}} to provide <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>picture</b> of {{the flora and fauna}} in the Morrison Basin during the Kimmeridgian. Overall, the climate was dry, similar to a savanna but, since there were no angiosperms (grasses, flowers, and some trees), the flora was quite different. Conifers, the dominant plants of the time, were to be found with ginkgos, cycads, tree ferns, and horsetail rushes. Much of the fossilized vegetation was riparian, living along the river flood plains. Insects were very similar to modern species, with termites building 30m (100ft.) tall nests. Along the rivers, there were fish, frogs, salamanders, lizards, crocodiles, turtles, pterosaurs, crayfish, clams, and monotremes (prototherian mammals, the largest of which was {{about the size of a}} rat).|$|E
500|$|Food {{at various}} stages of {{digestion}} {{has been found in}} the intestines of several woolly mammoths, giving <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>picture</b> of their diet. Woolly mammoths sustained themselves on plant food, mainly grass and sedges, which were supplemented with herbaceous plants, flowering plants, shrubs, mosses, and tree matter. The composition and exact varieties differed from location to location. Woolly mammoths needed a varied diet to support their growth, like modern elephants. An adult of six tonnes would need to eat [...] daily, and may have foraged as long as twenty hours every day. The two-fingered tip of the trunk was probably adapted for picking up the short grasses of the last ice age (Quaternary glaciation, 2.58 million years ago to present) by wrapping around them, whereas modern elephants curl their trunks around the longer grass of their tropical environments. The trunk could also be used for pulling off large grass tufts, delicately picking buds and flowers, and tearing off leaves and branches where trees and shrubs were present. The [...] "Yukagir mammoth" [...] had ingested plant matter that contained spores of dung fungus. Isotope analysis shows that woolly mammoths fed mainly on C3 plants, unlike horses and rhinos.|$|E

2500|$|He {{said that}} all one {{needs to be a}} good {{photographer}} is “eyes” with the intention of seeing, the ability to see and to reflection on what is seen. “The whole world thinks that to take super photographs, one needs super knowledge, super equipment, super locations and with the humble “disposable” camera that is at home, never make anything interesting…” He stated that the technology of photography has made the basics accessible to children and knowing all of {{it is not necessary to}} know when you have <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>picture</b> or not. He himself often took pictures with nothing more than a Nikon snapshot camera, saying he needed nothing more.

2500|$|Heinrich Isaac's career spanned {{well over}} thirty years and allowed him to travel far from his {{homeland}} of Flanders into Germany, Italy, and Austria, {{as well as other}} parts of central Europe. [...] While the absence of plentiful primary sources makes it hard for us to map out Isaac's life, piecing together the sources we do have along with the works he wrote gives us <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>picture</b> of just how popular this Franco-Flemish composer was in his time. [...] Isaac was probably writing music by the 1470s, and the first document mentioning his name dates back to 15 September 1484, placing him in Innsbruck as a singer for Duke Sigismund of Austria, of the House of Habsburg. [...] The following year Isaac migrated to Florence, since documents show that by July 1485 Isaac had become employed as a singer at the church Santa Maria del Fiore. [...] By the middle of 1491, he was designated as a singer at Santissima Annunziata, a position that he held until 1493.|$|E
2500|$|British Intelligence {{were very}} keen to obtain {{information}} about the new V-2 missile site. The first reports came in October 1943 from the Polish underground Home Army (...) Intelligence HQ in Warsaw, stating {{that a number of}} villages around Dębica were being forcibly evacuated. This area was already known for its SStraining centre SS-Truppenübungsplatz Heidelager. Further reports brought information about a new railway line being constructed in the same vicinity, leading to Blizna. A report made on 14 February 1944 gave information about a sighting of a rocket [...] " [...] long and [...] a weight of seven tons". On 22 February the report was of a projectile [...] " [...] long, [...] a diameter [...] and a weight of twelve tons". These missiles were being fired 24 hours a day. The codebreakers at Bletchley Park in England also managed to decrypt vital information from German communications. These made mention of [...] " [...] (experimental staff) [...] Siegfried" [...] and of [...] "SS-Truppenübungsplatz Heidelager". Many more communications were intercepted and decrypted, which together with information from the Polish, helped British Intelligence build up <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>picture</b> of what was going on.|$|E
2500|$|On 1 February 1973 King succeeded Sir Harry Tuzo as GOC Northern Ireland and Director of Operations. This was {{the worst}} period of the Troubles, nearly 12,000 bombing and {{shooting}} incidents had occurred the year before King's appointment, {{but by the end}} of his period in command, the figure was down to just under 2,500 a year. His obituary in The Times states that he [...] "was regarded by many as the best and most successful Director of Operations in Northern Ireland in the 1970s and 1980s", though it also notes that he himself would be happy to attribute much of the preparatory work to Tuzo (who has been described in similar terms). His success was attributable to a number of factors: he regularly visited the troops on the ground which gave him <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>picture</b> of the difficulties faced in particular areas; once a unit or commander had proved itself, he was happy to delegate considerable authority, in particular to his immediate subordinate, Commander Land Forces (Sir) Peter Leng; he had a good relationship with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Merlyn Rees, who said of King [...] "You have never played at politics and I have never played at being a soldier; that's why we have got on so well." [...] He was replaced in the post by Lieutenant-General Sir David House on 1 August 1975. King was promoted to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) in the 1976 New Year Honours.|$|E
