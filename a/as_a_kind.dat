5|$|Convolution {{is used to}} add two {{independent}} random variables defined by distribution functions. Its usual definition combines integration, subtraction, and multiplication. In general, convolution is useful <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of domain-side addition; by contrast, vector addition {{is a kind of}} range-side addition.|$|E
5|$|General homomorphisms {{can also}} be thought of <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of coloring: if the {{vertices}} of a fixed graph H are the available colors and edges of H describe which colors are compatible, then an H-coloring of G is an assignment of colors to vertices of G such that adjacent vertices get compatible colors.|$|E

5|$|Countershading is {{less often}} used for {{military}} camouflage, despite Second World War experiments that showed its effectiveness. English zoologist Hugh Cott encouraged the use of techniques including countershading, but despite his authority on the subject, failed to persuade the British authorities. Soldiers often wrongly viewed camouflage netting <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of invisibility cloak, {{and they had to}} be taught to look at camouflage practically, from the enemy observer's point of view. At the same time in Australia, zoologist William John Dakin advised soldiers to copy animals' methods, using their instincts for wartime camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Feminist economists {{join the}} UN {{and others in}} {{acknowledging}} care work, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of work which includes all tasks involving caregiving, as central to economic development and human well-being. Feminist economists study both paid and unpaid care work. They argue that traditional analysis of economics often ignores the value of household unpaid work. Feminist economists have argued that unpaid domestic work is as valuable as paid work, so measures of economic success should include unpaid work. They have shown that women are disproportionately responsible for performing such care work.|$|E

5|$|The Republic of Senegal {{placed an}} {{emphasis}} on tourism early in its history. The results were promising, and developing the industry further became a priority in the country's 4th Economic and Social Plan (19731977). Casamance subsequently became the main tourist destination in the country. Already having been described in the 19th century by Captain Brosselard-Faidherbe <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of Brazil in Africa, Carabane seemed well-placed to attract visitors in search of exoticism as well as vacationers seeking sandy beaches and kite surfing.|$|E
5|$|The weapon dance employs weapons—or stylized {{versions}} of weapons—traditionally used in combat {{in order to}} simulate, recall, or reenact combat or the moves of combat {{in the form of}} dance, usually for some ceremonial purpose. Such dancing is quite common to folk ritual {{in many parts of the}} world. Weapon dancing is certainly ancient; among the earliest historical references we have are those that refer to the pyrrhic, a weapon dance in ancient Sparta, in which the dance was used <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of ritual training for battle.|$|E

5|$|Brittain {{was known}} by {{reputation}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind,</b> gentle man and was well liked {{by students and}} faculty. He was especially remembered for his dedication to the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team, attending nearly every game including those taking place out-of-state. Outside of Georgia Tech, Brittain taught Sunday school classes and maintained active membership {{in a number of}} service organizations. Brittain retired from his position as president of Georgia Tech in 1944, after which he penned a history of the Institute entitled The Story of Georgia Tech, completed in 1948. He died in 1953, survived by three children: McDonald, Marion Luther, Jr., and Ida, three grandsons, and a great-granddaughter. Flags at the university were flown at half-staff for a month in remembrance of Brittain, and classes were cancelled {{for the rest of the}} school week.|$|E
5|$|Different {{subspecies}} of plains zebra were recognised {{as members}} of Equus quagga by early researchers, though there was much confusion over which species were valid. Quagga subspecies were described {{on the basis of}} differences in striping patterns, but these differences were since attributed to individual variation within the same populations. Some subspecies and even species, such as E. q. danielli and Hippotigris isabellinus, were only based on illustrations (iconotypes) of aberrant quagga specimens. Some authors have described the quagga <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of wild horse rather than a zebra, and one craniometric study from 1980 seemed to confirm its affiliation with the horse (Equus caballus). It has been pointed out that early morphological studies were erroneous; using skeletons from stuffed specimens can be problematical, as early taxidermists sometimes used donkey and horse skulls inside their mounts when the originals were unavailable.|$|E
5|$|Ecosystems are {{regularly}} confronted with natural environmental variations and disturbances {{over time and}} geographic space. A disturbance is any process that removes biomass from a community, such as a fire, flood, drought, or predation. Disturbances occur over vastly different ranges in terms of magnitudes as well as distances and time periods, and are both the cause and product of natural fluctuations in death rates, species assemblages, and biomass densities within an ecological community. These disturbances create places of renewal where new directions emerge from the patchwork of natural experimentation and opportunity. Ecological resilience is a cornerstone theory in ecosystem management. Biodiversity fuels the resilience of ecosystems acting <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of regenerative insurance.|$|E

5|$|Having {{resigned}} the Bishopric of Chiapas, Las Casas {{spent the}} rest of his life working closely with the imperial court in matters relating to the Indies. In 1551 he rented a cell at the College of San Gregorio, where he lived with his assistant and friend Fray Rodrigo de Ladrada. He continued working <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of procurator for the natives of the Indies, many of whom directed petitions to him to speak to the Emperor on their behalf. Sometimes indigenous nobility even related their cases to him in Spain, for example, the Nahua noble Francisco Tenamaztle from Nochistlán. His influence at court was so great that some even considered that he had the final word in choosing the members of the Council of the Indies.|$|E
5|$|In 1678, Ashmole {{stood as}} a {{candidate}} in a by-election for the Lichfield borough parliamentary constituency caused {{by the death of}} one of the two incumbent members. During Ashmole's campaign his cousin, Thomas Smalridge, who was acting <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of campaign manager, fell ill and died. Ashmole did not visit the constituency, and, as Ashmole's own horoscope had predicted, he lost the election. He also put himself forward {{as a candidate}} in the general election of 1685. Surviving documents indicate that he was the most popular candidate, but after King James II requested he stand down (in an age when monarchs were likely to interfere with parliamentary elections), Ashmole did so. On election day, all the votes cast for Ashmole, instead of being declared invalid, were declared as votes for the King's candidate, and only {{as a result of this}} ruse was the candidate favoured by the Court (Richard Leveson) elected.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, Canadian Davidson Black {{identified}} two fossilized teeth {{he had found}} in Zhoukoudian near Beijing as belonging to an ancient human, and named his specimen Sinanthropus pekinensis, now better known as Peking Man. In December 1929, {{the first of several}} skullcaps was found on the same site, and it appeared similar but slightly larger than Java Man. Franz Weidenreich, who replaced Black in China after the latter's death in 1933, argued that Sinanthropus was also a transitional fossil between apes and humans, and was in fact so similar to Java's Pithecanthropus that they should both belong to the family Hominidae. Eugène Dubois categorically refused to entertain this possibility, dismissing Peking Man <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of Neanderthal, closer to humans than the Pithecanthropus, and insisting that Pithecanthropus belonged to its own family, the Pithecanthropoidae.|$|E

5|$|Jains {{believe that}} karma is a {{physical}} substance that is everywhere in the universe. Karma particles are attracted to the soul {{by the actions of}} that soul. Karma particles are attracted when we do, think, or say things, when we kill something, when we lie, when we steal and so on. Karma not only encompasses the causality of transmigration, but is also conceived of as an extremely subtle matter, which infiltrates the soul—obscuring its natural, transparent and pure qualities. Karma is thought of <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of pollution, that taints the soul with various colours (leśyā). Based on its karma, a soul undergoes transmigration and reincarnates in various states of existence—like heavens or hells, or as humans or animals.|$|E
5|$|John Constantine, {{the main}} {{character}} of Hellblazer, was portrayed <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of confidence man and occult detective who did morally questionable things, arguably for the greater good. He usually triumphed through guile, deceit, and misdirection, but often made more enemies in the process than he defeated. Indeed, it was a common theme {{in the book that}} Constantine was unable to effect any lasting change or enjoy unequivocal victories. While sometimes striving for the good of mankind, Constantine was often manipulative and a dangerous person to have as a friend, as the lives and souls of those around him became perilously involved in his misadventures. He took pains to protect himself from direct attacks, but his friends and relatives were often endangered in order to strike at him. The spirits of deceased friends haunted him, individually or as an entourage of ghosts.|$|E
5|$|On {{the basis}} of some 2000 examples, one {{commentator}} has argued that “Gray’s Elegy has probably inspired more adaptations than any other poem in the language”. It has also been suggested that parody acts <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of translation into the same tongue as the original, something that the printing history of some examples seems to confirm. One of the earliest, John Duncombe’s “An evening contemplation in a college” (1753), frequently reprinted {{to the end of}} the 18th century, was included alongside translations of the Elegy into Latin and Italian in the 1768 and 1775 Dublin editions and 1768 Cork edition of Gray’s works. In the case of the American The Political Passing Bell: An Elegy. Written in a Country Meeting House, April 1789; Parodized from Gray for the Entertainment of Those Who Laugh at All Parties by George Richards (d.1804) and published from Boston MA, the parody was printed opposite Gray's original page by page, making the translation to the political context more obvious.|$|E
