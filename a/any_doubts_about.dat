5|$|In December 1531, the Zurich council {{selected}} Heinrich Bullinger as his successor. He immediately removed <b>any</b> <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> Zwingli's orthodoxy {{and defended}} {{him as a}} prophet and a martyr. During Bullinger's rule, the confessional divisions of the Confederation were stabilised. He rallied the reformed cities and cantons and helped them {{to recover from the}} defeat at Kappel. Zwingli had instituted fundamental reforms, while Bullinger consolidated and refined them.|$|E
5|$|On February 10, 1798, Garrard's son William, still {{serving in}} the state senate, {{introduced}} a bill to hold another vote on calling a constitutional convention. In May 1798, 9,188 of the 16,388 votes {{were in favor of}} calling a convention. Again, almost 5,000 of the ballots contained no vote either way. On November 21, 1798, the House of Representatives voted 3615 in favor of a convention, and the Senate provided its requisite two-thirds majority days later. No official tally of the Senate's vote was published. The Assembly's vote rendered moot <b>any</b> <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> the popular vote.|$|E
5|$|Taylor apprised President McKinley of the {{situation}} in Kentucky. He stopped short of asking for intervention by federal troops, and McKinley assured a delegation of Kentucky's federal legislators that such intervention would occur only as a last resort. Republican legislators made preparations to heed Taylor's call to convene in London on February 5. Meanwhile, in order to resolve <b>any</b> <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> the legitimacy of their earlier meeting, Democratic legislators met at the state house—no longer being denied entrance by the state militia—and again voted to adopt the majority report declaring Goebel and Beckham the winners of the election. Both men again took the oath of office.|$|E

5|$|When Joan {{comes to}} speak with Charles, the Dauphin pretends to be a common member of the court while someone else pretends to be him. Joan is able {{to see through the}} ruse and {{immediately}} proclaims that she is sent to restore the French crown to him at Rheims. Charles has her examined by priests and scholars to determine that she is free of black magic. While questioned, Joan describes how God came to her with visions and describes her faith in a similar manner to deism. This causes the examiners to believe that she is a heretic until a blue flame appears along with a sound, which is enough to silence <b>any</b> <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> her faith. The flame reveals a suit of armour for her, but one individual interrupts her immediate donning of the armour to claim that France is cursed and that she would be a victim. The individual, as it turns out, is Conrade, who blames himself that Joan left her peaceful life to help a French court that was corrupt. He also warns her that he experienced a vision of her burning at the stake.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Mackay studied {{physics at}} the University of Cambridge under Ernest Rutherford before {{returning}} to Australia and his old job as a lecturer at the University of Sydney. From 1933 to 1940 he was headmaster of Cranbrook School, Sydney. He remained in the Militia between the wars, and was a major general {{by the time the}} Second World War broke out. He was selected to command the 6th Division in 1940, and led it through the Australian Army's first battles of the war. <b>Any</b> <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> his ability soon disappeared with the commitment of the division to the Western Desert Campaign. During the Battle of Bardia in January 1941, the 6th Division captured the fortified town along with 36,000 Italian prisoners. In the Battle of Greece, he became the only Australian general to face the Waffen-SS in battle. He suffered a series of reverses in Greece, but impressed the troops under his command with his courage under fire. He was recalled to Australia in 1941 to serve as General Officer Commanding Home Forces. On 6 April 1942, he assumed command of the Second Army. During 1943 he twice commanded New Guinea Force in the fighting in the New Guinea campaign. His active service ended with his appointment as High Commissioner to India in November 1943.|$|E

Dodsley {{included}} it in his Select Collection of Old Plays in 1744, but Marlowe's name was not even mentioned in the preface. Marlowe's reputation was still damaged by Thomas Beard's libel in The Theatre of God’s Judgement, published in 1597.|$|E

25|$|For Presley's {{return in}} March 1960, Parker had {{arranged}} for a train to take him from Washington, D.C., to Memphis, with stops along the way for fans to see their idol in person.

25|$|The {{accuracy}} of the Mishnah's claim that the Mishnaic calendar was also used in the late Second Temple period is less certain. One scholar has noted {{that there are no}} laws from Second Temple period sources that indicate <b>any</b> <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> the length of a month or of a year. This led him to propose that the priests must have had some form of computed calendar or calendrical rules that allowed them to know in advance whether a month would have 30 or 29 days, and whether a year would have 12 or 13 months.|$|E
25|$|In 2016 Trimble {{supported}} the Leave {{side in the}} UK referendum on EU membership. He {{said that if he}} had ever had <b>any</b> <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> the issue, 'his eight years on the EU Select Committees in the House of Lords – which scrutinise the EU’s operations – had convinced him of the need to cut ties with Brussels'. He cited a study which found that economic growth in the UK reduced after the decision to enter the Common Market, and reduced further when the UK went into the Single Market.|$|E

25|$|Among {{the many}} {{changes to the}} {{original}} story was {{the introduction of a}} MacGuffin: a cache of uranium being held in Sebastian's wine cellar by the Nazis. At the time, it was not common knowledge that uranium was being used {{in the development of the}} atomic bomb, and Selznick had trouble understanding its use as a plot device. Indeed, Hitchcock later claimed he was followed by the FBI for several months after he and Hecht discussed uranium with Robert Millikan at Caltech in mid-1945. In any event, the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, and the release of details of the Manhattan Project, removed <b>any</b> <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> its use.|$|E
25|$|By January 1983, four victims {{thus far}} killed had been {{tentatively}} {{linked to the}} same killer. A Moscow police team, headed by Major Mikhail Fetisov, was sent to Rostov-on-Don to direct the investigation. Fetisov established a team of 10 investigators, based in Rostov, charged with solving all four cases. In March, Fetisov assigned a newly appointed specialist forensic analyst, Viktor Burakov, to head the investigation. The following month, Olga Stalmachenok's body was found. Burakov was summoned to the crime scene, where he examined the numerous knife wounds and eviscerations conducted upon the child, and the striations on her eye sockets. Burakov later stated that, as he noted the striations upon Stalmachenok's eye sockets, <b>any</b> <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> {{the presence of a}} serial killer evaporated.|$|E
25|$|Early in 1945 Lange was {{appointed}} {{head of the}} SD and the SS in Posen, Warthegau. Soon after he reached the city, Posen was surrounded by the Soviet Red Army and was declared a fortified city (Festung). Lange, who could not have <b>any</b> <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> his destiny as a prisoner, directed the police under his command with fanaticism. He was wounded during the Battle of Poznan and the siege by Russian forces and was promoted SS-Standartenführer (30 January 1945). At Hitler's behest, on 6 February 1945 he received the German Cross in gold. Lange may have died or committed suicide when the Red Army seized Poznań on 23 February 1945 after a last-ditch defence of the city by {{the remnants of the}} German garrison.|$|E

25|$|At {{the start}} of the war, the Irish Republican Army (IRA) split into two {{opposing}} camps: a pro-treaty IRA and an anti-treaty IRA. The pro-treaty IRA disbanded and joined the new National Army. However, because the anti-treaty IRA lacked an effective command structure and because of the pro-treaty forces' defensive tactics throughout the war, Michael Collins and his pro-treaty forces were able to build up an army with many tens of thousands of World War I veterans from the 1922 disbanded Irish regiments of the British Army, capable of overwhelming the anti-treatyists. British supplies of artillery, aircraft, machine-guns and ammunition boosted pro-treaty forces, and the threat of a return of Crown forces to the Free State removed <b>any</b> <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> the necessity of enforcing the treaty. The lack of public support for the anti-treaty forces (often called the Irregulars) and the determination of the government to overcome the Irregulars contributed significantly to their defeat.|$|E
500|$|Just a {{day after}} {{returning}} for pre-season training with Leeds, on 28 June 2013, Morison joined former club Millwall, also of the Championship, on a season-long loan deal. On rejoining Millwall, Morison stated – [...] "I'm pleased to be back here. If anybody has <b>any</b> <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> me all I'd say is that I aim to score plenty of goals for Millwall and help this club to greater success". Morison finished the season with eight goals in 41 appearances, helping the London club stave off relegation from the Championship with a 19th-place finish.|$|E
500|$|In 1841, President William Henry Harrison {{became the}} first U.S. President to die in office. Representative John Williams had {{previously}} suggested that the Vice President should become Acting President upon {{the death of the}} President. John Tyler asserted that he had succeeded to the presidency, as opposed to only obtaining its powers and duties. He also declined to acknowledge documents referring to him as [...] "Acting President". Although he felt his vice presidential oath negated the need for the presidential oath, Tyler was persuaded that being formally sworn-in would clear up <b>any</b> <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> his right to the office. Having done so, he then moved into the White House and assumed full presidential powers. Tyler's claim was not formally challenged, and both houses of Congress adopted a resolution confirming that Tyler was the tenth President of the United States, without any qualifiers. The precedent of full succession was thus established. This became known as the [...] "Tyler Precedent".|$|E

500|$|All of the {{officers}} and troopers of Forbes' column had high praise for Burnham's actions, and none reported <b>any</b> <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> his conduct even decades later. One member of the column, Trooper ME Weale, told the Rhodesia Herald in 1944 that once Commandant Piet Raaff took over command from the disgraced Major Forbes it was greatly due to Burnham's good scouting that the column managed to get away: [...] "I have always felt that the honours were equally divided between these two men, to whom we owed our lives on that occasion." [...] For his service in the war, Burnham was presented the British South Africa Company Medal, a gold watch, and a share of a 300-acre (120ha) tract of land in Matabeleland. It was here that Burnham uncovered many artifacts in the huge granite ruins of the ancient civilization of Great Zimbabwe. Matabeleland {{became part of the}} Company domain, which was formally named Rhodesia, after Rhodes, in 1895. Matabeleland and Mashonaland became collectively called Southern Rhodesia.|$|E
500|$|The AAFC {{proposed}} match-ups with NFL teams {{numerous times}} during its four-year existence, but no inter-league game ever materialized. That made Cleveland's {{entry into the}} NFL in the 1950 season the first test of whether its early supremacy could continue into a more established league. The proof came quickly: Cleveland's NFL regular-season opener was against the two-time defending champion Philadelphia Eagles on September 16 in Philadelphia. The Browns lit up the Eagles' vaunted defense for 487 total yards—including 246 passing yards from Graham and his receivers—in a 35–10 win before a crowd of 71,237. [...] This decisive win quashed <b>any</b> <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> the Browns' prowess. Behind an offense that featured Graham, Groza, Motley, Lavelli and running back Dub Jones, Cleveland finished the 1950 season with a 10–2 record, tied for {{first place in the}} Eastern Conference. After winning a playoff game against the New York Giants, the Browns advanced to the NFL championship match against the Los Angeles Rams in Cleveland. The Browns won 30–28 on a last-minute Groza field goal. Fans stormed the field after the victory, carting off the goalposts, ripping off one player's jersey and setting a bonfire in the bleachers. [...] "It was the greatest game I ever saw", Brown later said.|$|E
500|$|Burnham, Ingram and Gooding each {{received}} the British South Africa Company Medal for their {{service in the}} First Matabele War, and all three subsequently served in the Second Matabele War of 1896–97. All of the officers and troopers of Forbes' column reported high praise for Burnham's actions and none reported <b>any</b> <b>doubts</b> <b>about</b> his conduct even decades later. One member of the column, Trooper ME Weale, told the Rhodesia Herald on 22 December 1944 that once Commandant Raaff took over command it was greatly due to Burnham's good scouting that the column managed to get away: [...] "I have always felt that the honours were equally divided between these two men, to whom we owed our lives on that occasion." [...] Burnham proceeded to become a key figure {{for a number of}} commanding officers, including Frederick Carrington, Robert Baden-Powell, and Frederick Roberts. Carrington called him [...] "the finest scout who ever scouted in Africa. He was my Chief of Scouts in '96 in Matabeleland and he was the eyes and ears of my force". The US President Theodore Roosevelt described him in 1901 as [...] "a scout and a hunter of courage and ability, a man totally without fear, a sure shot, and a fighter... the ideal scout." [...] While fighting with the British Army in the Second Boer War, Burnham was adjudged to have shown exceptional heroism and was decorated with the Distinguished Service Order, then Britain's second highest military honour.|$|E
