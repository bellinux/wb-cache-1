40|$|The {{objective}} of the research {{was to assess the}} changes in the quality and shelf life of tvarog wrapped in Eco Lean and packed either under vacuum or atmospheric air, during its storage in refrigerated conditions. The performed investigations comprised the following analyses: physic-ochemical (whey drainage, water and fat content, pH, titrable acidity, content of free fatty acids, colour indices), microbiological (number of acid forming bacteria and total number of microorganisms, numbers of moulds and yeasts, presence of coliform bacteria) and organoleptic (evalua-tion of such parameters as: consistency, colour, taste, smell and the overall acceptability). Tvarog was analysed directly after its manufacture and after every two consecutive days of its refrigerated storage during the period of 24 days (vacuum packed tvarog) and 10 days (<b>air</b> <b>packed</b> tvarog). On the basis of the results obtained, {{it was found that the}} wrapping of fresh white cheese in Eco Lean and vacuum packing, when compared with <b>air</b> <b>packing,</b> results in a considerable reduction of unfavourable physicochemical changes and sensory properties in the course of its refrigerated storage. The number of yeasts exceeded the level of 103 cfu/g after 24 days of the vacuum packed and after 10 days of the <b>air</b> <b>packed</b> tvarog stor-age. In comparison with <b>air</b> <b>packing,</b> vacuum packing allows extending by 2. 7 times the shelf life of fresh white cheese stored at a temperature of 5 ± 1 °C. The vacuum packed tvarog exhibited good quality over the period of its 3 -week storage in refrigerated conditions...|$|R

50|$|A {{self-contained}} self-rescue device, SCSR, self-contained self-rescuer, or <b>air</b> <b>pack</b> is {{a portable}} oxygen source for providing breathable air when the surrounding atmosphere lacks oxygen or is contaminated with toxic gases, e.g. carbon monoxide. A SCSR {{is usually a}} closed-circuit breathing apparatus with a chemical oxygen generator or a compressed oxygen cylinder and a carbon dioxide absorber. SCSRs are most commonly used in some coal mines, are intended for one person, and usually supply at least one hour of oxygen. SCSRs are intended to facilitate escape from mines after a fire or explosion. They are also used by people working with machinery {{on the surface of}} a mine or pit, in case they become covered by such materials as coal or sand. Usage of SCSRs for other purposes is discouraged.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to evaluate the effect of vacuum packaging in combination with antimelanotic treatment on quality characteristics and melanosis in farmed tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon) collected from Ratnagiri region of Maharashtra. The processed shrimps were treated with sulfite mixture in water (30 g kg- 1) and divided into two lots each with 250 shrimps. One of them was vacuum packed, the other was <b>air</b> <b>packed</b> and stored under ice. The ice stored shrimps were analyzed for quality attributes and melanosis for a period of 27 days. The treated vacuum packed shrimps had a shelf life of 24 days, whereas <b>air</b> <b>packed</b> shrimp had 16 days only. Melanosis was absent in the shrimps from both the lots throughout the storage period.

50|$|An {{accident}} {{occurred on}} March 19, 1981 {{that led to}} the deaths of three people. During a countdown test for STS-1, a pure nitrogen atmosphere was introduced in the aft engine compartment of Columbia to reduce the danger of an explosion from the many other potentially dangerous gases on board the orbiter. At the conclusion of the test, pad workers were given clearance to return to work on the orbiter, even though the nitrogen had not yet been purged due to a recent procedure change. Three technicians, John Bjornstand, Forrest Cole, and Nick Mullon, entered the compartment without air packs, unaware of the danger since nitrogen gas is odorless and colorless, and lost consciousnesses due to lack of oxygen. Several minutes later, another worker saw them and tried to help, but passed out himself. The fourth did not alert anyone, but was himself seen by two other people. Of those two, one alerted a security guard and another went to help the unconscious group. The security guard entered the compartment with an <b>air</b> <b>pack</b> and removed the five men from the compartment.|$|E

5000|$|Truck - The truck {{company is}} {{a vital part of}} the {{suppression}} operation in Baltimore. Every truck company is outfitted with a 100' aerial ladder, an assortment of portable ground ladders, extensive forced entry tools, a Holmatro portable power unit with combination tool, several gasoline-powered ventilation and demolition saws, an electric reciprocating saw, basic life rope packs, basic and advanced life support medical equipment, a four-gas air monitor, a thermal imager, and a rapid intervention kit including a RIT <b>air</b> <b>pack.</b> The BCFD's fleet of ladder trucks is made up of both straight-body trucks and tractor-drawn aerials ("tillers"); there are both Pierce and Seagrave vehicles in the BCFD's fleet of first-line trucks. Daily staffing of truck companies vary between straight-body trucks and TDAs; a straight-body truck is staffed by an Emergency Vehicle Driver or acting EVD, an officer (Captain, Lieutenant, or Acting Lieutenant), and two firefighters, while a TDA is staffed two EVDs or Acting EVDs, an officer or acting officer, and one firefighter. An additional firefighter may be assigned to certain truck companies during times of increased staffing.|$|E
30|$|Firefighters’ input in {{this study}} also showed that they {{experience}} soreness in the shoulder and back, which is related to wearing SCBA. Previous studies found that wearing SCBA is positively related to loss of body balance and fall injuries on the fire ground by shifting the body’s center of gravity and causing gait instability (Park et al. 2010). By wearing the SCBA (weighing about 30 – 40 pounds) on the back, the firefighter’s center of gravity shifts upward and backward from the pelvis (original location of unloaded body). The gravity shift caused by wearing the heavy SCBA may have greater impacts on mobility to lighter-weight firefighters, since the ratio of body mass to weight of load carriage is a critical factor to fatigue increase (Marshall 1980). Similarly, {{the negative impact of}} wearing SCBA can be greater to shorter firefighters who may have less body mass as the shift of center of gravity is dominated by the additional weight and the dimensions of the <b>air</b> <b>pack,</b> relative to the body profile; taller firefighters have a relatively longer torso allowing them to lower the SCBA resulting in improved neck mobility and possibly alleviating the impact of SCBA on the shifting of the center of mass. Griefahn et al. (2003) demonstrated that lowering the weight distribution of the <b>air</b> <b>pack</b> on the back could improve firefighters’ mobility and work experience. They reported that rucksack style SCBA, featuring a lower placement of the <b>air</b> <b>pack</b> and an even weight distribution throughout the back, resulted in faster task completion with less fatigue than a conventional cylindrical shaped SCBA. Based on the aforementioned ergonomic consideration and previous research, an attempt to lower the placement of the <b>air</b> <b>pack</b> may minimize the shifting of the center of gravity, as well as avert physical conflicts with the back brim of the helmet, thus improving body balance and the range of motion around the neck area in firefighters. Research and design efforts to distribute the weight of the <b>air</b> <b>pack</b> more evenly around the torso are necessary in order to alleviate back pains and muscle soreness. Park et al. (2013) study affirmed that wearing a backpack can result in chronic lumbar pain over time. Furthermore, relocating coat pockets should also be considered in order to enhance firefighter access to their tools while wearing the SCBA.|$|E

Thereafter, the NO 2 concentration within the suit will increase for 35 minutes at a rate of 0. 07 ppm per minute and then at a gradually decreasing rate until an equilibrium concentration of 3. 4 ppm is attained after 100 minutes. Momentary increases of as much as 1. 6 ppm can be expected if the wearer were to rise quickly from a squatting position, but the additional NO 2 would be dissipated within three minutes.

Firefighters mentioned that wearing SCBA restricts their arm movement considerably: “You can’t reach up – your jacket sort of moves with you but if you’ve got the SCBA buckled around you (Site # 1).” “Sometimes the straps do limit your mobility and your access to different things like when you have to reach over head (Site # 6).” Another common response was a hindrance in accessing the pockets because the SCBA straps tend to block access to pockets which likely impedes firefighters from reaching tools in the pockets when they need to use them: “I don’t {{think a lot of people}} put the stuff in the coat pockets because it gets tangled up with your SCBA pack. Most people just use their leg pockets (Site # 3).” [...]...|$|E
40|$|Various {{aspects of}} {{freezing}} preservation and packaging methods were studied for feasibility of use for beef and poultry in practical applications;Investigations {{on the effects}} of combining fresh and frozen beef in different proportions showed that a 50 : 50 ratio of fresh to frozen beef produced higher bacterial numbers than observed when other proportions were combined and held in frozen storage. No health hazard was evident from any of the different combinations of fresh or frozen beef or from liquid nitrogen or liquid CO(, 2) freezing and frozen storage. Changes in bacterial flora as a result of freezing and frozen storage were studied by classifying the isolates into phenotypic groups with the help of replica plating and computerized cluster analysis. Reference cultures were used to identify the clusters. The Moraxella-Acinetobacter group increased considerably in percentage of total isolates after freezing, with a decline during frozen storage. A concomitant increase in the Pseudomonas group of organisms occurred during frozen storage. Certain characteristics of the bacterial flora that were related to spoilage of beef such as lipolysis of beef fat and proteolysis became more pronounced after frozen storage. These changes generally followed the pattern of alterations in the proportions of Pseudomonas to other groups;Studies {{on the effects of}} packaging materials and methods on shelf life of chicken showed that a high barrier (vacuum package) material provided greatest restriction of bacterial multiplication, a low barrier (vacuum package) was next effective and a stretch wrap in a tray (<b>air</b> <b>pack)</b> was least effective.

40|$|From {{the team}} {{surveying}} and data collection, production conditions and product quality problems of Namprik or chili paste product made by Thai SMCE (Small and Micro Community Enterprise) in the OTOP (One Thumbon One Product) project were evaluated. Four types of Namprik product include chili paste for curry cooking, fried chili paste, {{ready to eat}} moist chili paste and ready to eat dried chili paste were sampled and analyzed especially for food safety purpose. Laboratory results show that aw (water activity number) of the ready to eat dried chili paste was the lowest at 0. 58 which fungi, anhydrous tolerance type, {{will be able to}} survive and aw of chili paste for curry cooking was the highest at 0. 96 which most of the putrefactive bacteria would remain alive and cause product deterioration problem later. From microbial analysis results, most of Namprik products were considered as good microbial quality products except for some of them still having spoilage problems caused by yeast and mould. However the amount of antimicrobial agent, Sodium Benzoate, in the products were found in the quantity of about 3 times exceeds the regulation limit of allowable antimicrobial agent utilization in food. The recommendations of good anufacturing practice were on-site conducted to Namprik producers by the project team in order to improve both production technique and production place sanitation. Packaging, include graphic design, of Namprik product especially for the ready to eat dried chili paste was also developed. Four-side seal package prototypes 7 x 10 cm. were made from three different types of plastic film include OPP/CPP, OPP/MCPP and PET/CPP and 12 grams of product was filled incorporated with two different head space gas filling, air and Nitrogen.
