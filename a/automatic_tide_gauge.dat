40|$|The {{location}} of <b>tide</b> <b>gauges</b> is not random. If their locations are positively (negatively) correlated with SLR, estimates of global SLR will be biased upwards (downwards). We {{show that the}} {{location of}} <b>tide</b> <b>gauges</b> in 2000 is independent of SLR as measured by satellite altimetry. Therefore PSMSL <b>tide</b> <b>gauges</b> constitute a quasi-random sample and inferences of SLR based on them are unbiased, {{and there is no}} need for data reconstructions. By contrast, <b>tide</b> <b>gauges</b> dating back to the 19 th century were located where sea levels happened to be rising. Data reconstructions based on these <b>tide</b> <b>gauges</b> are therefore likely to over-estimate sea level rise. We therefore study individual <b>tide</b> <b>gauge</b> data on sea levels from the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) during 1807 – 2010 without recourse to data reconstruction. Although mean sea levels are rising by 1 mm/year, sea level rise is local rather than global, and is concentrated in the Baltic and Adriatic seas, South East Asia and the Atlantic coast of the United States. In these locations, covering 35 percent of <b>tide</b> <b>gauges,</b> sea levels rose on average by 3. 8 mm/year. Sea levels were stable in locations covered by 61 percent of <b>tide</b> <b>gauges,</b> and sea levels fell in locations covered by 4 percent of <b>tide</b> <b>gauges.</b> In these locations sea levels fell on average by almost 6 mm/year.

40|$|<b>Tide</b> <b>gauge</b> data provide {{information}} on sea level variations {{as well as on}} the vertical land movements at <b>tide</b> <b>gauges.</b> It is also useful for geoid modelling in coastal regions. Sea level records from a number of <b>tide</b> <b>gauges</b> in the Baltic Sea were analysed in the framework of the project on a cm geoid in Poland. Data from each <b>tide</b> <b>gauge</b> has been expressed as a sum of four components: a <b>tide</b> <b>gauge</b> constant, a linear trend, a regional component and a local component. The regional component represents the variations of sea level that are common for all <b>tide</b> <b>gauges.</b> The local component consists of local systematic effects, signal and a noise that are, however not clearly separated in the present analysis. <b>Tide</b> <b>gauge</b> data with monthly resolution was first de-trended and then averaged over a chosen sample of sites resulting in the determination of regional component. Correlations between regional component and individual site data were investigated. High level of correlations obtained indicates strong common features in <b>tide</b> <b>gauge</b> records. It proves the adequacy of the model used in the present analysis. The regional component was used for recursive determination of trend and the local component at each site.

In order to evaluate the GNSS-derived sea level in a more qualitative way, the Van de Casteele test was used (see e.g., [35]). The Van de Casteele test is a simple diagram based on simultaneous sea level height measurements from a reference <b>tide</b> <b>gauge</b> (here the pressure <b>tide</b> <b>gauge)</b> and from a <b>tide</b> <b>gauge</b> to be tested (here the GNSS <b>tide</b> <b>gauge).</b> Sea level height is presented along the y-axis of the diagram, and the <b>tide</b> <b>gauge</b> error, i.e., the difference in sea level height between the two sea level records, is presented along the x-axis of the diagram. From the shape of the Van de Casteele diagram, it is possible to easily understand whether systematic errors exist.|$|R

40|$|Our {{goal is to}} {{determine}} vertical crustal movement rates from <b>tide</b> <b>gauge</b> and satellite altimetry measurements. <b>Tide</b> <b>gauges</b> measure sea level, but as they are fixed to the crust, they sense both sea surface height variations and vertical crustal movements. The differential sea level rates of sufficiently nearby stations are a good means {{to determine}} differential crustal movement rates, when sea level height variations can be assumed to be homogeneous. Satellite altimetric measurements determine sea surface height variations directly {{and can be used}} to separate the crustal signal from the sea surface height variations in <b>tide</b> <b>gauge</b> measurements. The correction of the <b>tide</b> <b>gauge</b> sea level rates for the sea surface height contribution requires collocation of the satellite pass and the <b>tide</b> <b>gauge</b> station. We show that even if this is not the case, the satellite altimetric observations enable correction of differential <b>tide</b> <b>gauge</b> rates for the effects of sea surface rate inhomogeneities. We apply the methodology to an area of broad scientific interest, due to its high seismic risk and its location as standpoint for a proposed major bridge connecting Sicily to the Italian mainland. We find that the Southern Calabria and the eastern Sicily <b>tide</b> <b>gauges</b> have a deficit in sea level increase of 1 - 2 mm/yr with respect to the north western Sicilian <b>tide</b> <b>gauge.</b> The satellite altimetric observations show that this differential movement must be caused by a tectonic component, because the sea surface rates are higher offshore eastern Sicily compared to offshore western Sicily. The satellite altimetric rates show that the sea surface rates are inhomogeneous in the Mediterranean and have larger amplitudes as we move away from the coast than immediately offshore. Our technique can be applied to any part of the world where <b>tide</b> <b>gauge</b> observations are available, because satellite altimetric observations are global...|$|R
40|$|The {{combination}} of <b>tide</b> <b>gauges</b> with high-precision (space-geodetic) measurements of vertical displacements of the crust and associated absolute gravity changes provide valuable con-straints for observations and models {{of changes in}} nearby ice loads. In particular, geodetic observations at <b>tide</b> <b>gauges</b> in the Arctic are of high potential value for global change stud-ies. A preliminary analysis of the available Arctic <b>tide</b> <b>gauge</b> data indicates a spatial pattern in sea level consistent with sig-nificant changes in the ice cover on Greenland and the larger ones of the Arctic islands. However, {{due to lack of}} data on crustal motion, ambiguities remain in the separation of geo-centric crustal motion and geocentric sea levels as well as the attribution of the observed trends to past or present changes in the ice loads. It is proposed to co-located several long-operating Arctic <b>tide</b> <b>gauges</b> with continuously recording GPS, to per-form absolute gravity measurements at these selected <b>tide</b> <b>gauges,</b> and to connect all Arctic <b>tide</b> <b>gauges</b> to a geocentric datum. It is expected that these observations will allow to re-duce the uncertainty of the geocentric crustal motion and thus provide a better estimate of the geocentric sea-level trends at these <b>tide</b> <b>gauges.</b> The resulting trends will constitute valuable constraints for changes in the Arctic cryosphere. Moreover, the proposed measurements will also provide new constraints on the present-day tectonical motion of the Arctic crust. ...|$|R
40|$|Trends in {{relative}} sea level as {{recorded by the}} large number of coastal <b>tide</b> <b>gauges</b> are used to derive new constraints on trends in the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets on century time scales. Based on the sea-level equation, which describes the spatial pattern of sea-level changes due to changes in the ice masses, for each ice sheet the finger-print function for a constant trend is derived. These finger-print functions are used to determined the best-fit trends from the <b>tide</b> <b>gauge</b> trends. A fit to all <b>tide</b> <b>gauge</b> trends excluding only those with unreasonably large values indicates negative rates of approximately - 50 mm/yr for the Antarctic ice sheet and - 50 to - 100 mm/yr for the Greenland ice sheet, with the latter strongly depending on the model used to predict the post-glacial signal. However, excluding <b>tide</b> <b>gauge</b> trends from lower latitudes, the fit results in positive trends for both the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. This high sensitivity of the inversion to a zonal selection of <b>tide</b> <b>gauges</b> indicates that the <b>tide</b> <b>gauge</b> trends may be contaminated by a latitude-dependent steric effect due to zonal warming of the ocean water...|$|R

40|$|A {{continuous}} monitoring of sea level changes is im-portant for human society since more than 50 % of the world’s population live within 60 km of the coast.

40|$|The Italian {{peninsula}} {{with its}} islands is tectonically active {{to the effect}} that the entire territory is exposed to high natural hazard due to earthquakes and volcanoes. The tectonic activity leads to vertical motions that affect the coastlines. <b>Tide</b> <b>gauges</b> measure the relative motion between the coastline and the sea surface. A measured increase in sea level is therefore the sum of sea level rise and crustal subsidence. If the goal of the observations is measuring the vertical crustal motions, the sea level rate must be subtracted. Satellite altimetry gives an independent measurement of the sea surface rise. Due to interannual variability of sea level change, the time series of <b>tide</b> <b>gauges</b> and satellite altimetry must be at least 10 years long and contemporaneous. The observations of the satellite missions ERS, Topex/Poseidon and Jason and the <b>tide</b> <b>gauges</b> of the Italian <b>tide</b> <b>gauge</b> network meet this criterion (Fenoglio Marc et al., 2012). For southern Italy the <b>tide</b> <b>gauges</b> are analyzed statistically among each other to obtain the relative sea level rise variations along the coast (Braitenberg et al., 2010).

40|$|Near-global and {{continuous}} measurements from satellite altimetry have provided accurate estimates of global {{mean sea level}} {{in the past two}} decades. Extending these estimates further into the past is a challenge using the historical <b>tide</b> <b>gauge</b> records. Not only is sampling nonuniform in both space and time, but <b>tide</b> <b>gauges</b> are also affected by vertical land motion (VLM) that creates a relative sea level change not representative of ocean variability. To allow for comparisons to the satellite altimetry estimated global mean sea level (GMSL), typically the <b>tide</b> <b>gauges</b> are corrected using glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) models. This approach, however, does not correct other sources of VLM that remain in the <b>tide</b> <b>gauge</b> record. Here we compare Global Positioning System (GPS) VLM estimates at the <b>tide</b> <b>gauge</b> locations to VLM estimates from GIA models, and assess the influence of non-GIA-related VLM on GMSL estimates.

While this result is likely dependent on the subset of <b>tide</b> <b>gauges</b> used and the actual corrections used, it does suggest that non-GIA VLM plays a significant role in twentieth century estimates of GMSL.
