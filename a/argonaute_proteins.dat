5|$|Although animals {{generally}} express fewer {{variants of}} the dicer enzyme than plants, RNAi in some animals produces an antiviral response. In both juvenile and adult Drosophila, RNA interference {{is important in}} antiviral innate immunity and is active against pathogens such as Drosophila X virus. A similar role in immunity may operate in C. elegans, as <b>argonaute</b> <b>proteins</b> are upregulated in response to viruses and worms that overexpress components of the RNAi pathway are resistant to viral infection.|$|E
5|$|It is not {{understood}} how the activated RISC complex locates complementary mRNAs within the cell. Although the cleavage {{process has been}} proposed {{to be linked to}} translation, translation of the mRNA target is not essential for RNAi-mediated degradation. Indeed, RNAi may be more effective against mRNA targets that are not translated. <b>Argonaute</b> <b>proteins</b> are localized to specific regions in the cytoplasm called P-bodies (also cytoplasmic bodies or GW bodies), which are regions with high rates of mRNA decay; miRNA activity is also clustered in P-bodies. Disruption of P-bodies decreases the efficiency of RNA interference, suggesting that they are a critical site in the RNAi process.|$|E
5|$|The active {{components}} of an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) are endonucleases called <b>argonaute</b> <b>proteins,</b> which cleave the target mRNA strand complementary to their bound siRNA. As the fragments produced by dicer are double-stranded, they could each in theory produce a functional siRNA. However, {{only one of}} the two strands, which is known as the guide strand, binds the argonaute protein and directs gene silencing. The other anti-guide strand or passenger strand is degraded during RISC activation. Although it was first believed that an ATP-dependent helicase separated these two strands, the process proved to be ATP-independent and performed directly by the protein components of RISC. However, an in vitro kinetic analysis of RNAi in the presence and absence of ATP showed that ATP may be required to unwind and remove the cleaved mRNA strand from the RISC complex after catalysis. The guide strand tends to be the one whose 5' end is less stably paired to its complement, but strand selection is unaffected by the direction in which dicer cleaves the dsRNA before RISC incorporation. Instead, the R2D2 protein may serve as the differentiating factor by binding the more-stable 5' end of the passenger strand.|$|E

25|$|Sometimes {{cleavage}} of {{the target}} mRNA molecule does not occur. In some cases, the endonucleolytic cleavage of the phosphodiester backbone may be suppressed by mismatches of siRNA and target mRNA near the cleaving site. Other times, the <b>Argonaute</b> <b>proteins</b> of the RISC lack endonuclease activity even when the target mRNA and siRNA are perfectly paired. In such cases, gene expression will be silenced by miRNA induced mechanism instead.|$|E
25|$|Members of the Argonaute (Ago) protein {{family are}} central to RISC function. Argonautes are needed for miRNA-induced {{silencing}} and contain two conserved RNA binding domains: a PAZ domain that can bind the single stranded 3' end of the mature miRNA and a PIWI domain that structurally resembles ribonuclease-H and functions {{to interact with the}} 5' end of the guide strand. They bind the mature miRNA and orient it for interaction with a target mRNA. Some argonautes, for example human Ago2, cleave target transcripts directly; argonautes may also recruit additional proteins to achieve translational repression. The human genome encodes eight <b>argonaute</b> <b>proteins</b> divided by sequence similarities into two families: AGO (with four members present in all mammalian cells and called E1F2C/hAgo in humans), and PIWI (found in the germ line and hematopoietic stem cells).|$|E
25|$|The siRNA induced post {{transcriptional}} {{gene silencing}} starts with the assembly of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The complex silences certain gene expression by cleaving the mRNA molecules coding the target genes. To begin the process, {{one of the two}} siRNA strands, the guide strand, will be loaded into the RISC while the other strand, the passenger strand, is degraded. Certain Dicer enzymes may be responsible of loading the guide strand into RISC. Then, the siRNA scans for and direct RISC to perfectly complementary sequence on the mRNA molecules. The cleavage of the mRNA molecules is thought to be catalyzed by the Piwi domain of <b>Argonaute</b> <b>proteins</b> of the RISC. The mRNA molecule is then cut precisely by cleaving the phosphodiester bond between the target nucleotides which are paired to siRNA residues 10 and 11, counting from the 5’end. This cleavage results in mRNA fragments that are further degraded by cellular exonucleases. The 5’ fragment is degraded from its 3’ end by exosome while the 3’ fragment is degraded from its 5’ end by 5' -3' exoribonuclease 1(XRN1). Dissociation of the target mRNA strand from RISC after the cleavage allow more mRNA to be silenced. This dissociation process is likely to be promoted by extrinsic factors driven by ATP hydrolysis.|$|E

40|$|Members of the <b>Argonaute</b> <b>protein</b> {{family have}} been linked through a {{combination}} of genetic and biochemical studies to RNA interference (RNAi) and related phenomena. Here, we describe the characterization of the first <b>Argonaute</b> <b>protein</b> (AGO 1) in Trypanosoma brucei, the earliest divergent eukaryote where RNAi has been described so far. AGO 1 is predominantly cytoplasmic and is found in a ribonucleoprotein particle with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and this particle is present in a soluble form, as well as associated with polyribosomes. A genetic knockout of AGO 1 leads to a loss of RNAi, and concomitantly, endogenous retroposon-derived siRNAs as well as siRNAs derived from transgenic double-stranded RNA are reduced to almost undetectable levels. Furthermore, AGO 1 deficiency leads to an increase in retroposon transcript abundance via mechanisms operating at the transcriptional level and at the RNA stability level. Our results suggest that AGO 1 function is required for production and/or stabilization of siRNAs and provide the first evidence for an <b>Argonaute</b> <b>protein</b> being involved in the regulation of retroposon transcript levels...|$|R

A single transcript of TgAgo was identified to have 2, 232 nucleotides encompassing 5 exons. Protein immunoblot assay showed a single protein of ~ 58. 5 kDa. Gene silencing assays demonstrated that knockout of argonaute expression (AGOKO) reduced the gene silencing ability of an RNAi-like mechanisms in T. gondii, suggesting the importance of TgAgo in post transcriptional gene regulation pathways. T. gondii growth pattern was unaffected by the removal of Ago expression. However, bradyzoite formation was increased in AGOKO strains. The study suggests that TgAgo is a vital component of bradyzoite formation in the life cycle of T. gondii...|$|R

5|$|The {{structural}} {{basis for}} binding of RNA to the <b>argonaute</b> <b>protein</b> was examined by X-ray crystallography of the binding domain of an RNA-bound <b>argonaute</b> <b>protein.</b> Here, the phosphorylated 5' {{end of the}} RNA strand enters a conserved basic surface pocket and makes contacts through a divalent cation (an atom with two positive charges) such as magnesium and by aromatic stacking (a process that allows more than one atom to share an electron by passing it back and forth) between the 5' nucleotide in the siRNA and a conserved tyrosine residue. This site is thought to form a nucleation site for the binding of the siRNA to its mRNA target. Analysis of the inhibitory effect of mismatches in either the 5’ or 3’ end of the guide strand has demonstrated that the 5’ end of the guide strand is likely responsible for matching and binding the target mRNA, while the 3’ end is responsible for physically arranging target mRNA into a cleavage-favorable RISC region.|$|R
