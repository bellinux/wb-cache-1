500|$|In April 2015, Ruffalo said Universal {{holding the}} {{distribution}} rights to Hulk films {{may be an}} obstacle to releasing a future Hulk standalone film, and reiterated this in October 2015, and July 2017.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, a potential reason why Marvel has not reacquired the film distribution rights to the Hulk as they did with Paramount Pictures for the Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America films is because Universal holds the theme park rights to several Marvel characters that Marvel's parent company Disney wants for its own theme parks. In December, Ruffalo stated that the strained relationship between Marvel and Universal may be another obstacle to releasing a future standalone Hulk film.

The Heart was originally designed {{as a method of}} identifying assassination targets using vibration and sound mechanics. The design then developed into the concept of the Heart speaking and feeling alive and having its own agenda. As a result of player-conducted testing of the game, the designers decided that a more direct navigation system was required. The Heart's gameplay role continued to change, and it continued to provide narration on its perceptions of different characters, which helped to reinforce the narrative themes and to differentiate the city's social classes in a more subtle alternative to having the characters provide expository dialogue. Colantonio and Smith were concerned that optional use of the Heart would result in some players missing the information it provides, but they considered that it was a part of giving the player the freedom to choose how to play.|$|E

Here, we present evidence that TIFA (TRAF-interacting protein with a forkhead-associated domain, also known as T 2 BP) activates IKK by promoting the oligomerization and Ub ligase activity of TRAF 6. We show that recombinant TIFA protein, but not TRAF 6 -binding-defective mutant, can activate IKK in crude cytosolic extracts. Furthermore, TIFA activates IKK in an in vitro reconstitution system consisting of purified proteins, including TRAF 6, the TAK 1 kinase complex, and Ub-conjugating enzyme complex Ubc 13 –Uev 1 A. Interestingly, a fraction of recombinant TIFA protein exists as high-molecular-weight oligomers, and only these oligomeric forms of TIFA can activate IKK. Importantly, TIFA induces the oligomerization and polyubiquitination of TRAF 6, which leads to the activation of TAK 1 and IKK through a proteasome-independent mechanism...|$|R

Modification of these sites to arginine dramatically reduces ubiquitination of XIAP, but has no measurable effect on the ability of ectopically expressed IAP to rescue cells from two independent apoptotic inducers.
