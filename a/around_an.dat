5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 19, accompanied with spiral bands of convection <b>around</b> <b>an</b> area of low pressure. A large circulation quickly developed once it reached the Atlantic Ocean, and the system organized into Tropical Depression Four late on August 19 while located 345mi (555km) southeast of Cape Verde. Initial forecasts predicted for great intensification, including one forecast for the depression to strengthen to a hurricane within three days. However, the depression remained disorganized, and slowly intensified to attain tropical storm status on August 22.|$|E

5|$|From about 700 BCE iron working reached north Britain. There is {{evidence}} for about 1,000 Iron Age hillforts in Scotland, most located below the Clyde-Forth line.

They {{appear to have been}} largely abandoned in the Roman period, both in the occupied region and further north in the regions beyond Roman control. This may have been because of the threat posed by Roman incursions, which meant that concentrations of military and political force were vulnerable to incursions and siege. Archaeological evidence indicates that some were reoccupied after their departure.|$|E

5|$|It was Dufourny's {{great friend}} and fellow {{architect}} Giuseppe Marvuglia who was to preside over the gradual decline of Sicilian Baroque. In 1784 he designed the Palazzo Riso-Belmonte, the finest example of this period of architectural transition, combining both Baroque and Palladian motifs, built <b>around</b> <b>an</b> arcaded courtyard providing Baroque masses of light and shade, or chiaroscuro. The main façade, punctuated by giant pilasters, also had Baroque features, but the skyline was unbroken. The pilasters were undecorated, simple, and Ionic, and supported an undecorated entablature. Above the windows were classical unbroken pediments. Sicilian Baroque was waning.|$|E
5|$|Late on September 12, while {{approaching}} the northern Lesser Antilles, convection increased and became better organized <b>around</b> <b>an</b> area of increased cyclonic turning.

Late on September 13, with the formation of a broad low-level circulation, it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Eleven about 70mi (110km) east-southeast of Guadeloupe.|$|E
