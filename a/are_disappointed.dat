5|$|September 16, 1903– A {{hurricane}} makes landfall on Atlantic City as an 80mph (129km/h) hurricane, {{making it}} the most recent (until 2011) hurricane to directly strike the state. Dubbed by the Atlantic City Press as the Vagabond Hurricane, the storm gathers media interest from Philadelphia and New York, with one newspaper offering $200,000 (1903USD) to aid the survivors. When the reporters arrive at the coast, they <b>are</b> <b>disappointed</b> {{at the lack of}} damage, which is confined to loose boards along the boardwalk. The storm's strong surf destroys several boats along the coastline, including 34 in Waretown.|$|E

500|$|Throughout {{the summer}} of 2003, Arsenal gave fans the {{opportunity}} to register their interest in a relaunched bond scheme. The club planned to issue 3,000 bonds for between £3,500 and £5,000 each for a season ticket at Highbury, then at Ashburton Grove. Supporters reacted negatively to the news; AISA chairman Steven Powell said in a statement: [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>disappointed</b> that the club has not consulted supporters before announcing a new bond scheme." [...] Though Arsenal never stated how many bonds were sold, they did raise several million pounds through the scheme. The club also extended its contract with sportswear provider Nike, in a deal worth [...] £55million over seven years. Nike paid a minimum of £1million each year as a royalty payment, contingent on sales.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{review of}} the {{painting}} shows that some practitioners of particular faiths <b>are</b> <b>disappointed</b> by the acceptance of all faiths expressed in Freedom of Religion. Claridge feels that the tight amalgam of faces... and even the crepey skin on elderly hands, which have become the objects of worship, push the theme over the edge from idealistic tolerance into gooey sentiment, where human differences seem {{caught up in a}} magical moment of dispensation from the Light. The restraint demanded by art that deals with heightened emotion is lacking. Claridge stated that the earlier version was [...] "clean, impressively sparse, in counterpoise to a dense narrative content. Beautifully painted even at the preliminary oil sketch stage." [...] Murray and McCabe note that the work is a divergence from the [...] "storytelling style" [...] that Rockwell is known for.|$|E

Blaine (Darren Criss) performs [...] "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' to demonstrate his suggested number. However, he mentions this possibility to Sebastian Smythe (Grant Gustin), the new captain of the Dalton Academy Warblers and a Regionals competitor, and Sebastian later announces that the Warblers, who will be performing first, will also be doing Jackson's music. New Directions challenges the Warblers {{for the right to}} perform Jackson, and they meet in a parking garage at night and compete to [...] "Bad". At the end of the number, Sebastian throws a slushie at Kurt (Chris Colfer) but Blaine interposes himself: he is hit in the face and badly injured.|$|E
500|$|Reception for {{the movie}} was {{generally}} poor. Variety calls it [...] "tepid" [...] and suggests that Alves [...] "fails to linger long enough on the Great White." [...] It has a 12% 'rotten' rating at Rotten Tomatoes. The 3D was criticized as being a gimmick to attract audiences to the aging series and for being ineffective. Allrovi, however, says that [...] "the suspense sequences were made somewhat more memorable during the film's original release with 3D photography, an attribute lost on video, thereby removing the most distinctive element of an otherwise run-of-the-mill sequel." [...] Derek Winnert says that [...] "with Richard Matheson's name on the script you'd expect a better yarn" [...] although he continues {{to say that the}} film [...] "is entirely watchable with a big pack of popcorn." [...] Others <b>are</b> <b>disappointed</b> that Matheson and Gottlieb produced this script given their previous success.|$|E

[...] He credited the club for their conditioning programme but also attributed the good form to casual drinking: [...] "I always have two pints of Guinness on a Friday, sometimes more. It gives me energy, I feel stronger and believe in it." [...] His manager Flynn admitted Thomas [...] "trains when he wants to train," [...] and added: [...] "I will take whatever he's taking to keep him going. And if he was 10 years younger I'd be able to sell him for £5m." [...] Days after the win, Thomas was charged by North Wales Police for his involvement in a counterfeit currency scam. He was arrested a year later, and following a trial was sentenced to 18 months in jail.|$|E

500|$|Homer {{takes his}} children, Bart and Lisa, to {{a video game}} {{convention}} for another fun Saturday. Upon their return home, Marge feels upset that Homer gets to be the [...] "fun dad", while she is stuck doing unexciting things with the children. Next Saturday, she decides to take Bart and Lisa to an [...] "X-Games" [...] convention, thinking it will be something fun. However, when they arrive, they <b>are</b> <b>disappointed</b> {{to find out that}} it is a Christian event, and the actual name of the convention is [...] "† Games". The car engine dies on the way back and they are forced to stop in the neighborhood of Little Ethiopia, where the three go into a restaurant serving Ethiopian food. Although initially averse to the exotic food, Marge is reminded that she wants to be a fun mom and therefore asks for the most authentic dish on the menu for her and her children. All three of them enjoy the food. At the restaurant, Marge, Bart, and Lisa bump into a group of foodies, who encourage them to start their own food blog, [...] "The Three Mouthketeers". The blog quickly becomes popular and the three spend much time together trying out new food and writing about it. This leaves Homer feeling left out and sad.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{handling}} of ground combat {{received the most}} substantial criticism. Computer Gaming World's editorial staff wrote that the game's real-time combat system was [...] "handled so fast that players didn't have a chance in 90% of the battles." [...] According to reviewer L.S. Lichtmann, [...] "many <b>are</b> <b>disappointed</b> because the phased, tactical system of Traveller has been modified to have arcade game characteristics." [...] He also stated that the player does not compete on a [...] "level playing field" [...] {{when he or she}} must issue commands in real-time to individual party members engaged in combat while the computer simultaneously controls multiple non-player characters. Paragon responded to these criticisms by releasing an updated version of the game which gave the player the ability to pause the combat to issue orders to party members. But even after this update, some reviewers still found that, whenever possible, it is still far easier for the party to flee from ground combat situations than to fight. Moreover, immediately after the player assumes control of the party {{at the start of the}} game, it is attacked by well-armed opponents. The Computer Gaming World editorial staff criticized this design choice by stating that the [...] "player would have to run away from the first encounter or be killed within two minutes of spending 30 minutes to an hour generating a character." ...|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "Fool in Love" [...] is a rhapsodic ballad, which {{incorporates}} acoustic {{and electric}} guitars, synthesizers and drums. Lyrically, Rihanna tells {{of how she}} has met a relatively good man who her parents do not approve of, but requests that they accept her decision {{to be with him}} due to their love for each other, despite familial concerns. Rihanna insists that she is in love, singing [...] "Papa he's quite a man, he adores me/ He's my biggest fan." [...] She then claims that he has taken a hold over her, singing [...] "We're too far down the hole/ He's got a hold on my soul." [...] Rihanna's vocal performance in the song was described as the singer's [...] "biggest ornamented" [...] song by Robert Everett-Green of The Globe and Mail, as well as noting that the singer emotes a sense of fatality in her vocals during the bass sequences in the song. [...] "Fool in Love" [...] displays Rihanna emoting a vulnerable style of singing, due to the lyrical content and mood in the song, which can be heard in the lyrics [...] "Papa, are you ashamed of how your little girl turned out?" [...] due to how the singer feels as though her parents <b>are</b> <b>disappointed</b> in her choice of man. Robert Copsey for Digital Spy commented that Rihanna appeared to be channelling Madonna on the song.|$|E

500|$|Myrie-Williams joined League Two side Port Vale on loan on 24 November, {{joining the}} club until January 2012. A day later, on 25 November, {{he made his}} debut for Port Vale in a 0–0 home draw against Torquay United, playing the whole match. During the game, he {{impressed}} manager Micky Adams— [...] "He (Myrie-Williams) lifted me, as I'm asking people to be positive and show character, because the fans <b>are</b> <b>disappointed</b> {{with the way things}} have gone recently, and we need to give them something to shout about, which I believe he did. I thought he was outstanding, he looked exciting on the ball and he got crosses into the box". In his next appearance for the club, he scored the equalising goal in a 2–1 win at Dagenham & Redbridge, when he [...] "blasted in" [...] a [...] "25-yard blockbuster"– fellow Stevenage loanee Madjo went on to score the winning goal. Myrie-Williams' effort was Vale's first goal in 502 minutes (more than five games) of football. He won a penalty in his fourth game for the club, which was converted by Marc Richards to give Vale a 2–1 win at Hereford United. He returned to Broadhall Way in January having scored one goal in six games for Port Vale, who were unable to extend the loan deal due to an acute lack of funds.|$|E
500|$|The OdioWorks {{case was}} one of the first {{high-profile}} cases illustrating Apple's attempts to employ federal police power in its litigation practices by invoking the anti-circumvention provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) as a means of shielding its intellectual property from reverse engineering. In November 2008, Apple sent a cease-and-desist letter to BluWiki, a non-commercial wiki provider, alleging BluWiki infringed Apple's copyrights in publishing a discussion of how to make the latest iPods interoperate with other software and that, by so doing, violated the DMCA. [...] In April 2009, OdioWorks, the operators of BluWiki, backed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), defensively sued Apple seeking a declaration of non-infringement and non-circumvention. In July 2009, Apple ceased claiming infringement, stating it was [...] "withdrawing [...] takedown notifications" [...] and that [...] "Apple no longer has, nor will it have in the future, any objection to the publication of the itunesDB Pages which are the subject of the OdioWorks complaint". After Apple withdrew its complaint and cited code obsolescence as a contributing factor in its decision to withdraw, BluWiki then republished its discussion of the issue. The EFF noted, [...] "While we are glad that Apple retracted its baseless legal threats, we <b>are</b> <b>disappointed</b> that it only came after 7 months of censorship and a lawsuit".|$|E
500|$|The {{students}} at South Park Elementary {{are assigned to}} read The Catcher in the Rye, and (especially the four main boys) grow excited when Mr. Garrison tells them that the book has caused so much controversy, it has been banned from {{public schools in the}} past. However, after reading the book, Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny <b>are</b> <b>disappointed</b> to find the content completely inoffensive, and feel the school has [...] "tricked" [...] them into reading. They decide to write their own offensive novel, The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs (which they originally called The Tale of Scrotie McDickinass), with the intention of disgusting as many people as possible. Later, Stan's parents find the first draft and read it. They find it so disgusting that they repeatedly vomit while reading. However, they both absolutely loved the book. In fear that they will get into trouble for the book's content, Stan and the boys trick Butters into thinking that he actually wrote the book. Butters believes them because ever since reading The Catcher in the Rye, he feels as though he has been entering into [...] "altered states of consciousness" [...] that make him want to kill John Lennon, before he finds out (from his father) that Lennon is already dead ("Dangit!"). Later on, after learning that The Catcher in the Rye also inspired someone to shoot Ronald Reagan, Butters at first goes out to kill him too but is told that he is dead as well, much to his dismay.|$|E
