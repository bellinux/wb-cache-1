They were removed and new stairways were rebuilt inside of an entrance enclosure in the late 1880s. The stained glass windows in the west facade were installed sometime before 1910. In the early 1950s the building was heavily renovated with the original pews being replaced and pine floor was covered with <b>asphalt</b> <b>tiles.</b> The interior of the assembly hall was completely redecorated. The original hand-stenciled ceiling painting was covered over with acoustical tile, the organ casework of dark-stained quarter-sawn oak was painted over with [...] "blond" [...] finish and all other furnishings were changed in accordance with the style of the day.|$|E

During this time, there were men working on building the Rectory, but since there was much snow, they could not return to their work on the Rectory until spring. Nicholas Givens had donated a large quantity of marble for the basement, so they began work on the basement. The workers covered the ground with black <b>asphalt</b> <b>tile</b> and the walls and pillars with white Carrara marble.

The analysis done was about the actual information, the technical paving solutions, the use of geo-textiles, and the availability of those according to the economic possibility. The study takes in consideration the use of different riding surfaces, such as <b>asphalt,</b> concrete <b>tiles,</b> and hydraulic concrete slabs, all of them with their respective design of thicknesses to have comparative parameters. The done labor in the gathering of information and data has been arduous because there is almost no information in the country about such topics. Therefore, to obtain data and documents it was necessary to look for experts on the topic and to use documentation from Colombia and Chile. From the obtained results, drawn in the charts, one can see directly the selective application according to the parameters to use. In conclusion, generally there is a few or no national documentation that can be applied to the studied topic.

40|$|The {{reflectance}} of {{a surface}} usually {{depends on the}} angles, at which the surface is illuminated and viewed. The dependence can be described by the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function BRDF. In this study, the BRDFs of several samples typically found in urban areas (roof <b>tiles,</b> <b>asphalt,</b> etc.) were measured at the European Goniometric Facility EGO in Ispra, Italy with hyperspectral sensors. The basic characteristics of the measured BRDFs are a specular peak, an increase in backscattering direction for the roughest surfaces and a constant diffuse component for the surfaces of moderate roughness. Surfaces of moderate roughness can be well described by the BRDF model for specular reflection of rough surfaces by (Torrance & Sparrow 1967), whereas for very rough surfaces the model by (Oren & Nayar 1995) is more appropriate. Surface topography measurements suggest {{that the size of}} the scattering structure is in the 20 m range. In reflectance terminology, the principal plane is th [...] ...|$|R

40|$|There is {{an urgent}} {{requirement}} {{to examine the}} quality of harvested rainwater for potable and non-potable purposes, based {{on the type of}} roofing material. In this study, we examined the effect on the quality of harvested rainwater of conventional roofing materials (concrete, <b>asphalt</b> and ceramic <b>tile</b> roofs) compared with alternative roofing materials (green roof). The results showed that the ceramic tile roof was the most suitable for rainwater-harvesting applications because of the lower concentrations of leachable pollutants. However, in this study, the green roof was not suitable for rainwater harvesting applications. In addition, seasonal trends in water quality parameters showed that pollutants in roof runoff in summer and autumn were lower than those in winter and spring. This study revealed that the quality of harvested rainwater was significantly affected by the roofing material; therefore, local government and urban planners should develop stricter testing programs and produce more weathering resistant roofing materials to allow the harvesting of rainwater for domestic and public uses.

40|$|A {{process for}} {{stabilizing}} organics-containing waste materials and recovery metals therefrom, and a waste glass product made {{according to the}} process are described. Vitrification of wastes such as organic ion exchange resins, electronic components and the like {{can be accomplished by}} mixing at least one transition metal oxide with the wastes, and, if needed, glass formers to compensate for a shortage of silicates or other glass formers in the wastes. The transition metal oxide increases the rate of oxidation of organic materials in the wastes to improve the composition of the glass-forming mixture: at low temperatures, the oxide catalyzes oxidation of a portion of the organics in the waste; at higher temperatures, the oxide dissolves and the resulting oxygen ions oxidize more of the organics; and at vitrification temperatures, the metal ions conduct oxygen into the melt to oxidize the remaining organics. In addition, the transition metal oxide buffers the redox potential of the glass melt so that metals such as Au, Pt, Ag, and Cu separate form the melt in the metallic state and can be recovered. After the metals are recovered, the remainder of the melt is allowed to cool and may subsequently be disposed of. The product has good leaching resistance and can be disposed of in an ordinary landfill, or, alternatively, used as a filler in materials such as concrete, <b>asphalt,</b> brick and <b>tile...</b>|$|R
40|$|Building Integrated Photo Voltaics (BIPVs) are devices {{which are}} {{manufactured}} to replace building components exposed to sufficient sunlight to generate energy. Photo Voltaic Roof tiles are Building Integrated components {{which can be}} used instead of traditional roofing materials. The following thesis is focused on comparing traditional, cheaper <b>asphalt</b> roof <b>tiles</b> with Photo Voltaic (PV) roofing tiles in terms of energy cost savings during their respective Net Present Values. The method used for achieving this is computer simulation made possible by software named "Solar Advisory Model" (SAM), developed by National Renewable Energy Laboratories (NREL), to simulate energy output and resultant energy costs saved. The simulations have been run on a prototype example of a model of a dwelling unit's roof area. The simulations have been repeated for 35 cities all over the U. S. A. for 5 different climatic zones on the same prototype example of the dwelling unit. Similarly, the roof area being laid with an array of PV roof tiles has been estimated for coverage by traditional asphalt roof shingles by using data from the RS Means construction costs data. The estimated costs associated with the asphalt roof area have been adjusted to a different set of 35 locations from the 5 climatic zones by using the location factor from RS Means. A statistical analysis was done to analyze the data, net present value of roofing materials being the dependent variable versus climatic zones and roofing material as the independent variables. The statistical model also included CDD (Cooling Degree Days) and HDD (Heating Degree Days) as co-variates. The results indicate that NPV (Net Present Value) of BIPV roof is significantly different from that of asphalt roof. Another statistical analysis was done to determine the effect of climatic zones on energy savings due to the use of BIPV roofing. Energy savings (in US$) was used as a dependent variable, and climatic zone as the independent variable. HDD AND CDD were also included in this model as co-variates. The results of this test indicate that both climatic zone and HDD have an effect on total energy savings...|$|R

This study takes place in Sri Lanka, there are three villages included in this project: Jambugaswatte, Janituspuraya and Thoppuwa. In Sri Lanka, sand serves as the main building material. It is used to make bricks, <b>tiles,</b> <b>asphalt</b> and concrete, therefore demanding a high market value. However, the over-extraction of sand comes along with significant environmental problems. These communities depend on the river in many ways and the health of the river directly corresponds {{to the health of the}} ecosystem as a whole.

40|$|Storm {{water is}} rain and melted snow that runs off, {{primarily}} from impervious surfaces. Future storm water management {{is facing the}} challenges of increased precipitation, asclimate changes, and increased areas of impervious surfaces due to the expansion anddensification of the cities. Impervious surfaces reduce the potential for water to infiltratein the ground leading to increased surface runoff and higher peak discharge. The runoff coefficient {{is closely related to}} the percentage of impervious surfaces andrepresents the maximum percentage of a catchment that can contribute to runoff. In thisstudy, the objective was to evaluate the weighted runoff coefficient for three differenturban types; apartment buildings, townhouses and residential areas and a comparisonbetween today and the 1970 `s was made. The runoff coefficient was determined by manual mapping of the different surface typesin each area based on data in the form of orthophotos and aerial photographs. The surfacetypes that were mapped were <b>asphalt,</b> permeable areas, <b>tiles,</b> sand/gravel and roof. Tiles and sand/gravel were the most difficult surface types to map. In order to see towhat extent these categories influenced the weighted runoff coefficient a sensitivityanalysis was carried out and the runoff coefficient based on surface type was changed indifferent scenarios. The results of the sensitivity analysis showed that the surface types tiles and sand/gravelhad little impact on the weighted runoff coefficient which in mainly due to the fact thatthe percentage of these surfaces types of the total area is small. The result of the study showed that the largest change in the runoff coefficient occurredin residential areas where the increase in the percentage of impervious surfaces causedby new roofs in the form of porches and garages and from paved or tiled driveways. Forapartment buildings and townhouses the change in the runoff coefficient was small andprobably within the margin of error.
