5|$|Another change {{under the}} second and third Qajar king was the Africanization of the motif. At this time, the lion was an African lion which had a longer mane <b>and</b> <b>bigger</b> body {{compared}} to the Persian lion.

The protruding bones are isolated <b>and</b> <b>bigger</b> on his left shoulder and arm, and appear crystalline. A pauldron covering his right shoulder is fastened to the jewel's support harness, and the armor on his legs incorporate a pair of greaves. He wears a fauld on his abdomen, and bandages wrap around his stomach. A mask covers his face and is {{held in place by}} two straps around his head.|$|E
5|$|As {{time went}} on, their props and stage {{equipment}} became increasingly sophisticated. When {{they started to}} fill stadium sized venues <b>and</b> <b>bigger,</b> they ran into {{the problem of the}} audience no longer being able to see them due to the increased seating capacity – this problem was especially clear in their free 2006 concert in Rio de Janeiro on the A Bigger Bang tour, which used over 500 lights, hundreds of speakers, and a video screen almost 13 metres in length. Due to the vast size of the beach which the Stones performed on (2.5km), sound systems had to be set up in a relay pattern {{down the length of the}} beach, in order to keep the sound in sync with music from the stage; for every 340 metres of beach, the sound had to be delayed an additional second.|$|E

5|$|Increasingly, {{however, the}} ice trade {{began to focus}} on {{supplying}} the growing cities on the east coast of the U.S. and the needs of businesses across the Midwest. The citizens of New York City and Philadelphia became huge consumers of ice during their long, hot summers, and additional ice was harvested from the Hudson River and Maine to fulfil the demand. Ice began to be used in refrigerator cars by the railroad industry, allowing the meat packing industry around Chicago and Cincinnati to slaughter cattle locally, sending dressed meat east for either the internal or overseas markets. Chilled refrigerator cars and ships created a national industry in vegetables and fruit that could previously only have been consumed locally. American and British fishermen began to preserve their catches in ice, allowing longer voyages <b>and</b> <b>bigger</b> catches, and the brewing industry became operational all-year around. As U.S. ice exports diminished after 1870, Norway became {{a major player in the}} international market, shipping large quantities of ice to England and Germany.|$|E
5|$|Refrigerated {{ships were}} also made {{possible}} {{through the ice}} trade, allowing perishable goods to be exported internationally, first from the U.S. and then from countries such as Argentina and Australia. Early ships had stored their chilled goods along with the main cargo of ice; the first ships to transport chilled meat to Britain, designed by Bate, adapted the railroad refrigerator cars, using ice {{at either end of}} the hold and a ventilation fan to keep the meat cool. An improved version, invented by James Craven, piped a brine solution through the ice and then the hold to keep the meat cool, and created a drier atmosphere in the hold, preserving the meat better. Natural ice was also used in fishing industries to preserve catches, initially in the eastern American fisheries. In 1858 the Grimsby fishing fleet began to take ice out to sea with them to preserve their catches; this allowed longer journeys <b>and</b> <b>bigger</b> catches, and the fishing industry became the biggest single user of ice in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Uncharted {{uses the}} Cell {{microprocessor}} to generate dozens of layered character animations to portray realistic expressions and fluid movements, which allow for responsive player control. The PlayStation 3's graphics processing unit, the RSX Reality Synthesizer, employed several functions to provide graphical details that helped immerse the player {{into the game}} world: lighting models, pixel shaders, dynamic real-time shadowing, and advanced water simulation. The new hardware allowed for processes which the team had never used in PlayStation 2 game development and required them to quickly familiarize with the new techniques; for example, parallel processing and pixel shaders. While Blu-ray afforded greater storage space, the team became concerned with running out of room several times—Uncharted used more <b>and</b> <b>bigger</b> textures than previous games, and included several languages on the disc. Gameplay elements requiring motion sensing, such as throwing grenades and walking across beams, were implemented {{to take advantage of}} the Sixaxis controller. A new PlayStation 3 controller, the DualShock 3, was unveiled at the 2007 Tokyo Game Show, and featured force feedback vibration. Uncharted was also on display at the show with demonstrations that implemented limited support for vibration.|$|E

40|$|The grazing {{management}} and cultural practices {{discussed in this}} NebGuide can make switchgrass <b>and</b> <b>big</b> bluestem high quality summer forage. Switchgrass <b>and</b> <b>big</b> bluestem are native warm-season grasses that can provide abundant, high-quality forage during summer. Switchgrass <b>and</b> <b>big</b> bluestem produce 70 to 80 percent of their growth after June 1 in Nebraska, while more than 75 percent of cool-season grass growth, such as bromegrass and bluegrass, occurs before June 1. Therefore, switchgrass <b>and</b> <b>big</b> bluestem can provide forage to graze after cool-season pastures have been utilized. However, switchgrass <b>and</b> <b>big</b> bluestem must be managed differently than cool-season grasses. Poor management will cause productivity and stand persistence to decline, and forage quality will be poor. Proper {{grazing management}} and cultural practices will optimize production, maintain a healthy plant community, and provide adequate forage quality...|$|R
