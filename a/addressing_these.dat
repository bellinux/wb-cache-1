In {{the field of}} injection moulding, troubleshooting is often performed by examining defective parts for specific defects and <b>addressing</b> <b>these</b> defects with {{the design of the}} mould or the characteristics of the process itself.

5|$|The village {{developed}} along Town Street, a school, {{chapel and}} church {{were built in}} the 19th century but after the land was acquired by Leeds Council in 1920 a large council housing estate was built on the flatter land to the south, completely changing the rural nature of the settlement. Early transport was provided by a tram line and the Leeds Ring Road was built to Middleton. After the colliery closed the area began to decline and by 2001, had areas of multiple deprivation and high levels of unemployment and anti-social behaviour. The Middleton Regeneration Board has been established with the remit of <b>addressing</b> <b>these</b> issues.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the many}} {{contentious}} {{issues facing the}} First Congress during its inaugural session was {{the issue of how}} to raise revenue for the federal government. There were both domestic and foreign Revolutionary War-related debts, as well as a trade imbalance with Great Britain that was crippling American industries and draining the nation of its currency. The first effort to begin <b>addressing</b> <b>these</b> issues resulted in the Tariff of 1789, authorizing the collection of duties on imported goods. Signed into law by the president on July 4, 1789, the act established the United States Customs Service and its ports of entry. One year later, the Revenue-Marine was established when Washington signed legislation authorizing construction of ten cutters to enforce federal tariff and trade laws and to prevent smuggling. Until Congress established the Navy Department in 1798, it served as the nation's only armed force afloat. Renamed a century later as the Revenue Cutter Service, it and the U.S. Life-Saving Service were merged in 1915 to form the United States Coast Guard.|$|E

25|$|Ricardo Quaresma's signing from Mourinho's old club Porto {{was viewed}} as a missing link in the Inter squad, but his play {{disappointed}} the club and led him to be loaned off to Chelsea midway through the season, ironically Mourinho's other former club.

Inter's lack of a creative playmaker, or trequartista, had been blamed for the Champions League failure.

While traditionally available from street sources, fraudulent identification and travel documents, of all types, are also readily available for sale via the Internet.

25|$|The fables in {{the third}} book, as well as others, do not {{strictly}} limit to matters of war and peace. Some present fables that demonstrate how different characters have different needs and motives, which is subjectively rational from each character's viewpoint, and that <b>addressing</b> <b>these</b> needs can empower peaceful relationships even if they start off in a different way. For example, in the fable The Old Man the Young Wife, the text relates a story wherein an old man marries a young woman from a penniless family. The young woman detests his appearance {{so much that she}} refuses to even look at him let alone consummate their marriage. One night, while she sleeps in the same bed with her back facing the old man, a thief enters their house. She is scared, turns over, and for security embraces the man. This thrills every limb of the old man. He feels grateful to the thief for making his young wife hold him at last. The aged man rises and profusely thanks the thief, requesting the intruder to take whatever he desires.|$|E
500|$|In December 1905, on the {{recommendation}} of King Leopold, he was appointed director of the Abir Congo Company. The Abir Rubber Company was the only company mentioned by name in a Congo Commission report, which reported: [...] "the imprisonment of women as hostages, flogging to excess, and various acts of brutality are not contested. It is the black spot on the history of Central African settlement." [...] Mohun was appointed to institute reforms <b>addressing</b> <b>these</b> practices. He enjoyed some success in this regard and also devoted much time to an attempt to exterminate the tsetse fly. [...] In 1906 successfully proposed that Leopold II buy out Abir and take the concession under direct control of the crown. [...] He appears to have left Abir around the same time and was, in March 1907, proposed by the Congo Free State government to assume the role of African manager for the American Congo Company.|$|E

500|$|After the {{legislature}} adjourned on July 18, 1786 without substantively <b>addressing</b> <b>these</b> complaints, rural Massachusetts protestors organized direct action, and began protest marches that {{shut down the}} state's court system, which enforced tax and civil forfeiture judgments and had become a focus of the discontent. [...] Bowdoin issued a proclamation in early September denouncing these actions, but took no overt steps to immediately organize a militia response (unlike governors in neighboring Connecticut and New Hampshire). [...] When the foreclosure court in Worcester was shut down by similar action on September 5, the county militia (composed mainly of men sympathetic to the protestors) refused to turn out, much to Bowdoin's chagrin. [...] The closure of the Worcester court was followed by closings in Concord and Taunton, and when the militia marched into Great Barrington to force court open there, one of the Judges, William Whiting asked the militiamen to take sides. [...] 800 of the 1,000 men took the people's side of the road. [...] By October, one correspondent wrote, [...] "We {{are now in a}} state of Anarchy and Confusion bordering on Civil War".|$|E
500|$|Critics of an {{expansionist policy}} {{consider}} the EU ETS {{to be too}} late and to price carbon too low to adequately mitigate the climate change impact of aviation emissions. Instead they advocate <b>addressing</b> <b>these</b> impacts by constraining demand for air travel. The study Predict and Decide - Aviation, climate change and UK policy, noting that a 10 per cent increase in fares generates a 5 to 15 per cent reduction in demand, recommends {{that the government should}} seek an alternative aviation policy based on managing demand rather than providing for it. This would be accomplished via a strategy that presumes [...] "… against the expansion of UK airport capacity" [...] and constrains demand by the use of economic instruments to price air travel less attractively. In another study the levying of £9billion of taxes is calculated to constrain the forecast growth in demand by 2030 to 315million passengers, reducing the annual rate of growth to 2 per cent. The environmental message is echoed in the ninth report of the House of Commons Environmental Audit Select Committee, published in July 2006, which labels the government strategy a predict and provide model and expresses scepticism about the timescale and efficiency of the EU ETS. It recommends instead that the government rethinks its airport expansion policy and considers ways, particularly via increased taxation, in which future demand can be managed in line with industry performance in achieving fuel efficiencies, so that emissions are not allowed to increase in absolute terms.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} criticized for its {{portrayal}} of people who identify as transgender, particularly regarding the way Ida was treated by other characters. Food that Ida prepared for the dinner party at the Griffin house was thrown out and Brian's learning of her sex-reassignment surgery after {{he had sex with}} her caused him to [...] "violently" [...] vomit for 30 unbroken seconds. Speaking with LGBT media website AfterElton.com in January 2010, series creator Seth MacFarlane mentioned the episode in response to concerns over how his animated series have portrayed LGBT characters. [...] "It always distresses me when I hear that the gay community is upset with us, because that's one group of people I hope would know we're on their side. I can safely say that the transsexual community will be very, very happy with the 'Quagmire' episode that we have coming up in a couple of months. It's probably the most sympathetic portrayal of a transexual [...] character that has ever been on television, dare I say." [...] In a subsequent review, AfterElton.com writer Brent Hartinger graded the episode negatively. While noting that the episode deserves credit for making important points about transgender people, he found its inclusion of the vomiting scene and Lois and Peter's transphobic remarks about Ida to be [...] "shockingly insensitive". Hartinger continued, [...] "Frankly, it's literally impossible for me to reconcile last night's episode with MacFarlane's words, unless I {{come to the conclusion that}} the man is pretty much a complete idiot." [...] The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, an LGBT media watchdog organization, released a statement about the episode, noting that [...] "GLAAD shares the serious concerns being voiced from members of the community and GLAAD’s Entertainment Media Team is <b>addressing</b> <b>these</b> with Fox. Next steps will be decided at that point." [...] In a September 2010 interview in Details, MacFarlane expressed surprise at the negative reaction, stating [...] "I don't meet a lot of stupid homosexuals." [...] He repeated that he still felt Ida was a [...] "very sympathetic portrayal of a transsexual character". He also defended Brian's vomiting after discovering he had sex with someone who had undergone sex reassignment surgery noting Brian's character is heterosexual and [...] "If I found out that I had slept with a transsexual, I might throw up in the same way that a gay guy looks at a vagina and goes, 'Oh, my God, that's disgusting.'" [...] Eames (Digital Spy) believed the episode was [...] "surprisingly kind" [...] to the transgender community for [...] "Family Guy standards".|$|E
