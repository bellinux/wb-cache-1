25|$|The SA.4 was {{designed}} for a crew of five: pilot, copilot, bombardier ("air bomber"), navigator and radio operator. The prone bombardier's position was a tube extending forward of the cockpit above the radome; the crew compartment being pressurized. These positions were fitted with opaque nosecones, as the Sperrins were never used for live bombing. The pilot was {{the only member of}} the crew to have a Martin-Baker-produced ejector seat underneath a jettisonable roof panel; other crew members were intended to bail out via a door located under the navigator's console. The other three crew positions were located behind the pilots, facing rearwards. Unusually, the pilot's flying controls lacked any direct connection to the aircraft's flight control surfaces, control input was instead directed into a gearbox to actuate rotatable ball-screw jacks to move each flight surface via aerodynamic load instead; a corresponding <b>artificial</b> <b>feel</b> <b>system</b> was also installed. Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist describe the control system as having been simple, light, reliable, and low-friction and contrast it positively against powered systems of the era.|$|E
50|$|The G.91 is {{equipped}} with an swept wing, which uses an all-metal two-spar structure; the outer panels can all be detached for transportation or easy replacement, while the center section is integral with the fuselage. It is swept at a 37-degree angle at quarter-chord with a thickness-to-chord ratio of 10 per cent. The wing features single-slotted flaps and hydraulically-actuated ailerons. The tailplane is electrically actuated and had irreversible hydraulic elevators fitted with an <b>artificial</b> <b>feel</b> <b>system</b> as well as hydraulically-actuated air brakes and a drogue parachute located {{at the base of}} the rudder for rapid deceleration.|$|E
50|$|The flight {{controls}} of the Valiant {{consisted of two}} channels of power control with full manual backup; flying in manual was allowed but limited, being intended to be used only {{in the event of}} complete electrical failure. The {{flight controls}} reportedly required considerable effort to manually operate. All three axis of the flight controls featured a dynamic <b>artificial</b> <b>feel</b> <b>system,</b> the pressure for which was provided via a ram-air inlet. A Smith Aerospace autopilot and instrument landing system (ILS) functionality was installed along with various navigational aids, such as the Marconi Company-built Green Satin doppler radar, Gee radio navigation, Automatic Direction Finder (ADF), VOR/Distance Measuring Equipment (DME), and radar altimeters. Provisions for additional equipment and sensors, such as side looking airborne radar, were also made.|$|E
2500|$|With purely {{mechanical}} {{flight control}} systems, the aerodynamic {{forces on the}} control surfaces are transmitted through the mechanisms and are felt directly by the pilot, allowing tactile feedback of airspeed. With hydromechanical flight control systems, however, the load on the surfaces cannot be felt {{and there is a}} risk of overstressing the aircraft through excessive control surface movement. To overcome this problem, <b>artificial</b> <b>feel</b> <b>systems</b> can be used. For example, for the controls of the RAF's Avro Vulcan jet bomber and the RCAF's Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow supersonic interceptor (both 1950s-era designs), the required force feedback was achieved by a spring device. [...] The fulcrum of this device was moved in proportion to the square of the air speed (for the elevators) to give increased resistance at higher speeds. For the controls of the American Vought F-8 Crusader and the LTV A-7 Corsair II warplanes, a 'bob-weight' was used in the pitch axis of the control stick, giving force feedback that was proportional to the airplane's normal acceleration.|$|R

50|$|The Dassault Falcon 20 is a French {{business}} jet, {{often considered}} to be an easy to fly and relatively visually appealing aircraft. The favourable flight qualities of the aircraft meant that {{there was no need to}} incorporate a stick pusher or stall-barrier systems in order to achieve its predictable stall behaviour. The flight controls of the Falcon 20 are hydraulically-powered, augmenting the mechanical pushrods between the cockpit controls and the flight control surfaces. In the event of complete hydraulic failure, the aircraft can be practically flown without any augmentation. The controls incorporate an <b>artificial</b> <b>feel</b> <b>system,</b> optimising the sensations perceivable to the operating pilot to be smooth, predictable, and precise. On the Falcon 200, the cockpit is heavily modernised, being more comparable with the newer Falcon 50 and Falcon 200 than the original Falcon 20.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} of <b>feel</b> <b>system</b> and {{flight control system}} dynamics on lateral flying qualities was conducted using the variable stability USAF NT- 33 aircraft. Experimental variations in <b>feel</b> <b>system</b> natural frequency, force-deflection gradient, control system command architecture type, flight control system filter frequency, and control system delay were made. The experiment data include pilot ratings using the Cooper-Harper (1969) rating scale, pilot comments, and tracking performance statistic. Three test pilots served as evaluators. The data indicate that as the <b>feel</b> <b>system</b> natural frequency is reduced lateral flying qualities degrade. At the slowest <b>feel</b> <b>system</b> frequency, the closed-loop response becomes nonlinear with a 'bobweight' effect apparent in the <b>feel</b> <b>system.</b> <b>Feel</b> <b>system</b> influences were essentially independent of the control system architecture. The flying qualities influence due to the <b>feel</b> <b>system</b> was different than when the identical dynamic systenm {{was used as a}} flight control system element...|$|R
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was controlled by}} a fighter-type control stick and rudder bar which operated the powered flying controls (PFCs). Each PFC had a single electro-hydraulic powered flying control unit (PFCU) except the rudder which had two, one running as a back-up. <b>Artificial</b> <b>feel</b> and autostabilisation {{in the form of}} pitch and yaw dampers were provided, as well as an auto mach trimmer.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the influence of lateral <b>feel</b> <b>system</b> characteristics on fighter aircraft roll flying qualities was conducted using the variable stability USAF NT- 33. Forty-two evaluation flights were flown by three engineering test pilots. The investigation utilized the power approach, visual landing task and up-and-away tasks including formation, gun tracking, and computer-generated compensatory attitude tracking tasks displayed on the Head-Up Display. Experimental variations included the <b>feel</b> <b>system</b> frequency, force-deflection gradient, control system command type (force or position input command), aircraft roll mode time constant, control system prefilter frequency, and control system time delay. The primary data were task performance records and evaluation pilot comments and ratings using the Cooper-Harper scale. The data highlight the unique and powerful effect of the <b>feel</b> <b>system</b> of flying qualities. The data show that the <b>feel</b> <b>system</b> is not 'equivalent' in flying qualities influence to analogous control system elements. A lower limit of allowable <b>feel</b> <b>system</b> frequency appears warranted to ensure good lateral flying qualities. Flying qualities criteria should most properly treat the <b>feel</b> <b>system</b> dynamic influence separately from the control system, since the input and output of this dynamic element is apparent to the pilot and thus, does not produce a 'hidden' effect...|$|R

40|$|As part of {{an ongoing}} {{government}} and industry effort to study the flying qualities of aircraft with rate-limited control surface actuators, two studies were previously flown to examine an algorithm developed to reduce the tendency for pilot-induced oscillation when rate limiting occurs. This algorithm, when working properly, greatly improved the performance of the aircraft in the first study. In the second study, however, the algorithm did not initially offer as much improvement. The differences between the two studies caused concern. The study detailed in this paper was performed to determine whether the performance of the algorithm was affected by the characteristics of the cockpit controllers. Time delay and flight control system noise were also briefly evaluated. An in-flight simulator, the Calspan Learjet 25, was programmed with a low roll actuator rate limit, and the algorithm was programmed into the flight control system. Side- and center-stick controllers, force and position command signals, a rate-limited <b>feel</b> <b>system,</b> a low-frequency <b>feel</b> <b>system,</b> and a <b>feel</b> <b>system</b> damper were evaluated. The flight program consisted of four flights and 38 evaluations of test configurations. Performance of the algorithm was determined to be unaffected by using side- or center-stick controllers or force or position command signals. The rate-limited <b>feel</b> <b>system</b> performed as well as the rate-limiting algorithm but was disliked by the pilots. The low-frequency <b>feel</b> <b>system</b> and the <b>feel</b> <b>system</b> damper were ineffective. Time delay and noise were determined to degrade the performance of the algorithm...|$|R

50|$|The first non-experimental {{aircraft}} {{that was designed}} and flown (in 1958) with a {{fly-by-wire flight control system}} was the Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow, a feat not repeated with a production aircraft until Concorde in 1969. This system also included solid-state components and system redundancy, was designed to be integrated with a computerised navigation and automatic search and track radar, was flyable from ground control with data uplink and downlink, and provided <b>artificial</b> <b>feel</b> (feedback) to the pilot.|$|R

500|$|The Victor had fully {{duplicated}} powered controls; many of {{the flight}} controls and flight surfaces were designed with redundancies. Pilot control movements were transmitted via a low-friction mechanical system. This setup was developed to provide, amongst other capabilities, a level of <b>artificial</b> <b>feel</b> to the pilot. Eight separated hydraulic circuits were present on the aircraft, which comprised the alighting gear, flaps, nose flaps, air brakes, bomb doors, wheel brakes, nose-wheel steering, and the ram-air turbine scoops. An AC electrical system and auxiliary power unit were significant additions upon the later Victor B.2, electrical reliability being noticeably improved.|$|R
2500|$|The Delta 2 had a {{relatively}} small cockpit, in which the single pilot was housed, which had little room for the installation of additional equipment. The Delta was the first British aircraft to fly using all-powered controls. These controls, designed and produced by Fairey, were fully duplicated. The flight control system was hydraulically operated and possessed no mechanical backup. Fairey had recently developed a new high-pressure hydraulic system and this {{was used in the}} design. The hydraulics provided no feedback or [...] "feel" [...] to the pilot's controls, so another <b>system</b> providing <b>artificial</b> <b>feel</b> was necessary.|$|R

The results obtained indicate {{that the use of}} displacement sensing added the <b>feel</b> <b>system</b> dynamic lag to the command path and increased effective system flight delay, thereby lowering pilot opinion and performance but reducing the possibility of roll instability; the use of force sensing as stick command to exclude <b>feel</b> <b>system</b> dynamic lag had the obverse effect...|$|R
40|$|Imagine if {{you could}} feel the sensations a bird may feel while flying. That is what the Fly by <b>Feel</b> <b>system</b> offers. The Fly by <b>Feel</b> <b>system</b> is being {{designed}} to provide tactile feedback to a pilot by monitoring properties of air flow (e. g., air pressure) across the wings. This could not only allow for an improved experience while flying but it should also allow pilots to be safer. This system is primarily being designed for sailplanes (gliders). The Fly by <b>Feel</b> <b>system</b> is being designed to take readings from sensors on the wings and translate these readings into tactile feedback (touch). There are several parts to this system; however I will be focused on the tactile feedback method. This is an innovative project that may not only allow for an incredible new way to experience flight, but may also make flying safer as the pilot could “feel ” changes in wind speed and pressure. The goal of the Fly by <b>Feel</b> <b>system</b> is to equip the wing of a glider with an array of sensors measuring air flow properties on the wing, and feed that information back to the glider pilot via a tactile feedback system. The goal of my research is to design and test a new type of actuator that will provide air based variable tactile feedback. The system will vary the amount and pressure of the air flow sent to the pilots skin based on sensor data. This system should provide more control than past designs (see Parrott, 2008; Wronski, 2008). This greater control will be achieved through adjustments of individual actuator air flow, as well using smaller air to skin contacts...|$|R
40|$|Flying qualities {{problems}} of modern, full-authority electronic flight control systems {{are most often}} related {{to the introduction of}} additional time delay in aircraft response to a pilot input. These delays can {{have a significant effect on}} the flying qualities of the aircraft. This paper reexamines time delay effects in light of recent flight test experience with aircraft incorporating new technology. Data from the X- 29 A forward-swept-wing demonstrator, a related preliminary in-flight experiment, and other flight observations are presented. These data suggest that the present MIL-F- 8785 C allowable-control system time delay specifications are inadequate or, at least, incomplete. Allowable time delay appears to be a function of the shape of the aircraft response following the initial delay. The cockpit <b>feel</b> <b>system</b> is discussed as a dynamic element in the flight control system. Data presented indicate that the time delay associated with a significant low-frequency <b>feel</b> <b>system</b> does not result in the predicted degradation in aircraft flying qualities. The impact of the <b>feel</b> <b>system</b> is discussed from two viewpoints: as a filter in the control system which can alter the initial response shape and, therefore, the allowable time delay, and as a unique dynamic element whose delay contribution can potentially be discounted by special pilot loop closures...|$|R
