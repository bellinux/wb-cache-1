5|$|After the Camp returned, Smith drew {{heavily from}} its {{participants}} to establish five governing {{bodies in the}} church, all originally of equal authority to check one another. Among these five groups was a quorum of twelve apostles. Smith gave <b>a</b> <b>revelation</b> saying that to redeem Zion, his followers would have to receive an endowment in the Kirtland Temple, and in March 1836, at the temple's dedication, many participants in the promised endowment saw visions of angels, spoke in tongues, and prophesied.|$|E

5|$|During Gilberto's {{third season}} at América Mineiro, {{with the team}} back to Série B after relegation in Série A in 1999, he played 20 games and scored one goal, helping the club to finish runners-up in the league. In 2000, aged 24, he joined rival club Atlético Mineiro. In his first season for the club, he {{fractured}} his right tibia and, as a result, missed a number of games. In his second season, he was moved by the manager Carlos Alberto Parreira from central defence to a defensive midfield role where he flourished. He scored three goals in the 2001 season and became <b>a</b> <b>revelation</b> in Brazilian club football.|$|E
5|$|Game Revolution {{said the}} {{multiplayer}} feature was <b>a</b> <b>revelation</b> and {{worth the cost}} of the game alone. Computer Games said it was innovative and may serve as an inspiration for future games. PC Gamer said the multiplayer mode was the redeeming factor of the game, though it was still marred by bugs. Others noted that aspects of the multiplayer interface were insufficient, such as the inability to store custom dialog, requiring the Storyteller to type text in real time during gameplay.|$|E
5|$|In {{the siege}} of Medina, the Meccans exerted the {{available}} strength to destroy the Muslim community. The failure resulted in a significant loss of prestige; their trade with Syria vanished. Following the Battle of the Trench, Muhammad made two expeditions to the north, both ended without any fighting. While returning from one of these journeys (or some years earlier according to other early accounts), an accusation of adultery was made against Aisha, Muhammad's wife. Aisha was exonerated from accusations when Muhammad announced he had received <b>a</b> <b>revelation</b> confirming Aisha's innocence and directing that charges of adultery be supported by four eyewitnesses (sura 24, An-Nur).|$|E
50|$|A bishop {{can judge}} <b>an</b> alleged private <b>revelation</b> {{to be either}} worthy of belief (constat de supernaturalitate) or not worthy of belief (constat de non supernaturalitate). <b>A</b> private <b>revelation</b> that is worthy of belief can receive full {{approval}} if it is approved by the Pope, such as happened with the revelations to St. Margaret Mary. Papal approval does not include popes visiting sites of alleged revelations, granting special privileges to shrines, offering gifts to alleged visionaries, or speaking favorably of alleged <b>revelations</b> or visionaries. <b>A</b> private <b>revelation</b> that is not worthy of belief can either be more fully investigated or, if bad fruits are found, condemned. <b>A</b> condemned <b>revelation</b> may not be followed, believed, or published by the faithful.|$|R

Through information gained from Stoichev, Helen and Paul discover that Dracula is most likely buried in the Bulgarian monastery of Sveti Georgi.|$|E
5|$|Polygamy {{caused a}} breach between Smith {{and his first}} wife, Emma. Although Emma knew of some of her husband's marriages, she almost {{certainly}} {{did not know the}} extent of his polygamous activities. In 1843, Emma temporarily accepted Smith's marriage to four women boarded in the Smith household, but soon regretted her decision and demanded the other wives leave. In July 1843, Smith dictated <b>a</b> <b>revelation</b> directing Emma to accept plural marriage, but the two were not reconciled until September 1843, after Emma began participating in temple ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|Smith's {{authority}} was undermined when Oliver Cowdery, Hiram Page, and other church members also claimed to receive revelations. In response, Smith dictated <b>a</b> <b>revelation</b> which clarified his {{office as a}} prophet and an apostle, and which declared that only he held the ability to give doctrine and scripture for the entire church. Shortly after the conference, Smith dispatched Cowdery, Peter Whitmer, and others {{on a mission to}} proselytize Native Americans. Cowdery was also assigned the task of locating the site of the New Jerusalem.|$|E

5|$|Friedrich {{began his}} formal study {{of art in}} 1790 as a private student of artist Johann Gottfried Quistorp at the University of Greifswald in his home city, at which the art {{department}} is now named Caspar-David-Friedrich-Institut in his honour. Quistorp took his students on outdoor drawing excursions; as a result, Friedrich was encouraged to sketch from life at an early age. Through Quistorp, Friedrich met and was subsequently influenced by the theologian Ludwig Gotthard Kosegarten, who taught that nature was <b>a</b> <b>revelation</b> of God. Quistorp introduced Friedrich {{to the work of}} the German 17th-century artist Adam Elsheimer, whose works often included religious subjects dominated by landscape, and nocturnal subjects. During this period he also studied literature and aesthetics with Swedish professor Thomas Thorild. Four years later Friedrich entered the prestigious Academy of Copenhagen, where he began his education by making copies of casts from antique sculptures before proceeding to drawing from life. Living in Copenhagen afforded the young painter access to the Royal Picture Gallery's collection of 17th-century Dutch landscape painting. At the Academy he studied under teachers such as Christian August Lorentzen and the landscape painter Jens Juel. These artists were inspired by the Sturm und Drang movement and represented a midpoint between the dramatic intensity and expressive manner of the budding Romantic aesthetic and the waning neo-classical ideal. Mood was paramount, and influence was drawn from such sources as the Icelandic legend of Edda, the poems of Ossian and Norse mythology.|$|E
5|$|Unlike in Ellendale and Georgetown, the Millsboro–South and Milford {{proposals}} faced strong opposition. In the Millsboro–South area, DelDOT's preferred alternative, the Blue Alternative, was {{an eastern}} bypass that would diverge from existing US 113 north of Selbyville; {{pass to the}} east of Frankford and Dagsboro, cross the Indian River, and parallel DE 24 west to rejoin US 113's present course north of Betts Pond north of Millsboro. US 113 would have had interchanges with DE 54 at its current junction, with DE 20 and DE 26 east of Dagsboro, with DE 24 east of Millsboro, with DE 30 north of Millsboro, and with DE 20 where the bypass rejoins the present course of US 113. However, DelDOT's preference faced opposition due to its cost, its land requirements, and <b>a</b> <b>revelation</b> that DelDOT was paying a pair of developers each month to not build on the path of the proposed bypass. In response to the payment scheme, Governor Jack Markell suspended further planning work on US113 in Sussex County in January 2011. Markell indicated the project could resume if Sussex County legislators and DelDOT come up with a revised plan for the MillsboroSouth area.|$|E

5|$|The Daoist {{religious}} {{society of the}} Five Pecks of Rice was initiated by Zhang Daoling in 142 CE. Zhang was raised {{in what is now}} Jiangsu where he studied Daoist beliefs in immortality. He moved to what is now Sichuan province and claimed to have <b>a</b> <b>revelation</b> where the deified Laozi appointed him as his earthly representative and Celestial Master. The movement spread rapidly, particularly under Zhang's sons, Zhang Heng and Zhang Lu. Instead of money, followers were asked to contribute five pecks of rice to the {{religious society}} and banned the worship of 'unclean' gods who accepted sacrificial offerings of meat. Initiated members of the group were called 'libationers', a title associated with village elders who took the first drink at feasts. The laity were told that if they obeyed the rules of the religious society, they would be rewarded with good health. Illness was thus seen as the result of violating religious rules and committing personal sins, which required confession to libationers charged with overseeing the recovery of sinners. They believed that chanting parts of the Daodejing would bring about cures for illnesses. Zhang Daoling's second successor Zhang Lu initiated a rebellion in 184 CE that allowed him to retain complete control over Ba and Hanzhong commanderies (of modern Sichuan and southern Shanxi) for three decades. He even modelled his 'charity houses' after Han postal stations, yet his establishments offered grain and meat to followers. Although Zhang Lu surrendered to Chancellor Cao Cao (155220 CE) in 215 CE, Cao was still wary of his influence over the people, so he granted Zhang and his sons fiefs to placate them.|$|E

40|$|Consider {{the problem}} of Bayesian implementation, i. e., of {{constructing}} mechanisms with the property that all Bayesian equilibrium outcomes agree with a given choice rule. The authors show that a general procedure is to start with <b>an</b> incentive-compatible <b>revelation</b> mechanism, and then augment agents' message spaces in order to eliminate undesired equilibria. Specifically, they present <b>an</b> augmented <b>revelation</b> principle, which states that if there exists any mechanism that implements a given choice rule, then <b>an</b> augmented <b>revelation</b> mechanism will also implement it. This principle enables the authors to obtain necessary conditions for implementation. For a large class of environments, these conditions are also sufficient.
