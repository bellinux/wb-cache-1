5|$|In 1864 Brookwood (Necropolis) {{railway station}} on the LSWR opened, {{immediately}} east of Necropolis Junction. In conjunction with {{the building of the}} station a run-around loop was added at Necropolis Junction, allowing locomotives to reposition themselves from the front {{to the rear of the}} train. From then on, on arrival at Necropolis Junction from London the engine would not be repositioned, but would push the train into the cemetery from the rear, under the close supervision of LNC staff. This left the engine positioned to pull the train out of the cemetery, after which it would use the run-around loop to move to the other end of the train <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> back to London. Between 1898 and 1904 the LSWR line through Brookwood was increased from two to four tracks; a thin slice of the northernmost part of the cemetery was ceded to the LSWR to allow the widening of the line. Brookwood station was rebuilt, and a new junction to the west of the station allowed trains to pass between the cemetery branch and all four of the LSWR lines.|$|E
5|$|The {{capsizing}} of {{the battleship}} Novorossiysk in Sevastopol harbor on 29 October 1955 delayed salvage operations on Stalingrad {{until the end}} of the year. The hull had to be patched, the water pumped out and all the projections removed to raise the stern slightly with pontoons, pivot into deeper water, then trim it down to elevate the bow off the bottom <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> free. These preparations were very time-consuming and it wasn't until mid-July 1956 that it could be pulled off the rocks into Sevastopol harbor where she was given more permanent repairs. She was then moved to the Naval Firing Range between Yevpatoria and Sevastopol where it was used as a target for seven P-1 or KSS anti-ship missiles fired from the converted Sverdlov-class cruiser Admiral Nakhimov in December 1956. The missiles penetrated the upper and main decks and devastated the upper hull, but there was no appreciable change in the ship's draught. Details are not known about other tests, although she reportedly served as a target for P-15 Termit (SS-N-2 Styx) missiles and a wide variety of armor-piercing munitions. By the early 1960s her usefulness had come to an end and she was scrapped, possibly in 1962.|$|E

5|$|The retiarius was {{routinely}} {{pitted against}} a heavily armed secutor. The net-fighter {{made up for}} his lack of protective gear by using his speed and agility to avoid his opponent's attacks {{and waiting for the}} opportunity to strike. He first tried to throw his net over his rival. If this succeeded, he attacked with his trident while his adversary was entangled. Another tactic was to ensnare his enemy's weapon in the net <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> out of his grasp, leaving the opponent defenseless. Should the net miss or the secutor grab hold of it, the retiarius likely discarded the weapon, although he might try to collect it back for a second cast. Usually, the retiarius had to rely on his trident and dagger to finish the fight. The trident, as tall as a human being, permitted the gladiator to jab quickly and keep his distance. It was a strong weapon, capable of inflicting piercing wounds on an unprotected skull or limb. The dagger was the retiariuss final backup should the trident be lost. It was reserved for when close combat or a straight wrestling match had to settle the bout. In some battles, a single retiarius faced two secutores simultaneously. For these situations, the lightly armoured gladiator was placed on a raised platform and given a supply of stones with which to repel his pursuers.|$|E

[...] Kimi Räikkönen expressed disappointment with not being able to win, but said he was [...] "very happy how the team is working" [...] and highlighted the big step forward Ferrari had made over the winter. Nico Rosberg was disappointed about the brake failure costing him second place, but added that he was very happy with the car altogether.|$|E
500|$|Small {{birds are}} killed on impact or when {{squeezed}} by the Eurasian sparrowhawk's foot, especially the two long claws. Victims which struggle are [...] "kneaded" [...] by the hawk, using its talons to squeeze and stab. When dealing with large prey species which peck and flap, the hawk's long legs help. It stands {{on top of}} its prey to pluck <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> apart. The feathers are plucked and usually the breast muscles are eaten first. The bones are left, but can be broken using the notch in the bill. Like other birds of prey, Eurasian sparrowhawks produce pellets containing indigestible parts of their prey. These range from [...] long and [...] wide and are round {{at one end and}} more narrow and pointed at the other. They are usually composed of small feathers, as the larger ones are plucked and not consumed.|$|E
500|$|On {{the south}} side of town, a Confederate {{artillery}} crew led by Captain John M. Oliver struggled to find horses to move their two artillery pieces. Finally securing horses, they moved toward Main Street with their two large weapons. Captain Gilmore, from the 1st West Virginia Cavalry, became aware of the artillery threat, while a small group of Confederate soldiers under the command of Lieutenant Henry Bozang rushed to protect the artillery and its crew. [...] A combined force of cavalry and infantry, led by Lieutenant Abraham from Gillmore's Company, charged through Bozang's men while the artillery crew hurriedly tried to load their weapons. The Confederate artillerists were able to fire one shot, but its main effect was to cause the horses still attached to the other piece of artillery to panic <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> over. Before the remaining artillery piece could be reloaded, Abraham's men captured it while killing Oliver and two gunners. The remaining artillery crew fled. Lieutenant Bozang was wounded and his command surrendered.|$|E

500|$|A bottom-dwelling octopus {{typically}} moves {{among the}} rocks and feels through the crevices. The creature may make a jet-propelled pounce on prey <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> towards the mouth with its arms, the suckers restraining it. Small prey may be completely trapped by the webbed structure. Octopuses usually inject crustaceans like crabs with a paralysing saliva then dismember them with their beaks. Octopuses feed on shelled molluscs either by forcing the valves apart, or by drilling {{a hole in the}} shell to inject a nerve toxin. It used to be thought that the hole was drilled by the radula, but it has now been shown that minute teeth {{at the tip of the}} salivary papilla are involved, and an enzyme in the toxic saliva is used to dissolve the calcium carbonate of the shell. It takes about three hours for O. vulgaris to create a [...] hole. Once the shell is penetrated, the prey dies almost instantaneously, its muscles relax, and the soft tissues are easy for the octopus to remove. Crabs may also be treated in this way; tough-shelled species are more likely to be drilled, and soft-shelled crabs are torn apart.|$|E
500|$|In {{terms of}} their characteristics, Panhandle hooks are nearly the {{opposite}} of Alberta clippers. [...] Instead of forming {{in the north and}} dropping south, these low pressure systems form in the southwestern United States and then move northeast. [...] They get their name from the location where they usually make their turn to the north; near the panhandles of Oklahoma and Texas. [...] Unlike clippers, these storms usually {{have a great deal of}} moisture to work with. [...] As the storms make their turn to the north, they pull in moist air from the nearby Gulf of Mexico <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> northward toward Minnesota and other parts of the Midwest. As these systems move to the northeast, there will usually be a heavy band of snow to the northwest of the low pressure center if there is enough cold air present. [...] A wintery mix of precipitation, rain, or sometimes even thunderstorms will then often occur to the south of it. Snowfall over a foot (30cm) is not uncommon with a panhandle hook, and because of the high moisture content in these systems the snow is usually wet and heavy. Large panhandle hooks can become powerful enough to draw in arctic air after they pass by the state, leaving bitter cold temperatures and wind chills in their wake. [...] Panhandle Hooks are responsible for some of the most famous blizzards that have occurred in the Midwest, including the Great Storm of 1975.|$|E
500|$|Writers {{agree that}} the episode was risky and could have failed spectacularly. Jonathan Bernstein in the British {{newspaper}} The Observer writes [...] "What could have been, at best, an eccentric diversion and, at worst, a shuddering embarrassment, succeeded on every level It provided a startling demonstration that creator Joss Whedon has a facility with lyrics and melody equal to the one he's demonstrated {{for the past six}} seasons with dialogue, character and plot twists. Rather than adopt the 'Hey, wouldn't it be wacky if we suddenly burst into song?' approach practised by Ally McBeal, the Buffy musical was entirely organic to the series' labyrinthine progression." [...] Johnston in the Sunday Herald Sun says, [...] "There is just so much to this marvellously cheeky episode that suggests the show can take any route it pleases <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> off", while Debi Enker in The Age comments, [...] "Whedon demonstrates yet again what Buffy aficionados have known and appreciated for years: that his wit, playfulness and readiness to take a risk make his television efforts rise way above the pack." [...] Steve Murray in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution characterizes the episode as [...] "scary in a brand-new way", saying [...] "Once More, with Feeling" [...] is [...] "as impressive as Whedon's milestone episodes 'Hush' and 'The Body; the episode is [...] "often hilarious", according to Murray, and acts as [...] "(b)oth spoof and homage, [...] the hokiness of musicals while also capturing the guilty pleasure and surges of feeling the genre inspires".|$|E

500|$|The cockpit voice {{recorder}} captured the sounds of crashing, screaming, and the shattering of glass and plates. Three times {{in a period of}} five seconds there were shouts of pain or distress from a hijacker outside the cockpit, suggesting a hijacker that was standing guard outside the cockpit was being attacked by the passengers. Jarrah stabilized the plane at 10:00:03. Five seconds later, he asked, [...] "Is that it? Shall we finish it off?" [...] Another hijacker responded, [...] "No. Not yet. When they all come, we finish it off." [...] Jarrah once again pitched the airplane up and down. A passenger in the background cried, [...] "In the cockpit. If we don't, we'll die" [...] at 10:00:25. Sixteen seconds later, another passenger, identified as Tom Burnett, yelled, [...] "Roll it!", possibly referring to using the food cart. The {{voice recorder}} did record the sound of the passengers using the food cart as a battering ram against the cockpit door. Jarrah ceased the violent maneuvers at 10:01:00 and recited the takbir several times. He then asked another hijacker, [...] "Is that it? I mean, shall we put it down?" [...] The other hijacker responded, [...] "Yes, put it in it, <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> down." [...] The passengers continued their assault and at 10:02:17, a male passenger said, [...] "Turn it up!" [...] A second later, a hijacker said, [...] "Pull it down! Pull it down!" [...] At 10:02:33, Jarrah was heard to plead, [...] "Hey! Hey!", and then [...] "Give it to me!" [...] repeated eight times in succession, possibly referring to the plane's yoke.|$|E

2500|$|Bi-directionality: Most tank {{locomotives}} {{are capable}} of running at full speed in either direction (although this depends of the wheel arrangement; for example, a 2-6-0T {{will not be able}} to run as fast in reverse, due to lack of a trailing truck). Most tender locomotives are unable to do this, because the heavy tender is not designed to be pushed and may become unstable at higher speeds. [...] Tender locomotives generally require turning facilities, such as a turntable or wye, at each end of the run. A tank locomotive, on the other hand, can simply run around the train (provided there is a siding) <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> back in the other direction. [...] The crew of a tank engine generally have a better view in the reverse direction than for a tender engine and are protected from the weather.|$|E
2500|$|Two more near-disasters on May 17 led to {{the naming}} of {{additional}} features. [...] William Clark was nearly bitten by a rattlesnake while exploring a creek on the northern side of the river. [...] This creek was named Rattlesnake Creek (although today it is called Timber Creek). [...] The party camped near a creek {{on the south side}} of the river that evening. [...] Clark saw a fortified Native American lodge a short distance up the creek, believing it to be an Atsina (Gros Ventre) site. Late that night, a cottonwood tree sheltering the camp caught fire from sparks rising from the expedition campfire. [...] The men were barely able to get out of their tent <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> <b>it</b> out of the way before the tree came crashing down on the site. [...] Lewis named this Burnt Lodge Creek (although today it is known as Seven Blackfoot Creek). [...] On May 20, the expedition passed the Musselshell River. On May 22, the party passed another creek, which they decided to name Sacajawea Creek. (Later renamed Crooked Creek, the U.S. government formally changed the name back to Sacagawea Creek in 1979.) The Corps of Discovery left the CMR NWF on May 24 or 25, after spending a week passing through and exploring the area.|$|E
