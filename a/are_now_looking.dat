25|$|Walking {{for normal}} able bodied {{children}} is {{a lot different than}} walking for below-knee-amputees. Walking is less fluid and symmetrical for the children who are amputees. Research was conducted in order to find {{the best way to get}} the amputee children to develop a more symmetrical and fluid walking form like normal able bodied children. Because of the results of the study which showed that the normal bodied children can withstand a lot more external loading than the amputees, researchers <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>looking</b> into the manufacturing and design of the prosthetics that these amputees use. Potentially, they could come up a new idea or a model that can improve the walking capabilities of these amputee children.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have looked}} at, {{and some have}} even optimized, {{protocols}} for testing for various issues, including non-compatible RhD factors, sex determination for X-linked genetic disorders and testing for single gene disorders. Current studies <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>looking</b> at determining aneuploidies in the developing fetus. These protocols can be done earlier than the current prenatal testing methods, and have no risk of spontaneous abortion, unlike current prenatal testing methods. Non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) and Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) have been implemented in the UK {{and parts of the}} US; it has clear benefits above the standard tests of chorionic villi sample (CVS), amniocentesis, and other techniques which have procedure-related miscarriage risks of about 1 in 100 pregnancies and 1 in 200 pregnancies, respectively.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{audio and}} diverse vocal track were widely praised. Critics {{credited}} the voice acting for its different accents and styles, with [...] "cleverly lewd" [...] scripts and [...] "dead-on" [...] movie spoofs. Most reviewers agreed the jokes were clever and funny. According to IGN, [...] "Is {{it over the}} top? Yes. Is it lowbrow? Yes. And yet, it's also very well delivered and smart too -- and it's funny. Really, honestly, funny". Game Revolution noted that the game [...] "has its crosshairs directly aimed at the college audience" [...] and that [...] "it works perfectly for the peeps who've grown up with Mario and <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>looking</b> for someone less dorky". The soundtrack was praised for its different arrangements of specific songs that gradually change as players move from one area to the next, and for its rich and creative instrumentation. Reviewers also highlighted the number of sound effects, with GameSpot noting that [...] "there are literally dozens of sounds just for Conker's footsteps".|$|E

Further complicating the matter, is the rise of anonymous social media platforms such as 4chan and Reddit.
