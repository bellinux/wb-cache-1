40|$|A {{heterogeneous}} data ensemble {{approach for}} {{the classification of}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins under ‘mitochondrion organization’ Proteins are the real role players in keeping a cell healthy and well functioning. An important group of proteins is the subset of mitochondrial proteins that engage in the <b>assembly,</b> <b>arrangement</b> and disassembly of the mitochondrion. Several {{of them have been}} identified to cause human diseases. Hence, annotating proteins under the ‘mitochondrion organization’ Biology process is vital for identifying disease causative factors and for designing therapeutics. As manual annotation requires costly and laborious in vitro methods, in silico function prediction is preferred nowadays. Recent studies identify the importance of incorporating data from various biological aspects, to formulate a strong functional context for classification. In addition, many approaches from literature employ ensemble classifiers to attain a higher prediction accuracy. However, an insightful approach for accurate classification; biological data utilization; and biological data type significance determination; is still in need. This study presents an assessment of a heterogeneous data ensemble to classify Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins under ‘mitochondrion organization’. The ensemble consists of nine euclidean-distance based nearest neighbour models and three affinity-based neighbourhood models; it utilizes sequences, protein domains, peptide chain properties, gene expression, secondary structure and interactions. The base models were trained upon annotations from the Gene Ontology, as well as from a publicly available benchmark gold dataset. They show a substantial level of disagreement, implying their effectiveness in collective decision making. Six combination schemes were evaluated for fusing the base model outputs. A Genetic Algorithmically weighted ensemble gives the highest improvement to the best performing base classifier, by displaying an average area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve of 92. 52 %. Moreover, it is capable of determining the biological importance of each data type. Overall, the proposed heterogeneous data ensemble is capable of identifying eight disease related proteins and one disease related protein in a strong and moderate sense, respectively...|$|E

40|$|DNA-functionalized gold {{nanoparticles}} (DNA-NPs) {{have enormous}} potential as {{building blocks for}} materials due {{to their ability to}} specifically recognize and respond to target molecules and surfaces. The ability of DNA aptamers to adopt different conformations and bind either complementary DNA sequences or analyte molecules allows them to mediate nanoparticle assembly or disassembly, generating selective colorimetric responses. Aptamer-mediated nanoparticle assembly and disassembly is sensitive to the nanoparticle ligand shell composition and structure, yet these topics have not been extensively explored. In this dissertation, a method for determining the ligand shell composition of DNA-NPs is described and a framework for understanding the impact of the DNA <b>assembly</b> <b>arrangement</b> and recognition strand density upon aptamer-mediated nanoparticle assembly and disassembly is developed. Design rules for creating sensors with desired properties are elucidated, leading to creation of sensors with improved detection limits and quantification ranges. A technique was needed to determine the number of DNA strands of any base composition attached to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) of any core size. A rapid, convenient and inexpensive method to quantify the number of label-free DNA strands attached to AuNPs was therefore developed. This technique was extended to determine two different DNA sequences bound to AuNPs using UV-visible and fluorescence spectroscopy. Based on the results of quantifying the ligand shells of DNA-NPs functionalized with two sequences, disulfide-terminated DNA non-specifically adsorbs and then rearranges to specifically bind the gold surface. The position of the AuNPs and DNA strands within DNA-NP assemblies had a profound influence on their ability to assemble and sense adenosine. Assemblies designed for large inter-AuNP spacing were stable but unable to sense adenosine. Assemblies designed for short inter-AuNP spacing were unstable until the DNA ligand shell was diluted. AuNPs functionalized with the fewest number of aptamers produced assemblies with the lowest detection limit and apparent disassociation constant and the largest analyte quantification range. Increasing the number of aptamer strands per AuNP increased the cooperativity of the AuNP disassembly response to adenosine.

30|$|The {{formation}} of graphene oxide (GO) layers on substrates {{is governed by}} the interactions between GO sheets (or flakes) and the substrate surface. GO may be considered a molecule with a hydrophobic polyaromatic backbone separated by cycloaliphatic structures containing C=C double bonds and hydrophilic hydroxyl and epoxy groups; and the edges of this nearly flat carbon grid expose carboxylic acid groups [11, 12]. The properties of reduced graphene oxide as a conducting material adsorbed on surfaces depend on the morphology of the constituting nano-sheets and the overall <b>assembly</b> <b>arrangement</b> [13]. Following the intended application of GO, reduced GO or graphene films, the morphology of the constituting adsorbed nano-sheets may be aspired to result smooth and flat or, alternatively, corrugated, e.g. wrinkled or crumpled [14 – 17]. The interaction between the substrate and graphene or between adsorbed nanoparticles and GO may govern the {{formation of}} wrinkles [14, 15] in the flexible nano-sheets. Wrinkles may occur on graphene planes and have high aspect ratios, with a height below 15  nm and lengths above 100  nm [15]. The layer assembly may be tuned by covalent interactions of the carboxylic and hydroxyl functional groups and by electrostatic interactions with polyelectrolytes [18, 19]. Thin graphene oxide layers may be obtained by dipping hydrophilic substrates like pretreated quartz in a 70  °C hot aqueous dispersion of exfoliated GO, resulting in continuous and homogeneous films [20]. Chemical adsorption was investigated by Ou et al. who contacted an aqueous GO formulation for 12  h at 80  °C with a (3 -aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES-SAM) covered Si wafer [21]. In a similar way, covalent anchoring was shown by Su and Chiou who attached GO to aminothiol modified gold surfaces [18]. Using such conventional adhesion promoter layers as substrates {{for the formation of}} GO films requires first the attachment of the organic layers to the respectively used substrate and, second, an adequate, e.g. chemical, interaction with the subsequently applied GO sheets. Therefore, polymeric interfactants may provide promising prospects since they strongly attach {{to a wide range of}} distinct substrate surfaces and, thus, may also be eligible for attaching GO nano-sheets.|$|E
40|$|The {{existence}} of the fundamental conflict in churches between the desirable acoustic conditions for music and for speech intelligibility prompted this dissertation. It tackles the subject not only under the acoustical perspective {{but also in the}} historical, theological, musicological and architectural aspects. This research studies, initially, how during the past, the liturgy, the acoustical and organizational characteristics of churches supported {{one or the other of}} these attributes. The second chapter presents the objective analyses of many Reformed worships and Catholic masses which make it possible to show the conditions and requirements for the current Christian celebrations in Switzerland. The analysis of the church geometrical parameters (volume, height, etc.) and of the results of objective acoustical measurements (reverberation time, background noise and speech intelligibility) of approximately two hundred churches in Switzerland allows to statistically describe their characteristics and to objectively verify the assumptions made in the preceding chapter. Chapter 3 also studies the local or global range of conclusions by the comparison of the results obtained in Switzerland with those published for other countries (synthesis of about 400 churches). The study of the origin and the interaction between Liturgy and Acoustics passes in particular by the analysis of the history of sacred music but especially by the examination of the main methods implemented to improve the acoustics of churches. Chapter 4 presents the historical evolution and the acoustical effectiveness of two types of devices used in churches: acoustic pots and pulpits with their canopies. The position of the various participants does not influence only the listening conditions but also reveals the importance attached to their participation. Chapter 5 examines then the historical evolution and statistical analysis of the current conditions regarding the position of the organ, the spatial arrangements for the seated congregation in churches, as well as the effect of the occupation on reverberation time and speech intelligibility. Chapter 6 concludes with the analysis of the desirable acoustical conditions in current churches, particularly with regard to the architectural, organizational (sound system, <b>assembly</b> <b>arrangement</b> and organ location) and the acoustical parameters (reverberation time, background noise and speech intelligibility). This last analysis is based on a significant bibliographical synthesis and on the comparison, for the sampled churches, of the results for objective measurements with the subjective evaluations obtained by a parishioner's sample survey...|$|E

40|$|Electrical machine drives are {{the most}} {{electrical}} energy-consuming systems worldwide. The largest proportion of drives is found in industrial applications. There are, however many other applications that are also based {{on the use of}} electrical machines, because they have a relatively high efficiency, a low noise level, and do not produce local pollution. Electrical machines can be classified into several categories. One of the most commonly used electrical machine types (especially in the industry) is induction motors, also known as asynchronous machines. They have a mature production process and a robust rotor construction. However, in the world pursuing higher energy efficiency with reasonable investments not every application receives the advantage of using this type of motor drives. The main drawback of induction motors is the fact that they need slipcaused and thus loss-generating current in the rotor, and additional stator current for magnetic field production along with the torque-producing current. This can reduce the electric motor drive efficiency, especially in low-speed, low-power applications. Often, when high torque density is required together with low losses, it is desirable to apply permanent magnet technology, because in this case {{there is no need to}} use current to produce the basic excitation of the machine. This promotes the effectiveness of copper use in the stator, and further, there is no rotor current in these machines. Again, if permanent magnets with a high remanent flux density are used, the air gap flux density can be higher than in conventional induction motors. These advantages have raised the popularity of PMSMs in some challenging applications, such as hybrid electric vehicles (HEV), wind turbines, and home appliances. Usually, a correctly designed PMSM has a higher efficiency and consequently lower losses than its induction machine counterparts. Therefore, the use of these electrical machines reduces the energy consumption of the whole system to some extent, which can provide good motivation to apply permanent magnet technology to electrical machines. However, the cost of high performance rare earth permanent magnets in these machines may not be affordable in many industrial applications, because the tight competition between the manufacturers dictates the rules of low-cost and highly robust solutions, where asynchronous machines seem to be more feasible at the moment. Two main electromagnetic components of an electrical machine are the stator and the rotor. In the case of a conventional radial flux PMSM, the stator contains magnetic circuit lamination and stator winding, and the rotor consists of rotor steel (laminated or solid) and permanent magnets. The lamination itself does not significantly influence the total cost of the machine, even though it can considerably increase the construction complexity, as it requires a special <b>assembly</b> <b>arrangement.</b> However, thin metal sheet processing methods are very effective and economically feasible. Therefore, the cost of the machine is mainly affected by the stator winding and the permanent magnets. The work proposed in this doctoral dissertation comprises a description and analysis of two approaches of PMSM cost reduction: one on the rotor side and the other on the stator side. The first approach on the rotor side includes the use of low-cost and abundant ferrite magnets together with a tooth-coil winding topology and an outer rotor construction. The second approach on the stator side exploits the use of a modular stator structure instead of a monolithic one. PMSMs with the proposed structures were thoroughly analysed by finite element method based tools (FEM). It was found out that by implementing the described principles, some favourable characteristics of the machine (mainly concerning the machine size) will inevitable be compromised. However, the main target of the proposed approaches is not to compete with conventional rare earth PMSMs, but to reduce the price at which they can be implemented in industrial applications, keeping their dimensions at the same level or lower than those of a typical electrical machine used in the industry at the moment. The measurement results of the prototypes show that the main performance characteristics of these machines are at an acceptable level. It is shown that with certain specific actions it is possible to achieve a desirable efficiency level of the machine with the proposed cost reduction methods...|$|E
