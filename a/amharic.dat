5|$|Takla Sadeq Makuriya (1913–2000), {{historian}} and {{former head of}} the National Archives and Library of Ethiopia, wrote various works in <b>Amharic</b> as well as foreign languages, including a four-volume Amharic-language series on the history of Ethiopia from ancient times until the reign of Selassie, published in the 1950s. During the 1980s he published a three-volume tome exploring the reigns of 19th-century Ethiopian rulers and the theme of national unity. He also produced two English chapters {{on the history of the}} Horn of Africa for UNESCO's General History of Africa and several French-language works on Ethiopia's church history and royal genealogies. Some volumes from his vernacular survey on general Ethiopian history have been edited and circulated as school textbooks in Ethiopian classrooms by the Ministry of Education. Kebede Michael (1916–1998), a playwright, historian, editor, and director of archaeology at the National Library, wrote works of world history, histories of Western civilization, and histories of Ethiopia, which, unlike his previous works, formed the central focus of his 1955 world history written in <b>Amharic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ethiopia has a long, {{historical}} {{reputation as}} a place where the weapon dance plays an important cultural role. According to Lucian, a Greek writer from the 2nd century, “The Ethiopians dance also during the battle. The Ethiopian never shoots his arrow without dancing and making a menacing gesture beforehand. He wants to frighten the enemy by his dance beforehand.” The broad range of weapon dances includes the hota jumping dance of <b>Amharic</b> males; the attack dance of the Hailefo; the stick-dance of the Kullo; the Beroronsi Hama Haban, a dramatic dagger dance of the Esa; and the shire, the saber dance of the Tigrean nomadic shepherds.|$|E
5|$|A French edition, {{translated}} by M. L. Carion (or by Louise Swanton-Belloc? (1796–1881)), appeared by 1853 published in Cambrai and in Paris. By 1857, the novel had {{been translated into}} 20 languages, including two independent translations into Slovene just one year after its original publication, which started the since-then uninterrupted dialogue between American authors and Slovene translators and readers. Later, it was translated into almost every major language, including Chinese (with translator Lin Shu creating the first Chinese translation of an American novel in 1901) and <b>Amharic</b> (with the 1930 translation created in support of Ethiopian efforts to end the suffering of blacks in that nation). The book was so widely read that Sigmund Freud reported a number of patients with sado-masochistic tendencies who he believed had been influenced by reading about the whipping of slaves in Uncle Tom's Cabin.|$|E
5|$|Edward Ullendorff {{considered}} the German orientalist Hiob Ludolf (1624–1704) {{to be the}} founder of Ethiopian studies in Europe, thanks to his efforts in documenting the history of Ethiopia and the Ge'ez language, as well as <b>Amharic.</b> The Ethiopian monk Abba Gorgoryos (1595–1658), while lobbying the Propaganda Fide in Rome to become bishop of Ethiopia following his Catholic conversion and expulsion of the Jesuits by Ethiopian emperor Fasilides, collaborated with Ludolf – who never actually visited Ethiopia – and provided him with critical information for composing his Historia Aethiopica and its Commentaries. The ethnically-Ethiopian Portuguese cleric António d'Andrade (1610–1670) aided them as a translator, since Abba Gorgoryos was not a fluent speaker of either Latin or Italian. After Ludolf, the 18th-century Scottish travel writer James Bruce, who visited Ethiopia, and German orientalist August Dillmann (1823–1894) are also considered pioneers {{in the field of}} early Ethiopian studies. After spending time at the Ethiopian royal court, Bruce was the first to systematically collect and deposit Ethiopian historical documents into libraries of Europe, in addition to composing a history of Ethiopia based on native Ethiopian sources. Dillmann cataloged a variety of Ethiopian manuscripts, including historical chronicles, and in 1865 published the Lexicon Linguae Aethiopicae, the first such lexicon to be published on languages of Ethiopia since Ludolf's work.|$|E
5|$|The decisive {{victory of}} the Ethiopian Empire over the Kingdom of Italy in the 1896 Battle of Adwa, during the First Italo-Ethiopian War, made a {{profound}} impact on the historiography of Italy and Ethiopia. It was not lost to the collective memory of Italians, since the Italian capture of Adwa, Tigray Region, Ethiopia in 1935, during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, was hailed as an act that avenged their previous humiliation and defeat. Historiography about Ethiopia throughout much of the 20th century focused primarily on this second invasion and the Abyssinian Crisis that preceded it, in which Ethiopia was depicted as being relegated to the role of a pawn in European diplomacy. The Ethiopian courtier (i.e. blatta) and historian Marse Hazan Walda Qirqos (1899–1978) was commissioned by the Selassie regime to compile a documentary history of the Italian occupation entitled A Short History of the Five Years of Hardship, composed concurrently with the submission of historical evidence to the United Nations War Crimes Commission for Fascist Italy's war crimes. Coauthored by Berhanu Denque, this work {{was one of the first}} vernacular <b>Amharic</b> histories to cover the Italian colonial period, documenting contemporary newspaper articles and propaganda pieces, events such as the 1936 fall of Addis Ababa and the 1941 British-Ethiopian reconquest of the country, and speeches by key figures such as Emperor Selassie and Rodolfo Graziani (1882–1955), Viceroy of Italian East Africa.|$|E
25|$|Today, Ge'ez remains only as {{the main}} {{language}} used in the liturgy of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, the Ethiopian Catholic Church, the Eritrean Catholic Church, and the Beta Israel Jewish community. However, in Ethiopia, <b>Amharic</b> (the main lingua franca of modern Ethiopia) or other local languages, and in Eritrea and Tigray Region in Ethiopia, Tigrinya {{may be used for}} sermons. <b>Amharic,</b> Tigrinya, and Tigre are closely related to Ge'ez. Some linguists do not believe that Ge'ez constitutes the common ancestor of modern Ethiopian languages, but that Ge'ez became a separate language early on from some hypothetical, completely unattested language, and can thus be seen as an extinct sister language of <b>Amharic,</b> Tigre and Tigrinya. The foremost Ethiopian experts such as Amsalu Aklilu point to the vast proportion of inherited nouns that are unchanged, and even spelled identically in both Ge'ez and <b>Amharic</b> (and to a lesser degree, Tigrinya).|$|E
25|$|The {{most widely}} {{circulated}} newspapers in Ethiopia are Addis Fortune, Capital Ethiopia, Ethiopian Reporter, Addis Zemen (<b>Amharic)</b> and Ethiopian Herald.|$|E
25|$|English is {{the most}} widely spoken foreign language, and is the medium of {{instruction}} in secondary schools. <b>Amharic</b> was the language of primary school instruction, but has been replaced in many areas by regional languages such as Oromiffa, Somali or Tigrinya. While all languages enjoy equal state recognition in the 1995 Constitution of Ethiopia, <b>Amharic</b> is recognized as the official working language of the Federal Government. The various regions of Ethiopia and chartered cities are free to determine their own working languages. <b>Amharic</b> is recognised as the official working language of Amhara Region, Benishangul-Gumuz, Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region, Gambela Region, Addis Abeba and Dire Dawa, while Afar, Harari, Oromiffa, Somali and Tigrinya are recognized as official working languages in their respective regions.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Amharic</b> {{alphabet}} uses all {{the basic}} consonants plus the ones indicated below. Some of the Ge'ez labiovelar variants are also used.|$|E
25|$|Around 1930, the English {{typewriter}} {{was modified}} by Ayana Birru of Ethiopia to type an incomplete and ligated {{version of the}} <b>Amharic</b> alphabet.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, an Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) {{for grades}} 2 to 3 in six mother tongues (Afan Oromo, <b>Amharic,</b> Harari, Sidama, Somali and Tegrigna).|$|E
25|$|A second theater house, Tarbuta, seats 200. The Family Empowerment Center {{also runs}} a Drama-Therapy group for Ethiopian women that {{performs}} in Hebrew and <b>Amharic.</b>|$|E
25|$|Alternatively, {{alignment}} {{can also}} manifest visibly through {{agreement on the}} verb. In the following example from <b>Amharic,</b> the verb is head-marked for both subject ‘3SG.M’ and object ‘3SG.M.O’.|$|E
25|$|An avid reader, {{he was a}} keen {{student of}} {{languages}} and a man of vast ecumenical insights. He spoke fluent Arabic, English, Coptic and French, and read Greek, Latin and <b>Amharic.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ge'ez or Ethiopic {{has been}} {{computerized}} and assigned Unicode 3.0 codepoints between U+1200 and U+137F (decimal 4608–4991), containing the basic syllable signs for Ge'ez, <b>Amharic,</b> and Tigrinya, punctuation and numerals.|$|E
25|$|Primary {{education}} includes: Languages (mother tongue, <b>Amharic),</b> English, Mathematics, Environmental science, Natural science (Physics, Chemistry and Biology {{in grades}} 7 and 8), Social science (grades 5 to 8) and Aesthetic education.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the Semitic {{languages}} {{that had}} arrived from southern Arabia in the 8th century BC were diversifying in Ethiopia and Eritrea, where, under heavy Cushitic influence, they split {{into a number}} of languages, including <b>Amharic</b> and Tigrinya. With the expansion of Ethiopia under the Solomonic dynasty, <b>Amharic,</b> previously a minor local language, spread throughout much of the country, replacing both Semitic (such as Gafat) and non-Semitic (such as Weyto) languages, and replacing Ge'ez as the principal literary language (though Ge'ez remains the liturgical language for Christians in the region); this spread continues to this day, with Qimant set to disappear in another generation.|$|E
25|$|There are {{particular}} {{difficulties in}} trying to introduce mother-tongue teaching when the mother-tongue is only spoken by a small minority. In North Omo, there are eleven main ethnic groups with their own languages as well as non-tribal people speaking <b>Amharic.</b> Local languages do share common features but, since language is a marker of identity, no one language could be chosen. Attempts to introduce hybrid languages caused language riots, so the four main ethnic groups were allowed {{to use their own}} languages, but at that time, textbooks and teaching materials were only available in Wolaytta and a hybrid language. Some children were still disadvantaged if their mother-tongue differed from the local language because they were left with no language that could be used beyond the local area. Children whose mother-tongue was insufficiently developed for use in instruction could be taught in <b>Amharic.</b> Parents and children could dislike mother-tongue teaching because the mother-tongue could be learned at home while <b>Amharic</b> and English provided work opportunities and access to higher education.|$|E
25|$|Tigrinya {{is closely}} related to <b>Amharic</b> and Tigre, another Afroasiatic {{language}} spoken by the Tigre people as well as many Beja. Tigrinya and Tigre although close are not mutually intelligible, and while Tigrinya has traditionally been written using the same Ge'ez alphabet (fidel) as <b>Amharic,</b> Tigre has been transcribed mainly using the Arabic script. Attempts by the Eritrean government to have Tigre written using the Ge'ez script has met with some resistance from the predominantly Muslim Tigre people who associate Ge'ez with the Orthodox Church and would prefer the Arabic or the more neutral Latin alphabet. It has also met with the linguistic difficulty of the Ge'ez script being a syllabic system which does not distinguish long vowels from short ones. While this works well for writing Tigrinya or <b>Amharic,</b> which do not rely on vowel length in words, it does complicate writing Tigre, where vowel length sometimes distinguishes one word and its meaning from another. The Ge'ez script evolved from the Epigraphic South Arabian script, whose first inscriptions are from the 8th century BC in Eritrea, Ethiopia and Yemen.|$|E
25|$|Baking is done {{either on}} a {{specialized}} electric stove, or more commonly, on a large, black clay plate over a fire. This set-up is a stove called a mitad (ምጣድ) (in <b>Amharic)</b> or mogogo (ሞጎጎ) (in Tigrinya).|$|E
25|$|Ge'ez {{is written}} with Ethiopic or the Ge'ez abugida, a script that was {{originally}} developed specifically for this language. In languages that use it, such as <b>Amharic</b> and Tigrinya, the script is called , which means script or alphabet.|$|E
25|$|Hale {{has also}} written two books in Nepali that provide {{commentary}} on both the New Testament and Old Testament of the Bible. These books have been further translated into 30 different languages, including <b>Amharic,</b> Malagasy, Marathi, Serbian, Sinhalese and Yoruba.|$|E
25|$|Historically {{linked to}} the peninsular {{homeland}} of Old South Arabian, of which only one language, Razihi, remains, Ethiopia and Eritrea contain {{a substantial number of}} Semitic languages; the most widely spoken are <b>Amharic</b> in Ethiopia, Tigre in Eritrea, and Tigrinya in both. <b>Amharic</b> is the official language of Ethiopia. Tigrinya is a working language in Eritrea. Tigre is spoken by over one million people in the northern and central Eritrean lowlands and parts of eastern Sudan. A number of Gurage languages are spoken by populations in the semi-mountainous region of southwest Ethiopia, while Harari is restricted to the city of Harar. Ge'ez remains the liturgical language for certain groups of Christians in Ethiopia and in Eritrea.|$|E
25|$|As a child, Farah frequented {{schools in}} Somalia and {{adjacent}} Ethiopia, attending classes in Kallafo in the Ogaden. He studied English, Arabic and <b>Amharic.</b> In 1963, {{three years after}} Somalia's independence, {{he was forced to}} flee the Ogaden following serious border conflicts.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} {{majority}} of Israeli Jews are native Hebrew speakers, many Jewish immigrants still continue to speak their former languages—many immigrants from the Soviet Union continue to speak primarily Russian at home and many immigrants from Ethiopia continue to speak primarily <b>Amharic</b> at home.|$|E
25|$|By December 2014, {{the number}} of {{transmitters}} and frequencies used by VOA had been greatly reduced. VOA still uses shortwave transmissions to cover some areas of Africa and Asia. Shortwave broadcasts still take place in these languages: Afaan Oromoo, <b>Amharic,</b> Cantonese, Chinese, English, Indonesian, Korean and Swahili.|$|E
25|$|The OLF has {{offices in}} Washington, D.C. and Berlin {{and is a}} member of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization. It {{operates}} a shortwave radio station, SBO (Sagalee Bilisummaa Oromoo) or VOL (Voice of Oromo Liberation), in Berlin. VOL radio transmits in Afan Oromo as well as in <b>Amharic.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{most widely}} spoken Semitic {{languages}} today are (numbers given are for native speakers only) Arabic (300 million), <b>Amharic</b> (22 million), Tigrinya (7 million), Hebrew (unknown; 5 million native and non-native L1 speakers), Tigre (~1.05 million), Aramaic (575,000 to 1 million largely Assyrian fluent speakers) and Maltese (520,000 speakers).|$|E
25|$|The Beta Israel once spoke Qwara and Kayla, Agaw {{language}}s. Now {{they speak}} <b>Amharic</b> and Tigrinya, both Semitic languages. Their liturgical language is Ge'ez, also Semitic. Since the 1950s, they have taught Hebrew in their schools. Those Beta Israel {{residing in the}} State of Israel now use Modern Hebrew as a daily language.|$|E
25|$|Dating to the Renaissance, birdsong was the {{inspiration}} for some magical engineered languages, in particular musical languages. Whistled languages based on spoken natural languages are also {{sometimes referred to as}} the language of the birds. Some language games are also referred to as the language of birds, such as in Oromo and <b>Amharic</b> of Ethiopia.|$|E
25|$|The {{people of}} the region are dominantly Oromo-speaking farmers and cattle herders. The {{population}} of the entire Bale Zone is approximately 1.5 million. Afan Oromo is the official language of Oromia. It belongs to the Cushitic languages, {{and serves as a}} sort of lingua franca for over 25 million Oromos. However, most people in Bale Mountains speak some <b>Amharic.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Idan Raichel Project, a {{successful}} pop/ethnic group {{formed in the}} 2000s, merges Ethiopian and Western music. Raichel collaborated with Ethiopian Jewish immigrants to produce a unique sound, combining Electronic music sounds, classic piano, electric guitar, traditional drums and Ethiopian-style singing, with its complex quartertone scales and rhythms. The songs are sung in a combination of Hebrew and <b>Amharic.</b>|$|E
25|$|For Ge'ez, <b>Amharic,</b> Tigrinya and Tigre, {{the usual}} sort order is called halehame (h–l–ħ–m). Where the labiovelar {{variants}} are used, these come {{immediately after the}} basic consonant and are followed by other variants. In Tigrinya, for example, the letters based on ከ come in this order: ከ, ኰ, ኸ, ዀ. In Blin, the sorting order is slightly different.|$|E
25|$|The Tigrayans in Ethiopia, {{they are}} {{referred}} to as simply Tägaru in Tigrinya, and Tɘgre in <b>Amharic.</b> Tigray-Tigrinyas of Muslim faith are commonly referred to as the Jeberti people. Historically, {{the people who live in}} the highlands found between Red Sea and Tekezé River were referred as Tigré people by foreign scholars who traveled in the region like James Bruce and Henry Salt.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{concepts}} {{important to the}} Chomskyan (or generativist) approach to linguistics. The most fundamental of these ideas is the theory of universal grammar (UG). Simply put, and as implied by the name, UG refers to those grammatical properties thought to be shared by all (to be universal to all) derivations of human language (anything from <b>Amharic</b> to Zhuang).|$|E
25|$|In 1889, the Italians {{signed the}} Treaty of Wuchale with then Negus Menelik of Shewa. The treaty ceded territories {{previously}} part of Ethiopia, namely {{the provinces of}} Bogos, Hamasien, Akkele Guzay, Serae, and parts of Tigray. In return, Italy promised Menelik the second's rule, financial assistance and military supplies. A dispute later arose over {{the interpretation of the}} two versions of the document. The Italian-language version of the disputed Article 17 of the treaty stated that the Emperor of Ethiopia was obliged to conduct all foreign affairs through Italian authorities. This would in effect make Ethiopia a protectorate of the Kingdom of Italy. The <b>Amharic</b> version of the article however stated that the Emperor could use the good offices of the Kingdom of Italy in his relations with foreign nations if he wished. However, the Italian diplomats claimed that the original <b>Amharic</b> text included the clause and that Menelik II knowingly signed a modified copy of the Treaty.|$|E
