50|$|Garlic is crushed in {{a mortar}} and pestle and {{emulsified}} with egg yolks, salt, and olive oil. Today, aioli is often made in <b>a</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> <b>or</b> <b>blender,</b> but traditionalists object that this does not give the same result.|$|E
5000|$|Fresh {{or frozen}} blueberries, and {{sometimes}} wild blueberries are used. The sauce is prepared by mixing the ingredients using <b>a</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> <b>or</b> <b>blender</b> and then heating {{them until the}} sauce reduces and thickens. [...] It may be prepared to have a smooth or chunky texture. Straining the sauce using a sieve to remove particulate matter creates a smooth texture. It can be preserved by freezing for later use.|$|E
50|$|Emulsified {{sausages}} {{are cooked}} sausages {{with a very}} fine texture, using the combination of pork, beef, or poultry with fat, salt, cure, flavorings, and water. These ingredients are emulsified at high speed in <b>a</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> <b>or</b> <b>blender.</b> During this process, the salt dissolves the muscle proteins, which helps to suspend the fat molecules. Temperature {{is an important part}} of the process: if the temperature rises above 60°F (16°C) for pork or 70°F (21°C) for beef, the emulsion will not hold and fat will leak from the sausage during the cooking process.|$|E
25|$|Oat flour can {{be ground}} for small scale use by pulsing rolled oats or old-fashioned (not quick) oats in <b>a</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> <b>or</b> spice mill.|$|R
50|$|The {{ingredients}} are ground in <b>a</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor,</b> <b>or</b> with <b>a</b> mortar and pestle, or {{in a large}} earthenware basin with a wooden stick. The mix should {{be reduced to a}} powder that resembles fine cornmeal.|$|R
50|$|Bisque is also {{commonly}} used, although incorrectly, {{to refer}} to cream-based soups that do not contain seafood, in which the sometimes pre-cooked ingredients are pureed <b>or</b> processed in <b>a</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>food</b> mill. Common varieties include squash, tomato, mushroom, popcorn, and red pepper.|$|R
50|$|Many small {{appliances}} are powered by electricity. The appliance may use a permanently attached cord which is plugged {{into a wall}} outlet or a detachable cord. The appliance may have a cord storage feature. A few hand-held appliances use batteries, which may be disposable or rechargeable. Some appliances consist of an electrical motor upon which is mounted various attachments so as to constitute several individual appliances, such as <b>a</b> blender, <b>a</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor,</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> juicer. Many stand mixers, while functioning primarily as a mixer, have attachments which can perform additional functions.|$|R
50|$|Proximates {{are used}} in the {{analysis}} of biological materials as a decomposition of a human-consumable good into its major constituents. They are a good approximation of the contents of packaged comestible goods and serve as a cheap and easy verification of nutritional panels i.e. testing can be used to verify lots, but {{can not be used to}} validate <b>a</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> <b>or</b> <b>food</b> processing facility: <b>a</b> nutritional assay must be conducted on the product to qualify said producers. Nutritional panels in the United States are regulated by the FDA and must undergo rigorous testing to ensure the exact and precise content of nutrients in order to prevent <b>a</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> from making unfounded claims to the public.|$|R
50|$|Banana cake is {{prepared}} using banana {{as a primary}} ingredient and typical cake ingredients such as flour, sugar, eggs, butter, margarine or oil and baking soda. The bananas can be mashed <b>or</b> puréed using <b>a</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> <b>or</b> electric mixer and mixed into the cake batter, and the cake can also be topped or garnished with sliced bananas. Banana cake may be prepared as a use for browned or overly-ripe bananas. Chocolate {{may be used as}} an ingredient, which along with the banana is an enjoyable flavor combination for some people. Nuts such as walnuts and macadamias may be used in the batter and to top and garnish the cake.|$|R
50|$|To make poppy milk, one or {{two glasses}} of poppy seeds are needed. The poppy seeds are soaked in some hot water {{for a day or}} so, {{changing}} the water from time to time, until the seeds become soft. Then the poppy seeds are crushed in <b>a</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> (<b>or</b> with <b>a</b> pestle in a mortar), until a white liquid comes out. Some cold water is added (preferably water that has been boiled, and cooled), and the poppy seeds are strained and crushed once more. This process is repeated several times {{in order to get a}} good poppy milk concentrate. Then, the poppy milk concentrate is diluted with some cold boiled water (the quantity of the water used, is a matter of taste, and certain family preferences, but the flavor of the poppy seeds should be pronounced). Finally, some sugar or honey is added to sweeten the poppy seed milk.|$|R
50|$|Copyright {{does not}} exist in a work that is a method of {{operation}}. According to Lotus v. Borland, a method of operation refers to the means by which a person operates something, whether it is <b>a</b> car, <b>food</b> <b>processor,</b> <b>or</b> computer. In that case, Lotus claimed copyright in its computer menu command hierarchy. The court held that even though the menu developer made some expressive choices in choosing and arranging the Lotus command terms, the menu was a method of operation. The menu did not just explain and present the functional capabilities; it also served as the method by which the program was operated and controlled. In fact, Lotus wrote its menu command hierarchy so that people could learn it and use it.|$|R
50|$|<b>Food</b> <b>processors</b> {{are similar}} to blenders in many forms. The primary {{difference}} is that <b>food</b> <b>processors</b> use interchangeable blades and disks (attachments) rather than a fixed blade. Also, their bowls are wider and shorter, a more proper shape for the solid or semi-solid foods usually worked in <b>a</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor.</b> Usually, little <b>or</b> no liquid is required {{in the operation of}} the <b>food</b> <b>processor,</b> unlike <b>a</b> blender, which requires a certain amount of liquid for the particles to move around the blade.|$|R
50|$|These laws vary {{significantly}} {{from state to}} state, but food libel laws typically allow <b>a</b> <b>food</b> manufacturer <b>or</b> <b>processor</b> to sue a person or group who makes disparaging comments about their food products. In some states these laws also establish different standards of proof than are used in traditional American libel lawsuits, including the practice of placing {{the burden of proof}} on the party being sued.|$|R
5000|$|The {{shortening}} method, {{also known}} as the biscuit method, is used for biscuits and scones. This method cuts solid fat (whether lard, butter, or vegetable shortening) into flour and other dry ingredients using <b>a</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor,</b> pastry blender, <b>or</b> two hand-held forks. The layering from this process gives rise and adds flakiness as the folds of fat melt during baking. This technique is said to produce [...] "shortened" [...] cakes and breads, {{regardless of whether or not}} the chosen fat is vegetable shortening.|$|R
5|$|Myriad {{additional}} ingredients can be used, including onion, {{roasted red}} bell pepper, {{red and green}} chili peppers, cilantro, lime, lime juice and lime zest, lemon juice, sour cream, oil, lard, vinegar and apple cider vinegar, water, and spices such as garlic, cumin, coriander, chili powder and cayenne, hot sauce, salt and pepper. The various ingredients can be mixed or puréed together using <b>a</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor,</b> <b>a</b> blender, <b>or</b> by hand. Bean dip is sometimes topped with shredded cheese and garnished with ingredients such as chopped cilantro, chopped green onion, chopped fresh or dried parsley and lime zest, among others.|$|R
5000|$|Kappa Kappa Tau's [...] "Hell Week" [...] continues, as it welcomes Detective Chisolm (Jim Clock) and Denise Hemphill (Niecy Nash), {{the latter}} is a {{security}} guard hired by Gigi Caldwell (Nasim Pedrad) who has odd methods to protect the girls from the killer, and the former is an incompetent police detective who has a history with the dean. The Chanels still don't {{know what to do with}} Chanel #2 (Ariana Grande)'s body, and are worried that they will be blamed if someone finds it. Chanel #3 (Billie Lourd) and Chanel #5 (Abigail Breslin) propose to feed the body to pigs. Then, Hester (Lea Michele) walks in and suggests to put her in <b>a</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor</b> <b>or</b> to bone her, disturbing the others with her obsession with death. Chanel rejects all the ideas and decides to put the body in the same freezer where they put Ms. Bean (Jan Hoag)'s body. Hester promises to keep the secret of Number 2's death only if she can call Chanel [...] "Mom". Grace (Skyler Samuels) is in the house basement, where she finds a mysterious locked door and tries to open it but Chanel #5 catches her and says that only Chanel has the key to that door. Grace tells Pete (Diego Boneta) about the secret door, who says that people have been said for years that the Kappa house has a really dark secret. This makes him think that Dean Cathy Munsch (Jamie Lee Curtis)'s office may have some archives that can explain that secret, so they both think at the same time that they will have to break in. They start kissing passionately but Grace stops him, saying that they can't kiss if there is a killer on the campus of Wallace University. They both agree that she will break into that secret door at Kappa house and he will break into the dean's office.|$|R

50|$|Graters produce shreds {{that are}} thinner {{at the ends}} than the middle. This allows the grated {{material}} to melt or cook in a different manner than the shreds of mostly uniform thickness produced by the grating blade of <b>a</b> <b>food</b> <b>processor.</b> Hand-grated potatoes, for example, melt together more easily in a potato pancake than food-processed potato shreds.|$|R
