25|$|In {{addition}} to all the training usually given to Chemical Technologists in their respective degree (or one given via an associate degree), a Chemist is also trained to understand more details related to chemical phenomena so that the chemist can be capable of more planning on the steps to achieve a distinct goal via a chemistry-related endeavor. The higher the competency level achieved {{in the field of}} Chemistry (as assessed via a combination of education, experience and personal achievements), the higher the responsibility given to that chemist and the more complicated the task might be. Chemistry, as a field, have so many applications that different tasks/objectives can be given to workers/scientists with these different levels of education and/or experience. The specific title of each job varies from position to position, depending on factors such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of industry, the routine level of the task, the current needs of a particular enterprise, the size of the enterprise or hiring firm, the philosophy and management principles of the hiring firm, the visibility of the competency and individual achievements of the one seeking employment, economic factors such as recession or economic depression, among other factors, so this makes it difficult to categorize the exact roles of these chemistry-related workers as standard for that given level of education. Because of these factors affecting exact job titles with distinct responsibilities, some chemists might begin doing technician tasks while other chemists might begin doing more complicated tasks than those of a technician, such as tasks that also involve formal applied research, management, or supervision included within the responsibilities of that same job title. The level of supervision given to that chemist also varies in a similar manner, with factors similar to those that affect the tasks demanded for a particular chemist.|$|E

At the same time, attitudes towards Scott were gradually changing as a more critical note was sounded in the literature, culminating in Roland Huntford's 1979 treatment of him in his dual biography Scott and Amundsen, described by Barczewski as a [...] "devastating attack".

500|$|He {{claims that}} Cochrane's {{argument}} is invalid because {{it assumes that}} nonhuman animals are harmed by being owned {{only if they are}} killed or have suffering inflicted on them and because it assumes that ownership is permissible when it does not compromise the interests of the particular owned animal.

The philosopher Friederike Schmitz draws upon Wyckoff's argument in her challenge to Cochrane, arguing that it is necessary not only to consider whether ownership will harm animals in particular cases, but to explore the effects of the institution of animal ownership.|$|E

Scunthorpe manager Nigel Adkins said that he thought Hooper was a [...] "massive threat" [...] to the opposition and that he was worried that other teams would try to sign him {{before the end of the}} transfer window.

This was just after Hooper had scored in a 2–2 draw with Watford, taking his seasonal tally to 13.

2500|$|Turner {{sought to}} {{capitalize}} on WCW's momentum by launching a new Thursday night show on TBS, WCW Thunder, in January 1998. Popular opinion was that the Screwjob and WCW's subsequent acquisition of Hart were death blows for the WWF. WCW had a golden opportunity to capture the allegiances of WWF fans who were disenchanted with the company after its poor treatment of a popular star. But according to Hart, the company failed {{to capitalize on}} his talent and momentum, and {{had no idea how}} to properly utilize him. Vince McMahon had described Hart <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of wrestler who a promoter builds his whole company around, but WCW generally used him as a midcarder.

2500|$|Theories of the {{composition}} of the book have been harpooned in three ways, first by raising objections against the use of evidence and the evidence itself. Scholar Robert Milder sees [...] "insufficient evidence and doubtful methodology" [...] at work. John Bryant finds [...] "little concrete evidence, and nothing at all conclusive, to show that Melville radically altered the structure or conception of the book". A second type of objection is based upon Melville's intellectual development. Bezanson is not convinced that before he met Hawthorne, [...] "Melville was not ready for the kind of book Moby-Dick became", because in his letters from the time Melville denounces his last two [...] "straight narratives, Redburn and White-Jacket, as two books written just for the money, and he firmly stood by Mardi <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of book he believed in. His language is already [...] "richly steeped in 17th-century mannerisms", characteristics of Moby-Dick. A third type calls upon the literary nature of passages used as evidence. According to Milder, the cetological chapters cannot be leftovers from an earlier stage of composition and any theory that they are [...] "will eventually founder on the stubborn meaningfulness of these chapters", because no scholar adhering to the theory has yet explained how these chapters [...] "can bear intimate thematic relation to a symbolic story not yet conceived". Buell finds that theories based on a combination of selected passages from letters and what are perceived as [...] "loose ends" [...] in the book not only [...] "tend to dissolve into guesswork", but he also suggests that these so-called loose ends may be intended by the author: repeatedly the book mentions [...] "the necessary unfinishedness of immense endeavors".
