5|$|Ebert was <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>advocate</b> for Maxivision 48, {{in which}} the movie {{projector}} runs at 48 frames per second, {{as compared to the}} usual 24 frames per second. He was opposed to the practice whereby theatres lower the intensity of their projector bulbs in order to extend the life of the bulb, arguing that this has little effect other than to make the film harder to see.

50|$|Many of Calder's {{recommendations}} {{were included in}} the important Highways and Vehicles Act of 1924, which provided for the declaration of State highways, two-thirds financed by the State government through the C.R.B. This network of highways is perhaps Calder's main achievement: the Calder Highway, the road to Bendigo and Mildura was named after him. The Country roads Board's system of organization was copied in other States, New Zealand and Fiji.

5|$|Between 1893 and 1897, {{the years}} when Bauer and Nold were also in the Western Penitentiary for their part in the {{assassination}} attempt, the three men surreptitiously produced 60 issues of a hand-written anarchist newsletter by transferring their work from cell to cell.

5|$|Ferraro's first {{full-time}} political job came in , {{when she}} was appointed Assistant District Attorney for Queens County, New York, by her cousin, District Attorney Nicholas Ferraro. At the time, women prosecutors in the city were uncommon. Grumblings {{that she was the}} beneficiary of nepotism were countered by her being rated as qualified by a screening committee and by her early job performance in the Investigations Bureau. The following year, Ferraro was assigned to the new Special Victims Bureau, which prosecuted cases involving rape, child abuse, spouse abuse, and domestic violence. She was named head of the unit in 1977, with two other assistant district attorneys assigned to her. In this role, she became <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>advocate</b> for abused children.

5|$|From {{his first}} term in Congress, McKinley was <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>advocate</b> of {{protective}} tariffs. The primary purposes of such imposts was not to raise revenue, but to allow American manufacturing to develop by giving it a price advantage in the domestic market over foreign competitors. McKinley biographer Margaret Leech noted that Canton had become prosperous as a center for the manufacture of farm equipment because of protection, and that this may have helped form his political views. McKinley introduced and supported bills that raised protective tariffs, and opposed those that lowered them or imposed tariffs simply to raise revenue. Garfield's election as president in 1880 created a vacancy on the House Ways and Means Committee; McKinley was selected to fill it, placing him on the most powerful committee after only two terms.|$|E

The industrial north-east of England, including County Durham, was badly affected by an economic depression. Henson was opposed to strikes, trade unions and socialism, and for a time his forthright expression of his views made him unpopular in the diocese. His opinions about some Church matters changed radically during his career: at first <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>advocate</b> of the Church of England's continued establishment as the country's official church, he came to believe that politicians could not be trusted to legislate properly on ecclesiastical matters, and he espoused the cause of disestablishment. He campaigned against efforts to introduce prohibition, exploitation of foreign workers by British companies, and fascist and Nazi aggression, and supported reform of the divorce laws, a controversial revision of the Book of Common Prayer and ecumenism.|$|E

5000|$|Throughout {{his career}} in politics, Gilpin was <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> believer that the American West would not only be settled but also {{eventually}} hold an enormous population. He was <b>a</b> particularly <b>strong</b> <b>advocate</b> of the now-debunked climatological theory of [...] "Rain follows the plow". This theory held that settlement in the arid lands of the West would actually increase rainfall in the region, making it as fertile and green as the Eastern United States.|$|R
5000|$|Staffing {{interviews}} {{for the magazine}} were held in August 1978; by early September, three people were {{set up in the}} CAHRO national office in Fredericton, New Brunswick working on the first issue of Impact.During its six-year history, Impact communicated CAHRO's responses to government housing policies and positions, voiced housing-related issues and policies emerging at the municipal level, and published articles and opinions from across the country. In 1984, CAHRO moved to a national office in Ottawa and hired Heather Lang-Runtz as executive director and editor. With this move came the decision to create a national housing magazine that would not only disseminate information to members, but would also help increase the organization's capacity to attract new members and become <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> <b>advocate</b> for improved housing in Canada.|$|R
5|$|One of Dellinger's assistants, {{hired in}} 1975, Tom Heinonen, was {{promoted}} to the head coach for the women's cross country and track and field team in 1977. Prior to Heinonen, no other full-time head coach at Oregon had exclusively coached the women's disciplines. He was <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>advocate</b> for women's sports and was a force in making the Oregon Twilight Meet a co-ed event.

5|$|Speer's {{supporters}} {{maintained a}} continual call for his release. Among those who pledged support for Speer's sentence to be commuted were Charles de Gaulle, U.S. diplomat George Ball, former U.S. High Commissioner John J. McCloy, and former Nuremberg prosecutor Hartley Shawcross. Willy Brandt was <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>advocate</b> of Speer's, supporting his release, sending flowers {{to his daughter}} {{on the day of}} his release, and putting an end to the de-Nazification proceedings against Speer, which could have caused his property to be confiscated. A reduced sentence required the consent of all four of the occupying powers, and the Soviets adamantly opposed any such proposal. Speer served his full sentence, and was released at midnight on October1, 1966.|$|E
5|$|The Tyler-Texas {{treaty was}} in its final stages when its chief architects, Secretary Upshur and Secretary of the Navy Thomas W. Gilmer, died in an {{accident}} aboard USS Princeton on February 28, 1844, just a day after achieving a preliminary treaty draft agreement with the Texas Republic. The Princeton disaster proved a major setback for Texas annexation, in that Tyler expected Secretary Upshur to elicit critical support from Whig and Democratic Senators during the upcoming treaty ratification process. Tyler selected John C. Calhoun to replace Upshur as Secretary of State and to finalize the treaty with Texas. The choice of Calhoun, a highly regarded but controversial American statesman, risked introducing a politically polarizing element into the Texas debates, but Tyler prized him as <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>advocate</b> of annexation.|$|E
