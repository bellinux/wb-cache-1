2500|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, the government's unwillingness to grant {{immediate}} citizenship to all Indians reflected prevailing views among many {{politicians and the}} American public that Indians were not worthy of citizenship and should therefore not be entrusted with the responsibilities accorded citizens. Reformers chose wardship as the problem and fought for US citizenship for full participation in American life. Arthur C. Parker, {{a founding member of}} the Society of American Indians, characterized the anti-Indian tenor among politicians noting, [...] "one senator wrote me that there was a great deal of prejudice in considering Indian matters and reluctance to take them on." [...] In 1906, Congress passed the Burke Act, an amendment to the Dawes Act, which gave the U.S. Secretary of the Interior the ability to grant fee-simple titles to any land <b>allottee</b> [...] "competent and capable of managing his or her affairs." [...] The intent of the Act was to accelerate Indian assimilation and citizenship, and stipulated that every Indian who received a fee-simple title immediately became a citizen of the United States. However, the Act delayed citizenship for most Indians until the end of a 25-year trust period, citing as the primary reason Indians' unpreparedness for citizenship. McKenzie criticized the legislation for postponing citizenship of the majority of Indians for another generation, and argued that citizenship for the Indian meant opening the door of hope and self-responsibility.|$|E

50|$|Section 5 of the Dawes Act {{required}} the United States to “hold the land thus allotted, {{for the period}} of twenty-five years, in trust for the sole use and benefit of the Indian to whom such allotment shall have been made…” During the trust period, individual accounts were to be set up for each Indian with a stake in the allotted lands, and the lands would be managed {{for the benefit of the}} individual <b>allottees.</b> Indians could not sell, lease, or otherwise encumber their allotted lands without government approval. Where the tribes resisted allotment, it could be imposed. After twenty-five years, the allotted lands would become subject to taxation. Many <b>allottees</b> did not understand the tax system, or did not have the money to pay the taxes, and lost their lands at that time.|$|R

50|$|For {{nearly one}} hundred years, the {{consequences}} of federal Indian allotments have developed into the problem of fractionation.

50|$|Competency {{was used}} to {{determine}} whether individual Native Americans could use land that was allotted to them from the General Allotment Act (GAA) also known as the Dawes Act. The practice was used after in 1906 with the passing of the Burk Act, also known as the forced patenting act. This Act further amended the GAA to give the Secretary of the Interior the power to issue allotees a patent in fee simple to people classified ‘competent and capable.’ The criteria for this determination is unclear but meant that allotees deemed ‘competent’ by the Secretary of the Interior would have their land taken out of trust status, subject to taxation, and could be sold by the <b>allottee.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{government}} would retain the title handed {{out through the}} General Allotment Act for 25 years. [...] This time period intended on doing two things. First, it would protect the <b>allottee</b> from immediately having to pay state taxes. Second, the land owner would learn how to manage his land and affairs. [...] However, after the 25 years was up, many Indians found themselves subject to excessive state property taxes, {{which resulted in the}} sale of much of the land which Indians received through the Dawes Act. [...] Very soon after many of the Indians losing the land which they earned through the Dawes Act, white settlers moved in on these open lots. This created a checkerboard effect, and made it nearly impossible to have sizable gains in farming and grazing.|$|E
50|$|Once the <b>allottees</b> {{have been}} settled, the housing agency could {{hand over the}} scheme to a {{non-governmental}} organization (NGO) and the NGO could organize the communities, train leaders, assist the population to save money for infrastructure and advise the community to construct the infrastructure on a self-help basis, as is being done in the Orangi Pilot Project, Karachi.|$|R
5000|$|... {{individual}} <b>allottees</b> {{who would}} die intestate would encumber the land under prevailing state devisement laws, leading to complex patterns of heirship. Congress {{has attempted to}} mollify the impact of heirship by granting tribes the capacity to acquire fragmented allotments owing to heirship by financial grants. Tribes may also include such parcels in long-range land use planning.|$|R
2500|$|The Muscogee (Creek) Nation did not reorganize and regain federal {{recognition}} until 1970. In 1979 {{the tribe}} ratified {{a new constitution}} that replaced the 1866 constitution.
