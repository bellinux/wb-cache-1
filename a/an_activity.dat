40|$|SummaryDeletion of UBE 3 A {{causes the}} neurodevelopmental {{disorder}} Angelman syndrome (AS), while duplication or triplication of UBE 3 A {{is linked to}} autism. These genetic {{findings suggest that the}} ubiquitin ligase activity of UBE 3 A must be tightly maintained to promote normal brain development. Here, we found that protein kinase A (PKA) phosphorylates UBE 3 A in a region outside of the catalytic domain at residue T 485 and inhibits UBE 3 <b>A</b> <b>activity</b> toward itself and other substrates. A de novo autism-linked missense mutation disrupts this phosphorylation site, causing enhanced UBE 3 <b>A</b> <b>activity</b> in vitro, enhanced substrate turnover in patient-derived cells, and excessive dendritic spine development in the brain. Our study identifies PKA as an upstream regulator of UBE 3 <b>A</b> <b>activity</b> and shows that <b>an</b> autism-linked mutation disrupts this phosphorylation control. Moreover, our findings implicate excessive UBE 3 <b>A</b> <b>activity</b> and the resulting synaptic dysfunction to autism pathogenesis...|$|R
40|$|In {{pregnant}} women, CYP 3 <b>A</b> <b>activity</b> increases by 100 % {{during the}} third trimester (T 3). Due to logistical and ethical constraints, {{little is known about}} the magnitude of CYP 3 A induction during the first trimester (T 1) and second trimester (T 2). Our laboratory has shown that sandwich-cultured human hepatocytes (SCHH) and HepaRG cells have the potential to predict themagnitude of in vivo induction of CYP 3 <b>A</b> <b>activity</b> likely to be observed in T 1 and T 2. Therefore, we incubated SCHH and HepaRG cells with plasma concentrations of various pregnancy-related hormones (PRHs) —individually or in combination—observed during T 1, T 2, or T 3 in pregnant women. Then, CYP 3 <b>A</b> <b>activity</b> was measured by 19 -OH-midazolam formation. In all three trimesters, only cortisol (C) consistently and significantly induced CYP 3 <b>A</b> <b>activity,</b> while other individual hormones (progesterone, estradiol, or growth hor-mones) failed to induce CYP 3 <b>A</b> <b>activity.</b> At physiologically relevant 13 plasma concentrations, the magnitude of CYP 3 A induction by C or the combination of all PRHs did not change significantly with gestational age. The pattern of induction of CYP 3 <b>A</b> <b>activity</b> in SCHH by the hormones was similar to that in HepaRG cells. Based on these data, we conclude that C remains themajor inducer of CYP 3 <b>A</b> <b>activity</b> earlier in gestation. Moreover, we predict that the magnitude of CYP 3 A induction during T 1 and T 2 will be similar to that observed during T 3 (∼ 100 % increase versus postpartum). This prediction is consistent with the observation of similar increases in T 2 and T 3 oral clearance of indinavir (a CYP 3 A cleared drug) versus postpartum...|$|R
40|$|CYP 3 <b>A</b> <b>activity</b> is {{induced by}} {{approximately}} 2 -fold {{during the third}} trimester of human pregnancy. Placental growth hormone (PGH), estrogens (primarily 17 b-estradiol), cortisol, and pro-gesterone {{have the potential to}} modulate CYP 3 <b>A</b> <b>activity.</b> There-fore, we determined whether the elevated plasma concentrations of these hormones during pregnancy induce hepatic CYP 3 A ex-pression. We incubated sandwich-cultured human hepatocytes (SCHH) from premenopausal female donors (n = 2) with the physiologic (unbound, 13 total) and the 103 total third trimester hormone plasma concentrations (individually and in combination) and determined their effect on CYP 3 <b>A</b> <b>activity</b> and the transcripts of CYP 3 A 4, CYP 3 A 5, and the respective hormone receptors (growth hormone receptor, glucocorticoid receptor, and estro-gen receptor alpha). Of all the hormones, cortisol was the most potent inducer of CYP 3 <b>A</b> <b>activity</b> and CYP 3 A 4, CYP 3 A 5 mRNA expression. The combination of PGH/growth hormone and cortisol induced CYP 3 <b>A</b> <b>activity</b> and expression significantly more than did cortisol alone. When incubated with the unbound or total plasma concentration of all the hormones, CYP 3 <b>A</b> <b>activity</b> in SCHH was induced to an extent comparable to that observed in vivo during the third trimester. These hormones had only a modest effect on the mRNA expression of the hormone receptors. The pattern of induction observed in SCHH was reproduced in HepaRG cells but not in HuH 7 / HepG 2 cells. SCHH or HepaRG cells could be used to determine the mechanistic basis of CYP 3 A induction during pregnancy and to predict the magnitude of induction likely to be observed during the first and second trimesters, when phenotyping studies to measure in vivo CYP 3 <b>A</b> <b>activity</b> are logistically difficult to perform...|$|R
