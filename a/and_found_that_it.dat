Compton discussed with Eugene Wigner from Princeton University how plutonium might be produced in a nuclear reactor, and with Robert Serber how the plutonium produced in a reactor might be separated from uranium.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, James Patton, Maria da Silva, and Jay Malcolm {{reported}} on mammals {{collected at the}} Rio Juruá in western Brazil. In this report, they provided further information on the Oryzomys species reviewed by Musser and colleagues, including sequence data from the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. Their analysis reaffirmed that O.emmonsae was a distinct species <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was closest to O.macconnelli and O.russatus, differing from both by about 12% in the cytochrome b sequence; O.nitidus was more distantly related, differing by 14.7%. The average sequence difference between the three O.emmonsae studied was 0.8%.|$|E
5|$|In Nicotiana attenuata HypSys {{is known}} to not be {{involved}} in defence against insect herbivores. Silencing and over-expression of HypSys {{does not affect the}} feeding performance of larvae compared to normal plants. Berger silenced HypSys <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> caused changes in flower morphology which reduced the efficiency of self-pollination. The flowers had pistils that protruded beyond their anthers, a similar phenotype to CORONATINE-INSENSITIVE1-silenced plants which lack a jasmonate receptor. Measurement of jasmonate levels in the flowers revealed that they were lower than in normal plants. The authors suggested that HypSys peptides in N. attenuata have diversified from their function as defence related peptides to being involved in controlling flower morphology. The signalling processes remain similar however, being mediated through jasmonates.|$|E

5|$|Increasing {{costs and}} {{concerns}} over the ships' design led to the cancellation of the DDL project. The Department of Defence observed that the DDL's costs were escalating and it was unable to finalise the design. The Navy also reviewed the project <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was unduly expensive, and a Joint Parliamentary committee concluded that a unique Australian design entailed significant technological risks. As a result, the Navy recommended to the Government that the DDL project be cancelled, and this took place in August 1973. The cost of the project to the Navy had been A$1.7 million, most of which was spent on design investigations and management consultancies. The opposition Liberal Party opposed the decision to cancel the DDL project.|$|E
5|$|Niels Bohr and John Wheeler had {{theorized that}} heavy {{isotopes}} with odd atomic mass numbers were fissile. If so, then plutonium-239 {{was likely to}} be. In May 1941, Emilio Segrè and Glenn Seaborg at the University of California produced 28 μg of plutonium in the 60-inch cyclotron there, <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had 1.7 times the thermal neutron capture cross section of uranium-235. At the time only such minute quantities of plutonium-239 had been produced, in cyclotrons, {{and it was not}} possible to produce a sufficiently large quantity that way. Compton discussed with Wigner how plutonium might be produced in a nuclear reactor, and with Robert Serber about how that plutonium might be separated from uranium. His report, submitted in November, stated that a bomb was feasible.|$|E
5|$|While Roberts had {{a natural}} talent for riding {{motorcycles}} on dirt surfaces, on paved road circuits, the motorcycle felt unsettled beneath him while negotiating a turn. During a race at the Ontario Motor Speedway, he observed Finnish rider Jarno Saarinen using a riding style where {{he shifted his}} body weight towards {{the inside of a}} turn. Roberts tried the technique <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> helped settle the motorcycle. He adopted the cornering style and exaggerated the body shift {{to a greater extent than}} Saarinen had by extending his knee out until it skimmed the track surface. With his new riding technique, Roberts began to excel in road race events. Yamaha motorcycles performed very well in road racing, where the Yamaha TZ750 was the dominant motorcycle of the era.|$|E

5|$|A {{corporation}} called RX Tech excavates {{the crash}} site of a meteorite that impacted on Antarctica {{millions of years ago}} and finds strange Rapa Nui-like statues alongside the grave of one of HMS Beagle's sailors. Meanwhile, archaeologist-adventurer Lara Croft is searching for an artefact known as the Infada Stone in the ruins of an ancient Indian Hindu temple once inhabited by the Infada tribe. After taking the artefact from a researcher working for RX Tech, Lara is approached by RX Tech scientist Dr. Willard, who explains that polynesians came across a meteorite crater in Antarctica thousands of years ago <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> held incredible power. Using rock from the meteorite, they crafted four crystalline artefacts, one of which is the Infada Stone. They then fled Antarctica for unknown reasons, but in the 19th century a group of sailors travelling with Charles Darwin came to Antarctica and rediscovered the artefacts. The four artefacts were then distributed across the globe. Dr. Willard has been able to track the artefacts by using the diary of one of the sailors. Lara agrees to help him find the other three.|$|E
5|$|A later 1994 {{study by}} Novas instead {{classified}} Herrerasaurus within Dinosauria, and strongly supported its position within Saurischia, as well a provided synapomorphies shared with Theropoda. Novas {{found that the}} primitive features of lacking a brevis fossa and having only two sacral vertebrae were simply reversals found in the genus. In 1996, Novas went further by supporting a theropod position for Herrerasaurus with a phylogenetic analysis, which placed it closer to Neotheropoda than Eoraptor or Sauropodomorpha. Langer (2004) mentioned that this hypothesis was widely accepted, but that more later authors instead preferred to place Herrerasaurus as well as Eoraptor basal to Theropoda and Sauropodomorpha, a clade called Eusaurischia. Langer (2004) conducted a phylogenetic analysis, <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was much more likely that Herrerasaurus was a basal saurischian, than either a theropod or a non-dinosaurian. Langer's proposal was supported by multiple studies until the discovery of Tawa, when Nesbitt et al. conducted a more inclusive analysis, and the resulting cladogram placed Herrerasauridae basal to Eoraptor, but closer to Dilophosaurus than Sauropodomorpha. Unlike Nesbitt, Ezcurra (2010) conducted a phylogenetic analysis to place his new taxon Chromogisaurus, and found that Herrerasauridae was basal to Eusaurischia.|$|E
5|$|By 1850, it was {{no longer}} {{profitable}} for the Mint to strike cents, and on May 14, New York Senator Daniel S. Dickinson introduced legislation for a cent made out of billon, copper {{with a small amount of}} silver. At the time, it was widely felt that coins should contain a large proportion of their face value in metal. The coin would be annular; that is, it would have a hole in the middle. The Mint struck experimental pieces, <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was difficult to eject such pieces from the presses where they were struck, and that it was expensive to recover the silver from the alloy. Provisions for a smaller cent were dropped from the legislation that gave congressional approval for the three-cent piece in 1851. Numismatic historian Walter Breen suggested that one factor in rejecting the holed coins was that they reminded many of Chinese cash coins with their minimal purchasing value. A drop in copper prices in 1851 and early 1852 made the matter of a smaller cent less urgent at the Department of the Treasury, which supervised Mint activities.|$|E

5|$|In April 1941, the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), asked Arthur Compton, a Nobel-Prize-winning physics {{professor}} at the University of Chicago, {{to report on the}} uranium program. Niels Bohr and John Wheeler theorized that heavy isotopes with odd atomic numbers, such as plutonium-239, were fissile. Emilio Segrè and Glenn Seaborg at the University of California produced 28 μg of plutonium in the 60-inch cyclotron there in May 1941, <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had 1.7 times the thermal neutron capture cross section of uranium-235.

5|$|In early September1972, a {{tropical}} disturbance developed within a near-equatorial trough near the Northern Mariana Islands. On September11, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began monitoring this system as {{a tropical}} depression shortly after moving through the island chain. Initially, the system tracked southwestward before turning northwestward {{along the edge of}} a ridge. On September13, a United States Air Force reconnaissance plane flew into the system <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had intensified into a tropical storm. At this time, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring the newly named Tropical Storm Helen. Additionally, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration began warning on the system, assigning it the local name Paring. The following day, Helen attained typhoon status as it turned northward. Subsequently, a deepening trough over the East China Sea caused the typhoon to turn north-northeastward and accelerate.|$|E
5|$|Later, Brown {{revised the}} {{phylogeny}} of Corythosaurus, <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was closely related, and possibly ancestral to Hypacrosaurus. The only differences he found between them were {{the development of}} the vertebrae, and the proportions of the limbs. During a study of dinosaurian ilia in the 1920s, Alfred Sherwood Romer proposed that the two orders of dinosaurs might have evolved separately, and that birds, based on the shape and proportions of their ilia might truly be specialized ornithischians. He used both Tyrannosaurus and Corythosaurus as a base model to analyze which theory is more likely true. He found that even though birds are thought of as saurischians, it is very plausible for them to have evolved their specific pelvic musculature and anatomy if they evolved from ornithschians like Corythosaurus. However, even though Corythosaurus does resemble modern birds in pelvic structure more than saurischians, birds are now thought to have descended from the latter.|$|E

25|$|The {{subsequent}} decades {{saw more}} elaborate attempts to interpret eye movement, including {{a claim that}} meaningful text requires fewer fixations to read than random strings of letters.

25|$|Tykoski {{and colleagues}} {{performed}} a cladistic phylogenetic analysis {{with their new}} taxon, <b>and</b> <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> grouped with Goniopholis, Sunosuchus, and, most closely, with Eutretauranosuchus in a weakly supported clade, Goniopholididae.

Calsoyasuchus pushes back the earliest occurrence of goniopholids from the Late Jurassic into the Early Jurassic, and not only helps to bridge a temporal gap between groups of crocodyliforms, but also a morphological gap. It also implies that some groups of crocodyliforms have long undiscovered histories.|$|E
