To ensure such a vital requirement, methodologies must offer {{support for the}} careful design and analysis of such systems. Indeed these steps must cope with temporal and spatial constraints associated with mobility rules and parallelism which induce a high complexity. Here we handle the problem of unexpected and uncontrollable vehicles which significantly endanger the traffic. In this context, we propose to apply discrete control theory to a model of <b>automatic</b> <b>motorway</b> in order to synthesize a controller that handles collision avoidance.

30|$|Sensors {{are used}} in many {{different}} ways. These range from the real-time monitoring of water quality in oceans through sensors connected to buoys that send information over general packet radio services (GPRS) networks, to monitoring goods being shipped around the world, and smart power grids that create conditions for more rational planning and consumption in production processes, and can all be achieved by means of microchips implanted in objects that communicate with each other. Retailers can tag individual objects using radio frequency identifiers (RFID) to solve {{a number of problems}} all at once. Examples of the areas of application include accurate inventories, control of losses and unattended walk-through point-of-sale terminals. Warehouses can become fully automatic, with items being checked in and out and orders automatically passed to suppliers. Items in transit make intelligent decisions about their routing based on information received from readers and positioning systems. Weather forecasting infrastructure can work with in-ground sensors and irrigation-control software. Irrigation systems can be activated on the basis of intelligent decisions involving the level of moisture in the soil and the likelihood of precipitations. Roadside sensors can detect the flow of cars with RFID-based <b>automatic</b> <b>motorway</b> toll payment tags and provide traffic reports. All sorts of things can give their location to their owners, including keys, wallets, glasses, jewellery and tools. Some IoT-type applications are not new. Among these are toll payment tags, security access key cards, devices to track stolen cars and various types of identity tags for retail goods and livestock.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the <b>automatic</b> control of <b>motorway</b> traffic flows utilising ramp metering, i. e. traffic {{lights on the}} on-ramp entrances. A multivariable ramp metering system is developed, based on the nonminimal state space (NMSS) approach to control system design using adaptive proportional-integral-plus, linear quadratic (PIP–LQ) optimal controllers. The controller is evaluated on a nonlinear statistical traffic model (STM) simulation of the Amsterdam motorway ring road near the Coen Tunnel...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a number}} of research areas concerned with dynamic traffic management, including the simulation, forecasting and <b>automatic</b> control of <b>motorway</b> traffic flows. The research is based on detailed non-linear Statistical Traffic Model (STM) simulations of motorways in The Netherlands. However, {{we have found that}} the behaviour of the traffic system can be approximated by simple, reduced order linearised time variable parameter transfer function models, that are identified and recursively estimated directly from simulated or measured data. Such linear models are employed in a Proportional-Integral-Plus, Linear Quadratic (PIP-LQ) control system for multivariable ramp metering (i. e. traffic lights on the on-ramp entrances). The paper also proposes a novel non-parametric approach to the estimation of the ubiquitous non-linear fundamental traffic diagram. This technique successfully handles the discontinuity between free flow and congested conditions and so provides an objective estimate of the required control set point...|$|R

It has been implemented on a specific architecture based on DSP processors (96002). Both the algorithm and the architecture are described in this paper. Experimental results are also given. Key Words. Vision based control, Real time image processing, Vehicle modelling, Adaptive control. 1. HIGH SPEED VEHICLE GUIDANCE Research on autonomous vehicle navigation from imagery acquired from a vehicle mounted camera are being conducted in several laboratories. Results obtained by Dickmanns et al. (1992) are actually the most relevant ones. Works of Kanade et al. (1987) and Waxman et al. (1987) in the United States, works of Kuan et al. (1992), works of Thomas et al. (1993) are also notable.
