5|$|Allardyce {{was offered}} the chance to join Tranmere Rovers, but instead joined Preston North End after being persuaded by manager John McGrath, who promised to make Allardyce the {{backbone}} of his team. Preston won promotion out of the Fourth Division in second-place in 1986–87 (Allardyce was also named on the PFA Team of the Year), and consolidated their Third Division status with a 16th-place finish in 1987–88. By this time Allardyce began considering his retirement <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>player,</b> <b>and</b> applied to management positions at York City and Notts County, and had an unsuccessful interview with Doncaster Rovers.|$|E
5|$|County {{finished}} the 2007–08 season {{fourth in the}} league, and subsequently won their play-off semi-final against Wycombe Wanderers 2–1 on aggregate. The club had previously visited Wembley four times, and Gannon had played on all four occasions. He did as a manager what he could never do <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>player,</b> <b>and</b> guided Stockport victory at Wembley; the 3–2 win over Rochdale earned Gannon's club promotion to League One. He refused to give a post-match interview to Sky Sports following a nine-month dispute with the company over a broken Skybox. Nevertheless, having quickly taken Stockport from the foot of League Two and into League One on a meagre budget, Gannon had established himself {{as one of the}} most highly rated young managers in the lower leagues. In the summer he sold Liam Dickinson to Derby County for £750,000 – a player signed by previous manager, Chris Turner from Woodley Sports for a nominal fee just over two years previous.|$|E

5|$|In November 1946, Cowan became Manchester City manager, {{succeeding}} Wilf Wild, {{who moved}} to a purely administrative role. Cowan had been known for his motivational skills <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>player,</b> <b>and</b> {{was part of a}} new generation of managers who took responsibility for tactics and team selection, of which Cowan's contemporary and former teammate Matt Busby became the most well-known. Cowan was given a salary of £2,000, and came to an agreement whereby he spent part of the week with the Manchester City team and part looking after his business interests in Brighton. His first match as manager was a 3–0 win against Newport County, and the team then embarked upon a run of 19 matches without defeat. Despite achieving the Division Two title in his first season in charge, Cowan resigned in June 1947 as his commute from Brighton caused tension with club officials.|$|E
5|$|John King {{joined the}} club as manager in 1975, having already made 241 {{appearances}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>player,</b> <b>and</b> {{spent seven years}} as captain. He secured promotion from the Fourth Division, but was sacked following subsequent relegation. However, in his second spell as manager from 1987, King took the team {{from the bottom of}} Division Four to the brink of English football's top league. Under his leadership, they won the League Trophy in 1990, and reached the play-offs for promotion to the newly formed Premier League in 1993, 1994, and 1995. In 1996, King was given the position of director of football and replaced by player-manager John Aldridge.|$|E
5|$|McLean {{moved on}} loan from St Mirren to Second Division club Arbroath in December 2009. Arbroath signed McLean, along with Kilmarnock striker Daniel McKay, to cover for injuries. On 12 December, McLean made his debut for Arbroath in a 4–3 loss to Stirling Albion. Shortly after this match, Arbroath signed McLean's St Mirren team mate Kyle Faulds on loan. On 10 April, McLean scored his only goal for Arbroath, a penalty kick in a 4–2 loss against Stirling Albion. He made a total of 23 {{appearances}} {{during the second half}} of the 2009–10 season. Arbroath were relegated to the Third Division at the end of the season, after losing to Forfar Athletic in the relegation play-off. McLean has said that his loan spell at Arbroath helped him develop <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>player</b> <b>and</b> also to become more mature.|$|E

5|$|O'Reilly was honoured {{with several}} accolades {{late in his}} life. In 1980, he was awarded an Order of the British Empire for his {{services}} to cricket <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>player</b> <b>and</b> writer. In 1985, the oval in Wingello was renamed in his honour, and in 1988, a grandstand at the SCG was named the Bill O'Reilly Stand. In the same year, the oval in White Cliffs was renamed, and The Sydney Morning Herald renamed the medal they awarded to {{the best player in}} grade cricket in O'Reilly's honour. During the celebrations for the Australian Bicentenary, O'Reilly was named among the 200 people, and only 21 living, who had contributed the most to the country since European settlement.|$|E
5|$|On July 30, 1914, Boston owner Joseph Lannin had {{purchased}} the minor-league Providence Grays, {{members of the}} International League. The Providence team had been owned by several people associated with the Detroit Tigers, including star hitter Ty Cobb, {{and as part of}} the transaction, a Providence pitcher was sent to the Tigers. To soothe Providence fans upset at losing a star, Lannin announced that the Red Sox would soon send a replacement to the Grays. This was intended to be Ruth, but his departure for Providence was delayed when Cincinnati Reds owner Garry Herrmann claimed him off waivers. After Lannin wrote to Herrmann explaining that the Red Sox wanted Ruth in Providence so he could develop <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>player,</b> <b>and</b> would not release him to a major league club, Herrmann allowed Ruth to be sent to the minors. Carrigan later stated that Ruth was not sent down to Providence to make him a better player, but to help the Grays win the International League pennant (league championship).|$|E

5|$|Robin Friday (27 July 1952– 22 December 1990) was an English footballer {{who played}} professionally as a forward for Reading and Cardiff City during {{a career that}} lasted {{four years in the}} mid-1970s. His on-field {{performances}} were regarded as excellent, and he won Reading's player of the year award in both of his full seasons there, as well as being the leading goal scorer. However, his habit of unsettling opponents through physical intimidation contributed to a heavily tarnished disciplinary record, and his personal life was one of heavy smoking, drinking, womanising and drug abuse. Despite his short career, he remains prominent in the memory of Reading and Cardiff supporters, both <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>player</b> <b>and</b> a personality. He has been voted Reading's best ever player three times.|$|E
5|$|Since the Germany {{national}} football team's first official match in 1908, {{it has been}} one of the most successful national teams in world football. They are the current World Champions, having won the 2014 World Cup, their fourth title in seventeen tournaments, to add to three titles from ten European Championships. In doing so, twenty of its players have won both titles, and six have won gold, silver and bronze medals at the World Cup. Lothar Matthäus has played in a record 25 World Cup matches, and his participation in five World Cup tournaments is a joint record, shared with Antonio Carbajal of Mexico. Miroslav Klose is the highest goalscorer in the tournament's history with 16 goals, while Gerd Müller is third with 14 and Franz Beckenbauer is one of only two men to win the World Cup <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>player</b> <b>and</b> as a coach.|$|E
5|$|Stoke City {{arranged}} a testimonial match {{in honour of}} Matthews; it was much needed as he {{had spent most of}} his career constricted to the tight maximum wage that had been enforced upon the English game. The game was played at the Victoria Ground on 28 April 1965, by which time Matthews had decided to retire <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>player,</b> <b>and</b> the pre-match entertainment consisted of another match of two veteran teams featuring many legends of the game. Harry Johnston led out a team consisting of Bert Trautmann, Tim Ward, George Hardwick, Jimmy Hill, Neil Franklin, Don Revie, Stan Mortensen, Nat Lofthouse, Jimmy Hagan, Tom Finney and Frank Bowyer (reserve). Walley Barnes led out an opposing team consisting of Jimmy O'Neill, Jimmy Scoular, Danny Blanchflower, Jimmy Dickinson, Hughie Kelly, Bill McGarry, Jackie Mudie, Jackie Milburn, Jock Dodds, Ken Barnes, and Arthur Rowley (reserve).|$|E
