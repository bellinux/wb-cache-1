5|$|With {{the twin}} {{victories}} of Plataea and Mycale, the second Persian invasion of Greece was over. Moreover, {{the threat of}} a future invasion was abated; although the Greeks remained worried that Xerxes would try again, over time it became <b>apparent</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Persian desire to conquer Greece was much diminished.|$|E
5|$|About {{two hours}} later, it became <b>apparent</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> badly coordinated {{uprising}} had failed, as the remaining 550 native soldiers {{refused to participate}} in the mutiny, instead helping to quell the rebellion. Some went into the town to protect French civilians and office buildings from attack. Three Vietnamese sergeants were subsequently awarded the Médaille militaire for their role in the suppression of the mutiny, while six other tirailleurs received the Croix de Guerre. The attack initially generated confusion among the French administration. It was widely reported by the French media in Vietnam and Europe that the Indochinese Communist Party had organised the uprising.|$|E

5|$|As {{it became}} <b>apparent</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{following}} NHL season would be suspended {{due to a}} lockout, Samuelsson initially signed with Genève-Servette HC of the Swiss National League A in September 2004. He appeared in 12 games for the club, recording six points. A month after signing in Switzerland, he returned to Södertälje SK of the Elitserien in late October. He recorded 20 points over 29 games as the club qualified for the eighth and final playoff spot, where they were defeated by Färjestad BK in four-straight games. Samuelsson notched six points in ten post-season games.|$|E
5|$|During {{the initial}} pilot {{conversion}} course, it became <b>apparent</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> AV-8B exhibited flight characteristics {{different from the}} AV-8A. These differences, {{as well as the}} digital cockpit fitted instead of the analog cockpit of the TAV-8A, necessitated additional pilot training. In 1984, funding for eight AV-8Bs was diverted {{to the development of a}} two-seat TAV-8B trainer. The first of the 28 TAV-8Bs eventually procured had its maiden flight on 21 October 1986. This aircraft was delivered to VMAT-203 on 24 July 1987; the TAV-8B was also ordered by Italy and Spain.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1970s, it became <b>apparent</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{facilities}} at Hampden were {{in need of}} renewal. As an amateur club, Queen's Park could not possibly fund the works, while Glasgow District Council withdrew funding and the UK Government decided not to fund it either. Queen's Park considered selling Hampden, but a public appeal and minor repair work kept Hampden open during the 1980s. The riot after the 1980 Scottish Cup Final prompted reforms, as alcohol was banned from football stadia in Scotland.|$|E

5|$|In the 1950s, {{it became}} <b>apparent</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> light {{pollution}} from Cleveland {{was beginning to}} make cutting-edge research impossible from the East Cleveland site. A new site was constructed 30 {{miles to the east}} in Geauga County, known today as the Nassau Station, and the Burrell Schmidt telescope was moved to this location. In order to compensate for the move, a 36-inch telescope was soon installed at the Taylor Road facility.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{estimates}} of the casualties which claimed 2,000 Syrian dead and 800 French casualties {{turned out to be}} exaggerated. The French Army claimed 42 of its soldiers were killed, 152 wounded and 14 missing in action, while around 150 Syrian fighters were killed and 1,500 wounded. King Faisal observed the battle unfold from the village of al-Hamah, and as it became <b>apparent</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Syrians had been routed, he and his cabinet, with the exception of Interior Minister 'Ala al-Din al-Durubi, who had quietly secured a deal with the French, departed for al-Kiswah, a town located at the southern approaches of Damascus.|$|E
5|$|Once {{it became}} <b>apparent</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> series was a favored project at NBC, Littlefield {{reported}} {{that he was getting}} calls from every agent in town, wanting their client {{to be a part of}} the series. Auditions for the lead roles took place in New York and Los Angeles. The casting director shortlisted 1,000 actors who had applied for each role down to 75. Those who received a callback read again in front of Crane, Kauffman and Bright. At the end of March, the number of potential actors had been reduced to three or four for each part, and were asked to read for Les Moonves, then-president of Warner Bros. Television.|$|E

5|$|The Austro-Hungarian Navy's U-boat fleet at the {{beginning}} of World War I consisted of six largely experimental submarines, two of which were not operational. When it became <b>apparent</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> war would not be a short one, Austria-Hungary moved to bolster their U-boat fleet by seizing the plans for the Danish Havmanden class submarines, three of which had been built at Whitehead’s in Fiume. Although the Austro-Hungarian Navy was not happy with the design, which was largely obsolete, it was the only design for which plans were available and which could be begun immediately in domestic shipyards. The Austro-Hungarian Navy unenthusiastically placed orders for four boats on 27 March 1915.|$|E
5|$|The NGS deemed {{this gun}} {{obsolete}} {{shortly after the}} first ships were laid down, but the gun that it wanted to use, the Canon de 138 mm modèle 1923, was not yet available, so they planned to replace the 130mm guns later. The guns and their larger hoists were ordered well before any of the ships were completed {{and had to be}} written off when it became <b>apparent</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ships' stability was too marginal to tolerate the additional top weight.|$|E
5|$|The {{inclusion}} of occupational debris like ceramic sherds over the bones was {{not unique to}} the site but common in chambered tombs from southern England. On {{the basis of an}} example discovered at Kit's Coty House, Ashbee thought it <b>apparent</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> contents of the Coldrum's chamber would have been compartmentalised by medial slabs, which served the same purpose as the side chambers of West Kennet and Wayland's Smithy.|$|E

5|$|When {{it became}} <b>apparent</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> storm posed {{a threat to}} the Philippines, typhoon alerts were issued for much of Luzon, {{including}} the nation's capital city of Manila. Although Hal ultimately passed north of the Philippines, Luzon bore the brunt of the typhoon, enduring widespread flooding and significant crop damage. Forty-six people were killed in the Philippines: fatalities included two individuals who drowned when a river overflowed its banks in the Zambales province; a 24-year-old man electrocuted in Manila; a man who became entrapped in a vehicle; three people caught in a landslide; three civilians and a soldier swept down a torrential river; and ten fisherman aboard a stricken ship.|$|E
5|$|With {{a budget}} of $2 million and 350,000 lines of C++ and UnrealScript, Unreal Tournament took almost {{a year and a}} half to develop. When Unreal (the first {{installment}} of the Unreal series) was released in May 1998, it was well received by the press. However, it soon became <b>apparent</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> quality of the network code used for multiplayer matches was hampering the game's further success. In the months following Unreals release, improving the game's multiplayer part became the top priority of the development team. Epic Games started considering an official expansion pack intended to improve the network code while also featuring new maps and other gameplay elements.|$|E
