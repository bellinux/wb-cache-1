5|$|In 1960, Finnair started {{flying to}} Helsinki, {{although}} direct flights were not introduced until 1971. After 1962, the east–west runway became the main runway. Along with the runway expansion, a new service building, with <b>a</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>for</b> 2million passengers, was opened in 1964. It was located {{about half a}} kilometer (quarter of a mile) south of the former terminal. Designed by Odd Nansens Arkitektkontor, it had two stories, one for arrivals and one for departures, and two wings, one for domestic and one for international flights. It included a central hall that had a panorama view over the aircraft. The expanded facilities allowed SAS to take into use Sud Aviation Caravelle jets on the Copenhagen routes, although they were also occasionally used to Bodø.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{the club}} {{stated that they}} would either have to {{renovate}} Aspmyra for NOK200 million or build a new stadium elsewhere to remain competitive at a premiership level. Funding was proposed to be a mix of public and sponsor grants, including DA-funds. As part of the planning of a joint Norwegian and Swedish bid for the Euro 2016, Bodø Municipality and Bodø/Glimt proposed that Bodø could build a stadium at Rønvikjordene, {{in the northern part}} of the town. The plans were presented in late July 2008; the venue was planned to have <b>a</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>for</b> 30,000 to 35,000 spectators, but would be rebuilt after the tournament to seat 10,000 to 15,000. It was estimated that Bodø/Glimt would need <b>a</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>for</b> 10,000 to 15,000 spectators. In comparison, the population of Bodø was 46,049 in 2008. The new venue was estimated to cost NOK500 to 700 million and was largely proposed financed with DA-funds. Minister of Culture, Trond Giske, stated that at least one of the venues would have to be in Northern Norway to receive government support for an application. Aspmyra was planned used as a training pitch. Bodø was discarded for the Scandinavian bid, which ultimately was never sent to UEFA. For Aspmyra, the municipality has stated that they have the long-term option to purchase the real estate north of the pitch and can build a new stand there. Alternatively, an estimated NOK3 million can be used to demolish the stand and redevelop it as a commercial property.|$|E

At least one of the three brothers is present for every service. There is <b>a</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>for</b> 45 diners.|$|E

Although the eggs are laid sequentially, they tend to hatch within two days of one another, as the eggs that were laid later experienced higher temperatures and developed more rapidly. During the process, the precocial emu chicks need to develop <b>a</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>for</b> thermoregulation.
