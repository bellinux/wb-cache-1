50|$|Hormone {{therapy or}} {{hormonal}} therapy {{is the use}} of hormones in medical treatment. Treatment with hormone antagonists may also be referred to as hormonal therapy or antihormone therapy. The most general classes of hormone therapy are oncologic hormone therapy and hormone replacement therapy, of which there are various kinds (e.g., for menopause, for <b>andropause,</b> or for gender transition).|$|E
5000|$|The reproductive-cell {{cycle theory}} argues that ageing is {{regulated}} specifically by reproductive hormones that act in an antagonistic pleiotropic manner via cell cycle signalling, promoting {{growth and development}} early in life to achieve reproduction, but becoming dysregulated later in life, driving senescence (dyosis) in a futile attempt to maintain reproductive ability. The endocrine dyscrasia that follows the loss of follicles with menopause, {{and the loss of}} Leydig and Sertoli cells during <b>andropause,</b> drive aberrant cell cycle signalling that leads to cell death and dysfunction, tissue dysfunction (disease) and ultimately death. Moreover, the hormones that regulate reproduction also regulate cellular metabolism, explaining the increases in fat deposition during pregnancy through to the deposition of centralised adiposity with the dysregulation of the HPG axis following menopause and during <b>andropause</b> (Atwood and Bowen, 2006). This theory, which introduced a new definition of ageing, has facilitated the conceptualisation of why and how ageing occurs at the evolutionary, physiological and molecular levels.|$|E

5000|$|AβPP and its {{cleavage}} products do {{not promote}} the proliferation and differentiation of post-mitotic neurons; rather, the overexpression of either wild-type or mutant AβPP in post-mitotic neurons induces apoptotic death following their re-entry {{into the cell}} cycle. [...] It is postulated {{that the loss of}} sex steroids (including progesterone) but the elevation in luteinizing hormone, the adult equivalent of hCG, post-menopause and during <b>andropause</b> drives amyloid-β production and re-entry of post-mitotic neurons into the cell cycle.|$|E
5000|$|Hot flashes in {{men could}} have various causes. It {{can be a}} sign of low testosterone. Another is <b>andropause,</b> or [...] "male menopause". [...] Men with {{prostate}} cancer or testicular cancer can also have hot flashes, especially those who are undergoing hormone therapy with antiandrogens, also known as androgen antagonists, which reduce testosterone to castrate levels. There are also other ailments and even dietary changes which can cause it. Men who are castrated can also get hot flashes.|$|E
50|$|For many cancer patients, the {{decrease}} {{or loss of}} reproductive function is temporary; many men and women, however, do not regain fertility after cancer treatment. Patients undergoing serious radiation, chemotherapy, or surgery sometimes experience symptoms resembling menopause (in women) or <b>andropause</b> (in men), which indicate reproductive damage. In women, decreased estrogen levels {{as a result of}} ovarian deficiency lead to weakened bone, changes in temperature control, altered mood, and decreased sexual desire. Men with testicular insufficiency also experience similar symptoms.|$|E
5000|$|The {{term was}} popularized by author Jed Diamond in 2004 as being related to [...] "andropause", a concept he had earlier popularized. According to Diamond, <b>andropause</b> {{is a change}} of life in middle-aged men, which has hormonal, physical, psychological, interpersonal, social, sexual, and spiritual aspects. He says that this change occurs in all men, may occur as early as age 45 to 50 and more {{dramatically}} {{after the age of}} 70 in some men, and that women's and men's experiences are somewhat similar phenomena.|$|E
50|$|During the {{transition}} to menopause, menstrual patterns can show shorter cycling (by 2-7 days); longer cycles remain possible. There may be irregular bleeding (lighter, heavier, spotting). Dysfunctional uterine bleeding is often experienced by women approaching menopause due to the hormonal changes that accompany the menopause transition. Spotting or bleeding may simply be related to vaginal atrophy, a benign sore (polyp or lesion), or may be a functional endometrial response. The European Menopause and <b>Andropause</b> Society has released guidelines for assessment of the endometrium, which is usually {{the main source of}} spotting or bleeding.|$|E
50|$|Physically, {{the middle-aged}} {{experience}} {{a decline in}} muscular strength, reaction time, sensory keenness, and cardiac output. Also, women experience menopause and {{a sharp drop in}} the hormone estrogen. Men experience an equivalent endocrine system event to menopause. <b>Andropause</b> in males is a hormone fluctuation with physical and psychological effects that can be similar to those seen in menopausal females. As men age, lowered testosterone levels can contribute to mood swings and a decline in sperm count. Sexual responsiveness can also be affected, including delays in erection and longer periods of penile stimulation required to achieve ejaculation.|$|E
5000|$|Popular {{interest}} {{in the concept of}} [...] "andropause" [...] was fueled by the 1998 book Male Menopause, written by Jed Diamond, a lay person. According to Diamond's view, <b>andropause</b> is a change of life in middle-aged men, which has hormonal, physical, psychological, interpersonal, social, sexual, and spiritual aspects. Diamond claims that this change occurs in all men, may occur as early as age 45 to 50 and more dramatically after the age of 70 in some men, and that women's and men's experiences are somewhat similar phenomena. [...] The language of [...] "andropause" [...] and its supposed parallels with menopause have been rejected by the medical community.|$|E
