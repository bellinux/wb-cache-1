5|$|The {{following}} day {{was spent in}} launching airstrikes <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> artillery bombardment against the hilltop, totally denuding it of cover. On 23 November, 2-503 and 4-503 were ordered to renew their assault while the 1st Battalion, 12th Infantry assaulted 875 from the south. This time the Americans gained the crest, but the North Vietnamese had already abandoned their positions, leaving only a few dozen charred bodies and weapons.|$|E
5|$|By 22:45 the {{crossroads}} had been secured by {{what remained of}} 'C' Company, the eighteen survivors of 'A' Company were in among the south-eastern buildings of Bréville. In the north-east of the village the twenty survivors of the Devonshire company had captured their objective. The shelling had stopped when 'B' Company reached the village unopposed and occupied abandoned German trenches beside the church. Fearing a German counter-attack on his weakened battalion, Parker ordered a defensive artillery bombardment. However, there was a misunderstanding when the order reached the artillery <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> bombardment landed on the British positions in the village, causing several casualties including three of the surviving officers.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland has a bus {{and rail}} mass transit system {{operated}} by the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority (RTA). The rail portion is officially called the RTA Rapid Transit, but local residents {{refer to it as}} The Rapid. It consists of two light rail lines, known as the Green and Blue Lines, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> rail line, the Red Line. In 2008, RTA completed the HealthLine, a bus rapid transit line, for which naming rights were purchased by the Cleveland Clinic and University Hospitals. It runs along Euclid Avenue from downtown through University Circle, ending at the Louis Stokes Station at Windermere in East Cleveland. In 2007, the American Public Transportation Association named Cleveland's mass transit system the best in North America.|$|E

5|$|Combat in Armada of the Damned {{was split}} between land and sea. Sterling had a light <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> attack, {{which could be}} {{combined}} to create combos that increased the damage he inflicted. Correct timing lead to a bonus attack {{at the end of}} the combo that improved its strength. Sterling could also curse his opponents. The curse was a spell that weakened all surrounding enemies when it was used as a finishing move. All attacks, special moves, and combinations varied depending of the pirate type chosen and could be upgraded at will.|$|E
5|$|From 1944 the Operational Holding Commando Headquarters was formed. It was {{responsible}} for two sub–units: the Army and Royal Marines Holding Commando Wings. Both units had an establishment of five troops <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> weapons troop of fully trained commandos. The men in these troops were to provide individual or complete troop replacements for the Commando units in the field. In December 1944, the four Special Service brigades were re-designated as Commando brigades.|$|E
5|$|In 1400, the Mongol army under Timur, {{better known}} as Tamerlane, swept down on Syria and arrived at Damascus after having subdued Aleppo, Homs, and Baalbek. A Mamluk army from Egypt under Sultan Faraj ibn Barquq, the son of Barquq, failed to lift the siege. In 1401, the city {{surrendered}} to Timur, except for the citadel, which Timur besieged. Towers with trebuchets were set up around the citadel and in the Umayyad Mosque. The garrison surrendered after the northwestern tower was brought down through mining. The defenders were slaughtered <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> tribute was imposed on the citizens of Damascus. When they failed to deliver, the city was sacked and the Umayyad Mosque was burned.|$|E
50|$|While {{still using}} the same basic {{airframe}} as Kormoran 1, the Kormoran 2 has a greater range of 35 km (21.7 miles) <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavier</b> 220 kg (485 lb) warhead.|$|R

5000|$|The mortar fired {{a lighter}} high {{explosive}} round (OF-841) <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavier</b> HE round (OF-841A). The lighter HE round actually carried a larger bursting charge than the heavier round. [...] Both rounds used GVMZ-series point detonation fuzes.|$|R
5|$|In early 1861 the {{critical}} border state of Kentucky had declared neutrality in the American Civil War. This neutrality was first violated on September 3, when Confederate Brig. Gen. Gideon J. Pillow, acting on orders from Maj. Gen. Leonidas Polk, occupied Columbus, Kentucky. The riverside town was situated on 180 foot high bluffs that commanded {{the river at}} that point, where the Confederates installed 140 large guns, underwater mines <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> chain that stretched a mile across the Mississippi River to Belmont, while occupying the town with 17,000 Confederate troops, thus cutting off northern commerce {{to the south and}} beyond.|$|E
5|$|Many half-tracks, jeeps {{and trucks}} foundered in deep water; those {{that made it}} ashore soon became jammed up on the {{narrowing}} beach, making easy targets for the German defenders. Most of the radios were lost, making the task of organizing the scattered and dispirited troops even more difficult, and those command groups that did make the shore found their effectiveness limited to their immediate vicinity. Except for a few surviving tanks <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> weapons squad here or there, the assault troops had only their personal weapons, which, having been dragged through surf and sand, invariably needed cleaning before they could be used.|$|E
5|$|The 2007 defence {{of the cup}} in France {{got off to a}} {{very poor}} start, with a below par victory over the United States <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> 36–0 defeat to South Africa leaving the holders on the brink of {{elimination}} at the group stage. Improved performances against Samoa and Tonga saw England again reach the knockout stages as pool runners-up, before a surprise 12–10 defeat of Australia in Marseille and a narrow 14–9 victory over the host nation France carried England to a second successive final appearance. The final was played in Paris on 20 October against South Africa, who won by 15 points to 6.|$|E
50|$|Black Coats & Bandages is {{the second}} {{full-length}} album by Irish-Australian band Clann Zú. This album has much sparser instrumentation and less electronic influence than Clann Zú's previous album, Rua, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavier</b> use of the Irish language.|$|R
5000|$|An {{improved}} {{version of}} the Scorpion was introduced in 1971. Among the modifications in the new version were all-aluminum rotor blades, a [...] OMC 2-cycle engine (Evinrude Vulcan V-4 outboard motor) <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavier</b> drive system (shafts and bearings).|$|R
50|$|The armour {{protection}} is tuneable by {{the replacement of}} armour packs within the vehicle's external skin. The basic add-on armour pack provides ballistic protection against small arms fire <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavier</b> kit provides protection against heavy weapons to including mines.|$|R
5|$|The {{conquest of}} Amorium {{was not only}} a major {{military}} disaster <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> personal blow for Theophilos, but also a traumatic event for the Byzantines, its impact resonating in later literature. The sack did not ultimately alter the balance of power, which was slowly shifting in Byzantium's favour, but it thoroughly discredited the theological doctrine of Iconoclasm, ardently supported by Theophilos. As Iconoclasm relied heavily on military success for its legitimization, the fall of Amorium contributed decisively to its abandonment shortly after Theophilos's death in 842.|$|E
5|$|There is {{a mixture}} of {{high-density}} urban areas, suburbs, semi-rural and rural locations in Oldham. There is some permanent grassland but overwhelmingly the land use in the town is urban. The territory of Oldham is contiguous with other towns on all sides except for a small section along its eastern and southern boundaries, and for purposes of the Office for National Statistics, forms the fourth largest settlement of the Greater Manchester Urban Area, the United Kingdom's third largest conurbation. The M60 motorway passes through the southwest of Oldham, through Hollinwood, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> rail line enters Oldham from the same direction, travelling northeast to the town centre before heading northwards through Derker towards Shaw and Crompton.|$|E
5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of fresh fighting in 1648, a Royalist army of 8,000 fresh recruits was mustered {{under the command of}} General Rowland Laugharne and Sir Edward Stradling, with the intent of retaking Cardiff. Parliamentary forces in Brecon under the command of Colonel Thomas Horton moved quickly to reinforce the castle, although with only 3,000 men they were content to wait until a larger army under Oliver Cromwell could arrive from Gloucester. With time against them, the Royalist army attacked, leading to the battle of St Fagans just to the west of Cardiff, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> Royalist defeat.|$|E
50|$|The lances {{used are}} 11 ft long, {{weighing}} about 10 lb, made of Douglas fir. Two types of lances were used, a lighter variant with {{a diameter of}} 1.25 in, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavier</b> variant with <b>a</b> diameter of 1.5 in.|$|R
40|$|Human {{activities}} {{have resulted in}} arsenic (<b>As)</b> <b>and</b> <b>heavy</b> metals accumulation in paddy soils in China. Phytoremediation has been suggested as <b>an</b> effective <b>and</b> low-cost method to clean up contaminated soils. A combined soil-sand pot experiment was conducted to investigate the influence of red mud (RM) supply on iron plaque formation <b>and</b> <b>As</b> <b>and</b> <b>heavy</b> metal accumulation in two wetland plant species (Cyperus alternifolius Rottb., Echinodorus amazonicus Rataj), using <b>As</b> <b>and</b> <b>heavy</b> metals polluted paddy soil combined with three rates of RM application (0, 2 %, 5 %). The results showed that RM supply significantly decreased <b>As</b> <b>and</b> <b>heavy</b> metals accumulation in shoots of the two plants due to the decrease of <b>As</b> <b>and</b> <b>heavy</b> metal availability and the enhancement {{of the formation of}} iron plaque on the root surface and in the rhizosphere. Both wetland plants supplied with RM tended to have more Fe plaque, higher <b>As</b> <b>and</b> <b>heavy</b> metals on roots and in their rhizospheres, and were more tolerant of <b>As</b> <b>and</b> <b>heavy</b> metal toxicity. The results suggest that RM-induced enhancement of the formation of iron plaque on the root surface and in the rhizosphere of wetland plants may be significant for remediation of soils contaminated with <b>As</b> <b>and</b> <b>heavy</b> metals...|$|R

5|$|After the {{development}} of larger and faster-growing hogs (due to crosses between European and Asian breeds) in the 18th and 19th century in the United States, backyard and small-scale hog production provided an inexpensive means of converting waste food, crop waste, and garbage into calories (in a relatively small space and {{in a relatively short}} period of time). Many of those calories came in the form of fat and rendered lard. Lard was used for almost all cooking and was a fundamental component in many common homestead foods (many that today are still regarded as holiday and comfort foods) like biscuits and pies. The economic/caloric necessity of consuming lard and other saved fats may have led to the popularity of fried foods, not only in the US, but worldwide. In the 19th century cast iron became widely available for use in cooking. The combination of flour, lard, a chicken <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> pan placed over a relatively controllable flame became the beginning of today's fried chicken.|$|E
5|$|By 10:00, {{all three}} French ships were {{within range of}} Centurion <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> {{exchange}} of fire began. Within 15 minutes, both Centurion and Marengo had their colours shot away and at 10:45 the ship of the line turned away for open water, followed by the frigates, her rigging in disarray. Damage had rendered Centurion unable to manoeuvre rapidly and she began slowly limping inshore to shelter from Marengo among the coastal shoals. Captain Lind rejoined his ship by boat, hailing the Princess Charlotte, which had still not participated in the battle, to cut her anchor cables and go ashore to avoid being captured. Logan refused and at 11:15 surrendered without a fight as the whole French squadron moved back towards the harbour. Marengo again remained beyond the sandbars that marked the entrance. The boatloads of sepoys, who were still en route to Princess Charlotte, turned about and rowed back to shore to avoid capture. Sémillante took possession of the merchant ship while Marengo and Atalante engaged Centurion, which had moved {{out of range of}} support from the shore batteries.|$|E
5|$|By this point, the British {{high command}} had {{realised}} {{that they could}} not hold the Germans in southern Norway. The evacuation of Allied troops from Molde and Åndalsnes began, with Ark Royal providing air cover from 30 April. On 1 May, the Germans tried to sink the carrier, with numerous air attacks through the day. Ark Royals fighters <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> anti-aircraft barrage drove off the enemy, and although several bombs were dropped at the carrier, none impacted. The evacuation was completed on 3 May, and the carrier was recalled to Scapa Flow to refuel and rearm before returning to Norway. While in port, Captain Arthur Power left the ship for a promotion to the Admiralty, and was replaced by Captain Cedric Holland. On return to Norway, Ark Royal was told to provide air cover for operations around Narvik, including the landing of French troops on 13 May. She was joined on 18 May by the carriers Glorious and Furious.|$|E

5|$|In 1969, Sanford became {{president}} of Duke University, a position he held for the next 16 years. That helped quell student unrest over the Vietnam War early in his tenure as university president. Addressing the protests of the 1970 Kent State shootings with tolerance, choosing to not call in police to clear the roads, leading to the protesting students going back to their rooms at night so that West Campus could be reopened the next day kept the campus calm during a turbulent spring. Shortly before his tenure, on February 13, 1969, 60 student members of the Afro-American Society had occupied Duke's main administration center, the Allen Building, demanding {{the creation of a}} Black Studies program. After three days of clashes with police, they left the building peaceably February 16, when school officials agreed to the program. During his tenure, Sanford strongly opposed confrontation <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> police action which helped defuse racial tensions.|$|E
5|$|In {{the end the}} Māoris {{remained}} in position until 17 April. Throughout the previous two days the battalion worked hard to repel repeated attempts by elements of the German 2nd Infantry Regiment to infiltrate their lines, before they finally received the order to fall back. With isolated platoons still {{in contact with the}} Germans and amidst high winds <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> downpour of rain, the New Zealanders had difficulty disengaging. Withdrawing over difficult terrain towards the pass, the manoeuvre continued into the night as the Germans continued to harass their rearguard units. The move was carried out with considerable urgency because the intention was to blow a bridge up just after the battalion had withdrawn across it in order to delay the German advance. In the end the battalion only just made it, for the engineers tasked with carrying out the demolition had received the order to complete their task and were about to detonate when the battalion arrived shortly after 3:00am.|$|E
5|$|Owing {{to supply}} {{problems}} during the advance from Beersheba, Allenby maintained Philip W. Chetwode's XX Corps {{in the rear}} close to lines of communication. These troops enjoyed 10 days resting in the rear, where they were easily supplied and refitted. It was these fresh troops of XX Corps which were ordered to take over responsibility for front line operations in the Judean Hills against the defending Ottoman Seventh Army. The 60th (London) Division, commanded by Major General John Shea, arrived at Latron on 23 November from Huj and on 28 November relieved the seriously weakened infantry in the 52nd (Lowland) and 75th Divisions without much of a reduction in fighting ability. On the same day, the 74th (Yeomanry) Division, commanded by Major General E. S. Girdwood, arrived at Latron from Karm. Two days later the 10th (Irish) Division, commanded by Major General J. R. Longley, also arrived at Latron from Karm. The 53rd (Welsh) Division, with the Corps Cavalry Regiment <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>heavy</b> battery attached, remained on the Hebron road north of Beersheba, coming under direct orders from General Headquarters (GHQ); they became known as Mott's Detachment.|$|E
