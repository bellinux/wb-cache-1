5|$|In mid January 2013, Japan's {{central bank}} {{signaled}} {{the intention to}} launch an open ended bond buying programme which would likely devalue the yen.

5|$|Instead of anticoagulation, a {{follow-up}} imaging test (typically ultrasound) about one-week post-diagnosis {{is an option}} for those with an acute isolated distal DVT without a high risk for extension; if the clot does not grow, the ACCP does not recommend anticoagulation. This technique can benefit those at a high risk for bleeding. Patients may choose anticoagulation over serial imaging, however, to avoid the inconvenience of another scan if concerns <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of bleeding are insignificant. When applied to symptomatic patients with a negative initial ultrasound result, serial testing is inefficient and not cost effective.|$|E

25|$|In November, the {{managing}} director of the IMF Dominique Strauss-Kahn repeated the warning against terminating the stimulus measures too soon. The Financial Times, however, reported that significant differences had emerged even within Europe, with senior members of the European Central Bank expressing concern <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of delaying the exit for too long.|$|E
25|$|As raw {{material}} prices {{fall through the}} global recession, the negotiating position of African countries is sharply weakened, while expected profits intended to repay Chinese loans are collapsing.

25|$|The three largest {{agencies}} {{are not the}} only sources of credit information. Many smaller rating agencies also exist, mostly serving non-US markets.

25|$|In Canada, {{the history}} of the drug {{thalidomide}} dates back to April 1, 1961. There were many different forms sold, with the most common variant being Talimol. Two months after Talimol went on sale, pharmaceutical companies sent physicians letters warning <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of birth defects. It was not until March 2, 1962, that both drugs were banned from the Canadian market by the FDD, and soon afterward physicians were warned to destroy their supplies.|$|E

He gave evidence to The Iraq Inquiry on 3 December 2009.

25|$|As {{an owner}} of several major Las Vegas businesses, Hughes wielded much {{political}} and economic influence in Nevada and elsewhere. During the 1960s and early 1970s, he disapproved of underground nuclear testing at the Nevada Test Site. Hughes was concerned <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> from residual nuclear radiation, and attempted to halt the tests. When the tests finally went through despite Hughes' efforts, the detonations were powerful enough that the entire hotel where he was staying trembled due to the shock waves. In two separate, last-ditch maneuvers, Hughes instructed his representatives to offer million-dollar bribes to both presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard Nixon.|$|E

25|$|The {{scale of}} the crisis led to {{warnings}} of an imminent disaster, with United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan warning <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of genocide. The {{scale of the}} Janjaweed campaign led to comparisons with the Rwandan Genocide, a parallel denied by the Sudanese government. Independent observers noted that the tactics, which included dismemberment and killing of noncombatants, including young children and infants, were more akin to the ethnic cleansing used in the Yugoslav wars and warned that the region's remoteness meant that {{hundreds of thousands of}} people were effectively cut off from aid. The Brussels-based International Crisis Group had reported in May 2004 that over 350,000 people could potentially die as a result of starvation and disease.|$|E
25|$|Current {{technology}} for plug-ins {{is based on}} the lithium-ion battery and an electric motor, and the demand for lithium, heavy metals and other rare elements (such as neodymium, boron and cobalt) required for the batteries and powertrain is expected to grow significantly due to the incoming market entrance of plug-ins and electric vehicles in the mid and long term. Some of the largest world reserves of lithium and other rare metals are located in countries with strong resource nationalism, unstable governments or hostile to U.S. interests, raising concerns <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of replacing dependence on foreign oil with a new dependence on hostile countries to supply strategic materials. Even though the metals used in electric vehicle batteries are rare, they can be recycled.|$|E
25|$|The precise {{treatment}} intent (curative, adjuvant, neoadjuvant therapeutic, or palliative) {{will depend}} on the tumor type, location, and stage, as well as the general health of the patient. Total body irradiation (TBI) is a radiation therapy technique used to prepare the body to receive a bone marrow transplant. Brachytherapy, in which a radioactive source is placed inside or next to the area requiring treatment, is another form of radiation therapy that minimizes exposure to healthy tissue during procedures to treat cancers of the breast, prostate and other organs. Radiation therapy has several applications in non-malignant conditions, such as the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia, acoustic neuromas, severe thyroid eye disease, pterygium, pigmented villonodular synovitis, and prevention of keloid scar growth, vascular restenosis, and heterotopic ossification. The use of radiation therapy in non-malignant conditions is limited partly by worries <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of radiation-induced cancers.|$|E
