5|$|Across {{the rest}} of the five-match Test series against South Africa, Ring took only seven more wickets, and he tended to be {{expensive}} {{in terms of the number}} of runs conceded from his bowling. In the second match, which the South Africans won, he took three wickets for 187, and, batting at No 10, contributed a quick-fire 53 out of the last 74 runs when the match had already effectively been lost. Two weeks later, in the third match, he took just one wicket in a crushing Australian victory, but contributed 58 out of 75 in just 68 minutes from the unusually lofty batting position of No 8. The fourth and fifth Tests brought him few runs or wickets. In the series as a whole, Ring scored 184 runs at an average of 23 runs per innings and took 13 wickets <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> average of 48.|$|E

As part of this deal, Neaira agreed to no longer work as a prostitute in Corinth, and so left the city for Athens with Phrynion, who had helped her buy her freedom.|$|E

At the age of 21, he began his Islamic studies, first in Bahrain and later in the religious institute of Al Najaf, Iraq, where he remained for 11 years. He returned to Bahrain in 1973 and was elected to the newly formed parliament. The parliament was dissolved two years later by the Emir, Isa bin Salman al-Khalifa, after it had rejected the State Security Law. In 1977, al-Jamri was appointed as a judge <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>High</b> Religious Court of Bahrain.

At Gallipoli, the 10thLight Horse went into action in the Battles of the Nek and Hill 60, before being withdrawn in December and redeployed to Egypt. There it took part in the campaign against the Turks in Sinai, including the Battle of Romani.|$|E
5|$|Calisthenics, {{especially}} as {{done in the}} huge formations favored at the time, could be boring, and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> school and college levels, games such as baseball and rugby were more often spectator sports than a practical source of physical exercise for the masses. Moreover, at elite levels, baseball, football, and even judo did not put much emphasis on moral or intellectual development. Instead, elite coaches and athletes tended to emphasize winning, at almost any cost.|$|E
5|$|Hastings {{represented}} Mrs Russell in {{the initial}} trial <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>High</b> Court and lost; the decision was appealed to the Court of Appeal, where he again lost. The case was then sent to the House of Lords, who {{by a majority of}} three to two (with Lord Birkenhead giving the leading judgment) overturned the previous judgments and said that Mr Russell's evidence as to the legitimacy of his son was inadmissible. Hastings did not represent Mrs Russell in the House of Lords case, however, because by this point he was already Attorney General.|$|E

5|$|In 1977, the {{government}} offered al-Jamri {{the opportunity to}} serve as a judge <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>High</b> Religious Court of Bahrain (Shia branch). Al-Jamri agreed after Abu al-Qasim al-Khoei issued him with a religious permit to do so. The decision was controversial within Bahrain, as many Shia clerics had refused to participate in {{the government}}-run judiciary ever since its foundation in the 1920s. Al-Jamri held the position until June 1988, when he was suspended due to his criticism of the government.|$|E
