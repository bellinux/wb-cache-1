Their bodies were carried outside to the bombed-out garden behind the Reich Chancellery, where they were placed in a bomb crater and doused with petrol.

5|$|On Shelter Island itself, NY114 acts as {{the main}} thoroughfare, once again turning along {{different}} local roads. It traverses {{the length of the}} island, and ends in historic Shelter Island Heights at the North Ferry terminal. Once across to Greenport, NY114 ends quickly at NY25, again just <b>a</b> <b>block</b> <b>or</b> so from the heart of the village. Despite the short distance between the North Ferry terminal and the northern terminus, NY114 includes three streets in Greenport. Northbound Route114 runs on Third Street from the ferry terminal to NY25. Southbound NY114 runs along Fifth Street then one block later turns left onto Wiggins Street, where it heads eastbound until it passes the historic Greenport Railroad Station, and terminates at Third Street and the North Ferry terminal. The portion of NY114 within Greenport is maintained by the village.|$|E

25|$|A 2002 study {{suggested}} that if a new College of Law structure was to be constructed, it should relocate closer to downtown Lexington. The suggested site was <b>a</b> <b>block</b> <b>or</b> two north, on Scott Street near the College of Education. A plan for five structures and two courtyards was abandoned because of funding difficulties. Now the school will renovate and expand its current building, a $56 million project, with state bonds paying $35 million {{on the condition that}} tuition not go up as a result. The work is to be completed in 2019.|$|E
25|$|They were {{typically}} {{made from a}} rounded stone, <b>a</b> <b>block</b> <b>or</b> lithic flake, using a hammer to remove flakes {{from both sides of}} the item. This hammer can be hard made of stone or of wood or antler. The latter two, softer hammers can produce more delicate results. However, a hand axe's technological aspect can reflect more differences. For example, uniface tools have only been worked on one side and partial bifaces retain a high proportion of the natural cortex of the tool stone, often making them easy to confuse with chopping tools. Further, simple bifaces may have been created from a suitable tool stone, but they rarely show evidence of retouching.|$|E
25|$|Vertical bat or straight-bat shots can {{be played}} off either the front foot or the back foot {{depending}} upon the anticipated height of the ball at the moment it reaches the batsman. The characteristic position of the bat is a vertical alignment at point of contact. Vertical bat shots are typically played with the batsman's head directly above the point of contact so that {{he is able to}} accurately judge the line of the ball. At this point the bat can either be stationary and facing straight back down the wicket – known as <b>a</b> <b>block</b> <b>or</b> defensive shot; angled to one side – known as a glance or deflection; or travelling forwards towards the bowler – known as a drive.|$|E

The statute was not specific about how far a recently arrived visitor might [...] "with good faith, and within reasonable time" [...] travel into town while carrying a firearm. This permitted a traveler to keep his firearms if he was proceeding directly to a livery, hotel or saloon.

2500|$|Chocolate [...] is a {{typically}} sweet, usually brown food preparation of Theobroma cacao seeds, roasted and ground. It {{is made in}} the form of a liquid, paste, or in <b>a</b> <b>block,</b> <b>or</b> used as a flavoring ingredient in other foods. Cacao has been cultivated by many cultures for at least three millennia in Mesoamerica. The earliest evidence of use traces to the Mokaya (Mexico and Guatemala), with evidence of chocolate beverages dating back to 1900 BCE. In fact, the majority of Mesoamerican people made chocolate beverages, including the Maya and Aztecs, who made it into a beverage known as xocolātl , a Nahuatl word meaning [...] "bitter water". The seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor.|$|E

40|$|In {{deposition}} with a poisoning species, we {{show that}} the transition to <b>a</b> <b>blocked</b> <b>or</b> pinned phase {{may be viewed as}} an absorbing transition in the directed percolation (DP) class. We consider a ballistic-like deposition model with an active and an inactive species that represents its basic features and exhibits a transition from a growing phase to <b>a</b> <b>blocked</b> <b>or</b> pinned phase, with the deposition rate as the order parameter. In the growing phase, the interface width shows a crossover from the critical W ~ t behavior to Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) scaling, which involves DP and KPZ exponents in the saturation regime. In the pinned phase, the maximum heights and widths scale as H_s ~ W_s ~ (p-p_c) ^{nu_//}. The robustness of the DP class suggests investigations in real systems.

2500|$|The Native American flute is {{the only}} flute in the world {{constructed}} with two air chambers - there is a wall inside the flute between the top (slow) air chamber and the bottom chamber which has the whistle and finger holes. The top chamber {{also serves as a}} secondary resonator, which gives the flute its distinctive sound. There is a hole {{at the bottom of the}} [...] "slow" [...] air chamber and a (generally) square hole at the top of the playing chamber. <b>A</b> <b>block</b> (<b>or</b> [...] "bird") with a spacer is tied on top of the flute to form a thin, flat airstream for the whistle hole (or [...] "window"). Some more modern flutes use an undercut either in the block or the flute to eliminate the need for a spacer.|$|E
2500|$|Following these events, HouseGuests {{competed in}} the [...] "Big Brother Disco" [...] {{endurance}} Head of Household competition. For this competition, HouseGuests stood atop gold discs attached to the tops of hanging disco balls and were spun around continuously while holding on with the chains used to attach the disco balls to the metal structure. The last HouseGuest remaining on their ball without falling would become the new Head of Household. When James and Natalie were the last two remaining, James promised Natalie that both she and Matt would be safe if she allowed him to win Head of Household. This led to Natalie {{dropping out of the}} competition, making James the winner. James, upset that three people had voted for him not to return, attempted to figure out who had voted for Alex to return. Though Ryan and Sheila confessed to their votes, Matt continued to deny that he had cast the third vote. On Day 36, James chose to nominate Ryan and Sheila for eviction. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, Matt, Chelsia, and Joshuah were selected to compete; Natalie was selected to host. On Day 37, HouseGuests {{competed in the}} [...] "Trapped in the Cage" [...] Power of Veto competition. For this competition, players were required to walk along a series of balance beams in an attempt to transfer 500 blocks from a cage to their tube. They could only move two blocks at a time, and dropping <b>a</b> <b>block</b> <b>or</b> falling would result in their elimination; the first HouseGuest to successfully get their blocks into their tube would win. James was the winner, making him the first HouseGuest this season to win both Head of Household and Power of Veto in the same week. Despite James wanting to backdoor Adam, Sharon later convinced James that Matt had been the third vote and should be evicted that week. On Day 39, James chose to use the Power of Veto to remove Sheila from the block, with Matt being nominated in her place. On Day 42, Matt became the eighth HouseGuest to be evicted from the house when James broke a tie in Ryan's favor. He became the first member of the Jury of Seven.|$|E
