5|$|A {{grand jury}} petition, bearing over 1,400 {{signatures}} across 134 pages, was {{filed with the}} Tulsa County election board by Medlin on November 6, 1989. The petition alleged that local <b>and</b> <b>state</b> <b>officials</b> violated the state's open meetings, conspiracy, and conflict of interest laws while planning the turnpike. The election board certified the petition as meeting the required threshold of 1,000 signatures on December 15. Work on the turnpike continued despite the investigation. After meeting for seven days, on January 19, 1990, the grand jury determined {{that there was no}} evidence to support the allegations and no need for further investigation.|$|E
5|$|After initial resistance, Gibbs also {{successfully}} pushed {{legislation in}} 2007 to increase penalties for truck drivers {{who fail to}} comply with Colorado's law requiring snow chain on roads in winter, a move designed to improve accessibility and safety on I-70, which bisected Gibbs' house district. In later years, Gibbs <b>and</b> <b>state</b> <b>officials</b> attributed decreases in accidents and tickets issued for violating the chain law {{to the passage of}} the bill. Gibbs was named to the interim Transportation Legislation Review Committee {{at the end of the}} 2007 regular session.|$|E

5|$|In 1942, the Bureau of Public Roads {{began the}} process to start the {{construction}} design for the parkway. Federal <b>and</b> <b>state</b> <b>officials</b> commissioned the firm J.E. Greiner to create designs for the parkway, which included a large Y-junction at the southern terminus to connect with New York Avenue and the proposed Anacostia Freeway. Meanwhile, the northern end included a similar wye, with one end running to US 40 (Franklin Street) and the other end crossing the Inner Harbor, but this was modified in 1945 to the current configuration.|$|E
5|$|In May 2007, {{state and}} federal {{officials}} began closed-door negotiations about the possibility of extending legal cleanup deadlines for waste vitrification in exchange for shifting the focus of the cleanup to urgent priorities, such as groundwater remediation. Those talks stalled in October 2007. In early 2008, a $600million cut to the Hanford cleanup budget was proposed. Washington state officials expressed concern about the budget cuts, as well as missed deadlines and recent safety lapses at the site, and threatened to file a lawsuit alleging that the Department of Energy is in violation of environmental laws. They appeared to step back from that threat in April 2008 after another meeting of federal <b>and</b> <b>state</b> <b>officials</b> resulted in progress toward a tentative agreement.|$|E

5|$|In October 2011 city <b>and</b> <b>state</b> <b>officials</b> {{announced}} {{an agreement in}} which the UN {{would be allowed to}} build a long-sought new office tower adjacent to the existing campus on the current Robert Moses Playground, which would be relocated. In exchange, the United Nations would allow the construction of an esplanade along the East River that would complete the East River Greenway, a waterfront pedestrian and bicycle pathway. While host nation authorities have agreed to the provisions of the plan, it needs the approval of the United Nations in order to be implemented. The plan is similar in concept to an earlier proposal that had been announced in 2000 but did not move forward.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of several {{high-profile}} reports about hunger and malnutrition in the United States, the Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs had been created in July 1968, with McGovern as its chair. Seeking to dramatize the problem, in March 1969 McGovern took the committee to Immokalee, Florida, the base for 20,000 migrant farm workers. They saw graphic examples of hunger and malnutrition firsthand, but also encountered resistance and complaints about bad publicity from local <b>and</b> <b>state</b> <b>officials.</b> McGovern battled the Nixon administration and Southerners in Congress {{during much of the}} next year over an expanded Food Stamp Program; he had to compromise on a number of points, but legislation signed in 1970 established the principles of free food stamps and a nationwide standard for eligibility.|$|E
5|$|By {{shortly after}} the passage of the storm, the {{government}} of Veracruz opened 6,000emergency storm shelters for impacted citizens. Floodwaters from the rainfall inundated scores of houses and cars, with a total of 7,500families in Veracruz directly affected by the storm. The Mexican Army, combined with the efforts of police officers <b>and</b> <b>state</b> <b>officials,</b> worked with amphibious vehicles to rescue families in flooded houses, of whom many waited on rooftops; according to reports from the Civil Defense of the government of Veracruz, a person drowned in the city of Cerro Azul. Several people were reported missing, as well. Landslides from the flooding cut communications and left 66villages temporarily isolated. Across Veracruz, the most affected localities were Naranjos, Chinampa de Gorostiza, Tamalín, Tantima, Benito Juárez, Tamiahua, and Tempoal de Sánchez. The government of Veracruz {{declared a state of emergency}} for 14 municipalities. Damage in the state totaled over 100million pesos (2005MXN, $9.3million 2005USD, $10.3million 2008USD); the state government requested reconstruction aid amounting to the equivalent of the damage total.|$|E

5|$|Federal <b>and</b> <b>state</b> <b>officials</b> became {{concerned}} about ticket scalping and fraud related to {{sales of the}} tickets for the swearing-in ceremony. Senator Dianne Feinstein, chair of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, introduced legislation in mid-November 2008 to ban sales of tickets to the swearing-in ceremony. At the same time, the joint congressional committee contacted online auction operators, ticket resellers and classified listing services to block sales of the tickets. To address the committee's concerns, StubHub and eBay agreed to ban ticket sales for the swearing-in ceremony on all of its sites. Senator Feinstein re-introduced legislation in December 2008 to ban ticket sales for the swearing-in ceremony after amending the bill to exempt tickets issued by official presidential inaugural committees for inaugural event fundraising. The U.S.Senate failed to pass the final bill, which caused the bill {{to die in the}} closing days of the lame duck legislative session.|$|E
5|$|In {{return for}} iqtaʿat, annual {{customary}} payments, and honorary titles and robes, the amir al-ʿarab {{was expected to}} command his horsemen as auxiliaries in the wars against the Mongols, the Crusaders, their allies and rebellious Mamluk emirs. Another expectation of the amir al-ʿarab and the lower-ranking tribal chieftains was intelligence gathering regarding enemy movements near the frontier. Among the official duties of the amir al-ʿarab and the Syrian Bedouin tribes was {{the defense of the}} sultanate's boundaries, and maintenance and oversight of the roads, bridges and mountain passes of the desert and within their iqtaʿat. This also entailed the protection of merchant travelers and the annual Hajj pilgrim caravan, which traversed Bedouin territory to reach the Muslim holy cities of Mecca and Medina in the Hejaz. Tribesmen also served as desert guides for the army <b>and</b> <b>state</b> <b>officials.</b> The amir al-ʿarab was further responsible for collecting zakat (dues) on the livestock of the Bedouin tribes.|$|E
5|$|On September 19, 2003, President George W. Bush {{declared}} {{the entire state}} of Maryland as a disaster area, which allowed residents affected by the hurricane to apply for federal aid. FEMA officials urged residents and business owners with significant damage to call as soon as possible, while those with minimal damage were asked to wait for a few days. All residents in the state who received damage from the storm had sixty days to apply for assistance. Federal <b>and</b> <b>state</b> <b>officials</b> opened disaster recovery centers in Annapolis, Baltimore, Essex, and Prince Frederick five days after the hurricane passed through the area, with the centers designed to provide more information to those who applied for federal assistance. About six days after Isabel made landfall, additional disaster recovery centers opened in Rock Hall in Kent County, California in Saint Mary's County, Silver Spring in Montgomery County, Chester in Queen Anne's County, Crisfield in Somerset County, Cambridge in Dorchester County, and Easton in Talbot County. Around a month after the hurricane, officials placed some residents unable to live in their damaged homes into travel trailers because they had no options for alternate housing, such as staying with a relative or friend.|$|E

25|$|Some city <b>and</b> <b>state</b> <b>officials</b> {{have simply}} sought to remove slums.
