40|$|INTRODUCTION Phosphate esters {{are widely}} {{distributed}} in any organism. Nucleic acids, metabolic intermediates like glucose- 6 -phosphate, energy-rich substrates (AMP, creatine phosphate) are some obvious examples. While many metabolic intermediates are activated through {{the transfer of}} phosphate groups (e. g., by kinases) it is equally important that phosphate esters can also be rapidly broken down. The hydrolytic removal of phosphate groups from phosphoesters is catalyzed by phosphatases. Many phosphatases are highly substrate-specific, like those enzymes involved in signal transduction. A number of phosphatases, however, cleave virtually any phosphate ester. Such unspecific enzymes function mainly in the catabolic breakdown of metabolites or nutrients. Depending on the pH at which such phosphatases have optimal activity, we distinguish between acidic phosphatases (also called acid phosphatases) and alkaline phosphatases. The latter enzymes require divalent metal ions as cofactors and are common in animal tissues and bacteria. Acidic phosphatases are widely distributed in many organisms, including plants. They work optimally at ~ pH 5 without additional cofactors. The enzymes are classified as E. C. 3. 1. 3. 2. In this experiment, we will extract an acidic phosphatase from seedlings of mustard (Sinapis alba) and partially purifiy the enzyme by ammonium sulfate precipiation. Most important prerequisite for any enzyme isolation is an activity test. For this phosphatase, we {{take advantage of the}} broad substrate specificity and use an artificial substrate that changes its color after hydrolytic removal of the phosphate group: ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") Since the phosphatase is active only at acidic pH values, but p-nitrophenol is colored at basic pH values, we must change the pH following the enzyme reaction. We will incubate for 30 min at pH 4. 8, and then stop the reaction by adding NaOH. ### EXPERIMENTAL PROTOCOL **Week 1 - Day 1 ** You are provided with a flat of 5 - 8 days old mustard seedlings grown in the dark in a bed of vermiculite. ![Figure 2]([URL] "Figure 2 ") 1. Remove the 5 - 10 cm long seedlings from the vermiculite, wash <b>and</b> <b>pat</b> <b>dry</b> on paper towel. Weigh and record the weight. (use 25 - 50 g). ![Figure 3]([URL] "Figure 3 ") 2. Grind in a mortar with 75 ml of ice-cold water. 3. Make the volume up to 150 ml and transfer the slurry into the Polytron homogenizer. Homogenize 1 min at speed 5 (3 x 20 sec). 4. Filter the homogenate through 8 layers of cheese cloth into a cold beaker on ice. Remove 1 ml aliquot to an Eppendorf microfuge tube, and label as HOM and leave on ice. 5. Transfer the extract into one 250 ml centrifuge bottle. Balance against water or, if ready, against the extract of the other group. Always keep the extract on ice. 6. Centrifuge in the Sorvall superspeed centrifuge (B 7202) in GSA rotor (r = 12. 5 cm) at 9500 rpm (1, 000 x g) for 30 min. 7. Decant the supernatant (SN 1) (contains many organelles and the cytosol) into a graduated cylinder and note the volume. Remove 1 ml aliquot to an Eppendorf microfuge tube, and label as SN 1 and leave on ice. This will be used for subsequent protein and activity determination. Later freeze at - 20 °C. Resuspend the pellet which contains the cell debris and nuclei in 10 ml water, and take a 1 ml sample labeled P 1. Discard the remaining pellet. 8. Weigh the amount of solid (NH 4) 2 SO 4 required (0. 25 g/ml of solution SN 1). Record this amount. Leave the supernatant in a 250 ml beaker on ice bath and place on a magnetic stirrer. 9. Insert a clean stirring bar and using a spatula add small amounts of (NH 4) 2 SO 4 while stirring. This yields a [40 % saturated solution]([URL] which precipitates some proteins, but not the phosphatase. 10. Precipitate these proteins after 1 h by centrifugation in 50 ml centrifuge tube (approx. 35 ml per tube) at 31, 000 x g ([estimate the rpm]([URL] value using the rotor radius) for 30 min in the Hermle centrifuge at 4 °C (room B 8220). 11. Decant the supernatant (SN 2) into a grad. cylinder and note the volume. Remove 1 ml aliquot to an Eppendorf microfuge tube, label as SN 2 and leave on ice. Resuspend the pellet in 2 - 3 ml of ice cold water. Label as P 2 and freeze at - 20 °C. 12. To the supernatant, add another 0. 25 g (NH 4) 2 SO 4 /ml of the original volume of SN 1 while stirring slowly. The solution is now [70 % saturated]([URL] This should be stirred at least for 1 hour or you can leave this in the cold room while stirring overnight. **Day 2 ** 13. The next morning, transfer the suspension to a 50 ml centrifuge tube and spin for 30 min at the speed as in step 9. 14. Decant the supernatant (SN 3) and leave an aliquot (1 ml) in a microfuge tube. Resuspend the pellet in 5 ml of cold distilled water. Most of the phosphatase activity should be contained in this pellet. Take an aliquot (0. 5 ml) labeled P 3. 15. Divide among 4 microfuge tubes and remove insoluble proteins by spinning in the microfuge at full speed for 2 min. 16. Carefully transfer the supernatant into four eppendorf tubes. Label as SN 4. 17. Leave all the aliquots in a beaker with your initials on it in the - 20 °C freezer. You will use these fractions for further analysis ([see flow scheme]([URL] ![Table 1]([URL] "Table 1 ") All fractions will be subjected to a [protein]([URL] and [enzyme assay]([URL]...|$|E
30|$|The wheat {{culture has}} been {{introduced}} {{in our previous study}} (Zhao et al. 2013). In brief, the wheat seeds with sterilization treatment were germinated on wet filter paper for 7  days, and then fifty seedlings were transferred to 1  L glass beakers containing half-concentrated Hoagland’s solution (Lin and Xing 2008) for further growth at 25  °C and a lighting period of 16  h per day. When their roots reached 8  ±  1  cm, and leaves grew 10  ±  1  cm, these seedlings were transferred to an exposure apparatus containing half-concentrated Hoagland’s solution with each of PFCAs at 1  μg/mL for the study of PFCA uptake induced by salinity and temperature. After the wheat was grown for five days in nutrient solution at different salinities (0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4  %) or different temperatures (20, 25 and 30  °C), they were harvested at a time. The harvested wheat was divided into shoots and roots which were washed in deionized water to remove any external salt or PFCA residues <b>and</b> <b>patted</b> <b>dry</b> with a paper towel, and stored at − 20  °C until extraction. Three replicates for each salinity and temperature were used, including blank controls. During the five days of exposure, the PFCA-spiked nutrient solution was exchanged three times to keep the PFCA’s concentration at a constant level and the PFCA concentrations in the nutrient solution were also monitored.|$|R

30|$|Fish {{were allowed}} to thaw at room temperature, removed from plastic bags <b>and</b> <b>patted</b> <b>dry</b> with clean paper towels. Each fish was placed on plastic wrap liners in acid-rinsed {{dissecting}} pan for inspection. Weights and lengths were recorded followed by a count of lateral line scales to differentiate between longnose (C. catostomus) and white suckers (C. commersonii). After initial inspection, each fish was returned to the dissecting pan, an incision {{was made in the}} vent towards the head using stainless steel scissors to determine whether each fish was a gravid female, non-gravid female or male. From each of the 11 gravid females collected, ovaries, samples of skin, epaxial muscle and livers were removed and each positioned in individual weighing boats then placed in a Thelco model M drying cabinet at a temperature of 32  °C for 20  days. The wet to dry ratios of the 44 whole body homogenates averaged 0.267, a value close to the ratios of 0.284 for trout and 0.288 for non-game fishes reported by Fresquez and Ferenbaugh (1999). Therefore, all values of Se and Hg in the whole bodies of fish tissues are reported as wet weights by multiplying dry weights by a factor of 0.267. However, for the 44 individual tissues in the 11 gravid females, individual conversion factors were calculated for each ovary, skin, epaxial muscle and liver tissue. As an example of a conversion, the liver of the single gravid brown trout had a dry to wet conversion factor of 0.252.|$|R
40|$|Barrier creams and barrier creams with {{antifungal}} agents {{both are}} effective treatments of diaper dermatitis. Fungal yeast {{is present in}} over 90 % of diaper rashes, but {{is not necessarily the}} causative agent. In mild cases, antifungal agents may not perform better than barrier creams alone. In moderate to severe cases, patients will likely benefit from using an antifungal agent. For patients at increased risk for diaper dermatitis, such as those with diarrhea, taking oral antibiotics, wearing low-absorbance diaper material, better prevention may be possible using barrier cream with antifungal. In all cases, diaper dermatitis is best dealt with by following the ABCDEs: Air exposure –allow the diapered area to air dry, don’t over-tighten the diaper, allow naked nap time on a towel when possible Barrier cream – zinc oxide or petroleum, reapply with every diaper change, creams with antifungal agents may be better in severe rashes or when yeast infection is suspected Cleanliness – frequent diaper changes <b>and</b> baths, <b>pat</b> <b>dry</b> with a towel or air dry, avoid wipes with alcohol or scent Diaper changes – frequent changes, the less time spent in a dirty diaper the betterespecially with loose stools or low-absorbance diapers Education – teach caregivers about care of diapered chil...|$|R

30|$|Over 200 new {{external}} fixators {{are placed}} annually {{at the senior}} authors’ institution; the management of pin sites and pin site infections {{is an essential part}} of daily clinical practice. The prevention of infection protocol includes the following: intravenous antibiotics are given prior to skin incision and continued for 24 post-operatively; no tourniquet is used; and pins are inserted after pre-drilling with sharp drills using sleeves to protect soft tissues. Electrocautery is avoided at pin sites to prevent tissue necrosis. HA-coated tapered pins with cortical threads are used exclusively. For most applications, 6.0 -mm-diameter pins are used; however, 4.5 -mm pins are used in adult foot and forearm cases and for paediatric patients. Pin diameter is ensured to be < 33  % of the bone diameter. Pin site care starts on POD 2. Pin care is done once daily by cleaning each pin site with a new sterile cotton-tipped applicator that has been soaked in a solution of 1 : 1 hydrogen peroxide and normal saline. Dry sterile gauze is wrapped around each pin site. Daily showering is encouraged on POD 4 where the patients remove the dressings, allowing water to rinse the frame and use of an antibacterial liquid soap. The leg <b>and</b> frame are <b>patted</b> <b>dry</b> with a clean towel. Patients are allowed to swim in a chlorinated pool after 4  weeks. Most patients are allowed weight bearing as tolerated. Over time, some patients develop a non-infectious dermatitis for which we have learned that further dilution of the hydrogen peroxide solution is helpful. For example, instructions would be changed to use 1 part hydrogen peroxide and 3 parts normal saline.|$|R

40|$|Quality {{by design}} (QbD) and process {{analytical}} technology (PAT) have become {{priorities for the}} Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Numerous recent initiatives within CDER and FDA have had the objective of encouraging the pharmaceutical industry to utilize QbD <b>and</b> <b>PAT</b> in their product development and manufacturing processes. Although sterile products may be a minority compared to non-sterile dosage forms (e. g., solid orals), their absolute requirement for sterility make design {{and control of the}} manufacturing processes extremely critical. This emphasis on the manufacturing process makes the sterile drug product an obvious target for QbD <b>and</b> <b>PAT.</b> Although the FDA encourages QbD submissions, the utilization of QbD <b>and</b> <b>PAT</b> for sterile products so far is still limited.

40|$|Dhh 1 <b>and</b> <b>Pat</b> 1 in yeast are mRNA {{decapping}} activators/ translational repressors {{thought to}} play key {{roles in the}} transition of mRNAs from translation to degradation. However, {{little is known about}} the physical and functional relationships between these proteins and the translation machinery. We describe a previously unknown type of diauxic shiftdependent modulation of the intracellular locations of Dhh 1 <b>and</b> <b>Pat</b> 1. Like the formation of P bodies, this phenomenon changes the spatial relationship between components involved in translation and mRNA degradation. We report significant spatial separation of Dhh 1 <b>and</b> <b>Pat</b> 1 from ribosomes in exponentially growing cells. Moreover, biochemical analyses reveal that these proteins are excluded from polysomal complexes in exponentially growing cells, indicating that they may not be associated with active states of the translation machinery. In contrast, under diauxic growth shift conditions, Dhh 1 <b>and</b> <b>Pat</b> 1 are found to co-localize with polysomal complexes. This work suggests that Dhh 1 <b>and</b> <b>Pat</b> 1 functions are modulated by a relocalization mechanism that involves eIF 4 A. Pulldown experiments reveal that the intracellular binding partners of Dhh 1 <b>and</b> <b>Pat</b> 1 change as cells undergo the diauxic growth shift.
