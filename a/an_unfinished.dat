He instead sought out an existing script on which to base his next film, settling on what would become 1980's The Elephant Man.|$|E

5|$|From Leicester {{the march}} moved to Market Harborough. This {{was one of}} the least {{welcoming}} of all the overnight stops.

On Saturday 24 October the marchers reached Northampton, arriving {{at the same time as}} the blind group.

5|$|Historia Plantarum {{was written}} some time between c. 350 BC and c. 287 BC in ten volumes, of which nine survive.

He continually revised the manuscript, and it remained in <b>an</b> <b>unfinished</b> state on his death. The condensed style of the text, with its many lists of examples, indicate that Theophrastus used the manuscript as the working notes for lectures to his students, rather than intending it to be read as a book.|$|E

In June, Marquis was appointed agency physician to the Northern Cheyenne. He arrived in the agency village of Lame Deer, Montana, in early July.|$|E
