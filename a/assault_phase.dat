5|$|On 13–14 May, the Germans were vulnerable. A strong {{attack at}} this point by the French {{armoured}} units could have prevented Guderian from breaking out of the Meuse bridgeheads and changed {{the outcome of the}} campaign. However, the French commanders, already deeply schooled and versed in the rather staunchly defensively-focused broad, generalized doctrine of methodological warfare, were located far to the rear, which meant they lacked a real-time and up-to-date picture of the battle. When intelligence did filter through, it was out-of-date. This was to prove fatal, especially coupled with the case of the matter that the French generalship at large was expecting a considerably more prolonged process of initial German <b>assault</b> <b>phase</b> and overall attack effort as a whole.|$|E
5|$|With {{the beach}} <b>assault</b> <b>phase</b> {{completed}} the RCTs reorganized into infantry regiments and battalions {{and over the}} course of the next two days achieved the original D-Day objectives. On the 1st divisional front the 18th Infantry Regiment blocked an attempt by two companies from the 916th and 726th Grenadiers to break out of WN-63 and Colleville, both of which were subsequently taken by the 16th Infantry Regiment which also moved on Port-en-Bessin. The main advance was made by the 18th Infantry Regiment, with the 3rd battalion of the 26th Infantry Regiment attached, south and south-eastwards. The heaviest opposition was encountered at Formigny where troops of the 2nd battalion 915th Grenadiers had reinforced the headquarters troops of 2nd battalion 916th Grenadiers. Attempts by 3/26 and B/18 with support from the tanks of B/745 were held off and the town did not fall until the morning of June 8. The threat of an armored counterattack kept the 18th Infantry Regiment on the defensive for the rest of June 8. The 26th Infantry Regiment's three battalions, having been attached to the 16th, 18th and 115th Regiments the previous day, spent June 8 reassembling before pushing eastwards, forcing the 1st battalion of the German 726th Grenadiers to spend the night extricating itself from the pocket thus forming between Bayeux and Port-en-Bessin. By the morning of June 9 the 1st Division had established contact with the British XXX Corps, thus linking Omaha with Gold.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1944, 120th LAA Rgt moved to Southend-on-Sea, where in late March it received nine Crusader AA Mark I tracked self-propelled (SP) Bofors guns, which would have a special role in the assault landing on D-Day. In addition, 76th AA Brigade assigned 1618 LAA Rgt Platoon of 323rd Company, Royal Army Service Corps (RASC), to the regiment to provide mobility. In March the regiment moved back to Southampton for exercises, where it remained until May, when the units required for the <b>assault</b> <b>phase</b> of Overlord began to gather in southern England. 120th LAA Rgt was already at Southampton {{while the rest of}} the brigade (including the rear echelons of 120th LAA Rgt) concentrated at Southend.|$|E

40|$|International audiencePurpose: This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the coordination of lower limb muscles during a specific fencing gesture in relation to its mechanical effectiveness. Methods: Maximal isokinetic concentric and isometric plantarflexor, dorsiflexor, knee and hip extensor and flexor torques of 10 female elite saber fencers were assessed and compared between both legs. Sabers completed three trials of a specific fencing gesture (i. e., marché-fente) on a 6. 60 -m-long force platform system. Surface EMG activities of 15 lower limb muscles were recorded in time with ground reaction forces and separated into four distinct <b>assault</b> <b>phases.</b> EMG signals were normalized to the muscle activity assessed during maximal isometric contraction. Mechanical and EMG data were compared between both legs over the entire assault and in each phase (ANOVA). Potential correlations between muscle strength and average EMG activities were tested (Bravais–Pearson coefficient). Results: EMG activity patterns showed that rear hip and knee extensor and plantarflexor muscles were mainly activated during propulsive (concentric) phases, while front hip and knee extensor muscles were strongly solicited during the final braking (eccentric) phase to decelerate the body mass. Although fencers presented greater maximal hip (+ 10 %) and knee (+ 26 %) extensor strength in the front than in the rear leg (P G 0. 05), rear hip and knee extensor strength was significantly correlated to the maximal anteroposterior velocity (r = 0. 60 – 0. 81). Moreover, muscle activity of the rear extensors was related to average velocity during the second propulsive phase (phase 3). Conclusions: This study gathers the first evidence of a crucial role of the rear extensor muscles in fencing speed performance. Such findings suggest interesting perspectives {{in the definition of}} specific training or rehabilitation programs for elite fencers...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} who resists sexual assault and what happens, data were examined from a probability sample of 3, 132 adult community residents of Los Angeles, California. Seventy-five per {{cent of the}} respondents reporting an assault (n = 365) {{indicated that they had}} attempted to resist their most recent assault; talking was the most frequently used resistance strategy. The strongest predictor to emerge in the multivariate analyses of resistance was timing of assault: respondents assaulted only in childhood were less likely to resist than either respondents assaulted only in adulthood, or respondents <b>assaulted</b> in both <b>phases.</b> Univariate analyses indicated that resistance reduced the probability of sexual contact, however multivariate analyses suggested that assailant use of force was the most important determinant of assault outcome...|$|R
25|$|The task of 13th Corps was {{to cross}} the Straits and land in two small bays north of Reggio. The 1st Canadian Division, landing at Fox Beach, a short {{distance}} north of Reggio, were to capture {{the town and the}} airfield south of town, while 5th Division took San Giovanni, to the north, and the coastline to Canitello. The artillery barrage on the beach was planned {{to take advantage of the}} LCA's splinter-proof armoured protection. The barrage would lift from the beach only moments before touchdown for the LCAs. Apart from some craft landing in the wrong places, and some mixing of the divisions, the assault troops landed without difficulty and with little hindrance from the enemy.

40|$|Sexual {{abuse is}} defined as use of child or {{adolescent}} by the adults for satisfying of sexual urges and needs with forcing, threatening or tricking. Sexual abuse {{can be in the}} form of sexual abuse without touch, sexual touch, interfemoral intercourse, sexual penetration, and sexual exploitation. The prevalence of sexual abuse is reported as 10 - 40 %. It is seen in female four times more than in males. Abusers are frequently male, only 5 - 15 % of them are female. The abuse by females is usually towards male child. Thirty-fifty percent of abuse cases among child and adolescent are outside the family including strangers or familiar person. Some features of abusers are introvert personality, pedophilic and antisocial personality. Most of the abusers have a history of sexual abuse or aggression during childhood. Sexual intercourse between two people who are not allowed to marry by law is called as incest. Family pattern of incest is defined globally as disorganized and dysfunctional. The most commonly reported familial pattern is rigid and patriarchal family pattern with a harsh father using force quite frequently. The clinical features and impacts of the sexual abuse on the child varies according to the relation between abusers and the child, form of abuse, duration of abuse, presence of physical <b>assault,</b> developmental <b>phase,</b> child age and psychological development before the abuse. Sexual abuse history may result in psychiatric disorders including anxiety, depression, substance dependence, suicide act, borderline personality disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder. Abuse negatively affects interpersonal relationships and self esteem of abused individuals. Several studies reported close association between risky sexual behaviors in adulthood and a history of of sexual abuse during childhood. Four traumatic dynamics including traumatic sexuality with abuse, feeling of betrayal, weakness, and stigmatization exist in childhood abuse. Trauma can cause behavioral and psychological results by itself, early trauma may also lead to biological effects. Especially traumas during neuron plasticity phase may lead hypersensitivity of neuroendocrine stress response. Early life stresses are shown to lead changes in corticotrophin releasing factor system in preclinical and clinical phase studies. In the treatment of sexual abuse, emotional process related with trauma should be focused on. This process may be conducted with play therapy. Development of higher level defense mechanism, increasing ego capacity, orientation to social activity and personal activity according to skills is aimed. For the elimination of guiltiness related with stigmatization, the child should be told that it is not herhis fault to incorporate into sexual interaction and the culprit is abuser. It is fairly important for medical staff, school and family to have sufficient information about sexual abuse for prevention and early recognition...|$|R
50|$|Shortly {{after the}} Marine Corps {{submitted}} their FY 2015 budget request in February 2014, General Jim Amos decided to postpone {{development of the}} Amphibious Combat Vehicle program and return funding to the Marine Personnel Carrier. Originally, the Marines planned to buy both the ACV and MPC to replace outdated vehicles to complement each other for different missions. During an amphibious assault, {{a limited number of}} ACVs would carry the initial landing force from ship to shore and further inland. After the beach was secured, a larger number of MPCs would be landed by landing craft to reinforce the first wave. When budgets tightened, the ACV was taken as the priority and funding was removed from the MPC, with the service figuring they could buy an off-the-shelf wheeled troop transport later when money was available. Technical challenges to the proposed ACV continued to mount as funds kept getting constrained, so the decision was made that wheeled APC advancements were significant enough to address needs quicker. Marines still want a high-speed fully amphibious vehicle to move troops from the ocean to a beach with enough armor, mobility, and firepower to fight while on land, so a phased approach was decided for the ACV. Phase 1 would be the procurement of an interim vehicle to replace the aging Amphibious <b>Assault</b> Vehicle, while <b>Phase</b> 2 would develop desired capabilities for the platform. There was some suggestion of incorporating the MPC into ACV Phase 1, and combining it with a high-speed watercraft that can bring it to the landing area, or close enough that it can use its own limited amphibious capabilities. If the MPC had funding restored in 2015, time spent on holding a competition and evaluations would lead to operational quantities being available around 2020.|$|R
