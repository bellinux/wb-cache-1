5|$|A {{concern for}} sexual <b>activity</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> not {{dangerous}} {{but that can}} be upsetting for both partners is bladder or bowel leakage due to urinary or fecal incontinence. Couples can prepare for sex by draining the bladder using intermittent catheterization or placing towels down in advance. People with indwelling urinary catheters must take special care with them, removing them or taping {{them out of the}} way.|$|E

5|$|Diseases such as {{chlamydia}} and gonorrhoea {{are also}} important causes of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and subsequent infertility in women. Another important consequence of some STIs such as genital herpes and syphilis {{increase the risk of}} acquiring HIV by three-fold, and can also influence its transmission progression. Worldwide, women and girls are at greater risk of HIV/AIDS. STIs are in turn associated with unsafe sexual <b>activity</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> often unconsensual.|$|E

5|$|El Hatillo {{preserves}} {{some of its}} colonial architecture, {{including an}} 18th-century parish church and a unique Romanian Orthodox Church. The municipality also has a rich artistic culture, {{with at least two}} important musical festivals celebrated yearly, and numerous holiday celebrations reflecting the heritage of El Hatillo. The culture, the pleasant temperature, the rural landscape, and the gastronomy of the municipality have made it a place of interest for visitors to the city, and a desirable place to live. The municipality receives a part of its income from tourism, an <b>activity</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> promoted by the government.|$|E

25|$|A {{resident}} {{who wishes to}} challenge the validity of an ordinance need not wait until it has been enforced against them (although it may be challenged at that time). Instead, a resident may bring an action for a declaratory judgment alleging that the ordinance is void {{because it was not}} properly noticed, goes beyond the county charter, is arbitrary, discriminatory, or unreasonably vague, or that it is preempted by state or federal law. An ordinance will be deemed preempted if it addresses an activity for which the state has prohibited local regulation altogether, or where it is inconsistent with state law. An ordinance may not permit an <b>activity</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> expressly prohibited by state law, or prohibits an <b>activity</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> expressly permitted by state law. However, if some state regulation exists as to an activity, political subdivisions may impose further regulations on that activity so long as it is possible for a resident to comply with both sets of regulations.|$|E

25|$|The gap {{branch is}} rarely relied on {{because there is}} so little left to default to the federal {{government}} after taking into account the enumerated provincial power over property and civil rights under section 92(13) which applies to any transaction, person or <b>activity</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> found within the province. Historically new subject matters, such as aeronautics, do not necessarily fall residually to the federal government, per Johannesson v West St Paul (Rural Municipality of), 1952.|$|E
25|$|The {{visualizations}} and diagrams link to {{a variety}} of assessments, usually handled in Excel type spreadsheets — to increase value outputs, to leverage knowledge and intangibles for improving financial and organizational performance, and to find new value opportunities.

25|$|Solo {{masturbation}} is {{a sexual}} <b>activity</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> free of risk of sexually transmitted infections. With {{two or more}} participants, the risk of sexually transmitted infections, while not eliminated, is much less than with most forms of penetrative sex. Support for such a view, and for making masturbation part of the American sex education curriculum, led to the dismissal of US Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders during the Clinton administration. Some EU Nations promote masturbation in their sex education curricula.|$|E

25|$|In {{individuals}} with WPW, electrical <b>activity</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> initiated in the SA node travels through the accessory pathway, {{as well as}} through the AV node to activate the ventricles via both pathways. Since the accessory pathway does not have the impulse slowing properties of the AV node, the electrical impulse first activates the ventricles via the accessory pathway, and immediately afterwards via the AV node. This gives the short PR interval and slurred upstroke of the QRS complex known as the delta wave.|$|E
25|$|Historically {{the marsh}} {{supported}} an extremely diverse wetlands ecosystem, {{with a variety}} of primary productivity plants including pickleweed, eelgrass and giant bulrush (Scirpus californiens). There has also been historically significant fish, mammal, amphibian and avafauna. The marsh is a significant element within the Pacific Flyway providing resting and feeding areas for migratory birds. As of 2006 this ecosystem has been significantly compromised by fill, levee formation, dredging and other development; estimates generally state that 75 percent of the original biological productivity of the marsh has been destroyed. However, it remains a significant habitat and is subject to meaningful wetland restoration <b>activity,</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> being actively evaluated as of the 2000-2006 timeframe.|$|E
25|$|RTA has rRNA N-glycosylase <b>activity</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{responsible}} for the cleavage of a glycosidic bond within the large rRNA of the 60S subunit of eukaryotic ribosomes. RTA specifically and irreversibly hydrolyses the N-glycosidic bond of the adenine residue at position 4324 (A4324) within the 28S rRNA, but leaves the phosphodiester backbone of the RNA intact. The ricin targets A4324 that is contained in a highly conserved sequence of 12 nucleotides universally found in eukaryotic ribosomes. The sequence, 5’-AGUACGAGAGGA-3’, termed the sarcin-ricin loop, is important in binding elongation factors during protein synthesis. The depurination event rapidly and completely inactivates the ribosome, resulting in toxicity from inhibited protein synthesis. A single RTA molecule in the cytosol is capable of depurinating approximately 1500 ribosomes per minute.|$|E

25|$|Given {{conflicting}} {{evidence of the}} costs and benefits of smoking, controversy remains on what the clinical response to smoking in people with schizophrenia should be. Historically, mental health providers have overlooked smoking in schizophrenia, based on the rationale that patients with serious mental illness already suffer from significant stress and disability and as such should be allowed to engage in smoking as an <b>activity</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> pleasurable though destructive. There is also historical precedent of mental health providers, particularly in patient settings, to use cigarettes as a way to manipulate patient behavior, such as rewarding good behavior with cigarettes or withholding cigarettes to encourage medication compliance. However, research showing that eliminating even one risk factor for disease can significantly improve long-term health outcomes has resulted in the dominant view among clinicians opposing smoking.|$|E
25|$|Most East Asian {{immigration}} in Buenos Aires comes from China. Chinese immigration {{is the fourth}} largest in Argentina, with {{the vast majority of}} them living in Buenos Aires and its metropolitan area. In the 1980s, most of them were from Taiwan, but since the 1990s the majority of Chinese immigrants come from the continental province of Fujian. The mainland Chinese who came from Fujian mainly installed supermarkets throughout the city and the suburbs; these supermarkets are so common that, in average, there is one every two and a half blocks and are simply referred to as el chino ("the Chinese"). Japanese immigrants are mostly from the Okinawa Prefecture. They started the dry cleaning business in Argentina, an <b>activity</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> considered idiosyncratic to the Japanese immigrants in Buenos Aires. Korean Immigration occurred after the division of Korea; they mainly settled in Flores and Once.|$|E
25|$|Chasers may operate {{whenever}} significant thunderstorm {{activity is}} occurring, whatever the date. This most commonly includes more sporadic activity occurring in warmer {{months of the}} year bounding the spring maximum, such as the active month of April {{and to a lesser extent}} March. The focus in the summer months is the Central or Northern Plains states and the Prairie Provinces, the Upper Midwest, or on to just east of the Colorado Front Range. An annually inconsistent and substantially smaller peak of severe thunderstorm and tornado activity also arises in the transitional months of autumn, particularly October and November. This follows a pattern somewhat the reverse of the spring pattern with the focus beginning in the north then dropping south and with an overall eastward shift. In the area with the most consistent significant tornado activity, the Southern Plains, the tornado season is intense but is relatively brief whereas central to northern and eastern areas experience less intense and consistent <b>activity</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> diffused over a longer span of the year.|$|E
