5|$|Developed in the United States, the <b>American</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Spaniel</b> is the Wisconsin state dog. The breed {{originated}} in the areas along the Fox River and its tributary the Wolf River during the early 19th century. Hunters needed a dog that could work on both land and water, a versatile hunter skilled at bringing {{in a variety of}} game. Hunters also wanted a hunting dog compact enough to be transported in a small skiff, one that was able to withstand Wisconsin's cold water temperatures. Breeds involved {{in the creation of the}} <b>American</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Spaniel</b> are thought to have included the English Water Spaniel, Irish Water Spaniel, Curly Coated Retriever, native Indian Dogs, the Poodle, and either the Sussex Spaniel or another type of field spaniel.|$|E
5|$|Pre-dating the Irish Water Spaniel {{and thought}} to have been {{referred}} to by Shakespeare in Macbeth, it is believed to have genetically influenced several modern breeds of dog, including the <b>American</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Spaniel,</b> Curly Coated Retriever and the modern variety of Field Spaniel. It is unknown if the breed was involved {{in the creation of the}} Irish Water Spaniel.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{was made}} the state dog of Wisconsin in 1985. The <b>American</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Spaniel</b> remains a rare breed. During 1998 only 233 puppies were {{registered}} with the AKC, with an estimated 3,000 dogs in existence mostly around the Midwestern United States, in particular in Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan. In 2010, the breed was ranked 143rd most popular breed in the United States, out of 167 breeds. This is a decrease since 2000, when the breed was ranked 125th. The dogs are not classified specifically as either retrievers or as spaniels and so may not compete in AKC field trials, but may compete in AKC hunt tests (spaniel and retriever tests) and retriever hunting tests sponsored by the AWSC, the breed club in the United States. The <b>American</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Spaniel</b> Field Association {{was set up in}} 1993 by breed enthusiasts supporting AKC Spaniel classification and looking to provide field training opportunities to owners of the breed. In a vote held of members of the AWSC in 1999, they chose to keep the breed unclassified.|$|E

50|$|The Irish <b>Water</b> <b>Spaniel</b> is {{a native}} Irish breed dating back at least 1000 years. It is {{believed}} in Irish folklore to be the descendant of the Dobhar-ch√∫. It is probable {{that more than one}} ancient breed of spaniel has gone into its makeup. It is not known from which other breeds Irish <b>Water</b> <b>Spaniels</b> were developed. The acknowledged father of the breed, Justin McCarthy from Dublin, left no breeding records. All manner of dogs have been suggested including: the Poodle, Portuguese Water Dog, Barbet, generic old water dog, the now-extinct English <b>Water</b> <b>Spaniel</b> as well as the Northern and Southern <b>Water</b> <b>Spaniels,</b> but whether Irish <b>Water</b> <b>Spaniels</b> are antecedents, descendants, or mixtures of these other breeds is a matter of some speculation. What is clear is that the breed has ancient roots. The modern breed as we know it was developed in Ireland in the 1830s.|$|R
500|$|The breed is {{mentioned}} specifically by name {{as early as}} 1802, in Sportsman's Cabinet, where it is described as having [...] "hair long and naturally curled, not loose and shaggy"; the description accompanied an engraving of a liver and white curly coated spaniel. This shows that they pre-date the Irish <b>Water</b> <b>Spaniel</b> which was not developed as a breed until the 1830s. Unfortunately as the person credited with developing the Irish <b>Water</b> <b>Spaniel,</b> Justin McCarthy, left no written records, it is unknown if the English <b>Water</b> <b>Spaniel</b> was involved in its development. During {{the first half of}} the 18th century, the English <b>Water</b> <b>Spaniel</b> was used for duck hunting in East Anglia.|$|R
5|$|The <b>American</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Spaniel,</b> (often {{abbreviated}} to AWS), is a breed of spaniel which {{originated in the}} United States. Developed {{in the state of}} Wisconsin during the 19th century from a number of other breeds, including the Irish and English Water Spaniels. The breed was saved by Dr. Fred J. Pfeifer, who set up the breed club and standard, and whose work led to recognition for the breed by the United Kennel Club, and later, the American Kennel Club. While they are the state dog of Wisconsin, they remain a rare breed.|$|E
25|$|Standard Poodles {{have been}} winning titles against the more widely used native breeds like the Chesapeake Bay Retriever, Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever, <b>American</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Spaniel</b> and Labrador Retriever. Thus far 13 Standard Poodles have won Master Hunt titles (12 in the United States, 1 in Canada) and several more have won senior and junior titles {{on both sides}} of the border. Currently only the United Kennel Club in the US recognizes the Standard Poodle as a Sporting dog, thus in spite of this subtype of poodle being ineligible for field {{competitions}} more and more are appearing in the field as waterfowl dogs and hunters of pheasant in tall grass, the latter especially in the Midwest.|$|E
500|$|Due to Pfeifer's work, {{the breed}} was {{recognized}} by the United Kennel Club (UKC) as the <b>American</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Spaniel</b> in 1920, and by the Field Dog Stud Book in 1938. Dr. Pfeifer's own dog, named [...] "Curly Pfeifer" [...] was the first <b>American</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Spaniel</b> to be registered with UKC. John Scofield of Missouri and Thomas Brogdan of Rush Lake, Wisconsin worked together with the <b>American</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Spaniel</b> Club (AWSC), gaining the breed recognition with the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1940. Prior to recognition by the AKC, the breed had not been shown in the show ring before.|$|E
500|$|Paintings by Henry Bernard Chalon and Ramsay Richard Reinagle both show English <b>Water</b> <b>Spaniels</b> {{working with}} their masters [...] hunting ducks. An {{engraving}} by Henry Thomas Alken Snr. shows {{a slightly different}} looking English <b>Water</b> <b>Spaniel,</b> but also reinforces its area of work by again showing it while duck hunting. In The Sportsman's Repository (1820), the author advises that if an individual wishes to hunt ducks or {{any other type of}} waterfowl, then the hunter had best use an English <b>Water</b> <b>Spaniel.</b>|$|R

This led some writers and judges of that time to believe that the English <b>Water</b> <b>Spaniel</b> was merely a cross of the Irish <b>Water</b> <b>Spaniel</b> as entrants in dogs shows in that same class do not match the description of the dog from earlier periods. Dogs awarded prizes as <b>Water</b> <b>Spaniels</b> during this period have been described as having [...] "coats as flat as a Clumber, but with a bit of longish hair about the top of the skull." ...|$|R

500|$|The breed has {{links to}} the Boykin Spaniel, and {{is thought to have}} been the main breed used to develop the Boykin. The {{differences}} between the Boykin and the AWS are negligible with some dog historians suggesting that the original Boykin, called [...] "Dumpy", who was found on the streets of Spartanburg, South Carolina, was actually an <b>American</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Spaniel</b> who had been misplaced in transit. However the breed clubs for the Boykin do not agree with this account.|$|E
500|$|Writing in 1967, author John F. Gordon stated, [...] "After {{two centuries}} of {{breeding}} it is now extinct. None have been seen for over thirty years." [...] Descendant breeds of the English Water Spaniel are thought to include the <b>American</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Spaniel,</b> which was also developed using additional stock from the Irish Water Spaniel and the Flat Coated Retriever breeds. The Curly Coated Retriever is considered to have descended from the Poodle, the retrieving setter, the St. John's water dog and the English Water Spaniel. Records for {{the origin of the}} modern Field Spaniel are more precise and show that one of the four progenitor dogs used in creating the breed was an English Water Spaniel-Cocker Spaniel cross which was registered at the time as a Sussex Spaniel due to his liver colour.|$|E

Its actual origin is lost in antiquity but probably stems from corded herding stock (see Komondor).|$|E
50|$|During the {{formation}} of the modern breed known as the Curly-coated Retriever, several breeds were used to bring their characteristics into this new breed. These included Poodles, Wetterhouns, Barbets, Irish <b>Water</b> <b>Spaniels,</b> and breeds that are now extinct, including the Large Rough Water Dog and the Tweed <b>Water</b> <b>Spaniel.</b> The Curly-coated Retriever has been considered purebred since the early 20th century.|$|R
50|$|The Irish <b>Water</b> <b>Spaniel</b> is a sturdy, cobby dog {{native to}} Ireland. The coat, {{consisting}} of dense curls, sheds very little. (see Moult) The colour is liver/puce {{and has a}} very definite purple hue unlike the colour of any other known breed. The non-shedding characteristic of the coat means that people usually allergic to dogs might have less of an allergic reaction to Irish <b>Water</b> <b>Spaniels</b> (see hypoallergenic).|$|R
500|$|Very {{unlike the}} Irish <b>Water</b> <b>Spaniel</b> in appearance, the English <b>Water</b> <b>Spaniel</b> [...] more closely resembled a curly-haired {{version of the}} Springer Spaniel, with some traits of the Collie, poodle, and setter.

50|$|The Boykin Spaniel is {{most often}} worked as a nonslip retriever, though it {{originated}} as a duck- and turkey-flushing dog. Many would classify it as a flushing spaniel {{rather than as a}} retriever. Similarly, the <b>American</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Spaniel</b> could be listed in either category. Dogs such as the Poodle, which are rarely used in hunting today, are difficult to classify, but their traditional job was that of a retriever.|$|E
50|$|The breed {{is alleged}} to have been {{developed}} in the Pont-Audemer region of France in the nineteenth century. While the exact origin of the breed isn't known, it is thought that stock from both the English <b>Water</b> <b>Spaniel</b> and Irish <b>Water</b> <b>Spaniels</b> may have played a part in the breed's original makeup. In the early 20th century, outside France, they were considered more useful as a setter than doing typical spaniel type work.|$|R
50|$|Linda P. Case, of the University of Illinois, speculated the Tweed <b>Water</b> <b>Spaniel</b> was {{so named}} because it was {{developed}} on the estate of Lord Tweedmouth, and in fact was simply the original name for a breed of dog that later became the Golden Retriever.
