5|$|The {{child would}} grow up healthy, but {{with some of the}} {{behaviours}} of a pig. She would eat from a silver trough, and speak only in grunts or with a grunting sound to her speech. The only child of her parents, she would stand to inherit a large fortune, but her parents would be concerned <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> become of her after their death. They would thus make arrangements either to find a man willing to marry her, or to use their fortune to endow a hospital on condition that the hospital take care of her for the remainder of her life.|$|E
5|$|The {{problems}} amongst John's wider family {{continued to}} grow. His elder brother Geoffrey died during a tournament in 1186, leaving a posthumous son, Arthur, and an elder daughter, Eleanor. Geoffrey's death brought John slightly {{closer to the}} throne of England. The uncertainty <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> happen after Henry's death continued to grow; Richard was keen to join a new crusade and remained concerned that whilst he was away Henry would appoint John his formal successor.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a report}} that on 21 November 1797 Ceres sighted the island of Sonsorol while sailing from Port Jackson to China. Unfortunately, readily {{available}} online resources can provide no more information <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> represent Hedley and Ceress second voyage to the region.|$|E
25|$|There is {{considerable}} debate <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> {{have been a}} more appropriate term. Some scholars, notably Ruth Ross, argue that mana (prestige, authority) would have more accurately conveyed the transfer of sovereignty. However, it has more recently been argued by others, including Judith Binney, that mana {{would not have been}} appropriate. This is because mana {{is not the same thing}} as sovereignty, and also because no-one can give up their mana.|$|E
25|$|Because he {{had been}} called for active duty while serving as Secretary of State, Blunt's office responded to {{questions}} <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> happen if the governor were called to service. In accordance with Pentagon regulations and the Missouri Constitution, if Blunt was called for military duty while Governor, {{he would have been}} required to either transfer his gubernatorial powers to Lieutenant Governor Peter Kinder, or resign from the Naval Reserve.|$|E

25|$|Continuing {{the use of}} Nazi {{inspiration}} for the Empire, J. J. Abrams, the director of , {{has said that the}} First Order, an Imperial offshoot which serves as the main antagonist of the sequel trilogy, is also inspired by another aspect of the Nazi regime. Abrams spoke of how several Nazis fled to Argentina after the war and he claims that the concept for the First Order came from conversations between the scriptwriters <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> have happened if they had started working together again.|$|E
25|$|With the {{decision}} made, the Air Ministry finally allowed window {{to be used}} in July 1943. It was used {{for the first time on}} a raid on Hamburg on the night of 24/25 July 1943. The effects were spectacular; having become accustomed to using radar to guide their defences, window produced so many false targets that the operators had no idea what to do. AA guns were seen to fire randomly into the sky while night fighters flew in circles. The attacking force lost only 12 aircraft, 1.5% of the force, <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> be expected from entirely random events.|$|E
25|$|In {{coastal areas}} because the ocean tide is quite {{out of step}} with the earth tide, at high ocean tide there is an excess (or at low tide a deficit) of water <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> be the {{gravitational}} equilibrium level and the adjacent ground falls (or rises) in response to the resulting differences in weight. Displacements caused by ocean tidal loading can exceed the displacements due to the earth body tide. Sensitive instruments far inland often have to make similar corrections. Atmospheric loading and storm events may also be measurable, though the masses in movement are less weighty.|$|E

25|$|The {{discrepancies}} {{in the various}} figures {{can be attributed to}} several factors: first of all, entire families were killed, and many of the survivors were subsequently scattered across the country. The absence of relatives made tallying the dead more difficult, as did the severe warnings the villagers received in the immediately ensuing years <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> happen if they discussed the massacre. The fact that many of the victims were burnt alive in a single, small enclosure complicated the identification of remains and, to date, it is not certain that all the clandestine graves in the vicinity of Plan de Sánchez have been found.|$|E
25|$|Though the Big Bang {{theory was}} met with much {{skepticism}} when first introduced, it has become well-supported by several independent observations. However, current physics can only describe the early universe from 10−43 seconds after the Big Bang (where zero time corresponds to infinite temperature); a theory of quantum gravity {{would be required to}} understand events before that time. Nevertheless, many physicists have speculated <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> have preceded this limit, and how the universe came into being. For example, one interpretation is that the Big Bang occurred coincidentally, and when considering the anthropic principle, it is sometimes interpreted as implying the existence of a multiverse.|$|E
25|$|With five overs {{being cut}} off the Warwickshire chase, they needed 118 from 15 overs, and they had got to 115 for 8 with one ball {{remaining}} and Dewald Pretorius and an injured Heath Streak, who had not bowled, at the crease. The umpires consulted, and were uncertain <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> happen if Warwickshire scored two - which, in the event, happened. As the par scores under Duckworth-Lewis were level, the captains agreed to have a bowl-off (alternatively the umpires could have forced a bowl-off or decided the game on a toss of the coin). After five players had {{tried to get the}} stumps down, both teams had managed the feat twice, and now a sudden death style bowl-off followed. The next player from each side managed to get the stumps down once each, so the score was now 3-3, but Warwickshire's Heath Streak missed both his attempts and Tim Murtagh got the stumps down and won the match for the hosts by 4-3.|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} to the referendum result, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau declared that he would seek to [...] "patriate" [...] the Canadian Constitution and bring <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> eventually become the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. During tense negotiations in November 1981, an agreement was reached between Trudeau and nine of the ten premiers by Trudeau, but not Lévesque. The Constitution Act of 1982 was enacted without the Quebec National Assembly's symbolic approval.|$|E
500|$|The sixth film in {{the series}} was {{initially}} planned as a prequel to the original series, with younger actors portraying {{the crew of the}} Enterprise while attending Starfleet Academy, but the idea was discarded because of negative reaction from the original cast and the fans. Faced with producing a new film in time for Star Trek's 25th anniversary, Nicholas Meyer, the director of , and Denny Martin Flinn wrote a script based on a suggestion from Leonard Nimoy <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> happen if [...] "the Wall came down in space", touching on the contemporary events of the Cold War.|$|E
500|$|Docter created Dug {{as he felt}} {{it would}} be {{refreshing}} to show what a dog thinks, rather than what people assume it thinks. Knowledge of canine communication, body language and pack behaviors for the artists and animators to portray such thoughts came from consultant Dr. Ian Dunbar, veterinarian, dog behaviorist and trainer. The idea for Alpha's voice derived from thinking <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> happen if someone broke a record player and it always played at a high pitch. Russell {{was added to the}} story at a later date than Dug and Kevin; his presence, as well as the construction workers, helped to make the story feel less [...] "episodic".|$|E

500|$|The song {{is about}} the inevitability of death and the foolishness of fearing it, and was written when Dharma was {{thinking}} <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> happen if he died at a young age. Lyrics such as [...] "Romeo and Juliet are together in eternity" [...] have led many listeners to interpret the song to be about a murder-suicide pact, but Dharma says the song is about eternal love, rather than suicide. He used Romeo and Juliet as motifs to describe a couple believing they would meet again in the afterlife. He guessed that [...] "40,000 men and women" [...] died each day, and the figure was used {{several times in the}} lyrics.|$|E
500|$|The World Without Us is a non-fiction book <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> {{happen to}} the natural and built {{environment}} if humans suddenly disappeared, written by American journalist Alan Weisman and published by St. Martin's Thomas Dunne Books. It is a book-length expansion of Weisman's own February 2005 Discover article [...] "Earth Without People". Written largely as a thought experiment, it outlines, for example, how cities and houses would deteriorate, how long man-made artifacts would last, and how remaining lifeforms would evolve. Weisman concludes that residential neighborhoods would become forests within 500 years, and that radioactive waste, bronze statues, plastics, and Mount Rushmore would be among the longest-lasting evidence of human presence on Earth.|$|E
500|$|In December 1944, the Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson, ordered Groves, now the Director of the Manhattan Project, {{to find a}} deputy. Stimson was {{concerned}} <b>about</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> happen if Groves became incapacitated. [...] "You can have any officer in the Army," [...] Stimson told Groves, [...] "no matter who he is, or what duty he is on." [...] Groves told Colonel Kenneth Nichols, {{the commander of the}} Manhattan District, that his first choice would be Farrell. Nichols replied: [...] "He would be my first choice too." [...] "Site Y" [...] was the code name for the remote Los Alamos County, New Mexico facilities that housed the main group of researchers and was responsible for final assembly of the bombs.|$|E
