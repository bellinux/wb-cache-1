40|$|Today radio {{systems that}} are being {{implemented}} are digital. Every time we find more companies that choose {{to adapt to the}} current technology and the benefits are significant, solve problems and improve communications reliability. Digital radio systems are widespread and whether in business areas such as taxi drivers, firefighters, local police, etc. In this project, planning a system of private digital radio (PMR) is studied in a specific area of the Catalan Pyrenees to support emergency services and rescue of a ski resort, in particular to provide communications functions between employees center such as pisters, carriers and employees using snow-grooming machines. The objective of this TFC is a real need for a client company BAQUEIRA / BERET in the Pyrenees of the Vall d' Aran, which is dedicated to the tourism sector of the ski, also offers a variety of activities in a high mountain area of over 1, 922 hectares. The customer is given the plan and design a digital radio system {{to improve the quality of}} service on site. The system must be able to work on open network mode, and the new digital system must be able to coexist with the previous analog. The proposal made and developed in this project is a radio system brand called ICOM (IDAS) in VHF band. The main reasons for choosing this system were: · The network topology. This system uses a voting configuration that provides <b>automatic</b> <b>roaming,</b> it facilitates user mobility throughout the coverage area of the center without changing the channel manually. · Low installation costs. · A low level of equipment maintenance. The project is based on the ICOM products and have had the support and cooperation of the manufacturer. We have developed a reliable and economical solution that meets customer needs and the possibility of further extension. Once the planning and design field measurements were performed to assess the feasibility and reliability of the complete system...|$|E
2500|$|The companies' network sharing plans (allowing Orange {{customers}} to utilise T-Mobile's 2G signal and vice versa) were released to customers on 11 October 2010. The [...] "switch-on" [...] was rolled out utilising an opt-in page on each brand's website. However, the rollout did not initially include <b>automatic</b> network <b>roaming</b> mid-call or the two brands' 3G services.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Virtual {{laboratory}} is {{an application}} of virtual reality technology {{in the field of}} experimental teaching. Compared with the traditional on-site experiments, virtual laboratory performs experimental applications without limitation of space and time. In this paper, a web-based virtual laboratory of mechanical elements displays is designed integrating real experimental purposes and environment. Firstly, based on SolidWorks and 3 ds Max, a virtual laboratory model is created including mechanical elements or mechanisms, display cabinets and laboratory scenes. Then interaction designs by EON Studio are conducted to realize <b>automatic</b> path <b>roaming,</b> walking path, three-dimensional elements browsing and narrating. Finally, the virtual laboratory is published so that students can run the experiment by web...|$|R
50|$|Support for {{wireless}} networks {{is built}} into the network stack itself as a new set of APIs called Native Wifi, and does not emulate wired connections, {{as was the case with}} previous versions of Windows. This allows implementation of wireless-specific features such as larger frame sizes and optimized error recovery procedures. Native Wifi is exposed by Auto Configuration Module (ACM) which replaces Windows XP's Wireless Zero Configuration. The ACM is extensible, so developers can incorporate additional wireless functionality (such as <b>automatic</b> wireless <b>roaming)</b> and override the automatic configuration and connection logic without affecting the built-in framework. It is easier to find wireless networks in range and tell which networks are open and which are closed. Hidden wireless networks, which do not advertise their name (SSID) are better supported. Security for wireless networks is improved with improved support for newer wireless standards like 802.11i. EAP-TLS is the default authentication mode. Connections are made at the most secure connection level supported by the wireless access point. WPA2 can be used even in ad-hoc mode. Windows Vista also provides a Fast Roaming service that will allow users to move from one access point to another without loss of connectivity. Preauthentication with the new wireless access point can be used to retain the connectivity. Wireless networks are managed from either the Connect to a network dialog box within the GUI or the netsh wlan command from the shell. Settings for wireless networks can also be configured using Group policy.|$|R
