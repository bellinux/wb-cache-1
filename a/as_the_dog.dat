5|$|French Spaniels {{are also}} {{recognized}} by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale, and the United Kennel Club. The Kennel Club (UK) and the American Kennel Club do not recognize the French Spaniel, but is recognised by the North American Versatile Hunting Dog Association, and can be registered with US dog registries in order to record their registries and compete in associated dog shows, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dog</b> Registry of America, American Canine Association, and America's Pet Registry.|$|E
5|$|Tracheal {{collapse}} {{is caused}} by a weakening of the tracheal rings in the windpipe. It occurs when the rings that normally hold the shape of the windpipe collapse, closing the airway. The symptoms of a collapse include a honking cough that can sound similar to a goose honk, an intolerance to exercise, fainting spells and a cough that is worsened by hot weather, exercise and excitement. The tendency for episodes of tracheal collapse typically increases in frequency and severity <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> ages.|$|E
5|$|Blessed Lightning, a monk at the monastery, has {{a vision}} of Tintin, Snowy, Haddock, and Tharkey in danger. Tintin regains {{consciousness}} and, too weak to walk, gives Snowy a note to deliver. Snowy runs to the monastery, loses the message, but is recognised <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> from Blessed Lightning's vision. Tintin, Haddock and Tharkey regain consciousness in the monastery and are brought before the Grand Abbot. The Abbot tells Tintin to abandon his quest, but Blessed Lightning has another vision, through which Tintin learns that Chang is still alive inside a mountain cave at the Horn of the Yak—and that the Yeti is also there. Tintin and Haddock travel on to the Horn of the Yak.|$|E

5|$|In August, Judy met Leading Aircraftman Frank Williams, who adopted her {{and shared}} his daily handful of rice. In the camp Judy would {{intervene}} by distracting the guards {{when they were}} administering punishment. She was the only animal to have been officially registered as {{a prisoner of war}} during the Second World War, after Frank William's intervention to protect the dog from the guards, who would often threaten to shoot Judy <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> growled and barked at them. Williams managed to convince the camp Commandant, who was drunk on sake, to sign the registration papers with the promise of one of Judy's future puppies. Judy's official prisoner-of-war name was '81A Gloergoer Medan'.|$|E
5|$|In linking these shots together, Hepworth {{attempted}} {{to avoid the}} confusion of earlier multi-shot films such as Edwin S. Porter's The Great Train Robbery (1903). Three shots are used {{to set up the}} plot, that of the baby being stolen by a beggar woman. Nearly all of the following shots show Rover tracking down the child. When the dog returns home, the shots' settings are repeated in reverse <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> travels them; they are shown again in the original order, for a third time, when the dog brings the father. A fourth repetition is, rather radically for its time, spared by showing the kidnapper's return to her room followed by a shot of the reunited family.|$|E
5|$|Laevistrombus {{canarium}} (commonly known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> conch or by its better-known synonym, Strombus canarium) is {{a species}} of edible sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Strombidae (true conches). Known from illustrations in books dating from the late 17th century, L.canarium is an Indo-Pacific species occurring from India and Sri Lanka to Melanesia, Australia and southern Japan. The shell of adult individuals is coloured from light yellowish-brown to golden to grey. It has a characteristic inflated body whorl, a flared, thick outer lip and a shallow stromboid notch. The shell is valued as an ornament, {{and because it is}} heavy and compact it is also often used as a sinker for fishing nets.|$|E

25|$|It is {{not known}} whether this {{hybridization}} {{was the result of}} humans selecting for phenotypic traits from local wolf populations or the result of natural introgression <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> expanded across Eurasia.|$|E
25|$|Of the worms, the cestode Echinococcus granulosus, {{also known}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> tapeworm, infects {{the liver and}} forms {{characteristic}} hepatic hydatid cysts. The liver flukes Fasciola hepatica and Clonorchis sinensis live in the bile ducts and cause progressive hepatitis and liver fibrosis.|$|E

25|$|Like many working breeds, Border Collies can be motion-sensitive and may chase moving {{vehicles}} and bicycles, but this behaviour {{can be modified}} by training. Some of the more difficult behaviours require patience, as they are developmental and may disappear <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> matures.|$|E
25|$|Peltigera is a genus of {{approximately}} 91 species of foliose lichens {{in the family}} Peltigeraceae. Commonly known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> lichen, lichens of Peltigera are often terricolous (growing on soil), but can also occur on moss, trees, rocks, and many other substrates {{in many parts of}} the world.|$|E
25|$|Poodles {{are highly}} trainable dogs that {{typically}} excel in obedience training. A poodle {{will do well}} at many dog sports, including dog agility, flyball, dock diving, field tracking, and even schutzhund, and can follow owners on hiking trips or any trip involving swimming, as long <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> is accustomed to water and swimming.|$|E
50|$|On 1 June 1771, the few {{remaining}} women and children, <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> and <b>the</b> heavy luggage, were {{left behind by the}} party and a group of about 60 men advanced north, heading towards the Coppermine River.|$|R

25|$|In the cricket season, Wal {{plays for}} an unknown team as an all-rounder, {{although}} he is sometimes pictured as the wicket keeper. Cooch often plays cricket with Wal {{and so does the}} dog, usually fielding in the slips or in the covers (wherein the dog's alias of 'The Scarlet Manuka' sometimes comes into play, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dog</b> steals the cricket balls to 'rescue' them from persecution).|$|E
25|$|Due to the breed's stoic nature, {{injuries}} can {{go unnoticed}} {{for a time}} <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> will not give obvious signs of pain or distress like whining. For example, the first indication of a cut on the foot might be limping or favoring that foot {{a few days after}} the actual injury, so owners should be aware of their pets usual movement to spot irregularities. Excessive licking of a spot may also indicate a problem other than the skin conditions listed above.|$|E
25|$|Burrowing behaviour, {{in which}} an {{individual}} sinks itself entirely or partially into the substrate, is also frequent among strombid gastropods. The burrowing process itself, which involves distinct sequential movements and sometimes complex behaviours, is very characteristic of each species. Usually, large strombid gastropods such as the queen conch Eustrombus gigas and the spider conch Lambis lambis, do not bury themselves, except during their juvenile stage. On the other hand, smaller species such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> conch Strombus canarium and Strombus epidromis may bury themselves even after adulthood, though {{this is not an}} absolute rule.|$|E

25|$|There were {{subsequently}} other conflicts and incidents {{that were a}} part of the overall conflict, but are not usually seen {{in the context of the}} New Zealand Wars. The invasion of Parihaka in 1881 was certainly one of these. There was an incident in the 1890s that became known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dog</b> Tax War. Another was the arrest of Rua Kenana in 1916. It is even possible that events at Bastion Point in the 1970s should be considered as part of the same scenario.|$|E
25|$|Strict {{liability}}. States that impose {{strict liability}} make {{the owner of}} a dog liable for injuries caused by a dog, without further consideration of the facts. Strict liability laws may require that the person seeking damages for a dog bite prove that they were acting peacefully and lawfully {{at the time of the}} bite. The law may also recognize a limited range of defenses to liability, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> owner's successfully proving that the injured person was trespassing at the time of the injury or had engaged in conduct that provoked the attack.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> days {{of summer}} 1907 ensued, White City {{increased}} its emphases on water activities and its picnic grounds as weekly promotions not involving the mechanical rides appeared regularly in editions of the Indianapolis Star and the Indianapolis News. As the market begins to contract, White City survived the 1907 season while Wonderland almost succumbed to the competition. Only a reincorporation saved Wonderland for another season (after an infusion of new investments, and {{an expansion of the}} park's facilities, the park in eastern Indianapolis managed to stay in business until it was destroyed by fire in 1911).|$|E
