5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> La Masia is its marked Catalan {{national}} character—local {{talent in}} the service of a club with a strong, defining sense of the cultural make-up of Catalonia.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> Morris's preservationism was {{his desire}} to protect the natural world from the ravages of {{pollution}} and industrialism, causing some historians of the green movement to regard Morris as an important forerunner of modern environmentalism.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> {{the double}} burden in Africa {{is that there}} is class divide, meaning that most white families, {{including}} poor ones, employ Africans either as a live-in worker or a part-time worker. In addition, because of the urban house shortage, oftentimes relatives and friends are given room and board in exchange for unpaid work, alleviating work for some.|$|E
50|$|<b>Another</b> {{important}} <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> the Continental {{model is}} the disability pensions.|$|R
50|$|Theatre of Cameroon is also <b>another</b> {{important}} <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> local culture.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> {{important}} <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> this {{component of}} the dream plan is integrated lines and improved accessibility.|$|R
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> {{the hospice}} {{philosophy}} {{is that the}} care is patient-centered, to treat the whole patient. Many healthcare agencies in the US market themselves as patient-centered; for hospice, this patient-directed care is integral and interwoven throughout the care which is provided. Related Medicare regulations reflect this philosophy.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the Supreme Court {{majority}} {{upheld the}} validity of <b>another</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> the law as enacted by Congress: that the government could assume that a potentially expatriating act had been performed voluntarily and that any claim that a person had acted under duress {{was up to the}} person involved to establish by preponderance of evidence.|$|E
5|$|The {{notion of}} {{evolution}} equations is intimately tied in with <b>another</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> general relativistic physics. In Einstein's theory, {{it turns out}} to be impossible to find a general definition for a seemingly simple property such as a system's total mass (or energy). The main reason is that the gravitational field—like any physical field—must be ascribed a certain energy, but that it proves to be fundamentally impossible to localize that energy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Another</b> unique <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> war {{wind was}} stealth, {{there are four}} levels of stealth in the game.|$|R
50|$|Data-based {{assessment}} and comparison of learning methods, and ways children learn, is <b>another</b> big <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> modern elementary mathematics.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> {{important}} <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> MPG is that, the programme was monitored using a Programme Performance Monitoring System (PPMS)developed using {{open source}} technology.|$|R
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> {{the seventh}} {{generation}} {{was the beginning}} of direct competition between dedicated handheld gaming devices, and increasingly powerful PDA/cell phone devices such as the iPhone and iPod Touch, and the latter being aggressively marketed for gaming purposes. Simple games such as Tetris and Solitaire had existed for PDA devices since their introduction, but by 2009 PDAs and phones had grown sufficiently powerful to where complex graphical games could be implemented, with the advantage of distribution over wireless broadband.|$|E
5|$|The Vedic {{literature}} reveres various goddesses, but {{far less}} frequently than gods Indra, Agni and Soma. Yet, they are declared equivalent aspects of gender neutral Brahman, of Prajapati and Purusha. The goddesses often {{mentioned in the}} Vedic layers of text include the Ushas (dawn), Vac (speech, wisdom), Sarasvati (as river), Prithivi (earth), Nirriti (annihilator), Shraddha (faith, confidence). Goddesses such as Uma appear in the Upanishads as <b>another</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> Brahman and the knower of ultimate knowledge, such as in section 3 and 4 of the ancient Kena Upanishad.|$|E
5|$|The {{taking of}} black swans to Europe in the 18th and early 19th centuries brought the birds {{into contact with}} <b>another</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> European mythology: the {{attribution}} of sinister relationships between the devil and black-coloured animals, such as a black cat. Black swans {{were considered to be}} a witch's familiar and often chased away or killed by superstitious folk. This may explain why black swans have never established a sizeable presence as feral animals in Europe or North America.|$|E
50|$|Time {{constraints}} were <b>another</b> challenging <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> the project. The architects {{were given}} a year to design, document and construct this building.|$|R
50|$|Riddles: They are <b>another</b> {{important}} <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> Tulu oral traditions. These riddles {{are largely}} tongue twisting and mostly deal with kinship and agriculture.|$|R
25|$|<b>Another</b> unique <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> the - {{reaction}} {{is that there}} is only one reactant, which must be taken into account when calculating the reaction rate.|$|R
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> the kakapo's {{breeding}} {{system is}} that a female can alter the sex ratio of her offspring depending on her condition. A female who eats protein-rich foods produces more male offspring (males have 30%–40% more body weight than females). Females produce offspring biased towards the dispersive sex when competition for resources (such as food) is high and towards the non-dispersive sex when food is plentiful. A female kakapo will likely {{be able to produce}} eggs even when there are few resources, while a male kakapo will be more capable of perpetuating the species when there are plenty, by mating with several females. This supports the Trivers–Willard hypothesis. The relationship between clutch sex ratio and maternal diet has conservation implications, because a captive population maintained on a high quality diet will produce fewer females and therefore fewer individuals valuable to the recovery of the species.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> {{the portraits}} on the Makkotai coins {{are that they}} do not have {{identical}} head sizes and some facial features also vary from one coin to another, even though they all have the same written legend. Such an observation has been made of coins assigned to the Western Kshatrapas of Gujarat, which are thought to be another inspiration for the Chera coins. Scholars who analyzed the varying portraiture on the Kshatrapa coins have advanced several theories to explain the phenomenon: that the coins could be of different kings who chose to keep the name of an ancestor on their coins or the coins all belong to one king with portraits depicting him at his different ages. Based on such theories, the Chera coins could either belong to a series of rulers or to a single king called Cheraman Makkotai.|$|E
5|$|Two of the Jain {{references}} to this parable {{are found in}} Tattvarthaslokavatika of Vidyanandi (9th century) and it appears twice in the Syādvādamanjari of Ācārya Mallisena (13th century). According to Mallisena, whenever anyone takes a partial, unconditional view of the ultimate reality, and denies the possibility of <b>another</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> that reality, it is an instance of the above parable and a defective view. Mallisena goes further in his second reference to the above parable and states that all reality has infinite aspects and attributes, all assertions can only be relatively true. This does not mean scepticism or doubt is the right path to knowledge, according to Mallisena and other Jain scholars, but that any philosophical assertion is only conditionally, partially true. Any and all viewpoints, states Mallisena, that do not admit an exception are false views.|$|E
50|$|<b>Another</b> {{important}} <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> gameplay are the Terracon outrider pick-up systems (TOPS). TOPS are small, spherical, differently coloured pick-ups which {{orbit the}} player upon collection.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> {{important}} <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> rhyme {{in regard}} to Chinese language studies is the study or reconstruction of past varieties of Chinese, such as Middle Chinese.|$|R

5|$|Most major belligerents {{attempted}} {{to solve the}} problems of complexity and security involved in using large codebooks for cryptography by designing ciphering machines, the most well known being the German Enigma machine. Development of SIGINT (signals intelligence) and cryptanalysis enabled the countering process of decryption. Notable examples were the Allied decryption of Japanese naval codes and British Ultra, a pioneering method for decoding Enigma benefiting from information given to Britain by the Polish Cipher Bureau, which had been decoding early versions of Enigma before the war. <b>Another</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> military intelligence was the use of deception, which the Allies used to great effect, such as in operations Mincemeat and Bodyguard. Other technological and engineering feats achieved during, or as a result of, the war include the world's first programmable computers (Z3, Colossus, and ENIAC), guided missiles and modern rockets, the Manhattan Project's development of nuclear weapons, operations research and the development of artificial harbours and oil pipelines under the English Channel.|$|E
5|$|The {{viability}} of a game's platform can also affect both the localization and the release, {{as in the}} case of the PlayStation Portable-exclusive Final Fantasy Type-0, which would eventually come West as a high definition port for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and Seiken Densetsu 3, which was not localized due to undefined technical problems. The company has also recently started releasing Japanese voice tracks as downloadable content, {{as in the case}} of Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII and one of the titles it has published, the Access Games-developed Drakengard 3. <b>Another</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> Square Enix's policy concerning the Western release of games was to make games that appealed to both Western and Japanese audiences, but the worldwide success of the Japan-aimed Bravely Default caused them to rethink their strategy. Although English was originally the main language of Square Enix's foreign releases, including in non-English speaking countries, it seems some titles may debut without an English release in the future, such as the Chinese version of Dragon Quest X before an North American or European release has been confirmed. Final Fantasy XV, on the other hand, was the first Final Fantasy game to feature nine languages in a simultaneous launch.|$|E
5|$|The {{music was}} {{composed}} {{by a team}} consisting of Motoi Sakuraba, Yuzo Koshiro, Masafumi Takada, Noriyuki Iwadare, Takahiro Nishi, and Yasunori Mitsuda. Nishi acted as the music director, while orchestration was handled by Mitsuda and his studio assistant Natsumi Kameoka. Early in the game's development, Sakurai and Nishi were in discussions about what the style of Uprisings music would be, and which composers to hire for it. The composers were those who had contributed most prominently to Super Smash Bros. Brawl. The music involved both live orchestral music, synthesized tracks, and tracks that combined both musical styles. The air battle themes were created to match the dialogue and action on-screen, which was stated early on {{to be an important}} goal. <b>Another</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> the music, as noted by Koshiro, was that it should stand out while not interfering with dialogue. Sakuraba and Koshiro were brought in fairly early, and thus encountered difficulties with creating their music. Sakuraba recalled that he needed to rewrite the opening theme multiple times after his first demo clashed with the footage he saw due to his not knowing much about the game's world. Takada came on board when there was an ample amount of footage, but was shocked when he saw gameplay from the game's fifth chapter and tried to create suitable music within Sakurai's guidelines.|$|E

25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> the untyped lambda {{calculus}} {{is that it}} does not distinguish between different kinds of data.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> scuba {{configuration}} is how {{the primary}} cylinders are carried by the diver. The two basic arrangements are back mount and side mount.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> {{typology}} {{that has}} been studied in sign languages is their systems for cardinal numbers. Typologically significant differences have been found between sign languages.|$|E
50|$|<b>Another</b> useful <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> {{the nature}} of soft law is that it often {{can be used to}} {{evidence}} opinio juris on applying or interpreting a treaty.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> {{negative}} <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> {{trade barriers}} {{is that they}} result in a limited choice of products and would therefore force customers to pay higher prices and accept inferior quality.|$|R
50|$|Also, {{volunteering}} is <b>another</b> important <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> this festival. Annually, {{hundreds of}} youngsters {{from all over}} Romania gather at this event and enhance their experience by volunteering activities within the festival.|$|R
