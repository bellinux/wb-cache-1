40|$|SUMMARY: The rate <b>of</b> {{utilization}} <b>of</b> <b>amino-acids</b> {{injected into}} the allantoic cavity of virus-infected eggs was studied by paper-strip chromatography. Influenza virus brought about more rapid disappearance <b>of</b> <b>amino-acids</b> from the allantoic fluid than Mumps, Vaccinia or Lumpy Skin viruses or diphtheria and CZdrWam wlchii toxins. The utilization <b>of</b> <b>amino-acids</b> appears to be non-specific 81 fd not directly concerned with virus synthesis. Increasing attention is being paid to the chemical processes in virus multiplica-tion. In particular the bacteriophage has been studied (cf. Cohen, 1949). Spizizen (1943) described the effect <b>of</b> certain <b>amino-acids</b> on the release of bacteriophage from infected host cells suspended in simple media. Animal viruses have, however, received relatively little attention, though Bauer (1948) has reported an increase in xanthine oxidase in virus-infected chick embryos and mouse brain. Paper chromatography (Consden, Gordon & Martin, 1944) appeared to us to be well suited for studying the utilization <b>of</b> <b>amino-acids</b> and other substrate...|$|R

This showed that translational constraints are important enough to affect the global <b>amino-acid</b> composition <b>of</b> proteins.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Sorption of an acidic, amphoteric, sulphur {{containing}} {{and basic}} 7 -amino-acid (glutamic acid, glycine, methionine and lysine) by copper mont-morillonite was studied by chemical and X-ray methods. With glutamic acid complex formation occurs only in solution but increasing basicity <b>of</b> the <b>amino-acid</b> favours complex {{formation in the}} clay interlayers. The association <b>of</b> <b>amino-acids</b> with montmorillonite has been studied sporadically over the last 12 years, most recently by Cloos et aI. (1966). Summarizing pre-vious work Cloos et al. concluded that although there are considerable differences between the results and interpretations of various investigators, it is generally agreed that low pH values favour sorption <b>of</b> <b>amino-acids</b> by acid and neutral montmoril-lonite. Accordingly they carried out experiments under more or less acid conditions, using a hydrochloride form <b>of</b> the <b>amino-acid</b> with Ca and Na montmorillonite and neutral amino-acids with hydrogen montmoriUonite. Under acid conditions amino-acids occur as cations and as neutrality is approached they tend towards the zwitterion form...|$|R

40|$|INVESTIGATIONS of {{intestinal}} transport <b>of</b> <b>amino-acids</b> in the locust 1, 2 and silkworm 3, 4 {{have shown}} {{no evidence for}} active accumulation in a transport from the insect gut <b>of</b> <b>amino-acids.</b> When glycine- 2 - 14 C was administered in vivo to fifth instar larvae of the silkworm, 96 per cent of the radioactivity was incorporated into various tissues within 1 h whereas in vitro only 19 per cent of the activity was transported by the mid-gut of silkworm (unpublished work). These results suggested that continued absorption of glycine by the intestine could be aided by a facilitated diffusion mechanism in which amino-acids are rapidly removed {{from the site of}} absorption either by accumulation into other tissues or by degradation. Although the insect fat body has been assigned both accumulatory and dissimilatory roles 5, the mechanism <b>of</b> accumulation <b>of</b> <b>amino-acids</b> has not been investigated. Our present experiments show that the silkworm fat body possesses an efficient mechanism for accumulating glycine and that both the accumulation and the release of glycine are metabolically controlled...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the ability of intact Zea mays. L. roots to regulate the amount <b>of</b> free <b>amino-acids</b> present in the rhizosphere. Using metabolic inhibitors it was demonstrated that the release <b>of</b> <b>amino-acids</b> from the root occurred by passive diffusion, whilst free amino-acids outside the root could be re-captured by an active transport mechanism. The influx <b>of</b> <b>amino-acids</b> into the root was shown to be relatively independent of spatial location along the root and was little affected by the presence of other organic compounds in solution. It was deduced from root concentration gradients that the main site <b>of</b> <b>amino-acid</b> exudation was at root tips. Amino-acid uptake by the root was shown to be independent of both inorganic-N concentration and the presence of other organic solutes in solution. A computer simulation model was constructed to assess the contribution of organic-N uptake (acidic, basic and neutral amino-acids) to the plant's N budget, in comparison to the inorganic solutes NO 3 and NH 4. Simulations of N uptake from a 0. 5 mm radius rhizosphere indicated that when inorganic-N concentrations in soil were limiting (≤ 0. 1 μmoles cm- 3 soil), the uptake of amino-N accounted for up to 90 % the total N taken up by the roots. In situations where fertilizer inputs are high, and levels of organic matter in soil are low, the contribution of amino-N might still be expected to form < 30 % of the total N taken up by the root system. It was concluded that the uptake <b>of</b> <b>amino-acids</b> from the rhizosphere may be important in both N nutrition and in the minimization of root C and N losses to the soil. Consequently this may be important in governing the size of the rhizosphere microbial population. © 1994 Kluwer Academic Publishers...|$|R

40|$|A {{statistical}} method for quantifying the relatedness among proteins {{was used to}} perform 2926 paired comparisons <b>of</b> <b>amino-acid</b> composition among 77 contractile and membrane-associated proteins from diverse species and sources. Relatedness <b>of</b> <b>amino-acid</b> compositions correlates with homology <b>of</b> <b>amino-acid</b> sequence. A high degree of relatedness was detected among K+-dependent membrane ATPase of Streptococcus faecalis, coupling factors F 1 and CF 1 from mitochondria and chloroplasts, outer fiber protein of cilia, ciliary dynein, tubulin, various actins, and myosin subfragment S- 1. Heavy meromyosin and tropomyosin were {{related to each other}} but not to the first group of proteins. Differences in the degree of methylation may account for some differences in physiological function. Because of their diverse sources, the high degree of relatedness among these proteins is more compatible with evolution from common ancestral genes than with convergent evolution. Squid axon filarin, molluscan paramyosin, and bacterial flagellins appear to be unrelated either to each other or to any of the other proteins studied.

40|$|Protein {{function}} prediction from amino-acid sequences {{is one of}} {{the major}} tasks in genome informatics. To predict protein functions <b>of</b> a given <b>amino-acid</b> sequence, we can use similarities among functions and structural features <b>of</b> <b>amino-acid</b> sequences, i. e., motif and homology. Di culties of the previous function prediction methods are caused by the facts that few already known motif have been found and that proteins of similar sequence may not have similar functions. A main objective of our research is to facilitate to nd functional features of proteins using machine learning techniques. Our hypothesis for the protein function prediction is that a protein function arises from physical structures of the protein. Since the structures of proteins are built with physico-chemical interactions among amino-acids, there might exist some features <b>of</b> <b>amino-acid</b> sequences according to the physicochemical interactions. We call these features `functional features'. We know that there exists electric interactions among alpha-helices of bacteriorhodopsin from its tertiary structure of the protein and localization <b>of</b> polar <b>amino-acids</b> in the structure.

40|$|Introduction It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that peptides can adopt only some conformations due to steric hindrances between main chain and side chain atoms. Subsequently, energy calculation have allowed to obtain plots of preferred regions for  and  in a few residues.

The present work analizes the spatial conformation of complex chains <b>of</b> <b>amino-acids,</b> and assesses the correspondence of the  and  angles <b>of</b> each <b>amino-acid</b> in a chain with the conformational energy maps which have been determined on a theoretical basis.
