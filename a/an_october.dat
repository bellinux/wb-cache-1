5|$|In July 2010, RA {{organizers}} {{announced that}} the film festival would move from October 2010 to April 2011 because of funding shortfalls. One news source reported that RA organizers had intended to hold <b>an</b> <b>October</b> film festival, but a community fundraiser brought in only $5,000—far less than hoped, and not enough to allow <b>an</b> <b>October</b> festival to occur. The move to April was prompted, in part, by the hope that a $75,000 D.C. government grant would allow the festival to occur. However, on March 8, 2011, RA officials cancelled the April event because of continuing heavy debt and because several grants had not been awarded to the organization. Festival organizers scheduled the 20th Reel Affirmations LGBTQ film festival for October 13–22, 2011.|$|E
