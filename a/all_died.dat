5|$|Kallisto, the {{granddaughter of}} the Athenian orator Lykourgos was an epikleros after {{the deaths of}} her grandfather, {{paternal}} uncles Habron and Lykourgos, and father Lykophron. She was married and had a son, whom her father adopted and renamed Lykophron. After her father's adoption of her son, Kallisto's husband, son and father <b>all</b> <b>died,</b> leaving her father's household in danger of extinction. Her second marriage, however, produced a son who continued the household. Demosthenes' mother Cleoboule was the epikleros of Gylon.|$|E
5|$|Later in life, Reynolds married Montague Main {{and moved}} to Barnet in North London, having three {{children}} who <b>all</b> <b>died</b> in childhood. There she became a road safety officer, a role rarely performed by women in London during the 1930s and 1940s. By 1948, her husband also died and she focused her work on accident prevention. Reynolds died in 1955, aged 77, with local papers covering her death.|$|E
5|$|Sejanus began {{a series}} of purge trials of Senators and wealthy equestrians in the city of Rome, {{removing}} those capable of opposing his power as well as extending the imperial (and his own) treasury.

5|$|The sponge {{benefits}} {{from the fact that}} living on the scallop prevents it from being buried in sediment. In the wild it has been found that the scallops and their encrusting sponges both grow to a larger size in areas of high turbidity. A laboratory study showed that, in conditions where the sediment was frequently stirred up, sponges on empty scallop shells <b>all</b> <b>died</b> while those on living shells flourished. However, another study showed that growth rates in scallops heavily encrusted by sponges were significantly lower than in unencumbered ones.|$|E
5|$|Upon the childless {{death of}} Roger in 1155, the Earldom of Hereford fell into {{abeyance}} until 1199 when King John bestowed the title on Henry de Bohun, Sibyl's grandson through her eldest daughter, Margaret. As her sons <b>all</b> <b>died</b> without legitimate offspring, Sibyl's three daughters became co-heirs to the Brecon honour, with Bertha, the second daughter, passing Sibyl's inheritance on (through marriage) to the de Braoses, thereby making them {{one of the}} most powerful families in the Welsh Marches.|$|E
5|$|Although Kirchner {{was known}} to have health problems, his death was unexpected, and had {{a great impact on}} the {{politics}} of Argentina. Kirchner died at an early age, while still being a highly influential figure in politics, despite not being president at the time. Presidents Manuel Quintana, Roque Sáenz Peña and Roberto María Ortiz died in office, but none of them had a political clout comparable to that of Kirchner. President Juan Perón had a similar power and died in office, but his death was not unexpected, as he had already reached the life expectancy of the time. Other figures of the history of Argentina who achieved great political clout, such as José de San Martín, Juan Manuel de Rosas, Julio Argentino Roca, Carlos Pellegrini and Hipólito Yrigoyen, <b>all</b> <b>died</b> when they were already retired from politics, or even abroad.|$|E

5|$|Besides Madison, {{four other}} {{governors}} have died while in office—John Breathitt, James Clark, John L. Helm, and William Goebel. <b>All</b> <b>died</b> {{of natural causes}} except Goebel, who is the only governor of any U.S. state to have been assassinated. Goebel lost the contentious 1899 gubernatorial election to William S. Taylor, but challenged the results. While the General Assembly was considering the challenge, Goebel was shot. Days later, the General Assembly decided in favor of Goebel, ousting Taylor from office and making Goebel governor. Goebel was sworn in on his sick bed and died two days later. His lieutenant governor, J. C. W. Beckham, succeeded him.|$|E
5|$|Harbour {{porpoises}} {{have historically}} been kept in captivity, {{under the assumption that}} they would fare better than their dolphin counterparts due to their shallow-water habitats. Of the 150 harbour porpoises kept worldwide, nearly 100 were kept in Denmark. Nearly half of these died of diseases caught before they were captured, or damage sustained during capture and transit. Almost <b>all</b> <b>died</b> within 14 months. Breeding success has always been poor with porpoises, and there are only six recorded births (of a harbour porpoise and five finless porpoises). Lack of births in captivity is mainly due {{the fact that there were}} few breeding attempts, many were actually kept in isolation and those who were not were often not mature.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Victoria's brother, Ernest Louis, {{died and}} soon {{afterwards}} her widowed sister-in-law, nephew, granddaughter {{and two of}} her great-grandchildren <b>all</b> <b>died</b> in an air crash at Ostend. Victoria's granddaughter, Princess Cecilie of Greece and Denmark, had married Victoria's nephew (Ernest Louis's son), George Donatus of Hesse. They and their two young sons, Louis and Alexander, were all killed. Cecilie was pregnant {{at the time and}} the stillborn child was found among the wreckage. Cecilie's youngest child, Johanna, who was not on the plane, was adopted by her uncle Prince Louis of Hesse and by Rhine but the little girl only survived her parents and older brothers by eighteen months, dying in 1939 of meningitis.|$|E

5|$|Kafka's parents {{probably}} spoke a German {{influenced by}} Yiddish that was sometimes pejoratively called Mauscheldeutsch, but, as the German language {{was considered the}} vehicle of social mobility, they probably encouraged their children to speak High German. Hermann and Julie had six children, of whom Franz was the eldest. Franz's two brothers, Georg and Heinrich, died in infancy before Franz was seven; his three sisters were Gabriele ("Ellie") (1889–1944), Valerie ("Valli") (1890–1942) and Ottilie ("Ottla") (1892–1943). They <b>all</b> <b>died</b> during the Holocaust of World War II. Valli was deported to the Łódź Ghetto in Poland in 1942, {{but that is the}} last documentation of her.

5|$|On 10 January 1917, {{manned by}} an almost entirely new crew, Aurora arrived at Cape Evans {{and picked up}} the seven {{survivors}} of the Ross Sea shore party; Mackintosh, Victor Hayward and Arnold Spencer-Smith had <b>all</b> <b>died.</b> This was the vessel's final visit to Antarctic waters; on return to New Zealand it was sold by Shackleton to a coal carrier. Aurora left Newcastle, New South Wales, on 20 June 1917 bound for Chile, and was never seen again, officially posted as missing by Lloyd's of London on 2 January 1918. Among those lost was James Paton, who had acted as the ship's boatswain throughout the Ross Sea Party expedition and the drift, and on the subsequent relief mission. In 1920 King George V appointed Joseph Stenhouse an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), in acknowledgement of his service aboard Aurora.|$|E

5|$|Victoria was the {{daughter}} of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, the fourth son of King George III. Both the Duke of Kent and King George III died in 1820, and Victoria was raised under close supervision by her German-born mother, Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. She inherited the throne at the age of 18, after her father's three elder brothers had <b>all</b> <b>died,</b> leaving no surviving legitimate children. The United Kingdom was already an established constitutional monarchy, in which the sovereign held relatively little direct political power. Privately, Victoria attempted to influence government policy and ministerial appointments; publicly, she became a national icon who was identified with strict standards of personal morality.|$|E
5|$|Shelley, {{who visited}} the toddler Allegra while she was being boarded with a family chosen by Byron, objected to the child's living {{arrangements}} over the years, though he had initially approved of Clairmont's plan to relinquish her to her father. During the summer of 1819, Allegra stayed with four different families and was abandoned by her nursemaid. Byron sent her to stay for long periods with his friend, British consul Richard Belgrave Hoppner, but Hoppner's wife didn't like Allegra and sent her to stay with three other families in as many months. Though he'd originally agreed to permit Clairmont to visit their daughter, Byron reneged on the agreement. Shelley often tried to persuade Byron to let Clairmont see her daughter and they thought of ways to regain custody of her. Clairmont was alarmed by reports in 1820 that her daughter had suffered a malarial-type fever and that Byron had moved her to warm Ravenna {{at the height of}} the summer. Clairmont wrote that Allegra must be moved to a more healthy climate if she was to survive and pleaded with Byron to send their daughter to her in Bagni di Lucca, a town with a cool mountain climate. However, Byron didn't want to send Allegra back to be raised in the Shelley household, where he was sure she'd grow ill from eating a vegetarian diet and would be taught atheism. He pointed out that all of the other children in the Shelley household had died: the Shelleys' first three children had <b>all</b> <b>died</b> young and their fourth child, Elena Adelaide Shelley, died in a foster home in 1820 at age seventeen months.|$|E
5|$|The Sound Four do {{not become}} a {{prominent}} {{part of the story}} until sent by their leader to escort Sasuke Uchiha to him. Even with Kimimaro joining the group to ensure Sasuke's passage to Orochimaru, the Sound Five <b>all</b> <b>died</b> in the process: Jirobo and Kidomaru killed in their respective fights against Chōji Akimichi and Neji Hyūga, Sakon and Ukon taken out by Kankuro as they nearly kill Kiba Inuzuka, Tayuya indirectly killed by Temari as she had the upper hand on Shikamaru Nara, and Kimimaro succumbed to his unknown illness {{in the midst of his}} battle against Gaara and Rock Lee. During the Fourth Shinobi World War, Kimimaro is reanimated by Kabuto Yakushi as a pawn to battle against the Allied Shinobi Forces. In the anime adaptation, unaware that Kabuto brought them back instead of Orochimaru, the Sound Four were also reanimated and were allowed to act on their impulse for revenge against the members of the Sasuke Retrieval group before being defeated. It was also at the time of the war's climax that Kabuto reveals that he assimilated the Sound Five's DNA to access their abilities.|$|E
