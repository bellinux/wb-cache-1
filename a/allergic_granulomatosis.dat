50|$|Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA; {{also known}} as Churg-Strauss {{syndrome}} CSS or <b>allergic</b> <b>granulomatosis)</b> is an extremely rare autoimmune condition that causes inflammation of small and medium-sized blood vessels (vasculitis) in persons {{with a history of}} airway allergic hypersensitivity (atopy).|$|E
40|$|The Churg-strauss {{syndrome}} (CSS), {{also referred}} to as <b>allergic</b> angiitis and <b>granulomatosis</b> is characterized by asthma, peripheral and tissue eosinophilia, extravascular granuloma formation, and vasculitis of multiple organ systems. It is an uncommon disease with an estimated annual incidence of 1 - 3 per million. Here, we report a case of CSS with glomerulocentric granulomatous reaction with interstitial eosinophils and involvement of retinal vessels...|$|R
40|$|S TR A C T Eosinophilic lung {{diseases}} are {{a diverse group}} of pulmonary disorders associated with peripheral or tissue eosinophilia. They are classified as eosinophilic lung diseases of unknown cause (simple pulmonary eosinophilia [SPE], acute eosinophilic pneumonia [AEP], chronic eosinophilic pneumonia [CEP], idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome [IHS]), eosinophilic lung diseases of known cause (allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis [ABPA], bronchocentric granulomatosis [BG], parasitic infections, drug reactions), and eosinophilic vasculitis (<b>allergic</b> angiitis, <b>granulomatosis</b> [Churg-Strauss syndrome]). The percentages of eosinophils in peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid are essential parts of the evaluation. Chest computed tomography (CT) demonstrates a more characteristic pattern and distribution of parenchymal opacities than conventional chest radiography. At CT, SPE and IHS are characterized by single or multiple nodules with a surrounding ground-glass-opacity halo, AEP mimics radiologically hydrostatic pulmonary edema, and CEP is characterized by nonsegmental airspace consolidations wit...|$|R
40|$|Churg-Strauss {{syndrome}} (CSS) {{is a rare}} granulomatous necrotizing {{small vessel}} vasculitis characterized {{by the presence of}} asthma, sinusitis, and hypereosinophilia. The cause of this <b>allergic</b> angiitis and <b>granulomatosis</b> is unknown. Other common manifestations are pulmonary infiltrates, skin, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular involvement. No data have been reported regarding the role of immune complexes or cell mediated mechanisms in this disease, although autoimmunity is evident with the presence hypergammaglobulinemia, increased levels of IgE and Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (positive in 40 %). We report the case of a 27 -year-old lady presenting with painful swelling of predominantly lower limbs with extensive vesicles and ecchymotic patches and fever shortly after stopping systemic steroids taken for a prolonged duration (2002 [...] 2010). The aim of this case report is to point to the possibility of CSS in patients presenting with extensive skin lesions masquerading as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome/Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis Syndrome (SJS/TENS) ...|$|R
40|$|Churg Strauss {{syndrome}} (CSS) (<b>allergic</b> <b>granulomatosis</b> and angiitis) is {{a systemic}} disorder characterized by asthma, transient pulmonaiy infiltrates, hypereosinophilia and a systemic vasculitis 1 - 3.

40|$|<b>Allergic</b> <b>granulomatosis</b> and {{angiitis}} (Churg-Strauss syndrome) {{is characterized}} by a systemic vasculitis in the context of bronchial asthma and eosinophilia. Pathologically, there is a necrotizing vasculitis of small arteries and veins with extravascular granulomas, infiltration of vessels and perivascular tissue with eosinophilia. Pulmonary, peripheral nervous system, cardiovascular and cutaneous manifestations are most frequently encountered. Renal failure and high blood pressure are more rare. These features, within the setting of bronchial asthma and eosinophilia, differentiate Churg-Strauss syndrome from polyarteritis nodosa. Steroid associated to cyclophosphamide have considerably improved the prognosis and risk of relapse...|$|E
40|$|The ChurgStrauss {{syndrome}} (CSS) {{is defined}} as a systemic necrotizing vasculitis affecting small-to-medium-sized vessels; CSS is also characterized by tissue eosinophilia, eosinophilic extravascular granulomas, peripheral eosino-philia, asthma, allergic rhinitis and sinusitis. In 1951, Churg and Strauss were the first to correlate these pathological and clinical findings, and defined this syndrome as <b>allergic</b> <b>granulomatosis</b> and angiitis [1]. Churg’s and Strauss’s definition of granulomatosis was based on the pathological observation of allergic granulomas in different organs. The allergic or eosinophilic granuloma, however, is not pathognomonic of CSS, since it can also be found in other systemic vasculitides, con-nective tissue disorders, lymphoproliferative diseases, subacute bacterial endocarditis, chronic hepatitis an...|$|E
40|$|Churg-Strauss {{syndrome}} (CSS) or <b>allergic</b> <b>granulomatosis</b> angiitis {{is a rare}} primary vasculitic disease. CSS can {{be diagnosed}} {{by the presence of}} any four or more of the six criteria, which include asthma, eosinophilia greater than 10 %, paranasal sinusitis, pulmonary infiltration, histological proof of vasculitis and mono- or poly-neuropathy. We report here on a 45 -year-old male who developed erythematous macules, papules and hemorrhagic vesicles on both right extremities along with a tingling sensation and sacral pain. He has been suffering from recurrent allergic rhinitis and bronchial asthma for 6 months. The laboratory findings showed severe eosinophilia (22. 3 %), hyper-IgE and positivity for p-ANCA. On the histological examination of the hemorrhagic vesicle on the right lower leg, leukocytoclsatic vasulitis and many neutrophils and eosinophils around the cutaneous vessels were observed in the dermis...|$|E
40|$|The tetrad of {{bronchial}} asthma, severe sinusitis, nasal polyp, eosinophilia, {{and systemic}} vasculitis {{is the main}} feature of <b>allergic</b> <b>granulomatosis</b> and angitis (Churg- Strauss Syndrome). This vasculitis is usually seen idiopathic in patients {{with a long history}} of asthma; oral steroids using steroid inhalers, vaccination and desensitization might be triggering factors. Drugs such as leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAS), penicillin, sulphonamides, anticonvulsants and thiazides have also been implicated. By presenting the cases in this article, the authors suggest that some cases of CSS may be partially or totally suppressed by corticosteroid therapy of asthma for long periods and replacing oral steroid by inhaler will reveal a pathologic condition of CSS, called frustes CSS forms. We report three subjects with asthma who had been receiving previously multiple corticosteroid courses for control, but when systemic corticosteroids were discontinued or switched over to steroid inhaler, the patients developed a similar syndrome...|$|E
40|$|DNA {{diagnostics}} {{are useful}} but are hampered by difficult ethical issues. Moreover, it cannot provide enough {{information on the}} environmental factors that are important for pathogenesis of certain diseases. However, {{this is not a}} problem for RNA diagnostics, which evaluate the expression of the gene in question. We here report a novel RNA diagnostics tool that can be employed with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). To establish this tool, we identified 290 genes that are highly expressed in normal PBMCs but not in TIG- 1, a normal human fibroblast cell. These genes were entitled PREP after predomi-nantly expressed in PBMC and included 50 uncharacterized genes. We then conducted PREP gene-focused microarray analysis on PBMCs from seven cases of Churg–Strauss syndrome (CSS), which is a small-vessel necrotizing vasculitis. We found that PREP 135 (coactosin-like protein), PREP 77 (prosaposin), PREP 191 (cathepsin D), PREP 234 (c-fgr), and PREP 136 (lysozyme) were very highly up-regulated in all seven CSS patients. Another 28 genes were also up-regulated, albeit more moderately, and three were down-regulated in all CSS patients. The nature of these up- and down-regulated genes suggest that the immune systems of the patients are activated in response to invading microorganisms. These observations indicate that focused microarray analysis of PBMCs may be a practical, useful, and low-cost bedside diag-nostics tool. focused microarray; RNA diagnosis; PMBC; <b>allergic</b> <b>granulomatosis</b> angiitis; Churg–Strauss syndrome 1...|$|E
