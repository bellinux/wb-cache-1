Jeremiah protested {{that he could not}} speak, for he was a child, but God told him not to fear, for he would go wherever God would send him, say whatever God would command him to say, and God would be with him to deliver him. Then God touched Jeremiah's mouth and said that God had put words in his mouth and set him over the nations to root out and to pull down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant. God asked Jeremiah what he saw, he replied that he saw the rod of an <b>almond</b> <b>tree,</b> and God said that he had seen well, for God watches over God's word to perform it.|$|E
2500|$|This legend aims to {{describe}} {{ways in which}} humanity can and will regain its freedom. [...] The legend is about an <b>almond</b> <b>tree,</b> that {{is described as a}} [...] "priest-tree". This tree guards the Maya traditions and recounts the passing of the years. The tree divides its soul between the four paths that one encounters before the underworld known as Xibalbá. These four paths are marked by different colors: green, red, white and black. Each portion of the soul embarks on a different path on which they each face temptations. The black road, which in Mayan tradition leads to the underworld, trades part of its soul with the merchant of Priceless Jewels, who then uses in exchange for the most beautiful slave. The slave escapes, and the character of the tree, searching for the missing part of his soul eventually finds her. The Inquisition then intervenes and sentences to kill them. In the end, the beautiful slave escapes the night via the magic of a boat tattooed on her arm by the tree. On the morning of the execution the only thing the guards find in the prison cell is an old <b>almond</b> <b>tree.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The 54 {{terrestrial}} mammals {{found in}} Zanzibar include 23 species of bats (popo in Swahili).

The Zanzibar red colobus has been known to consume charcoal, possibly a learned behaviour, after eating the leaves of the Indian <b>almond</b> <b>tree</b> and Mangifera indica mango.

60|$|He felt {{a strange}} and vivid value in all the earth around him, in the grass under his feet; he felt the love of life in all living things.

60|$|Honore Mirabel was a labouring lad, under age, near Marseilles. His {{story was}} that, in May (year not given), about eleven at night, {{he was lying}} under an <b>almond</b> <b>tree,</b> near the farm of a lady named Gay. In the {{moonlight}} he saw a man at an upper window of a building distant five or six paces, the house belonged to a Madame Placasse. Mirabel asked the person {{what he was doing}} there; got no answer, entered, and could see nobody. Rather alarmed he went to a well, drew some water, drank, and then heard a weak voice, bidding him dig there for treasure, and asking that masses might be said for the soul of the informant.

60|$|At last {{there came}} a post which brought me, not a sermon from Miss Fenne, nor gossip from Pollie, but {{a message from the}} Islands of the Blest. All that evening and night it lay unopened under my pillow. I was saving it up. And never have I passed hours so studious yet so barren of result. It was the end of February. A sudden burst of light and {{sunshine}} had fallen on the world. There were green shining grass and new-fallen lambs in the meadows, and the <b>almond</b> <b>tree</b> beyond my window was in full, leafless bloom. As for the larks, they were singing of Fanny. The next morning early, about seven o'clock, her letter folded up in its small envelope in the bosom of my cloak, I was {{out of the house and}} making my way to the woods. It was the clear air of daybreak and only the large stars shook faint and silvery in the brightening sky.|$|E
60|$|Away to {{the right}} the flat river-marshes with the thick dead reeds met the flat and shining sea, river and sea were one water, the waves rippled tiny and soft-foot into the stream.

How {{beautiful}} they were, their pure, silvery pink gleaming so nobly, like a transfiguration, tall and perfect in that strange cradled river-bed parallel with the sea. <b>Almond</b> <b>trees</b> were in flower beneath grey Orosei, <b>almond</b> <b>trees</b> came near the road, and {{we could see the}} hot eyes of the individual blossoms, <b>almond</b> <b>trees</b> stood on the upward slope before us. And they had flowered in such noble beauty there, in that trough where the sun fell magnificent and the sea-glare whitened all the air as with a sort of God-presence, they gleamed in their incandescent sky-rosiness. One could hardly see their iron trunks, in this weird valley.|$|R
