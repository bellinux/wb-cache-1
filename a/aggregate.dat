40|$|In {{laboratory}} experiments we observe dust <b>aggregates</b> from 100 μ m to 1 cm in size composed of micrometer sized grains levitating over a hot surface. Depending on the dust sample <b>aggregates</b> start to levitate at {{a temperature of}} 400 K. Levitation of dust <b>aggregates</b> is restricted to a pressure range between 1 [...] 40 mbar. The levitating {{is caused by a}} Knudsen compressor effect. Based on thermal transpiration through the dust <b>aggregates</b> the pressure increases between surface and <b>aggregates.</b> Dust <b>aggregates</b> are typically balanced 100 μ m over the surface. On a slightly concave surface individual <b>aggregates</b> are trapped at the center. Ensembles of <b>aggregates</b> are confined in a 2 D plane. <b>Aggregates</b> are subject to systematic and random translational and rotational motion.

40|$|In {{laboratory}} experiments, {{we studied}} collisions of ensembles of compact (filling factor 0. 33) millimeter dust <b>aggregates</b> composed of micrometer quartz grains. We used cylindrical <b>aggregates,</b> triangular <b>aggregates,</b> square <b>aggregates,</b> and rectangular <b>aggregates.</b> Ensembles of equal size <b>aggregates</b> {{as well as}} ensembles with embedded larger <b>aggregates</b> were studied. The typical collision velocities are 10 - 20 mm s^- 1. High spatial and temporal resolution imaging unambiguously shows that individual collisions lead to sticking with a high probability of 20 percent. This leads to connected clusters of <b>aggregates.</b> The contact areas between two <b>aggregates</b> increase with collision velocity. However, this cluster growth is only temporary, as subsequent collisions of <b>aggregates</b> and clusters eventually lead to the detachment of all <b>aggregates</b> from a cluster. The contacts are very fragile as <b>aggregates</b> cannot be compressed further or fragment under our experimental conditions to enhance the contact stability. Therefore, {{the evolution of the}} ensemble always leads back to a distribution of individual <b>aggregates</b> of initial size. This supports and extends earlier experiments showing that a bouncing barrier in planetesimal formation would be robust against shape and size variations...|$|R

40|$|Soil <b>aggregates</b> between 2 and 5 mm from 35 - and 45 -year-old unreclaimed post-mining sites near Sokolov (Czech Republic) {{were divided}} into two groups: spherical and prismatic. X-ray {{tomography}} indicated that prismatic <b>aggregates</b> consisted of fragments of claystone bonded together by amorphous clay and roots while spherical <b>aggregates</b> consisted of a clay matrix and organic fragments of various sizes. Prismatic <b>aggregates</b> were presumed to be formed by plant roots and physical processes during weathering of Tertiary mudstone, while earthworms were presumed to contribute to the formation of spherical <b>aggregates.</b> The effects of drying and rewetting and glucose addition on microbial respiration, microbial biomass, and counts of bacteria in these <b>aggregates</b> were determined. Spherical <b>aggregates</b> contained a greater percentage of C and N and a higher C-to-N ratio than prismatic ones. The C content of the particulate organic matter was also higher in the spherical than in the prismatic <b>aggregates.</b> Although spherical <b>aggregates</b> had a higher microbial respiration and biomass, the growth of microbial biomass in spherical <b>aggregates</b> was negatively correlated with initial microbial biomass, indicating competition between bacteria. Specific respiration was negatively correlated with microbial biomass. Direct counts of bacteria were higher in spherical than in prismatic <b>aggregates.</b> Bacterial numbers were more stable in the center than in the surface layers of the <b>aggregates.</b> Transmission electron microscopy indicated that bacteria often occurred as individual cells in prismatic <b>aggregates</b> but as small clusters of cells in spherical <b>aggregates.</b> Ratios of colony forming units (cultivatable bacteria) to direct counts were higher in spherical than in prismatic <b>aggregates.</b> Spherical <b>aggregates</b> also contained faster growing bacteria...|$|R
30|$|The {{difference}} in the percent content of oven–dried <b>aggregates</b> in different soil samples may not be significant, but the contents of water–stable <b>aggregates</b> vary a lot. Therefore, the proportion of water–stable <b>aggregates</b> at each size range can better reflect the quality of soil <b>aggregates.</b> The relationships between the mass percent content of water–stable <b>aggregates</b> in different size range and the drying–wetting cycles are illustrated in Fig. 5 b. With the increase of drying–wetting cycles, {{the percentage of the}} water–stable <b>aggregates</b> in the size range of 5 – 10  mm decreases obviously and the initial two cycles has the most violent effect on the disintegration of <b>aggregates,</b> which is consistent with the result by Denef et al. (2001 a,b). After 10 times cycles, the <b>aggregates</b> in the size range of 5 – 10  mm remain almost no residue. Due to the supplement from the disintegration of the <b>aggregates</b> (5 – 10  mm) in the first cycle, the proportion of the <b>aggregates</b> (2 – 5  mm) increases slightly. After that period, the proportion of the <b>aggregates</b> (2 – 5  mm) decreases and remains almost no residue eventually. For the <b>aggregates</b> in the diameter of 1 – 2  mm, drying–wetting cycles first increase the proportion slightly; after this maximum, further drying–wetting cycles decrease the proportion. On the whole, with the further drying–wetting cycles, the proportion of the <b>aggregates</b> (1 – 2  mm) shows almostly no change. We speculate that there are two possibilities: one is that the supplement from slaking of greater <b>aggregates</b> and the slaking of <b>aggregates</b> with the size of 1 – 2  mm reach the equilibrium state; another is the coexistence of breakdown of larger water–stable <b>aggregates</b> and reunion of smaller water–stable <b>aggregates</b> (Degens and Sparling, 1995). Unfortunately, the results of this research are unable to distinguish.|$|R

40|$|The {{aggregation}} of {{mixtures of}} two dissimilar viruses, poliovirus I (Mahoney) and reovirus III (Dearing), {{was followed by}} electron microscopy under conditions known to induce either aggregation or dispersion of each virus separately. Neither virus <b>aggregated</b> at pH 7 in an appropriate buffer, and no mixed <b>aggregates</b> were formed. Under conditions of lowered ionic strength (by dilution into distilled water) poliovirus became <b>aggregated,</b> whereas reovirus did not, and again no mixed <b>aggregates</b> were formed. At pH 6, however, poliovirus again <b>aggregated</b> and, although reovirus did not, it attached to poliovirus <b>aggregates.</b> Thus, some inducement toward aggregation was necessary to cause formation of mixed <b>aggregates.</b> This inducement probably {{took the form of}} a reduction of the ionic double layer surrounding the particles, which is known to occur at low pH. At pH 5 and below both viruses <b>aggregated</b> severely, and large mixed <b>aggregates</b> were formed. These mixed <b>aggregates</b> could be broken up by neutralization of the suspension, although small <b>aggregates</b> of poliovirus remained. Reovirus showed a marked tendency to attach to large clumps of poliovirus, but the reverse tendency was not observed.
