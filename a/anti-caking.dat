5|$|Salt is {{processed}} from salt mines, {{and by the}} evaporation of seawater (sea salt) and mineral-rich spring water in shallow pools. Its major industrial products are caustic soda and chlorine; salt is used in many industrial processes including the manufacture of polyvinyl chloride, plastics, paper pulp and many other products. Of the annual global production of around two hundred million tonnes of salt, only about 6% is used for human consumption. Other uses include water conditioning processes, de-icing highways, and agricultural use. Edible salt is sold in forms such as sea salt and table salt which usually contains an <b>anti-caking</b> agent and may be iodised to prevent iodine deficiency. As well as its use in cooking and at the table, salt is present in many processed foods.|$|E
5|$|Sodium ferrocyanide, {{also known}} as yellow prussiate of soda, is {{sometimes}} added to salt as an anticaking agent. The additive is considered safe for human consumption. Such <b>anti-caking</b> agents have been added since at least 1911 when magnesium carbonate was first added to salt to make it flow more freely. The safety of sodium ferrocyanide as a food additive {{was found to be}} provisionally acceptable by the Committee on Toxicity in 1988. Other anticaking agents sometimes used include tricalcium phosphate, calcium or magnesium carbonates, fatty acid salts (acid salts), magnesium oxide, silicon dioxide, calcium silicate, sodium aluminosilicate and calcium aluminosilicate. Both the European Union and the United States Food and Drug Administration permitted the use of aluminium in the latter two compounds.|$|E
25|$|Salt for {{de-icing}} in the United Kingdom predominantly {{comes from}} a single mine in Winsford in Cheshire. Prior to distribution it is mixed with <100 ppm of sodium hexacyanoferrate(II) as an <b>anti-caking</b> agent, which enables rock salt to flow freely out of the gritting vehicles despite being stockpiled prior to use. In recent years this additive has also been used in table salt. Other additives {{had been used in}} road salt to reduce the total costs. For example, in the US, a byproduct carbohydrate solution from sugar-beet processing was mixed with rock salt and adhered to road surfaces about 40% better than loose rock salt alone. Because it stayed on the road longer, the treatment {{did not have to be}} repeated several times, saving time and money.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, the Code of Federal Regulations {{includes}} a Standard of Identity for [...] "Parmesan and reggiano cheese". This defines both {{aspects of the}} production process and of the final result. In particular, parmesan must be made of cow's milk, cured for 10 months or more, contain no more than 32% water, and have no less than 32% milkfat in its solids. Most grated parmesans in the US have cellulose added as an <b>anti-caking</b> agent, with up to 4% considered acceptable under Federal law. Several manufacturers have been investigated for allegedly going beyond the 4% limit.|$|E
2500|$|Sodium {{chloride}} is {{the principal}} extinguishing agent in fire extinguishers (Met-L-X, Super D) used on combustible metal fires such as magnesium, potassium, sodium, and NaK alloys (Class D). Thermoplastic powder {{is added to the}} mixture, along with waterproofing (metal stearates) and <b>anti-caking</b> materials (tricalcium phosphate) to form the extinguishing agent. When it is applied to the fire, the salt acts like a heat sink, dissipating heat from the fire, and also forms an oxygen-excluding crust to smother the fire. The plastic additive melts and helps the crust maintain its integrity until the burning metal cools below its ignition temperature. This type of extinguisher was invented in the late 1940s as a cartridge-operated unit, although stored pressure versions are now popular. Common sizes are [...] portable and [...] wheeled.|$|E

50|$|Salt shakers {{began to}} appear in the Victorian era, and patents show {{attempts}} {{to deal with the problem}} of salt clumping, but they remained the exception rather than the norm. It was not until after 1911, when <b>anti-caking</b> agents began to be added to table salt, that salt shakers gained favor and open salts began to fall into disuse.|$|E
50|$|Edible salt can be iodised by {{spraying}} {{it with a}} {{potassium iodate}} or potassium iodide solution. 57 grams of potassium iodate, costing about US$1.15 (in 2006), is required to iodise a ton of salt. Dextrose is added as a stabilizer to prevent potassium iodide from oxidizing and evaporating. <b>Anti-caking</b> agents such as calcium silicate are commonly added to table salt to prevent clumping.|$|E
5000|$|Salt {{and pepper}} shakers {{can be made}} from a variety of materials, {{including}} plastic, glass, metal, and ceramic. [...] Salt shakers became increasingly common after <b>anti-caking</b> agents were introduced by the Morton Salt company in the 1920s. [...] The Great Depression of the 1930s boosted the popularity of salt and pepper shakers as global ceramics producers concentrated on inexpensive items.|$|E
50|$|Coral grains are mined from fossilized coral beds on the coastline, {{and pumped}} from coral beds in shallow waters. Grains are then ground into a fine powder, and heat treated up to 1000 F and/or ozonated {{depending}} on the grade. The final product is either bagged as powder, or mixed with silicon dioxide (an <b>anti-caking</b> agent), rice flour, and magnesium stearate which acts as a lubricant, then encapsulated and bottled for retail sale.|$|E
5000|$|The U.S. Food Chemicals Codex, JECFA, {{and other}} monographs for Food Grade {{synthetic}} magnesium silicate specify a mole ratio of 2MgO:5SiO2.

He mixed the saccharin with dextrose to bulk it up to a teaspoon sized portion, added cream of tartar, and calcium silicate as <b>anti-caking</b> agents. His Cumberland Packing Corporation marketed the product, called Sweet'N Low, in bright pink packets so that the saccharin packets would not be confused with sugar packets at restaurants.|$|E

50|$|It {{is used in}} {{conjunction}} with trisodium phosphate in foods and water softening treatment. In foods, it is used to adjust pH. Its presence prevents coagulation in the preparation of condensed milk. Similarly, it is used as an <b>anti-caking</b> additive in powdered products. It is used in desserts and puddings, e.g. Cream of Wheat to quicken cook time, and Jell-O Instant Pudding for thickening. In water treatment, it retards calcium scale formation. It is also found in some detergents and cleaning agents.|$|E

E.g. a preservative added to an ingredient, like <b>anti-caking</b> agent sodium silicoaluminate in the seasoning of some sausages.|$|E
50|$|Pickling salt is a salt {{that is used}} {{mainly for}} canning and {{manufacturing}} pickles. It is sodium chloride, as is table salt, but unlike most brands of table salt, it does not contain iodine or any anti caking products added. A widely circulated legend suggested that iodisation caused the brine of pickles to change color. This is false; however, some <b>anti-caking</b> agents are known to collect {{at the bottom of}} the jars, a minor aesthetic issue. Pickling salt is very fine-grained, to speed up dissolving in water to create a brine, so it is useful for solutions needing salt.|$|E
50|$|The company sells over 110 {{varieties}} of salts, including pink Himalayan salt, smoked salts, {{black and white}} truffle salts, Fleur de sel, kosher salt and more. The salts are imported from 14 countries, including Brazil, France and Italy. The company sells retail, bulk and wholesale volumes ranging from 5 ounces to 40,000 pounds. SaltWorks uses a combination of sifters, aspirators, and rare-earth magnets to detect and filter unwanted materials from its salt. SaltWorks fabricates most of its processing equipment on-site.
