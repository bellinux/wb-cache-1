5000|$|The seven {{daughters of}} the Jade Emperor travel to the mortal world. The {{youngest}} of the seven fairy maidens was in search of her lost weaving equipment and her [...] "coat of feathers," [...] without which {{she was unable to}} fly. Another version of the story states that the seventh fairy's feather coat was actually stolen by a mortal named Dong Yong, advised by one of his cattle who happened to be an exiled fairy as well and disguised as a normal, <b>aged</b> <b>bull.</b> During the stay, the maiden falls in love with Dong Yong. He is a poor worker who had sold himself into servitude to pay for his father's funeral. With help of the other fairies, the seventh fairy managed to weave ten pieces of brocade for Dong Yong to pay off his debt, shortening his indenture to 100 days. Before the couple can begin their life together, the Jade Emperor orders his daughters to return home. However, he is kind enough to allow the couple to reunite once a year on the 七夕 (the 7th Evening) -- later known as the traditional Chinese Qixi Festival -- by crossing the Milky Way.|$|E

This paper reports the occurrence of an ultimobranchial tumor of the thyroid and an adrenal pheochromocytoma in an <b>aged</b> <b>bull</b> {{and the frequency of}} their coincidence in bulls. Materials and Methods A 14 -y-old Holstein bull was examined because of ruminal tympany. A stomach tube was passed into the rumen, releasing a large volume of gas. Palpa-tion revealed a large mass on the left in the region of the thyroid. Because of the age of the animal slaughter was recommended. The bull was killed in an abbatoir and examined for macroscopic lesions. Tissues for microscopic examination were fixed in Bouin's solution, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 6,u, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HBrE). Sections suspected of containing amyloid were stained with a 1 % aqueous solution of thioflavin-Tg. Sections were stained for chromaffin reaction by immersion for 24 h in a 3. 5 ' 34 solution of potassium dichromate in loo/, aqueous saline formalin. Records in the Section of Reproductive Pathology of the New York State Veterinary Collcge were examined to determine the incidence of ultimobranchial tumor of the thyroid and of pheochromocytoma among 402 bulls from a center for artificial insemination that had been slaughtered between 1950 and 1969.

40|$|Crossbred Hereford × Angus calves (n = 103) {{were used}} to {{determine}} the effects of early weaning on feedlot performance of bulls and steers. Treatments were: 1) early-weaned (117 days of <b>age)</b> <b>bulls,</b> 2) early-weaned steers, 3) normal-weaned (220 days of <b>age)</b> <b>bulls,</b> and 4) normal-weaned steers. Early-weaned calves were placed on a grower ration at an average age of 134 days and on a finishing ration at 182 days of age. Normal-weaned calves were placed on a finishing ration at 242 days of age. Weight, feed intake, and ultrasound measurements were recorded during the feeding period. Three early-weaned cattle were removed due to chronic bloat, and four early-weaned cattle died in the feedlot. The feedlot period was terminated at either 358 or 387 days of age. Early-weaned cattle had greater average daily gains early in the feedlot period, but normal-weaned cattle had greater gains later in the feedlot period. Excluding the initial weight at 117 days of age, early-weaned cattle maintained heavier weights throughout the feeding period. Bulls had greater average daily gains until feedlot entry of normal-weaned calves, but steers had greater average daily gains later in the feedlot period, resulting in similar final weights. For early-maturing British-type cattle, early weaning resulted in heavier final weights, but it may not be the most viable management strategy because of disadvantages in animal health. Overall, there was no growth-performance advantage for leaving males intact, suggesting that the implant regimen used for these steers was sufficient to compensate for the expected loss in performance when bulls are castrated...|$|R

40|$|Crossbred Hereford × Angus calves (n = 103) {{were used}} to {{determine}} the effect of early weaning on carcass and ribeye (longissimus muscle) characteristics of bulls and steers. Treatments were: 1) early-weaned (117 days of <b>age)</b> <b>bulls,</b> 2) early-weaned steers, 3) normal-weaned (220 days of <b>age)</b> <b>bulls,</b> and 4) normal-weaned steers. Cattle were harvested at 360 and 389 days of age. At 36 hours postmortem, carcass quality and cutability were measured. Ribeye steaks were aged 14 days and scored for color, Warner-Bratzler shear force, and sensory panel evaluations. Carcasses from early-weaned cattle had greater dressing percentages, heavier weights, greater fat thicknesses, and higher numerical USDA Yield Grades (lower cutability). They also had more marbling and greater USDA quality grades, but had similar longissimus color, shear force, and sensory panel scores, compared with those of normal-weaned cattle. Bulls had greater dressing percentages, but had similar carcass weights to steers. Bull carcasses had less fat thickness and greater ribeye areas, resulting in lower numerical USDA Yield Grades (higher cutability) than steers had. They also had less marbling, darker color, and lower USDA quality grades than steers did. Longissimus muscles from bulls were darker, had greater shear forces, and had lower sensory panel tenderness scores than those from steers. For early-maturing British-type cattle, early weaning is a viable management strategy to produce heavier, higher-quality carcasses than those of normal-weaned cattle. Carcasses from early-weaned cattle are fatter and have lower cutability. For a non-implant “natural” market, bulls could be an alternative for producing high-cutability carcasses. Steaks may be less tender, however, and pre-harvest management must be optimized to reduce dark-cutting carcasses...|$|R

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of cattle breeding and production depends {{to a large}} extent on the reproductive performance of the herd, with the bull playing a major role. Large differences in fertilizing ability between bulls exists, and such differences are due to the characteristics of individual bulls rather than to factors such as <b>age,</b> <b>bull</b> to cow ratio or type of mating. In Ethiopia, cattle breeding is mostly uncontrolled, making genetic improvement difficult. If improvement in cattle production is envisaged in the coming years, appropriate bulls election criteria have to be established and applied and controlled and selective breeding of cow herds should be implemented. This paper examines available information on bull reproduction in Ethiopia and highlights the different physiological functions of the bull in relation to reproductive performance. Major factors which influence bull reproductive function and fertility are discussed. Comparative data from other Bos indicus and Bos taurus breeds of cattle are included and areas of future research are outlined...|$|R

30|$|Since the {{differentiation}} of Leydig cells is completed by 6  months of <b>age</b> in <b>bull</b> calves (Amann et al. 1986), steroidogenesis {{has to take}} place in presence of LH. In the present study, LH levels were increased in the bull calves of all the three age groups but significant (p <  0.0001) amounts of testosterone was produced only in Group I (14 – 16  months of <b>age)</b> <b>bull</b> calves whereas Mongkonpunya et al. (1975) observed testosterone levels as high as 5.30  ng/ml in 6  months old HF bull calves after administration of exogenous GnRH. Growth hormone, insulin like growth factor- 1 (Lin et al. 1986; Horikawa et al. 1989), insulin-like peptide 3 (Pathirana et al. 2012) and other growth factors are required, in adequate amounts, for steroidogenesis and production of testosterone. Holstein–Friesian × Tharparkar crossbreds have not adapted to the tropical Indian environmental conditions (Gulia et al. 2010) and their body weight gain is poorer than the HF and Sahiwal breeds. The concentration of the metabolic hormones and growth factors vary with the body weight and growth (Verde and Trenkle 1987); this may be the reason for significant differences in the pre-treatment and post-treatment concentrations of testosterone between the bull calves of three different age groups in the present study and for lower magnitudes than the HF bull calves as observed by Mongkonpunya et al. (1975). The total estrogen levels did not differ after administration of exogenous GnRH in all the groups, which agreed with a similar study carried out on adult HF × Tharparkar bulls (Bharath Kumar et al. 2015). We did not find any significant difference in the peak concentrations and area under response curve of total estrogens and time taken to attain peak levels between the groups.|$|R

40|$|Parameters {{based on}} the {{probability}} of gene origin were used to describe genetic variability in three reproductive groups from the Breeding Program for Nellore Cattle (PMGRN). The three reproductive populations (cows in reproductive <b>age,</b> <b>bulls</b> from artificial insemination centers and young bulls in progeny test) generated medium to low values. The effective number of founders (Nf), the effective number of ancestors (Na) and the remaining genomes (Ng) suggest low founder representativeness, high genetic contribution by some ancestors, considerable loss of founder alleles and lack of allelic representativeness in bulls kept in artificial insemination centers and young sires in progeny test {{in relation to the}} diversity on the farms participating in the PMGRN.

Future matings and the introduction of selected progeny reproduction may decrease the parameters based on the probability of gene origin in each reproductive group, thereby increasing considerably the additive relationship in the three reproductive groups and consequently increasing the probability of inbreeding in the future.

This study investigated the age-related copy number variability of the bovine TSPY gene, a new and unstudied aspect of the biology of TSPY that has been shown to vary among cattle breeds, individual bulls and somatic tissues. The subjects of this prospective 30 -month long study were 25 Holstein bulls, sampled every six months. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to determine the relative TSPY copy number (rTSPY CN) and telomere length in the DNA samples extracted from blood. Twenty bulls showed an altered rTSPY CN after 30 months, although only 9 bulls showed a significant change (4 significant increase while 5 significant decrease, P< 0. 01). The sequential sampling provided the flow of rTSPY CN over six observations in 30 months and wide-spread variation of rTSPY CN was detected.
