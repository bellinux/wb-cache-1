40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} the {{cultural}} and historical potential {{of the development of}} peripheral regions of Czechia. The case study covers three model areas - regions of municipalities with an <b>authorised</b> municipal <b>office</b> Horažďovice, Kašperské Hory and Netolice. The aim of the thesis is to accomplish a discursive analysis of the concept of the cultural and historical potential, together with related terms, and to consider feasibility of its embodiment into the context of surrounding regions development in Czechia, to identify cultural and historical potential of selected model areas and to propose possibilities of its usage. The methodology lies in the study of literature and in the research of selected areas. The cultural and historical potential is rated from the identifiable elements and their particular importance. The potential is relative to the area, number of inhabitants and the number of parts of the municipality. The thesis highlights several findings: (i) the coherent definition of the term cultural and historical potential does not exist in scientific literature; (ii) usage of tourism perspectives in the regional development is ahead of focus on local population (regional identity and local cultural life is less frequent); (iii) cultural and historical potential differentiate in the border [...] ...|$|R
5|$|On 23 April 1943 the War <b>Office</b> <b>authorised</b> the {{formation}} of a second airborne division, which would be numbered the 6th Airborne Division.

To fill out the division, a new parachute brigade was raised on 1 July by the redesignation of the 72nd Independent Infantry Brigade. Numbered the 5th Parachute Brigade, it was initially commanded by Brigadier Edwin Flavell, but on 5 July he was given command of the Airborne Forces Depot, and Brigadier Nigel Poett took over the brigade.

The training of the 2nd-Line divisional artillery had been seriously delayed by lack of arms and equipment. One field artillery brigade had to borrow carbines from the Preston Church Lads Brigade. Only in mid-July 1915 did each field artillery brigade receive two 15-pounder BLC guns without sights. In September 1915 the 2nd-Line divisional artillery took over the obsolete 15-pounders and 5-inch howitzers when the 1st-Line artillery was re-equipped. The 2nd-Line received their modern 18-pounders and 4.5-inch howitzers in December 1915 and January 1916. Shortly afterwards the infantry battalions received their allotment of Lewis Guns.|$|R

40|$|Most {{professional}} accountancy bodies' qualification processes encompass three {{components: a}} prescribed programme of professional education, {{some form of}} work experience and a formal final examination to determine professional competence. However, IFAC (2003 a) suggest that purely theoretical and knowledge-based education {{does not meet the}} needs of all employers. Thus professional bodies are encouraged to find ways to deliver and assess relevant competences in the most appropriate manner. Despite educationalists suggesting that performance measurements based on direct observation within the work place are more effective at measuring competences than traditional paper based examinations, assessment strategies within the accountancy domain remain conservative. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland (ICAS) {{was one of the first}} professional bodies to introduce a competency-based approach to work based assessment in 1999 and subsequently undertook a review of the process in 2004. The data collected for the review was undertaken by way of a questionnaire to <b>authorised</b> training <b>offices,</b> in depth interviews with employers and discussions which emanated from a Working Party which included internal ICAS employees, an academic and a representative from a large accountancy firm. This paper presents the findings of the review, discusses the pertinent issues in relation to work based assessment and outlines the changes that were made to the competency-based approach adopted by ICAS.

40|$|Extract] Section 264 {{is one of}} a raft of {{provisions}} at the disposal of the Tax <b>Office</b> <b>authorising</b> it to require persons to furnish information and evidence to it. It sits alongside s 263, which is the primary provision <b>authorising</b> the Tax <b>Office</b> to have access to buildings and documents and to make copies: see [263. 10]. Section 264 complements this power by requiring any person to whom a notice is issued to furnish information, to attend and give evidence and/or produce documents. It is, however, an independent power and not dependent on the Tax Office first seeking to exercise its powers under s 263. It further complements s 162, which <b>authorises</b> the Tax <b>Office</b> to require a person to lodge a tax return or furnish further information about their financial affairs. Section 264 can, however, be directed to persons other than the taxpayer whose affairs are at issue. This power is not without its limitations and is reviewable under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. In particular, it must be appropriately authorised, exercised by notice in writing and contain sufficient particularity: see [264. 100]. It must be exercised bona fide and solely {{for the purposes of the}} Act: see [264. 420]. Furthermore, notices issued under s 264 (1) (b) must be issued for the purposes of identifying a person's income or income-tax assessment: see [264. 620]. The exercise of the power is not subject to any privilege against incrimination, but it is subject to legal professional privilege: see [264. 820]. It should be an acknowledged that the policy of the Tax Office is to only use the power under s 264 as a last resort as requests for information will, initially at least, be typically made on a less formal basis. As it is no defence to an addressee to argue an obligation of confidentiality, persons concerned about breaching any obligation of confidentiality by supplying information to the Tax Office should request that a s 264 notice be issued to them. It should also be noted that, under s 353 - 10 of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 (TAA), the Tax Office has similar powers to those contained in ss 263 and 264 of ITAA 1936. While s 353 - 10 is the primary provision utilised by the Tax Office to acquire information in relation to a goods and services tax assessment, it is also relevant to the administration of the TAA (including the collection of income tax). In fact, it is the preferred information gathering power of the Tax Office for use in debt collection work. Section 264 is considered by the Tax Office as more suitable to lodgement activities – although if the Tax Office wishes to acquire books or documents then this can also be achieved pursuant a search warrant obtained by the Australian Federal Police under the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) (or by the Australian Crime Commission under the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002). A failure to comply with a s 264 notice would amount to an offence under either s 8 C or 8 D of TAA, with the quantum of the penalties applicable dealt with in Taxation Administration Act 1953 s 8 E: see [264. 860]...|$|R

5000|$|R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, {{ex parte}} Northumbria Police Authority 1989 1 QB 26 was an English {{administrative}} law decision that first recognised the prerogative {{power to do}} whatever [...] "was necessary to meet either an actual or an apprehended threat to the peace". It concerned the Home Office's decision to maintain a store of CS gas and plastic baton rounds. In 1986, a Home <b>Office</b> circular, 40/1986, <b>authorised</b> the Home Secretary to release this store to a police force without {{the approval of the}} Chief Constable if Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary agreed that it was necessary. The Northumbria Police Authority brought a judicial review case against this decision, arguing that it was ultra vires. The Divisional Court which heard the case recognised a prerogative power to keep the peace, which <b>authorised</b> the Home <b>Office's</b> actions. On appeal to the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, the decision was confirmed, although several alternate grounds for allowing the distribution of the store were also given.|$|R
50|$|On 31 August 1914, 27 {{days after}} the British {{declaration}} of war on Germany, the War <b>Office</b> <b>authorised</b> the formation of 2nd Line units for all Territorial Force (TF) units that were being sent overseas. As a result, the 2/1st Staffordshire Brigade came into existence, as a duplicate of the 1/1st Staffordshire Brigade, {{which was part of}} the North Midland Division, and was assigned to the 2nd North Midland Division. The brigade (and division) was formed mainly from those men in the Territorial Force who, when asked at the outbreak of war, did not volunteer for service overseas (as soldiers who joined the TF were not obligated to serve overseas). Like the 1st Line formation, the brigade was composed of two battalions of the South Staffordshire Regiment and two of the North Staffordshire Regiment. To distinguish the 2nd Line from the 1st Line, they adopted the '2/' prefix (so a 2nd Line battalion would become 2/5th North Staffs, for example, and a 1st Line 1/5th North Staffs). The original intention of the 2nd Line units was to act in a home service role and to supply drafts of replacements overseas to the 1st Line units.|$|R
5000|$|Home Secretary Winston Churchill {{learned of}} this {{development}} and, after {{discussions with the}} War Office, delayed action on the request. Churchill felt that the local authorities were over-reacting, and believed that the Liberal government could calm matters down. He instead despatched Metropolitan police officers, both on foot and mounted, and sent some cavalry troops to Cardiff. He did not specifically deploy cavalry, but authorised their use by civil authorities, if deemed necessary. Churchill's personal message to strikers was, [...] "We are holding back the soldiers for the present and sending only police." [...] Despite this assurance, the local stipendiary magistrate telegrammed London later that day and requested military support, which the Home <b>Office</b> <b>authorised.</b> Troops were deployed after the skirmish at the Glamorgan Colliery on 7 November, but before rioting {{on the evening of}} 8 November. During the evening of rioting, properties in Tonypandy were damaged and some looting took place. Shops were smashed systematically, but not indiscriminately. There was little looting, but some rioters wore clothes taken from the shops and paraded in a festival atmosphere. Women and children were involved in considerable numbers, as they had been outside the Glamorgan colliery. No police were seen at the town square, until the Metropolitan Police arrived around 10:30 pm, almost three hours after the rioting began, when the disturbance subsided of its own accord. A few shops remained untouched, notably that of chemist Willie Llewellyn, rumoured to have been spared because he had been a famous Welsh international rugby footballer.|$|R
500|$|There {{were several}} {{variants}} of the Tetrarch design. The {{first was the}} Light Tank Mk VIII, Vickers-Armstrong's proposed successor to the Tetrarch. The Mark VIII was {{also known as the}} Harry Hopkins, named after President Roosevelt's chief diplomatic advisor, and was given the General Staff design number A25 by the War Office. The Mark VIII was intended to improve upon the design of the Tetrarch in a number of areas. It had thicker armour than the Tetrarch, with the front hull and turret armour increased to a thickness of [...] and the side armour to , and the turret and hull given more sloped surfaces [...] to help deflect shells fired at the tank. The dimensions of the Tetrarch were also changed; the Mark VIII was longer by , wider by [...] and heavier. The new tank was no longer air-portable, as it was too heavy to be carried by a Hamilcar. The 12-cylinder engine of the Tetrarch was fitted to the Mark VIII, although the increased weight meant that its maximum speed decreased to its armament also remained {{the same as that of}} the Tetrarch. The War <b>Office</b> <b>authorised</b> the construction of three prototype models in April 1941. [...] The new design was considered a success, and the Tank Board of the War Office ordered 1,000 to be constructed in September. However, problems were encountered with further tests of the prototypes, and a report issued in December 1942 stated that production of the Mark VIII had been delayed due to developmental problems. These problems continued to persist into 1943, when the War Office decided against using the tank in active service; approximately 100 Mark VIIIs were produced by 1945, when production ended.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{critically}} evaluate whether biodata {{could be used as}} a valid tool in the pre-selection process of trainee chartered accountants. Biographical details of recently qualified accountants who trained within the whole spectrum of ICAS training offices, were collected from a self-completion questionnaire. The data collected was used to develop statistical models predicting two relevant pre-selection criteria for the accounting profession, namely the ability to pass the professional examinations at the first attempt and the probability of remaining with the training provider for at least 18 months post qualification. The validity of the developed models for use within the Scottish accountancy profession was then evaluated. Phase I of the thesis developed two models which considered examination performance, one based on honours graduates (n [...] 183) and the other based on ordinary graduates (n= 366) who qualified in the years 1988 - 1992. An empirical approach was adopted. Whilst statistically significant explanatory powers were identified for each model, a disappointing shrinkage was experienced when the models were applied to trainees who qualified in the years 1993 - 94. Two possible explanations were offered, the instability of the reference group and the empirical nature of the model derivation. Phase 11 of the thesis therefore adopted a more rational approach through the formulation of a conceptual framework. General background areas were hypothesised to be relevant in the determination of the criteria, and within these general areas specific factors were highlighted and entered into the logistic regression models using data from trainees who qualified in the years 1993 - 4. Statistically significant models were developed for both fully-accredited honours (n [...] - 149) and ordinary graduates (n [...] 225) and these models continued to retain their validity when applied to trainees who qualified in 1995. The model developed for non-relevant honours students (n [...] 61) was not significant highlighting the need for further work in this area. Likewise, from the data collected, an effective tenure model was not developed. This thesis has provided an additional validity study for the technique of biodata. by identifying that rationally derived biodata models can be used to differentiate between fully-accredited trainees who pass their WAS examinations at the first attempt and those who experience failure. This work therefore provides training principals who employ fully-accredited graduates to undertake WAS training with a useful preselection tool. It also provides evidence that rationally derived models appear to retain their validity and experience less shrinkage than models which were developed using a more empirical approach. Finally, the work demonstrates that it is possible to develop biodata models which are transportable across the full spectrum of ICAS <b>authorised</b> training <b>offices</b> and that biodata can therefore be transportable from one organisation to another...|$|R
