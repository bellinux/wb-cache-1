5|$|Evans' {{contributions}} to steam {{were not as}} ground-breaking as his earlier work in milling but he {{played a critical role}} by inventing and propagating the high-pressure steam engine in the United States. Evans' engines, particularly the Columbian, were highly influential in early steam-power applications in United States (particularly in the evolution of steamboats and steam-powered industrial processes). Yet once more Evans was <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> with many of his ideas, and his death during steam's infancy in the United States meant that it would be some time before many of his ideas would come to fruition. For example, although a leading advocate for high-pressure engines, it would not be until the 1830s that such engines definitively replaced low-pressure designs. And Evans' dream of a steam wagon, notwithstanding the brave attempt of the Oruktor Amphibolos, would not see widespread adoption until even later. And unlike his earlier contributions, Evans was just one of many brilliant minds in steam technology. It would be another inventor, Richard Trevithick, working totally independently of Evans who would develop the high-pressure engine that would make that dream possible.|$|E
25|$|With {{health care}} {{knowledge}} growing steadily, nurses can stay <b>ahead</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>curve</b> through continuing education. Continuing education classes and programs enable nurses {{to provide the}} best possible care to patients, advance nursing careers, and keep up with Board of Nursing requirements. The American Nurses Association and the American Nursing Credentialing Center are devoted to ensuring nurses have access to quality continuing education offerings. Continuing education classes are calibrated to provide enhanced learning for all levels of nurses. Many States also regulate Continuing Nursing Education. Nursing licensing boards requiring Continuing Nursing Education (CNE) as a condition for licensure, either initial or renewal, accept courses provided by organizations that are accredited by other state licensing boards, by the American Nursing Credentialing Center (ANCC), or by organizations that have been designated as an approver of continuing nursing education by ANCC. There are some exceptions to this rule including the state of California, Florida and Kentucky. National Healthcare Institute has created a list to assist nurses in determining their CNE credit hours requirements. While this list is not all inclusive, it offers details on how to contact nursing licensing boards directly.|$|E

Underserviced urban areas are high-density contexts that are pressured by poor economic conditions, high family mobility, sub-standard health care, and inadequate living conditions. Youth living in such contexts are at added risk because underserviced neighborhoods generally contain hardto-staff schools, where high percentages of low achieving students are often pushed-out or simply drop out (Lee & Radner, 2006; Peterman, 2008). Many experts indicate {{that there is a}} pressing need to attract and retain highly qualified teachers who are prepared to work in urban schools (Tough, 2008), but teacher shortages rarely exist outside the highest-need urban schools (Lee & Radner, 2006).
