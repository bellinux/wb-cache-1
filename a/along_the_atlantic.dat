5|$|As {{with most}} of the Great White Fleet ships, Kearsarge was modernized on her return. She was {{decommissioned}} at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 4 September 1909, and the modernization was completed in 1911, at a cost of US$675,000. The ship received cage masts, new water-tube boilers, and another four 5-inch guns. The 1-pounder guns were removed, as were sixteen of the 6-pounders. She was recommissioned on 23 June 1915, and operated <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> coast. On 17 September she left Philadelphia to land a detachment of US Marines at Veracruz, Mexico, remaining there from 28 September 1915 to 5 January 1916. She then carried the Marines to New Orleans, Louisiana, before joining the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Philadelphia on 4 February. Until the United States joined World War I, she trained naval militia from Massachusetts and Maine. During the war she was used to train Armed Guard crews and naval engineers during cruises <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> seaboard. On 18 August 1918 Kearsarge rescued 26 survivors of the Norwegian barque Nordhav which had been sunk by , bringing them to Boston.|$|E
5|$|By October 1938, {{the ship}} had been renamed Pan Gulf to reflect the naming style of her new owners, the Pan-Atlantic Steamship Company, a {{subsidiary}} of Waterman Steamship Company.

5|$|Overhill Cherokee was {{the term}} for the Cherokee people located in their {{historic}} settlements {{in what is now}} the U.S. state of Tennessee in the Southeastern United States, {{on the west side of}} the Appalachian Mountains.

5|$|Alarmed by {{the raids}} on St Nazaire and Dieppe in 1942, Hitler ordered the {{construction}} of fortifications all <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> coast, from Spain to Norway, to protect against an expected Allied invasion. He envisioned 15,000 emplacements manned by 300,000 troops, but due to shortages, particularly of concrete and manpower, most of the strongpoints were never built. As the expected site of an Allied invasion, Pas de Calais was heavily defended. In the Normandy area the best fortifications were concentrated at the port facilities at Cherbourg and Saint-Malo.|$|E

5|$|Gedi's {{participation}} in maritime trade {{can be seen}} in the increasing frequency of imports found at Gedi over the course of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Conditions <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> coast prevented European nations from opening sea lanes until the early-sixteenth century, limiting maritime trade to states with easy access to the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. Many artifacts found at Gedi including much of the ceramics, all the beads, and the two Chinese coins resulted from either direct or indirect trade with the Near East, Arabia, China, India, and Indochina. Swahili coastal settlements exported gold, ivory, slaves, ebony, mangrove poles, copper, copal gum, frankincense, myrrh, and crystal rock.|$|E
5|$|In August 1933, the Los Angeles Times {{reported}} that the Shepard Line had secured a year-long charter of Exford for their expanded intercoastal service between North Atlantic ports and the Pacific ports of Los Angeles; San Francisco; Portland, Oregon; and Seattle. Later in 1933, the ship was renamed Pan Royal to reflect the naming style of her new owners, the Pan-Atlantic Steamship Company, a subsidiary of Waterman Steamship Company. The Pan-Atlantic Line sailed in coastal service <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> and Gulf coasts, {{and it is likely}} that Pan Royal called at typical Pan-Atlantic ports such as Baltimore, Miami, Tampa, New Orleans, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston from this time.|$|E

5|$|In the 1980s, {{plans were}} made for a limited-access Relief Route of US 13 between Dover and the Wilmington area that would {{alleviate}} it of traffic heading to the Delaware Beaches in the summer. This Relief Route would become designated as part of DE 1, a route that ran <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean in Sussex County and north to Milford. The DE 1 toll road between Dover Air Force Base and Christiana opened in stages between 1991 and 2003. The total cost to build the DE 1 toll road was $900 million {{and it was the}} largest public works project in Delaware history.|$|E
5|$|Massachusetts {{is located}} <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Flyway, a major route for migratory {{waterfowl}} {{along the eastern}} coast. Lakes in central Massachusetts provide habitat for many species of fish and waterfowl, but some species such as the common loon are becoming rare. A significant population of long-tailed ducks winter off Nantucket. Small offshore islands and beaches are home to roseate terns and are important breeding areas for the locally threatened piping plover. Protected {{areas such as the}} Monomoy National Wildlife Refuge provide critical breeding habitat for shorebirds and a variety of marine wildlife including a large population of grey seals.|$|E

This new rate is charged to motorists heading to or from the east <b>along</b> <b>the</b> <b>Atlantic</b> City Expressway at Route 50. The proposal drew opposition from area officials who felt the proposed rate was too high.
