This paper attempts to explain several reasons for the slow adoption rates and identifies four related trends and developments that {{can be expected to}} lead to more rapid growth in the future: (1) a shift away from employer-provided health care to consumer-directed health-care plans, (2) an expansion of health-care savings accounts, (3) a move toward using debit and prepaid card applications to address limitations in paper-based environments, and (4) a recent Internal Revenue Service ruling intended to improve the efficiency <b>of</b> electronic <b>payment</b> processing. While these factors are expected to contribute to the <b>acceleration</b> <b>of</b> growth for <b>payment</b> card applications in health care, we know less about potential barriers stemming from consumer behavior, raising a cautionary note pending further research.

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> systems aimed at identifying the categorical terminological apparatus, proving their specific features and revealing the impact <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> systems {{on the state of}} money turnover. On the basis of the subject analysis, the author formulates the definitions <b>of</b> a <b>payment</b> system (characterized by increasing speed <b>of</b> effecting <b>payments,</b> by the reduction of costs, by high degree <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> convenience for subjects of transactions, by security <b>of</b> <b>payments,</b> by acceptable level of risks and by social efficiency), a national payment system, and a local payment system (characterized by the growth of economic and social efficiency of systems participants, by the process of money turnover optimization on the basis of saving transaction costs and increasing speed of money flows within the local payment systems). According to the economic levels, the payment systems are divided to macrosystems (national payment systems), mezosystems (payment systems localized on the operational and territorial basis), microsystems (payments by individual economic subjects). The establishment of qualitative features <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> systems, which is a basis of the author’s terminological interpretation, gave a possibility to reveal the cause-effect relations <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> systems influence on the state of money turnover in the involved subjects, and on the economy as a whole. The result of the present research consists in revealing the payment systems influence on the state of money turnover which is significant: at the state and regional level – in the optimization of budget and inter-budgetary relations, in <b>acceleration</b> <b>of</b> the money turnover, in deceleration of the money supply and inflation rate, in reduced need in money emission; at the level of economic entities – in accelerating the money turnover and accounts receivable, in the reduction of debit and credit loans, in the growth of profit (turnover); at the household level – in reduction <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> costs, in increasing the purchasing power, in deceleration of the need for short-term loans, in <b>acceleration</b> <b>of</b> the capacity of savings and investment. The results of the research may be used in the elaboration of the strategy <b>of</b> the <b>payment</b> system development and in the formation <b>of</b> the national <b>payment</b> system...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the <b>acceleration</b> <b>of</b> inflation in Brazil. In the early 1980 s, the Brazilian inflation rate increased in good measure {{because of the}} balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> crisis and because of large depreciations of the cruzeiro. The Cruzado Plan failed to stop inflation because of an extremely loose monetary policy coupled {{with a lack of}} fiscal austerity. Repeated price controls have increased the variability of inflation. More recently, the decline in tax collections and the growth <b>of</b> interest <b>payments</b> on a ballooning domestic debt have built up a massive fiscal problem. Flight from money has further aggravated Brazilian inflation. Two steps are used in explaining the Brazilian inflationary process: the analysis of price freezes in the context of sustained fiscal imbalance and the research on the consequences of different fiscal deficit financing forms. The paths of inflation and real cash balances in response to different shocks are simulated. The focus is on the effects of controls that impose a temporary reduction of the inflation rate under different choices for monetary and fiscal policies. A model of an open economy where agents can hold money, domestic bonds and inventories of goods clarifies the linkage between Brazil's growing inability to finance the public sector deficit externally after 1982 and the <b>acceleration</b> <b>of</b> inflation. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates {{macroeconomic}} {{determinants of}} the balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> in Namibia for the period 1999 to 2009. The investigation was conducted through cointegrated vector autoregression methods. The investigation reveals that fiscal balance, GDP and interest rate are the main determinants <b>of</b> balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> in Namibia. Increase in GDP and interest rate causes an improvement in the balance <b>of</b> <b>payments.</b> The positive effect of GDP on balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> suggests that expansion of export has {{a positive impact on}} current account and the overall balance <b>of</b> <b>payments.</b> More increased export potential through the development of new products and services should be encouraged. The positive impact of interest rate on balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> suggests that interest rate {{can be used as a}} policy tool to ensure favourable capital account and for improved balance <b>of</b> <b>payments.</b> An improvement in the fiscal balance is also associated with an improvement in the balance <b>of</b> <b>payments.</b> This implies that policymakers need to assess the forecast of SACU receipts in order to ensure readiness proactively when these receipts decline to avoid a possible macroeconomic, fiscal and balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> instability. </p...|$|R

In this sense, the balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> is one <b>of</b> the major indicators of a country's status in international trade. As its strength and sustainability significantly affect the economic policies of a government and global competitiveness, every country strives to a have a favorable balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> and maintains its long run sustainability. India’s balance <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> position was quite unfavorable during the time of country’s entry into liberalized trade regime. Two decade of economic reforms and free trade opened several opportunities that reflected in the balance <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> performance <b>of</b> the country.
