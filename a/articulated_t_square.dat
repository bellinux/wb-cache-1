The atmospheric stability was characterized by measurements of profiles of mean wind velocity, temperature and relative humidity. This paper will focus on turbulence properties and turbulent heat flux measured during four marine fog events. The fogs were characterized by a slightly unstable boundary layer with moderate increases of heat flux during the fog. An ensemble average of the fog events showed that C sub <b>T</b> <b>squared</b> and epsilon reached peak values immediately {{before and after the}} fog was encountered.

40|$|Selection of {{efficient}} indices is {{very important}} for detecting and measuring random, uniform and clumped distribution patterns of plants in different plant communities. To compare and evaluate indices of dispersion patterns of plants, three stands were selected in Nodushan, Yazd. A (50 m* 100 m) area was selected within each stand for sampling. Sampling was randomly systematicly conducted. Measurements and counts were made at 50 points and (1 and 2 m 2 ) quadrats which were randomly selected along four 100 m transects within each sampling area. Indices of dispersion using quadrate studied in this survey include: Standardized index of Morisita, Morisita's index, Green's index, Dispersion (variance/mean ratio) index, Lloyd's index of patchiness and distance indices of dispersion including Pielou, Hopkines, <b>T</b> <b>square,</b> Eberhardt, Hines, Johnson and Zimer and Holgate indices. Results showed that <b>T</b> <b>square</b> and Holgate indices were more powerful than the other indices for detecting intensity of small-scale and tightly clumped pattern of shrubs because the two indices could distinguish between single individuals and the individuals on the edges of dense and small clumps. Johnson and Zimer index and Standardized index of Morisita (in shrublands with plant cover greater than 5 %) were more efficient than the other indices for determining spatial pattern of these small clumps and single individuals. Among studied indices of dispersion, Green's index had the highest precision and with the exception of this index, distance indices were more precise than the quadrate indices...|$|R

40|$|The {{available}} potential {{ecological factors}} have been scored {{in the form of}} presence/absence in U. T. M. sqaures in Belgium. A correspondence analysis shows a strong underlying gradient in the data set which induces an extraordinary horsehoe effect. This gradient follows closely the altitude component. Applying the k-means clustering method on U. <b>T.</b> M. <b>squares</b> produces geographically compact groups which are largely hierarchically nested. This indicates strong regional trends in the ecological data set. As homogeneous groups may also be artefacts created by the clustering algorithms on a continuous gradient, the relevance of the borders between homogeneous areas is tested.

The product treated is a large-scale <b>T</b> <b>squared</b> L array designed for space applications.

Test vehicles are described which enable evaluation of device characteristics, surface condition, and various parameters of the two-level metallization system used. Evaluation of these test vehicles is performed on a lot qualification basis, with the lot consisting of one wafer. Assembled test vehicles are evaluated by high temperature stress at 300 C for short time durations.
