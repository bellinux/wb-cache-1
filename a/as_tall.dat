50|$|When {{it began}} operating, Technocosmos was the World's tallest extant Ferris wheel. At that time, the tallest Ferris wheel ever built was the 100 m Grande Roue de Paris (built for the 1900 Exposition Universelle in France) which was {{demolished}} in 1920. In 1989 the 107.5 m Cosmo Clock 21 opened for business in Yokohama and succeeded both Technocosmos <b>as</b> <b>tallest</b> extant Ferris wheel and Grande Roue de Paris <b>as</b> <b>tallest</b> Ferris wheel ever built.|$|R

5|$|There is found, in {{northern}} Poitou, donkeys which are <b>as</b> <b>tall</b> as large mules. They are almost completely covered in hair a half-foot long with legs and joints {{as large as}} a those of a carriage horse.|$|E
5|$|Although skull {{proportions}} varied, abelisaurid skulls {{were generally}} very tall and very short in length. In Carnotaurus, for example, the skull was nearly <b>as</b> <b>tall</b> {{as it was}} long. The premaxilla in abelisaurids was very tall, so {{the front of the}} snout was blunt, not tapered as seen in many other theropods.|$|E
5|$|Ford had 20 career fumble {{recoveries}} at {{the time}} of his retirement. Ford was successful in part because of his combination of quickness and size. Few players of his era who were <b>as</b> <b>tall</b> and big as he was could move as fast; only Larry Brink of the Rams was close to him in proportions.|$|E
50|$|Latham {{described}} the Mordvins <b>as</b> <b>taller</b> than the Mari, with thin beards, flat faces and brown or red hair, red hair being more frequent among the Ersad than the Mokshad.|$|R

5000|$|... #Caption: In 2008, One Museum Park (left [...] ) {{replaced}} 1700 East 56th Street (right 2007-06-02) <b>as</b> the <b>tallest</b> South Side building. It {{has also}} replaced 340 on the Park <b>as</b> the <b>tallest</b> all-residential building in Chicago.|$|R
5|$|L. vellereus {{is larger}} {{with a thick}} stipe, woolly cap and less crowded gills, but is not <b>as</b> <b>tall.</b> Russula delica is similar in colour and shape, though has adnate blue-green tinged gills and no milk. L. deceptivus is also similar, but is {{differentiated}} by its less crowded gills, firmer cap margin and less acrid milk. Close to L. piperatus is L. glaucescens, which is differentiated by its milk that dries with a greenish colour.|$|E
5|$|Narcissus is a genus of {{perennial}} herbaceous bulbiferous geophytes, dying {{back after}} flowering to an underground storage bulb. They regrow {{in the following}} year from brown-skinned ovoid bulbs with pronounced necks, and reach heights of 5–80cm depending on the species. Dwarf species such as N. asturiensis have a maximum height of 5–8cm, while Narcissus tazetta may grow <b>as</b> <b>tall</b> as 80cm.|$|E
5|$|Plant use of {{endophytic}} {{fungi in}} defense {{is a very}} common phenomenon. Most plants have endophytes, microbial organisms that live within them. While some cause disease, others protect plants from herbivores and pathogenic microbes. Endophytes can help the plant by producing toxins harmful to other organisms that would attack the plant, such as alkaloid producing fungi which are common in grasses such <b>as</b> <b>tall</b> fescue (Festuca arundinacea).|$|E
50|$|The Warsaw Radio Mast was the world's tallest {{structure}} from 1974 {{until its}} collapse on 8 August 1991. It {{is the second}} tallest structure ever built, being surpassed <b>as</b> <b>tallest</b> by the Burj Khalifa, completed in 2010.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} other {{solutions}} available to prevent beer bottled in clear and green glass from becoming skunked or light-struck, such <b>as</b> <b>taller</b> walls on 6-pack carriers, which is common with craft beers and highlighted in Samuel Adams marketing.|$|R
5000|$|Rotterdam is {{also home}} to the tallest office {{building}} 'Maastoren' (164.75 m) which houses Deloitte. This office tower surpassed the 'Delftse Poort' (160 m) which houses Nationale-Nederlanden insurance company, part of ING Group <b>as</b> <b>tallest</b> office tower in 2009.|$|R
5|$|Tatiana was {{described}} <b>as</b> <b>tall</b> and slender, with dark auburn hair and dark blue-gray eyes, fine, chiseled features, and a refined, elegant bearing befitting {{the daughter of}} an Emperor. She was considered the most beautiful of the four grand duchesses by many courtiers. Of all her sisters, Tatiana most closely resembled their mother.|$|E
5|$|The species {{grows in}} sand dunes of white, white-grey or {{yellow-brown}} sand, amongst {{a system of}} ephemeral salt creeks. Populations occur both in low-lying areas near creeks, and atop dunes. The vegetation {{has been described as}} low open woodland over heath, and <b>as</b> <b>tall</b> open shrubland with some scattered trees.|$|E
5|$|The three named {{species of}} Gryposaurus differ in {{details of the}} skull and lower jaw. The {{prominent}} nasal arch found in this genus is formed from the paired nasal bones. In profile view, they rise into a rounded hump {{in front of the}} eyes, reaching a height <b>as</b> <b>tall</b> as the highest point {{of the back of the}} skull. The skeleton is known in great detail, making it a useful point of reference for other duckbill skeletons.|$|E

5000|$|The club's {{motto is}} “Youth, to be served, must serve” and {{variations}} on the club slogan include “One never stands so <b>tall</b> <b>as</b> when kneeling to help a child,” [...] "A man never stands so <b>tall</b> <b>as</b> when he kneels to help a child," [...] "Man never stands so <b>tall</b> <b>as</b> when kneeling to help a child," [...] and [...] "A person never stands so <b>tall</b> <b>as</b> when kneeling to help a child." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{goddess of}} war and battle, she is huge, and {{described}} <b>as</b> <b>taller</b> kneeling than Sieh standing. Like Kurue and Sieh, she is another of Nahadoth's children, and the one to mark Yeine so that she'll be free from Arameri control. Yeine earns her respect after she kills Kurue.|$|R
5|$|Jean Brooks as Jacqueline Gibson, {{the elder}} sister of Mary Gibson. Jacqueline is Mary's only {{relative}} and {{was responsible for}} raising her. Characterized as a depressive, she {{was the owner of}} La Sagasse, a cosmetics company in Manhattan prior to her disappearance. Mary describes Jacqueline <b>as</b> <b>tall</b> and strikingly beautiful. After becoming involved with the Palladists and falling into a deep depression, Jacqueline confided in Dr. Judd about the cult. As a result of the cult's strict rules about secrecy, it is mandated that she must die for revealing information about them.|$|E
5|$|The Kathiawari {{is closely}} related to the Marwari breed from the Marwar region of Rajasthan, which borders with {{northern}} Gujarat. Genetic diversity analysis groups the two breeds, while the other four Indian horse breeds – the Bhutia, the Manipuri, the Spiti and the Zaniskari – form a distinct and separate group. The Kathiawari and the Marwari are also phenotypically similar; in particular, they have the same unusual in-curved ears. The Kathiawari is not <b>as</b> <b>tall</b> as the Marwari, and has a smaller thoracic circumference; it is most commonly chestnut, while the Marwari is usually black. Kathiawaris tend to have slight facial differences from the Marwari. The Kathiawari also resembles the Arab horse, which contributed significantly during the development of the breed.|$|E
5|$|The main ore {{of mercury}} is cinnabar, long {{used as a}} pigment by painters. He says that the colour is similar to scolecium, {{probably}} the kermes insect. The dust is very toxic, so workers handling the material wear face masks of bladder skin. Copper and bronze are, says Pliny, most famous for their use in statues including colossi, gigantic statues <b>as</b> <b>tall</b> as towers, the most famous being the Colossus of Rhodes. He personally saw the massive statue of Nero in Rome, which was removed after the emperor's death. The face of the statue was modified shortly after Nero's death during Vespasian's reign, {{to make it a}} statue of Sol. Hadrian moved it, {{with the help of the}} architect Decrianus and 24 elephants, to a position next to the Flavian Amphitheatre (now called the Colosseum).|$|E
50|$|Sa'id is {{described}} <b>as</b> a <b>tall,</b> hairy, dark-skinned man.|$|R
5000|$|Madame de Vintimille was {{described}} <b>as</b> <b>taller,</b> louder, wittier than her older sister. She {{was much more}} ambitious than her older sister and predecessor, Madame de Mailly, and possessed a great desire for money and political influence; [...] her arrogance quickly made her hated within the court and by the people.|$|R
5000|$|Ruth Agnes McCall Robertson Marietta (May 24, 1905 [...] - [...] February 17, 1998) was an American photojournalist known {{most for}} photographing Angel Falls in Venezuela and {{surveying}} them to establish them <b>as</b> <b>tallest</b> waterfalls {{in the world}} published in National Geographic magazine, November 1949. She was born in Taylorville, Illinois.|$|R
5|$|A bike is also {{an example}} of an {{inverted}} pendulum. Just as a broomstick is more easily balanced in the hand than a pencil, a tall bike (with a high center of mass) can be easier to balance when ridden than a low one because the tall bike's lean rate (rate at which its angle of lean increases as it begins to fall over) will be slower. However, a rider can have the opposite impression of a bike when it is stationary. A top-heavy bike can require more effort to keep upright, when stopped in traffic for example, than a bike which is just <b>as</b> <b>tall</b> but with a lower center of mass. This {{is an example of a}} vertical second-class lever. A small force at the end of the lever, the seat or handlebars at the top of the bike, more easily moves a large mass if the mass is closer to the fulcrum, where the tires touch the ground. This is why touring cyclists are advised to carry loads low on a bike, and panniers hang down on either side of front and rear racks.|$|E
5|$|All of the fins, {{particularly}} the narrow pectoral fins, are falcate (sickle-shaped) to some degree. The medium-sized first dorsal fin originates {{just behind the}} pectoral fin rear tips. The second dorsal fin is about two-thirds <b>as</b> <b>tall</b> as the first, {{and there is no}} midline ridge running between them. The pelvic fins are broad and slightly larger than the anal fin. The anal fin has a strong notch in the trailing margin and is positioned slightly behind the second dorsal fin. The caudal peduncle bears a crescent-shaped notch at the upper origin of the caudal fin. The asymmetrical caudal fin has a well-developed lower lobe and a long, narrow upper lobe with a ventral notch near the tip. The prominent lateral line curves downward below the second dorsal fin. The skin is densely covered by small, overlapping dermal denticles; each bears five horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth. This species is light grey to bronze above, darkening at the tips of the second dorsal fin and upper caudal fin lobe (though this may be indistinct in larger sharks), and pale below. The underside is off-white, and the first dorsal fin has a pale trailing margin.|$|E
5|$|The Temple of Awilix is on {{the east}} side of the plaza. Awilix was the patron goddess of the Nijaib lineage and is {{identified}} with Ixbalanque, one of the Hero Twins from the Popul Vuh. According to a drawing made by Rivera y Maestre, the temple of Awilix was not <b>as</b> <b>tall</b> as the temple of Tohil. This structure was apparently the second most important temple in Q'umarkaj. Originally this temple was formed of a large rectangular platform supporting a smaller platform and a temple structure {{on the east side}}. A wide stairway climbed the west side of the temple, it was flanked on the lower level by two large talud-tablero panels. The exterior stonework of the building has been completely stripped away. The temple is similar in form to a temple mound on the west side of the first plaza in Iximche, the postclassic capital of the Kaqchikel Maya. There were four principal phases of construction and there is evidence that the temple had been repaired various times prior to the Conquest. The floor under the third phase of construction had been painted dark green. Archaeological investigations found fragments of incense burners underneath the first building phase.|$|E
50|$|Rising to {{a height}} of 579 ft, 100 North Tampa stands <b>as</b> the <b>tallest</b> {{building}} in Tampa. The 42-story tower also stands <b>as</b> the <b>tallest</b> building {{in the state of}} Florida outside Miami and Jacksonville and the tallest structure along Florida's Gulf Coast. 100 North Tampa is overall the ninth-tallest building in Florida.|$|R
5000|$|John Philpott (born 3 April 1949) is a British actor. Philpott is {{best known}} to American audiences {{for his role as}} Courage in The Bugaloos (1970). As he shared the same first name <b>as</b> <b>taller</b> co-star John McIndoe, Philpott was {{referred}} to as [...] "Little John" [...] to differentiate between the two actors.|$|R
