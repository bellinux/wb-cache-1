5|$|By 1961, MIT had {{acquired}} the DEC PDP-1 minicomputer, {{the successor to}} the TX-0, which also used a vector display system.

In 1961-62, Harvard and MIT employees Martin Graetz, Steve Russell, and Wayne Wiitanen created the game Spacewar! on the PDP-1, inspired by science fiction books such as the Lensman series. The game was copied to several of the early minicomputer installations in American <b>academic</b> <b>institutions,</b> making it potentially the first video game to be available outside a single research institute.|$|E
