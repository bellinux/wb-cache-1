5|$|Taking a {{page out}} of Chazz Palminteri's A Bronx Tale, Rosenbaum ignored the script during his final scene with Kristin Kreuk {{for the season}} six finale. Here, as Lana is informing Lex that {{she is going to}} leave, Lex walks around her <b>and</b> <b>closes</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to her exit. Rosenbaum was trying to invoke a moment of fright for the {{audience}}. To the actor, he wanted the audience to wonder what Lex was going to do to Lana; it was a moment meant to show just how unpredictable Lex can be.|$|E
5|$|At 16, {{the aging}} Lad befriends Sonya, a seven-year-old girl whose father {{works at the}} Place. Her father forces her to assist him with his work, then brutally mistreats her if she is slow. The Master and the Place's {{superintendent}} try to quell the behavior, with no success. During a walk with the girl, Lad protects her from her father. The next day, while the Master and Mistress are at a show and the other workers are off on holiday, Sonya's father starts to beat her for accidentally dropping a heavy basket. Lad comes to her rescue and they retreat to the veranda where she pets him while he sleeps. When Sonya goes to the barn, her father is waiting for her <b>and</b> <b>closes</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b> Somehow she senses Lad beside her, which gives her the courage {{to stand up to}} her father. The man imagines he sees Lad beside her and runs away in fear. Unknown to both, Lad had died in his sleep and the Master and Mistress were crying over his body on the veranda.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens in}} a deserted, {{destroyed}} school hallway with Lee's character shown {{sitting on the}} ground. As the first verse begins, he slowly begins {{to stand up and}} makes his way through the hallway. The boy then sees a female teacher in a classroom who's stricken with fear <b>and</b> <b>closes</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> realizing that the boy is the cause of the damage. As the boy makes his way outside the school building, a police car arrives and the teacher rushes outside to tell the policeman about the boy, who then quickly rides a bicycle home to pack his things. While at home, he sees a news report about the incident, causing him to quickly gather his things to flee. Several policemen then appear outside {{the front door of the}} boy's house, while he tries to escape through the back door. The boy realizes that the door is locked so he uses his telekinetic powers to grab the keys from the kitchen bench. The policemen then enter the house to find that the boy has escaped, but find a teddy bear and a plush frog floating in the air. The final scene shows the boy running away from a SWAT team in the woods. The boy is caught by one of the men who pushes him to the ground. The video ends with the boy using his supernatural powers once again to push the men away in a burst of power; this references how the boy destroyed the school in the first place, as he's in the same position he was in at the beginning of the video. The aftermath of the outburst in the end, however, remains unknown.|$|E

25|$|During {{the filming}} of The Bread and Alley in 1970, Kiarostami had major {{differences}} with his experienced cinematographer about how to film {{the boy and the}} attacking dog. While the cinematographer wanted separate shots of the boy approaching, a close-up of his hand as he enters the house <b>and</b> <b>closes</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> followed by a shot of the dog, Kiarostami believed that if the three scenes could be captured as a whole it would have a more profound impact in creating tension over the situation. That one shot took around forty days to complete, until Kiarostami was fully content with the scene. Kiarostami later commented that the breaking of scenes would have disrupted the rhythm and content of the film's structure, preferring to let the scene flow as one.|$|E

500|$|The {{scene where}} Cruise enters the closet is {{referenced}} in the South Park {{segment of the}} opening of the 58th Primetime Emmy Awards on August 27, 2006, in which Conan O'Brien is {{trying to get to the}} show, but suddenly appears in Stan's room in an animated form. Stan begins yelling at him as he runs into the nearby closet. Immediately following the entrance, he exits the closet and says, [...] "There's someone else in there", referring to Cruise, and leaves the door open. Cruise then pops out <b>and</b> <b>closes</b> <b>the</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Another {{scene that}} was in {{an earlier version of}} the script had young George visiting his father at his work. After George tells off Mr. Potter <b>and</b> <b>closes</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> he {{considers}} asking Uncle Billy about his drugstore dilemma. Billy is talking on the phone to the bank examiner, and lights his cigar and throws his match in the wastebasket. This scene explains that Tilly (short for Matilda) and Eustace are both his cousins (not Billy's kids though), and Tilly is on the phone with her friend Martha and says, [...] "Potter's here, the bank examiner's coming. It's a day of judgment." [...] As George is about to interrupt Tilly on the phone, Billy cries for help and Tilly runs in and puts the fire out with a pot of coffee. George decides he is probably better off dealing with the situation by himself.|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Warrington did not know, to be sure, that to send such {{a message}} to the parson was as if he said, [...] "I am fallen amongst the lions. Come down, my dear friend, into the pit with me." [...] Harry very likely thought Sampson's {{difficulties}} were over; or, more likely still, was so much engrossed with his own affairs and perplexities, as to bestow little thought upon his neighbour's. Having sent off his missive, the captive's mind was somewhat more at ease, and he condescended to call for breakfast, which was brought to him presently. The attendant who served him with his morning repast asked him whether he would order dinner, or take his meal at Mrs. Bailiff's table with some other gentlemen? No. Mr. Warrington would not order dinner. He should quit the place before dinner-time, he informed the chamberlain who waited on him in that grim tavern. The man went away, thinking no doubt that {{this was not the first}} young gentleman who had announced that he was going away ere two hours were over. [...] "Well, if your honour does stay, there is good beef and carrot at two o'clock," [...] says the sceptic, <b>and</b> <b>closes</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> on Mr. Harry and his solitary meditations.|$|E
