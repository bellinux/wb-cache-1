5000|$|Jardine won the toss {{and chose}} to bat. Clem Hill remarked to Jardine {{that it should}} be a close game, but Jardine joked that he {{obviously}} had not seen who had won the toss. There had been rain on the day before the match and moisture was still present when Sutcliffe and Jardine went out to bat, which made the pitch difficult for batting that morning. Australia had played three spinners, so leg spinner O'Reilly took the new ball with the solitary paceman Tim Wall. The fourth ball, from Wall, bounced unexpectedly and hit Sutcliffe's shoulder, to the crowd's pleasure. After twenty minutes play, England had scored just four runs when Jardine was bowled off his pads trying to glance a swinging delivery from Wall. Hammond came in and looked uncomfortable as Wall bowled some short-pitched deliveries. He had to duck underneath one ball and departed after slashing wildly at a quick delivery and with the score at 16, he was caught by Wicket-keeper Bert Oldfield, standing further back than usual, diving across in front of first slip. Umpire George Hele believed Hammond may have deliberately got out. Jardine believed the ball had bounced lower than usual. As he walked off, disturbed by the frequency of short bowling, Hammond was heard to say [...] "If that's what the bloody game's coming to, I've had enough of it." [...] A second wicket fell without a run added as Sutcliffe, after 46 minutes batting, played a weak shot and hit O'Reilly in the <b>air.</b> <b>Wall,</b> at short square leg, dived forward to take a one-handed catch. Les Ames, who was in poor batting form, also looked uncomfortable. He batted unconvincingly for 39 minutes for three runs and did not score for 20 minutes; in that time, he edged the ball several times and was bowled by a no ball from O'Reilly. Just as it appeared he was settling down, he was bowled by a faster ball from left arm orthodox spinner Bert Ironmonger. England's score was four wickets for 30 runs (4/30). The crowd were delighted by the course of the morning session; England had not expected to lose so many wickets so quickly and Hedley Verity and Gubby Allen, both due to bat lower in the order, were seen rushing to the dressing room to change in case they were needed to bat quickly. Maurice Leyland and Bob Wyatt took England to lunch without losing any more wickets and the score was 4/37 after 90 minutes play.|$|E

40|$|Optimization of the {{performance}} of industrial combustion systems is relying increasingly on computational models and simulations to provide relevant process information in a cost-effective manner. Although computational fluid dynamics (CFD) offers a cost-effective alternative to experiments, the accuracy of the CFD models must first be assured. This is accomplished by two means: verification and validation. This paper describes a benchmark case suitable for validation of multiphase combustion models and submodels. The benchmark includes a reference spray combustor to provide well-defined input and boundary conditions, enabling measurements to characterize the fuel spray, combustion <b>air,</b> <b>wall</b> temperatures, exhaust gas temperatures and species concentrations. The characteristics (i. e., size, velocity, volume flux, etc.) of the methanol spray were determined using phase Doppler interferometry. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy was used to measure species concentrations in the reactor exhaust and the conversion of methanol. The inlet combustion air was characterized using particle image velocimetry and a five-hole pitot probe. The measurements constitute a database sufficiently complete for code validation; subsequently, several research groups have carried out simulations of the facility to varying degrees of success.

40|$|Reference is {{increasingly}} being made towards {{the need for}} the world to find new and renewable forms of energy, especially for electric power generation, but also for space heating and the heating of water. Solar energy is one of the cheapest forms of renewable energy available and is so far one of the most underutilised resources. One contribution makes reference to the way forward as being â€˜using concentrating solar power which uses parabolic mirrors to focus the solar heat (energy) and generate steam to drive electric generatorsâ€™ as is currently happening in the utility power marketplace in the USA. This thesis deals with the issues surrounding the original development of a two axis solar energy tracking system (SET) in 1997. The subsequent redesign, development and upgrade, undertaken from 2002 to 2006, with its performance and efficiency being measured in 2006 and 2007 using a specially configured measurement and recording system. A Solar Energy Tracker (SET) is designed to track the sun moving in two axes, reflecting the solar radiation received on its mirrors to a target mounted {{at the end of a}} boom, at the focal point of the mirrors. In late 2005 and early 2006, a solar thermal hot water manufacturer and installer heard about the developments and requested some form of involvement, especially if Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology (CPIT) provided research input and assisted in the further development and testing of solar thermal hot water systems. This sponsor offered two projects in 2006 and again in 2007. Other solar thermal hot water suppliers also requested involvement in the research and development being performed at CPIT, which led in August 2006, December 2006, June 2007 and December 2007, to a number of other solar thermal hot water and <b>air</b> <b>wall</b> systems being installed. Progressively, the roof of C block at CPIT has become full of solar thermal hot water systems and solar <b>air</b> <b>wall</b> systems, both of the conventional type and those with newer technologies at the core of their development. This thesis outlines the stages in the redesign and development of the SET, and the various stages in its testing, development and refinement up to its present form. The thesis chapters are written based around the mechanical and electrical design, the auto-tracking and daylight controls, the PLC (programmable logic controller) controller, the mirror and substrate testing, the SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) system, the testing and comparison with other domestic solar thermal hot water systems and finally the testing of the SET itself. It also details the future developments and outlines possible uses for the SET in its redefined form. With clean and polished mirrors the SET has proven itself capable of achieving a temperature rise across the target of 15 Â°C at a flow rate of 4 l/m. On some occasions this temperature rise can be in excess of 20 Â°C, but testing thus far, has shown this cannot be sustained for any worthwhile period of time (15 - 30 minutes). This translates to an efficiency of 5 - 10 % when related to an energy produced per twenty four hour time period. However, if the efficiency is calculated for the actual period of generation, â€˜generation efficiency,â€™ then this figure rises to 24 %. An overview is given of associated solar thermal hot water and solar <b>air</b> <b>wall</b> system research and development (that is ongoing at CPIT) as well as the performance and efficiency graphs for the solar thermal hot water systems on test. No manufacturerâ€™s, industry or brand trade names are mentioned, as this research is still confidential and commercially sensitive. However, the technology involved and characterised by each solar thermal system is recorded in a generic sense. The SET was originally developed with the purpose of heating hot water and today this is still the intent. The possible applications for this hot water are many and varied from electricity generation, space heating and further into developing or new industrial processes. The performances of the other domestic solar thermal hot water systems currently under test, are compared with the figures from the SET, with the maximum efficiency, presently available, being from an evacuated tube heat pipe system at up to 65 %, whereas traditional finned flat plate technologies have efficiencies after twelve months of up to 48 %...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{aimed at}} {{evaluating}} if essential oils misted in broiler houses reduce environmental fungi counts. The investigation {{was conducted in}} three experimental rooms, where broiler chickens were reared between 1 to 42 d of age. Every three days, the rooms were fogged with pure water (control) or with aqueous solutions of peppermint or thyme oils. On the next day, fogging samples from the air, flat surfaces, and litter were collected and quantitatively and qualitatively analysed for fungal contamination. The treatment with essential oils showed promising results. In the room fogged with thyme oil, aerial fungi growth was not as evident as in the control room, and presented the lowest average fungi count. Thyme oil was also the most effective in reducing fungi colonization on drinker surfaces and litter. The use of peppermint oil also reduced the population of <b>air,</b> <b>wall,</b> surface and litter fungi, although some exceptions were noted. Aspergillus, Penicillium, Fusarium and Saccharomyces genera were identified most frequently. The effect of essential oils was noticeable {{in the last two}} weeks, when the counts of Aspergillus sp. were 75 % (thyme oil) and 46 % (peppermint oil) lower in comparison with the control group. The results show that fogging broiler houses with essential oils may be an effective prevention method against fungal aerosol in broiler houses. However, further investigations to determine the synergistic effect of different oils and their compounds, and the best possible doses and methods of application in the field are needed...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{develop a}} CT-based {{prediction}} score for anastomotic leakage after esophagectomy {{and compare it}} to subjective CT interpretation. METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent a CT scan for a clinical suspicion of anastomotic leakage after esophagectomy with cervical anastomosis between 2003 and 2014 were analyzed. The CT scans were systematically re-evaluated by two radiologists {{for the presence of}} specific CT findings and presence of an anastomotic leak. Also, the original CT interpretations were acquired. These results were compared to patients with and without a clinical confirmed leak. RESULTS: Out of 122 patients that underwent CT for a clinical suspicion of anastomotic leakage; 54 had a confirmed leak. In multivariable analysis, anastomotic leakage was associated with mediastinal fluid (OR[*]=[*] 3. 4), esophagogastric wall discontinuity (OR[*]=[*] 4. 9), mediastinal air (OR[*]=[*] 6. 6), and a fistula (OR[*]=[*] 7. 2). Based on these criteria, a prediction score was developed resulting in an area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 0. 86, sensitivity of 80 %, and specificity of 84 %. The original interpretation and the systematic subjective CT assessment by two radiologists resulted in AUCs of 0. 68 and 0. 75 with sensitivities of 52 % and 69 %, and specificities of 84 % and 82 %, respectively. CONCLUSION: This CT-based score may provide improved diagnostic performance for diagnosis of anastomotic leakage after esophagectomy. KEY POINTS: â€¢ A CT-based score provides improved diagnostic performance for diagnosis of anastomotic leakage. â€¢ Leakage associations include mediastinal fluid, mediastinal <b>air,</b> <b>wall</b> discontinuity, and fistula. â€¢ A scoring system yields superior diagnostic accuracy compared to subjective CT assessment. â€¢ Radiologists may suggest presence of anastomotic leakage based on a prediction score...|$|E

We have investigated daylighting, cross-ventilation, solar preheat of ventilation air, air-to-air heat exchanger, electric lighting controls, and down-sizing HVAC systems as strategies to improve energy performance. We were able to improve energy performance with no increase in first cost in all climates examined. Two papers and a full report on Phase I of this study are available. The work described in this report is from the second phase of the project. In the first phase we redesigned the basic modular classroom to incorporate energy strategies including daylighting, cross-ventilation, solar preheating of ventilation air, and insulation. We also explored thermal mass but determined that it was not a cost-effective strategy in the five climates we examined. Energy savings ranged from 6 % to 49 % with an average of 23 %. Paybacks ranged from 1. 3 years to 23. 8 years, an average of 12. 1 years. In Phase II the number of baseline buildings was expanded by simulating buildings that would be typical of those produced by Modern Building Systems, Inc.

We also used computational fluid dynamics software to determine air distribution from cross-ventilation and used the resulting interior wind speeds to calculate occupant comfort and allowable outside air temperatures for cross-ventilation...|$|E
5000|$|One common way to {{extinguish}} a fire is to spray it with water.

This leaves the fire without enough of the combustive agent, and it dies out. The vaporization of water also absorbs heat; it thereby cools the smoke, <b>air,</b> <b>walls,</b> and objects that could act as further fuel, and thus prevents one of {{the means by which}} fires grow, which is by [...] "jumping" [...] to nearby heat/fuel sources to start new fires, which then combine.

40|$|This {{research}} project looks for to innovate {{in the management}} of expanded plastic materials wastes and to propose techniques that take advantage of the properties that those plastics still have at the time they are discarded to the urban wastes flow, such is the case of the expanded polystyrene wastes (EPS) which after being transformed in small particles and mixed with pastes made of standard gypsum and water in diverse proportions allows the production of different construction products. At the end of this paper two specific mixtures are described; the first useful for gypsum wallboard production, and the second one to manufacture a flat board for thermal isolation material. The EPS is a stiff cell plastic material produced from the molding of little spheres or pearls of expansible polystyrene that shows a closed structure made of this thermoplastic which contains trapped air in a 96 - 98 % proportion of the volume of the pearls. Packaging {{is one of the main}} applications for this material hence EPS is a plenty waste in our society, it is also very popular in building construction where it is installed in <b>air</b> <b>wall</b> cameras and indoors covers; finally in a small proportion the plastic has other kind of applications like sport protections and commercial display.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this report was done in order to design a pressurized test facility for droplet analysis with a laser measurement technique, Phase Doppler Anemometry. The test facility was a development work within Chemrec's pressurized black liquor gasification (BLG) project. BLG is a complex process where black liquor is atomized and sprayed into a reactor and gasified using pure oxygen. In the process {{it is crucial that}} all organic material is consumed to produce combustible gases using three stages of conversion: drying, pyrolysis and char gasification. In the end of the conversion, only an inorganic smelt is supposed to remain (ideally). For the gasification process, {{it is important to be}} fully aware of the spray characteristics created by the nozzle that yields an ideal conversion. Therefore a pressurized spray test facility with optical access windows for measurements was developed. Parameters that are important and interesting to study are droplet size and their velocity. The purpose of the facility is to gain quantitative information to optimize the black liquor gasification (BLG) process. For measuring droplets, a non-intrusive laser measurements system is used called Phase Doppler Anemometry (PDA). PDA is the most advantageous technique for measuring droplet velocity and size distribution. The first stage in the work of developing this spray test facility was a brief feasibility study of other pressurized spray testing facilities using PDA, to get information of different concepts. Concepts and configurations of the different parts for the pressurized test facility have been analyzed and investigated with a variety of engineering tools. Because measurements with PDA are very depending on certain receiving angles a deep review of PDA was performed, all to achieve correct placement of the transmitting and receiving optical access windows. The final design resulted in a standing pressure vessel with height 5600 mm and a diameter of 500 mm. The test facility was tested and is approved for a working pressure of 15 bar. To prevent corrosion due to the future application of black liquor atomization, it was made of stainless steel (SS 2343). Four optical access side ports were placed approximately 500 mm from the top of the vessel. The side port for the transmitter probe is located at 0 degrees and the three receiving side ports at 106. 3, 120 and 270 degrees. These angles were chosen to fulfill the requirements and demands essential for PDA. Simulations using CFD have contributed with useful information for the flow behavior inside the vessel and how droplets are affected by it. These simulations gave information about the flow near the optical access side ports and the necessity of optical clearance. The simulations show that recirculated flow carries droplets from the spray that reaches the glass windows, which is not preferable as it may interfere during laser measurements. Initial test runs and experiments confirm the results obtained from the simulations. The outcome of this study became a development of a purging <b>air</b> <b>wall</b> to prevent droplets reaching the glass windows. Fine polished fused quartz glass, especially suitable for laser measurements is used for the glass windows. These glasses are free from inclusions and are distinguished from other glasses by good transmission in UV- and the visible spectral range. A solid mechanic calculation of the glass specimen was performed to determine the thickness of the glass in order to withstand a maximum pressure of 15 bar. An evacuation port was placed in the middle of the vessel to perform evacuation of gas. The evacuation is used for both atmospheric and pressurized conditions. During pressurized runs, a flange lid with a pressure control valve can be attached to this side port to regulate the pressure. Connections for adding a fluid level gauge were placed on the vessel side. On the top of the vessel a unique designed spray lance traversing system were attached on a flange lid. With this arrangement the spray can be rotated and traversed up and down through the top lid. This device enables measurements in a large part of the spray. The test facility has been installed and initial test runs performed. Measuring and optimization of the facility will continue. When optimized, the results of the measurements from this facility will be applied in the BLG project. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to develop a three-dimensional transient heat, mass, momentum and species transfer model using the finite element method to predict grain temperature, moisture content, interstitial air velocity and gas (fumigant, CO 2) concentration in the stored grain mass. The physical, chemical and biological processes for stored grain ecosystems were represented as partial differential governing equations (PDE). Effects of boundary conditions including solar radiation, internal heat generated by insects and molds, and wind speed and direction on the ecosystems are three dimensional. Thus, two-dimensional ecosystem models developed by various researches are not adequate. Dry matter loss (DML) and insect population were calculated as post-processing using the predicted grain temperature and moisture content. ^ The developed 3 D stored grain ecosystem model was validated using data collected in two locations: PHERC Bin 12 at Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN for corn and the SPREC bin at Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK for wheat. Different combinations of models such as conduction, convection and internal heat generation were studied along with linear and quadratic elements. The conduction plus convection model predicted grain temperatures that closely followed the observed grain temperatures during the non-aeration period. The standard error of prediction was in the range of 0. 9 - 3. 6 Â°C for wheat and 1. 0 - 3. 1 Â°C for corn. The predicted and observed grain moisture contents varied with an error of 0. 1 - 1. 28 %. ^ Validation of the 3 D model required formulation of improved headspace, plenum and wall models into systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using energy and mass balance principles which were solved by the Fourth Order Runga Kutta Method. There were nine headspace air temperatures and relative humidities, nine plenum air temperatures and relative humidities and forty eight wall temperatures formulated which is unique compared to published literature. The predicted headspace <b>air,</b> <b>wall</b> and roof temperatures, the plenum air and wall temperatures and the grain mass wall temperatures closely followed the trend of observed values with acceptable standard error of prediction. ^ The developed 3 D stored grain ecosystem model was applied to study the effect of non-uniform airflow in cored, leveled and peaked grain mass configurations. Non-uniform airflow distribution was evaluated using the finite volume method for constant and variable porosities and airflow rates of 1. 1 m 3 /min. t (natural air drying air) and 0. 11 m 3 /min. t (aeration). For cored, leveled and peaked grain mass configurations, a variable porosity range of 0. 34 in the core and 0. 38 towards the bin wall predicted air velocity with reasonable accuracy. The 3 D heat and momentum transfer in cored, leveled and peaked grain mass configurations was evaluated for an airflow rate of 0. 11 m 3 /min. t. The change in grain temperature in the cored grain mass configuration was the fastest followed by the leveled and peaked configurations. For the peaked cone region, the model predicted a delay in the cooling front of 59 hours versus the cored configuration. ^ The developed 3 D stored grain ecosystem model was also applied to study aeration strategies for wheat bulk storage in the sub-tropical climate of North India. Five years of weather data were analyzed using the Modified Chung-Pfost equation for wheat. Six aeration strategies were formulated based on the sub-tropical weather conditions of North India and combinations of the following parameters: temperature control; EMC control; 1 h, 2 h or 4 h morning and/or evening aeration; and 0. 11 m 3 /min/t airflow rate. The initial grain temperature was assumed as 27 Â°C and the initial grain moisture as 12 % (w. b.) based on typical harvest conditions. Dry matter loss, insect development, fan run hours, average grain temperature and moisture content for these aeration strategies were quantified based on weather data from 2000 - 01 to 2004 - 05. Strategy 13 was selected as the best aeration strategy based on optimum combination of low values of DML, insect development, grain temperature, moisture content, and fan run hours. This strategy consisted of aerating wheat with EMC-based fan control independent of ambient temperature, an airflow rate of 0. 11 m 3 /min/t and allowable operating windows of 4 hours in the morning and evening during the maintenance period, and with EMC and temperature-based fan control during the cooling period {{at any time during the}} day or night. The results of both 2 D and 3 D models were compared for different strategies. Both models predicted Strategy 13 as the optimum strategy for North Indian conditions. ^ As a result of this dissertation research the 3 D PHAST-FEM (Post-Harvest Aeration Simulation Tool - Finite Element Method) model was developed, validated and applied. The model is sufficiently accurate and robust that it could be used as a decision support tool for effective stored grain quality management. (Abstract shortened by ProQuest.) ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), {{the impacts}} of indoor {{emissions}} either at home or at the workplace are often not taken into account. The presented model aims to determine the fate and the exposure of indoor chemical emissions {{in a room with}} carpet and furniture. The intake Fraction (iF) which quantifies the fraction of an emission which is taken in by an entire population, has been chosen here as a metric to describe the fate and exposure of pollutants emitted indoors. The developed model accounts for air renewal, degradation in the gas-phase, degradation on surfaces, and finally partition between <b>air,</b> <b>walls</b> and furniture assuming a kinetically limited material transfer between gas-phase and a near-surface film. The model reveals that surface removal can affect the gas-phase concentrations of several chemicals in a relevant manner. Furthermore, typical calculated indoor iF values are in the range of 2. 5 x 10 - 4 to 1 x 10 - 2 which is patently higher than outdoor values (1 x 10 - 9 to 1 x 10 - 6) ...|$|R
50|$|October 2007 brought {{another new}} {{addition}} to the Aquarium - CURRENTS: The Ballroom at Adventure Aquarium. Filling nearly 9000 sq ft of space in the Aquarium's North Building (which was originally intended for lease to a private restaurant brand), CURRENTS is built with special events in mind, appealing to those who may have found the Aquarium's exhibit design too cumbersome to host their various functions. Fitted with state-of-the-art audio-visual technology, two <b>air</b> <b>walls</b> that can split the room into three smaller spaces, and three movie-screen sized windows into the Shark Realm exhibit, CURRENTS has quickly become a popular alternative to established banquet facilities throughout the region. All functions in the room are catered by ARAMARK, whose culinary team created a series of menus exclusively for ballroom events. The facility has a capacity of 550 for seated meals, and more than 1200 for cocktail receptions. In an {{attempt to create a}} unified brand, Steiner Entertainment commissioned a ballroom for its Newport Aquarium, also named CURRENTS, which opened there in July 2007.|$|R
40|$|Neonatal chronic {{lung disease}} is {{characterized}} by failed formation of alveoli and capillaries, and excessive deposition of matrix elastin, which are linked to lengthy mechanical ventilation (MV) with O 2 -rich gas. Vitamin A supplementation has improved respiratory outcome of premature infants, {{but there is little}} information about the structural and molecular manifestations in the lung that occur with vitamin A treatment. We hypothesized that vitamin A supplementation during prolonged MV, without confounding by antenatal steroid treatment, would improve alveolar secondary septation, decrease thickness of the mesenchymal tissue cores between distal <b>air</b> space <b>walls,</b> and increase alveolar capillary growth. We further hypothesized that these structural advancements would be associated with modulated expression of tropoelastin and deposition of matrix elastin, phosphorylated Smad 2 (pSmad 2), cleaved caspase 3, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), VEGF, VEGF-R 2, and midkine in the parenchyma of the immature lung. Eight preterm lambs (125 days' gestation, term âˆ¼ 150 days) were managed by MV for 3 wk: four were treated with daily intramuscular Aquasol A (vitamin A), 5, 000 IU/kg, starting at birth; four received vehicle alone. Postmortem lung assays included quantitative RT-PCR and in situ hybridization, immunoblot and immunohistochemistry, and morphometry and stereology. Daily vitamin A supplementation increased alveolar secondary septation, decreased thickness of the mesenchymal tissue cores between the distal <b>air</b> space <b>walls,</b> and increased alveolar capillary growth. Associated molecular changes were less tropoelastin mRNA expression, matrix elastin deposition, pSmad 2, and PCNA protein localization in the mesenchymal tissue core of the distal <b>air</b> space <b>walls.</b> On the other hand, mRNA expression and protein abundance of VEGF, VEGF-R 2, midkine, and cleaved caspase 3 were increased. We conclude that vitamin A treatment partially improves lung development in chronically ventilated preterm neonates by modulating expression of tropoelastin, deposition of elastin, and expression of vascular growth factors...|$|R
