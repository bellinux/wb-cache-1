40|$|Aviation {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{regulated}} industries in the world. The massive expansion and growth of aviation in the South-East Asia region has brought up many challenges in ensuring <b>airworthiness</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft,</b> both in the civil and military aviation domain. These challenges not only affect the safe operations of aircraft but also result in various issues in the areas of cost, infrastructure, human capital and resources. From the point of view of civil aviation, local authorities in the region have taken several initiatives to tackle these challenges, based on the foundations laid out by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). When it comes to military aviation, agencies, such as the Directorate General Technical Airworthiness (DGTA) of Malaysia, have initiated the regulation of the compliance of military aircraft operations. There has also been an increased focus on awareness of the importance of airworthiness and safety as well as the development of a risk-based approach which is both proactive and cost-efficient...|$|E
40|$|The {{economic}} crisis {{has affected the}} airline industry {{as much as it}} has affected all other industries in the world. The small airlines and maintenance organisations must find new opportunities and options in order to survive the harsh crisis. Priority Aero Maintenance is now an approved maintenance organisation performing maintenance on aircrafts, engines and components. The company sees economic gains in the future by becoming an approved organisation that follows the European Aviation Safety Agency guidelines (EASA) and meets the requirements outlined in the rules of Part-M. In order for the company to become an approved organization, responsible for continuing <b>airworthiness</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft,</b> a handbook should be presented to the local authority. This handbook describes the company’s responsibility for the continuing airworthiness in order for the authorities to get an insight into the company and its work.

The CAME will in the future be used by the company as a basis for developing a more detailed manual to be presented to and approved by the Swedish Aviation Authority (Transportstyrelsen) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Clustering {{of cloud}} microphysical conditions, such as {{liquid water content}} (LWC) and drop size, can affect the rate and shape of ice {{accretion}} and the <b>airworthiness</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft.</b> Clustering may also degrade the accuracy of cloud LWC measurements from radars and microwave radiometers being developed by the government for remotely mapping icing conditions ahead of aircraft in flight. This paper evaluates spatial clustering of LWC in icing clouds using measurements collected during NASA research flights in the Great Lakes region. We used graphical and analytical approaches to describe clustering. The analytical approach involves determining the average size of clusters and computing a clustering intensity parameter. We analyzed flight data composed of 1 -s-frequency LWC measurements for 12 periods ranging from 17. 4 minutes (73 km) to 45. 3 minutes (190 km) in duration. Graphically some flight segments showed evidence of consistency with regard to clustering patterns. Cluster intensity varied from 0. 06, indicating little clustering, {{to a high of}} 2. 42. Cluster lengths ranged from 0. 1 minutes (0. 6 km) to 4. 1 minutes (17. 3 km). Additional analyses will allow us to determine if clustering climatologies can be developed to characterize cluster conditions by region, time period, or weather condition. Introductio...|$|E
