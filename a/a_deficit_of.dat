5|$|Alfonsín {{began his}} term with many {{economic}} problems. The foreign debt was nearly 43billion dollars {{by the end}} of the year, and the country had narrowly prevented a sovereign default in 1982.

It also appeared unlikely that the country would receive the needed foreign investment. The country had <b>a</b> <b>deficit</b> <b>of</b> $6.7billion. Possible solutions such as a devaluation of the currency, privatization of industry, or restrictions on imports, would probably have proven to be unpopular.|$|E
5|$|During the heats, the Australian team of Brooks, Fasala, Delany and Stockwell {{showed their}} {{intention}} to deny the Americans the gold {{for the first time}} at Olympic level.

Brooks led off in the heat, setting a time of 50.36s, before Stockwell made up <b>a</b> <b>deficit</b> <b>of</b> 0.41s during the anchor leg to beat the hosts by 0.20s. Australia and the United States had stamped their authority on the event, qualifying almost four seconds faster than third-placed Sweden.

The English batsmen progressed and Johnston had one confident appeal for lbw against Compton, but there were few scares.|$|E

In 1973, the service was reduced {{as a result of}} the oil crisis, which lasted until 1 March 1974. Smoking indoors was banned from 1975, and a new quay was built in Levanger and opened on 1 July 1976. Local disagreement about the location of a new quay on Ytterøy delayed construction, and it did not open until 1981. In 1974, planning for a new ferry on the Ytterøy service started, although the order was not placed until June 1979. The new ferry, Ytterøy, cost NOK10.5 million, had space for 30 cars and was bi-directional. It was put into service in February 1981. Innherredsferja II was kept as a reserve.|$|E

Coleman had previously co-founded Actor's Express in Atlanta, Georgia, and was the {{artistic director}} there. Coleman initially signed on for a three-year contract. Before Coleman began as artistic director with PCS, the company was already the largest live theater production company in Portland. However, the organization was facing sporadic attendance at performances as well as financial difficulties, with a deficit {{at the end of}} 1999 of $700,000. In 2000 PCS had <b>a</b> <b>deficit</b> <b>of</b> $880,000 and a base of 10,000 subscribers.

5|$|Moncoutié all but {{clinched}} his mountains classification triumph {{on stage}} 15. While he finished nine minutes behind Cobo on Angliru, {{he won the}} day's second climb to score ten mountain points and increase his lead over Montaguti to 22 points. He scored his final mountain classification points on stage 17, ending {{with a total of}} 63. Montaguti nearly reclaimed the jersey on stage 18, when he made a breakaway and Moncoutié did not. Fortunately for Moncoutié, teammate Sijmens had made the escape group and kept Montaguti from maximum points on four of the five climbs. Given that riders who are not involved in a classification nor have teammates that are will generally not ride against someone who is, Sijmens' presence in this breakway was effectively the only way Moncoutié could have retained the jersey. Moncoutié continued to lead Montaguti, by a score of 63-56. Neither rider scored again, and Moncoutié won his fourth consecutive mountains title, a first in Vuelta history. He was the team's best overall finisher as well, but was not any real threat, coming in 37th overall at <b>a</b> <b>deficit</b> <b>of</b> over an hour to Cobo. Taaramäe, for his part, did not complete the Vuelta, abandoning on stage 17.|$|E
5|$|Odense Municipality is the {{administrative}} unit which covers {{not only the}} city of Odense but surrounding suburbs and villages.

The city council's motto is At lege er at leve (Playing is living) summarising a new approach addressing learning, innovation, development and growth with targets for 2017.
