[...] The school is also a fitting legacy for Blessed Edmund Rice and the efforts of the Christian Brothers.|$|E
2500|$|She {{was young}} and tall of stature, clad in a garment of deep blue, ... Her dress was covered with {{brilliant}} gold stars. The sleeves were ample and long. She wore slippers of the same blue as the dress, ornamented with gold bows. On the head was a black veil half covering the forehead, concealing the hair and ears, and falling over the shoulders. Above this was a crown resembling a diadem, higher in front than elsewhere, and widening out at the sides. A red line encircled the crown at the middle. Her hands were small and extended toward us as in the 'miraculous medal.' Her face had the most exquisite delicacy and <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>of</b> ineffable sweetness. The eyes, of unutterable tenderness, were fixed on us. Like a true mother, she seemed happier in looking at us than we in contemplating.|$|E
2500|$|Smith was {{described}} by several of his contemporaries and biographers as comically absent-minded, with peculiar habits of speech and gait, and <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>of</b> [...] "inexpressible benignity". He was known to talk to himself, a habit that began during his childhood when he would smile in rapt conversation with invisible companions. He also had occasional spells of imaginary illness, and he {{is reported to have}} had books and papers placed in tall stacks in his study. According to one story, Smith took Charles Townshend on a tour of a tanning factory, and while discussing free trade, Smith walked into a huge tanning pit from which he needed help to escape. He is also said to have put bread and butter into a teapot, drunk the concoction, and declared it to be the worst cup of tea he ever had. According to another account, Smith distractedly went out walking in his nightgown and ended up [...] outside of town, before nearby church bells brought him back to reality.|$|E
