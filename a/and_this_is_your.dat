Writers with a more historic Lutheran and Reformed perspective have typically interpreted this word as meaning a belief in God and Christ, and trust in Christ for salvation with faith that he will save you. <b>This</b> interpretation <b>is</b> based on several passages from the Christian Bible, notably Ephesians 2:8–9, which reads, [...] "For by grace you have been saved through faith. <b>And</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> not <b>your</b> own doing; it is the gift of God, not {{as a result of}} works, so that no one may boast."

All of us once lived among them in the passions of our flesh, following the desires of flesh and senses, and we were by nature children of wrath, like everyone else. But God, who is rich in mercy, out of the great love with which he loved us even when we were dead through our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved— and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, so that in the ages to come he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. For by grace you have been saved through faith, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> not <b>your</b> own doing; it is the gift of God— not the result of works, so that no one may boast.

40|$|Before the Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT) was {{established}} by legislation in July 1974, there were several state agencies that handled the tasks that are now the responsibility of an integrated, multimodal Iowa DOT. Among those agencies was the Iowa State Highway Commission (IHC). You are invited to read {{a brief history of}} the Iowa DOT here:[URL] The IHC operated as an independent state agency between 1913 and 1974. In 1968, the IHC created <b>and</b> released <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>YOUR</b> Highway Commission, a 24 ½- minute film that showcased the responsibilities and functions of the IHC. The narrator describes the activities of various offices and employees, and explains how those activities benefited Iowa’s citizens and motorists. The film journeys through all areas of IHC responsibility to Iowa’s roadways, including administration, planning, design, bidding, right of way, materials, construction, maintenance and facilities. As part of the Iowa DOT’s effort to preserve and archive its historical resources, the original 16 mm film was professionally cleaned, restored and digitized so that it could be made available via this website. The Iowa DOT is currently researching and compiling information necessary to prepare detailed biographies of the IHC employees identified in the film. Included in each biography will be still frames taken from the film, as well as other images from the Iowa DOT’s archives. This more comprehensive description of the film will be available in the future. In the meantime, below is a list of the IHC employees who have been identified. The list is arranged in the order in which each employee first appears in the film. There remain numerous unidentified employees in the film, and the Iowa DOT would greatly appreciate any assistance in identifying them.
