25|$|The British Auxiliary Legion {{ceased to}} exist as <b>an</b> <b>useful</b> {{fighting}} force, {{with a total of}} 500 casualties, which represents two-thirds of the Legion strength. Some authors claim the execution of some 150 officers and ranks after the battle. Alexander Sommerville lists 136 deaths, 131 of them from the Scotchs and the Rifles, without distinguish between killed in action and executed. Legion surgeon Henry Wilkinson and the British press of the time differ slightly from Sommerville, with 13 officers and 143 ratings either killed in action or massacred. Others sources referred to up to 25 officers killed. The heavy casualties, together with the chronic lack of payments and supplies owed by the Spanish government and the indifference of the British Crown led to the official dissolution of the Auxiliary Legion on 10 December 1837.|$|E

60|$|This is an {{assertion}} of a fact. I go no further on the paper; though, in my private judgment, <b>an</b> <b>useful</b> representation is impossible; I am {{sure it is}} not desired by them, nor ought it, perhaps, by us: but I abstain from opinions.|$|E
30|$|We {{demonstrated}} that 2 D-DIGE analysis is <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> approach for identifying novel biomarkers of nanomaterials. Using this approach, we identified hemopexin as <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> biomarker and showed here that hemopexin {{can act as}} <b>a</b> <b>useful</b> biomarker for analyzing the biological responses associated with exposure to silica nanoparticles. We believe that this study {{will contribute to the}} development of biomarkers for ensuring the safety of silica nanoparticles.|$|R

Ruins {{in a land}} are, {{like most}} of the signs of decay in the human form, sad evidences of abuses and passions, which have hastened the inroads of time. These provinces are like yourself, my Gertrude, in their {{freshness}} and their youth, and, comparatively, in their innocence also. Let us hope for both a long, <b>an</b> <b>useful,</b> and a happy existence." ...|$|E

But at this crisis it seems useless to you to persevere in keeping up an influence which {{can no longer be}} directed to <b>an</b> <b>useful</b> purpose.

60|$|To talk, as the Greeks {{themselves}} do, {{of their}} rising again to their pristine superiority, would be ridiculous: {{as the rest}} of the world must resume its barbarism, after reasserting the sovereignty of Greece: but there seems to be no very great obstacle, except in the apathy of the Franks, to their becoming <b>an</b> <b>useful</b> dependency, or even a free state, with a proper guarantee;--under correction, however, be it spoken, for many and well-informed men doubt the practicability even of this.|$|E

"I may not, gentlemen," [...] he said, [...] "be fully {{able to go}} {{the lengths}} you desire, in {{assigning}} to those of my own religion the means of tyrannizing over others; but none shall go farther in asserting our own lawful freedom. And I must needs aver, that had others been of my mind in counsel, or disposed to stand by my side in battle, we should this evening, {{instead of being a}} defeated and discordant remnant, have sheathed our weapons in <b>an</b> <b>useful</b> and honourable peace, or brandished them triumphantly after a decisive victory." ...|$|E
60|$|But, if {{the colonies}} (to bring the general matter home to us) {{could see that}} in Great Britain {{the mass of the}} people is melted into its government, and that every dispute with the {{ministry}} must of necessity be always a quarrel with the nation, they can stand no longer in the equal and friendly relation of fellow-citizens to the subjects of this kingdom. Humble as this relation may appear to some, when it is once broken, a strong tie is dissolved. Other sort of connections will be sought. For there are very few in the world who will not prefer <b>an</b> <b>useful</b> ally to an insolent master.|$|E

60|$|When I {{seem not}} to acquiesce in the acts of those I respect in every degree short of superstition, I am obliged to give my reasons fully. I cannot set my {{authority}} against their authority. But to exert reason is not to revolt against authority. Reason and authority do not move in the same parallel. That reason is an amicus curiæ who speaks de plano, not pro tribunali. It is a friend who makes <b>an</b> <b>useful</b> suggestion to the court, without questioning its jurisdiction. Whilst he acknowledges its competence, he promotes its efficiency. I shall pursue the plan I have chalked out in my letters that follow this.|$|E
6000|$|Exertion, like virtue, {{is its own}} reward; and {{our hero}} had, moreover, other {{stimulating}} motives for persevering in a display of affected composure and indifference to Flora's obvious unkindness. Pride, which supplies its caustic as <b>an</b> <b>useful,</b> though severe, remedy for the wounds of affection, came rapidly to his aid. Distinguished by the favour of a prince; destined, he had room to hope, to play a conspicuous part in the revolution which awaited a mighty kingdom; excelling, probably, in mental acquirements, and equalling at least in personal accomplishments, most of the noble and distinguished persons with whom he was now ranked; young, wealthy, and high-born,--could he, or ought he, to droop beneath the frown of a capricious beauty? ...|$|E
60|$|Who {{can tell}} {{altogether}} and completely? And yet who cannot tell in part? Use the common sense, my friends, which God {{has given to}} you, and think;--If eternal life be the life of God, {{it must be a}} good life; for God is good. That is the first, and the most certain thing which we can say of it. It must be a righteous and just life; a loving and merciful life; for God is righteous, just, loving, merciful; and more, it must be <b>an</b> <b>useful</b> life, a life of good works; for God is eternally useful, doing good to all his creatures, working for ever for the benefit of all which he has made.|$|E

"It is not {{necessary}} you should altogether abandon him, though you dismiss him to another service, or to a calling better suiting his station and character," [...] said the preacher; [...] "elsewhere he maybe <b>an</b> <b>useful</b> and profitable member of the commonweal--here he is but a makebate, and a stumbling-block of offence. The youth has snatches of sense and of intelligence, though he lacks industry. I will myself give him letters commendatory to Olearius Schinderhausen, a learned professor at the famous university of Leyden, where they lack an under-janitor--where, besides gratis instruction, if God give him the grace to seek it, he will enjoy five merks by the year, and the professor's cast-off suit, which he disparts with biennially." ...|$|E

I have loved them perhaps too well in my time, and now I condemn them {{not altogether}}, or in gross, though I approve not their excesses and extravagances.--I cannot, even in Shakspeare, but see many things both scandalous to decency and prejudicial to good manners--many things which tend to ridicule virtue, or to recommend vice,--at least to mitigate the hideousness of its features. I cannot think these fine poems are <b>an</b> <b>useful</b> study, and especially for the youth of either sex, in which bloodshed is pointed out as the chief occupation of the men, and intrigue as the sole employment of the women." ...|$|E

6000|$|The snake, {{like the}} other animals, frogs and lizards, in Andaman, Australian and Iroquois myth, had {{swallowed}} the waters before its murder.* Whether {{the legend of the}} slaying of the Python was or was not originally an allegory of the defeat of winter by sunlight, it certainly at a very early period became mixed up with ancient legal ideas and local traditions. It is almost as necessary for a young god or hero to slay monsters as for a young lady to be presented at court; and we may hesitate to explain all these legends of <b>an</b> <b>useful</b> feat of courage as nature-myths. In the Homeric Hymn to Apollo Pythius, the monster is called Dracæna, the female form of drakon. The Drakos and his wife are still popular bogies in modern Greek superstition and folk-song.** ...|$|E
60|$|Has he well {{considered}} what {{an immense}} operation {{any change in}} our constitution is? how many discussions, parties, and passions, it will necessarily excite; and when you open it to inquiry in one part, where the inquiry will stop? Experience shows us, that no time can be fit for such changes but a time of general confusion; when good men, finding everything already broken up, think it right {{to take advantage of}} the opportunity of such derangement in favor of <b>an</b> <b>useful</b> alteration. Perhaps a time of the greatest security and tranquillity both at home and abroad may likewise be fit; but will the author affirm this to be just such a time? Transferring an idea of military to civil prudence, he ought to know how dangerous it is to make an alteration of your disposition in the face of an enemy.|$|E
