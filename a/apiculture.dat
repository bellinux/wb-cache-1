5|$|A British {{beekeeper}} successfully {{developed a}} strain of bees that are resistant to varroa mites. Russian honey bees also resist infestations of varroa mites but are still susceptible to other factors associated with colony collapse disorder, and have detrimental traits that limit their relevance in commercial <b>apiculture.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{well-documented}} {{outbreak of}} colony losses spread from the Isle of Wight {{to the rest}} of the UK in 1906. These losses later were attributed to a combination of factors, including adverse weather, intensive <b>apiculture</b> leading to inadequate forage, and a new infection, the chronic bee paralysis virus, but at the time, the cause of this agricultural beekeeping problem was similarly mysterious and unknown.|$|E
5|$|Human {{beekeeping}} or <b>apiculture</b> {{has been}} practised for millennia, {{since at least}} the times of Ancient Egypt and Ancient Greece. Apart from honey and pollination, honey bees produce beeswax, royal jelly and propolis. Bees have appeared in mythology and folklore, through all phases of art and literature, from ancient times to the present day, though primarily focused in the Northern Hemisphere, where beekeeping is far more common.|$|E
5|$|The {{department}} of entomology has done several studies in <b>apiculture,</b> chemical ecology, horticultural pollination, and the behavior of honeybee and bumblebee colonies. Although some research {{was done in the}} apiary yards, the majority of data had to be collected with higher numbers of colonies at different experimental stations.|$|E
5|$|While both {{hunting and}} fishing were common, the peasants mostly hunted to protect their herds and crops. <b>Apiculture,</b> the keeping of bees, was as highly {{developed}} in Byzantium {{as it had been}} in Ancient Greece. Aside from agriculture, the peasants also laboured in the crafts, fiscal inventories mentioning smiths (Greek: χαλκεύς, chalkeus), tailors (Greek: ράπτης, rhaptes), and cobblers (Greek: τζαγγάριος, tzangarios).|$|E
5|$|Industrial <b>apiculture</b> {{has adopted}} simple {{breeding}} programs for uniform desired traits, and seasonal transportation of colonies over vast distances causes increased infectious exposures from mixing of these domestic and residual displaced wild populations. Brood incubation conditions may be stressful {{with respect to}} deficient nutrition, temperature and other basics. This combination of ecological factors, especially the host factor of loss of genetic variation and hybrid vigor, {{may account for the}} apparent multifactorial environmental 'causes' of CCD including concurrent infections.|$|E
5|$|The Apiary Laboratory, {{more often}} {{referred}} to as the Apiary, is a research laboratory at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Originally built for the study of honey bees and <b>apiculture,</b> today it is primarily used to study native pollinator species and the chemicals and pathogens impacting their populations. This academic building is unique in that it is credited as being the first in the United States to be erected exclusively for the teaching of beekeeping.|$|E
5|$|Colony {{collapse}} disorder (CCD) is {{the phenomenon}} {{that occurs when}} the majority of worker bees in a colony disappear and leave behind a queen, plenty of food and a few nurse bees {{to care for the}} remaining immature bees and the queen. While such disappearances have occurred throughout the history of <b>apiculture,</b> and were known by various names (disappearing disease, spring dwindle, May disease, autumn collapse, and fall dwindle disease), the syndrome was renamed colony collapse disorder in late 2006 in conjunction with a drastic {{rise in the number of}} disappearances of western honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies in North America. European beekeepers observed similar phenomena in Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain, Switzerland and Germany, albeit to a lesser degree, and the Northern Ireland Assembly received reports of a decline greater than 50%.|$|E

25|$|The chief {{difference}} between the European races or subspecies of bees kept by beekeepers and the African stock is attributable to both selective breeding and natural selection. By selecting only the most gentle, non-defensive races, beekeepers have, over centuries, eliminated the more defensive races and created a number of subspecies suitable for <b>apiculture.</b> The most common race used in Europe and the United States today is the Italian bee, Apis mellifera ligustica, which {{has been used for}} over a thousand years {{in some parts of the}} world and in the Americas since the arrival of the European colonists.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} managed colonies in the United States for honey {{production}} {{has been in}} decline since the 1940s. Annual declines and colony losses are normal however the rate of honeybee deaths {{as well as the}} inability to find a determinate cause of the deaths has caused some alarm. In 2006, some beekeepers reported losing 30-90% of their hives. Total colony loss reached 45% between 2012 and 2013, up from 28.9% and 36.4% in previous years. While annual losses above 30% are not out of the ordinary, the symptoms of these colony losses do not all match with those normally produced by known pests and pathogens. The amount of loss experienced as well as uncertainty around the cause of the loss lead to the coining of the term Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) by the <b>apiculture</b> community.|$|E
25|$|Willow Bunch's {{agriculture}} {{generates the}} most profit from grain yields; {{as a result}} there is much less emphasis on livestock. Surveys from the 1930s show high poultry production, and moderate production of horses, cattle, sheep and swine. Sheep production saw a major drop from 1931 to 1936 and never rose again. The 1950s continued these pre-existing trends with low sheep production, high cattle production, and very high poultry production. The trend has since continued unabated, with far more land dedicated to crops than pasture fields. A 2011 census shows no farms dedicated to animals other than beef cattle ranches and animal combination farms. Furthermore, there are no farms dedicated to general <b>apiculture.</b> The small presence of livestock is characteristic of the farming division, however. While areas like Old Post, Waverly and Excel have many farms dedicated to cattle ranching/farming, these municipalities have few other farms dedicated to animal production.|$|E
25|$|The {{economy of}} the Second Bulgarian Empire was based on agriculture, mining, {{traditional}} crafts, and trade. Agriculture and livestock breeding remained the mainstays of the Bulgarian economy between the 12th and 14th centuries. Moesia, Zagore, and Dobrudzha were known for rich harvests of grain, including high quality wheat. Production of wheat, barley, and millet was also developed in most regions of Thrace. The main wine-producing areas were Thrace, the Black Sea coast, and the valleys of the Struma and Vardar rivers in Macedonia. Production of vegetables, orchards, and grapes became increasingly important {{since the beginning of}} the 13th century. The existence of large forests and pastures was favorable for livestock breeding, mainly in the mountainous and semi-mountainous regions of the country. Sericulture and especially <b>apiculture</b> were well developed. Honey and wax from Zagore were the best-quality bee products in the Byzantine markets and were highly praised. The forests produced wood for cutting (бранища); there were also fenced forests (забели), in which wood-cutting was banned.|$|E
25|$|In {{areas of}} {{suitable}} temperate climate, the survival traits of Africanized colonies help them outperform European honey bee colonies. They also return later and basically work under conditions that often keep European bees hive-bound. This {{is the reason}} why they have gained a well-deserved reputation as superior honey producers, and those beekeepers who have learned to adapt their management techniques now seem to prefer them to their European counterparts. Studies show that in areas of Florida that contain Africanized honey bees, the honey production is higher than in areas in which they do not live. It is also becoming apparent that Africanized bees have another advantage over European bees in that they seem to show a higher resistance to several health issues including parasites such as Varroa destructor, some fungal diseases like chalkbrood and even the mysterious colony-collapse disorder which is currently plaguing beekeepers. So despite all its negative factors, {{it is possible that the}} Africanized honey bee might actually end up being a boon to <b>apiculture.</b>|$|E

500|$|Since {{the early}} days of its {{founding}} as the Massachusetts Agricultural College, UMass Amherst has maintained <b>apiculture</b> and ecological studies of bees throughout much of its history. In 1870 the first short courses on beekeeping were taught at the college by Alonzo Bradley Esq., an expert on honeybee behavior {{and the president of the}} Massachusetts Beekeepers' Association at the time. These lectures were given for several of the years that followed and appear to be [...] "the first instruction in the subject given in any agricultural college in this country" [...] as indicated by H.T. Fernald in his account of the college's history. Only two decades earlier western Massachusetts had been home to Lorenzo Langstroth, a man considered to be the father of modern <b>apiculture.</b> Although he had spent much of his time developing his innovative hive (now considered an international standard) in Philadelphia, in 1852 he moved to Greenfield, Massachusetts to recover from illness and further his study of honeybee behavior. In the following year he published his widely acclaimed primer, The Hive and the Honey-Bee at the Hopkins, Bridgman & Co. press of Northampton.; this book, having gone through several editions since, has become a mainstay of American beekeeping literature. One of Langstroth's own apprentices, James Fitts Wood, would go on to serve as the lecturer of beekeeping at the agricultural college for several years. During this time he continued to make significant contributions in queen-rearing and became known in the apicultural community for developing a strain of notably docile Italian honeybees. Despite his success in academia and <b>apiculture,</b> Wood unfortunately would not live to see the establishment of the college apiary, he died after a period serious illness on February15,1905 at the age of 44.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the {{construction}} of the building, the Massachusetts Agricultural College had maintained a beekeeping program {{for a number of years}} as one of the first land-grant agricultural colleges to teach the subject in the United States. In time, techniques in <b>apiculture</b> progressed, leaving beekeeping as no longer simply a hobby, but rather a viable agricultural business. The college's program had remained limited to a single short-course for a number of years but was expanded however, when in 1911, a bill passed establishing the office of [...] "state apiary inspector". Dr. Burton N. Gates, the man first appointed to this position was also the college beekeeping lecturer at the time, and would oversee the expansion of the program as an asset to the college and a service to the state in the years to come. [...] Construction began on the apiary in February1911 and with its completion in June of the following year for a total cost of $3000. At the time the building contained a laboratory, a wintering cellar, a wood workshop, an office with a comprehensive library of apicultural books, honey and wax extraction rooms and a two-person apartment used by student tenants. It was also the first structure built in the college orchard, a section of campus now known as the Central housing area.|$|E

[...] However, in view of his achievements in Frodsham, including the building of the Iron Church, the restoration of the parish church and vicarage, and the development of the church schools in his parish, the comment that while he was there [...] "he had occasional periods of effectiveness" [...] seems unfair.|$|E
2500|$|The chief occupations of the Dacians were agriculture, <b>apiculture,</b> viticulture, livestock, {{ceramics}} and metalworking. They also worked {{the gold and}} silver mines of Transylvania. At Pecica, Arad, a Dacian workshop was discovered, along with equipment for minting coins and evidence of bronze, silver, and iron-working that suggests {{a broad spectrum of}} smithing. Evidence for the mass production of iron is found on many Dacian sites, indicating guild-like specialization. Dacian ceramic manufacturing traditions continue from the pre-Roman to the Roman period, both in provincial and unoccupied Dacia, and well into the fourth and even early fifth centuries. They engaged in considerable external trade, as is shown by the number of foreign coins found in the country (see also Decebalus Treasure). On the northernmost frontier of [...] "free Dacia", coin circulation steadily grew in the first and second centuries, with a decline in the third and a rise again in the fourth century; the same pattern as observed for the Banat region to the southwest. What is remarkable is the extent and increase in coin circulation after Roman withdrawal from Dacia, and as far north as Transcarpathia.|$|E
2500|$|Tel Rehov is an [...] {{important}} Bronze and Iron Age {{archaeological site}} approximately five kilometers south of Beit She'an and three kilometers {{west of the}} Jordan River.

Archaeological excavations have been conducted at Rehov since 1997, under the directorship of Amihai Mazar. The first eight seasons of excavations revealed successive occupational layers from the Late Bronze Age and Iron Age I (12th - 11th centuries BCE). The Iron Age II levels of the site have emerged as a vitally important component in the current debate regarding the chronology of the United Monarchy of Israel. In September 2007, 30 intact beehives dated to the mid-10th to early 9th century BCE were found. The beehives are evidence of an advanced honey-producing beekeeping (<b>apiculture)</b> industry 3,000 years ago in the city, then thought to have a population of about 2,000. The beehives, made of straw and unbaked clay, were found in orderly rows of 100 hives. Organic material (wheat found next to the beehives) was dated using carbon-14 radiocarbon dating at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. Also found alongside the hives was an altar decorated with fertility figurines.|$|E
