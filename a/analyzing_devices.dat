40|$|Abstract: 2 ̆ 2 Designs evolve from a {{preliminary}} concept {{by a process}} of iterative evaluation and refinement. Every cycle of this process necessarily consists of assessing {{the extent to which}} functional specifications have been satisfied. It is hypothesized that providing a tool for automatically modeling and <b>analyzing</b> <b>devices</b> and relating individual component characteristics to device behavior would aid the conceptualdesigner by facilitating the consideration of more varied alternatives. In this paper we discuss issues pertaining to automated modeling tosupport design including issues of modeling relevance and model simplification. We propose a framework for automatic modeling based on the modular aggregation of bond graph fragments corresponding to components and connections. Although a component based modeling paradigm is convenient for the designer, it leads to bond graph models which are difficult to analyze and difficult to comprehend due to the presence of redundant, irrelevant and circuitous structure and due to a high degree of dependency among energy storage elements. Bond graph simplification methods have been developed that mitigate these problems. These methods identify and eliminate inert elements and redundant and constraining junction structures and replace dependent energy storage elements with functionally equivalent modifications to the remaining storage elements. The application of these methods makes it possible to apply standard equation formulation techniques and results in simple bond graph modelswhich can more easily be interpreted by the designer. 2 ̆...|$|E

40|$|Recently, the photon Monte Carlo code, RACER-X, was {{modified}} to include wave-length dependent absorption coefficients and indices of refraction. This {{work was done}} {{in an effort to}} increase the code`s capabilities to be more applicable to a wider range of problems. These new features make RACER-X useful for <b>analyzing</b> <b>devices</b> like monolithic interconnected modules (MIMs) which have etched surface features and incorporates a back surface reflector (BSR) for spectral control. A series of calculations were performed on various MIM structures to determine the impact that surface features and component reflectivities have on spectral utilization. The traditional concern of cavity photonics is replaced with intra-cell photonics in the MIM design. Like the cavity photonic problems previously discussed, small changes in optical properties and/or geometry can lead to large changes in spectral utilization. The calculations show that seemingly innocuous surface features (e. g., trenches and grid lines) can significantly reduce the spectral utilization due to the non-normal incident photon flux. Photons that enter the device through a trench edge are refracted onto a trajectory where they will not escape. This leads to a {{reduction in the number of}} reflected below bandgap photons that return to the radiator and reduce the spectral utilization.

40|$|Abstract Quantum optics {{potentially}} {{offers an}} information channel from the Uni-verse beyond the established ones of imaging and spectroscopy. All existing cam-eras and all spectrometers measure {{aspects of the}} first-order spatial and/or temporal coherence of light. However, light has additional degrees of freedom, manifest in the statistics of photon arrival times, or {{in the amount of}} photon orbital angular mo-mentum. Such quantum-optical measures may carry information on how the light was created at the source, and whether it reached the observer directly or via some intermediate process. Astronomical quantum optics may help to clarify emission processes in natural laser sources and in the environments of compact objects, while high-speed photon-counting with digital signal handling enables multi-element and long-baseline versions of the intensity interferometer. Time resolutions of nanosec-onds are required, as are large photon fluxes, making photonic astronomy very timely in an era of large telescopes. 1 What Is Observed in Astronomy? Almost all of astronomy depends on the interpretation of properties of electromag-netic radiation (“light”) from celestial sources. The sole exceptions are neutrino detections; gravitational-wave searches; analyses of cosmic rays, meteorites, and other extraterrestrial materials; and in-situ studies of solar-system bodies. All our other understanding of the Universe rests upon observing and interpreting more or less subtle properties in the light reaching us from celestial bodies. Astronomical telescopes are equipped with myriads of auxiliary instruments which, on first sight, may give an impression of being vastly different. However, a closer examination of the underlying physical principles reveals that they all are measuring either the spatial or temporal [first-order] coherence of light (or perhaps some combination of these). All imaging devices (cameras, interferometers) are studying aspects of the spatial coherence (in various directions, and for different angular extents on the sky).

40|$|Computed {{tomography}} (CT) is {{the general}} process of creating cross-sectional or tomographic image from projections (line integrals) of the object at multiple angles and using a computer for image reconstruction. If unmodified, the term CT generally implies images made from projections measured by transmission of X rays (X-ray computed tomography). The mathematical foundation of computed tomography was initially derived by Radon and published in 1917. However, {{it was not until}} the development of modern computers that the technique was at all viable. The first commercial CT scanner based on the prototype developed by Godfrey Hounsfield consisted of an X-ray source and two detectors, with a third, reference, detector near the X-ray source. In the last years alternative x-ray imaging techniques, other than the conventional absorption contrast were rapidly developing by various group of scientists in many working laboratories all over the world. Growing availability of the synchrotron light sources for wide range of users accelerated the development of the x-ray imaging techniques abruptly. Besides attenuation, x-ray refraction and shift of the electromagnetic wave phase occurs in an x-ray beam passing through an object. The widely used imaging techniques is based on the angular resolved (or refraction) contrast on which we concentrate in this work. As it follows from the definition it arises when an x-ray penetrated through an object deflects certain angle. In other words this contrast is proportional to the deviation angle which x-ray beam accumulates when it penetrates through an object and refracts on its boundaries. The emerging x-rays present characteristic angular deflections, which are on the microradian scale. Different refraction directions can be resolved by using an angular analyzer, for instance a perfect crystal, which can then be revealed by a detector placed behind it. By varying the alignment of the analyzer with regard to the incoming x-ray beam, the unrefracted x-rays can either be recorded on a detector or rejected thus, either contributing or not contributing to the image contrast. The x-ray refraction contrast can greatly exceed the absorption contrast for instance in imaging low Z materials, where the potentialities of the technique have been exploited from the beginning. An analyzer-based imaging technique has been presented in various versions also assuming different names. An important variation based on an algorithm that differentiates the separation of the refraction contrast from the absorption contrast in an image, has been introduced with the name 2 ̆ 7 diffraction enhanced imaging 2 ̆ 7 (DEI). The interest in the potential medical application of the diffraction imaging technique has given origin to many projects utilizing analyzer-based refraction imaging. Initiated with conventional x-ray generators, it has been rapidly developed in synchrotron radiation sites thanks to the highly intense collimated beams available that permit fast projection and tomographic imaging. Thus this work is the attempt to accumulate the information on the different implementations of the refraction contrast and prepare the CT-reconstruction of the refraction index field inside an object. Due to the success in this field I can state that it is the first known presentation of the complete solution of the problem. The CT-reconstruction performed from the refraction contrast promises the same advantages over the one based on the absorption contrast that the refraction contrast provides in comparison to other contrasts. The main of these advantages are i) possibility to observe the materials with low Z in higher energies, for example the soft tissue of the human body and ii) visualization of a tiny inclusions which are unobservable in the conventional absorption or phase-shift contracts, for example the cracks and defects in materials. The advantages automatically suggest to the ranges of applicability of this new method varying from medical applications of the synchrotron radiation up to material structure science. Once this work trying to cover all aspects of the problem of the 3 D reconstruction of the object inner structure from the refraction contrast it consists of three main parts: the theoretical consideration of the question, experimental implementation and finally the discussion of the results acquired in the experiment and processed in accordance with the theory. All three parts are structured trough and logically connected to each other in order to make the understanding easier and smoother to the reader. We can state that the goal was achieved. The model of penetration of the x-ray was assumed and the theory for the computed tomography reconstruction was built on the base of the model. The algorithm for the reconstruction was implemented in the accordance with the theoretical model. The software which utilizes the algorithm was written and debugged. The problem of the information about the deflection angle distribution from the distribution of the intensity at the detector was considered from different points of view. Several types of the <b>analyzing</b> <b>devices</b> that can provide the intensity distribution were considered. The devices were tested in experiment in order to judge about their applicability for the particular problem. After the test the judgment was done and the chosen device was studied in deep details which resulted into development of new method of extraction the information about the deflection of the x-ray. Actually, the method is modernization and generalization of the previously used one. However it allows to overcome the limits of the present method and makes the limitations on the sensitivity approximately 4 times wider. This great advantage allows us to state that the method developed is principally new. The theoretical base for the new method was built. It was tested in the experiment ad proved its usability. Then the experiment on the data acquisition for the CT-reconstruction which utilized the newly developed method of the refraction angle extraction was performed. The resulted of the experiment were processed by the software prepared for the CT-reconstruction from the refraction contrast. The results of the reconstruction are presented and discussed. The result allows us to conclude that the physical model chosen for the theoretical calculation is applicable and fits the problem. The proves of great advantage of the CT-reconstruction from the refraction contrast over the other types of contrasts developed by the current moment were provided and presented...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{characterization}} and implementation of transparent electron transport materials (ETM) in vacuum deposited p-i-n type organic solar cells (OSC) for substituting the parasitically absorbing standard ETM composed of n-doped C 60. In addition to transparency in the visible range of the sun spectrum, the desired material properties include high electron mobility and conductivity, thermal and morphological stability, as well as good energy level alignment relative to the adjacent acceptor layer which is commonly composed of intrinsic C 60. In this work, representatives of three different material classes are evaluated {{with regard to the}} above mentioned criteria. HATCN (hexaazatriphenylene hexacarbonitrile) is a small discoid molecule with six electron withdrawing nitrile groups at its periphery. It forms smooth thin films with an optical energy gap of 3. 3 eV, thus being transparent in the visible range of the sun spectrum. Doping with either 5 wt% of the cationic n-dopant AOB or 7 wt% of the proprietary material NDN 1 effectively increases the conductivity to 7. 6 * 10 ^- 6 S/cm or 2. 2 * 10 ^- 4 S/cm, respectively. However, the fabrication of efficient OSC is impeded by the exceptionally high electron affinity (EA) of approximately 4. 8 eV that causes the formation of an electron injection barrier between n-HATCN and intrinsic C 60 (EA= 4. 0 eV). This work presents a strategy to remove the barrier by introducing doped and undoped C 60 intermediate layers, thus demonstrating the importance of energy level matching in a multi-layer structure and the advantages of Fermi level control by doping. Next, a series of six Bis-Fl-NTCDI (N,N-bis(fluorene- 2 -yl) -naphthalenetetracarboxylic diimide) compounds, which only differ by the length of the alkyl chains attached to the C 9 positions of the fluorene side groups, is examined. When increasing the chain length from 0 to 6 carbon atoms, the energy levels remain nearly unchanged: We find EA= 3. 5 eV as estimated from cyclic voltammetry, an ionization potential (IP) in the range between 6. 45 eV and 6. 63 eV, and Eg,opt= 3. 1 eV which means that all compounds form transparent thin films. Concerning thin film morphology, the addition of side chains results in the formation of amorphous layers with a surface roughness < 1 nm on room temperature glass substrates, and (1. 5 +/- 0. 5) nm for deposition onto glass substrates heated to 100 °C. In contrast, films composed of the side chain free compound Bis-HFl-NTCDI exhibit a larger surface roughness of (2. 5 +/- 0. 5) nm and 9 nm, respectively, and are nanocrystalline already at room temperature. Moreover, the conductivity achievable by n-doping is very sensitive to the side chain length: Whereas doping of Bis-HFl-NTCDI with 7 wt% NDN 1 results in a conductivity in the range of 10 ^- 4 S/cm, the attachment of alkyl chains causes a conductivity which is more than three orders of magnitude smaller despite equal or slightly higher doping concentrations. The insufficient transport properties of the alkylated derivatives lead to the formation of pronounced s-kinks in the jV -characteristics of p-i-n type OSC while the use of n-Bis-HFl-NTCDI results in well performing devices. The last material, HATNA-Cl 6 (2, 3, 8, 9, 14, 15 - hexachloro- 5, 6, 11, 12, 17, 18 -hexaazatrinaphthylene), exhibits Eg,opt= 2. 7 eV and is therefore not completely transparent in the visible range of the sun spectrum. However, its energy level positions of EA= 4. 1 eV and IP= 7. 3 eV are well suited for the application as ETM in combination with i-C 60 as acceptor. The compound is dopable with all available n-dopants, resulting in maximum conductivities of sigma= 1. 6 * 10 ^- 6, 3. 5 * 10 ^- 3, and 7. 5 * 10 ^- 3 S/cm at 7. 5 wt% AOB, Cr 2 (hpp) 4, and NDN 1, respectively. Applying n-HATNA-Cl 6 instead of the reference ETM n-C 60 results in a comparable or improved photocurrent density at an ETM thickness d(ETM) = 40 nm or 120 nm, respectively. At d(ETM) = 120 nm, the efficiency eta is more than doubled as it increases from eta(n-C 60) = 0. 4 % to eta(n-HATNA-Cl 6) = 0. 9 %. Optical simulations show that the replacement of n-C 60 by n-Bis-HFl-NTCDI, n-HATNA-Cl 6, or the previously studied n-NTCDA (naphthalenetretracarboxylic dianhydride) in p-i-n or n-i-p type device architectures is expected to result in an increased photocurrent due to reduced parasitic absorption. For quantifying the gain, the performance of p-i-n type OSC with varying ETM type and thickness is evaluated. Special care has to be taken when <b>analyzing</b> <b>devices</b> comprising the reference ETM n-C 60 as its conductivity is sufficiently large to extend the area of the aluminum cathode and thus the effective device area which may lead to distorted results. Overall, the experiment is able to confirm the trends predicted by the optical simulation. At large ETM thickness in the range between 60 and 120 nm, the window layer effect of the ETM is most pronounced. For instance, at d(ETM) = 120 nm, eta(C 60) is more than doubled using n-HATNA-Cl 6 and even more than tripled using n-Bis-HFl-NTCDI or n-NTCDA. At optimized device geometry the photocurrent gain is slightly less than expected but nonetheless, the efficiency is improved from eta(max) = 2. 1 % for n-C 60 and n-HATNA-Cl 6 solar cells to eta(max) = 2. 3, and 2. 4 % for n-Bis-HFl-NTCDI and n-NTCDA devices, respectively. This development is supported by generally higher Voc and FF in solar cells with transparent ETM. Finally, p-i-n type solar cells with varying ETM are aged at a temperature of 50 °C and an illumination intensity of approximately 2 suns. Having extrapolated lifetimes t(80) of 36, 500, and 14000 h and nearly unchanged jV-characteristics after 2000 h, n-C 60 and n-Bis-HFl-NTCDI devices exhibit the best stability. In contrast, n-NTCDA devices suffer from a constant decrease in Isc while n-HATNA-Cl 6 solar cells show a rapid dscegradation of both Isc and FF associated with a decomposition of the material or a complete de-doping of the ETM. Here, lifetimes of only 4500 h and 445 hare achieved...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A {{computing}} {{platform that}} works under extreme conditions (> 250 ◦C and at radiation> 1 Mrad) can be attractive {{in a number}} of important application areas, including automotive, space and avionics. Nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) switches have emerged as promising candidates for computing in harsh environment. Designing reliable memory specifically non-volatile memory is a major challenge for these computing systems. In this paper, we propose a novel non-volatile memory (NVM) design for reliable operation in extreme environment using NEMS structure. It exploits a common failure mode in these devices, namely stiction. Unlike traditional charge-based memories, it relies on the mechanical state of a NEMS switch as information carrier. We <b>analyze</b> <b>device</b> and circuit-level design issues to enable robust NVM array implementation with NEMS devices. I...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of {{degradation}} tests performed at Vgs = - 5 V and increasing Vds levels on GaN HEMTs with different gate materials: Ni/Au/Ni, ITO and Ni/ITO. At each step we measured the electrical and optical characteristics of the transistors to analyze the degradation process. We found that (i) stress induces a permanent degradation of the gate diode, consisting {{in an increase in}} the leakage current; (ii) this change is due to the generation of parasitic conductive paths, as the electroluminescence maps suggest; (iii) devices based on Indium Tin Oxide showed higher reliability. These data strongly support the hypothesis that the robustness is influenced by processing parameters, since all <b>analyzed</b> <b>devices</b> come from the same epitaxial wafer...|$|R
