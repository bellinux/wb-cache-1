40|$|The final {{cessation}} {{of the legal}} effects of administrative acts {{can be achieved by}} <b>annulment</b> <b>and</b> <b>revocation.</b> Both are legal operations that lead to the termination of legal effects of administrative acts. A controversial issue is the one regarding the authorities that may exercise the right of revocation and annulment of an administrative act. As concerns normative administrative acts, the specific manner of termination of enforcement of such acts is to repeal them. On the relationship between repeal {{on the one hand and}} cancellation and revocation on the other hand, various contradictory opinions were voiced in the legal doctrine. An aspect with important implications in the administrative practice is the one concerning the possibility of invalidating a normative administrative act before its entering into force. Finally, the article deals with the notion of non-existent administrative acts, which has become a constitutional institution as concerns administrative normative acts...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to set the context for the {{management}} of consent <b>and</b> <b>revocation</b> in enterprises, create awareness and so pave the way towards better and improved practices in this area. A number of international laws and regulations mandate (to some degree) that individuals should be enabled to express their consent for the usage of their data and subsequently be allowed to revoke it. Unfortunately the practical implications and management of consent <b>and</b> <b>revocation</b> are not yet fully understood and taken into account, apart from on an ad hoc basis. Key involved aspects are: allowing individuals to retain some control over their personal data; ensuring that consent <b>and</b> <b>revocation</b> can be enforced by data receivers. This paper addresses questions such as the following: What are the key requirements and practical implications of handling consent <b>and</b> <b>revocation,</b> for individuals <b>and</b> organisations (data receivers) ? How can we enable people to effectively express their consent when disclosing their personal data and, subsequently, to revoke it? How could we enable organisations to manage and enforce consent <b>and</b> <b>revocation?</b> We focus on an enterprise scenario, as a significant example. We discuss requirements and open issues. We provide a reference model for the management of consent <b>and</b> <b>revocation</b> <b>and</b> illustrate some technologies that could be used to animate it. This is work in progress. Further research will be carried out in the context of the multi-disciplinary, collaborative EnCoRe project...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we present {{the notion of}} a consent <b>and</b> <b>revocation</b> policy, as it has been defined {{within the context of the}} EnCoRe project. A consent <b>and</b> <b>revocation</b> policy is {{different}} to a privacy policy in that it defines not enterprise practices with regards to personal data, but more specifically, for each item of personal data held by an enterprise, what consent preferences a user may express and to what degree, and in what ways he or she can revoke their personal data. This builds on earlier work on defining the different forms of revocation for personal data, and on formal models of consent <b>and</b> <b>revocation</b> processes...|$|R

40|$|Traditionally, {{creation}} <b>and</b> <b>revocation</b> of certificates {{are governed}} by policies that are carried manually, off-line, by trusted agents. This approach to certificate management is appropriate for many current applications, where these policies cannot be verified automatically (e. g. require verification of of non-digital credentials). But it is expensive, time consuming and error-prone for the growing class of applications where certificate management policies can be formalized and carried-out automatically. We argue that, in these cases, creation <b>and</b> <b>revocation</b> of certificates {{could be viewed as}} any other online service available in a system. Access to these particular service instances could be regulated much {{in the same manner as}} file access or resource allocation. This paper proposes a formulation for certification <b>and</b> <b>revocation</b> policies, <b>and</b> a framework for their support. In this framework, certificate management policies are enforced by generic policy engines, wrapped around certification authorities <b>and</b> <b>revocation</b> servers. The proposed framework is easy to deploy, requiring no modifications of current public key infrastructure (PKI). Moreover, we show that this framework is quite affordable, even in its present, experimental stage...|$|R
