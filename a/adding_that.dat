Gilgun <b>added</b> <b>that</b> Rudy was [...] "happy all the time" [...] {{although}} he felt like Rudy was [...] "a bit of a sociopath" [...] because he [...] "doesn't question things he says or does" [...] and doesn't care what people think about him. Gilgun <b>added</b> <b>that</b> Rudy is [...] "not a bad person" [...] and is [...] "quite endearing". He <b>added</b> <b>that</b> Rudy [...] "doesn't question anything", has [...] "no set motive" [...] and [...] "lives for the moment". Gilgun also <b>added</b> <b>that</b> Rudy is [...] "consistently wrong". Gilgun <b>added</b> <b>that</b> Rudy is [...] "a total plonker who gets into multiple scrapes wherever he goes - and with whoever he meets".|$|R

5|$|When Jenijoy La Belle, who {{had been}} hired in 1969 but refused tenure in 1974, filed suit with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Christy pressed for the case to be settled and La Belle to be given tenure. The EEOC ruled against Caltech in 1977, <b>adding</b> <b>that</b> she had been paid less than male colleagues. La Belle {{received}} tenure in 1979.|$|E
5|$|Chaitanya Krishna {{confirmed}} his {{inclusion in the}} cast {{by the end of}} March 2014. In late April 2014, Naresh was chosen {{to play an important role}} in the film, which he later described as one of the best roles of his career. Roshan Basheer was selected to reprise the role of Varun, the son of the Inspector General of Police, in the remake. He did not feel that he was being typecast and he accepted the role, <b>adding</b> <b>that</b> it is not often that a Malayalam actor gets a chance to act in the Telugu films.|$|E

5|$|Forty {{years earlier}} than de Tournefort, de Thévenot {{described}} {{much the same}} process, <b>adding</b> <b>that</b> it was seldom used because it was regarded as too cruel. Some 80 years prior to de Thevenot, in 1579, Hans Jacob Breuning von Buchenbach witnessed {{a variant of the}} gaunching ritual. A large iron hook was fixed on the horizontal cross-bar of the gallows and the individual was forced upon this hook, piercing him from the abdomen through his back, so that he hung from it, hands, feet and head downward. On top of the cross bar, the executioner situated himself and performed various torture on the impaled man below him.|$|E
5|$|Governor David Paterson's {{selection}} process {{began with a}} number of prominent names and high-ranking New York Democrats, including Andrew Cuomo, Fran Drescher and Caroline Kennedy, vying for the spot.

She said that she made an effort to underscore her successful House elections in a largely conservative district, <b>adding</b> <b>that</b> she could be a good complement to Chuck Schumer. Gillibrand was presumed a likely choice {{in the days before the}} official announcement. On January 23, 2009, Paterson held a press conference to announce Gillibrand as his choice.|$|E
5|$|However, on 15 March 2016, American comedian Jim Breuer (a {{friend of}} Johnson) {{revealed}} on his podcast that Johnson {{had received a}} second opinion on his hearing {{and it was not}} as bad as initially thought.

5|$|Hughes {{countered that}} he did not believe the wording of the 1957 {{document}} gave Rhodesia the right to devise its own representation overseas without first gaining assent from Britain. The Reedman appointment would probably be seen internationally as a major rise in Rhodesian diplomatic profile, he said, and might damage Britain's reputation, which would in turn make the ongoing negotiations for independence more difficult for both sides. He repeated Bottomley's previous offer of a consul on the British Embassy staff, <b>adding</b> <b>that</b> the official would not have to be physically located within the embassy, and could set up his own office elsewhere so long as he remained nominally affiliated to it.|$|E

Judge Luis Singleterry set a $1 million bond.|$|E
5|$|Jeff, {{eager to}} get away, {{deliberately}} stirs a fight among the group, then leaves once more to get the test answers. Dr. Duncan hands him a sealed envelope, but only in return for Jeff's Lexus. When Jeff returns, the group is in turmoil, and Britta promises {{to go out with}} him if he can restore order. He does this through an inspirational speech, but Britta sees through his lies and asks him to leave. Jeff then comes clean about everything, <b>adding</b> <b>that</b> since he now has the test answers he does not need the study group. As the group turns against him he leaves.|$|E

5|$|Just as {{her best}} music drew on {{sampling}} — assembling sonic licks and stylistic fragments borrowed from Motown, Stax, punk and early hip-hop – her personal style {{was also a}} knowing collage. There was a certain moment in the '90s when, if you were headed downtown and turned left, every girl looked like Bettie Page. But {{they did not do}} what Winehouse did, mixing Bettie Page with Brigitte Bardot and <b>adding</b> <b>that</b> little bit of Ronnie Spector.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{during his}} college tour, Chapman {{mentioned}} that a television audience member {{had written to}} the Pythons to complain about them having a gay member, <b>adding</b> <b>that</b> the Bible said any man who lies with a man should be taken out and stoned. With other Pythons already aware of his sexual orientation, Idle jokingly replied that they had found the perpetrator and killed him. Both Sherlock and Tomiczek remained a constant in Chapman's life. In the mid-1980s, having resettled in Britain, the three moved to Maidstone, Kent.|$|E
5|$|Proposals for {{building}} a planetarium in Toronto date back to 1944, but serious planning only started in 1962, thanks to a bequest made by {{a former member of}} the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada (RASC).

5|$|Reviewers also {{praised the}} {{gameplay}} and system mechanics.

5|$|The 2008 {{fighting}} game Super Smash Bros. Brawl features Mother 3 protagonist Lucas as a playable character alongside Ness, {{a perennial}} Super Smash Bros. series {{character and the}} protagonist of EarthBound/Mother 2.

Official Nintendo Magazine Thomas East thought that both characters should be dropped from future Super Smash Bros. games, <b>adding</b> <b>that</b> Lucas was too similar to Ness. Both characters returned in the sequel, Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, where Ness is readily available and Lucas is available as downloadable content.|$|E
5|$|The Recognitions of Clement {{contains}} a source document (Rec. 1.27–71), conventionally {{referred to by}} scholars as the Ascents of James, which {{is believed to be}} of Jewish–Christian origin. The Ascents shares a similarity to the Gospel of the Ebionites with regard to the baptism of the Pharisees by John (Pan. 30.13.4; Rec. 1.54.6–7) and the command to abolish the Jewish sacrifices, <b>adding</b> <b>that</b> a Christian water baptism is to be substituted for the remission of sins. Based on these similarities, scholars Richard Bauckham and F. Stanley Jones have postulated a direct dependence of the Ascents of James on the Gospel of the Ebionites.|$|E
