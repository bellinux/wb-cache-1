From left to right, they are: Saturn with sickle and club for Saturday, Jupiter with thunderbolts for Thursday, Mars with sword and shield for Tuesday, Venus with Cupid for Friday and Mercury with staff <b>and</b> <b>bag</b> for Wednesday. The painting of the entire clock area was refurbished in 1983. Only the matte areas on the clock face are from the earlier coat of paint.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Vectors <b>and</b> <b>bags</b> {{are basic}} {{collection}} data structures, {{which are used}} frequently in programs and specifications. Reasoning about these data structures is supported by established algorithms for deciding ground satisfiability in the theories of arrays (for vectors) <b>and</b> multisets (for <b>bags),</b> respectively. Yet, these decision procedures are only able to reason about vectors <b>and</b> <b>bags</b> in isolation, not about their combination. This paper presents a decision procedure for {{the combination of the}} theories of vectors <b>and</b> <b>bags,</b> even when extended with a function bagof bridging between vectors <b>and</b> <b>bags.</b> The function bagof converts vectors into the bags of their elements, thus admitting vector/bag comparisons. Moreover, for certain syntactically restricted classes of ground formulae decidability is retained if the theory of vectors is extended further with a map function which applies uninterpreted functions to all elements of a vector. ...|$|R

25|$|In {{an effort}} to limit the {{potential}} harm from having a transmitter close to the user's body, the first fixed/mobile cellular phones that had a separate transmitter, vehicle-mounted antenna, and handset (known as car phones <b>and</b> <b>bag</b> phones) were limited to a maximum 3 watts Effective Radiated Power. Modern handheld cellphones which must have the transmission antenna held inches from the user's skull are limited to a maximum transmission power of 0.6 watts ERP. Regardless of the potential biological effects, the reduced transmission range of modern handheld phones limits their usefulness in rural locations as compared to car/bag phones, and handhelds require that cell towers are spaced much closer together to compensate for their lack of transmission power.|$|E
25|$|By this time, Cheatham's {{division}} under Maj. Gen. John C. Brown {{was moved}} into position for another attack on Spring Hill, on Cleburne's right. Brown did not attack, however. It {{was reported that}} there were Union troops in position on his right flank and front and that Forrest's cavalrymen, promised to protect his right flank, {{did not seem to}} be present. Brown decided to consult with his corps commander before proceeding, sending two staff officers to find Cheatham and halting his troops while he awaited a decision. By the time Cheatham and Brown were able to speak, the battlefield was in total darkness, and the two officers decided that an assault conducted then without knowing the condition of their right flank might be a disaster. Hood was furious that the attack had not proceeded as he intended and that the pike was still open. He dispatched a staff officer to find Stewart to assist Cheatham. Having been up since 3 a.m., Hood went to bed at 9 p.m., confident that whatever setbacks his army had suffered during the day, they would be able to correct them in the morning <b>and</b> <b>bag</b> Schofield.|$|E

25|$|The Newington College Preparatory School was {{established}} initially at Killara (1957) and later at Lindfield (1967), {{in response to}} requests from Old Newingtonians that a preparatory school be established on the North Shore of Sydney. The Head of Newington College, Lindfield, is Mr Ben Barrington-Higgs. It is a single-stream school, with approximately 160 students from Kindergarten to Year 6 and {{is set in a}} bushland location where the Students are constantly in touch with nature. The school features a basketball/tennis court, climbing gym areas, swimming pool and connects to the bush trails of Swain Gardens. Each classroom includes effective information communication technology tools. Classrooms have dedicated computer and wet areas, <b>and</b> <b>bag</b> storage areas. There are special facilities for music, art and French. A tuckshop operates three days a week. The campus has just undergone a major redevelopment of classrooms and the addition of a new hall, library and visual arts room. Students in Years 3–6 compete in the Independent Primary School Heads of Australia (IPSHA) Competition held on Saturday mornings. Every student competes in a summer (basketball or cricket) or winter sport (rugby or soccer). Newington's preparatory schools combine for annual carnivals in swimming, athletics and cross country.|$|E

Cornwallis' quartermaster general, William Erskine, urged Cornwallis to strike right away, saying [...] "If Washington is the General I take him to be, his army will not be found there in the morning." [...] But James Grant disagreed, and argued that there was no way for the Americans to retreat, and that the British troops were worn out, and that it would be better for them to attack in the morning after they had rested. Cornwallis did not want to wait until morning, but he decided that it would be better than sending his troops out to attack in the dark. Cornwallis said, [...] "We've got the old fox safe now. We'll go over <b>and</b> <b>bag</b> him in the morning." [...] Cornwallis then moved his army to a hill north of Trenton for the night.|$|E
500|$|Off the United States, {{the fishing}} of the blacknose shark is {{regulated}} by the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service 1993 Fisheries Management Plan (FMP) for Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico sharks. For the purposes of commercial quotas <b>and</b> <b>bag</b> limits, the blacknose shark is classified within the [...] "small coastal shark" [...] (SCS) complex. From 1999 to 2005, an average of 27,484 blacknose sharks (62 metric tons) were caught each year off the United States. Recent stock assessments conducted by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have determined the populations of this species have become overfished in both the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico. In 2009, the NOAA proposed instituting a separate quota for blacknose sharks of 6,065 sharks per year, and a ban on using gillnets to catch sharks in the Atlantic. By contrast, blacknose shark stocks off northern Brazil appear to be stable, while no fishery data {{are available from the}} Caribbean. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened globally.|$|E
