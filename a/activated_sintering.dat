Experimental {{results show that the}} effect of alumina reinforcement on tungsten compacts exhibit improved mechanical strength with high densification at relatively low sintering temperature during nickel <b>activated</b> <b>sintering</b> process. The densification of sintered compacts could be effectively enhanced with Ni addition, and near-full dense samples (98. 0 % of theoretical density) could be obtained by 0. 6 wt% Ni adding. Furthermore, the grain growth of sintered compacts could be restrained from 10. 55 mu m to 2. 57 mu m with ultrafine Al 2 O 3 addition, which results in about 32 % improvement of Vickers microhardness value of 515 +/- 7 (VHN) compared to that of W-Ni composite without Al 2 O 3 addition.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} the addition of TiO 2 on the properties of magnesium oxide obtained from seawater by substoichiometrical precipitation with 80 % of the stoichiometrically required quantity of dolomite lime as the precipitation agent. Magnesium oxide obtained from seawater by substoichiometrical precipitation contains boron(III) oxide as an impurity. During the precipitation of magnesium hydroxide, the boron present in seawater (in the form of non-dissociated orthoboric acid H 3 BO 3, and partly as borate ion H 2 BO 3 –) adsorbs onto the magnesium hydroxide precipitate, and therefore has to be reduced as much as possible using the appropriate method of rinsing the magnesium hydroxide precipitate. B 2 O 3 is an undesirable admixture in seawater magnesium oxide. Specifically, the properties of special purpose magnesium oxide, i. e. high strength magnesium oxide, are affected significantly by the content of boron in the product. Good quality sintered magnesium oxide contains a very small amount ofB 2 O 3. The impurity should not exceed w(B 2 O 3) = 0. 005 % in refractory magnesium oxide. The combined method of rinsing the magnesium hydroxide precipitate (3 + 2) was used in sample preparation, i. e. rinsing by decanting was done three times with alkalized distilled water of pH = 12. 50 and twice with distilled water of pH = 6. 74. Multiple rinsing on filter paper (five times) was done using the same rinsing agent (fresh distilled water of pH = 6. 74). The MgO (80 % precipitation) samples were then subjected to isothermal and <b>activated</b> <b>sintering</b> without TiO 2 addition, {{as well as with the}} addition of TiO 2, w(TiO 2) = 5 and 8 %, at the temperature of 1700 oC for 1 hour, with the aim of determining the properties of these samples primarily with regard to the B 2 O 3 content in the samples after sintering.

The addition of TiO 2, w(TiO 2) = 5 %, is sufficient to bind the present CaO and thereby lead to greater evaporation of B 2 O 3 in the process of <b>activated</b> <b>sintering</b> of seawater magnesium oxide.
