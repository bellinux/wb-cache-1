40|$|Abstract: <b>Automatic</b> <b>weighing</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} part in many fields of applications: Large quantities of commodities and raw materials are handled in trading centres using automatic belt weighers or totalizing hopper weighers for bulk-to-bulk weighing, smaller quantities of commodities being meant for end users are automatically filled and weighed by gravimetric filling instruments, by catchweighers or checkweighers. Commodities transported on vehicles or by rail are often weighed automatically by in-motion road vehicle <b>weighing</b> instruments or <b>automatic</b> rail-weighbridges, respectively. New developments and measurement techniques are especially observed in the field of waste disposal, weighing of container wagons in cross-border traffic, shovel dozers for weighing building materials, and automation of processes in the food and non-food industry.

40|$|This work proposes and validates {{experimentally}} a model-based {{scheme for}} the compensation of environmental vibrations affecting load cell measurements in <b>automatic</b> <b>weighing</b> machines. Weighing machines are often {{adversely affected by}} low frequency vibrations which may arise from the coupled effects of machine frame flexibility and the excitation induced by internal (inertial) or external (impact) vibration sources. These vibrations are generally named “environmental vibrations”, since they seem to arise from the environment around the machine. Environmental vibrations have a detrimental effect on load cell responses and can in turn deteriorate machine performances. It is usually ineffective to try overcoming this problem by low-pass filtering load cell measurements: low cut-off frequencies usually downgrade machine speed by both introducing delay and increasing filtered signal rise time. Since <b>automatic</b> <b>weighing</b> machines need to operate at ever increasing speed, alternative approaches must be investigated. In this work it is suggested {{to make use of}} the mechanical models of the weighing machine and the load cells to process supplementary accelerometer measurements and compute an effective compensation of the effect of environmental vibrations on load cell response. The technique is here applied to a multi-head weighing machine in order to prove its effectiveness and implementability in industrial devices with real-time controllers...|$|R
40|$|The current {{procedure}} {{for measuring the}} concentration of respirable coal mine dust is as follows. Each filter is preweighed by the filter manufacturer to 210. 1 mg. Following sampling with the Coal Mine Dust Personal Sample Unit (CPSU) at 2. 0 L/min, the filter with coal mine dust is sent to MSHA for weighing. The current MSHA procedure for weighing respirable dust samples uses a Mettler Model AE 163 analytical balance in conjunction with an <b>automatic</b> <b>weighing</b> system with a precision of 210. 02 mg [Tomb 19901. Each balance is calibrated twice per day. Quality control for the <b>automatic</b> <b>weighing</b> system includes the systematic weighing of one in eight filters on a second Mettler AE 163 balance. Tolerance is set at 210. 1 mg between the two weighings of the same sample. Weights are truncated at the 0. 1 mg level (e. g., 3. 457 mg is truncated to 3. 4 mg) [Bowman et al. 19851. The difference of the two truncated weights is then recorded as the weight of coal dust deposited.

40|$|Assessment of food {{requirements}} {{is a key}} feature {{in the evaluation of}} the ecological status of the marine megafauna. However, this remains technically difficult because prey intake by marine top predators occurs mainly under water, out of sight. In this paper, we compare three independent methods currently available for use in quantitative dietary studies: (1) time-energy budget; (2) stomach-temperature measurements; and (3) <b>automatic</b> <b>weighing.</b> To this end, concurrent measurements were performed on Great Cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo carbo) breeding in Normandy. According to the time-energy budget method, breeding males required 690 g of fish while incubating, 1050 g when rearing small chicks, and 1350 g when rearing large chicks; corresponding values for breeding females were 500, 760, and 970 g. These measurements are similar to estimates derived from <b>automatic</b> <b>weighing</b> data, which gave a mean food intake of 540 and 390 g for incubating males and females, 1150 and 830 g for those tending small chicks, and 1410 and 1010 g for those tending large ones, respectively. Stomach-temperature measurements, which can only be performed for birds raising small chicks, were lower (640 g fish in males and 450 g in females) than those obtained using the other two methods. We compare these results with former estimates obtained at the same study site and for other Great Cormorant subspecies and discuss the relative accuracies of the three techniques. Finally, we stress that better assessment of the ecological status of marine top predators requires further technical improvements and additional investigations outside of the reproductive phas...|$|R

40|$|A {{new concept}} for plant {{dependent}} irrigation management in greenhouses {{was developed and}} tested for Ficus benjamina. For precise irrigation control, two plant parameters where introduced in the Penman-Monteith model:the stomatal resistance {{and the amount of}} the transpiring surface. For stomatal resistance, a function of two driving micro-climatic variables, i. e. solar radiation and leaf-air vapour pressure deficit was fitted to porometer measurements of stomatal resistance. To calculate the total amount of the transpiring surface, a Richards growth function based on cumulated values of short wave radiation was used instead of time. It was shown that such a growth function provided very good estimates of leaf surface during both the summer and winter season. To validate the plant dependent Penman-Monteith model, daily sums of calculated evapotranspiration values for 31 selected days were compared to the actual water consumption measured with an <b>automatic</b> <b>weighing</b> system. The deviation between the measurements and the model predictions was very small, being only about 4 %. Hence, the implementation of this model on a climate computer, together with specific information on transpiring leaf surface and stomatal resistance, will allow a very accurate estimation of the actual water needs and will ultimately lead to a method for plant dependent irrigation control...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- At the {{beginning}} of the century the law of conservation of mass in chemical reactions was checked experimentally by Landolt and various other experimenters. Even though in 8 of the 10 chemical reactions studied by Landolt the validity of conservation of mass was confirmed within the margin of experimental errors, in 2 reactions the pre vs. post comparison of the determined weights indicated mass differences that exceeded the experi-mental error by up to a factor of 6, indicating apparent violations of the law of conservation of mass. However by averaging between such results and sub-jective assessments Landolt discarded these deviations. We report on careful and systematic repetitions of one of Landolt's chemical experiments. Using modern sensitive and, in one case, <b>automatic</b> <b>weighing</b> techniques, the results obtained reveal time-dependent and long-range gravitational irregularities which are many orders of magnitude larger than expected relativistic mass ef-fects, indicating an apparent violation of the law of conservation of mass in this special chemical reaction. Similar effects could be found in biological and purely physical systems, as well as synergistic effects between these sys-tems. The observed spontaneous mass fluctuations suggest the existence of a form of cold, dark matter which is detected in the described systems...|$|R

Variation was shown {{to be caused by}} differences in growth rate (r = 0. 698) more than by differences in initial animal weight (r = 0. 092.) The economic value of proper weighing and selection of market animals and reducing the variation was also calculated. Analysis of marketing returns for a group of hogs showed quadratic reductions in return when animals are not marketed at the optimal weight. Missing the optimal marketing for an example group by 4. 5 kg per pig reduced profits by $ 0. 29 to $ 0. 76 /head based on market prices between $ 0. 495 /kg to $ 1. 10 /kg ($ 22. 50 /cwt to $ 50. 00 /cwt). Better management of animal weights can also add profits by increasing average market weights and decreasing weight variation. A Taguchi quadratic loss function predicted additional profits of $ 0. 77 /head by reducing group weight variation from 7. 5 kg to 2. 5 kg. Predicted profit increases for reduced sort loss were in addition to predicted profit increases for improving average market weight...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of careful and {{systematic}} experiments to check the law of conservation of mass in a special chemical reaction in which metallic silver is generated from two homogeneous solutions. 50 ml glass flasks, closed gas-tight, were used as thermodynamically closed systems. Modern, sensitive and <b>automatic</b> <b>weighing</b> techniques were applied, including intensive artifact research, to compare the mass of test and reference flasks with and without the chemical reaction. The results obtained reveal reproducible, highly significant gravitational irregularities compared to baseline pretests without chemical reaction, during which the law of conservation of mass was confirmed within experimental error. Mass deviations were observed of > 2000 g which are up to a factor of 420 {{times larger than the}} 95 % confidence interval c T = 5 g of the baseline pretest and which are by a factor of 10 larger than expected relativistic mass effects. The detected gravitational anomalies indicate an apparent violation of the law of conservation of mass in this special chemical reaction. If the validity of the law of conservation of energy is assumed, the apparent violations of the law of conservation of mass indicate the existence of a previously unknown form of low energetic (i. e., cold), and non-visible (i. e., dark) matter which has been detected by the systems.

40|$|Petrels are {{the most}} {{numerous}} bird group in the waters around Antarctica. During three seasons, Jeroen Creuwels studied the ecology of petrels on small and rocky Ardery Island in Antarctica. Antarctic Petrels and Southern Fulmars need {{more than three months}} to complete their breeding seasons, whereas favourable conditions are restricted to the short Antarctic summer. Despite a different timing of breeding, both species achieved a similar breeding success. The first breeding species was the Antarctic Petrel, but this species lost many eggs early in the season. Extreme snowfall had other unexpected consequences: giant petrels were able to land in the colony. In the first season 10 % of the adult birds were predated and much disturbance was caused which enabled South Polar Skuas to take nearly all eggs. Southern Fulmars are less capable of flying over sea ice and therefore they started breeding more than two weeks later, which resulted in more losses {{at the end of the}} chick phase due to early winter conditions. 	An <b>automatic</b> <b>weighing</b> system provided data on changes in masses of chicks and parents. Chicks of both species were growing equally fast, although chicks of Antarctic Petrels received much less food. Antarctic Petrels flew to more than 300 km to find food for their chicks and they provisioned their chicks with one meal per day. Southern Fulmars foraged closer to the colony and were able to give their chicks almost twice as much food. Probably Antarctic Petrels were able to process more food in the stomach on the way, which resulted in chick meals with a higher energetic value per gram. 	The Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) has designated the Antarctic Petrel as an indicator species for the Antarctic ecosystem. This study shows that local factors can have large effects, which should be taken into account when monitoring of human influences like fishery activities. ...|$|R

A total of 288 crossbred rabbits of both sexes were housed in 18 pens (16 animals per pen), half fed ad libitum and half restricted during the first 3 weeks, and controlled from weaning to slaughter (33 to 75 d of age). At the beginning of the trial, R rabbits had access to feeder for 10 h a day; feeding time increased by 1 h every 3 – 4 d until 16 h/d in the first three weeks; then, feeding time increased by 1 h/d until 24 –h access to feeders in the 4 th week; thereafter, all animals were fed ad libitum.
