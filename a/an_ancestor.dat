5|$|Another Gwenllian (circa 1178 – 1236) married Ednyfed Fychan, seneschal of Gwynedd under Llywelyn the Great, {{and through}} her, Rhys became <b>an</b> <b>ancestor</b> of the Tudor dynasty. Through the Tudors inter-marrying with the House of Stuart Rhys is <b>an</b> <b>ancestor</b> {{to the current}} ruling house of the United Kingdom and also <b>an</b> <b>ancestor</b> of several ruling houses in Europe. When Henry Tudor landed in Pembrokeshire, Wales in 1485 {{to make a bid}} for the throne, his descent from Rhys was one of the factors which enabled him to attract Welsh support (Henry flew a (Welsh) dragon banner at the battle of Bosworth Field).|$|E
5|$|B and T {{lymphocytes}} bearing immunoglobulins and T cell receptors, respectively, {{are found}} in all jawed fishes. Indeed, the adaptive immune {{system as a whole}} evolved in <b>an</b> <b>ancestor</b> of all jawed vertebrate.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} Scottish Heraldry, an armiger {{is someone who}} has {{registered}} {{his or her own}} coat of arms, or has inherited a coat of arms according to the Laws of Arms in Scotland from <b>an</b> <b>ancestor</b> who had arms recorded in the Lyon Register.|$|E
50|$|Ahnentafel, {{also known}} as the Eytzinger Method, Sosa Method, and Sosa-Stradonitz Method, allows for the {{numbering}} of <b>ancestors</b> beginning with <b>a</b> descendant. This system allows one to derive <b>an</b> <b>ancestor's</b> number without compiling the list and allows one to derive <b>an</b> <b>ancestor's</b> relationship based on their number.|$|R

5|$|Once a non-Vedar {{married into}} a Vedar family, {{he or she}} was assimilated as part of the Vedar village. Almost all Vedar {{families}} had <b>an</b> <b>ancestor</b> who was Tamil or a family member who was married to a Tamil from a neighboring village.|$|E
5|$|Philippe François Marie de Hauteclocque {{was born}} on 22 November 1902 at Belloy-Saint-Léonard in the {{department}} of Somme. He was the fifth of six children of Adrien de Hauteclocque, comte de Hauteclocque (1864–1945), and Marie-Thérèse van der Cruisse de Waziers (1870–1956). Philippe was named in honour of <b>an</b> <b>ancestor</b> killed by Croats in 1635.|$|E

5|$|There is {{no doubt}} that the phylum Nemertea is {{monophyletic}} (meaning that the phylum includes all and only descendants of one ancestor that was also a member of the phylum). The synapomorphies (trait shared by <b>an</b> <b>ancestor</b> and all its descendants, but not by other groups) include the eversible proboscis located in the rhynchocoel.|$|E
5|$|Through his daughter, he is <b>an</b> <b>ancestor</b> of the Beauchamp {{family of}} Elmley in Worcestershire, a scion of which, William de Beauchamp, became Earl of Warwick. It {{is likely that}} the Beauchamp family's symbol, a bear, derives from their {{relationship}} to Urse.|$|E
50|$|In a 2002 genetic {{study of}} {{maternal}} and paternal direct lines of ancestry of 800 Puerto Ricans, 61% had mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from <b>an</b> Amerindian female <b>ancestor,</b> 27% inherited MtDNA from <b>a</b> female African <b>ancestor</b> and 12% had MtDNA from <b>a</b> female European <b>ancestor.</b> Conversely, patrilineal direct lines, {{as indicated by}} the Y chromosome, showed that 70% of Puerto Rican males in the sample have Y chromosome DNA from <b>a</b> male European <b>ancestor,</b> 20% inherited Y-DNA from <b>a</b> male African <b>ancestor,</b> and less than 10% inherited Y-DNA from <b>a</b> male Amerindian <b>ancestor.</b> <b>As</b> these tests measure only the DNA along the direct matrilineal and patrilineal lines of inheritance, they cannot tell what total percentage of European or African ancestry any individual has.|$|R

5|$|European music between 800 and 1100 {{became more}} sophisticated, more {{frequently}} requiring instruments capable of polyphony. The 9th-century Persian geographer Ibn Khordadbeh mentioned in his lexicographical discussion of music instruments that, in the Byzantine Empire, typical instruments included the urghun (organ), shilyani (probably {{a type of}} harp or lyre), salandj (probably a bagpipe) and the lyra. The Byzantine lyra, a bowed string instrument, is <b>an</b> <b>ancestor</b> of most European bowed instruments, including the violin.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus also recounts that King Alexander I of Macedonia (<b>an</b> <b>ancestor</b> of Alexander the Great,) who was allied to the Persians {{and present}} in their camp, {{secretly}} rode to the Greek camp {{with a warning}} that the Persians had decided to attack, and that before the main battle Mardonius issued {{a challenge to the}} Spartans to fight a special battle between equal numbers of Spartans and Persians, which was declined. Some historians have called these stories improbable.|$|E
5|$|Hispanic is {{an ethnic}} term {{employed}} to categorize any citizen or {{resident of the}} United States, of any racial background, of any country, and of any religion, who {{has at least one}} ancestor from the people of Spain or is of non-Hispanic origin, but has <b>an</b> <b>ancestor</b> from Mexico, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Central or South America, or some other Hispanic origin. The three largest Hispanic groups in the United States are the Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Cubans.|$|E
5000|$|The term 'haplogroup' {{refers to}} the SNP/unique-event {{polymorphism}} (UEP) mutations that represent the clade to which a collection of particular human haplotypes belong. (Clade here refers {{to a set of}} people sharing <b>a</b> common <b>ancestor.)</b> <b>A</b> haplogroup is a group of similar haplotypes that share <b>a</b> common <b>ancestor</b> with <b>a</b> single-nucleotide polymorphism mutation. Mitochondrial DNA passes along a maternal lineage that can date back thousands of years.|$|R
25|$|According to Mary Boyce, the perplexing {{anomalies}} of Yasht 13 are residual {{traces of}} fravashi cult, which she defines {{as a form}} of <b>a</b> <b>ancestor</b> worship and/or hero-cult that developed during (what she calls) the 'Iranian Heroic Age' (c. 1500 BCE onwards).|$|R
50|$|Uluit {{have been}} found that date back to as early as 2500 BCE. Traditionally, the ulu would be passed down from {{generation}} to generation. It was believed that <b>an</b> <b>ancestor's</b> knowledge was contained within the ulu and thus would also be passed on.|$|R
5|$|In the 11th century, William the Conqueror {{brought the}} Talbot hound to Britain. The Talbot was a {{predominantly}} white, slow, deep-throated, scent hound {{derived from the}} St. Hubert Hound which had been developed in the 8th century. At some point the English Talbots were crossed with Greyhounds {{to give them an}} extra turn of speed. Long extinct, the Talbot strain probably gave rise to the Southern Hound which, in turn, is thought to be <b>an</b> <b>ancestor</b> of the modern-day beagle.|$|E
5|$|In the Tintin adventures, the Unicorn is {{the setting}} of a battle between pirates and sailors {{followed}} by a duel between its captain, Sir Francis Haddock (<b>an</b> <b>ancestor</b> of Captain Haddock) and the pirate Red Rackham. The Unicorn is scuttled and sinks, only to be discovered years later by Tintin and his friends {{in an attempt to}} locate Red Rackham's treasure.|$|E
5|$|Ivan Vladislav left a mixed heritage, varying from a {{reputation}} of being a ruthless murderer to a hero defending his country as best as he could. The descendants of Ivan Vladislav entered the Byzantine nobility and rose to the highest ranks of the hierarchy. Two women of his family became empresses of the Byzantine Empire and others became military commanders or high-ranking officials. He was <b>an</b> <b>ancestor</b> of the Byzantine emperor John II Komnenos.|$|E
50|$|Sahelanthropus may {{represent}} <b>a</b> common <b>ancestor</b> {{of humans and}} chimpanzees, though no consensus has been reached yet by the scientific community. The original placement of this species as <b>a</b> human <b>ancestor</b> but not <b>a</b> chimpanzee <b>ancestor</b> would complicate the picture of human phylogeny. In particular, if Toumaï is indeed <b>a</b> direct human <b>ancestor,</b> then its facial features bring into doubt the status of Australopithecus whose thickened brow ridges were reported {{to be similar to}} those of some later fossil hominins (notably Homo erectus), and where the brow ridge morphology of Sahelanthropus differs from that observed in all australopithecines, most fossil hominins and extant humans.|$|R
5000|$|The {{concept of}} [...] "Proto-Human" [...] presupposes monogenesis (evolution from <b>a</b> common <b>ancestor)</b> of all natural {{languages}} apart from pidgins, creoles, and sign languages. It does not presuppose <b>a</b> common <b>ancestor</b> of these languages with all extinct lineages, whether human or possible Neanderthal languages.|$|R

5|$|Richard Milhous Nixon {{was born}} on January 9, 1913 in Yorba Linda, California, {{in a house that}} was built by his father. His parents were Hannah (Milhous) Nixon and Francis A. Nixon. His mother was a Quaker, and his father {{converted}} from Methodism to the Quaker faith. Nixon was a descendant of the early American settler, Thomas Cornell, who was also <b>an</b> <b>ancestor</b> of Ezra Cornell, the founder of Cornell University, as well as of Jimmy Carter and Bill Gates.|$|E
5|$|Since 1993, Canadians have {{no longer}} been {{eligible}} for the Victoria Cross: that medal has been superseded by the Canadian Victoria Crossof equal honour, but yet to be awarded. The Canadian medal differs only in that the inscription is in Latin rather than English; by using a language that is <b>an</b> <b>ancestor</b> of both English and French, the medal avoids linguistic discrimination between Canada's two official languages.|$|E
5|$|The Platyhelminthes {{excluding}} Acoelomorpha contain {{two main}} groups, Catenulida and Rhabditophora, {{both of which}} are generally agreed to be monophyletic (each contains all and only the descendants of <b>an</b> <b>ancestor</b> that {{is a member of the}} same group). Early molecular phylogenetics analyses of the Catenulida and Rhabditophora left uncertainties about whether these could be combined in a single monophyletic group, but a study in 2008 concluded they could, therefore Platyhelminthes could be redefined as Catenulida plus Rhabditophora, excluding the Acoelomorpha.|$|E
50|$|To {{add to the}} uncertainty, genealogies {{were often}} edited many generations later to improve <b>an</b> <b>ancestor's</b> {{standing}} within <b>a</b> kingdom, or to insert him into a more powerful kindred. The uncertain practices in local kingship cause similar problems when interpreting the succession to the high kingship.|$|R
50|$|Rogers {{commented on}} the partial black ancestry of some {{prominent}} Europeans, including Alexander Pushkin and Alexandre Dumas, père.
