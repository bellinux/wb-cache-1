In New Zealand hospitals, about 25 per cent of all ICU activity was pandemic related and about 12 per cent of patients hospitalised with swine flu were <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ICU.</b> The surge of patients with H1N1 influenza placed substantial strain on staff and resources, hospitals were stretched to the very limit of resources and were at the point where possible alternatives had to be considered. Unlike seasonal influenza strains, which tend to hit elderly people and those of severe underlying health problems more heavily, many of those who became critically ill with the swine flu were babies and middle-aged people, pregnant women, the obese, Pacific Islanders, Maori and Aboriginal patients. Rates of severe illness among Pacific people were seven times higher than the average, while those of Maori were twice as high. Overall, about one-third of patients who was admitted to an ICU because of swine flu had no underlying health problem. The first batch of swine flu vaccine arrived in the country in September. Currently only frontline health workers were in line to get the vaccine, but the Health Ministry is considering on widening access to include other [...] "at risk" [...] groups.|$|E

40|$|Antimicrobial {{resistance}} {{is an increasing}} concern in ICUs worldwide. Infection with an antibiotic resistant (ABR) strain of an organism is associated with greater mortality than infection with the non-resistant strain, but there are few data assessing whether being <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> an intensive care unit (ICU) {{with high levels of}} antimicrobial {{resistance is}} associated with a worse outcome than being <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> an <b>ICU</b> with low rates of resistance. The aim of this study was, therefore, to compare the characteristics of infections and antibiotic treatments and patient outcomes in patients <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ICUs</b> in countries considered as having high levels of antibiotic resistance and those <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ICUs</b> in countries considered as having low levels of antibiotic resistance...|$|R
30|$|Conclusions: The {{number of}} octogenarian {{patients}} <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>ICUs</b> {{has been increasing}} in recent years. Mortality in patients over 80  years of age <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> our <b>ICU</b> {{is higher than the}} overall mortality of our ICU. However, it varies significantly depending on the diagnosis. The initial lactate and APACHE II are also prognostic in this group of patients. The mortality of octogenarians patients <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> our <b>ICU</b> reaches the 50  % after one year of discharge, and those who survive cannot perform a normal daily activity.|$|R

30|$|Severe {{complicated}} influenza including pneumonia, myocarditis and neurologic complications {{are still}} a burden on intensive care units (ICU) nowadays, especially viral or secondary bacteria pneumonia-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [1, 2].
