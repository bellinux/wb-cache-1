50|$|Insourcing is also {{defined as}} {{bringing}} {{a third party}} outsourcer to work inside a company's facility.

In <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>contracting</b> an entire team of workers from an outsourcing provider, outside experts are sometimes hired as consultants (to improve certain processes etc.) and the internal staff thereafter implements their recommendations. It may also refer to bringing in foreign nationals to do jobs at lower wages. An example would be a coal mine which lists a foreign language (i.e. Mandarin Chinese) as a job prerequisite that citizens tend not to study. Since the labour pool {{does not have the}} listed skill a foreign worker permit can be obtained allowing the importation of Chinese workers.|$|R
40|$|In Seaman 2 ̆ 7 s Direct Buying Service, Inc. v. Standard Oil CO., the California Supreme Court affirmed its {{position}} that an insurance carrier may risk tort liability for {{breach of the}} implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>contract</b> damages. Moreover, Seaman 2 ̆ 7 s enabled the court to explore such liability {{in the context of}} an ordinary commercial contract in which 2 ̆ 2 parties of roughly equal bargaining power are free to shape the contours of their agreement. 2 ̆ 2 The Seaman 2 ̆ 7 s majority deemed it unnecessary to find tort liability on the breach of the implied covenant issue. Instead the court created a more limited area of tort liability - the so-called tort of 2 ̆ 2 stonewalling 2 ̆ 2 - in which the breaching party denies, in bad faith and without probable cause, the existence of a <b>contract</b> <b>to</b> shield itself from liability. This narrowly defined tort may well have ramifications on freedom of contract and affect the future of commercial contract negotiation. The essence of freedom of contract lies in the parties assuming responsibility for making enforceable contracts. This freedom also permits the parties <b>to</b> breach their <b>contracts,</b> resulting in liability to the other party for compensatory damages. Parties in an ordinary commercial contract who have mutually agreed on their obligations and expectations subject to specified covenants, conditions and remedies may not look favorably upon the imposition of tort liability for breach of <b>contract</b> in <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> traditional <b>contract</b> damages...|$|R

40|$|Wave functions, {{energies}}, and binding energies for {{the lowest}} singlet states of H- and He in uniform magnetic fields B 3 ̆c 109 G are calculated using an adiabatic approximation in hyperspherical coordinates. In computing the angular part of the wave functions, a coupled expansion in one-electron oblate spheroidal angle functions is used. In <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>contracting</b> the two-electron wave function radially, the magnetic field is found to distort the angular part of the wave function mainly by reducing the ss 1 S character {{of the state and}} replacing it with an sd 1 D character. Results for energies and binding energies are comparable with those obtained in variational calculations. In order to compute the binding energies of H- and He we have also calculated the binding energies of the ground states of H and He+ in uniform magnetic fields B 3 ̆c 109 G using the adiabatic oblate-spheroidal-coordinate method of Starace and Webster...|$|R
