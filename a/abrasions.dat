40|$|In {{order to}} explore a new method for testing the fabric <b>abrasion</b> resistance, a {{homemade}} <b>abrasion</b> tester is designed and manufactured. The principle, structure and test method of the homemade <b>abrasion</b> tester are introduced. The crease points on fabrics are rubbed using the <b>abrasion</b> tester under certain air pressure and the <b>abrasion</b> of fabrics is reflected on real time through the change of gas flow. The change of gas flow is converted into equivalent aperture by Bernoulli equation and the equivalent aperture is {{used to evaluate the}} <b>abrasion</b> resistance of the crease point on fabric. Three measuring parameters of friction velocity, gas pressure and fabric thickness influencing on the <b>abrasion</b> resistance of crease point on down fabrics are tested by orthogonal experiment.

The results show that the homemade <b>abrasion</b> tester can represent the <b>abrasion</b> resistance of crease point under certain conditions. The gas pressure and fabric thickness have significant influence on the <b>abrasion</b> resistance, but the influence of friction velocity is not significant.

40|$|Graduation date: 1972 The {{purpose of}} the study was to compare the effects of certain <b>abrasion</b> {{procedures}} upon specific physical properties of a high wet modulus rayon. The type of <b>abrasion</b> applied included surface <b>abrasion</b> in dry and wet condition, edge <b>abrasion</b> in dry condition, and flexing <b>abrasion</b> in dry condition. Dry flexing <b>abrasion</b> was performed only in the Stoll tester but all other <b>abrasion</b> procedures were performed both in the Accelerator and Stoll tester. Breaking load or bursting strength, elongation, weight of fabric and microscopy were the criteria used to evaluate <b>abrasion</b> damage. Five null hypotheses were tested to determine whether any significant correlations existed (1) among the percentage losses in physical properties or (2) between period of <b>abrasion</b> and the percentage losses in physical properties as a result of abrasion; to determine whether any significant differences in the percentage losses in physical properties occurred (3) between warpwise and fillingwise abraded specimens or (4) between specimens abraded wet and dry; and to determine (5) whether each side of a specimen was evenly abraded in the Accelerotor. Analysis of data obtained was based on the regression analysis and the t-test. Damage of the fabric, yarn and fiber observed under a microscope seemed to increase with the increasing period of <b>abrasion.</b> The yarn and fabric tended to deteriorate continuously. Fibrillation of the fiber was observed at the end point on specimens subjected to wet surface <b>abrasion</b> in the Stoll tester. Correlations among the percentage losses in physical properties were positive and generally significant. The rate change in physical properties had a positive linear relationship with period of <b>abrasion.</b> Some <b>abrasion</b> procedures had significantly different effects upon certain physical properties of warpwise specimens and filling specimens. There were significantly greater percentage losses in breaking load and weight of specimens subjected to dry surface <b>abrasion</b> than to wet surface <b>abrasion</b> in the Accelerotor. Each side of specimens subjected to dry surface <b>abrasion</b> in the Accelerotor was unevenly abraded in terms of the percentage losses in breaking load and elongation, and those subjected to wet surface <b>abrasion</b> in the Accelerotor were unevenly abraded in terms of the percentage losses in elongation. It was concluded that different <b>abrasion</b> procedures affected a physical property differently, and a given procedure of <b>abrasion</b> affected various properties of the fabric differently...|$|R
5|$|The eyes of baleen {{whales are}} {{relatively}} small for their size and are positioned {{near the end of}} the mouth. This is probably because they feed on slow or immobile prey, combined with the fact that most sunlight does not pass , and hence they do not need acute vision. A whale's eye is adapted for seeing both in the euphotic and aphotic zones by increasing or decreasing the pupil's size to prevent damage to the eye. As opposed to land mammals which have a flattened lens, whales have a spherical lens. The retina is surrounded by a reflective layer of cells (tapetum lucidum), which bounces light back at the retina, enhancing eyesight in dark areas. However, light is bent more near the surface of the eye when in air as opposed to water; consequently, they can see much better in the air than in the water. The eyeballs are protected by a thick outer layer to prevent <b>abrasions,</b> and an oily fluid (instead of tears) on the surface of the eye. Baleen whales appear to have limited color vision, as they lack S-cones.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this study, {{several kinds}} of {{flexible}} protective materials sprayed with polyurea elastomers (hereinafter referred to as polyurea elastomer protective material) were adopted to meet the <b>abrasion</b> resistance requirement of hydraulic structures, and their <b>abrasion</b> resistances against the water flow with suspended load or bed load were studied systematically through tests. Natural basalt stones were adopted as the abrasive for simulation of the <b>abrasion</b> effect of the water flow with bed load, and test {{results indicate that the}} basalt stone is suitable for use in the <b>abrasion</b> resistance test of the flexible protective material. The wear process of the polyurea elastomer protective material is stable, and the wear loss is linear with the time of <b>abrasion.</b> If the wear thickness is regarded as the <b>abrasion</b> resistance evaluation factor, the <b>abrasion</b> resistance of the 351 pure polyurea is about twice those of pure polyurea {{with a high level of}} hardness and aliphatic polyurea, and over five times that of high-performance abrasion-resistant concrete under the <b>abrasion</b> of the water flow with suspended load. It is also about 50 times that of high-performance abrasion-resistant concrete under the <b>abrasion</b> of the water flow with bed load. Overall, the <b>abrasion</b> resistance of pure polyurea presented a decreasing trend with increasing hardness. Pure polyurea with a Shore hardness of D 30 has the best <b>abrasion</b> resistance, which is 60 to 70 times that of high-performance abrasion-resistant concrete under the <b>abrasion</b> of the water flow with bed load, and has been recommended, among the five kinds of pure polyurea materials with different hardness, in anti-abrasion protection of hydraulic structures...|$|R

Different models include {{one or more of these}} parameters. Some of the previous experiments has come to different conclusions, possible reasons for these differences has been discussed. A detailed description of the NTNU Ice <b>Abrasion</b> Laboratory is given. The <b>abrasion</b> test apparatus is based on the sliding contact <b>abrasion</b> test principle. A concrete specimen is mounted and an ice cylinder is slid on top of the concrete with applied pressure. Pressure, speed and temperature are all fully controllable to create different test scenarios. A custom made National Instruments LabView program is used to control, monitor and log the activities in the <b>abrasion</b> laboratory. Ice <b>abrasion</b> testing has been done at the NTNU Ice <b>Abrasion</b> Laboratory, investigating a possible difference in <b>abrasion</b> rate for identical concrete with unlike initial treatment. A total of four concretes sample were tested.

The concrete samples have not been stored in best possible way before testing, which may have caused them to weaken. Secondly the ice <b>abrasion</b> machine has a weakness somewhere under the concrete sample. Either the concrete bedding its bearings or the load sensors yields during testing allowing the concrete to tilt up and down as the ice moves back and forth.
