5|$|The Vedic {{literature}} reveres various goddesses, but {{far less}} frequently than gods Indra, Agni and Soma. Yet, they are declared equivalent aspects of gender neutral Brahman, of Prajapati and Purusha. The goddesses often {{mentioned in the}} Vedic layers of text include the Ushas (dawn), Vac (speech, wisdom), Sarasvati (as river), Prithivi (earth), Nirriti (<b>annihilator),</b> Shraddha (faith, confidence). Goddesses such as Uma appear in the Upanishads as another aspect of Brahman and the knower of ultimate knowledge, such as in section 3 and 4 of the ancient Kena Upanishad.|$|E

The remaining five robots then fought again, eliminating another, and so on until one robot remained and was declared the winner. Razer outlasted Vercingetorix, SpawnofScutter, Behemoth and AttilatheDrum to set up a final against Onslaught. An attack by Razer's arm on one of Onslaught's rear wheels saw its adversary shed a tyre, lose grip, and drive into an area patrolled by Matilda. The house robot flipped Onslaught onto its side, rendering it immobile. Assured of victory, Razer attacked and badly damaged Matilda's bodywork and rear shell.|$|E

25|$|James Maybrick (24 October 1838 – 11 May 1889) was a Liverpool cotton merchant. His wife Florence {{was convicted}} of {{poisoning}} him with arsenic in a sensational, and possibly unjust, trial presided over by Sir James Fitzjames Stephen, the father of another modern suspect James Kenneth Stephen. In her book, Jack the Ripper: The American Connection author Shirley Harrison asserted James Maybrick was both Jack the Ripper and the Servant Girl <b>Annihilator</b> of Austin, Texas. A diary purportedly by Maybrick, published in the 1990s by Michael Barrett, contains a confession to the Ripper murders. In 1995, Barrett confessed to writing the diary himself, and described the process of counterfeiting the diary in detail. He swore under oath {{that he and his}} wife, Anne, had forged it. Anne Barrett, after their divorce, later denied forgery, and their story changed several times over the years. The diary was discredited by historians who pointed to factual errors in relation to some of the crimes, and document experts pronounced the diary a fake; the handwriting does not match that of Maybrick's will, and the ink contains a preservative not marketed until 1974.|$|E

Further issues within the band caused frontman and guitarist Dave Mustaine to fire drummer Chuck Behler and guitarist Jeff Young, and canceled their scheduled 1988 Australian tour. Nick Menza, previously Behler's drum tech, was hired as the band's new drummer. The search for a new guitarist was a drawn out process; Mustaine examined a number of guitarists for the job, including Dimebag Darrell of Pantera and Jeff Waters of <b>Annihilator,</b> and the former was initially offered the job before declining. According to Mustaine, one of the last guitarists he had heard about, Marty Friedman, had sent him a copy of Dragon's Kiss, on which Friedman played. Upon listening to the record, Mustaine had Friedman come in to audition and hired him. This would become the band's first stable line-up.|$|E

In the realm of algebraic attacks, there is one major concern that, for a given Boolean polynomial f, if f or f 1 has low degree <b>annihilators.</b> Existing methods for computing all <b>annihilators</b> within degree d of f in n variables, such as Gauss elimination and interpolation, have a complexity based on the parameter k(n,d) = Sigma(d) (i= 0) ((n) (i)), which increases dramatically with n. As a result, these methods are impractical when dealing with sparse polynomials with a large n, which widely appear in modern cipher systems. In this paper, we present a new tool for computing <b>annihilators,</b> the characters w. r. t. a Boolean polynomial. We prove that the existence of <b>annihilators</b> of f and f 1 7 -esp. relies on the zero characters and the critical characters zu. r. t. f. Then we present a new algorithm for computing <b>annihilators</b> whose complexity relies on lef,d, the number of zero or critical characters within degree d w. r. t. f. Since 16,d << k(n,d) when f is sparse, this algorithm is very efficient for sparse polynomials with a large n.
