40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the therapeutic {{effect of a}} new warm moist air device assisted with eyelid massage {{in the treatment of}} office dry eye(ODE). METHODS: Sixty ODE patients were recruited, and these patients were randomly divided into two groups. One group received <b>artificial</b> <b>tear</b> treatment, and the other group received a new eyelid warm moist air device combined with eyelid massage treatment. Subjects completed the ocular surface disease index(OSDI), which was followed by fluorescein tear breakup time(BUT), corneal fluorescein staining(CFS), Schirmer I test(SⅠt) and meibomian gland secretion function evaluation at baseline, and 2 and 4 wk after treatment. RESULTS: In these 60 patients, 48 patients(23 in <b>artificial</b> <b>tear</b> treated group and 25 in the new warm moist air device assisted with eyelid massage treated group) were positive for meibomian gland dysfunction(MGD). Compared to <b>artificial</b> <b>tear</b> treatment, the new warm moist air device assisted with eyelid massage treatment showed favorable therapeutic effect on OSDI(F Group = 41. 63, P F Group = 60. 47, P F Group = 12. 12, P F Group = 0. 17, P > 0. 05), CFS(F Group = 1. 79, P > 0. 05) and meibomian gland expressibility(F Group = 0. 68, P > 0. 05) between the two groups during 4 wk treatment. CONCLUSION: This new eyelid warm moist air device assisted with eyelid massage has favorable therapeutic effect over <b>artificial</b> <b>tear</b> in ODE treatment...|$|R

40|$|Aim: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare and assess the {{efficacy}} of hypoallergen adhesive tape, antibiotic ointment, <b>artificial</b> <b>tear</b> liquid gel and ocular lubricant pomade for perioperative protection of eyes under general anesthesia in prone position. Material and Method: One hundred and eighty four patients (368 eyes) undergoing general anesthesia for > 90 min for spinal procedures were divided randomly into four groups. Hypoallergen adhesive tape, antibiotic ointment, <b>artificial</b> <b>tear</b> liquid gel or ocular lubricant pomade was applied into the eyes. The patients underwent complete ophthalmic examination, including corrected visual acuity measurement, basal tear production, corneal and conjunctival staining both before and after surgery. Results: Basal tear production was reduced in all groups compared to preoperative values (P 0. 05). There was no difference between pre and postoperative visual acuity. Discussion: All of the methods are suitable for protecting corneal injuries. But none of them is good enough to avoid temporary symptoms in postoperative period. During general anesthesia eyes need protection either by tape, gel, ointment or pomade to reduce the incidence of corneal injuries...|$|R

40|$|AIMS/BACKGROUND—The aim of {{this study}} was to assess quantitatively the {{effectiveness}} of hyaluronan on corneal disruption in patients with dry eye. Corneal epithelial barrier function was evaluated by measuring fluorescein permeability using a slit-lamp fluorophotometer.  METHODS— 11 patients with dry eye were assigned to this study. Hyaluronan ophthalmic solution (0. 1 % hyaluronic acid) was instilled five times a day to the right eye, in addition to the usual <b>artificial</b> <b>tear</b> solutions. The left eye received only the <b>artificial</b> <b>tear</b> solutions. Corneal barrier function was evaluated on the pretreatment day, and at 2  and 4  weeks after treatment. Fluorophotometry was used to measure fluorescein uptake at the central and lower corneal portions.  RESULTS—Two weeks after treatment, hyaluronan treated right corneas showed significant corneal epithelial barrier improvement in the lower portion, compared with the pretreatment day (p< 0. 025). Four weeks after treatment, the treated corneas showed significant improvement in the central corneal portion (p< 0. 025) and improvement in the lower portion, compared with the pretreatment day. The untreated left corneas, on the other hand showed no improvement during the course of the study.  CONCLUSION—This study suggests that hyaluronan is effective in the treatment of corneal epithelial disruption in dry eye. ...|$|R

After 4 -week treatment, the low tear meniscus parameters including tear meniscus height (TMH), tear meniscus depth (TMD), and tear meniscus area (TMA) in the acupuncture group increased significantly for the LTD and Non-SSDE subgroups compared with both the baseline and the control groups (all P values < 0. 05), but not for the SSDE.

Antioxidants, such as iodide, have shown a strong effect in preventing the oxidative damage to constituents of the anterior part of the eye. In this clinical trial the effectiveness of iodide iontophoresis and iodide application without current in moderate to severe dry eye patients was compared. Methods: 16 patients were treated with iodide iontophoresis and 12 patients with iodide application without current for 10 days.

40|$|AIM—This {{study was}} {{designed}} to examine whether trehalose could protect corneal epithelial cells in culture from death by desiccation in order to test trehalose as a potential new eye drop for dry eye syndrome.  METHODS—Human corneal epithelial cells in near confluent culture in wells of a 96  well multidish were preincubated for 15  minutes with 2,  20,  50,  100, or 200  mM trehalose or maltose in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), PBS alone, or three kinds of commercially available <b>artificial</b> <b>tear</b> substitutes (one with borate buffered saline and the other two containing either hydroxyethylcellulose or hyaluronan). The medium was aspirated completely and cells were left dry for 30  minutes at room temperature in room humidity. Live cells and dead cells were visualised by fluorescent dyes and counted for statistical analysis.  RESULTS—The percentage of dead corneal epithelial cells after desiccation was significantly lower in preincubation with 50,  100, and 200  mM trehalose, compared with preincubation with PBS alone (p< 0. 0001, Kruskal-Wallis test, and p< 0. 05, Tukey-Kramer test). Trehalose at the concentration of 20  mM or lower, maltose at any concentrations, and commercially available <b>artificial</b> <b>tear</b> substitutes did not protect corneal epithelial cells from death by desiccation.  CONCLUSIONS—Trehalose at 50,  100, and 200  mM protected corneal epithelial cells in culture from death by desiccation.

40|$|Abstract Background Contact lens-related {{infections are}} often {{associated}} with inadequate contact lens hygiene, and therefore, contact lens care products {{should be able to}} sufficiently minimise the amount of pathogens that are responsible for these infections. In 2001, the EN ISO 14729 was introduced to ensure adequate disinfection efficacy of contact lens care solutions, but this norm has recently been criticised. Methods In this study, six frequently used contact lens care solutions were retested according to the Stand Alone Test of the EN ISO 14729 (2001). The Stand Alone Test is a quantitative suspension test. In addition, the products were tested in a modified setting adding an organic load. The load was a mixture of human blood serum, lysozyme, and mucine, which resembles tear fluid. Results The criteria of the Stand Alone Test recommended in EN ISO 14729 were only met by Aosept Plus. This 3 % hydrogen-peroxide-based contact lens care solution attained a reduction factor of > 5 log units for bacteria and > 4 for fungi in all cases. Two further contact lens care solutions, Blue Vision and Optifree Replenish, met the criteria of a reduction factor of > 3 log units for bacteria and > 1 log unit for fungi, but only in the presence of <b>artificial</b> <b>tear</b> fluid. The three remaining products did not exhibit adequate disinfecting efficacy, at least against one of the tested microorganisms. Conclusions Through the observation that the <b>artificial</b> <b>tear</b> fluid used in this study influences the disinfecting efficacy of contact lens care solutions, especially that of multi-purpose solutions, in a different way than does albumin, mucine, or even the organic load suggested in EN ISO 14729, it becomes obvious that the test conditions in the EN ISO 14729 should be revised in order to create more realistic conditions, e. g., by using a more realistic <b>artificial</b> <b>tear</b> fluid. Furthermore, we suggest adapting the EN ISO 14729 to the European test hierarchy for chemical disinfectants and antiseptics, which consists of three test phases and also requests meeting stricter criteria in order to pass the test. Unless the test conditions guarantee a sufficient reduction of potential pathogens, the risk of contact lens-related microbial keratitis and other infections will remain for the users. </p...|$|R
