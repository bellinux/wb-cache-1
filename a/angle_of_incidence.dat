5|$|In a {{visit to}} Los Alamos in September 1944, von Neumann showed that the {{pressure}} increase from explosion shock wave reflection from solid objects was greater than previously believed if the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>incidence</b> of the shock wave was between 90° and some limiting angle. As a result, {{it was determined that}} the effectiveness of an atomic bomb would be enhanced with detonation some kilometers above the target, rather than at ground level.|$|E
5|$|Low-energy {{electron}} diffraction (LEED) is {{a method}} of bombarding a crystalline material with a collimated beam of electrons and then observing the resulting diffraction patterns to determine {{the structure of the}} material. The required energy of the electrons is typically in the range 20–200eV. The reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED) technique uses the reflection of a beam of electrons fired at various low angles to characterize the surface of crystalline materials. The beam energy is typically in the range 8–20keV and the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>incidence</b> is 1–4°.|$|E

5|$|Another {{feature of}} the wing was its washout. The {{trailing}} edge of the wing twisted slightly upward along its span, the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>incidence</b> decreasing from +2° at its root to -½° at its tip. This caused the wing roots to stall before the tips, reducing tip-stall that could otherwise {{have resulted in a}} wing drop, often leading to a spin. As the wing roots started to stall, the separating air stream started to buffet (vibrate) the aircraft, warning the pilot, and hence allowing even relatively inexperienced pilots to fly the aircraft to the limits of its performance. This washout was first featured in the wing of the Type 224 and became a consistent feature in subsequent designs leading to the Spitfire. The complexity of the wing design, especially the precision required to manufacture the vital spar and leading-edge structures, at first caused some major hold-ups in the production of the Spitfire. The problems increased when the work was put out to subcontractors, most of whom had never dealt with metal-structured, high-speed aircraft. By June 1939, most of these problems had been resolved, and production was no longer held up by a lack of wings.|$|E
5|$|The wings {{were of a}} broad 55 m² (590ft²) {{area and}} had a span of 18 m (59ft 0⅝ in) with a {{straight}} leading edge which curved in a near-perfect semicircle into the trailing edge. The positions of the wing roots were offset. The leading edge wing root merged with {{the top of the}} fuselage and cockpit. As the wing extended backwards, by roughly two thirds, it declined downwards at a sharp angle so that the trailing edge wing root ended nearly halfway {{down the side of the}} fuselage increasing the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>incidence.</b> This design feature was used on all future Dornier bomber designs, namely the Dornier Do 217. The trailing edge was faired into the round fuselage shape. The engine nacelle was also faired into the flaps. The extreme rear of the nacelle was hollow and allowed the flap with an attached vertical slot to fit into the cavity when deployed.|$|E

40|$|Computer {{simulation}} of radar imagery {{was used to}} investigate spaceborne stereo radar. The major conclusions reached are that stereo pairs representing different <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>incidence</b> with the same look-direction appear best and that the <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>incidence</b> and stereo intersection angle be matched to the slope and relief of terrain. A parametric tradeoff analysis was performed for eleven different <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>incidence</b> over three different model areas. The eleven angles spanned the range from small- to large-incidence angles. The three model areas were selected as typical of relatively flat, moderately rough, and mountainous terrain.

25|$|The law of {{reflection}} {{says that the}} reflected ray lies in the plane of incidence, and the angle {{of reflection}} equals the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>incidence.</b>|$|E
25|$|When light travels from {{a medium}} {{with a higher}} {{refractive}} index to one with a lower refractive index, Snell's law seems to require in some cases (whenever the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>incidence</b> is large enough) that the sine of the angle of refraction be greater than one. This of course is impossible, and the light in such cases is completely reflected by the boundary, a phenomenon known as total internal reflection. The largest possible <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>incidence</b> which still results in a refracted ray is called the critical angle; {{in this case the}} refracted ray travels along the boundary between the two media.|$|E

25|$|The Paalson Type 1, (Pålson), was a Swedish single-seat sport {{aircraft}} {{built around}} 1920.

25|$|The action {{principle}} is preceded by earlier ideas in optics. In ancient Greece, Euclid {{wrote in his}} Catoptrica that, for the path of light reflecting from a mirror, the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>incidence</b> equals the angle of reflection.

25|$|The {{distinguishing}} feature of Paalson's biplane designs, the Type 1 sporting single-seater {{and the six}} passenger Type 2, was a mechanism allowing the alteration of the position and <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>incidence</b> of the upper wing.

Various film plastic greenhouse-cladding materials were measured under laboratory conditions using a spectroradiometer equipped with an integrating sphere. Films were measured over a range <b>of</b> <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>incidence</b> and the effect of increasing distance between double films was also measured. PAR transmission remained nearly constant for <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>incidence</b> increased up to 30 degrees but fell rapidly thereafter as the <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>incidence</b> increased up to 90 degrees.

50|$|The {{distance}} of the exit pupil from the sensor plane determines the range <b>of</b> <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>incidence</b> that light will make with the sensor. Digital image sensors often have a limited range <b>of</b> <b>angles</b> over which they will efficiently accept light, especially those that use microlenses to increase their sensitivity. The closer the exit pupil to the focal plane, the higher the <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>incidence</b> at the extreme edges of the field. This can lead to pixel vignetting. For this reason, many small digital cameras (such as those found in cell phones) are image-space telecentric.|$|R

25|$|Due to {{the engine}} being mounted above the center of gravity, power was highly {{stabilizing}} (addition of power would push the nose down), {{which could have been}} disconcerting to pilots. Initially, Piper designers incorporated an automatic pitch trim system to coordinate horizontal stabilizer <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>incidence</b> with power setting. This system was later replaced by a vectored thrust nozzle, developed by Williams International, which resulted in reduced weight and simplified manufacturing processes.|$|E
25|$|The wings were {{fitted with}} slotted flaps and full length {{leading edge slats}} and could be folded for compact, ship-board stowage. They also had a {{variable}} <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>incidence,</b> pivoting at the front spar and actuated by an electrically driven jackscrew attached to the rear spar. This arrangement reduced stalling speed and increased lift, allowing the aircraft to use a smaller wing – compactness being an important feature for a ship-borne aircraft.|$|E
