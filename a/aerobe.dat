40|$|ABSTRACT This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effects of Joule heating and hydrostatic pressure on reduction of total <b>aerobes</b> and spores of Bacillus cereus in four kinds of sauces prepared with traditional Korean fermented foods. Total <b>aerobes</b> and inoculated spores of B. cereus in sauces were assayed after treatment or during storage at 30 °C after 4 or 8 weeks. Joule heating (85 °C), hydrostatic pressure (550 Mpa, 5 min), and antimicrobial additive (3 % ethanol) were separately applied or combined as a hurdle technique. A 1. 0 ～ 2. 0 log reduction in total <b>aerobes</b> of Doenjang and Gochujang sauce was observed upon Joule heating at 80, 85, and 95 °C. Significant reductions (0. 92 ～ 1. 21 log/ 0. 5 ～ 1. 38 log and 1. 26 ～ 1. 7 log/ 0. 47 ～ 3. 45 log) of total aerobes/spores of B. cereus in Doenjang and Gochujang sauce, respectively, occurred upon JA (Joule+additive), JP (Joule+hydrostatic pressure) or JAP (Joule+addi-tive+hydrostatic pressure). Effects of each treatments were maintained or increased during storage for 8 weeks at 30 °C, suggesting that total <b>aerobes</b> and spores of B. cereus in Doenjang and Gochujang sauce can be controlled throug...|$|R

40|$|This study {{assessed}} total <b>aerobes</b> and anaerobes in {{vacuum packaged}} ‘wara’ a West African soft white cheese processed {{with lemon juice}} as coagulant. The cheese was treated with Carica papaya (Vcpc), Terminalia cattapa (Vtcc) crude extracts, nisin (Vnc), and {{the combination of these}} three treatments (V+ 3) and stored at 15 and 28 ºC for a three weeks storage period. The total <b>aerobes</b> and anaerobes were suppressed to an undetectable level (< 1. 00 logcfu/mL) in Vcpc at 15 ºC {{in the first week of}} storage. In Vtcc the total <b>aerobes</b> which was initially 6. 24 logcfu/mL in the first week of storage was suppressed to 3. 16 log cfu/mL by the 3 rd week of storage. Inhibition of microbes was not apparent in Vnc and V+ 3. Significant differences occurred in the microbial count at the two storage temperatures and storage weeks (p< 0. 05). It can therefore be concluded from this work that Vacuum packaging and addition of crude extracts (Carica papaya, Terminalia cattapa) in soft cheese storage can suppress total <b>aerobes</b> and anaerobes) Therefore their use in extension of the shelf-life of soft cheese is recommended...|$|R
40|$|Anaerobic {{bacteria}} predominate in {{the normal}} human fecal flora, out-numbering <b>aerobes</b> at least 100 to one. The two most prevalent organisms are Bacteroides fragilis and Bifidobacterium. Ileostomy flora is, on the other hand, chiefly aerobic and the total count is lower (108 per ml of fluid, compared to 1010 per gram for feces). In normal people, small bowel bacterial counts are generally 105 per ml or less. The upper small bowel consists primarily of Gram-positive <b>aerobes</b> in small numbers. In the terminal ileum, counts are higher and <b>aerobes</b> and anaerobes are present in equal numbers. In the presence of acute obstruction and certain bowel stasis or other syndromes, the small bowel flora may become relatively profuse and fecal in type.

Those data indicated that carcasses were contaminated with bacteria mainly during dehairing and operations on the head. When carcasses were pasteurized after head removal, the numbers of total <b>aerobes</b> on dressed carcasses were reduced by about 1 order and the numbers of coliforms and E. coli were reduced by more than 2 orders of magnitude.

50|$|Microbial synergy is a {{phenomenon}} in which aerobic and anaerobic microbes support each other's growth and proliferation. In this process <b>aerobes</b> invade and destroy host tissues, reduce tissue oxygen concentration and redox potential and thus create favorable conditions for anaerobic growth and proliferation. Anaerobes grow and produce short chain fatty acids such as butyric acid, propionic acid. These short chain fatty acids inhibit phagocytosis of <b>aerobes.</b> Thus <b>aerobes</b> grow, proliferate and destroy more tissues. Microbial synergy complicates and delays the healing of surgical and other chronic wounds or ulcers such as. Microbial synergy also helps with eliminating oxygen redox.this allows the growth of organisms without the effects of oxygen reacting negatively. As a result, Microbial growth increases because other organisms can grow {{in the absence of}} Oxygen redox. Diabetic foot ulcers, venous ulcers, pressure ulcers etc.|$|R
40|$|The {{efficacy}} of water rinsing and chlorine treatment {{in reducing the}} microbial contamination of some fresh vegetables was evaluated. Vegetable samples, including carrots, lettuce and parsley were subjected to water rinsing and chlorine dip (20 ppm for 10 min). The total <b>aerobes</b> and coliforms were enumerated before and after treatments. Vegetable samples, artificially inoculated with Salmonella enteritidis were also subjected to chlorine dipping. Residual Salmonella enteritidis was enumerated after inoculation and chlorine treatment. Fresh vegetable samples, in general relatively high counts. Total aerobic counts ranged from 5. 62 to 7. 47 log CFU/g while total coliforms ranged from 3. 64 to 6. 20 log CFU/g. Water rinsing and the chlorine treatment, overall, were significantly (p≤ 0. 05) effective in reducing both the total <b>aerobes</b> and total coliforms on vegetables. Water risings resulted, on the average, in reducing the total <b>aerobes</b> and coliforms by about 1. 4 and 0. 79 log cycle, respectively. The chlorine dip was significantly (p≤ 0. 05) more effective than water rinsing in reducing both total <b>aerobes</b> and coliforms. It resulted in 2. 37 and 1. 37 log cycle reduction in total <b>aerobes</b> and coliforms, respectively. Salmonella entertidis were recovered on artificially inoculated fresh vegetables in a concentration ranging from 6. 0 to 6. 67 log CFU/g. After the exposure to the chlorine solution, the count was reduced by 0. 92 to 2. 35 log cycles. It was concluded that, although the thorough cleaning of salad vegetables with water or chlorine dip would greatly reduce their microbial load, elimination of all microbes would not be achieved...|$|R
