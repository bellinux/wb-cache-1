A High frequency direction finding system was added on a pole mast aft. The ship also received <b>a</b> <b>Type</b> 242 IFF system. Two 4.7-inch guns were removed, one each forward and aft, and the forward gun was replaced by a Hedgehog anti-submarine spigot mortar. The 3-inch anti-aircraft gun amidships was also removed, but the number of 20mm AA guns was increased to six.|$|E

5|$|During {{this time}} she {{received}} her first radars. By August 1943 she mounted <b>a</b> <b>Type</b> 286 target indication set as well as <b>a</b> <b>Type</b> 285 anti-aircraft gunnery radar. By January 1944 she had received <b>a</b> <b>Type</b> 291 air warning radar. Her light AA armament had also been augmented by six Oerlikon 20 mm autocannon, three {{on each side of}} the roof of the large workshop abaft the funnel. In 1944 Vindictive was converted into a destroyer depot ship and her AA armament was reinforced by the addition of six more Oerlikons. Later that year, the 4-inch guns were removed and eight additional Oerlikons were added. In 1945 she received an additional six Oerlikons.|$|E

5|$|Musashi {{was built}} with <b>a</b> <b>Type</b> 0 {{hydrophone}} system in her bow. It was only usable while stationary or at low speed.

Two Type 22 surface-search radars were installed on the forward superstructure in July 1943.

40|$|Adenoviruses (Ads) are an {{important}} cause of respiratory illness, conjunctivitis, and gastroenteritis, but they are seldom recognized as a potential cause of sexually transmitted disease. We performed virus cultures on approximately 7, 000 patients attending a sexually transmitted disease clinic or other health department clinics {{for the evaluation of}} genital ulcers, urethritis, or conjunctivitis. Ads were isolated from genital or conjunctival specimens obtained from 23 (0. 33 %) patients. Among the 20 Ad-positive men, 15 (75 %) had urethritis, 12 (60 %) had conjunctivitis, and 10 (50 %) had both. All three Ad-positive women had vaginal discharge and genital ulcers or fissures. Ad isolates from 17 patients were available for serotyping. <b>Ad</b> <b>type</b> 37 was isolated from 14 patients, <b>Ad</b> <b>type</b> 8 was isolated from 2 patients, and <b>Ad</b> <b>type</b> 2 was isolated from 1 patient. In three of the <b>Ad</b> <b>type</b> 37 cases, <b>Ad</b> was recovered from both urethral and conjunctival specimens. One of the <b>Ad</b> <b>type</b> 8 cases had conjunctivitis, but the <b>Ad</b> <b>type</b> 2 case did not.
