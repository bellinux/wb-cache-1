5|$|Agricultural and {{forestry}} work were the traditional {{uses of the}} Finnhorse.

The climate and conditions of Finland necessitated that the breed be durable <b>and</b> <b>hardy.</b> As a result, the Finnhorse remained small but tough, and could pull heavy loads in difficult terrain and even in chest-deep snow. Relative to its size, the Finnhorse is among the most powerful workhorses in the world with the best animals able to pull as much as 200percent of their own weight.|$|E
