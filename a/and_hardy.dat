5|$|Agricultural and {{forestry}} work were the traditional {{uses of the}} Finnhorse. The Finnhorse was never bred to be a particularly large or heavy draught horse, {{as it was the}} only horse breed of the country, and versatility was desired as the Finnhorse was also used as the primary steed of the cavalry. The climate and conditions of Finland necessitated that the breed be durable <b>and</b> <b>hardy.</b> As a result, the Finnhorse remained small but tough, and could pull heavy loads in difficult terrain and even in chest-deep snow. Relative to its size, the Finnhorse is among the most powerful workhorses in the world with the best animals able to pull as much as 200percent of their own weight.|$|E
