The major portion of the sodium stored at ANL-W is radioactively contaminated.

40|$|Interstitial inflammation, sodium retention, and the {{pathogenesis}} of nephrotic edema: A unifying hypothesis. BackgroundThe pathophysiology of edema in the nephrotic syndrome is controversial. Some investigators believe that sodium retention may result from a primary renal defect that causes an “overfilled” blood volume. In contrast, other authors believe that fluid escapes the vascular compartment due a low oncotic pressure, and sodium retention is a compensatory physiological response to an “underfilled” blood volume. The patients that best fit the “underfilled” hypothesis are children with minimal-change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS). MethodsWe analyzed critically the available evidence for and against each proposed pathogenic mechanism {{in the light of}} recent evidence indicating that the inflammatory infiltrate {{may play a role in}} <b>primary</b> renal <b>sodium</b> retention.

40|$|Abstract:- A {{metallic}} sodium LMFBR (Liquid Metal Fast Breeder Reactor) can sustain a full power SCRAM shutdown using only natural convection after SCRAM. A venturi DRAC allows this mode change without any active fluid control elements. Venturi DRAC is Direct Reactor Auxiliary Cooling that uses venturi flow control elements. Each venturi DRAC low-pressure side port {{is connected to}} a DRAX (Direct Reactor Auxiliary eXchanger) outlet. <b>Primary</b> <b>sodium</b> flow path is from core exit to DRAX inlet, DRAX outlet to venturi side port, out the venturi and back to core. A separate Na or NaK secondary loop transfers heat from DRAX to an external heat sink. Venturi DRAC primary flow path is in parallel with reactor power-production <b>primary</b> <b>sodium</b> flow. Flow is always into the venturi side port. Venturi DRAC primary and secondary circuit flow rates are approximately the same at full power (Mode 1) they are during decay heat removal (Mode 3).

Successful operation of 40 MWt/ 13 MWe capacity Fast Breeder Test Reactor(FBTR) since 1985, strong R&D executed in multidisciplinary domain backed up by manufacturing technology and construction of 500 MWe Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) based on indigenous design have provided high confidence on the success of sodium cooled fast reactor technology. PFBR is a pool type MoX fuelled reactor designed with 2 <b>primary</b> <b>sodium</b> pumps, 2 secondary loops, 8 single wall integrated once through steam generators, and a rectangular containment. PFBR is presently under advanced stage of construction. Beyond PFBR, it is planned to construct 6 more FBRs of 500 MWe capacity each. Towards this, a systematic roadmap has been drawn for improved economy and enhanced safety through a number of measures. Roadmap for necessary R&D and manufacturing technology has been well detailed. The major features incorporated are twin unit concept, plant life increased to 60 years in comparison to 40 years for PFBR, reduction in number of steam generators from 8 to 6, reduction in special steel specific weight requirements, integrated <b>primary</b> <b>sodium</b> purification, enhanced reliability of shutdown systems, enhanced diversity in decay heat removal systems, enhanced in -service inspection, and compact plant layout. Beyond 2025, a series of 1000 MWe capacity metallic fuel with higher breeding potential are planned. R&D activities have been systematically formulated for metallic fuel development of both sodium bonded and mechanical bonded design. The paper addresses the highlights of current operating experience of FBTR and its life extension, construction status of PFBR, and design features of future sodium cooled fast reactors in India...|$|R
40|$|NKG 2 D is an {{important}} activating receptor for triggering the NK cell cytotoxic activity, although chronic engagement of specific ligands by NKG 2 D is also known to provoke decreased cell surface expression of the receptor and compromised NK cell function. We have studied the dynamics of surface NKG 2 D expression and how exposure to the specific ligand major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related molecule B (MICB) affects receptor traffic and fate. While in the NKL cell line and “resting” NK cells NKG 2 D was found principally at the cell surface, in <b>activated</b> <b>primary</b> NK cells an intracellular pool of receptor could also be found recycling to the plasma membrane. Exposure of NK cells to targets expressing MICB resulted in degradation of ∼ 50 % of total NKG 2 D protein and lysosomal degradation of the DAP 10 adaptor molecule. Consistent with these observations, confocal microscopy experiments demonstrated that DAP 10 trafficked to secretory lysosomes in both transfected NKL cells and in <b>activated</b> <b>primary</b> NK cells upon interaction with MICB-expressing target cells. Interestingly, polarization to the synapse of secretory lysosomes containing DAP 10 was also observed. The implications of the intracellular traffic of the NKG 2 D/DAP 10 receptor complex for NK cell activation are discussed. We propose that the rapid degradation of NKG 2 D/DAP 10 observed coincident with recruitment of the receptor to the cytotoxic immune synapse may explain the loss of NKG 2 D receptor expression after chronic exposure to NKG 2 D ligands...|$|R
