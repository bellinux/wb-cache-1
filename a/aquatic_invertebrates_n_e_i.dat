40|$|Over {{the past}} 100 years, {{riparian}} vegetation communities throughout the Southwest United States have been extensively invaded by Tamara spp. (saltcedar). Saltcedar derives its common name from its physiological adaptation to excrete salts. The production of Tamarix detritus with associated secondary chemicals {{may affect the}} quality of <b>aquatic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> food and habitat resources. An alteration in food and habitat quality may affect the composition and structure of <b>aquatic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> assemblages. A series of experiments was conducted contrasting <b>aquatic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> assemblage densities, colonization rates, and growth rates associated with Tamarix versus native vegetation, Populus fremontii (cottonwood) and Salix exigua (willow), to determine if <b>aquatic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> assemblages have been altered by the invasion of Tamarix. Results of invertebrate growth rates over 13 weeks indicate that Tamarix is minimally different in food quality to cottonwood and willow. I failed to find differences in invertebrate colonization rates or invertebrate assemblage densities associated with Tamarix compared to cottonwood and willow over two 6 -week time periods...|$|R

40|$|Methomyl is a {{carbamate}} insecticide (ovicide/larvacide/adulticide) registered nationally {{for control}} of insects {{on a wide range}} of field, fruit, and vegetable crops, sod farms, and as a commercial fly bait. Methomyl is moderately to highly toxic to fish and is mostly highly to very highly toxic to <b>aquatic</b> <b>invertebrates.</b> A Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED) that includes an ecological risk assessment for freshwater and estuarine fish and <b>aquatic</b> <b>invertebrates</b> was issued in December of 1998. The highest risk is to <b>aquatic</b> <b>invertebrates,</b> but the level of concern for endangered fish is exceeded for most use sites. Reduction in populations of <b>aquatic</b> <b>invertebrates</b> might adversely affect the food supply of listed Pacific salmon and steelhead. Chronic risks to fish and <b>aquatic</b> <b>invertebrates</b> also is presumed for those situations where chronic exposure might occur, such as in standing waters into which runoff may occur. Some mitigation measures were required by the RED, including the requirement for a set-back distance from surface waters for all agricultural applications. This buffer (25 feet for ground applications, 150 to 450 feet for aerial applications) is now reflected on product labels. However, we are unable to quantify reductions in aquatic estimated environmental concentrations that may result from applicators adhering to a nospray buffer. We conclude that methomyl may affect 24 Evolutionarily Significant Units (ESUs) but will have no effect on two ESUs. These determinations are based on the extent of crop acreage potentially treated in counties within an ESU, possible adverse direct effects of methomyl on fish, and potential adverse effects on the <b>aquatic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> food supply of listed steelhead and salmon. Major uncertainties in this analysis include lack of statewide and county-level usage information for ESUs in Oregon, Washington, and Idaho and the impact of buffers in limiting runoff and drift of methomyl into surface waters adjacent to treatment sites...|$|R

Most <b>aquatic</b> <b>invertebrates</b> preyed upon by the otters are from the families Odonata (dragonfly nymphs), Plecoptera (stonefly nymphs), and Coleoptera (adult beetles).

40|$|Intermittent {{rivers and}} ephemeral streams (IRES) support diverse and {{sometimes}} distinctive <b>aquatic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> communities. Although flow intermittence {{has been linked}} to reduced taxa richness, the highly variable environmental conditions that characterize IRES can enhance both taxonomic and functional diversity, with different invertebrates characterizing flowing, pool, dry, and flow-resumption phases. <b>Aquatic</b> <b>invertebrate</b> communities, which include specialist taxa, have a diverse range of adaptations to promote their survival in the pools and dry bed sediments that characterize IRES channels during nonflowing phases. These tolerant organisms and recolonists from outside of IRES channels allow communities to recover once flow resumes.
