The families living in the slum <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> move into the temporary shelters. 42% of the households migrated {{from different parts of}} India like Chennai, Hyderabad and most of North India, and 43% of the households had remained in the slums for over 10 years. The Karnataka Municipality, works to shift 300 families annually to newly constructed buildings. One third of these slum clearance projects lack basic service connections, 60% of slum dwellers lack complete water supply lines and share BWSSB water supply.|$|E

Howie Newsome is {{delivering}} milk in the pouring rain while Si Crowell, younger brother of Joe, laments how George's baseball talents will be squandered. George pays an awkward visit to his soon-to-be in-laws. Here, the Stage Manager interrupts the scene and takes the audience back a year, {{to the end of}} Emily and George's junior year. Emily confronts George about his pride, and over an ice cream soda, they discuss the future and their love for each other. George resolves not to go to college, as he had planned, but to work and eventually take over his uncle's farm. In the present, George and Emily say that they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> marry—George to his mother, Emily to her father—but they both calm down and happily go through with the wedding.|$|E

While NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman has lobbied on behalf of both the Flames and the Oilers for government support, Calgary mayor Naheed Nenshi and alderman John Mar have stated their opposition using taxpayer money to help fund a new arena. King stated that the Flames have concepts and designs for a new building, but <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> release them. [...] Some of the plans being considered for Stampede Park would include lowering the city's C-train light rail transit line below ground and run straight into a new facility.|$|E

2500|$|Robert Conquest {{stressed}} that Stalin's purges were not {{contrary to the}} principles of Leninism, but rather a natural consequence of the system established by Vladimir Lenin, who personally ordered the killing of local groups of class enemy hostages. Alexander Yakovlev, architect of perestroika and glasnost and later head of the Presidential Commission for the Victims of Political Repression, elaborates on this point, stating that [...] "The truth is that in punitive operations Stalin did not think up anything that was not there under Lenin: executions, hostage taking, concentration camps, and all the rest." [...] Historian Robert Gellately concurs, saying: [...] "To put it another way, Stalin initiated very little that Lenin had not already introduced or previewed."

2500|$|An {{attempt to}} change the rules was made by Condoleezza Rice and Tzipi Livni when they brought forth the concept of a shelf agreement. [...] The idea was to {{disengage}} the linkage between negotiations and actions on the ground. In theory this would allow negotiations until a [...] "shelf agreement" [...] defining peace would be obtained. Such an agreement would not entail implementation. It would just describe what peace is. It would stay on the shelf but eventually will guide the implementation. The difficulty with this notion is that it creates a dis-incentive for Israel to reach such an agreement. The lack of clarity about what happens after agreement is reached will result in insurmountable pressures on Abbas to demand immediate implementation. However, from the Israeli point of view, the Palestinians <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> create a stable state, such an implementation process will almost guarantee instability in the Palestinian areas with a possible Hamas takeover as happened in Gaza.|$|E
2500|$|The ACT ( [...] ; {{originally}} an abbreviation of American College Testing) college readiness {{assessment is}} a standardized test {{for high school}} achievement and college admissions in the United States produced by ACT, a nonprofit organization of the same name. It was first administered in November 1959 by Everett Franklin Lindquist as a competitor to the College Board's Scholastic Aptitude Test, now the SAT. The ACT originally consisted of four tests: English, Mathematics, Social Studies, and Natural Sciences. In 1989 however, the Social Studies test was changed into a Reading section (which included a Social Studies subsection) and the Natural Sciences test was renamed the Science Reasoning test, with more emphasis on problem solving skills. In February 2005, an optional Writing test {{was added to the}} ACT, mirroring changes to the SAT that took place later in March of the same year. In 2013, ACT announced that students would be able to take the ACT by computer starting in the spring of 2015. The test will continue to be offered in the paper format for schools that <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> transition to computer testing.|$|E

Occupations employ physical possession to communicate intense dissent, exhibited by a willingness {{to break the law}} and to suffer the -- occasionally violent -- consequences." [...] Another CNN report by Douglas Rushkoff, said that even though the protesters <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> articulate an exact array of problems or how to solve them,"Anyone who says he has no idea what these folks are protesting is not being truthful. Whether we agree with them or not, we all know what they are upset about, and we all know that there are investment bankers working on Wall Street getting richer while things for {{most of the rest of}} us are getting tougher. What upsets banking's defenders and politicians alike is the refusal of this movement to state its terms or set its goals in the traditional language of campaigns...They mean to show that there is an inappropriate and correctable disconnect between the abundance America produces and the scarcity its markets manufacture".|$|E
