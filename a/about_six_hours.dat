5|$|The storm first struck Mayotte, {{affecting}} the island with gale-force gusts for <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>hours.</b> Sustained winds reached 78km/h (48mph), and wind gusts peaked at 98km/h (61mph). Effects {{on the island}} were minimal. Cyclone Ernest indirectly affected Malawi, located inland in southeast Africa. The storm's circulation removed moisture from the country and prevented any rainfall from occurring {{in the southern part}} of the country during a nine-day period.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on September 27. It tracked westward to the south of a subtropical ridge, becoming convectively active, and a low-level circulation was observed as it passed south of the Cape Verde islands on September 28. The organization of the convection oscillated over the subsequent days, and a few times the system showed signs of developing into a tropical depression. As it approached the Lesser Antilles it organized further, and despite unfavorable upper-level wind shear the system developed into Tropical Depression Thirteen on October 3 while located about 115miles (185km/h) east of Dominica. Located in an area of weak steering currents, the depression drifted to the northwest, and <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>hours</b> after first developing the cyclone intensified into a tropical storm; the National Hurricane Center designated it with the name Klaus.|$|E
5|$|A weak trough {{existed in}} the eastern Gulf of Mexico on September29. A {{circulation}} developed within the storm, becoming a tropical depression on October1. Later that day, the system intensified into Tropical Storm How. Initially, the tropical storm moved west-northwestward and its sustained winds peaked by October2, estimated at 45mph (75km/h). Officials advised small boats to remain at port along the Louisiana coast due to the storm. On October3, Tropical Storm How turned toward the southwest as it began weakening, {{and the next day}} it moved ashore near La Pesca, Tamaulipas as a tropical depression. <b>About</b> <b>six</b> <b>hours</b> after making landfall, How dissipated over the Sierra Madre Oriental in northeastern Mexico.

5|$|After {{the storm}} {{maintained}} peak winds for <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>hours,</b> the IMD downgraded Gonu to very severe cyclonic storm status late on June 4. Its eye became cloud-filled and ragged, and the cyclone gradually weakened due to cooler water temperatures and drier air as it approached the Arabian Peninsula. Due to land interaction with Oman, the inner core of deep convection rapidly weakened, {{and over a}} period of 24hours the intensity decreased by 95km/h (60mph). According to the IMD, Cyclone Gonu crossed the easternmost tip of Oman still as a very severe cyclonic storm early on June 6. Although the winds continued to gradually decrease, overall organization increased slightly in the hours prior to landfall; Gonu maintained a well-defined low-level structure with a weak eye.|$|E
5|$|An {{investigation}} by the Metropolitan and City of London Police forces identified Gardstein's accomplices, {{most of whom were}} arrested within two weeks. The police were informed that the final two members of the gang were hiding at 100 Sidney Street in Stepney. The police evacuated local residents from the environs, and on the morning of 3 January a firefight broke out. Armed with inferior weapons, the police sought assistance from the army. The siege lasted for <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>hours.</b> Towards the end of the stand-off, the building caught fire; no single cause has been identified.

5|$|Around midday on September13, {{the storm}} {{strengthened}} into a Category5 hurricane, {{based on the}} anemometer at San Juan observing sustained winds of 160mph (268km/h). The hurricane peaked with sustained winds at the intensity. <b>About</b> <b>six</b> <b>hours</b> later, the system made landfall in Puerto Rico; {{it was the only}} recorded tropical cyclone to strike the island as a Category5. Very strong winds resulted in severe damage in Puerto Rico. Throughout the island, 24,728homes were destroyed and 192,444were damaged, leaving over 500,000 people homeless. Heavy rainfall also led to extreme damage to vegetation and agriculture. On Puerto Rico alone, there were 312 deaths and about $50million in damage. After emerging into the Atlantic, the storm weakened slightly, falling to Category4 intensity. It began crossing through the Bahamas on September16. Many buildings and houses were damaged or destroyed, especially on Bimini, Eleuthera, New Providence, and San Salvador Island. Nineteen deaths were reported, eighteen from a sloop disappearing and one due to drowning.|$|E

5|$|Due to Paula's small size, {{impact in}} Mexico was minor, mainly limited to light {{rainfall}} and winds. However, an American tourist drowned offshore Cozumel. After Paula attained its peak intensity on October13, wind shear began to increase, causing the storm to weaken. The storm turned north-northeastward {{and fell to}} tropical storm intensity on October14. Shortly thereafter, Paula made landfall in the Cuban province of Pinar del Río. Early on October15, Paula weakened to a tropical depression while moving eastward over Cuba, before degenerating into a remnant low pressure area <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>hours</b> later. In Cuba, rainfall was mostly beneficial. Strong winds, with gusts reaching 68mph (109km/h), left power outages in Pinar del Río and Artemisa provinces. In the Havana area, a few homes were deroofed, while falling trees blocked many roads. Impact in the Florida Keys was minimal, limited to light rainfall and increased tides.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} six hours, Urmil underwent explosive deepening {{as the main}} feeder band wrapped around the center of circulation. After the brief period of intensification, the storm reached its peak intensity with winds of 110km/h (70mph) according to both the RSMC Nadi and the JTWC, making it a high-end Category 2 cyclone on the Australian Scale. The highly favorable environment, {{in combination with the}} fast forward motion of the storm, allowed Urmil to rapidly reach its peak intensity, despite wind shear reaching 35km/h (25mph). However, as quickly as the storm strengthened, it began to weaken as convection weakened. With both wind shear and forward motion increasing, the cyclone quickly became disorganized. Around 0000UTC on January15, the center of circulation was devoid of shower and thunderstorm activity. <b>About</b> <b>six</b> <b>hours</b> later, Urmil transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and was subsequently absorbed into the mid-latitude westerlies.|$|E
5|$|Early on June13, {{satellite}} and weather radar showed heavy rainbands moving across Jamaica and eastern Cuba. Due its {{interaction with the}} two islands, the depression weakened slightly. Later on June13, the storm made landfall near Venezuela, Cuba with winds of 30mph (45km/h). Moving northward, it emerged into the Atlantic Ocean near Cayo Santa María early the next day. Around 12:00UTC on June14, the system re-strengthened and again attained its maximum sustained wind speed of 35mph (55km/h). Despite moving back over open waters, the depression failed to intensify further. Operationally, the system was thought to have made landfall in east-central Florida, but later analysis revealed that the center remained over water. The depression continued northward until striking near Charleston, South Carolina late on June16, still with the same intensity. It degenerated into a remnant low pressure area <b>about</b> <b>six</b> <b>hours</b> later. Its remnants continued northeastward across the Southeastern United States, the Mid-Atlantic, and New England until dissipating fully on June18.|$|E
