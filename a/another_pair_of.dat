5|$|After {{the second}} match ended, Rick Rude and the Junkyard Dog {{made their way}} to the ring. Their match began as Rude {{attacked}} Junkyard Dog from behind, who retaliated by headbutting Rude several times. Subsequently, Rude climbed to the wrestling ring's top rope and pulled down his tights to reveal <b>another</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> tights with a picture of Cheryl Roberts on them. As a result, Jake Roberts, Cheryl Roberts' husband, ran to the ring and attacked Rude, forcing the referee to disqualify the Junkyard Dog.|$|E

5|$|Graham's {{first game}} for the Northwestern Wildcats {{football}} team was on October 4, 1941, when he caught a Kansas State punt and returned it 90yards for a touchdown. He ran and passed for two more touchdowns in the 51–3 victory. After scoring <b>another</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> touchdowns in a win against Wisconsin, Graham passed to his wide receivers for two touchdowns in a victory over the Ohio State, coached by Paul Brown, the team's only loss of the 1941 season. Northwestern ended the year with an 11th-place showing in the AP Poll of the best college teams in the country.|$|E

5|$|In a 1970 paper, Glashow, John Iliopoulos and Luciano Maiani {{presented}} the so-called GIM mechanism {{to explain the}} experimental non-observation of flavor-changing neutral currents. This theoretical model required {{the existence of the}} as-yet undiscovered charm quark. The number of supposed quark flavors grew to the current six in 1973, when Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa noted that the experimental observation of CP violation could be explained if there were <b>another</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> quarks.|$|E
5|$|In the 1959–60 NBA season, Cousy {{was again}} productive, his 19.4 points, 4.7 rebounds and 9.5 assists per game earning him his eighth {{consecutive}} assists title and another joint All-NBA First Team and All-Star team nomination. Again, the Celtics defeated all opposition {{and won the}} 1960 NBA Finals 4–3 against the Hawks. A year later, the 32-year-old Cousy scored 18.1 points, 4.4 rebounds and 7.7 assists per game, winning <b>another</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> All-NBA First Team and All-Star nominations, but failing to win the assists crown after eight consecutive seasons. However, the Celtics won the 1961 NBA Finals after convincingly beating the Hawks 4–1.|$|E
5|$|Access to {{the central}} island {{occurred}} over a drawbridge, through a pair of gatehouses on the eastern side. Caerphilly Castle's Inner East Gatehouse, based on the gatehouse built at Tonbridge in the 1250s, reinforced a trend in gatehouse design across England and Wales. Sometimes termed a keep-gatehouse, the fortification had both exterior and interior defences, enabling it to be defended even if {{the perimeter of the}} castle was breached. Two huge towers flanked the gatehouse on either side of an entrance that was protected by portcullises and murder-holes. The substantial size of the gatehouse allowed it to be used for accommodation as well as defence and it was comfortably equipped on a grand scale, probably {{for the use of the}} castle constable and his family. <b>Another</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> gatehouses protected the west side.|$|E

5|$|Alabama {{started their}} second drive {{with a short}} gain and an incompletion, and then McCarron then threw a 19-yard pass to Maze for a first down. The Crimson Tide gained <b>another</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> first downs with a Maze {{reception}} and three runs each from Richardson and Eddie Lacy before the drive stalled at the LSU 33. Again Foster missed a field goal, this time from 50-yards, and the game remained tied at zero. On the next LSU possession, Ware had a short gain and Lee completed a short pass to Russell Shepard before he threw an interception to Robert Lester at the Alabama 47-yard line. The Crimson Tide then began their third offensive series with a 19-yard completion from McCarron to Darius Hanks {{before the end of}} the first quarter.|$|E
5|$|Around mid-September 1943, the two-man Bf 110 {{crew was}} {{augmented}} {{by a third}} member, {{sometimes referred to as}} Bordmechaniker (air mechanic) or Bordschütze (air gunner). The reason for this was that the decline of the Himmelbett procedure, the introduction of the broadcast procedure Zahme Sau, and the growing threat of RAF intruder night fighter operations, had necessitated the need for <b>another</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> watchful eyes to the rear. Unteroffizier Wilhelm Gänsler, who had already contributed to 17 claims made by Hauptmann Ludwig Becker, was Schnaufer's new lookout. With Handtke and Gänsler as his crew, Schnaufer claimed his 26th aerial victory on 23 September 1943 over a No. 218 Squadron Stirling during a Wilde Sau intercept mission.|$|E
5|$|Dinheirosaurus {{material}} included vertebrae, ribs, partial pelvis, and gastroliths. The vertebrae {{were certainly}} from the cervical and dorsal regions, and are articulated. The two cervicals are not greatly preserved, although the twelve dorsals are articulated {{and in good}} condition. Other vertebral material includes seven centra that are fragmentary and a few neural arches, which are unattached. 12 dorsal ribs are preserved, {{as well as some}} appendicular elements. David Weishampel et al. did not recognize all the material as belonging to Dinheirosaurus, and only found 9 dorsals in the holotype, while also misinterpreting the pubis as a limb fragment. They also incorrectly stated that it was found in the Camadas de Alcobaça Formation. <b>Another</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> vertebrae, under collection number ML 418, was originally assigned to Dinheirosaurus by Bonaparte and Mateus, but is now considered to be a distinct new unnamed genus of diplodocid.|$|E

5|$|Feit {{initially}} denied hearing Garza's confession in the rectory, but {{he later}} {{admitted to having}} done so. He accounted for his absence from the sanctuary by explaining that he had broken his glasses that night; {{he said that he}} often played with his glasses nervously as he listened to confession. Feit said that he had driven back to the pastoral house to get <b>another</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> glasses, and when he arrived he had no key, so he had to climb into the house on the second floor. He said that he sustained the scratches on his hands as was climbing the outside of the brick structure.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} 1958–59 NBA season, the Celtics got revenge on their opposition, powered by an inspired Cousy, who averaged 20.0 points, 5.5 rebounds and a league-high 8.6 assists a game, won another assists title and <b>another</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> All-NBA First Team and All-Star team nominations. Late in the season, Cousy reasserted his playmaking dominance by setting an NBA record with 28 assists {{in a game}} against the Minneapolis Lakers. While that record was broken 19 years later, Cousy also set a record for 19 assists in a half which has never been broken. The Celtics stormed through the playoffs and, behind Cousy's 51 total assists (still a record for a four-game NBA Finals series), defeated the Minneapolis Lakers in the first 4–0 sweep ever in the 1959 NBA Finals.|$|E

5|$|This {{section is}} crossed by King Street, which follows {{the course of}} a Roman road. Where it crosses the Maxey Cut, to the south of the {{original}} channels, there are a series of 14 arches which comprise Lolham Bridges. They are grouped into five structures to cross the channels in the area, and were funded by the County of Northamptonshire in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The longest span is , and the cutwaters carry inscribed stones recording the County's involvement. To the north, an early nineteenth century stone rubble arched bridge carries the road over a drainage ditch near Lolham Mill, while an eighteenth-century bridge, probably rebuilt in the following century, crosses the mill stream. <b>Another</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> early nineteenth-century bridges, built of coursed limestone with ashlar dressings, carry the road over the northernmost channel.|$|E
5|$|As Syzygy and Nutting {{prepared}} for the MOA show, Bushnell learned that <b>another</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> engineers were also creating an arcade version of Spacewar. In August 1971 Bushnell called Bill Pitts and Hugh Tuck, operating as Mini-Computer Applications, {{so that they could}} meet and discuss their solutions to the problem of running Spacewar on an inexpensive computer. Pitts and Tuck were developing a prototype machine of Galaxy Game when they met with Bushnell; the game, however, while a faithful recreation of Spacewar, ran on an externally-connected DEC PDP-11 with a Hewlett-Packard 1300A Electrostatic Display, and the total cost of the prototype unit was US$20,000. The Syzygy duo were relieved, though also somewhat disappointed, to find that Galaxy Game was not using an innovative solution Syzygy had missed to build an economically-competitive arcade game. Pitts and Tuck, conversely, felt that Computer Space was a pale imitation of Spacewar, while Galaxy Game was a superior adaptation of the game. They eventually produced two game prototypes, both displayed in the Stanford student union building, but never produced the game commercially due to the high cost of the cabinet.|$|E
5|$|Homologues {{of most of}} {{the bones}} of temnospondyls are also seen in other early tetrapods, aside from a few bones in the skull, such as interfrontals, internasals, and interparietals, that have {{developed}} in some temnospondyl taxa. Most temnospondyls have tabular horns in the backs of their skulls, rounded projections of bone separated {{from the rest of the}} skull by indentations called otic notches; in some temnospondyls, such as Zatrachys, they are pointed and very prominent. Among the most distinguishing features of temnospondyls are the interpterygoid vacuities, two large holes in the back of the palate. <b>Another</b> <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> holes, choanae, are present in front of these vacuities, and connect the nasal passage with the mouth. Temnospondyls often have teeth on their palates, as well as in their jaws. Some of these teeth are so large, they are referred to as tusks. In some temnospondyls, such as Nigerpeton, tusks in the lower jaw pierce the palate and emerge through openings in the top of the skull.|$|E
