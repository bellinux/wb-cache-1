As a result of this meeting FC Barcelona was formed.|$|E
5|$|The {{club was}} formed {{following}} <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Eastville Restaurant in Bristol in September 1883. It was initially called Black Arabs F.C., after the Arabs rugby {{team and the}} predominantly black kits in which they played. This name only lasted for the 1883–84 season, and {{in a bid to}} draw more fans from the local area the club was renamed Eastville Rovers in 1884.|$|E
5|$|By 1980, the {{authorities}} {{had no choice}} but to make another attempt to raise consumer prices to realistic levels, but they knew that doing so would likely spark another worker rebellion. Western bankers providing loans to the Polish government at <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Bank Handlowy in Warsaw on 1 July 1980 made it clear that low prices of consumer goods could no longer be subsidized by the state. The government gave in and on 1 July announced a system of gradual but continuous price rises, particularly for meat. A wave of strikes and factory occupations began at once, with the biggest ones taking place in Lublin in July 1980.|$|E

5|$|In 1936, local {{businessman}} Leonard P. Thompson {{threatened to}} lead a breakaway from the amateur club to create an entirely separate professional club, Ipswich United. John Murray Cobbold, the club President, called together rival factions for <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Town Hall on 1 May 1936, at which {{it was agreed that}} Ipswich Town should turn professional. The club was unanimously elected to the Southern League for the 1936–37 season and former Irish international footballer Mick O'Brien was appointed as the club's first professional manager.|$|E
5|$|In May 2007, Griffin {{was invited}} to address <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> University of Bath by {{politics}} student and BNP youth leader Danny Lake. Lake wanted Griffin to visit the university and explain the BNP's policies to lecturers and students. The invitation was viewed by some as {{an attempt by the}} party to establish a foothold on the university campus. Eleven union general secretaries wrote to the university's vice-chancellor and asked her to reconsider the decision to allow the meeting. A large protest was planned, and following students' concerns over their personal safety, the University cancelled the invitation.|$|E
5|$|In an editorial, the Lyttelton Times welcomed Sewell's {{intention}} of representing the electorate again, but criticised {{him for the}} briefness of his statement. The newspaper's expectation was that Sewell should publicly state what his policies were, and not just rely on his past representation in Parliament. On 7 January 1860, Sewell placed an advertisement in the Lyttelton Times, inviting electors to <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Mechanics' Institute next to the Christchurch Town Hall on Friday, 13 January.|$|E

The blue and red colours of the shirt were first worn in a match against Hispania in 1900; the prevailing Catalonia conception is that the colours were chosen by Joan Gamper and are those of his home team, Crystal Palace.|$|E

5|$|On 5 September 1882 Shaw {{attended}} <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Memorial Hall, Farringdon, {{addressed by}} the political economist Henry George. Shaw then read George's book Progress and Poverty, which awakened his interest in economics. He began attending meetings of the Social Democratic Federation (SDF), where he discovered the writings of Karl Marx, and thereafter spent much of 1883 reading Das Kapital. He was not impressed by the SDF's founder, H. M. Hyndman, whom he found autocratic, ill-tempered and lacking leadership qualities. Shaw doubted {{the ability of the}} SDF to harness the working classes into an effective radical movement and did not join it—he preferred, he said, to work with his intellectual equals.|$|E

The vote, they claimed, was issued due to allegations that the sheriff made against members of the agency, {{in which he said}} they were deliberately malingering in order to reflect badly on him. The sheriff rejected the allegations as unfounded and voiced his displeasure over the vote, calling them politically motivated due to their proximity to the primary elections, which was only weeks away at the time.|$|E
5|$|The Eastern Suburbs District Rugby League Football Club (ESDRLFC) {{was formed}} on 24 January 1908 at <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Paddington Town Hall in Sydney {{after it was}} decided that the {{district}} should enter a team in the newly formed New South Wales Rugby Football League. The ESDRLFC was formed, under its articles of association with the NSWRL, to represent the geographic areas in Sydney covering the Waverley, Randwick, Woollahra, Paddington, Darlinghurst and Vaucluse local government municipalities, as well as the eastern parts of the Sydney CBD. Indeed, the 'suburb' of Sydney, postcode 2000, falls entirely within the official boundaries of the ESDRLFC.|$|E
5|$|The Saudi Arabia women's {{national}} football {{team would be}} the national team representing the kingdom in inter{{national football}}. However, the team does not yet exist because of influence of religious leaders in Saudi Arabia, systematic discrimination against women's sport, and active opposition of political leaders and sport administrators. International pressure has come {{to bear on the}} country to field a women's team, and FIFA now allows the hijab to be worn in competition. <b>A</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> College of Business Administration in Jeddah was seen as a possible first step in a team eventually being created.|$|E

Stimson, Harrison, Groves, Conant, Vannevar Bush, and Fleet Admiral William D. Leahy presented their views, and Truman authorized the immediate release of the report. The War Department released the thousand {{copies of the}} report that had been kept in Groves's office to the media for use by the radio broadcasters with an embargo time of 9:00 pm on August 11, 1945, and for the newspapers of August 12.|$|E
5|$|A year later, the US and Ojibwe {{signed the}} Treaty of Fond du Lac at <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{western edge of}} Lake Superior. The signatories were listed by band, and Buffalo, {{recorded}} as Peezhickee, signed as the first chief from La Pointe. The treaty, mainly dealing with mineral rights for Ojibwa lands {{in what is now}} Michigan, had little immediate effect but foreshadowed future treaties. Buffalo did not speak on the copper issue. He praised the US officials for their ability to keep their young people under their control; he asked for whiskey to accomplish the same ends among the younger members of his band. When the agent presented him with a silver medal as a symbol of his chieftainship, Buffalo said that his power was based in his clan and reputation, and not from anything received from the U.S. Government.|$|E
5|$|Daniel and Eliza finally meet {{during a}} visit to the Netherlands where Daniel acts as an {{intermediary}} between William of Orange and the detracting English nobility. Daniel realizes Eliza's importance during <b>a</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> house of Christiaan Huygens. Eliza woos Daniel and uses this connection to gain entrance into the English court and the Royal Society. Daniel also meets Nicholas Fatio while in Amsterdam. Soon after this meeting, Fatio and Eliza prevent the attempted kidnapping of William of Orange by an ambitious French courtier. Upon his return, Daniel is arrested by the notorious judge George Jeffreys, and later imprisoned in the Tower of London. Daniel escapes with the help of Jack Shaftoe's brother Bob, whose infantry unit is stationed there.|$|E
