The best-rated, Disney's 2004 animated musical Teacher's Pet, was a commercial failure, as was 2001's The Pledge. Cloverfield, the third entry, was a success, and behind it Freedom Writers had ridden its good reviews to do some modest box office in 2007; however How She Move had flopped that same year.|$|E

500|$|However, {{already in}} quantum {{mechanics}} {{there is one}} [...] "caveat", namely the particles acting onto each other do not only possess the spatial variable, but also a discrete [...] intrinsic angular momentum-like variable called the [...] "spin", {{and there is the}} Pauli principle relating the space and the spin variables. Depending on the value of the spin, identical particles split into two different classes, fermions and bosons. [...] If two identical fermions (e.g. electrons) have a symmetric spin function (e.g. [...] parallel spins) the spatial variables must be antisymmetric (i.e. they exclude each other from their places much <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a repulsive force), and vice versa, i.e. for antiparallel spins the position variables must be symmetric (i.e. the apparent force must be attractive). Thus in the case of two fermions there is a strictly negative correlation between spatial and spin variables, whereas for two bosons (e.g. quanta of electromagnetic waves, photons) the correlation is strictly positive.|$|E

The realistic design of the new puppets has been praised by Vincent Terrace and criticised by others. Certain members of the production staff had the impression that they lacked the charm of the earlier generation of puppets due to the authentic proportions that were now being used. Director David Lane's initial thoughts on a prototype, sculpted by head puppet-maker John Brown, were, [...] "it was <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a little dead person in ... because it was perfect in all its proportions it just looked odd." [...] Brown remembers placing the prototype next to the Lady Penelope puppet from Thunderbirds and gauging the response from colleagues: [...] "When they saw it, some people were horrified by the difference. Some didn't like it, some did." [...] Commentators have noted that facial expression was sacrificed in favour of a realistic design, a result on which Terry Curtis remembers: ...|$|E

2500|$|However, in the White Paper of 1939, the British {{government}} under Neville Chamberlain abandoned {{the idea of}} establishing a Jewish Commonwealth.

500|$|Augustus Jones {{had learned}} of the band's {{troubles}} and ventured into the interior to bring Peter and John {{to live with him}} at his farm in Saltfleet Township, with their stepmother and halfsiblings. [...] As he knew only a few words of English, Peter was enrolled in a one-room school in Stoney Creek. With the help of the local teacher, George Hughes, Peter learned English. The next year, the family moved to Brantford, where Augustus took Peter out of school and began to instruct him in farming. [...] Sarah Tekarihogan's Iroquois tribe had settled in the Grand River valley in and around Brantford. [...] Here Jones was inducted into the Iroquois tribe and given the Mohawk name [...] "Desagondensta", meaning [...] "he stands people on their feet". [...] Jones was baptised Anglican by Reverend Ralph Leeming at the request of his father in 1820, but internally he did not accept Christianity. [...] Jones would later say that although the instruction he received in Christianity from his father, his stepmother and his old schoolteacher George Hughes had attracted him to the religion, the conduct of the white Christian settlers [...] "drunk, quarreling, fighting and cheating the poor Indians, and acting <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no God" [...] convinced him there could be no truth in their religion. [...] He allowed himself to be baptised primarily to become a full member of the white society of Upper Canada, with all the privileges it entailed. [...] Given the behaviour of others who had been baptised, Jones expected it to have no effect upon him. [...] Jones worked with his father farming until the summer of 1822, when he found employment as a brickmaker working for his brother-in-law Archibald Russell to raise money so he might resume his schooling. [...] He attended school in Fairchild's Creek during the winter of 18223 studying arithmetic and writing, hoping to obtain work as a clerk in the fur trade. [...] In spring 1823, Jones left the school, returning to his father's farm that May.|$|E

A hand cannot be got to the nose if using a full facemask. Many eyes-and-nose diving masks have two small pockets in their underside, or are like goggles with the soft edge extended downwards over the nose, to let two fingers reach the nose and pinch it.|$|E

2500|$|In the paper, Morewedge and Norton (2009) {{also found}} that people {{attribute}} more importance to dream content than to similar thought content that occurs while they are awake. In one study, Americans {{were more likely to}} report that they would miss their flight if they dreamt of their plane crashing than if they thought of their plane crashing the night before flying (while awake), and that they would be as likely to miss their flight if they dreamt of their plane crashing the night before their flight <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> an actual plane crash on the route they intended to take. [...] Not all dream content was considered equally important. Participants in their studies were more likely to perceive dreams to be meaningful when the content of dreams was in accordance with their beliefs and desires while awake. People were more likely to view a positive dream about a friend to be meaningful than a positive dream about someone they disliked, for example, and were more likely to view a negative dream about a person they disliked as meaningful than a negative dream about a person they liked.|$|E
2500|$|This {{time it was}} {{a problem}} of too much water.

When, eventually, the river went back to its normal course, the Ermita was so dried, clean and tidy that no one would say any rain had fallen and not flooding had occurred in the vicinity. All this happened to the great surprise of the caretaker or [...] "ermitaño" [...] who, afraid for his life, had climbed to the altar of Our Lady and, on his knees, prayed for his safety. He propagated the extraordinary event and many people went to see for themselves what the [...] "ermitaño" [...] was telling.

2500|$|Five Alpine White Dodge Challenger R/Ts were lent to the {{production}} by Chrysler for promotional consideration and were returned upon completion of filming. Four cars had 440 engines equipped with four-speeds; the fifth car was a 383 with automatic. No special equipment was added or modifications made to the cars, except for heavier-duty shock absorbers for the car that jumped over No Name Creek. The Challengers were prepared and maintained for the movie by Max Balchowsky, who also prepared the Mustangs and Chargers for Bullitt (1968). The cars performed to Loftin's satisfaction, although dust came to be a problem. None of the engines were blown. Loftin remembers that parts were taken out of one car to repair another because they [...] "really ruined {{a couple of those}} cars" [...] while jumping ramps between highways and over creeks. Newman remembers that the 440 engines in the cars were so powerful that [...] "it was almost <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> too much power for the body.

2500|$|As {{a matter}} of procedure, the judge would {{question}} the plaintiff {{in order to bring}} out the cause of the complaint. [...] Once this was accomplished, the subsequent proceeding under the bill would be carried out <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a legitimate writ. [...] By the 15th century, the bill would typically pray that a subpoena should be issued to secure the appearance and examination of the defendant. [...] At the bottom of the bill were the names of the pledges to prosecute. [...] These were similar to the bills issued by the Court of Eyre. [...] Those subpoenas issued in Chancery at the time of Henry VI of England were required to have a pledge attached. [...] Statute at that time prohibited the issue of a writ of subpoena until the plaintiff had found sureties to satisfy the defendant's damages if he did not prevail in his case. [...] When the defendant appeared, both the plaintiff and his witnesses, and the defendant and any witnesses which he might produce, were examined by the Chancellor. [...] Production of documents could be demanded via subpoena duces tecum. [...] It has been suggested that the writ subpoena was very similar to the bill of Eyre. [...] However, in the opinions of Professor Adams, Sir Frederick Pollock, 3rd Baronet and Professor Powicke, it is erroneous to conclude that the writ subpoena came from the Bill of Eyre.
