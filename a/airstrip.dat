5|$|During World War II, Rajah Charles Vyner Brooke {{ordered the}} {{construction}} of airstrips in Kuching, Oya, Mukah, Bintulu, and Miri. Construction of the Bintulu <b>airstrip</b> was started in 1934 {{under the direction of}} C.W. Bailey, a Works and Building Inspector for the British Royal Air Force (RAF). All the airstrips were completed except for the Bintulu <b>airstrip,</b> where construction was discontinued in October 1938 due to financial reasons. Japanese forces landed in Miri on 16 December 1941. Sarawak fell into Japanese hands when they conquered Kuching on 24 December 1941. When the Japanese invaded Sarawak, Charles Vyner Brooke already left for Sydney (Australia) before the attack while his officers were captured by the Japanese and interned at the Batu Lintang camp. During the Japanese occupation, the Japanese used the <b>airstrip</b> for military purposes. However, the <b>airstrip</b> was heavily bombed by Allied forces. The British began reconstruction of the <b>airstrip</b> after the war; during the project many unexploded bombs were unearthed.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} {{opened on}} 1May1945 when the 26thBrigade Group {{landed on the}} small island of Tarakan off {{the east coast of}} Borneo to secure the island's <b>airstrip</b> as a base to support the planned landings at Brunei and Balikpapan. While it had been expected that it would take only a few weeks to secure Tarakan and re-open the <b>airstrip,</b> intensive fighting on the island lasted until 19June and the <b>airstrip</b> was not opened until 28June. As a result, the operation is generally considered to have not been worthwhile.|$|E
5|$|By 13 August, North Korean {{troops were}} {{operating}} in the mountains west and southwest of Yongil Airfield. U.S. Air Force commanders—wary of enemy attack—evacuated the 45 P-51s of the 39th and 40th Fighter Squadron from the <b>airstrip,</b> against complaints of General MacArthur. However, the <b>airstrip</b> remained {{under the protection of}} UN ground forces and never came under direct North Korean fire. The squadrons were moved to Tsuiki on the island of Kyushu, Japan.|$|E
50|$|There are a {{considerable}} number of both public and private <b>airstrips.</b> Tanzania Airports Authority manages 32 <b>airstrips,</b> such as Morogoro and Singida.|$|R

5|$|In 1941, the University of Oklahoma and Norman city {{officials}} established Max Westheimer Field, a university <b>airstrip,</b> and then leased {{it to the}} U.S. Navy as a Naval Flight Training Center in 1942. The training center was used for training combat pilots during World War II. A second training center, known as Naval Air Technical Training Center, and a naval hospital were later established to the south. In the years following World War II the <b>airstrip</b> was transferred back to the university's control. Today the <b>airstrip</b> is called the University of Oklahoma Westheimer Airport. Following the war the remaining military presence and post-war veterans who came to Norman {{to get an education}} again grew the city's population, which was 27,006 by 1950. The Navy again utilized the bases in a lesser capacity from 1952 to 1959 in support of the Korean War effort.|$|E
5|$|The 2/6th Independent Company {{had won a}} {{significant}} victory, but now had 23 wounded and was very low on ammunition. Frazier landed on the newly captured <b>airstrip</b> in his Piper Cub at 12:30. He rejected the <b>airstrip</b> as unsuitable for Dakotas, and oversaw the preparation of a new <b>airstrip</b> on better ground near Mission Hill. This was still a difficult approach, as aircraft had to land upwind while avoiding Mission Hill. Although it was not known if the <b>airstrip</b> would be ready, Hutchison flew in for a test landing there the next day, 21 September, at 15:30. He collected the wounded and flew them to Nadzab, and returned an hour later with a load of rations and ammunition. He also brought with him Brigadier Ivan Dougherty, {{the commander of the}} 21st Infantry Brigade, and his headquarters, who took charge of the area. Around 18:00, six more transports arrived.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{had evidently}} not {{expected}} a landing at Lugos and their positions there were quickly overrun. The 1stSquadron, 8thCavalry then advanced eastward {{until it was}} stopped by a Japanese bunker complex {{on the edge of}} the Lorengau <b>airstrip.</b> An artillery barrage was brought down, followed by an airstrike by Kittyhawks with 500pound bombs. The cavalry resumed their advance and occupied a ridge overlooking the <b>airstrip</b> without opposition. In the meantime, the 7thCavalry had been landed at Lugos from the LST on its second trip and took over the defense of the area, freeing the 2ndSquadron, 8thCavalry to join the attack on Lorengau. The first attempt to capture the <b>airstrip</b> was checked by an enemy bunker complex. A second attempt on 17March, reinforced by the 1stSquadron, 7thCavalry and tanks, made good progress. The advance then resumed, with Lorengau itself falling on 18March.|$|E
5000|$|In 1943, Japanese patrols {{partially}} {{succeeded in}} entering the Eastern Highlands {{and there were}} numerous air raids on the various <b>airstrips.</b> Small detachments were later sent in defence of the <b>airstrips</b> including Kainantu. in ...|$|R

5|$|The largest plant task {{undertaken}} {{during the}} deployment was {{the construction of}} an <b>airstrip</b> at Opuwo. The squadron commander, Major David Crago, described how the road network in Namibia was better than expected; in retrospect, the squadron brought too much heavy road-making equipment. The squadron deployed 20 members of the Plant Troop (under Captain Nigel Catchlove) to Opuwo. Over a period of four months, Sergeant Ken Roma constructed an all-weather <b>airstrip</b> {{in one of the most}} remote parts of Namibia.|$|E

5|$|Work {{on major}} {{facilities}} at Jacquinot Bay began in December. These were {{to include a}} large dock, an <b>airstrip,</b> buildings {{to be used by}} 2/8th General Hospital and stores depots. By this time it had been decided to stockpile sufficient stores at Jacquinot Bay to support 13,000 soldiers for 60 days. Work on the <b>airstrip</b> was completed in May 1945. Two squadrons of Corsair fighter aircraft from the Royal New Zealand Air Force were later based there.|$|E
5|$|A bitumen-surfaced second runway {{was built}} at No. 1 <b>Airstrip</b> by No. 6 Mobile Works Squadron RAAF, {{after which the}} {{original}} runway was only used for emergencies and taxiing. The minefield around No. 3 <b>Airstrip</b> was lifted and the <b>airstrip</b> was completed, with revetments and hardstands for 70 medium bombers. A new wharf, known as Liles' wharf after the American engineer who supervised its construction, was built in September and October 1942. This was capable of handling Liberty ships. Henceforth ships could sail direct to Milne Bay from the United States, reducing the pressure on Australian ports and saving two or three days' sailing time plus the time taken to unload and then reload the cargo on smaller ships. PT boats were based at Milne Bay from December 1942, and a transhipment and staging area, overhaul facilities for PT boats, a destroyer base and Station Hospital were also constructed. Milne Bay {{was used as a}} staging area for mounting the landing at Lae in September 1943, and the New Britain Campaign in December. The base at Milne Bay remained operational {{until the end of the}} war.|$|E

5|$|In a {{makeshift}} hospital at Plateros, Scout Alfonso and Ranger Fisher were quickly put into surgery. The shrapnel {{was removed from}} Alfonso's abdomen, and {{he was expected to}} recover if returned to American lines. Fisher's shrapnel was also removed, but with limited supplies and widespread damage to both his stomach and intestines, it was decided more extensive surgery would need to be completed in an American hospital. Mucci ordered that an <b>airstrip</b> be built in a field next to Plateros so that a plane could airlift him to American lines. Some Scouts and freed prisoners stayed behind to construct the <b>airstrip.</b>|$|E

5|$|The 51st Transport Regiment had {{constructed}} an <b>airstrip</b> on Lorengau and commenced another, known as Momote <b>Airstrip,</b> at the Momote Plantation on Los Negros. Lorengau {{was used as}} a staging point for aircraft moving between Rabaul and airstrips in North East New Guinea. The importance of the Admiralty Islands to the Japanese increased as the result of Allied advances in New Guinea and New Britain which blocked off other air routes. By February, both airstrips were unserviceable and the antiaircraft guns were silent in order to conserve ammunition and conceal their positions. Ezaki had ordered his men to neither move nor fire in daylight.|$|E
