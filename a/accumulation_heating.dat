A particular example of <b>heat</b> <b>accumulation</b> is steam condensation after LOCA (loss of coolant accident).

To evaluate tree responses to variation in chill and <b>heat</b> <b>accumulation</b> rates, partial least squares regression was used to correlate first flowering dates of chestnut (Castanea mollissima Blume) and jujube (Zizyphus jujube Mill.) in Beijing, China, with daily chill and <b>heat</b> <b>accumulation</b> between 1963 and 2008. The Dynamic Model and the Growing Degree Hour Model were used to convert daily records of minimum and maximum temperature into horticulturally meaningful metrics.

Over the past 50 years, <b>heat</b> <b>accumulation</b> during tree dormancy increased significantly, while chill accumulation remained relatively stable for both species. <b>Heat</b> <b>accumulation</b> was the main driver of bloom timing, with effects of variation in chill accumulation negligible in Beijing’s cold-winter climate.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the environmental impact}} of massive heat-pump introduction on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, dynamic simulations of the overall electricity-generation system have been performed for Belgium. The simulations are carried out with Promix, a tool that models the overall electricity-generation system. For comparison, three heating devices are considered, namely conventional boilers, heat pumps and electrical resistance heating. The introduction of electric heating at the expense of classic heating increases the demand for electricity and generates a shift of emissions from fossil-fuel heating systems to electrical power plants. The replaced classic fossil-fuel-fired heating represents emissions of about 300 [*]kton. With regard to the heat-pump scenarios, both direct heat-pump heating with a coefficient of performance (COP) of 2. 5 and <b>accumulation</b> heat-pump <b>heating</b> with a COP of 5 are investigated. The results of the simulations reveal that the massive introduction of heat-pump heating is favourable to the environment. In Belgium, the largest reductions in GHG emissions occur with heat pumps for direct heating, combined with newly commissioned combined cycle (CC) gas-fired plants or with <b>accumulation</b> heat-pump <b>heating.</b> These scenarios bring about overall GHG emission reductions of approximately 200 [*]kton compared with the reference case with conventional heating for the years 2000 and 2010. The amount of additional electricity-related emissions depends on the considered heating device. In 2010, the scenario with <b>accumulation</b> <b>heat</b> pumps results in an overall decrease of Belgian GHG emissions by 0. 15 % compared with the reference scenario. The expansion of the electricity-generation system with new CC plants has an important favourable impact on GHGs as well. In most cases, the combination of higher electricity demand and the construction of new gas-fired CC plants will lead to lower overall GHG emissions.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the environmental impact}} of massive heat-pump introduction on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in different electricity-generation systems, dynamic simulations have been carried out for four European countries, namely, Belgium, France, Germany and the Netherlands. For this purpose, the simulations are performed with Promix, a tool that models the overall electricity-generation system. Three heating devices are considered for each country, namely classic fossil-fuel heating, heat pumps and electric resistance heating. Both direct heat-pump heating with a coefficient of performance (COP) of 2. 5 and <b>accumulation</b> heat-pump <b>heating</b> with a COP of 5 are investigated. The introduction of electric heating in an electricity-generation system increases the demand for electricity and generates a shift of emissions from fossil-fuel heating systems to electrical plants. The results of the simulations reveal that the massive introduction of either heat pump or resistance heating is always favourable to the environment in France. The most environmentally friendly scenario in 2010 is projected to reduce GHG emissions by about 3. 8 Â Mton compared to the reference scenario.

Spring {{phenology}} of perennial fruit crops is {{to a large}} extent determined by temperature during effective chilling (endo-dormancy) and <b>heat</b> <b>accumulation</b> (eco-dormancy) periods. We used the apricot flowering records of the UK National Fruit Collections (NFC) to determine the influence of temperature trends over recent decades (1960 to 2014) on apricot (Prunus armeniaca L.) flowering time. Using Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression, we determined the respective periods for calculating chill and <b>heat</b> <b>accumulation.</b> Results suggested intervals between September 27 th and February 26 th and between December 31 st and April 12 th as the effective chilling and warming periods, respectively. Flowering time was correlated with temperature during both periods, with warming during chilling corresponding to flowering delays by 4. 82 d°C- 1, while warming during <b>heat</b> <b>accumulation</b> was associated with bloom advances by 9. 85 d°C- 1. <b>Heat</b> <b>accumulation</b> started after accumulating 62. 7 ± 5. 6 Chill Portions, and flowering occurred after a further 3744 ± 1538 Growing Degree Hours (above a base temperature of 4 °C, with optimal growth at 26 °C).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} the differential gene expression profile in two typical traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndromes {{of patients with}} chronic hepatitis B (CHB), and to find the relationship between TCM syndromes and gene expressions. METHODS: Patients with CHB were collected from Department of Liver Diseases of Longhua Hospital in Shanghai and diagnosed as dual deficiency of liver and kidney yin syndrome (n= 3) or <b>accumulation</b> of dampness <b>heat</b> syndrome (n= 3). Three healthy volunteers were used as a control. Blood samples were collected before treatment. After total RNA was isolated from leukocytes, the gene expression profiles were detected by microarray. For confirming the gene expressions, a further 10 patients with dual deficiency of liver and kidney yin syndrome or <b>accumulation</b> of dampness <b>heat</b> syndrome and 10 healthy volunteers were enrolled. Their peripheral blood {{was used to test}} the gene expression by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) which was differently expressed by microarray. RESULTS: Microarray analysis identified that there were significant differences in gene expression between patients with dual deficiency of liver and kidney yin syndrome and patients with <b>accumulation</b> of dampness <b>heat</b> syndrome, as well as between CHB patients and healthy volunteers. Patients with dual deficiency of liver and kidney yin syndrome and <b>accumulation</b> of dampness <b>heat</b> syndrome were fully distinguished by clustering of 403 differentially expressed genes (P< 0. 05). A total of 239 genes were significantly differentially expressed (absolute value of foldchange≥ 2, P< 0. 05), among which 142 were up-regulated and 97 were down-regulated. Genes specially regulated by the dual deficiency of liver and kidney yin syndrome were mainly related to peroxide activity and stem cell maintenance; genes specially regulated by the <b>accumulation</b> of dampness <b>heat</b> syndrome were mainly related to cytokines, immune and inflammatory responses. ATP-binding cassette, sub-family C (CFTR/MRP), member 3, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α and phosphatidic acid phosphatase type 2 A mRNA expressions detected by RT-PCR were similar to the results of microarray. CONCLUSION: Differential gene expressions are observed in CHB patients with dual deficiency of liver and kidney yin syndrome and <b>accumulation</b> of dampness <b>heat</b> syndrome, indicating that there is molecular foundation in the classification of TCM syndrome.
