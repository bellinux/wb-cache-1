50|$|VGF or VGF nerve {{growth factor}} {{inducible}} is a protein and neuropeptide that {{may play a}} role in regulating energy homeostasis, metabolism and synaptic plasticity. The protein was first discovered in 1985 by Levi et al. in an experiment with PC12 cells and its name is non-acronymic. VGF gene encodes a precursor which is divided by proteolysis to polypeptides of different mass, which have a variety of functions, the best studied of which is the role of TLQP-21 in the control of appetite and inflammation. The expression of VGF and VGF-derived peptides is detected in a subset of neurons in the central and peripheral nervous systems and specific populations of endocrine cells in the <b>adenohypophysis,</b> adrenal medulla, gastrointestinal tract, and pancreas. VGF expression is induced by NGF, CREB and BDNF and regulated by neurotrophin-3. Physical exercise significantly increases VGF expression in mice hippocampal tissue and upregulates a neurotrophic signaling cascade thought to underlie the action of antidepressants.|$|E
5000|$|Oxytocin and {{vasopressin}} (also called anti-diuretic hormone), the two peptide hormones of {{the posterior}} pituitary gland (the neurohypophysis), are secreted from the nerve endings of magnocellular neuroendocrine cells into the systemic circulation. The cell {{bodies of the}} oxytocin and vasopressin neurons are in the paraventricular nucleus and supraoptic nucleus, respectively, and the electrical activity of these neurons is regulated by afferent synaptic inputs from other brain regions. By contrast, the hormones of the anterior pituitary gland (the <b>adenohypophysis)</b> are secreted from endocrine cells that, in mammals, are not directly innervated, yet the secretion of these hormones (adrenocorticotrophic hormone, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, prolactin, and growth hormone) remains {{under the control of}} the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus controls the anterior pituitary gland via releasing factors and release-inhibiting factors; these are blood-borne substances [...] means via bloodstream and not by the lymphatic system nor air, nor any other modes of transport released by hypothalamic neurons into blood vessels at the base of the brain, at the median eminence. These vessels, the hypothalamo-hypophysial portal vessels, carry the hypothalamic factors to the anterior pituitary, where they bind to specific receptors on the surface of the hormone-producing cells.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Apoptosis is {{involved}} in fundamental processes of life, like embryonic development, tissue homeostasis, or immune defense. Defects in apoptosis cause or contribute to developmental malformation, cancer, and degenerative disorders. Methods The developing <b>adenohypophysis</b> area of rat fetuses was studied at the embryonic stage 13. 5 (gestational day) for apoptotic and proliferative cell activities using histological serial sections. Results A high cell proliferation rate was observed throughout the <b>adenohypophysis.</b> In contrast, apoptotic cells visualized by evidence of active caspase- 3, were detected only in the basal epithelial cones as an introducing event for fusion and closure of the pharyngeal roof. Conclusion We can clearly show {{an increasing number of}} apoptotic events only at the basic fusion sides of the <b>adenohypophysis</b> {{as well as in the}} opening region of this organ. Apoptotic destruction of epithelial cells at the basal cones of the <b>adenohypophysis</b> begins even before differentiation of the adenohypophyseal cells and their contact with the neurohypophysis.

40|$|It is well {{recognized}} that gonadotropic {{function of the}} <b>adenohypophysis</b> is regulated by the hypothalamus in the domestic fowl. The present study deals with cytological changes of the <b>adenohypophysis</b> and the quantitative variation of PAS positive contents in the gland following the hypothalamic lesion in the White Leghorn cocks. <b>Adenohypophysis,</b> testes and the accessory organ weights were markedly decreased after the electrolytic lesion involving the basal tuberal or posterior median eminence region of the hypothalamus. Obvious cytological degeneration of basophils in the <b>adenohypophysis</b> was also observed in these cocks, and PAS positive contents in the cytoplasm of the cell were decreased significantly in microspectrophotometrical measurement. It is concluded from these results and the atrophic state of gonadal organs that the gonadotropic hormone output from the hypophysis after the injury of basal tuberal or posterior median eminence region must be at a very low level in consequence of disruption or at least great impairment of neural and vascular connexions between <b>adenohypophysis</b> and the hypothalamus...|$|E
40|$|The <b>adenohypophysis</b> {{consists}} {{of at least}} six different cell types, somatotropes, lactotropes, thyrotropes, melanotropes, corticotropes, and gonadotropes. In mouse, cloning of spontaneous mutations and gene targeting has revealed multiple genes required for different steps of <b>adenohypophysis</b> development. Here, we report {{the results of a}} systematic search for genes required for <b>adenohypophysis</b> formation and patterning in zebrafish. By screening F 3 offspring of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-mutagenized founder fish, we isolated eleven mutants with absent or reduced expression of GH, the product of somatotropes, but a normally developing hypothalamus. Of such mutants, eight were further analyzed and mapped. They define four genes essential for different steps of <b>adenohypophysis</b> development. Two of them, lia and pia, affect the entire <b>adenohypophysis,</b> whereas the other two are required for a subset of adenohypophyseal cell types only. The third gene is zebrafish pit 1 and is required for lactotropes, thyrotropes, and somatotropes, similar to its mouse ortholog, whereas the fourth, aal, is required for corticotropes, melanotropes, thyrotropes, and somatotropes, but not lactotropes. In conclusion, the isolated zebrafish mutants confirm principles of <b>adenohypophysis</b> development revealed in mouse, thereby demonstrating the high degree of molecular and mechanistic conservation among the different vertebrate species. In addition, they point to thus far unknown features of <b>adenohypophysis</b> development, such as the existence of a new lineage of pituitary cells, which partially overlaps with the Pit 1 lineage.

40|$|In this study, {{using an}} enzymatic HPLC method in {{combination}} with D-aspartate oxidase, we show that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) is present at nanomolar levels in rat nervous system and endocrine glands as a natural compound, and it is biosynthesized in vivo and in vitro. D-aspartate (D-Asp) is its natural precursor and also occurs as an endogenous compound. Among the endocrine glands, the highest quantities of D-Asp (78 +/- 12 nmol/g) and NMDA (8. 4 +/- 1. 2 nmol/g) occur in the <b>adenohypophysis,</b> whereas the hypothalamus represents {{the area of the}} nervous system where these amino acids are most abundant (55 +/- 9 and 5. 6 +/- 1. 1 nmol/g for D-Asp and NMDA, respectively). When D-Asp is administered to rats by ip injection, there is a significant uptake of D-Asp into the <b>adenohypophysis</b> and {{a significant increase in the}} concentration of NMDA in the <b>adenohypophysis,</b> hypothalamus and hippocampus, suggesting that D-Asp is an endogenous precursor for NMDA biosynthesis. Experiments conducted on tissue homogenates confirm that D-Asp is the precursor of the NMDA and that the enzyme catalyzing this reaction is a methyltransferase. S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) is the methyl group donor. In vivo experiments consisting of ip injections of sodium D-aspartate show that this amino acid induced a significant serum PRL elevation and this effect is dose and time dependent. In vitro experiments conducted on isolated <b>adenohypophysis</b> or <b>adenohypophysis</b> coincubated with the hypothalamus, showed that the release of PRL is caused by a direct action of D-Asp on the pituitary gland and also mediated by the indirect action of NMDA on the hypothalamus. Then, the latter induces the release of a putative factor that in turn stimulates the <b>adenohypophysis</b> reinforcing the PRL release. In conclusion, our data suggest that D-Asp and NMDA are present endogenously in the rat and are involved in the modulation of PRL release...|$|E
40|$|The {{pituitary}} gland {{is composed of}} the <b>adenohypophysis</b> and neurohypophysis. The <b>adenohypophysis</b> contains endocrine cells, folliculo-stellate (FS) cells, and marginal layer cells, whereas the neurohypophysis mainly comprises axons and pituicytes. To understand the molecular nature of water transfer in the {{pituitary gland}}, we examined the immunohistochemical localization of the membrane water channels aquaporin- 4 (AQP 4) and AQP 5 in rat tissue. Double immunofluorescence analysis of AQP 4 and S 100 protein, a known marker for FS cells, marginal layer cells, and pituicytes, clearly revealed that FS cells and marginal layer cells in the <b>adenohypophysis</b> and the pituicytes in pars nervosa are positive for AQP 4. AQP 5 {{was found to be}} localized at the apical membrane in some marginal layer cells surrounding the Rathke’s residual pouch, in which AQP 4 was observed to be localized on the basolateral membranes.

40|$|The {{pituitary}} gland {{is the major}} endocrine gland in the forebrain. The hormones secreted from this gland regulate vital processes such as reproduction, growth and stress response. Distinct endocrine cells arise from pituitary precursors cells. The endocrine cells are spatially organized along the anterior-posterior axis within the anterior lobe of the pituitary, the <b>adenohypophysis.</b> Several signaling molecules {{have been shown to}} play roles in the development of this endocrine gland. Previous work in our lab showed that Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) is required for induction and patterning of the <b>adenohypophysis.</b> Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is involved in many developmental processes including induction, patterning and differentiation of many tissues. In addition, independent studies show that Fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) signaling also plays a {{role in the development of}} zebrafish <b>adenohypophysis.</b> ^ One of the main aims of my dissertation was to determine how the Hh and Fgf signaling pathways specify the functional patterning of the <b>adenohypophysis.</b> Using small molecule inhibitors I show that high levels of Hh signaling are required for the formation of the anterior <b>adenohypophysis,</b> the pars distalis (PD) and high levels of Fgf signaling are required for the formation of the posterior <b>adenohypophysis,</b> the pars intermedia (PI). My dissertation work also shows that high Hh levels are required for differentiation of the endocrine cells in the PD, and in contrast high Fgf levels are required for differentiation of the endocrine cells in the PI. Using live-imaging of a transgenic zebrafish line, I show that the PD and PI originate from distinct regions. My analyses has revealed that graded Hh and Fgf signaling help pattern the <b>adenohypophysis</b> along anterior-posterior axis by guiding endocrine cell differentiation in a dose dependent manner. ^ A related aim of my research was to analyze the role of Hh signaling in zebrafish neural tube patterning. The transcriptional response to varying Hh levels is well characterized in chick and mouse neural tube, and this transcriptional response has been partially described in zebrafish. The analysis of the Hh transcriptional response in wild type, Hh mutant and Hh over-expressing embryos show that there is a conserved transcriptional response to Hh signaling in the zebrafish neural tube. My comprehensive analyses of the Hh transcriptional response in the zebrafish neural tube provides a useful tool for the characterization of Hh signaling in zebrafish. ...|$|E
