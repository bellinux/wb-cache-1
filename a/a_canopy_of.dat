5|$|The {{region is}} semi-arid, and the {{vegetation}} is generally scrubland. Muckaty Station {{lies at the}} boundary of two bioregions, Tanami and Sturt Plateau. The Tanami bioregion is made up primarily of sandplains vegetated with bootlace oak (Hakea lorea), desert bloodwoods (Corymbia species), acacias and grevilleas, together with spinifex grasslands. The Sturt Plateau bioregion also includes spinifex grasslands, but with <b>a</b> <b>canopy</b> <b>of</b> bloodwood trees.|$|E
5|$|Fish, {{which may}} have been preyed upon by smaller crocodilians, are {{represented}} by teeth and scales. They include a myliobatiform ray referred to the genus Baibisha; an indeterminate member of the Neopterygii; a semionotid referred to the genus Lepidotes; a gar related to Atractosteus; a pycnodontid referred to the genus Stephanodus; and an indeterminate bowfin. Indeterminate caudatans (salamanders) and mammals are also present. As for plants, pollen samples indicate a tiered forest surrounding the lakes of the Mussentuchit, containing <b>a</b> <b>canopy</b> <b>of</b> tree ferns, araucarias, and conifers, accompanying an undergrowth of ferns, small gymnosperms, and flowering plants. Algae would also have been present in the waters of the lakes. These plants would have provided an abundant source of food for Eolambia.|$|E

5|$|Several walking {{trails in}} the park vary in hiking {{difficulty}} on Pine Island, where visitors can cross hardwood hammocks, pinelands, and freshwater sloughs. Starting at the Royal Palm Visitor Center, the Anhinga Trail is a half-mile self-guided tour through a sawgrass marsh where visitors can see alligators, marsh and wading birds, turtles, and bromeliads. Its proximity to Homestead and its accessibility make {{it one of the}} most visited sites {{in the park}}. The nearby Gumbo Limbo Trail is also self-guided, at half a mile long. It loops through <b>a</b> <b>canopy</b> <b>of</b> hardwood hammocks that include gumbo limbo, royal palms (Roystonea), strangler figs (Ficus aurea), and a variety of epiphytes. Twenty eight miles (45km) of trails start near the Long Pine Key campgrounds and wind through Long Pine Key, well-suited for offroad cycling through the pine rocklands in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness Area. Two boardwalks allow visitors to walk through a cypress forest at Pa-Hay-O-Kee, which also features a two-story overlook, and another at Mahogany Hammock (referring to Swietenia mahagoni) that takes hikers through a dense forest in the middle of a freshwater marl prairie. Closer to Flamingo, more rugged trails take visitors through mangrove swamps, along Florida Bay. Christian Point Trail, Snake Bight Trail, Rowdy Bend Trail and Coastal Prairie Trail allow viewing of shorebirds and wading birds among the mangroves. Portions of the trails may be impassable depending on the time of year, because of mosquitoes and water levels. Ranger-led tours take place in the busier season only.|$|E

25|$|Outdoors {{time-lapse}} photography {{presents a}} {{unique set of}} challenges: the varying light and temperatures in particular can cause many problems. To film bluebells under <b>a</b> <b>canopy</b> <b>of</b> beech trees, for example, cameraman Richard Kirby covered them with a thick canvas tent that was lit from within to simulate daylight. He then used a motion-controlled camera to obtain a tracking shot, moving it slightly after each exposure.|$|E

For a projected daily attendance of 55,000, Euro Disney planned to serve an estimated 14,000 people per hour inside the Euro Disneyland park. In order to accomplish this, 29 restaurants were built {{inside the park}} (with a further 11 restaurants built at the Euro Disney resort hotels and five at Festival Disney). Menus and prices were varied with an American flavour predominant and Disney's precedent of serving alcoholic beverages was continued in the park.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} and specific use of chrism {{is in the}} Anointing during the Coronation of the British monarch. In {{this part of the}} Service, the Archbishop of Canterbury anoints the Sovereign on the head, hands and heart. This is considered to be the holiest rite of the Service, so much so that it is shielded from the congregation's view by <b>a</b> <b>canopy</b> <b>of</b> state. This is also why it was not filmed during the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, nor was it photographed in 1937 during the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. It occurs just prior to the presentation of the Crown Jewels to the Sovereign, which is in turn followed by the actual Coronation.|$|E
25|$|The verdant forests on eastern {{exposures}} are fed by {{the year}} round Graham Creek and its tributaries. The most common eastern slope plant community is the oak woodland, which has <b>a</b> <b>canopy</b> <b>of</b> coast live oak, Garry oak, black oak, Pacific madrone, bigleaf maple and California laurel. In some of the steeper, cooler riparian zones there are also small groves of coast redwood, Sequoia sempervirens. In these oak woodlands, the dominant understory plants are toyon, blackberry, western poison-oak and in occasional drier patches some coyote brush. Common animals observed include California mule deer, gray squirrel, raccoon, skunk and opossum. Less frequently bobcat and mountain lion are seen. There is abundant birdlife including the scrub jay, Steller's jay, acorn woodpecker and junco. Because of the rich soils and mild climate, there are significant sized vineyards at elevations up to 1,700 feet (518m) on the northeast flanks of the mountain, positioned like mosaics in a patchwork of mostly oak forest; these grapes contribute to some premium varietal wines, {{some of which are}} marketed as premium Sonoma Valley appellations.|$|E

500|$|The {{procession}} {{lasted from}} morning to night. The streets {{were lined with}} tableaux vivants displaying scenes from the Crusades, Deësis and the Gates of Paradise. More than a thousand burghers stood along the route; those on one side were dressed in green facing, those on the opposite in red. The procession began at the Porte de St. Denis and passed under <b>a</b> <b>canopy</b> <b>of</b> sky-blue cloth beneath which children dressed as angels sang, winding into the Rue Saint-Denis before arriving at the Notre Dame for the coronation ceremony. As Tuchman describes the event, [...] "So many wonders were {{to be seen and}} admired that it was evening before the procession crossed the bridge leading to Notre Dame and the climactic display." ...|$|E
500|$|Once {{seated in}} this chair, <b>a</b> <b>canopy</b> <b>of</b> golden cloth is held over the monarch's {{head for the}} anointing. The duty of acting as canopy-bearers was {{performed}} in recent coronations by four Knights of the Garter. This element of the coronation service is considered sacred and is concealed from public gaze; it was not photographed in 1937 or televised in 1953. The Dean of Westminster pours consecrated oil from an eagle-shaped ampulla into a filigreed spoon with which the Archbishop of Canterbury anoints the sovereign {{in the form of}} a cross on the hands, head, and heart. The Coronation Spoon is the only part of the mediaeval Crown Jewels which survived the Commonwealth of England. While performing the anointing, the Archbishop recites a consecratory formula recalling the anointing of King Solomon by Nathan the prophet and Zadok the priest.|$|E
500|$|Light {{at the red}} end of {{the visible}} {{spectrum}} has been observed to be required {{for the development of}} R.palmatus fruit bodies, contrary to the typical requirement for blue light seen with many other mushroom species. Fruiting occurs in the presence of green, yellow or red light with wavelengths above 500nm, but only when blue light (under 500nm) is absent. Consequently, phenotypic variations observed in the field—such as size, shape, and cap color—may be influenced by differing conditions of light color and intensity. For example, specimens grown in the laboratory under green light had fruit bodies with short, straight stems and pale orange, large caps with well-developed ridges and pits, an appearance similar to specimens found in the field that were growing under <b>a</b> <b>canopy</b> <b>of</b> green leaves. Laboratory-grown specimens under amber light had bright orange, small caps with less pronounced similarly, field specimens found in the fall, after the leaves had fallen, were more orange to orange-pink in color.|$|E

Additionally, ship owners encouraged their deckhands to sing as they worked. [...] "Delius never forgot the singing as he heard it, day or night, carried sweet and clear across the water to his verandah at Solano Grove, whenever a steam-ship passed; {{it is hard to imagine}} conditions less conducive to cultivating oranges—or more conducive to composing." ...|$|E
500|$|Catherine was {{formally}} stripped of her title as queen and Anne was consequently crowned queen consort on 1 June 1533 in a magnificent ceremony at Westminster Abbey with a banquet afterwards. She {{was the last}} queen consort of England to be crowned separately from her husband. Unlike any other queen consort, Anne was crowned with St Edward's Crown, which had previously been used to crown only a monarch. Historian Alice Hunt suggests that this was done because Anne's pregnancy was visible by then and she was carrying the heir who was presumed to be male. On the previous day, Anne had taken part in an elaborate procession {{through the streets of}} London seated in a litter of [...] "white cloth of gold" [...] that rested on two palfreys clothed to the ground in white damask, while the barons of the Cinque Ports held <b>a</b> <b>canopy</b> <b>of</b> cloth of gold over her head.

500|$|The {{origins of}} Cyclone Winifred {{can be traced}} to a {{tropical}} low first noted approximately [...] north of Cairns, Queensland on 27January 1986. The system initially drifted to the northwest, exhibiting characteristics indicating gradual organization. On the morning of 29January, it curved southward while slowly strengthening. Observations gathered by the Geostationary Meteorological Satellite (GMS) on 30January evidenced that the low had developed into a tropical cyclone while maintaining a minimum atmospheric pressure of 995mbar (29.38inHg). As a result, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) subsequently designated the disturbance the name Winifred at 1400UTC as it meandered southward, the sixth named storm of the 1985–86 Australian region cyclone season. The cyclone continued to steadily intensify, attaining Category1-equivalent intensity on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale during the morning of 1February, with winds of [...] Forecasting of Winifred's track was impeded by the presence of <b>a</b> <b>canopy</b> <b>of</b> persistent high-level cirrus clouds shielding the eye and rainbands of the cyclone throughout its course, leading to inaccuracies in locating the cyclone's centre through satellite observations.|$|E
