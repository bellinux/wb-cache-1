50|$|The South American {{fur seal}} is found on neotropical ocean coasts from the Paracas Peninsula of {{southern}} Peru south to Cape Horn on the Pacific coast, and northward to southern Brazil on the Atlantic coast. They {{are also found}} on the Falkland Islands, Staten Island, and Escondida Island. A. australis seals prefer rocky shores and islands, particularly those with steep slopes, which provide shady areas where they can escape {{the heat of the}} sun. They have been found in sea caves in Peru, where some climb up to 15 m to find a spot to rest. There have been isolated records from continental Ecuador, the Galápagos Islands, and the Gorgona Island (Colombia).Anatomical information for the southern fur seals, <b>Arctocephalus</b> <b>spp.,</b> is scant.|$|E
40|$|Some 101 {{fur seals}} <b>Arctocephalus</b> <b>spp.</b> and five {{southern}} elephant seals Mirounga leonina were recorded entangled in anthropogenic debris {{over ten years}} at Marion Island, Southern Ocean. Approximately 67 % of materials causing entanglement originated in the fishing industry. Polypropylene packaging straps were the most common entangling material, followed by trawl netting. Longline hooks embedded in animals, fishing line and portions of plastic were only encountered after the inception in 1996 of longline fishing in the waters around Marion Island. The incidence of entanglement of <b>Arctocephalus</b> <b>spp.</b> during the 1996 - 2001 longline fisheries period {{increased by more than}} 50 % over that of the 1991 - 1996 pre-longline fisheries period. An estimated 0. 24 % of the populations of fur seals were entangled. The numbers of entangled M. leonina are very low. Longline fishing has had a direct, albeit small, impact on the pinniped population...|$|E
40|$|Food web models {{depend on}} {{identifying}} which taxa are eaten {{and in what}} proportion they are consumed. Arctocephalus seals are generalist foragers and are an ongoing focus of Southern Hemisphere marine ecosystem research. This is the first feeding experiment to use <b>Arctocephalus</b> <b>spp.</b> to assess the utility of hard part scat analysis for diet estimation, based on mixed prey diets integrated over several days. Recovery rates of otoliths were extremely low for all taxa (0 – 9...|$|E
40|$|A {{biological}} {{survey of}} the Prince Edward Islands took place in December 2008. The survey repeated an earlier {{survey of the}} populations of surface-nesting seabirds on both islands and of fur seals (<b>Arctocephalus</b> <b>spp.)</b> and alien plants on Prince Edward Island in December 2001. Observations on burrowing seabirds, macro-invertebrates and plant communities on Prince Edward Island and an oceanographic survey of surrounding waters were also included. The survey confirmed many of the observations made on the earlier survey and permitted an assessment of trends in the abundance and distribution of biota since 2001...|$|E
40|$|The {{fur seal}} (<b>Arctocephalus</b> <b>spp.</b> and Callorhinus spp., {{members of the}} {{pinniped}} family) is a mammal with the unusual capability to modulate its lactation cycle by turning milk production on and off without the typical mammalian regression and involution of the mammary gland. Lactation has evolved from constraints arising from the spatial and temporal separation of infant nursing and maternal foraging as the mother gives birth and feeds the pup on land while acquisition of nutrients for milk production occurs at sea. The lactation cycle begins with the female fur seal undergoing a perinatal fast of approximately 1 wk, after which time she departs the breeding colony to forage at sea. For {{the remainder of the}} long lactation period (116 – 540 days), the mother alternates between short periods ashore suckling the young with longer periods of up to 4 wk of foraging at sea. Milk production continues while foraging at sea, but at less than 20...|$|E
40|$|The {{diet and}} predators of Loligo sanpaulensis (Cephalopoda: Loliginidae) on the {{southern}} Brazilian shelf were studied by examining the stomach contents of 668 long-finned squid (12 – 184 mm mantle length) caught by bottom trawl and the stomach contents of 47 potential predators, including stranded penguins and marine mammals as well as fish and cephalopods caught with diverse fishing gears in the region. Of 313 long-finned squid stomachs containing food, fish occurred in 36. 4 % of stomachs, crustaceans in 23. 3 % and cephalopods in 6. 4 %. Identified prey included demersal fish, shrimps and conspecifics. Loligo sanpaulensis was preyed on by 31 of the 47 potential predatory species examined. The frequency of occurrence (FO) was high (> 20 %) in the stomach contents of La Plata dolphins Pontoporia blainvillei, penguins Spheniscus magellanicus, fur seals <b>Arctocephalus</b> <b>spp.,</b> the benthic shark Mustelus canis and the benthic finfish Astroscopus sexpinosus and Percophis brasiliensis. It was less important (5 – 20 % FO) for the benthic and demersal fish Helicolenus lahillei, Paralichthys isosceles, P. patagonicus, Merluccius hubbsi and Urophycis mystacea, and of minor importance (2 – 5 % FO) in the diet of the finfish Trichiurus lepturus, Cynoscion guatucupa, Macrodon ancylodon, Pagrus pagrus and Pomatomus saltatrix. Loligo sanpaulensis {{seems to be a}} link in the pelagic and benthic foodwebs of the southern Brazilian shelf, because it is preyed on by such high-level predators as marine mammals and penguins, and by several of the most abundant fish found in the region...|$|E
40|$|In marine ecosystems, {{identifying}} {{what and}} where animals eat are inferred through indirect methods. These methods are often inadequate and {{our ability to}} measure and predict ecological interactions remains poor. The accuracy of diet estimation in marine animals may be improved {{by the use of}} DNA based techniques, a potentially valuable but largely untested approach. The predictive power of ecological models may also be improved by synoptic integration of diet with spatially explicit foraging activity. A further gain may be achieved by considering individual variation in foraging behaviour, as reflected by differences in diet and core foraging areas within a population. The objective of this thesis was to investigate the utility of DNA based diet analysis in foraging ecology, explored in the context of top marine generalist predators, southern hemisphere fur seals (<b>Arctocephalus</b> <b>spp.).</b> The effectiveness of DNA based diet analysis for identifying trophic relationships is assessed in a series of captive and field based studies. The diet and foraging activity of individuals in a free-living population are then matched both spatially and temporally, and predator-habitat relationships are modelled with reference to specific predator-prey combinations. The accuracy of DNA based scat analysis for diet estimation was assessed in Arctocephalus seals fed mixed prey diets integrated over several days. This approach was compared with the most commonly used method, morphological scat analysis. Both methods inferred recent diet (within 40 hours), but detection of robust prey consumed was 1. 4 - 5. 8 times more likely using genetic analysis than morphological analysis. Presence/absence data was an ineffective quantitative measure of diet using either DNA or morphological methods. Faecal samples from 54 wild lactating Arctocephalus gazella were analysed for prey remains using both DNA and morphological techniques. Morphological analysis implied that nearly all individuals (91...|$|E
