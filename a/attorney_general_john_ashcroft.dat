Screenings in Minnesota were also organized by Coleen Rowley, a former FBI agent turned whistle-blower, who called the film [...] "a must-see documentary". The campaign continued through social networking sites and interviews in the press, radio [...] and on PBS but has so far failed to secure its objective of Rice's arrest, prosecution and imprisonment. Efforts to this end were escalated in May 2010, following the announcement that Rice was to play a concert with Aretha Franklin. Doggart responded to this by corralling a group of human rights activists, including Rowley, War Criminals Watch, and Down With Tyranny, to pressure Franklin and the Philadelphia Orchestra to dump her from the concert billing, and to encourage either a citizen's arrest, or one instigated by <b>Attorney</b> <b>General</b> Eric Holder. These protests continued at a Denver University awards dinner, where Madeleine Albright presented the 2010 Josef Korbel Outstanding Alumni Award to Rice, while activists warned guests outside that [...] "there's a war criminal in the area".|$|R
