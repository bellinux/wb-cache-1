40|$|Controlling {{interface}} clearances is {{the most}} cost effective method of enhancing turbomachinery performance. Seals control turbomachinery leakages, coolant flows and contribute to overall system rotordynamic stability. In many instances, sealing interfaces and coatings are sacrificial, like lubricants, giving up their integrity {{for the benefit of}} the component. They are subjected to abrasion, erosion, oxidation, incursive rubs, foreign object damage (FOD) and deposits as well as extremes in thermal, mechanical, aerodynamic and impact loadings. Tribological pairing of materials control how well and how long these interfaces will be effective in controlling flow. A variety of seal types and materials are required to satisfy turbomachinery sealing demands. These seals must be properly designed to maintain the interface clearances. In some cases, this will mean machining adjacent surfaces, yet in many other applications, coatings are employed for optimum performance. Many seals are coating composites fabricated on superstructures or substrates that are coated with sacrificial materials which can be refurbished either in situ or by removal, stripping, recoating and replacing until substrate life is exceeded. For blade and knife tip sealing an important class of materials known as <b>abradables</b> permit blade or knife rubbing without significant damage or wear to the rotating element while maintaining an effective sealing interface. Most such tip interfaces are passive, yet some, as for the high-pressure turbine (HPT) case or shroud, are actively controlled. This work presents an overview of turbomachinery sealing. Areas covered include: characteristics of gas and steam turbine sealing applications and environments, benefits of sealing, types of standard static and dynamics seals, advanced seal designs, as well as life and limitations issues...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Abradable</b> Powder Coating {{provides}} engine {{benefits such as}} higher efficiency, reduced {{noise and}} greater durability when applied on pistons.

40|$|In aero engines a {{thermally}} sprayed <b>abradable</b> {{material is}} applied {{to the inside of the}} casing in order to provide a seal around the blade tips of the compressor blades. During running and handling the blades cut a channel into the <b>abradable</b> material.

This thesis aims to investigate and characterise these rubs and provide recommendations for changes to the running and handling procedure, the <b>abradable</b> or the blade tip that will improve sealing and reduce blade wear. The AlSi polyester vs Ti(6 Al 4 V) and NiCrAl bentonite vs Inconel 718 rubs have been investigated through high speed rub testing.

40|$|LecturePg. 77 - 90 Clearances between sealing {{devices of}} {{rotating}} and stationary components of turbomachinery {{have always been}} important to engineers in controlling gas leakages.

This combination is not currently possible in late stages of the compressor as hard <b>abradable</b> materials can cause titanium blades to wear excessively. One solution to this is to add a surface treatment to the blade tips. Two surface treatments have been investigated, firstly cubic boron nitride (cBN) grits are bonded to the tip of the blade by electroplating. Secondly blades are coated in Cr(Al) N by cathodic arc deposition.

40|$|International audienceThis paper reports recent {{research}} on <b>abradable</b> materials employed for aero-engine applications. Such thermal spray coatings are used extensively within the gas turbine, {{applied to the}} inner surface of compressor and turbine shroud sections, coating {{the periphery of the}} blade rotation path. The function of an <b>abradable</b> seal is to wear preferentially when rotating blades come into contact with it, while minimizing over-tip clearance and improving the efficiency of the engine. Thermal spraying of an <b>abradable</b> coating onto a substrate imparts two components of residual stress; rapid quenching stresses as the spray material cools on impact and stresses arising from differential thermal contraction. In-service thermal stresses are superimposed by the differential expansion of these bonded layers. The combination of the production and operation history will lead to thermal-mechanical fatigue damage within the <b>abradable</b> coating. The present paper will describe the numerical modeling and sensitivity analysis of the thermal spray process. The sensitivity of residual stresses (with varying material properties, coating/substrate thickness, Poisson's ratio, and substrate temperature) predicted by the Tsui and Clyne progressive deposition model enabled identification of performance drivers to coating integrity.

40|$|Metco 320 is a AlSi-hBN-polyester <b>abradable,</b> used in {{the high}} {{pressure}} compressor of commercial gas turbines. The material response to cyclic heating and cooling, and the resulting changes in microstructure, {{as well as their}} associated failure mechanisms were investigated. It was found that the top surface layer of the <b>abradable</b> liner degrades over its lifetime. During thermal cycling hBN is removed from the material’s microstructure, which results in the degradation of the <b>abradable</b> and increased brittleness of the top surface. Furthermore, material cracking and delamination behaviour during service was successfully reproduced in the laboratory. The cracking and delamination observations made during overhaul, were replicated using cyclic water-quenching, but the spallation of <b>abradable</b> material did not occur. Investigations into material properties and their influence upon the <b>abradable</b> failure mechanics revealed, that soft M 320 matched the observations made during engine overhauls. It could also be established, that the plasma spray process, grit blasting, surface treatment after deposition and the transient of the substrate affect the abradable’s performance and life-time, when heat cycled. Some service casings suffer from premature liner loss. These unscheduled overhauls are costly and their number is desired to be reduced, if possible eliminated. In order to control the material failures, the stresses introduced into the <b>abradable</b> seal during manufacturing need to be reduced, since this is one of main drivers for material cracking and delamination. Furthermore, it was established, that material at the top end of the hardness specification performed better in service. This is due to the fact, that more AlSi metal matrix is present in the microstructure and the hBN loss does not affect the material integrity as much as in soft material. 2 D and 3 D modelling showed temperature and strain profiles evolving during the quenching process. These show the areas of high strain, which are consistent with the crack initiation areas observed during testing. It can be concluded, that M 320 <b>abradable</b> is a very complex material system, which is influenced by several parameters.

40|$|The {{following}} report {{investigates the}} use of <b>abradable</b> seal technology in industrial steam turbine applications. <b>Abradable</b> seals are a highly adaptable, widely applicable and cheap method of improving seal performance. By retrofitting <b>abradable</b> coatings to existing labyrinth seals, improvements {{in the range of}} 0. 5 % - 1 % power output are seen with cost returns within two years [1]. The intention of this investigation was to develop fundamental understanding of the seal degradation process. A Multi Oxidation and Incursion Steam Test (MOIST) rig was designed from concept, through detailed design and finally commissioned. During commissioning the capabilities of the MOIST rig were defined. Although flowing steam operation was not achieved during this investigation, a theoretically proofed steam system is in place for future development. High temperature operation was achieved, although not reliably. Reliable, repeatable atmospheric tests were developed, representative of the start-up and shut-down operations of an industrial steam turbine. These tests produced relative velocities up to 121 ms- 1 between coatings and blades, and incursion rates up to 50 μms- 1. ST 12 T, Nimonic 80 A and Nimonic 101 blade materials were tested against a bentonite-NiCrAl <b>abradable</b> coating. The results suggest that the bentonite-NiCrAl <b>abradable</b> coating tested was highly suitable as an <b>abradable</b> coating for all blade materials. Additionally, high temperature tests are necessary to fully prove {{the use of}} blade materials against coating systems. Simultaneously, non-MOIST rig oxidation testing was performed in the range of 580 ˚C - 800 ˚C in static air and 580 ˚C in flowing steam for exposure times up to 5000 hrs. Bentonite-NiCrAl top coat - NiAl bond coat and either a STG- 9 T or IN 625 substrate were analysed to devise mechanistic models for the oxidation of the top coat, bond coat, substrate and all associated interfaces. It was concluded that steam oxidation is intrinsically different to air oxidation and that adapting the bond coat to include Cr would significantly improve the oxidation resistance and service life of the coating system investigated...|$|E

The deposition of an <b>abradable</b> coating on casings {{is one of the}} technologies used to reduce this blade-casing clearance and ensure blade integrity in the event of blade-casing contact. Aircraft in-service condi-tions may lead to interactions between the blade tip and the coated casing, during which wear of the <b>abradable</b> coating, blade dynamics and interacting force are critical yet little-understood issues. In order to study blade/abradable-coating interactions of a few tens of milliseconds, experiments were conducted on a dedicated test rig. The experi-mental data were analyzed with the aim of determining the friction-induced vibrational modes of the blade. This involved a time-frequency analysis of the experimental blade strain using the Continuous Wavelet Transform, combined with a modal analysis of the blade. The latter was carried out with two kinds of kinematic boundary conditions at the blade tip: free and modified, by imposing contact with the <b>abradable</b> coating. The interaction data show that the blade vibration modes identified during interactions cor-respond to the free boundary condition, due to the transitional nature of the phenomena and the very short duration of contacts. The properties of the Continous Wavelet Trans-form were then used to identify the occurence of blade-coating contact. Two kinds of blade/abradable-coating interactions were identified: bouncing of the blade over short time periods associated with loss of <b>abradable</b> material, and isolated contacts capable of amplifying the blade vibrations without causing significant wear of the <b>abradable</b> coat-ing.

The platform is instrumented to allow a dynamic measurement of forces and displacements as well as high-speed imaging of the blade/seal interaction zone throughout the experiment. The experiments showed that the blade incursion speed and penetration depth in the <b>abradable</b> seal both affect the amplitude and frequency of blade vibration. The amount and severity of blade incursions into the <b>abradable</b> seal have an impact on seal wear type and intensity, which can in turn increase blade excitation...|$|E

Together with new technologies involving higher casing conicity for improved compression rates, direct contact is now considered as part of aircraft engines normal life. In order to avoid possibly catastrophic scenarios due to high contact efforts between the rotating and static components, implementation of <b>abradable</b> coatings has been widely recognized as a robust solution offering several advantages: reducing potential damage to the incurring blade as well as adjusting operating clearances, in-situ, to accept physical contact events. Nevertheless, the process of wear undergone by <b>abradable</b> coatings is not well understood and its consequences are still under investigation. In the present work, its macroscopic behavior is numerically approximated through a piecewise linear plastic constitutive law which allows for real time access to the current <b>abradable</b> layer profile. First results prove convergence in time and space of the proposed approach and show that the frequency content of the blade response is clearly affected by the presence of <b>abradable</b> coatings. It seems that opening the clearance between the blade tip and the casing during wear leads to large amplitudes of motion far from the usual linear conditions provided by the well-known Campbell diagrams. Animations in the presentation require the DivX codec...|$|E
