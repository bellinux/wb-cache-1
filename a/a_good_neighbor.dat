5|$|A bitter union strike {{began in}} May 1941, which was {{resolved}} without the angered Walt Disney's involvement in July and August of that year. As Walt Disney Productions was {{being set up}} as a union shop, Walt Disney and several studio employees were sent by the US government on <b>a</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Neighbor</b> policy trip to Central and South America. The Disney strike and its aftermath led to an exodus of several animation professionals from the studio, from top-level animators such as Art Babbitt and Bill Tytla to artists better known for their work outside the Disney studio such as Frank Tashlin, Maurice Noble, Walt Kelly, Bill Meléndez, and John Hubley. Hubley, with several other Disney strikers, went on to found the United Productions of America studio, Disney's key animation rival in the 1950s.|$|E

His singing-only credits include commercials for Kentucky Fried Chicken, Pepsi, and Dr Pepper. Manilow won two Clio Awards in 1976 for his work for Tab and Band-Aid.|$|E

He is frequently shown doing volunteer work, and is rigorously honest and upright, even {{going so far as}} to spend an entire day tracking down a Leftorium customer in order to give him the extra change that he had forgotten to hand over. In [...] "Homer's Triple Bypass", he donates a kidney and a lung out of the goodness of his heart to whoever needs them first. He also is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>neighbor</b> to the Simpsons, regularly offering his assistance. Ned’s dogged friendship inspires the loyalty of others; when his Leftorium appeared on the verge of bankruptcy shortly after it opened, Homer arranged a bailout with the help of many people in Springfield.|$|E

50|$|Manuel Ávila Camacho {{was elected}} {{president}} of Mexico in 1940. With the development of World War II, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was more interested in forming a strategic alliance with Mexico to create an anti-fascist front than in protecting private companies. The U.S. government required cooperation to guard its borders and coastlines and to secure the supply of raw materials, including oil. As <b>a</b> result, the <b>Good</b> <b>Neighbor</b> policy was signed on November 17, 1941. The Mexican government agreed to pay $40 million for claims originating from the Mexican Revolution, and the U.S. government opened a line of credit in order to stabilize the Mexican currency. The State Department also resumed purchases of silver from Mexico and investments were made in Mexico’s transportation infrastructure.|$|R

It is for no particular item in the tax bill that I refuse to pay it. I simply wish to refuse allegiance to the State, to withdraw and stand aloof from it effectually. I do not care to trace {{the course of my}} dollar, if I could, till it buys a man or a musket to shoot one with--the dollar is innocent--but I am concerned to trace the effects of my allegiance. In fact, I quietly declare war with the State, after my fashion, though I will still make use and get what advantages of her I can, as is usual in such cases.|$|E

Probably this was merely a device to lengthen out the wick, but it made a memorable spot {{of color in the}} room--just as the watch-spring gong in the clock gave off a sound of fairy music to my ear.

60|$|We {{live in a}} {{very low}} state of the world, and pay unwilling tribute to governments founded on force. There is not, among the most {{religious}} and instructed men of the most religious and civil nations, a reliance on the moral sentiment and a sufficient belief in the unity of things, to persuade them that society can be maintained without artificial restraints, {{as well as the}} solar system; or that the private citizen might be reasonable and <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>neighbor,</b> without the hint of a jail or a confiscation. What is strange too, there never was in any man sufficient faith in the power of rectitude to inspire him with the broad design of renovating the State on the principle of right and love. All those who have pretended this design have been partial reformers, and have admitted in some manner the supremacy of the bad State. I do not call to mind a single human being who has steadily denied the authority of the laws, on the simple ground of his own moral nature. Such designs, full of genius and full of fate as they are, are not entertained except avowedly as air-pictures. If the individual who exhibits them dare to think them practicable, he disgusts scholars and churchmen; and men of talent and women of superior sentiments cannot hide their contempt. Not the less does nature continue to fill the heart of youth with suggestions of this enthusiasm, and there are now men,--if indeed I can speak in the plural number,--more exactly, I will say, I have just been conversing with one man, to whom no weight of adverse experience will make it for a moment appear impossible that thousands of human beings might exercise towards each other the grandest and simplest sentiments, as well as a knot of friends, or a pair of lovers.|$|E

30|$|Note {{that the}} {{numerical}} values in Eq. (6) are not strict choices; rather, the values are depicted through numerous simulation experiments {{for a given}} network environment (stated in Section 6), and they are tunable by the network administrator. In the case the number of already discovered nodes in a certain sector crosses the expected number of neighbors, the node may stop staying in that sector. Hence, it may happen that a node misses <b>a</b> <b>good</b> number of <b>neighbors</b> to discover if the calculation of expected number of neighbors is incorrect (due to distortions in deployment). Therefore, we allow a COND node to continue the discovery process until it fails repeatedly (say, up to two iterations) {{to find a new}} neighbor in a particular sector.|$|R
