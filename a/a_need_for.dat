5|$|In April 1915 the New Zealand and Australian forces, {{except the}} mounted troops, {{were sent to}} serve in the Gallipoli Campaign.

5000|$|McClelland's {{research}} {{showed that}} 86% {{of the population}} are dominant in one, two, or {{all three of these}} three types of motivation. His subsequent research, published in the 1977 Harvard Business Review article [...] "Power is the Great Motivator", found that those in top management positions had <b>a</b> high <b>need</b> <b>for</b> power and <b>a</b> low <b>need</b> <b>for</b> affiliation. His research also found that people with <b>a</b> high <b>need</b> <b>for</b> achievement will do best when given projects where they can succeed through their own efforts. Although individuals with <b>a</b> strong <b>need</b> <b>for</b> achievement can be successful lower-level managers, they are usually weeded out before reaching top management positions. He also found that people with <b>a</b> high <b>need</b> <b>for</b> affiliation may not be good top managers but are generally happier, and can be highly successful in non-leadership roles such as the foreign service.|$|R

5|$|Just {{as there}} is <b>a</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> tax shifting, there is also <b>a</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> subsidy shifting. Subsidies are not an {{inherently}} bad thing as many technologies and industries emerged through government subsidy schemes. The Stern Review explains that of 20 key innovations from the past 30years, {{only one of the}} 14 was funded entirely by the private sector and nine were totally publicly funded. In terms of specific examples, the Internet was the result of publicly funded links among computers in government laboratories and research institutes. And the combination of the federal tax deduction and a robust state tax deduction in California helped to create the modern wind power industry.|$|E

5|$|Although {{ultimate}} power officially rested {{with the}} country's {{government in the}} form of Sovnarkom and the Executive Committee (VTSIK) elected by the All-Russian Congress of Soviets (ARCS), the Communist Party was de facto in control in Russia, as acknowledged by its members at the time. By 1918, Sovnarkom began acting unilaterally, claiming <b>a</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> expediency, with the ARCS and VTSIK becoming increasingly marginalised, so the soviets no longer had a role in governing Russia. During 1918 and 1919, the government expelled Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries from the soviets. Russia had become a one-party state.|$|E
5|$|Balthazar Lange {{designed}} Trondheim Central Station. The originally two-story {{station was}} designed in Renaissance Revival architecture. With {{the opening of}} the Hell–Sunnan Line in 1902, there was <b>a</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> a larger station at Hell. The Blix' station building was therefore moved to Sunnan Station, while a new and larger building, designed by Paul Due, was built at Hell. It received an intermediate style between Dragestil and Jugendstil.|$|E
5|$|Billy Fury, who Storm {{had met at}} the Wyvern Club auditions, later {{played the}} part of a fictional singer called Stormy Tempest (based on Storm), in the film That'll Be the Day (1973), which also starred Starr.

5|$|Following the {{scorched}} earth {{tactics of}} retreating Wehrmacht troops, large areas in Northern Norway {{needed to be}} rebuilt. In 1945, there was <b>an</b> overwhelming <b>need</b> <b>for</b> housing. An architectural competition produced several designs for simple, cost-effective, and rapidly assembled housing. The resulting houses were Spartan and broke with building standards, but met <b>an</b> immediate <b>need</b> <b>for</b> shelter.|$|R

5|$|Bruce became {{frustrated}} with the backstage politics of the wrestling business and began searching for another career. Back on the streets, Bruce, Utsler and Utsler's brother, John performed hip hop music at local night clubs, using the stage names ViolentJ, 2Dope, and John Kickjazz, {{under the name of}} their gang, Inner City Posse. Seeing <b>a</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> a manager, Bruce's brother Robert recommended his friend and record store owner Alex Abbiss, who established the Psychopathic Records record label with the group in 1991.

5|$|Even {{after the}} chariot had become {{obsolete}} {{as a tool}} of war, there still was <b>a</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> technological innovations in pulling technologies; horses were needed to pull heavy loads of supplies and weapons. The invention of the horse collar in China during the 5th century AD (Southern and Northern Dynasties) allowed horses to pull greater weight than they could when hitched to a vehicle with the ox yokes or breast collars used in earlier times. The horse collar arrived in Europe during the 9th century, and became widespread by the 12th century.|$|E
5|$|From 1963 to 1966, RAN {{warships}} {{took part}} in the Indonesian Confrontation. During this period, Australian minesweepers and frigates patrolled Malaysia's coastline to counter Indonesian infiltration parties travelling in small craft. These ships also bombarded Indonesian positions in East Kalimantan near the border with Malaysia on several occasions. The RAN's experiences during this conflict led it to perceive <b>a</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> light destroyers and patrol boats tailored to Confrontation-type tasks.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the motivational needs of middle grade (grade 7 - 8) {{students}} who enroll in Agricultural Education classes in Georgia. McClelland’s motivational needs theory served as the framework for the study. The data determined that agricultural students had <b>a</b> higher <b>need</b> <b>for</b> achievement than for affiliating or power and that no differences existed between FFA members and non FFA members. The study also determined that female agricultural education students had <b>a</b> higher <b>need</b> <b>for</b> affiliation and power than male students. No differences were found in the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> achievement, affiliation or power when students were grouped by grade or geographic location. African-American students had <b>a</b> higher <b>need</b> <b>for</b> achievement and power than students in all other ethnic categories...|$|R
