40|$|When the {{epicuticle}} of a silkworm larva, Bombyx mori, was lightly abraded in {{the presence}} of live Bacillus licheniformis, Enterobacter cloacae, or bacterial cell wall components, cecropin mRNAs were detected in the underlying epithelial cells and in fat body cells remote from the <b>abraded</b> <b>area.</b> Antibacterial activity due to cecropin was detected in the matrix of the lightly abraded cuticle but not in nonabraded portions of the cuticular matrix or in the hemolymph surrounding the fat body, unless a more severe cuticular abrasion was administered. A light abrasion to a larva of the giant silkworm moth, Hyalophora cecropia, {{in the presence}} of E. cloacae also induced antibacterial activity in the abraded cuticle. These data illustrate that the ectodermally derived lepidopteran larval integument, when challenged by live bacteria or their cell wall components, mounts an immune response.

40|$|Abrasive {{mixed in}} {{dentifrice}} usually eliminates coloring substances attached to hard tissue {{at a time}} of brushing and causes the attrition of teeth. This is an in-vitro experiment to figure out that the nano-hydroxyapatite abrasive can whiten the teeth by being attached to demineralized hard tissues combining with organic substances. The eighty natural teeth were prepared to determine the level of abrasiveness in dentin and the level of whiteness in enamel. The level of enamel whiteness was measured through the use of Shadeeye-EX before the experiment. Meanwhile, four kinds of dentifrice slurries including calcium carbonate 40 %, dicalcium phosphate 15 %, sodium metaphosphate 15 % and hydrate silica 12 %+ nano-hydroxyapatite 3 % were manufactured according to the types of abrasive. In addition, the area of the root surface was measured through the use of surface profile in order to figure out the level of abrasiveness of the teeth below a cervical line. After undergoing the machine stroking 20, 000 times, the level of whiteness and abrasiveness again was measured. As for the evaluation of the abrasiveness according to the increase in the <b>abraded</b> <b>area</b> in dentinal root after the experiment, if the control group is presumed to be 100, A group {{has turned out to be}} 6. 37 percent, B group 113 percent and C group 4. 38 percent (p< 0. 01).

40|$|Purpose: The {{aim of this}} {{in vitro}} study was to {{evaluate}} the stripping achieved on different teeth (incisors, canines, and premolars) by two grades of abrasive strips used {{for the first and}} tenth time. Our second aim was to test the efficacy of these strips by calculating the time necessary to perform interproximal reductions of 0. 10, 0. 20, and 0. 30 mm. Methods: Four models were constructed using extracted teeth affixed in wax. The upper and lower arches were set on plaster bases and fixed in wax, carefully creating contact points. All model mouths were treated with artificial saliva (Oral Balance®) in order to simulate the biological conditions in the oral cavity. We then tested specific air-rotor strips of different grades and degrees of wear (15 -μm-grain and 25 -μm-grain Orthofile® strips). Afterwards the teeth from all samples were cut lengthwise in half, and each mesial and distal portion was gold-plated and observed under SEM at incremental magnification (30, 60, and 100 μm). Results: The 25 -μm-grain strip was more effective than the 15 -μm-grain strip, irrespective of the tooth involved. Second, the finishing phase with specific polishing strips after interproximal reduction was fundamental in reducing the number of abrasions and irregularities created by stripping, in particular after using the 25 -μm-grain strip. To achieve the best result, the entire <b>abraded</b> <b>area</b> must be polished. Conclusion: This system permits a rapid and effective stripping procedure in direct proportion to the strip's grain and in inverse proportion to the wear from its use. Further research will enable us to compare this system with similar procedures. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|E
40|$|We {{report for}} the first time the {{existence}} of a structural mechanism of feathers different from iridescence that makes plumage conspicuous. By using electron and light microscopy, we show that the mechanism consists of special lengthened and twisted distal barbules that are very susceptible to damage. The dorsal side of these barbules is translucent, which creates a distinctive sheen colouration to feathers that otherwise would be dark. When distal sheen barbules are broken, the black proximal barbules are exposed, thus generating a conspicuous difference between <b>abraded</b> and non-abraded <b>areas.</b> Total and ultraviolet reflectance of sheen (non-abraded) areas are strikingly higher than in <b>abraded</b> <b>areas.</b> We propose that this mechanism represents a case of convergent evolution in species that are limited in developing colourful plumage patches. Future studies should explore the potential of this colour mechanism to act as a signal of individual quality or identity. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Coarse and fine sand and powder materials (cement, LSP, RHA) were mixed in dry {{conditions for a}} period of 2  min. Next, about 80  % of the water was added, whereupon the concrete mixture was mixed for 2  min. Finally, about 20  % of the water and superplasticizer were added and the concrete mixture was mixed for 4  min. Slump test were conducted to evaluate workability of mixtures according to ASTM C 143. Cylinders of 150  ×  300  mm 2 were cast for determination of compressive and splitting tensile strength. Cylinders of 100  ×  200  mm 2 were cast for determination of chloride penetration resistance. Cube specimens of 70.7  ×  70.7  ×  70.7  mm 3 were cast for determination of abrasion resistance. All specimens were compacted in two layers on a vibrating table. Each layer was vibrated for 20  s. The moulds were covered with polyethylene sheets and moistened for 24  h. After 1  day, the specimens were demoulded, and stored in water at 20  ±  2  °C until testing at 3, 7, and 28  days. Compressive and splitting tensile strength of concrete were determined in agreement with ASTM C 39 and ASTM C 496, respectively. Chloride penetration resistance was determined at 28  days in agreement with ASTM C 1202. The tests were carried out in triplicate and the average values were reported. Abrasion resistance of HPFGC was determined at 28  days following Böhme method (CEN 2003). A dried specimen is held in contact with a cast iron disc with a pressure of 0.6  daN/cm 2.

40|$|An {{ultrasonic}} rock-abrasion tool (URAT) {{was developed}} {{using the same}} principle of ultrasonic/sonic actuation {{as that of the}} tools described in two prior NASA Tech Briefs articles: Ultrasonic/ Sonic Drill/Corers With Integrated Sensors (NPO- 20856), Vol. 25, No. 1 (January 2001), page 38 and Ultrasonic/ Sonic Mechanisms for Drilling and Coring (NPO- 30291), Vol. 27, No. 9 (September 2003), page 65. Hence, like those tools, the URAT offers the same advantages of low power demand, mechanical simplicity, compactness, and ability to function with very small axial loading (very small contact force between tool and rock). Like a tool described in the second of the cited previous articles, a URAT includes (1) a drive mechanism that comprises a piezoelectric ultrasonic actuator, an amplification horn, and a mass that is free to move axially over a limited range and (2) an abrasion tool bit. A URAT tool bit is a disk that has been machined or otherwise formed to have a large number of teeth and an overall shape chosen to impart the desired shape (which could be flat or curved) to the rock surface to be abraded. In operation, the disk and thus the teeth are vibrated in contact with the rock surface. The concentrated stresses at the tips of the impinging teeth repeatedly induce microfractures and thereby abrade the rock. The motion of the tool induces an ultrasonic transport effect that displaces the cuttings from the <b>abraded</b> <b>area.</b> The figure shows a prototype URAT. A piezoelectric-stack/horn actuator is housed in a cylindrical container. The movement of the actuator and bit with respect to the housing is aided by use of mechanical sliders. A set of springs accommodates the motion of the actuator and bit into or out of the housing through an axial range between 5 and 7 mm. The springs impose an approximately constant force of contact between the tool bit and the rock to be abraded. A dust shield surrounds the bit, serving as a barrier to reduce the migration of rock debris to sensitive instrumentation or mechanisms in the vicinity. A bushing at the tool-bit end of the housing reduces the flow of dust into the actuator and retains the bit when no axial load is applied...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} osteoporosis and intervertebral disc degeneration on the endplate cartilage injury in rats. Methods: A total of 48 female Sprague Dawley rats (3 months) were randomly divided into Groups A, B, C and D with 12 rats in each group. Osteoporosis and intervertebral disc degeneration composite model, simple degeneration model and simple osteoporosis model were prepared in Groups A, B and C respectively. After modeling, four rats of each group at 12 th, 18 th and 24 th week were sacrificed. Intervertebral height of cervical vertebra C 6 /C 7 was measured. Micro-CT was used to image the endplate of cephalic and caudal cartilage at C 6 /C 7 intervertebral disc. <b>Abraded</b> <b>area</b> rate of C 6 caudal and C 7 cephalic cartilage endplate was calculated, and then C 6 /C 7 intervertebral disc was routinely embedded and sectioned, stained with safranin 0 to observe histological changes microscopically. Results: At 12, 18 and 24 weeks, intervertebral disc height of C 6 /C 7 were (0. 58 +/- 0. 09) mm, (0. 53 +/- 0. 04) mm and (0. 04 +/- 0. 06) mm in Group A rats, (0. 55 +/- 0. 05) mm, (0. 52 +/- 0. 07) mm and (0. 07 +/- 0. 05) mm in Group B rats. At 24111 week, intervertebral disc height of Group A rats was significantly {{lower than that of}} Group B rats (P 0. 05). At 12 and 18 weeks, the abraded rate of C 6 caudal and C 7 cephalic cartilage endplate in Group A rats were significantly higher than that in Groups B, C and D rats (P 0. 05). Microscopic observation of CT showed that ventral defects in CO caudal or C 7 cephalic cartilage endplate in Groups A and B appeared after 12 weeks of modeling; obvious cracks were found in front of the C 6 and C 7 vertebral body, and cartilage defect shown the trend of "repairing" at 18 and 24 weeks after modeling. Conclusions: Intervertebral disc degeneration and osteoporosis can cause damage to the cartilage endplate. Coexistence of these two factors can induce more serious damage to the endplate, which has possitive correlation with inteivertebral disc degeneration. Osteoporosis plays a certain role in intervertebral disc degeneration process, and accelerates the degeneration of intervertebral disc in a specific time window...|$|E

The aims {{of this study were}} to characterize the abrasive powders of 6 dentifrices (3 toothpastes and 3 toothpowders) and to measure the abrasion on a test surface by Vertical Scanning Interference microscopy (VSI). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Bright field and polarization microscopy were used to identify the abrasive particles on the crude dentifrices and after prolonged washes. Scanning electron microscopy and microanalysis characterized the shape and nature of the particles. Standardized and polished blocks of poly(methylmethacrylate) were brushed with a commercial electric toothbrush with the dentifrices. VSI quantified the mean roughness (Ra) and illustrated in 3 D the <b>abraded</b> <b>areas.</b> RESULTS: Toothpastes induced a limited abrasion. Toothpowders induced a significantly higher roughness linked {{to the size of the}} abrasive particles. One powder (Gencix&# 174; produced a high abrasion when used with a standard testing weight.

New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits were inoculated with cottontail rabbit papillomavirus (CRPV) onto <b>abraded</b> <b>areas</b> of the dorsal skin. At 21 d after viral inoculation, 5. 0 % podofilox solution was applied to some papillomas, whereas others were used as controls. Three rabbits were sacrificed at each of three different periods after treatment initiation (1, 4, and 7 d). Four monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs), RG- 16 (for B cells), L 11 / 135 (specific for T cells), 2 C 4 (specific for class II antigen), and Ki 67 (specific for proliferating cells), were used in an immunohistochemical study. All positive cells and total cells in the field were counted with an ocular grid. After 1 d of treatment, proliferation of papilloma cells was strongly suppressed in treated papillomas, but leukocytic infiltration was not altered. At 4 d and 7 d of treatment, there were substantial increases (about two to three times) {{in the numbers of}} B and T cells and class II – expressing leukocytes. The upper layers of the papillomas were highly necrotic and cell proliferation was absent in an layers. These data support the view that podofilox has a direct toxic effect on papilloma tissue. Leukocyte infiltration is not strongly associated with papilloma tissue and may not contribute to papilloma destruction...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} few decades, the {{expansion}} of anthropogenic activities along coastal areas has produced devastating effects on shallow water systems worldwide. Here, canopy-forming macroalgae, which represent {{one of the most}} valuable marine habitats, have shown a marked reduction in their abundance, being increasingly replaced by stress-tolerant species such as those that compose algal turfs. The loss of native species often occurs concomitantly to the colonization of habitat by introduced macroalgae. Episodes of invasion are reported with increasing frequency and are mainly recorded along urbanised coasts, where human activities may facilitate the spread of invaders. Evidence suggests that invasive macroalgae are often not the primary cause of the loss of native canopy-forming species, but more likely a consequence of the decline of native species in degraded systems. Once established, however, invasive macroalgae may prevent the re-establishment of native assemblages, becoming drivers of further ecological change. The introduction of invasive macroalgae can, thus, alter the structure and functioning of natural ecosystems, with potential repercussions on their ability to provide goods and services to humans. Hence, assessing the impacts of invasive macroalgae on native assemblages has been recognised as a research priority in recent years. The first part of this thesis presents a meta-analysis to provide a quantitative synthesis of the effects of invasive macroalgae on native consumers and primary producers (benthonic or epiphytic). The advantage of a meta-analysis over a review is that of providing a statistically rigorous method to quantitatively compare impacts across disparate studies and, thereby, assess if generalities of impacts exist over and beyond the large variability that characterize ecological experiments. Overall, invasive macroalgae appeared to have moderate to negative effects on consumers and benthic primary producers, whilst no significant effects were observed on epiphytes. Variables that were most affected were fitness and abundance of individual species rather than assemblage attributes. Results were, however, more variable and often weaker when analyses were done on individual species of invasive macroalgae. Although it is possible that different species of invasive macroalgae have different effects on native species, this result might be a consequence of the small number of studies available for each invader. In accordance with previous meta-analyses, our results showed that there are major gaps in the actual knowledge of the effects of invasive macroalgae on native assemblages, highlighting the need of a greater effort into research on biological invasions. Major shortcomings in the current literature {{that need to be addressed}} in future research are (1) the limited number of experimental studies, which are necessary to establish cause-effect relationships, and the lack of proper procedural controls in several of them, (2) a general trend of poor reporting of useful information, such as standard errors, sample sizes or abundance of the invader, (3) the low number of introduced species considered and environmental conditions examined, which can influence species interactions. The second part of the thesis presents an experimental field study aiming to investigate the mechanisms of colonization by the invasive macroalga Caulerpa racemosa and, particularly, whether the presence of native-canopy forming macroalgae can prevent colonization and/or the spread of this invader. Along the coast of Tuscany, C. racemosa is widespread on shallow subtidal rocky reefs, where it is replacing native canopies of Cystoseira spp. It has been observed, however, that Caulerpa has not established under native canopies which dominate pristine locations, such as the Island of Capraia, although Caulerpa is present outside the canopies. These might prevent the establishment of Caulerpa by occupying the primary substratum available for colonization and/or through shading or sweeping the substratum, preventing the settlement and growth of drifting fragments of Caulerpa. According to this model, Caulerpa would be able to grow and spread where canopies are partially or totally removed, but not where these are intact. The size of cleared patches would also likely influence the spread of Caulerpa, as larger patches provide more space available for propagules to settle and a greater un-shaded or <b>abraded</b> <b>area.</b> To test these hypotheses we experimentally manipulated Cystoseira canopies in a three-factorial experimental design. Cystoseira stands were left untouched or disturbed (factor 1), either by partially or totally removing the algae. Each of these treatments, was repeated in small and large plots (factor 2) to test the influence of the patches on the establishment of the invader. Caulerpa (factor 3) was transplanted in half of the plots of each size, while the other half was initially left free from the invader (i. e. if the invader was growing, we did not remove it). Results suggest that the disturbance on Cystoseira canopies causes a shift to assemblages dominated by turf-forming species, but is not, by itself, sufficient to allow the settlement of the invader in a new pristine area. In plots where the invader was not initially present, there were, in fact, no effects of the treatments on Cystoseria on the cover of Caulerpa. Hence, Caulerpa was not able to take over space from native canopies, suggesting that the invader is probably not the primary cause of loss of Cystoseira stands. Once established (i. e. in invaded plots), however, Caulerpa was able to grow where canopies were disturbed, independently of the size of the plot. This suggests that intact canopies might act as a barrier against invasion, preventing the settlement of propagules and/or reducing the expansion of stolons of Caulerpa, while disturbance might favour the transition from canopy- to turf-dominated assemblages, facilitating the spread of invasive species. Even if invasive macroalgae are not the primary cause of the loss of native canopies and degradation of habitat, the consequences of invasions might develop over long time scales and, among them, there are the homogenization of habitats and loss of biodiversity. Moreover, the effects of introduced macroalgae might increase in the future, in combination with other human stressors and climatic changes. Hence, further effort must be put into research for understanding the mechanisms leading to the spread of introduced macroalgae and the consequences for resident assemblages. This must be done taking into account the extreme variability of the effects of different invasive species and of the response of different recipient systems. Thus manipulative experiments must be done under contrasting environmental conditions and in combination with other stressors, which can be important effect-modifiers of the impacts of invasive macroalgae on extant assemblages...|$|E
40|$|Epizootic {{shell disease}} (ESD) is an {{emerging}} form of shell {{disease of the}} American lobster (Homarus americanus) that has had {{detrimental effects on the}} fishery in southern New England. Three bacteria commonly isolated from lesions of wild lobsters with ESD—a novel Aquimarina sp. (A. ‘homaria’ I 32. 4), a novel Rhodobacteraceae species (‘Thalassobius’ sp. I 31. 1) and a Pseudoalteromonas sp. (Pseudoalteromonas ‘gracilis’ ISA 7. 3) —were applied directly to normal and abraded juvenile lobster carapaces, and then monitored for persistence over time and for the development of shell-disease lesions at 3 different temperatures (10 °C, 15 °C, and 20 °C). Without abrasion of the carapace, no lesions developed in the exposures. After abrasion and exposure with a pure culture of A. ‘homaria’ I 32. 4, lesions developed at all 3 temperature and A. ‘homaria’ was detected in the lesions of all animals tested. Surprisingly, ‘Thalassobius’ sp. I 31. 1 also colonized these lesions. A coexposure with all 3 bacteria also demonstrated lesion development and the persistence of A. ‘homaria’ I 32. 4 and ‘Thalassobius’ sp. I 31. 1. The bacterium P. ‘gracilis’ ISA 7. 3 was not able to persist in any of the challenged lesions. <b>Abraded</b> <b>areas</b> of the cuticle with no bacteria added directly were also colonized by A. ‘homaria’ and ‘Thalassobius’ sp., and moderate lesions developed; however, the directly exposed lesions were significantly more severe (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). The bacterium A. ‘homaria’, but not ‘Thalassobius’ sp., was detected in spontaneous lesions that developed independent of any abrasion and/or bacterial exposures. A novel bacterium, ‘Candidatus Kopriimonas aquarianus’ was also detected in spontaneous lesions. This study shows that 2 bacteria isolated from ESD lesions of wild lobsters are able to persist in and act together as important components of lesion development on abraded surfaces of American lobsters. This indicates that they are likely major contributors to lesion development in the ESD polymicrobial infection and may represent significant pathogens of the American lobster...|$|R

40|$|Master of Dental SurgeryThe lack of {{adaptation}} between restorative materials and tooth structure has {{for many years}} been {{a major problem in}} Dentistry. Studies during this time have emphasized that the margins of restorations are not fixed, inert and impenetrable borders, but dynamic microcrevices which contain a busy traffic of ions and molecules (Going, 1972). The microleakage which results, has been defined as “the clinically undetectable passage of bacteria, fluids and molecules or ions between a cavity wall and the restorative materials applied to it” (Kidd, 1976, b). Microleakage has been implicated in a variety of clinical conditions, including recurrent caries, tooth discolouration, hyper-sensitivity, pulp pathology and hastened breakdown of restorative materials (Kidd, 1976, a and b; Torney et al, 1977). Buonocore (1955) was probably the first to bond resins to tooth structure, etched by the application of phosphoric acid to enamel surfaces. It was found that etching the enamel converted a previously hydrophobic, low energy surface to a more wettable high energy state possessing an increased surface area with numerous retentive sites for resin tag formation. Over the years, the acid-etch technique has been used in a number of dental procedures including fissure sealing, the repair of fractured incisal edges, the repair of hypoplastic and <b>abraded</b> <b>areas,</b> the placement of orthodontic brackets and the splinting of teeth. In recent years, studies have evaluated the ability of the acid-etch technique to improve both the adaptation and retention of composite resins to tooth structure and the marginal seal around composite restorations. However, much of the research examining adaptation of composite resins to tooth enamel has been limited {{to the study of the}} enamel tooth surface rather than the enamel of the cavity wall. In addition, previous studies have paid little attention to the effects, on the microleakage, of different etching times and different sizes of the inorganic filler particles and to the influence of aging the restorations on the microleakage. The review of the literature also indicated some controversy concerning the use and effectiveness of low viscosity resins. Since the early 1970 ’s acid-etching of the enamel has been used increasingly in the placement of composite resin restorations, to provide retention and to minimize marginal microleakage. It was the purpose of this investigation to examine the etched enamel cavity wall, to compare the ability of composite resins, of different particle size and viscosity, to adapt to this cavity wall, and to study the influence, in vitro, of these and other factors, on the microleakage occurring at the margins of restoration...|$|R

40|$|In birds, {{colourful}} {{and elaborate}} feathers are important traits in mate choice. Distinct tail white patches {{are present in}} many species of birds, but they remain little studied. Tail markings may indeed have a signal function because in many species males spread the tail offering {{a good view of}} these markings to females during courtship behaviour. Here, we investigated whether white tail spots in male rock sparrow, Petronia petronia, play a role in mate choice. In a free-living population of rock sparrows, we found a reduction in white tail spots size as the breeding season progressed due to abrasion, which was expected if tail spots act as a reliable quality indicator (i. e. a handicap). The same reduction was found under captive conditions, and males in worse condition (individuals that lost more weight) abraded a bigger part of white. This suggests that white tail markings are an indicator of male quality. In captivity, we measured female preference for males differing in white patch size in a mate choice experiment. The experimental reduction {{of the size of the}} males' white spots resulted in a lower sexual interest by females. During courtship display, male rock sparrow shows a yellow breast patch (a carotenoid-based, sexually selected ornament) together with the white spots in the tail. The sizes of these two traits are positively correlated, but only the <b>abraded</b> white <b>area</b> in the tail correlates with a surrogate of individual quality (lost of weight). In conclusion, we can assert that the size of the white spots is preferred by female rock sparrows and it is a part of a multiple signal system...|$|R

In microabrasion technique, abrasive products associated with acids are used, and the evaluation of enamel roughness after this treatment, as well as surface polishing, is necessary. This in-vitro study evaluated the enamel roughness after microabrasion, followed by different polishing techniques. Roughness analyses were performed before microabrasion (L 1), after microabrasion (L 2), and after polishing (L 3). Thus, 60 bovine incisive teeth {{divided into two groups}} were selected (n= 30) : G 1 - 37 % phosphoric acid (37 %) (Dentsply) and pumice; G 2 - hydrochloric acid (6. 6 %) associated with silicon carbide (Opalustre - Ultradent).

Objective: In microabrasion technique, abrasive products associated with acids are used, and the evaluation of enamel roughness after this treatment, as well as surface polishing, is necessary. This in-vitro study evaluated the enamel roughness after microabrasion, followed by different polishing techniques. Settings and Design: Roughness analyses were performed before microabrasion (L 1), after microabrasion (L 2), and after polishing (L 3). Thus, 60 bovine incisive teeth {{divided into two groups}} were selected (n= 30) : G 1 - 37 % phosphoric acid (37 %) (Dentsply) and pumice; G 2 - hydrochloric acid (6. 6 %) associated with silicon carbide (Opalustre - Ultradent). Thereafter, the groups were divided into three sub-groups (n= 10), according to the system of polishing: A - Fine and superfine granulation aluminum oxide discs (SofLex 3 M); B - Diamond Paste (FGM) associated with felt discs (FGM); C - Silicone tips (Enhance - Dentsply). A PROC MIXED procedure was applied after data exploratory analysis, as well as the Tukey-Kramer test (5 %). Results: No statistical differences were found between G 1 and G 2 groups. L 2 differed statistically from L 1 and showed superior amounts of roughness. Differences in the amounts of post-polishing roughness for specific groups (1 A, 2 B, and 1 C) arose, which demonstrated less roughness in L 3 and differed statistically from L 2 in the polishing system. Conclusion: All products increased enamel roughness, and the effectiveness of the polishing systems was dependent upon the abrasive used...|$|R
