40|$|This thesis {{reviews the}} legal, {{political}} and {{technical aspects of}} <b>aeronautical</b> <b>information,</b> with a particular focus on the situation of <b>aeronautical</b> <b>information</b> in Europe. It portrays the evolution of <b>aeronautical</b> <b>information</b> and its current nature. It looks at {{the responsibility for the}} <b>publication</b> of <b>aeronautical</b> <b>information</b> and the evolution of that notion due to recent trends towards corporatisation to the detriment of full State ownership. It also examines the question of liability for the <b>publication</b> of <b>aeronautical</b> <b>information,</b> including the various legal regimes under which victims of defective <b>aeronautical</b> <b>information</b> can claim compensation, as well as the legal mechanisms underlying and implementing such compensation regimes. The final chapter is concerned with electronic <b>aeronautical</b> <b>information</b> and the specific legal challenges this technological revolution has brought about...|$|R
50|$|Each {{country should}} have an {{accessible}} <b>Aeronautical</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Publication</b> (AIP), based on standards defined by ICAO, containing information essential to air navigation. Countries are required to update their AIP manuals every 28 days and so provide definitive regulations, procedures and information for each country about airspace and airports. ICAO's standards also dictate that temporary hazards to aircraft are regularly published using NOTAMs.|$|E

50|$|In aviation, an <b>Aeronautical</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Publication</b> (or AIP) {{is defined}} by the International Civil Aviation Organization as a {{publication}} issued by or with the authority of a state and containing aeronautical information of a lasting character essential to air navigation. It is designed to be a manual containing thorough details of regulations, procedures and other information pertinent to flying aircraft in the particular country to which it relates. It is usually issued by or on behalf of the respective civil aviation administration.|$|E

50|$|The ICAO {{system for}} civil airport {{pavements}} involves comparison of an airportâ€™s pavement classification number (PCN) with an aircraft classification number (ACN). According to this worldwide ICAO standard, aircraft can safely {{operate on a}} pavement if their ACN is {{less than or equal}} to the pavement load bearing capacity or PCN. An aircraft having an ACN equal to or less than the PCN can operate without weight restrictions on a pavement. The PCN is formally published in an <b>Aeronautical</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Publication</b> (AIP).|$|E
50|$|Landing area is an {{official}} designation of specialized Earth surface region {{by the international}} standard publication describing airfields and airports to aviators, the <b>Aeronautical</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Publication.</b> As such, it is directly translated into dozens of languages, wherever an AIP publication exists, which is one for every aviation-regulating country of the world. It is the most salient description of the logistics real estate which enable planes or helicopters or other aircraft to come and go. It also has other meanings, which extend beyond aviation concepts and airport terminology, all of them military in kind.|$|E

50|$|As of June 2012 only runway 18/36 {{remains in}} use, with a sealed surface 1303 m long. The runway has no {{lighting}} and {{is suitable for}} daylight operations only. The <b>Aeronautical</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Publication</b> issued by Airservices Australia on 28 June 2012 shows runway 14/32 has now been decommissioned, but is still used for model aircraft. There is no fuel available at the airport. As there is only occasional traffic and no control tower, pilots use a Common Traffic Advisory Frequency to coordinate arrivals and departures, and must stay within defined airspace constraints andmonitor specific radio frequencies when the Evans Head Air Weapons Range 5 NM km southwest of the airfield is in operation.|$|E
50|$|A major {{redevelopment}} programme {{was undertaken}} by the Council from 1989 to 1993 with grant aid from the European Regional Development Fund. Â£10.5 million was spent upgrading all of the facilities at the airport including runways, taxiways, access roads, navigation equipment and runway lighting, {{as well as a}} new purpose-built terminal and fire station. The new terminal was officially opened in March 1994. The name of the airport was officially changed from Londonderry Eglinton to the City of Derry Airport by Derry City Council following nationalist support within the newly renamed council. However, as of May 2014, the <b>Aeronautical</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Publication</b> published by the UK's air navigation service provider, National Air Traffic Services, still shows Londonderry/Eglinton. At that time there were still only two scheduled routes carrying about 40,000 passenger each year. 1995 saw the arrival of Jersey European Airways who attempted to operate a short-lived shuttle link between Derry and Belfast City Airport.|$|E
