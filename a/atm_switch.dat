40|$|Lookup {{tables are}} used {{extensively}} in communication networks {{in such areas}} as multiplexing, switching, routing and re-assembly. Tables used for <b>ATM</b> <b>switching</b> and multiplexing are of particular importance because of the size and speed they require to support a large cell label and cell transfer at near gigabit speeds. In this paper we present two new lookup table architectures and compare them to conventional techniques for implementing <b>ATM</b> <b>switching</b> tables. 1. INTRODUCTION The chosen technology for integrating communication services is the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) [3]. ATM networks transfer information in 53 octet cells identified by label: a 16 bit Virtual Channel Identifier (VCI) and a Virtual Path Identifier (VPI) of 8 or 12 bits. Switching lookup tables are used within <b>ATM</b> <b>switches</b> to control cell switching and multiplexing. Essentially, lookup tables map input numbers onto output numbers, and those input numbers that have table entries are known as keys. <b>ATM</b> <b>switching</b> t [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{adaptive}} congestion controller for the flow {{regulation of the}} best-effort (ABR) traffic in <b>ATM</b> <b>switching</b> networks. The controller can regulate the source rate based on {{the knowledge of the}} buffer occupancy and the total number of virtual connections accepted through the congested node. Condition for stability in terms of buffer occupancy is derived, and simulations are carried out. It is shown that with this controller applied, the <b>ATM</b> <b>switching</b> node is piecewise asymptotically stable without oscillation. 1 Introduction Congestion control has become an increasingly important problem in designing and managing an <b>ATM</b> <b>switching</b> network due to ever-growing network bandwidth and intensive network applications. It is also believed that congestion control in a high-speed <b>ATM</b> <b>switching</b> network is a much more difficult problem than in a low-speed network due to a high network latency.

40|$|Performance {{analysis}} of <b>ATM</b> <b>switches</b> {{has been an}} active research topic in these recent years. Numerous models have been proposed throughout the world. Most of these models are developed for analyzing specific <b>ATM</b> <b>switches</b> with specific kinds of incoming traffic. The resultant models are usually highly dependent {{on the structure of}} the switches. This restrict the usage of these models to other switches with different structures. In addition most of these models are built with two unrealistic assumptions: the incoming traffic has random destinations {{and the size of the}} switch tends to infinity. In this research an analytical model for the performance {{analysis of}} <b>ATM</b> <b>switches</b> is developed to overcome the above problems. This model can be applied to a large class of <b>ATM</b> <b>switches</b> called the input-output buffering <b>ATM</b> <b>switches.</b> We consider general incoming traffic with asymmetrical output loading and correlated destinations which is most common in ATM networks. Our model is constructed by studying the behavior of the switch, i. e., blocking in the switch fabric and the correlation of incoming traffic. The switch fabric is then modeled as a closed queueing network. By changing the characteristics of this closed queueing network, different types of switches can be studied. This model gives accurate results for the maximum throughput, the cell loss probability and the mean response time under different traffic conditions...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, many high {{performance}} asynchronous transfer mode (<b>ATM)</b> <b>switches</b> have been proposed. The majority of these switches have high performance but also high hardware complexity. Therefore, {{there is a need}} for switch designs with low complexity and high performance. This research proposes three new <b>ATM</b> <b>switches</b> based on the folded hypercube network (FHC). The performance of the three architectures are studied using a network model and simulation. The major performance parameters measured are the cell loss rate and cell delay time through the switch under uniform, normal, and bursty traffic patterns. To guarantee faster switching of time-sensitive cells, the routing algorithm of the three switches uses a priority scheme that gives higher precedence to the time-sensitive cells. Also, an output buffer controller is designed to manage the buffers in a fair manner. The three proposed switch architectures have lower complexity while providing equivalent or better switching performance compared to other more complex <b>ATM</b> <b>switches</b> described in the literature. This research shows a new approach to designing <b>ATM</b> <b>switches</b> by using the FHC as the switching fabric for the first time instead of using the crossbar, multi-path, or Banyan-based switching fabrics...|$|R

Rather than a DLCI, however, interfaces have forwarding tables that specify the outgoing interface, virtual path identifier, and virtual circuit identifier.
