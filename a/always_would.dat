50|$|Markstein added: The {{prisoner}} {{was going}} to leave the Village and he {{was going to}} have adventures in many parts of the world, but ultimately he <b>would</b> <b>always</b> be a prisoner. By that I don't mean he <b>would</b> <b>always</b> go back to the Village. He <b>would</b> <b>always</b> be a prisoner of his circumstances, his situation, his secret, his background... and 'they' <b>would</b> <b>always</b> be there to ensure that his captivity continues.|$|R

50|$|Bunny and Claude {{were always}} chased by a stereotypical Southern sheriff (also voiced by Mel Blanc, {{his voice sounded}} similar to Foghorn Leghorn and Yosemite Sam), whom <b>would</b> <b>always</b> pursuit them in his police cruiser, even though the gangster rabbits <b>would</b> <b>always</b> foil his plans.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all, not at all," [...] Mr. Goudé said hastily. [...] "Mademoiselle <b>would</b> <b>always</b> be dressed. She {{would be}} {{sometimes}} a Roman lady, sometimes a Spanish peasant, a Moorish girl, a Breton, or other maiden.

60|$|Her coming was an inexpressible {{comfort to}} Stephen. After the first {{overwhelming}} burst of grief she {{had settled into}} an acute despair. Of course she had been helped {{by the fact that}} Harold had been with her, and she was grateful for that too. But it did not live in her memory of gratitude in the same way.

60|$|Bailey cast one reproachable {{look at her}} {{and left}} the room with pained dignity. Something seemed to tell him that no good could come to him from a {{prolongation}} of the interview.
