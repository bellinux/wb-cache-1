40|$|This study {{examined}} the differences between children with a low socioeconomic status [socially disadvantaged children (SDC) ] and children without this disadvantage (non-SDC) on physical <b>fitness</b> <b>and</b> academic performance. In addition, this study determined the association between physical <b>fitness</b> <b>and</b> academic performance, and investigated the possible moderator effect of SDC. Data on 544 children were collected and analysed (130 SDC, 414 non-SDC, mean age = 8. 0 +/- 0. 7). Physical fitness was measured with tests for cardiovascular <b>and</b> muscular <b>fitness.</b> Academic performance was evaluated using scores on mathematics, spelling and reading. SDC did not differ on physical fitness, compared with non-SDC, but scored significantly lower on academic performance. In the total group, multilevel analysis showed positive associations between cardiovascular <b>fitness</b> <b>and</b> mathematics (beta = 0. 23), <b>and</b> between cardiovascular <b>fitness</b> <b>and</b> spelling (beta = 0. 16), but not with reading. No associations were found between muscular <b>fitness</b> <b>and</b> academic performance.

40|$|The {{relationships}} between physical <b>fitness,</b> activity, <b>and</b> self-perceived <b>fitness</b> in adolescents in Hong Kong were investigated. Regular physical activity patterns, self-perceptions of <b>fitness,</b> <b>and</b> health-related physical <b>fitness</b> were measured in 201 {{secondary school students}} (M age = 13. 8 yr.). The battery of fitness tests measured cardiovascular capacity, flexibility, muscular strength, muscular endurance, and body fat composition. The boys had a higher self-perception of their own <b>fitness</b> <b>and</b> exercised more outside school than the girls. Participation in physical activity was related to cardiovascular capacity, muscular strength, and body composition. Linear regression analysis indicated that exercise activity and body composition explained a portion of variance in the subjects' self-perceived fitness. These findings highlight the connections between physical activity, <b>fitness,</b> <b>and</b> self-perception of <b>fitness</b> <b>and</b> consequently the need for understanding the concept for better health-promotion strategies.
