5|$|In the Rogue Cut version, Rogue's role is more consequential, and the {{narrative}} is more complex: When seeing Stryker causes Wolverine's consciousness to phase {{between past and}} future—resulting in his claws being extended, injuring Kitty Pryde—the Professor talks {{about the need for}} Wolverine to have more time back in 1973. Bobby Drake (Iceman) proposes breaking into the heavily guarded remains of Cerebro at the Professor's school, the one place where the Professor's mind can't reach others from the outside, in order to rescue Rogue, who is being held captive there. With the Professor and Magneto, he does so—at the cost of his own life—and Rogue is taken to where the mutants <b>are</b> <b>making</b> <b>their</b> last stand, where she takes over for Kitty in regards to keeping Wolverine's mind in 1973, for the remaining time until the moment history is changed, with a suggestion that Wolverine is aware of the switch as he appears to feel Rogue's presence. The Sentinels were able to find the X-Men through a tracking device inside a Sentinel's hand, which got stuck in the X-Jet after the Sentinel tried to prevent the Professor, Magneto and Rogue from escaping the incinerated remains of the X-Mansion. It also includes a scene where Mystique visits the X-Mansion at night while Charles and Logan are sleeping. She revisits her previous romance with Beast but leaves very early the next morning and breaks Cerebro in order to prevent Charles from finding her.|$|E

25|$|Kirkby's shows set a {{standard}} that was upheld for many years by himself and his successors. In one of his shows (in 1915) was Harry Hudson and their association with its mix of songs and humour resulted in a partnership that gained great popularity as a music-hall act in the 1920s. In 1916 The Stage magazine gave the following review of an early concert resulting from their collaboration:Popular newcomers to the bill this week are Stanley Kirkby and Harry Hudson who <b>are</b> <b>making</b> <b>their</b> first appearance in the West End in a double turn. They score one of the hits of the programme with syncopated harmony... Both gentlemen possess fine voices and we thus get ragtime sung artistically and not shouted... Altogether the duo are to be congratulated upon the excellence of their performance.|$|E

500|$|Archer, Lana, Ray, and Cyril are {{subsequently}} {{kidnapped by}} Commander Drake and his aggregation, after {{finding out that}} his main intent was to terraform Mars. Meanwhile, Drake sends some of his crew to search for Pam, Cheryl, and Malory—who are waiting in the Intrepid. In the holding, Lana takes off her suit in order to distract the guard with her breasts. While successfully distracting the guard, he later activates the security breach. After escaping from their holding, the group encounter a group of scientists, who inform them that Drake's men <b>are</b> <b>making</b> <b>their</b> way into the Intrepid to launch towards Mars. As Cheryl allures Drake with her self-proclaimed [...] "Martian queen" [...] persona, Pam takes him hostage, holding a pulse rifle to his head.|$|E
500|$|First, Homer sends bottle rockets at George's window, and George puts up {{a banner}} reading [...] "Two Bad Neighbors", in {{reference}} to Bart and Homer. Homer then glues a rainbow-colored wig on his opponent's head just before {{he is about to}} give an important speech to a local club. George retaliates by destroying the Simpsons' lawn with his car. Homer and Bart <b>are</b> <b>making</b> <b>their</b> way through the sewers to release locusts in George's house when George spots them and climbs down. Homer and George begin fighting, so Bart releases the locusts which attack George. At the same time, former Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev arrives at the mansion to bring a house warming present for the Bush family. Finally, after pressure from his wife, George apologizes to Homer in front of Gorbachev, much to George's dislike. The Bushes eventually move out and sell the house to Gerald Ford, another former President. Ford invites Homer to watch a football game with him, and to enjoy some beer and nachos at his house. The two quickly get off to a good start, sharing common ground.|$|E

500|$|Neville finds a {{promising}} treatment derived {{from his own}} blood, so he sets a snare trap and captures a female Darkseeker from the colony building, while a male Darkseeker (termed [...] "Alpha Male" [...] in the script, and played by Dash Mihok) tries to go after them, but is blocked by the sunlight {{and returns to the}} shadows. Back in his laboratory in the basement of his house, Neville treats the female without success. The next day, he is ensnared in a trap similar to the one he used to capture the female; by the time he manages to escape, the sun is setting and he is attacked by infected dogs. Neville and Sam manage to kill them, but Sam is bitten in the fight. Neville brings Sam home and injects her with a strand of his serum, but when she shows signs of infection and tries to attack him, Neville is forced to strangle her to death. Heartbroken and driven over the edge by loneliness by his dog's death, he ventures out and suicidally attacks a group of Darkseekers the next night. He kills a large number of Darkseekers but the rest overwhelm him and he is nearly killed, but is rescued by a pair of immune survivors, Anna (Alice Braga) and a young boy named Ethan (Charlie Tahan), who have traveled from Maryland after hearing one of his broadcasts. They take the injured Neville back to his home, where Anna explains that they survived the outbreak aboard a Red Cross evacuation ship from São Paulo and <b>are</b> <b>making</b> <b>their</b> way to a survivors' camp in Bethel, Vermont. Neville angrily argues that no such survivors' camp exists.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{influence}} on bicycle culture from Copenhagen is the [...] Cycle chic movement. It grew from reactions to {{a photo of}} a girl wearing her regular clothes on a bike, which inspired the photographer, Michael Colville-Andersen, to start the blog Copenhagen Cycle Chic featuring mainly female subjects riding their bikes in fashionable everyday clothes. Its popularity have spawned a global movement with over 100 Cycle Chic blogs featuring similarly themed photography from other cities and areas around the world. Bloggers around the world are trying very hard to get featured on the Cycle Chic blog because they think it's cool. So now many people <b>are</b> <b>making</b> <b>their</b> own blogs that feature cyclists around the world. Most of them are associated with the original blog, the Copenhagen Cycle Chic.|$|E

Scaramouche figures out that the bright shining star of the prophecy is rock star Freddie Mercury's statue, and that it's pointing to Wembley Stadium, the [...] "place of living rock". After initially preparing to travel by bicycle, (opening of [...] "Bicycle Race") Scaramouche protests that the method [...] "isn't very cool", and so they travel there by motorcycle.

2500|$|Most Broadway {{shows are}} {{commercial}} productions {{intended to make}} a profit for the producers and investors ("backers" [...] or [...] "angels"), and therefore have open-ended runs (duration that the production plays), meaning that the length of their presentation is not set beforehand, but depends on critical response, word of mouth, and the effectiveness of the show's advertising, all of which determine ticket sales. Investing in a commercial production carries a varied degree of financial risk. Shows do not necessarily have {{to make a profit}} immediately. If they <b>are</b> <b>making</b> <b>their</b> [...] "nut" [...] (weekly operating expenses), or are losing money at a rate which the producers consider acceptable, they may continue to run in the expectation that, eventually, they will pay back their initial costs and become profitable. In some borderline situations, producers may ask that royalties be temporarily reduced or waived, or even that performers—with the permission of their unions—take reduced salaries, in order to prevent a show from closing. Theatre owners, who are not generally profit participants in most productions, may waive or reduce rents, or even lend a show money in order to keep it running.|$|E

He said that Alfie is a one-woman man and if Alfie had cheated on Kat, [...] "it {{would be the end of}} his world [...] He does genuinely believe in marriage." [...] Asked if Alfie could forgive Kat, Richie said that although Alfie has always done so in the past, [...] "it's different [...] so we'll have to wait and see." [...] He stated that Kat's affair might be because she loves adventure and Alfie is more [...] "set in his ways".
