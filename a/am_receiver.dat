2500|$|As {{the name}} implies, {{wideband}} FM (WFM) requires a wider signal bandwidth than amplitude modulation by an equivalent modulating signal; this {{also makes the}} signal more robust against noise and interference. Frequency modulation is also more robust against signal-amplitude-fading phenomena. As a result, FM {{was chosen as the}} modulation standard for high frequency, high fidelity radio transmission, hence the term [...] "FM radio" [...] (although for many years the BBC called it [...] "VHF radio" [...] because commercial FM broadcasting uses part of the VHF band—the FM broadcast band). FM receivers employ a special detector for FM signals and exhibit a phenomenon known as the capture effect, in which the tuner [...] "captures" [...] the stronger of two stations on the same frequency while rejecting the other (compare this with a similar situation on an <b>AM</b> <b>receiver,</b> where both stations can be heard simultaneously). However, frequency drift or a lack of selectivity may cause one station to be overtaken by another on an adjacent channel. Frequency drift was a problem in early (or inexpensive) receivers; inadequate selectivity may affect any tuner.|$|E
2500|$|However it is {{possible}} to talk about a modulation index exceeding 100%, without introducing distortion, in the case of double-sideband reduced-carrier transmission. In that case, negative excursions beyond zero entail a reversal of the carrier phase, as shown in the third waveform below. This cannot be produced using the efficient high-level (output stage) modulation techniques (see below) which are widely used especially in high power broadcast transmitters. Rather, a special modulator produces such a waveform at a low level followed by a linear amplifier. What's more, a standard <b>AM</b> <b>receiver</b> using an envelope detector is incapable of properly demodulating such a signal. Rather, synchronous detection is required. Thus double-sideband transmission is generally not referred to as [...] "AM" [...] even though it generates an identical RF waveform as standard AM as long as the modulation index is below 100%. Such systems more often attempt a radical reduction of the carrier level compared to the sidebands (where the useful information is present) to the point of double-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission where the carrier is (ideally) reduced to zero. In all such cases the term [...] "modulation index" [...] loses its value as it refers to the ratio of the modulation amplitude to a rather small (or zero) remaining carrier amplitude.|$|E

5000|$|The signal {{strength}} (amplitude) {{of the radio}} signal from a receiver's antenna varies drastically, by orders of magnitude, depending on how far away the radio transmitter is, how powerful it is, and propagation conditions along {{the path of the}} radio waves. [...] The strength of the signal received from a given transmitter varies with time due to changing propagation conditions of the path through which the radio wave passes, such as multipath interference; this is called fading. [...] In an <b>AM</b> <b>receiver</b> the amplitude of the audio signal from the detector, and the sound volume, is proportional to the amplitude of the radio signal, so fading causes variations in the volume. In addition as the receiver is tuned between strong and weak stations, the volume of the sound from the speaker would vary drastically. Without an automatic system to handle it, in an <b>AM</b> <b>receiver</b> constant adjustment of the volume control would be required.|$|E

50|$|In FM {{demodulation}} {{the receiver}} tracks the modulated frequency {{shift of the}} desired carrier while discriminating against any other signal since it can only follow the deviation of one signal at a time. In AM, the receiver tracks the signal strength of the AM signal {{as the basis for}} demodulation. This allows any other signal to be tracked as just another change in amplitude. So it is possible for an <b>AM</b> <b>receiver</b> to demodulate several carriers at the same time, resulting in an audio mix.|$|E
