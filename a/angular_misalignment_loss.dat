40|$|Abstract — Shaft {{misalignment}} in {{rotating machinery}} {{is one of}} the major industrial concerns. When the power supply to any rotating system is cut-off, the system begins to lose the momentum gained during sustained operation and finally comes to rest. The exact time period between the power cut-off time and the time at which the rotor stops is called Coast Down Time. In this paper an experimental study was conducted to investigate the effect of <b>angular</b> <b>misalignment</b> in forward curved centrifugal blower test setup. Tests were conducted for various level of <b>angular</b> <b>misalignment</b> at different shaft cut-off speeds. The results show that the coast down time decreases with increase in level of <b>angular</b> <b>misalignment.</b> At higher speed and at higher level of <b>angular</b> <b>misalignment,</b> the impact on percentage reduction in CDT is very high and there is a specific correlation between the percentage reduction, cut-off speeds and the level of introduced <b>angular</b> <b>misalignment.</b> The vibration signatures acquired at different cut-off speeds and at the various level of <b>angular</b> <b>misalignment</b> conditions. The 2 X and 3 X vibration amplitude components are predominant frequencies and increase as the <b>angular</b> <b>misalignment</b> and shaft rotational speed increases, thereby establishing the fact that the CDT analysis can be used as one of the diagnostic condition monitoring parameter for rotating machinery...|$|R

40|$|A brief {{description}} of enhancements made to the NASA MSFC coherent lidar model is provided. Notable improvements are the addition of routines to automatically determine the 3 dB <b>misalignment</b> <b>loss</b> angle and the backscatter value at which {{the probability of a}} good estimate (for a maximum likelihood estimator) falls to 50 %. The ability to automatically generate energy/aperture parametrization (EAP) plots which include the effects of <b>angular</b> <b>misalignment</b> has been added. These EAP plots make it very easy to see that for any practical system where there is some degree of misalignment then there is an optimum telescope diameter for which the laser pulse energy required to achieve a particular sensitivity is minimized. Increasing the telescope diameter above this will result in a reduction of sensitivity. These parameterizations also clearly show that the alignment tolerances at shorter wavelengths are much stricter than those at longer wavelengths.

40|$|Fractional pitch slot / pole {{arrangements}} {{are commonly used}} in permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs) to significantly reduce cogging torque, however, maximum benefit depends on accurate stator and rotor manufacturing and alignment. This thesis presents a method of identifying the sources of manufacturing induced cogging torque. Decoupling of cogging caused by stator and rotor manufacturing variation is possible due to stator and rotor affected harmonics being independent of one another. A hybrid FEA / analytical method was developed to simulate cogging torque with multiple manufacturing faults induced which proved to be 6 orders of magnitude faster than FEA alone. The new method utilises a library of FEA derived pole transition over single stator slot waveforms which are then assembled in the correct order and phased corresponding to the slot / pole interactions for a given PMSM. <b>Angular</b> and eccentric <b>misalignment</b> can be identified by investigating the presence of first and second order sidebands about the pole and slot harmonics. Static <b>angular</b> <b>misalignment</b> induces first order sidebands around the slot harmonics while dynamic <b>angular</b> <b>misalignment</b> induces sidebands about the pole harmonics. Static eccentricity induces both first and second order sidebands around the slot harmonics, while dynamic eccentricity has {{the same effect on}} the pole harmonics. A ‘Fault Diagnosis Flow Chart’ is presented to identify the manufacturing sources of additional harmonics. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, all combinations of 10 production stators and 10 rotors of 24 slots and 10 poles in an axial flux configuration were experimentally measured and analysed. The stator slot variation and pole misplacement were found to be the largest contributors to unexpected cogging torque.
