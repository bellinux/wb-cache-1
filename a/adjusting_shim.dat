50|$|The dual {{overhead}} camshafts {{are driven}} by a single-stage roller chain of 8.0 mm (0.3-in) pitch, enabling a narrow included valve angle of 27.5°. The camshafts act on four valves per cylinder via bucket tappets. As in the recent Toyota engine practice, no clearance <b>adjusting</b> <b>shim</b> is employed. Valve diameters are 34.0 mm (1.3 in) for intake and 29.5 mm (1.2 in) for exhaust, with 8.0 mm (0.3-in) lift for both intake and exhaust. The four-vane VVT-i device is fitted on the intake camshaft, altering timing by 50°. The valve cover is made of magnesium to save weight.|$|E
2500|$|However, before long, XK sales {{suffered}} from {{complaints about the}} durability on rough outback roads (due chiefly to collapsing front ball joints, and <b>adjusting</b> <b>shims</b> {{dropping out of the}} front suspension, both problems inducing some rather severe front camber); the car earned the unflattering nicknames [...] "Foul Can" [...] or [...] "Fault Can" [...] during this time.|$|R
5000|$|The 2L-T II is {{an upgrade}} of the 2L-T. Of the same {{dimensions}} as all other 2L engines, {{the most significant}} change is that the camshaft lifts the valve directly via tappet instead of a rocker arm. The valve clearance is <b>adjusted</b> using <b>shims.</b> Compression rate is also 20:1. Output is [...] at 4000 rpm, 22.0 kgm Nm at 2400 rpm ...|$|R
5000|$|The 2L-II is {{an upgrade}} of the 2L. Bore and stroke remains the same. The most {{significant}} change {{is that the}} camshaft lifts the valve directly via tappet instead of a rocker arm. The valve clearance is <b>adjusted</b> using <b>shims.</b> Later L engines (3L and 5L) also use this method of valve operation. Maximum output is [...] gross at 4,200 rpm and maximum torque is 149 N·m net or 167 Nm gross at 2,400 rpm.|$|R
5000|$|The screw {{mechanism}} for changing hair tension is first mentioned in a French shop inventory of 1747. It was not universally accepted {{for over a}} decade as players were perfectly happy with [...] "clip-in" [...] models: a removable frog held in place by hair tension in a mortise carved into the stick, its tension <b>adjusted</b> by <b>shims</b> between hair and frog surface. However, baroque-style bows produced today almost universally adopt the {{screw mechanism}}.|$|R
5000|$|The FZ750 uses an all-aluminium, liquid-cooled, transverse-mounted, four-{{cylinder}} engine. The complex {{cylinder head}} is constructed in two halves, with dual chain-driven overhead camshafts operating 20 valves, 3 inlet and 2 exhaust per cylinder. Valve clearances are <b>adjusted</b> with under-lifter <b>shims.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The pistons {{are made}} from an {{aluminium}} alloy, designed to withstand high temperatures. An indentation is incorporated into the piston head to prevent the pistons from hitting the valves, should the timing belt break (this is not true of the later BEAMS - an acronym which stands for Breakthrough Engine with Advanced Mechanism System - motors). This is {{commonly referred to as}} a [...] "non-interference" [...] engine. Piston pins holding the pistons in place are locked by snap rings. The [...] "Outer Shim Type System" [...] allows for the replacement of the shims without the need to remove the camshaft. To adjust the valve clearance, <b>adjust</b> the <b>shims</b> above the valve lifters.|$|R
50|$|The FJ1200 uses a four {{cylinder}} in-line {{layout and}} is air-cooled. Sixteen valves are {{operated by a}} chain-driven double overhead camshaft; valve clearances are <b>adjusted</b> using <b>shims.</b> The four constant-velocity carburettors are mounted in a bank behind the cylinders and feed each cylinder through short intake manifolds. Four exhaust downpipes join a box below the engine where the gases are split to exit through two silencers (mufflers). The crankshaft is geared directly to the clutch, no counter balancer shaft is used. Starting is by electric starter only. Lubrication is wet sump using a trochoid pump; an oil radiator assists with cooling. Both the FJ1100 and FJ1200 were fitted with an additional fuel vapour recovery system to comply with California emission regulations.|$|R
50|$|Diemaco's C7/C8 {{family is}} {{completed}} with two designated marksman variants, the C7CT and C8CT, with CT meaning Custom Tactical. These accurized C7/C8 variants {{are designed to}} provide accurate engagement up to 600 m, while providing system commonality to other fielded weapons. They have two-stage match triggers and weighted stocks to counterbalance the heavy 508 mm or 16 in free-floating barrel surrounded by a tubular forestock. A removable bipod, rails for designators, sling, etc. attach to that forestock. A special, distinctive pistol grip is fitted and the C7-style buttstock can be <b>adjusted</b> with <b>shims.</b> Sound suppressors are usually fitted. The rifle is designed as a sniper spotter weapon or a police containment weapon. The CT series weapons meet or exceed all applicable military standards including: reliability in all environmental and operational conditions, accuracy, lethality, maintainability in field conditions and safety.|$|R
5000|$|The '91 GSX-R750M gained 15 kg {{over the}} {{previous}} model. The most notable feature of the [...] "M" [...] are the faired in headlamps and a slanted nose, {{both of which were}} designed to reduce drag. Also fitted was a new larger seat and new rear body work that featured twin tail lamps. This was the last GSX-R to use the oil-cooled SACS engine (except for US). Internal engine changes included a new valvetrain that used one dedicated cam lobe and rocker arm (finger follower) per valve (previous models used one lobe and one forked rocker per two valves). Valve clearance (lash) was now <b>adjusted</b> with <b>shims</b> (previous models used a screw and nut). The cam duration and indexing changed slightly as well as the porting according to a magazine article. The rear tyre width was increased to a 170 mm section width. The gauges also changed to white coloured needles (previously amber coloured).|$|R
40|$|An awkward {{interface}} {{exists between}} the structure and skin of complex architecture.  The primary structure is typically allowed much higher tolerance ranges {{than that of the}} cladding industry, due primarily to the delicate nature of the building envelope which, above all, must prevent water penetration and meet the aesthetic requirements of the architect and client. As architecture has integrated advanced design and fabrication techniques to realize increasingly complex shapes, this problem has been aggravated because of the tangency requirements for high gloss curved finish surfaces and the larger variations found with rolled steel columns and undulating concrete forms. To date, most innovations in this area have been focused upon mechanical connections that can be <b>adjusted</b> and <b>shimmed,</b> thus requiring increased design engineering and on-site labor costs for effective implementation. It would be preferable to manufacture cladding components that are properly adjusted to the actual site conditions, negating the need to predict and accommodate potential dimensional variation with complex connections.  The research provides a model for implementing long distance laser scanning technology to facilitate a real-time parametric BIM, herein called an Isomodel. ...|$|R
40|$|NMR magnets need to {{have better}} than 10 − 8 {{homogeneity}} over a 10 x 10 x 20 mm 3 space which is obtained by optimally tuning a set of Shim coils. These shim coil currents are adjusted manually by an operator to achieve a homoge-neous magnetic field. Visualizing magnetic field will assist operator in optimal shimming. A novel method to visualize NMR Magnetic field is presented. The prob-lem poses challenges that are different from computationally intensive general magnetic field computation and visualization. A GPU (Graphics processing Unit) based technique is developed for efficient interactive visualization. This approach exploits the inherent parallelism in the GPUs thus relinquishing CPU {{from most of the}} heavy computation. The field equations are transformed into a set of multi-pass GPU shader programs that encapsulates Shim coil current inputs and coil geometry. A geometric deformation based visualization tech-nique is developed to identify dominant inhomogeneity present in the field to be corrected by <b>adjusting</b> a particular <b>shim</b> current.
