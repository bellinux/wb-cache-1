2500|$|In humans, {{there is}} good {{evidence}} that the basic human neural architecture underpinning the potential for flexible aggressive responses is influenced by genes as well as environment. In terms of variation between individual people, more than 100 twin and adoption {{studies have been conducted}} in recent decades examining the genetic basis of aggressive behavior and related constructs such as conduct disorders. According to a meta-analysis published in 2002, approximately 40% of variation between individuals is explained by differences in genes, and 60% by differences in environment (mainly non-shared environmental influences rather than those that would be shared by being raised together). However, such studies have depended on self-report or observation by others including parents, which complicates interpretation of the results. The few laboratory-based analyses have not found significant amounts of individual variation in aggression explicable by genetic variation in the human population. Furthermore, linkage and association studies that seek to identify specific genes, for example that influence neurotransmitter or hormone levels, have generally resulted in contradictory findings characterized by failed attempts at replication. One possible factor is an allele (variant) of the MAO-A gene which, in interaction with certain life events such as childhood maltreatment (which may show <b>a</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> on its own), can influence development of brain regions such as the amygdala and as a result some types of behavioral response may be more likely. [...] The generally unclear picture has been compared to equally difficult findings obtained in regard to other complex behavioral phenotypes. For example, both 7R and 5R, ADHD-linked VNTR alleles of dopamine receptor D4 gene are directly associated with the incidence of proactive aggression in the men with no history of ADHD.|$|E
50|$|Relative to a {{factorial}} design, {{under an}} analysis of variance, <b>a</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> test will test the hypotheses expected such as H0, the null hypothesis. Running a hypothesis for <b>a</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> will test whether {{there is evidence of}} an effect of different treatments. However <b>a</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> test is nonspecific and will not allow for a localization of specific mean pairwise comparisons (simple effects). <b>A</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> test will merely look at whether overall there is something about a particular factor that is making a difference. In other words a test examining differences amongst the levels of a single factor (averaging over the other factor and/or factors). Main effects are essentially the overall effect of a factor.|$|E
50|$|If we were {{examining}} {{the effect of}} two variables, gender and premature birth, on health outcomes, we would describe any difference in health outcome scores between genders as <b>a</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect.</b> Similarly any difference in scores of full term/premature birth would be described as <b>a</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect.</b> The presence of an interaction effect implies {{that the effect of}} gender on health outcome varies as a function of premature birth status.|$|E

In testing for ethnic differences, we compared undergraduates who identified with at least one underrepresented ethnic group (i.e., African American, American Indian; Latina/o) with undergraduates who solely identified as members of overrepresented ethnic groups (i.e., Asian American; European American). <b>A</b> <b>main</b> <b>effects</b> analysis of variance showed that scientist identity did not significantly differ on the basis of undergraduates’ ethnicity (p[*]=[*]. 80) or gender (p[*]=[*]. 64).

5000|$|Carrasco, Evert, Chang and Katz’s 1995 {{research}} {{also included a}} free-viewing, fixed-viewing and fast-fixed-viewing condition. Free-viewing means that display was present until observers responded; fixed-viewing means that display was only present for 104msec, and finally fast-fixed means that the display was only present for 64msec. They found <b>a</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> for display duration that performance is slower for the free-viewing than fixed-viewing conditions, but that accuracy decreased more in the fast-fixed than fixed viewing condition, while fixed-viewing was marginally less accurate than free-viewing.

50|$|A {{flying fish}} fuse (bumblebee) {{is an unusual}} type of {{component}} for fireworks. It is made like Visco fuse, but contains a metallic spark composition or other effect instead of black powder. Flying fish can thus perform as <b>a</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> instead of just an initiator. For example, simply lighting a short piece of flying fish on the ground makes it fly through the air, seeming to swim in random directions, while emitting sparks and noise. An aerial shell loaded with many such pieces results in a beautiful myriad of pieces flying and sparking high in the air.|$|E
50|$|The {{differential}} susceptibility hypothesis {{proposes that}} in positive environments vulnerable children may outperform their peers who {{turn out to}} be less susceptible not only to bad environments but also to optimal environments. Moreover, the same characteristics that make individuals vulnerable to adversity also make them disproportionately likely to benefit from contextual support. What characteristics render individuals susceptible to environmental influences? Three broad constructs have been proposed and tested as markers of susceptibility: (a) reactive temperament, (b) biological sensitivity to stress, and (c) genetic make-up. The idea of genetic susceptibility was coined by the Leiden team. Importantly, the efficacy of interventions might be underestimated or even go undetected as <b>a</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> when it is hidden in interactions with (genetic, biological or temperamental) characteristics of the recipient of the intervention.|$|E
50|$|Further {{research}} investigating perceptual fluency {{has found}} a gender bias towards neutral stimuli. Studies pertaining to generalizing symmetry preference to real-world versus abstract objects allow us to further examine the possible influence meaning may have on preference for a given stimuli. In order to determine whether meaning mattered for a given stimuli, {{participants were asked to}} view pairs of objects and make a forced-choice decision, evaluating their preference. The findings suggest that an overall preference for symmetric features of visual objects existed. Furthermore, <b>a</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> for gender preference existed in the males that consistently indicated a preference for symmetry in both abstract and real objects. This finding did not transcend in the female participants. Further studies need to be conducted to investigate the factors that influence female preferences for visual stimuli as well as for why males showed a preference for symmetry in both abstract and real world objects.|$|E

5000|$|The {{effects of}} {{independent}} variables in factorial studies, taken singly, {{are referred to}} as main effects. This refers to the overall effect of an independent variable, averaging across all levels of the other independent variables. <b>A</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> is the only effect detectable in a one-way design. [...] Often more important than main effects are [...] "interactions", which occur when the effect of one independent variable on a dependent variable depends on the level of a second independent variable. For example, the ability to catch a ball (dependent variable) might depend on the interaction of visual acuity (independent variable #1) {{and the size of the}} ball being caught (independent variable #2). A person with good eyesight might catch a small ball most easily, and person with very poor eyesight might do better with a large ball, so the two variables can be said to interact.|$|E
5000|$|The special {{protection}} {{these articles}} provide has as <b>a</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> the broadening of the domicile of the 'stronger' party, {{so that the}} 'weaker' party, be it the consumer, employer or insured individual, has an increased range of locations for suing the first, {{while at the same}} time not allowing this broadened sense of domicile the other way around. For example, Article 16 of the Regulation defines that a consumer may bring proceedings against the other party in both the Member State in which that party is domiciled as the Member State in which the consumer is domiciled, {{while at the same time}} providing that proceedings against a consumer may only be brought in the courts in the Member State in which the consumer is domiciled. Furthermore, when a 'stronger' party has no domicile in any Member State, but merely a [...] "branch, agency or other establishment" [...] in one of the Member States, it will be [...] "deemed to be domiciled in that Member State". Lastly, an additional safeguard is installed by providing further mandatory rules governing an agreement that would deviate from the previously mentioned rules.|$|E
5000|$|Glucksberg (1962) used a 2 × 2 design {{manipulating}} {{whether the}} tacks and matches were {{inside or outside}} of their boxes and whether subjects were offered cash prizes for completing the task quickly. Subjects who were offered no prize, termed low-drive, were told [...] "We are doing pilot work on various problems in order to decide {{which will be the}} best ones to use in an experiment we plan to do later. We would like to obtain norms on the time needed to solve." [...] The remaining subjects, termed high-drive, were told [...] "Depending on how quickly you solve the problem you can win $5.00 or $20.00. The top 25% of the Ss subjects in your group will win $5.00 each; the best will receive $20.00. Time to solve will be the criterion used." [...] (As a note, adjusting for inflation since 1962, the study's publish year, the amounts in 2015's dollars would be approximately $ and $, respectively.) The empty-boxes condition was found to be easier than the filled-boxes condition: more subjects solved the problem, and those who did solve the problem solved it faster. Within the filled-boxes condition, high-drive subjects performed worse than low-drive subjects. Glucksberg interpreted this result in terms of [...] "neobehavioristic drive theory": [...] "high drive prolongs extinction of the dominant habit and thus retards the correct habit from gaining ascendancy". An explanation in terms of the overjustification effect is made difficult by the lack of <b>a</b> <b>main</b> <b>effect</b> for drive and by a nonsignificant trend in the opposite direction within the empty-boxes condition.|$|E
