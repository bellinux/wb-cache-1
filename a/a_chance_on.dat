5|$|Eureka was {{published}} in a small hardcover edition in March 1848 by Wiley & Putnam priced at 75 cents. Poe persuaded George Palmer Putnam, who had previously taken <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>on</b> Poe by printing his only novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket in England, to publish Eureka after claiming this work {{was more important than}} Isaac Newton's discovery of gravity. Putnam paid Poe fourteen dollars for the work. Poe suggested an initial printing of at least one million copies; Putnam settled on 750, of which 500 were sold that year. Other accounts say that Poe requested 50,000 copies, and 500 were printed. Poe was given in advance the full payment of $14 from the publisher.|$|E
5|$|Kerry Conran {{grew up on}} {{films and}} comic books of the 1930s and 1940s. He and his brother, Kevin, were {{encouraged}} by their parents to develop their creative side at a young age. Kerry studied at a feeder program for Disney animators at CalArts, and became interested in 2-D computer animation. While there, he {{realized that it was}} possible to apply some of the techniques associated with animation to live-action. Conran had been out of film school for two years and was trying to figure out how to make a movie. He figured that Hollywood would never take <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>on</b> an inexperienced, first-time filmmaker, so he decided to make the movie himself.|$|E
5|$|Built by {{construction}} firm Turner Construction Company, the US$165 million Murano {{was completed}} in 2008 with residents first moving in on June 18. The building was completed with seventy percent of its units sold. As of December 31, 2008, sales on 111 units had been closed and an additional 14 units were under contract of sale. In 2008 and 2009 the late-2000s recession hurt the condominium market, with citywide sales declining 64 percent and high-end condo sales declining 24 percent. Analysts believed the Murano was overpriced based on the neighborhood, with potential buyers unwilling to take <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>on</b> the developing West Market Street neighborhood during a recession. In 2009, Thomas Properties Group was looking to quickly fill up the tower {{to help pay for}} condo fees and maintenance costs. On June 27, Thomas Properties Group auctioned off 40 units in the tower. The 40 units went for between US$335,000 and US$796,000, priced at nearly 20 percent less than the units sold before the auction. Thomas Properties Group priced the 137 remaining unsold units according to what similar units went for during the auction.|$|E

5|$|Chelsea's goalscoring chance came in {{the fifth}} minute when Poyet found Di Matteo, who fumbled his {{opportunity}} as it went over the goal. Stuttgart almost took the lead through Bobic, who took advantage of Steve Clarke's poor clearance but Bobic's attempt went just past the right goalpost. The Germans continued to push forward, as Balakov had <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>on</b> goal, after being found by Poschner, but his shot was kept out by Ed de Goey to mark the first save of the match. Chelsea held on however; a few minutes later, Poyet ran towards the ball to direct a powerful volley on goal following a weak clearing header from Berthold, but a well-placed Franz Wohlfahrt dived to read the attempt. Chelsea had another chance before half time, which saw Wise from a Di Matteo free kick launch another volley, with the successive effort going just off the target.|$|E

Australian captain Mark Taylor was not a fan of this change as many fans supported Australia A rather than the national team. Despite the negative feedback it gave Ponting <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>on</b> the international stage. Playing for Australia A, he scored 161 runs at 26.83 with one half-century.|$|E

25|$|In August 2003, it was {{reported}} that the film was set to start shooting in January, with Smith still at the helm. Though Smith insisted on casting Lee in the lead role, Miramax head Harvey Weinstein refused to take <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>on</b> Lee, citing the general inability of his films to gross more than $30million at the box office. The role of Fletch remained uncast, with Smith considering a list of actors including Affleck, Brad Pitt, Will Smith, and Jimmy Fallon. Though Smith considered compromising and casting Zach Braff in the role, he eventually left the project in October 2005.|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} closely contested by {{throughout}} the night as the lead changed 12 separate times, and the game was tied on 18 occasions. Regulation {{was not enough to}} settle this game, so the game went into overtime. The Pistons streaked out to a quick lead in the first few minutes of overtime, and seemed to have the game in hand. However, a missed layup by Chauncey Billups with Detroit ahead 95-93 with nine seconds left San Antonio with <b>a</b> <b>chance.</b> <b>On</b> the Spurs' next possession, Robert Horry inbounded the ball to Ginobili, who headed for the left corner and dished it right back to Horry. Rasheed Wallace had left Horry to double-team Ginobili, and Horry was left alone to sink the game-winning basket with 5.8 seconds remaining in the OT. Horry was already famous for nailing last-second shots in the playoffs, including Game Four of the 2002 Western Conference Finals between the Lakers and Sacramento Kings.|$|E
25|$|After {{graduating from}} Yonkers High School in 1939, Caesar left home, intent on a musical career. He arrived in Manhattan {{and worked as}} an usher and then a doorman at the Capitol Theater there. He was ineligible to join the musicians' union in New York City until he {{established}} residency, but he found work as a saxophonist at the Vacationland Hotel, a resort located in the Catskill Mountains of Sullivan County, New York. Mentored by Don Appel, the resort's social director, Caesar played in the dance band and learned to perform comedy, doing three shows a week. He audited classes in clarinet and saxophone at the Juilliard School of Music. In 1939, he enlisted in the United States Coast Guard, and was stationed in Brooklyn, New York, where he played in military revues and shows. Vernon Duke, the composer of Autumn in New York, April in Paris, and Taking <b>a</b> <b>Chance</b> <b>on</b> Love, was at the same base and collaborated with Caesar on musical revues.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} artists achieved {{three or}} more number-one hits during the 1970s. Swedish group, ABBA, were the most successful artist of the decade in terms of number-one singles. They had seven number-ones: [...] "Waterloo" [...] (1974); [...] "Mamma Mia", [...] "Fernando" [...] and [...] "Dancing Queen" [...] (all 1976); [...] "Knowing Me, Knowing You", [...] "The Name of the Game" [...] (both 1977); and [...] "Take <b>a</b> <b>Chance</b> <b>on</b> Me" [...] (1978).|$|E

His style was {{distinctly}} shaped by [...] "big dinosaurs of rock" [...] such as The Who and Led Zeppelin. In addition, Gass lists his influences as being Tom Waits and Tony Robbins. The band claimed that the inspiration for the song [...] "Tribute" [...] came after Black played Metallica's [...] "One" [...] for Gass, describing it as [...] "the best song in the world", leading to an attempt to themselves write an even better song.|$|E
500|$|The novel marked Roberts' {{return to}} {{contemporary}} romance. [...] The new series revolved around a wedding planning enterprise run by four childhood friends. [...] This first story featured the developing relationship between wedding photographer Mackensie [...] "Mac" [...] Elliot and English professor Carter Maguire. [...] Like several other Roberts novels, Vision In White explored how a protagonist balanced {{a successful career}} with a dysfunctional family environment. [...] Although the hero is a fairly typical representation of the romance novel archetype of the professor, the novel is slightly unusual for a romance in that the hero must convince the heroine to take <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>on</b> love.|$|E

[...] "The last Jackson hero(ine) has carried peacock feathers to the dance. Holier than Mahalia."

500|$|After {{his release}} from prison, Vick was mentored by former Indianapolis Colts coach Tony Dungy. The {{prospect}} of his return to professional football {{was the subject of}} much conjecture as his suspension and incarceration continued. In 2007, ESPN's John Clayton said few general managers were in a strong enough position to consider taking <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>on</b> Vick, and even then most NFL owners would be concerned about a fan and media backlash. There was also no chance of Vick resurrecting his career in the Canadian Football League, he said. Following a furor in 2007 over Ricky Williams playing there while serving a suspension, the CFL banned players currently suspended by the NFL. In any case, Clayton said it would be nearly impossible for a convicted felon to get a Canadian work visa. He did think, however, that Vick would be [...] "unstoppable" [...] if he decided to play in the Arena Football League.|$|E

It's a tough thing to go through. Do you take the Led Zeppelin approach and never play again, because the guy was that important? That's the approach we've taken for a lot of years. Or, do you give it a shot, try something? We're willing to take <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>on</b> it. It's completely a reunion because the three of us who're left are back together.
