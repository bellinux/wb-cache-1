A 1963 transportation study which supported construction, expected the population of Hamilton to be 785,000 by 1985, while the <b>actual</b> <b>population</b> reached 480,000 by 2001. Employment in the industrial bayfront had dropped and a commuting route between Hamilton Mountain and the bayfront was less necessary.|$|E
25|$|The {{other major}} reason for {{consolidation}} was that Philadelphia's <b>actual</b> <b>population</b> center was not in Philadelphia, but north of Vine Street. Between 1844 and 1854 Philadelphia's population grew by 29.5 percent. Places like Spring Garden grew by 111.5 percent, and Kensington by 109.5 percent. This population shift was draining the city of much-needed tax revenue for police and fire departments, water, sewage, and other city improvements.|$|E

5000|$|In genetics, underdominance (referred to in some {{texts as}} [...] "negative overdominance") is the {{opposite}} of overdominance. It is the selection against the heterozygote, causing disruptive selection and divergent genotypes. Underdominance exists in situations where the heterozygotic genotype is inferior in fitness to either the dominant or recessive homozygotic genotype. Compared to examples of overdominance in <b>actual</b> <b>populations,</b> underdominance is considered more unstable and may lead to the fixation of either allele.|$|R

40|$|Abstract A common {{characteristic}} {{observed in}} many biological invasions is {{the existence of}} a lag between the time of arrival by the alien population and the time when established populations are noticed. Consider-able advances have been made in modeling the expansion of invading species, and there is often remarkable congruence between the behavior of these models with spread of <b>actual</b> <b>populations.</b> While these models have been used to characterize expansion of very newly founded colonies, there have been few at-tempts to compare the behavior predicted from theory with spread in <b>actual</b> newly founded <b>populations,</b> lar-gely due to the difficulty of sampling sparse popula-tions. Models predict that time lags in the radial expansion of newly invaded populations may be due to time requirements for the population to grow from founding to detectable levels. Models also indicate that these time lags can be predicted based upon population parameters such as the intrinsic rate of population growth and diffusion coefficient. In this paper, we compared the behavior of these models with historical data on gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar, establishment and spread to show similarities between model pre-dictions and observed population spread, both of which exhibited temporal lags of expansion. However, <b>actual</b> <b>populations</b> exhibited certain behaviors that were not predicted, and this could be due, in part, to the exis-tence of Allee effects and stochasticity. Further work that incorporates these effects is needed to more fully understand the growth of incipient colonies of invading species. Ultimately, this information can be of critical importance in the selection of effective strategies for their detection and eradication...|$|R
25|$|Since Cambodia {{had had no}} {{official}} population count {{for the last five}} years, the country's population figure is merely guesswork, which has led to incorrect projections of possible voters – making it difficult for the National Election Commission to ascertain the number of actual voters that should be listed in Cambodia's voting rolls. The lack of <b>actual</b> <b>population</b> count could have led to fraudulent voting, such as voters voting in multiple precincts using different names. According to the opposition CNRP, between 1.2 and 1.3 million names were omitted from voting rolls.|$|E
25|$|With a {{population}} of approximately 93.6 million, Henan is the third most populous Chinese province after Guangdong and Shandong. It is also the fifth most populous sub-national division in the world. If it were a country by itself, {{it would be the}} twelfth most populous in the world, just behind Mexico and ahead of the Philippines. However, the hukou system shows Henan as the most populous province in China with over 103 million people, as it counts the migrant Henanese laborers as residents of Henan, instead of the province they currently reside in. On the other hand, Guangdong is shown as having only 81 million people, though the <b>actual</b> <b>population</b> is 95 million due to the influx of migrants from other provinces.|$|E
25|$|Within {{three years}} {{tensions}} between the two communities in administrative affairs began to show. In particular disputes over separate municipalities and taxation created a deadlock in government. A constitutional court ruled in 1963 Makarios had failed to uphold article 173 of the constitution which called {{for the establishment of}} separate municipalities for Turkish Cypriots. Makarios subsequently declared his intention to ignore the judgement, resulting in the West German judge resigning from his position. Makarios proposed thirteen amendments to the constitution, which according to the historian Keith Kyle had the effect of resolving most of the issues in the Greek Cypriot favour. Under the proposals, the President and Vice President would lose their veto, the separate municipalities as sought after by the Turkish Cypriots would be abandoned, the need for separate majorities by both communities in passing legislation would be discarded and the civil service contribution would be set at <b>actual</b> <b>population</b> ratios (82:18) instead of the slightly higher figure for Turkish Cypriots.|$|E

25|$|The eleven Confederate States in the 1860 United States Census had 297 {{towns and}} cities with 835,000 people; of these 162 with 681,000 people were at one point {{occupied}} by Union forces. Eleven were destroyed or severely damaged by war action, including Atlanta (with an 1860 population of 9,600), Charleston, Columbia, and Richmond (with prewar populations of 40,500, 8,100, and 37,900, respectively); the eleven contained 115,900 people in the 1860 census, or 14% of the urban South. Historians have not estimated what their <b>actual</b> <b>population</b> was when Union forces arrived. The number of people (as of 1860) {{who lived in the}} destroyed towns represented just over 1% of the Confederacy's 1860 population. In addition, 45 court houses were burned (out of 830). The South's agriculture was not highly mechanized. The value of farm implements and machinery in the 1860 Census was $81 million; by 1870, there was 40% less, worth just $48 million. Many old tools had broken through heavy use; new tools were rarely available; even repairs were difficult.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to complete roll-back {{of the proposed}} reservation, the striking protesters have demanded that an expert committee comprising members from non-political organisations to review the existing reservation policy and find out whether reservation for OBCs is required at all. This {{is based on the}} current confusion over <b>actual</b> <b>population</b> of OBC as various organisations have indicated various figures for the population of OBCs. This is mostly because the 1931 national census was the last time detailed population and economic data was gathered along with caste information for the OBC population. The Mandal Commission, using extrapolated 1931 Census figures, put it at 52 per cent, the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) at 32 per cent and the National Family and Health Survey at 29.8 per cent. Keeping in view the fact that already 23.5% of all college seats are reserved for OBCs, the rationale of extending reservation is debated. The protesters also demand that no penal action be taken against the protesters and publication of a white paper by the government, making its stand clear on reservation.|$|E

500|$|The Australian swellshark is {{harmless}} {{to humans}} and seldom utilized, though recently {{in parts of}} Tasmania some have begun to be marketed {{as a source of}} [...] "flake". It is regarded as a nuisance by lobster fishers due to its habit of entering traps to eat the contents. Every year, substantial numbers of Australian swellsharks are caught as bycatch in the southeast Australian shark gillnet fishery, and more in bottom trawls and on longlines. These animals are usually released, and likely suffer minimal mortality due to their resilience. Since this species at present faces little risk from fisheries, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Least Concern. Although commercial fisheries reported drops in Australian swellshark catches from 1973 to 1976 and 1998 to 2001, these appeared to have resulted from changing fishing habits rather than <b>actual</b> <b>population</b> declines. Nevertheless, as a precaution the government of Tasmania has instituted a possession limit of two sharks per person or five sharks per boat per day.|$|E
