While kabuki and joruri popular {{to the middle class}} focused on new and experimental entertainment, Noh strived to preserve its established high standards and historic <b>authenticity</b> <b>and</b> remained mostly unchanged throughout the era. To capture the essence of performances given by great masters, every detail in movements and positions was reproduced by others, generally resulting in an increasingly slow, ceremonial tempo over time.|$|E

5|$|David told Scott-James {{that she}} planned to publish the {{articles}} as a book, and was allowed to retain the copyright by the magazine. Even before all the articles had been published, she had assembled them into a typescript volume called A Book of Mediterranean Food; many of the recipes ignored the restrictions of rationing in favour of <b>authenticity,</b> <b>and</b> several cases the ingredients were not available in British shops. David submitted her manuscript {{to a series of}} publishers, all of whom turned it down. One of them explained that a collection of unconnected recipes needed linking text. David took this advice, but conscious of her inexperience as a writer she kept her own prose short and quoted extensively from established authors whose views on the Mediterranean might carry more weight. She submitted the revised typescript to John Lehmann, a publisher more associated with poetry than cookery; he accepted it and agreed to an advance payment of £100. A Book of Mediterranean Food was published in June 1950.|$|E
5|$|Pierce's directorial debut was The Legend of Boggy Creek, {{which was}} {{inspired}} by the Fouke Monster, a seven-foot-tall Bigfoot-like creature said to live in the swamps near Fouke, Arkansas. Pierce said he did not necessarily believe in the legend, but was fascinated with the stories. After interviewing Fouke residents who said they encountered the monster, Pierce became impressed with their <b>authenticity</b> <b>and</b> down-to-earth qualities. He approached Earl E. Smith, an acquaintance from the advertising business, to adapt those eyewitness tales into a screenplay. The film was shot at locations in Fouke, Texarkana and Shreveport, using a camera Pierce built himself at home. It was filmed in a faux documentary style, and included interviews with Fouke residents mixed with dramatizations of their supposed encounters with the creature. Like Pierce, the film's financial backers and many of the actors had never been involved in a film before.|$|E

Framestore was also heavily involved in the art direction and, along with The Third Floor, the previsualization. Tim Webber stated that 80 percent of the movie consisted of CGcompared to James Cameron's Avatar (2009), which was 60 percent CG. To simulate the <b>authenticity</b> <b>and</b> reflection of unfiltered light in space, a manually controlled lighting system consisting of 1.8 million individually controlled LED lights was built. The 3D imagery was designed and supervised by Chris Parks. The majority of the 3D was created by stereo rendering the CG at Framestore. The remaining footage was converted into 3D in post-productionprincipally at Prime Focus, London, with additional conversion work by Framestore. Prime Focus's supervisor was Richard Baker.|$|E

40|$|The {{value of}} {{authentic}} knowing, autonomous behavior and altruistic motivation is presented. <b>Authenticity,</b> autonomy <b>and</b> altruism are primary human capacities and keys for {{individual and collective}} transformation. Realizing the full development of these three basic potentialities can serve as goals and standards for well-being. <b>Authenticity,</b> autonomy <b>and</b> altruism are described, ways of developing them explored and their role in relationships and classrooms discussed. Development {{is the process of}} potentiality becoming actuality. Helping people achieve their potential to find a measure of success in school, life and society is a primary goal of education. This paper will briefly explore <b>authenticity,</b> autonomy <b>and</b> altruism as three essential basic skills or capacities for developing human potential and creating healthy relationships <b>and</b> societies. <b>Authenticity</b> refers to genuineness and truth, autonomy to moral decisions and actions, and altruism to love and selflessness. How can we through conscious effort, training and experience develop these qualities? These basic human capacities seek expression in life. We can either encourage or discourage them t...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the role of}} <b>authenticity,</b> its elements <b>and</b> manifestations {{in the process of}} developing a relationship between micro-celebrities and their fans. The issue is demonstrated by the example of YouTube, the most important video-sharing site. Part of the issue is whether the YouTube content creators and their subscribers develop parasocial relationships as defined by Horton and Wohl (1956), <b>and</b> <b>authenticity</b> as an element that sets the relationship between micro-celebrities and their fans apart from the relationship between traditional celebrities and their fans. The theoretical part of the thesis deals with concepts that are associated with development of the micro-celebrity phenomenon, discusses the concepts of micro-celebrity <b>and</b> <b>authenticity</b> themselves, <b>and</b> expounds the parasocial relationships theory. Analysis of the role of authenticity {{in the process of developing}} the relationship between micro-celebrities and their fans is based on qualitative research that draws from interviews with micro-celebrities and their fans and the analysis of videos and comments by which viewers respond to them...|$|R
