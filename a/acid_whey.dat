Additionally, sustainable and energy efficient treatment methods for high strength liquid wastes from dairies cleaning operation are needed to reduce the costs of wastewater treatment. Samples of <b>acid</b> <b>whey</b> and spent cleaning solutions from a quarg cheese production plant were collected. The composition and physical properties were analysed and evaluated against waste treatment process requirements. The occurrence of different waste streams, their volumes and frequencies were also investigated. A laboratory scale membrane nanofiltration plant was designed, and built for investigation of the volume reduction of cleaning process effluents with emphasis to treatment options for the filtration concentrates. The examination of the rheological properties of alkaline CIP wastewaters at different volume reduction ratios clearly shows that these effluents are Newtonian fluids even at high concentrations. The anaerobic biodegradability of <b>acid</b> <b>whey</b> and mixtures containing portions of alkaline CIP wastewaters at different volume reduction ratios was tested. Characteristic process kinetics for <b>acid</b> <b>whey</b> fermentation in batch mode was observed. The occurrence of a second lag-phase in mixtures containing larger portions of <b>acid</b> <b>whey</b> was identified as phase separation- due to rapid acidification of lactose. Anaerobic digestion (AD) was identified as a suitable treatment option for <b>acid</b> <b>whey</b> and alkaline CIP wastewaters. Four anaerobic digester types were designed with regard to their suitability for high strength waste treatment and were built and operated at laboratory scale. The reactors tested were: a) A Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR); b) An Anaerobic Membrane Reactor (AMR); c) An Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) re- actor; and d) A novel two-stage process design consisting of a combined acidification and crystallization stage and a gaslift driven fluidised bed methanogenic stage. The operation of the AMR process and also of the UASB process with internal circulation and pH-control using alkaline CIP effluents was evaluated at high loading rates of 7. 7 g•L- 1 •d- 1 and 10. 2 g•L- 1 •d- 1 respective. However, in the experiments it was demonstrated that even with perfect biomass retention the operation of one stage anaerobic digestion at high loading rates caused process upsets. Precipitation and accumulation of milk minerals within the sludge was observed in all one stage experiments. The conclusions drawn from one stage studies led to the design of a novel high-rate diges- tion system to meet the demands of anaerobic digestion of <b>acid</b> <b>whey</b> and effluents from dairy plant cleaning.

A productivity of 10 g/l per hour was obtained at D= 0. 4 h high - 1 (substrate conversion 93 %) and of 13. 5 g/l per hour at D= 1. 0 h high - 1 (s ubstrate conversion 50 %) ...|$|R
40|$|Whey, {{by-product}} of cheese or casein production, is classified in sweet or <b>acid</b> <b>whey.</b> Composed by water, proteins, lactose and minerals, when concentrated it produces proteins ingredients with high functionality and nutritional value. However, whey protein manufacturing {{has been applied}} only to sweet whey. <b>Acid</b> <b>whey</b> has been generally dumped down as dairy waste. This paper shows results obtained from <b>acid</b> <b>whey</b> product addition in ice cream formulation, in model system, ascertaining by sensory evaluation the panelists acceptance for five different milk substitutions levels. Ice cream samples were made with a mix composition of 2. 5 % milk fat, 18. 3 % sucrose, 2. 3 % egg yolk solids, 0. 3 % stabilizer-emulsifier and vanilla flavor. Standard ice cream (P) was formulated with 10. 09 % of dry skim milk. Other four mixture were repared with dry <b>acid</b> <b>whey</b> product (SAP) replacing dry skim milk in 100, 80, 60 e 30 % levels. Evaluation of effect for using SAP, to total or partial replace of dry skim milk, was done by sweet taste sensory test. There was no statically significative difference (p≤ 0. 5) between samples for sweet taste. There was good panelists acceptance for 60 and 30 % substitutions levels. © 2006 SBCTA...|$|E
40|$|The use of ultra-filtered lactic <b>acid</b> <b>whey</b> {{retentate}} {{was investigated}} for {{the making of}} sour cream. The utilization of lactic <b>acid</b> <b>whey</b> is limited due to its special properties, so the logical utilization way is {{to use it in}} fermented products. First, we concentrated lactic <b>acid</b> <b>whey</b> collected from cottage cheese making by ultrafiltration (UF), then UF Whey Retentate (UFWR) was added (by 2, 5, and 10 %) into fat standardized cream for sour cream making. We investigated the texture and sensory properties of the sour cream samples compared with the industrial products. Generally, we can state that the use of small portion of UF whey retentate did not result noticeable changes and did not reduce the sensory value of sour creams. Higher UF whey retentate addition improved some texture properties of experimental samples, but the summarized evaluation of UFWR addition was not unequivocal. Control samples showed better results. Based on our results, the sample, which contained 5 % UF whey retentate, had good texture and acceptable sensory properties. Furthermore, more than 5 % UF lactic <b>acid</b> <b>whey</b> retentate (coming from our own ultrafiltration process) resulted remarkably worse sensory properties than the other samples. Further investigation is needed to find the optimal composition and sensory properties of UFWR. Furthermore, we have to perform technological investigation to reach a higher concentration factor using pre-treatment of whey and to avoid the precipitation of whey proteins during the high temperature pasteurization of cream, cream mixed with UFWR or diafiltered whey retentate. We guess that the use of one-stage diafiltration would already decrease the unfavourable sensory properties of lactic <b>acid</b> <b>whey</b> retentate...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of spray}} drying for {{dehydration}} of <b>acid</b> <b>whey</b> is generally {{limited by the}} appearance of uncontrolled thickening and solidifying of the whey mass during the lactose crystallization step. The origin of this physical change is still unknown and probably linked to complex interactions between physical properties and chemical composition of these products. To understand this phenomenon, we simulated the thickening of concentrated <b>acid</b> <b>whey</b> on a laboratory scale by measuring the flow resistance changes as a function of time and whey composition. The thickening process was characterized by an amplitude of torque and a lag time (induction time). Thickening of lactic <b>acid</b> <b>whey</b> concentrate occurred regardless of the presence of whey proteins or lactose crystals. Moreover, this work clearly demonstrated that the thickening process was due to the formation of filamentous structures corresponding to calcium lactate crystals and showed a large dependence on calcium and lactate contents, pH, and phosphate concentration...|$|E
40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} the growth of biomass and {{production}} of selected metabolit–lactic acid by thermophilic bacteria Bacillus coagulans. The resulting selected metabolite was determined by HPLC method. Cultivations of this genus were performed on synthetic media, where the influence of carbohydrate used as carbon source was tested. Lactose was more suitable fot growth of biomass and glucose for production of lactic <b>acid.</b> On natural <b>whey</b> media the influence of different conditions were tested. The highest yields of biomass and production of lactic acid were observed on enriched whey medium. The last part deals with comparing the production of biomass and metabolites, depending on the volume of media. There were compared selected bioengineering characteristics of all cultivations...|$|R
40|$|Moderate {{and chronic}} bouts of {{exercise}} {{may lead to}} positive metabolic, molecular, and morphological adaptations, improving health. Although exercise training stimulates the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), their overall intracellular concentration may not reach damaging levels due to enhancement of antioxidant responses. However, inadequate exercise training (i. e., single bout of high-intensity or excessive exercise) may result in oxidative stress, muscle fatigue and muscle injury. Moreover, during the recovery period, impaired immunity has been reported, for example; excessive-inflammation and compensatory immunosuppression. Nutritional supplements, {{sometimes referred to as}} immuno-nutrients, may be required to reduce immunosuppression and excessive inflammation. Herein, we discuss the action and the possible targets of key immuno-nutrients such as L-glutamine, L-arginine, branched chain amino <b>acids</b> (BCAA) and <b>whey</b> protein...|$|R
