5|$|The game {{features}} no heads-up display. Instead, {{condition of}} the player character is relayed through the sound cues of his heartbeat and breathing, which become more pronounced when wounded, and color draining from the screen with loss of blood and strength. Specific injuries are also indicated visually and aurally: for example, <b>a</b> <b>broken</b> <b>leg</b> causes the character to limp while making appropriate noises, while a broken arm makes aiming more difficult. The health system {{was designed as a}} more realistic take on character injury than other games of its genre in that different wounds, including poisoning and bleeding, require different remedies, such as a splint for <b>a</b> <b>broken</b> <b>leg.</b> The inventory screen shows the character's injuries (displayed on his character model) and all carried items.|$|E

5|$|Both {{ships were}} damaged in the engagement, {{although}} Saumarez's damage was almost entirely confined to his rigging: very few shots had actually struck his hull during the battle, {{and the only}} one that provoked notice passed across the deck without causing injury and struck a cannon on the opposite site, setting it off {{in the direction of a}} number of small gunboats that were approaching from the shore. Casualties on Crescent were equally light, with just one man injured; he had been standing too close to his own cannon during the opening broadside and had been struck by the recoiling gun, suffering <b>a</b> <b>broken</b> <b>leg.</b> Damage and losses on the French ship were very severe, with the rigging in tatters, the hull and lower masts repeatedly struck and casualties that Saumarez initially estimated at more than 120 men killed or wounded, although French accounts give the lower figure of 33 killed and 48 wounded.|$|E
