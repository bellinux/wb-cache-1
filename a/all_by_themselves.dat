On August 31, 2012, they closed out Good Morning Americas Summer Concert Series in Central Park, in New York. It was their first performance as a fivesome since Richardson rejoined the group. During the show, they announced {{that they were going}} to have their third cruise in October 2013. It will be the first cruise to feature all five members.|$|E
25|$|At first matters went well. The king greatly {{expanded}} the initial endowment and made large donations {{of cash and}} materials. for the work. Soon, however, things began to go seriously wrong. As the 1280s progressed the royal finance first got into arrears then dried up. King Edward needed {{money to pay for}} his numerous wars and workmen to build the great castles such as Harlech he put up to cement his conquest of Wales. He took not only the money that had been set aside for Vale Royal but also conscripted the masons and other labourers to build his Welsh fortifications and in 1290 announced that he was no longer interested in the abbey and would have nothing more to do with it. The monks were left struggling to pay to complete the vast project and provide the running costs of it <b>all</b> <b>by</b> <b>themselves,</b> a task that would prove beyond their means, despite a substantial income, and incurring huge debts to other church institutions, royal officials, the building contractors and even to the merchants of Lucca. Work stopped for at least a decade after 1290 and was resumed only on a much reduced scale thereafter. Nevertheless, by the 1330s the monks had managed to complete the east end of the church (the rest remained a shell) and sufficient of the cloister buildings to make the place habitable, though far from complete.|$|E

A cluster of Star Buddies, assistants to the Bears and Great Wishing Star, drives him off; he then morphs into a raging red cloud. The Bears shoot light at him from their bellies, forming their [...] "Care Bear Stare"; the Cousins also help by using their [...] "Care Cousin Call". Afterward, True Heart and Noble Heart decide to search for him, and leave the Bears to handle missions <b>all</b> <b>by</b> <b>themselves.</b>|$|E

The premises of Gruff and Tackleton were the great feature of the street; but you might have knocked down Caleb Plummer's dwelling with a hammer or two, and carried off the pieces in a cart.|$|R

500|$|According to National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) senior {{climatologist}} Kevin E. Trenberth, [...] "The {{answer to}} the oft-asked question of whether an event is caused by climate change {{is that it is}} the wrong question. All weather events are affected by climate change because the environment in which they occur is warmer and moister than it used to be." [...] He illustrates by pointing out that steroids in a baseball player's system do not cause home runs <b>all</b> <b>by</b> <b>themselves</b> but do make home runs more likely. Meteorologist Kerry Emanuel stressed that no individual weather event, such as Hurricane Sandy, can be attributed to climate change, or any specific cause, for that matter.|$|E
500|$|Most modern count-classifiers {{are derived}} from words that {{originally}} were free-standing nouns in older varieties of Chinese, and have since been grammaticalized to become bound morphemes. In other words, count-classifiers tend to come from words that once had specific meaning but lost it (a process known as semantic bleaching). Many, however, still have related forms that work as nouns <b>all</b> <b>by</b> <b>themselves,</b> such as the classifier (...) dài for long, ribbon-like objects: the modern word dàizi means [...] "ribbon". In fact, the majority of classifiers {{can also be used}} as other parts of speech, such as nouns. Mass-classifiers, on the other hand, are more transparent in meaning than count-classifiers; while the latter have some historical meaning, the former are still full-fledged nouns. For example, (bēi, cup), is both a classifier as in (yì [...] chá, [...] "a [...] of tea") and the word for a cup as in (jiǔbēi, [...] "wine glass").|$|E
500|$|The {{speed and}} {{facility}} with which Dylan wrote topical songs {{attracted the attention}} of other musicians in the New York folk scene. In a radio interview on WBAI in June 1962, Pete Seeger described Dylan as [...] "the most prolific songwriter on the scene" [...] and then asked Dylan how many songs he had written recently. Dylan replied, [...] "I might go for two weeks without writing these songs. I write a lot of stuff. In fact, I wrote five songs last night but I gave all the papers away in some place called the Bitter End." [...] Dylan also expressed the impersonal idea that the songs were not his own creation. In an interview with Sing Out! magazine, Dylan said, [...] "The songs are there. They exist <b>all</b> <b>by</b> <b>themselves</b> just waiting for someone to write them down. I just put them down on paper. If I didn't do it, somebody else would." ...|$|E

500|$|The cheetah is a {{carnivore}} that prefers medium-sized prey with a {{body mass}} ranging from [...] Blesbok, duiker, Grant's gazelle, impala, reedbuck, springbok, and Thomson's gazelle {{are some of the}} common targets of the cheetah. Other prey animals include the bat-eared fox, bushbuck, kudu, hartebeest, nyala, oribi, roan antelope, steenbok, sable antelope, and waterbuck; they prey less frequently on African buffalo, gemsbok, giraffe, ostrich, warthog, wildebeest, and zebra. A study showed that a major proportion of the diet of Asiatic cheetahs consists of livestock; local species such as chinkara, desert hare, goitered gazelle, ibex, rodents, and wild sheep are also hunted. Generally, only groups of cheetahs will attempt to kill large animals such as hartebeest, although mothers with young cubs will attempt to secure a large prey <b>all</b> <b>by</b> <b>themselves.</b> There are no records of cheetah killing human beings. The diet of a cheetah depends on the area in which it lives. For example, on the East African plains, its preferred prey is the Thomson's gazelle, somewhat smaller than the cheetah. In contrast, in Kwa-Zulu Natal the preferred prey is the significantly larger nyala, males of which can weigh up to [...] They do, however, opt for young and adolescent targets, which make up about 50% of the cheetah diet despite constituting {{only a small portion of}} the prey population.|$|E

2500|$|The {{following}} month, Chelsea Dulaney, {{a reporter}} who had originally covered the case at the Tar Heel, wrote {{an article on the}} Atavist platform taking a skeptical look at the sealing. She speculated that the seal's real purpose was to conceal early missteps by the Chapel Hill police, who might also not have been competent enough to handle the investigation <b>all</b> <b>by</b> <b>themselves.</b> The town's court filings, she noted, revealed that after the first two months of the investigation no new search warrants had been sought.

2500|$|Since e-passports {{are issued}} to all Chinese {{citizens}} and e-gates have been installed {{in most of}} the international airports in China, returning Chinese citizens do not need to line up at the immigration check points for entry stamps as foreigners do.

Entry information and their facial image will be stored automatically in a database. (No entry stamps will be left in their e-passport, but any passport holder could request gratis entry or exit records.) E-gates are not only used for fast entry for Chinese e-passport holders, but they have also [...] been tested for fast-exit in Beijing Capital Airport Terminal 2.

And keeping house, as they did, <b>all</b> alone <b>by</b> <b>themselves,</b> in that lonely craft, a marvel it is, that they should ever have quarreled. And then to divorce, and yet dwell in the same tenement, was only aggravating the evil. So Belisarius and Antonina again came together.
