5|$|Between 1870 and 1873, chemist and {{physicist}} William Crookes conducted {{experiments to}} determine {{the validity of the}} phenomena produced by three mediums: Florence Cook, Kate Fox, and Home. Crookes' final report in 1874 concluded that the phenomena produced by all three mediums were genuine, a result which was roundly derided by the scientific establishment. Crookes recorded that he controlled and secured Home by placing his feet on the top of Home's feet. Crooke's method of foot control later proved inadequate when used with Eusapia Palladino, as she merely slipped her foot out and into her sturdy shoe. In addition, Crookes' motives, methods, and conclusions with regard to Florence Cook were called into question, both at the time and subsequently, casting doubt on his conclusions <b>about</b> <b>Home.</b> In a series of experiments in London at the house of Crookes in February 1875, the medium Anna Eva Fay managed to fool Crookes into believing she had genuine psychic powers. Fay later confessed to her fraud and revealed the tricks she had used.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the child}} of an Ulster family who had spent {{much time in the}} area (his father had moved back there several years after Law moved to Scotland), Law {{believed}} the gap between Ulster Unionism and Irish Nationalism could never be crossed. Despite this he said little <b>about</b> <b>Home</b> Rule until the passing of the Parliament Act in 1911, calling it the [...] "Home Rule in Disguise Act" [...] and saying it was an attempt to change parliamentary procedures so as to allow Home Rule [...] "through the back door". After the passing of the Act he made a speech in the Commons saying that if the Liberals wished to pass a Home Rule Bill they should submit it to the electorate by calling a general election. His elevation to the leadership of the Conservative Party allowed him a platform to voice his opinion to the public, and his speeches (culminating with the January 1912 speech at the Royal Albert Hall) were centred on Home Rule as much as they were around tariff reform. Law was supported by Edward Carson, leader of the Ulster Unionists. Although Law sympathised with the Ulster Unionists politically he did not agree with the religious intolerance shown to Catholics.|$|E

[...] His maiden speech in the Commons was made in 1851 in a debate on disorders in Ceylon, shortly following his tour of the country. [...] Otherwise he took little interest in the affairs of the House of Commons until 1866 when he expressed his opposition to Gladstone's Reform Bill. [...] This played a part in Gladstone's resignation, the election of the Conservative Derby government and Disraeli's Second Reform Act. [...] The relationship between Grosvenor and Gladstone later improved and in Gladstone's resignation honours in 1874, Grosvenor was created the 1st Duke of Westminster. [...] When Gladstone became Prime Minister again in 1880, he appointed Grosvenor as Master of the Horse, a position appropriate to his interests in horse racing but [...] "not an actively political office". In the 1880s Grosvenor disagreed with Gladstone again, this time <b>about</b> <b>Home</b> Rule for Ireland. [...] During this dispute, Grosvenor sold his portrait of Gladstone that had been painted by Millais. [...] Ten years later they were again reconciled when they both opposed atrocities by the Turks against the Armenians. When Gladstone died in 1898, Grosvenor presided over a Gladstone National Memorial committee that commissioned statues of him, and rebuilt Gladstone's St Deiniol's Library at Hawarden in north Wales.|$|E
