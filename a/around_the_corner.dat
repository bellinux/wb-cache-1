5|$|Miller's {{season ended}} early {{when he was}} {{recalled}} to duty. However, he had continued disciplinary problems, and left the Militia on 8 November 1941. Miller and a friend then attempted to join the Royal Australian Navy. When the navy rejected his friend, Miller tore up his own paperwork, left the recruiting office, and walked <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> to the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) recruiting office, where he enlisted.|$|E
5|$|The best decade for January movies, Burr writes, {{may well}} have been the 1940s. It began with what he {{suggests}} was best January in cinema history. The Grapes of Wrath, His Girl Friday and The Shop <b>Around</b> <b>the</b> <b>Corner,</b> all considered classics, were released in January 1940. Later in the decade, other classic films would first reach screens during January, such as Sullivan's Travels, Shadow of a Doubt and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.|$|E

5|$|Wyatt {{said that}} he saw Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury in Spangenberger's gun and {{hardware}} store on 4th Street filling their gun belts with cartridges. Ike testified afterward that Tom was not there {{and that he had}} tried to buy a new revolver but the owner saw Ike's bandaged head and refused to sell him one. Ike apparently had not heard Virgil tell him that his confiscated weapons were at the Grand Hotel <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> from Spangenberger's shop.|$|E
5|$|From the Lexington Avenue entrance, {{there are}} two short {{escalators}} and a stair from the northwest corner, a staircase from the southwest corner, and a short elevator hidden <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> from the escalators. From the fare control, {{there are two}} long escalators and a stair to an intermediate level, and then two shorter escalators {{and a pair of}} stairs to a lower mezzanine. Here, the bank splits and there are two separate tubes of two escalators and a stair each to each platform. The platform elevator has its own two turnstiles, and makes three stops (mezzanine, upper platform, lower platform).|$|E
5|$|News {{coverage}} of legal actions also provided considerable free publicity. Variety reported that lines for the Broadway production stretched <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> {{after it was}} condemned in the magistrates' court. Before the court proceedings, the play was earning about $12,000 per week. After proceedings began, the box office increased to $14,000–15,000 per week, which Variety described as near the theater's capacity. Woods added matinees and increased the top ticket prices; the weekly box office reached over $17,000 {{at the end of}} November. By the time the production closed, {{it was one of the}} most successful of that season, having sold over 200,000 tickets across 268 performances.|$|E

50|$|The first {{members of}} the class had curved windows {{reaching}} <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> of <b>the</b> cabs. For easier manufacturing, later vehicles were eqipped with flat glass windows overall, and have pillars in <b>the</b> cab <b>corners.</b>|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>corner</b> articulations are a {{particularly}} challenging part of rug design. The ornaments {{have to be}} woven {{in a way that}} the pattern continues without interruption <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> between horizontal and vertical borders. This requires advance planning either by a skilled weaver who is able to plan the design from start, or by a designer who composes a cartoon before the weaving begins. If the ornaments articulate correctly <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners,</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> are termed to be [...] "resolved", or [...] "reconciled". In village or nomadic rugs, which are usually woven without a detailed advance plan, <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> of <b>the</b> borders are often not resolved. The weaver then discontinues the pattern at a certain stage, e.g., when the lower horizontal border is finished, and starts anew with the vertical borders. The analysis of <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> resolution helps distinguishing rural village, or nomadic, from workshop rugs.|$|R
5|$|When Virgil Earp {{learned that}} Wyatt {{was talking to}} the Cowboys at Spangenberg's gun shop, he went there himself. Virgil testified {{afterward}} that he thought he saw all four men, Ike Clanton, Billy Clanton, Frank McLaury, and Tom McLaury, buying cartridges. Virgil went <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> on Allen Street to the Wells Fargo office, where he picked up a 10-gauge or 12-gauge, short, double-barreled shotgun. It was an unusually cold and windy day in Tombstone, and Virgil was wearing a long overcoat. To avoid alarming Tombstone's public, Virgil hid the shotgun under his overcoat when he returned to Hafford's Saloon.|$|E
5|$|Jack {{eventually}} married Polly in 1915, {{after they}} had moved to Elmore Street, Everton. One of the witnesses at the wedding was Polly's sister, Catherine Seddon. Daughter Edith Lennon was born that year and then Charles (21 November 1918 – 26 May 2002). The Lennons moved back to Toxteth Park, and Jack died in 1921, at 57 Copperfield Street. He was buried on 6th August 1921 at Allerton Cemetery. His grave, number 206 in Roman Catholic section 4, is an unmarked public grave. Polly could not read or write, but {{was reported to be}} very humorous and supposedly had psychic abilities. After Jack died, Polly did not have enough money to keep the whole Lennon family together, so she placed two of her children, Alf and Edith, in the Blue Coat School Orphanage. It was situated just <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> from Newcastle Road (where Julia Stanley lived). Polly died on 30 January 1949.|$|E
5|$|Miller's {{season ended}} early {{after he was}} called back for army service and he was {{stationed}} in the northern suburb of Broadmeadows. However, he had disciplinary problems and disliked taking orders from his officers, whom he often felt were inferior to him. He left the Militia on 8 November 1941. Miller and a friend then attempted to join the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) as stokers. When the navy would not take his friend, Miller tore up his paperwork in protest, left the recruiting office, and walked <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> to the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) recruiting office. He was {{acutely aware of the}} risks, as many of his playing colleagues had been killed, injured or captured. The threat of combat increased when the Pacific Theatre of World War II opened on 7 December 1941 with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The 194142 cricket season was cancelled and many cricket and football grounds were converted into army bases.|$|E
50|$|In October 1997 {{there was}} another modernization. The front was rounded off, with the {{windscreen}} made to look larger by placing a piece of black plastic beneath it. The four square lamps were replaced by more irregularly shaped single units which wrap <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corners.</b> <b>The</b> Titan logo was changed from red to white characters.|$|R

5|$|The current {{managing}} {{partners of}} the Park Grill are O'Malley and Horan. O'Malley, {{who once worked}} for the U.S. Representative Dan Rostenkowski, runs the re-purposed firehouse, Chicago Firehouse Restaurant, which is located <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> from the home of Mayor Richard M. Daley, {{who has been a}} steady customer. The son of Alderman Edward Vrdolyak has also been a business partner with O'Malley. Matthew O'Malley and his brother Paul were picked to run the Clock Tower Cafe at the Sydney Marovitz Golf Course in Lincoln Park on the Chicago lakefront. James Horan is a restaurant owner and caterer. He is president of Blue Plate Catering, which runs a cafe at Gallery 37, an after-school program created and fostered by Mayor Daley's wife, Maggie Daley.|$|E
5|$|An {{official}} {{video for}} the remix version produced by HarDrum was {{included on the}} CD format of the single; it included unreleased footage that did not appear on the original version, featuring different angle shots of the girls, expressions from the public's faces and the band performing erratically. It also included various scenes of people on-set helping with the music video's production, and one holding the wired fence. In July and September 2015, the group uploaded two teaser videos of a remix version produced by Fly Dream in order to commemorate the single's 15th anniversary on 19 December that same year; by then, it still remained unreleased. On 7 August 2016, one year since the two trailers, t.A.T.u. uploaded an HD version of the video with new unreleased scenes and extended footage. Lasting five minutes and 37 seconds, it showed an extended cut of the girls arguing next to the brick wall and walking <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> to find the vast Khodynka Field with a clearer cityscape in the distance by the fourth minute. The ending of the video portrays t.A.T.u. in the distance, similar to the original video.|$|E
5|$|Anjaana Anjaani {{film was}} {{initially}} slated to release on 24 September 2010. It was postponed by one week, {{just four days}} before the expected date because this would coincide with the controversial Ayodhya dispute verdict, which many anticipated would be disputed and cause chaos in the country. Trade experts were against postponing the film, and questioned Nadiadwala's decision, as the government had already taken precautionary measures with the Commonwealth Games <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner.</b> They also felt that the postponement would send mixed signals and confuse viewers as the promotional campaign centred around the 25 September release. Additionally, the film would lose the advantage of being the only new release. Changing the release date would mean Anjaana Anjaani would clash with the science fiction film Enthiran, which might affect the film's box-office performance. Still, the film was postponed to 1 October 2010. Later, the Ayodhya verdict was itself postponed to three days before the film's new release date. Industry insiders started speculating again about the film's release being postponed by another week, causing rumours to spread in the media. However, Sajid Nadiadwla confirmed that the news was false and the film was releasing on 1 October 2010.|$|E
