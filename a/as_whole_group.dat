40|$|In this {{qualitative}} study, {{the phenomenon}} of large class teaching in South African secondary schools is investigated. It was concluded that since large classes will be {{a feature of the}} South African teaching context {{for many years to come}} due to financial constraints, educators and educational planners should explore and implement coping strategies instead of becoming demoralised by the situation. The study provides several instructional guidelines for implementation in large classes in the South African context. The focus of these guidelines is on large class management and effective teaching in large classes. The possibilities of strategies such <b>as</b> <b>whole</b> <b>group</b> instruction, cooperative learning, peer teaching, groupwork and the proper organisation of classroom space are investigated.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between levels of group cohesion, defined <b>as</b> <b>whole</b> <b>group</b> relationships, and between-session therapeutic homework adherence in a multi-family group therapy (MFGT) for people with schizophrenia. Participants from 18 consenting families attending MFGT groups completed weekly homework adherence ratings, group cohesion and spontaneous between-session activity measures. Levels of group cohesion at each session were compared with measures of scheduled and spontaneous homework adherence reported at the next session. It was hypothesised that higher levels of group cohesion would be related to homework adherence and other spontaneous between-session therapeutic activity completed by group members. Results show higher levels of group cohesion were associated with higher rates of spontaneous between-session therapeutic activity. However, contrary to expectations no significant relationship between cohesion and scheduled homework completion was found. The implications of the findings for group processes and homework adherence are discussed...|$|E
40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the contribution of}} research undertaken {{as part of the}} IEA studies to Australian education, and in particular to educational theory, practice, policy making and the conduct of research. While there have been criticisms of the tests employed and constraints have been imposed on publication, the research carried out has gone well beyond the monitoring of student performance and has made a substantial contribution to Australian education over a period of 30 years. Areas where policy making has been influenced include retention rates, social class differences, gender differences, time and school learning, and curriculum differences between the Australian states. In addition, IEA research has contributed to the improvement of educational practice by showing the significance of student attitudes and values, an emphasis on process, opportunity to learn, time spent on homework, and class size as well <b>as</b> <b>whole</b> <b>group</b> instruction. Neville Postlethwaite's marked influence on this work is acknowledged. ...|$|E

The purpose of this quantitative causal-comparative study was to test the theory of students 2 ̆ 7 performances based on their educational environment by comparing students who received instruction in a single gender classroom in a public middle school compared to students who received instruction in a mixed gender classroom in a public middle school. The achievement test, Georgia Criterion Referenced Competency Test, was used with each site school. There were two years of data collected with the standardized test and was utilized as a pretest and posttest in all subtests areas. The data were compared <b>as</b> <b>whole</b> <b>group,</b> females to females, and males to males.

40|$|PRF {{deficiency}} occurs {{not only}} with allelic variants characterized by mutations in the coding region of the gene. McIlroy et al. reported that the occurrence of a C/T polymorphism at position- 398 of the proximal promoter region of the PRF 1 gene was associated with decreased quantities of PRF in CTLs in HIV infected patients. A decrease of about 50 % of control PRF levels was observed in heterozygous patients but no patients homozygous for- 398 T/T mutations were studied. (5) In {{this issue of the}} Revista Brasileira de Hematologia e Hemoterapia, Garcia et al. (6) present an analysis of the frequency of the C 398 T polymorphism in a cohort of 62 patients with hematological cancers that had no allelic disequilibrium when compared to control populations matched by inferred ascendency. However, they describe an excess of the C 398 T polymorphism in the patients taken <b>as</b> <b>whole</b> <b>group</b> compared with the controls. This discrepancy could be attributed to the small number of patients studied or to the criteria used to define the control population. It is worth mentioning that all patients, except for one, were heterozygous (C 398 T). The only homozygous patient has myelodysplastic syndrome, but unfortunately the corresponding clinical and epidemiological data {{were not included in the}} paper. Overall, the paper raises a number of important questions related to the role of PRF in hematological cancer and some points should be addressed in future studies: 1. Is the level of PRF reduced in the cancer patients studied as observed in HIV infected patients? 2. Is the CTL response of the lymphocytes of patients with the allelic variants normal when compared to patients with wild type and normal individuals? 3. What is the prevalence of the coding allelic variants in this group of patients? To clarify these important points it is necessary to increase the population enrolled and perform the entire PRF 1 gene sequencing of patients and matched controls. A multicenter study would be welcome...|$|E

40|$|This work {{statistically}} analyses {{hypotheses about}} the presence of antisocial punishment in study of economic experiments. Analysed data source is author's own ABM simulation of antisocial punishment environment. Tested hypotheses and ABM simulations are evolutionary oriented. This represents natural selection of evolving agents (and their groups) interacting with one another. Work is divided by two independent parts of presumptions. Crucial hypothesis of the first part is evolutional advantage from retaliatory punishment, the second part tests hypotheses of evolutional benefits resulting from group selection. Findings of the analysis allow us to accept these crucial hypothesis, and it may be concluded, that antisocial punishment can be regard as an evolutionary advantage, which directly advantages individuals, <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>whole</b> <b>groups...</b>|$|R

40|$|When {{creating}} {{a platform for}} distance learning considerable efforts are required for formation and keeping up to date user accounts, as their numbers in higher education are measured in thousands. This work can be significantly sped up if the accounts do not create "from scratch", but import data on students from another database.
