By the middle of the decade several local clubs, including Sheffield and Hallam F.C., were in financial trouble.|$|E

5|$|The years {{following}} World War I were severely testing {{for the owners}} of many great estates. The staff both indoor and outdoor, which had previously been plentiful, essential, and cheap, were now in short supply. Millions of men had left private service to join the army, and very few returned. Female domestic staff had been called up for war service in factories, and now realised there was an easier and better paid existence outside of {{the gates of the}} great country houses. With both fortunes and staff depleted many owners of country houses now fought <b>a</b> <b>losing</b> <b>battle</b> to retain them.|$|E
5|$|Ternent allowed Swan {{to play on}} a month-to-month {{contract}} for the 1999–2000 season. Swan rushed his nine-month recovery period down to seven months and was playing and living on painkillers. He secretly used suppositories to stop himself from passing blood after his stomach began rejecting the painkillers. Fighting <b>a</b> <b>losing</b> <b>battle</b> against injuries, in March 2000 Ternent allowed {{him to leave the}} club. Before he took the decision, Swan and Ronnie Jepson began to polish the boots of legendary new signing Ian Wright – {{just to be able to}} say they had done so. Five days after leaving Burnley he went to York City in the fourth tier. This reunited him with former manager Terry Dolan, who offered him a contract until the end of the season.|$|E
5|$|Döblin's 1918 comic novel {{has been}} seen, in its {{experimental}} narrative technique, {{its refusal to}} psychologize its characters, and its depictions of Berlin as modern metropolis, as a precursor to Döblin's better-known Berlin Alexanderplatz. Wadzeks Kampf mit der Dampfturbine (Wadzek's Battle with the Steam Turbine) {{tells the story of}} Wadzek, a factory owner locked in <b>a</b> <b>losing</b> <b>battle</b> with a more powerful competitor. His futile and increasingly delusional countermeasures culminate in the fortification and quixotic defense of his family's garden house in suburban Reinickendorf. Following the dissipation of this endeavor, he suffers a breakdown and finally flees the country, eloping aboard a steamship bound for America that is powered by the steam turbines of his victorious competitor. Döblin wrote the novel in the fall of 1914, submitting it to extensive stylistic revisions while serving as a doctor on the Western front; it was published in May 1918 by the Fischer Verlag. In its stringent refusal of a tragic tone, the book earned the praise of a young Bertolt Brecht.|$|E

5|$|In 1084, Guiscard {{returned}} to the Balkans and planned a new offensive against Corfu, where a combined Greek-Venetian fleet, commanded by Selvo, awaited his arrival. When the Normans approached the island, the combined fleets dealt Guiscard an even greater defeat than he had received in the naval battle at Durazzo. Guiscard ordered another attack three days later, but the results were still more disastrous for the Normans. Selvo was completely convinced of his fleet's victory and sent all damaged ships north to Venice for repairs, to free them for other uses, and to report of their victory. The Doge then retired with the remaining ships to the Albanian coast to await {{the departure of the}} Normans. Acting on the Doge's belief that a third attack would be unlikely and that the presence of a slightly depleted Venetian fleet meant greater odds for victory, Guiscard summoned every floating vessel he could find and led the Normans into a surprise attack. His strategy, though perhaps risky, was ultimately well-calculated as it caused mass confusion among the Venetians, who were overwhelmed on all flanks, while the Greeks fled what they assumed to be <b>a</b> <b>losing</b> <b>battle.</b> Selvo barely managed to retreat with the remainder of his fleet, but not before 3,000 Venetians died and another 2,500 were taken prisoner. The Venetians also lost 9 great galleys, the largest and most heavily armed ships in their war fleet.|$|E

O'Connor's {{presidency}} spanned {{twelve of the}} ILA's most intriguing and influential years. In 1909, a bitter three-year strike on the Great Lakes pitted the employers' Lake Carriers' Association against every maritime union except the ILA, whose locals wisely voted against participation because {{it was clear to}} them from the beginning that the strike was <b>a</b> <b>losing</b> <b>battle.</b> So powerful and well equipped was the Lake Carriers' Association that Lakes shipping ran almost regularly despite the union walk out. In the end, the ILA was almost alone on the Lakes.|$|E

25|$|His {{conflicts}} with actors and managers resulted in his sacking from Iași National Theater, {{and then his}} banishment from the National Theater Bucharest, leaving him to seek work with private companies. In the early 1910s, he also collected his prose poems, also producing memoirs and essays that outlined his ideas on society, and Christian drama. His contribution to screenwriting, albeit pioneering, was shaded by revelations of plagiarism from Caragiale. By then {{a veteran of the}} Second Balkan War, he fought on the Romanian front of World War I, and died soon after this ended, following <b>a</b> <b>losing</b> <b>battle</b> with paralysis. He had been largely forgotten as a writer, and was being derided by modernists, even though his plays continued to be performed into the 1930s.|$|E
25|$|Madison, {{the lead}} {{supporter}} of the Constitution, was inhibited in replying to Henry's criticisms, since he was ill {{through most of the}} convention. Henry likely realized he was fighting <b>a</b> <b>losing</b> <b>battle</b> as sentiment in the convention moved towards ratification, but continued to speak at length and his speeches fill nearly one-quarter of the pages of the Richmond convention's debates. Governor Randolph, who had become a supporter of ratification, suggested that if the convention allowed Henry to continue arguing, it would last six months rather than six weeks. Henry was somewhat mollified, after the convention voted on June 21 to ratify the Constitution, {{by the fact that the}} convention then proposed about 40 amendments; some of them were later incorporated in the Bill of Rights. George Mason, Henry's ally in opposing ratification, intended a fiery diatribe on the faults of the new plan of government; he was talked out of it. By one account, Henry told other opponents that he had done his duty in opposing ratifications, and as republicans, with the issues settled in a democratic way, they had best all go home. Madison wrote to Washington that Henry still hoped for amendments to weaken the power of the federal government, possibly to be proposed by a second national convention.|$|E
