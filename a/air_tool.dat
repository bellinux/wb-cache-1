50|$|It is {{important}} to know some general specification technical terms used in pneumatic tools while it is also related to how to choose a good air compressor and if the tool can meet your job requirement so that an <b>air</b> <b>tool</b> can be used properly, respectively, Free Speed (rpm), Air Pressure(psi/bar), Air Consumption(cfm/scfm or m3/min), Horse Power(hp), spindle size...etc. Depending on different type of pneumatic tools, there are different specification values that you need to pay attention to.|$|E
5000|$|A {{pneumatic}} tool, <b>air</b> <b>tool,</b> air-powered tool or pneumatic-powered tool {{is a type}} {{of power}} tool, driven by compressed air, supplied by an air compressor. Pneumatic tools can also be driven by compressed carbon dioxide (...) stored in small cylinders allowing for portability. Pneumatic tools are safer to run and maintain than their electric power tool equivalents, and have a higher power-to-weight ratio, allowing a smaller, lighter tool to accomplish the same task. General grade pneumatic tools with short life span are commonly cheaper and are also called disposable tools in tooling industries while industrial grade pneumatic tools with long life span are more expensive. In general, pneumatic tools are cheaper than the equivalent electric-powered tools.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{fundamental}} part {{of university}} education creates {{a connection between}} the theoretical or simulation approaches of experimental methods for verifying the coincidence of laboratory stands. An illustration of practical physical model properties is of cardinal importance for experimental engineering exercises, for comparing computer simulation tasks with practical experience and with real-time measured signals from technological aggregates. This paper deals with the important role laboratory experimental stands play with microcomputers for quality control engineering education and the design and verification of new control algorithms. At the Department of CSI VŠB-TU FME Ostrava a HAA 2005 model (Hot-Air Aggregate) of climate unit with two controlled variables (temperature, air flow) was designed and produced. The HAA model, as an <b>air</b> <b>tool</b> (air-conditioning), is a dynamic system with multiple inputs and outputs. Experimental laboratory models allow us to easily understand the principles of the aggregate parts, measurement and control devices, signal character, noise, dynamic responses and to cross over easier to real technological systems.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionA {{pneumatic}} tool or <b>air</b> <b>tool</b> such as blow gun dust cleaner {{is a tool}} driven by compressed air and spraying of the perineum can insufflate the colon due to its high pressure and high flow rate. Presentation of caseWe present a case of 4 year old boy who developed sudden onset of tense abdominal distention and developed peritonitis. Patient’s family initially denied a history of trauma. Radiologic examination showed pneumoperitoneum and colon dilatation. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a tension pneumoperitoneum, bloody ascitic fluid, multiple site of ecchymosis and serosal tear of the colon and a minute perforation of transverse colon. Postoperative reinvestigation revealed that the patient’s perineum was sprayed, using blow gun dust cleaner. DiscussionAir from {{pneumatic tool}}s produces column of air at pressure of 3. 5 – 8. 8 kg/cm 2 and pressure greater than the resting anal pressure of 0. 109 kg/cm 2 force air to enter the colon when the perineum is sprayed. Different degree of colon injury results when airflow is greater than 1. 46 L/m, and/or intraluminal pressure greater than 0. 109 kg/cm 2. In most children, initial anxiety {{to tell the truth}} result in difficulty to obtain good history. ConclusionSpraying of the perianal with excessive pneumatic force of greater than the resting anal pressure and high air flow rate causes multiple site colon injury and tension pneumoperitoneum due to colon perforation. Parent should be caution in children playing with high pressure pneumatic tool, and the importance of history is emphases for early correct diagnosis...|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} a report on a {{research}} project funded by the Knowledge Transfer Partnership. This research was a joint project with NHS Fife. The accelerated long-stay Learning Disability Hospital closure programme in Scotland throughout the late 1990 s and from 2000 onwards, resulted in the movement of residents both within and out-with these Hospitals to either community based housing models or to community based In-patient services. The legacy and impact of this residential service re-provision was that individuals experienced changes in those they lived with, and those who supported them. This process took place against the back-drop and dynamic of associated changes in environmental, procedural, situational and interpersonal risk. It was {{in recognition of the}} challenge that this change programme presented to care services in terms of defensible risk assessment and management that the Assessment of Interpersonal Risk tool was developed. A new risk assessment tool, Assessment of Interpersonal Risk (AIR), was piloted and evaluated to measure risk factors and compatibility between individuals living in an assessment and treatment unit in one NHS area. The adults with learning disabilities in this unit had severe and enduring mental health problems and/or behaviour that is severely challenging. The aims of this small-scale research project were to estimate the reciprocal risk to and from each individual across five main risk domains and to enhance professional judgement to make defensible decisions about interpersonal risk. Data were recorded on incidents involving five individuals over a period of 6 months. Individual Rating Profiles were incorporated into existing Individual Risk Management Plans, together with interpersonal profiles, recording risk evaluations between named individuals across the five risk domains. Results showed that the <b>AIR</b> <b>tool</b> may be a useful addition to existing effective risk management, to inform assessments and future discharge planning. PreprintPeer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} evaluation of noise in hand-held pneumatic tools (Rock drills) used in Lashotor stone mines in Isfahan by the method of PNEUROP CAGI TEST CODE specifies the procedures which can be applied to certain items of construction equipment. Extremely loud noise damages hearing. In rare cases, the damage is momentary and caused by shock waves from, for instance, an explosion [1]. Damage to hearing normally occurs after many years of exposure to loud noise. Such damage is not sudden and total, but a gradual deterioration of the hearing which is most pronounced around the frequency of 4000 Hz [2]. Compressed air driven hand-tools are often used as examples of noisy machines. This is not surprising considering that <b>air</b> <b>tools</b> are extremely common and many old, compressed <b>air</b> <b>tools</b> are noisy [3]. This method is designed to evaluate noise and vibration propagated by the hand-held pneumatic tools [4]. Rock drill is one of the four product categories specially identified as a major source noise and vibration in the federal noise control Act of 1972 [5]. There are three different types of noise sources including: 1. Process noise, produced by contact between the machine and a surface, 2. Exhaust air noise, partly caused by the flow variation as the compressed air passes the motor, partly by the aerodynamic sound generated in the exhaust air channel, and 3. Vibration radiated noise, {{from the surface of the}} machine produced by the moving parts of machine and the flow of air inside the machine [6, 7]. In this study the rock drill produced noise in above specify test method, its control procedures are also recommended. 2. METHO...|$|R
