Falconeri and Hodgsoni, then through Abies Brunoniana, with yew (now covered with red berries) to the region of Magnolias and Rhod. arboreum and barbatum. One bush of the former was in flower, making a {{gorgeous}} show. Here also appeared the great oak with lamellated acorns, which I had not seen in the drier valleys to the westward; with many other Dorjiling trees and shrubs. A heavy mist clung to the rank luxuriant foliage, tantalizing from its obscuring all the view. Mica schist replaced the gneiss, and a thick slippery stratum of clay rendered {{it very difficult to}} keep one's footing. After so many days of bright sunshine and dry weather, I found this quiet, damp, foggy atmosphere to have a most depressing effect: there was little to interest in the meteorology, the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>fluctuations</b> being far too small; geographical discovery was at an end, and we groped our way along devious paths in wooded valleys, or ascended spurs and ridges, always clouded before noon, and clothed with heavy forest.|$|E

40|$|Theoretical {{understanding}} of the generation and growth of wind driven surface water waves {{has been based on}} two distinct mechanisms; the first being stochastic excitation by wave incoherent random <b>atmospheric</b> pressure <b>fluctuations</b> unrelated to wave amplitude (Eckart 1953; Phillips 1957) and the second instability arising from wave induced coherent <b>atmospheric</b> pressure <b>fluctuations</b> proportional to wave amplitude (Helmholtz 1868; Kelvin 1871; Jeffreys 1925; Miles 1957). Incoherent wave independent forcing produces growth of surface height variance linear in time while coherent forcing proportional to wave amplitude produces exponential growth. While observed wave developments can be fit to these forms, and despite broad agreement on the underlying physical process of momentum transfer from the atmospheric boundary layer shear flow to the water waves by <b>atmospheric</b> pressure <b>fluctuations,</b> quantitative agreement between theory and field observations of wave growth has proved elusive. Accepting that the dominant contribution to wave growth results from an at least statistical proportionality and coherency in phase lag between <b>atmospheric</b> pressure <b>fluctuations</b> and surface elevation, at issue is the mechanism by which this relationship is produced and maintained.

40|$|Theoretical {{understanding}} {{of the growth of}} wind-driven surface water waves has been based on two distinct mechanisms: growth due to random <b>atmospheric</b> pressure <b>fluctuations</b> unrelated to wave amplitude and growth due to wave coherent <b>atmospheric</b> pressure <b>fluctuations</b> proportional to wave amplitude.

At greater than 1 h time scales, the WVR indicated fluctuation levels are in closer agreement with the model, although noise floor limitations may be artificially raising the average WVR-derived <b>atmospheric</b> <b>fluctuation</b> levels at the longer time scales. When scaled to two-way Doppler tracking at 20 deg elevation, as will occur for the GWE, these results indicate that Goldstone winter tropospheric delay fluctuations will typically be a factor of 10 larger than the GWE requirements at 1000 s and a factor of 4 larger at 10, 000 s...|$|R
