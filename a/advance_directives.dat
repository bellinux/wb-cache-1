2500|$|The {{principle}} of autonomy views the rights of an individual to self-determination. This is rooted in society's respect for individuals' ability {{to make informed decisions}} about personal matters. Autonomy has become more important as social values have shifted to define medical quality in terms of outcomes that are important to the patient rather than medical professionals. The increasing importance of autonomy can [...] be seen as a social reaction to a [...] "paternalistic" [...] tradition within healthcare. Some have questioned whether the backlash against historically excessive paternalism in favor of patient autonomy has inhibited the proper use of soft paternalism to the detriment of outcomes for some patients. Respect for autonomy is the basis for informed consent and <b>advance</b> <b>directives.</b>|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 39 - 44). Due to {{the changing}} demographics, increased attention {{has been focused on}} US ethnic minority groups' knowledge about and attitudes toward advance care planning. Research shows that ethnic minority groups are less likely to participate in advance care planning or to complete an <b>advance</b> <b>directive.</b> Increasingly rapid growth in the number and proportion of minority elders has brought more awareness to the racial and ethnic disparities in advance care planning. The United States Congress passed the Patient Self-Determination Act (PSDA) with the purpose of ensuring that individuals' rights to self-determination in health care decisions were communicated and protected with the use of an <b>advance</b> <b>directive.</b> The present study assesses the sociodemographic characteristics of home health and hospice patients in the 2007 National Home Health and Hospice Care Survey and examines the association between predisposing, enabling, and need factors in <b>advance</b> <b>directive</b> completions among home health and hospice patients. The present study utilized Andersen's behavioral model of health service utilization as the theoretical base. It is designed as an analysis of secondary cross-sectional data. Results reveal that patients who were non-minority, male, widowed, enrolled in Medicare or Medicaid, had a primary caregiver, were in a comatose state, had mental impairment, and needed help with eating or feeding were most likely to complete an <b>advance</b> <b>directive.</b> Notably after controlling for predisposing, enabling, and need factors race was significantly associated with <b>advance</b> <b>directive</b> completion. In addition, non-minorities have more positive significant contributing factors linked to the completion of an <b>advance</b> <b>directive</b> than minorities. Furthering our understanding of <b>advance</b> <b>directive</b> completion among minorities will allow for culturally competent modalities to address end-of-life care needs. A collaborative structured and facilitated method can lead to culturally relevant coordination in end-of-life care through the use of an <b>advance</b> <b>directive.</b> Further research should utilize an experimental design, expand on predisposing factors, include a larger minority sample, and include a broader sample of older adults...|$|R
2500|$|The page 425 {{legislation}} {{began as}} a separate bill that was co-sponsored by Republicans Charles Boustany, Patrick Tiberi and Geoff Davis. Boustany, a heart surgeon, said the end-of-life legislation was a [...] "good medical practice". 204 GOP House members and 42 GOP Senators voted for a 2003 Medicare prescription drug bill that included end-of-life counseling. The 2003 legislation only covered end-of-life counseling for terminally ill patients, which the Republican Charles Grassley supported. Grassley said that the 2009 end-of-life counseling would [...] "pull the plug on grandma" [...] and that [...] "You shouldn't have counseling {{at the end of}} life, you should have done that 20 years before," [...] which is what the 2009 legislation would allow.

In 2008, Palin said she was considering incentives for employers to provide health insurance.

In a Wall Street Journal editorial, Palin argued {{in favor of a}} free-market approach to health care including deregulation, tort reform and [...] "providing Medicare recipients with vouchers that allow them to purchase their own coverage." [...] Palin's Healthcare Decisions Day proclamation in April 2008 stated that it was [...] "designed to raise public awareness of the need to plan ahead for healthcare decisions, related to end of life care and medical decision-making whenever patients are unable to speak for themselves and to encourage the specific use of <b>advance</b> <b>directives</b> to communicate these important healthcare decisions." ...|$|E
2500|$|Palin's death panel {{remarks were}} based on the ideas of Betsy McCaughey. [...] During 2009, former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin wrote against alleged rationing, {{referring}} to what by her interpretation was a [...] "downright evil" [...] "death panel" [...] in current reform legislation known as H.R. 3200 Section 1233. [...] However, Palin supported similar end of life discussion and <b>advance</b> <b>directives</b> for patients in 2008. Defenders of the plan indicated that the proposed legislation H.R. 3200 would allow Medicare {{for the first time to}} cover patient-doctor consultations about end-of-life planning, including discussions about drawing up a living will or planning hospice treatment. Patients could seek out such advice on their own, but would not be required to. The provision would limit Medicare coverage to one consultation every five years. Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., who sponsored the H.R. 3200 end of life counseling provision, said the measure would block funds for counseling that presents suicide or assisted suicide as an option, and called references to death panels or euthanasia [...] "mind-numbing". Republican Senator Johnny Isakson, who co-sponsored a 2007 end-of-life counseling provision, called the euthanasia claim [...] "nuts". Analysts who examined the end-of-life provision Palin cited agree that Palin's claim is incorrect. According to TIME and ABC, Palin and Betsy McCaughey made false euthanasia claims.|$|E

However, many adults in the United States (US) lack {{the skills necessary to}} read and comprehend health care-related materials. In this study, we sought to determine the readability of state government-sponsored <b>advance</b> <b>directive</b> forms. Methods A cross sectional study design was used. The readability of <b>advance</b> <b>directive</b> forms available online from all 50 US states and the District of Columbia was determined using 6 validated readability scales. Results Overall, 62 <b>advance</b> <b>directive</b> forms were obtained. For 47 states, forms were available by way of government-sponsored Web sites. The average (SD) readability (with the Flesch-Kincaid score) of all forms was grade level 11. 9 (2. 6). Similar results were obtained with the other readability scales. No form had a readability score at the 5 th grade level or lower, the level recommended by the National Work Group on Literacy and Health. The readability of the forms exceeded this level by an average of 6. 9 grade levels (95 % confidence interval, 6. 3 - 7. 6; P P Conclusions The readability of US state government-sponsored <b>advance</b> <b>directive</b> forms exceeds the readability level recommended by the National Work Group on Literacy and Health and the average reading skill level of most US adults.

50|$|An <b>advance</b> {{healthcare}} <b>directive,</b> {{also known}} as living will, personal <b>directive,</b> <b>advance</b> <b>directive,</b> medical <b>directive</b> or <b>advance</b> decision, is a legal document {{in which a person}} specifies what actions should be taken for their health if they are no longer able to make decisions for themselves because of illness or incapacity.

50|$|Legislation {{providing}} for counseling patients on <b>advance</b> <b>directives,</b> living wills and end-of-life care {{had been on}} the books for years, however, the laws did not provide for physicians to be reimbursed for giving such counseling during routine physical exams of the elderly. The Patient Self-Determination Act (1991) requires health care providers, including hospitals, hospices and nursing homes to provide information about <b>advance</b> <b>directives</b> to admitted patients.

40|$|Objectives - This thesis proposes the question, <b>Advance</b> Healthcare <b>Directives</b> – Friend or Foe? Is it a {{good thing}} or {{a bad thing to}} have an <b>advance</b> {{healthcare}} <b>directive?</b> Ethical and legal considerations - I introduce the concept of an <b>advance</b> healthcare <b>directive</b> and why they developed. They started in the US where they are called ‘living wills’. They aim to promote patient autonomy and self determination in advance of the loss of capacity. Ethical arguments about making decisions for a ‘future self’ have been balanced with legal arguments for PVS patients being allowed to die by refusing treatments. I have shown that there may be many obstacles and barriers to the implementation of <b>advance</b> healthcare <b>directives.</b> By using the internet with websites to provide information and guidance in preparing an <b>advance</b> healthcare <b>directive,</b> {{more and more people are}} becoming aware of them. New procedures, guidelines and laws have allowed more protection for vulnerable patients while at the same time promoting <b>advance</b> healthcare <b>directives</b> as a means of extending patient autonomy into the future. Conclusion – Many of the initial problems of <b>advanced</b> care <b>directives</b> have been recognised and addressed in various guides and laws from the US and UK. Here in Ireland we still lag behind in the distribution of information and raising public awareness around the whole topic of death and dying but especially in this aspect of preparing an <b>advance</b> healthcare <b>directive.</b> Legally binding instruments may make preparing an <b>advance</b> healthcare <b>directive</b> more cumbersome but they allow for greater certainty that the <b>advance</b> healthcare <b>directive</b> will be judged valid and applicable and thus implementing the patients’ decisions. I conclude that <b>advance</b> healthcare <b>directives</b> are our friends, though as in any good relationship, it may be a bit complex at times but it is worth the effort...|$|R

The authors present and discuss the results of their research that analysed the attitude of Romanians toward the use of the <b>advance</b> <b>directive</b> to identify the usefulness of implementing such a document in the Romanian social cultural context. The target group in this research is general population over 18 years old, speaking Romanian and without psychological illnesses. The representative random sample lot included 828 persons from Iasi County. The data were recorded based on a transversal descriptive study, using the method of questionnaire enquiryThe persons participating in the study admitted the importance of respecting the patient’s dignity and autonomy with reference to decisions concerning the treatment at the end of life. For the subjects agreeing with legalizing the <b>advance</b> <b>directive,</b> the main advantages of such a document are firstly the respect of the patient’s right to decide and secondly the improvement of the medical treatment.
