40|$|The {{relative}} efficiency (RE) of N 2 fixation (RE = 1 - [H 2 evolved in air]/[acetylene reduced]) {{was investigated in}} a Rhizobium strain lacking uptake hydrogenase activity (Hup−). Variation in RE of such strains presumably reflects changes in the electron <b>allocation</b> <b>coefficient</b> of nitrogenase. By artificially extending the normal dark period of 24 -day-old Pisum sativum L. cv `Alaska' inoculated with the Hup−R. leguminosarum strain 3740, reproducible changes in RE were obtained. The RE showed no change during a normal 8 -hour night, but {{a significant increase in}} RE was measured after 20 hours in the dark. Upon returning to the normal 550 microEinsteins per square meter per second light treatment, RE declined to previous levels within 2 hours. If, after the 20 -hour dark treatment, plants were returned to 90 or 190 microEinsteins per square meter per second or maintained in the dark, RE did not decline significantly. The RE varied inversely with changes in soluble sugar content of root nodules. A similar pattern of changes in RE during an extended dark period and subsequent light treatment was measured in 28 -day-old Alaska peas and in the Hup−R. trifolii strain 162 X 99 in symbiosis with Trifolium subterraneum L. cv `Woogenellup.

40|$|AbstractHydroelectric {{power is}} an {{important}} energy source to meet the growing demand for energy, and large amounts of water are consumed to generate this energy. Previous studies often assumed that the water footprint of hydroelectric power equaled the reservoir’s water footprint, but failed to allocate the reservoir water footprint among the many beneficiaries; dealing with this allocation remains a challenge. In this study, we developed {{a new approach to}} quantify the water footprint of hydroelectric power (WFh) by separating it from the reservoir water footprint (WF) using an <b>allocation</b> <b>coefficient</b> (ηh) based on the ratio of the benefits from hydroelectric power to the total ecosystem service benefits. We used this approach in a case study of the Three Gorges Reservoir, the world’s largest reservoir, which provides multiple ecosystem services. We found large differences between the WFh and the water footprint of per unit of hydroelectric production (PWFh) calculated using ηh and those calculated without this factor. From 2003 to 2012, ηh decreased sharply (from 0. 76 in 2005 to 0. 41 in 2012), which was {{due to the fact that}} large increases in the value of non-energy ecosystem services, and particularly flood control. In 2009, flood control replaced hydroelectricity as the largest ecosystem service of water from the Three Gorges Reservoir. Using our approach, WFh and PWFh averaged 331. 0 × 106 m 3 and 1. 5 m 3 GJ− 1, respectively. However, these values would almost double without allocating water footprints among different reservoir ecosystem services. Thus, previous studies have overestimated the WFh and PWFh of reservoirs, especially for reservoirs that serve multiple purposes. Thus, the <b>allocation</b> <b>coefficient</b> should not be ignored when calculating the WF of a product or service...|$|E

Several process-based carbon allocation models have been developed and incorporated into ecosystem models; however, these models have used arbitrary model parameters and have never been sufficiently validated on a global scale. This study uses the Integrated Biosphere Simulator (IBIS) model as a platform to integrate a carbon allocation model (resource availability model) with satellite-derived leaf area index (LAI) dataset, which allows us to inversely predict the allocation parameters for five deciduous vegetation types.

In the conventional technique, the relay always decodes the received signal and re-sends {{it to the}} destination. In the destination, the two copies of the signal will be combining in MRC manner.

In order to characterize the performance, we derive the Laplace transform of the interference at the probe D 2 D receiver and obtain a closed-form expression of its outage probability using stochastic geometry tools.

40|$|The {{fundamental}} power allocation requirements for NOMA systems with minimum {{quality of service}} (QoS) requirements are investigated. For any minimum QoS rate $R_ 0 $, the limits on the power allocation coefficients for each user are derived, such that any power <b>allocation</b> <b>coefficient</b> outside of these limits creates an outage with probability equal to 1. The power allocation coefficients that facilitate each user's success of performing successive interference cancellation (SIC) and decoding its own signal are derived, and are found to depend only on the target rate $R_ 0 $ {{and the number of}} total users $K$. It is then proven that using these power allocation coefficients create the same outage event as if using orthogonal multiple access (OMA), which proves that the outage performance of NOMA with a fixed-power scheme can matched that of OMA for all users simultaneously.

40|$|Importance of precise {{estimation}} for {{tree biomass}} in forests has been continuously increasing. Regarding to the climate change, scientists {{have started to}} quantify all tree components {{not only in terms}} of energetic utilization but also for carbon stock estimation. Increasing relevance of biomass models for young trees relates to expanding area of young forest stands during the last period due to decay of old forests often caused by disturbances (especially: windstorms, outbreaks of bark beetles, drought episodes, and forest fires). Models for biomass stock estimations constructed for stands with age to 10 years are rare and usually are focused on aboveground tree parts. Thus, this work aims at filling knowledge gaps in this field. Its main objectives are: 1) 	construction of regression models applicable for estimation of dry mass in the particular tree components (i. e. stem, branches, foliage, roots) for young stands of some broadleaved species, 2) 	implementation of regression models for calculation of biomass conversion and expansion factors (BCEF), <b>allocation</b> <b>coefficient,</b> growth efficiency and leaf area index (LAI) and their inter-specific comparison, 3) 	utilisation of allometric relations for estimation on forage potential for ruminating ungulate game (i. e. browsing and stripping).

Accurate simulation of winter wheat growth is not only crucial for future yield prediction under a changing climate, but also for accurately predicting the energy and water cycles for winter wheat dominated regions. We modified the winter wheat model in the Community Land Model (CLM) to better simulate winter wheat leaf area index, latent heat flux, net ecosystem exchange of CO 2, and grain yield.

40|$|PREMISE OF THE STUDY: In fire-prone ecosystems, {{variation}} in bark thickness among species and communities has been explained by fire frequency; thick bark {{is necessary to}} protect cambium from lethal temperatures. Elsewhere this investment is deemed unnecessary, and thin bark is thought to prevail. However, in rain forest ecosystems where fire is rare, bark thickness varies widely among species and communities, and the causes of this variation remain enigmatic. We tested for functional explanations of bark thickness {{variation in}} temperate rain forest species and communities. METHODS: We measured bark thickness in 82 tree species throughout New Zealand temperate rain forests that historically have experienced little fire and applied two complementary analyses. First, we examined correlations between bark traits and leaf habit, and leaf and stem traits. Second, we calculated community-weighted mean (CWM) bark thickness for 272 plots distributed throughout New Zealand to identify the environments in which thicker-barked communities occur. KEY RESULTS: Conifers had higher size-independent bark thickness than evergreen angiosperms. Species with thicker bark or higher bark <b>allocation</b> <b>coefficients</b> were not associated with “slow economic” plant traits. Across 272 forest plots, communities with thicker bark occurred on infertile soils, and communities with thicker bark and higher bark <b>allocation</b> <b>coefficients</b> occurred in cooler, drier climates.

However, comprehensive information on the relative role of the main functional processes controlling the response of net primary production (NPP) to grazing is still lacking. In this study, a modelling approach was used to quantify the relative importance of key functional processes in the response of annual canopy NPP to grazing for a West African humid grassland. The PEPSEE-grass model, which represents radiation absorption, NPP, water balance and carbon allocation, was used to compute total and aboveground NPP in response to grazing pressure. Representations of grazing and mineral nitrogen input to the canopy were simplified to focus on the vegetation processes implemented and their relative importance. Simulations were performed using a constant or resource-driven root/shoot <b>allocation</b> <b>coefficient,</b> and dependence or independence of conversion efficiency of absorbed light into dry matter on nitrogen availability. There were three main results. Firstly, the response of NPP to grazing intensity emerged as a complex result of both positive and negative, and direct and indirect effects of biomass removal on light absorption efficiency, soil water availability, grass nitrogen status and productivity, and root/shoot allocation pattern. Secondly, overcompensation was observed for aboveground NPP when assuming a nitrogen-dependent conversion efficiency and a resource-driven root/shoot allocation. Thirdly, the response of NPP to grazing was mainly controlled by the effect of plant nitrogen status on conversion efficiency and by the root/shoot allocation pattern, while the effects of improved water status and reduced light absorption were secondary...|$|E

The results showed that the synergistic effect increases the input intensity of one party’s resource transfer into the increase of marginal utility of the other party, thus the owner and contractor are willing to enhance their levels of effort. One party’s optimal benefit <b>allocation</b> <b>coefficient</b> is positively affected by its own output efficiency, and negatively affected by the other party’s output efficiency.

Previous studies have proposed that EAC is regulated by the competitive inhibition of H 2 on N 2 fixation and {{that the degree of}} H 2 inhibition can be affected by a nodule's permeability to gas diffusion. To test this hypothesis, EAC was measured in soybean (Glycine max L.

Moloney and D. B. Layzell [1993] Plant Physiol 103 : 421 - 428). The empirical data clearly showed that decreases in EAC were associated with increases in external pH 2, decreases in external pN 2, and decreases in nodule permeability to O 2 diffusion. The model predicted similar trends in EAC, and the small deviations that occurred between measured and predicted values could be readily accounted for by altering {{one or more of the}} following model assumptions: K 1 (H 2) of nitrogenase (range from 2 - 4 % H 2), Km(N 2) of nitrogenase (range from 4 - 5 % N 2), the allocation of less than 100 % of whole-nodule respiration to tissues within the diffusion barrier, and the presence of a diffusion pathway that is open pore versus closed pore. The differences in the open-pore and closed-pore versions of the model suggest that it may be possible to use EAC measurements as a tool for the study of legume nodule diffusion barrier structure and function. The ability of the model to predict EAC provided strong support for the hypothesis that H 2 inhibition of N 2 fixation plays a major role in the in vivo control of EAC and that the presence of a variable barrier to gas diffusion affects the H 2 and N 2 concentration in the infected cell and, therefore, the degree of H 2 inhibition...|$|E

Characterization of soybean in a maximum yield environment is necessary to provide empirical data to support those yield claims and to provide an understanding of the physiological processes at that yield level.

40|$|Introduction Oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) {{is one of}} the {{valuable}} oilseed crops which has been attracting attention in recent years (Arvin et al., 2011). Several factors such as water shortage, low relative humidity, heat and salinity can make drought stress. Radiation use efficiency and yield components are the effective factors of yield formation in oilseed rape. Drought tolerance in oilseed rape depends on other factors except radiation use efficiency. Studies have indicated that plant growth promoting rhizobacterias (PGPRs) has a direct effect on growth and they can cause resistance to the abiotic stress as well. Hence, considering the drought climate in Iran and the effects of PGPRs on increasing resistance to abiotic stress and relief of drought effects and the importance of the cultivation of oilseed rape in Iran, the present research was done with the goal of study of drought and some plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) on radiation use efficiency and dry matter partitioning into pod in different cultivars of oilseed rape.

Two research sites (under stress and non-stress fields) were beside each other. This region has a semi-arid climate (annual rainfall 286 mm). The experimental design was factorial based on randomized compeletly block design with three replications in each experiment. The first treatment was plant growth promoting rizobactria, including B 0 : no inoculation (control), B 1 :co-inoculation (Pseudomonas flourescens 169 +P. putida 108), B 2 : inoculation with P. flourescens 169 and B 3 : inoculation with P. putida 108. Second treatment was cultivar, including Hayola 401 and Hayola 330 cultivars belong to Brassica napus, Parkland and Goldrush cultivars belong to B. rapa and BP 18 and landrace cultivars belong to B. juncea. Radiation use efficiency and the <b>allocation</b> <b>coefficient</b> of materials to pods were measured in the present study as well. In addition, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed using SAS ver. 9. 1 software. Results and discussion Radiation use efficiency There were significant differences between stress and non-stress conditions in levels of bacteria, cultivar and bacteria × cultivar regarding radiation use efficiency. The outcomes showed that the coefficients of radiation use efficiency in each level (bacteria, cultivar and bacteria × cultivar) under non-stress condition was comparatively higher under stress condition. The interaction effects of bacteria × cultivar showed that P. flourescens× Goldrush under non-stress condition with 0. 62 ± 0. 08 dm. mg- 1 had the most and two strains of bacteria× Landrace with 0. 1 ± 0. 017 dm. mg- 1 had the least radiation use efficiency. Regarding bacteria level, Pseudomonas flourescens under non-stress condition with the average of 0. 39 ± 0. 071 dm. mg- 1 had the highest radiation use efficiency. Hayola 330 cultivar with 0. 45 ± 0. 047 and Hayola 401 cultivar with 0. 39 ± 0. 038 dm. mg- 1 obtained the greatest RUE under non-stress condition and BP 18 cultivar with 0. 11 ± 0. 06 dm. mg- 1 revealed the lowest RUE under stress condition. Both drought stress and simultaneous application with two strains of bacteria had negative effects on RUE. Dry matter partitioning into pod In this trial, considerable difference regarding pod partitioning coefficient revealed in the level of cultivar and bacteria × cultivar. The value of the pod partitioning coefficient under this investigation ranged from 0. 9393 ± 0. 084 under non-stress condition to 0. 1634 ± 0. 0210 under stress condition. Although inoculation treatment of bacteria had the synergy effect, co-inoculation treatment had the antagonistic effect of pod partitioning coefficient. Moreover, the rate of the pod partitioning coefficient lessened under drought condition. Berry & Spink (2006) and Arvin et al. (2014) stated that there were positive correlation between HI and partitioning photoasimilate in to economic organs. The {{results of the present study}} showed that dry matter partitioning into the pod with a final yield had a 91...|$|E

Dry matter production is simulated by an energy approach of radiation use efficiency (RUE) and intercepted photosynthetic active radiation (Q). Dry matter partitioning {{is based on}} the allometric approach by dry matter <b>allocation</b> <b>coefficients.</b> The relation between Q and dry matter production resulted in a RUE of 2. 36 g MJ- 1. The dry matter allometric coefficient was different in function of the crop phenology. A detailed leaf growth description is necessary to simulate intercepted radiation.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{aim of this}} paper is to evaluate the interregional linkages based on the many-region input-output table for Brazilian regions, for the year 1996, elaborated by FIPE. This work utilizes the extraction method by Strassert, 1968 and Schultz, 1977 and modified by Dietzenbacher et al (1993). Instead of extracting one sector from a sector-based model, we will examine the effects of hypothetically extracting a region from a many-region model. The method calculates the "backward linkages"; the "forward linkages" are obtained analogously from the matrix of <b>allocation</b> <b>coefficients.</b> The application of the methodology to the Brazilian inter-regional input-output tables shows that the states with high share in the Brazilian GDP presents a high degree of intra-regional interdependence both in terms of backward and forward linkages...|$|R

40|$|A non-orthogonal {{multiple}} access (NOMA) approach to user signal power allocation called Fair-NOMA is introduced. Fair-NOMA is {{the application of}} NOMA {{in such a way}} that two mobile users have the opportunity to always achieve at least the information capacity they can achieve by using orthogonal {{multiple access}} (OMA), regardless of the user selection criteria, making it suitable for implementation using any current or future scheduling paradigms. Given this condition, the bounds of the power <b>allocation</b> <b>coefficients</b> are derived as functions of the channel gains of the two mobile users. The NOMA power allocation is analyzed for two scheduled users that are selected randomly with i. i. d. channel gains. The capacity improvements made by each user and the sum capacity improvement are derived.
