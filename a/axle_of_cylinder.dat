40|$|The BTRE has {{examined}} {{trends in the}} fuel consumption of new passenger vehicles. The overall trend in fuel consumption was down during the 1980 s. However during the 1990 s, a more gradual reduction in the fuel consumption of cars, coupled with increasing sales of 4 -wheel-drive vehicles, has seen fuel consumption for new passenger vehicles as a whole stabilise. BTRE new vehicle database The average fuel consumption rate of new passenger vehicles sold each year is {{a significant factor in}} determining Australia’s transport fuel use and emissions well into the future. This is because passenger vehicles, the largest element of the vehicle fleet, are very long-lived. In fact, about half of new passenger vehicles sold in any one year are still on the road 20 years later. The BTRE has recently compiled one of the most comprehensive databases on new vehicle sales in Australia, with information on all light vehicle sales, by make and model, back to 1978. Though focussing on average fuel consumption, the database also records time-series for many other vehicle characteristics – including vehicle body style and drive type, fuel type, engine displacement, gear number, <b>axle</b> ratios, number <b>of</b> <b>cylinders,</b> maximum engine power (kilowatts – kW), gross vehicle mass (GVM), and vehicle price. With the exception of motorcycles, the database covers all types of ligh...|$|R
