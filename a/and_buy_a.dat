If you don't have your own car, haggle with a taxi or minibus driver in Kars for the round-trip to Ani, perhaps sharing the cost with other travelers. If you have trouble, the Tourist Office may help. Plan {{to spend at least}} a half-day at Ani. It's not a bad idea to bring a picnic lunch and a water bottle.|$|E
25|$|Before leaving London, Harrison had {{arranged}} to disembark in Delhi with Aspinall <b>and</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> top-quality sitar there. During the tour, the other Beatles had each {{decided to join}} the pair, although, after their troubles in Manila, all of the band {{would have preferred to}} return to London immediately. Their plane landed at night at Delhi's Palam Airport. While the Beatles had assumed that they were unknown in India, they were welcomed by a crowd of 500 fans and journalists and forced to give a brief press conference. The group's two-day stay in Delhi similarly came to resemble the stops throughout the tour in terms of media attention and periods of confinement in their hotel, the Oberoi.|$|E

25|$|In 1956 the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR)- {{which was}} slow in {{accepting}} diesels- {{finally decided to}} retire its steam fleet, which was {{the largest in the}} world at that time, <b>and</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> large order of diesels. Baldwin bid, expecting its lifelong loyal customer to help keep Baldwin in business by buying at least some Baldwin diesels. General Motors' EMD division, however, gave the PRR an exceptional deal on new, reliable GP9s, so the PRR— which was in a financial pinch itself— sent the business to GM. This one lost deal proved {{to be the end of}} the line, and—after 125 years of continuous production—Baldwin closed most of its Eddystone plant. It produced no more locomotives after 1956, instead concentrating on heavy construction equipment. More than 70,500 locomotives had been produced when production ceased in 1956.|$|E

He was nine when his parents decided they would move from their {{apartment}} <b>and</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> house in Long Beach, a location they chose because of their schools, parks, and youth sports options throughout the year. He grew up with older brother Charles Jr., who played college baseball and became a teacher, and younger brother Chris, who also became an MLB player. Gwynn's parents were civil servants who were tag-team parents. Gwynn's father worked at a warehouse from 7:30 A.M. until 5:00 P.M., and he also coached Pop Warner football and Little League Baseball; his mother worked {{at the post office}} from 5:30 P.M. until 3:00 A.M.

Wishing to size up their enemies, Greene and Nardi travel to New York and invite Salerno to invest in the ranch. After they leave, Salerno orders his {{associates}} to hire professional hitman Ray Ferritto to kill them both. Nardi is killed in a car explosion, McComber dies in a bombing at the Cleveland docks, and Ritson is shot near his house. Detective Manditski lets Greene know that a master killer is after him.

500|$|Music {{journalist}} Sarah Champion {{pointed out}} (prior to the million pound fire) that, [...] "Being 'in the money' doesn't mean they'll ever be rich. [...] always be , but their pranks {{will get more}} extravagant. If they earned £10 million, they'd blow it all by buying Jura or a fleet of K Foundation airships or a Van Gogh to be ceremonially burned." [...] "There are things we'd like to do which we haven't done.", Drummond told a journalist in 1991. [...] "Totally ludicrous things. We want to buy ships, have submarines. They really are stupid things I know, but I feel confident that {{in the event of}} us selling ten million albums we would definitely go out <b>and</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> submarine....Just {{to be able to say}} 'Look we've got a submarine and 808 State haven't'." ...|$|E
500|$|Spider {{decided to}} [...] "dodge his responsibilities" [...] and began {{staying away from}} Toyah, who was {{not happy about it}} as she wanted them to make a commitment. Spider {{eventually}} changed his mind and Hancock commented [...] "The fact is that he really fancies Toyah, and he figures that he may as well be hung for a sheep as a goat." [...] The actor reckoned that Spider and Toyah brought out the best in each other. Spider and Toyah soon began a proper relationship and briefly lived together. However, when Spider announced that he wanted to settle down <b>and</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> house with Toyah, the couple realised that they had started to drift apart. Spider thought that if they got a mortgage together it would help save the relationship, but Toyah did not want that at all. When Spider was offered a promotion, he realised {{that he did not want}} to work for the DSS anymore and quit. He then told Toyah that he had bought them tickets to India so that they could go and [...] "find themselves." [...] However, Toyah insisted that she did not want to leave Weatherfield. Nicole Carmichael from Inside Soap wrote that while Spider did not want to lose Toyah, he felt that he could not stay and soon departed.|$|E

500|$|The IWF {{said they}} were first {{notified}} of the Wikipedia URL on 4 December 2008. This followed the May 2008 reporting of the cover image on Wikipedia by U.S.-based social conservative site WorldNetDaily to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. A subsequent investigation by the FBI concluded that the artwork did not violate any US laws. An officer of the Concerned Women for America, a conservative Christian advocacy group, commented, [...] "By allowing that image to remain posted, Wikipedia is helping to further facilitate perversion and paedophilia". EContent magazine subsequently reported that the discussion page associated with the article declared [...] "Prior discussion has determined by broad consensus that the Virgin Killer cover will not be removed", and asserted that Wikipedia contributors [...] "favour inclusion {{in all but the}} most extreme cases". However, according to The Guardian because [...] "the IWF doesn't talk to people outside of the UK they weren't able to appreciate what was going on". Internet security expert Richard Clayton explained that [...] "We see this borderline stuff all the time; it's a no-win", before adding that the decision seems to have been based on taking the image out of context, particularly [...] "given that you can go into HMV <b>and</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> copy on the high street". [...] On 9 December 2008 the IWF reversed its blacklist of the Wikipedia pages {{on the basis of the}} [...] "contextual issues involved in this specific case and, in light of the length of time the image has existed and its wide availability".|$|E

2500|$|By using a {{toll-free}} number as its brand, a consumer can recognize the product, {{be directed to}} call for a purchase, <b>and</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> product within minutes. It was hoped that consumers would more easily remember the company's phone number, and thus be more likely to become repeat customers. 1800Contacts.com is also a domain name owned by the company in which a customer may order online.

2500|$|Large firms {{also tend}} to be old and in mature markets. Both of these have {{negative}} implications for future growth. Old firms tend to have a large retiree base, with high associated pension and health costs, and {{also tend to}} be unionized, with associated higher labor costs and lower productivity. Mature markets tend to only offer the potential for small, incremental growth. (Everybody might go out <b>and</b> <b>buy</b> <b>a</b> new invention next year, but it is unlikely they will all buy cars next year, since most people already have them.) ...|$|E
