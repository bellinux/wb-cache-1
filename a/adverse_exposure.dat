Although the recent unrest waned off without eruption, there are still open questions relating to the current threat of volcanic activity from the island. Here, we per-form a detailed and systematic assessment of the volcanic threat of Nisyros using a threat analysis protocol established as part of the USGS National Volcano Early Warning Sys-tem (NVEWS).

Recent studies show that being exposed to chronic psychosocial stress during sensitive periods of development can have an impact on later health. It appears that children exposed to adverse conditions (economic, material and psychosocial) show a higher risk of adopting deleterious health behaviors (smoking, alcohol), heightened vulnerability to chronic diseases and mortality.

Main outcome measure: Information from 1980, 1990 and 2000 {{was used for the}} percentage of the population with low educational achievement, gross domestic product per capita (GDPpc), and Gini coefficient to estimate BMI and prevalence of overweight by the number of times each province had an <b>adverse</b> <b>exposure</b> to each of these measures of socioeconomic environment.

40|$|There is a {{large body}} of {{evidence}} which suggests that an adverse fetal environment results in a heightened biobehavioural response to stress, with increased activity of the classical mediators of the stress response, including the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis and autonomic nervous system. Although this has been amply demonstrated in animal experiments, several recent studies suggest that the same processes operate in human populations and may have important consequences for health. The evidence suggests that an adverse early environment or markers of an adverse environment such as low birth weight are linked with long-term alterations in these neuroendocrine systems. However, these studies also demonstrate that there is a considerable degree of heterogeneity in the responses observed which appear to depend on a variety of factors such as the nature or timing of the <b>adverse</b> <b>exposure</b> as well as the gender of the offspring. The mediators of these classical neuroendocrine responses such as cortisol and catecholamines are biologically potent and may directly influence disease susceptibility by means of their effects on metabolism and the vasculature. However, lifelong changes in the set point of these neuroendocrine systems in response to the early environment may also direct the course of development during fetal life, infancy and childhood towards the generation of a phenotype adapted for the adult environment predicted by the clues available during fetal life. This has biological advantages if the actual adult environment turns out to be appropriate for the phenotype.

40|$|International audienceThe {{hypothesis}} that a developmental component {{plays a role}} in subsequent disease initially arose from epidemiological studies relating birth size to both risk factors for cardiovascular disease and actual cardiovascular disease prevalence in later life. The findings that small size at birth is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease have led to concerns about the effect size and the causality of the associations. However, recent studies have overcome most methodological flaws and suggested small effect sizes for these associations for the individual, but an potential important effect size on a population level. Various mechanisms underlying these associations have been hypothesized, including fetal undernutrition, genetic susceptibility and postnatal accelerated growth. The specific <b>adverse</b> <b>exposures</b> in fetal and early postnatal life leading to cardiovascular disease in adult life are not yet fully understood. Current studies suggest that both environmental and genetic factors in various periods of life may underlie the complex associations of fetal growth retardation and low birth weight with cardiovascular disease in later life.

40|$|Abstract__ Cardiovascular {{disease is}} the leading cause of mortality, {{morbidity}} and hospitalization worldwide, and is a major public health problem in adult populations. The developmental‐ origins hypothesis suggests that cardiovascular disease might originate from early life. <b>Adverse</b> <b>exposures,</b> acting in different periods of fetal and early postnatal life might lead to permanent adaptations in the cardiovascular system, which are beneficial for short term survival, but increase the susceptibility of cardiovascular disease in later life. This hypothesis is supported by experimental studies in animals showing that growth restriction in early life leads to developmental adaptations in cardiovascular structure and function, which leads to an increase in vulnerability to cardiovascular disease. In line with this hypothesis, large observational studies in humans have shown that fetal growth restriction and rapid infant growth are associated with cardiac and vascular changes in childhood and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in adulthood. Also, observational studies using more detailed <b>adverse</b> <b>exposures</b> during fetal life suggested that, among other maternal factors, higher maternal blood pressure during pregnancy and the presence of gestational hypertensive disorders are associated with increased risks of fetal growth restriction and a higher blood pressure in childhood. Postnatally, suboptimal infant nutrition and increased adiposity levels throughout childhood are also shown to be associated with the development of cardiovascular disease in later life. Thus, previous research suggests that a restricted nutritional in utero environment and abundant postnatal environment may lead to cardiovascular disease in later life. The mechanisms relating adverse maternal, fetal and infant factors with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases in later life are not fully understood. Early microvasculature adaptations, in response to <b>adverse</b> <b>exposures</b> in early life, might be part of the underlying mechanisms in the development of cardiovascular disease. Animal studies have shown that alterations in the microvascular structure and, hence, increased peripheral resistance, precede the development of hypertension. In humans, the microvasculature can non‐invasively be assessed by using retinal vascular imaging. Several longitudinal studies among adults have shown that retinal arteriolar narrowing, likely indicative of increased peripheral vascular resistance, is associated with increased risks of hypertension and stroke in later life, whereas wider retinal venular caliber is associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome and inflammation. Thus, these studies suggest that alterations in retinal vessel calibers can be used as early markers of cardio‐metabolic disease risk. In summary, cardiovascular disease might already originate in early life. Identifying risk factors and potential mechanisms influencing the development of cardiovascular diseases from early life onwards, is important for future preventive strategies that aim to improve cardiovascular health throughout the life course. Therefore, studies presented in this thesis were designed to identify maternal, fetal and infant factors associated with microvasculature alterations and cardiovascular health outcomes in childhood...|$|R

In general, the data showed that male crocodiles consistently produced higher biotransformation and oxidative stress responses compared to females. Relationships between these responses and concentrations of aliphatic hydrocarbons and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were also observed. Specifically, the catalytic assays for EROD and BROD (not PROD and MROD) showed sex-differences between male and female crocodiles and paralleled immunochemically determined CYP 1 A and CYP 3 A protein levels; the relatively similar levels of PAHs in both sexes suggest an estrogen-mediated reduction of this pathway in females. The antioxidant system exhibited higher levels in male crocodiles with slight or significant higher values for catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidases-H 2 O 2 (GPx-H 2 O 2), glutathione peroxidases-Cu (GPx-Cu), total antioxidant capacity towards peroxyl radicals (TOSC-ROO) and hydroxyl radicals (TOSC-HO), total glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA).

40|$|Brain {{diseases}} {{are one of}} the most prevalent groups of diseases in Europe with estimated annual costs amounting to euro 386 billion. Data collected by the WHO suggest that brain {{diseases are}} responsible for 35 % of Europe's total disease burden. In the treatment of neurological disease, the blood brain barrier (BBB) still represents an obstacle for the delivery of drugs to the brain and thus a major challenge for the development of therapeutic regimens. Understanding the molecular basis and functioning of the BBB in health and disease, including transport mechanisms across the BBB, therefore holds significant potential for future strategies to prevent and ameliorate neurological disease. Recent research indicates that some neurological disorders have a developmental etiologic component. The major goal of the NEUROBID project is thus to understand the molecular mechanisms and function of the BBB in health and disease both in the developing brain and the adult central nervous system. With an interdisciplinary consortium from the fields of developmental neurobiology and BBB research, NEUROBID aims to (i) understand the involvement of normal and disturbed BBB function in normal and abnormal brain development and (ii) to develop novel strategies for drug delivery to the brain. Unique transport mechanisms across the BBB will be used to target potential therapeutic macromolecular and cellular agents specifically to the brain barriers and transport them into the brain.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{review the}} {{appropriateness}} of the prevalence odds ratio (POR) and the prevalence ratio (PR) as effect measures in the analysis of cross sectional data and to evaluate different models for the multivariate estimation of the PR. METHODS: A system of linear differential equations corresponding to a dynamic model of a cohort with a chronic disease was developed. At any point in time, a cross sectional analysis of the people then in the cohort provided a prevalence based measure of the effect of exposure on disease. This formed the basis for exploring the relations between the POR, the PR, and the incidence rate ratio (IRR). Examples illustrate relations for various IRRs, prevalences, and differential exodus rates. Multivariate point and interval estimation of the PR by logistic regression is illustrated and compared with the results from proportional hazards regression (PH) and generalised linear modelling (GLM). RESULTS: The POR is difficult to interpret without making restrictive assumptions and the POR and PR may lead to different conclusions with regard to confounding and effect modification. The PR is always conservative relative to the IRR and, if PR > 1, the POR is always > PR. In a fixed cohort and with an <b>adverse</b> <b>exposure,</b> the POR is always > or = IRR, but in a dynamic cohort with sufficient underlying follow up the POR may overestimate or underestimate the IRR, depending on the duration of follow up. Logistic regression models provide point and interval estimates of the PR (and POR) but may be intractable in the presence of many covariates. Proportional hazards and generalised linear models provide statistical methods directed specifically at the PR, but the interval estimation in the case of PH is conservative and the GLM procedure may require constrained estimation. CONCLUSIONS: The PR is conservative, consistent, and interpretable relative to the IRR and should be used in preference to the POR. Multivariate estimation of the PR should be executed by means of generalised linear models or, conservatively, by proportional hazards regression...|$|E

Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), intracellular calcium ion concentration ([Ca 2 +]i), and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined using fluorescence microscopy or microplate reader assays. Young adult C 57 Bl/ 6 mice were exposed to a total dose of 0, 1. 0, or 5. 0 mg/kg body weight MeHg divided over postnatal days (P) 35 to 39. Pregnant female mice were exposed to a total does of 0, 0. 1, or 1. 0 mg/kg body weight MeHg divided over gestational days (G) 8 to 18. SY 5 Y cells were exposed to 0, 0. 01, 0. 1, or 1. 0 ?M MeHg or HgCl 2 for 24, 48, or 72 hours. Total Hg in brains of young adult mice, mouse pups, and SY 5 Y cells accumulated in a dose-dependent manner. Cell death increased in SY 5 Y cells exposed to the highest concentrations of MeHg and HgCl 2 used in this study. Cell death increased in the molecular and granule cerebellar cell layers of young adult mice exposed to the highest doses of MeHg used in this study. P 0 mouse pups showed no increase in cell death within the cerebellum following MeHg exposure. Cerebella of mice at P 10 exhibited decreased dying cells only in the external germinal layer. Low concentrations of MeHg affected MMP in both in vivo and in vitro studies, but {{did not result in}} decreased MMP typically associated with higher MeHg concentrations. [Ca 2 +]i was increased throughout the in vivo experiments in an age-, sexand brain region-dependent manner. Generation of ROS was decreased in both in vivo and in vitro studies with both the MeHg and HgCl 2 (in vitro) treatments. In summary, low and moderate MeHg exposure, both in vivo and in vitro, altered mitochondrial function, Ca 2 + homeostasis, and ROS differently than what is reported in the literature for higher MeHg exposure concentrations. SY 5 Y cells were sensitive to low-levels of MeHg and HgCl 2 and responded similarly to cells in the whole animal studies, thus making SY 5 Y cells realistic candidates for mechanistic MeHg studies. Cell culture and whole animal neuronal functional studies at chronic low-level MeHg exposure are limited. These data suggest that low-levels of MeHg may affect neuronal function. Therefore, further chronic low-level MeHg neuronal functional studies are warranted...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of fetal ovarian follicles {{is a critical}} determinant of adult female reproductive competence. Prolonged exposure to environmental chemicals (ECs) can perturb this process with detrimental consequences for offspring. Here {{we report on the}} exposure of pregnant ewes to an environmental mixture of ECs derived from pastures fertilized with sewage sludge (biosolids) : a common global agricultural practice. Exposure of pregnant ewes to ECs over 80 day periods during early, mid or late gestation reduced the proportion of healthy early stage fetal follicles comprising the ovarian reserve. Mid and late gestation EC exposures had the most marked effects, disturbing maternal and fetal liver chemical profiles, masculinising fetal anogenital distance and greatly increasing the number of altered fetal ovarian genes and proteins. In conclusion, differential temporal sensitivity of the fetus and its ovaries to EC mixtures has implications for adult ovarian function following <b>adverse</b> <b>exposures</b> during pregnancy...|$|R
50|$|Today, {{epidemiological}} studies {{focus on the}} etiology of mental disorders, i.e. the identification and quantification of causes underlying psychiatric problems and their mechanisms, rather than mere estimation of prevalence. It is not ethically possible to experimentally expose study participants to stressors suspected to cause psychiatric disorders, thus epidemiological techniques are required to study the etiology. For this purpose longitudinal studies, which follow children and adults {{for a long period}} of time, often for many years, are particularly useful. These allow the study of naturally occurring exposures and how they affect changes in psychiatric symptoms. Two notable historical studies focusing on etiology are the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study and the Christchurch Health and Development Study. These studies began in the 70's and studied the impact of perinatal problems, genetic variants, sexual abuse and other <b>adverse</b> <b>exposures</b> on psychological problems in childhood and later in adulthood.|$|R
40|$|To better {{understand}} the science linking environmental contaminants <b>exposures</b> with <b>adverse</b> pregnancy outcomes, we reviewed the relevant epidemiologic literature. We searched PubMed (primarily 1995 - 2006) using the key word combinations for select environmental exposures and pregnancy outcomes. Environmental tobacco smoke is {{a risk factor for}} reduced birth weight and preterm delivery. Outdoor air pollution is associated with reduced term birth weight and preterm delivery. Suggestive evidence associates pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls with decreased fetal growth and length of gestation. Stronger evi-dence, primarily occupational, links certain birth defects with exposure to organic solvents and chlorophe-noxy herbicides. Evidence suggests dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and bisphenol-A could be associated with pregnancy loss. Exposures in utero can also increase the risk of developmental delays (ie, impaired neurological function), adult chronic illnesses (ie, heart disease, diabetes, cancer), and next generation effects (ie, reduced reproductive capacity). Further research, education, and improved public health policy are needed to reduce potentially <b>adverse</b> <b>exposures...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Adverse</b> <b>exposures</b> that {{influence}} growth in prenatal and early postnatal periods {{are considered to}} influence vulnerability to chronic diseases via their effects on the neuroendocrine system. In humans, {{the assessment of the}} underlying mechanisms has been restricted. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of <b>adverse</b> early-life <b>exposures,</b> specifically maternal mood, on hypothlamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) responses to an acute physiological stressor. In addition, we conducted a preliminary examination into whether these effects varied by time of exposure and sex. One hundred and thity-nine individuals (mean age 15. 12 years) were recruited from the ALSPAC (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children) birth cohort. Participants underwent the CO(2) stress test and indices of the PNS, SNS and HPA axis were measured. Pre-existing data on demographic and psychosocial factors of the mothers during pregnancy (18 and 32 weeks) and postnatally (8 weeks and 8 months) were extracted, as were participants' clinical and demographic data at birth. Increases in both pre- and postnatal anxiety and depression were associated with greater SNS reactivity to the stressor and slower recovery, as well as blunted HPA axis responses. Programming effects on the SNS appeared to be restricted to male offspring only. No consistent relationships were evident for any of the measures of pre-stress function. We have found preliminary evidence that both pre- and postnatal maternal anxiety and depression have sustained programming effects on the SNS and HPA axis. Effects on the SNS were restricted to male offspring...|$|R
