5|$|In The Stuff of Thought (2007), Pinker {{looks at}} {{a wide range of}} issues around the way words related to {{thoughts}} on the one hand, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> outside ourselves on the other. Given his evolutionary perspective, a central question is how an intelligent mind capable of abstract thought evolved: how a mind adapted to Stone Age life could work in the modern world. Many quirks of language are the result.|$|E

25|$|Despite Cummings's {{familiarity}} with avant-garde styles (undoubtedly {{affected by the}} Calligrammes of Apollinaire, according to a contemporary observation), much of his work is quite traditional. Many of his poems are sonnets, albeit often with a modern twist, and he occasionally made use of the blues form and acrostics. Cummings' poetry often deals with themes of love and nature, {{as well as the}} relationship of the individual to the masses <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> His poems are also often rife with satire.|$|E
25|$|Bagan's {{economy is}} based mainly on tourism. Because of boycotts against the {{previous}} military government, the Bagan region's tourism infrastructure is still quite modest by international standards. The {{city has a}} few international standard hotels and many family-run guesthouses. Bagan is also the center of Burmese lacquerware industry, which {{to a large degree}} depends on tourist demand. Much of the lacquerware is destined for souvenir shops in Yangon, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> markets. Moreover, the lacquerware-making process itself has become a tourist draw.|$|E

25|$|James Hillman, {{founder of}} archetypal psychology, has {{done much to}} expose the {{unacknowledged}} or shadow “Christianisms” within Jungian depth psychology itself. For example: One barrier to grasping the underworld or domain of Hades as the psychic realm is Christ’s victory over death. Similarly, the model for viewing the shadow as a moral problem is the Christian doctrine of sin. Hillman believes that soul or interiority refers not only to humans but to inanimate objects <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> Hillman is critical of Jung’s convention of equating symbols of roundness (e.g. the rose window of a cathedral) with the Self, and discourages the attempt to achieve undivided wholeness by integrating parts. Jung’s Self (representing the inner God) derives from monotheism, and by contrast Hillman encourages a polytheistic perspective.|$|E
25|$|At the 1921 Imperial Conference British Prime Minister Lloyd George said: In {{recognition}} of their service and achievements during the war, the British Dominions have now been accepted fully into the comity of {{the nations of the}} whole world. They are signatories to the Treaty of Versailles and all other treaties of peace. They are members of the Assembly of the League of Nations, and their representatives have already attended meetings of the League. In other words, they have achieved full national status and they now stand beside the United Kingdom as equal partners in the dignities and responsibilities of the British Commonwealth. If there are any means by which that status can be rendered even more clear to their own communities <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> at large, we shall be glad to have them put forward.|$|E
500|$|Although, critically, The Story of Miss Moppet is {{considered}} one of Potter's lesser efforts, for young children it is valued as an introduction to books in general, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> of Peter Rabbit. The character of Miss Moppet was released as a porcelain figurine in 1954 and a plush toy in 1973. [...] The book has been published in a Braille version, translated into seven languages, and was released in an electronic format in 2005.

500|$|The {{panorama}} {{books are}} not Potter's best efforts, but do demonstrate {{her ability to}} pare text and illustrations to essentials. [...] She worked best, though, with more complicated plots and characters, and with specific settings rather than generalized backgrounds. [...] Her inexperience with babies and very young children {{is evident in the}} original panorama format itself, for a long strip of paper and a wallet are likely to be mutilated by the very young. The story in its current standard small book format of the Peter Rabbit series is considered to provide very young children with an introduction to books in general <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> of Peter Rabbit.|$|E
500|$|On September 8, Zito {{became the}} first pitcher in the AL to win 20 games when he pitched seven innings and allowed no earned runs against the Minnesota Twins.

[...] In his next start, against the Seattle Mariners, Zito took a no-hitter into the eighth inning before John Olerud singled to leadoff the inning.

500|$|After Pausch {{finished}} his lecture, Steve Seabolt, {{on behalf of}} Electronic Arts, which is now collaborating with Carnegie Mellon {{in the development of}} Alice 3.0, pledged to honor Pausch by creating a memorial scholarship for women in computer science in recognition of Pausch's support and mentoring of women in CS and engineering. Then, university president Jared Cohon called his contributions to the university and to education [...] "remarkable and stunning". He then announced that Carnegie Mellon would build a raised pedestrian bridge named for Pausch in honor of his contributions to the university <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> This connected Carnegie Mellon's new Computer Science building and the Center for the Arts, a symbol of the way Pausch linked those two areas. Finally, Brown University professor Andries van Dam followed Pausch's last lecture with a tearful and impassioned speech praising him for his courage and leadership, calling him a role model.|$|E
500|$|At 11:35p.m., Obama {{appeared}} on major television networks:Good evening. Tonight, I can {{report to the}} American people <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> that the United States has conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden, the leader of al-Qaeda, and a terrorist {{who was responsible for}} the murder of thousands of innocent men, women, and children... President Obama recalled the victims of the September 11 attacks. He praised the nearly ten-year-old war against al-Qaeda, which he said had disrupted terrorist plots, strengthened homeland defenses, removed the Taliban government, and captured or killed scores of al-Qaeda operatives. Obama said that when he took office he made finding bin Laden the top priority of the war. Bin Laden's death was the most significant blow to al-Qaeda so far but the war would continue. He reaffirmed that the U.S. was not at war against Islam and defended his decision to conduct an operation within Pakistan. He said Americans understood the cost of war but would not stand by while their security was threatened. [...] "To those families who have lost loved ones to al-Qaeda's terror," [...] he said, [...] "justice has been done." [...] This remark book-ended President Bush's statement to a joint session of Congress following the September 11 attacks that [...] "justice will be done." ...|$|E
