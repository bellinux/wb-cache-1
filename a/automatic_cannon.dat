The nose turret could rotate +/- 100° from the aircraft's centerline and could mount either a 40mm (1.57in) grenade launcher, or a 7.62mm (0.308in) minigun.

5|$|The forces {{allocated}} to the defence of Singapore were not strong. In early 1945, Japanese air defences for the island included only two Army companies equipped with <b>automatic</b> <b>cannon,</b> some IJN anti-aircraft units, and {{a small number of}} fighter aircraft. Some of the anti-aircraft guns were crewed by Malay auxiliaries. The effectiveness of what was already an inadequate air defence force was hindered by a lack of coordination between the Army and Navy, shortages of fire control equipment for the guns, and no fire-control radar or barrage balloons being available. Defence against night raids was particularly weak as no night fighters were stationed near Singapore and coordination between the anti-aircraft guns and searchlight units was poor.|$|E

25|$|The only weapon the ATOM {{prototype}} possesses is a 57mm BM-57 automatic gun. This rifled autocannon is {{a modification}} of the Soviet 57 mm S-60, developed by the company Petrel. This high caliber autocannon has an effective range of 6km and fires {{at a rate of}} 120–140 rds/min. The turret traverses 360° across the azimuth and has an elevation range between −8° and +70°. 80–100 rounds are carried within the turret with an additional 100 stowed away. The 57mm <b>automatic</b> <b>cannon</b> provides engagement of light armoured and soft targets, ATGM crews, and even aerial targets (UAVs, precision-guided munitions, aircraft and helicopters). It takes 1–3 seconds to change the type of munition for the cannon.|$|E
25|$|At {{this time}} he {{constructed}} {{a couple of his}} most successful inventions for military anti-aircraft defence. The invention was a tempering machine for anti-aircraft guns and it was introduced for military anti-aircraft instrumentation. Among other things, he collaborated with AB Bofors about his invention Impulse engine, a tempering machine for anti-aircraft autocannons. The Bofors 40 mm air-craft gun, often referred to simply as the Bofors gun, is an anti-aircraft/multi-purpose autocannon designed in the 1930s by the Swedish arms manufacturer AB Bofors. It {{was one of the most}} popular medium-weight anti-aircraft systems during World War II. In the mid-1930s the foundation for the company’s most famous product was laid, the Bofors 40mm <b>automatic</b> <b>cannon,</b> which during World War II were produced in different countries in 10,000 numbers of copies.|$|E

25|$|Sundsvall was 97.5 {{meters long}} and 9.2 meters wide. The hull {{was made of}} steel while the {{superstructures}} were constructed of light metal. The main superstructure was just forward of midships and housed among other the galley, wheelhouse and navigation bridge and the command bridge. The machine consisted of three Penhoët A oil-fired boilers which generated steam {{for two of the}} de Laval steam turbines of 36,000 horsepower, which in turn drove two propellers. This machinery gave the ships a maximum speed of 39 knots. The main artillery consisted of three 12 cm guns and the air defense consisted of eight 40 mm anti-aircraft <b>automatic</b> <b>cannon</b> m/36. In addition, there were anti-aircraft machine guns and torpedo tubes, and more than 40 mines and 16 depth charges could be carried.|$|E
25|$|After the war the Hispano {{variants}} disappeared {{fairly quickly}} as fighter armament {{due to the}} introduction of revolver cannon, based on the prototype versions of the never-produced German wartime Mauser MG 213 cannon. The British introduced the powerful revolving 30mm ADEN cannon in most of their post-war designs, while the French used the very similar DEFA cannon, firing similar ammunition. Similarly, the USAF introduced the 20mm M39 cannon to replace the M24, while the Navy instead combined the original Hispano design with a lighter round for better muzzle velocity in the Colt Mk 12 cannon. As a ground vehicle mounted gun, either anti-aircraft or as a general-purpose autocannon, the HS.404 lasted into the 1960s. A powered turret variant is still in production in Honduras, and is used as a light anti-aircraft gun by the army and navy in several nations. The A/N M3 was developed into the Mk16 Colt 20mm <b>automatic</b> <b>cannon,</b> one of the main weapons on boats of the Mobile Riverine Force in the Vietnam War and also used on some larger amphibious ships.|$|E
25|$|The Fahd 280-30 is an IFV {{variant of}} the Fahd, first {{announced}} in 1990. It features a BMP-2 turret {{on the roof of}} the passenger compartment near the rear. It has a 30 mm <b>automatic</b> <b>cannon</b> with a dual feed, one for HE rounds, the other for AP rounds, which can pierce 18mm armor at 60 degrees from a range of 1500m. It also has a coaxial 7.62 mm PKT machine gun and an ATGM launcher, capable of launching AT-4 or AT-5 missiles which use SACLOS guidance, increasing the range at which the Fahd 280-30 can engage armored targets such as tanks to nearly 4000m. These turret-mounted missiles may be deployed away from the vehicle on a launching tripod. The Fahd-30 carries 500 30mm rounds for the autocannon, 2,000 rounds for the 7.62mm machine gun, and five AT-5 missiles. Smoke grenade launchers are standard on this vehicle, with four on each side of the turret. The BMP-2 turret may use appliqué armor. In terms of design it is similar to the Fahd 240, but this variant has three firing ports on each side of the vehicle.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis study presents {{an analysis of}} the fixed biases and variable errors affecting gun fire. The emphasis is placed on <b>automatic</b> <b>cannons</b> being developed for use as main guns for armored vehicles. It is proposed that barrel bend has been overlooked as a primary cause of inaccurate fire and that <b>automatic</b> <b>cannons</b> will be particularly susceptible to this condition. A formula is derived for approximating the magnitude of bend that can occur. A model is presented for estimating miss distance in the plane of the target as a result of fixed biases (including barrel bend) and other variable errors. A parametric analysis demonstrates the magnitude of resulting miss distance. Methods of avoiding the effects of barrel bend are presented. [URL] United States ArmyCaptain, United States Arm...|$|R

In the 1930s, Hispano-Suiza was asked to develop a 20mm cannon able to fire through the propeller shaft of a gear-reduction inline aviation engine like the Hispano-Suiza 8BeC. They took out a license on the Oerlikon FF S and made minor modifications to produce the Hispano-Suiza <b>Automatic</b> <b>Cannon</b> Type HS.7 and HS.9.
