50|$|It is a two-storeyed brick {{building}} comprising eight one-bedroom brick flats, four flats per floor, accessed via a central entrance from McLachlan Street. The roof is hidden behind front and side parapets. A laundry block is accommodated on the roof, at the rear. This has a flat roof behind its own parapet. On each side elevation, a centrally- positioned recess accommodates timber stairs and landings that once functioned as the service stairs, and now serve as fire-escapes only. The upper floor flats and front ground-floor flats {{each have a}} door opening onto the service stair. The two rear ground-floor flats have a back door opening to the narrow spaces {{along the sides of}} the building. At each side of the building three brick steps lead from the street to these side spaces, which once provided side <b>access</b> <b>to</b> the <b>service</b> <b>door</b> of each flat. This access is now gated. There is a brick planter box each side of the front entrance, occupying a narrow space between the front wall of the building and the street boundary.|$|R

40|$|GSAF) is a {{model that}} uses the distance, size, and {{economic}} resources of a community to calculate a statistically valid score measuring a community's relative <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>services.</b> This score is then translated into Zones of Relative <b>Access</b> <b>to</b> those <b>services.</b> Quantifying <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>services</b> is an objective way to compare the rurality of communities. This model was used {{in a study of}} 342 communities in British Columbia (Canada) that examined community acceptance of professionals such as teachers, nurses, and social workers. The objectivity provided by the GSAF model helped to determine that community acceptance took longer in more rural communities. Given differences in data from Statistics Canada and the Australian Census Bureau, the GSAF model is more appropriate for Australia than Canada, but the basic idea of measuring <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>services</b> is a premise that holds much potential for policymakers in Canada whenever it is necessary to compare communities.

30|$|The {{analysis}} of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> credit <b>services</b> received by farmers showed that 75.6 and 24.4 % {{of the farmers}} have {{and do not have}} <b>access</b> <b>to</b> credit <b>services</b> respectively. The chi-square result (X 2 [*]=[*] 1.485) of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> credit <b>services</b> is statistically insignificant at the 95 % level of significance. Therefore, there is no relation between <b>access</b> <b>to</b> credit <b>services</b> and farmers’ decision to participate in watershed management programs. This could be because of farmers’ fear about their inability to pay back the credit within the prescribed period of time, which could lead to punishment.|$|R

Health policies mobilize solidarity networks as well as the health <b>services</b> offered. Fair <b>access</b> <b>to</b> health <b>services</b> depends both on individual demands (possibility of accessing <b>services</b> and actual <b>access</b> <b>to</b> health <b>services)</b> and supplies (availability and organization of the system).

40|$|Background: Equity of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> health <b>services</b> {{is a major}} {{challenge}} faced by many countries in the world. The gap in health status between developed and developing countries often occur. Including health inequalities between groups within a country. This study aimed to describe theory and application of the equity of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> health <b>services</b> in research. Methods: The literature review with systematic mapping studies related <b>to</b> equity of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> health <b>services</b> in some countries. It is conducted {{with a set of}} five research questions, there were 30 studies, from 1999 to 2014, were evaluated. Results: Equity in <b>access</b> <b>to</b> health <b>services</b> occurred when health services have been distributed according to geography, socio-economic and community needs, and vice versa. Empirical studies generally reported incidents of inequity of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> health <b>services</b> was influenced by various factors. Generally, researchers used secondary data in exploring equity of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> health <b>services.</b> Conclusion: Equity of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> health care is an important issue {{that needs to be addressed}} in achieving the goals of health systems. This can be achieved if health care is distributed according to geography, socio-economic and community needs. Both improvement of the supply side and the demand side also exploration studies of <b>access</b> <b>to</b> health <b>services</b> need <b>to</b> be developed...|$|R
