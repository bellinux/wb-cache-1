500|$|Observations {{from the}} SMARTS {{telescope}} {{show that in}} visible light Sedna {{is one of the}} reddest objects in the Solar System, nearly <b>as</b> <b>red</b> <b>as</b> Mars. Chad Trujillo and his colleagues suggest that Sedna's dark red colour is caused by a surface coating of hydrocarbon sludge, or tholin, formed from simpler organic compounds after long exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Its surface is homogeneous in colour and spectrum; this may be because Sedna, unlike objects nearer the Sun, is rarely impacted by other bodies, which would expose bright patches of fresh icy material like that on 8405 Asbolus. Sedna and two other very distant objects – [...] and [...] – share their color with outer classical Kuiper belt objects and the centaur 5145 Pholus, suggesting a similar region of origin.|$|E

I stopped and leaned against the fence, feeling unspeakably tired. Tongues of fire and blood stretched over the bluish black fjord. My friends went on walking, while I lagged behind, shivering with fear. Then I heard the enormous, infinite scream of nature."
