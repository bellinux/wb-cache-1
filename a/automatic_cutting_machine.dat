In {{order to}} meet the needs about {{collecting}} the soil containing tree species, we designed an <b>automatic</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>machine</b> which can receive loam containing seeds and used in the forest loam. Features of this machine are the application of the chain plate knife, not only can hierarchical cut loam containing seeds, but also will transport the loam to the collecting bag. In the design process, through building a mathematical model about the chain plate knife cut soil, Analysis of the resistance of working, and get the relationship between the overall level of resistance and the working width. The experimental results show that the machine is easily to be operated, can highly efficient cut soil, and it’s suitable for use in the woodlands...|$|E
30|$|A {{sheet of}} commercially pure {{titanium}} grade 1 ASTM B 265 (William Gregory Ltd., UK) with a thickness of 1 [*]mm was cut into 8 [*]×[*] 5 [*]cm pieces using an automatic metal cutting machine. The titanium pieces were cleaned with liquid soap and 70 % ethanol for 10 [*]min in an ultrasonic bath. The substances were dried in an oven at about 658 °C for 30 [*]min {{in order to}} prepare them for anodization. After anodization, substrates were ultrasonically washed in an ultrasonic bath with acetone for 20 [*]min and 70 % ethanol for 20 [*]min [1]. To remove naturally formed oxide layers, substrates were immersed in an acid mixture containing 2 [*]ml 48 % HF, 3 [*]ml 70 % HNO 3 and 100 [*]ml deionized (DI) water for 5 [*]min prior to anodization. Some of the acid-polished substrates were treated immediately by anodization. Titanium substrates were used as an anode in anodization process, while a stainless steel sheet served as a cathode. What makes this method cheaper is the application of stainless steel instead of platinum as a cathode pole, which makes the technique more commercial (Patent no. V 12011 A 000166). Anode and cathode poles were connected by copper wires and linked to positive and negative ports of a 30 [*]V/ 3 A power supply, respectively. While processing, anode and cathode poles, kept in parallel with a separation distance of about 2 [*]cm, were submerged into an electrolyte solution of diluted HF (1.5 [*]wt.%) in a Teflon beaker. A constant potential between the anode and cathode poles at 20 [*]V was applied. After accomplishing the anodization process within 20 [*]min, the substrates were rinsed thoroughly with DI and dried in an oven at about 658 °C for 30 [*]min. Anodized titanium nanostructure was then cut into small pieces of 1 [*]×[*] 1 [*]cm 2 with an <b>automatic</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>machine.</b> Sheets were then cleaned serially with tetrachloroethylene, 20 [*]min in acetone and 20 [*]min in 70 % ethanol in ultrasonic bath. Treatment with UV for 30 [*]min was applied for sterilization of the anodized titanium nanostructure pieces. A piece of unanodized 1 [*]×[*] 1 [*]cm 2 titanium sample was used as a control after cleaning through the above-mentioned serial procedure. Indeed, one tissue culture polystyrene plate also served as a control surface [7].|$|E

An atomic force microscope (AFM) (SPA- 400) was used to characterize the morphology of the MLG before and after etching. The etching of MLG was performed by the inductively coupled plasma (ICP) 98  A with 30  sccm of O 2 for 60  s. The Au was deposited onto the MLG by evaporation using the same system as the growth process. A Au wire was heated to evaporate slowly by applying a DC on it, which was fixed on top of the MLG sample. With lithography, we prepared Au-graphene contact and measured the IV properties by the linear transmission line method (LTLM). The IV was carried out by using a Keithley 2410 SourceMeter and a Keithley 6514 system electrometer at room temperature.|$|R

40|$|The {{quality of}} <b>cutting</b> <b>machines</b> is {{affected}} by several factors that can be directly or indirectly influenced by manufacturers, technicians and users of machine tools. The most critical qualitative evaluation parameters of machine tools include accuracy and stability. Investigations of accuracy and repeatable positioning accuracy were essential for the research presented in this paper. The aim was to develop and experimentally verify {{the design of a}} methodology for cutting centers aimed at achieving the desired working precision. Before working on the topic described here, it was necessary to make several scientific analyses, which are summarized in this paper. We can build on the initial working hypothesis that by improving the technological parameters (e. g. by increasing the working speed of the machine, or by improving the precision of the positioning) the quality of the <b>cutting</b> <b>machine</b> will also be improved. For the purposes of our study, several investigated parameters were set affecting positioning accuracy, such as rigidity, positioning speed, etc. First, the stiffness of the portal structure of the <b>cutting</b> <b>machine</b> was analyzed. FEM analysis was used to investigate several alternative structures of the <b>cutting</b> <b>machine,</b> and also an innovative solution for beam mounting. The second step was to integrate two types of drives into the design of the <b>cutting</b> <b>machine.</b> The first drive is a classic rack and pinion drive for <b>cutting</b> <b>machines.</b> To increase (improve) the working speed of the machine, linear motors were designed as an alternative drive. The portal of the <b>cutting</b> <b>machine</b> was designed for a working speed of 260 mmin− 1 and acceleration of 25 m. s− 2. The third step was {{based on the results of}} the analysis. In collaboration with Microstep, an experimental <b>cutting</b> <b>machine</b> in a portal version was produced using linear synchronous motors driving the portal on both sides, and with direct linear metering of its position.
