25|$|Epinephrine (adrenaline) {{reacts with}} both α- and β-adrenoreceptors, causing {{vasoconstriction}} and vasodilation, respectively. Although α receptors are less sensitive to epinephrine, when activated at pharmacologic doses, they override the vasodilation mediated by β-adrenoreceptors {{because there are}} more peripheral α1 receptors than β-adrenoreceptors. The result is that high levels of circulating epinephrine cause vasoconstriction. At lower levels of circulating epinephrine (physiologic epinephrine secretion), β-adrenoreceptor stimulation dominates since epinephrine has a higher affinity for the β2 <b>adrenoreceptor</b> than the α1 <b>adrenoreceptor,</b> producing vasodilation followed by decrease of peripheral vascular resistance.|$|E
25|$|Phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as {{milrinone}} {{are sometimes}} utilized in severe cardiomyopathy. The {{mechanism of action}} is through inhibiting the breakdown and thereby increasing the concentration of cAMP similar to beta <b>adrenoreceptor</b> agonism, resulting in inotropic effects and modest diuretic effects.|$|E
25|$|There is {{compelling}} {{evidence that the}} N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor has significant involvement in the CNS sensitization process. It is also hypothesized that elevated CNS glutamate levels promote wind-up and CNS sensitization. In addition, there is experimental evidence that demonstrates NMDA receptors in peripheral nerves. Because immunological functions can modulate CNS physiology, {{it has also been}} hypothesized that a variety of immune processes may contribute to the initial development and maintenance of peripheral and central sensitization. Furthermore, trauma related cytokine release, exaggerated neurogenic inflammation, sympathetic afferent coupling, <b>adrenoreceptor</b> pathology, glial cell activation, cortical reorganisation, and oxidative damage (e.g., by free radicals) are all concepts that have been implicated in the pathophysiology of CRPS.|$|E

50|$|Bisoprolol β1-selectivity is {{especially}} important in comparison to other nonselective beta blockers. The effects of the drug are limited to areas containing β1 <b>adrenoreceptors,</b> which is mainly the heart {{and part of the}} kidney. Bisoprolol minimizes the side effects that might occur from administration of a nonspecific beta blocker where blockage of the other <b>adrenoreceptors</b> (β2, β3, α1, α2) occurs. The other receptors elicit a variety of responses in the body, and their blockage could cause a wide range of reactions, but β1 <b>adrenoreceptors</b> are cardiospecific for the most part, making bisoprolol ideal for treatment of cardiac events.|$|R

2500|$|<b>Adrenoreceptor</b> {{blockers}} (alpha and beta) They {{are most}} commonly used to treat hypercatecholaminergic states. [...] Overall the blockers reduce incidences of long-term disease. [...] The blockade not only affects cardiomyocytes directly but also works to reduce the risks of heart failure and hypertension. [...] One side effect {{is that it can}} activate pulmonary edema with patients who already have unstable hearts. [...] In particular, beta-blockers are used for the management of cardiac arrhythmias. [...] They link the brain and the cardiovascular system in cardiovascular diseases. [...] Beta-blockers have also been studied in depressed patients. [...] A meta-analysis concluded that with anti-depressant medication, the percentage of patients in remission from depressed symptoms significantly increased from just anti-depressants alone. [...] This suggests that this type of medication might be beneficial for both behavioral and cardiovascular symptoms of depression.|$|E

An early postinfraction period is characterized with intensive remodeling {{of the left}} ventricle (LV) and high risk of dangerous complications that is ten {{times more than the}} monthly number of complications during the next year. The aim of research was the study of an influence of beta- 1 <b>adrenoreceptors</b> on the heart rhythm variability, ectopic heart activity, daily profile of arterial pressure, postinfraction remodeling in patients with an acute Q-myocardium infraction.   Methods. There were examined 235 patients with Q-myocardium infraction.

Results. Under an influence of treatment there was established the growth of temporal indices of the heart rhythm variability (HRV), spectral indices that present the parasympathetic influence on the background of decrease of the spectral components of sympathetic origin and mean HR, decrease of ectopic heart activity, normalization of daily profile of arterial pressure, improvement of systolic and diastolic function of LV. Conclusions. The use of beta- 1 <b>adrenoreceptors</b> in the complex treatment of patients with acute Q-MI decreases the risk of forming LV aneurism, favors an improvement of HRV indices, ectopic heart activity, daily profile of arterial pressure, intracardiac hemodynamics</p...|$|R

40|$|The {{cross-talk}} between sympatho-adreno-medullar axis and {{innate immunity}} players was mainly studied in rodents. In intensive husbandry, pigs {{are exposed to}} multiple stressors inducing repeated releases of catecholamines that bind to <b>adrenoreceptors</b> (AR) on target cells. Among <b>adrenoreceptors,</b> the (beta 2 -AR is largely expressed by immune cells including macrophages. We report herein {{on the effects of}} catecholamines, through (beta 2 -AR stimulation, on pig macrophage functions activated by LPS. beta 2 -AR stimulation of porcine macrophages prevented the LPS-induced increase in TINF alpha and IL- 8 secretion while increasing IL- 10 secretion. In contrast, treatment with a beta 2 -agonist had no effect on anti-microbial functions. Lastly, beta 2 -AR stimulation of macrophages reduced the expression of genes up regulated by LPS. Altogether, we demonstrated that (beta 2 -AR stimulation of porcine macrophages prevented polarization towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Since porcine macrophages are a suitable model for human macrophages, our results might be relevant to appreciate catecholamine effects on human macrophages...|$|R

40|$|Background: Pre-eclampsia is {{the leading}} cause of {{maternal}} and neonatal morbidity and mortality with incompletely understood etiopathogenesis. The purpose of the current study is to determine whether there is a relationship between the presence of autoantibodies against b 1, b 2 and a 1 <b>adrenoreceptors</b> and severe pre-eclampsia. Methodology/Principal Findings: Synthetic peptides corresponding to amino acid sequences of the second extracellular loops of b 1, b 2 and a 1 <b>adrenoreceptors</b> were synthesized as antigens to test 34 patients with severe pre-eclampsia, 36 normal pregnancy women and 40 non-pregnant controls for the presence of autoantibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The respective frequencies of autoantibodies against b 1, b 2 and a 1 <b>adrenoreceptors</b> were 50. 0 % (17 / 34), 52. 9 % (18 / 34) and 55. 9 % (19 / 34) in patients with severe pre-eclampsia, 19. 4 % (7 / 36) (p = 0. 011), 19. 4 % (7 / 36) (p = 0. 006) and 17. 6 % (6 / 36) (p = 0. 001) in normal pregnancy women and 10 % (4 / 40), 7. 5 % (3 / 40) and 10 % (4 / 40) (p, 0. 001) in non-pregnant controls. Titers of these autoantibodies were also significantly increased in patients with severe pre-eclampsia. By logistic regression analysis, the presence of these three autoantibodies significantly increased the risk of neonatal death (odds ratio, 13. 5; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 3 – 141. 3; p = 0. 030) and long-term neonatal hospitalization (odds ratio, 5. 0; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 3 – 19. 1; p = 0. 018).
