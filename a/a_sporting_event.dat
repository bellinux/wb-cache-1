5|$|The most {{successful}} film to open during Super Bowl weekend is the 2008 concert film , which took in $31.1 million, {{almost half the}} total it would earn during a released limited to just that weekend and the following week. In a close second is Dear John, grossing $30.5 million in 2010, for the strongest Super Bowl weekend opening for a conventional release. Both films had strong appeal to female moviegoers, an audience more receptive to moviegoing on a weekend dominated by <b>a</b> <b>sporting</b> <b>event.</b> The 2008 action film Taken, which Cargill noted for its success in appealing to an older audience, took in $24.7 million on its opening weekend {{on its way to}} total receipts of over $100 million, making it a distant third.|$|E
5|$|The Calgary Winter Olympics {{were the}} first winter games to earn a {{significant}} television revenue base; where the 1980 Lake Placid Games generated only US$20.7 million worldwide, OCO'88 generated $324.9 million in broadcast rights. The overwhelming majority of television revenues came from the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), which agreed in 1984 to pay $309 million for American television rights, over three times the $91.5 million it paid for the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo. The deal, {{at the time the}} highest amount ever paid for <b>a</b> <b>sporting</b> <b>event,</b> allowed organizers to announce the Games would be debt-free. The CTV Television Network paid C$4.5 million for Canadian rights and to act as the host broadcaster. The games were also televised on CBC. While western European nations paid US$5.7 million combined.|$|E
5|$|If {{the player}} wishes {{to take over}} a {{territory}} through diplomatic means, they must initiate dialogue with the local leader. If the player has a high enough popularity, the local leader may invite them to <b>a</b> <b>sporting</b> <b>event,</b> such as elephant race or a game hunting session, which will give the player an opportunity to unite that territory under their faction. If the player's popularity is not high enough, they may hold a Durbar festival in an attempt to impress the local leaders. If diplomacy fails, the player has the option to invade any territory by force. Soldiers can be hired through payments of gold; however, if the player does not have a sufficient amount of gold {{at the end of the}} turn, a rebellion may start. Rebellions will sometimes initiate lethal encounters with assassins, in which the player-character must defend themselves through sword combat. Additionally, the player can bring assassins to their side by successfully launching an attack on their temple. The game will end once either all of the territories are united, or if the player-character is assassinated.|$|E

25|$|Between 1905 and 1908, {{all three}} major Southern Hemisphere rugby {{countries}} sent their first touring teams to the Northern Hemisphere: New Zealand in 1905, followed by South Africa in 1906 and then Australia in 1908. All three teams brought new styles of play, fitness levels and tactics, and {{were far more}} successful than critics had expected. The New Zealand 1905 touring team performed a haka before each match, leading Welsh Rugby Union administrator Tom Williams to suggest that Wales player Teddy Morgan lead the crowd in singing the Welsh National Anthem, Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau, as a response. After Morgan began singing, the crowd joined in: {{the first time a}} national anthem was sung at the start of <b>a</b> <b>sporting</b> <b>event.</b> In 1905, France played England in its first international match.|$|E
25|$|San Jose was an {{integral}} part of the launching of MLS, hosting the league's inaugural game at Spartan Stadium before a crowd of 31,683 on April 6, 1996. The crowd did not go away disappointed as San Jose won its first game on the first goal in MLS history from Eric Wynalda, defeating D.C. United 1–0. One month later, the club made history again, as they hosted the Los Angeles Galaxy in a match that drew 31,728 fans to Spartan Stadium, setting the record for attendance at <b>a</b> <b>sporting</b> <b>event</b> in the city of San Jose. But Wynalda and Calloway were soon at each other's throats again, eventually leading to a locker room brawl between Wynalda and John Doyle. The skirmish reached memorable proportions when Wynalda hired an airplane to tow a banner demanding Calloway's firing.|$|E
25|$|The Northern Stand, {{also known}} as the Olympic Stand, was built to replace the old Grandstand for the 1956 Olympic Games. By Health Department regulations, this was to {{increase}} the stadium's capacity to 120,000; although this was revised down after the 1956 VFL Grand Final, which could not comfortably accommodate its crowd of 115,802. Ten years later, the Grey Smith Stand and the open concrete stand next to it were replaced by the Western Stand; the Duke of Edinburgh laid a foundation stone for the Western Stand on 3 March 1967, and it was completed in 1968; in 1986, it was renamed the Ponsford Stand in honour of Victorian batsman Bill Ponsford. This was the stadium's highest capacity configuration, and the all-time record crowd for <b>a</b> <b>sporting</b> <b>event</b> at the venue of 121,696 was set under this configuration in the 1970 VFL Grand Final.|$|E
