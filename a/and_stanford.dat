5|$|A season {{highlight}} was {{the final}} game against Stanford's arch-rival California at California Memorial Stadium, the last game of the regular season. Before the game, both teams were undefeated <b>and</b> <b>Stanford</b> had not beaten California since 1905. Nevers did not play due to a broken ankle. Late in the game, California was leading 20–3; California coach Andy Smith, sure the game was over, began substituting regular players. Warner {{seized the opportunity to}} combine passing with the trick plays for which he was known (a fake reverse and a full spinner), <b>and</b> <b>Stanford</b> made a comeback. The game ended in a 20–20 tie.|$|E

5|$|As {{it had in}} {{the third}} quarter, Stanford's offense scored quickly. In only three plays, the Cardinal {{advanced}} 72yards. A 34-yard run by Stepfan Taylor was followed by one stopped for no gain, then Luck completed a 38-yard throw to Fleener for Stanford's second touchdown of the quarter. The score and extra point improved Stanford's lead to 40–12 with 6:05 remaining in the game. Tech's subsequent drive went three-and-out after Tyrod Taylor was sacked twice, <b>and</b> <b>Stanford</b> got the ball again at its 46-yard line.|$|E

5|$|The {{architect}} of Woodlea is variously stated as McKim, Mead & White, <b>and</b> <b>Stanford</b> White, although according to William Mitchell Kendall in his 1920 {{list of the}} firm's works, he attributes the house's design to McKim, Mead & White, with W. R. Mead as the supervising architect. Mead was rarely involved in architectural design in the partnership, making his design of Woodlea and another Vanderbilt house, Florham, unusual. He was related to Shepard, as Mead's sister was married to Shepard's brother.|$|E

5|$|The game {{kicked off}} at 8:39p.m. in warm weather, <b>and</b> <b>Stanford</b> scored first, a touchdown, with its third {{offensive}} possession. Virginia Tech briefly {{took the lead}} with a defensive score and a touchdown of its own, but Stanford restored a 13-12 advantage before halftime. In the second half, Stanford pulled away from Virginia Tech as it scored 13 points {{in the third quarter}} and 14 in the fourth while holding the Hokies scoreless.|$|E
5|$|Because Stanford {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech received it to begin the second half. After starting from their 21-yard line, the Hokies went three-and-out. Following a Tech punt, Stanford's first drive {{of the second half}} began at its 41-yard line. Two plays gained 13yards and a first down, then Stanford began battering Virginia Tech with its passing offense. Luck threw four consecutive passes: the first was incomplete, but the next three went for 10, 17, and 18yards, respectively. This gave Stanford a first down at the Tech one-yard line. Three plays later, Owen Marecic crossed the goal line on a running play. The subsequent extra point was missed, <b>and</b> <b>Stanford</b> extended its lead to 19–12 with 8:47 remaining.|$|E
5|$|Hammonds had {{scholarship}} {{offers to}} attend Duke University, the University of Notre Dame, <b>and</b> <b>Stanford</b> University and play college baseball.

At Stanford, Hammonds broke the Pac-10 single season stolen base record as a freshman, stealing 102 bases in 174 career games. Hammonds was awarded NCAA Freshman of the Year and voted All-College World Series in 1990 and was also named an All-American in that year.|$|E

5|$|O'Neill {{became an}} {{assistant}} professor at Princeton in 1956, and was promoted to associate professor in 1959. He visited Stanford University in 1957 to meet with Professor Wolfgang K. H. Panofsky. This resulted in a collaboration between Princeton <b>and</b> <b>Stanford</b> to build the Colliding Beam Experiment (CBX). With a US$800,000 grant from the Office of Naval Research, construction on the first particle storage rings began in 1958 at the Stanford High-Energy Physics Laboratory. He figured out how to capture the particles and, by pumping the air out to produce a vacuum, store them long enough to experiment on them. CBX stored its first beam on March 28, 1962. O'Neill became a full professor of physics in 1965.|$|E
5|$|The First World War had {{a severe}} effect on Stanford. He was frightened by air-raids, {{and had to}} move from London to Windsor to avoid them. Many of his former pupils were {{casualties}} of the fighting, including Arthur Bliss, wounded, Ivor Gurney, gassed, and George Butterworth, killed. The annual RCM operatic production, which Stanford had supervised and conducted every year since 1885, had to be cancelled. His income declined, as the fall in student numbers at the college reduced the demand for his services. After a serious disagreement {{at the end of}} 1916, his relationship with Parry deteriorated to the point of hostility. Stanford's magnanimity, however, came to the fore when Parry died two years later <b>and</b> <b>Stanford</b> successfully lobbied for him to be buried in St Paul's Cathedral.|$|E
