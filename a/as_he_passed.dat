5|$|According to the Orkneyinga Saga, {{in the war}} which followed, Thorfinn {{defeated}} Karl in a sea-battle off Deerness at {{the east}} end of the Orkney Mainland. Then Karl's nephew Mutatan or Muddan, appointed to rule Caithness for him, was killed at Thurso by Thorkel the Fosterer. Finally, a great battle at Tarbat Ness {{on the south side of}} the Dornoch Firth ended with Karl defeated and fugitive or dead. Thorfinn, the saga says, then marched south through Scotland as far as Fife, burning and plundering <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>passed.</b> A later note in the saga claims that Thorfinn won nine Scottish earldoms.|$|E
5|$|In {{his next}} title defense, Hughes fought Gil Castillo at , {{defeating}} the former Middleweight contender via TKO. Hughes started the match {{with a big}} slam {{and then began to}} attack from Castillo's guard with elbows and punches. Hughes easily avoided any submission attempts and looked far stronger than Castillo. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>passed</b> to half guard, Castillo was bleeding above his left eye. The challenger's only offense was a weak triangle choke that went nowhere. The round ended with Hughes on top, ground-and-pounding his opponent. Between rounds doctors ruled that the resulting cut was too severe to continue, and Hughes was declared the winner due to stoppage.|$|E
5|$|Schumacher {{moved up}} a {{position}} <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>passed</b> Button for fifth position at turn {{three on the}} same lap. On lap twenty-eight, Trulli drove back to his garage to retire with a hydraulics failure that was caused by his power steering becoming heavy during the safety car period. Vettel set a new fastest lap of the race of 1:54.098, extending his lead over Alonso to 3.5 seconds. Button, who was under pressure from Hülkenberg and Kubica, made a pit stop {{at the end of}} lap twenty-eight for intermediate tyres and rejoined in fifteenth place. Kovalainen was sent into a spin by Buemi, having been passed by Petrov two laps later.|$|E

5|$|The party truce {{ended in}} 1864, with Tories outraged over Palmerston's {{handling}} of the territorial dispute between the German Confederation and Denmark known as the Schleswig-Holstein Question. Disraeli had little help from Derby, who was ill, but he united the party enough on a no-confidence vote to limit the government to a majority of 18—Tory defections and absentees kept Palmerston in office. Despite rumours about Palmerston's health <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>passed</b> his eightieth birthday, he remained personally popular, and the Liberals increased their margin in the July 1865 general election. In {{the wake of the}} poor election results, Derby predicted to Disraeli that neither of them would ever hold office again.|$|E
5|$|Harding {{began his}} {{four years as}} a state senator as a {{political}} unknown; he ended them {{as one of the}} most popular figures in the Ohio Republican Party. He always appeared calm and displayed humility, characteristics that endeared him to fellow Republicans even <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>passed</b> them in his political rise. Legislative leaders consulted him on difficult problems. It was usual at that time for state senators in Ohio to serve only one term, but Harding gained renomination in 1901. After the assassination of McKinley in September (he was succeeded by Vice President Theodore Roosevelt), much of the appetite for politics was temporarily lost in Ohio. In November, Harding won a second term, more than doubling his margin of victory to 3,563 votes.|$|E
5|$|On 30 March 1805, the French Mediterranean Fleet under Vice-Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve {{successfully}} {{broke out}} of Toulon harbour, avoiding the British blockade fleet under Vice-Admiral Lord Nelson and sailing westwards out of the Mediterranean and into the Atlantic, Nelson following several days behind. Villeneuve, joined by a Spanish squadron, crossed the ocean to the Caribbean and anchored at Martinique, while Nelson arrived at Barbados on 11 June. Panicked by the British arrival, Villeneuve immediately returned to Europe, with Nelson again close behind. Villeneuve's orders had specified that he sail to Brest, the French naval port on the Bay of Biscay, and join there with the fleet under Vice-Admiral Honoré Ganteaume. Together this force would drive the Royal Navy out of the English Channel in preparation for an invasion of Britain. However, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>passed</b> the Spanish port of Ferrol on 22 July 1805, Villeneuve was intercepted by a British fleet under Vice-Admiral Sir Robert Calder. At the ensuing Battle of Cape Finisterre, Calder captured two Spanish ships but failed to inflict a decisive blow on Villeneuve's squadron, which later sailed to Cadiz, Spain's principal Atlantic seaport. Nelson arrived shortly afterwards and initiated a blockade of the port.|$|E

5|$|The weather {{conditions}} became more breezy but remained {{hot in the}} Saturday morning practice sessions. Häkkinen was fastest in the third practice session {{with a time of}} 1:19.115. Barrichello was second quickest, recording a lap time 0.089 seconds slower than Häkkinen. Michael Schumacher was third fastest, two-tenths of a second in front of Trulli, Ralf Schumacher and Villeneuve. Frentzen, Fisichella, Verstappen and Herbert completed the top ten. Coulthard did not set a lap during the third session as his team changed his engine as it developed an electrical problem. In the final practice session, Coulthard had a trouble-free session and was fastest with a time of 1:18.654. Michael Schumacher and Barrichello maintained their pace from Friday and were second and third fastest. Häkkinen was fourth quickest and was unable to improve his time <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>passed</b> an area with waved yellow flags. Trulli was fifth fastest, in front of Ralf Schumacher who was running quicker after set-up changes. Villeneuve, Frentzen, Salo and Fisichella completed the top ten ahead of qualifying.|$|E
25|$|On May 10, Dold, Shea {{and other}} strike leaders met with President Theodore Roosevelt <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>passed</b> through Chicago. Roosevelt refused to mediate {{an end to}} the strike, denounced the use of strike violence, and warned the labor leaders to settle the dispute quickly before federal {{military}} intervention was needed.|$|E

25|$|Among his {{immediate}} {{and most important}} concerns was the organization of a true colonial army. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>passed</b> through Puebla he reviewed a battalion of militia formed of Negroes and Mulattoes. Their arms were very irregular, and the new viceroy made a formal request to Spain for new rifles to arm them.|$|E
25|$|Francesco Totti holds Roma's {{official}} appearance record, {{having made}} 785 (as of 20 May 2017) appearances in all competitions, {{over the course}} of 25 seasons from 1993 until 2017. He also holds the record for Serie A appearances with 618, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>passed</b> Giacomo Losi on 1 March 2008 during a home match against Parma.|$|E
25|$|He played {{just four}} matches the {{following}} season {{but had a}} breakthrough year in 1990 <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>passed</b> 1,000 runs {{for the first time}} in his career, included in this aggregate were three centuries. The first came in early June against Oxford University, opening the batting he scored 156. The other two centuries came in back-to-back innings against Leicestershire and Worcestershire.|$|E

25|$|Lesley, {{who was a}} {{prisoner}} in the Tower of London, said that Lethington had sent copies of the casket letters to Mary (who was at Bolton Castle), but Lethington's messenger, Robert Melville, denied it. Lesley also alleged {{there had been a}} plot to murder Moray on his return <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>passed</b> through North Allerton, but because Norfolk had persuaded Moray to be more favourable, the assassination was called off.|$|E
25|$|His {{domestic}} form {{suffered in}} 2004 {{as he could}} manage a first-class batting average of only 31.17 and just nine wickets all season. His one-day performances were even worse, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>passed</b> fifty just once in 11 innings. In a 50 overs a side match played on 29 April Clarke hit 82 runs off only 28 balls. It included 9 Fours and 6 Sixes. It helped Surrey get to 494–5 against Gloucestershire.|$|E
25|$|Educated at Loretto College, Evans was a {{right-handed}} middle-order batsman and {{an occasional}} fast-medium right-arm bowler. His was a curious first-class cricket career: he played 22 matches over 14 years (though he appeared in only six of those seasons) and {{was used as a}} specialist batsman. Yet his career average was less than 10. This lack of success is more remarkable <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>passed</b> 50 runs in an innings twice in his career, one of them a not-out innings.|$|E

25|$|<b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>passed</b> his seventieth birthday, Carmichael's star {{continued}} to wane and was nearly forgotten {{in a world}} dominated by rock music. With the help and encouragement of his son, Hoagy Bix, Carmichael participated in the PBS television show Hoagy Carmichael's Music Shop that featured jazz-rock versions of his hits. He appeared on Fred Rogers's PBS show Old Friends, New Friends in 1978. With more time on his hands, Carmichael resumed painting, and after a long courtship he married Dorothy Wanda McKay, an actress, In 1977.|$|E
25|$|He {{could not}} endure {{imprisonment}} and immediately organized an escape party. Escaping from the POW camp with two comrades, they successfully made it almost to Kuala Lumpur, {{often with the}} aid of Malayan Chinese and Chinese communist guerrillas, before they were betrayed to the Japanese by Malays. It was during this escape that McLaren began to hate the Japanese <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>passed</b> the bodies of hundreds of Chinese men, women and children, who had been tortured, raped, and then killed by Japanese occupation forces.|$|E
25|$|Priapus' iconic {{attribute}} was his priapism (permanently erect penis); {{he probably}} absorbed some pre-existing ithyphallic deities as his cult developed. He was represented {{in a variety}} of ways, most commonly as a misshapen gnome-like figure with an enormous erect phallus. Statues of Priapus were common in ancient Greece and Rome, standing in gardens or at doorways and crossroads. To propitiate Priapus, the traveler would stroke the statue's penis <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>passed</b> by. The Athenians often conflated Priapus with Hermes, the god of boundaries, and depicted a hybrid deity with a winged helmet, sandals, and huge erection.|$|E
