40|$|There is {{significant}} interest {{in determining the}} role of climate-induced shocks as a prominent driver on migration decisions of different groups of farmers in South Asia. Using data from a survey of 2, 660 farm-families and focused group discussions in Bihar (India), Terai (plains) (Nepal) and coastal Bangladesh, we employed logistic regression to investigate household response towards migration and gender dimensions of <b>adverse</b> <b>climatic</b> <b>events.</b> The results suggest that migration decisions depend on farmers’ unique resource profiles: (a) households that use migration to improve their resilience, mostly resource rich households; (b) households that have {{no alternative but to}} migrate, mostly poor farmers; and (c) households who cannot migrate due to different socio-economic obligations, mostly farmers with intermediate level of income that also includes women, children and elderly of different income profiles. These profiles represent a spectrum with households within a profile being closer to {{one or the other of}} the profiles on either side. They are not mutually exclusive and serve as a point of departure for further research to refine key explanatory variables. Given that some members of the household pursue migration as a result of <b>adverse</b> <b>climatic</b> <b>events,</b> government strategies are required to mitigate risks at destinations and create opportunities for the trapped populations...|$|E
40|$|Is {{international}} migration an adaptation strategy to sudden or gradual climatic shocks? In this paper we investigate {{the direct and}} the indirect role of climatic shocks in developing countries as a determinant of out-migration flows toward rich OECD countries in the period 1990 - 2001. Contrarily to the bulk of existing studies we use a macro approach and explicitly consider the heterogeneity of climatic shocks (type, size, sign of shocks and seasonal effects). Our {{results show that the}} occurrence of <b>adverse</b> <b>climatic</b> <b>events</b> in origin countries has significative direct and indirect effects on out-migration from poor to rich countries...|$|E
30|$|Earlier {{work has}} shown that {{variables}} such as the proportion of households with sewage treatment service, with garbage collection service, and with access to water through piped system indicate both poverty levels and development (Baker 2004; Feitelson and Chenoweth 2002). Thus, we found that those cantons in the least vulnerable category are also those with higher coverage of these public services. In addition, the proportion of population working in agriculture, hunting or fisheries {{and the proportion of}} households on owning agricultural land are associated with local economic capabilities and opportunities. Results show that these indicators are among the ten largest contributions to the composite indicator. That is, vulnerability in Ecuador is also influenced by the concentration of economic activities related to agriculture, which limits other economic activities and the ability of people to shift in response to reduced agricultural income that may result from <b>adverse</b> <b>climatic</b> conditions. Some implications of these results arise: first, land tenure promotes economic development and reduces vulnerability as economic deprivation, in an <b>adverse</b> <b>climatic</b> <b>event,</b> is partially resolved by selling land assets. In addition, as agricultural work does not necessarily demand academic qualifications or schooling, this affects human capital accumulation and implies reduced adaptive capacity.|$|R
40|$|Water is {{essential}} for life. With increasing human development and climate change, water has become a pivotal resource for sustainable development, both societally and environmentally. Agriculture, on which a burgeoning population depends for food, is competing with industrial, household, and environmental uses for increasingly scarce freshwater supplies in many areas (Vörösmarty et al. 2010; Rosegrant et al. 2003). Drought is an important <b>adverse</b> <b>climatic</b> <b>event</b> for both ecosystems and human society. Global mean surface air temperature has increased by about 0. 76 °C since 1850 (Trenberth et al. 2007) {{and is expected to}} increase by 1. 5 °– 6. 4 °C {{by the end of the}} twentyfirst century (Meehl et al. 2007). Under a warming climate, persistent drought may increase (Dai et al. 2004; Pachauri and Reisinger 2007; Dai 2011 b), while human populations and associated demands for freshwater resources are rising, increasing food production constraints and putting global food security at risk.

30|$|Income (farm or off-farm) {{does not}} {{significantly}} modify smallholders’ perceived level {{of climate change}} {{and its impact on}} local agriculture. Results indicated that farm households in the study area on average earn nearly a third (32  %) of their annual income from non-farm sources and dependency of income is therefore associated with external contingencies influencing off-farm income generating activities or employment and does not drive a perception of climate change. Off-farm income will also increase diversification opportunities and therefore buffer any income losses and <b>adverse</b> effects of <b>climatic</b> <b>events</b> such as drought.|$|R
40|$|Throughout {{their history}} {{mountain}} communities {{have had to}} adapt to changing environmental and socio-economic conditions. They have developed strategies and specialized knowledge to sustain their livelihoods {{in a context of}} <b>adverse</b> <b>climatic</b> <b>events</b> and constant change. As negotiations and discussions on climate change emphasize the critical need for locally relevant and community owned adaptation strategies, {{there is a need for}} new tools to capitalize on this local knowledge and endogenous potential for innovation. The toolkit Promoting Local Innovation (PLI) was designed by the Centre for Development and Environment (CDE) of the University of Bern, Switzerland, to facilitate a participatory social learning process which identifies locally available innovations that can be implemented for community development. It is based on interactive pedagogy and joint learning among different stakeholders in the local context. The tried-and-tested tool was developed in the Andean region in 2004, and then used in International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) climate change adaptation projects in Thailand, Burkina Faso, Senegal, and Chile. These experiences showed that PLI can be used to involve all relevant stakeholders in establishing strategies and actions needed for rural communities to adapt to climate change impacts, while building on local innovation potential and promoting local ownershi...|$|E
40|$|Aberdeen Angus (originated in Scotland) is {{the second}} most common beef breed in the Czech Republic due to its {{resistance}} to <b>adverse</b> <b>climatic</b> <b>events,</b> modesty, earliness, ease of calving, low birth weight of calves and good maternal instincts of cows. The main economic indicator of suckler cows rearing is the number of born and weaned calves. Production of twins is possible way to improve these indicators. The aim of this thesis was to compare the growth potential of twins of Aberdeen Angus beef breed with individuals who were born as singletons. The work is focused on comparing the weight at birth, in 120 and 210 days of age. Most twins in the population of Aberdeen Angus breed reared in the Czech Republic in 2009 - 2013 was born in 2012 - 9. 44 % (270 pcs.), the least in 2013 - 6. 67 % (184 pcs.). The incidence of twins by birth order increased from 1 to 3 birth order (78, resp. 130, resp. 131 pcs.) as further increasing order resulted into decline of twin's incidence. The difference in weight between twins and singletons at birth was 5. 81 kg, in 120 days 28. 32 kg and 37. 32 kg 210 days (P 0. 001). Differences within twins by sex were for bulls and heifers statistically significant (P 0. 001). The relationship between weight at birth and calving ease was also investigated - in the case of twins relationship was not statistically significant (P> 0. 05). The lowest mortality rate of twins was in 2013 - 8. 70 % (16 pcs.), the highest mortality rate was in 2012 36. 67 % (99 pcs.). Most twins were born in 2011 (179 pcs.), whereas least twins were born in 2010 (160 pcs.) ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The Peruvian hake (Merluccius gayi peruanus) {{stock has}} been in a {{delicate}} state in the last decades due to overexploitation combined with <b>adverse</b> <b>climatic</b> <b>events.</b> The stock is showing certain signs of recovery since 2012. This work analyses the environmental impacts of current fleet operations and its likely trend. Methods: The fleet was divided into coherent segments, per holding capacity and engine power. The validity of both segmentations, as well as the presence of an effect of economies of scale driving fuel use intensity (FUI), was tested. Life cycle assessment was used to calculate environmental impacts, per individual sampled vessel and per segment, complemented with indicators of energy efficiency and biotic resource depletion. Results and discussion: The fleet is highly fuel-efficient (120 kg fuel per tonne fish) when compared with other reported values, despite a large overcapacity that increases the impact of the construction and maintenance phases. Significant inter-annual FUI variations were observed (80. 0 kg t− 1 in 2008 to 210. 3 kg t− 1 in 2006), but no clear trend. Neither significant differences in FUI among fleet segments nor a clear effect of economies of scale were found (but FUI analysis was based on a small sample of 32 values for nine vessels, two of which had data for a single year). Only the largest vessels, featuring 242 m 3 holding capacity and 850 hp engine power, were found to have lower FUI {{than any of the other}} vessels, but no statistical test could be applied to validate this difference. Differences in environmental impacts of individual vessels are mostly dominated by their relative FUI. Fuel use and, to a lower extent, maintenance are the main sources of environmental impacts. The most contributing impacts to ReCiPe single score are climate change, human toxicity and fossil depletion. The fishery's impacts on the biotic natural resource were orders of magnitude higher than many other global hake stocks, due to overexploitation. Conclusions: The environmental impacts of the national hake fleet are relatively low during the study period, despite an overcapacity of the fleet. With the perspective of expanding its operations and obtaining better yields on the eventuality that the stock fully recovers, these impacts should decrease. More research based on additional FUI data is necessary to effectively compare the performance of these vessels with larger ones (featuring > 180 m 3 and > 500 hp, of which nine existed in 2016) before possibly recommending their preferential use.

40|$|Medium-to-long range streamflow {{predictions}} {{provide a}} key assistance in anticipating hydro- <b>climatic</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> and prompting effective adaptation measures. In this context, recent modelling {{efforts have been}} dedicated to seasonal and inter-annual predictions based on the teleconnection between at-site hydrological processes and large-scale, low-frequency climate fluctuations, such as El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). This work proposes a novel procedure for first detecting the impact of ENSO on hydro-meteorological processes at the basin scale, and then quantitatively assessing the potential of ENSO indexes for building medium-to-long range streamflow prediction models. Core of this procedure is {{the adoption of the}} Iterative Input variable Selection (IIS) algorithm, which is employed to find the most relevant determinants of streamflow variability and derive predictive models based on the selected inputs. The procedure is tested on two different case studies, the Columbia River (US) and the Williams River (Australia), whose sensitivity to ENSO fluctuations has been documented in previous studies. Results show that IIS outcomes for both case studies are consistent with the results of previous analyses conducted with state-of-the-art detection methods, and that ENSO indexes can effectively be used in both regions to enhance the accuracy of streamflow prediction models...|$|R

40|$|Land {{management}} {{policies in}} New Zealand have had several distinct phases. The post War drive to expand substantially pastoral production was characterised by an increased reliance on technological and chemical inputs. A publicly funded infrastructure provided farmers and rural communities with farm advisory services, subsidy programmes, and arid {{financial assistance to}} recover from natural disasters and <b>adverse</b> <b>climatic</b> <b>events.</b> In the 1970 s people began to question the wisdom of this orientation. A shift in public opinion reflected changing attitudes towards these {{of natural resources and}} the impact of production and development on the environment. The economic restructuring and reorganisation of state agencies implemented by the fourth Labour Government in the mid 1980 s resulted in a withdrawal of farm services and funding sources. The move towards market allocation of resources and fiscal restraint led to the removal or reduction of subsidies. The change has meant some land uses are not sustainable in terms of their impact on soil resources or their economic viability. There are also parts of New Zealand where current land use problems are not confined to individual property boundaries. The response to these problems has varied significantly. In some cases, central government has provided financial incentives to generate change or to provide short-term assistance. In other situations land users have attempted to develop productive systems that are more suited to the resource base. When crises develop, the overall response has tended to occur largely through central government initiative. Although land management initiatives are adopted with the intention of including those experiencing land use problems, the complex interaction between physical, economic, financial, and social factors has generally been overlooked. While understanding varies with regard to physical, economic and financial factors, the role of those affected and the process of their inclusion is generally not we'll understood Economic and social impediments to change can be based on a lack of access to information. Individuals are often unaware of the source of necessary information and advice. A further constraint appears to be the inconsistent data bases that are used by different groups. Other impediments include an inability of individuals to perceive problems that occur on their own properties, social pressure to conform, short term financial constraints infrastructure constraints, inflexible institutional arrangements, and inadequate policy-making processes to facilitate change. One area that warrants attention involves the breaking down of information monopolies; that is situations where particular information regarding some natural or social phenomenon is specific to a particular social grouping. All parties are likely to benefit significantly when data gathering and analysis functions are decentralised to the most appropriate management level. The challenge facing New Zealand land policy makers is to investigate approaches to land management where all knowledge or information about the resource is incorporated in decisions. It is hypothesised that movement towards sustainable development and management of natural resources depends on resource users being empowered to identify and resolve issues that they are associated with. There is interest in exploring approaches to land management that involve cooperation between land policy makers and those affected by policy making...|$|E

40|$|The Indian {{sericulture}} {{industry is}} beset with many problems. One {{of the main}} problems is the inability to produce quality silk of international grade. The quality silk can be produced only form bivoltines. The bulk of silk produced in India is from Multivoltines which are of inferior quality. Therefore, it is highly pertinent to have more productive bivoltine silkworm breeds capable of producing quality silk. However, the hot climatic conditions of India is not conducive to rear productive bivoltines. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop bivoltine breeds which can yield stable crops under the <b>adverse</b> <b>climatic</b> conditions. Accordingly, efforts should be focussed by the silkworm breeders to develop bivoltine breeds with genetic plasticity to buffer against the <b>adverse</b> <b>climatic</b> conditions. The main constraint of the tropical environment is the high temperature coupled with high and low humidity. It is a well established fact that the bivoltines are highly vulnerable to high temperature coupled with high and low humidity especially in the late instars. The hot climatic conditions of tropics prevailing particularly in summer are contributing to the poor performance of the bivoltine breeds {{and the most important}} aspect is that many quantitative characters such as viability and cocoon traits decline sharply when temperature is high. Therefore, it is highly pertinent to identify more number of bivotine breeds which can withstand <b>adverse</b> <b>climatic</b> conditions.
