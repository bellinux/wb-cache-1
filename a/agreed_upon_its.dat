This was acknowledged by the king Ladislaus in a charter dated 23 March 1407. However, new circumstances occurred in 1409, as Ladislaus sold his rights to Dalmatia to the Republic of Venice.

50|$|According to most jurists, {{masturbation}} {{is generally}} considered Haram or prohibited in Islam. But there are varying opinions on the permissibility of masturbation. The Qur'an has been cited as being ambiguous {{on the issue of}} masturbation. The hadith regarding masturbation are, too, not considered to take a definitive stance on the subject. As such, positions on masturbation vary widely. According to alDin Tarbiyyah, it is permissible if done out of necessity. He also permitted masturbation as a means whereby soldiers, far away from their wives on a tour of duty may remain chaste. The four Sunni schools of jurisprudence (known as Madhaahib - the Hanafi, Shafi'i, Maliki and Hanbali schools of Fiqh) have differing stances on the issue. Some see it forbidden in certain cases (i.e. if it leads a man/woman to ignore their spouse sexually) but recommended it when they see it as a lesser evil to illicit sex. It is generally prohibited according to the Hanafi and Hanbali Mazhabs, unless one fears adultery or fornication, or is under the desire pressure, in which case, it is permissible to seek a relief through masturbation. According to Ahmed ibn Hanbal, it is permissible for prisoners, travellers and for {{men and women who have}} difficulty in finding a lawful spouse. It is prohibited all the time according to the Maliki and Shafi`i Mazhabs. It is haram in Shi'ite jurisprudence. There has always been a view to permit masturbation as the lesser of two evils (so as to ward of falling into fornication). Thus it is categorically incorrect to state that all Islamic scholars of the early Islamic age have unanimously <b>agreed</b> <b>upon</b> <b>its</b> complete prohibition. Jurists distinguish between those who masturbate out of necessity and those who have these means yet still masturbate to gratify their lust.|$|E
40|$|This is a cross-sectional, {{descriptive}} study among Malay women admitted in the antenatal and postnatal ward {{to determine the}} prevalence and use of herbal medicines during pregnancy and elemental analysis in the most popular herbs. A total of 460 women were surveyed. Herbal medicine use during pregnancy was 34. 3 %, while 73 % utilized herbal medicines during labor, because of a belief that it may shorten and ease labor. The most commonly used herbal medicines in pregnancy were Anastatica hierochuntica L. (60. 1 %) followed by coconut oil (35. 4 %). The majority of women (89. 2 %) used only one type of herbal medicines and took one capsule/glass (38 %) per day. Herbal medicines use by pregnant women is largely unsupervised (81 %), with most women getting information from their parents (60. 7 %) and buying the products directly from traditional midwives (32. 2 %) and 77 % <b>agreed</b> <b>upon</b> <b>its</b> efficacy and safety.

40|$|We all {{associate}} meaning with textile designs. If {{we can see}} {{the principles}} of Revolutionary zeal and the sanction of family life and work in one textile design, we can perceive the explicit Modernism of another and realize that in the complex decisions that comprise the creation of a textile, we have fashioned our world and its values. Perhaps the textile is small, but its condensed values and meaning may be a more clarified perception about the world than most others. For many, such as Roland Barthes, textiles and clothing can thereby be described as a sign system offering a language by which we have non-verbal communication in the world. The effectiveness of such a sign system as Barthes proposes depends upon the sharp denotation and appropriate connotations of the visual sign that inheres within the textile.

Identity {{management}} systems are indispensable in modern networked computing, as they equip data providers with key techniques {{to avoid the}} imminent privacy threats intrinsic to such environments. Their rationale is to convey data providers {{with a sense of}} control over the disclosure and usage of personal data to varying degree, so that they can {{take an active role in}} protecting their privacy. However, we purport the thesis that a holistic sense of control includes not only the regulation of disclosure, as identity management techniques currently do, but must equivalently comprise the supervision of compliance, i. e. credible evidence that data consumers behave according to the policies previously <b>agreed</b> <b>upon.</b> Despite <b>its</b> relevance, supervision has so far not been possible. We introduce the concept of privacy evidence and present the necessary technical building blocks to realise it in dynamic systems. ...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} desire among {{communities}} to become more sustainable. Energy conservation and renewable energy production (including solar energy) {{play a significant role}} in community sustainability goals. Public officials and engaged citizens have many opportunities throughout the planning process to help support and advance solar energy initiatives in their communities. LONG-RANGE COMMUNITY VISIONING AND GOAL SETTING Community visioning is often the first step in developing any type of community plan, for establishing new standards, policies, and incentives, for doing development work, and for making public investment decisions. Whether part of a planning process or on its own, visioning is an important first chance to identify new opportunities and priorities—including those related to solar energy. Planners often conduct visioning exercises that produce a community’s long-term goals and objectives. By expressing their views of renewable energy generation during these visioning exercises (including responding to surveys and participating in visioning meetings), citizens enable planners to gauge the level of awareness and importance of solar energy in the community. Planners use this information to develop policies and action items for the community. Once a community <b>agrees</b> <b>upon</b> <b>its</b> long-range goals and objectives, municipal officials should look to them when reviewing development proposals, making budget decisions, and performing other related tasks. Both citizens and public officials should use these visioning meetings to discuss how solar energy is connected to other community goals and values and how solar energy could help achieve other community goals.

Our derivation depends on a linear approximation, but we use simulations to validate the theory and show that log-power firing rate functions result in scalar timing over a large range of times and parameters. Simulation results also show that our theory as first posed exhibits a slight bias towards overestimation. We show that this bias can be corrected using a simple iterative approach to learn a decision threshold...|$|R
