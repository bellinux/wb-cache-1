5|$|Jaw joint - The dentary (the {{lower jaw}} bone, which carries the teeth) and the squamosal (a small cranial bone) meet {{to form the}} joint. In most gnathostomes, {{including}} early therapsids, the joint consists of the articular (a small bone <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the lower jaw) and quadrate (a small bone <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the upper jaw).|$|E

5|$|The {{mandible}} (lower jaw) is {{long and}} low. The coronoid process, the frontmost of the three main processes (projections) <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the jawbone, is large and about {{as high as the}} condyloid process behind it. The angular process, below the condyloid, is fairly short and does not extend further backwards than the condyloid. There is no noticeable capsular process (a raising <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the jaw that houses the root of the lower incisor).|$|E
5|$|The {{only known}} upper tooth of Indraloris is an M3, YGSP 46009. It is broken <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> labial corner. The main cusp is protocone; {{among the other}} two cusps, the paracone is higher but the metacone larger. There is a spur <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the protocone, {{suggesting}} a rudimentary hypocone. The protocone {{is connected to the}} paracone by a protoloph, which lacks a small cusp (the paraconule). No crest connects the protocone to the metacone, but there is a cingulum <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> margin of the tooth. The tooth bears a strong parastyle (accessory cusp at the front labial corner) and has three roots.|$|E

5|$|Although m1 {{is nearly}} rectangular, the width {{at the front}} is still smaller than the width <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back.</b> There is a strong anteroconid. A crest, the metalophid, reaches from the protoconid nearly to the metaconid. A small cusp, the mesostylid, is {{connected}} to the metaconid in front of it, unlike in Miopetaurista and Aliveria. There are two broad roots. The next tooth, m2, is similar to m1 in most respects, but the width at the front is virtually equal to the width <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back,</b> so that the tooth is about rectangular. The back of m3 is rounded, but the tooth is still nearly rectangular. There is a long anteroconid, with is mainly connected to the metaconid. There is no metalophid. This tooth has three roots: two at the front and a larger one <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{one of the}} {{earliest}} phylogenetic analyses of the group, Gardiner (1983) recognized five characteristics that made Temnospondyli a clade: a bone <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the skull, the parasphenoid, is connected to another bone {{on the underside of the}} skull, the pterygoid; large openings called interpterygoid vacuities are present between the pterygoids; the stapes (a bone involved in hearing) is connected to the parasphenoid and projects upward; the cleithrum, a bone in the pectoral girdle, is thin; and part of the vertebra called the interdorsal attaches to the neural arch. Additional features were given by Godfrey et al. (1987), including the contact between the postparietal and exoccipital <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the skull, small projections (uncinate processes) on the ribs, and a pelvic girdle with each side having a single iliac blade. These shared characteristics are called synapomorphies.|$|E

5|$|MACN Pv-RN 975, a {{fragment}} of the mandible (lower jaw) preserving one premolar, was discovered in 1991 and tentatively identified as Ferugliotherium by Kielan-Jaworowska and Bonaparte in 1996, but this assignment remains controversial. The poorly preserved and worn premolar is a bladelike tooth, resembling multituberculate fourth lower premolars (p4). The premolar is 4.8mm long and bears eight faint ridges on both the labial (towards the lips) and lingual (towards the tongue) sides. On the labial side, the four ridges <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> are more widely separated than the four in front of them. The back and front margins of the tooth are parallel {{and there is no}} small cusp on the labial side. There are two roots; the one at the front is larger than the one <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> and bears a furrow. The lower border of the enamel cover is marked by two semicircular extensions of the enamel on the front side, but there is only one such extension <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>back.</b> By its size, the number of ridges, and apparently greater length than height, it differs from all known multituberculate first, second, and third lower premolars, indicating that it is a p4.|$|E
