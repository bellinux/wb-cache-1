40|$|The present {{research}} was conducted {{in support of the}} NASA Safe <b>All-Weather</b> <b>Flight</b> <b>Operations</b> for Rotorcraft (SAFOR) program. The purpose of the work was to investigate the utility of two measurement tools developed by the British Defense Evaluation Research Agency. These tools were a subjective workload assessment scale, the DRA Workload Scale (DRAWS), and a situation awareness measurement tool in which the crews self-evaluation of performance is compared against actual performance. These two measurement tools were evaluated {{in the context of a}} test of an innovative approach to alerting the crew by way of a helmet mounted display. The DRAWS was found to be usable, but it offered no advantages over extant scales, and it had only limited resolution. The performance self-evaluation metric of situation awareness was found to be highly effective...|$|R
40|$|Proposed {{helicopter}} helmet mounted displays {{will be used}} {{to alert}} the pilot to a variety of conditions, from threats to equipment problems. The present research was performed under the NASA Safe <b>All-weather</b> <b>Flight</b> <b>Operations</b> Research (SAFOR) program supported by a joint Army/NASA research agreement. The purpose of the research was to examine ways to optimize the alerting effectiveness of helmet display symbology. The research used two approaches to increasing the effectiveness of alerts. One was to increase the ability of the alert to attract attention by using the entire display surface. The other was to include information about the required response in the alert itself. The investigation was conducted using the NASA Ames Research Center's six-degree-of-freedom vertical motion simulator (VMS) with a rotorcraft cockpit. Helmet display symbology was based on the AH- 64 's pilot night vision system (PNVS), cruise mode symbology. A standardized mission was developed, that consisted of 11 legs. The mission included four tasks, which allowed variation in the frequency of alerts. The general trend in the data points to a small benefit from both the full-screen alert and the partial information alert...|$|R

The purpose of the work was to investigate the utility of two measurement tools developed by the British Defense Evaluation Research Agency. These tools were a subjective workload assessment scale, the DRA Workload Scale and a situation awareness measurement tool. The situation awareness tool uses a comparison of the crew's self-evaluation of performance against actual performance in order to determine what information the crew attended to during the performance. These two measurement tools were evaluated {{in the context of a}} test of innovative approach to alerting the crew by way of a helmet mounted display. The situation assessment data are reported here. The performance self-evaluation metric of situation awareness was found to be highly effective. It was used to evaluate situation awareness on a tank reconnaissance task, a tactical navigation task, and a stylized task used to evaluated handling qualities. Using the self-evaluation metric, it was possible to evaluate situation awareness, without exact knowledge the relevant information in some cases and to identify information to which the crew attended or failed to attend in others...|$|R
40|$|An {{integrated}} flight controller, display, {{and power}} management system design, suitable for <b>all-weather</b> VTOL <b>flight</b> <b>operations</b> onto small ships, is described. The flight controller uncouples the aircraft's translational and attitude motions, which are then commanded by the pilot, through separate controls. A head-up display provides situation and flight director information sufficient to permit zero-zero landings. The system was applied to a VTOL transport model and simulated on moving base simulators at Ames Research Center. Presented herein are results concerning the aircraft's general handling qualities and, in particular, its handling qualities during IFR landings onto a moving ship...|$|R
50|$|The {{facility}} {{opened in}} June 1942 as Lockbourne Army Airfield (named after the nearby village of Lockbourne). It was then named the Northeastern Training Center of the Army Air Corps, and provided basic pilot training and military support. In addition, the training center provided B-17 flight training to the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASPs), {{and training for}} glider pilots in the CG-4A Waco glider. After the war, flight-training activities were halted and the airfield {{was used as a}} development and testing facility for <b>all-weather</b> military <b>flight</b> <b>operations.</b> The primary unit at the base was the all-Black 447th Composite Group, also known as the Tuskegee Airmen.|$|R

5000|$|The Buccaneer was a mid-wing, {{twin-engine}} monoplane; {{with a crew}} of two in a tandem-seat arrangement.
