5|$|Moe and Renee seem to form {{a strong}} relationship, but Moe is {{insecure}} about his hold on her and he feels he must spend {{large amounts of money}} so she will stay with him. Upon maxing out his credit card, Moe comes up with a scheme to commit insurance fraud by having Homer steal his car and park it on train tracks so it would be destroyed. The night the scheme is supposed to take place, Moe and Renee attend a police charity event aboard a yacht; the event's attendance by all the officers in town ensures Homer will not get caught perpetrating the scheme, and gives Moe an alibi so that no one will suspect he was behind the act. Homer botches the plan by stopping to watch a drive-in movie, while the train they were counting on to destroy Moe's car passes by. Deciding <b>all</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> lost, Homer drives the car over a cliff — but his attempt to exit the car before it sinks into the water below fails. The car ends up sinking just near the yacht where the police charity event is taking place, and when Homer swims to the surface, he is arrested.|$|E

Linzi is frustrated that he will miss his son's birthday party while giving a celebrity interview.

Elbryan and Pony, along with the small group of fighters they've formed, commence to mopping up the demon's army as best they can. Soon, though, they discover that their friend Bradwarden, who they thought was dead, is still alive and in the clutches of the Church.

As Lydia lives with him, the General, unaware of Wladimir's love for her, but wanting to be alone with Fatinitza, has promised Lydia in marriage to an old, crippled friend of his, who had the advantage of being available for marriage. He does not want to break his word to his friend, but when Wladimir announces he has promised his [...] "sister" [...] to one of his friends, the General agrees to break Lydia's betrothal if Wladimir will break Fatinitza's.|$|E
500|$|After days {{of celebration}} and {{recuperation}} the ship left Tromsø on 26 August. The voyage south was a triumphal procession, with receptions at every port.

Nansen and his crew were received by King Oscar; {{on the way to}} the reception they passed through a triumphal arch formed by 200gymnasts.

[...] Rich Rosell from DigitallyObsessed.com awarded the episode 4 out of 5 stars and wrote [...] "Get out your flowcharts to try and keep things straight, as we get to learn {{a little more about}} Cigarette Smoking Man and his hijinks, in this ep written by ol' smoky himself.

500|$|Although Stanton did {{not know}} who murdered Archie, she guessed {{that it could be}} Stacey Slater (which turned out to be correct). Speaking of this, she said that Sophie {{was one of the few}} to {{correctly}} guess it was Stacey. [...] "I had an epiphany about a week before the live episode. It was a memory of the whole Who Shot Phil? storyline, and how there were eight different suspects, including some really hard blokes, and it turned out to be Lisa. I knew DCI Marsden wasn’t going to get the culprit, because of a couple of scenes of the following episode we’d shot in December, and I thought that narratively, Stacey was the only person who the audience would forgive, and who could get away with it. That was my theory and it turned out to be right!" [...] Naomi Mcelroy from The Sunday Mirror thought that Marsden could be Archie's killer. Marsden left on 22 February 2010, and returned on 5 January 2012. She returned after Phil is framed for Kevin Wicks' (Phil Daniels)'s death and that of a homeless man, who died accidentally in a car-lot fire (part of an insurance scam). According to Inside Soap the police would begin questioning Phil's former fiancée Stella Crawford's death, teasing Marsden's return: [...] "The investigation is set to bring Phil face to face with his old nemisis, DCI Marsden – and this time she'll stop at nothing to put the bad boy permanently behind bars". Digital Spy reported that Marsden re-opens the investigation into Stella's death, [...] "suspecting that <b>all</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> what it seems". Finally, Marsden returned for two single episodes on 17 August 2012.|$|E
