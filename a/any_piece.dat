5|$|It is {{a long-standing}} practice, {{as with many}} Jesuit schools around the world, that pupils write A.M.D.G. in the top left hand corner of <b>any</b> <b>piece</b> of work they do. It stands for the Latin phrase Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam which means For the Greater Glory of God. At {{the end of a}} piece of work they write L.D.S. in the centre of the page. It stands for Laus Deo Semper which means Praise to God Always. These are both {{traditional}} Jesuit mottoes.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{forensic}} fields, forensic anthropologists {{are held}} to {{a high level of}} ethical standards due to their work in the legal system. Individuals who purposefully misrepresent themselves or <b>any</b> <b>piece</b> of evidence can be sanctioned, fined, or imprisoned by the appropriate authorities depending on the severity of the violation. Individuals who fail to disclose any conflict of interests or who fail to report all of their findings, regardless of what they may be, can face disciplinary actions. It is important that forensic anthropologists remain impartial during the course of an investigation. Any perceived bias during an investigation could hamper efforts in court to bring the responsible parties to justice.|$|E

5000|$|The knight (called ม้า ma, horse) moves like {{a knight}} in Western chess: two steps in one {{direction}} and then one step perpendicular to that movement. It jumps over <b>any</b> <b>pieces</b> in the way.|$|R
5|$|Shed Light was a crash {{development}} project, and {{was largely}} unguided. It was tasked with {{research and development}} of almost <b>any</b> <b>piece</b> of equipment that might help with the mission outlined in its charter. As a result, few of the programs came to fruition and fewer still left a definitive mark on the conflict. The developments under Shed Light were quickly eclipsed by new aircraft produced under Project Gunship (notably under Gunship II and Gunship III). They were fitted with many of the sensors developed under Shed Light, but took on a life all their own. Shed Light’s most visible programs, Black Spot and Tropic Moon, have largely fallen into obscurity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Any</b> <b>piece,</b> {{promoted}} or not, {{that captures}} a Deva or teaching king (a promoted Deva) promotes to a teaching king. This is effected by replacing {{it on the}} board with the captured piece. Similarly, <b>any</b> <b>piece</b> that captures a dark spirit or Buddhist spirit (a promoted dark spirit) promotes to a Buddhist spirit. The only exception is (potentially) royal pieces (emperors, kings, princes, and drunk elephants) which promote to their normal promoted forms, or stay as they are if already promoted.|$|E
25|$|Range capture: It {{can jump}} {{any number of}} pieces {{in one of the}} four {{orthogonal}} directions, as long as these do not include a royal (king or prince) or another range-capturing piece. <b>Any</b> <b>piece</b> it jumps over is removed from the board.|$|E
50|$|The Sacrifice Explorer finds games {{based on}} sacrificed {{material}} (<b>any</b> <b>pieces,</b> exchange sacrifice, attacks {{on a given}} square, by opening, by player, etc.) to locate instructive games and puzzle examples, while helping to increase tactical skill.|$|R
50|$|Students {{can wear}} <b>any</b> uniform <b>piece</b> with <b>any</b> other uniform <b>piece.</b> Students are {{required}} to wear a gold polo during sport and practical PDHPE classes.|$|R
5000|$|Shadow: Players must race {{to fill in}} a {{background}} image with Tetriminos, while not allowing <b>any</b> <b>pieces</b> to lie outside of the puzzle in the process. This mode features new Tetrimino shapes, {{and a total of}} 30 puzzles.|$|R
25|$|As with <b>any</b> <b>piece</b> of {{equipment}} {{that depends on}} coils to transfer heat between air and a fluid, {{it is important for}} both the condenser and evaporator coils to be kept clean. If deposits of dust and other debris are allowed to accumulate on the coils, the efficiency of the unit (both in heating and cooling modes) will suffer.|$|E
25|$|In {{emergency}} situations, {{a prescription}} pad {{may not be}} available. In this situation, <b>any</b> <b>piece</b> of paper will do, provided it is marked Periculum in mora!; that is, danger in delay (other designations, such as Cito! or Statim!, are also used and understood). Such ad-hoc prescriptions have a limited period of validity; typically, {{this is the day}} after the prescription is written.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, the Jumbo Company {{released}} several European variants, including a three- and four-player version, {{and a new}} Cannon piece (which jumps two squares to capture <b>any</b> <b>piece,</b> but loses to any attack against it). It also included some alternate rules such as Barrage (a quicker two-player game with fewer pieces) and Reserves (reinforcements in the three- and four-player games). The four-player version appeared in America in 1997.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Harry with a smile, [...] "you couldn't call it cutting. It has melted it, {{swallowed}} it, blotted {{it right}} out. You'll find {{very little of}} that root to-morrow, and there won't be <b>any</b> <b>pieces</b> lying round either." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Any</b> <b>pieces</b> of bark {{less than}} 106 mm long are {{categorized}} as quillings. Featherings are the inner bark of twigs and twisted shoots. Chips are trimmings of quills, outer and inner bark that cannot be separated, or {{the bark of}} small twigs.|$|R
50|$|Professor Sylvester-Bradley, Geology Dept Leicester University, {{confirmed}} that the fragments were from a chondrite and appealed for further specimens. Locals were requested not to wash <b>any</b> <b>pieces</b> found, but to wrap them in newspaper and hand in at the local police station.|$|R
25|$|Lumads have a {{traditional}} concept of land ownership {{based on what}} their communities consider their ancestral territories. The historian B. R. Rodil notes that ‘a territory occupied by a community is a communal private property, and community members have the right of usufruct to <b>any</b> <b>piece</b> of unoccupied land within the communal territory.’ Ancestral lands include cultivated land as well as hunting grounds, rivers, forests, uncultivated land and the mineral resources below the land.|$|E
25|$|The {{television}} licence fee. Within the State, it {{is necessary}} to pay a fee of €160 per annum to legally possess <b>any</b> <b>piece</b> of equipment capable of receiving television signals (not necessarily those of RTÉ). This money is collected by An Post on behalf of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. The state pays for TV Licence Inspectors who have the power to obtain and execute search warrants of private houses. Failure to possess a valid television licence can result in a fine and a criminal record.|$|E
25|$|Nishi {{proposed}} MSX as {{an attempt}} to create a single industry standard for home computers. Inspired by the success of VHS as a standard for video cassette recorders, many Japanese electronic manufacturers along with GoldStar, Philips and Spectravideo built and promoted MSX computers. <b>Any</b> <b>piece</b> of hardware or software with the MSX logo on it was compatible with MSX products of other manufacturers. In particular, the expansion cartridge form and function were part of the standard; any MSX expansion or game cartridge would work in any MSX computer.|$|E
50|$|The Queen Bee must {{be placed}} {{in one of the}} first four turns, and if a player's Queen Bee has not yet been placed, that player may not move <b>any</b> <b>pieces.</b> Therefore, it is {{generally}} preferable to place the Bee before being forced to do so on the fourth turn.|$|R
50|$|When all {{the pieces}} on the board have been captured, the player that has {{acquired}} the most points is the winner. However, if there are <b>any</b> <b>pieces</b> left on the board, then the player who could not perform their last turn is the loser, and the other player is the winner.|$|R
5000|$|A roll of 6, {{whether it}} is used to enter or move a piece, gives that player another roll. A second 6 gives the player a third roll. If the player rolls a third 6, <b>any</b> <b>pieces</b> moved by the first two 6's must return to their hangar and play passes to the next player.|$|R
25|$|Supply Chess Similar to the Western chess variant Bughouse Chess, this variant {{features}} {{the ability to}} re-deploy captured pieces, similar to a rule in shogi. Four players play as two-person teams in two side-by-side games. One teammate plays Black and other plays Red. <b>Any</b> <b>piece</b> obtained by capturing the opponent's piece {{is given to the}} teammate for use in the other game. These pieces can be deployed by the teammate to give him an advantage over the other player, so long as the piece starts on the player's own side of the board and does not cause the opponent to be in check.|$|E
25|$|A {{traditional}} organ console was {{not adequate}} {{to control a}} theatre organ, as {{the large number of}} draw knobs required made the console so huge an organist could not possibly reach all of them while playing. Thus, the horseshoe console was born. Based on a curved French console design and using stop tabs instead of drawknobs, the horseshoe console now allowed the organist to reach any stop or control while playing <b>any</b> <b>piece</b> of music, eliminating the need to move around awkwardly on the bench. The smaller stop tabs also permitted the addition of many more stops on the console than could be added on a traditional console.|$|E
25|$|This {{suggests}} that about 3% of all promotions are underpromotions. The frequency of truly significant underpromotions is, however, less than this. Note that the promoted piece {{does not have}} to be a piece that has previously been captured. A player may promote to <b>any</b> <b>piece</b> they wish, regardless of whether or not such a piece has been captured. In theory, a player could have nine queens, ten knights, ten bishops or ten rooks, though these are highly improbable scenarios. Some chess sets come with an extra queen of each color to use for promoted pawns. If an extra queen is unavailable, it is often represented by an upside-down rook instead.|$|E
5000|$|If his/her side of {{the board}} is empty, he/she must use five previously-won pieces to place one piece in each square on his/her side before repeating the distribution. (If he/she do not possess <b>any</b> <b>pieces,</b> he/she must borrow a piece from the other player and return it when {{counting}} the points {{at the end of}} the game.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{was good}} of old Joe. I wouldn't lend him 'Thunderbolt' for fear he'd hurt it. Couldn't have smashed it up better than I did, could he? Don't think I want <b>any</b> <b>pieces</b> {{to remind me}} of that fall. I just wish you'd seen us, mother! It must have been a splendid spill to look at, any way." ...|$|R

25|$|For a cannon, one of {{the most}} fatal {{formations}} is the exposed cannon (Chinese: 空心炮), where the cannon directly controls the middle file with no other pieces between the cannon and the general. This formation is particularly dangerous since the defensive side cannot move <b>any</b> <b>piece</b> in front of the cannon; while with an extra cannon joining the attack, mate can follow on the spot, and with an extra rook, the defensive side can mount a check followed by a windmill, often winning at least a piece afterwards. If the defensive side cannot chase the cannon away or capture it, it must move the general forward to avoid these threats, leaving the general vulnerable to attacks.|$|E
25|$|The {{centerpiece}} of the collection is Le Rêve, the Picasso portrait that was the working name of the resort project. Wynn purchased the painting from an anonymous collector in a private sale in 2001. In 2006 he reportedly was {{to sell it to}} Steven A. Cohen for $139 million, which would at that time have been the highest price paid for <b>any</b> <b>piece</b> of art. However, he put his elbow through the canvas while showing it to a group of guests—including the screenwriter Nora Ephron and her husband Nick Pileggi, the broadcaster Barbara Walters, the art dealer Serge Sorokko and his wife, the model Tatiana Sorokko, the New York socialite Louise Grunwald, and the lawyer David Boies and his wife, Mary.|$|E
25|$|Hertog Jan, a Dutch {{brand of}} beer, {{released}} Stratego Tournament, a promotional version of Stratego with variant rules. It includes substantially fewer pieces, including only one Bomb and no Miners. Since each side has only about 18 pieces, {{the pieces are}} far more mobile. The scout in this version is allowed to move three squares in any combination of directions (including L-shapes) {{and there is a}} new piece called the Archer, which is defeated by anything, but can defeat <b>any</b> <b>piece</b> other than the Bomb by shooting it from a two-square distance, in direct orthogonal, or straight, directions only. If one player is unable to move any more of his or her pieces, the game results in a tie because neither player's Flag was captured.|$|E
5000|$|Unblocking (allows move of {{the king}} or <b>any</b> other <b>piece</b> to the {{unblocked}} square) ...|$|R
50|$|Having all the {{requirements}} converted to behavior trees (RBTs) {{is similar to}} having all the pieces for a jigsaw puzzle randomly spread out on a table - until we put all the pieces together we cannot see the emergent picture and whether <b>any</b> <b>pieces</b> are missing or do not fit. Constructing an integrated behavior tree (IBT) allows us to do this.|$|R
5000|$|A special {{move was}} {{introduced}} called Guarding. This move {{is equal to}} castling but it is executed by queen and rook. For Guarding to be legal, both the queen and rook must never have made any previous moves, and {{there may not be}} <b>any</b> <b>pieces</b> between them. Attacks are irrelevant. Notation is [...] "S-S" [...] or [...] "S-S-S" [...] for queenside or kingside.|$|R
