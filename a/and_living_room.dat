In 1877 Glidden's daughter, Elva, married William H. Bush in the homestead.|$|E
5|$|The Great Hall, {{leading off}} from the corridor, was the most {{important}} communal eating <b>and</b> <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> but by the time Montacute was completed the traditional Great Hall was largely an anachronism. Such halls continued to be built, however, albeit as at Montacute on a smaller scale. For the first few years after its completion, the servants continued to dine in the hall, but the family and honoured guests now ate in the Great Chamber above. The hall now served as a room to receive and also for processions to commence to the grander rooms above.|$|E
5|$|The {{apartment}} block {{was not a}} gated complex. Located {{on the corner of}} Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva and Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins, 5A was accessible to the public from two sides. Sliding glass patio doors in the living room at the back overlooked the Ocean Club's pool, tennis courts, tapas restaurant and bar. The patio doors could be accessed via a public street, Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins, where a small gate and set of steps led to 5A's balcony <b>and</b> <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> 5A's front door was {{on the opposite side of}} the block from the Ocean Club, on Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva.|$|E

5|$|The current theatre {{opened on}} 28 April 1897. Herbert Beerbohm Tree built the theatre with profits from his {{tremendous}} {{success at the}} Haymarket Theatre, and he owned, managed and lived in the theatre from its construction {{until his death in}} 1917. For his personal use, he had a banqueting hall <b>and</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> installed in the massive, central, square French-style dome. This building did not specialise in opera, although there were some operatic performances in its early years. The theatre opened with a dramatisation of Gilbert Parker's The Seats of the Mighty. Adaptations of novels by Dickens, Tolstoy, and others formed {{a significant part of the}} repertoire, along with classical works from Molière and Shakespeare. The theatre also hosted the world premiere of J. M. Synge's The Tinker's Wedding on 11 November 1909 and George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion, with Tree as Henry Higgins and Mrs Patrick Campbell as Eliza, in 1914. Tree's productions were known for their elaborate and spectacular scenery and effects, often including live animals and real grass. These remained both popular and profitable, but in his last decade, Tree's acting style was seen as increasingly outmoded, and many of his plays received bad reviews. Tree defended himself from critical censure, demonstrating his continuing popularity at the box office until his death.|$|E

25|$|Gein {{held on to}} {{the farm}} and earned money from odd jobs. He boarded up rooms used by his mother, {{including}} the upstairs, downstairs parlor, <b>and</b> <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> leaving them untouched; {{while the rest of the}} house became increasingly squalid, these rooms remained pristine. Gein lived thereafter in a small room next to the kitchen. Around this time, he became interested in reading death-cult magazines and adventure stories, particularly those involving cannibals or Nazi atrocities.|$|E
25|$|The {{house has}} a classic Beaux-Arts plan, with the major public rooms on its ground floor – the central Elliptical Hall, Dining Room, <b>and</b> <b>Living</b> <b>Room</b> – all in one line, {{parallel}} to the Hudson River. North and South Foyers provide transitional space from the Hall to the Dining Room <b>and</b> <b>Living</b> <b>Room.</b> Five secondary spaces are located off the Elliptical Hall: the Lobby, Den, Gold Room, Grand Stair Hall, and Lavatory. The second floor rooms, comprising Mrs. Vanderbilt's suite of Bedroom, Boudoir and Bathroom (designed by Ogden Codman), Mr. Vanderbilt's Bedroom and Bathroom, Guest Bedrooms and Baths and the Linen Room, are disposed around the Second Floor Hall and the North and South Foyers. The third floor contains five additional guest bedrooms, and a Servants' Hall separated from the guests' rooms by a door at the main staircase. Supported by both concrete and steel, the Vanderbilt mansion was considered modern for its time. The mansion also included plumbing and forced hot air central heating and electric lighting which was powered by a hydroelectric plant built on the estate on the Crumb Elbow stream. The Vanderbilt estate had electric lighting before the surrounding area.|$|E
25|$|Local {{residents}} {{initiated the}} restoration of the building in the latter 20th century, which was opened in 1981 as the Casa de Cultura y Museo Gonzalo Carrasco. It contains eleven halls. Five halls are dedicated to pre-Hispanic pieces from the Aztec, Teotihuacan and Otomi cultures.

25|$|Mattapan {{is mainly}} {{made up of}} triple and double decker houses. Each {{apartment}} of the triple/double deckers consist of three bedrooms, kitchen, one bathroom <b>and</b> <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> They were designed to house small unit families. Mattapan also has a few apartment style buildings. Some of these {{can be found on}} River Street. Most apartment complexes have a maximum of three bedrooms. These apartments were built recently and an example of this is Mattapan Heights, which was an abandoned rehabilitation facility that was then turned into a gated community with major townhouse apartment styles. Other types of housing are ‘School Housing by Lower Mills’, these complexes are new development in the community.|$|E
25|$|A loom shop {{would either}} be built as an {{attached}} shed entered from outside or as a garret above the house entered through a trap-door from below or by external stairs to minimize disruption {{when a new}} beam was brought in. Animal fibres (wool, silk) did not need sizing so considerations of humidity were unimportant. It was usual for a loomshop to contain three or four looms which were worked {{by members of the}} family. In the house below was a kitchen and scullery <b>and</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> on the ground floor and two bedrooms on the first, a typical two-up-two-down cottage. Sometimes a row of cottages would have a common loom-shop above, allowing several looms to be worked.|$|E
25|$|The large {{profits in}} the North Carolina {{furniture}} industry lessened with {{the increasing number of}} factories. In addition to the increased competition for market shares, by 1910 the salary for competent experienced workers and rising shipping costs had cut further into the profit. Bankruptcies resulted from inexperienced managers who tried to sell products below the cost of production and companies that tried to expand too quickly. An innovative High Point company, Tomlinson Chair Co., devised incentives to give its workforce an opportunity to receive part of the profits. The company {{was one of the first}} to manufacture quality period reproduction dining <b>and</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> furniture on a large scale; an employee who exceeded a monthly quota received a percentage bonus. All workers received a life insurance policy as well.|$|E

25|$|In Africa, {{since the}} {{beginning}} of the 1990s, the development of middle-class suburbs boomed. Due to the industrialization of many African countries, particularly in cities such as Cairo, Johannesburg and Lagos, the middle class has grown. In an illustrative case of South Africa, RDP housing has been built. In much of Soweto, many houses are American in appearance, but are smaller, and often consist of a kitchen <b>and</b> <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> two or three bedrooms, and a bathroom. However, there are more affluent neighborhoods, more comparable to American suburbs, particularly east of the FNB Stadium. In Cape Town there is a distinct European style which is due to the European influence during the mid-1600s when the Dutch conquered the area. Houses like these are called Cape Dutch Houses and can be found in the affluent suburbs of Constantia and Bishopscourt.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to other popular comedies {{of the era}} (such as Father Knows Best, Leave It to Beaver, and The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet), which depicted their characters in comfortable, middle class suburban environments, the set design for The Honeymooners reflected the blue collar existence of its characters. The Kramdens lived in a small, painfully sparsely furnished two-room apartment (the main set) in a tenement building at least four stories high (the Kramdens were {{on the third floor}} and the Nortons' were one floor above them), badly aired and with insufficient lighting. They used the single main room as the kitchen, dining <b>and</b> <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> It consisted of a functional table and chairs, a plain chest of drawers, a curtainless window with a view of a fire escape, a noisy sink, and an outdated icebox. The Kramdens' bedroom never was seen, although in the episode about Ed Norton's sleepwalking the Nortons' bedroom is. One of the few other sitcoms about a blue collar family was The Life of Riley, whose first season (1949–50) had featured Jackie Gleason in the lead role, although veteran movie actor William Bendix, who had originated the role of Chester A. Riley on the radio show, thereafter took over the role on television.|$|E
