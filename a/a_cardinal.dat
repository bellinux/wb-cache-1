5|$|Several duties are {{performed}} by the Dean of the College of Cardinals, who is always <b>a</b> <b>Cardinal</b> Bishop. If the Dean is not entitled {{to participate in the}} conclave owing to age, his place is taken by the Sub-Dean, who is also always <b>a</b> <b>Cardinal</b> Bishop. If the Sub-Dean also cannot participate, the senior Cardinal Bishop participating performs the functions.|$|E
5|$|As <b>a</b> <b>cardinal,</b> Paul had {{previously}} maintained neutrality between {{the great powers}} of Spain and France that had dominated the previous conclave and {{were present in the}} current one as well. While he had been the papal envoy to Spain and was receiving a pension from them, he was largely low profile as <b>a</b> <b>cardinal</b> and perceived as neutral. At 52, Paul was young {{at the time of his}} election, and was anticipated to have a lengthy papacy, not requiring a third conclave soon.|$|E

5|$|The Cardinal {{protector}} of England was an appointed crown-cardinal of England from 1492 until 1539. <b>A</b> <b>cardinal</b> protector is {{the representative of}} a Roman Catholic nation or organisation within the College of Cardinals, appointed by the pope. The role was terminated {{as a result of}} the English Reformation.|$|E
5|$|Gebhard's {{grandfather}} {{had been a}} commander for the Swabian League army in 1531; a cousin of his grandfather, Jörg Truchsess von Waldburg, also known as Bauernjörg, had been a commander of the imperial army in the Peasant Wars (1525). His uncle, Otto (1514–73), was the bishop of Augsburg, later <b>a</b> <b>Cardinal,</b> and founded University of Dillingen in Augsburg. His younger brother, Karl (1548–1593), trained for a military career; a second younger brother, Ferdinand, died at the siege at 's-Hertogenbosch in 1585.|$|E
5|$|He {{obtained}} benefices in {{the diocese}} of Glasgow and {{the diocese of}} Brechin, {{as well as in}} Ross, and served as the chaplain to <b>a</b> <b>cardinal</b> before being appointed Bishop of Ross by papal provision in 1295. After some delay, he was able to take up his position and held it until his death in early 1325.|$|E

5|$|Leo was 70 at {{the time}} of his {{election}} and, though in good health previously, fell ill on the day of his coronation. He died on 27 April 1605, 26 days after his election to the papacy.

5|$|Manutius {{at first}} printed works only in Greek. His first {{printing}} in the Latin alphabet, in February 1496 (1495 by the Venetian calendar), {{was a book}} entitled Petri Bembi de Aetna Angelum Chabrielem liber. This book, usually now called De Aetna, was a short 60-page text about a journey to Mount Etna, written by the young Italian humanist poet Pietro Bembo, who would later become <b>a</b> <b>Cardinal,</b> secretary to Pope Leo X and lover of Lucrezia Borgia.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} other {{disagreements}} existed, such as the papal income tax and the refusal of the pope to create John Morton, the archbishop of Canterbury, a cardinal; Innocent VII had passed over Morton in his first consistory, despite creating two French cardinals. Nor had John Sherwood, the English ambassador in Rome, been created <b>a</b> <b>cardinal</b> in 1484, despite the request of King Richard III. Piccolomini's creation as cardinal protector was requested by Henry VII in a letter congratulating the newly elected Pope Alexander VI, and was confirmed in a response which was probably written by Giovanni Gigli.|$|E

5|$|Albani {{was created}} <b>a</b> <b>cardinal</b> deacon in 1690 by Alexander VIII, {{but he did}} not {{received}} ordination to the priesthood until shortly before the conclave began. Albani was not a bishop, and had to receive episcopal consecration after his election before he could be crowned pope. Albani had been elected on the feast day of Pope Clement I, and took the name of Clement XI to honour the saint. At fifty-one, Albani was younger than any other pope who had been elected in almost two centuries. Albani was the candidate of the zelanti in this conclave, and his election represented a success for them.|$|E
5|$|Although in {{the past}} {{cardinal}} electors could be accompanied by attendants ("conclavists"), now only a nurse may accompany <b>a</b> <b>cardinal</b> who for reasons of ill-health, as confirmed by the Congregation of Cardinals, needs such assistance. The Secretary of the College of Cardinals, the Master of Papal Liturgical Celebrations, two Masters of Ceremonies, two officers of the Papal Sacristy and an ecclesiastic assisting the Dean of the College of Cardinals are also admitted to the conclave. Priests are available to hear confessions in different languages; two doctors are also admitted. Finally, a strictly limited number of servant staff are permitted for housekeeping and the preparing and serving of meals.|$|E
5|$|Antipope John XXIII had a {{complicated}} life, legacy, and {{relationship with the}} city of Florence. Baldassare Cossa was a Neapolitan nobleman who grew up in Bologna. Pope Boniface IX elevated Cossa to the Archdiocese of Bologna in 1396 and made him <b>a</b> <b>cardinal</b> in 1402. After the Council of Pisa in 1409, Cossa encouraged rebellion against Pope Gregory XII, who refused to resign. Cossa was deprived of his cardinalate, but it was restored by Antipope Alexander V, who had been elected by the council.|$|E

5|$|During Spring Training {{before the}} 2017 season, the final {{guaranteed}} year on Molina's contract, the Cardinals began {{to negotiate a}} contract extension that would attempt to keep Molina in St. Louis {{for the remainder of}} his career. He agreed to a three-year contract extension for a reported $60 million, making him the highest-paid catcher in baseball. He wasn't interested in exercising his 2018 mutual option, which would have been worth $15 million. The extension assures Molina of remaining in St. Louis through 2020, and increases the chances that he will finish his career having played for just one organization, the one that drafted him. This distinction of having Molina retire as <b>a</b> <b>Cardinal</b> is something that carried weight for both parties throughout the negotiations.|$|E
5|$|From {{her first}} sight of Florida, Stowe was greatly impressed. In Palmetto Leaves, she sings the praises of Florida in January as a {{beautiful}} land capable of producing superior citrus and flowers. In several letters Stowe describes the abundant plant life in the area, dedicating a chapter to yellow jessmines (Gelsemium sempervirens) and another to magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora) flowers. She details watching sugarcane pressed into sugar crystals, going visiting with her elderly and obstinate mule named Fly, and discovering the myriad things {{to find in the}} woods and what can be made of them. She also keeps <b>a</b> <b>cardinal</b> (Cardinalis cardinalis) in a cage and four cats, but sadly reports later in the year that all four cats have died, to the relief and joy of Phœbus the cardinal.|$|E
5|$|Henry's reign {{also saw}} {{the rise of the}} Guise brothers, Charles, who became <b>a</b> <b>cardinal,</b> and Henry's boyhood friend Francis, who became Duke of Guise. Their sister Mary of Guise had married James V of Scotland in 1538 and was the mother of Mary, Queen of Scots. At the age of five and a half, Mary was brought to the French court, where she was promised to the Dauphin, Francis. Catherine brought her up with her own {{children}} at the French court, while Mary of Guise governed Scotland as her daughter's regent.|$|E

5|$|In {{the western}} churches, the mitre was placed above the shield of all persons who were {{entitled}} to wear the mitre, including abbots. It substituted for the helmet of military arms, but also appeared as a crest placed atop a helmet, as was common in German heraldry. In the Anglican Churches, the mitre is still placed above the arms of bishops and not an ecclesiastical hat. In the Roman Catholic Church, {{the use of the}} mitre above the shield on the personal arms of clergy was suppressed in 1969, and is now found only on some corporate arms, like those of dioceses. Previously, the mitre was often included under the hat, and even in the arms of <b>a</b> <b>cardinal,</b> the mitre was not entirely displaced.|$|E
5|$|The Master himself may remain, as may one ecclesiastic {{designated}} by the Congregations prior to the commencement of the election. The ecclesiastic makes a speech concerning the problems facing the Church and on the qualities the new pope needs to have. After the speech concludes, the ecclesiastic leaves. Following the recitation of prayers, the Cardinal Dean asks if any doubts relating to procedure remain. After the clarification of the doubts, the election may commence. Cardinals who arrive after the conclave has begun are admitted nevertheless. An ill cardinal may leave the conclave and later be readmitted; <b>a</b> <b>cardinal</b> who leaves for any reason other than illness may {{not return to the}} conclave.|$|E
5|$|The Renaissance {{began in}} times of {{religious}} turmoil. The late Middle Ages {{was a period of}} political intrigue surrounding the Papacy, culminating in the Western Schism, in which three men simultaneously claimed to be true Bishop of Rome. While the schism was resolved by the Council of Constance (1414), a resulting reform movement known as Conciliarism sought to limit the power of the pope. Although the papacy eventually emerged supreme in ecclesiastical matters by the Fifth Council of the Lateran (1511), it was dogged by continued accusations of corruption, most famously in the person of Pope Alexander VI, who was accused variously of simony, nepotism and fathering four children (most of whom were married off, presumably for the consolidation of power) while <b>a</b> <b>cardinal.</b>|$|E
