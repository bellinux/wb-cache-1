40|$|This {{research}} {{examined the}} performance of three parametric methods for confidence intervals: the classical, the Bonferroni, and the bootstrap-t method, as applied to estimating the mean of voucher populations in accounting. Usually <b>auditing</b> <b>populations</b> do not follow standard models. The <b>population</b> for accounting <b>audits</b> generally is a nonstandard mixture distribution in which the audit data set contains {{a large number of}} zero values and a comparatively small number of nonzero errors. This study assumed a situation in which only overstatement errors exist. The nonzero errors were assumed to be normally, exponentially, and uniformly distributed. Five indicators of performance were used. The classical method was found to be unreliable. The Bonferroni method was conservative for all population conditions. The bootstrap-t method was excellent in terms of reliability, but the lower limit of the confidence intervals produced by this method was unstable for all population conditions. The classical method provided the shortest average width of the confidence intervals among the three methods. This study provided initial evidence as to how the parametric bootstrap-t method performs when applied to the nonstandard distribution of <b>audit</b> <b>populations</b> of line items. Further research should provide a reliable confidence interval for a wider variety of accounting populations...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{compares the}} audit quality of Arthur Andersen {{with that of}} the Big 4 {{accounting}} firms. An expanded indicator of audit quality is developed based on the law of business misconduct literature and the legal process literature. A representation of audit quality is derived from an analysis of the legal actions initiated against these five large public accounting firms from 1996 to 2004. The legal action was partitioned into three year periods. In the first period, Arthur Andersen and the Big 4 evidenced no quality differential. In the second and third periods, the Big 4, in aggregate, rated higher on the audit quality indicator than did Andersen. The robustness of these findings is substanti-ated using multiple logistic regression and sensitivity analysis. When the individual firms are compared with Andersen, all four evidenced higher audit quality; three of the firms are significantly higher. This suggests that Andersen represents an outlier within the <b>audit</b> <b>population.</b> However, the analysis also indicates that overall audit quality declined in the period immediately following the passage of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. This suggests that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act provisions directed toward remedying auditing deficiencies is justified and not an overreaction to a ‘‘few bad apples. ’...|$|E
40|$|Flatfoot {{is often}} {{asymptomatic}} but sometimes presents with symptoms, even in children. This thesis aimed to discover {{if there was}} a difference between children with and without symptoms, in the hope that this might aid treatment decisions. Firstly, an audit was performed to discover the prevalence and type of symptoms, as well as current treatment protocols. Secondly, 107 volunteers from the general population and 20 patients were assessed in more detail. The participants were divided into groups and ANOVA tests were used to find the significant differences. Pain and parental concern were frequently reported in the <b>audit</b> <b>population.</b> The majority of this population had moderate bilateral flexible flatfoot with an active Windlass mechanism and static heel valgus. Treatment was dependent on department. The symptomatic group displayed reduced passive ankle dorsiflexion indicating tightness of the tendo-Achilles, as well as increased frequency of severe knee hyperextension and knee valgus upon clinical examination. During static stance, three differences were found between symptomatic and asymptomatic groups, two differences between flat feet and neutral feet. During dynamic trials, the symptomatic group showed reduced stride length and percentage time spent in swing. The ground reaction profiles showed differences in early and late stance. Further investigation supported the idea that decreased late stance vertical ground reaction force peak was evidence of instability in the symptomatic group. Four kinematic parameters demonstrated significant differences at foot strike, five at midstance, and seven at foot off. In terms of kinetics, after controlling for relative stride length, four differences were found, but none between the asymptomatic and symptomatic flat feet. Plantar pressure was successfully used to estimate truncated foot length. The flat feet did not display increased peak midfoot pressure; it was actually lower in flat footed groups. Arch Index and Modified Arch Index were successfully used for instantaneous and continuous assessment of foot posture over stance. The differences found between symptomatic and asymptomatic flat feet (particularly at foot off) shed some light upon the potential causes of symptoms.

40|$|Abstract Background Continuity of care is {{essential}} for good quality diabetes management. We recently found that 46 % of patients defaulted from care (had no contact with the clinic for 18  months after a follow-up appointment was ordered) in a Canadian multidisciplinary tertiary care diabetes clinic. The primary aim was to compare characteristics, diabetes processes of care, and outcomes from referral to within 1  year after leaving clinic or {{to the end of}} the follow-up period among those patients who defaulted, were discharged or were retained in the clinic. Methods Retrospective cohort study of 193 patients referred to the Foustanellas Endocrine and Diabetes Center (FEDC) for type 2 diabetes from January 1, 2005 to June 30, 2005. The FEDC is the primary academic referral centre for the Ottawa Region and provides multidisciplinary diabetes management. Defaulters (mean age 58. 5 [*]±[*] 12. 5  year, 60 % M) were compared to patients who were retained in the clinic (mean age 61. 4 [*]±[*] 10. 47  years, 49 % M) and those who were formally discharged (mean age 61. 5 [*]±[*] 13. 2  years, 53. 3 % M). The chart <b>audit</b> <b>population</b> was then individually linked on an individual patient basis for laboratory testing, physician visits billed through OHIP, hospitalizations and emergency room visits using Ontario health card numbers to health administrative data from the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care at the Institute for Clinical and Evaluative Sciences (ICES). Results Retained and defaulted patients had significantly longer duration of diabetes, more microvascular complications, were more likely to be on insulin and less likely to have a HbA 1 c[*]<[*] 7. 0 % than patients discharged from clinic. A significantly lower proportion of patients who defaulted from tertiary care received recommended monitoring for their diabetes (HbA 1 c measurements, lipid measurements, and periodic eye examinations), despite no difference in median number of visits to a primary care provider (PCP). Emergency room visits were numerically higher in the defaulters group. Conclusions Patients defaulting from a tertiary care diabetes hospital do not receive the recommended monitoring for their diabetes management despite attending PCP appointments. Efforts should be made to minimize defaulting in this group of individuals...|$|E

The objective of this study is to extend the research concerning the relationship between environmental factors and error occurrence by examining the impact of organizational ownership (foreign subsidiaries in Hong Kong vs. local Chinese companies) on error characteristics. The second objective of this study is to examine the empirical characteristics of errors in an emerging economy, Hong Kong, with references to relevant U. S. studies. Hong Kong is part of the Chinese Economic Area, a Big Emerging Market identified by the U. S. Department of Commerce. In the past two decades, while there have been numerous empirical studies on error characteristics for U. S. audit data, there is a scarcity of such studies using non-U. S. data.

30|$|Heavy menstrual {{bleeding}} is {{a common}} presenting complaint and can significantly {{affect the quality of}} life of affected women. The 2007 National Institute for Clinical Excellence guideline on heavy menstrual bleeding states that in women with heavy menstrual bleeding alone, endometrial ablation should be considered preferable to hysterectomy. The choice of the type of endometrial ablation procedure would depend on several factors including the availability of first-, second- or even third-generation endometrial ablation equipment, clinician experience and preference as well as patient choice and if procedure is intended to be performed as an office procedure without the use of general anaesthetic where second- or third-generation endometrial ablation equipment would be used. The number of first-generation endometrial ablation procedures being performed is expected to decrease over time. This is as a result of clinicians’ preference, due to reported higher operative complication rates in some studies, even though a meta-analysis of individual patient data has found it to be as effective as the second-generation techniques for heavy menstrual bleeding. We performed a retrospective clinical audit to investigate the trend from January 1995 to December 2005 in the use of first-generation endometrial ablation techniques performed at a district general hospital in the UK. We found that the general trend is of a rapidly decreasing number of first-generation endometrial ablation procedures being performed. We also found that the operative complication rates are low and similar to rates in the published literature. The long-term hysterectomy rate after first-generation endometrial ablation procedure in our <b>audit</b> <b>population</b> is also low and similar to the rates in the published literature. We conclude from our audit data that first-generation endometrial ablation techniques such as trans-cervical resection of the endometrium for heavy menstrual bleeding are effective and in experienced hands have fairly low operative complication rates and long-term hysterectomy rates. These are similar to rates in the published literature for second-generation endometrial ablation techniques. We recommend that until further larger scale randomised controlled trials comparing first generation and the newer second-generation endometrial ablation techniques are performed which would provide clinicians with better evidence, first-generation endometrial ablation equipment should not yet be condemned to gather dust in hospital storage facilities and become ‘museum pieces’. Rather, a concerted effort must be made to increase training opportunities in the use of first-generation endometrial ablation techniques especially in institutions that have already made the financial investment and are in possession of perfectly functioning equipment. This would ensure that the valuable clinical skill in the use of available first-generation endometrial ablation technique is not lost over time.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUNDS: AUDIPOC is a {{nationwide}} clinical audit {{that describes the}} characteristics, interventions and outcomes of patients admitted to Spanish hospitals because of an exacerbation of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (ECOPD), assessing the compliance of these parameters with current international guidelines. The present study describes hospital resources, hospital factors related to case recruitment variability, patients' characteristics, and adherence to guidelines. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: An organisational database was completed by all participant hospitals recording resources and organisation. Over an 8 -week period 11, 564 consecutive ECOPD admissions to 129 Spanish hospitals covering 70 % of the Spanish population were prospectively identified. At hospital discharge, 5, 178 patients (45 % of eligible) were finally included, and thus constituted the <b>audited</b> <b>population.</b> <b>Audited</b> patients were reassessed 90 days after admission for survival and readmission rates. A wide variability was observed in relation to most variables, hospital adherence to guidelines, and readmissions and death. Median inpatient mortality was 5 % (across-hospital range 0 - 35 %). Among discharged patients, 37 % required readmission (0 - 62 %) and 6. 5 % died (0 - 35 %). The overall mortality rate was 11. 6 % (0 - 50 %). Hospital size and complexity and aspects related to hospital COPD awareness were significantly associated with case recruitment. Clinical management most often complied with diagnosis and treatment recommendations but rarely (< 50 %) addressed guidance on healthy life-styles. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The AUDIPOC study highlights the large across-hospital variability in resources and organization of hospitals, patient characteristics, process of care, and outcomes.
