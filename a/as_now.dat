5|$|Between {{the newly}} conquered Mongol {{territory}} and Pagan were a wide swath of borderlands stretching from present-day Dehong, Baoshan and Lincang prefectures in Yunnan {{as well as}} the Wa and Palaung regions (presumably in present-day northern Shan State), which Pagan and Dali had both claimed and exercised overlapping spheres of influence.

They did not see that capital could not pay wages, buy raw material and manufacture goods unless it could sell its products and get returns. And if a few more intelligent did see these things the pressure of hungry wives and children obscured all reason and they were ready to go along on anything that offered a shadow of relief.|$|E

5|$|In early cricket, {{there were}} two umpires <b>as</b> <b>now,</b> but the modern square-leg umpire stood close to the striker's wicket.

Tarr was not at his best and it was to be his last international appearance. England, meanwhile, only managed a 3–0 victory, but it was enough to regain the Calcutta Cup and earn its first Grand Slam.|$|E

The City was surrounded by a ring of inner suburbs where most Londoners lived.

Then, <b>as</b> <b>now,</b> such a large and remote charge invited pluralism and non-residence. There was, at this time, a comparatively small amount in tithes, but the rector was nonetheless equivalent in substance to an abbot, owing to the ownership of extensive lands by Frankalmoin tenure.|$|E

5|$|The company's {{repertory}} in the 1960s {{combined the}} standard operatic works and less familiar pieces. The five composers whose works were given most frequently were Verdi, Puccini, Wagner, Mozart and Richard Strauss; {{the next most}} performed composer was Britten. Rarities performed in the 1960s included operas by Handel and Janáček (neither composer's works being as common in the opera house then <b>as</b> <b>now),</b> and works by Gluck (Iphigénie en Tauride), Poulenc (The Carmelites), Ravel (L'heure espagnole) and Tippett (King Priam). There was also a celebrated production of Schoenberg's Moses and Aaron in the 1965–66 and 1966–67 seasons. In the mainstream repertoire, a highlight of the decade was Franco Zeffirelli's production of Tosca in 1964 with Callas, Renato Cioni and Gobbi. Among the guest conductors who appeared at Covent Garden during the 1960s were Otto Klemperer, Pierre Boulez, Claudio Abbado and Colin Davis. Guest singers included Jussi Björling, Mirella Freni, Sena Jurinac, Irmgard Seefried and Astrid Varnay.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} rebuilt {{in the early}} 1930s to enable the line to be four-tracked. The ornate {{buildings}} were demolished, and were replaced by more austere buildings on two island platforms between the tracks, including two waiting rooms, ticket and parcel offices. The new station was completed on 30 April 1932 and was accessed, <b>as</b> <b>now,</b> by a subway from Fraser Street. The station employed 15 men in 1938. There was a 74 lever signal box {{to the east of}} the northern platform, and also a small siding to serve local coal merchants.|$|E
5|$|Then <b>as</b> <b>now,</b> Madagascar was an island, having {{separated}} from the Indian subcontinent less than 20 million years earlier. It was drifting northwards but still 10–15° more southerly in latitude than it is today. The prevailing climate of the time was semi-arid, with pronounced seasonality in temperature and rainfall. Majungasaurus inhabited a coastal flood plain cut by many sandy river channels. Strong geological evidence suggests the occurrence of periodic debris flows through these channels {{at the beginning of}} the wet season, burying the carcasses of organisms killed during the preceding dry season and providing for their exceptional preservation as fossils. Sea levels in the area were rising throughout the Maastrichtian, and would continue to do so into the Paleocene Epoch, so Majungasaurus may have roamed coastal environments like tidal flats as well. The neighboring Berivotra Formation represents the contemporaneous marine environment.|$|E

5|$|El Salvador {{hosted the}} 2007 UNCAF Nations Cup. The tournament changed formats, {{now to a}} two–round system with a group stage {{followed}} by a knockout–style competition for the remaining four teams. There were still two groups and the top two teams still advanced from each group for the first round. El Salvador topped their group with wins over Belize (2–1), Nicaragua (2–1), and a draw with Guatemala (0–0). In the semifinals El Salvador lost to the eventual champions Costa Rica 0–1. In the third place playoff they lost 0–1 to Guatemala but nonetheless qualified for the 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup (<b>as</b> <b>now</b> 5 Central American teams qualified for the Gold Cup). The team was coached by Carlos de los Cobos. At the 2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup they were drawn into four–team Group B with Guatemala, Trinidad and Tobago, and the United States. They defeated Trinidad and Tobago 2–1 in their opening match with goals from Ramón Sánchez (38') and Dennis Alas (81'), but this was their only win of the tournament. They lost the following two matches against Guatemala 0–1 and United States 0–4 and exited the tournament.|$|E
5|$|The {{defining}} {{factor in}} the geography of Scotland is {{the distinction between the}} Highlands and Islands in the north and west and the Lowlands in the south and east. The Highlands are further divided into the Northwest Highlands and the Grampian Mountains by the fault line of the Great Glen. The Lowlands are divided into the fertile belt of the Central Lowlands and the higher terrain of the Southern Uplands, which included the Cheviot hills, over which, <b>as</b> <b>now,</b> the border with England runs. The Central Lowland belt averages about 50 miles in width and, because it contains most of the good quality agricultural land and has easier communications, could support most of the urbanisation and elements of conventional government. However, the Southern Uplands, and particularly the Highlands, were economically less productive and much more difficult to govern. The Uplands and Highlands had a relatively short growing season and, in the extreme case of the upper Grampians, this was an ice free season of four months or less and for much of the Highlands and Uplands of seven months or less. The early modern era also saw the impact of the Little Ice Age, of worldwide colder and wetter weather, which peaked {{towards the end of the}} seventeenth century. In 1564 there were thirty-three days of continual frost, and rivers and lochs froze. The 1690s marked its lowest point, leading to the Seven ill years of famine.|$|E
