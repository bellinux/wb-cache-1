5|$|After {{the success}} of Hamasaki's January 1999 studio album <b>A</b> <b>Song</b> <b>for</b> ××, she began writing songs for her next studio album.

This transition into mainstream dance music made Hamasaki recruit new composers and producers for the then-upcoming studio album, including Japanese dance band HΛL, Do As Infinity member and composer Dai Nagao, and Kazuhito Kikuchi, amongst others.|$|E

Harmony said that no matter what song Rihanna released as a lead single from the album, it would be looked at as a song about Brown.|$|E

5|$|Walton's orchestral {{works of}} the 1960s include his Second Symphony (1960), Variations on a Theme by Hindemith (1963), Capriccio burlesco (1968), and Improvisations on an Impromptu of Benjamin Britten (1969). His song cycles from this period were {{composed}} for Peter Pears (Anon. in Love, 1960) and Schwarzkopf (<b>A</b> <b>Song</b> <b>for</b> the Lord Mayor's Table, 1962). He was commissioned to compose a score for the 1969 film Battle of Britain, but the film company rejected most of his score, replacing it with music by Ron Goodwin. A concert suite of Walton's score was published and recorded after Walton's death. After his experience over Battle of Britain, Walton declared that he would write no more film music, but he was persuaded by Olivier to compose the score for a film of Chekhov's Three Sisters in 1969.|$|E

5|$|With Ayu-mi-x (March 1999), {{the first}} of a series of remix albums, Hamasaki began moving beyond the pop-rock of <b>A</b> <b>Song</b> <b>for</b> ×× and began to {{incorporate}} different styles including trance, dance, and orchestra. Hamasaki began to experiment with different musical styles in her singles as well, releasing dance tunes and ballads as well as remixes on the singles which spanned reggae and house. The singles were milestones: Hamasaki earned her first number-one single ("") and first million-selling single ("A"). Her second studio album, Loveppears (November 1999), not only topped the Oricon charts, it sold nearly 3 million copies. The album also showcased a change in Hamasaki's lyrics.
