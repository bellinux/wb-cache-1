40|$|Abstract- Wireless sensor {{networks}} (WSN) are {{an increasingly}} attractive means {{to bridge the}} gap between the physical and virtual world. WSNs are envisioned to be used to fulfill complex monitoring tasks. Space and time play a crucial role in wireless sensor networks, since sensor nodes are used to collaboratively monitor physical phenomena and their space-time properties. A number of techniques and distributed algorithms for <b>location</b> <b>estimation</b> and time synchronization have been developed specifically for sensor networks. There are many similarities in space and time domains. This <b>affects</b> the <b>location</b> <b>estimation</b> and time synchronization, ranging from applications and requirements to basic approaches and concrete algorithmic techniques. An improved approach for space and time localization in WSNs is given in this paper. The main aspect of the algorithm is the use of a mobile beacon for both localization and synchronization. A mobile beacon is a node that moves around the sensor’s field and it is aware of its time and position, equipped with a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver. The synchronization component uses the packets required by the positioning component to improve its performance. The positioning component benefits from the communication, required by the synchronization component to decrease errors. A set of experiments and simulations are presented to evaluate the performance of the algorithm in order to reduce communication and processing resources and save energy and network resources.

30|$|Estimation of the {{impedance}} to {{the fault}} point {{is influenced by}} the series compensation (Vyas et al. 2014 a, b). Series compensation <b>affects</b> the fault <b>location</b> <b>estimation</b> in an unpredictable manner. Most of the reactance-based topologies suffer from mal-operation under reach due to DC offset current. Also, these schemes require measurement from both ends if the transmission line is having two end sources. In addition, the problem gets worse if the overvoltage protection of a series capacitor starts to operate due to high fault currents introducing nonlinearities in the measurement (Hosny and Safiuddin 2009). All of these nonlinear behavior due to series capacitor and its protection contributes to the distortion in phase voltage and line current waveforms. So, false tripping and mal-operation of circuit breakers is dominant due to series compensation. Hence conventional impedance based protection systems are most likely to malfunction (Hosny and Safiuddin 2009).|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In recent years, {{wireless}} <b>location</b> <b>estimation</b> {{has attracted}} {{a significant amount of}} attention in different areas. The network-based <b>location</b> <b>estimation</b> schemes have been widely adopted based on the radio signals between the mobile station (MS) and the base stations (BSs). The two-step Least Square (LS) method has been studied in related research to provide efficient <b>location</b> <b>estimation</b> of the MS. However, the algorithm results in inaccurate <b>location</b> <b>estimation</b> under the circumstances with poor geometric dilution of precision (GDOP). In this paper, the GDOP-assisted <b>location</b> <b>estimation</b> (GOLE) schemes are proposed by considering the geometric relationships between the MS and its associated BSs. According to the minimal GDOP criterion, the BSs are fictitiously repositioned and are served as a new set of BSs within the formulation of the two-step LS algorithm. The proposed GOLE schemes can both preserve the computational efficiency from the two-step LS method and obtain precise <b>location</b> <b>estimation</b> under poor GDOP environments. Comparing with other existing schemes, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed GOLE algorithms can achieve better accuracy in wireless <b>location</b> <b>estimation.</b> Index Terms—Wireless <b>location</b> <b>estimation,</b> geometric dilution of precision (GDOP), time-of-arrival (TOA).

The complexity and smaller {{scale of the}} indoor environment impose {{a great impact on}} <b>location</b> <b>estimation.</b> The key of <b>location</b> <b>estimation</b> lies in the representation and fusion of uncertain information from multiple sources. The improvement of <b>location</b> <b>estimation</b> is a complicated and comprehensive issue. A lot of research has been done to address this issue.

The performance of <b>location</b> <b>estimation</b> technology can be increased by refining the existing <b>location</b> <b>estimation</b> technologies. A better way of increasing {{performance is}} to use multiple technologies and combine the available data provided by {{them in order to}} obtain better results. Also, maintaining one's location privacy while using <b>location</b> <b>estimation</b> technology is a challenge. How can this problem be solved? In order {{to make it easier to}} perform sensor fusion on the available data and to speed up development, a flexible framework centered around a component-based architecture was designed. In order to test the performance of <b>location</b> <b>estimation</b> using the proposed sensor fusion framework, the framework and all the necessary components were implemented and tested. In order to solve the <b>location</b> <b>estimation</b> privacy issues, a comprehensive design that considers all aspects of the problem, from the physical aspects of using radio transmissions to communicating and using location data, is proposed. The experimental results of testing the <b>location</b> <b>estimation</b> sensor fusion framework show that by using sensor fusion, the availability of <b>location</b> <b>estimation</b> is always increased and the accuracy is always increased on average. The experimental results also allow the profiling of the sensor fusion framework's time and energy consumption. In the case of time consumption, there is a 0. 32 % - 17. 06 % - 5. 05 % - 77. 58 % split between results overhead, engine overhead, component communication time and component execution time on an average.

40|$|Abstract—Mobile <b>location</b> <b>estimation</b> has {{attracted}} much atten-tion in recent years. Location algorithms for mobile stations (MSs) can generally be categorized into network- and satellite-based sys-tems. Both types of systems have their advantages and limitations under different environments (i. e., urban or rural area). In this pa-per, hybrid <b>location</b> <b>estimation</b> schemes, which combine both the satellite- and the network-based signals, are proposed to provide adaptation to various scenarios for <b>location</b> <b>estimation.</b> By exploit-ing the fusion algorithm, the proposed fusion-based hybrid (FH) architecture integrates the estimation {{results that are}} acquired from both the satellite- and the network-based systems. Two dif-ferent types of signal selection schemes are adopted within the FH architecture: 1) the fixed set of signal inputs approach and 2) the selective set of signal inputs approach. On the other hand, the unified hybrid architecture employs the proposed hybrid signal-selection scheme and the hybrid least square estimator, which can conduct <b>location</b> <b>estimation</b> within a selected set of signal sources from the heterogeneous networks. The Kalman filtering technique is exploited in the proposed algorithms to both eliminate the measurement noises and to track the trajectories of the MSs. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid location schemes can provide accurate <b>location</b> <b>estimation</b> by adapting themselves to different environments.

40|$|Fingerprinting is {{an indoor}} {{location}} technique, based on wireless networks, where data stored during the offline phase is compared with {{data collected by}} the mobile device during the online phase. In most of the real-life scenarios, the mobile node used throughout the offline phase {{is different from the}} mobile nodes that will be used during the online phase. This means that there might be very significant differences between the Received Signal Strength values acquired by the mobile node and the ones stored in the Fingerprinting Map. As a consequence, this difference between RSS values might contribute to increase the <b>location</b> <b>estimation</b> error. One possible solution to minimize these differences is to adapt the RSS values, acquired during the online phase, before sending them to the <b>Location</b> <b>Estimation</b> Algorithm.
