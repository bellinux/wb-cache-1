According to the actress, her father (Mohammed Kaif) is a British {{businessman}} of Kashmiri descent and her mother (Suzanne, also spelt Susanna) is an English lawyer and charity worker. She has seven siblings: three elder sisters (Stephanie, Christine, and Natasha), three younger sisters (Melissa, Sonia, and Isabel) and an elder brother, Michael. Isabelle Kaif is also a model and actress. Kaif's parents divorced {{when she was a}} child, and her father moved to the United States. She said her father had no influence on Kaif or her siblings while they were growing up, and they were raised by their mother. On her father's absence in her life, Kaif stated: [...] "When I see friends who have wonderful fathers who are like pillars of support for their families, I say, if only I had that. But instead of complaining, I should be grateful for <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> I have". In a 2009 interview with The Indian Express, she said she was not in touch with her father.|$|E

As to the navigation which the latter wished to undertake to Nueva España and his desire to have masters sent him for that purpose, to build ships for that voyage, that was a matter which [...] although the governor would do his best to effect, and to please him in everything [...] was not within his control, without first informing his Majesty and the latter's viceroy in Nueva España thereof; for he, the governor, had no power or authority outside of the affairs of his government of the Philippines.|$|E

Using a vocal falsetto, Jackson assures [...] " [...] doesn’t really matter what the eye is seeing, 'cause I'm {{in love with the}} inner being," [...] considered a [...] "sweet song of unconditional love." [...] Its theme also emphasizes self-acceptance and pride, opposing negativity. Jackson said [...] "It plays a major part in society, it seems today. Their image, what a woman is supposed to look like – all the things you read in the magazines about either being too thin or too this or too that, but it's really about feeling good yourself and accepting yourself. Self-acceptance, which is another story you see here in this film, {{is the most important thing}} as well as being happy with who you are." [...] The song is based on Jackson's character Denise's [...] "unconditional love" [...] for the obese but gentle Sherman. Jackson said, [...] "I loved this character so much because she didn't care about <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> that people may have seen or saw and thought was wrong with Sherman. Those were the things she loved about him, and then on top of that she saw beyond that – how genuine of a man he is, how kind he is, a very good-hearted person and that's what she loves about him. [...] he's someone I could fall in love with because it's about what's inside." [...] Jimmy Jam added, [...] "It lyrically goes with her character in the movie. The song is about 'it's what's inside that counts.' You think it's funny when you hear that Janet and Klump have a relationship, but they make it believable." ...|$|E

2500|$|Under Winchell's sponsorship, Howard Rushmore {{became the}} chief {{editor of a}} New York scandal magazine, Confidential. Its publisher, Robert Harrison, began as an office boy and later writer for Bernarr McFadden's New York Graphic during the 1920s, an {{ancestor}} of the supermarket tabloids that would emerge in the 1960s. It was at the Graphic where the young Harrison first met Walter Winchell. As an adult Harrison was on the editorial staff of the Motion Picture Herald, a trade publication whose conservative Catholic owner, Martin Quigley, Sr., had {{close ties to the}} Hays Office. Having learned from Quigley what he could get away with legally, Harrison struck out on his own with a series of non-pornographic [...] "cheesecake" [...] magazines. Supposedly inspired by the Kefauver Committee hearings, Harrison later launched a tabloid-style gossip magazine. It concentrated on exposing the substance abuse habits, criminal records and hidden political and sexual preferences of celebrities. Film historian Mary Desjardins described Confidentials editorial style as using [...] "research methods and writing techniques that recycled old stories or created 'composite' facts as the basis of new ones." [...] Robert Harrison himself described it thus: [...] "Once we establish the star in the hay and that's documented, we can say anything we want and I think we make them {{a hell of a lot}} more interesting than they really are. What's a guy gonna do, sue us and admit he was in the hay with the dame, but claim he didn't do <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>things</b> we dress the story with?" [...] Before Rushmore's tenure at Confidential, Harrison published stories like “Is It True What They Say About Johnnie Ray?" [...] and [...] "Why Joe DiMaggio Is Striking Out with Marilyn Monroe!" [...] With [...] "Winchell Was Right About Josephine Baker!", Harrison came out in support of his childhood mentor at the Graphic during the Stork Club controversy. Though Harrison would publish non-show business stories involving [...] "racketeering, consumer scams and politicians' peccadilloes," [...] "exposés of star secrets" [...] became Confidentials prime focus.|$|E

6000|$|He {{had given}} her indeed, she made no scruple of showing, plenty to consider.

60|$|Sometimes he had moods {{of intense}} regret for {{the folly of}} that walk.

This is revealed to be the 29th day, and then there will be just one day to save the pond. (From Meadows et al. 1972) ...|$|R
