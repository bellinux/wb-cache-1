All patients studied had normal left ventricular function and a normal sinus node rate response to exercise. Cardiac output was measured by continuous wave Doppler and was calculated {{as the product of}} stroke distance measured by Doppler at the left ventricular outflow, aortic root area measured by M mode echocardiography, and heart rate. Pacemakers were programmed in the DDD mode. Cardiac output was measured with the patient at rest while supine and while erect and at the peak of submaximal exercise (the end of stage 1 of the Bruce protocol) with the pacemakers programmed to the following atrioventricular intervals: 75 - 80 ms, 100 - 110 ms, 140 - 150 ms, and 200 ms. During exercise the basic pacing rate was programmed to 70 beats/min. Cardiac output at rest while supine and erect was greatest with an <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>delay</b> of 140 - 150 ms and it was significantly higher than that with an <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>delay</b> of 75 - 80 ms.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The optimal <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>delay</b> in dual-chamber pacing {{differs from}} patient to patient. The {{availability}} of a portable scintillation probe (VEST) enables noninvasive monitoring of left ventricular function. METHODS AND RESULTS: Hemodynamic variations were measured in 10 patients with programmable DDD pacemakers. The ejection fraction, stroke volume, and diastolic and systolic volume were evaluated, programming six different atrioventricular delays ranging from 75 to 200 msec, to determine the most favorable <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>delay.</b> Comparing left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), stroke volume, and end-diastolic and end-systolic volume at each DVI mode with a preceding DVI setting of 75 msec, all parameters at 200 msec were statistically different from those at 100 msec. An increase of LVEF and stroke volume and a decrease of end-systolic volume was found. In only five patients a switch of VVI mode to the optimal DVI mode results in an increase of LVEF of more than 5 %.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was performed to}} study atrial systolic function in response to modification of <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>delay</b> {{in a sample of}} 36 patients with a DDD pacemaker implanted for complete atrioventricular block. The relation between atrial systolic performance and diastolic-related parameters was also evaluated. Isovolumic relaxation time, early diastolic peak velocity, late (atrial) diastolic peak velocity, atrial filling fraction, and atrial ejection force were recorded at a pacing rate of 70 impulses/min and at <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>delay</b> of 200, 150, and 100 msec. Our data showed that the progressive shortening of <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>delay</b> induced a gradual increase in early peak velocity (median value 46 to 53 to 61. 5 cm/sec, respectively, at 200, 150, and 100 msec intervals) and a gradual decrease in isovolumic relaxation time (median 92. 6 to 81. 5 to 69. 7 msec at 200, 150, and 100 msec, respectively), atrial peak velocity (59 to 52 to 44. 5 cm/sec at 200, 150, and 100 msec, respectively), atrial filling fraction (50. 5 % to 40 % to 23. 5 % at 200, 150, and 100 msec, respectively), and atrial ejection force (17. 2 to 14. 7 to 8. 5 kilodynes at 200, 150, and 100 msec, respectively). For every <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>delay</b> value detected, we found a significant correlation between isovolumic relaxation time and early peak velocity with atrial filling fraction and atrial ejection force. In addition, atrial ejection force was related directly to atrial filling fraction at studied atrioventricular delays. The two indexes of atrial systolic performance showed a parallel decrease by shortening the <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>delay,</b> and they can quantify atrial systolic performance equally in sequentially paced patients.

Methods In this report we describe novel therapeutic uses of echo pulsed wave Doppler in atrioventricular pacemaker optimization in patients who had either not derived significant symptomatic benefit post biventricular pacemaker implantation or deteriorated after deriving initial benefit. In these patients atrioventricular optimization showed novel findings and improved cardiac output and symptoms. Results In 3 patients with Cheyne Stokes pattern of respiration echo Doppler showed worsening of mitral regurgitation during hyperpneac phase in one patient, marked E and A fusion in another patient and exaggerated ventricular interdependence in a third patient thus highlighting mechanisms of adverse effects of Cheyne Stokes respiration in patients with heart failure. All 3 patients required a very short <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>delay</b> programming for best cardiac output. In one patient with recurrent congestive heart failure post cardiac resynchronization, mitral inflow pulse wave Doppler showed no A wave until a sensed <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>delay</b> of 190 ms was reached and showed progressive improvement in mitral inflow pattern until an <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>delay</b> of 290 ms.

Our goal was to better define the incidence of <b>delayed</b> <b>atrioventricular</b> conduction block. MethodsA retrospective review was conducted of hospital records and pacemaker database for ventricular septal defect, atrioventricular canal, and tetralogy of Fallot repairs between 1999 and 2004. A total of 922 patients were identified (atrioventricular canal in 197, tetralogy of Fallot in 222, and ventricular septal defect in 503). Median follow-up was 4. 1 years. ResultsThere were 472 male and 450 female patients, median age 6 months (0 – 444 months) and median weight 5. 8 kg (1. 3 – 116 kg) at surgery. Postoperative atrioventricular conduction block developed in 21 (2. 3 %) of the 922, being transient, with return of conduction 3 days (1 – 14 days) after surgery, in 13 (1. 4 %) and permanent, with pacemakers implanted 10 days (6 – 20 days) after surgery, in 8 (0. 9 %). Of the 905 patients at risk for <b>delayed</b> <b>atrioventricular</b> conduction block, 3 (0. 3 %) had second- or third-degree block at 2, 8, and 16 months after surgery. Two of these 3 had transient postoperative block. For isolated ventricular septal defects, the incidence was 1 (0. 2 %) of 496. There were 8 late deaths at 31 months (7 – 45 months) after surgery. Five had normal conduction at death, but for 3 patients the conduction status at death could not be determined.

We hypothesized that pacing parameters independently affect cardiac output. Accordingly, we analyzed aortic flow measured with an electromagnetic flowmeter in patients at risk of low cardiac output during an ongoing randomized clinical trial of biventricular pacing (n =  11) versus standard of care (n =  9). MethodsA substudy was conducted in all 20 patients in both groups with stable pacing after coronary artery bypass grafting, valve surgery, or both. Ejection fraction averaged 33 % ± 15 %, and QRS duration was 116  ± 19 ms. Effects were measured within 1 hour of the conclusion of cardiopulmonary bypass. <b>Atrioventricular</b> <b>delay</b> (7 settings) and interventricular delay (9 settings) were optimized in random sequence. ResultsOptimization of <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>delay</b> (171  ± 8 ms) at an interventricular delay of 0 ms increased flow by 14 % versus the worst setting (111  ± 11 ms, P < . 001) and 7 % versus nominal <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>delay</b> (120 ms, P < . 001). Interventricular delay optimization increased flow 10 % versus the worst setting (P < . 001) and 5 % versus nominal interventricular delay (0 ms, P < . 001). Optimized pacing increased cardiac output 13 % versus atrial pacing at matched heart rate (5. 5  ± 0. 5 vs 4. 9  ± 0. 6 L/min, P = . 003) and 10 % versus sinus rhythm (5. 0  ± 0. 6 L/min, P = . 019).

Primary end points were changes in left atrial (LA) size and left ventricular (LV) size and function as measured by M-mode echocardiography. BackgroundIn patients with SSS and normal atrioventricular conduction, {{it is still not}} clear whether the optimal pacing mode is AAI or DDD pacing. MethodsA total of 177 consecutive patients (mean age 74 ± 9 years, 73 men) were randomized to treatment with one of three rate-adaptive (R) pacemakers: AAIR (n = 54), DDDR with a short <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>delay</b> (n = 60) (DDDR-s), or DDDR with a fixed long <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>delay</b> (n = 63) (DDDR-l). Before pacemaker implantation and at each follow-up, M-mode echocardiography {{was done to}} measure LA and LV diameters. Left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS) was calculated. Analysis was on an intention-to-treat basis. ResultsMean follow-up was 2. 9 ± 1. 1 years. In the AAIR group, no significant changes were observed in LA or LV diameters or LVFS from baseline to last follow-up. In both DDDR groups, LA diameter increased significantly (p < 0. 05), and in the DDDR-s group, LVFS decreased significantly (p < 0. 01). Atrial fibrillation was significantly less common in the AAIR group, 7. 4 % versus 23. 3 % in the DDDR-s group versus 17. 5 % in the DDDR-l group (p = 0. 03, log-rank test). Mortality, thromboembolism, and congestive heart failure did not differ between groups. ConclusionsDuring a mean follow-up of 2. 9 ± 1. 1 years, DDDR pacing causes increased LA diameter, and DDDR pacing with a short <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>delay</b> also causes decreased LVFS. No changes occur in LA or LV diameters or LVFS during AAIR pacing. Atrial fibrillation is significantly less common during AAIR pacing...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{patients}} with sinus rhythm and normal atrioventricular conduction, pacing only the left ventricle with appropriate <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>delays</b> {{can result in}} superior left ventricular and right ventricular function compared with standard biventricular (BiV) pacing. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a novel adaptive cardiac resynchronization therapy ((aCRT) algorithm for CRT pacing that provides automatic ambulatory selection between synchronized left ventricular or BiV pacing with dynamic optimization of <b>atrioventricular</b> and interventricular <b>delays.</b> METHODS: Patients (n = 522) indicated for a CRT-defibrillator were randomized to aCRT vs echo-optimized BiV pacing (Echo) in a 2 : 1 ratio and followed at 1 -, 3 -, and 6 -month postrandomization. RESULTS: The study met all 3 noninferiority primary objectives: (1) the percentage of aCRT patients who improved in their clinical composite score at 6 months was at least as high in the aCRT arm as in the Echo arm (73. 6 % vs 72. 5 %, with a noninferiority margin of 12 %; P =. 0007); (2) aCRT and echo-optimized settings resulted in similar cardiac performance, as demonstrated by a high concordance correlation coefficient between aortic velocity time integrals at aCRT and Echo settings at randomization (concordance correlation coefficient = 0. 93; 95 % confidence interval 0. 91 - 0. 94) and at 6 -month postrandomization (concordance correlation coefficient = 0. 90; 95 % confidence interval 0. 87 - 0. 92); and (3) aCRT {{did not result in}} inappropriate device settings.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe {{effect of}} biventricular pacing on stroke volume is {{believed}} to be dependent on right ventricular/left ventricular delay, but effects in individual patients are unpredictable. This variability may reflect relative right and left ventricular volume and/or pressure overloads. Accordingly, we tested the hypothesis that the relation of cardiac output to right ventricular/left ventricular delay is load dependent in a pig model of pulmonary stenosis. MethodsAfter median sternotomy in 6 anesthetized, domestic pigs, complete heart block was induced by ethanol ablation. During epicardial, atrial tracking DDD biventricular pacing, <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>delay</b> was varied between 60 and 180 ms in 30 -ms increments. Right ventricular/left ventricular delay was varied at each <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>delay</b> from + 80 ms (right ventricle first) to − 80 ms (left ventricle first) in 20 -ms increments. Aortic flow, right ventricular pressure, peripheral arterial pressure, and electrocardiogram were measured in the control state and during pulmonary stenosis, created by tightening a snare around the pulmonary artery until cardiac output decreased by 50 %. ResultsAtrioventricular and right ventricular/left ventricular delay had no effect on cardiac output during the control state, but during pulmonary stenosis there was a statistically significant (P =. 0001, repeated-measures analysis of variance) right ventricular/left ventricular delay–related trend toward higher cardiac output with right ventricular pacing first. This effect was more pronounced when the optimal <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>delay</b> was determined first, resulting in a 20 % increase in cardiac output when the optimal right ventricular/left ventricular delay was compared with simultaneous biventricular pacing.

40|$|Abstract Background Patients {{with left}} bundle branch block have a {{preserved}} right bundle branch conduction and {{the efficacy of}} left ventricular pacing could be explained with the fusion between artificial pulse delivered in the left lateral wall and the spontaneous right ventricular activation. Moreover, the efficacy of left ventricular pacing could be enhanced with an optimal timing between the spontaneous right ventricular activation and the left ventricular pulse. Case presentation We evaluated a patient (male, 47 yrs) with surgically corrected mitral regurgitation, sinus rhythm and left bundle branch block, heart failure (NYHA class III) despite medical therapy and low ejection fraction (25 %) : he was implanted with a biventricular device. We programmed ventricular pacing only through the left ventricular lead. We defined what we called electrocardiographic "fusion band" as follow: programming OFF the stimulator, we recorded the native electrocardiogram and measured, through the device, the intrinsic atrioventricular interval. Then, atrioventricular interval was progressively shortened by steps of 20 ms down to 100 ms. Twelve leads electrocardiogram was recorded at each step. The fusion band is the range of AV intervals at which surface electrocardiogram (mainly in V 1 lead) presents an intermediate morphology between the native left bundle branch block (upper limit of the band) and the fully paced right bundle branch block (lower limit). The patient underwent echocardiographic examination at each atrioventricular interval chosen inside the fusion band. The following parameters were evaluated: ejection fraction, diastolic filling time, E wave deceleration time, aortic velocity time integral and myocardial performance index. All the echocardiographic parameters showed an improvement inside the fusion band, with a "plateau" behaviour. As the fusion band in this patient ranged from an <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>delay</b> of 200 ms to an <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>delay</b> of 120 ms, we chose an intermediate <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>delay</b> of 160 ms, presuming that this might guarantee the persistence of fusion even during any possible physiological (autonomic, effort) atrioventricular conduction variation. Conclusion In this heart failure patient with left bundle branch block, tailoring of the atrioventricular interval resynchronized myocardial contraction with left ventricular pacing alone, utilizing a sensed right atrial activity and the surface electrocardiographic pattern. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background—Previous {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the role of intrinsic conduction in optimizing cardiac resynchronization therapy. We investigated the role of fusing pacing-induced activation and intrinsic conduction in cardiac resynchronization therapy by evaluating the acute hemodynamic effects of simultaneous His-bundle (HIS) and left ventricular (LV) pacing. Methods and Results—We studied 11 patients with systolic heart failure and left bundle-branch block scheduled for cardiac resynchronization therapy implantation. On implantation, LV pressure–volume data were determined via conductance catheter. Standard leads {{were placed in the}} right atrium, at the right ventricular apex, and in a coronary vein. An additional electrode was temporarily positioned in the HIS. The following pacing configurations were systematically assessed: standard biventricular (right ventricular apex+LV), LV-only, HIS, simultaneous HIS and LV (HIS+LV). Each configuration was compared with the AAI mode at multiple <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>delays</b> (AVD). In comparison with the AAI, right ventricular apex+LV and LV-only pacing resulted in improved stroke volume (85 ± 32 mL and 86 ± 33 mL versus 58 ± 23 mL; P 76 mL at all fixed intervals and 88 ± 31 mL at optimal interval; all P< 0. 001). Conclusions—Standard right ventricular apex+LV and LV-only pacing enhanced systolic function and LV synchrony at individually optimized AVD close to the measured intrinsic P-H interval. By contrast, HIS+LV pacing yielded improvements, regardless of AVD setting.

40|$|Background- During cardiac {{resynchronization}} therapy (CRT) device implantation, the pacing lead {{is usually}} positioned in the coronary sinus (CS) {{to stimulate the}} left ventricular (LV) epicardium. Transvenous LV endocardial pacing via transseptal puncture has been proposed as an alternative method. In the present study, we evaluated the acute hemodynamic effects of CRT through LV endocardial pacing in heart failure patients by analyzing LV pressure-volume relationships. Methods and Results- LV pressure and volume data were determined via conductance catheter during CRT device implantation in 10 patients. In addition to the standard epicardial CS pacing, the following endocardial LV sites were systematically assessed: the site transmural to the CS lead, the LV apex, the septal midwall, the basal lateral free wall, and the midlateral free wall. Four <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>delays</b> were tested. There was a significant improvement of systolic function with CRT in all LV pacing configurations, whereas no differences in systolic or diastolic function were detected between LV epicardial and endocardial transmural sites. The optimal pacing site varied among patients but was rarely related to relatively longer activation delays, as assessed by analyzing endocardial electric activation maps. Nonetheless, positioning the pacing lead at the optimal endocardial LV site in each patient significantly improved LV performance in comparison with conventional CS site stimulation (stroke volume, 83 [79 - 112] mL versus 73 [62 - 89] mL; P= 0. 034). Conclusions- Pacing at the optimal individual LV endocardial site yields enhanced LV performance in comparison with conventional CS site stimulation. Endocardial LV pacing might constitute an alternative approach to CRT, when CS pacing is not viable...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesWe {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} {{the impact of the}} left ventricular (LV) pacing site on hemodynamic response to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). BackgroundCRT reduces morbidity and mortality in heart failure patients. However, 20 % to 40 % of eligible patients may not fully benefit from CRT device implantation. We hypothesized that selecting the optimal LV pacing site could be critical in this issue. MethodsThirty-five patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy referred for CRT device implantation were studied. Intraventricular dyssynchrony and latest activated LV wall were defined by tissue Doppler imaging analysis before the study. Eleven predetermined LV pacing sites were systematically assessed in random order: basal and mid-cavity (septal, anterior, lateral, inferior), apex, coronary sinus (CS), and the endocardial site facing the CS pacing site. For each patient, +dP/dTmax, −dP/dTmin, pulse pressure, and end-systolic pressure during baseline (AAI) and DDD LV pacing were compared. Two <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>delays</b> were tested. ResultsMajor interindividual and intraindividual variations of hemodynamic response depending on the LV pacing site were observed. Compared with baseline, LV DDD pacing at the best LV position significantly improved +dP/dTmax(+ 31 ± 26 %, p < 0. 001) and was superior to pacing the CS (+ 15 ± 23 %, p < 0. 001), the lateral LV wall (+ 18 ± 22 %, p < 0. 001), or the latest activated LV wall (+ 11 ± 17 %, p < 0. 001). ConclusionsThe pacing site is a primary determinant of the hemodynamic response to LV pacing in patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. Pacing at the best LV site is associated acutely with fewer nonresponders and twice the improvement in +dP/dTmaxobserved with CS pacing...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Previous {{studies have}} {{reported}} that the left ventricular (LV) pacing site is {{a major determinant of}} the hemodynamic response to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). However, lead positioning in a lateral or posterolateral cardiac vein may not be optimal for every patient. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the relationship between the right ventricular (RV) -to-LV conduction time and the systolic function during CRT on the basis of changes to LV pressure-volume loops. METHODS: Left ventricular pressure and volume data were determined using a conductance catheter during CRT device implantation in 10 patients. Four endocardial LV sites were systematically assessed at four <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>delays.</b> The RV-to-LV conduction time was measured as the time interval between spontaneous peak R waves, recorded through the RV lead and the LV catheter. RESULTS: The optimal pacing site varied among patients. However, the pacing site associated with the maximum RV-to-LV conduction time resulted in a stroke volume improvement comparable to the pacing site identified through individual hemodynamic optimization (41 ± 17 mL vs 44 ± 18 mL, P = 0. 266). Moreover, the RV-to-LV conduction time recorded at each endocardial pacing site correlated positively with the increase in stroke volume (r = 0. 537; P < 0. 001), stroke work (r = 0. 642; P < 0. 001), and the pressure-derivative maximum (r = 0. 646; P < 0. 001) obtained with CRT. CONCLUSIONS: An optimal acute response to CRT can be obtained by positioning the LV lead at the site associated with the maximum RV-to-LV conduction time. A significant correlation appears to exist between RV-to-LV conduction time and the improvement in systolic function with CR...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundPrevious {{work from}} our {{laboratory}} {{has demonstrated that}} optimization of biventricular pacing is load dependent. During acute pulmonary stenosis and right ventricular pressure overload in swine, cardiac output was maximized by pacing the right ventricle 40 ms before the left ventricle. To extend those studies, this experiment examined biventricular pacing optimization during right ventricular volume overload. MethodsAfter median sternotomy in 6 anesthetized domestic pigs, complete heart block was induced by ethanol ablation. A conduit was grafted from the right ventricle to the right atrium to simulate tricuspid insufficiency. During epicardial, atrial tracking DDD biventricular pacing, <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>delay</b> was varied between 60 and 180 ms in 30 -ms increments. Right ventricular–left ventricular delay was varied at each <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>delay</b> from + 80 ms (right ventricle first) to − 80 ms (left ventricle first) in 20 -ms increments. Aortic flow, right ventricular pressure, and electrocardiogram were measured at each pacemaker setting with the graft clamped and unclamped. ResultsAtrioventricular and right ventricular–left ventricular delays had no significant effect on cardiac output with the graft clamped. With the graft unclamped, however, there was a statistically significant (P =. 003 by mixed modeling repeated measures analysis of variance) trend toward higher cardiac output with left ventricle–first pacing. ConclusionLeft ventricle–first biventricular pacing in swine significantly increased cardiac output during acute tricuspid insufficiency but not during the control state. Trials are warranted to develop clinical biventricular pacing for treatment of perioperative right ventricular dysfunction...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivePrevious {{work from}} our {{laboratory}} {{has demonstrated that}} optimization of biventricular pacing is load dependent. Cardiac output was maximized with a ventricular-ventricular delay of + 40 milliseconds (right ventricle–first pacing) during right ventricular pressure overload and with a ventricular-ventricular delay of − 40 milliseconds (left ventricle–first pacing) during right ventricular volume overload. We hypothesized that a model of left ventricular volume overload would also have specific timing requirements during biventricular pacing for optimization of cardiac output. MethodsAfter median sternotomy in 6 anesthetized pigs, complete heart block was induced by ethanol ablation. A conduit was grafted from the left ventricle to the left atrium to produce left ventricular volume overload. An ultrasonic flow probe was placed around the conduit to measure retrograde flow that averaged 50 % of cardiac output. During epicardial atrial tracking DDD biventricular pacing, <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>delay</b> was varied between 60 and 270 milliseconds in 30 -millisescond increments for 20 -second intervals. After determination of optimum <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>delay,</b> ventricular-ventricular delay was varied in 20 -millisecond increments from + 80 to − 80 milliseconds for 20 -second intervals. ResultsVentricular-ventricular delays had no significant effect on cardiac output with the graft clamped (control). With the graft unclamped, however, there was a statistically significant (P =. 0001 by repeated-measures analysis of variance) trend toward higher cardiac output with right ventricle–first pacing. ConclusionsRight ventricle–first pacing in swine significantly increased cardiac output during acute left ventricular volume overload, but not during the control state.

40|$|Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy. Background: A {{significant}} proportion of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and left bundle branch block (LBBB) {{do not respond to}} cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate whether the electromechanical properties of the myocardium would predict acute hemodynamic improvement during left ventricular (LV) pacing. Methods and Results: We studied 10 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and LBBB (ejection fraction (EF) : 27 % ± 7 %; QRS duration: 166 ± 16 msec) using three-dimensional electromechanical endocardial mapping technique to assess endocardial activation time (Endo-AT), unipolar voltage, and local linear shortening during sinus rhythm. LV stimulation was performed in VDD mode at five different sites and three <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>delays</b> within the coronary sinus. LV + dP/dtmax changes from baseline were measured during LV stimulation at each site (%ΔdP/dtmax). There was no significant relationship between maximum %AdP/dtmax during LV stimulation at the best coronary sinus site and LV EF, baseline LV + dP/dt max, total LV Endo-AT, baseline QRS duration nor changes in QRS duration during LV pacing. However, the maximum %AdP/dtmax was significantly positively correlated with percentage area of late Endo-AT (r = 0. 97, P 20 % of LV area with late Endo-AT and > 30 % of preserved LV myocardium had five times better acute hemodynamic response with LV stimulation. Multivariate analysis snowed that only percentage area of late Endo-AT was independently correlated with %AdP/dtmax (P < 0. 05). Conclusion: The presence of a larger amount of LV area with late Endo-AT and preserved LV myocardium measured by electromechanical mapping could identify patients who have better acute improvement in systolic performance during LV stimulation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} the {{duration}} of <b>atrioventricular</b> (AV) <b>delay</b> on obstruction in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was evaluated in 12 patients by cardiac catheterization, and in 8 of them also by Doppler echocardiography. The AV delay was programmed in random order at 125, 100 and 75 ms in the invasive study and at 120, 100 and 80 ms after pacemaker implantation. The arterial pressure did not changed throughout the studies, whereas the gradient decreased significantly by reducing the AV delay value; the greater gradient reduction was obtained, in both studies, with the AV delay set between 75 or 80 and 100 ms.

40|$|The {{influence}} and clinical consequences of different <b>atrioventricular</b> <b>delays</b> on ventricular filling {{have been studied}} in 30 patients (mean age 60 +/- 5 years) who implanted DDD pacemaker for complete A-V block. All patients presented a normal ejection fraction: 63. 9 +/- 6. 5 %. In 18 subjects (Group I) an echo-Doppler examination revealed ventricular hypertrophy (mean end-diastolic wall thickness of 1. 4 +/- 0. 16 cm; left ventricular mass index 155 +/- 17 g/m 2) and an abnormal relaxation pattern (isovolumic relaxation time 124 +/- 11 : early to late peak velocity 0. 6 +/- 0. 03; deceleration time of the early diastolic peak 296 +/- 34 ms). Group II included the remaining 12 patients without left ventricular hypertrophy and normal filling pattern. In all 30 patients the filling pattern was reassessed following modification of the A-V delay (200, 150, 100 and 75 ms). Patients at baseline (200 ms of A-V delay) underwent an exercise test with determination of respiratory gas exchange. In Group I, 13 (72. 5 %) patients were classified as Weber class B (VO 2 max 16. 8 +/- 1. 7 ml/min/kg) and 5 (27. 5 %) as class A (VO 2 max 22. 5 +/- 1. 4 ml/min/kg). In Group II, all 12 patients were classified as Weber class A (VO 2 max 23. 1 +/- 1. 1 ml/ min/kg). In Group II, changes in A-V delay caused no homogeneous variation in filling pattern. A-V delay was not modified in this group. In Group I, the reduction of A-V delay to 100 ms resulted in filling normalization. In this group A-V delay was programmed definitely to 100 ms. Graded exercise test repeated at 6 months follow-up showed an improved Weber class in 13 patients (from B to A) and greater VO 2 max in the remaining 5 already in class A. We conclude that, in sequential paced patients with normal ejection fraction but abnormal relaxation pattern, a modification of A-V delay can induce filling normalization and improve cardiac functional capacit...|$|R
