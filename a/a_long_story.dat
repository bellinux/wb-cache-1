25|$|It is <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>story</b> {{about the}} life of twelve sisters {{abandoned}} by their parents and adopted by an ogress (Lao Sundara; Khmer: Santhomea; Thai: Santhumala) disguised as a beautiful lady. The conclusion is the sad love story about the only surviving son of the twelve sisters, Rathasena (Thai: Phra Rotthasen พระรถเสน; Khmer: Rithisen or Puthisen; Lao: Putthasen) with Manora (Thai: Meri เมรี; Lao: Kankari; Khmer: Kong Rei), the adopted daughter of ogress Sundara. At the end both died together upon the long and lonely shore of a lake.|$|E
25|$|O'Neill {{was married}} to Kathleen Jenkins from October 2, 1909 to 1912, during which time they had one son, Eugene O'Neill, Jr. (1910–1950). In 1917, O'Neill met Agnes Boulton, a {{successful}} writer of commercial fiction, and they married on April 12, 1918. They lived in a home owned by her parents in Point Pleasant, New Jersey after their marriage. The years of their marriage—during which the couple lived in Connecticut and Bermuda and had two children, Shane and Oona—are described vividly in her 1958 memoir Part of <b>a</b> <b>Long</b> <b>Story.</b> They divorced in 1929, after O'Neill abandoned Boulton and the children for the actress Carlotta Monterey (born San Francisco, California, December 28, 1888; died Westwood, New Jersey, November 18, 1970). O'Neill and Carlotta married {{less than a month}} after he officially divorced his previous wife.|$|E

25|$|In 1274 a {{long and}} {{expensive}} suit was begun between the prior and convent of Dunstable and Eudo la Zouche, who had become lord of Houghton and Eaton Bray by his marriage with Millicent de Cantelow. Eudo refused to recognise {{the rights of the}} prior (established not only by charter, but by long custom) to a gallows and prison in Houghton; he released one of his men from the prison and overthrew the gallows. Under the next prior, William le Breton, the gallows was restored; but Eudo still refused to recognise the prison as the prior's right, and presently erected a gallows of his own. The dispute went on for some years, and, after the death of Eudo, was continued by his wife Millicent until the year 1289, when it was finally decided in favour of the prior. The poverty and difficulties of the house went on increasing, although great efforts were made, after the deposition of William le Breton and other officers of the monastery in 1279, to curtail expenses and get in ready money for the payment of debts. Corrodies and chantries were granted to several persons, manors and churches were let out to farm, and in the year 1294 the usual allowance for one canon was made to serve for two. It was just at this time that the king was asking for subsidies for his Welsh war. By an accumulation of misfortune, in the same winter the outer walls of the priory had collapsed in the wet weather, and their hayricks had been destroyed by fire; and the tithes due to the Hospitallers from North Marston church were in such long arrears that a new arrangement had to be made to pay them off. In 1295 the house at Bradbourne was so poor that all the wool produced there had to be granted to the support of the three brethren who served the church and chapels. The later pages of the annals are <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>story</b> of poverty and struggle to get clear of debt; and the continuous narrative ends dismally enough with the account of the expenses of the installation of John of Cheddington, which amounted (with the addition of the debts of the previous prior) to £242 8s. 4d.|$|E

[...] Orbit joked about the matter, saying that the true cause of the glitch is that they [...] "were kidnapped by Aliens and actually spent a year on their ship making friends, doing shows, creating Alien music [...] Then we travelled back to 2:14 in the track, with just that glitch to show for it." [...] On January 25, 2014, Orbit hinted on Twitter that the glitch might be a fail of production held by the album's executive producer, will.i.am: [...] "Remember 'Glitchgate'?

In a March 2000 article for Game Studies, Diane Carr called the setting [...] "a freak show, <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>story,</b> a zoo, and a cabinet of talkative curiosities" [...] and described the creatures and monsters in the game as [...] "grotesque rather than scary". [...] Cindy Yans of Computer Games Magazine describes the setting as [...] "a world where knowledge and thoughts wield more power than the sword. Belief has the ability to reshape worlds, kill and resurrect powers and change the laws of physics." [...] Cindy Vanous of Computer Games Magazine notes that [...] "Planescapes bestiary features legions of the unknown, and its landscape is an ever-changing tapestry of the bizarre." [...] Planescape: Torment is the first video game to be set in the Planescape universe.|$|E

500|$|Throughout the 1980s, George Lucas remarked he had {{no desire}} to return to Star Wars and had unofficially {{canceled}} his sequel trilogy by the time of Return of the Jedi. Because Lucas had developed most of the backstory, the idea of prequels continued to fascinate him. In the early 1990s, Star Wars saw a resurgence in popularity in the wake of Dark Horse's comic line and Timothy Zahn's trilogy of novels. Lucas saw there was still a large audience for his idea of a prequel trilogy and with the development of special effects generated with computer-generated imagery (CGI), Lucas considered returning to his saga and directing the film. In 1993, it was announced in Variety and other sources that he would be making the prequels. Lucas began outlining the story; Anakin Skywalker rather than Obi-Wan Kenobi would be the main protagonist and the series would be a tragedy examining Darth Vader's origins. Lucas also began to change the prequels' timeline relative to the original series, [...] "filling-in" [...] the history, backstory, existing parallel or tangential to the originals and beginning <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>story</b> that started with Anakin's childhood and ended with his death. This was the final step toward turning the franchise into a saga.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} famous contemporaries of king Djoser was his vizier, [...] "head of the royal shipyard" [...] and [...] "overseer of all stone works", Imhotep. Imhotep oversaw stone {{building}} projects such as the tombs of King Djoser and King Sekhemkhet. It is possible that Imhotep was mentioned in the also famous Papyrus Westcar, in a story called [...] "Khufu and the magicians". But because the papyrus is badly damaged at the beginning, Imhotep's name is lost today. A papyrus from the ancient Egyptian temple of Tebtunis, dating to the 2nd century AD, preserves <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>story</b> in the demotic script about Djoser and Imhotep. At Djoser's time Imhotep was of such importance and fame that he was honoured by being mentioned on statues of king Djoser in his necropolis at Saqqara.|$|E

[...] She replied that there was a brooch, her mother had given her, that had gone out of her possession some time ago. Blavatsky said she would try to recover it through occult means. After some interlude, later that evening, the brooch was found in a garden, where the party was directed by Blavatsky. According to John Murdoch (1894), the brooch had been given by Mrs. Hume to her daughter who had given it to a man she admired. Blavatsky had happened to meet the man in Bombay and obtained the brooch in return for money. Blavatsky allegedly planted it in the garden before directing people to the location through what she claimed as occult techniques.|$|E
