5|$|Edge of Darkness is a British {{television}} drama serial, {{produced by}} BBC Television {{in association with}} Lionheart Television International and originally broadcast in six fifty-five-minute episodes in late 1985. A mixture of crime drama and political thriller, it revolves around the efforts of policeman Ronald Craven (played by Bob Peck) to unravel the truth behind {{the murder of his}} daughter Emma (played by Joanne Whalley). Craven's investigations soon lead him into <b>a</b> <b>murky</b> world of government and corporate cover-ups and nuclear espionage, pitting him against dark forces that threaten the future of life on Earth.|$|E

5|$|In {{light of}} Ívarr's {{possible}} collusion with Haraldr Guðrøðarson, {{the slaying of}} Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson may be evidence that the continuing strife between the rival branches descended from the half-brothers, Rǫgnvaldr Guðrøðarson and Óláfr, continued well into the mid thirteenth century. In fact, the killing is the last recorded example of regicide in the Norse-Gaelic realm, and may partly evidence the Europeanisation of the peripheral regions of the British Isles during the twelfth- and thirteenth centuries. As it turned out, the reign of Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson's successor was short-lived, since Haraldr Guðrøðarson was recalled to Norway in 1250, for having unjustly seized the kingship. Once in Norway, the latter was detained from returning to the Isles, and is not heard of again. Within two years, Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson's brother, Magnús, was installed in the kingship. The latter reigned {{until his death in}} 1265, and was the last member of the Crovan dynasty to rule as king in the Isles. An after-effect of the inter-dynastic warring within the Crovan dynasty was the partitioning of the kingdom between rival factions. For example, from about 1187 to 1226, and for a brief period in 1229, the kingdom was divided between the half-brothers; and for a brief period in 1230/1231 it was divided between Óláfr and his nephew, Guðrøðr Rögnvaldsson. Although Haraldr Óláfsson appears to have reigned over a united kingdom, the years between his death and the installation of Magnús in 1252 is <b>a</b> <b>murky</b> period indeed, and {{it is possible that the}} kingdom was divided between rival factions during this brief span of years. Rǫgnvaldr Óláfsson was evidently survived by a daughter, Maria. In 1305, a grandson of this woman pursued a claim to Mann.|$|E

500|$|The Telegraph {{granted the}} film a maximum score of five stars, stating {{that it is}} [...] "a superhero film without a superhero," [...] {{comparing}} it with The Godfather Part II and praising Hardy's performance {{as well as the}} film's intricate plot and narrative. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times thought the film was [...] "potent, persuasive and hypnotic" [...] and that it was [...] "more than an exceptional superhero movie, it is masterful filmmaking by any standard." [...] The Playlists Todd Gilchrist wrote [...] "A cinematic, cultural and personal triumph, The Dark Knight Rises is emotionally inspiring, aesthetically significant and critically important for America itself – as a mirror of both sober reflection and resilient hope." [...] IGN gave it a 9 out of 10, noting similarities in tone and theme to Batman Begins over the trilogy's second installment The Dark Knight, but also describing Bane as [...] "that bit less interesting to watch" [...] than Ledger's Joker, despite praising his [...] "menacing voice" [...] and [...] "body language-driven performance". The Guardian scored the film four out of five stars, calling it a film of [...] "granite, monolithic intensity", yet also calling it a [...] "hammy, portentous affair". Andrew O'Hehir of Salon writes [...] "if The Dark Knight Rises is a fascist film, it's a great fascist film, and arguably the biggest, darkest, most thrilling and disturbing and utterly balls-out spectacle ever created for the screen". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three out of four stars, stating [...] "the film begins slowly with <b>a</b> <b>murky</b> plot and too many new characters, but builds to a sensational climax." [...] Film critic Richard Roeper gave the film an [...] "A", calling it [...] "a majestic, gorgeous, brutal and richly satisfying epic", and citing the final scenes of the picture as [...] "the best five minutes of any film this year." [...] The London Film Review gave the film a B and said [...] "Nolan's film is a reminder that superheroes aren't merely a frivolous distraction, but an embodiment of our best selves." [...] The film was crowned by Forbes as the best modern comic book superhero adaption on screen, outranking both its main summer blockbuster competitor, Marvel's The Avengers, and the trilogy's previous installment The Dark Knight.

It {{rested on}} the claim that, by refusing to allow transshipment of unsold vehicles, Mitsubishi was dividing markets. Further anticompetitive practices alleged were wrongful termination of Soler's franchise, and the refusal to ship cars and parts. Mitsubishi responded with its practical objections to the transshipments, that the franchise had expired without being renewed and that the shipments were halted sometimes at Soler's request and sometimes for lack of an acceptable letter of credit. Most of these, Coffin concluded, were differences over {{the execution of the}} contract and therefore covered by the arbitration clause.|$|R

Some say that, should government money transfers be stopped, many of these communities of communes would revert to their former status of syndicate, or simply completely disappear in places where there were no syndicates prior to the law.|$|R
