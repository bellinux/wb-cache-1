40|$|Three plunge {{grinding}} control methods are discussed, {{and it is}} shown in control engineering terms that the process is one of motion control and that {{the differences between the}} various control methods lie in the control algorithms implemented in software using a common hardware system. A new control method is proposed for an improvement in grinding efficiency and is described as the optimum size and roundness adaptive control method. An accurate description of the control actions is provided, and the adaptive algorithm used by the proposed method also enables a low-cost computer system to be used. A case study of the grinding process based on a simulation is presented to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed control method. The experimental results for validating the proposed control method will be the subject of a separate publication.

The approach combines the advan-tages of the group sequential and sample size reestimation methods and provides an efficient design for clinical trials.

To control the overall type I error level, a method is proposed to adjust the group sequential <b>stopping</b> boundaries <b>adjusted</b> for sample size reestimation and negative <b>stops.</b> The <b>adjusted</b> <b>stopping</b> boundaries are flexible to different rules of sample size reestimation and reuse the alpha values saved by negative stops. The adjustment is based on the exact type 1 error change and, therefore, the penalty for the type I error inflation due to such an interim reestimation is kept to a minimum. The eflciency of sample size reestimation without positive stops is compared with the group sequential method using unconditional power and expected sample size.

Also, the inhibition of the deuteron acceleration by a proton rich contamination layer significantly reduces the pitcher-catcher neutron production. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

40|$|This thesis {{extends the}} design and the global {{convergence}} analysis of a class of trust-region sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithms for smooth nonlinear optimization to allow for an efficient integration of inexact linear system solvers. Each iteration within an SQP method requires the solution of several linear systems, whose system matrix/operator involves the linearized constraints. Most existing implementations of SQP algorithms use direct linear algebra methods to solve these systems. For many optimization problems {{in science and engineering}} this is infeasible, because the systems are too large or the matrices associated with the linearized constraints are not formed explicitly. Instead, iterative solvers, such as preconditioned Krylov subspace methods have to be applied for the approximate solution of the linear systems arising within the SQP algorithm. In this case, the optimization algorithm has to provide stopping tolerances for the iterative solver. The existing literature on the treatment of inexact linear system solves in SQP algorithms is rather scarce. Most theoretical results either provide stopping tolerances for iterative solvers that cannot be easily implemented in practice, or are restricted to specific classes of optimization problems. This thesis provides concrete stopping criteria for the iterative solution of so-called augmented systems; which allows for a wider applicability of the resulting SQP algorithm and a rigorous integration of available KKT preconditioners. A key contribution is the development of an inexact conjugate gradient algorithm for the solution of quadratic subproblems with linear constraints that are subject to arbitrary nonlinear perturbations that arise from the approximate computation of projections via Krylov subspace methods. The resulting SQP algorithm dynamically <b>adjusts</b> <b>stopping</b> tolerances for iterative linear system solves based on its current progress toward a KKT point. The stopping tolerances can be easily implemented and efficiently computed, and are sufficient to guarantee first-order global convergence of the algorithm. The performance of the algorithm is examined on optimal control problems governed by Burgers and Navier-Stokes equations...|$|R

If the note being played (and making the lamps behind the disc flash) is {{at exactly the same}} frequency as the spinning of the disc, then the disc appears to be static (due to the persistence of vision) from the strobing effect. If the note is out of tune then the pattern appears to be moving as the light flashing and the disc rotation are out of sync from each other. The more out of tune the played note is, the faster the pattern seems to be moving, although in reality it always spins at the same speed for a given note.

Adapting sequential testing methodology from clinical trials for application to pooled meta-analytic effect size estimates appears well suited for this objective. In this paper we describe a Bayesian sequential meta-analysis method, in which an informative heterogeneity prior is employed and stopping rule criteria are applied directly to the posterior distribution for the treatment effect parameter. Using simulation studies, we examine how well this approach performs under different parameter combinations by monitoring the proportion of sequential meta-analyses that reach incorrect conclusions (to yield error rates), the number of studies required to reach conclusion, and the resulting parameter estimates. By <b>adjusting</b> the <b>stopping</b> rule thresholds, the overall error rates can be controlled within the target levels and are no {{higher than those of}} alternative frequentist and semi-Bayes methods {{for the majority of the}} simulation scenarios.

40|$|For an {{air source}} heat pump (ASHP) unit, reverse cycle {{defrosting}} operations are always conducted {{to solve the}} undesired frosting problem. Previous studies verified that, uneven refrigerant distribution (URD) and melted frost downwards flowing (MFDF) along the vertically installed multi-circuit outdoor coil would degrade system defrosting performance. However, it is hardly possible to separate the URD and MFDF effects in a practical multi-circuit outdoor coil. In addition, it is a fundamental coupled problem of uneven heat and mass transfer. Consequently, to investigate the coupled effects of MFDF and URD on system defrosting performance, a sequential experimental study is carried out and reported in this paper. Firstly, a special testing facility and tailor-made three-circuit outdoor coil were introduced. This is followed by two experimental cases designed, with frost evenly accumulated on the surface of each circuit by <b>adjusting</b> the <b>stop</b> valves’ opening degrees. After the experimental results compared, basing on refrigerant evenly and unevenly distributed into each circuit, energy analysis was also given. Finally, as concluded, the coupled effects were negative on system energy performance, and defrosting efficiency increased by 7. 4 %, from 40. 5 % to 47. 9 %, when the refrigerant's distribution changed from uneven to even.

50|$|Because {{there is}} no camshaft, there are fewer moving parts. The cam shaft rollers and push rods have been {{replaced}} by an electro-hydraulic actuator system which uses the existing fuel pumps. This reduces development risks of the new system by employing existing technology. Direction changing on older B&W MC engines was engaged by changing the direction of the cam roller. With the new cam-less engine it is controlled by a computer. This gets rid of mechanical failures that can damage the engine if there is a malfunction in the engine when changing directions. Also, {{there is no}} chain connection between the crank shaft and the cam shaft so the engine is lighter with less points of failure. Since there is no camshaft, the parasitic load on the engine output is removed. This is particularly useful in large marine engines that can produce up to 100 megawatts as it can equate to a large amount of power saving. With a cam-less engine, fuel injection and exhaust timing are directly controlled by an Engine control unit and it can be constantly changed and <b>adjusted</b> without <b>stopping</b> the engine. This allows for the engine to run at lower RPM which is useful for maneuvering as it allows slower ship speeds for safe and precise docking. Aditionally, when a ship is maneuvering, the computer controlled Fuel injection and valve timing allows for faster RPM control, hence faster stopping in emergency situations.|$|R
