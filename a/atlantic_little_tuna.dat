40|$|<b>Atlantic</b> <b>little</b> <b>tuna</b> (Euthynnus alletteratus) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} small tuna species in the Mediterranean Sea. This species are commercially exploited in the Spanish coast by traditional fisheries, mainly tuna traps, but also is target by recreational coastal trawl fishery. The aim of this paper is to update biological information about this species in the Western Mediterranean and to show possible differences between these gear catches. Size and weight data were collected from a Spanish Mediterranean trap (la Azohia, Murcia) (100 specimens) and from recreational coastal fisheries (339). Data were collected along 2006 in order to determine size-weight relationships and size distributions of the population. The Atlantic litle tuna collected in Traps ranging from 61 to 85 cm. in fork length (FL) and the specimens caught by the recreational fisheries from 36 to 46 cm. FL. Significative differences were found between both size distributions. The recreational fisheries target mainly juveniles and the traps mainly mature fishes. The size distribution of trawl catches showed a unique modal value (39. 5 cm) suggesting that all specimens correspond to age class 1. The reproductive stock is mainly made of 4 age classes (2 to 5 +). Our data indicates that age class 4 is totally recruited to the trap fishery and constitutes the main age class in the stock reproductive biomass. This and other biological aspects will be discussed in this paper...|$|E

The aim of this research were to study {{the interaction between the}} salt level with time of steaming on the nutritional content (dry matter, crude protein, extract ether, crude fiber, calcium and phosphorus) of rejected <b>little</b> <b>tuna</b> meal. The experimental design was completely randomized design (CRD) 3 x 3 factorial pattern with 3 replications. The first factor was level of salting (A) (A 1 = 2. 5 %, A 2 = 5. 0 %, A 3 = 7. 5 %) the second factor was times of steaming (B) (B 1 = 15 min, B 2 = 30 min, B 3 = 45 minutes). The results showed that the interaction between the level of salt to the time of steaming can maintain quality of rejected <b>little</b> <b>tuna</b> fish processed, it was seen with increasing of nutrient content of crude protein of rejected <b>little</b> <b>tuna</b> (50. 16 - 64. 42 %), and the processing of rejected <b>little</b> <b>tuna</b> by salting and steaming highly significant effect (P < 0. 01) and there is a higly significant interaction (P < 0. 01) through the on dry matter and extract ether rejected <b>little</b> <b>tuna</b> processed.

The results showed that buffer of CAPM- 6 (citric acid aminoprophylmorpholine) resulted in a sharp and clear banding pattern. The species could be differentiated in six diagnostic isozyme patterns Idh* (isocitrate dehydrogenase), 6 Pgd* (6 phosphogluconate dehydrogenase), Gpi* (glucose phosphate isomerase), Mdh* (malate dehydrogenase), Est* (esterase), and Sp* (sarcoplasmic protein). All species were in Hardy-weinberg equilibrium. Heterozygosities of species were ranged from 0. 00 to 0. 099. Yellowfin tuna has the highest heterozigosity compared with the other species. Clustering samples according to pairs revealed that genetic distance of Bullet tuna (A. rochei) and Eastern <b>little</b> <b>tuna</b> (E. affinis) had small value (0. 001).

A total of 353 bluefin tuna (young of the year) and 288 <b>little</b> <b>tuna</b> (young of the year) were collected from the commercial hand line fisheries in the eastern Mediterranean Sea between July and October of 2011 - 2013 with three round-bent hook sizes (numbers 10, 12 and 14; Mustad 2315 S). By using univariate and multivariate analysis, 11 morphometric characters were investigated. anova revealed highly significant differences (P <  0. 001) for all morphometric parameters among the two species. The principal component analysis showed that the difference between the species resulted mainly from preanal length (LA), caudal fin hight (CC), snout length (SnL), eye diameter (ED) and postorbital length (PO).

40|$|Early life {{stages of}} tuna species were {{investigated}} along the Tunisian east coast {{during the summer}} of 2008 by means of a larval survey conducted on board the R/V HANNIBAL. In this study we define the spawning grounds of tuna fishes in Tunisian waters and relate the tuna larvae spatial distribution to the hydrographic features and other environmental parameters. A total of 282 larvae of Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus, Linnaeus, 1758), 902 of bullet tuna (Auxis rochei, Risso, 1810) and 19 of <b>little</b> <b>tuna</b> (Euthynnus alletteratus, Raf, 1810), were identified. High larval concentrations of bluefin tuna were located offshore (mean = 200 ± 18 m), at sea surface temperatures ranging between 23. 7 to 25. 3 °C, whereas the highest concentrations of bullet and <b>little</b> <b>tuna</b> were located in shallower waters (mean = 135 ± 75 m), at sea surface temperature ranging between 25. 1 to 25. 9 °C. According to their preference for waters with surface salinities ranging between 37. 1 and 37. 8, spawning of these species seems to occur mainly in mixed waters. Stations where tuna larvae were collected showed oxygen concentrations between 6. 55 and 6. 85 mg l- 1, as well as low turbidity and chlorophyll a values, from 0. 2 to 0. 5 NTU a d less than 1 mg m- 3, respectively.

However, the little tunny is commercially important in many locations, including the West Indies. It is marketed fresh, dried, canned, smoked, and frozen. It is sought-after as a sport fish due to its line-stripping 64 km/h runs and hard fighting ability when hooked. By trolling with lures near reefs, it can be caught on hook and line.|$|R
