25|$|Following {{another round}} of booing and the {{throwing}} of more cans, Illingworth ordered and led his men from the field <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> {{to some of them}} he had to repeat his order at least twice...Had the Englishmen remained on the field I doubt whether play could have resumed.|$|E
2500|$|Having {{the home}} {{recording}} system also proved useful for production, the band {{felt that it}} would not only benefit themselves, but other local bands who could not afford the studio prices, even in the Welwyn Garden City area. It was here that Billy and Charlotte both stumbled upon the opportunity that would eventually prove significant for the band. [...] "I was producing a local Welwyn Garden City band in my front lounge one day <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> it was quite good so I asked {{if they were going to}} send it to any London venues, because I knew a few that would like it. They said that they were going to send it off to Michael Eavis who runs Glastonbury Festival, and I asked why..." [...] Michael Eavis that year was running an unsigned bands competition to play on the Other Stage, and The Subways decided that would be a great idea. [...] "It was really just another address to send one of our CDs off to. All we wanted was to play shows and this was another great opportunity. The CD we sent off to Michael Eavis was literally one among a bunch of 30 that were being sent out to London promoters for a load of gigs we wanted to book. We never expected the phone call saying that we'd won and were to play Glastonbury", said Cooper on radio. The Subways remain friends with Eavis today, and have suggested that other upcoming bands should send demos to Eavis.|$|E

60|$|Every now {{and again}} she looks towards the door and listens: then turns to the open window. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> each time she looks towards the door the evil in her face shrinks back; but each time she turns to the window it grows more fierce and sullen.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Pappoose!' says John Tom, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> {{the flowers}} {{of the white}} man's syntax have left his tongue. He is the {{original}} proposition in bear's claws and copper color. 'Me bring,' says he, and he lays the kid in his mother's arms. 'Run fifteen mile,' says John Tom--'Ugh! Catch white man. Bring pappoose.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I suspect so," [...] replied Tom, [...] "and it {{does not}} raise my spirits to see Saunders shaking his huge visage so portentously. Do you know, I have a great belief in that fellow. He seems to know {{everything}} and to have gone through every sort of experience, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> most of his prognostications come to pass." ...|$|R
60|$|Lord Langerdale {{shook his}} head, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> {{he failed to}} {{look me in the}} face. I braced myself up with a great effort.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{you think}} you might be mistaken in your {{identification}} of Mr. Stumpy?" [...] he replied, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> again he nearly stumbled in pronouncing the tramp's name.|$|E
60|$|She {{lifted her}} little hand and saluted him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> {{it was after}} another fashion {{to that of the}} Kaffirs who lived thereabouts, after the Zulu fashion indeed.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> then <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> Superstition {{stood in}} the light of the doorway looking down on us.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is {{all very}} mysterious," [...] she said. [...] "I do not {{understand}} it at all. We seem to be almost in hiding here, seeing no one and going nowhere. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> Major Forrest, whenever he walks even in the garden, is always looking around {{as though he were}} afraid of something. What did you quarrel with Lord Ronald about?" ...|$|R
60|$|We talked {{along for}} half an hour, <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> he looked tired, and spoke of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I shouldn't," [...] {{her mother}} advised. [...] "He hates {{anything}} {{that sounds like}} an epigram, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> he avoided any allusion to his birthday last month. Any news, dear?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Then {{the figure}} urged the weary horse and {{advanced}} slowly, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> {{it was very}} small. [...] "A boy," [...] I thought to myself, [...] "who is bringing some message." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Who are you?" [...] asked Captain Flagg of Captain Hannock; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Henshaw {{had laid}} aside his navy-blue suit and badge, and was {{standing}} by apparently as an ordinary passenger.|$|E
6000|$|I have {{traveled}} {{more than anyone}} else, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> even the angels speak English with an accent. [...] --Pudd'nhead Wilson's New Calendar.|$|R
50|$|During {{his stay}} in Frankenthal from 1588 to 1595, he {{influenced}} several better known Flemish émigré landscape painters, {{who are now}} collectively {{referred to as the}} 'Frankenthal School'. The early 17th century art historian Karel van Mander wrote about Coninxloo in his Schilder-boeck. Van Mander stated that Coninxloo's teacher Pieter Coeke van Aelst was his cousin, <b>and</b> that <b>I</b> know at this time of no better landscape painter, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> they are following his manner very much in Holland.|$|R
6000|$|... "John," [...] {{said his}} wife, [...] "you forget, I think, who Mr. Powers is. I {{am sure that}} Angela knows too well what is due to her rank, and to herself, to {{consider}} Mr. Powers anything more than an instructive companion. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that,</b> since Mr. Powers has been your secretary, Angela's mind is much keener. Already the girl has a wonderful grasp on foreign policy. Only yesterday I heard her asking the Prime Minister at luncheon whether we intend to extend our Senegambian protectorate over the Fusees. He was delighted." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{had come}} out from the house, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> her worn face-- on which some past terror seemed to have left its shadow--hardened into stern lines {{as she looked at}} my uncle.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} {{you are not}} feeling well, my dear," [...] she said. [...] "You look as pale as a ghost, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> you {{scarcely}} ate anything at dinner, and were very silent.|$|E
60|$|Ray {{came up to}} us. His dark eyebrows {{were drawn}} close together, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> his boots were clogged with sand. He had the {{appearance}} {{of a man who had}} been walking far and fast.|$|E
60|$|I withdrew it from {{my pocket}} and obeyed him at once. Mr. Parker's fingers seemed to play with {{it for a moment}} <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> at <b>that</b> moment what a strong and capable hand he seemed to have, with fingers of unusual length and suppleness.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Here are the {{transcripts}} from the Chapel {{at the south}} <b>and</b> the east. <b>I</b> have been looking over the writings again; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> find that in seven places round this corner are the symbols of the constellation which we call the Plough, which Queen Tera held to rule her birth <b>and</b> her destiny. <b>I</b> have examined them carefully, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> they are all representations of the grouping of the stars, as the constellation appears {{in different parts of}} the heavens. They are all astronomically correct; and as in the real sky the Pointers indicate the Pole Star, so these all point to one spot in the wall where usually the serdab is to be found!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All {{things are}} good in their way," [...] said Shaggy; [...] "but {{we may have}} too much of any good thing. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> have <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> the value of {{anything}} depends upon how scarce it is, and {{how difficult it is}} to obtain." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{telling of}} this grim story had cast a chill upon all of us. My uncle {{held out his}} hands towards the blaze, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> they were as white as the ruffles which fringed them.|$|E
60|$|Immediately Lancey {{stood by}} my side. He looked wonderfully real, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> the fiery frame was not round him {{as it used}} to be. A moment later, the pretty face of Ivanka also glided into the picture.|$|E
60|$|I {{looked at}} Parkins more closely <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> {{he had on}} some sort of foolish little coat, short in the back, and the kind of bow-tie that they wear in the Hungarian bands of the Sixth Avenue restaurants.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Bundercombe and {{she seemed}} to have a good deal {{to say to each other}} <b>and</b> {{presently}} <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> their heads were drawing closer together. The girl dropped her voice. She was proposing something to which Mr. Bundercombe was listening with keen interest. I heard him sigh.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your wife {{is doing}} my patient {{a great deal}} more good than I have ever been able to do," [...] Dr. Green said one day to the schoolmaster. [...] "She has become quite a {{different}} woman in the last five or six weeks. She is always up and on the sofa now when <b>I</b> call, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> she begins to take pains with her dress again; and that, you know, is always a first rate sign with a woman. I think {{she would be able to}} go downstairs again soon, were it not for her feeling about Ned. She would not meet him, I am sure. You don't see any signs of a change in that quarter, I suppose?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{drove off}} fast, and only {{broke into a}} walk just before you met us. The innkeeper would have gone into the house again, before we met; <b>and</b> as <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> the {{shutters}} were up, he certainly would not have supposed that the vehicle which passed was our carriage, coming back again.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> {{up above}} the snow, frail in the bluish sky, a frail moon had put forth, like a thin, {{scalloped}} film of ice floated out on the slow current of the coming night. And a bell sounded.|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{was looking}} at the chart the last day I was on board, sir, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> Timor lay to the south of where we were then, and I should say it was {{something}} like six or seven hundred miles away.” ...|$|E
60|$|We watched {{each other}} for a few minutes; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> his mouth kept opening and shutting, though he said nothing. Suddenly, edging closer to me, he spoke in a thick whisper. It sounded as though his mouth were full of wool.|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't know it," [...] said Elliott slowly. [...] "I {{read the}} {{calendar}} announcement only once, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> certainly didn't <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> condition." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “First {{you hear}} that awful buzzing or whizzing, and then {{something}} seems to strike {{you in the face}} <b>and</b> head. <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> at first the boys threw their hands to their heads every time a shell went over; but they soon came so fast and so close that it was a roaring, shrieking, crashing hell.|$|R
5000|$|... 'A dancer {{must have}} {{tremendous}} personality. A God like Christ {{and even a}} godman like Rajneesh had some personality. Combination of talent, dedication, creativity and being emotive is imperative. A coupling of these four qualities with technique is essential. Monotony is deterrent as it regards your style <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> today, <b>that</b> new dancers perform in a startlingly similar fashion.' ...|$|R
