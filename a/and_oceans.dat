5|$|Seabirds {{evolved to}} exploit {{different}} food {{resources in the}} world's seas <b>and</b> <b>oceans,</b> and to a great extent, their physiology and behaviour have been shaped by their diet. These evolutionary forces have often caused species in different families and even orders to evolve similar strategies and adaptations to the same problems, leading to remarkable convergent evolution, such as that between auks and penguins. There are four basic feeding strategies, or ecological guilds, for feeding at sea: surface feeding, pursuit diving, plunge diving and predation of higher vertebrates; within these guilds there are multiple variations on the theme.|$|E
5|$|The {{bill was}} {{referred}} to the Natural Resources Committee, which then referred it to its Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife <b>and</b> <b>Oceans,</b> chaired by Bordallo. Hearings were held a week later, at which Shelley Clarke, a researcher at Imperial College London who studies the shark-fin trade, observed that transshipment operations such as the KD IIs were common and would likely continue as the competition in Hong Kong, the industry's traditional center, grew more intense. While the transshipment ban was an effective response to the decision, she suggested that shipments of containerized fins be allowed {{if they had been}} separated from their carcasses after landing.|$|E

As a result, the slightly greater attraction that the Moon has for the side of Earth closest to the Moon, as compared to the part of the Earth opposite the Moon, results in tidal forces.

5|$|With {{the average}} {{concentration}} of about 8 {{parts per million}} (ppm), samarium is the 40th most abundant element in the Earth's crust. It is the fifth most abundant lanthanide and is more common than elements such as tin. Samarium concentration in soils varies between 2 and 23ppm, <b>and</b> <b>oceans</b> contain about 0.5–0.8parts per trillion. Distribution of samarium in soils strongly depends on its chemical state and is very inhomogeneous: in sandy soils, samarium concentration is about 200 times higher at the surface of soil particles than in the water trapped between them, and this ratio can exceed 1,000 in clays.|$|E
5|$|The Earth {{was formed}} {{approximately}} 4.5billion years ago. As it cooled and a crust <b>and</b> <b>oceans</b> formed, its atmosphere transformed from being dominated by hydrogen to one composed mostly of methane and ammonia. Over the next billion years, the metabolic activity of life transformed the atmosphere into {{a mixture of}} carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and water vapor. These gases changed the way that light from the sun hit the Earth's surface and greenhouse effects trapped heat. There were untapped sources of free energy within the mixture of reducing and oxidizing gasses that {{set the stage for}} primitive ecosystems to evolve and, in turn, the atmosphere also evolved.|$|E

5|$|The {{project was}} divided into three phases, {{expected}} to cost a total of $68million. Phase1 consisted of the prevention of erosion along the shorelines, improvements to the nearby drainage system, {{and the construction of}} dikes and aboiteaux; the work was carried out from 7 July 2008, to 14 April 2010. Phase2 consists of opening the gates to monitor river flow, both upstream and downstream, for two years. Phase3, commenced in 2012, consisted of the bridge's development and the removal of the causeway, and is anticipated to be completed in 2015. Confusion arose {{as to whether or not}} the project would be funded by the federal government. They refused, in spite of an earlier comment from the Department of Fisheries <b>and</b> <b>Oceans,</b> which had hinted at a possible negotiation. Unwilling to wait, the provincial government came forward with an initial $20million on 7 July 2008, to begin the first phase.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{predict that}} glaciers will {{continue}} to recede and melt or, in some areas, disappear. It is also predicted that the Cuyo region could face a potential water crisis due {{to an increase in}} water demand caused by a reduction in river streamflows. In northern Patagonia, a similar situation is projected in which there will be a negative impact on fruit and vegetable growing owing to a reduction in the river flow in the Colorado and Chubut rivers. In the north and central parts of the country, the higher temperatures and lower precipitation projected for this region will lead to higher evaporation, intensifying droughts and leading to desertification. Heat waves could become more frequent and intense, negatively impacting agricultural production while placing more demand on energy needs. Intense precipitation could become more common, increasing the likelihood of suffering from events such as flooding, since most of its population lives in urban areas near a body of water (rivers, lakes <b>and</b> <b>oceans).</b> Climate change could extend the habitats of vectors carrying tropical diseases such as malaria southwards. Though most of the coastal regions of Argentina will not suffer permanent flooding associated with sea level rise, it is predicted that storm surges will become more frequent in coastal areas, affecting locations such as Buenos Aires.|$|E
