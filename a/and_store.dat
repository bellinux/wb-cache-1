50|$|Memory {{dependence}} {{prediction is}} a technique, employed by high-performance out-of-order execution microprocessors that execute memory access operations (loads <b>and</b> <b>stores)</b> out of program order, to predict true dependencies between loads <b>and</b> <b>stores</b> at instruction execution time. With the predicted dependence information, the processor can then decide to speculatively execute certain loads <b>and</b> <b>stores</b> out of order, while preventing other loads <b>and</b> <b>stores</b> from executing out-of-order (keeping them in-order). Later in the pipeline, memory disambiguation techniques {{are used to}} determine if the loads <b>and</b> <b>stores</b> were correctly executed and, if not, to recover.|$|R
5|$|Actors {{and crew}} used their iPhones to {{communicate}} <b>and</b> <b>store</b> {{information such as}} the script—that way, they looked like guests casually using their phones. The phones were also used to record sound, in addition to digital recorders taped to each actor's body that were left running all day. For day scenes, Moore felt comfortable risking {{only three or four}} takes of each scene, but found he could do more at night.|$|E
5|$|By the 1890s, Svalbard {{had become}} a {{destination}} for Arctic tourism, coal deposits had been found and the islands were {{being used as a}} base for Arctic exploration. The first mining was along Isfjorden by Norwegians in 1899; by 1904, British interests had established themselves in Adventfjorden and started the first all-year operations. Production in Longyearbyen, by American interests, started in 1908; <b>and</b> <b>Store</b> Norske established itself in 1916, as did other Norwegian interests during the war, in part by buying American interests.|$|E
5|$|Floating {{storage and}} {{offloading}} units (FSO) are used worldwide by the offshore oil industry to receive oil from nearby platforms <b>and</b> <b>store</b> {{it until it}} can be offloaded onto oil tankers. A similar system, the floating production storage and offloading unit (FPSO), {{has the ability to}} process the product while it is on board. These floating units reduce oil production costs and offer mobility, large storage capacity, and production versatility.|$|E

5000|$|The first option, making loads <b>and</b> <b>stores</b> go in-order, avoids RAW dependences {{because there}} is no {{possibility}} of a load executing before its producer <b>store</b> <b>and</b> obtaining incorrect data. Another possibility is to effectively break loads <b>and</b> <b>stores</b> into two operations: address generation and cache access. With these two separate but linked operations, the CPU can allow loads <b>and</b> <b>stores</b> to access the memory system only once all previous loads <b>and</b> <b>stores</b> have had their address generated and buffered in the LSQ. After address generation, there are no longer any ambiguous dependencies since all addresses are known, and so dependent loads will not be executed until their corresponding stores complete. This scheme still allows for some [...] "out-of-orderness"—the address generation operations for any in-flight loads <b>and</b> <b>stores</b> can execute out-of-order, and once addresses have been generated, the cache accesses for each load or store can happen in any order that respects the (now known) true dependences.|$|R
30|$|The forward {{distribution}} system is usually characterized by its sources (=dispatching locations), destinations (=points of reception) and associated links. To understand {{distribution system}}s within OC retailing, {{we need to}} consider the different types of sources (e.g., DCs <b>and</b> <b>stores)</b> <b>and</b> destinations (e.g., <b>stores</b> <b>and</b> customers) in the physical distribution structure, as well as possible delivery processes and modes, i.e., shipments to customers <b>and</b> <b>stores</b> (e.g., Fernie <b>and</b> Sparks 2009; Hübner et al. 2013 a).|$|R

Initially {{it was used}} to receive <b>and</b> <b>store</b> equipment used by the Project.

Analysis of bioassay samples was carried out there to minimize the danger of polonium contamination of the samples.|$|E
5|$|In South Africa, ants {{are used}} to help harvest rooibos (Aspalathus linearis), which are small seeds {{used to make a}} herbal tea.

Up to half a pound (200g) of seeds may be collected from one ant-heap.|$|E

5|$|A {{strategy}} {{for dealing with}} seasonal plenty is to eat {{as much as possible}} <b>and</b> <b>store</b> the surplus nutrients as fat. Marmots do this, and may be 50% heavier in the autumn than in the spring. They rely on their fat reserves during their long winter hibernation. Beavers feed on the leaves, buds, and inner bark of growing trees, as well as aquatic plants. They store food for winter use by felling small trees and leafy branches in the autumn and immersing them in their pond, sticking the ends into the mud to anchor them. Here, they can access their food supply underwater even when their pond is frozen over.|$|E
5|$|Agouti {{species are}} one of the few animal groups that can break open the large {{capsules}} of the Brazil nut fruit. Too many seeds are inside to be consumed in one meal, so the agouti carries some off and caches them. This helps dispersal of the seeds as any that the agouti fails to retrieve are distant from the parent tree when they germinate. Other nut-bearing trees tend to bear a glut of fruits in the autumn. These are too numerous to be eaten in one meal and squirrels gather <b>and</b> <b>store</b> the surplus in crevices and hollow trees. In desert regions, seeds are often available only for short periods. The kangaroo rat collects all it can find and stores them in larder chambers in its burrow.|$|E
