Among the regularly featured local groups are the Joffrey Ballet, Hubbard Street Dance Chicago and Chicago Opera Theater. It provides subsidized rental, technical expertise, and marketing support for the companies using it, and turned a profit in its fourth fiscal year.|$|E
5|$|The term hatt-ı hümayun is {{occasionally}} used in {{the literal}} sense of the handwriting of the Sultan. For example, the imperial poet Nef'i has written a masnavi of 22 couplets describing the calligraphy of Sultan Murad IV, called Der-Vasf-ı Hatt-ı Humayun-ı Sultan Murad Han. The whole poem is <b>a</b> <b>compliment</b> to {{the writings of the}} Sultan.|$|E

5|$|The helmet of {{the arms}} was not {{specified}} in the charter, but the engraver sketched out a peer's helmet on the final design, which is used. This {{is contrary to the}} heraldic rules, as a society or corporation normally has an esquire's helmet; it is thought that either the engraver was ignorant of this rule, which was not strictly adhered to until around 1615, or that he used the peer's helmet as <b>a</b> <b>compliment</b> to Lord Brouncker, a peer and the first President of the Royal Society.|$|E
5|$|All {{housing and}} major hangars were {{completed}} in 1918, including a large steel-and-wood hangar, two concrete hangars for seaplanes and flying boats, a supply warehouse, a machine shop, a photography laboratory and a powerhouse. In 1919, {{the field was}} named Luke Field after Frank Luke, a World War I ace and Medal of Honor recipient. The U.S. Army's introduction of aviation to Ford Island triggered expansion throughout Hawaii {{with the development of}} civilian airports, the creation of the Hawaii chapter of the National Aeronautic Association, and a national flying code. The army's aviation division was generally favorably received by the Hawaiians, who took the military's investment in their land as <b>a</b> <b>compliment.</b>|$|E

5|$|In May, a {{delegation}} of 31 Samogitian nobles arrived in Königsberg and promised loyalty to Vytautas by signing the Treaty of Königsberg. The joint forces of Vytautas and the Teutonic Knights consisted largely of volunteers and mercenaries from western Europe, notably from France, the German states, and England. Henry, Earl of Derby, the future King Henry IV of England and Marshal of France Jean Le Maingre were among the participants. The English crusaders left detailed records of their actions in Prussia and Lithuania, and their exploits were mentioned by Geoffrey Chaucer in the Canterbury Tales, possibly as <b>a</b> <b>compliment</b> to the English knights and the future king. In the meantime, Jogaila achieved some military successes; his forces captured several castles in Podlaskie, leaving them to be guarded by Polish garrisons, and took Hrodna in April 1390 after a six-week siege.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, Richards {{preferred}} to arrange his rotation so that Pierce started only every fifth or sixth day, holding him back against weaker teams but using him more often for big {{games against the}} powerful Yankees and Indians. Catcher Sherm Lollar later observed that although it was essentially <b>a</b> <b>compliment</b> to Pierce's ability, he might have picked up more victories and won 20 games sooner in his career had he faced each opponent more equally. With a 1–0 two-hitter at Washington on August 3, in which the White Sox won on an unearned run {{in the ninth inning}} with a hit batter, error and sacrifice fly, Pierce began a streak of 39⅔ consecutive scoreless innings – the longest such streak in the AL between 1926, when Ted Lyons had a 41-inning streak for the White Sox, and 1968; it remains the fifth longest ever by a left-hander, and the longest by an AL southpaw since 1905. The streak ended when he allowed two unearned runs against the Browns in the sixth inning on August 19; two additional earned runs in the tenth inning ended his streak, dating to July 29, of 49⅔ innings without an earned run, and gave him a 4–3 loss. He led the league in strikeouts (186) and was second in ERA (2.72), and on September 27 started for the White Sox in the final game in Browns history, winning 2–1 in 11 innings at St. Louis. His seven shutouts that season were the second most by an AL left-hander since 1916, matched only by Hal Newhouser's 1945 total of eight.|$|E
5|$|Sky Sports {{said that}} during the 2011–12 season McLean had begun to emerge {{as one of the}} top young talents in the SPL. His first game of the season was on 6 August, in a 1–1 draw against Dundee United, where he came on as an 80th-minute substitute. His first start came a week later in a 1–0 loss to Motherwell. McLean then played {{regularly}} in the first team over the next few months and was in excellent form. He scored his first senior goal in a 1–0 win over St Johnstone on 29 October and was rewarded with the SPL Young Player of the Month award for October 2011. After this, team-mate Gary Teale said that he thought McLean was very similar to former Rangers and Scotland captain Barry Ferguson, and that he thought McLean would have a brilliant future in the game. In the weeks leading up to his award, McLean had been watched by English Championship clubs Burnley and Crystal Palace, with Celtic also reportedly interested in him. Lennon encouraged interest from other clubs, saying that he took it as <b>a</b> <b>compliment</b> to McLean's development. But he also said that he would not consider selling McLean in the near future and expressed his delight at the fact that he had already signed McLean on a long-term contract. On 19 November, McLean scored his second goal for St Mirren, in a 2–1 win over Dunfermline Athletic. He then scored St Mirren's first goal, on 10 December, as they came from behind to secure a 2–2 draw against Aberdeen. McLean was one of the four players nominated for the SPL young Player of the Year Award. In January 2014 it was announced that McLean would be out-of-action for 6 weeks following knee surgery.|$|E

50|$|Falconer {{states that}} <b>a</b> <b>compliments</b> slip {{should never be}} sent instead of a {{personal}} letter, {{and that it is}} better to send a personal letter in response to a customer enquiry, because it provides a personal touch.

25|$|The city of Huntington is {{protected}} by 106 professional firefighters of the Huntington Fire Department (HFD), founded in 1897. The department currently provides nine fully staffed companies with <b>a</b> <b>compliment</b> of support staff and apparatus responding from six strategically located fire stations throughout the city. The six stations consist of six engine companies, two ladder trucks, a rescue truck, a marine unit, and several reserve engines, reserve utility trucks, and staff vehicles.|$|E
25|$|Many {{traditional}} {{drinks are}} indigenous to Russia {{and are not}} present in other national cuisines. The most notable of these are vodka, sbiten', kvass, medovukha and mors. Many of them are no longer common and {{have been replaced by}} drinks originating in Europe. Nonetheless, these beverages were formerly drunk as <b>a</b> <b>compliment</b> to meat and poultry dishes, sweet porridge, and dessert. Of particular note is sbiten, an immensely popular medieval drink which has since been replaced by tea as the Russian mainstay beverage.|$|E

25|$|Woodall and Constantine {{have been}} parodied many times on comedy {{impression}} programmes. Alistair McGowan's Big Impression took to spoofing their personalities on What Not to Wear, as did 2DTV who made cartoon versions of Woodall and Constantine giving Santa Claus a makeover, where they stripped {{him of his}} red suit and added a casual shirt and trousers. Avid Merrion's Bo' Selecta! took to portraying them as lesbians. In an interview, despite being lampooned on Bo' Selecta!, they commented that the portrayal was <b>a</b> <b>compliment</b> as they often feel women's breasts during makeovers on their show.|$|E
25|$|In addition, the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network, {{a service}} devoted mainly to {{programming}} {{of interest to}} the Aboriginal peoples of Canada, is considered a network by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, although the network airs terrestrially only in the three Canadian territories, and must be carried by all television providers in the rest of Canada. There are, as well, a number of smaller television systems, such as CTV Two (<b>a</b> <b>compliment</b> to the main CTV network in smaller and secondary markets), and Omni Television—a group of Rogers-owned ethnic broadcasters.|$|E
25|$|Robert Burns {{lived at}} the nearby Ellisland Farm from 1788 to 1791.

In September 1788 he composed The Day Returns as <b>a</b> <b>compliment</b> to Riddell and his wife, commenting that At their fire-side I have enjoyed more pleasant evenings than at all the houses of fashionable {{people in this country}} put together. Robert had fought in the American War and was an accomplished musical composer and musician as well as an antiquarian.|$|E
