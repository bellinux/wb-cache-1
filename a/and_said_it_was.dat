5|$|The {{banks of}} the {{reservoir}} are listed as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) due to the diversity of waxcap fungi discovered growing on them. WPD appealed against this listing stating the Countryside Council for Wales's (CCW) decision was 'premature, arbirtrary and unfair', but in January 2007 a High Court Judge upheld the SSSI designation <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> 'an important site'.|$|E

Several United States congressmen and fiscal conservatives protested the {{proposal}} {{on the grounds that}} the money that would be spent on its construction would be better used to support other projects. They pointed to the lack of existing infrastructure in the region <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> unlikely that enough electricity generated by the dam could be sold at a high enough price to pay for its construction.|$|E
5|$|Speer {{placed his}} {{department}} {{at the disposal of}} the Wehrmacht. When Hitler remonstrated, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not for Speer to decide how his workers should be used, Speer simply ignored him. Among Speer's innovations were quick-reaction squads to construct roads or clear away debris; before long, these units would be used to clear bomb sites. As the war progressed, initially to great German success, Speer continued preliminary work on the Berlin and Nürnberg plans. Speer also oversaw the construction of buildings for the Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe.|$|E

Around this time, he also wrote an outline for a television comedy series about four girls sharing a flat, inspired by his real-life daughter, who was in her early twenties {{and living in a}} flat with other girls her age.

25|$|Horowitz's Frontpage Magazine {{published}} Ron Radosh's {{critical review}} of Diana West's book American Betrayal. Conservatives John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr, scholars of Soviet espionage, defended Horowitz for publishing the review and Radosh for writing it. Vladimir Bukovsky, a Soviet dissident, rejected Radosh's criticisms <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{an attempt to}} portray West as a historically inept conspiracy-monger. Horowitz defended the review in an article on Breitbart's Big Government website.|$|E

25|$|The {{body of the}} {{headless}} {{woman was}} of deep concern to La Porte residents. C.

Nicholson, and so did Mrs. Austin Cutler, an old friend of Gunness. More of Gunness' old friends, Mrs. May Olander and Mr. Sigward Olsen, arrived from Chicago. They examined the remains of the headless woman <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not Gunness.|$|E

25|$|Bat Masterson {{became more}} widely {{known as a}} gunfighter {{as a result of}} a {{practical}} joke played on a gullible newspaper reporter in August 1881. Seeking copy in Gunnison, Colorado, the reporter asked Dr. W.S. Cockrell about mankillers. Dr. Cockrell pointed to a young man nearby <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Bat and that he had killed 26 men. Cockrell then regaled the reporter with several lurid tales about Bat's exploits, and the reporter wrote them up for the New York Sun. The story was then widely reprinted in papers all over the country. Cockrell subsequently apologized to Bat, who insisted he was not even in Gunnison at the time.|$|E
25|$|In March 2015, Lara criticised the ICC for fining Pakistani cricket player Wahab Riaz {{after his}} 'shocking spell', {{as it was}} dubbed, when he managed to puzzle Australian player Shane Watson by giving him sarcastic claps, {{throwing}} the ball at him and sending him flying kisses. Watson was unable to cope with that and Riaz's high-quality bowling in the 2015 ICC World Cup. The team lost but Riaz was fined 50% of his match fee for his behaviour. Lara criticised this decision by the ICC <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> 'uncalled for'. He {{said it was the}} only highlights of the game and said he would pay the fine himself. He said he wanted to meet Riaz himself.|$|E

Naftogaz CEO Vladimir Trykolych said that Naftogaz owed $1.26–1.27billion to RosUkrEnergo in total, but claimed that Naftogaz had no debt to Gazprom. However, on December 2, Naftogaz {{acknowledged that it}} owed $1billion to Gazprom, <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> having trouble making payments on time due to unexpected losses in 2008. Later in mid-December, Gazprom stated that a debt of $2.195billion had accumulated. In response, Naftogaz made a payment of $800million, and promised to pay another $200million soon. Gazprom proposed to make an upfront transit payment at the 2008 rate {{in order to provide}} funds for the debt to be cleared, but Naftogaz rejected the offer.|$|E
25|$|After $19 million total {{had been}} spent, the cathedral was reopened in 2010 and rededicated on its 158th anniversary later that year. A {{thousand}} people attended the Mass celebrated by Hubbard {{along with his}} New York counterpart, Timothy Dolan, and Dolan's predecessor, Cardinal Edward Egan. Hubbard called the cathedral's presence among the many state government buildings nearby {{a reminder of the}} presence of God in human affairs <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> for the whole community, not just Albany's Catholics. He called particular attention to the restored original colors, recalling how he had been disappointed with the building's gloomy interior on his first visit to it as a boy. Many who attended were impressed with the restoration, particularly the return of the original paint.|$|E
25|$|Younis {{said he did}} {{not want}} to blame {{individuals}} but largely singled out players, particularly Afridi. He said Akmal should not have been selected, instead it should be players who are 'proud' to represent their country. He also said that the team lost the Asia cup in February 2016 because they were 'unfit' as they had not trained during PSL season <b>and</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> like a 'holiday for them'. Overall, he blamed it on poor captaincy from Afridi. He said it was unfair for him to first use Mohammad Nawaz, a new player, as a bowler in the Asia Cup 2016 because it 'destroyed' his confidence when he was unable to handle it after being hit for 38 runs in 3 overs. Younis later posted on his Twitter – 'no one wants to hear the truth'.|$|E
