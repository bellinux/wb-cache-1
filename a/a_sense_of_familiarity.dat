25|$|The Okinawan {{origin of}} the word, however, has long been questioned. In fact, it was in {{mainland}} Japan that the word was first attested and eventually came to refer to Okinawa. The first known reference to uruma is a waka poem by Fujiwara no Kintō in the early 11th century. He compared a woman's coldheartedness to the incomprehensible speech of drifters from Ureung Island (迂陵島, identified as Ulleung Island) of Goryeo Kingdom, which Kintō called Silla, a practice rather common in Heian-period Japan. However, the association with Ulleung Island was soon forgotten because the reference to Silla was dropped when his poem was recorded in the Senzai Wakashū (1188). Thereafter waka poets only thought uruma as an island somewhere outside Japan with an unintelligible language. At the same time, it evoked <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>familiarity</b> because the phrase uruma no ichi (market in Uruma) was poetically associated with Mino Province. From the viewpoint of mainland Japanese poets, Okinawa {{might have been an}} ideal referent of uruma because, despite the exotic name of Ryūkyū, the first reference to Okinawan-composed waka poems was as early as 1496. The first known identification of uruma as Okinawa Island {{can be found in the}} Moshiogusa (1513), but the association remained weak for some time. For example, Hokkaido, in addition to Okinawa, was referred to as uruma in the Shōzaishū (1597). The mainland Japanese poetic practice was adopted by Okinawan waka poets in the late 17th century. The Omoidegusa (1700), a purely Japanese poetic diary by Shikina Seimei, is known for its extensive use of the word uruma.|$|E

500|$|There is {{a long-standing}} notion that {{epilepsy}} and religion are linked, {{and it has}} been speculated that many religious figures had temporal lobe epilepsy. The temporal lobes generate the feeling of [...] "I", and give <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>familiarity</b> or strangeness to the perceptions of the senses. The temporal lobes and adjacent anterior insular cortex seem to be involved in mystical experiences, and in the change in personality that may result from such experiences.|$|E

500|$|Francisca Goldsmith, a {{librarian}} and comics reviewer, found Lat's scenes to be [...] "scribbly", yet [...] "wonderfully detailed". [...] Similarly, comics journalist Greg McElhatton commented that The Kampung Boy was [...] "a strange mix of caricature and careful, fine detail." [...] These two views {{lend support to}} Muliyadi's assertion that Lat demonstrated his strength in The Kampung Boy; his eye for detail extended to his characters and, more importantly, the surroundings. [...] Lat's characters look, dress, act, and talk like real Malaysians would, and they are placed in environments that are readily identifiable with local jungles, villages, and cities. [...] The faithful details impart <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>familiarity</b> to Malaysian readers and make the scenes convincing to others.|$|E
500|$|... "To the Core" [...] {{is another}} short {{hardcore}} song that Greene describes as [...] "a ferocious, fever-pitched number written and delivered with pure vitriol". McIlarth notes that [...] "Torches" [...] {{is a very}} different when compared to most of the band's material, due to its heavy metal intro and breakdown. The penultimate track, [...] "Amber Changing", is more muted in its sound, and has McIlrath sing about not wanting a great moment in a relationship to end. The album ends with a hidden track, a cover of [...] "Any Way You Want It" [...] by Journey. The band covered the song to bring <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>familiarity</b> to listeners while on tour.|$|E
500|$|Super Metroid was {{developed}} by Nintendo R {{with a staff of}} 15 people managed by Gunpei Yokoi. The game was directed and written by Yoshio Sakamoto, and produced by Makoto Kano. Intelligent Systems, who co-developed the original Metroid with R, handled the programming for Super Metroid. The opening dialogue was voiced by Dan Owsen, an employee of Nintendo of America. The game, which was released almost a decade after the original Metroid game, took half a year to gain approval for the initial idea, and actual development of the game took two more years to complete. When asked why the game took so long to make, Sakamoto responded, [...] "We wanted to wait until a true action game was needed. [...] And also to {{set the stage for the}} reappearance of Samus Aran." [...] Previously visited areas were added to Super Metroid to add <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>familiarity</b> that would satisfy players of previous Metroid games.|$|E

500|$|The {{production}} selected two adjacent properties on the Warner backlot's [...] "Blondie Street" [...] for the Burnham and Fitts' homes. The crew {{rebuilt the}} houses to incorporate false rooms that established lines of sight—between Ricky and Jane's bedroom windows, and between Ricky's bedroom and Lester's garage. The garage windows were {{designed specifically to}} obtain the crucial shot {{toward the end of}} the film in which Col. Fitts—watching from Ricky's bedroom—mistakenly assumes that Lester is paying Ricky for sex. Mendes made sure to establish the line of sight early on in the film to make the audience feel <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>familiarity</b> with the shot. The house interiors were filmed on the backlot, on location, and on soundstages when overhead shots were needed. The inside of the Burnhams' home was shot at a house close to Interstate 405 and Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles; the inside of the Fitts' home was shot in the city's Hancock Park neighborhood. Ricky's bedroom was designed to be cell-like to suggest his [...] "monkish" [...] personality, while at the same time blending with the high-tech equipment to reflect his voyeuristic side. The production deliberately minimized the use of red, as it was an important thematic signature elsewhere. The Burnhams' home uses cool blues, while the Fitts' is kept in a [...] "depressed military palette".|$|E
500|$|Two other {{characters}} also reappear several times within the quest. Waka appears to Amaterasu {{several times in}} the game as a beautiful young flute-playing man in costume resembling a tengu (more precisely, a tengu dressed like a yamabushi, which is a frequent tengu appearance). He is aware of the goddess's true identity and foretells her future and at times battles with her. He leads the Tao Troopers whose members Abe and Kamo are based on the two famous onmyōji Abe no Seimei and Kamo no Yasunori. Waka's dialogue, dropping French affectionate terms at times, conveys <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>familiarity</b> with Amaterasu, as it turns out that Waka is much older than he appears and has walked with Amaterasu on the Celestial Plain hundreds of years ago. The other is Orochi, the eight-headed demon and a major villain within the game which the player will encounter several times. Orochi repeatedly has threatened Kamiki village, demanding a sacrifice of a young woman. Each of its eight heads is infused with a different elemental magic power, but the entire demon is susceptible to a special brew of sake available only at Kamiki Village, allowing Amaterasu to defeat it while in its stupor. Amaterasu trusts Queen Himiko, the ruler of [...] "Sei-an City", who is killed by one of the demons.|$|E
2500|$|Although Meissonnier {{altered the}} song structure, {{he did not}} alter Adé's style. To Westerners, Adé's music seemed eclectic, with reviewers of Juju Music commenting {{variously}} on the mingling of [...] "the spacey mixing techniques of Jamaican dub" [...] into Adé's [...] "Nigerian polyrhythms", and—even more minutely—on the [...] "echoes of old reggae in its lean guitar riffs, salsa in its Yoruban drum patterns, country in the steel-guitar playing, dub in the music's wide-open holes, folk and calypso in its gentle singing and the Grateful Dead and jazz in its long jams". At {{the time of the}} album's release, New York Times reviewer Robert Palmer speculated that Adé's Yoruban heritage might lead listeners in America to <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>familiarity</b> with Adé's music, as the Yoruban culture has far-flung influences in other cultures and musical types. Rather than catalog those represented types, Palmer described Adé's style as a [...] "fusion of traditional Yoruba drumming with a pop instrumentation that includes pedal steel guitar and synthesizer".|$|E
50|$|In {{a similar}} vein, Friedman & Trott (2000) found that young adult {{participants}} displayed a robust Dm effect when {{they not only}} remembered seeing a word, but could also remember some details of the context of when it was presented. In comparison, a Dm effect for items that were subsequently judged as old, but only from <b>a</b> general <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>familiarity,</b> did not emerge. A Dm effect was found in both conditions for older adults.|$|R

60|$|The {{newcomer}} {{showed no}} resentment at Francis' little outburst. He simply smiled with deprecating amiability--a tall, spare man, with lean, hard face, complexion almost unnaturally white; black hair, plentifully besprinkled with grey; a thin, cynical mouth, notwithstanding its distinctly humourous curve, and keen, almost brilliant dark eyes. He {{was dressed in}} ordinary dinner garb; his linen and jewellery was indeed {{in the best possible}} taste. Francis, at his second glance, was troubled with <b>a</b> vague <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>familiarity.</b>|$|R

60|$|In a flash Buck knew it. The {{time had}} come. It {{was to the}} death. As they circled about, snarling, ears laid back, keenly watchful for the advantage, the scene came to Buck with <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>familiarity.</b> He seemed to {{remember}} it all,--the white woods, and earth, and moonlight, and the thrill of battle. Over the whiteness and silence brooded a ghostly calm. There was not the faintest whisper of air--nothing moved, not a leaf quivered, the visible breaths of the dogs rising slowly and lingering in the frosty air. They had made short work of the snowshoe rabbit, these dogs that were ill-tamed wolves; and they were now drawn up in an expectant circle. They, too, were silent, their eyes only gleaming and their breaths drifting slowly upward. To Buck it was nothing new or strange, this scene of old time. It was {{as though it had}} always been, the wonted way of things.|$|E
60|$|Smoke {{was leading}} {{when they finally}} caught up, and {{he was glad to}} ease to a walk at their heels. Almost {{immediately}} he got the impression that the one nearer him was a woman. How this impression came, he could not tell. Hooded and furred, the dark form was as any form; yet there was <b>a</b> haunting <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>familiarity</b> about it. He waited for the next flame of the aurora, and by its light saw the smallness of the moccasined feet. But he saw more--the walk, and knew it for the unmistakable walk he had once resolved never to forget.|$|R
