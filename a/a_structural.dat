5|$|Structural {{alignments}} {{can compare}} two sequences or multiple sequences. Because these alignments rely on information {{about all the}} query sequences' three-dimensional conformations, the method can only be used on sequences where these structures are known. These are usually found by X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. It is possible to perform <b>a</b> <b>structural</b> alignment on structures produced by structure prediction methods. Indeed, evaluating such predictions often requires <b>a</b> <b>structural</b> alignment between the model and the true known structure to assess the model's quality. Structural alignments are especially useful in analyzing data from structural genomics and proteomics efforts, {{and they can be}} used as comparison points to evaluate alignments produced by purely sequence-based bioinformatics methods.|$|E

5|$|Although {{it is an}} attractive-looking bolete, Caloboletus calopus is not {{considered}} edible on account of its very bitter taste, which does not disappear upon cooking. There are reports of it being eaten in far eastern Russia and Ukraine. The bitter taste {{is largely due to}} the compounds calopin and a δ-lactone derivative, O-acetylcyclocalopinA. These compounds contains <b>a</b> <b>structural</b> motif known as a 3-methylcatechol unit, which is rare in natural products. A total synthesis of calopin was reported in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Although the LWF {{program called}} for <b>a</b> <b>structural</b> life of 4,000 flight hours, capable of {{achieving}} 7.33g with 80% internal fuel; GD's engineers decided {{to design the}} F-16's airframe life for 8,000 hours and for 9-g maneuvers on full internal fuel. This proved advantageous when the aircraft's mission changed from solely air-to-air combat to multi-role operations. Changes in operational use and additional systems have increased weight, necessitating multiple structural strengthening programs.|$|E

The collapse caused major changes in UK building regulations and led to the decline of further building of high rise council flats that had characterised 1960s public architecture.|$|E

30|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to present <b>a</b> two-step <b>structural</b> design {{technology}} for circularly polarized offset cable mesh reflectors with high beam pointing accuracy. The two-step pretension design combines <b>a</b> simple <b>structural</b> design and <b>an</b> integrated <b>structural</b> electromagnetic optimization. With this technology, high electromagnetic performance especially high beam pointing accuracy can be achieved in the antenna structural design. This technology not only can compensate the beam squint angle of circular polarizations, but also can produce a well-designed cable mesh reflector with on-focus feeds. Comparing with the compensation methods proposed by electromagnetism designers, the limited weakness of aforementioned methods can be overcame.|$|R
5|$|DNA {{nanotechnology}} {{uses the}} unique molecular recognition properties of DNA and other nucleic acids to create self-assembling branched DNA complexes with useful properties. DNA is thus used as <b>a</b> <b>structural</b> material {{rather than as}} a carrier of biological information. This has {{led to the creation of}} two-dimensional periodic lattices (both tile-based and using the DNA origami method) and three-dimensional structures in the shapes of polyhedra. Nanomechanical devices and algorithmic self-assembly have also been demonstrated, and these DNA structures have been used to template the arrangement of other molecules such as gold nanoparticles and streptavidin proteins.|$|E

Using cameras and microphones, she will watch and hear what is happening. After the plans are made, Doggett leads the team into the dark tunnel.|$|E
5|$|Many adult dragonflies have {{brilliant}} iridescent or metallic colours {{produced by}} structural coloration, making them conspicuous in flight. Their overall coloration {{is often a}} combination of yellow, red, brown, and black pigments, with structural colours. Blues are typically created by microstructures in the cuticle that reflect blue light. Greens often combine <b>a</b> <b>structural</b> blue with a yellow pigment. Freshly emerged adults, known as tenerals, are often pale-coloured and obtain their typical colours after a few days, some have their bodies covered with a pale blue, waxy powderiness called pruinosity; it wears off when scraped during mating, leaving darker areas.|$|E

5|$|On 13 January 1964, a B-52D {{carrying}} two nuclear bombs suffered <b>a</b> <b>structural</b> failure in flight {{that caused the}} tail section to shear off.

5|$|Some {{compounds}} {{have been}} identified to bind cNTnC with low affinity and act as troponin activators: DFBP-O (<b>a</b> <b>structural</b> analog of levosimendan), 4-(4-(2,5-dimethylphenyl)-1-piperazinyl)-3-pyridinamine (NCI147866), and bepridil. The calmodulin antagonist, W7, has also been found to bind to cNTnC {{to act as a}} troponin inhibitor. All of these compounds bind to the hydrophobic patch in the open conformation of cNTnC, with troponin activators promoting interaction with the cTnI switch peptide and troponin inhibitors destabilizing the interaction.|$|E

Saffir gave the scale to the NHC, and Simpson added the effects of storm surge and flooding.|$|E
