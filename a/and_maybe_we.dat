500|$|In a {{conversation}} with John Barron of the New York Times in 2004, Lockhart was asked what Lassie was all about and why it remains something of a magical memory {{for those who were}} children in the 1950s and 1960s. She responded, [...] "This was a fairy tale about people on a farm in which the dog solves all the problems in 22 minutes, in time for the last commercial. Often, if the scene had gone well, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> hadn't gotten the dialogue quite right, if the dog was right, they'd print it." ...|$|E
500|$|Typically, {{there were}} two dog {{trainers}} on the set, each teetering on a stepladder only Lassie could see and waving a chunk of meat at the dog. [...] "It would look as though Lassie was looking at Jon (Provost), but he was really looking past Jon at the piece of beef", Lockhart recalled in 2004. When Provost delivered his line, the trainer behind Lockhart would whisper [...] "Lassie!" [...] and wave another piece of meat. Lassie's head would turn to Lockhart who would deliver her line. Then the trainer behind Provost would get Lassie's attention again, and Provost would deliver his next line. [...] "The sound editor would cut out all that," [...] Lockhart said, [...] "You finally got to where you never heard the trainers. Often, if the scene had gone well, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> hadn't gotten the dialogue quite right, if the dog was right, they'd print it." [...] In addition to the main Lassie, three other Lassies might be involved in an episode shoot: a stand-in for rehearsals, a stunt double, and a [...] "fighter" [...] for scenes involving battles with other animals.|$|E
500|$|The song {{begins with}} Knowles singing: [...] "I feel weak / We've {{been here before}} / 'Cause I feel we keep {{going back and forth}} / Maybe it's over, maybe we're through / But I {{honestly}} can say I still love you." [...] The introduction is skeletal as it contains only atmospheric synthesizers and insistent drum tapping, which have been further described as [...] "warbly [...] lighthearted". Throughout the song, the swaths of reverb occasionally pierce through the production. In the pre-chorus lines, Knowles sings: [...] "Maybe it's over, maybe we're through, but I honestly can say I still love you / Maybe we reached a mountain peak and there’s no more left to climb / <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> lost a magic piece and we're too blind to find" [...] while her vocals are followed by background sounds. The beat steadily grows from the verses to the bridge and, finally, to the chorus, with pounding drums coming into the loop during the refrain as Knowles sings: [...] "Let’s start over / Let's give love their wings / Let’s start over / Stop fighting bout the same old thing". As she belts the high notes and the drum beats continue to catch up, she urges her man to [...] "give love another life". During the bridge, Knowles sings: [...] "I know I called you selfish / But that’s a lie", over a simple piano line.|$|E
6000|$|... "We can get brook trout," [...] {{answered}} Whopper. [...] "But {{just the}} same I'm willing to stay here to-day <b>and</b> fish. <b>Maybe</b> <b>we</b> can get some big maskalonge, same as we did before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Wait! wait!” {{returned}} Dave, {{and caught}} {{him by the}} arm. “Don’t go yet. Let us lie low until Geswick comes, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> Jasniff. <b>We</b> {{may be able to}} capture all of them.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I {{know how}} they got the auto," [...] said the oldest Rover boy, after a pause. [...] "There must be a garage at the tavern. Come on <b>and</b> see. <b>Maybe</b> <b>we</b> can get another auto and follow that car!" ...|$|R
2500|$|On {{the final}} day, 3 wickets {{from each of}} Dominic Cork and Muttiah Muralitharan helped dismiss Worcestershire for 191 runs, with David Wigley unable to bat because of a broken hand {{sustained}} when James Anderson bowled a beamer {{at him in the}} first innings. After the match Cork talking about his match performance of 7 for 115 said, [...] "The ball is coming out well at the moment. I've worked hard with Mike Watkinson over the winter with it. It's early season and these sort of conditions suit a bowler like myself." [...] Watkinson, in response, spoke of Lancashire's determination to get straight back into the first Division after the disappointment of relegation last season, [...] ""We talked about {{the start of the season}} and the need to start well and to get a positive number in the wins column is a good feeling. We have two home games now coming up against Derbyshire and Durham <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> can kick on from here." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nick {{has been}} {{described}} by EastEnders executive producer Diederick Santer as [...] "the show's premier villain". An EastEnders Revealed documentary chronicling the character's time on the show deemed him a liar, a thief and a murderer who [...] "thrived on the pain and the misery of those near to him". Co-star Charlie Clements (Bradley Branning) has stated: [...] "You think of soap bad guys, Nick Cotton is definitely up there with the best of them", while Leslie Grantham (Den Watts) opined that [...] "There is no redeeming feature about Nick Cotton whatsoever". This assessment is shared by series story producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins, who has explained: [...] "It's good to have an out and out villain. I think sometimes you can get a character and go 'Oh, they should have a good side as well, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> should redeem them a little bit.' With Nick, it doesn’t matter. You can go full pelt, foot-on-the-accelerator bad guy." [...] John Altman has discussed the fact that he cannot remember his character ever once being nice, blaming Nick's unruliness on his father's absence during his childhood. Santer has discussed the [...] "wonderfully dysfunctional mother-son relationship" [...] Nick shares with his mother, Dot Cotton, and her perpetual willingness to give Nick another chance, regardless of his history of wrongdoing. Santer explained: [...] "There's that thing where you sort of dare to hope that someone's changed, which is really tragic. They’ve let you down a hundred times, and yet you still hope that the hundred and first time they’ll have changed." [...] Grantham has stated that Dot is the [...] "one friend in [...] life", while Treadwell-Collins has affirmed: [...] "Dot's always going to forgive him. And that's the beauty of Nick and Dot." [...] Concurring with this sentiment, Altman agreed: [...] "No matter what he does, she’ll forgive him. So did a lot of gangsters' mothers throughout history. Probably Al Capone's mother thought he was a sweet lad, you know." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "'Well,' says I, 'maybe you've {{really got}} kleptopigia. <b>And</b> <b>maybe</b> when <b>we</b> {{get out of}} the pig belt you'll turn your mind to higher and more remunerative misconduct. Why you should want to stain your soul with such a distasteful, feeble-minded, perverted, roaring beast as that I can't understand.' ...|$|R
5000|$|In January 2009, while touring {{in support}} of Cardinology (2008), Adams {{announced}} that he was planning to retire from music, due to ongoing problems with Ménière's disease. Posting on his website, Adams wrote: [...] "I am excited to finish this wonderful time I have had with the Cardinals. ... I am grateful for the time <b>we</b> have had, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> someday <b>we</b> will have more stories to tell together. I am, however, ready for quieter times, as I think it is very evident I am struggling with some balance <b>and</b> hearing issues. ... <b>Maybe</b> <b>we</b> will play again sometime, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> I will work my way back into some kind of music situation, but this is the time for me to step back now, to reel it in." [...] At this time, Adams had written a planned studio album, entitled Dear Impossible, which was subsequently abandoned.|$|R
5000|$|Rogers {{replaced}} Matt LaPorta on the Indians' active roster on June 13, 2012. [...] "We're {{hoping that}} getting {{him out of}} the Colorado ballpark <b>and</b> new surroundings, <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> can cash in on a very good arm", said Indians manager Manny Acta.|$|R
6000|$|... "We've waxed a few {{schools around}} here, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> {{can take a}} round out of Longley Academy," [...] Fred {{could not help but}} add.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Let's look, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> {{can find}} a purse. People are always going about with money at Christmas time, and some one may lose it here,' said Kate.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would save}} {{us a long}} tramp," [...] Surajah agreed. [...] "We will think it over, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> will {{have a talk with}} your officer, {{tomorrow}} morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... (He {{stands up}} and moves toward her, holding whiskey glass in one hand.) That speech {{is going to make}} a devil of a row. But I don't think it will be so bad as your father says. It looks pretty dark, but such things blow over. They always do blow over. And so with you <b>and</b> me. <b>Maybe</b> <b>we</b> can manage to forget all this and patch it up somehow.|$|R
30|$|Conclusion: Concsultation for the {{severely}} ill {{cases in}} the wards take very much time of the intensivits. It was seen that consultation request was mostly emergent and due to respiratory problems <b>and</b> sepsis. <b>Maybe</b> <b>we</b> need another system like rapid response team for decrease the insivists work and decrease the mortality amd morbidity. The limitation of the beds in ICU {{is one of the}} most important problem, and there must be more empty beds for inhospital emergencies.|$|R
5000|$|Crutchfield {{praised the}} {{collaborative}} recording sessions, noting: [...] "I feel like I have really talented friends {{and wanted to}} bounce ideas off them. Like, two heads are better than one, four are better than two, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> if <b>we</b> all got together on this they could present ideas to me that I had never thought of. That {{was the sort of}} process on this record that, honestly, is completely different than American Weekend in every possible way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just the cheese, Dick! I {{remember}} {{there was a}} lock on the door,-- <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> can fasten it in some other way, too-- so they can't break out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Under the squire's thumb, all of 'em!" [...] said Bart Haycock, {{the village}} blacksmith. [...] "We {{ought to have}} a new committee, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> will have at the coming election." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Maybe I would," [...] mused Tom. [...] "Well, let us try {{the engine}} anyhow. <b>And</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> can try the propellers," [...] he added, with a longing {{glance at the}} smooth, wooden blades.|$|E
40|$|The new single-stageaccelerator mass {{spectrometer}} at SUERC can also accept positiveions. Potential benefits of positiveion measurement with suitable ionsources are more convenient sample form, smaller sample size, {{a variety of}} available charge states <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> new applications. <b>We</b> have begun with oxygen isotope analyses to demonstrate destruction of interfering molecules...|$|R
2500|$|In Karrewiet, a Flemish {{news program}} for children, Leterme was interviewed. He said [...] "We could {{make sure that}} they [...] could build schools more cheaply. That would be {{beneficial}} for students from Wallonia <b>and</b> Brussels. <b>Maybe</b> if <b>we</b> could agree about that, French-speakers would be willing to negotiate about our demands." ...|$|R
40|$|Social {{norms are}} {{often cited as}} the cause of many social phenomena, {{especially}} as an explanation for prosocial family and relationship behaviors. <b>And</b> yet <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> love the idea of social norms too much, as suggested by our failure to subject them to rigorous test. Compared to the detail in social norms theoretical orientations, there is very little detail in tests of normative theories. To provide guidance to researchers who invoke social norms as explanations, we catalog normative orientations that have been proposed to account for consistent patterns of action. We call on researchers to conduct tests of normative theories and the processes such theories assert...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, let us stick {{together}} <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> can face them down," [...] was Ham Spink's comment, {{and then he}} {{lit a cigarette and}} offered one to his crony, and both fell to smoking.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now he's gone," [...] {{continued}} Tom, quietly, but laying {{an emphasis}} that sufficiently explained his meaning, [...] "perhaps you'll {{let me know}} the true price of this watch. I've a mind for it, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> can agree." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Ah! it’s {{but money}} thrown away, lad,” said Leather-Stocking. “A turkey’s {{head and neck}} is but a small mark for a new hand and a lame shoulder. You’d best let me take the fire, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> can make some {{settlement}} with the lady about the bird.” The chance is mine,” said the young hunter. “Clear the ground, that I may take it.” ...|$|E
500|$|Reshoots were {{conducted}} around November 2007. Lawrence noted, [...] "We weren't seeing fully rendered shots until {{about a month}} ago. The movie starts {{to take on a}} whole other life. It's not until later that you can judge a movie as a whole <b>and</b> go, 'Huh, <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> should shoot this little piece in the middle, or tweak this a little bit.' It just so happened that our re-shoots revolved around the end of the movie." ...|$|R
40|$|Singer's lucid ethical enquiry {{demands that}} we focus {{intelligently}} and independently on selfish states <b>and</b> rogue-like super-states. <b>Maybe</b> <b>we</b> Australians, with our wealth of multicultural experience, {{have something to}} say to a globalising world about such matters. But we need {{to pay more attention to}} books like this one, rather than to ranting ideological curmudgeons of the Revivalist Right, if our country is going to be heard - and respected - in the great debates about globalisation...|$|R

6000|$|... "What we {{have got}} to do in this world, Robina," [...] I said, [...] "is to take people as they are, and make the best of them. We cannot expect {{everybody}} to be just as we would have them, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> should not like them any better if they were. Don't bother yourself about how much nicer they might be; think how nice they are." ...|$|E

"I think Collier {{must have}} spoken to Mame and got the same answer, for one day he orders {{a cup of coffee}} and a cracker, and sits {{nibbling}} the corner of it like a girl in the parlour, that's filled up in the kitchen, previous, on cold roast and fried cabbage. I caught on and did the same, <b>and</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> thought we'd made a hit! The next day we tried it again, and out comes old man Dugan fetching in his hands the fairy viands.|$|E
30|$|The above {{content is}} just {{a review of the}} {{technique}} history. The research of cone-shaped tubes of combined pumps can be retrieved to the papers of studying fire sprinklers connected in series at the beginning of last century. Viewed from this angle, cone-shaped tubes of combined pumps were not an innovative structure. If further consideration is given to more ancient <b>and</b> wider dimensions, <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> can learn from organism itself to develop the applications of the cone-shaped tubes in the combined forms.|$|R
5000|$|Discussing the lyrics, singer Julian Hamilton told Rolling Stone Australia: [...] "It's a {{break up}} song but I didn't {{want it to}} be a guy pissed off at a girl because that always sounds so wimpy. I thought it'd be cool to write it from a girl's perspective. The lyrics came out a bit weird <b>and</b> <b>we</b> thought <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> could flog this off to a girl singer, but then I thought no, this song needs to be sung with balls!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Work on {{the album}} began after the band reunited for a one-off gig in front of 50,000 people at a V8 Supercars event in Sydney in 2009. Singer Jimmy Barnes explained: [...] "Even before the show, in the {{rehearsal}} period we all had a really great time <b>and</b> <b>we</b> thought <b>maybe</b> <b>we</b> should carry it on a bit. So we went into my studio at my house and did some writing and recording, without having any plans of doing anything with it." ...|$|R
