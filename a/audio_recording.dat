40|$|The diploma thesis aims on {{the matter}} of data hiding (steganography) in <b>audio</b> <b>records.</b> It {{describes}} general steganographic principles and aims further on the specifics of data hiding in <b>audio</b> <b>records</b> and also aims on the LSB steganographic technique and suitability of different types of <b>audio</b> <b>records</b> to be used with this technique. The thesis also describes a laboratory exercise focused on steganography in <b>audio</b> <b>records</b> and influence of related aspects on the final <b>audio</b> <b>record</b> which contains secret data. Further, the thesis describes a program that was created especially for the laboratory exercise, from the design, functional as well as implementation-related view. Within the exercise, students will be able to examine how the amount of data to be hidden in the <b>audio</b> <b>record</b> and different ways of data hiding will affect quality of the resulting <b>audio</b> <b>record,</b> and therefore they can become more familiar with the matter of steganography based on the LSB method used in <b>audio</b> <b>records...</b>|$|R

5|$|Pink Floyd used {{innovative}} {{sound effects}} and {{state of the}} art <b>audio</b> <b>recording</b> technology during the recording of The Final Cut.

The system used a conventional stereo tape to produce an effect that seemed to move the sound around the listener's head when they were wearing headphones. The process enabled an engineer to simulate moving the sound to behind, above or beside the listener's ears.|$|E

5|$|New to the Forza {{series is}} a feature known as Autovista. It is {{designed}} to allow players to walk around and explore inside cars. This feature allows players to view minute details such as brake pads, engine components, and interior details. The player can point at certain features, such as headlights, wheels and the engine for further information about them via <b>audio</b> <b>recording.</b> It can be controlled via Kinect or a game controller. Only 24 cars in the game support the Autovista feature, as it is primarily for sports cars, classic cars, and dream cars. The graphics used to create these cars are formed using image-based lighting which allowed the developers to create perfect reflections, and would better immerse {{the car in the}} environment both when racing on a track or in the garage or Top Gear studio when viewing a car.|$|E

Archie and Janine learn of this and try to get Ian to sell the loan to them. When Ian's wife Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) leaves him, Janine gets him drunk and has sex with him, making an <b>audio</b> <b>recording</b> of them together.

Once Archie finds out that Janine plans to fleece him, he proposes to her to keep her from going astray. Ryan is hurt by this setback and ends his relationship with her. Ronnie stands up to Archie and he pushes her into the bar, not knowing she is pregnant, though Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) then reveals it.
