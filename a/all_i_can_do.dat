In response, Urlacher has stated [...] "Just watch the film. I don’t know what people are saying, but I’m not too worried about it anymore. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is go out there and play hard and try and help my team win, and that's what I’m going to keep doing." ...|$|E
500|$|Near the novel's conclusion, Judd {{refuses to}} honor his {{agreement}} with Marty {{because there was no}} witness. When Marty asks his mother what a witness is, she responds: [...] "Somebody who knows the Lord Jesus and don't mind tellin' about it." [...] Despite Judd's refusal to honor the agreement, Marty persistently maintains his part of it. He decides: [...] "I got no choice. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is stick to my side of the deal and see what happens. All in the world I can do." [...] After ultimately ceding Shiloh to Marty, Judd asks: [...] "What {{you going to do with}} that dog once he's yours?" [...] Marty's simple reply is: [...] "Love him." [...] Scholar Claudia Mills noted that: [...] "The resolution of the stand-off comes when Marty, in essence, stands witness, in his mother's religious sense of witness, for an ethic of love, crystallized in his love for Shiloh." ...|$|E
2500|$|Botham {{summed up}} the unending nature of the debate when he wrote: [...] "I have no answers. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is wonder how much more English cricket might have got out of Graeme Hick had he been handled differently. I know he does as well." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "I find it {{fascinating}} {{that our}} planet still has areas where no modern technology can save you, {{where you are}} reduced to your most basic - and essential - self. This natural space creates demanding situations {{that can lead to}} suffering and death, but also generate a wild interior richness. Ultimately, {{there is no way of}} reconciling these contradictions. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> it try to live within their margins, in the narrow boundary between joy and horror. Everything on this earth is a balancing act." ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{form for}} Derby in the 2010–11 season led to {{speculation}} of a Scotland recall, with Commons stating [...] "They're {{well aware that}} I can play for Scotland. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> is concentrate on playing well and scoring goals for Derby and hope that I grab their attention." [...] The following month he was recalled to the squad. His first international goal came in a 3–0 victory over the Faroe Islands on 16 November 2010.

2500|$|Ponting {{was confronted}} by a large media pack shortly after his arrival at Sydney Airport and said he wasn't aware of Lillee's comments. [...] "I'm not {{concerned}} about those things.

6000|$|His tone touched Randal to the quick. [...] "I {{feel for}} you, Herbert," [...] he said, warmly. [...] "She shall have your message; <b>all</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> {{to persuade her}} shall be done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I understand," [...] she said, nodding {{her head}} slowly {{once or twice}} {{as if she were}} {{brooding}} over what she thought. [...] "But surely that is not <b>all</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> for thee." ...|$|R
2500|$|During this period, Parton {{began to}} embark on a {{high-profile}} crossover campaign, attempting to aim her music in a more mainstream direction and increase her visibility outside of the confines of country music. In 1976, she began working closely with Sandy Gallin, who served as her personal manager for the next 25 years. With her 1976 album <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Do,</b> which she co-produced with Porter Wagoner, Parton began taking more of an active role in production, and began specifically aiming her music in a more mainstream, pop direction. Her first entirely self-produced effort, New Harvest ... First Gathering, (1977) highlighted her pop sensibilities, both in terms of choice of songs –- the album contained covers of the pop and R classics [...] "My Girl" [...] and [...] "Higher and Higher" [...] – and production. Though the album was well received and topped the U.S. country albums chart, neither it nor its single [...] "Light of a Clear Blue Morning" [...] made much of an impression on the pop charts.|$|E

6000|$|The Babe stood {{first on}} one leg {{and then on the}} other, but nothing seemed to come of it. [...] "Well," [...] said the Babe, [...] "I just looked in, that's <b>all.</b> Nothing <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> for you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then," [...] he said, rising with difficulty, [...] "I {{have said}} <b>all</b> <b>I</b> have to say, and <b>done</b> <b>all</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> shall still {{hope that you}} may change your mind. I shall not yet abandon hope. Good-bye." ...|$|R
