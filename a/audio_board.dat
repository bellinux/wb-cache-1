In May 1999 the station sign-on time changed from 7:15 AM to 7:00 AM and the station remained on the air each weekday during the school year until 4 PM. In May 2000 automation equipment arrived and the process of recording music onto the automation computer's hard drive began. In September of the same year, JEFF 92 began an expanded broadcast schedule, staying on the air each school weekday until 11 PM.|$|E
5|$|The {{sound on}} a tonewheel Hammond organ is varied through the {{manipulation}} of drawbars. A drawbar is a metal slider that controls the volume of a particular sound component, {{in a similar way}} to a fader on an <b>audio</b> mixing <b>board.</b> As a drawbar is incrementally pulled out, it increases the volume of its sound. When pushed all the way in, the volume is decreased to zero.|$|R

[...] The storage compartment holds 4 cameras and a tripod for each, sandbags, camera cables, headphones for the camera operators, wheel bases to mobilize the cameras, viewfinder case, and mats to assist in holding the camera cables in place. The control room contains a switcher that can take a total of 12 camera outputs, two DV CAM decks, a DPS replay deck, a DVD deck, an <b>audio</b> <b>board,</b> a Waveform and Vectorscope monitor for white balancing, 7 monitors for the director (4 cameras plus a CG, Program and VTR monitor), and a graphics console computer.|$|E
50|$|The {{technical}} {{operations of}} Buckeye TV are continually improving, both on a personnel and equipment standpoint. At present time the station uses {{a variety of}} DV cameras for acquisition, including Panasonic AG-DVC15s, AG-DVC80s, and AG-DVC30s. Packages and shows are completed in post-production on two Avid Xpress Pro workstations. During summer quarter 2006, the station built and equipped a new studio control room and expanded its production space, creating two distinct studios. The control room features an Ampex AVC-33 production switcher, a 30 input video switcher featuring 3 M/E busses, and luma/chroma keying capabilities. Additional control room equipment includes a Mackie CFX20 <b>audio</b> <b>board,</b> Telex intercom system, and various video monitors. The new production studios feature Sony MXC-3000 cameras and a teleprompter system {{on two of the}} three cameras.|$|E
50|$|The {{production}} crew of The Lone Shark then {{consisted of a}} staff of four, with each crew member performing more than one duty. Sharky produced, hosted and wrote material; Haffner was floor director and operated the in-studio cameras; Oppenheimer directed the program from the control room and managed the in-studio lighting; Segal operated the <b>audio</b> <b>board</b> and VTRs. Because of the communal environment at the Xavier Hall production facilities, producers and staff from other programs would often sit in on the tapings of each other's programs, at times becoming regular crew members of other productions. Also, because the production facilities were located in the Fairfield University Media Center, the Fairfield University Video Production Course was located directly across the hallway from the studio. The Video Production students were often brought into the studio to view the set-up and recording of The Lone Shark {{as a part of}} their education. Because of these two groups joining The Lone Shark's production staff, for a while in 1992 and 1993, the staff grew to over 20 people on a program that needed no more than four or five staff members. Many of the extra crew and students had nothing to do during the program's taping, so they were often used as a live in-studio audience.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} {{radio station}} KMOD, Modesto, California, {{went on the}} air in 1950 at 1360 kilocycles AM as an affiliate of the American Broadcasting Company Radio Network at 1,000 watts. Although for a brief period of time it had studios in the Hotel Covel in downtown Modesto, the main studios and transmitter site were on east Orangeburg Avenue five miles outside of Modesto in the midst of walnut and fruit orchards and pasture land on which was erected three towers for the directional signal. The station was housed in a cinderblock building and had a General Manager's office, his secretary's office which was also the repository of all papers, including original commercials, a general office room with a half-dozen desks used by air salesmen and other staff. There was one main studio, an announcer's booth which was also an auxiliary control room, and the control room used by the combination men, i.e., the announcer-engineers, from where most program originated. It had up-to-date Ampex reel-to-reel tape machines and a combination of RCA and General Electric equipment ranging from microphones to the <b>audio</b> <b>board.</b> There was also a large room used to hold several transcription libraries and thousands of LP and 45 rpm records and, later, a workshop was added where the news Teletype machines were put.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the station}} was acquired, the calls were changed to WJAI (for [...] "Jai-Alai" [...] a popular game in Florida.) Great Trails {{purchase}} of the station {{did not include the}} existing studio. Stan Coning obliged by constructing a temporary studio in the basement of his home in Eaton; the quirky studio consisted of a rack along the left wall with aged broadcasting gear, an ancient Gates [...] "Yard" [...] <b>audio</b> <b>board</b> in front, a washer/dryer and toilet along the back wall. Access to the basement studio was through a windowed sliding door. WJAI-FM remained at this location for nearly three years. Coning was employed as the on-site engineer, Program Director John Robertson rarely visited the studios, maintaining his Dayton, Ohio address. Robertson was a former WING-Dayton on-air personality, promoted to managing the station and its low-maintenance format. Robertson hired Doug Ritter (Doug Ritterling), as one of WJAI's first announcers. Ritter was only 16 years of age. Ritter later became a news anchor at WING-Dayton. Great Trails' purchase of WJAI was motivated by a possibility of a transmitter power increase, and access to the much larger Dayton market. The power increase was finally approved by the FCC after a prolonged legal battle with owners of two Dayton stations; the owners protested establishment of a new competing station in the Dayton market.|$|E
50|$|In March 1966, Munson was in West Palm Beach, Florida, for the Braves' spring {{training}} and {{read in the}} Atlanta Journal that Georgia Bulldogs football radio announcer Ed Thilenius was resigning to become a broadcaster for the new Atlanta Falcons National Football League franchise. The next day, Munson called Georgia athletics director Joel Eaves to express {{his interest in the}} Georgia job, and Munson was hired shortly thereafter. Athens radio station WRFC held the broadcast contract and was the parent station for the Georgia Bulldogs. After announcing Braves games for the first two months of the baseball season, Munson returned to Nashville in June 1966 to continue The Rod & Gun Club for Nashville's WSM-TV, and prepare for his new role with the Bulldogs. For many years after joining the University of Georgia broadcasts, Munson would make the commute to Athens, Georgia for the weekend football games from his home in Nashville so that he could continue producing The Rod & Gun Club during the week. His engineer for many years was L.H. Christian, the owner of WRFC radio, who ran the <b>audio</b> <b>board</b> out of personal interest and for fun; Christian was sometimes joined by Larry Melear or Everett Langford as engineer for the sports broadcasts. Munson continued to live in Nashville until 1978 when he moved to metro Atlanta, Georgia, after joining the Georgia Radio Network as a reporter. Munson moved to Athens in 1997. On September 22, 2008, Larry announced his retirement from being the play-by-play announcer for the University of Georgia Bulldogs.|$|E
