5|$|Double Fine {{demonstrated}} an in-progress {{version of the}} remastered game at the 2014 IndieCade event in October 2014; new features included higher-resolution textures and improved resolution for the character models as well as having real-time lighting models, {{and the ability to}} switch back and forth between this presentation and the original graphics <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> a control. The remastered game runs in 4:3 aspect ratio but has an option to stretch this to a 16:9 ratio rather than render in a native 16:9 ratio. The remaster includes improvements to the control scheme developed by Pfaff's patch and other alternate control schemes in addition to the original tank-like controls, including analogue controls for console versions and point-and-click controls for computer versions. The game's soundtrack was fully orchestrated through performances of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra (who also performed the soundtrack for Double Fine's Broken Age). The remastered version also includes developer commentary, which can be activated via the options menu and listened to at various points in the game. The PlayStation version also features cloud saving between the PS4 and Vita versions.|$|E
25|$|With the V70 Bi-Fuel Volvo {{continued}} {{to offer a}} factory CNG powered car. A 95-litre tank installed in the trunk allowed for a claimed range of 250km running on CNG only. Due to the bulky tank rear cargo space was considerably reduced. Drivers could choose whether their car should run on petrol or CNG <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> a button. On Bi-Fuel models the temperature gauge in the instrument cluster {{was replaced by a}} level gauge for the gas tank. Several options, such as a trip computer and sports suspension, were not available for Bi-Fuel models.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s Tyco Toys created {{a line of}} action figures called The Incredible Crash Dummies based on the {{characters}} from the NHTSA television advertisements. They were intended to fall apart <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> a button on their abdomens. Vehicles which could be crashed into walls and broken were also produced. Dummies and vehicles were easily reassembled. They prompted a one-hour television special, The Adventures of the Incredible Crash Dummies. Unique for its time, the cartoon was produced entirely using 3D computer animation techniques. A comic book series and a video game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy were produced.|$|E

25|$|The {{advent of}} {{incandescent}} gas lighting in factories, homes {{and in the}} streets, replacing oil lamps and candles with steady clear light, almost matching daylight in its colour, turned night into day for many—making night shift work possible in industries where light was all important—in spinning, weaving and making up garments etc. The social significance of this change is difficult for generations brought up with lighting after dark available <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> a switch to appreciate. Not only was industrial production accelerated, but streets were made safe, social intercourse facilitated and reading and writing made more widespread. Gas works were built in almost every town, main streets were brightly illuminated and gas was piped in the streets {{to the majority of}} urban households. The invention of the gas meter and the pre-payment meter in the late 1880s {{played an important role in}} selling town gas to domestic and commercial customers.|$|E
500|$|The GTS has usually used a more {{powerful}} engine and robust drivetrain than other HSV models, however the E-Series 1 GTS shared the 6.0L LS2 V8 engine with 412bhp (307kW) of power and 405lb·ft (550 N·m) of torque, with the cheaper Clubsport and the luxury Senator. The major difference between the E-Series GTS and other HSV models in the range is the Magnetic Ride Control (MRC, or [...] "MagneRide"). MRC utilises magnetorheological dampers to improve the car's handling and dynamics. In the GTS, the MRC can be switched between Performance and Track response modes <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> a button. MRC is not available on the Clubsport; it is standard equipment of the Senator, but switches between [...] "Luxury" [...] and [...] "Performance", there is no [...] "Track" [...] mode like the GTS has.|$|E
500|$|Now {{established}} as a successful film director, Donen continued his solo career at MGM with Fearless Fagan in 1952. Based on a true story, the film stars Carleton Carpenter as a GI who brings his tame lion {{with him when he}} joins the army. In 1953 Donen made the musical Give a Girl a Break. The film stars Debbie Reynolds, Marge Champion and Helen Wood as three aspiring dancers competing for the lead in a new Broadway musical. Bob Fosse, Gower Champion and Kurt Kasznar also appear, with music by Lane and Ira Gershwin. The most famous scene is the [...] "Give a Girl a Break" [...] dance between Reynolds and Fosse, which was choreographed backwards and then played in reverse to create the illusion that the two are surrounded by hundreds of balloons that instantly appear <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> their fingers. Shooting the film became a bitter experience for Donen due to a major on-set fight over the film's choreography between Fosse and Gower Champion. The fight split the cast and crew with Reynolds and Marge taking Gower's side and Donen taking Fosse's side. The film was not well reviewed upon release, but its reputation has grown over the years.|$|E
60|$|She smiled again, {{this time}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> boyish <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> heroics. Experience, responsibility, {{and he would}} get over that. She remembered once, long ago, when his mother had shut him up in his room for a punishment, and he had {{tortured}} her by remaining there for two whole days.|$|R

60|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> first <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> my finger, Manytongues awoke, {{and stood}} erect. He {{recognized}} {{me in an}} instant, dark as was <b>the</b> room, and <b>touching</b> my arm as a signal to follow, led {{the way into the}} open air. After moving out of ear-shot, he stopped and proceeded to business himself, like one accustomed to such interruptions.|$|R
2500|$|On 12 March 2009, the [...] "Boost Specials" [...] pack was released. It {{featured}} two cars: the Carson Extreme Hotrod and the Montgomery Hawker Mech. The Carson {{was described}} as the fastest car {{in the game and}} featured a 'locked' boost; the car continues to boost until it is brought to a stop in any manner. The vehicle dynamics system were rewired so that the Carson performs more realistically than any other car in the game. The Montgomery Hawker Mech also featured a unique boost system, which allows the player to willingly switch between the three different boost types <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> a button.|$|E
2500|$|The {{later years}} of this {{generation}} of Toronado saw new features mostly confined to minor styling tweaks to the grille and trim, although in 1977, the XS and XSR models debuted. Both featured a three-sided, hot wire [...] "bent-glass" [...] rear window and, on the XSR, electric t-tops which slid inwards <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> a button. However, as built in prototype form, the XSR had no means of channeling water away from the retractable sections, and water would inevitably leak into the cabin. No workable {{solution to the problem}} was found, and as such, the XSR model was scrapped. The XS, which did enter production, was offered with GM's more reliable (and no doubt more leak-resistant) Astroroof sliding sunroof instead. Air conditioning was standard.|$|E
2500|$|To set {{the scene}} for the album's release Virgin {{released}} one of the album tracks immediately {{in advance of the}} album. [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] went to number six in the UK singles chart, confirming the band's popularity. Virgin began heavily advertising the release of the new album, set for the end of October 1981. [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] was accompanied by a futuristic looking promotional video, a rarity at the time. Whilst it was still in the charts, Dare premiered to critical acclaim. It was also condemned by the Musicians' Union, who believed the new technology employed by the Human League was making traditional musicians redundant and a threat to their monopoly. Soon they would begin a [...] "Keep It Live" [...] campaign believing that bands like the Human League would be able to perform concerts <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> a button.|$|E

6000|$|... "If he is dead!" [...] exclaimed {{the other}} sharply. [...] "That {{is the very}} point,--is he dead? Can you {{confidently}} {{say that he is}} not in a sound sleep, or in a dead faint, or shamming and ready <b>at</b> <b>the</b> first <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> knife to leap up and seize his assailant--I mean his carver--by the throat and perhaps murder him as he once murdered a spoonbill?" ...|$|R
2500|$|For the 1983 models {{not much}} was altered, {{but there was}} an {{increase}} in power output to [...] and [...] of torque from the same 5M-GE. The only real change in the engine area was the switch from a vacuum advanced to an electronic advanced distributor, yet that did not increase the power. Toyota switched to a 4.10:1 rear gear ratio for the P-type and a 3.73:1 for the L-type. As for the optional automatic transmission, they replaced the A43DL 4-speed with a newly designed A43DE 4-speed. It featured an electronic controller that would adjust its shift pattern for a balance between performance and economy. It was the first in the industry to provide an electronically controlled transmission (ECT). This allowed the driver to choose either the [...] "power" [...] driving mode or [...] "normal" [...] driving mode <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> the button. The power mode provided the quickest acceleration and the normal mode provided the best all-around performance.|$|E
2500|$|... "Dancing on My Own" [...] {{received}} widespread acclaim {{from music}} critics and publications. Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave the song {{five out of}} five stars and wrote that [...] "'Dancing on My Own' is a misty-eyed electro-disco tune that's every bit as emotive as 'With Every Heartbeat' and 'Be Mine' [...] If your bottom lip's not quivering like the bassline {{by the time the}} second chorus hits, you've taken waaay too many mood stabilisers." [...] Luke Lewis of NME referred to the song as [...] "a comet-trail of sadness and exhilaration that's easily the equal of Robyn's breakthrough hit, 'With Every Heartbeat'." [...] The Guardians Michael Hann stated that song's [...] "pulsing synths and electronic percussion manage to sound both jackbooted and ineffably melancholy." [...] Jer Fairall wrote for PopMatters that [...] "he aggressive stun-gun rhythm of 'Dancing on My Own' can't hide a classic drama-played-out-on-the-dancefloor scenario inherited from standard bearers like ABBA's 'Dancing Queen' and Madonna's 'Into the Groove', nor is it cold enough not to melt <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> Robyn's warm, yearning vocals or the song's shimmering keyboard chime." [...] Matthew Horton of BBC Music described [...] "Dancing on My Own" [...] – along with [...] "Fembot" [...] and [...] "Cry When You Get Older" [...] – as [...] "scorchingly catchy, and laced with Robyn's familiar cordial of sparkling hook mixed with unutterable poignancy." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "They {{will give}} you colour, too, before seven years are over--and {{that is more than}} I can do, or any one else. No; I yield to the new dynasty. The artist's {{occupation}} is gone henceforth, and the painter's studio, like 'all charms, must fly, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> mere <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> cold philosophy.' So Major Campbell prepares the charming little cockyoly birds, and I call in the sun to immortalise them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ... Do not all charms fly [...] <b>At</b> <b>the</b> mere <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> cold philosophy? [...] There was {{an awful}} rainbow once in heaven: [...] We know her woof, her texture; she is given [...] In the dull {{catalogue}} of common things. [...] Philosophy will clip an Angel's wings, [...] Conquer all mysteries by rule and line, [...] Empty the haunted air, and gnomed mine-- [...] Unweave a rainbow, as it erewhile made [...] The tender-person'd Lamia melt into a shade.|$|R
60|$|Then {{she tried}} to talk to Leslie about the strike. He heard her with mild superiority, smiled, and said she did not know. Women jumped to {{conclusions}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> first <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> feeling; men must look at a thing all round, then make a decision—nothing hasty and impetuous—careful, long-thought-out, correct decisions. Women could not be expected to understand these things, business was not for them; in fact, their mission was above business—etc., etc., Unfortunately Lettie was the wrong woman to treat thus.|$|R

60|$|Dick did so, and Murad at once {{started at}} a gentle canter. Easy as it was, Dick thought {{several times that}} he would be off. However, he gripped as tightly as he could with his knees, and as he became {{accustomed}} to the motion, and learned to give to it, acquired ease and confidence. He was not, however, sorry when, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of another half hour, Anwar held up his hand as he approached him, and <b>the</b> horse stopped <b>at</b> <b>the</b> slightest <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rein.|$|R
6000|$|Besides, how oft did God give {{power to}} his prophets, servants, and Christ Jesus, to raise some that were now dead, and some {{that had been}} long so; and all, no doubt, to put the present generations, as also the generations yet unborn, in mind of {{the resurrection of the}} dead. To this end, I say, how was the Shunammite's son raised from the dead? (2 Kings 4). <b>The</b> man also <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>touching</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bones of Elisha? (2 Kings 13:20,21). Together with the body of Lazarus, with Jairus's daughter, and Tabitha, and many others, who, after their souls were {{departed}} from them, Lazarus lying in his grave four days, were all raised to life again, and lived with that very body out of which <b>the</b> soul, <b>at</b> their death, had departed (Luke 8:53-56; John 11:43,44; Acts 9:40,41). But above all, that notable place in Matthew, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> resurrection of the Lord Jesus, gives us a notable fore-word of the resurrection of the just. Saith the text, [...] "And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose, and came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many" [...] (Matt 27:52,53).|$|R
60|$|He {{led her to}} {{the kitchen}} garden where no one was likely to come, and this time Miss Wilkinson did not think of earwigs. He kissed her passionately. It {{was one of the things}} that puzzled him that he did not like her <b>at</b> all in <b>the</b> morning, and only {{moderately}} in <b>the</b> afternoon, but <b>at</b> night <b>the</b> <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> her hand thrilled him. He said things that he would never have thought himself capable of saying; he could certainly never have said them in the broad light of day; and he listened to himself with wonder and satisfaction.|$|R

Drain the well of faith dug with so many prayers and labours, that its waters may suffice to nourish a rose planted in the sand, whose blooms must die <b>at</b> <b>the</b> first <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> creeping earthly frost? ...|$|R
60|$|Sometimes, when attacked, Unk Wunk {{covers his}} face with this weapon. More often he sticks his head under a root or into a hollow log, leaving his tail out ready for action. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> first <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> his enemy <b>the</b> tail snaps right and left quicker than thought, driving the hostile head and sides full of the deadly quills, from {{which there is no}} escape; for every effort, every rub and writhe of pain, only drives them deeper and deeper, till they rest in heart or brain and finish their work.|$|R
60|$|Each {{afternoon}} I saddled my Klondike horse {{who was in}} need of exercise, and galloped {{about over}} the hills for an hour or two. We were familiar figures by this time, and the farmers when they saw me leaping a pasture fence or climbing a hill, would smile (I assume that they smiled), and say, there goes that literary cuss, or words to that general effect. I took a boyish delight in showing that Ladrone would walk a log or leap a ditch <b>at</b> <b>the</b> mere <b>touch</b> <b>of</b> my heel.|$|R
