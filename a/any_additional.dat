5|$|An {{active sonar}} system was {{scheduled}} to be installed in June 1940, but it is uncertain when it was actually done. During the war, the ship's light anti-aircraft armament was augmented several times. Improved 2cm C/38 guns replaced the original C/30 guns and three additional guns were added sometime in 1941. The two guns on the aft shelter deck were replaced by a single 2cm quadruple Flakvierling mount, probably during her late 1941 refit. Richard Beitzen appears not have <b>any</b> <b>additional</b> AA guns added after this time.|$|E
5|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} on 8May several satellite experts questioned the analysis of satellite pings made by Inmarsat staff because the Doppler frequency shifts measured were apparently not properly corrected against the satellite's own drift (a periodic North-South oscillation of 3° every 24hours). Without <b>any</b> <b>additional</b> data being released, the implication of this new analysis was that the northern portion of the Inmarsat satellite pings arc could not be ruled out. The Malaysian government released the satellite data three weeks later.|$|E

It acquired application-acceleration vendor Redline Networks, VOIP company Kagoor Networks, {{as well as}} wide area network (WAN) company Peribit Networks. Peribit and Redline were incorporated into a new application products group and their technology was integrated into Juniper's infranet framework.

5|$|Shoe polish may be {{purchased}} pre-soaked into a hard sponge, {{which can be}} used to buff leather without needing to apply <b>any</b> <b>additional</b> polish to either the leather or the sponge. This is usually known as an applicator. A number of companies that manufacture shoe care products also sell a liquid shoe polish in a squeezable plastic bottle, with a small sponge applicator at the end. To decrease its viscosity, bottled polish usually has a very low wax content.|$|E
5|$|The {{conjunction}} of several planets which Brad Dourif's character Dennis Hoffman speaks about was reliably predicted {{at the time}} of the episode's broadcast.

Several similar alignments have occurred in the past without resulting in <b>any</b> <b>additional</b> natural activity on Earth. The predicted conjunction did occur in May 2000, with no consequence on Earth.|$|E

Eight finals have gone to extra time, with two being decided in this period of play. The further six have been decided by penalty shoot-out.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{scheduling}} issues, Rucka and Lark {{were behind}} on the series from the start.

They said they would not solicit <b>any</b> <b>additional</b> issues until the next story arc was completed, and the hiatus actually lasted six months, in part because of miscommunication between Image Comics and Diamond Distribution. During the hiatus, they released a sourcebook providing additional, non-essential background on the Carlyle family. Despite the break, five months passed between the fourth and fifth chapters of the Cull arc. A second sourcebook detailing the Hock Family was released in April 2017.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} {{announcement}} proclaiming the ACC's expansion to 12teams, several cities and sports organizations were preparing bids {{to host the}} ACC Football Championship Game. The prospect {{of tens of thousands}} of visitors could provide a multimillion-dollar economic boost for a host city and region while requiring few, if <b>any,</b> <b>additional</b> facilities. One early contender was the city of Charlotte, North Carolina. Even before Virginia Tech, Miami, and Boston College were chosen as the ACC's picks to expand, Carolinas Stadium Corporation, the owner and operator of Charlotte's Ericsson Stadium (as it was called then) lobbied heavily for Charlotte's selection. Other early options included Orlando, Tampa, Atlanta, and Jacksonville.|$|E
5|$|Herdwicks are a dual-purpose breed, {{producing}} strongly flavoured {{lamb and}} mutton and a coarse, grey wool. This slowly maturing breed {{is one of}} the most hardy of all the British hill sheep breeds, withstanding the cold and relentless rain of the Lake District at heights upwards of 3,000 feet (about 1,000 metres). Most Herdwicks spend winter on the fells, from approximately December to April. They are normally left to graze freely on the hillsides (without <b>any</b> <b>additional</b> feed), but each ewe tends to stay in her heaf (the local term for heft), the same small area of fell. Due to the rough conditions on fells, lambing losses can be as high as 25%. This ability to thrive unassisted is part of the reason fell farmers so highly value Herdwicks over much higher-producing lowland breeds.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Lili was a {{moderate}} tropical cyclone of the 1990 Atlantic hurricane season. It {{began as a}} subtropical cyclone over the central Atlantic and became a hurricane while moving westward toward the United States. Lili did not gain <b>any</b> <b>additional</b> strength before curving away from land and weakening into a tropical storm. After transitioning into an extratropical cyclone, it made landfall in southeastern Newfoundland. Overall, the hurricane's effects on land were minimal, despite multiple tropical cyclone watches and warnings. Initial uncertainty in its track prompted some concern of a landfall in North Carolina, but it remained predominately over the open ocean.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{had never}} seriously {{considered}} coaching, but he agreed take the head coaching {{position with the}} Lakers in 1994 at Buss' request. In 1992, Buss had given Johnson a contract that paid him $14 million a year, as payback for all the years {{he was not the}} league's highest paid player. Although Johnson's retirement prior to the 1992–93 NBA season voided this contract, Buss insisted that he still be paid. It was this arrangement that allowed Johnson to coach the team without receiving <b>any</b> <b>additional</b> salary. After Johnson ended his coaching stint, Buss sold him a 4% stake in the Lakers for $10 million, and Johnson served as a team executive.|$|E
5|$|MIT's {{proximity}} to Harvard University ("the other school up the river") {{has led to}} a substantial number of research collaborations such as the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology and the Broad Institute. In addition, students at the two schools can cross-register for credits toward their own school's degrees without <b>any</b> <b>additional</b> fees. A cross-registration program between MIT and Wellesley College has also existed since 1969, and in 2002 the Cambridge–MIT Institute launched an undergraduate exchange program between MIT and the University of Cambridge. MIT has more modest cross-registration programs with Boston University, Brandeis University, Tufts University, Massachusetts College of Art and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.|$|E

The 2nd Army consisted of three infantry divisions and one horsed cavalry regiment, supported by artillery, anti-aircraft artillery and border guards, with air reconnaissance support. The 2nd Army Group did not control <b>any</b> <b>additional</b> support units, and had several units with {{a significant proportion of}} Croat soldiers.|$|E
