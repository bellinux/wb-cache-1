5|$|Labradors are {{powerful}} and indefatigable swimmers noted {{for their ability}} to tolerate the coldest of water for extended periods of time. Their <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> quietly alongside hunters while watching for birds to fall from the sky, marking where they land, and then using their outstanding nose to find and retrieve dead or wounded birds has made them the king of waterfowl retrievers.|$|E
5|$|The Marsh Tacky {{is known}} by owners for its stamina and <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> {{in water and}} swamps without panicking. They tend to be sure-footed, sturdy, smart, and able to survive in {{challenging}} coastal environments, {{as well as being}} easy keepers. Their small size and gentle nature made them the historically preferred mount for children and women, but they were also used as working animals due to their abilities in the field. Today, they are used in endurance riding, as well as continuing their traditional work assisting humans with hunting wild game and herding cattle.|$|E
5|$|There are extant liturgical vestments {{containing}} embroidered figures, {{including that}} of St. Barbara, in Lochner's style and with similar facial types. This has led to some speculation whether Lochner provided the models. In addition a number of contemporary stained glass panels are similar in style, {{and there has been}} debate whether he might have been responsible for church murals; the over-life size figures of the Dombild and Virgin with the Violet indicate his <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on a monumental scale.|$|E

5|$|Through its <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> {{across a}} large range of animal species, {{universal}} primer technology can identify any bird, fish, reptile or mammal and satisfy legal evidence requirements {{in a court}} of law. Patents relating to this invention have been filed in several countries and the research papers published in various journals. This technique of CSIR-CCMB revitalised the field of wildlife forensics. It is currently being used routinely in LaCONES at the CSIR-CCMB to provide a wildlife forensics service across India in cases pertaining to wildlife crime.|$|E
5|$|Today, {{the breed}} is used mainly for meat, {{due to its}} {{extensive}} musculature. Horse meat is a dietary staple in many European countries, including France, Belgium, Germany and Switzerland. However, they are increasingly used for farm, forest and leisure work. Their nimble action, stamina and good temper make them increasingly used for competitive driving across Europe, and they have also been used as mounts for therapeutic horseback riding.

5|$|The Missouri Fox Trotter was {{developed}} from equine stock, including gaited horses, brought to Missouri by settlers from Tennessee, Kentucky and Virginia. Breeds {{that contributed to}} the Fox Trotter included the Arabian, Morgan, American Saddlebred, Tennessee Walking Horse and Standardbred. By the time of Missouri's statehood in 1821, the horses of the state were known for their unique gait, which was useful in the rocky terrain of the Ozark Mountains. The breed became popular with cattlemen for their smooth gaits and <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with cattle. In 1948, the Missouri Fox Trotting Horse Breed Association (MFTHBA) was founded in Ava, Missouri, with an open stud book that registered all horses with the fox trot gait and other specified physical characteristics. The first Fox Trotters were exported to Europe in the 1950s, when the Queen of England imported several palomino-colored horses.|$|E
5|$|The {{disease is}} {{widespread}} in the tropical and subtropical regions that exist in a broad band around the equator. This includes much of Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America. In 2015, there were 296 million cases of malaria worldwide resulting in an estimated 731,000 deaths. Approximately 90% of both cases and deaths occurred in Africa. Rates of disease have decreased from 2000 to 2015 by 37%, but increased from 2014 during which there were 198 million cases. Malaria is commonly associated with poverty and has a major negative effect on economic development. In Africa, it is estimated to result in losses of US$12 billion a year due to increased healthcare costs, lost <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> and negative effects on tourism.|$|E
5|$|When Major General Dwight D. Eisenhower was {{appointed}} as {{the commander of}} the European Theater of Operations in June 1942, he requested that Smith be sent from Washington as his chief-of-staff. Smith's record as a staff officer, and his proven <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> harmoniously with the British, made him a natural choice for the post. Reluctantly, Marshall acceded to this request, and Smith took over as the chief-of-staff at Allied Forces Headquarters (AFHQ) on 15 September 1942. Reporting to him were two deputy chiefs of staff, Brigadier General Alfred Gruenther and Brigadier John Whiteley, and also the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO), Major General Humfrey Gale.|$|E

5|$|Currently, {{the beam}} intensities at superheavy element {{facilities}} result in about 1012 projectiles hitting the target per second; this cannot be increased without burning {{the target and}} the detector, and producing larger amounts of the increasingly unstable actinides needed for the target is impractical. The team at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna is building a new superheavy element factory (SHE-factory) with improved detectors and the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on a smaller scale, but even so continuing beyond element 120 and perhaps 121 {{would be a great}} challenge. Krzysztof Rykaczewski, a professor at Oak Ridge National Laboratory which collaborates with Dubna on superheavy elements, has nevertheless predicted that in one generation element 124 would be reached. Chemist, writer, and philosopher of science Eric Scerri has noted that the development of new technologies in the field has been driven by the quest for new elements, so that the inability to proceed beyond elements 120 and 121 with current technologies may not necessarily cause a very long pause in new discoveries.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1947 {{invention}} of the cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game {{as well as the}} first to use an electronic display, the first true video games were created in the early 1950s. Initially created as technology demonstrations, such as the Bertie the Brain and Nimrod computers in 1950 and 1951, video games also became the purview of academic research. A series of games, generally simulating real-world board games, were created at various research institutions to explore programming, human–computer interaction, and computer algorithms. These include OXO and Christopher Strachey's draughts program in 1952, the first software-based games to incorporate a CRT display, and several chess and checkers programs. Possibly the first video game created simply for entertainment was 1958's Tennis for Two, featuring moving graphics on an oscilloscope. As computing technology improved over time, computers became smaller and faster, and the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on them was opened up to university employees and undergraduate students {{by the end of the}} 1950s. These new programmers began to create games for non-academic purposes, leading up to the 1962 release of Spacewar! as one of the earliest known digital computer games to be available outside a single research institute.|$|E
5|$|Waugh's {{health in}} the winter of 1953–54 was indifferent, and he was beset with various {{personal}} anxieties that were stifling his <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> He was also consuming alcohol, bromide and chloral in large amounts. In search of a peaceful environment in which he could resume writing, he embarked on a sea voyage to Ceylon, but was driven to the point of madness by imagined voices that assailed him throughout the voyage. These experiences are mirrored in the novel by those of Pinfold, a successful writer in the Waugh mould who, as an antidote to his lassitude and chronic insomnia, is dosing himself with a similar regimen of drugs. This cocktail brings about a series of hallucinatory episodes during a sea voyage taken by Pinfold {{for the sake of his}} health; he hears voices that insult, taunt and threaten him. He leaves the ship, but his unseen tormentors follow him. On his return to England, his wife convinces him that the voices were imaginary, and his doctor diagnoses poisoning from the bromide and chloral mixture. Pinfold, however, also views the episode as a private victory over the forces of evil.|$|E

5|$|With Stivetts now established, Clarkson became {{expendable}} and {{was released}} from the team on June30, leaving Boston with a solid three-man pitching rotation {{for the remainder of the}} season. On August6, 1892, Stivetts pitched a no-hitter against the Brooklyn Bridegrooms, an 11–0victory. Later, on September5, he started, completed, and defeated Louisville in both games of a doubleheader. The following day, the press credited the victories to his <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> well with runners on the bases. The regular season for the Beaneaters closed on October15 with a doubleheader against the Washington Senators. Stivetts pitched the second game, and delivered a complete game shutout, his third shutout of the season, and his 35th victory. Although he finished within the top-ten in several pitching statistical categories, his strikeout total dropped to 180in 1892. His 3.9strikeouts per 9innings pitched(K/9) was significantly lower from the 5.3the previous season.|$|E
5|$|The SASR {{has high}} {{personnel}} standards, and selection into the regiment {{is considered the}} most demanding of any entry test in the Australian Army. Members of the SASR are required to work in small teams for extended periods and often without support, and are specially selected for their <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in this environment, rather than as individuals. Selection {{is open to all}} serving Australian Defence Force personnel. Candidates must complete the Special Force Screen Test at the Special Forces Training Centre, which tests their physical fitness, and also includes an interview. About 64 percent of applicants pass this test. Successful candidates then continue on to the 21-day SAS Selection Course which assesses both the individual's strength and endurance (mental and physical), as well as overall fitness, ability to remain calm in combat, and to work effectively in small teams. The course consists of four phases with the first two mainly of physical and navigational exercises held at the Bindoon Training Centre. The third and fourth phases are conducted in the Stirling Ranges with long pack marches in phase three and small group exercises in phase four with little or no sleep and food. Around 10 to 30 percent of candidates pass selection. These candidates then progress onto the 16 month reinforcement cycle, during which they complete a range of courses including weapons, basic patrolling, parachuting, combat survival, signaller / medic, heavy weapons, demolitions, method of entry, and urban combat before posting to a sabre squadron if successful and awarded their Sandy beret. Officers must complete additional courses to qualify as an officer in the regiment, with requisite expertise in operations, administration and command. Most candidates are generally in their late-20s and are on average older than most soldiers. In 2010, a two-hour documentary SAS: The Search for Warriors was produced on the selection course. Earlier in 1985, the documentary Battle for the Golden Road, had also been produced on the course.|$|E
