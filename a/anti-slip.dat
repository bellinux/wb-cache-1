Although originally anticipated to be delivered in 2012, design complexity slowed down construction, delaying delivery of the first tram. The first E-class tram arrived at Yarra Trams' Preston Workshops on 28 June. In September 2013, there were two E-class trams at Preston Workshops undergoing non-passenger testing in preparation for introduction to service in late 2013.

The rope should, when held down by the feet, reach both of the gymnasts' armpits. One or two knots at each end are for keeping hold of the rope while doing the routine. At the ends (to the exclusion of all other parts of the rope) an <b>anti-slip</b> material, either coloured or neutral may cover a maximum of 10cm (3.94in).

The fundamental requirements of a rope routine include leaps and skipping. Other elements include swings, throws, circles, rotations and figures of eight. In 2011, the FIG decided to nullify the use of rope in rhythmic gymnastic competitions.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A series <b>Anti-slipping</b> {{tests on}} steel pipe joints with swivel coupler {{were carried out}} in this paper. Sixteen {{specimens}} after turnover loaded, were tested to investigate the influence of variations in the Fastener tightening torque (Tr, from 20 to 40 N·m), fastener turnover frequency (N, from 10 to 50) and turnover loading amplitude (△P, from 4. 0 to 8. 0 kN) on the <b>anti-slipping</b> performance of steel pipe joints with swivel coupler. The experimental results showed that, the <b>anti-slipping</b> ultimate strength and stiffness of specimens were increased first and then decreased with increasing Tr or N, and decreased with increasing △P. The swivel coupler turnover should not exceed the number of 20, and the force of diagonal bracing bearing should less than 6 kN...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Traction {{control for}} the proton {{exchange}} membrane (PEM) fuel cell hybrid vehicle is studied. The traction control denotes the <b>anti-slipping</b> action when the vehicle meets sudden road surface friction changes. Slip ratio is utilized to analyze the slipping action, and optimum value is chosen for controlling the motor speed to prevent the slip. A one-dimensional longitudinal model of a fuel cell vehicle is constructed to prove the traction control effectiveness. The model includes a fuel cell system, a battery, an inverter and permanent synchronous motor, a bi-directional converter and a vehicle dynamics. Two three-phase permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSM) are utilized to generate the required power for the vehicle traction. Maximum transmissible torque estimation (MTTE) control and sliding mode control are utilized for the PEM fuel cell vehicle traction control algorithms. The simulation {{results show that the}} proposed control algorithm effectively prevents vehicle slipping when a PEM fuel cell vehicle meets a sudden road friction change by distributing appropriate powers between battery and fuel cell...|$|R
40|$|Falling is a {{worldwide}} problem {{faced by the}} elderly, and it has serious consequences. The elderly falls in the bathroom very often, and this raises the concern {{of the connection between}} the high incidence of falls in the bathroom and postural control of putting on shorts. Because little is known about postural control while putting on shorts of any age group, this study investigated the effects of age and surface on postural control while putting on shorts. Healthy young adults (n[*]=[*] 15; age range: 21 – 27  years) and the elderly participants (n[*]=[*] 15; age range: 63 – 78  years) were compared in the temporal–spatial parameters, movement of center of mass (COM), and its interactions with center of pressure (COP) and kinematic measures under two conditions: <b>anti-slipping</b> mat and tile. The results demonstrated that the elderly had lengthened cycle time, decreased single-limb-support ratio, decreased medial–lateral velocity of COM, decreased relative displacement between COM and COP, decreased hip abduction–adduction angle, knee flexion angle, and the height of foot elevation. The elderly demonstrated a conservative strategy that may reduce the mechanical load on the supporting limb but preserve medial–lateral balance during the task. The adopted strategy may be relevant to the reduction of muscle strength and proprioception loss during natural aging process. Although surface did not affect the motion patterns of participants while putting on shorts, the slippery surface should be avoided. Other environmental modification such as a grab bar and bright illumination may have advantages in reducing the risk of falls...|$|R

2500|$|All {{wheel drive}} (AWD) {{historically}} was synonymous with [...] "four-wheel drive" [...] on four-wheeled vehicles, and six-wheel drive on 6×6s, and so on, {{being used in}} that fashion at least {{as early as the}} 1920s., GMC had orders for more than 4,400 all-wheel-drive military trucks." [...] Today in North America the term is applied to both heavy vehicles as well as light passenger vehicles. When referring to heavy vehicles the term is increasingly applied to mean [...] "permanent multiple-wheel drive" [...] on 2×2, 4×4, 6×6 or 8×8 drive train systems that include a differential between the front and rear drive shafts. This is often coupled with some sort of <b>anti-slip</b> technology, increasingly hydraulic-based, that allows differentials to spin at different speeds but still be capable of transferring torque from a wheel with poor traction to one with better. Typical AWD systems work well on all surfaces, but are not intended for more extreme off-road use. When used to describe AWD systems in light passenger vehicles, it refers to a system that applies torque to all four wheels (permanently or on demand) and/or is targeted at improving on-road traction and performance (particularly in inclement conditions), rather than for off-road applications.|$|E
