Other chemical products {{may be used to}} clean <b>and</b> <b>shine</b> shoes—in particular whiteners for white shoes, and a variety of sprays and aerosols for cleaning and waterproofing suede shoes. A banana peel {{can also be used to}} effectively shine shoes, but it is not recommended.|$|E
5|$|Brucie's win in 1940 {{coincided with}} the American Cocker Spaniel {{becoming}} the most popular breed of dog in the United States, and they would remain the most popular until 1952. The most recent victory was in 1954 with the victory going to Ch. Carmor's Rise <b>and</b> <b>Shine.</b> The popularity of the American Cocker increased {{once again in the}} 1980s with it becoming the most popular breed again from 1984 until 1990. In more recent years the popularity of the breed has decreased, with it ranked 15th most popular by the American Kennel Club in 2005.|$|E

5|$|Icke visited Shine four times. During {{the third}} meeting, on 29 March 1990, Icke felt {{something}} like a spider's web on his face, <b>and</b> <b>Shine</b> told him she had a message from Wang Ye Lee of the spirit world. Icke {{had been sent to}} heal the Earth, she said, and would become famous but would face opposition. The spirit world was going to pass ideas to him, which he would speak about to others. He would write five books in three years; in 20 years a new flying machine would allow us to go wherever we wanted and time would have no meaning; and there would be earthquakes in unusual places, because the inner earth was being destabilized by having oil taken from the seabed.|$|E
5|$|In 1990 Gielgud {{appeared}} in the James Scott-directed Strike It Rich, an adaptation of a Graham Greene novel co-starring Molly Ringwald and Robert Lindsay. That same year he made his last film appearance in a leading role, playing Prospero in Prospero's Books, Peter Greenaway's adaptation of The Tempest. Reviews for the film were mixed, but Gielgud's performance {{in one of his}} signature roles was much praised. He continued to work on radio, as he had done throughout his career; Croall lists more than fifty BBC radio productions of plays starring Gielgud between 1929 and 1994. To mark his ninetieth birthday he played Lear for the last time; for the BBC Kenneth Branagh gathered a cast that included Judi Dench, Eileen Atkins and Emma Thompson as Lear's daughters, with actors such as Bob Hoskins, Derek Jacobi and Simon Russell Beale in supporting roles. He made further cameo appearances on television, and in films including Branagh's Hamlet (as King Priam, 1996), Dragonheart (as the voice of King Arthur, 1996), <b>and</b> <b>Shine</b> (as Cecil Parkes, 1996). His last feature film appearance was as Pope Pius V in Shekhar Kapur's Elizabeth (1999). In 2000 he had a non-speaking role alongside Pinter in a film of Beckett's short play Catastrophe directed by David Mamet.|$|E

25|$|Though Odysseus warns his men, when {{supplies}} run short they impiously {{kill and}} eat {{some of the}} cattle of the Sun.

Under a threat from Helios to take the sun <b>and</b> <b>shine</b> it in the Underworld, Zeus shipwrecked the last ship and killed {{everyone}} except Odysseus.|$|E
25|$|Ink for {{the invitations}} was {{supplied}} by Chicago company BuzzInk, and the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies selected Precise Continental of Brooklyn, New York to print the invitations. Precise Continental {{was selected because}} it is a union company, uses recycled paper, and is Forest Stewardship Council certified. The printing technique for the invitations was engraving. The design was cut into the surface of a copper plate, which was then inked and inserted into a printing press with a sheet of paper. The result is a slightly raised impression {{on the front of the}} page and a slightly indented impression on the bottom. The first plate had to be scrapped because it was engraved without the President's middle initial. The golden seal was engraved in three printing runs. The first print laid down a rough-textured basic gold shape. The second run added smoothness <b>and</b> <b>shine,</b> and the final print run added the fine details to the seal. One million invitations were printed over 20 hours every day between December 11, 2008, and January 2, 2009, with employees working in two shifts and taking breaks only on Christmas Day and New Year's Day. The invitations were printed one at a time on 11×17 sheets of paper, which were then cut in half to 8½×11 sheets.|$|E

500|$|Cox {{benefited from}} co-creating Confessions, {{as well as}} from the success of [...] "Burn". He had {{previously}} contributed to records for Alicia Keys, B2K, Mariah Carey and Destiny's Child, but he felt 2004 introduced him to another landscape in the music industry. His contribution to this song elevated him to fame, and garnered more attention for his past work. [...] "Burn" [...] earned him two Grammy nominations. Cox said, [...] "Everybody who does this for a living, dreams about being nominated. It's the ultimate accomplishment. I've always been the silent guy — I come in, do my job and head out. I like to leave all the glory <b>and</b> <b>shine</b> to others, but this is the validation that means the most to me.

500|$|Evan Sawdey of PopMatters said, [...] "Of all the ballads, though, {{the quiet}} piano closer 'Glitter in the Air' takes the cake, never once overplaying its hand, {{remaining}} sweet without once ever succumbing to saccharine niceties (think of a Jason Robert Brown song without the vocal showboating). It's the sweetest {{moment on the}} entire disc, but it only succeeds because it's also the least complex song here". Craig Emonds of The South End stated that while [...] "every song has potential to do well and is quite likable, [...] Pink's vocals are strong <b>and</b> <b>shine</b> particularly in the ballad 'Glitter In The Air'." [...] Nekesa Mumbi Moodoy of the Associated Press said that [...] "What makes the song so moving is that despite all of the heartache, she doesn't appear gun-shy about taking the leap again".|$|E
500|$|Grunge {{music has}} {{what has been}} called an [...] "ugly" [...] aesthetic, both in the roar of the {{distorted}} electric guitars and in the darker lyrical topics. This approach was chosen both to counter the [...] "slick" [...] elegant sound of the then-predominant mainstream rock and because grunge artists wanted to mirror the [...] "ugliness" [...] they saw around them <b>and</b> <b>shine</b> a light on unseen [...] "depths and depravity" [...] of the real world. Some key individuals {{in the development of the}} grunge sound, including Sub Pop producer Jack Endino and the Melvins, explained grunge's incorporation of heavy rock influences such as Kiss as [...] "musical provocation". Grunge artists considered these bands [...] "cheesy" [...] but nonetheless enjoyed them; Buzz Osborne of the Melvins described it as an attempt to see what ridiculous things bands could do and get away with. In the early 1990s, Nirvana's signature [...] "stop-start" [...] song format and alternating between soft and loud sections became a genre convention.|$|E
