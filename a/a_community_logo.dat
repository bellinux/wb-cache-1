40|$|Abstract. Community {{analysis}} and maintenance functions of <b>a</b> <b>community</b> support system called Public Opinion Channel (POC) are described. A field-test and a psychological experiment using <b>a</b> <b>community</b> support system {{are important for}} investigating activities in <b>a</b> <b>community.</b> Existing community support systems, however, have limitations on having an experiment smoothly because few systems consider functions for supporting an experiment. To investigate activities in <b>a</b> <b>community</b> smoothly, community support systems should have community {{analysis and}} maintenance functions that support an analyst and <b>a</b> <b>community</b> organizer in <b>an</b> experiment. We implemented those functions in the POC system, and used in a field-test and a social psychological experiment. From these experiments, we found that proposed functions enabled an analyst and <b>a</b> <b>community</b> organizer to (1) find up-to-date state of <b>a</b> <b>community</b> during <b>an</b> experiment, (2) analyze relations between messages efficiently and objectively, and (3) maintain communities easily. Requirements for the functions, implementation, and experience in the experiments are described. 1...|$|R
