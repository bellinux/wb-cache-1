5|$|As a {{national}} political leader Pierce was an accident. He was honest and tenacious of his views but, {{as he made}} up his mind with difficulty and often reversed himself before making a final decision, he gave a general impression of instability. Kind, courteous, generous, he attracted many individuals, but his attempts to satisfy all factions failed and made him many enemies. In carrying out his principles of strict construction he was most in accord with Southerners, who generally had {{the letter of the law}} on their side. He failed utterly to realize the depth and the sincerity of Northern feeling against the South and was bewildered at the general flouting of the law and the Constitution, as he described it, by the people of his own New England. <b>At</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>did</b> he catch the popular imagination. His inability to cope with the difficult problems that arose early in his administration caused him to lose the respect of great numbers, especially in the North, and his few successes failed to restore public confidence. He was an inexperienced man, suddenly called to assume a tremendous responsibility, who honestly tried to do his best without adequate training or temperamental fitness.|$|E

50|$|The term quad {{buffering}} {{means the}} use of double buffering {{for each of the}} left and right eye images in stereoscopic implementations, thus four buffers total (if triple buffering was used then there would be six buffers). The command to swap or copy the buffer typically applies to both pairs at once, so <b>at</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>does</b> one eye see an older image than the other eye.|$|R

Early in the war at a large German parade the Commandant asked the watching civilians to raise their left hand if they were French citizens, very few raised an arm, he then asked people to raise their right arm if they were British. A photograph was taken and published with a caption stating islanders were saluting Hitler and shouting Sieg Heil, a simple trick.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the night}} {{different}} opposing ships {{came into contact}} in an arc as the German fleet proceeded from west to east across {{the tail of the}} British fleet. The two fleets were on similar courses so the encounter was drawn out over several hours, but <b>at</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>did</b> the British get a clear picture of what was happening. The action was characterised by determination and nerve on the German side to keep a steady course despite continual encounters with British destroyers, but by confusion and failure to report events by the British. Individual British ships showed considerable courage and determination in carrying out attacks, but their efforts were spoilt by confusion, which meant many ships turned away from possible targets, uncertain that they were enemy vessels.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, Montana voters {{adopted a}} new {{constitution}} which greatly expanded the state's treatment of water and water rights. Article IX, Section 3, Subsection 1 recognized and confirmed all existing water rights. Subsection 2 reiterated the 1889 constitution's wording, with only minor and non-substantive changes. Subsection 3, however, established state ownership of all waters (atmospheric and ground, as well as surface) within the state, declared them available solely {{for the use of}} the people, and declared that appropriation of water must be for beneficial purposes. Subsection 4 required the state to administer, control, and regulate water rights, and to establish a centralized record of such rights. <b>At</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>did</b> the 1971 constitutional convention recognize the control over Native American water rights exercised by the federal government under Winters and Powers.|$|E

The first time I heard it mentioned was in the 1980s and I immediately consulted Sir John Gielgud whose own performance of Jack Worthing in the same play was legendary and whose knowledge of theatrical lore was encyclopaedic. He replied in his ringing tones: [...] "No-No! Nonsense, absolute nonsense: I would have known".|$|E

However, this view was conclusively rejected already in 1846 by the military officer and antiquarian William Martin Leake, who pointed out that <b>at</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>did</b> English royalty hold Moreote titles, and that [...] "Clarence" [...] originates from Clare, Suffolk, and not Glarentza.|$|E

Mayor Feinstein said, [...] "This latest tragedy should close a very sad chapter in this city's history." [...] According to Orange County lawyer Jeff Walsworth, White had expressed remorse for the killings in February 1984. White reportedly stated that it would always cause him inner turmoil.

The occasional barking of a dog, heard in the distance, reminds one that it is the land of the savage.|$|R

500|$|Throughout the crisis, Kerr did {{not tell}} Whitlam of his {{increasing}} concerns, nor did he suggest that he might dismiss Whitlam. He believed nothing he said would influence Whitlam, and feared that, if Whitlam perceived him as a possible opponent, the Prime Minister would procure his dismissal from the Queen. Accordingly, though Kerr dealt with Whitlam in an affable manner, he did not confide his thinking to the Prime Minister. Labor Senator Tony Mulvihill later related that [...] "Whitlam {{would come back to}} each caucus meeting and say, 'I saw His Excellency... No worry. He's got to do it his way.'... <b>at</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>did</b> he hint that the Governor-General was frowning." ...|$|E

[...] However, <b>at</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>did</b> Smart ever believe himself to be insane; these meetings began before Smart was ever put into asylum because he still contributed, although not as significantly, to the Universal Visiter. In joking about writing for the Universal Visiter, Johnson claimed: [...] "for poor Smart, while he was mad, not then knowing the terms on which he was engaged to write... I hoped his wits would return to him. Mine returned to me, and I wrote in 'the Universal Visitor' no longer." ...|$|E

Secretly co-authored by Stanton, Modern Painting: Its Tendency and Meaning reviews the major art movements of the previous century from Manet to Cubism, praises the work of Cézanne (still largely unknown in the United States), and predicts a time, soon to come, when an abstract art of pure color will supplant realism. Synchromism itself, the subject of a lengthy, adulatory chapter, is presented as that desired end-point, the culmination of the modernist struggle, surpassing the work of [...] "lesser Moderns" [...] like Kandinsky and the Futurists; <b>at</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>does</b> the author acknowledge his own brother as one of the two originators of that school of art.|$|R

Just after the arrival of this mysterious soldier, McCoy nudged Travers, who was standing beside him, and reassured him by saying [...] "Don't worry Stephen, this is British Army". Travers thought that McCoy, a Protestant from Northern Ireland, was familiar with security checkpoints and had reckoned the regular British Army would be more efficient than the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR), who had a reputation for unprofessional and unpredictable behaviour, especially towards people from the Republic.|$|E

With Brian Blume, Gygax also designed the wild west-oriented role-playing game Boot Hill. In the same year, Gygax created the magazine The Strategic Review with himself as editor. But wanting a more industry-wide periodical, he hired Tim Kask as TSR's first employee to change this magazine to the fantasy periodical The Dragon, with Gygax as writer, columnist, and publisher (from 1978 to 1981). The Dragon debuted in June 1976, and Gygax commented on its success years later: [...] "When I decided that The Strategic Review was not the right vehicle, hired Tim Kask as a magazine editor for Tactical Studies Rules, and named the new publication he was to produce The Dragon, I thought we would eventually have a great periodical to serve gaming enthusiasts worldwide... <b>At</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>did</b> I ever contemplate so great a success or so long a lifespan." ...|$|E

[...] Toyah did not use protection with Dobber, so her sister, Leanne, persuaded her {{to go to the doctor}} for the morning-after pill. Taylor praised Leanne for being Toyah's [...] "conscience and the voice of common sense". She thought that Leanne had given her good and responsible advice on how to deal with what happened. The Daily Record's John Millar agreed with Taylor and wrote that the storyline was [...] "building to a stark warning for the millions of teenagers tuning into the Street." [...] Millar believed <b>at</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>did</b> the viewers get the impression that Toyah was doing something [...] "admirable" [...] and proclaimed that Toyah was [...] "the sort of girl who needs care and affection, which explains why the poor soul was coaxed into losing her virginity after a holiday romance convinced her that she was in love." ...|$|E
50|$|Commines' scepticism is {{summed up}} in his own words: Car ceux qui gagnent en ont toujours l'honneur ("For the honours always go to the winners"). Some have disputed whether his candid phrases {{disguise}} a deeper dishonesty. Yet <b>at</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>does</b> he attempt to present himself as a hero, even when recounting his military career. His attitude to politics is one of pragmatism, and his ideas are practical and progressive. His reflections on the events he has witnessed are profound by comparison with those of Froissart, who lived a century earlier. His psychological insights into the behaviour of kings are ahead of their time, reminiscent in some ways of his contemporary, Niccolò Machiavelli. Like Machiavelli, Commines aims to instruct the reader in statecraft, though from a slightly different viewpoint. In particular, he notes how Louis repeatedly {{got the better of}} the English, not by military might, but by political machination.|$|R
