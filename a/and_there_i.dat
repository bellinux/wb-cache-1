While Little Richard had a substantial influence on Jackson, James Brown was his greatest inspiration; he said: [...] "Ever since I was a small child, no more than like six years old, my mother would wake me no matter what time it was, if I was sleeping, no matter what I was doing, to watch the television to see the master at work. And when I saw him move, I was mesmerized.

[...] Gladstone immediately stated that he was not one of them, and the Queen gave Disraeli leave to quote her saying she had never approached a Prime Minister with such a proposal. According to Blake, Disraeli [...] "in a brilliant oration of withering invective proceeded to destroy Lowe", who apologised and never held office again.

The producers did not believe her as they felt that a movie star such as Goldberg would not want to appear in Star Trek, and ignored calls from her agent, until Goldberg called them personally. A meeting was arranged between her and Rick Berman, and she agreed to appear in six episodes of season two. Her character, Guinan, was named after Mary [...] "Texas" [...] Guinan, a prohibition-era speakeasy owner.|$|E

2500|$|Mirroring Seurat's work, Rimbaud {{writes of}} the circus sideshow as a {{reflection}} of contemporary life: [...] "their bantering or their terror lasts one minute, or whole months."
