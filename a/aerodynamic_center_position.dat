40|$|The {{design of}} a linear {{parameter}} varying (LPV) controller for the F- 16 longitudinal axes over the entire ight envelope, using a blending methodology that lets an LPV controller preserve regional optimal solutions over each parameter subset and reduces computationalcosts for synthesizing anLPVcontroller, is presented. Three blending LPV controller synthesis methodologies are applied to control F- 16 longitudinal axes. By {{the use of a}} function substitutionmethod, a quasi-LPVmodel of the F- 16 longitudinalaxes is constructed from the nonlinear equations of motion over the entire ight envelope, including nontrim regions, to facilitate synthesis of LPV controllers for the F- 16 aircraft. The nonlinear simulations of the blended LPV controller show that the desired performance and robustness objectives are achieved across all altitude variations.

40|$|A {{diamond wing}} and body {{combination}} {{was designed to}} have an area distribution which would result in near optimum zero-lift wave-drag coefficients at a Mach number of 1. 00, and decreasing wave-drag coefficient with increasing Mach number up to near sonic leading-edge conditions for the wing. The airfoil section were computed by varying their shape along with the body radii (blending process) to match the selected area distribution and the given plan form. The exposed wing section had an average maximum thickness of about 3 percent of the local chords, and the maximum thickness of the center-line chord was 5. 49 percent. The wing had an aspect ratio of 2 and a leading-edge sweep of 45 deg. Test data were obtained throughout the Mach number range from 0. 20 to 3. 50 at Reynolds numbers based on the mean aerodynamic chord of roughly 6, 000, 000 to 9, 000, 000. The zero-lift wave-drag coefficients of the diamond model satisfied the design objectives and were equal to the low values for the Mach number 1. 00 equivalent body up to the limit of the transonic tests. From the peak drag coefficient near M = 1. 00 there was a gradual decrease in wave-drag coefficient up to M = 1. 20. Above sonic leading-edge conditions of the wing there was {{a rise in the}} wave-drag coefficient which was attributed in part to the body contouring {{as well as to the}} wing geometry. The diamond model had good lift characteristics, in spite of the prediction from low-aspect-ratio theory that the rear half of the diamond wing would carry little lift. The experimental lift-curve slope obtained at supersonic speeds were equal to or greater than the values predicted by linear theory. Similarly the other basic aerodynamic parameters, <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>center</b> <b>position,</b> and maximum lift-drag ratios were satisfactorily predicted at supersonic speeds...|$|E

50|$|Forces (lift/drag) can {{be summed}} up to act through a single point, the center of {{pressure}}, about which sum of all moments equal zero.

At the 25% chord position the moment generated was found and proven to be nearly constant with varying angle of attack.
