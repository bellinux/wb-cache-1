40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} Japanese monetary policy from an institutional perspective. It argues that the BoJ’s conduct of monetary policy is mostly defensible when viewed within its institutional context. Much of the debate among Japanese policymakers on these issues {{can be seen in}} the context of burden-shifting and institutional shirking of responsibility for Japan’s wider structural problems. Japan’s deflationary experience can be given a structural explanation that is more compelling than purely monetary or cyclical interpretations. The Japanese experience also exposes a number of deficiencies in contemporary approaches to modeling monetary policy.

Surprisingly, when the homologous costimulator molecule B 7 - 2 was substituted for B 7 - 1 in this system, no specific CTL activity was obtained, Similarly, B 7 - 1 - but not B 7 - 2 -transfected P 815 cells generated alloantigen-specific CTL activity from C 578 L/ 6, accessory cell- and CD 4 (+) -depleted splenocytes, and costimulated proliferation of CD 8 (+) lymphocytes {{in the presence of}} low doses of anti-CD 3 mAb. In all systems, combined expression of both B 7 - 1 and B 7 - 2 costimulated as effectively as B 7 - 1 alone, arguing <b>against</b> <b>delivery</b> of a dominant negative signal by B 7 - 2. Proliferation of allogeneic, CD 4 (+) -depleted splenocytes in response to P 815 cells, which relies on costimulation by normal accessory cells, was inhibited by anti-B 7 - 1 but not anti-B 7 - 2 mAbs. Finally, indirect evidence suggested a higher avidity of B 7 - 1 (+) cells than B 7 - 2 (+) cells for CTLA 4. Thus, at least in the context of primary stimulation by irradiated P 815 transfectants, B 7 - 1 appears to be superior to B 7 - 2 at costimulation of CD 8 (+) T lymphocytes...|$|E

40|$|Present {{systems for}} {{streaming}} digital audio between devices connected by internet {{have been limited}} {{by a number of}} compromises. Because of restricted bandwidth and “best effort ” delivery, signal compression of one form or another is typical. Buffering of audio data which is needed to safeguard <b>against</b> <b>delivery</b> uncertainties can cause signal delays of seconds. Audio is in general an unforgiving test of networking, e. g., one data packet arriving too late and we hear it. Trade-offs of signal quality have been necessary to avoid this basic fact and until now, have vied against serious musical uses. Beginning in late 1998, audio applications specifically designed for next-generation networks were initiated that could meet the stringent requirements of professional-quality music streaming. A related experiment was begun to explore the use of audio as a network measurement tool. SoundWIRE (sound waves over the internet from real-time echoes) creates a sonar-like ping to display to the ear qualities of bidirectional connections. Recent experiments have achieved coast-to-coast sustained audio connections whose round trip times are within a factor of 2 of the speed of light. Full-duplex speech over these connections feels comfortable and in an IIR recirculating form that creates echoes like SoundWIRE, users can experience singing into a transcontinental echo chamber. Three simplifications to audio streaming are suggested in this paper: Compression has been eliminated to reduce delay and enhance signal-quality. TCP/IP is used in unidirectional flows for its delivery guarantees and thereby eliminating the need for application software to correct transmission errors. QoS puts bounds on latency and jitter affecting long-haul bidirectional flows. 1...|$|E

The study seeks {{to analyze the}} effect of boat transport on cost of goods in Lamu Island, Kenya. Using descriptive survey, the primary {{data for this study}} was collected from 42 major businesses. A structured questionnaire with Likert-type scale questions was used. A pilot test was run on 6 businesses and reliability measured using Cronbach's alpha and found to be α= 0. 90. Secondary data was obtained from books, journals, newspapers and websites. Data was subjected to computer aided statistical analysis that included descriptive statistics and correlation analyses. The results revealed that boat capacity, boat reliability and absence of transport alternatives are negatively correlated with cost of goods at p-value < 0. 05 meaning that the researchers can be 95 % confident that the relationship between variables is not due to chance. The study found that using boats alone to ferry cargo contributes 5 - 10 % of the cost of goods yet the channel is narrow and about 5 km only. Inadequate transport affects businesses and increases price of goods, burdening the consumer and affecting the overall competitiveness of the region. The study found that businesses ‘buffered’ stock as a safeguard <b>against</b> <b>delivery</b> failure. Recognizing that regional economies are shaped by unique geostrategic conditions, the study recommends increasing transport alternatives to lower cost of transport thus reducing cost of goods. This will increase the economic productivity of the region and improve the welfare of the community...|$|E
40|$|In {{the course}} of the last decade there has been a growing {{movement}} away from traditional product development and manufacturing associated with mass production to entirely new processes required to support Mass Customization. Mass customization is both a product development and manufacturing process that is being mandated by increasingly heterogeneous customer needs. It requires very flexible designs, and manufacturing and delivery processes that reduce the economic order quantities to a single customer order. It also requires a means to identify the elements of the product that should be customization capable. This thesis seeks to define Mass Customization, its relationship to the automotive industry, and its increasing importance in turbulent markets. It also considers two key enablers required to effectively implement Mass Customization: product modularity and customer preference measurement through the use of innovative Internet applications and tools. A significant focus of this thesis is to investigate the use of Mass Customization methodologies and of Internet based preference measurement methods for product design (e. g. conjoint analysis) to facilitate the timely incorporation of customer preference information further upstream in the PD process. An Internet based Conjoint Study, Kano Models and Trade-off Analysis was designed to determine customer preference for customizing certain attributes and their willingness to trade-off customization <b>against</b> <b>delivery</b> speed. Data illustrating the possible customer responses shows how the conjoint analysis results can be analyzed to aid product development teams in making the necessary design tradeoffs by understanding the customer preferences and associated homo/heterogeneity of the population. In addition a framework for understanding manufacturing complexity was developed. It proposes a way to understand the providing the attribute. A Value/Cost map was created to assist teams in making necessary tradeoffs regarding where to customize and where to standardize from a development and operational perspective. Also, an original approach for identifying the complexity related to product and process design was developed and proposed. Through this framework, development teams can more readily assess the true effect of product options on product combinations and discrete decisions related to complexity. Finally, a Customer vs. Product map was developed to help teams understand and implement the various methods of Mass Customization proposed by both Pine and Andersen. This thesis focuses how to implement Mass Customization by simultaneously incorporating engineering, marketing and management views. Designing for customization using modular product design and managing product development with complete customer preference data, points the way to successful Mass Customization, satisfied customers and profitable operations. by Michael W.

40|$|Leaders of European {{union and}} G 8 {{have set the}} target of 80 % {{reduction}} in greenhouse gases emissions by 2050 by decarbonizing the power and transport sector. There are several pathways to achieve this, some of them being a) use of renewable power and biomass b) improvement in transport and building energy efficiency and c) replacement of fossil based fuel with sustainable fuel. This thesis is focussed {{on some of the}} measures which can be taken by Air Transportation Industry to reduce GHG emissions and carbon footprint. Although, there are many ways in which air transport industry can achieve this goal, this work mainly discusses a) increase in power generation efficiency of aircraft systems b) use of sustainable fuels for aircrafts and c) some ways for sustainable fuel production for aircrafts in an efficient and economic way. However, it is only starting point for discussion and can be further extended to include more efficient and cheaper technologies with reduced carbon foot-print. In this study, use of bi-directional Solid-Oxide Cells (SOC) as auxiliary power unit (APU) on-board commercial aircraft is explored. These bi-directional SOC APU units can be used in the airport energy network either to produce cleaner energy or to produce sustainable fuels depending on the energy demand. This work focusses on use of these bi-directional SOCs as fuel cells during flight operations and as electrolysers to produce sustainable fuel at the airport when the aircrafts are parked. Hence, complete fuel production plant is designed to be situated at the airport. The scope of this thesis is limited to production of fuel for aircraft APU use only. Further extension of this project can include use of these bi-directional SOCs for providing electricity to the airport and fuel for other purposes. For analysis, medium range aircrafts like A 320 and B 737 are considered. This system is designed and dimensioned for producing 500 KW of electric power on-board aircarft. Jet fuel and ammonia are considered as fuel options for Solid Oxide Fuel Cell-Gas Turbine (SOFC-GT) based APU. Small scale airports like Eindhoven are studied to understand the flight frequency and parking duration for the aircrafts. These bi-directional SOCs are operational as Solid Oxide Electrolyzer Cell (SOEC) only when the aircraft is parked. Co-electrolysis is performed to produce syngas and steam electrolysis is done to produce hydrogen at the airport. Jet fuel is synthesized from syngas through Fischer Tropsch process and ammonia is synthesized from H 2 and N 2 through Haber Bosch process. Fuel synthesis plants are also designed as part of stationary fuel production plant at the airport. The fact that electrolyzer operates on excess available renewable electricity only, needs a special mention here. Intermittent nature of excess renewable electricity requires implementation of another source of sustainable syngas for fuel production so that sufficient capacity to supply all demand is ensured and robustness <b>against</b> <b>delivery</b> risks is achieved. Biomass gasification is one other method for generating fossil-free fuel. It uses biomass (birch wood) to produce syngas for sustainable fuel production at the aiport alongwith electrolysers. This leads to three cases of fuel production: - Case- 1 : Gasifier+fuel synthesis - Case- 2 : SOEC+fuel synthesis - Case- 3 : Gasifier+SOEC+Fuel synthesis ASPEN PLUS is used for modelling SOFC and stationary fuel production plant models with both jet fuel and ammonia. Modelling procedure for all the models is explained in detail with input parameters and process conditions. Thermodynamic analysis is carried out to compare the exergy efficiency of jet fuel and ammonia based SOFC-GT systems. It is observed that both jet fuel and ammonia based SOFC-GT systems give 62 % and 58 % exergy efficiency respectively which is higher than the conventional APU systems. Similarly, section by section exergy analysis is carried out for jet fuel and ammonia production plants to understand the exergy destructing processes. Comparison is made between exergy efficiency of jet fuel and ammonia production plants at the airport to understand thermodynamic behavior of both. Jet fuel synthesis produces significant amount of hydrogen and gasoline alongwith jet fuel as product. Therefore, two scenarios are analysed for exergy comparisons. a) Ammonia and jet fuel considered as product: Ammonia shows higher exergy efficiency than jet fuel production for all three cases enumerated above. b) Ammonia and (jet fuel, gasoline, hydrogen) are considered as useful products: For case- 1 and case- 3, jet fuel plant is exergetically more favorable than ammonia plant. However, for case- 2, ammonia plant has higher exergy efficiency than jet fuel plant. SPETProcess and EnergyMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|E
