25|$|Weta can bite with {{powerful}} mandibles. Tree weta bites are painful but not particularly common. Weta can inflict painful scratches, {{with the potential}} of infection, but their defence displays consist of looking large and spiky, and they will retreat if given a chance. Tree weta arc their hind legs into the air in warning to foes, and then strike downwards, so the spines could scratch {{the eyes of a}} predator. Pegs or ridges {{at the base of the}} abdomen are struck by a patch of fine pegs at the base (inner surface) of the legs and this action makes a distinctive sound. These actions are also used in defence of a gallery by competing males. The female weta looks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> a stinger, but it is an ovipositor, which enables her to lay eggs inside rotting wood or mossy wood or soil. Some species of Hemiandrus have very short ovipositors, related perhaps to their burrowing into soil and laying their eggs in a special chamber at the end of the burrow.|$|E
500|$|The game {{begins with}} a {{psychotherapy}} session conducted by Dr. Kaufmann, which acts as a frame story for Harry's quest. Suffering from issues with his memory, Harry travels home to search for his seven-year-old daughter Cheryl, hoping that she is already there. His consciousness moves between the in-game real world and Nightmare—a frozen version of the town in which monsters chase him—and finds that another family lives in his house. Police officer Cybil Bennett arrives and decides {{to take him to}} the police station, but they become caught in a blizzard, and Harry eventually leaves her car to continue his search. Eventually, Harry finds his way to the local high school, where he learns from a woman named Michelle Valdez that a Cheryl Mason attended school there previously, but then moved. [...] She offers to drive Harry to Cheryl's new address, but after briefly stepping away, he returns to find Michelle has been replaced by Dahlia Mason, who claims to be Harry's lover and acts <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> been with him the whole time. He accepts the ride, although during another shift to the Nightmare, the car falls into a river. Harry escapes but loses consciousness.|$|E
2500|$|In 1968, she {{was offered}} the role of Sally Bowles in the musical Cabaret. As Sheridan Morley later reported: [...] "At first she thought they were joking. She had never done a musical and she has an unusual croaky voice which sounds <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> a {{permanent}} cold. So frightened was she of singing in public that she auditioned from the wings, leaving the pianists alone on stage". But when it opened at the Palace Theatre in February 1968, Frank Marcus, reviewing for Plays and Players, commented that: [...] "She sings well. The title song, in particular, is projected with great feeling." ...|$|E
60|$|She ran {{to meet me}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been my daughter; <b>she</b> {{kissed me}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been my daughter; she fondly {{looked up at me}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been my daughter. At the sight of that sweet young face, so sorrowful, and so patiently {{enduring}} sorrow, all my doubts and hesitations, everything artificial about me with which I had entered the room, vanished in an instant.|$|R
60|$|I went along. One has {{to rally}} round a pal in distress. Aunt Isabel was sitting bolt upright, as usual. It {{certainly}} did seem <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> lost {{a bit of}} the zest with which <b>she</b> <b>had</b> started out to explore Broadway. <b>She</b> looked <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been thinking a good deal about rather unpleasant things.|$|R

2500|$|Despite Claire’s open {{disdain for}} her sister, {{she has never}} told Agnes about Tobias’s affair. It is not clear if she does this out of love or out of spite. She keeps the affair a secret, almost <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> a hidden weapon that she protects in case she may {{have to use it}} one day. When Agnes comes right out and asks Claire to confirm her suspicions about Tobias, Claire’s answer is, “Ya got me, Sis.” Shortly after this exchange, Agnes {{describes}} Claire in this way: “Claire could tell us so much if she cared to [...] [...] [...] Claire, who watches from the sidelines, has seen so very much, has seen us all so clearly [...] [...] [...] You were not named for nothing.” Claire is said to closely resemble Albee’s aunt Jane, an alcoholic and frequent visitor to the Albee home.|$|E
2500|$|Chun-Li is {{a central}} {{character}} in the 1994 anime film [...] She is investigating M. Bison's Shadowlaw organization suspected of murdering several diplomats, and requests to work with Guile; he initially balks at this as he wants to pursue Bison himself, but later they become inseparable. In a famous instance of fan service, an explicit scene showed Chun-Li showering in her apartment as a Shadowlaw assassin, Vega, arrives to kill her. The shower scene has been censored to varying degrees in versions of the English dub. After a brutal fight, Vega is kicked through a wall and sent plummeting several stories to the ground, but Chun-Li succumbs to her injuries and slips into a coma. She remains hospitalized {{for the rest of}} the movie, as a distraught Guile promises her that he will make Bison pay. Following Bison's defeat, Chun-Li pulls a prank on Guile by making it appear <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> died while he was away.|$|E
2500|$|Tohru survives {{the fall}} and is hospitalized. As she recovers, Akito accepts Tohru's friendship, and comes to accept both the person she is, instead of the god she has {{believed}} her father wished her to be, and the woman she was born as, instead of the man she was raised to be. Meanwhile, Yuki, who has realized that what he wants from Tohru is an unconditional [...] "motherly" [...] love, not {{the love of a}} woman, convinces Kyo to reconcile with Tohru when she is discharged from the hospital. But Tohru takes off in a dash once she see Kyo because she feels <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> been rejected, but Kyo chases after her. After catching up with her, Kyo confesses his feelings for her. This acceptance of the cat, the first friend of the god of the zodiac, breaks the zodiac curse and all the Sohmas are freed. In the last chapter, she and Kyo are shown packing to move to another city to continue his martial arts training, so that eventually he can inherit Kazuma's dojo, and in the final pages, it is revealed that they got married and had a son and a granddaughter.|$|E

2500|$|In The Shrew, {{these lines}} are spoken by Katherina {{near the end}} of the play. Petruchio's {{response}} is to beat her and anally rape her as his [...] "gang" [...] hold her down. As she is being raped, a high-pitched whistle sounds, with Katherina's mouth open as if the noise is her scream. At this point, the lights go down, and when they come back up, Katherina is dressed in an institutional gown. She delivers her final speech <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> learned it, without any emotion or inflection, and requiring frequent prompting by Petruchio. As she finishes, she is flanked by the modern day couple, one on each side of her, both in wedding attire, posing for imaginary photographers, [...] "a juxtaposition suggesting that marriage legitimates psycho-social and psycho-sexual abuse." [...] The final image of the play is Katherina in a wedding gown, chained to the ground, as a funeral bell tolls. Foregrounding the themes of sadism and brain washing, in this version, the happy ending of Shakespeare's play thus takes on a disturbing irony. Marowitz described his intention in The Shrew as [...] "a head-on confrontation with the intellectual substructure of the play, an attempt to test or challenge, revoke or destroy the intellectual foundation which makes a classic the formidable thing it has become [...] combat the assumptions of a classic with a series of new assumptions, and force it to bend under the power of a new polemic." [...] Due to the extreme nature of the production, the play divided critics and audiences, but it was a huge box office success.|$|E

[...] "She may be, as {{we agreed}} yesterday, a Genoese {{masquerading}} in that fashion, {{in order to be}} able to approach our traders without their suspicions being aroused. She looks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> made a captive of that vessel. I imagine she must have come up to her late yesterday evening, and has been at work all night stripping her. I hope she is too busy to attend to us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly, and that's what startled me. She {{came in to}} see me this afternoon, as she {{has done}} before, and we talked of {{the weather and the}} run of the ship and the manners of the {{stewardess}} and other such trifles, and then suddenly, in the midst of it, as she sat there, on no visible pretext, she burst into tears. I asked her what ailed her and tried to comfort her, but she didn't explain; she said it was nothing, the effect of the sea, of the monotony, of the excitement, of leaving home. I asked her if it {{had anything to do with}} her prospects, with her marriage; whether she finds as this draws near that her heart isn't in it. I told her she mustn't be nervous, that I could enter into that--in short I said what I could. All she replied was that she is nervous, very nervous, but that it was already over; and then she jumped up and kissed me and went away. Does she look <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> been crying?" [...] Mrs. Nettlepoint wound up.|$|E

5000|$|Of her {{victory in}} the Keystone State, New York Times analyst Alan Rappeport commented, [...] "Lots of Philadelphia history and imagery coming from Clinton now. It's almost <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> her {{convention}} speech ready." ...|$|E

5000|$|As a child, Treechada {{knew she}} was a girl, but {{in front of her}} parents, she had to pretend and live as a male.

50|$|This film is {{riddled with}} the {{unexpected}} characters, storyline twists and the music video style edits apparent in all Scott Shaw films. One character is a human rag doll that walks <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> no bones. Also included in the characters of this film are a biker, a vampire, a prostitute, and several assassin characters. Shaw frequently references all of these characters in his films.|$|E

60|$|No {{material}} compound {{could have}} been more dangerous to childhood, and nothing conceivable more attractive to Sally. The way in which that pretty little nude infant disported herself on that pile was absolutely tremendous. She sprang over things <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been made expressly to fly. She tumbled off things <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been created to fall. She insinuated herself among anchor-flukes and chains <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> been born an eel. She rolled out from among the folds of sails <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were a live dumpling. She seemed to dance upon upturned nails, and to spike herself on bristling bolts; but she never hurt herself,--at least <b>if</b> <b>she</b> did she never cried, except in exuberant glee.|$|R
