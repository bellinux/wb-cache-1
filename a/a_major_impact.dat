However, it may have formed more recently, perhaps as ejecta from a large impact on Ida. It is extremely unlikely that it was captured by Ida.

The financial crisis of 2008 which continued into 2009, had <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>impact</b> on the Swedish economy. Reinfeldt's Government emphasized that a balanced budget was a priority, combined with income tax cuts to stimulate domestic production and commerce.

5|$|About 10,000 years ago, malaria {{started having}} <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>impact</b> on human survival, {{coinciding with the}} start of {{agriculture}} in the Neolithic revolution. Consequences included natural selection for sickle-cell disease, thalassaemias, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, Southeast Asian ovalocytosis, elliptocytosis and loss of the Gerbich antigen (glycophorin C) and the Duffy antigen on the erythrocytes, because such blood disorders confer a selective advantage against malaria infection (balancing selection).

5|$|Betances is {{considered}} a pioneer of Puerto Rican liberalism. His ideas resulted from his exposure to republicanism and social activism in France through the middle part of the 19th. century. These ideas, considered subversive in the severely restricted Puerto Rico of the era, had nevertheless a considerable impact in the island nation's political and social history. His ideas on race relations alone had <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>impact</b> on economics and the social makeup of the island.|$|E

The Old World diseases brought with the Spanish and against which the indigenous New World peoples had no resistance were a deciding factor in the conquest; the diseases crippled armies and decimated populations before battles were even fought.

5|$|Historically {{the town}} {{was known as a}} major centre for the {{production}} of textiles (mainly linen) after the industrial revolution and it continued to be a major producer of textiles until that industry steadily declined in the 1990s and 2000s. The development of the 'new city' of Craigavon had <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>impact</b> on Lurgan in the 1960s when much industry was attracted to the area. The expansion of Craigavon's Rushmere Retail Park in the 2000s has affected the town's retail trade further.|$|E
5|$|Kinship was agnatic, with descent counted {{only through}} the male line, helping to build the {{importance}} of surnames and clans. The increased {{power of the state}} and economic change eroded the power of these organisations, and this process would accelerate as the government responded to the threat of Jacobite risings by undermining the power of clan chiefs in the eighteenth century. The Reformation had <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>impact</b> on family life, changing the nature of baptism, marriage and burials, leading to a change in wider relationships, sacramental status and burial practices and placing a greater emphasis {{on the role of the}} father.|$|E

The university has a close relationship with the city as Missoula's largest employer and with the millions of dollars the school brings into the city through visitors of school-sponsored sporting and cultural events. The university also houses Missoula's only business incubator, the Montana Technology Enterprise Center (MonTEC), and several start-up businesses.|$|E
50|$|Climate {{change is}} having <b>a</b> <b>majoring</b> <b>impact</b> on all {{ecosystems}} within Australia, and the Yarra Ranges National Park is no exception. As the temperature increases, the average rainfall with decrease, meaning less water flowing in the waterways. Less water reduces water quality that is supplied to Melbourne {{and used by}} the fauna and flora within the park. The annual surface temperature is predicted to increase by 0.6-1C and wind speed is set to increase by 6%. All these changes will impact what makes up the parks ecosystem and how it functions.|$|R

5|$|The first Ancient Hawaiians {{to arrive}} on Hawaii island lived along the shores where {{food and water}} were plentiful. Flightless birds that had {{previously}} known no predators became a staple food source. Early settlements had <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>impact</b> on the local ecosystem, and caused many extinctions, particularly amongst bird species, as well as introducing foreign plants and animals and increasing erosion rates. The prevailing lowland forest ecosystem was transformed from forest to grassland; some of this change {{was caused by the}} use of fire, but the main reason appears to have been the introduction of the Polynesian Rat (Rattus exulans).|$|E
5|$|The first Australian KFC {{was opened}} in 1968 in Guildford, {{a suburb of}} Sydney. The {{franchise}} was owned by a Canadian entrepreneur called Bob Lapointe. Between 1970 and 1971, 75 outlets were opened. This had <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>impact</b> on Australian chicken production, which increased by 38 percent during the period. By 1995 there were 452 outlets, and the company employed 12,000 staff. That year, Australia produced 35 percent of KFC's international earnings.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} the Renaissance on Scottish {{architecture}} began in the reign of James III in the late fifteenth century with the rebuilding of royal palaces such as Linlithgow, and reached its peak under James V. The Reformation had <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>impact</b> on ecclesiastical architecture from the mid-sixteenth century onward, resulting in simple church buildings, devoid of ornamentation. From the 1560s great private houses were built in a distinctive style that became known as Scottish Baronial. Such houses combined Renaissance features with those of Scottish castles and tower houses, resulting in larger, more comfortable residences.|$|E

5|$|The {{restoration}} {{of power to}} the patriciate was only temporary. After a period of unrest with repeated violent clashes such as the Züriputsch of 1839, civil war (the Sonderbundskrieg) broke out in 1847 when some Catholic cantons tried {{to set up a}} separate alliance (the Sonderbund). The war lasted for less than a month, causing fewer than 100 casualties, most of which were through friendly fire. Yet however minor the Sonderbundskrieg appears compared with other European riots and wars in the 19th century, it nevertheless had <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>impact</b> on both the psychology and the society of the Swiss and of Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|A {{prototype}} for the Kinetoscope {{was shown to}} a convention of the National Federation of Women's Clubs on May 20, 1891. The first public demonstration of the Kinetoscope {{was held at the}} Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences on May 9, 1893. Instrumental to the birth of American movie culture, the Kinetoscope also had <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>impact</b> in Europe; its influence abroad was magnified by Edison's decision not to seek international patents on the device, facilitating numerous imitations of and improvements on the technology. In 1895, Edison introduced the Kinetophone, which joined the Kinetoscope with a cylinder phonograph. Film projection, which Edison initially disdained as financially nonviable, soon superseded the Kinetoscope's individual exhibition model. Many of the projection systems developed by Edison's firm in later years would use the Kinetoscope name.|$|E
5|$|Both of the World Wars had <b>a</b> <b>major</b> <b>impact</b> on Stroma, {{which was}} only a dozen miles from the Royal Navy's chief base at Scapa Flow in Orkney. Six islanders died {{in each of the}} World Wars; the names of all twelve are inscribed on the island's war memorial, and during the Second World War as much as a quarter of the {{population}} was on war service. Adding to the island's economic problems, the introduction of the 11-plus exam in 1944 meant that all children over the age of 12 had to leave Stroma to complete their education at the secondary school in Wick. Because they could not commute between the island and Wick, they had to attend school as boarders, which incurred additional expenses for their parents.|$|E
