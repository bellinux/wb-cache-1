25|$|The {{provision}} of a mail service to soldiers remained {{an ad hoc}} affair until 1882. In 1881 a rebellion broke out in Egypt which threatened Britain's passage to India through Suez. In response a British Expeditionary Force was sent to Egypt {{in the same year}} under the command of Sir Garnet Wolseley. This gave Lieutenant Colonel du Plat Taylor the opportunity to raise the matter of the postal corps again and it was agreed that an <b>Army</b> <b>Post</b> <b>Office</b> Corps (APOC) should be formed. Mails from Britain were despatched 3 times a week via the 'overland route' through France to Alexandria. The Army Post Offices offered a letter and parcel service and sold stamps and postal orders. In addition to the mail services, a free parcel service from the Naval docks at Deptford was also set up. These parcels travelled by Government store ships and transports. This service was the forerunner of the Military Forwarding Office (MFO) service which still exists today.|$|E

Upon the advance of allied forces in 1917 and 1918, initially Field <b>Post</b> <b>Offices</b> and <b>Army</b> <b>Post</b> <b>Offices</b> served the local civilian population. Some of the latter offices were converted to Stationary <b>Army</b> <b>Post</b> <b>Offices</b> and became civilian <b>post</b> <b>offices</b> upon establishment of the civilian administration. In 1919 fifteen offices existed, rising to about 100 by 1939, and about 150 by the end of the Mandate in May 1948.

The APOC was eventually subsumed by the Royal Engineers in 1913 to re-emerge as the Royal Engineers (Postal Section) Special Reserve. The Postal Section provided the Army Postal Service (now British Forces Post Office) in the First and Second World Wars and in 1993 became the Postal & Courier Service Royal Logistic Corps.|$|E
