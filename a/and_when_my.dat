500|$|Lovato had no {{interest}} in forging a relationship with her late father, Patrick, after his divorce from her mother. She has been vocal about her abusive and strained relationship with her father and once stated, [...] "He was mean, but {{he wanted to be a}} good person. And he wanted to have his family, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>my</b> mom married my stepdad, he still had this huge heart where he said, 'I'm so glad that [...] taking care of you and doing the job that I wish I could do'." [...] She has written multiple songs about him. Patrick died of cancer on June 22, 2013, at age 53. After his death, Lovato said that he had been mentally ill, and in his honor she created the Lovato Treatment Scholarship Program.|$|E

500|$|Benjamin was {{the first}} U.S. senator to profess the Jewish faith. [...] In 1845, David Yulee, born David Levy, had been sworn in for Florida, but he renounced Judaism and {{eventually}} formally converted to Christianity. As an adult, Benjamin was a nonobservant Jew, {{who was not a}} member of a synagogue and took no part in communal affairs. [...] He rarely spoke of his religion publicly, but was not ashamed of it. Some of the stories told of Benjamin that touch on his faith come from Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise, who related that Benjamin delivered an address in a San Francisco synagogue on Yom Kippur in 1860, though whether this occurred is open to question as Wise was not there and it was not reported in the city's Jewish newspaper. One quote from Senate debate that remains [...] "part of the Benjamin legend", according to Evans, followed an allusion to Moses as a freer of slaves by a Northern senator, hinting that Benjamin was an [...] "Israelite in Egyptian clothing". Benjamin is supposed to have replied, [...] "It is true that I am a Jew, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>my</b> ancestors were receiving their Ten Commandments from the immediate hand of deity, amidst the thunderings and lightnings of Mount Sinai, the ancestors of my opponent were herding swine in the forests of Great Britain." ...|$|E

The next day, a song titled [...] "Mr. Valentine" [...] leaked onto the internet. Milian told Carson Daly on 97.1 AMP Radio. [...] "Yeah, I've signed with Young Money. It was pretty awesome. This weekend {{we had a}} big party, a big YMCMB party, and Drake was {{performing}} and we were all up on the stage and Wayne got up there and he announced it himself. And so I was kind of surprised and I was like, 'Oh my gosh, this is awesome!'" [...] Milian is currently recording her fourth album. [...] "We're just getting started on it," [...] she said. [...] "I've already halfway gotten there <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>my</b> mom and I went to Wayne and we played him some of the music, off the second song, he was like, 'I love it. Let's do this deal.' I have some music that's already going to be on it and the second half I'm working with them now. [...] When they did a little background check, they saw even the songwriting, {{all that kind of stuff}} adds on top of, alright, she's an actress, she's a pretty face, she can actually sing, but not to mention she's a songwriter. I thought that was cool that they even saw that. [...] They all get on each other's records, so all I have to do is be home with everybody and we'll just do lots of features." ...|$|E
2500|$|Goddard {{confirmed}} {{his work was}} used by von Braun in 1944, shortly before the Nazis began firing V-2s at England. A V-2 crashed in Sweden and some parts were sent to an Annapolis lab where Goddard was doing research for the Navy. If this was the so-called Bäckebo Bomb, it had been procured by the British in exchange for Spitfires; Annapolis would have received some parts from them. Goddard {{is reported to have}} recognized components he had invented, and inferred that his brainchild had been turned into a weapon. Later, von Braun would comment: [...] "I have very deep and sincere regret for the victims of the V-2 rockets, but there were victims on both sides ... A war is a war, <b>and</b> <b>when</b> <b>my</b> country is at war, my duty is to help win that war." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ullman credits {{her sense}} of humour to a feeling of both classlessness {{as well as her}} mother's working class roots. [...] "It comes from being classless, I think. My father was Polish and he died when I was six. And from being a little girl who went to gymkhana and had ponies, and went to a private school, and lived in a big house we {{suddenly}} didn’t have any money any more and had to go to a state school. And my mother’s family is all from South London, {{and we have a lot}} of uncles and friends over there. <b>And</b> <b>when</b> <b>my</b> father died they were very supportive, and they used to come down for the weekend - all these hordes of South London oiks. They used to invade our big Posh Bucks home and use the swimming pool, ride the ponies, and they were so funny these blokes; they really affected my sense of humour ... But I think the man who really affected my sense of humour was my uncle Butch, he was called Butch Castle. He was a decorator from South London - lazy old sod.
