25|$|The Super Nintendo Entertainment System (abbreviated as the Super NES or SNES) is a 16-bit {{video game}} console, which was {{released}} in North America in 1991, and in Europe in 1992. The console was initially released in Japan in 1990 as the Super Famicom, officially adopting the colloquially <b>abbreviated</b> <b>name</b> of its predecessor. The console introduced advanced graphics and sound capabilities compared with other consoles at the time. Soon, {{the development of a}} variety of enhancement chips which were integrated onto each new game cartridge's circuit boards, progressed the SNES's competitive edge. While even crude three-dimensional graphics had previously rarely been seen on home consoles, the Super NES's enhancement chips suddenly enabled a new caliber of games containing increasingly sophisticated faux 3D effects as seen in 1991's Pilotwings and 1992's Super Mario Kart. Argonaut Games developed the Super FX chip in order to replicate 3D graphics from their earlier Atari ST and Amiga Starglider series on the Super NES (more specifically, Starglider 2), starting with Star Fox in 1993. The SNES is the best-selling console of the 16-bit era although having experienced a relatively late start and fierce competition from Sega's Mega Drive/Genesis console.|$|E
500|$|The {{official}} {{opening of the}} BS by Sir Edwin Cornwall, chairman of the London County Council, took place on 10 March 1906.

The nickname was, however, deplored by The Railway Magazine, which complained: [...] "Some latitude is allowable, perhaps, to halfpenny papers, {{in the use of}} nicknames, but for a railway itself to adopt its gutter title, is not what we expect from a railway company. English railway officers have more dignity than to act in this manner." ...|$|E
500|$|The larger Ninja Tune {{record label}} {{had been growing}} in the United Kingdom at the time with help from artists DJ Food, Funki Porcini, The Herbaliser, and Coldcut. DJ Food and Funki Porcini noticed Tobin's work on Adventures in Foam and {{prompted}} the label to approach him. Ninja Tune signed Tobin in late 1996, this time under his <b>abbreviated</b> <b>name</b> [...] "Amon Tobin". The official Ninja Tune website has said that Adventures in Foam had been re-released without permission by the US-based Shadow Records that same year and that this unauthorized version, labeled the [...] "US release", included only 7 of the original songs, different cover art, and that some tracks were titled incorrectly. In 1997 Ninja Tune acquired the proper licenses from Ninebar and re-released the album themselves. This version included the original album in its entirety, and a second disc containing previously unreleased material. , copies of Shadow Record's [...] "US version" [...] are sold by online retailer Amazon.com. Over the course of its production, Adventures in Foam has been reviewed favorably. Ryan Schreiber of Pitchfork Media said that its break-beat style [...] "got totally out of hand", but that it [...] "never fails to let the listener know who's in charge." [...] The album was released for a fourth time in 2002, again by Ninja Tune.|$|E

500|$|Two men {{waiting for}} a flight to Chennai at the Biju Patnaik International Airport in Bhubaneswar engage in conversation. One is an {{advertisement}} filmmaker, Anbarasu (R. Madhavan), who prefers the <b>abbreviated</b> <b>name</b> [...] "A.Aras", {{and the other is}} a scarred, deformed but witty socialist, Nallasivam, alias [...] "Nalla" [...] (Kamal Haasan). When the flight is cancelled due to heavy rain, Aras initially suspects Nalla is a terrorist and informs the authorities, only to discover that he was mistaken. When the entire city becomes flooded, the two men find themselves forced to share a room for the night. Both need to return to Chennai: Aras to be present at his wedding, and Nalla so he can deliver a 3,200,000 cheque, recently awarded to him after he won a court case, to a group of union workers. After a traumatic night, and no hope for a flight, the two men take a bus to board the Coromandel Express train. Aras' bag gets stolen on the way leaving him with only his credit card, which no one accepts. Using his presence of mind, Nalla repeatedly bails Aras out of trouble while Aras tries escaping from him at every juncture, only to end up with him again. While waiting for the train at the Ichchapuram railway station, Nalla begins to tell Aras his story.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of a naming convention and the use of <b>abbreviated</b> <b>names</b> and a related ontology for science work and distant robotic action that comprise requests for a robotic rover during the NASA Mars Exploration Rover (MER) mission, run by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). We demonstrate how <b>abbreviated</b> <b>names</b> and an associated ontology support sharing and identifying information among teams and software tools. An ontology of distant action must take into account a dynamic environment, changing in response to physical events and intentional actions, and reflect the influence of context on the meaning of action. The nascent domain of Martian tele-robotic science, in which specialists request work from a rover moving through a distant landscape, as well as the need to consider the interdisciplinary teams involved in completing that work, required an empirical approach. The formulation of this ontology used ethnographic methods and grounded theory to study human behavior and work practice with software tools...|$|R
2500|$|Masters of Arts of {{the three}} {{universities}} may use the post-nominal letters [...] "MA".

The <b>abbreviated</b> <b>name</b> of the university (Oxon, Cantab or Dubl) is therefore almost always appended in parentheses to the initials [...] "MA" [...] {{in the same way that}} it is to higher degrees, e.g. [...] "John Smith, MA (Cantab), PhD (Lond)," [...] principally so that it is clear (to those who are aware of the system) that these are nominal and unexamined degrees.|$|E
2500|$|In older literature, Rashi is {{sometimes}} referred to as Jarchi or Yarhi (...) , his <b>abbreviated</b> <b>name</b> being interpreted as Rabbi Shlomo Yarhi. This was understood to refer to the Hebrew name of Lunel in Provence, popularly derived from the French lune [...] "moon", in Hebrew , in which Rashi was assumed to have lived at some time or to have been born, or where his ancestors were supposed to have originated. Simon and Wolf claimed that only Christian scholars referred to Rashi as Jarchi, and that this epithet was unknown to the Jews. Bernardo de Rossi, however, demonstrated that Hebrew scholars also referred to Rashi as Yarhi. In 1839, Leopold Zunz showed that the Hebrew usage of Jarchi was an erroneous propagation of the error by Christian writers, instead interpreting the abbreviation as it is understood today: Rabbi Shlomo Yitzhaki. The evolution of this term has been thoroughly traced.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{featuring}} {{improved performance}} over the original Kinect, its successor has {{been subject to}} mixed responses. In its Xbox One review, Engadget praised Xbox One's Kinect functionality, such as face recognition login and improved motion tracking, but that whilst [...] "magical", [...] "every false positive or unrecognized [...] command had us reaching for the controller." [...] The Kinect's inability to understand some accents in English was criticized. [...] Writing for Time, Matt Peckham described the device as being [...] "chunky" [...] in appearance, but that the facial recognition login feature was [...] "creepy but equally sci-fi-future cool", and that the new voice recognition system was a [...] "powerful, addictive way to navigate the console, and save for a few exceptions {{that seem to be}} smoothing out with use". However, its accuracy was found to be affected by background noise, and Peckham further noted that launching games using voice recognition required that the full title of the game be given rather than an <b>abbreviated</b> <b>name</b> that the console [...] "ought to semantically understand", such as Forza Motorsport 5 rather than [...] "Forza 5".|$|E
