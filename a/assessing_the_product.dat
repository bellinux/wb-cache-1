40|$|Grading {{individual}} students in teams or projects {{has always been}} problematic. To accurately gauge individual learning outcomes, students’ grades need {{to be based on}} what they have learned as an individual within the team or project context. However, within engineering team-based projects, individuals have traditionally been assigned a grade heavily influenced by the team’s project outcomes. Final year engineering projects (FYEP) suffer from similar problems. While typically in the Australian context, the projects are conducted by individuals, they are still conducted using the philosophy of PBL. To provide a reliable indicator of student capability and program quality and standards, FYEPs must be coherent, valid and reliable instruments for student assessment and program evaluation. This paper considers two Australian engineering education projects, one recently completed and one current, that investigate the issues of; how can individuals who learn in a team environment be assessed as individuals?, how can the outcomes from final year engineering projects be used to demonstrate the standards required by various state and professional accrediting agencies? And what are the issues that prevent staff effectively assessing the learning outcomes of {{individual students}} who learn in the project environment? The paper outlines an assessment model that was trialled and discusses the issues arising. The difference between this form of assessment and others in engineering education is that it assesses the learning outcomes of the individuals as opposed to <b>assessing</b> <b>the</b> <b>product</b> of the team. The paper also discusses the results from the first stage of data gathering on final year projects in Australia. The conclusion is that <b>assessing</b> <b>the</b> <b>product</b> rather than the learner degrades the opportunity to use projects as evidence of learning, but continues because it is easier for academic staff...|$|E

40|$|Many {{investigators}} studying {{patient satisfaction}} {{have shown that}} the mode of medical care de-livery appears to be more important to the pa-tient than the content. Recent studies pertain-ing specifically to patients undergoing prenatal diagnostic testing also show an association be-tween psychosocial and clinical history factors and patient satisfaction. The authors reviewed 535 patients in a prenatal diagnosis centre to determine which variables most significantly af-fect patient satisfaction; 41 variables were tested for their association with satisfaction. Of the 9 variables that were shown to be signifi-cant, patient/staff interaction was found to be most critical in predicting satisfaction. This study showed no association between psychoso-cial and clinical history factors and patient sat-isfaction. Key words: patient satisfaction, prenatal diagno-sis and treatment, ultrasound, prenatal proce-dures, non-stress test. The concept of quality takes on a distinct meaning when it is viewed within the environment of a hos-pital. In this context, a good product is not quite good enough. The product demands a standard of excel-lence that is the mark of a professional working in a professional organization that is reaching out to sat-isfy human needs. In <b>assessing</b> <b>the</b> <b>product,</b> in this case the prenatal diagnosis and treatment program, the focus necessar-ily becomes the consumer.

40|$|Considerable {{research}} into new learning paradigms for professional engineering curricula, resulted in 1998 in Central Queensland University (CQU) transitioning {{from a traditional}} lecture centric program to a project based learning program. This integrated project based, and industry placement, work and learning in the engineering program curricula. Assessment problems arose {{from the fact that}} the learning experiences were not being assessed but rather the ‘technical outcome’ of the experience. Observation identified, supported by research, that this stifled students in that they were ‘one-dimensionally’ focused on ‘fast-tracking’ what they believed they needed to do to achieve the desired grade, based on traditional notions of the ‘technical’ outcome being the be-all and end-all! Research, supporting CQU delivery experience, indicated a holistic approach to learning and its assessment, incorporating reflective practice with the freedom to not ‘have ‘ to achieve the ‘best(?!) result first time, was advantageous for deep learning. In effect, students and facilitators needed to accept that mistakes would (should?) be made and that students learn best from those mistakes. The practice of <b>assessing</b> <b>the</b> <b>product,</b> not the learning, but the result of learning had to be broken. To achieve this, research suggested decoupling the learning experiences from the assessment. This meant that while students learned to solve holistic problems through projects, they should not be summatively assessed on the project ‘solution’. Effective assessment methods need to demonstrate meaningful learning and understanding rather than ‘rote learning’ and regurgitation. Assessment techniques and instruments should also encourage reflection and learning integration with personal and professional development. Research yielded a potential solution - portfolio assessment, as the sole summative assessment tool. This was introduced for engineering project based courses and co-operative education work placements. It focuses students on, and makes them responsible for, specifically addressing and demonstrating their achievement of learning outcomes...|$|E

40|$|Since 2008 {{the faculty}} of Industrial Design Engineering at the TU Delft hosts the minor Sustainable Design Engineering. The minor has been highly useful as a {{platform}} to pilot new ways of teaching engineering for sustainable development. Instead of having students make life cycle assessments and introduce them to straightforward checklists to improve their product designs, we challenge our students to develop a critical understanding of sustainability and use multidimensional assessments. Sustainability {{is not just about}} environmental benefits but also about useful products and added value. This paper describes our educational approach in the photovoltaics practicum (part of the minor). Our objective is to illustrate how such a multidimensional assessment works in practice and how it has helped students to develop a more critical, systemic perspective on sustainability. Students are asked to evaluate a PV-powered product on its sustainability by assessing the technology, usability and the environmental impact. To date, over 150 students have followed the minor, which gives us a large database of multidimensional assessments {{on a wide range of}} PV powered products. This paper describes the conclusions we have drawn on the validity of our approach. Our findings show that many of the currently available products with integrated PV systems are initially perceived as “green” but after <b>assessing</b> <b>the</b> <b>product</b> on multidimensional aspects students invariably reach a more nuanced perspective, with some products failing to pass the test.
