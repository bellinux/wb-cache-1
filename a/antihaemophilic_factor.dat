50|$|Cryoprecipitate, {{also called}} cryo for short, is a frozen blood product {{prepared}} from blood plasma. To create cryoprecipitate, {{fresh frozen plasma}} is centrifuged and the precipitate is collected. It is often transfused as a four- to six-unit pool instead of as a single product. One {{of the most important}} constituents is factor VIII (also called <b>antihaemophilic</b> <b>factor</b> or AHF), which is why cryoprecipitate is sometimes called, or refined into, cryoprecipitated <b>antihaemophilic</b> <b>factor</b> or cryoprecipitated AHF. In many clinical contexts, use of whole cryoprecipitate has been replaced with use of clotting factor concentrates made therefrom, but the whole form is still routinely stocked by many hospital blood banks.|$|E

Platelet adhesiveness was increased in von Willebrand's disease by previously coating the beads with normal or haemophilic plasma or cryoprecipitate, whereas von Willebrand plasma had no corrective effect. <b>Antihaemophilic</b> <b>factor</b> (AHF) concentrates were studied in the same way and results compared with experiments in vivo...|$|E

No cephalin-like activity was found in cerebrospinal fluid but prothrombin activity averaged about 0 · 5 % of normal plasma activity. The {{activity of}} factor VII was negligible in almost all cases. The activity of <b>antihaemophilic</b> <b>factors</b> showed great variation but {{in the majority of}} cases it did not exceed 1 % of normal plasma activity.

40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{assessing}} the global value of AdvateTM, <b>antihaemophilic</b> recombinant <b>factor</b> for bleeding prevention and control in Haemophilia A. Epidemiological, clinical, organizational {{and social and}} ethical data related to available Haemophilia treatments were considered. Scientific literature reviews were conducted through all main electronic databases. A cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) {{from the perspective of}} the National Health Service (NHS) was performed in order to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) comparing the use of octocog alfa in primary prophylaxis vs on-demand treatment. In the world, patients with Haemophilia A are approximately 110, 000 (about 3700 in Italy). Prophylaxis,compared to on-demand treatment, is proven to be more effective for prevention of bleedings and related complications, but also moderately more expensive (ICER= € 35, 036 /QALY). The introduction of totally protein-free full length recombinant FVIII concentrates (AdvateTM), eliminated risks of blood-borne pathogens transmission. This induced a broader adoption of prophylaxis improving efficacy of treatment and patients’ Quality of Life (QoL). Also, since Baxter, AdvatÈs manufacturer and distributor, offers collateral free of charge services to patients (home delivery, home rehabilitation assistance, home nursing, telemedicine), the HTA looks at how all these services generate savings for the healthcare authorities while increasing the level of assistance. The evidence provided by HTA should be taken into account by decision-makers to improve the allocation of resources and rationalize health choices...|$|R

The time course of the response was biphasic, two surges of factor VIII being observed. DDAVP {{was found to be}} the most potent of the substances investigated. Its optimal dose was 1 microgram kg- 1 body wt (i. v.). It is suggested that a similar procedure can be employed to search for new peptides with anti-haemophilic action...|$|E
40|$|A {{specific}} antiserum {{against an}} <b>antihaemophilic</b> <b>factor</b> (AHF) -related plasma protein {{was raised in}} rabbits. A quantitative immunochemical method {{was used to determine}} the amount of this protein present in the plasma of 33 patients with haemophilia A and 70 patients with von Willebrand's disease. The protein probably consisted of AHF residing in or complexed with the von Willebrand factor. The patients with von Willebrand's disease were shown to fall into two separate genetic groups, one with decreased and one with normal amounts of the AHF-related protein. The patients with haemophilia A had normal amounts of the protein in their plasma...|$|E
40|$|Cryoprecipitate <b>antihaemophilic</b> <b>factor</b> {{concentrate}} {{was prepared}} from fresh and 24 -hour-old blood by quick and slow thaw methods. Recovery of factor VIII was greater by the slow thaw method {{and there was}} less loss into the supernatant plasma. Cryoprecipitate produced from fresh blood contained more factor VIII than that produced from 24 -hour-old blood so that the most potent concentrate was produced from fresh blood by the slow thaw process. An adequate therapeutic preparation was, however, produced by the slow thaw method using 24 -hour-old blood and {{it is suggested that}} this procedure could be adopted in order to supplement supplies...|$|E
40|$|Attendances at the Regional Haemophilia Reference Centre in the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary {{have been}} {{analysed}} {{over a period}} of five years from 1969 to 1973. Of 77 patients registered in 1969, 64 had haemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency) and 13 had haemophilia B (factor IX deficiency). In 1973 the numbers were 68 and 14 respectively. An increased attendance at the Centre from 123 in 1969 to 624 in 1973 was noted. This was due to patients reporting earlier and more frequently for outpatient treatment of haemarthroses which occurred with the greater availability of supplies of factor VIII. The number of admissions for inpatient treatment did not change significantly over the period. Haemarthrosis of the knee was the commonest dominant lesion. The amount of replacement therapy in the form of fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate, <b>antihaemophilic</b> fraction, and <b>factors</b> II, IX, and X concentrate used in the Centre (ie, excluding that used for elective procedures) increased from 2704 donor units in 1969 to 8778 donor units in 1973, the main increase being in cryoprecipitate. The number of factor VIII units used per patient attending per year, for both elective and emergency treatment in haemophiliacs, is recorded and discussed as are its effects on the treatment patterns of patients and the implications for the future...|$|R
40|$|In {{the theory}} of blood {{coagulation}} proposed by Biggs (1955) it is supposed that blood thrombo-plastin is produced by the interaction of anti-haemophilic globulin, Christmas factor, platelet lipoid factor, factor VII, factor V, and calcium. Russell viper venom (R. V. V.) {{can act as a}} thromboplastin, i. e., convert prothrombin to thrombin, only after combination with platelet lipoid factor and factor V (Rapaport, Aas, and Owren, 1954 a). The action of R. V. V. would, therefore, appear to resemble that of a mixture of <b>antihaemophilic</b> globulin, Christmas <b>factor,</b> and factor VII, and the observation of Owren (1954) that R. V. V. gives normal one-stage prothrombin times with samples of plasma deficient in these sub-stances supports this hypothesis. The experiments described in this paper were undertaken to obtain more direct evidence of the relation of R. V. V. to the substances developed during coagulation. The thromboplastin generation test devised by Biggs and Douglas (1953), which enables the contribu-tions of the clotting factors in plasma, in serum, and in platelets to be assessed separately, was used for this purpose. By introducing R. V. V. in place of the ordinary constituents of the test, the relative efficacy of R. V. V. and the thromboplastin ante-cedents found in the human blood has been deter-mined. In addition, the effect of plasma lipoid on the coagulant action of. R. V. V. (Macfarlane, Trevan, and Attwood, 1941; Fullerton and Anastasopoulos, 1949) and the effect of adsorption of R. V. V. on a mineral precipitate (Jenkins, 1954) have been re-investigated...|$|R
40|$|Gastrointestinal {{haemorrhage}} {{has been}} {{regarded as one of}} the commonest clinical manifestations of haemophilia and Christmas disease and has always been associated with a high mortality. In a retrospective study of adult patients with haemophilia in the Western Region of Scotland it was found that 32 patients had experienced 107 separate episodes of haematemesis or melaena. This represents an incidence of 25 per cent of the patients at risk. The commonest cause was peptic ulceration •which was proven in 53 per cent of these patients by serial barium-meal examinations. The diagnosis of the cause of bleeding on the first occasion remains a problem as in only nine out of 32 patients was a probable cause shown. Bleeding as a result of ingestion of salicylates or alcohol was uncommon. When dyspeptic symptoms were used to produce a clinical division of the patients into two subgroups it was found that there was a significantly higher number of patients with a severe grade of haemophilia who were eupeptic when they bled whereas in the dyspeptic group there was a significantly higher number of moderately affected patients. Emergency surgical procedures used to be commonplace to control bleeding but in this series only one patient required emergency surgery. All acute bleeding episodes were controlled by plasma or plasma concentrate and elective surgery performed as necessary. Only one patient died of haemorrhage and he was shown to have a potent <b>antihaemophilic</b> <b>factor</b> inhibitor. It is apparent that modern treatment with potent plasma concentrates has substantially altered the prognosis in patients with coagu-lation defects, but has introduced the hazards of serum hepatitis and <b>antihaemophilic</b> <b>factor</b> inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|Antihaemophilic-factor-A-antibodies, {{which had}} spontaneously arisen in 2 patients, {{were used to}} develop an immunoradiometric method for {{measurement}} of <b>antihaemophilic</b> <b>factor</b> A antigen (VIII:CAg). 13 patients with severe haemophilia A had VIII: CAg below the limit of detection (0. 01 U/ml). Patients with moderate and mild haemophilia A either had VIII:CAg roughly equal to factor VIII clotting activity (VIII:C) or a not detectable VIII:CAg, suggesting 2 different molecular mechanisms in moderate and mild haemophilia A. VIII:CAg could be detected in serum but in lower amounts than in plasma. In 2 patients with von Willebrand's disease VIII:CAg equalled VIII:C. The post-transfusional retarded increase of VIII:C in 1 patient with von Willebrand's disease {{was accompanied by a}} slight increase in VIII:CAg. Fetal plasma contained measurable amounts of VIII:CAg...|$|E
40|$|A {{requirement}} for a minimal threshold level of moisture {{in order for}} efficient virus inactivation to occur during dry heat treatment of freeze-dried coagulation factor concentrates is described. Techniques used to determine moisture content during heating were Loss on Drying and Karl Fischer. The Loss on Drying was suspected to have occasional errors {{as a result of}} sample preparation being influenced by interference from atmospheric moisture. Therefore, a non-invasive, non-destructive method for determination of residual moisture content using near infrared spectrometry(NIR) was developed for freeze-dried <b>antihaemophilic</b> <b>factor</b> (AHF). Calibration equations were determined against Loss on Drying and Karl Fischer assay methods and these equations evaluated for the predictive efficiency. Both Loss on Drying and NIR were used to evaluate the effect of moisture content on the efficiency of virus inactivation by dry heat at 80 degrees C. A minimum level of moisture of greater than 0. 7 %, as determined by Loss on Drying, was necessary for a virus reduction in the magnitude of 4 log(10) for hepatitis A virus, porcine parvovirus and pseudorabies virus.

40|$|The {{demand for}} blood {{products}} containing factor VIII for treating patients with haemophilia A in south-east Scotland was reviewed. From 1961 to 1975 {{the demand for}} fresh frozen plasma (FFP), cryoprecipitate (CP), and <b>antihaemophilic</b> <b>factor</b> (AHF) increased by {{seven and a half}} times, while total donations increased by only a third. Patients with severe haemophilia A treated at the regional haemophilia centre used about 85 % of the factor VIII issued in 1971 - 4, most of which was used on demand. A patient with severe haemophilia A on unlimited ondemand home treatment would need about 500 units of factor VII/kg body weight/year, and a regional haemophilia centre, treating moderate and mild cases as well as severe ones, would use 15000 units/patient/year. Altogether about 50 million units of factor VIII will be needed each year in the UK. Although cryoprecipitate is much harder to store and administer than AHF, its yield from plasma may be far greater and its cost far smaller. Unless the blood transfusion services receive increased amounts of money and reappraise their functions and operation, it seems likely that they will have to rely increasingly on commercial (and costly) sources for the major plasma fractions...|$|E
40|$|A 21 residue peptide {{from the}} C 2 {{domain of the}} <b>antihaemophilic</b> <b>factor</b> VIII competes with factor VIII for membrane-binding sites in vitro. Here, we provide the {{structure}} and topography of the peptide in solution, on dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles, determined using 1 H-NMR spectroscopy. The peptide assumes an amphipathic structure comprising an extended N-terminal region and a C-terminal helix. The average root-mean-square deviation is 0. 7 +/- 0. 2 A for the superimposition of the backbone atoms of Ile 6 to Arg 18 on the lowest energy structure. Whereas the backbone conformation {{is similar to that}} in SDS micelles, the Trp 11 side-chain orientation is dramatically changed. The indole ring is nearly parallel to the peptide backbone in SDS micelles but perpendicular in DPC micelles. Further, pKa values of the two histidines change by more than 1 pH unit in SDS relative to DPC, which localizes the imidazole rings to the interfacial region. Line-broadening induced by spin-labelled phosphatidylcholine shows that most of the amino acid side-chains that penetrate the DPC micelle are hydrophobic. Thus, the long axis of the peptide lies parallel to the micelle surface and the hydrophobic face of the alpha-helix provides hydrophobic membrane interaction. The large chemical shift changes shown by Trp 11 and N-terminal amino acid residues in SDS relative to DPC indicate that this region may be involved in membrane phospholipid recognition. 1 H-NMR assignments, CD spectra, one-dimensional 1 H-NMR spectra, chemical-shift analysis and nuclear Overhauser effect information are reported in Supplementary Publication SUP 50184 (11 pages), which has been deposited at the British Library Document Supply Centre, Boston Spa, Wetherby, West Yorkshire LS 23 7 BQ, U.
