5|$|Rufus's {{gameplay}} {{has been}} compared to the fighting styles used by Street Fighter III characters Yun and Yang by the development team, notably in regards to his diving kick attack, and emphasized mobility while attacking. Other attacks were designed as a means to negate enemy offensives, such as the Galactic Tornado, which destroys enemy projectiles while drawing the opponent closer to Rufus for a final strike. His Ultra Combo, Space Opera Symphony, is <b>a</b> <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> attacks that requires close proximity to the opponent, dealing several blows and ending in a final upwards blast.|$|E
5|$|The V-2 rocket was one {{of several}} {{innovative}} long-range weapons developed by the Germans after the failure of the Luftwaffe to strike a decisive blow against Britain. It was a revolutionary weapon – the world's first operational SRBM – that had been developed in a secret programme begun in 1936. The German leadership hoped that <b>a</b> <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> rockets unleashed against London would force Britain out of the war. Although Adolf Hitler was at first ambivalent, he eventually became an enthusiastic supporter of the V-2 programme as Allied air forces carried out increasingly devastating attacks on German cities.|$|E

5|$|The {{economic}} {{policies of the}} New Deal leaders were often aligned with ACLU goals, but social goals were not. In particular, movies were subject to <b>a</b> <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> local ordinances banning screenings that were deemed immoral or obscene. Even public health films portraying pregnancy and birth were banned; as was Life magazine's April 11, 1938 issue which included photos of the birth process. The ACLU fought these bans, but did not prevail.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the Spartan counter-attack against the Epiriotes filling the trench, Pyrrhus decided to personally lead a charge against the Spartan lines. Mounted on his horse, the Epiriote King was able to force his away through the trench, over the wagons and into the city {{with a group of}} his companions. The sudden onslaught of Pyrrhus sparked panic amongst the defenders of this section. At this point Pyrrhus' horse was wounded by a javelin which pierced its belly causing it to throw the King to the ground. The fall of the King threw his companions into a state of confusion and enabled the Spartans to rally. The Spartans launched <b>a</b> <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> missiles at the King's comrades, felling many of them. Despite the deaths of many of his guards, Pyrrhus was successfully taken to the safety of the main Epiriote lines.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{played a}} vital role in the side's success in the Test series, {{particularly}} with the ball. Despite a back injury which meant he passed one Test without bowling, he took 13 wickets in the series at an average of 26.28, and also contributed 184 runs at an average of 23.15. He {{played a key role in}} subduing England's leading batsmen, Len Hutton and Denis Compton, with <b>a</b> <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> short-pitched bowling, troubling Hutton to such an extent that he was dropped for the Third Test. In all first-class matches on the tour, Miller scored 1,088 runs at 47.30 and took 56 wickets at 17.58. Bradman gave him a light bowling workload during the tour matches, to keep him fresh for the Test matches.|$|E

Home plate umpire Brian Runge reportedly told Bradley that Winters {{said that he}} had tossed his bat in Runge's direction in a previous at-bat. After Bradley reached first base, he questioned Winters about the alleged bat throwing and subsequent communication with Runge. According to Bradley and Padres first base coach Bobby Meacham, Winters addressed Bradley with <b>a</b> <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> profanity. Bradley then moved towards Winters. While restrained by Black, Bradley fell to the ground and injured himself. He missed the final week of the regular season in 2007, during which the Padres lost to the Colorado Rockies in a one game playoff for the National League wild card on October 1.|$|E
5|$|The Maratha cannonade {{intensified}} as the British redeployed. Although British artillery {{was brought}} forward to counter, it was ineffective against the mass firepower of the Maratha guns and quickly disabled through {{the weight of}} shot directed against it. British casualties mounted as the Maratha guns {{turned their attention to}} the infantry and subjected them to <b>a</b> <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> canister, grape and round shot. Wellesley decided that his only option to neutralise the artillery and get his men out of the killing field was to advance directly into the mouth of the Maratha artillery. He ordered his cannon to be abandoned and gave the command for his infantry to march forward with bayonets fixed.|$|E
5|$|The first clash {{occurred}} at Awala on 23 July, when a platoon from 'B' Company, {{under the command}} of Captain Sam Templeton, having destroyed the footbridge over the Kumusi River, engaged the Japanese {{on the far side of}} the river. The Australians were forced to withdraw, however, when hundreds of Japanese marines began crossing the river under <b>a</b> <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> mortar and machine gun fire. They withdrew only a few miles, before Templeton set up a successful ambush for the advancing Japanese on the banks of the Gorari Creek. Nevertheless, they were forced back further towards the high ground at Oivi where they attempted to make a stand while Templeton tried to make contact with battalion headquarters and the rest of the battalion who were spread out further along the track, in order to get more reinforcements.|$|E

5|$|Throughout 8 April, the Australians were {{subjected}} to heavy shellfire from German forces. At approximately 22:00, the Germans launched a fierce counter-attack {{under the cover of}} <b>a</b> <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> bombs and trench mortars against A Company's position at the mill. They had some initial success and entered the forward posts of the mill, which were occupied by a platoon of Newland's men under the command of Sergeant John Whittle. Newland, bringing up a platoon from the battalion's reserve company, charged the attackers and re-established the lost ground with Whittle's assistance. The 12th Battalion was relieved by the 11th Battalion on 10 April, having succeeded in capturing Boursies at the cost of 240 casualties, of which 70 were killed or missing.|$|E
5|$|When the {{restoration}} of the Sistine Chapel was announced, it sparked <b>a</b> <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> queries and objections from art historians around the world. One of the most vocal of these critics was James Beck, of ArtWatch International, who issued repeated warnings about the possibility of damage to Michelangelo's work from over-strenuous restoration. An argument that was used repeatedly was that all the previous interventions had caused damage of one sort or another. Any restoration, as opposed to conservation, puts an artwork at risk. Conservation, on the other hand, aids in the preservation of the work in its present state and in prevention of further deterioration. Beck has written about his concerns in Art Restoration, the Culture, the Business and the Scandal.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} a favourable omen {{during the night}} Pyrrhus renewed his assault. An effect of the shortage of warriors was that the Spartan women were active in providing the defenders with missiles and refreshments as well as taking away the wounded. In an attempt to nullify the Spartans' advantage, the Epiriotes tried to fill up with trench with debris and bodies but were prevented from doing so by the Sparta. Responding to this Spartan counter-attack, Pyrrhus personally led a charge against the Spartan lines and succeeded in entering the city, spreading panic amongst the defenders. However, at this point his horse threw him after it was wounded by a javelin in the belly. Pyrrhus' fall threw his companions {{into a state of}} dismay, permitting the Spartans to rally and they managed to slay many of the companions in <b>a</b> <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> missiles. Despite this, Pyrrhus was taken safely back to his camp.|$|E

5|$|The Drakengard games {{feature a}} mix of action-based hack-and-slash combat during {{ground-based}} battles and aerial combat mixed in with RPG leveling mechanics. In the original, the player guides the characters around ground-based battles to combat small groups of enemy units. In aerial combat, the player takes control of the protagonist's dragon partner. In these situations, the dragon can either lock onto a target and unleash <b>a</b> <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> small fireballs, or the player can manually aim and fire large bursts of flame, which do more damage but do not home in on a target. Basic gameplay changed little for Drakengard 2, {{but there are some}} differences and additions, such as weapon types being tied to the character they are associated with, with changing them also swapping the character. The dragon gameplay remained virtually unchanged, apart from the ability, during air-ground missions, for the dragon to swoop down on a group of enemies in a special attack depicted in a short cutscene.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. first fired unitary (C-model) Tomahawks at the Khost camps, {{aiming to}} attract militants into the open, then {{launched}} <b>a</b> <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> D-model missiles equipped with submunitions to maximize casualties. Sources differ on the precise {{number of casualties}} inflicted by the missile strikes. Bin Laden bodyguard Abu Jandal and militant trainee Abdul Rahman Khadr later estimated that only six men {{had been killed in}} the strikes. The Taliban claimed 22 Afghans killed and over 50 seriously injured, while Berger put al-Qaeda casualties at between 20 and 30 men. Bin Laden jokingly told militants that only a few camels and chickens had died, although his spokesman cited losses of six Arabs killed and five wounded, seven Pakistanis killed and over 15 wounded, and 15 Afghans killed. A declassified September 9, 1998, State Department cable stated that around 20 Pakistanis and 15 Arabs died, {{out of a total of}} over 50 killed in the attack. Harkat-ul-Mujahideen's leader, Fazlur Rehman Khalil, initially claimed a death toll of over 50 militants, but later said that he had lost fewer than ten fighters.|$|E

5|$|The panzergrenadier {{division}} Großdeutschland, {{commanded by}} Walter Hörnlein, {{was the strongest}} single division in the 4th Panzer Army. It was supported on its flanks by the 3rd and 11th Panzer Divisions. Großdeutschland's Panzer IIIs and IVs had been supplemented by a company of 15 Tigers, which were used to spearhead the attack. At dawn on 5 July, Großdeutschland, backed by heavy artillery support, advanced on a three-kilometre front upon the 67th Guards Rifle Division of the 22nd Guards Rifle Corps. The Panzerfüsilier Regiment, advancing on the left wing, stalled in a minefield and subsequently 36 Panthers were immobilized. The stranded regiment was subjected to <b>a</b> <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> Soviet anti-tank and artillery fire, which inflicted numerous casualties. Engineers were moved up and cleared paths through the minefield, but suffered casualties in the process. The combination of fierce resistance, minefields, thick mud and mechanical breakdowns took its toll. With paths cleared, the regiment resumed its advance towards Gertsovka. In the ensuing battle, heavy casualties were sustained including the regimental commander Colonel Kassnitz. Due to the fighting, and the marshy terrain south of the village, surrounding the Berezovyy stream, the regiment once more bogged down.|$|E
5|$|Where {{the late}} army {{appears to have}} evolved to some extent is in battle tactics. The older army of the Principate had relied on <b>a</b> <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> heavy {{javelins}} (pila) followed by an infantry charge, which was often sufficient to shatter, or at least disorganise, the barbarian line. After that, legionaries were trained to engage in aggressive hand-to-hand combat, using the gladius short-sword to execute quick thrusts at the abdomen of their enemies, {{in a similar manner}} to more recent bayonet drill. In close combat, the Romans had the crucial advantage of superior armour, and such tactics very often resulted in the rout of the less well-equipped and trained barbarian foe. The mounted archers and slingers in front of the main infantry line would loose their missiles on the enemy before the infantry lines engaged and would then hastily retreat to the rear of their own infantry line, whence, in conjunction with the foot archers already there, they would loose a continuous rain of missiles on the enemy foot by shooting over the heads of their own infantry. The cavalry's task on each wing was to scatter the enemy cavalry facing them and then, if possible, to encircle the main body of enemy infantry and attack them from the flanks and rear.|$|E
5|$|Early {{on during}} the 2010–11 season, Evra was {{hampered}} by constant inquiries about {{what happened at the}} 2010 FIFA World Cup from the French Football Federation (FFF), the French media, as well as the French government. Evra's contract with Manchester United was also {{up at the end of}} the 2011–12 season, which led to the player being linked with a move to Real Madrid. Evra's hearing with the FFF in Paris, which he attended, was held the day after the team's opening 3–0 league win over Newcastle United. Evra played over 85 minutes in the match. On 20 November, Evra scored his second Premier League goal in a 2–0 win at home against Wigan Athletic. On 21 February 2011, after weeks of negotiations, Evra signed a contract extension with Manchester United that would keep him with the club until at least the end of the 2013–14 season. Two days after signing his contract extension, Evra participated in United's 0–0 draw with Marseille in the first leg of the team's first knockout round tie in the Champions League. The match, played at the Stade Vélodrome in Marseille, was Evra's first match played in France since the 2010 World Cup debacle. As a consequence, he was subjected to <b>a</b> <b>barrage</b> <b>of</b> jeers and boos every time he touched the ball.|$|E
