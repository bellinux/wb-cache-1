5|$|The {{effects of}} {{injuries}} {{at or above}} the lumbar or sacral regions of the spinal cord (lower back and pelvis) include decreased control of the legs <b>and</b> <b>hips,</b> genitourinary system, and anus. People injured below level L2 may still have use of their hip flexor and knee extensor muscles. Bowel and bladder function are regulated by the sacral region. It is common to experience sexual dysfunction after injury, as well as dysfunction of the bowel and bladder, including fecal and urinary incontinence. It is also possible for the bladder to fail to empty, leading to a potentially harmful buildup of urine. One sign of spinal cord injury that emergency providers may find is priapism, an erection of the penis.|$|E

40|$|The huntingtin-interacting protein {{family members}} (<b>Hip</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Hip</b> 1 R in mammals and Sla 2 p in yeast) link clathrin-mediated {{membrane}} traffic to actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Genetic data in yeast have implicated the light chain subunit of clathrin in regulating this link. To test this hypothesis, the biophysical properties of mammalian <b>Hip</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Hip</b> 1 R <b>and</b> their interaction with clathrin light chain and actin were analyzed. The coiled-coil domains (clathrin light chain-binding) of <b>Hip</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Hip</b> 1 R {{were found to}} be stable homodimers with no propensity to heterodimerize in vitro. Homodimers were also predominant in vivo, accounting for cellular segregation of <b>Hip</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Hip</b> 1 R functions. Coiled-coil domains of <b>Hip</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Hip</b> 1 R differed in their stability and flexibility, correlating with slightly different affinities for clathrin light chain and more markedly with effects of clathrin light chain binding on Hip protein-actin interactions. Clathrin light chain binding induced a compact conformation of both <b>Hip</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Hip</b> 1 R <b>and</b> significantly reduced actin binding by their THATCH domains. Thus, clathrin is a negative regulator of Hip-actin interactions. These observations necessarily change models proposed for Hip protein function...|$|R
5|$|Where the two chough species occur together, {{there is}} only limited {{competition}} for food. An Italian study showed that the vegetable part of the winter diet for the red-billed chough was almost exclusively Gagea bulbs, whilst the Alpine chough took berries <b>and</b> <b>hips.</b> In June, red-billed choughs fed on Lepidoptera larvae whereas Alpine choughs ate cranefly pupae. Later in the summer, the Alpine chough mainly consumed grasshoppers, whilst the red-billed chough added cranefly pupae, fly larvae and beetles to its diet. Both choughs will hide food in cracks and fissures, concealing the cache with a few pebbles.|$|E

5|$|By the 1960s, the bikini {{swimsuit}} influenced panty {{styles and}} {{coincided with the}} cut of the new lower rise jeans and pants. In the seventies, {{with the emergence of}} skintight jeans, thong versions of the panty became mainstream, since the open, stringed back eliminated any tell-tale panty lines across the rear <b>and</b> <b>hips.</b> By the 1980s the design of the French-cut panty pushed the waistband back up to the natural waistline {{and the rise of the}} leg openings was nearly as high (French Cut panties come up to the waist, has a high cut leg, and usually are full in the rear). As with the bra and other type of lingerie, manufacturers of the last quarter of the century marketed panty styles that were designed primarily for their sexual allure. From this decade sexualization and eroticization of the male body was on the rise. The male body was celebrated through advertising campaigns for brands such as Calvin Klein, particularly by photographers Bruce Weber and Herb Ritts. Male bodies and men's undergarments were commodified and packaged for mass consumption, and swimwear and sportswear were influenced by sports photography and fitness. Over time, swimwear evolved from weighty wool to high-tech skin-tight garments, eventually cross-breeding with sportswear, underwear and exercise wear, resulting in the interchangeable fashions of the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|He {{concluded}} that the caudofemoralis muscles which link the tail bones and the upper leg bones could have assisted Tyrannosaurus in leg retraction and enhanced its running ability, agility and balance. The caudofemoralis muscle {{would have been a}} key muscle in femoral retraction; pulling back the leg at the femur. The study also found that theropod skeletons such as those of Tyrannosaurus had adaptations (such as elevated transverse processes in the tail vertebrae) to enable the growth of larger tail muscles and that Tyrannosaurus's tail muscle mass may have been underestimated by over 25 percent and perhaps as much as 45 percent. The caudofemoralis muscle was found to comprise 58 percent of the muscle mass in the tail of Tyrannosaurus. Tyrannosaurus also had the largest absolute and relative caudofemoralis muscle mass out of the three extinct organisms in the study. This is because Tyrannosaurus also had additional adaptations to enable large tail muscles; the elongation of its tail's hemal arches. According to Persons, the increase in tail muscle mass would have moved the center of mass closer to the hindquarters <b>and</b> <b>hips</b> which would have lessened the strain on the leg muscles to support its weight; improving its overall balance and agility. This would also have made the animal less front-heavy, thus reducing rotational inertia. Persons also notes that the tail is also rich in tendons and septa which could have been stores of elastic energy, and thereby improved locomotive efficiency. Persons adds that this means non-avian theropods actually had broader tails than previously depicted, as broad or broader laterally than dorsoventrally near the base.|$|E
5|$|The nesting {{specimen}} MPC-D 107/15 {{has provided}} much {{information about the}} taphonomic processes (changes during fossilisation) in the Baruungoyot Formation. The specimen is preserved in facies that {{are thought to have}} been deposited through a sandstorm or dune-shift. It {{does not seem to have}} been transported after death, but the body appears to have shifted slightly to the right, indicating the sediment in which it was deposited came towards it from its left side. The neck is curved to the left, the left hand is folded backwards, and the legs are folded into a crouching position. The vertebral column, neck, <b>and</b> <b>hips</b> deteriorated during burial, and much of the damage to the skeleton is thought to have been caused by the activity of invertebrates. Borings in the bones, burrows, and reworked sediments (perhaps caused by the construction of pupal chambers) in the specimen indicate it was scavenged upon by colonies of skin beetles (Dermestidae) and perhaps other scavenging insects. There are many feeding traces in the joints of the skeleton, and almost all the surfaces where the bones articulated have been obliterated. There are also tunnels in the nest under the neck and skull, and no egg remains have been found in parts with such traces. Modern skin beetles mainly feed on muscle tissue but not on moist materials, and their activity is prevented by rapid burial. It is therefore thought that specimen MPC-D107/15 was only partially buried at first, with the upper part being exposed enough for a colony of skin beetles to develop. Some damage to the skeleton (especially in the vertebral column) may also have been caused by the scavenging of small mammals.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the reliability and}} validity of a 3 -dimensional laser body scanner for estimation of waist <b>and</b> <b>hip</b> circumferences <b>and</b> waist:hip ratio. Methods: Seventy women were evaluated for waist <b>and</b> <b>hip</b> circumference <b>and</b> waist:hip ratio via laser scanner and tape measure. In a subset of 34 participants, 8 repeated measures of laser scanning were performed for reproducibility analysis. Validity of the instrument was assessed by regression and Bland-Altman comparison of measures of waist <b>and</b> <b>hip</b> circumferences <b>and</b> waist:hip ratio to tape measure. Results: Reproducibility analysis showed little difference between within-subjects measurements of circumferences (intraclass correlation coefficient$ 0. 992, p, 0. 01). Evaluation of waist <b>and</b> <b>hip</b> circumferences measured by body scanning did not differ significantly from tape measure (p. 0. 05). Bland-Altman analysis showed no bias between laser scanning and tape measure. Conclusion: These findings indicate that the 3 -dimensional laser body scanner is a reliable and valid technique for the estimation of waist <b>and</b> <b>hip</b> circumferences as compared with tape measure. This instrument is promising as a quick and simple method of body circumference analysis...|$|R

40|$|Studies {{describing}} the movement patterns, relative contributions and kinematic {{characteristics of the}} lumbar spine <b>and</b> <b>hip</b> present conflicting results.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to describe the amount and pattern of lumbar spine <b>and</b> <b>hip</b> movement during flexion and return using a range of kinematic and temporal variables. Our aim is to gain a more complete picture of movement patterns taking place at the <b>hip</b> <b>and</b> lumbar spine in asymptomatic individuals. Ultimately the development of a normative database of movement patterns will help to clarify comparative movement interpretation in patients with lumbar back pain. This study analysed lumbar spine <b>and</b> <b>hip</b> motion in group of young healthy males (n =  20) during the flexion and return movement. A motion analysis system captured continuous movement profiles in the sagittal plane. Each participant performed five trials of flexion and return. The angular and velocity data were averaged and used for statistical and descriptive analysis. The kinematic and temporal variables distinguishing statistically significant differences in the lumbar spine <b>and</b> <b>hip</b> movement patterns are not the same for the flexion and return movement. However, within this group four (20 %) demonstrated a pattern angular change between the lumbar spine <b>and</b> <b>hip</b> which was different from the other participants.
