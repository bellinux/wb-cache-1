5|$|Prisoners {{would often}} take their {{families}} with them, {{which meant that}} entire communities sprang up inside the debtors' jails. The community created its own economy, with jailers charging for room, food, drink and furniture, or selling concessions to others, <b>and</b> <b>attorneys</b> charging fees in fruitless efforts to get the debtors out. Prisoners' families, including children, often had to find employment simply {{to cover the cost}} of the imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|Comair {{discovered}} {{after the}} accident that all of its pilots had been using an airport map that did not accurately reflect changes made to the airport layout during ongoing construction work. The NTSB later determined that this did {{not contribute to the}} accident. Construction work was halted {{after the accident}} on the orders of Fayette Circuit Judge Pamela Goodwine in order to preserve evidence in the crash pending the inspection by safety experts <b>and</b> <b>attorneys</b> for the families of the victims.|$|E
5|$|The {{tour was}} a {{commercial}} success, grossing over $156 million, being seen by over 1.7 million ticket holders, and finishing as the third-highest grossing {{tour in the}} world for 2009 even though the tour faced some logistical issues. Ticket sales were botched by Ticketmaster, a situation further exacerbated by revelations of their holding seats back for their secondary market TicketsNow. Before long, legislatures <b>and</b> <b>attorneys</b> general of several states, as well as members of the U.S. Congress and federal regulatory agencies, were weighing in on the matter, with various lawsuits, settlements, and proposed laws as the result.|$|E
50|$|When a Governor <b>and</b> <b>Attorney</b> General are of {{the same}} party, the {{relationship}} often becomes more collegial. However, when the Governor <b>and</b> <b>Attorney</b> General are of different parties, the relation can become somewhat adversarial. This was demonstrated when, in 2001, Governor Keating <b>and</b> <b>Attorney</b> General Edmondson were the plaintiff and defendant in the Oklahoma Supreme Court case Keating v. Edmondson.|$|R

5|$|For {{legal system}} reform, the Commission {{suggested}} {{the creation of}} county courts led by the Westminster judges with jurisdiction over civil actions, and small claims courts for amounts under £4 to be manned by commissioners, approved by Justices of the Peace. They also supported {{the creation of a}} Court of Appeal consisting of laymen chosen by Parliament, the formation of a land registry and a permanent law commission. Against Hale's wishes, the Commission called for the abolition of benefit of clergy, and the acquittal of those charged with justified homicide. The Commission also suggested that debtors should no longer be imprisoned, <b>and</b> <b>attorneys</b> should be educated at an Inn of Court and not allowed to practise until they were admitted as members.|$|E
5|$|In 1809, Sharp {{was elected}} to {{represent}} Warren County in the Kentucky House of Representatives. During his tenure, he supported the legislature's election of Henry Clay to the U.S. Senate, {{the creation of a}} state lottery, and the creation of an academy in Barren County. He served on a number of committees, and for a time, served as interim speaker of the house during the General Assembly's second session. He was re-elected in 1810 and 1811. By 1810, the county had nearly 12,000 residents. During the 1811 session, Sharp worked with Ben Hardin to secure passage of a bill to ensure that state officers <b>and</b> <b>attorneys</b> at law would not be involved in dueling. He also opposed a measure allowing harsher treatment of slaves.|$|E
5|$|Pierce {{sought to}} run a more {{efficient}} and accountable government than his predecessors. His Cabinet members implemented an early system of civil service examinations which was a forerunner to the Pendleton Act passed three decades later. The Interior Department was reformed by Secretary Robert McClelland, who systematized its operations, expanded the use of paper records, and pursued fraud. Another of Pierce's reforms was to expand {{the role of the}} U.S. attorney general in appointing federal judges <b>and</b> <b>attorneys,</b> which was an important step in the eventual development of the Justice Department. There was a vacancy on the Supreme Court—Fillmore, having failed to get Senate confirmation for his nominees, had offered it to newly elected Louisiana Senator Judah P. Benjamin, who had declined. Pierce also offered the seat to Benjamin, and when the Louisianan persisted in his refusal, nominated instead John Archibald Campbell, an advocate of states' rights; this would be Pierce's only Supreme Court appointment.|$|E

25|$|Social workers <b>and</b> <b>attorneys</b> {{involved}} in anti-sex trafficking have negative opinions about raids.

Law enforcement also often use interrogation methods that intimidate rather than assist potential trafficking victims. Additionally, sex workers sometimes face violence from the police during raids and arrests and in rehabilitation centers.|$|E

25|$|The first {{elections}} for mayors, treasurers <b>and</b> <b>attorneys</b> of the country's 110 municipalities for a one-year-term {{took place on}} 16 June 1900, but balloting was limited to literate Cubans older than 21 and with properties worth more than $250. Only members of the dissolved Liberation Army were exempt from these conditions. Thus, the number of about 418,000 male citizens over 21 was reduced to about 151,000. 360,000 women were totally excluded. The same elections were held one year later, again for a one-year-term.|$|E

25|$|Membership in the {{legislature}} is best regarded as being a full-time job during the session and a part-time job {{the rest of the}} year due to committee meetings and hearings (for which legislators are reimbursed their expenses and receive a mileage allowance). A few members are on enough committees to make something of a living from being legislators; most are independent businesspeople <b>and</b> <b>attorneys,</b> although the latter group is perhaps no longer the absolute majority of members that it at one time comprised. In keeping with Tennessee's agricultural roots, some senators and representatives are farmers.|$|E
