He {{worked closely with the}} Biological Sciences Curriculum Study to develop high school curricula based on evolution as the central unifying principle in biology. He also opposed scientific creationism groups. Stebbins was active in numerous science organizationsincluding the International Union of Biological Sciences, the Western Society of Naturalists, the Botanical Society of America, and the Society for the Study of Evolutionand served as President of the American Society of Naturalists. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1952. Stebbins received numerous awards for his contributions to science: the National Medal of Science, the Gold Medal from the Linnean Society of London, the Addison Emery Verrill Medal from the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History, and the John Frederick Lewis Award from the American Philosophical Society. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1952. He was awarded the 1983 Leidy Award from the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.|$|E

25|$|The {{writing and}} {{recording}} sessions for Siren Song of the Counter Culture were marred by numerous distractions and inconveniences. In November 2003, Dreamworks {{was acquired by}} Universal Music Group for US$100 million, and eventually folded into Geffen Records. The transition period between labels left Rise Against without an A representative, and little acknowledgement from Geffen executives. Guitarist Todd Mohney left the band during the writing sessions, was replaced by Chris Chasse of Reach the Sky. McIlrath noted that the band was nervous <b>about</b> <b>teaching</b> Chasse completely new songs in a short period. Meanwhile, McIlrath was experiencing more personal distractions. Some Rise Against fans accused the band of selling out after signing with Dreamworks. Although McIlrath felt {{that most of the}} fans would realize that the band had not changed upon hearing the album, it still bothered him knowing that some longtime fans now hated the band for switching labels. Additionally, McIlrath's wife, who was seven months pregnant, went into labor {{while he was in the}} vocal booth. The band temporarily moved recording sessions from Vancouver to Chicago so that McIlrath could be with his wife.|$|E

500|$|In general, {{the world}} of these early volumes is a [...] " [...] and ... divided place." [...] In these early titles, the boys are cynical about human nature, an {{attitude}} apparently justified when the police, whom they have repeatedly helped, throw them into jail on slim evidence in The Great Airport Mystery (1930). The police and authority figures in general come off poorly in these books, {{so much so that}} at one point Edward Stratemeyer wrote McFarlane to reprimand him for [...] "grievous lack of respect for officers of the law." [...] The Hardys are less affluent than earlier Stratemeyer characters; they eagerly accept cash rewards largely to finance college educations, and, with their parents, strive to please their Aunt Gertrude, because she possesses a small fortune. The rich are portrayed as greedy and selfish. This view of the world reflects McFarlane's relative [...] "lack [...] sympathy with the American power structure." [...] In his autobiography, McFarlane described his rationale for writing the books this way, writing: [...] "I had my own thoughts <b>about</b> <b>teaching</b> youngsters that obedience to authority is somehow sacred.... Would civilization crumble if kids got the notion that the people who ran the world were sometimes stupid, occasionally wrong and even corrupt at times?" ...|$|E
500|$|Magnus [...] "adores her {{daughter}} Ashley, respecting her independence and self-reliance – but that doesn't preclude some occasional mother-daughter friction". Tapping {{has said that}} there is a [...] "huge amount of respect" [...] between the two characters, adding [...] "Ashley knows that when her mother says she needs to do something then she says it for a reason. And Magnus has a huge amount of respect for Ashley because Ashley can do things that she can't." [...] Magnus made a hard choice of having Ashley even though she does not have her mother's longevity, and Magnus would outlive {{her daughter}}. In the first season Magnus recruits Will as her protégé. When asked what Magnus thinks of Will, Tapping stated [...] "I think Helen finds him fascinating. He's so idealistic, she sees in him all the qualities that she admires, but all the qualities that she knows will probably get beaten out of him over the course of time. His idealism and purity of thought and the way he analyses things... she absolutely respects that, but I think she also realises that there's going to come a time when he's going to become a bit jaded... There are a couple of episodes where there's been this bizarre sexual tension between the two of them... but generally there's just a huge healthy respect." [...] During a Blastr interview in 2011, Tapping further explains Magnus' relationship with Will; [...] "I love how this relationship has developed. [...] "It's been a really organic transformation of Will's character and Magnus. To actually bring somebody on board who, initially, it's all <b>about</b> <b>teaching</b> him the ropes. And then as the seasons have gone on he's come into his own. He's come into his own as a scientist. He's come into his own in terms of his relationship with the people in the Sanctuary." [...] Dunne meanwhile stated [...] "there's a nice synchronicity that has formed between the two characters. And really, they're two people that depend on each other for survival. And therefore, that's where the respect comes out of." ...|$|E

40|$|Teachers play {{different}} roles in multidimensional process of language teaching and their beliefs <b>about</b> language <b>teaching</b> might influence their practices. Donaghue (2003) stated that beliefs guide {{teachers in their}} practice. However, Argyris and Schon (1978) claimed that there is almost a discrepancy between teachers’ beliefs <b>about</b> language <b>teaching</b> and their practices in the classrooms. Therefore, {{the present study investigated}} the relationship between Iranian ELT instructors’ beliefs <b>about</b> language <b>teaching</b> and their real practices in classrooms. To achieve this goal, the researchers accidentally selected 369 Iranian ELT instructors and 512 Iranian students. To collect the required data, the researchers employed Teacher’s Beliefs Questionnaire (TBQ) to elicit instructors’ beliefs <b>about</b> language <b>teaching</b> and Students’ Satisfaction Questionnaire (SSQ) to elicit to what extent Iranian instructors applied their beliefs in their practices. Besides, to verify the results of questionnaires, the researchers interviewed nine instructors. The results revealed a positive significant relationship (p? 0. 05) between instructors’ beliefs <b>about</b> language <b>teaching</b> and their real practices in classrooms. The findings proposed some applicable implications that can be applied by policy makers and curriculum designers to provide facilities to support reflective teaching and to improve teacher education programs. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} English teachers’ beliefs <b>about</b> grammar <b>teaching</b> and the {{influence}} of such beliefs on their actual classroom practices have been subjected to many discussions and empirical research in second language education. This paper reports on a study which investigated the beliefs of in-service English teachers <b>about</b> grammar <b>teaching</b> and actual classroom practices at primary schools in Selangor, Malaysia. Questionnaires were distributed to 50 English teachers to determine teacher’s beliefs towards grammar teaching and to investigate their teaching procedures in the English classroom. Furthermore, four teachers were interviewed and observed; the interviews explored the teachers’ beliefs of grammar teaching and classroom practices, while the non-participatory observations provided insights into how they teach grammar in the classrooms and examine whether the teachers’ beliefs <b>about</b> grammar <b>teaching</b> are aligned with their actual classroom practices. Findings revealed the Malaysia primary schools in Selangor English teachers do have a set of beliefs <b>about</b> grammar <b>teaching</b> and generally those participants’ beliefs <b>about</b> grammar <b>teaching</b> were matched with their actual classroom practices. However, the findings also found a small number of discrepancies observed from some participants mostly due to pupils’ level of English proficiency and contextual constraints such as time constraints.

The problem is, if you are not going to be dogmatic in Darwinism that means you inevitably have to point out a fault or at least an alternative to Darwinism. So far, the only plausible theory is ID. If one is to challenge Darwin, then one must use ID. To challenge Darwin is to challenge natural selection/spontaneous first cause...which is what the Kansas board is attempting to do. When you do that, you have to invoke the idea of ID." ...|$|E
