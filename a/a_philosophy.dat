5|$|Anarchism {{does not}} offer a fixed body of {{doctrine}} from a single particular world view, instead fluxing and flowing as <b>a</b> <b>philosophy.</b> Many types and traditions of anarchism exist, not {{all of which are}} mutually exclusive. Anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism. Strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of social and individualist anarchism or similar dual classifications.|$|E

5|$|Both of Wollstonecraft's novels also {{critique}} {{the discourse}} of sensibility, a moral philosophy and aesthetic that had become popular {{at the end of}} the eighteenth century. Mary is itself a novel of sensibility and Wollstonecraft attempts to use the tropes of that genre to undermine sentimentalism itself, <b>a</b> <b>philosophy</b> she believed was damaging to women because it encouraged them to rely overmuch on their emotions. In The Wrongs of Woman the heroine's indulgence on romantic fantasies fostered by novels themselves is depicted as particularly detrimental.|$|E

5|$|Macdonald was {{considered}} one of his province's most eloquent political orators. He articulated <b>a</b> <b>philosophy</b> of provincial autonomy, arguing that poorer provinces needed a greater share of national tax revenues to pay for health, education and welfare. He contended that Nova Scotians were victims of a national policy that protected the industries of Ontario and Quebec with steep tariffs forcing people to pay higher prices for manufactured goods. It was no accident, Macdonald said, that Nova Scotia had gone from the richest province per capita before Canadian Confederation in 1867 to poorest by the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|Other thinkers have {{emphasised}} {{the pursuit}} of power as a virtue. Some philosophies {{are rooted in the}} love of power because philosophies tend to be coherent unification in {{the pursuit of}} some goal or desire. Just as <b>a</b> <b>philosophy</b> may strive for truth, it may also strive for happiness, virtue, salvation, or, finally, power. Among those philosophies which Russell condemns as rooted in love of power: all forms of idealism and anti-realism, such as Johann Gottlieb Fichte's solipsism; certain forms of Pragmatism; Henri Bergson's doctrine of Creative evolution; and the works of Friedrich Nietzsche (Russell 1938:209–214).|$|E

By studying the natural world, he argued, people would learn how to become more compassionate, happy, and prosperous.|$|E

40|$|A process-information {{approach}} is examined {{as a foundation}} for <b>an</b> environmental <b>philosophy</b> that is dynamic and elastic, with particular emphasis on value, beauty, integrity and stability supporting Aldo Leopold's vision. I challenge one of the basic assumptions of Western philosophy, namely the metaphysical primacy of substance. The classical, medieval and modern metaphysics of substance is presented with particular attention given the paradoxes of substance. Starting from the philosophy of Heraclitus, relatively ignored by the Western tradition of <b>philosophy,</b> <b>a</b> process <b>philosophy</b> is developed as an alternative to standard metaphysical attitudes in <b>philosophy.</b> <b>A</b> possible resolution of Zeno's paradoxes leads to consideration of other paradoxes of substance metaphysics. It is argued that substance metaphysics is incompatible with evidence found in the shifting paradigms of ecology and general science. Process philosophy is explored as a basis for <b>an</b> environmental <b>philosophy,</b> attempting to put the environment back into philosophy...|$|R
5|$|The {{attitude}} of the United States was also influenced by the Monroe Doctrine, <b>a</b> <b>philosophy</b> of foreign policy articulated by James Monroe in 1823, and which justified the maintenance of US hegemony in the region. The stated aim of the doctrine was to maintain order and stability and {{to make certain that}} access to resources and markets was not limited. The historian Mark Gilderhus states that the doctrine also contained racially condescending language, which likened Latin American countries to fighting children. The US government did not need to engage in military interventions in Guatemala to enforce this hegemony, given the presence of military rulers friendly to the US; nevertheless, the doctrine was used to justify the coup in 1954.|$|E
5|$|Time and Eternity - An Essay on the Philosophy of Religion (1st imp.

5|$|During the High Middle Ages, {{which began}} after 1000, the {{population}} of Europe increased greatly as technological and agricultural innovations allowed trade to flourish and the Medieval Warm Period climate change allowed crop yields to increase. Manorialism, the organisation of peasants into villages that owed rent and labour services to the nobles, and feudalism, the political structure whereby knights and lower-status nobles owed military service to their overlords {{in return for the}} right to rent from lands and manors, were two of the ways society was organised in the High Middle Ages. The Crusades, first preached in 1095, were military attempts by Western European Christians to regain control of the Holy Land from Muslims. Kings became the heads of centralised nation states, reducing crime and violence but making the ideal of a unified Christendom more distant. Intellectual life was marked by scholasticism, <b>a</b> <b>philosophy</b> that emphasised joining faith to reason, and by the founding of universities. The theology of Thomas Aquinas, the paintings of Giotto, the poetry of Dante and Chaucer, the travels of Marco Polo, and the Gothic architecture of cathedrals such as Chartres are among the outstanding achievements toward the end of this period and into the Late Middle Ages.|$|E

He sneaks into a Halloween party at HCC, Gilly kisses Jessica Harris (Jennifer Biddall) and assumes the role of her wannabe boyfriend. This leads to him pretending to be <b>a</b> <b>philosophy</b> student just {{to get close to}} her and finds a rival in Mark Jury (Asier Newman), Jessica's real boyfriend. The two battled for {{affections}} but Jessica could not decide between them and ended both relationships. Neville (Jim Millea) buys Drive 'n' Buy and Gilly becomes an employee, mainly so he can become close to Sarah Barnes (Loui Batley). The pair start going on dates, however, Sarah loses interest. Any chance of a relationship ends when Gilly reveals Rhys slept with her mother, Kathy Barnes (Sarah Jane Buckley). Rhys becomes jealous over Gilly and Sarah and kicks him out of the home.

After Gilly defends Zak after he is accused of stealing Zoë's belongings, he and Rhys renew their friendship and he moves back into the Ashworths'. Gilly finds out Rhys is an escort and decides to be one himself, unaware the job involves nothing sexual.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} was {{refined and}} expanded from the version they used in Awakening. The My Castle feature was suggested by Maeda {{as an alternative}} activity for players, {{and to provide a}} means for getting to know the main characters outside battle. The amount of content included in the feature made some staff comment that it could be its own game. The social elements of My Castle were originally going to be exclusive to StreetPass, but it was suggested that players in areas with low StreetPass activity should be able to access the functions through a normal Internet connection. Some ideas thought up by Maeda for earlier titles, such as the Dragon Vein ability and the way skills were inherited by second generation characters, were also implemented. Due to the necessity for multiple versions, map designing became a larger task than anticipated, with very few maps being shared between versions. The Phoenix Mode was included to bring new fans into the series, <b>a</b> <b>philosophy</b> that they had neglected up until Awakening and improved for Fates. For {{the first time in the}} Fire Emblem series, the option for the main character to marry a character of the same sex was included: the potential male and female partners respectively appear in Conquest and Birthright, and both appear in Revelation. According to Nintendo, this move was done to reflect the diversity of their player base.|$|E
5|$|The locals saw Meiklejohn as an outsider. He was {{foreign to}} Madison in his politics, social life, and personality. Dean Sellery and President Frank's {{professional}} relationship was untrusting and contemptuous, which extended to Meiklejohn {{due to his}} close association with Frank.

In objection to the college's reputation for radicalism, the son of the man who endowed Meiklejohn's professorship revoked his funding. Frank needed the donor's support, and so the incident marked Frank's waning support for the college. Sellery spoke out against the Experimental College {{in the first quarter of}} 1929, and Frank attempted to fire him in response. In 1931, Sellery received letters from spies who found Meiklejohn's son Donald, <b>a</b> <b>philosophy</b> doctoral student at the university and a part-time Experimental College adviser, engaged in sex acts against university policy. Sellery pursued expulsion and denied Meiklejohn and his son's separate requests for a lesser punishment. A week later, Meiklejohn asked the advisers to close the college.|$|E
