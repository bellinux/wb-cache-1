40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{determine}} the extent to which one can be prepared for the conducting profession and examines the pursuit of virtuosic conducting. The paper identifies and examines a range of skills essential to the art of conducting, the interconnection of these skills and discusses the role of practical experience in terms of skill development. The paper looks at these aspects in light of demands associated with the conducting profession and investigates aspects of current training for the profession. Different approaches and philosophies concerning conducting training are explored and associated problem areas are identified. This paper supports the belief that these problems can be addressed with suitable training and argues that if conductors were adequately trained they would be more likely to be effective from the first time they work with a professional ensemble. The paper concludes that <b>a</b> <b>virtuosic</b> <b>level</b> of conducting would be a more probable outcome for conductors exposed to thorough training. This paper focuses on conducting skill and technique more than artistic and interpretative issues...|$|R

5000|$|As {{in many of}} White's novels, {{the main}} focus is on identity; White views his subject from masculine-feminine, colonial-English, rural-metropolitan, and bourgeois-bohemian polarities. The writing has been {{described}} as vivid and painterly in its attention to landscape, and remorseless in its critical dissection of social conventions. The novel is <b>a</b> <b>virtuosic</b> display of White's characteristic [...] "wicked" [...] humour.|$|R
50|$|Stravinsky {{designed}} the Capriccio to be <b>a</b> <b>virtuosic</b> vehicle {{which would allow}} him to earn a living from playing the piano part.

5000|$|While {{working on}} the concerto, Dvořák himself {{realized}} that he had not created <b>a</b> <b>virtuosic</b> piece in which the piano does battle with the orchestra. Dvořák wrote: [...] "I see I am unable to write a Concerto for a virtuoso; I must think of other things." [...] What Dvořák composed instead was a symphonic concerto in which the piano plays a leading part in the orchestra, rather than opposed to it.|$|R
5000|$|Overlooked by this {{approach}} were the equally developed written techniques of jazz music. By {{this point in}} time, jazz composition and arranging had {{in its own right}} reached <b>virtuosic</b> <b>levels.</b> Written jazz, {{thanks in large part to}} the popularity of the swing era, established its own traditions within jazz music. One of the first educators to incorporate this aspect of jazz into was Gene Hall, a graduate of University of North Texas. [...] Gene Hall, who had written a master's thesis there in which he outlined a proposed college-level jazz curriculum, became the first faculty member in the new program. Central to Hall's curriculum was an arranging class for which a laboratory ensemble performed student arrangements and compositions. That ensemble became the One O'Clock Lab Band." ...|$|R
