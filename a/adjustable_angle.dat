2500|$|Its {{fuselage}} was slender, with {{a rounded}} cross-section. [...] The [...] water-cooled, double-supercharged, inverted V-12 Delage engine drove a large diameter, two blade propeller. Its radiators {{were in the}} wing. There were two on each side, one inboard and one outboard, both occupying the full chord and forming the wing skin. An open cockpit was placed a little {{in front of the}} trailing edge of the wing, within a narrow dorsal fairing which stretched over half the fuselage, starting close to the nose. The fuselage tapered rearwards to a conventional tail, with a round-tipped triangular tailplane, mounted at mid-fuselage, which had an <b>adjustable</b> <b>angle</b> of incidence. Its vertical tail was tall and slightly rounded and the unbalanced rudder extended down to the keel.|$|E

2500|$|In 1879 Moy {{demonstrated}} his [...] "military kite" [...] to {{a meeting}} of the Royal Aeronautical Society. This was a small model aircraft propelled by a pair of rubber-driven propellers which rotated in opposite directions. This had two lifting surfaces like the Aerial Steamer, but was more like a modern aircraft in that there was a principal lifting surface mounted in front of a second lifting surface of half the span and a quarter of the area. [...] The bow-shaped surfaces were made of cambric, had dihedral and an <b>adjustable</b> <b>angle</b> of incidence and were fixed to on a central pine box-girder, mounted on wheels. Unlike Alphonse Pénaud's Planophore of 1871, which had to be hand-launched, the Military Kite could take off under its own power.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis {{is the second}} phase of development of an open architecture control moment gyroscope (CMG). The focus is on designing an <b>adjustable</b> skew <b>angle</b> single gimbal CMG frame, and integrating a previously developed momentum wheel assembly into it. The result of this phase is a fully operational CMG {{that can be used to}} retrofit the NPS Reconfigurable Satellite Autonomy Testbed (R-SAT). The open architecture design allows for both hardware and software upgrades to the R-SAT Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS). This capability is vitally important in order to support the development and testing of new satellite control algorithms that can be used to improve the agility and efficiency of satellite maneuvers. The CMG developed in this project is capable of delivering 7. 79 Nm of output torque at the standard gimbal rate of 1 rad/s. The CMG power consumption ranges between 50 W and 100 W. 4.

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of the physical characteristics of fertiliser particles {{is essential for the}} constructors and operators of fertiliser distributors. Among physical characteristics, the most important are the frictional and aerodynamic properties for the description of particle movement. <b>Adjustable</b> <b>angled</b> slopes, shearing boxes and various rotating disks are used to identify frictional properties. We have developed a high precision shearing box with digital force measuring cells and a distance signaller (incremental transducer) that we use for slide tests efficiently. We measured the frictional characteristics of 6 different fertilisers: the inner coefficient of friction and the coefficient of friction on ten test surfaces most commonly used in machinery, and we specified the relationship between displacement, loading and the coefficient of friction. We can conclude that the material of the frictional surface significantly influences the force of friction...|$|R

50|$|The M-346 {{incorporates}} a full-authority quadruplex digital fly-by-wire {{flight control system}} which, in combination with the optimized aerodynamic configuration of the aircraft, provides for full manoeuvrability and controllability at very high angle of attack (in excess of 30° degrees).
