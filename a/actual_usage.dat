5|$|Before any {{products}} are sold, the company pre-cooks the ingredients and holds {{them in a}} heated holding cabinet. To ensure that product consistency is maintained and {{to reduce the amount}} of products discarded as waste, Burger King utilizes a computerized monitoring system created by Integrated Control Corp, or ICC. The system, called Kitchen Minder, monitors time and temperature in the cabinets and notifies staff and managers when to prepare more food and discard older products. Initially developed from 1998 to 2000, the system is designed to work with a holding cabinet system that was developed by Duke. The initial test designs were time-consuming to program because each bay in the holding units had to be programmed manually. This meant several minutes were required for each product, which added up to several hours to program up to six units with eight bays each. When BK finally deployed the system in 2001, the updated units utilized a Palm Pilot to configure the units using a custom program designed to easily configure the units via Infrared or serial port. A kitchen flow software system that helps centralize information about the system was deployed in 2007; combined with the new equipment, it helped further reduce costs for the company and its franchises by calculating projected sales and <b>actual</b> <b>usage.</b> Along with the holding system, Burger King deployed newer high-speed toasters to decrease make times; the new toasters, while faster, require more maintenance, which increases overall labor costs.|$|E

25|$|Fractional {{ownership}} divides {{a property}} into more affordable segments {{for individuals and}} also matches an individual's ownership time to their <b>actual</b> <b>usage</b> time. A fractional share gives the owners certain privileges, such {{as a number of}} days or weeks when they can use the property. Occasionally, the property is sold after a predetermined time, distributing the relative proceeds back to the owners. A few private owner-groups have developed highly sophisticated usage allocation schemes and other features based on the principle of attempting to get {{as close as possible to}} the flexibility of individual ownership, and only compromising this to the minimum extent necessary to accommodate multiple owners. In such schemes, the basic agreement is between the members themselves, whereas in most commercial fractional ownership schemes, the owner's principal relationship is with the property developer and/or promoter of the scheme.|$|E
25|$|In the {{earliest}} days of the galley, there was no clear distinction between ships of trade and war other than their <b>actual</b> <b>usage.</b> River boats plied the waterways of ancient Egypt during the Old Kingdom (2700–2200 BC) and seagoing galley-like vessels were recorded bringing back luxuries from across the Red Sea in the reign of pharaoh Hatshepsut. Fitting rams to the bows of vessels sometime around the 8th century BC resulted in a distinct split in the design of warships, and set trade vessels apart, at least when it came to use in naval warfare. The Phoenicians used galleys for transports that were less elongated, carried fewer oars and relied more on sails. Carthaginian galley wrecks found off Sicily that date to the 3rd or 2nd century BC had a length to breadth ratio of 6:1, proportions that fell between the 4:1 of sailing merchant ships and the 8:1 or 10:1 of war galleys. Merchant galleys in the ancient Mediterranean were intended as carriers of valuable cargo or perishable goods that needed to be moved as safely and quickly as possible.|$|E
500|$|As {{explained}} by Richard Meade in the English Journal of the (American) National Council of Teachers of English, the form daylight savings time (with an [...] "s") {{was already in}} 1978 much more common than the older form daylight saving time in American English ("the change has been virtually accomplished"). Nevertheless even dictionaries such as Merriam-Webster's, American Heritage, and Oxford, which describe <b>actual</b> <b>usage</b> instead of prescribing outdated usage (and therefore also list the newer form), still list the older form first. This is because the older form is still very common in print and preferred by many editors. ("Although daylight saving time is considered correct, daylight savings time (with an [...] "s") is commonly used.") The first two words are sometimes hyphenated (daylight-saving time). Merriam-Webster's also lists the forms daylight saving (without [...] "time"), daylight savings (without [...] "time"), and daylight time.|$|E

More specifically, we formalize the abbreviation recognition task as a binary classification problem in which a classifier determines a positive (abbreviation) or negative (nonabbreviation) class, given a candidate of abbreviation definition. The proposed method achieved 95. 7 % accuracy, 90. 0 % precision, and 87. 6 % recall on the evaluation corpus containing 7, 887 (1, 430 abbreviations and 6, 457 non-abbreviation) instances of parenthetical expressions. ...|$|R

2500|$|Milton's {{interpretation}} of God {{has been described}} as Arian. Kelley explains the <b>actual</b> <b>usage</b> of this term as he says, [...] "Milton may be quite correctly called an Arian if he holds an anti-Trinitarian view of God; and it is in this sense that scholars have been calling Milton an Arian since the publication of the De Doctrina in 1825." [...] In particular, Christian Doctrine denies the eternity of the Son, Jesus's pre-birth title. Such a denial separates the unity between God and the Son. However, some claim that the Son is eternal, since he was begotten before time, and that he represents part of the Logos. But this cannot be, as Kelley points out, [...] "Milton concludes, the Son was begotten not from eternity but 'within the limits of time.'" [...] Although some have argued that the Son is equal in some respects with God, the Son lacks the complete attributes of God.|$|E

Their projects often support philanthropic efforts and respond to the needs of low-income communities. However, the organizations’ resources are dwindling. This paper raises a concern about the importance of sustaining their GIS operations particularly with the current economic downturn. We call on government officials to support nonprofit organizations in order to ensure the continuity of their GIS activities...|$|R
