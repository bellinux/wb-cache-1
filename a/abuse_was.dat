5|$|Alcohol has a {{long history}} of use and misuse {{throughout}} recorded history. Biblical, Egyptian and Babylonian sources record the history of abuse and dependence on alcohol. In some ancient cultures alcohol was worshiped and in others, its <b>abuse</b> <b>was</b> condemned. Excessive alcohol misuse and drunkenness were recognized as causing social problems even thousands of years ago. However, the defining of habitual drunkenness as it was then known as and its adverse consequences were not well established medically until the 18th century. In 1647 a Greek monk named Agapios was the first to document that chronic alcohol misuse was associated with toxicity to the nervous system and body which resulted in a range of medical disorders such as seizures, paralysis, and internal bleeding. In 1920 the effects of alcohol abuse and chronic drunkenness led to the failed prohibition of alcohol being considered and eventually enforced briefly in America. In 2005 alcohol dependence and <b>abuse</b> <b>was</b> estimated to cost the US economy approximately 220 billion dollars per year, more than cancer and obesity.|$|E

40|$|Substance <b>abuse</b> <b>is</b> a {{major issue}} all around the world. It {{is an issue that}} not only affects the abuser but also affects {{individuals}} and entire communities as well. Substance <b>abuse</b> <b>is</b> often glamorized in media and, though there are some cases where it <b>is</b> not, substance <b>abuse</b> <b>is</b> all too often misrepresented. The issue of adolescent substance <b>abuse</b> <b>is</b> virtually ignored or, at the very least, is underrepresented in media. In a few cases where adolescent substance abuse does play a role in media, it is rarely the central issue. More often than not, the issue of adolescent substance <b>abuse</b> <b>is</b> a side concern, a subplot. Crossing the Tracks is a script for a pilot episode of a television series that gives adolescent substance abuse the attention it deserves while straying from the misrepresentative tendencies of it 2 ̆ 7 s predecessors...|$|R

40|$|The use {{of drugs}} of <b>abuse</b> <b>is</b> not {{uncommon}} nowadays. Use of drugs of abuse may vary from the relatively innocent use of cannabis to severe forms of addiction to heroin and cocaine.

50|$|Domestic {{violence}} is a crime of power and intimidation. It relates highly to sexual assault.

25|$|Domestic {{violence}} against women, including spousal <b>abuse,</b> <b>was</b> tolerated and common. Spousal abuse is a crime, but police {{were reluctant to}} enforce laws against or intervene in cases of domestic violence. Assault is punishable by prison terms of one to five years and fines of up to $1,000 (465,000 CFA francs) or, if premeditated, up to 10 years' imprisonment. Many women were reluctant to file complaints against their husbands because {{they were unable to}} support themselves financially.|$|E
25|$|The {{average age}} of onset of alcohol <b>abuse</b> <b>was</b> 29 years for the Core City men and 41 years for the College men. Full blown alcoholism, where it appeared, usually lasted {{a decade or two}} before sobriety was attained. The number of alcoholics {{increased}} steadily until age 40 and then began to decline at a rate of stable remission of 2 to 3% per year. Older alcoholics are relatively rare because of the rate of remission and a higher mortality rate.|$|E

This time Damian's partner Suzanne was the abusive person in the relationship and this ultimately led to them breaking up. A week-long special dealt with date rape and teen suicide {{against the backdrop of the}} educational system.|$|E
25|$|According to some, Fleva's {{fight against}} {{government}} <b>abuse</b> <b>was</b> what caused his fall during a cabinet reshuffling, {{only three months}} after electoral victory. C. Bacalbașa notes that Fleva first attracted his colleagues' hostility when he inspected first-hand, and punished, {{the damage done by}} government representatives in the village of Spineni. Sturdza interpreted this work as a sign of disloyalty, and the National Liberal paper Voința Națională made a show of Fleva, publishing allegations about his conduct in both public and private. In what was virtually an unprecedented gesture, Titu Maiorescu, who had become leader of the opposition, denounced such mudslinging from the Assembly's rostrum.|$|E
25|$|The {{treatment}} of {{slaves in the}} United States varied widely depending on conditions, times and places. The power relationships of slavery corrupted many whites who had authority over slaves, with children showing their own cruelty. Masters and overseers resorted to physical punishments to impose their wills. Slaves were punished by whipping, shackling, hanging, beating, burning, mutilation, branding and imprisonment. Punishment was most often meted out in response to disobedience or perceived infractions, but sometimes <b>abuse</b> <b>was</b> carried out to re-assert {{the dominance of the}} master or overseer of the slave. Treatment was usually harsher on large plantations, which were often managed by overseers and owned by absentee slaveholders, conditions permitting abuses.|$|E
40|$|Domestic <b>abuse</b> <b>is</b> {{a global}} {{phenomenon}} which adversely affects individuals who experience it and creates social and financial burdens for the societies {{in which it}} occurs. While <b>abuse</b> can <b>be</b> perpetrated by women against male partners and occurs in same sex relationships, domestic <b>abuse</b> <b>is</b> overwhelmingly perpetrated by men against female partners. As a result, the United Nations has identified domestic abuse {{as a form of}} gender based violence that is predominantly experienced by women and perpetrated by men (United Nations, 1992). Domestic <b>abuse</b> <b>is</b> both a cause and consequence of gender inequality. This briefing will provide an overview of a gendered analysis of domestic abuse, outline the evidence which supports this and the debate which challenges it...|$|R
