Setting This study was conducted in a secondary care hypertension/dyslipidemia outpatient clinic in the university teaching hospital of Cova da Beira Hospital Centre, Covilhã, located in the Eastern Central Region of Portugal. Method This report evaluates the pharmacist’s interventions during a prospective randomised controlled trial, from July 2009 to June 2010. Patients with diagnosis of essential hypertension attending the clinic for routine follow-up were randomly allocated either to a control group (no pharmaceutical care) or to an intervention group (quarterly follow-up by a hospital pharmacist during a 9 -month period). The pharmacist interventions, aimed to increase medication <b>adherence</b> and blood <b>pressure</b> control, involved educational interventions and counselling tips directed to the patient. Main outcome measure Systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and blood pressure control (according to JNC 7 guidelines) assessed at the baseline visit and at the end of pharmaceutical care were the main outcome measures. Blood pressure measurements were performed by blinded nurses. Medication adherence was also evaluated, using a validated questionnaire at baseline and at the end of investigation. Results A total of 197 hypertensive patients were randomly assigned to the study (99 in the control group and 98 in the intervention group). Although there were no significant differences (P >  0. 05) in both groups concerning mean age, gender, body mass index, and antihypertensive pharmacotherapy, blood pressure control was higher in the intervention group (P =  0. 005) at the end of the study. Significant lower systolic blood pressure (− 6. 8  mmHg, P =  0. 006) and diastolic blood pressure (− 2. 9  mmHg, P =  0. 020) levels were observed in the intervention group.

40|$|Background and Aims Non-adherence is {{considered}} a major barrier to better outcomes of diabetes care. A relationship has been established between polypharmacy and patients' adherence. This study aims to investigate the occurrence of polypharmacy and non-adherence in general practice, their mutual relationship and the association between adherence and the intermediate outcomes of diabetes care. Materials and Methods We used the baseline and follow-up data of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) that compared usual care with care in accordance with a locally adapted national guideline. This study {{took place in the}} Netherlands and involved 30 general practices and 1283 patients. We obtained a complete medication profile of all participants and calculated the number of prescribed drugs and the adherence indices (AI) for oral blood glucose, blood pressure and cholesterol lowering drugs. Patients with an adherence index = 0. 8 for oral blood glucose, blood pressure and cholesterol lowering drugs. In the intervention group, increase of drug prescriptions exceeded that of controls (1. 1 +/- 2. 0 vs. 0. 6 +/- 1. 5, p < 0. 001, adjusted p < 0. 05). There was evidence of an inverse relationship between the number of drugs that had been prescribed during the last 6 months of the study and patients' <b>adherence</b> to blood <b>pressure</b> lowering medications (adjusted OR 0. 84, 95 % Cl 0. 78 - 0. 91). After one year, HbA 1 c and total cholesterol levels were significantly lower in adherent patients. Conclusion During the intervention the mean number of drug prescriptions increased in both the study groups. This did not result in a lower adherence to blood glucose and cholesterol lowering medications. Given the relationship between the number of medications and patients' <b>adherence</b> to blood <b>pressure</b> lowering drugs, it may be wise to discuss adherence before prescribing multiple drug regimens.

40|$|John M Flack, Samar A NasserDepartment of Internal Medicine, Divisions of Translational Research and Clinical Epidemiology and Endocrinology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI, USAAbstract: In {{patients}} with hypertension, 24 -hour blood pressure control {{is the major}} therapeutic goal. The number of daily doses is one characteristic of an antihypertensive agent that may affect the adequacy of 24 -hour control. One measure of therapeutic coverage is the 24 -hour trough-to-peak ratio, which determines the suitability of an agent for once-daily administration. The closer an agent is to a 100 % trough-to-peak ratio, the more uniform the 24 -hour coverage and therefore blood pressure control. High trough-to-peak ratio, long-acting antihypertensive medications lower blood pressure more gradually, which reduces the likelihood of adverse events attributable to abrupt drug action that occurs with shorter-acting agents. In hypertension, the natural diurnal variation of blood pressure may be altered, including elevated nighttime pressures. An optimal once-daily hypertension therapy would not only lower blood pressure but also normalize any blunted circadian variations in blood pressure. The benefits of once-daily agents with sustained therapeutic coverage may also be explained, in part, by increased patient adherence to simpler regimens as well as lower loss of blood pressure control during virtually inevitable intermittent noncompliance. Studies have demonstrated that once-daily antihypertensive agents have the highest adherence compared with twice-daily or multiple daily doses, including greater adherence to the prescribed timing of doses.

Interventions are needed to relieve stress as a pathway to reduced substance use and improved health outcomes. Yoga is one intervention associated with stress-reduction, but there is limited research regarding yoga’s effect on substance use. Additionally, yoga in the U.

To fill these gaps, this randomized controlled trial explored yoga’s effect on the well-being of returning citizens with HIV {{and substance}} use problems, an underrepresented group in U. S. yoga studios. Methods: Thirty-two people were randomized to treatment as usual (TAU) and 32 people were randomized to a 12 -week hatha yoga intervention. The yoga and TAU groups were compared on 1.) stress, antiretroviral therapy (ART) <b>adherence,</b> blood <b>pressure</b> and pulse at three-months post-baseline, controlling for the respective baseline dependent measure using analysis of covariance, and 2.) percentage of days of drug use at one, two and three-months post-baseline controlling for baseline drug use using generalized estimating equations.

Methods: In this prospective, single-masked crossover study, patients were randomized 1 : 1 to BTFC-DTFC or DTFC-BTFC treatment sequences. Patients self-administered each medication for 7 days, with a 48 -hour washout period between treatments, and rated ocular discomfort after each treatment period. Medication preferences based on ocular comfort (primary endpoint) and anticipated adherence were assessed. Safety outcomes included adverse events and intraocular pressure. Between-group differences in treatment preference and ocular discomfort scores were analyzed using chi-square and Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney tests, respectively. <b>Adherence,</b> intraocular <b>pressure,</b> and adverse events were summarized descriptively. Results: In total, 112 patients were enrolled (mean ± SD age, 66 ± 11 years), and 109 patients completed the study. Numerically, more patients in the intent-to-treat dataset preferred BTFC versus DTFC (59. 3 % versus 40. 7 %); however, this result was not statistically significant (treatment difference, 18. 6 %; P= 0. 0670). Mean ocular discomfort scores (range, 0 – 9) were statistically significantly lower with BTFC versus DTFC (2. 6 versus 3. 7; P= 0. 0002, Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test). More patients who preferred BTFC over DTFC were confident that they would adhere to their preferred medication. Treatment-related adverse events included blurred vision with BTFC and eye irritation or eye pain with DTFC.

Background Quality improvement programs in pressure ulcer prevention are not always successful. Design Implementation study using a pretest-posttest design. Data were collected in three probability samples. The first posttest data collection was held after six months, the second after 18 months. Method Statistical analysis was used, comparing the pretest sample and the second posttest sample. Results After 18 months, the proportion of subjects with adherent measures had increased from 10. 4 - 13. 9 %, the proportion of subjects with non-adherent measures decreased from 45. 7 - 36. 0 %, the proportion of subjects without pressure ulcer prevention increased from 43. 9 - 50. 1 % (p < 0. 0001, Chi-square test). Subanalysis revealed that a positive change in guideline adherence was observed principally in the group at risk. Better process-of-care indicators were associated by lower pressure ulcer prevalence and less severe skin lesions. The nurses’ judgement of a patient risk status was the most important factor for applying preventive measures. Furthermore, application of pressure ulcer prevention was determined by higher age (from the age category of 70 - 79 years), higher ADL dependency, higher than baseline mobility score and the presence of a pressure ulcer. 3 Conclusions Guideline <b>adherence</b> in <b>pressure</b> ulcer prevention changed significantly after implementation of the education programme.

Adherence to medication is important for blood pressure control, but poor adherence is common. The study aimed to determine the prevalence of self-care behaviours in patients attending a secondary care hypertension clinic. Methods Cross-sectional questionnaire survey. 196 patients attending a secondary care hypertension clinic in a teaching hospital serving a multiethnic population, Birmingham, UK. Main outcome measures: Prevalence of use of CAM, home monitors, adherence to anti-hypertensive medication. Results CAM use in previous 12 months was reported by 66 (43. 1 %) respondents. CAM users did not differ statistically from non-CAM users by age, gender, marital status or education. Vitamins, prayer a dietary supplements were the most commonly used CAM. Nine (12. 7 %) women reported using herbal CAM compared to one man (1. 2 %), (p = 0. 006). Ten (6. 7 %) respondents reported ever being asked by a doctor about CAM use. Perfect adherence to anti-hypertensive medication was reported by 26 (44. 8 %) CAM-users and 46 (60. 5 %) non-CAM users (p = 0. 07). Being female and a CAM user was significantly associated with imperfect adherence to anti-hypertensive medication. Older and white British respondents {{were significantly more likely to}} report perfect <b>adherence.</b> Blood <b>pressure</b> monitors were used by 67 (43. 8 %) respondents, which was not associated with gender, CAM use or adherence to medication.

We used multivariable regression to assess whether supporter presence and, among patients with supporters, supporter role (visit preparation, accompaniment to medical visit or no involvement) were associated with concurrent trends in clinical risk factors over 2 years, adjusting for sociodemographic and health characteristics. ResultsMost patients (78 %) had a main health supporter; of these, more had regular support for preparing for appointments (69 %) than were regularly accompanied to them (45 %). Patients with preparation help only were younger and more educated than accompanied patients. Support presence and type was not significantly associated with clinical risk factors.

In a large sample of patients in the Veterans Health Administration system with diabetes, among those with a family health supporter, more patients had regular support for visit preparation (69 %) than were regularly accompanied (45 %) by the supporter. There was no association between type of support for medical visits and concurrent trends in medication <b>adherence,</b> blood <b>pressure</b> or glycaemic control. Most patients with diabetes report family member involvement in medical visits; interventions to mobilize the potential of this support could be developed and tested...|$|R
40|$|In sub Saharan Africa (SSA), {{access to}} {{affordable}} hypertension care through health insurance is increasing. But due to poor adherence, hypertension treatment outcomes often remain poor. Patient-centered educational interventions may reverse this trend. Using a pre-test/post-test design, {{in this study}} we investigated the effects of a structured cardiovascular health education program (CHEP) on treatment <b>adherence,</b> blood <b>pressure</b> (BP) control and body mass index (BMI) among Nigerian hypertensive patients who received guideline-based care in a rural primary care facility, {{in the context of a}} community based health insurance program. Study participants included 149 insured patients with uncontrolled BP and/or poor self-reported medication adherence after 12 months of guideline-based care. All patients received three group-based educational sessions and usual primary care over 6 months. We evaluated changes in self-reported adherence to prescribed medications and behavioral advice (primary outcomes); systolic BP (SBP) and/or diastolic BP (DBP) and BMI (secondary outcomes); and beliefs about hypertension and medications (explora- tory outcomes). Outcomes were analyzed with descriptive statistics and regression analysis. 140 patients completed the study (94 %). At 6 months, more participants reported high adherence to medications and behavioral advice than at baseline: respectively, 101 (72 %) versus 70 (50 %), (p < 0. 001) and 126 (90 %) versus 106 (76 %), (p < 0. 001). Participants with controlled BP doubled from 34 (24 %) to 65 (46 %), (p = 0. 001). The median SBP and DBP decreased from 129. 0 to 122. 0 mmHg, (p = 0. 002) and from 80. 0 to 73. 5 mmHg, (p < 0. 001), respectively. BMI did not change (p = 0. 444). Improved medication adherence was associated with a decrease in medication concerns (p = 0. 045) and improved medication self-efficacy (p < 0. 001). By positively influencing patient perceptions of medications, CHEP strengthened medication adherence and, consequently, BP reduction among insured hypertensive Nigerians. This educational approach can support cardiovascular disease prevention programs for Africa’s growing hypertensive population...|$|R

Methods: In this prospective, single-masked crossover study, patients were randomized 1 : 1 to BTFC-DTFC or DTFC-BTFC treatment sequences. Patients self-administered each medication for 7 days, with a 48 -hour washout period between treatments, and rated ocular discomfort after each treatment period. Medication preferences based on ocular comfort (primary endpoint) and anticipated adherence were assessed. Safety outcomes included adverse events and intraocular pressure. Between-group differences in treatment preference and ocular discomfort scores were analyzed using chi-square and Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney tests, respectively. <b>Adherence,</b> intraocular <b>pressure,</b> and adverse events were summarized descriptively. Results: In total, 112 patients were enrolled (mean ± SD age, 66 ± 11 years), and 109 patients completed the study. Numerically, more patients in the intent-to-treat dataset preferred BTFC versus DTFC (59. 3 % versus 40. 7 %); however, this result was not statistically significant (treatment difference, 18. 6 %; P= 0. 0670). Mean ocular discomfort scores (range, 0 – 9) were statistically significantly lower with BTFC versus DTFC (2. 6 versus 3. 7; P= 0. 0002, Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney test). More patients who preferred BTFC over DTFC were confident that they would adhere to their preferred medication. Treatment-related adverse events included blurred vision with BTFC and eye irritation or eye pain with DTFC. Conclusion: BTFC and DTFC were preferred by approximately 60 % and 40 % of patients, respectively, and BTFC was associated with less patient-reported ocular discomfort. Greater ocular comfort of glaucoma medications may improve treatment adherence. Keywords: brinzolamide, dorzolamide, fixed combination, ocular discomfort, patient preferenc...|$|R
40|$|Background: Continuous {{positive}} airway {{pressure is}} an effective treatment of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, but adherence to treatment is low. Interventions such as encouragement, education and cognitive behavioural therapy have affected adherence to continuous positive airway pressure treatment positively. Currently there are no studies regarding the situation for personnel during the initiation process of treatment. Purpose: The purpose was to describe situations influencing the initiation of continuous positive airway pressure in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome from a personnel perspective. Materials and methods: A qualitative approach using critical incident technique was used. Data were collected through semi structured interviews. Thirty one informants were strategically selected from sixteen centres in Sweden. Results: Motivation, a prepared patient, communicational aspects and participation of family were described as pedagogical circumstances. External conditions, practical experience, the patient’s state of health and adaption to the mask were described as practical circumstances. The personnel handled the situations in a theoretical, practical and/or an emotional way. Conclusions: A better understanding of situations creating barriers or being facilitators, as well as ways to handle these situations, {{can be used to}} develop the role of personnel during the initiation process in order to increase continuous positive airway <b>pressure</b> <b>adherence...</b>|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Introduction: Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) {{is widely}} used method by {{patients}} especially with chronic diseases. Although safety and sufficiency of these practices are questionable their use among hypertensive patients is increasing. There {{is a lack of}} research studies related to variety of CAM use among hypertensive patients and factors may influence it. Aim: The aim of this descriptive {{study was to determine the}} CAM use among patients diagnosed with hypertension. Method and Material: The descriptive design was used for this study in one university hospital located in western Turkey. Data were collected form patients by using a questionnaire with diagnoses of hypertension. There were 127 patients eligible this study. Demographic variables, perceptions related to hypertension and CAM practices of patients were investigated. Results: The mean age of the patients was 59. 33 ± 11. 97 years. Most of the patients (78. 7 %) reported using CAM practices. Nutritional, cognitive and behavioral approaches, vitamins and herbal medications were mostly preferred methods for controlling the blood pressure. Conclusions: Nutritional arrangements were commonly practiced by hypertensive patients. Although hypertensive patients are on medical treatment currently most of them consider using CAM to lower their blood <b>pressure.</b> <b>Adherence</b> to medical treatment among hypertensive patients is also questionable...|$|R
40|$|Material {{selection}} in orthotic and prosthetic practice directly affects wear comfort, and thus treatment efficacy and <b>adherence.</b> In the <b>pressure</b> therapy of hypertrophic scars, insert materials made of thermoplastic (e. g. Plastazote®) are often placed underneath pressure garments {{to increase the}} local pressure for effective scar treatment. However, the currently used insert materials are barely breathable and quite uncomfortable. In this study, spacer fabric is proposed as a potential insert material. The physical properties and compression behaviour of five types of spacer fabrics are evaluated. The pressure delivered by the pressure gloves and spacer fabric inserts onto the hands of 10 subjects are measured. The {{results show that the}} spacer fabrics are not only able to provide much lower air resistance (0. 05 – 0. 12 kPa s/m) and higher water vapour transmission rate (34. 35 – 102. 39 g/h·m 2) than Plastazote®, but also produce an interfacial pressure that is comparable to Plastazote® at various locations on the hand dorsum. The results of a 24 -week clinical study in which spacer fabric inserts are applied to four hypertrophic scarred hands also support that the inserts are found to be effective in scar treatment by providing good comfort and breathability, and hence pressure treatment acceptance and compliance are increased.

40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} provider {{adherence to}} national {{guidelines for the}} treatment of hypertension in African Americans. Design. A descriptive, preexperimental, quantitative method. Methods. Electronic medical records were reviewed and data were obtained from 62 charts. Clinical data collected included blood pressure readings, medications prescribed, laboratory studies, lifestyle modification, referral to hypertension specialist, and follow-up care. Findings. Overall provider adherence was 75 %. Weight loss, sodium restriction, and physical activity recommendations were documented on 82. 3 % of patients. DASH diet and alcohol consumption were documented in 6. 5 % of participants. Follow-up was documented in 96. 6 % of the patients with controlled blood pressure and 9. 1 % in patients with uncontrolled blood <b>pressure.</b> <b>Adherence</b> in prescribing ACEIs in patients with a comorbidity of DM was documented in 70 % of participants. Microalbumin levels were ordered in 15. 2 % of participants. Laboratory adherence prior to prescribing medications was documented in 0 % of the patients and biannual routine labs were documented in 65 % of participants. Conclusion. Provider adherence overall was moderate. Despite moderate provider adherence, BP outcomes and provider adherence were not related. Contributing factors that may explain this lack of correlation include patient barriers such as nonadherence to medication and lifestyle modification recommendations and lack of adequate follow-up.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{objective}} was to establish whether pretreatment social cognitive variables {{may contribute to the}} explanation of variance in adherence to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment for patients with obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome (OSAHS). A total of 119 of 180 consecutive OSAHS patients were recruited to the study prior to initial CPAP titration. Patients completed psychological measures of health value, health locus of control (incorporating internality, chance, powerful others) and self-efficacy prior to CPAP titration. Objective adherence data were measured by CPAP unit time clocks and collected at 3 -month follow-up. Average nightly use was calculated over this period. Logistic regression of prospective predictors of adherence produced a model comprising psychological (health value, internality, powerful others), as well as clinical variables (Epworth score, body mass index, apnoea/hypopnoea index, CPAP pressure). This model explained 24 % of the variance in CPAP use, and correctly identified 75 % of adherers and 53 % of nonadherers. Although the psychological variables explained only a small amount of the overall variance in adherence behaviour, this result provides further support for the hypothesis that psychological variables contribute, in part, to continuous positive airway <b>pressure</b> <b>adherence.</b> Future research should focus on highlighting discrete variables, which may helpfully inform psychologically based interventions aimed at improving the use of continuous positive airway pressure by patients with obstructive sleep apnoea/hypopnoea syndrome at risk of discontinuance...|$|R

This {{study was conducted to}} assess {{adherence to}} medications in patients undergoing hypertensive treatment in the Primary Health Clinics of the Ministry of Health in Malaysia. Factors affecting adherence to medications were studied, and the effect of nonadherence to blood pressure control was assessed. Patients and methods: This was a cross-sectional study to assess adherence to medications by adult patients undergoing hypertensive treatment in primary care. Adherence was measured using a validated survey form for medication adherence consisting of seven questions. A retrospective medication record review was conducted to collect and confirm data on patients&rsquo; demographics, diagnosis, treatments, and outcomes. Results: Good adherence was observed in 53. 4 % of the 653 patients sampled. Female patients were found to be more likely to adhere to their medication regime, compared to their male counterparts (odds ratio 1. 46 [95 % confidence intervals [CI]: 1. 05 &ndash; 2. 04; P &lt; 0. 05]). Patients in the ethnic Chinese were twice as likely (95 % CI: 1. 14 &ndash; 3. 6; P &lt; 0. 05) to adhere, compared to those in the Indian ethnic group. An increase in the score for medicine knowledge was also found to increase the odds of adherence. On the other hand, increasing the number of drugs the patient was taking and the daily dose frequencies of the medications prescribed were found to negatively affect <b>adherence.</b> Blood <b>pressure</b> control was also found to be worse in noncompliers. Conclusion: The medication adherence rate was found to be low among primary care hypertensive patients. A poor adherence rate was found to negatively affect blood pressure control. Developing multidisciplinary intervention programs to address the factors identified is necessary to improve adherence and, in turn, to improve blood pressure control.

40|$|Abstract Background Inadequate blood {{pressure}} control and poor adherence to treatment remain {{among the major}} limitations {{in the management of}} hypertensive patients, particularly of those at high risk of cardiovascular events. Preliminary evidence suggests that home {{blood pressure}} telemonitoring (HBPT) might help increasing the chance of achieving blood pressure targets and improve patient’s therapeutic adherence. However, all these potential advantages of HBPT have not yet been fully investigated. Methods/design The purpose of this open label, parallel group, randomized, controlled study is to assess whether, in patients with high cardiovascular risk (treated or untreated essential arterial hypertension - both in the office and in ambulatory conditions over 24 h - and metabolic syndrome), long-term (48 weeks) blood pressure control is more effective when based on HBPT and on the feedback to patients by their doctor between visits, or when based exclusively on blood pressure determination during quarterly office visits (conventional management (CM)). A total of 252 patients will be enrolled and randomized to usual care (n = 84) or HBPT (n = 168). The primary study endpoint will be the rate of subjects achieving normal daytime ambulatory blood pressure targets (Discussion The TELEBPMET Study will show whether HBPT is effective in improving blood pressure control and related medical and economic outcomes in hypertensive patients with metabolic syndrome. It will also provide a comprehensive understanding of the psychological determinants of medication <b>adherence</b> and blood <b>pressure</b> control of these patients.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Despite proven effectiveness, {{participation}} in traditional supervised exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation (exCR) remains low. Telehealth interventions that use {{information and communication}} technologies to enable remote exCR programme delivery can overcome common access barriers while preserving clinical supervision and individualised exercise prescription. This meta-analysis aimed to determine the benefits of telehealth exCR on exercise capacity and other modifiable cardiovascular risk factors compared with traditional exCR and usual care, among patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). METHODS: CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, Embase, MEDLINE, PubMed and PsycINFO were searched from inception through 31 May 2015 for randomised controlled trials comparing telehealth exCR with centre-based exCR or usual care among patients with CHD. Outcomes included maximal aerobic exercise capacity, modifiable cardiovascular risk factors and exercise adherence. RESULTS: 11 trials (n= 1189) met eligibility criteria and were included in the review. Physical activity level was higher following telehealth exCR than after usual care. Compared with centre-based exCR, telehealth exCR was more effective for enhancing physical activity level, exercise <b>adherence,</b> diastolic blood <b>pressure</b> and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Telehealth and centre-based exCR were comparably effective for improving maximal aerobic exercise capacity and other modifiable cardiovascular risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Telehealth exCR appears to be at least as effective as centre-based exCR for improving modifiable cardiovascular risk factors and functional capacity, and could enhance exCR utilisation by providing additional options for patients who cannot attend centre-based exCR. Telehealth exCR must now capitalise on technological advances to provide more comprehensive, responsive and interactive interventions...|$|R
