5|$|A {{distinctive}} bird in its {{own family}} with a long curved bill, a crest and black-and-white striped wings <b>and</b> <b>tail.</b>|$|E
5|$|Breeding is {{normally}} from late May to August, {{but may be}} significantly earlier in northwest Africa or western Pakistan. Returning males arrive about {{two weeks before the}} females and establish territories which they patrol with wings held in a V-shape <b>and</b> <b>tail</b> fanned, chasing intruders while wing-clapping and calling. Fights may take place in flight or on the ground. The male's display flight involves a similar wing <b>and</b> <b>tail</b> position with frequent wing clapping as he follows the female in a rising spiral. If she lands, he continues to display with bobbing and fluttering until the female spreads her wings <b>and</b> <b>tail</b> for copulation. Mating occasionally takes place on a raised perch instead of the ground. In good habitat, there may be 20pairs per square kilometre (50per square mile).|$|E

5|$|Least weasels {{from various}} parts of its range vary greatly in size. The body is slender and {{elongated}} and the legs <b>and</b> <b>tail</b> are relatively short. The colour varies geographically, as does the pelage type and length of tail. The dorsal surface, flanks, limbs <b>and</b> <b>tail</b> of the animal are usually some shade of brown while the underparts are white. The line delineating {{the boundary between the}} two colours is usually straight. At high altitudes and {{in the northern part of}} its range, the coat becomes pure white in winter. Eighteen subspecies are recognised.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the events}} of Sonic & Knuckles, Sonic <b>and</b> <b>Tails</b> receive a {{powerful}} energy reading from Angel Island and board their biplane, the Tornado, to investigate. However, Doctor Eggman sends an elite group of EggRobos to reach the signal before Sonic <b>and</b> <b>Tails.</b> The EggRobos excavate {{the source of the}} signal, a magical gemstone called the Phantom Ruby, just as Sonic <b>and</b> <b>Tails</b> arrive. The EggRobos gain new powers from the ruby, becoming the Hard Boiled Heavies, <b>and</b> send Sonic, <b>Tails,</b> <b>and</b> the island's guardian, Knuckles, through places they have previously visited where they pursue Eggman to prevent him from using the ruby's power for evil, clashing with him and the Heavies along the way.|$|R
5|$|Test {{data from}} the earlier Lockheed X-7 {{unmanned}} ramjet/rocket program proved invaluable for aerodynamic research since the XF-104 would share the general design of the X-7's wing <b>and</b> <b>tail.</b> Experience gained from the Douglas X-3 Stiletto was also used in the design phase of the XF-104. Over 400 surplus instrumented artillery rockets were launched to test various airfoils <b>and</b> <b>tail</b> designs; from which the camera film and telemetry were recovered by parachute.|$|E
5|$|A {{relatively}} small swallow, the nominate subspecies has bronze upperparts and bronze {{sides of the}} head. The ears and lores are duller and the forehead area is more green than bronze. The shoulders, back, rump, and uppertail-coverts are, on the other hand, a coppery-bronze colour. The lesser and median coverts are more coppery, with the greater and primary-wing-coverts being more of a dusky green. The primaries, secondaries, <b>and</b> <b>tail</b> are a dusky bronze-green. The underparts are mostly white. The legs, feet, and irides are dark brown, and the bill is black. The female is similar but with a mottled grey-brown breast and occasionally throat and undertail-coverts. The juvenile is also mottled-grey brown, in addition to it being duller overall. The extant subspecies, T. e. sclateri, is primarily differentiated by its more deeply forked tail, blue-green forehead and uppertail-coverts, and blue-black wings <b>and</b> <b>tail.</b>|$|E

5|$|Both {{the male}} and female adult red-backed fairywren may utilise the {{rodent-run}} display to distract predators from nests with young birds.

5|$|It is {{now known}} that at least some, and {{probably}} all, dromaeosaurids were covered in feathers, including large, vaned, wing <b>and</b> <b>tail</b> feathers. This development, first hypothesized in the mid-late 1980s and confirmed by fossil discoveries in 1999, represents {{a significant change in}} the way dromaeosaurids have historically been depicted in art and film.|$|E

5|$|Marbled newts {{owe their}} name to their green–black, marbled colour pattern. In females, an orange-red line runs down back <b>and</b> <b>tail.</b> The crest of male marbled newts is smaller and fleshier {{than that of}} the crested newts and not indented, but marbled newt males also have a whitish tail band at {{breeding}} time.|$|E
5|$|Observed in this species, the wing-fluttering {{display is}} seen in several situations: females responding, and presumably acquiescing, to male {{courtship}} displays, juveniles begging for food, by helpers to older birds, and immature males to senior ones. The fairywren lowers its head <b>and</b> <b>tail,</b> outstretches and quivers its wings and holds its beak open silently.|$|E
5|$|The Harrier II was {{the first}} combat {{aircraft}} to extensively employ carbon-fiber composite materials, exploiting their light weight and high strength; they {{are used in the}} wings, rudder, flaps, nose, forward fuselage, <b>and</b> <b>tail.</b> Twenty-six percent of the aircraft's structure is made of composites, reducing its weight by 480lb (217kg) compared to a conventional metal structure.|$|E

When they arrive, Knuckles ambushes Sonic from underground, steals the emeralds, and disappears inland. As Sonic <b>and</b> <b>Tails</b> travel through the island, they frequently encounter Knuckles and Robotnik, who hinder their progress with various traps. Sonic <b>and</b> <b>Tails</b> eventually arrive at the Launch Base, where the destroyed Death Egg is being repaired. They fight with Knuckles, but the Death Egg launches back into the sky, leaving him behind. They fight Robotnik one last time on a platform attached to {{the underside of the}} Death Egg. They defeat him, and the resulting explosion drops [...] Sonic <b>and</b> <b>Tails</b> away from the Death Egg, which crash-lands farther off on Angel Island again. The story continues in Sonic & Knuckles.|$|R
