5|$|In {{order to}} resolve {{the problem of the}} {{excessive}} growth of phumdis that affects the lake ecosystem and local community, a study sponsored by the IndiaCanada Environment Facility was undertaken by the Tata Energy Research Institute (TERI) to examine efficient ways of converting phumdis into briquettes as fodder and fuel pellets, which could be used to meet both energy demands within the region. Two options for the biomass conversion were studied. The first involved making briquettes of vegetative part of phumdis for use as fodder while the second proposed to pelletise the lower part of phumdis for use as fuel. The study observed that phumdis have nutritional potential as feed material due to its higher crude fibre and crude protein content, but the inorganic content in the root and mat zone was found to be unsuitable for the purpose. The second option of making briquettes from the upper vegetative portion of the phumdis by mixing 12% de-oiled rice bran was found to be feasible for using them as fodder. The lower portion, which was densified to make fuel pellets, was found to be suitable for use as fuel. Such pellets were found to have an average calorific value of 3,400calories per kilogram (14,200kJ/kg) with <b>ash</b> <b>content</b> of 27%. Cost economics were worked out and the study had found it to be “an economically viable and an attractive proposition for the benefit of local population.” The study concluded that extraction of phumdi from the lake could also generate income for the local people who are dependent on the lake for their livelihood. Such a step would protect the lake from the adverse effects of proliferation of phumdis and maintain the ecological balance of the lake, thus converting the waste into wealth. The Planning Commission has also concurred with project proposals to engage interested individuals and private enterprises to begin the commercial venture of manufacturing compost from the phumdis and thus improve the environment of the Keibul Lamjao National Park. The project also envisages removal of 3630 artificial phumdis and compensation to their owners; this is reported to have been implemented.|$|E
25|$|The {{metal oxides}} (Fe2O3) can leach out of {{activated}} carbon resulting in discoloration. Acid/water-soluble <b>ash</b> <b>content</b> is {{more significant than}} total <b>ash</b> <b>content.</b> Soluble <b>ash</b> <b>content</b> can be very important for aquarists, as ferric oxide can promote algal growths. A carbon with a low soluble <b>ash</b> <b>content</b> {{should be used for}} marine, freshwater fish and reef tanks to avoid heavy metal poisoning and excess plant/algal growth.|$|E
25|$|Fly ash is {{also used}} as a {{component}} {{in the production of}} flowable fill (also called controlled low strength material, or CLSM), which is used as self-leveling, self-compact backfill material in lieu of compacted earth or granular fill. The strength of flowable fill mixes can range from 50 to 1,200 lbf/in² (0.3 to 8.3 MPa), depending on the design requirements of the project in question. Flowable fill includes mixtures of Portland cement and filler material, and can contain mineral admixtures. Fly ash can replace either the Portland cement or fine aggregate (in most cases, river sand) as a filler material. High fly <b>ash</b> <b>content</b> mixes contain nearly all fly ash, with a small percentage of Portland cement and enough water to make the mix flowable. Low fly <b>ash</b> <b>content</b> mixes contain a high percentage of filler material, and a low percentage of fly ash, Portland cement, and water. Class F fly ash is best suited for high fly <b>ash</b> <b>content</b> mixes, whereas Class C fly ash is almost always used in low fly <b>ash</b> <b>content</b> mixes.|$|E

40|$|Variation in {{heartwood}} {{color of}} sugi (Cryptomeria Japonica D. Don.) is wide from pale red to black. In this study 21 trees of 29 - 45 years old were sampled {{to examine the}} effects of <b>ash</b> <b>contents</b> on black-heartwood formation. About 20 cm thick disk was taken from the breast height of each tree and pH of the heartwood was measured in green condition. After seasoning of the disks at room temperature, lightnesses in the radial sections of the heartwoods, <b>ash</b> <b>contents</b> in the heartwoods and in the sapwoods were determined. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1) <b>Ash</b> <b>contents</b> were ca. 0. 5 % in the typical red-heartwoods having lightness values of 65 or more, and ca. 1. 0 % in the typical black -heartwoods having lightness values of 50 or less. As a result high correlations between <b>ash</b> <b>contents</b> and lightnesses in heartwoods were recognized. There were also significant correlations between <b>ash</b> <b>contents</b> in heartwoods and in sapwoods at the breast height of tree stems. 2) The pH values of typical black-heartwoods showed weak alkali, although the values of normal red-heartwoods indicated weak acid. On the other side, total contents of K, Ca, Mg and Na were more in black-heartwoods than in red-heartwoods. This suggested that heartwood of sugi was alkalized when the accumulation of these metals in the heartwood exceeded the permitted amount. 3) The mechanism of black-heartwood formation was discussed. From the relationship between diameter growth and heartwood lightness, it was presumed that the amount of transpiration took part in the formation of black-heartwood. スギの黒心材形成への灰分の関与を検討するために, 心材色ができるだけ広範囲に分布するように考慮しながら採取した, 樹幹の胸高付近からの円板を用いて, 心材色, 灰分および材のpHを測定した. 1) 典型的な黒心材では弱アルカリ性を, 典型的な赤心材では弱酸性を示した. 2) 心材の灰分量は, 典型的な赤心材では 0. 5 %程度であるが, 典型的な黒心材では 1 %前後の値を示し, 赤心材よりも黒心材で灰分が多かった. また, 心材の灰分量が多い試験木では, 辺材の灰分量も多い傾向がみられた. 3) 灰分の定量元素分析の結果, 灰分中にはK, Ca, MgおよびNaが多く含まれていることがわかった. また, 心材の単位重量当たりのこれらアルカリ金属イオンの合計モル数は, 赤心材よりも黒心材で大きな値を示した. このために, 黒心材はアルカリ性を示すのであろうと推測された. 4) 以上の結果と既往の研究報告とを考え合わせ, 黒心材形成の原因について考察し, 黒心材形成への蒸散量の関与を提案した...|$|R

40|$|The {{biological}} treatment of cassava peels was done using Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus funmigatus, Rhizopus stolonifer, Mucor mucedo and Penicillium notatum bringing about {{a decrease in}} the cyanide and an increase in the protein contents with peels fermented with the fungi Rhizopus stolonifer having best fermentative ability. The cyanide content decreased from 43. 94 mg/kg to 10. 85 mg/kg while protein content increased from 7. 96 % to 22. 28 %. There was also an increase in the percentage dry matter and <b>ash</b> <b>contents</b> of the fermented cassava peels when compared with the unfermented while a significant decrease in the carbohydrate, fat and fibre contents was observed. These findings showed that the nutritional composition of cassava peels characterized by high cyanide content, high carbohydrate content coupled with low protein and <b>ash</b> <b>contents,</b> improved when treated biologically with fungal isolates resulting in decrease in cyanide, carbohydrate and fat contents and increase in protein, dry matter and <b>ash</b> <b>contents.</b> The {{biological treatment}} of cassava peels with fungal isolates could be a good source of protein in livestock feeds and subsequent improvement in its nutritional quality...|$|R
40|$|The {{experimental}} site “Sial Morr Sugar mill, District Sargodha” Punjab, Pakistan {{was selected}} to carry out present investigation. The forage samples of Eragrostis pilosa, Dactyloctenium ae gyptium, Parthenium hysterophorus and Calotropis procera were collected from the three sites held in this area.

25|$|There {{are many}} {{technological}} methane production methods. Methane created from biomass in industrial plants via biological route is called biogas.

Example of large-scale coal-to-methane gasification is the Great Plains Synfuels plant, started in 1984 in Beulah, North Dakota as a way to develop abundant local resources of low-grade lignite, a resource that is otherwise very hard to transport for its weight, <b>ash</b> <b>content,</b> low calorific value and propensity to spontaneous combustion during storage and transport.|$|E

2500|$|Coal {{contains}} {{a small amount}} of radioactive uranium, barium, thorium and potassium, but, in the case of pure coal, this is significantly less than the average concentration of those elements in the Earth's crust.
