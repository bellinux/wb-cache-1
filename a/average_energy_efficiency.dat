5000|$|Finally, vehicle energy {{efficiency}} calculations would be misleading without factoring the energy {{cost of producing}} the vehicle itself. This initial energy cost can of course be depreciated {{over the life of}} the vehicle to calculate an <b>average</b> <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> over its effective life span. In other words, vehicles that take a lot of energy to produce and are used for relatively short periods will require a great deal more energy over their effective lifespan than those that do not, and are therefore much less energy efficient than they may otherwise seem. Hybrid and electric cars use less energy in their operation than comparable petroleum-fueled cars but more energy is used to manufacture them, so the overall difference would be less than immediately apparent. Compare, for example, walking, which requires no special equipment at all, and an automobile, produced in and shipped from another country, and made from parts manufactured around the world from raw materials and minerals mined and processed elsewhere again, and used for a limited number of years.According to the French energy and environment agency ADEME, [...] an average motor car has an embodied energy content of 20,800 kWh and an average electric vehicle amounts to 34,700 kWh. The electric car requires nearly twice as much energy to produce, primarily due to the large amount of mining and purification necessary for the rare earth metals and other materials used in lithium-ion batteries and in the electric drive motors. This represents a significant portion of the energy used {{over the life of the}} car (in some cases nearly as much as energy that is used through the fuel that is consumed, effectively doubling the car's per-distance energy consumption), and cannot be ignored when comparing automobiles to other transport modes. It is important to note, also, that as these are average numbers for French automobiles and they are likely to be significantly larger in more auto-centric countries like the United States and Canada, where much larger and heavier cars are more common.|$|E

The building simulation software Simien was utilized to create a model of the hotel, in order to estimate annual demands for space heating and cooling. Due to limitations in the software regarding transient operations, additional demand curves had to be constructed for domestic hot water, refrigeration and freezing loads. A model of the energy system was created in Dymola, where several simulations were carried out in order to investigate the performance and potential of the CO 2 and propane heat pumps. The simulations revealed that the purposed energy system is able to cover all thermal demands for the seasonal scenarios. The annual <b>average</b> <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> for the CO 2 system was found to be 5. 55.
