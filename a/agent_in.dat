Using mix-game to predict Shanghai Index, we find the time series of prediction accurate rates is sensitive to the initial strategy distributions of <b>agents</b> <b>in</b> group 2 who play minority game, but less sensitive to the initial strategy distributions of <b>agents</b> <b>in</b> group 1 who play majority game. And <b>agents</b> <b>in</b> group 2 tend to cluster in full strategy space (FSS) if the real financial time series has obvious tendency (upward or downward), otherwise they tend to scatter in FSS. We also find that the initial strategy distributions and the number of <b>agents</b> <b>in</b> group 1 influence the level of prediction accurate rates. Finally, this paper gives suggestion about further research. Comment: 8 figures, 2 tables, 10 page...|$|R
