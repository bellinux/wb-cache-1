5|$|The philosopher Peter Singer {{considers}} that usually when we describe an action as conscientious {{in the critical}} sense we do {{so in order to}} deny either that the relevant <b>agent</b> <b>was</b> motivated by selfish desires, like greed or ambition, or that he acted on whim or impulse.|$|E
5|$|At the {{completion}} of his contract following the 2016–17 season, Schroeder as a restricted free <b>agent</b> <b>was</b> not to be tendered a new contract with the Wild. Approaching his free agent status, Schroeder was traded by the Wild to the Columbus Blue Jackets in exchange for Dante Salituro on June 23, 2017. He was later signed by the Blue Jackets to avoid free agency with a two-year contract on June 27, 2017.|$|E
5|$|Having {{previously}} gained {{political control}} of Antelope, Oregon, Rajneesh's followers, who were based in nearby Rajneeshpuram, sought election {{to two of}} the three seats on the Wasco County Circuit Court that were up for election in November 1984. Fearing they would not gain enough votes, Rajneeshpuram officials decided to incapacitate voters in The Dalles, the largest population center in Wasco County. The chosen biological <b>agent</b> <b>was</b> Salmonella enterica Typhimurium, which was first delivered through glasses of water to two County Commissioners and then, on a larger scale, at salad bars and in salad dressing.|$|E

Hence, the incentives of the <b>agent</b> <b>are</b> aligned with those of the society and the <b>agent</b> <b>is</b> incentivized to be truthful in order to help the mechanism achieve its goal.|$|R
5|$|In 1918 Davies {{sought the}} {{position}} of miners' agent for the Dowlais district of the SWMF. Against strong competition—his main opponent was William Mainwaring, later a long-serving Labour MP for Rhondda East—Davies was victorious by 100 votes. The main role of the <b>agent</b> <b>was</b> to represent miners in disputes with their employers; typically these would involve issues of pay, redundancy, working hours, and compensation for injuries. Davies's surviving day books reveal {{the extent to which}} he was concerned with cases where the mining companies denied liability for underground injuries.|$|E
5|$|James is {{represented}} by agent Rich Paul of Klutch Sports. His first <b>agent</b> <b>was</b> Aaron Goodwin, whom he left in 2005 for Leon Rose. Rose joined Creative Artists Agency (CAA) in 2007, and he worked with fellow CAA agent Henry Thomas, who represented Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, to bring James to Miami in 2010. James left CAA for Paul in 2012. James, Paul, Maverick Carter, and Randy Mims—all childhood friends—formed agent and sports-marketing company LRMR after James left Goodwin. LRMR handles James' marketing, including the marketing of The Decision, {{for which it was}} criticized.|$|E

During a guest performance by the diva Lamiroir, her manager Romein LeTouse is shot and killed in her dressing room. When Machi Tobaye, Lamiroir's pianist, is accused for the killing, Apollo, through an extensive investigation, discovers that Machi {{and one of the}} Gavinners, Detective Daryan Crescend, conspired to smuggle contraband into the country, and that Letouse, in reality an undercover Interpol <b>agent,</b> <b>was</b> murdered to cover it up. The case nearly falls apart {{due to a lack of}} decisive evidence, but Apollo is able to squeeze a confession out of Daryan by threatening to have Machi testify.|$|E
5|$|Before {{resorting to}} killing Amin by brute force, the Soviets {{had tried to}} poison him (but nearly killed his nephew instead) and to kill him with a sniper shot {{on his way to}} work (this proved {{impossible}} as the Afghans had improved their security measures). They even tried to poison Amin just hours before the assault on the Presidential Palace. Amin had organised a lunch for party members to show guests his palace and to celebrate Ghulam Dastagir Panjsheri's return from Moscow. Panjsheri's return improved the mood even further; he boasted that the Soviet divisions had already crossed the border, and that he and Gromyko always kept in contact with each other. During the meal, Amin and several of his guests lost consciousness as they had been poisoned. Luckily for Amin, but unfortunately for the Soviets, he survived his encounter with death. Mikhail Talybov, a KGB <b>agent,</b> <b>was</b> given responsibility for the poisonings.|$|E
5000|$|Ablative of <b>agent</b> <b>is</b> a more {{generalized}} {{version of}} the ablative of personal agent, used when the <b>agent</b> <b>is</b> an inanimate object.

30|$|Triadic {{patterns}} are groups {{in which all}} three <b>agents</b> <b>are</b> linked {{to each other in}} different ways. In the egalitarian triad (300), all links are reciprocated and of equal strength. In the collateral triad (120 D), only two <b>agents</b> <b>are</b> connected by a strong reciprocated link and the third <b>agent</b> <b>is</b> collaterally connected to them both by a strong incoming but non-reciprocated link. By contrast, in the broker triad (120 U), the two <b>agents</b> <b>are</b> connected to the third one by a strong outgoing link [a pattern known as tertius gaudens (Simmel 1964)]. This is a broker’s position, where a single <b>agent</b> <b>is</b> appreciated by a dyad and can thus influence the dyad.|$|R
5|$|Chesbro {{met with}} Highlanders owner Frank J. Farrell and new manager Harry Wolverton in February 1912 about {{attempting}} a comeback.

Chesbro's request for reinstatement as a free <b>agent</b> <b>was</b> granted in March, while the Highlanders granted him his unconditional release. Chesbro decided to travel to Hot Springs, Arkansas, where teams participated in spring training, {{in an attempt to}} find a team willing to give him a chance at a comeback.

5|$|Fairley's {{proposed}} use of atebrin as a prophylactic <b>agent</b> <b>was</b> {{accepted and}} Fairley switched the Australian Army over to using atebrin as a prophylaxis instead of quinine in March 1943. The most acute problem {{at this time}} was a shortage of atebrin. The Australian Army had only seven weeks' stock was on hand in March 1943 and US forces in both the South West Pacific and South Pacific Area were drawing on Australian Army stocks as they had not yet received adequate stocks of their own. The drug is also a dye, and had the known side effect of making the skin and eyeballs of the user go yellow in colour after repeated use but this was an acceptable drawback in wartime. Prolonged use could cause lichen planus and psychosis in rare cases, but atebrin still {{turned out to be}} much safer than quinine. Blackwater fever—which had a mortality rate of 25%—disappeared entirely.|$|E
5|$|In 1975 in the United States, {{a serious}} {{outbreak}} of oyster-vectored disease {{was caused by}} Vibrio vulnificus. Although the number of victims was low, the mortality rate was high at 50%. About 10 cases have occurred annually since then and further {{research needs to be}} done to establish the epidemiology of the infections. The cases peak in mid-summer and autumn with no cases being reported in mid winter so there may be a link between the temperature at which the oysters are held between harvesting and consumption. In 1978, an oyster-associated gastrointestinal infection affecting more than 2,000 people occurred in Australia. The causative <b>agent</b> <b>was</b> found to be the Norwalk virus and the epidemic caused major economic difficulties to the oyster farming industry in the country. In 1988, an outbreak of hepatitis A associated with the consumption of inadequately cooked clams (Anadara subcrenata) took place in the Shanghai area of China. An estimated 290,000 people were infected and there were 47 deaths.|$|E
50|$|In general, some, but not all, <b>agents</b> <b>are</b> {{federal law}} {{enforcement}} officers, and hold either arrest authority or the right to conduct minor criminal/non-criminal investigations.

5|$|On October 1, 1938, Skelton {{replaced}} Red Foley as {{the host}} of Avalon Time on NBC; Edna also joined the show's cast, under her maiden name. She developed a system for working with the show's writers: selecting material from them, adding her own and filing the unused bits and lines for future use; the Skeltons worked on Avalon Time until late 1939. Skelton's work in films led to a new regular radio show offer; between films, he promoted himself and MGM by appearing without charge at Los Angeles area banquets. A radio advertising <b>agent</b> <b>was</b> a guest {{at one of his}} banquet performances and recommended Skelton to one of his clients.|$|E
5|$|The Dalton {{character}} {{was created for}} All That Glitters, a planned spin-off series from Knight Rider, and a backdoor pilot aired as a second-season episode of that series in 1984.

A subsequent series, to be called Dalton, was ordered by NBC for midseason, then production was cancelled after just four episodes were completed. These aired {{in the summer of}} 1986 as a television movie titled Dalton: Code of Vengeance II and {{as a part of a}} fill-in series called Dalton's Code of Vengeance.|$|E
5|$|The Roseland Theater, {{sometimes}} called the Roseland Theater and Grill, is a music venue located at 8 Northwest Sixth Avenue in the Old Town Chinatown neighborhood of Portland, Oregon, in the United States. The building was originally a church, constructed by the Apostolic Faith Church in 1922. In 1982, Larry Hurwitz converted the building to a music venue called Starry Night. In 1990, the club's 21-year-old publicity <b>agent</b> <b>was</b> murdered {{in one of the}} theater's hallways; Hurwitz was convicted for this murder ten years later. Hurwitz sold the club in 1991, claiming he had lost support from the local music industry. The venue was given its current name during the 1991 ownership transfer.

5|$|The Senators {{struggled}} {{late in the}} 2007–08 season, leading {{general manager}} Bryan Murray to make changes to the team. Both Emery and McGrattan were sent from Ottawa in separate transactions. McGrattan, a pending free <b>agent,</b> <b>was</b> traded to the Phoenix Coyotes on June 25, 2008, {{in exchange for a}} fifth-round draft pick in the 2009 NHL Entry Draft. The Coyotes subsequently signed him to a one-year contract for the 2008–09 season. However, he played only three games with Phoenix before he voluntarily entered the league's substance abuse program. McGrattan's struggles with alcohol abuse reached its lowest point and he spent over two months at an Arizona rehab centre as he worked toward changing his life. He returned to the Coyotes late in the season but played only two additional games before he suffered a shoulder injury that required surgery to repair.|$|E
5|$|The Turin {{panel has}} {{suffered}} heavy overpainting and cracking along the vertical join. The marbleized reddish-brown paint on its reverse is heavily worn. In the 20th century the panel underwent three restorations and extensive technical analyses. The earliest, in 1952, removed overpainting and repaired pigment loss to Francis's tonsure, Leo's cowl {{and areas of}} vegetation between the two figures. Restorers discovered an irretrievably lost inscription on a rock adjacent to the seraph-Christ, and evidence of earlier overpainting of one of Leo's feet. Continued paint loss and cracking along the join required further restoration in 1970, when a fixing <b>agent</b> <b>was</b> applied to prevent cracking, and Francis's tonsure was repainted.|$|E
5|$|The initial premise {{placed the}} story on a space station to avoid the {{ecological}} damage that the creatures would have on a planet. However, Gerrold's <b>agent</b> <b>was</b> concerned that requiring a miniature of the station to be built {{as well as the}} additional sets would cause it to be too expensive for a single episode. Because of his agent's comments, Gerrold modified the pitch to place the action on a colony planet instead. This pitch included the plot points such as the creatures getting into a poisoned grain storage, but omitted the Klingons; and Cyrano Jones was called Cyrano Smith. The five pitches were submitted by Gerrold's agent in February 1967, and received a response in June. At the time the show had already purchased too many scripts for the second season but story editor D. C. Fontana suggested that they should purchase the story and assign it to a staff writer as it was better than some of the other stories they already had.|$|E
