The war began with isolated clashes along the land and maritime boundaries of Vietnam and Kampuchea between 1975 and 1977, occasionally involving division-sized military formations. On 25 December 1978, Vietnam launched <b>a</b> <b>full-scale</b> invasion of Kampuchea and subsequently occupied the country and removed the Khmer Rouge government from power.|$|E

50|$|Tagorians or Tagoryans (тагоряне) are a fictional, lizard-like alien {{race from}} the Noon Universe created by Strugatsky brothers.

An official contact with Tagorians, however, was registered in 2122 AD and <b>a</b> <b>full-scaled</b> diplomatic relationship has been established two years later, as soon as human scientists (led by professor Sugimoto) managed to decode and interpret Tagorian language.|$|R
5000|$|In Boris and Arkady Strugatsky's Noon Universe stories, Venus is {{depicted}} as an extremely harsh planet covered by strange flora and fauna but also very rich in minerals and heavy metals. The Land of Crimson Clouds (Russian: Strana Bagrovykh Tuch, 1959) describes the first successful manned mission to Venus, although <b>a</b> <b>full-scaled</b> colonization of the planet was not initiated until much later (in 2119; see Noon: 22nd Century).|$|R

5|$|The {{mood was}} now so {{volatile}} that Charles feared <b>a</b> <b>full-scale</b> London {{rebellion against the}} monarchy. Food production and distribution had been disrupted {{to the point of}} non-existence; Charles announced that supplies of bread would be brought into the City every day, and safe markets set up round the perimeter. These markets were for buying and selling; there was no question of distributing emergency aid.|$|E
5|$|The {{use of an}} {{aluminium}} {{body was}} controversial, and international experts recommended that the tram company should not choose that solution. The goal was to decrease the weight so the trams could operate with less-powerful motors, giving a lower cost. The first prototype was <b>a</b> <b>full-scale</b> model of a tram, built at Homansbyen Depot in 1935, using an undercarriage from disused horsecars.|$|E
5|$|A secret {{contract}} {{was awarded to}} M. W. Kellogg for engineering studies in July 1941. This included the design and construction of a ten-stage pilot gaseous diffusion plant. On 14 December 1942, the Manhattan District contracted Kellogg to design, build and operate <b>a</b> <b>full-scale</b> production plant. Unusually, the contract did not require any guarantees from Kellogg that it could actually accomplish this task. Because {{the scope of the}} project was not well defined, Kellogg and the Manhattan District agreed to defer any financial details to a later, cost-plus contract, which was executed in April 1944. Kellogg was then paid $2.5 million.|$|E
5000|$|In July 2008, <b>a</b> static <b>full-scale</b> replica B-339C was {{completed}} by the Cradle of Aviation Museum in Long Island, New York.

5|$|After the Omagh bombing, the RIRA {{leadership}} {{were unwilling}} to launch <b>a</b> <b>full-scale</b> campaign in Northern Ireland due {{to the possibility of}} civilians being killed. Instead they decided to launch a series of attacks in England, in particular London, which they hoped would attract disenchanted Provisional IRA members to join the RIRA. On 1 June 2000 a bomb damaged Hammersmith Bridge; a symbolic target for Irish republican paramilitary groups. The bridge had been targeted by the Irish Republican Army on 29 March 1939 as part of its Sabotage Campaign, and by the Provisional IRA on 24 April 1996.|$|E
5|$|At 1:00 pm on December 10, General Matsui {{ordered all}} units to launch <b>a</b> <b>full-scale</b> attack on Nanking. That day the SEA {{assaulted}} China's super-elite Training Brigade on {{the peaks of}} Zijinshan, which dominate Nanking's northeast horizon. Clambering up the ridges of the mountain, {{the men of the}} SEA had to painstakingly wrest control of each Chinese encampment one by one in bloody infantry charges. Advancing along the south side of Zijinshan was no easier as General Matsui had forbidden his men from using artillery there due to his deep conviction that no damage should come to its two famous historical sites, Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum and Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum.|$|E
5|$|Binaural is {{the sixth}} studio album by the American {{alternative}} rock band Pearl Jam, released on May 16, 2000 through Epic Records. Following <b>a</b> <b>full-scale</b> tour {{in support of}} its previous album, Yield (1998), Pearl Jam took a short break before reconvening {{toward the end of}} 1999 to begin work on a new album. During the production of the album, the band encountered hindrances such as singer Eddie Vedder's writer's block, and guitarist Mike McCready's entrance into rehabilitation due to an addiction to prescription drugs.|$|E

5|$|By the 1284 Statute of Rhuddlan, the Principality of Wales was {{incorporated}} into England and was given an administrative system like the English, with counties policed by sheriffs. English law was introduced in criminal cases, though the Welsh were allowed to maintain their own customary laws in some cases of property disputes. After 1277, and increasingly after 1283, Edward embarked on <b>a</b> <b>full-scale</b> project of English settlement of Wales, creating new towns like Flint, Aberystwyth and Rhuddlan. Their new residents were English migrants, with the local Welsh banned from living inside them, and many were protected by extensive walls.|$|E
5|$|By the 4th century BC, the {{military}} formations the Romans had {{inherited from the}} Etruscans were still in use. Though their efficiency was doubtful, they proved effective against Rome's largely local adversaries. When Gauls invaded Etruria in 390 BC, the inhabitants requested help from Rome. The small contingent Rome sent to repel the Gallic invaders provoked <b>a</b> <b>full-scale</b> attack on Rome and the entire Roman army was destroyed at the Battle of the Allia.|$|E

His plan is thwarted when General Melchett arrives to see what is happening and remarks that he shot an entire platoon that used this exact method; Blackadder overhears and narrowly escapes Melchett's punishment by pretending he is relating the story to Baldrick.|$|E
