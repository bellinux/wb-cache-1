5|$|And {{being on}} that blessed pilgrimage {{in the sacred}} city of Rome and seeing its great and ancient monuments and reading the great deeds of the Romans as {{described}} by Virgil, Sallust, Lucan, Livy, Valerius, Orosius, and other masters of history... I took my prompting from them although I am a disciple unworthy of such an undertaking. But {{in view of the}} fact that our city of Florence, daughter and offspring of Rome, was mounting and pursuing great purposes, while Rome was in its decline, I thought it proper to trace in this chronicle the origins of the city of Florence, so far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> able to recover them, and to relate the city's further development at greater length, and at the same time to give a brief account of events throughout the world as long as it please God, in the hope of whose favor I undertook the said enterprise rather than in reliance on my own poor wits. And thus in the year 1300, on my return from Rome, I began to compile this book in the name of God and the blessed John the Baptist and in honor of our city of Florence.|$|E

And therefore you should not hide from me your debts whatsoever it be ... send me word in any wise of the whole sum of your debts, for I and your mother will see them forthwith paid and whatsoever you do spend in the honest service of our master and for his honour, so you do not let wild and wanton men consume it, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> served in my days, you must think all is spent as it should be, and all that I have must be yours ...

Because [...] said it was no day for gentlewomen to go … Whereunto my lady {{answered}} and said that she might choose and go at her pleasure, but all hers should go; and was very angry. They asked who should keep her company if all they went; she said Mrs. Owen should keep her company at dinner; the same tale doth Picto, who doth dearly love her, confirm. Certainly, my Lord, as little while <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> here, I have heard divers tales of her that maketh me judge her to be a strange woman of mind.|$|E

500|$|New {{developments}} in the science of motion picture photography are not abundant at this advanced {{stage of the game}} but periodically one is perfected to make this a greater art. Of these I am in an excellent position to discuss what is termed [...] "Pan-focus", <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> active for two years in its development and used {{it for the first time}} in Citizen Kane. Through its use, it is possible to photograph action from a range of eighteen inches from the camera lens to over two hundred feet away, with extreme foreground and background figures and action both recorded in sharp relief. Hitherto, the camera had to be focused either for a close or a distant shot, all efforts to encompass both at the same time resulting in one or the other being out of focus. This handicap necessitated the breaking up of a scene into long and short angles, with much consequent loss of realism. With pan-focus, the camera, like the human eye, sees an entire panorama at once, with everything clear and lifelike.|$|E
500|$|Will & Grace creators and {{executive}} producers David Kohan and Max Mutchnick {{were in favor}} of doing a live episode; [...] "We love the idea of a live episode because we get to show the audience of Will & Grace what we've known from day one — we work with the best cast in network television," [...] said Mutchnick. He noted that the live element would allow the writers to make changes in the script right up until the airing of the episode. Kevin Reilly, who at the time served as NBC Entertainment President, said the [...] "challenging live platform launch" [...] for Will & Grace would be a good way for the show to inaugurate its final season. In discussion of the episode, Burrows, the director of all Will & Grace episodes, commented: [...] "This will be like the classic golden era of television that I was weaned on, where the audience sees everything. Directing a live broadcast will be a first for me, and as long <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in the business, there are very few firsts." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 1997, {{the band}} convened at Buck's Kauai {{vacation}} home to record demos of material {{intended for the}} next album. The band sought to reinvent its sound and intended to incorporate drum loops and percussion experiments. Just as the sessions were due to begin in October, Berry decided, after months of contemplation and discussions with Downs and Mills, to tell {{the rest of the}} band that he was quitting. Berry told his bandmates that he would not quit if they would break up as a result, so Stipe, Buck, and Mills agreed to carry on as a three-piece with his blessing. Berry publicly announced his departure three weeks later in October 1997. Berry told the press, [...] "I'm just not as enthusiastic <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in the past about doing this anymore [...] [...] [...] I have the best job in the world. But I'm kind of ready to sit back and reflect and maybe not be a pop star anymore." [...] Stipe admitted that the band would be different without a major contributor: [...] "For me, Mike, and Peter, as R.E.M., are we still R.E.M.? I guess a three-legged dog is still a dog. It just has to learn to run differently." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{found my}} speech then--a wretched, hesitating speech, for which I hated myself--and replied, that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> asked to <b>be</b> {{allowed to see}} her <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{informed}} of her existence.|$|R
500|$|Confronted by a Puritan {{friend with}} rumours about his [...] "ungodly life", Dudley defended himself in 1576: I {{stand on the}} top of the hill, where ... the {{smallest}} slip seemeth a fall ... I may fall many ways and have more witnesses thereof than many others who perhaps be no saints neither ... for my faults ... they lie before Him who I have no doubt but will cancel them <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> and shall be most heartily sorry for them. With Douglas Sheffield, a young widow of the Howard family, he had a serious relationship from about 1569. He explained to her that he could not marry, not even in order to beget a Dudley heir, without his [...] "utter overthrow": You must think it is some marvellous cause ... that forceth me thus to be cause almost of the ruin of mine own house ... my brother you see long married and not like to have children, it resteth so now in myself; and yet such occasions is there ... as if I should marry I am sure never to have [...] favour". Although in this letter Leicester said he still loved her as he did at the beginning, he offered her his help to find another husband for reasons of respectability if she so wished. The affair continued and in 1574 [...] Douglas gave birth to a son, also called Robert Dudley.|$|E
500|$|Fatboy {{is one of}} four {{characters}} {{created for}} the first series of the EastEnders online spin-off EastEnders: E20 who also appear in the main show, along with ZsaZsa, Leon and Mercy. Fatboy, along with the other characters from E20, was created by the show's thirteen writers during a summer school run by the BBC in August 2009. Open auditions for the cast were held at Theatre Royal Stratford East. Norwood's casting was announced on 25 November 2009, on which he said [...] "I am so excited to be on the show. It's an honour to now be part of a show that has been on in my house for as long <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> alive. I am born and bred in the East End—a stone's throw from the real Albert Square. It feels like a homecoming. I love being part of a cast that feels like family and can't wait to have a scene in The Vic." [...] Kenny, who {{was also one of the}} writers, said a character like Fatboy would not have appeared in EastEnders had he not been written by young people. Norwood stated in 2013 that being from east London and playing a character from east London meant that he could [...] "bring the truth to that character from the knowledge I have. [...] try and bring the truth out of that instead of doing it from an outside perspective." ...|$|E
2500|$|GAA President Christy Cooney {{said the}} events were a [...] "watershed" [...] and {{one where the}} [...] "{{circumstances}} were bizarre.

2500|$|And {{going around}} with the master mason, {{examining}} which figures to leave and which to destroy, the priest spotted a Saint Anthony and said: 'Save this one.' Then he found a figure of Saint Sano and said: 'This one is to be gotten rid of, since as long <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the Priest here I have never seen anyone light a candle in front of it, nor has it ever seemed to me useful; therefore, mason, get rid of it.' ...|$|E

[...] I acknowledge myself guilty in regard of many of my slaves, but I call God to witness to my innocence in respect to the murder of Prosper. [...] I am sensible that the country thirsts for my blood, and I am ready to sacrifice it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{prevailing}} atmosphere of panic, no-one attributed the defeat to overwhelming odds. Nottingham accused Torrington of treachery, informing William on 13 July [...] "In plain terms ... Torrington deserted the Dutch so shamefully {{that the whole}} squadron had been lost if some of our ships had not rescued them." [...] Nottingham was anxious to shift blame but no one disputed his interpretation. [...] "I cannot express to you", wrote William to the Grand Pensionary Anthonie Heinsius in the Dutch Republic, [...] "how distressed I am at the disasters of the fleet; I am so much the more deeply affected <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> informed that my ships did not properly support those of the Estates, and left them in the lurch.|$|E

2500|$|Cherryh's works depict {{fictional worlds}} with great realism {{supported}} by her strong background in languages, history, archaeology, and psychology. In her introduction to Cherryh's first book, Andre Norton compared {{the effect of}} the work to Tolkien's: [...] "Never since reading The Lord of the Rings have I been so caught up in any tale <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in Gate of Ivrel." [...] Another reviewer commented, [...] "Her blend of science and folklore gives the novels an intellectual depth comparable to Tolkien or Gene Wolfe". [...] Cherryh creates believable alien cultures, species, and perspectives, causing the reader to reconsider basic assumptions about human nature. Her worlds have been praised as complex and realistic because she presents them through implication rather than explication. She describes the difficulties of translating/expressing concepts between differing languages. This is best demonstrated in both the Chanur and Foreigner series.|$|E
