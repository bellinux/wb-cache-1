5|$|In October 1964, at a {{ceremony}} in honour of Soviet cosmonauts, Brezhnev called for the strengthening of the Party apparatus. This speech {{was only the beginning}} of a large campaign directed against Kosygin. Several newspapers, such as Pravda and Kommunist, criticised the work of the Council of Ministers, and indirectly Kosygin, its chairman, for planning the economy in <b>an</b> <b>unrealistic</b> fashion, and used the highly aggressive rhetoric previously used to condemn Khrushchev against Kosygin.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, Lewis Fry Richardson {{published}} {{the first attempt}} at forecasting the weather numerically. Using a hydrostatic variation of Bjerknes's primitive equations, Richardson produced by hand a 6-hour forecast {{for the state of}} the atmosphere over two points in central Europe, taking at least six weeks to do so. His forecast calculated that the change in surface pressure would be , <b>an</b> <b>unrealistic</b> value incorrect by two orders of magnitude. The large error was caused by an imbalance in the pressure and wind velocity fields used as the initial conditions in his analysis.|$|E

5|$|One analyst {{reasoned}} the {{recurrence of}} lesbian chic {{was due to}} the often-used homoerotic subtexts of gay male subculture being considered off limits because of AIDS in the late 1980s and 1990s, joined with the distant memory of lesbians as they appeared in the 1970s: unattractive and militant. In short, lesbians became more attractive to general audiences when they ceased having political convictions. All the attention on feminine and glamorous women created what culture analyst Rodger Streitmatter characterizes as <b>an</b> <b>unrealistic</b> image of lesbians packaged by heterosexual men; the trend influenced an increase in the inclusion of lesbian material in pornography aimed at men.|$|E
5|$|Adding to Sulley's lifelike {{appearance}} was an intense {{effort by the}} technical team to refine the rendering of fur. Other production houses had tackled realistic fur, most notably Rhythm & Hues in its 1993 polar bear commercials for Coca-Cola and in its talking animals' faces in the 1995 film Babe. This film, however, required fur on a far larger scale. From the standpoint of Pixar's engineers, the quest for fur posed several significant challenges; one was {{to figure out how}} to animate a large numbers of hairs — 2,320,413 of them on Sulley — in a reasonably efficient way, and another was to make sure that the hairs would cast shadows on other ones. Without self-shadowing, either fur or hair takes on <b>an</b> <b>unrealistic</b> flat-colored look (e.g., in Toy Story, the hair on Andy's toddler sister, as seen in that movie's opening sequence, is hair without self-shadowing).|$|E

30|$|The {{results from}} the {{previous}} section suggest that comparing samples is misleading if we ignore differences in the sample compositions. This yields {{the question of how}} much the choice of the correction weights affects the adjustments. One might not accept global correction weights instead of country-specific ones, if different configurations of correction weights lead to large differences in the adjustments. Therefore, we conducted robustness checks that provide an empirical basis to evaluate whether global weights are an acceptable approximation for individual countries and samples. <b>As</b> <b>unrealistic</b> weights can lead to extreme adjustments, we suggest three realistic configurations.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we make a}} hermeneutical {{analysis}} of internalism, the dominant tradition {{in the philosophy of}} sports. In order to accomplish this, we identify the prejudices that guide the internalist view of sports, namely the Platonic-Analytic prejudice introduced by Suits, one of the forefathers of internalism. Then, we critically analyze four consequences of following such a prejudice: a) its reductive nature, b) the production of <b>a</b> <b>unrealistic</b> view of sports, c) the vagueness of the idea of excellence; and d) the leap from the descriptive {{analysis of}} the sporting phenomenon to the setting of normative requirements for the practice of sports...|$|R

25|$|Although most Swedish {{officers}} were skeptical about their chances in fighting the {{larger and more}} experienced Russian army, Gustav Adolf had <b>an</b> <b>unrealistic</b> view of Sweden's ability to defend itself against Russia.

25|$|In the United Kingdom, {{the second}} Cameron {{ministry}} {{came under attack}} for their redefinition of poverty; poverty is no longer classified by a family's income, but as to whether a family is in work or not. Considering that two-thirds of people who found work were accepting wages that are below the living wage (according to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation) this has been criticised by anti-poverty campaigners as <b>an</b> <b>unrealistic</b> view of poverty in the United Kingdom.|$|E

The show has also been criticized for <b>an</b> <b>unrealistic</b> portrayal of cooperation between Canadian law enforcement and intelligence agencies, but it is acknowledged this was done in order to avoid making it too complicated for viewers.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of this Supermom ideal, {{cultural}} contradictions of motherhood widely exist. Working mothers are often critiqued for being selfish and not spending enough time with their children. They defend their position by saying they work to support their children economically. Homemakers are often critiqued for not pursuing meaningful careers. They respond by saying that the childcare and other domestic work they do for their families is much more important. Only the unrealistic depiction of the supermom can balance these two ideological extremes, but that ideal is <b>an</b> <b>unrealistic</b> solution for most women.|$|E
25|$|The {{challenge}} for fire didn't come with {{making it look}} realistic, but rather making the fire behave in <b>an</b> <b>unrealistic</b> way that would be believable to the audience. The film that inspired The Last Airbenders fire style was the sixth Harry Potter film, which was re-engineered to reflect two-dimensional simulations. Helman's team referenced images of flames being pushed through the air by giant fans for certain shots needed throughout the film. The team also considered using a meshed image of real and digital fire, but in the end, went with the richer, deeper texture of computer generated flame.|$|E
25|$|The {{results of}} the Austrian trials sparked a wave of {{interest}} in Western Europe and overseas, particularly in the United States, where a similar effort to select a service-wide replacement for the M1911 {{had been going on}} since the late 1970s (known as the Joint Service Small Arms Program). In late 1983, the United States Department of Defense inquired about the Glock pistol and received four samples of the Glock 17 for unofficial evaluation. Glock was then {{invited to participate in the}} XM9 Personal Defense Pistol Trials, but declined because the DOD specifications would require extensive retooling of production equipment and providing 35 test samples in <b>an</b> <b>unrealistic</b> time frame.|$|E

25|$|Task Review: Velocity {{decided to}} set up a Chinese themed stall, selling noodles. Despite {{arguments}} between Mani and the team, their control on costs and good pricing ensured them decent sales throughout the day and a respectable profit, though they failed to sell out. Meanwhile, Invicta focused on pizzas, but their execution of the task was a complete disaster; Tuan made <b>an</b> <b>unrealistic</b> estimate that they could make and sell 500 pizzas, Syed over-ordered on ingredients including buying 100 chickens that used up nearly the entire budget, while the team was disorganised, made few sales in the day and had to greatly reduce prices in the evening. Despite selling out, the issues faced along with infighting between the team, effectively ended any chance of winning the task.|$|E
25|$|In September 2008, Lewes {{launched}} its own currency, the Lewes Pound, {{in an effort}} to increase trade within the town. One Lewes Pound is equal to £1. Like the similar local currency in Totnes, the initiative is part of the Transition Towns movement. The Lewes Pound and the Transition Towns movement have received criticism for a failure {{to address the needs of}} the wider Lewes population, especially lower socio-economic groups. Such local currency initiatives have been more widely criticized in light of limited success stimulating new spending in local economies and as <b>an</b> <b>unrealistic</b> strategy to reduce carbon emissions. The Lewes Pound can be exchanged for the same amount of pounds sterling in several shops in Lewes and can be spent in a wide range of local businesses. Many of the notes were sold on eBay at a higher amount. Early numbers and sequenced notes fetched very high prices from foreign collectors.|$|E
25|$|The {{environmental}} group Riverkeeper {{took note of}} the long-overdue renewal of the plant's discharge permit from the state Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC). In common with Roseton and Indian Point Energy Center, its use of once-through cooling, in which river water was pumped in, used to cool the plant, then pumped out warm, dated to the 1950s and was responsible for large fish kills in the river. A state judge had voided the permit, but it was reversed on appeal. After DEC rebuffed Riverkeeper's effort to force it to accelerate the process, and ruled that closed-cycle cooling, the {{environmental group}}'s preferred alternative, was not feasible at Danskammer, Riverkeeper filed suit against DEC and Dynegy alleging violations of state administrative-procedure law in issuing the new permit. They alleged that DEC had accepted Dynegy's argument that it didn't have space to install closed-cycle cooling despite the company owning large tracts of adjacent vacant land, {{and that it had}} allowed Dynegy to account for its water withdrawals in <b>an</b> <b>unrealistic</b> fashion. Dynegy says there are cheaper alternatives to the cooling towers a closed-cycle system would require.|$|E
