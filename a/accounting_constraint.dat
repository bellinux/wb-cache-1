40|$|When {{a system}} of time series is {{seasonally}} adjusted, generally the accounting constraints originally linking the series are not fulfilled. To overcome this problem, we discuss an extension to {{a system of}} series linked by an <b>accounting</b> <b>constraint</b> of the classical univariate benchmarking procedure due to Denton (1971), which is founded on a movement preservation principle that is very relevant in this case. The presence of linear dependence between the variables makes it necessary to deal with the whole set of contemporaneous and temporal aggregation relationships. The cases of one-way classified (e. g., by regions or by industries) and of two-way classified (e. g., by regions and by industries) systems of series are studied. An empirical application to the Canadian retail trade series by province (12 series) and trade groups (18 series) is considered to show the capability of the proposed procedures.

40|$|Multivariate {{temporal}} disaggregation {{deals with}} the historical reconstruction and nowcasting of economic variables subject to temporal and contemporaneous aggregation constraints. The problem involves a system of time series that are related not only by a dynamic model but also by <b>accounting</b> <b>constraints.</b> The paper introduces two fundamental (and realistic) models that implement the multivariate best linear unbiased estimation approach that has potential application to the temporal disaggregation of the national accounts series. The multivariate regression model with random walk disturbances is most suitable {{to deal with the}} chained linked volumes (as the nature of the national accounts time series suggests); however, in this case the <b>accounting</b> <b>constraints</b> are not binding and the discrepancy has to be modeled by either a trend-stationary or an integrated process. The tiny, compared with other driving disturbances, size of the discrepancy prevents maximum-likelihood estimation to be carried out, and the parameters have to be estimated separately. The multivariate disaggregation with integrated random walk disturbances is suitable for the national accounts aggregates expressed at current prices, in which case the <b>accounting</b> <b>constraints</b> are binding. ...|$|R

40|$|Standard {{presentations of}} stock-flow {{consistent}} modeling use specific Post Keynesian closures, {{even though a}} given stock-flow accounting structure supports various different economic dynamics. In this paper we separate the dynamic closure from the <b>accounting</b> <b>constraints</b> and cast the latter {{in the language of}} graph theory. The graph formulation provides (1) a representation of an economy as a collection of cash flows on a network and (2) a collection of algebraic techniques to identify independent versus dependent cash-flow variables and solve the <b>accounting</b> <b>constraints.</b> The separation into independent and dependent variables is not unique, and we argue that each such separation can be interpreted as an institutional structure or policy regime. Questions about macroeconomic regime change can thus be addressed within this framework. We illustrate the graph tools through application of the simple stock-flow consistent model, or "SIM model," found in Godley and Lavoie (2007). In this model there are eight different possible dynamic closures of the same underlying accounting structure. We classify the possible closures and discuss three of them in detail: the 'standard' Godley-Lavoie closure, where government spending is the key policy lever; an "austerity" regime, where government spending adjusts to taxes that depend on private sector decisions; and a "colonial" regime, which is driven by taxation...|$|R

We propose a decentralized Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme that takes into <b>account</b> <b>constraints</b> on the agent inputs and show that it guarantees consensus under mild assumptions. Since the global cost does not decrease monotonically, it cannot be used as a Lyapunov function for proving consensus. Rather, our proof exploits geometric properties of the optimal path followed by individual agents. I...|$|R

We find that the resultant spin-independent cross sections are smaller in magnitude than those found in recent results obtained within the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model, yet still great enough to feasibly allow for detection {{in the case of}} bino-like neutralinos.

A parity space approach is used for generating testable redundancy relations in which each uncertain parameter is defined by an interval containing all its feasible values.

The objective is to improve fault detection performance by taking into <b>account</b> <b>constraints</b> on variations of uncertain parameters, which do not randomly vary...|$|R

An employment policy distributes income more evenly, and may lead to a union with strong preferences for equality to raise its wage. However, a sufficiently vigorous employment policy is always effective. Unions which maximise the after tax real wage is always lower the nominal wage when government employment policy becomes more vigorous.
