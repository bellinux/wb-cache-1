To his surprise, Greta has started a new {{relationship}} with Milhouse. Greta goes to Canada with Milhouse during her father's movie shooting, and Bart follows them with his family. At the set, Bart confronts Milhouse and they fight, ruining everything. They end up in front of Greta and demand for her to choose between them.

25|$|Another contradicting view of {{the events}} is that General Chakri <b>actually</b> <b>wanted</b> to be King and had accused King Taksin of being Chinese. The late history was aimed at legitimizing the new monarch, Phraya Chakri or Rama I of Rattanakosin. According to Nidhi Eoseewong, a {{prominent}} Thai historian, writer, and political commentator, Taksin {{could be seen as}} the originator, new style of leader, promoting the 'decentralized' kingdom and new generation of the nobles, of Chinese merchants-origin, his major helpers in the wars. On the other hand, Phraya Chakri and his supporters were of 'old' generation of the Ayutthaya nobles, discontent with the previously said changes.|$|E

He didn't care about the actual amount but only about the imagined affront. I once suggested that he and I order what the other <b>actually</b> <b>wanted</b> and, when the food was served, exchange plates.

25|$|The initial {{founding}} was {{symbolized by}} Galt felling a tree on St. George's Day, April 23, 1827, the feast {{day of the}} patron saint of England. The name Guelph comes from the Italian Guelfo and the Bavarian-Germanic Welf. It is a reference to the reigning British monarch at the time Guelph was founded, King George IV, whose family was from the House of Hanover, a younger branch of the House of Welf sometimes spelled as Guelf or Gwelf. The town was named to honour Britain's royal family, the Hanoverians, who were descended from the Guelfs, the ancestral family of George IV, the reigning British monarch; thus the nickname The Royal City. The directors of the Canada Company had <b>actually</b> <b>wanted</b> the city to be named Goderich, because Lord Goderich had helped form the company, but reluctantly accepted the fait accompli.|$|E
25|$|Saladin's fierce {{determination}} to unite Egypt and Syria threatened the crusader states. Raymond mustered the troops of Jerusalem and Tripoli at Arqa in early 1175, {{but did not}} intervene in the conflict between Saladin and the Zengids. The defenders of the Homs citadel offered him to set their Christian prisoners free, if he provided military assistance for them. The prisoners included the hostages who were held as a guarantee for the arrears of Raymond's ransom. Ali ibn al-Athir recorded, the Muslim burghers of Aleppo also urged Raymond to attack Saladin's troops. Raymond was willing to assist the defenders of Homs only if they immediately release their prisoners, but they refused this demand. William of Tyre would later emphasize that the commanders of the crusader army doubted if the defenders of the Homs citadel <b>actually</b> <b>wanted</b> to release their prisoners.|$|E

[...] The critical {{reaction to the}} film was generally negative. Roger Ebert wrote, [...] "The DJ who was hosting the radio station's free preview of Cool World leaped onto the stage and promised the audience: 'If you liked Roger Rabbit, you'll love Cool World!' He was wrong, but you can't blame him—he hadn't seen the movie. I have, and I will now promise {{you that if you}} liked Roger Rabbit, quit while you're ahead." [...] The film was a box-office disappointment. While other film projects followed, Bakshi began to focus more attention on painting.|$|E

500|$|Peter {{planned to}} flee {{again to the}} Holy Roman Empire, but Vazul's son Andrew (who had {{returned}} to Hungary) invited him to a meeting at Székesfehérvár. The deposed king soon realised that Andrew's envoys <b>actually</b> <b>wanted</b> to arrest him. He fled to a fortified manor at Zámoly, but his opponent's supporters seized it and captured him three days later. All 14th-century Hungarian chronicles attest that Peter was blinded, which caused his death. However, the near-contemporary Cosmas of Prague relates that Judith of Schweinfurt, widow of Duke Bretislaus I of Bohemia who was expelled by her son, fled to Hungary and married Peter about 1055 [...] "as an insult to" [...] her son [...] "and all the Czechs". If the latter report is reliable, Peter survived the ordeal and died during the late 1050s. He {{was buried in the}} cathedral of Pécs.|$|E
500|$|One {{point of}} dispute was the {{calculation}} of Malay equity. Although officially, as of 1992, the Malays controlled 18% of the economy, some dismissed this figure as misleading. It was argued that as in reality, much of this amount comprised equity held by government agencies, therefore it belonged to Malaysians as a whole. The practice of awarding public works contracts mainly to Bumiputras was argued to be stifling Malay competency by providing little incentive to improve. Many Bumiputra contractors in turn subcontracted their jobs to others, who were in some cases Chinese; [...] "Ali Baba" [...] arrangements with [...] "the Malay [...] using his privileges to acquire licences and permits denied the non-Malay, then accepting a fee to be the front-man while the non-Malay [...] ran the business," [...] were prevalent.

500|$|As {{part of the}} film's promotion, the Hollywood Sign was {{altered to}} include a 75-foot-tall cutout of Holli Would. The {{alteration}} angered local residents.

The fact that Paramount Pictures donated a mere $27,000 to Rebuild L.A. should not be a passport to exploit women in Los Angeles." [...] Protestors picketed the unveiling of the altered sign. The promotional campaign was focused on the sex appeal of Holli. It was considered by some experts as misaimed, with Paramount's marketing president Barry London saying [...] "Cool World unfortunately did not seem to satisfy the younger audience it was aimed at," [...] and designer Milton Knight recalling that [...] "Audiences <b>actually</b> <b>wanted</b> a wilder, raunchier Cool World.

500|$|Lafayette {{learned that}} the Continental Congress lacked funds for his voyage; hence, he {{acquired}} the sailing ship Victoire with his own money, for 112,000 pounds. He journeyed to Bordeaux, where Victoire was being prepared for her trip, and sent word asking for information on his family's reaction. [...] The response, including letters from his wife and other relatives, threw Lafayette into emotional turmoil. Soon after departure, he ordered the ship turned around and returned to Bordeaux, to the frustration of the officers traveling with him. The army commander there ordered Lafayette to report to his father-in-law's regiment in Marseilles. De Broglie, who hoped to become a military and political leader in America, met with Lafayette in Bordeaux and convinced him that the government <b>actually</b> <b>wanted</b> him to go. This was not true, though there was considerable public support for Lafayette in Paris, where the American cause was popular. Lafayette wanted to believe it, and pretended {{to comply with the}} order to report to Marseilles, going only a few miles east before turning around and returning to his ship. Victoire set sail for the United States on 20 April 1777.|$|E
500|$|After the {{resolution}} of the strike, Lindelof said that the effect of the strike on the fourth season would be minimal and the season's story arc would be completed as originally intended. However, the first draft of the second part of [...] "There's No Place Like Home," [...] was 85 pages long, approximately 30 pages longer than a typical one hour Lost script. Lindelof and Cuse found that they could not compress {{the second half of the}} season finale into one episode and <b>actually</b> <b>wanted</b> to expand it. Subsequently, the show runners went into [...] "advanced talks" [...] with executives at ABC and convinced them to produce one of their episodes [...] "in the bank", thereby extending [...] "There's No Place Like Home: Part 2" [...] to two hours. However, this caused a scheduling problem with Grey's Anatomy and Ugly Betty, which were both already scheduled to air their season finales on May 22, 2008. To allow Lost to have a two-hour finale, ABC moved it one week later to May 29, 2008 and aired both parts of [...] "There's No Place Like Home" [...] back-to-back. Ultimately, this left thirty-four episodes to be split over seasons five and six, which will each have seventeen episodes. Another effect of the strike was that the backstories of the so-called [...] "freighter folk", i.e. Faraday, Miles and Charlotte, had to be pushed back to season five. As such, the writers dropped hints to Charlotte's backstory in [...] "There's No Place Like Home".|$|E

[...] In 2001 Frank co-sponsored [...] "the MX Missile Stand-Down Act" [...] (01-HR2718) to take fifty Peacekeeper missiles off of high-alert status as well as the Landmine Elimination and Victim Assistance Act (01-HR948). As of December 2003, Frank had an 89% rating by Peace Action, indicating a pro-peace voting record. In 2005, he co-sponsored [...] "Rail Security Act" [...] (S.1379/H.R.153) (05-S1379) giving higher priority to rail transportation security. In 2008, he co-sponsored the [...] "Veterans Suicide Study Act" [...] ( [...] (S.2899/H.R.4204) 08-S2899) designed to study and address suicides among veterans. As of the 111th Congress, Frank is advocating a 25-percent reduction in the overall Military budget of the United States. [...] "The math is compelling: if we do not make reductions approximating 25 percent of the military budget starting fairly soon, it will be impossible to continue to fund an adequate level of domestic activity...," [...] wrote Frank. He claimed that such a significant reduction would have no effect on the United States' ability to defend itself. [...] "If," [...] he said, [...] "beginning one year from now, we were to cut military spending by 25 percent from its projected levels, we would still be immeasurably stronger than any combination of nations with whom we might be engaged." [...] Frank supports having fewer F-35 Joint Strike Fighter planes, but also supports a $3-billion backup engine project that the Pentagon does not want. [...] Frank told MSNBC's Keith Olbermann that he <b>actually</b> <b>wanted</b> to cut the entire F-35 program, but as long as military spending continued, he would fight for his district's share of it.|$|E
