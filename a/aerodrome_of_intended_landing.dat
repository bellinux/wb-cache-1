500|$|The assault troops, {{mostly from}} the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC), landed at night on the western (Aegean Sea) side of the peninsula. They were put ashore [...] north <b>of</b> their <b>intended</b> <b>landing</b> beach. In the darkness, the assault {{formations}} became mixed up, but the troops gradually made their way inland, under increasing opposition from the Ottoman Turkish defenders. Not long after coming ashore the ANZAC plans were discarded, and the companies and battalions were thrown into battle piece-meal, and received mixed orders. Some advanced to their designated objectives while others were diverted to other areas, then ordered to dig in along defensive ridge lines.|$|R

50|$|On October 21, Kotov {{returned}} to Earth inside the Soyuz TMA-10 capsule after spending 196 days and 17 hours in space. The TMA-10 spacecraft undocked from the ISS at 07:14 UTC on October 21, and deorbit occurred at 09:47. During atmospheric re-entry, the spacecraft transitioned to a ballistic reentry, resulting in it landing west of Arkalyk, approximately 340 km northwest <b>of</b> the <b>intended</b> Kazakhstan <b>landing</b> site.|$|R

5|$|At Jig, {{the first}} wave of {{infantry}} (the 1st Dorsetshires and 1st Hampshires of the 231st Infantry Brigade) arrived at 07:25, and immediately came under fire from the casemated 75mm gun at Le Hamel. Due to navigation errors and the strong current, both groups came ashore well to the east <b>of</b> their <b>intended</b> <b>landing</b> points. The DD tank and Royal Marine Centaur tanks that were supposed to arrive in advance of the landing were delayed by rough seas and did not arrive until 08:00. Many of the tanks got bogged down on the beach or were taken out by enemy fire. The tide came in quicker than expected, before many of the beach obstacles and mines were cleared, and some of the landing craft were damaged as a result.|$|R
50|$|While many Martian flyby probes {{provided}} an images {{and other data}} about Martian moons Phobos and Deimos, only few <b>of</b> them <b>intended</b> the <b>landing</b> on surface of these satellites. Two probes under Soviet Phobos program were successfully launched in 1988, but in 1989 no conducted due to failures the intended jumping landings on Phobos and Deimos. Post-Soviet Russian Fobos-Grunt probe intended the first sample return mission from Phobos in 2012 but failed after launch in 2011.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, real estate speculators bought most <b>of</b> the <b>land,</b> <b>intending</b> {{to create a}} planned {{development}} similar to the Las Colinas planned development in north Irving.

50|$|The China Clipper {{remained}} in Pan Am service until January 8, 1945, {{when it was}} destroyed in a crash in Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago. Flight 161 had started at Miami bound for Leopoldville in the Belgian Congo making its first stop to refuel at Puerto Rico before flying on to Port of Spain. After making one missed approach on the second approach to land it came down too low and hit the water at a high speed and nose down a mile-and-a-quarter short <b>of</b> its <b>intended</b> <b>landing</b> area. The impact broke the hull in two which quickly flooded and sank. Twenty three passengers and crew were killed while there were seven survivors including Captain C.A. Goyette who was the Pilot in Command of the flight and Captain L.W. Cramer who was acting as First Officer and was flying the plane from the left seat when it crashed.|$|R
50|$|In 1926, {{at the age}} of 66, Joiner {{decided to}} move south, to Texas, believing there was oil in Rusk County, though geologists advised him otherwise. In the summer of 1927, Joiner, now 67 years old, took mineral leases on several {{thousand}} acres <b>of</b> Texas <b>land,</b> <b>intending</b> to sell certificates of interest. As part of that, he leased the 975-acre farm of widow, Daisy Bradford, near Joinerville.|$|R
50|$|On 25 April 1915, {{as part of}} the New Zealand and Australian Division, the New Zealanders {{landed at}} Anzac Cove on the Gallipoli peninsula, and fought in the Gallipoli Campaign under the command of British General Alexander Godley. The {{combined}} British Empire and French operation was mounted in order to eventually capture the Ottoman capital of Constantinople (now Istanbul). Because of a navigational error, the Anzacs came ashore about a mile north <b>of</b> the <b>intended</b> <b>landing</b> point in their initial landing. Instead of facing the expected beach and gentle slope they found themselves at the bottom of steep cliffs, offering the few Turkish defenders an ideal defensive position. Establishing a foothold, the Anzacs found an advance to be impossible. On 30 April 1915, when the first news of the landing reached New Zealand a half-day holiday was declared and impromptu services were held - the origin of the commemorative public holiday, ANZAC Day, recognised by New Zealand and Australia and held each year on 25 April.|$|R
5000|$|Reentry {{came on the}} 62nd revolution. An {{open-loop}} rolling reentry (as used in Mercury) had to be {{used because}} of the computer failure. The astronauts began rolling the spacecraft at 65 nmi km altitude to increase its stability. They started slowing the roll rate at 89,000 ft and stopped it by 39,000 ft. The drogue parachute deployed shortly after this, and the main deployed at 10,600 ft. A malfunctioning thruster caused the roll to be much faster than planned, and the landing was rough. Neither of the crew encountered any problems, however, contrary to NASA doctors' concerns about their landing upright [...] - [...] as opposed to on their backs, as in Mercury [...] - [...] after four days in space. Even though they landed 43 nmi km short <b>of</b> the <b>intended</b> <b>landing</b> target, some ships had already started steaming to the touchdown point and a helicopter {{was able to see}} them land. The prime recovery ship was USS Wasp.|$|R
50|$|For {{the next}} two years, she {{operated}} with various task groups of the 7th Fleet, conducting gunfire support missions {{off the coast of}} Vietnam, patrolling in the Taiwan Straits, and serving in the Gemini Recovery Force. Long experience and training paid off on 17 March 1966 when Gemini VIII splashed down early, southeast of Okinawa, instead <b>of</b> the <b>intended</b> Caribbean <b>landing</b> site. Leonard F. Mason had astronauts Major David Scott, USAF, and Neil Armstrong and their capsule aboard within three hours and headed for Okinawa, where her passengers and cargo were offloaded the next day.|$|R
60|$|She {{accordingly}} embarked, {{with all}} her company, on board the Dutch ship on the very morning after her arrival, and immediately put to sea. They made all sail for the coast <b>of</b> France, <b>intending</b> to <b>land</b> at Dieppe. Dieppe is almost precisely east of Falmouth, two or three hundred miles from it, up the English Channel. As {{it is on the}} other side of the Channel, it would lie to the south of Falmouth, were it not that both the French and English coasts trend here to the northward.|$|R
50|$|State Route 252 was {{intended}} to connect Interstate 5 to Interstate 805. Ramps were constructed on I-805 at 43rd Street before the project was canceled in 1994 due to neighborhood opposition.

40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the current legal {{regulation}} and the {{issues related to the}} <b>land</b> <b>intended</b> to fulfill the functions of a forest. The aim of the thesis is to evaluate the legal regulations and to provide proposals how to solve the deficiencies. The legal framework of this topic - the basis of this thesis is represented mainly by the individual act in this area - the so called Forest Law. In addition, other legal regulations are also presented. Particular terms are gradually introduced and forests are characterized from the point of categorization. The most extensive part of this thesis is the third chapter which focuses on the protection <b>of</b> the <b>land</b> <b>intended</b> to fulfill the functions of a forest and related institutions. The forest is defined as a significant landscape element and a part of natural protected areas. Furthermore, the principle of sustainable development is mentioned and the instruments used for forest's protection are also defined. Moreover, the principles of land revocation and restriction, the institution of public use of forest so as forest guard and other authorities are presented. The last chapter addresses the issue of property and lease relations <b>of</b> the <b>land</b> <b>intended</b> to fulfill the functions of a forest. Also the re-established institution of tenancy is interpreted [...] . ...|$|R
50|$|On 21 October 2007, {{after the}} {{separation}} of the Soyuz TMA-10 capsule, Moscow Mission Control reported that the Soyuz had entered into a ballistic trajectory, which resulted in a landing that was 340 km short <b>of</b> the <b>intended</b> Kazakhstan <b>landing</b> site. Landing occurred without incident, and by 10:55 UTC, all crew members were out of the capsule, and the vehicle was secured. Until then, the only other time a Soyuz landing had resulted in a ballistic trajectory was the landing of Soyuz TMA-1, for Expedition 6. Another ballistic trajectory occurred with the landing of Soyuz TMA-11 on 19 April 2008 for Expedition 16.|$|R
5000|$|When the Railways demanded [...] 3 {{billion for}} a 35-year lease of 4,360 square metres <b>of</b> <b>land</b> <b>intended</b> as the {{location}} of Ernakulam South metro station and other facilities, KMRL officials rejected the offer, as [...] 3 billion worked out to about 8% of the metro project's total cost. The station was instead built on land owned by the Kochi Corporation near Ernakulam Girls' High School, while the Operations Control Centre was built in Muttom. The cost for the station was [...] 100 million.|$|R
5000|$|The {{area was}} founded in 1888. The name [...] "University" [...] (both for the {{neighborhood}} and nearby University Avenue) derives from a plan, originally proposed during the land boom of the 1880s, to build {{a branch of the}} University of Southern California in the area. The plan fell through, and the tract <b>of</b> <b>land</b> <b>intended</b> for the university was later used for the State Normal School (predecessor to San Diego State College). The headquarters of San Diego Unified School District currently occupies the site, near the corner of El Cajon and Park boulevards.|$|R
50|$|There was a {{trade union}} named Asociación de Meretrices Profesionales del Uruguay, created in 1986, which {{comprised}} about 1200 women sex workers affiliates and whose purpose was the cooperation between sex workers, {{the defense of}} their rights, carrying out workshops and promote the prevention of STDs and VIH. Even received support from the UNFPA.

500|$|The craft {{bearing the}} U.S. 4th Infantry Division assaulting Utah were {{pushed by the}} current to a spot about [...] south <b>of</b> their <b>intended</b> <b>landing</b> zone. The troops met light resistance, {{suffering}} fewer than 200 casualties. Their efforts to push inland fell far short of their targets for the first day, but {{they were able to}} advance about , making contact with the 101st Airborne Division. The airborne landings west of Utah were not very successful, as only ten per cent of the paratroopers landed in their drop zones. Gathering the men together into fighting units was made difficult by a shortage of radios and by the terrain, with its hedgerows, stone walls and marshes. The 82nd Airborne Division captured its primary objective at Sainte-Mère-Église and worked to protect the western flank. Its failure to capture the river crossings at the River Merderet resulted in a delay in sealing off the Cotentin Peninsula. The 101st Airborne Division helped protect the southern flank and captured the lock on the River Douve at La Barquette, but did not capture the assigned nearby bridges on the first day.|$|R
5000|$|Archbishop Carroll was {{established}} in 1998 by the Archdiocese of Miami to serve the growing Catholic population in southwest Miami-Dade County.

As of 2008, the school has been administered by the Carmelite Sisters of the Most Sacred Heart of Los Angeles.|$|R
5000|$|The {{flight was}} {{operating}} near sundown which made visibility even worse {{coupled with the}} icy conditions. A fast moving cold front had pushed the icing conditions much further South than had been expected. [...] The pilot instructed the co-pilot to radio Shreveport that {{they would try to}} land the aircraft at nearby Wallace Lake. The aircraft had accumulated too much ice to make Shreveport. At 5:50 PM the Grumman Mallard carrying Thomas Elmer Braniff crashed short <b>of</b> its <b>intended</b> emergency <b>landing</b> spot, into the wooden cabins of a fishing camp that was located on the North Shore of Lake Wallace. Mr. Braniff and the other occupants, the pilot and copilot were killed instantly.|$|R
30|$|Canada is {{also aware}} of the need for a {{definition}} of ‘clean’. For DND MEC-contaminated sites, the determination of ‘clean’ is made by the Explosive Risk Rating Sub-Committee (XRRSC) on a site-by-site basis. The XRRSC is a sub-committee of the UXO Sites Working Group (UXOS WG) chaired by the UXO Program whose members include experts in UXO, munitions, and EOD. The XRRSC determines the overall risk by integrating human interaction factors - to include explosive ordnance exposure pathways and the <b>intended</b> use <b>of</b> the site - and explosive risk probabilities so that appropriate measures to reduce the risk commensurate with the end-use plan for a site can be undertaken [36]. For non-DND sites, the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment has developed a list of guiding principles for determining the numerical soil quality remediation objectives for contaminated sites. Human health, environmental quality, and land use are considered [37]. Furthermore, the CCME encourages remediation of a contaminated site to the lowest level practicable in the context <b>of</b> its <b>intended</b> <b>land</b> use and technological limitations. Where application of these guidelines is not possible, a risk-informed approach is used. In this way, Canada accepts that MEC-contaminated sites cannot be fully remediated and instead focuses on reducing risk, even if that risk is only qualitative.|$|R
40|$|A piloted {{simulation}} {{experiment was}} conducted using the NASA Ames Research Center Vertical Motion Simulator to evaluate two cockpit display formats designed for manual control on steep instrument approaches for a civil transport tiltrotor aircraft. The first display included a four-cue (pitch, roll, power lever position, and nacelle angle movement prompt) flight director. The second display format provided instantaneous {{flight path angle}} information together with other symbols for terminal area guidance. Pilots evaluated these display formats for an instrument approach task which required a level flight conversion from airplane-mode flight to helicopter-mode flight while decelerating to the nominal approach airspeed. Pilots tracked glide slopes of 6, 9, 15 and 25 degrees, terminating in a hover for a vertical landing on a 150 feet square vertipad. Approaches were conducted with low visibility and ceilings and with crosswinds and turbulence, with all aircraft systems functioning normally and were carried through to a landing. Desired approach and tracking performance was achieved with generally satisfactory handling qualities using either display format on glide slopes up through 15 degrees. Evaluations with both display formats for a 25 degree glide slope revealed serious problems with glide slope tracking at low airspeeds in crosswinds and the loss <b>of</b> the <b>intended</b> <b>landing</b> spot from the cockpit field of view...|$|R
50|$|After two aborted attempts, due to stormy weather on {{the night}} of 4/5 June and the {{abandonment}} <b>of</b> the <b>intended</b> <b>landing</b> ground on 5/6 June by the Resistance reception committee because of German patrols, Szabo and three colleagues were dropped by parachute from a USAAF Liberator flown from RAF Harrington onto a landing field near Sussac on the outskirts of Limoges early on 8 June 1944 (immediately following D-Day, and Tania Szabo's second birthday). Szabo was part of a four-person team sent to operate in the departement of Haute Vienne with the circuit code-name 'Salesman II', led by her SOE commander Philippe Liewer (now codenamed Hamlet), whose rolled-up Rouen circuit had been 'Salesman', and including Second Lieutenant Jean-Claude Guiet (codenames Claude and Virgile) of the US Army as wireless operator (W/O), and Bob Maloubier (alias Robert 'Bob' Mortier; codenames Clothaire and Paco), Violette and Liewer's friend and comrade of SOE who was to act as military instructor to the local Maquis, and who had worked as weapons instructor and explosives officer for Liewer on the original Salesman I circuit. For this mission, Szabo's cover was that she was a Mme Villeret, the young widow of an antiques dealer from Nantes. It is possible Szabo had twisted an ankle on landing.|$|R
