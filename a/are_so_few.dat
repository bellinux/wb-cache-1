25|$|Barking geckos {{were common}} in shrublands {{all around the}} Wellington region up until the 1960s and 1970s but populations have {{declined}} enormously since then. DOC has tried to establish populations of this species on Mana Island but there <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>few</b> animals left in wild populations {{in the region that}} they have had to resort to transferring animals taken either from the jaws of pet cats or captive bred animals from private collections. Both the Naultinus released on Mana and a natural population on Kapiti Island have failed to thrive, which is mysterious, because these habitats are rodent free. One suggested cause about which little research has been done is vespid wasp predation, as these insects have been observed killing both adult and baby Naultinus. Naultinus gemmeus are known from the mainland of Southland from a few sightings by members of the public but despite numerous searches in recent years, not a single animal has been sighted or photographed here and it is speculated that this population is either critically endangered or already functionally extinct.|$|E

[...] Borislow attracted {{stars of the}} United States national women's soccer team such as Abby Wambach and Hope Solo with salaries well above the league average of $25,000 per year. Borislow was criticized for discriminatory treatment of lesser-known players. Cat Whitehill, a former player and sports broadcaster said, [...] "There <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>few</b> superstars {{that the majority of}} players can be easily intimidated" [...] She added that the stars [...] "never deliberately meant for the other players on the roster to be treated badly.

500|$|When {{the series}} was {{released}} on DVD, critics remembered it fondly. Video Librarian called Brisco [...] "criminally short-lived" [...] and [...] "wildly entertaining". Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly gave the series an [...] "A-", calling the show [...] "smart-alecky and witty, suspenseful and absurd". IGN DVD called the DVD set [...] "impressive" [...] and said that {{the series was}} [...] "a satisfying show that hits its mark". Auxiliary Magazine called Brisco [...] "one of the greatest sci-fi/Western epics in television history" [...] and compared it favorably to the more well-known sci-fi/Western shows, Firefly and The Wild Wild West. In its 2006 gift guide, the Christian Science Monitor gave Brisco a positive review, saying, [...] "Folks, there <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>few</b> comic sci-fi/Westerns, they should be celebrated, not canceled prematurely." ...|$|E

500|$|Hemingway {{said that}} he learned what he needed as a {{foundation}} for his writing from the style sheet for The Kansas City Star, where he worked as cub reporter. [...] The critic John Aldridge says that the minimalist style resulted from Hemingway's belief that to write authentically, each word had to be carefully chosen for its simplicity and authenticity and carry a great deal of weight. Aldridge writes that Hemingway's style [...] "of a minimum of simple words that seemed to be squeezed onto the page against a great compulsion to be silent, creates the impression that those words—if only because there <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>few</b> of them—are sacramental." [...] In Paris Hemingway had been experimenting with the prosody of the King James Bible, reading aloud with his friend John Dos Passos. From the style of the biblical text, he learned to build his prose incrementally; the action in the novel builds sentence by sentence, scene by scene and chapter by chapter.|$|E
500|$|Mirkin {{directed}} the feature film Romy and Michele's High School Reunion in 1997. The film stars Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow as two friends determined {{to show their}} former high school tormentors at their 10-year reunion that they have led successful lives. Mirkin said of the film: [...] "These are women characters we haven't seen before. There <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>few</b> female buddy movies, written funny for women. Women don't get to do odd, strange, self-involved roles like these." [...] He knew Kudrow previously and felt she was [...] "perfect" [...] for the role, but did not expect Sorvino would take the part given her recent Academy Award win for Mighty Aphrodite, but it [...] "turn out that she'd had a horrible time in high school, so the story appealed to her". The film received critical praise, as did Mirkin's direction. James Berardinelli wrote that Mirkin [...] "brings {{a lot of energy}} to the production, always keeping things moving", while Jack Matthews of The Los Angeles Times says Mirkin [...] "knew exactly what he had here and composed it like frames in a comic strip, ordering cheerful snow-cone colors for everything from the girls' childlike outfits to the decor of a Laundromat".|$|E
500|$|Through his {{association}} with Frank Bridge, Britten's musical horizons expanded. He discovered the music of Debussy and Ravel which, Matthews writes, [...] "gave him a model for an orchestral sound". Bridge also led Britten {{to the music of}} Schoenberg and Berg; the latter's death in 1935 affected Britten deeply. A letter at that time reveals his thoughts on the contemporary music scene: [...] "The real musicians <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>few</b> & far between, aren't they? Apart from the Bergs, Stravinskys, Schoenbergs & Bridges one is a bit stumped for names, isn't one?" [...] – adding, as an afterthought: [...] "Shostakovitch – perhaps – possibly". By this time Britten had developed a lasting hostility towards the English pastoral school represented by Vaughan Williams and Ireland, whose work he compared unfavourably with the [...] "brilliant folk-song arrangements of Percy Grainger"; Grainger became the inspiration of many of Britten's later folk arrangements. Britten was also impressed by Delius, and thought Brigg Fair [...] "delicious" [...] when he heard it in 1931. Also in that year he heard Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, which he found [...] "bewildering and terrifying", {{yet at the same time}} [...] "incredibly marvellous and arresting". The same composer's Symphony of Psalms, and Petrushka were lauded in similar terms. [...] However, he and Stravinsky later developed a mutual antipathy informed by jealousy and mistrust.|$|E

500|$|Coexist {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 79, based on 46 reviews. Garry Mulholland of Uncut dubbed it a [...] "masterpiece", while Rolling Stone magazine's Jody Rosen hailed the xx as [...] "masters of restraint". In his review for the Chicago Tribune, Greg Kot {{felt that the}} album [...] "functions as a near-perfect mood piece" [...] and, [...] "because there <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>few</b> elements in each song," [...] each sound [...] "makes a bigger impact." [...] In The Daily Telegraph, Neil McCormick praised Smith for [...] "somehow widening and deepening the sound without intruding", while Puja Patel of Spin magazine credited him for [...] "both stretching and magnifying the gritty beauty of his vocalists". Writing for MSN Music, Robert Christgau complimented their preoccupation with [...] "young love" [...] and stated, [...] "these scrupulously abstract verses capture its obsessive doubts and fragile exaltations with delicacy and tenderness." [...] Michael Alan Goldberg of The Village Voice called the album [...] "gorgeous" [...] {{and said that the}} music is like a [...] "haiku instead of sonnet; Hemingway rather than Fitzgerald, with meaning and emotion lurking beneath the surface." [...] Simon Price found the group's take on the duet concept highly engaging and emotional while deeming Coexist a greater work than their debut album.|$|E
500|$|Freedom Ring was a {{character}} depicted as gay from his debut by his creator Robert Kirkman. Joe Quesada touted him as Marvel Comics' leading gay hero, with stories dedicated to his adventures in Marvel Team-Up. Despite this, the character was killed one month later. His death and general treatment {{was met with}} some negative reactions, including accusations of homophobia, {{particularly with respect to}} the phallic imagery of the death, with the character being killed by being impaled with spikes. Kirkman commented on the controversy, stating [...] "Freedom Ring was always planned as an inexperienced hero who would get beaten up constantly and probably die. I wanted to comment on the fact that most superheroes get their powers and are okay at it... and that's not how life works. During working on the book, I was also noticing that most gay characters... are all about being gay. Straight characters are well-rounded characters who like chicks. So I wanted to do a well-rounded character who just happened to like dudes. Then I decided to combine the two ideas. In hindsight, yeah, killing a gay character is no good when there <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>few</b> of them... but I really had only the best of intentions in mind." [...] Kirkman later stated, [...] "Frankly, with the SMALL amount of gay characters in comics in general, and how unfortunate the portrayals have been thus far, whether intentional or not—I completely understand the backlash on the death of Freedom Ring, regardless of my intentions. If I had it to do all over again... I wouldn't kill him. I regret it more and more as time goes on. I got rid of what? 20% of the gay characters at Marvel by killing off this ONE character. I just never took that stuff into consideration while I was writing." ...|$|E
500|$|Heigl, who portrayed Stevens, was {{particularly}} critical of her character's relationship with O'Malley, deeming it [...] "a ratings ploy". Heigl further explained her outlook on {{the progression of}} her character, [...] "They really hurt somebody, and they didn't {{seem to be taking}} a lot of responsibility for it. I have a really hard time with that kind of thing. I'm maybe a little too black and white about it. I don't really know Izzie very well right now." [...] Former The Star-Ledger columnist Alan Sepinwall expressed a negative perspective on the episode, deeming it childish and ridiculous. He disliked Rhimes' conception of the story arc involving Stevens, elaborating, [...] "If there's a doctor on this show who should be forced to repeat their intern year, if only to prevent them from being allowed to influence younger doctors, it's Izzie, not George. She proves her unfitness for this role with her first patient of the day, the deer. Not cute, not character-illuminating, just dumb." [...] Also criticized was Torres, whose regression from a [...] "cool, rocking, outgoing, cofident and full of life" [...] role was highlighted, receiving negative feedback from Sepinwall, who wrote [...] "Now the character exists entirely so the writers can dump on her, in a devolution far worse than anything. I just don't get it, and it pains me to watch any scene with Callie in it. Despite expressing a negative outlook on Meredith's story arc which dealt with Shepherd, noting that the [...] "constant break-ups and reunions are as silly as if Shonda Rhimes had just kept them apart for three seasons before letting them kiss", Sepinwall was favorable of Lexie's arrival at Seattle Grace, feeling that [...] "she's still being written as Meredith circa season one in an attempt to make us like her, but I didn't mind the manipulation, if only because there <b>are</b> <b>so</b> <b>few</b> characters left on this show to like." [...] The Buzzsugar television reviewer was mainly critical of the episode, describing it as a departure from [...] "the old show". However, Lexie's introduction was praised in the Buzzsugar review.|$|E
