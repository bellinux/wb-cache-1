40|$|Red {{blood cells}} (RBCs) {{are among the}} most intensively studied cells in natural history, elucidating {{numerous}} principles and ground-breaking knowledge in cell biology. Morphologically, RBCs are largely homogeneous, and most of the functional studies have been performed on large populations of cells, masking putative cellular variations. We studied human and mouse RBCs by live-cell video imaging, which allowed single cells to be followed over time. In particular we analysed functional responses to hormonal stimulation with lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a signalling molecule occurring in blood plasma, with the Ca(2 +) sensor Fluo- 4. Additionally, we developed an approach for analysing the Ca(2 +) responses of RBCs that allowed the quantitative characterization of single-cell signals. In RBCs, the LPA-induced Ca(2 +) influx showed substantial diversity in both kinetics and amplitude. Also the age-classification was determined for each particular RBC and consecutively analysed. While reticulocytes lack a Ca(2 +) response to LPA stimulation, old RBCs <b>approaching</b> <b>clearance</b> generated robust LPA-induced signals, which still displayed broad heterogeneity. Observing phospatidylserine exposure as an effector mechanism of intracellular Ca(2 +) revealed an even increased heterogeneity of RBC responses. The functional diversity of RBCs needs {{to be taken into account}} in future studies, which will increasingly require single-cell analysis approaches. The identified heterogeneity in RBC responses is important for the basic understanding of RBC signalling and their contribution to numerous diseases, especially with respect to Ca(2 +) influx and the associated pro-thrombotic activity...|$|R

2500|$|Assault planning.

Data from many other sources (farmers, spies, informers etc.) was collected and added to this. Detailed mortar ranges to each target area were plotted. A mock-up of the target was created and detailed rehearsals took place. Assaults were usually planned after nightfall. Signalling systems were sometimes devised using colored flares. A typical signal package by the assault teams might be as follows: red flare: area hard to get into; white flare: withdrawal; green followed by white: reinforcements requested; green flare: victory.|$|R
40|$|Individualized drug dosage in {{patients}} treated with continuous hemofiltration. BackgroundSubtherapeutic drug dosing {{may be even}} more dangerous than overdosage, especially for intensive care patients requiring hemofiltration. ProposalAccording to Dettli's fundamental equation, body clearance of any drug (Cl) is a linear function of creatinine clearance (Cl = Cl anur + a · CCr), with [a = (Cl norm - Cl anur) /CCr norm]. We propose to individualize drug dosage during high-flux hemofiltration by basing it on Dettli's equation and on total CCr (CCr tot = CCr ren + CCr filt). Using this <b>approach,</b> drug <b>clearance</b> will eventually be overestimated for drugs with substantial tubular secretion and for high-efficiency hemofiltration (CCr tot > 30 ml/min). ConclusionIn patients undergoing hemofiltration, the total CCr approach might be a practical alternative to standardized dosing schemes for deriving an individualized dosage from published pharmacokinetic data and functions...|$|R
50|$|At {{extremely}} large airports, {{a circuit}} {{is in place}} but not usually used. Rather, aircraft (usually only commercial with long routes) request <b>approach</b> <b>clearance</b> while they are still hours away from the airport, often before they even take off from their departure point. Large airports have a frequency called Clearance Delivery which is used by departing aircraft specifically for this purpose. This then allows aircraft to take the most direct approach path to the runway and land without worrying about interference from other aircraft. While this system keeps the airspace free and is simpler for pilots, it requires detailed knowledge of how aircraft are planning to use the airport {{ahead of time and}} is therefore only possible with large commercial airliners on pre-scheduled flights. The system has recently become so advanced that controllers can predict whether an aircraft will be delayed on landing before it even takes off; that aircraft can then be delayed on the ground, rather than wasting expensive fuel waiting in the air.|$|E
5000|$|The aircraft, {{flying at}} 3000 ft, had been {{vectored}} by Boston's approach control to intercept the final approach course to the ILS runway 4R approach at a 45 degree angle, about 2 nmi km outside the outer marker.

50|$|A pilot may {{accept a}} visual <b>approach</b> <b>clearance</b> {{as soon as}} the pilot has the {{destination}} airport in sight. According to ICAO Doc. 4444, it is enough for a pilot to see the terrain to accept a visual approach. The point is that if a pilot is familiar with the terrain {{in the vicinity of the}} airfield he/she may easily find the way to the airport having the surface in sight. ATC must ensure that weather conditions at the airport are above certain minima (in the U.S., a ceiling of 1000 feet AGL or greater and visibility of at least 3 statute miles) before issuing the clearance. According to ICAO Doc. 4444, it is enough if the pilot reports that in his/her opinion the weather conditions allow a visual approach to be made. In general the ATC gives the information about the weather but it's the pilot who makes a decision if the weather is suitable for landing. Once the pilot has accepted the clearance, he/she assumes responsibility for separation and wake turbulence avoidance and may navigate as necessary to complete the approach visually. According to ICAO Doc. 4444, ATC continues to provide separation between the aircraft making a visual approach and other arriving and departing aircraft. The pilot may get responsible for the separation with preceding aircraft in case he/she has the preceding aircraft in sight and is instructed so by ATC.|$|E
