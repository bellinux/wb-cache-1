50|$|In {{the spring}} of 2004, the {{reconstruction}} of {{the southern part of the}} road was started. In order to meet the general lack of parking space in the district, the City Council of Munich decided, after years of conceptual research, for an unprecedented solution: fully <b>automatic</b> <b>parking</b> <b>garage</b> under the street. In June 2006, the resident parking garage Donnersbergerstraße was finally put into operation with a total of 284 parking spaces. Investments totaled € 11 million and were partially financed through the Munich Aboveground parking lot fees.|$|E

By July 1997, the <b>parking</b> <b>garage</b> at the Anacostia station was usually full by 9 A.M. on a weekday.

Ten years into its operation, the <b>parking</b> <b>garage</b> required refurbishing, but Metro put the project off for a year to pay for other projects. The <b>parking</b> <b>garage</b> was one of 13 in the Metro system which had no waiting list for long-term parking as of February 2004.

40|$|Abstract Unmanned vehicle driving {{systems are}} getting {{interesting}} for the auto mobile industry. One {{of the key}} issues in the unmanned vehicle driving system is how to acquire the current position of the vehicle. In general, it {{can be achieved by}} Global Positioning System (GPS). However, if the unmanned vehicle will be parked in the <b>parking</b> <b>garage</b> by itself, GPS can not provide sufficient information to avoid collisions and the accuracy of GPS is not enough for the narrow <b>parking</b> space. An <b>automatic</b> vehicle <b>parking</b> system is proposed in the paper, where wireless sensor networks and infrared technologies are adopted simultaneously to enhance the accuracy of positioning.

25|$|A major {{controversy}} over parking at the Anacostia station occurred as well. In 1981, Metro had proposed building 1,000 parking spaces in a three-level <b>parking</b> <b>garage</b> and 300 spaces at a ground-level {{parking lot at}} the station and using interstate highway funds to pay for them. Metro officials argued the facility was highway-related, since it provided parking, but the Federal Highway Administration refused to allow the District of Columbia use its funds to pay for the <b>parking</b> <b>garage.</b> Local citizens also opposed the <b>parking</b> <b>garage</b> in favor of ground-level-only parking at the station, and demanded that Metro provide more connecting bus routes at the proposed station. These disagreements were put off as Metro officials and others focused on getting the Green Line built, but by 1985 the <b>parking</b> <b>garage</b> remained part of the station's overall transportation and construction plan. Metro solicited bids for an $11 million contract to build the <b>parking</b> <b>garage</b> in early 1985, but rejected all bids when the lowest bidder failed to meet minority-contracting standards. In May 1985, Metro officials still maintained that construction on the <b>parking</b> <b>garage</b> would begin in June.|$|R
40|$|Arnott and Inci [Arnott, R. and Inci, E., 2006. An {{integrated}} model of downtown parking and traffic congestion. Journal of Urban Economics 60, 418 - 442] developed an {{integrated model}} of curbside parking and traffic congestion {{in a downtown}} area. Curbside parking is exogenously priced below its social opportunity cost, and the stock of cars cruising for parking, which contributes to traffic congestion, adjusts to clear the market for curbside parking spaces. Denser downtown areas have garage as well as curbside parking. Because of economies of scale in garage construction, garages are discretely spaced. The friction of space confers market power on <b>parking</b> <b>garages.</b> Spatial competition between <b>parking</b> <b>garages,</b> as modeled in Arnott [Arnott, R., 2006. Spatial competition between downtown <b>parking</b> <b>garages</b> and downtown <b>parking</b> policy. Transport Policy 13, 458 - 469], determines the equilibrium <b>garage</b> <b>parking</b> fee and spacing between <b>parking</b> <b>garages.</b> Also, the stock of cars cruising for parking adjusts to equalize the full prices of curbside and <b>garage</b> <b>parking.</b> This paper combines the ingredients of these two models, hence presenting an integrated model of curbside <b>parking,</b> <b>garage</b> <b>parking,</b> and traffic congestion, and examines curbside parking policy in this context through a numerical example with parameters representative of a medium-sized US city.
