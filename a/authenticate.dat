5|$|The {{architecture}} of the Windows Push Notification Service {{is similar to that}} of its predecessor, in that it consists of servers and interfaces that generate, maintain, store, and <b>authenticate</b> unique identifiers (called Channel URI Identifiers) for all devices that register to use the service. When a device enrolls to receive data and notification information using the WNS, it first sends a device registration request to WNS network. The WNS network acknowledges the request, and responds with the device's unique Channel URI Identifier. Typically, the device will then send its identifier to a server owned by the developer so that it can be stored and used for sending notifications. When the app developer wishes to transmit a notification or other WNS data to the device, it will transmit a POST request to the WNS network. The network will acknowledge and <b>authenticate</b> the request. If the authentication succeeds, the data to be transmitted is enqueued and then sent to the device from the WNS network using the Channel URI Identifier.|$|E

40|$|The <b>authenticated</b> {{encryption}} scheme {{allows one}} signer to generate an <b>authenticated</b> cipher -text {{so that no}} one except the designated verifier can recover the message and verify the message. In a (t, n) threshold <b>authenticated</b> encryption scheme, any t or more signers can generate an <b>authenticated</b> encryption for a message and send it to the designated verifier. Compared with the conventional encryption-then-signature schemes, threshold <b>authenticated</b> encryption schemes can meet more security requirements, including robustness, confidentiality, unforgeability, integrity, authenticity and non-repudiation. Based on Tseng and Jan’s <b>authenticated</b> encryption scheme and elliptic curve cryptosystem, Chung et al.

5|$|The {{distinction}} between the king's personal household department of the Wardrobe and the governmental department of the Chancery, which was headed by the chancellor, disappeared almost entirely during Burnell's period of office. The Wardrobe had developed as a less formal department for the collection and distribution of money, but under Edward had effectively become a treasury for warfare. There was no rivalry between the holders of the Great Seal, the official seal of government and used for formal documents, and the Privy Seal, used to <b>authenticate</b> the king's less formal letters. During Burnell's time in office the king only used a Privy Seal warrant, or an informal set of instructions for the chancellor to issue {{a letter from the}} Chancery under the Great Seal, when the king and Burnell were apart; after Burnell's death the number of Privy Seal warrants increased greatly.|$|E

The Grand Staircase, which features prominently in the film, was recreated to a high standard of authenticity, though it was widened 30% compared to the original and reinforced with steel girders. Craftsmen from Mexico and Britain sculpted the ornate paneling and plaster-work based on Titanic's original designs. The carpeting, upholstery, individual pieces of furniture, light fixtures, chairs, cutlery and crockery with the White Star Line crest on each piece were among the objects recreated according to original designs. Cameron additionally hired two Titanic historians, Don Lynch and Ken Marschall, to <b>authenticate</b> the historical detail in the film.|$|E
5|$|As well, {{ordinary}} {{middle class}} Dutch people began buying art {{for the first}} time, creating a high demand for paintings of all kinds. This demand was met by enormous painter guilds. Master painters set up studios to produce large numbers of paintings quickly. Under the master's direction, studio members would specialise in parts of a painting, such as figures in landscapes, or costumes in portraits and history paintings. Masters would sometimes add a few touches to <b>authenticate</b> a work mostly done by pupils, to maximise both speed and price. Numerous art dealers organised commissions on behalf of patrons, as well as buying uncommissioned stock to sell on. Landscape artists did not depend on commissions in the way most painters had to do, and could therefore paint for stock. In Ruisdael's case, {{it is not known}} whether he kept stock to sell directly to customers, or sold his work through dealers, or both. Art historians only know of one commission, a work for the wealthy Amsterdam burgomaster Cornelis de Graeff, jointly painted with Thomas de Keyser.|$|E

40|$|We also discuss {{two main}} {{applications}} of concealments {{to the area}} of <b>authenticated</b> encryption. First, following [17, 1], we show that concealment is the right cryptographic primitives enabling one to extend the domain of <b>authenticated</b> encryption. Specifically, let AE be an <b>authenticated</b> encryption scheme (either publicor symmetric-key) 1 designed to work on short messages. Using concealments, we can transform AE into a new <b>authenticated</b> encryption scheme AE 0 on longer messages as follows. To encrypt a longer message m, one uses a concealment scheme to get h and b, and then outputs <b>authenticated</b> ciphertext AE 0 (m) = hAE(b), hi. Second, the above paradigm leads to a very simple and general {{solution to the problem of}} remotely keyed (<b>authenticated)</b> encryption (RKAE) [14, 15], so far primarily studied in the symmetric-key setting. In this problem, one wishes to split the task of high-bandwidth <b>authenticated</b> encryption between a secure, but lowbandwidth/computationally limited device, and an insecure, but computationally powerful host. Following [17], we show that the composition paradigm above gives a provably secure solution for RKAE: for <b>authenticated</b> encryption of m, the host simply sends a short value b to the device (which stores the actual secret key forAE), gets back AE(b), and outputs hAE(b), hi (<b>authenticated</b> decryption is similar). 1 We note that <b>authenticated</b> encryption in the public-key setting is typically calle...|$|R

5|$|The paper {{used for}} the Grolier Codex appears to be {{authentic}} pre-Columbian bark paper dating from the 13th century.

The analysis revealed that only pre-Columbian materials had been used in its creation; no modern inorganic materials were detected. Some inconsistencies were revealed however; cuts along the page edges seem to have been made with a sharp blade in order to give the appearance of natural wear and tear and the supposed water staining did not permeate the paper. The researchers commented that the staining appeared {{to be the result of}} drops of dye or ink being applied to the surface of the codex. In conclusion the researchers were unable to support or refute the pre-Columbian nature of the codex. Unusually for a document that supposedly was stored in a cave for centuries, the paint of the codex still appears fresh.|$|E
