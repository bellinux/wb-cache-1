40|$|About 5 % of Clostridium {{perfringens}} type <b>A</b> <b>isolates</b> {{carry the}} cpe gene encoding the C. perfringens enterotoxin. Those cpe-positive type <b>A</b> <b>isolates</b> are important causes of food-poisoning and non-food-borne cases of diarrheas in humans, {{as well as}} certain veterinary cases of diarrhea. Previous studies have determined that the enterotoxigenic type <b>A</b> <b>isolates</b> causing both non-food-borne human gastrointestinal disease and veterinary disease carry their cpe genes on plasmids, while the type <b>A</b> <b>isolates</b> causing human food poisoning carry a chromosomal cpe gene. The present study reports on the successful development of a duplex PCR assay that can rapidly genotype enterotoxigenic type <b>A</b> <b>isolates</b> (i. e., determine whether those cpe-positive <b>isolates</b> carry <b>a</b> chromosomal or a plasmid-borne cpe gene). The availability of this rapid cpe genotyping assay capable of handling large numbers of samples provides a powerful new investigative tool for diagnostic, epidemiologic, and basic research purposes...|$|R
40|$|Clostridium {{perfringens}} type <b>A</b> <b>isolates</b> causing {{food poisoning}} have a chromosomal enterotoxin gene (cpe), while C. perfringens type <b>A</b> <b>isolates</b> responsible for non-food-borne human gastrointestinal diseases carry a plasmid cpe gene. In the present study, the plasmid cpe locus {{of the type}} <b>A</b> non-food-borne-disease <b>isolate</b> F 4969 was sequenced to design primers and probes for comparative PCR and Southern blot studies of the cpe locus in other type <b>A</b> <b>isolates.</b> Those analyses determined that the region upstream of the plasmid cpe gene is highly conserved among type <b>A</b> <b>isolates</b> carrying <b>a</b> cpe plasmid. The organization of the type A plasmid cpe locus was also found to be unique, as it contains IS 1469 sequences located similarly {{to those in the}} chromosomal cpe locus but lacks the IS 1470 sequences found upstream of IS 1469 in the chromosomal cpe locus. Instead of those upstream IS 1470 sequences, a partial open reading frame potentially encoding cytosine methylase (dcm) was identified upstream of IS 1469 in the plasmid cpe locus of all type <b>A</b> <b>isolates</b> tested. Similar dcm sequences were also detected in several cpe-negative C. perfringens isolates carrying plasmids but not in type <b>A</b> <b>isolates</b> carrying <b>a</b> chromosomal cpe gene. Contrary to previous reports, sequences homologous to IS 1470, rather than IS 1151, were found downstream of the plasmid cpe gene in most type <b>A</b> <b>isolates</b> tested. Those IS 1470 -like sequences reside in about the same position but are oppositely oriented and defective relative to the IS 1470 sequences found downstream of the chromosomal cpe gene. Collectively, these and previous results suggest that the cpe plasmid of many type <b>A</b> <b>isolates</b> originated from integration of a cpe-containing genetic element near the dcm sequences of a C. perfringens plasmid. The similarity of the plasmid cpe locus in many type <b>A</b> <b>isolates</b> is consistent with horizontal transfer of a common cpe plasmid among C. perfringens type A strains...|$|R
