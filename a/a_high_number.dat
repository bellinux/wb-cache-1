5|$|A study {{published}} in 2000 by researchers from the University of Georgia and the US Fish and Wildlife Service looked at data collected between 1986 and 1990 {{in an effort to}} better understand the herd dynamics of the Cumberland Island herd. The study found that band instability was high, with mares not generally forming close relationships with each other and commonly switching which stallion they banded with, and juveniles dispersing quickly. The researchers attributed this to a lack of territory, with bands frequently inhabiting overlapping areas, along with <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>number</b> of bachelor stallions (those without mares). They also saw <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>number</b> of co-dominant stallions, where two or more stallions would lead a band together, and alternate breeding of the band's mares. Foals born on Cumberland Island were less likely to survive than comparable foals in western feral herds, with survival rates of 58.8-61.1% and 80% respectively. This was found to be especially true in animals born after 1 June, which was attributed to higher temperatures, higher insect levels and reduced food availability. The number of horses in the Cumberland bands was comparable to western bands and those on some eastern islands. However, Assateague and Shackleford Banks horses tended to have larger bands, with an average of 8.1 and 12.3 horses per band, respectively.|$|E

However, the second scheme causes <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>number</b> of bit changes during insertions.

40|$|BACKGROUND - Squamous cell carcinomas of {{the skin}} of the bead are better treated with Mobs {{micrographic}} surgery which has the lowest recurrence rates and allows spare normal tissue. There are some characteristics of squamous cell carcinoma that can be related to <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>number</b> of surgical stages. OBJECTIVE - To study characteristic of head squamous cell carcinoma that predicts <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>number</b> of Mohs surgical stages. METHODS - A retrospective analysis of 51 squamous cell carcinomas of the bead treated with Mobs surgery was performed to determine risk factors for <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>number</b> of surgical stages. The characteristics analyzed were clinical limits, morphology, recurrence, histological differentiation and size and compared to the number of surgical stages. The analysis was performed by Fisher`s exact test and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS - The recurrent squamous cell carcinomas showed a tendency for <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>number</b> of stages (p= 0, 081). The Odds Ratio for <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>number</b> of Mobs stages was three for inaccurate limits; although not statistically significant, it corroborates clinical and previous publication. CONCLUSION - Clinical characteristics of squamous cell carcinoma as recurrence and inaccurate limits would not predict, but could indicate tendency of <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>number</b> of Mobs micrographic surgery stages...|$|R

5|$|Based on Z. tonsora, queens {{are similar}} in {{appearance}} to Gerontoformica based on the mandibular structure; these mandibles have two teeth, {{one of which is}} apical (situated closer to the apex) and the other is subapical (below the apex tooth). Other similar body structures include the large ocelli, short scapes, 12 antennomeres (antenna segments), small eyes, and a clypeal margin that has a row of peg-like denticles (small bumps on a tooth). Queens can be distinguished from Gerontoformica by their flattened, broad heads. They have a broad, concave clypeal margin with <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>number</b> of denticles and two short vertical rows of denticles. They have mandibles which are half the length of Gerontoformica and have a dense brush of spicule-like setae. Furthermore, the vertex (the upper surface of the head) has a pair of oval-shaped rugose (wrinkled) patches.|$|E
5|$|Ben Nevis's popularity, {{climate and}} complex {{topography}} contribute to <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>number</b> of mountain rescue incidents. In 1999, for example, there were 41 rescues and four fatalities on the mountain. Some accidents arise over difficulties in navigating {{to or from}} the summit, especially in poor visibility. The problem {{stems from the fact}} that the summit plateau is roughly kidney-shaped and surrounded by cliffs on three sides; the danger is particularly accentuated when the main path is obscured by snow. Two precise compass bearings taken in succession are necessary to navigate from the summit cairn to the west flank, from where a descent can be made on the Pony Track in relative safety.|$|E

5|$|Ganymede is {{composed}} primarily of silicate rock and water ice, and a salt-water ocean {{is believed to}} exist nearly 200km below Ganymede's surface, sandwiched between layers of ice. The metallic core of Ganymede suggests a greater heat {{at some time in}} its past than had previously been proposed. The surface is a mix of two types of terrain—highly cratered dark regions and younger, but still ancient, regions with a large array of grooves and ridges. Ganymede has <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>number</b> of craters, but many are gone or barely visible due to its icy crust forming over them. The satellite has a thin oxygen atmosphere that includes O, O2, and possibly O3 (ozone), and some atomic hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|In October1942, the 9thDivision and the RAAF squadrons in {{the area}} {{took part in the}} Second Battle of El Alamein. After a lengthy period of preparation, the Eighth Army {{launched}} its major offensive on 23October. The 9thDivision was involved in some of the heaviest fighting of the battle, and its advance in the coast area succeeded in drawing away enough German forces for the heavily reinforced 2ndNew Zealand Division to decisively break though the Axis lines on the night of 1/2November. The 9thDivision suffered <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>number</b> of casualties during this battle and did not take part in the pursuit of the retreating Axis forces. During the battle the Australian Government requested that the division be returned to Australia as {{it was not possible to}} provide enough reinforcements to sustain it, and this was agreed to by the British and US governments in late November. The 9thDivision left Egypt for Australia in January1943, ending the AIF's involvement in the war in North Africa.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia {{signed the}} Rio Convention on Biological Diversity on 12 June 1993, {{and became a}} party to the {{convention}} on 24 June 1994. It has subsequently produced a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, which was received by the convention on 16 April 1998. The country is megadiverse with <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>number</b> of species and high levels of endemism. It is estimated to contain 20percent of the world's animal species. High levels of endemism are found on the diverse forests of Borneo's mountains, as species are isolated from each other by lowland forest. There are about 210 mammal species in the country. Over 620 species of birds have been recorded in Peninsular Malaysia, with many endemic to the mountains there. <b>A</b> <b>high</b> <b>number</b> of endemic bird species are also found in Malaysian Borneo. 250 reptile species have been recorded in the country, with about 150 species of snakes and 80 species of lizards. There are about 150 species of frogs, and thousands of insect species. Malaysia's exclusive economic zone is 1.5 times larger than its land area, and some of its waters are in the Coral Triangle, a biodiversity hotspot. The waters around Sipadan island are the most biodiverse in the world. Bordering East Malaysia, the Sulu Sea is a biodiversity hotspot, with around 600 coral species and 1200 fish species. The unique biodiversity of Malaysian Caves always attracts lovers of ecotourism from all over the world.|$|E

5|$|The Lineweaver {{team also}} {{analyzed}} {{the evolution of}} the galactic habitable zone with respect to time, finding, for example, that stars close to the galactic bulge had to form within a time window of about two billion years in order to have habitable planets. Before that window, galactic-bulge stars would be prevented from having life-sustaining planets from frequent supernova events. After the supernova threat had subsided, though, the increasing metallicity of the galactic core would eventually mean that stars there would have <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>number</b> of giant planets, with the potential to destabilize star systems and radically alter the orbit of any planet located in a star's circumstellar habitable zone. Simulations conducted in 2005 at the University of Washington, however, show that even in the presence of hot Jupiters, terrestrial planets may remain stable over long timescales.|$|E
