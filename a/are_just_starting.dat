5|$|The {{development}} team {{wanted to}} introduce a new talent agency that would be separate from 765 Pro to better suit {{the details of the}} story, such as how the idols at 876 Pro <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> out while the idols at 765 Pro already have an establish fanbase. Tanaka would go on to say that the scenario in Dearly Stars would not have worked without having a different company president—in this case, the president of 876 Pro, Minori Ishikawa. The gameplay was adjusted to allow the player the option to quickly play through the game's story. However, Kujioka also wanted to add in gameplay elements that would add another layer of challenge, such as the introduction of the choreography panel to make adjustments to an idol's dance sequence or the positioning and manipulation of in-game cameras. The staff also altered how the lessons and auditions operate in Dearly Stars compared to previous games in the series, which also modified the game's degree of difficulty.|$|E
25|$|Drum {{bags are}} made from robust cloth such as cordura or from cloth-backed vinyl. They give minimal {{protection}} from bumps and impacts, but they do protect drums and cymbals from precipitation. They are adequate for drums transported in private vehicles to go to local gigs and sessions. They are often the only option for young drummers who <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> out.|$|E
500|$|When {{writing the}} story, the staff wanted to {{incorporate}} Hibiki Ganaha and Takane Shijō, {{who had already}} been introduced in The Idolmaster SP, but because the two games were being developed simultaneously, Hibiki's and Takane's role in the main story of Dearly Stars was kept to a minimum. For the dance sequences during performances, Kujioka chose to employ talent star Fumi Sakura, as opposed to professional dancers who {{had been used in}} The Idolmaster games up to that point. Kujioka wanted the dance sequences to be closer to what he calls an [...] "idol's aura"—a certain emotional charm that is not a part of an idol's skill at dancing, according to him. Also, because of the idols in Dearly Stars are young and <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> out, Kujioka told Sakura to purposefully mess up some dance portions to reflect this inexperience.|$|E

500|$|According to the Los Angeles Times, Lewis was {{inspired}} by house parties at Jonathan Wilson's Laurel Canyon home. [...] "We'd go to these jams in the canyon. They're fantastic. Jonathan invites older session musicians from the real Laurel Canyon era, and younger people who <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> their bands who happen {{to live in the}} canyon, and we all get together and sing Grateful Dead covers and J. J. Cale songs." [...] Lewis herself has said that it [...] "rocks a little harder," [...] in contrast to Rabbit Fur Coats folk rock influences. Lewis also used Rilo Kiley's Under the Blacklight, which was notably polished compared to the band's earlier work, [...] "as a reference point to go in the complete opposite direction". She explained that every song she writes is [...] "a response to the thing that I've written before". [...] "It's even as simple as, 'OK, I've written a ballad, now I want to push myself to write something that's up tempo.' If I'm writing about myself, well, that subject can be tiresome, so then I focus on character-driven songs. So I'm always doing this back-and-forth just to keep myself interested." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the hey-day of ENIAC, proper notoriety escaped Kay and {{her fellow}} 'computers'. The invisibility of [...] "The Refrigerator Ladies" [...] (both from being women and the secrecy of their work, {{especially}} during the war) kept them from the public eye. Now, many years later, their contributions <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> to be justly recognized. In 2010, a documentary called, [...] "" [...] was released. The film centered around in-depth interviews of 3 of the six women programmers, focusing on the commendable patriotic, contributions they made during World War II.|$|E
2500|$|Two new {{categories}} of content were introduced during the patch cycle of Heavensward, post-launch: Exploratory Missions and Deep Dungeon. Exploratory Missions {{are designed to}} emulate the feel of [...] "first generation" [...] MMORPGs in which players hunted notorious monsters in the field with hidden spawn conditions. It also fills {{a gap in the}} game's content repertoire for huge-scale battles with extremely large numbers of players. However, it was not well-received at launch because of the simplicity of its battle mechanics, the repetitive nature of the gameplay loop, and the randomness of the loot drops which were not tied to skill or effort spent. Deep Dungeon is a roguelike randomly generated instance, inspired by Chocobo Mystery Dungeon. Yoshida wanted to allow veteran players to party with their friends who <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> out more quickly; as such, characters are temporarily reset to level one upon entering and level quickly back to the maximum {{over the course of the}} first 50 floors. The first section is considered casual content but reaching the 200th floor is intended as a challenge for hardcore players.|$|E

Graham and Khan lobbied SOM partners to purchase a mainframe computer, a risky investment at a time, when new technologies <b>were</b> <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> to form. The partners agreed, and Khan began programming the system to calculate structural engineering equations, and later, to develop architectural drawings.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the stages}} of [...] "self awareness", he or she realizes their desires related to BDSM {{scenarios}} or decides to be open for such. Some authors call this internal coming-out. Two separate surveys on this topic independently {{came to the conclusion}} that 58 percent and 67 percent of the sample respectively, had realized their disposition before their 19th birthday. Other surveys on this topic show comparable results. Independent of age, coming-out can potentially result in a difficult life crisis, sometimes leading to thoughts or acts of suicide. While homosexuals have created support networks in the last decades, sadomasochistic support networks <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> to develop in most countries. In German speaking countries they are only moderately more developed. The Internet is the prime contact point for support groups today, allowing for local and international networking. In the US Kink Aware Professionals (KAP) a privately funded, non-profit service provides the community with referrals to psychotherapeutic, medical, and legal professionals who are knowledgeable about and sensitive to the BDSM, fetish, and leather community. In the US and the UK, the Woodhull Freedom Foundation & Federation, National Coalition for Sexual Freedom (NCSF) and Sexual Freedom Coalition (SFC) have emerged to represent the interests of sadomasochists. The German Bundesvereinigung Sadomasochismus e.V. is committed to the same aim of providing information and driving press relations. In 1996 the website and mailing list Datenschlag went online in German and English providing the largest bibliography, as well as one of the most extensive historical collections of sources related to BDSM.|$|E
2500|$|IGN {{described}} her [...] "a great character for {{any level of}} player" [...] of Dead or Alive 2 as [...] "novices will certainly enjoy her easy mechanics, while master players will find {{some of the most}} evil combinations in the game with Kasumi." [...] According to Andrew Alfonso's GameSpy guide to Dead or Alive Ultimate, Kasumi's key moves include high kicks and a cartwheel attack, which is perfect against low attackers. Kasumi's preferred and recommended tag team partner is Ryu Hayabusa. GameSpy's Chau wrote that in DOA3, [...] "Kasumi's got some very good long-range attacks; combined with her speed and she's able to hit opponents from a good distance away," [...] especially since many of her attacks can stun with one hit, allowing her [...] "to deliver her great punch and kick combinations, regarded by some as being the best in the game," [...] that are exceptionally dangerous since many of them end in a powerful launching attack. In addition, [...] "to balance her great speed and superb punch-kick combination game, Kasumi also can throw with the best of them." [...] Chau opined Kasumi is a good tag team partner for any fighter, but in particular for Ryu, Bass, Helena and Ayane. GamesRadar US recommended that DOA3 [...] "beginners should start with Kasumi because she's got some nice combos". According to Bryan Dawson in Prima Games' official guide for Dead or Alive 4, this game's Kasumi is [...] "faster than ever" [...] and her techniques have been modified considerably; she was ranked overall 8/10, while her clone Alpha-152 was ranked 10/10. In GameSpy's guide to DOA4, David McCutcheon wrote that [...] "Kasumi is a very well-rounded character that is diverse in usefulness," [...] that she [...] "can be a pure powerhouse character outside of her looks that will certainly drive the point across even to the most defensive of fighters," [...] and that novice players might especially appreciate her very accessible high combos. In an official description of Kasumi in Dead or Alive 5, she uses [...] "beautiful yet varied attacks executed at a high speed that few can guard against." [...] Dean James from Attack of the Fanboy recommended her especially [...] "for those who haven’t played the series in the past and <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>starting</b> with Dead or Alive 5 Last Round" [...] for her [...] "probably the most balanced setup in the series." ...|$|E
