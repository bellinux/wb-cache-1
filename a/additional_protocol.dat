25|$|Iran {{agreed to}} {{implement}} the <b>Additional</b> <b>Protocol</b> {{under the terms of}} the October 2003 Tehran agreement and its successor, the November 2004 Paris agreement, and did so for two years before withdrawing from the Paris agreement in early 2006 following the breakdown of negotiations with the EU-3. Since then, Iran has offered not only to ratify the <b>Additional</b> <b>Protocol,</b> but to implement transparency measures on its nuclear program that exceed the <b>Additional</b> <b>Protocol,</b> as long as its right to operate an enrichment program is recognized. The UN Security Council, however, insists that Iran must suspend all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities, and the United States explicitly ruled out the possibility that it would allow Iran to produce its own nuclear fuel, even under intense international inspection.|$|E

25|$|Another {{source of}} {{conflict}} has been Brazil’s refusal {{to sign the}} <b>Additional</b> <b>Protocol</b> (AP), a voluntary legal instrument that complements comprehensive safeguards agreements and provides the IAEA broader rights of access to sites. Despite the pressures coming from the IAEA and some nuclear weapon states that consider the AP a fundamental instrument of the verification regime, Brazil has strongly opposed it.|$|E
50|$|With the {{adoption}} of the 1977 <b>Additional</b> <b>Protocols</b> to the Geneva Conventions, the two strains of law began to converge, although provisions focusing on humanity could already be found in the Hague law (i.e. the protection of certain prisoners of war and civilians in occupied territories). The 1977 <b>Additional</b> <b>Protocols,</b> relating to the protection of victims in both international and internal conflict, not only incorporated aspects of both the Law of The Hague and the Law of Geneva, but also important human rights provisions.|$|R

25|$|On 4 February 2006, the 35 member Board of Governors of the IAEA voted 27–3 (with five abstentions: Algeria, Belarus, Indonesia, Libya and South Africa) {{to report}} Iran to the UN Security Council. The measure was {{sponsored}} by the United Kingdom, France and Germany, and it was backed by the United States. Two permanent council members, Russia and China, agreed to referral only on condition that the council take no action before March. The three members who voted against referral were Venezuela, Syria and Cuba. In response, on 6 February 2006, Iran suspended its voluntary implementation of the <b>Additional</b> <b>Protocol</b> and all other voluntary and non-legally binding cooperation with the IAEA beyond what is required by its safeguards agreement.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} infamous secret {{treaties}} in history was the secret <b>additional</b> <b>protocol</b> to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of August 23, 1939 between Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, negotiated by Soviet foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov and German foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop. The pact itself, a ten-year nonaggression agreement, was public, but the Additional Secret Protocol (superseded by a similar subsequent secret protocol, the German-Soviet Frontier Treaty, the next month) carved up spheres of influence in Eastern Europe between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, placing Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Bessarabia (part of Romania), and eastern Poland in the Soviet sphere, and western Poland and Lithuania in the German sphere. The existence of the secret protocol was not revealed until 1989; when it became public, it caused outrage in the Baltic states.|$|E

50|$|The current revised {{convention}} is that signed in Strasbourg by the {{five members of}} the commission and the United Kingdom on 20 November 1963 and brought into force on 14 April 1967. There have since been <b>additional</b> <b>protocols.</b>|$|R
25|$|To address {{concerns}} that its enrichment program may be diverted to non-peaceful uses, Iran {{has offered to}} place additional restrictions on its enrichment program including, for example, ratifying the <b>Additional</b> <b>Protocol</b> to allow more stringent inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency, operating the uranium enrichment facility at Natanz as a multinational fuel center with the participation of foreign representatives, renouncing plutonium reprocessing and immediately fabricating all enriched uranium into reactor fuel rods. Iran's offer to open its uranium enrichment program to foreign private and public participation mirrors suggestions of an IAEA expert committee which was formed to investigate the methods {{to reduce the risk}} that sensitive fuel cycle activities could contribute to national nuclear weapons capabilities. Some non-governmental U.S. experts have endorsed this approach. The United States has insisted that Iran must meet the demands of the UN Security Council to suspend its enrichment program.|$|E
25|$|In the {{elections}} held on 5 July 1928, Venizelos' party regained power {{and forced the}} government to hold new elections on 19 August of the same year; this time his party won 228 out of 250 places in Parliament. During this period Venizelos attempted to end Greece's diplomatic isolation by restoring normal relations with the country's neighbors. His efforts proved {{to be successful in}} the cases of the newly founded Kingdom of Yugoslavia and Italy. Firstly Venizelos signed an agreement on 23 September 1928 with Benito Mussolini in Rome, and then he started negotiations with Yugoslavia which resulted in a Treaty of Friendship signed on 27 March 1929. An <b>additional</b> <b>protocol</b> settled the status of the Yugoslav free trade zone of Thessaloniki in a way favorable to Greek interests. Nevertheless, despite the co-ordinated British efforts under Arthur Henderson in 1930–1931, full reconciliation with Bulgaria was never achieved during his premiership. Venizelos was also cautious towards Albania, and although bilateral relations remained at a good level, no initiative was taken by either side aiming at the final settlement of the unresolved issues (mainly related with the status of the Greek minority of South Albania).|$|E
25|$|The Iranian {{government}} has repeatedly made compromise offers to place strict limits on {{its nuclear program}} beyond what the Non-Proliferation Treaty and the <b>Additional</b> <b>Protocol</b> legally require of Iran, {{in order to ensure}} that the program cannot be secretly diverted to the manufacture of weapons. These offers include operating Iran's nuclear program as an international consortium, with the full participation of foreign governments. This offer by the Iranians matched a proposed solution put forth by an IAEA expert committee that was investigating the risk that civilian nuclear technologies could be used to make bombs. Iran has also offered to renounce plutonium extraction technology, thus ensuring that its heavy water reactor at Arak cannot be used to make bombs either. More recently, the Iranians have reportedly also offered to operate uranium centrifuges that automatically self-destruct if they are used to enrich uranium beyond what is required for civilian purposes. However, despite offers of nuclear cooperation by the five permanent members of the UN Security Council and Germany, Iran has refused to suspend its enrichment program as the Council has demanded. Iran's representative asserted that dealing with the issue in the Security Council was unwarranted and void of any legal basis or practical utility because its peaceful nuclear program posed no threat to international peace and security, and, that it ran counter to the views of the majority of United Nations Member States, which the Council was obliged to represent.|$|E

2500|$|France, Germany and the United Kingdom (the EU-3) {{undertook}} a diplomatic initiative with Iran to resolve questions about its nuclear program. On 21 October 2003, in Tehran, the Iranian government and EU-3 Foreign Ministers {{issued a statement}} known as the Tehran Declaration in which Iran agreed to co-operate with the IAEA, to sign and implement an <b>Additional</b> <b>Protocol</b> as a voluntary, confidence-building measure, and to suspend its enrichment and reprocessing activities {{during the course of}} the negotiations. The EU-3 in return explicitly agreed to recognize Iran's nuclear rights and to discuss ways Iran could provide [...] "satisfactory assurances" [...] regarding its nuclear power program, after which Iran would gain easier access to modern technology. Iran signed an <b>Additional</b> <b>Protocol</b> on 18 December 2003, and agreed to act as if the protocol were in force, making the required reports to the IAEA and allowing the required access by IAEA inspectors, pending Iran's ratification of the <b>Additional</b> <b>Protocol.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Just {{a couple}} of months before ElBaradei took office, the Model <b>Additional</b> <b>Protocol</b> was adopted, [...] {{creating}} a new environment for IAEA verification by giving it greater authority to look for undeclared nuclear activities. When in office, ElBaradei launched a program to establish [...] "integrated safeguards" [...] combining the IAEA’s comprehensive safeguard agreements with the newly adopted <b>Additional</b> <b>Protocol.</b> In his statement to the General Conference in 1998, he called upon all states to conclude the Additional Protocol: [...] "One of the main purposes of the strengthened-safeguards system can be better achieved with global adherence. I would, therefore, urge all states with outstanding-safeguards agreements to conclude them, and I would also urge all states to accelerate their consideration of the Model <b>Additional</b> <b>Protocol</b> and enter into consultations with the Agency at the earliest possible opportunity. We should work together to ensure that, by the year 2000, all states [...] have concluded outstanding-safeguards agreements and also the Additional Protocol." [...] ElBaradei repeated this call through his years as the Director General of the IAEA. In November 2009, 93 countries had Additional Protocols in force.|$|E
