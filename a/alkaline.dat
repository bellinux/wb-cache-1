5|$|In nature, uranium(VI) forms highly soluble {{carbonate}} complexes at <b>alkaline</b> pH. This {{leads to}} an increase in mobility and availability of uranium to groundwater and soil from nuclear wastes which leads to health hazards. However, it is difficult to precipitate uranium as phosphate in the presence of excess carbonate at <b>alkaline</b> pH. A Sphingomonas sp. strain BSAR-1 has been found to express a high activity <b>alkaline</b> phosphatase (PhoK) that has been applied for bioprecipitation of uranium as uranyl phosphate species from <b>alkaline</b> solutions. The precipitation ability was enhanced by overexpressing PhoK protein in E. coli.|$|E
5|$|Being {{the second}} period 8 element, unbinilium is {{predicted}} to be an <b>alkaline</b> earth metal, below beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, and radium. Each of these elements has two valence electrons in the outermost s-orbital (valence electron configuration ns2), which is easily lost in chemical reactions to form the +2 oxidation state: thus the <b>alkaline</b> earth metals are rather reactive elements, {{with the exception of}} beryllium due to its small size. Unbinilium is predicted to continue the trend and have a valence electron configuration of 8s2. It is therefore expected to behave much like its lighter congeners; however, it is also predicted to differ from the lighter <b>alkaline</b> earth metals in some properties.|$|E
5|$|In both localities, B.epica occurs among heath on cliff-top dunes of deep, white {{siliceous}} sand over limestone. It co-occurs with B.media in both localities, and B.praemorsa is {{also present}} at Point Culver. Toolinna Cove sand is somewhat <b>alkaline,</b> making B.epica and B.media the only Banksia species that grow in <b>alkaline</b> soil.|$|E
5|$|Manganese {{phosphating}} is {{used for}} rust and corrosion prevention on steel. Ionized manganese is used industrially as pigments of various colors, which depend on the oxidation state of the ions. The permanganates of alkali and <b>alkaline</b> earth metals are powerful oxidizers. Manganese dioxide is used as the cathode (electron acceptor) material in zinc-carbon and <b>alkaline</b> batteries.|$|E
5|$|Nickel foam or nickel mesh {{is used in}} gas {{diffusion}} electrodes for <b>alkaline</b> fuel cells.|$|E
5|$|The Ubn–Au bond {{should be}} the weakest of all bonds between gold and an <b>alkaline</b> earth metal, but should still be stable. This gives {{extrapolated}} medium-sized adsorption enthalpies (−ΔHads) of 172kJ·mol−1 on gold (the radium value should be 237kJ·mol−1) and 50kJ·mol−1 on silver, the smallest of all the <b>alkaline</b> earth metals, that demonstrate {{that it would be}} feasible to study the chromatographic adsorption of unbinilium onto surfaces made of noble metals. The ΔHsub and −ΔHads values are correlated for the <b>alkaline</b> earth metals.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth oxide, in its delta form, {{is a solid}} {{electrolyte}} for oxygen. This form normally breaks down below a high-temperature threshold, but can be electrodeposited well below this temperature in a highly <b>alkaline</b> solution.|$|E
5|$|Boron nitride is {{insoluble}} in {{the usual}} acids, but is soluble in <b>alkaline</b> molten salts and nitrides, such as LiOH, KOH, NaOH-Na2CO3, NaNO3, Li3N, Mg3N2, Sr3N2, Ba3N2 or Li3BN2, which are therefore used to etch BN.|$|E
5|$|Hapalopilus nidulans {{is highly}} {{appreciated}} {{by those who}} make mushroom dyes. When used in combination with <b>alkaline</b> fixatives, the fruit bodies can produce striking violet colors.|$|E
5|$|His {{two best}} known {{contributions}} were {{his work on}} the Clinton iron ore and a 1927 monograph about the origins of <b>alkaline</b> igneous rocks.|$|E
5|$|Other archaea {{exist in}} very acidic or <b>alkaline</b> conditions. For example, {{one of the}} most extreme archaean acidophiles is Picrophilus torridus, which grows at pH0, which is {{equivalent}} to thriving in 1.2molar sulfuric acid.|$|E
5|$|Other {{products}} of hydrolysis include the trimeric ion 3+. Beryllium hydroxide, Be(OH)2, is insoluble even in acidic solutions with pH less than 6, {{that is at}} biological pH. It is amphoteric and dissolves in strongly <b>alkaline</b> solutions.|$|E
5|$|The {{invention}} of the Leclanché cell in 1866 and the subsequent improvement of the batteries containing manganese dioxide as cathodic depolarizer increased the demand of manganese dioxide. Until the development batteries with nickel-cadmium and lithium, most batteries contained manganese. The zinc-carbon battery and the <b>alkaline</b> battery normally use industrially produced manganese dioxide because natural occurring manganese dioxide contains impurities. In the 20th century, manganese dioxide was widely used as the cathodic for commercial disposable dry batteries of both the standard (zinc-carbon) and <b>alkaline</b> types.|$|E
5|$|The same {{material}} also functions in newer <b>alkaline</b> batteries (usually battery cells), which {{use the same}} basic reaction, but a different electrolyte mixture. In 2002, more than 230,000tons of manganese dioxide was used for this purpose.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of {{additional}} alkali and <b>alkaline</b> neptunium oxide compounds such as Cs4Np5O17 and Cs2Np3O10 have been characterized with various production methods. Neptunium has also been observed to form ternary oxides with many additional elements in groups 3 through 7, although these compounds are much less well studied.|$|E
5|$|A model {{suggests}} that Enceladus's salty ocean (-Na, -Cl, -CO3) has an <b>alkaline</b> pH of 11 to 12. The high pH is interpreted to be {{a consequence of}} serpentinization of chondritic rock {{that leads to the}} generation of H2, a geochemical source of energy that can support both abiotic and biological synthesis of organic molecules such as those that have been detected in Enceladus's plumes.|$|E
5|$|Alkali metals form ionic {{and highly}} soluble monofluorides; these have the cubic {{arrangement}} of sodium chloride and analogous chlorides. <b>Alkaline</b> earth difluorides possess strong ionic bonds but are insoluble in water, {{with the exception}} of beryllium difluoride, which also exhibits some covalent character and has a quartz-like structure. Rare earth elements and many other metals form mostly ionic trifluorides.|$|E
5|$|B.epica {{is fairly}} new to cultivation. Kevin Collins of the Banksia Farm in Albany, Western Australia {{is said to}} have pioneered its cultivation, growing it in loamy clay or sandy gravel. It showed good {{tolerance}} for <b>alkaline</b> soils in those conditions, and has also succeeded in sandy, <b>alkaline</b> soil near the coast between Mandurah and Kwinana. The Australian National Botanic Gardens in Canberra has also had some success in cultivating the species. Seeds were sown in February 1996, and planted out in November 1997; seedlings planted into sections without good drainage died, but two seedlings that were planted into a section with excellent drainage were about a metre tall by 2002, and flowering prolifically.|$|E
5|$|Barium is a {{chemical}} element with symbolBa and atomic number56. It {{is the fifth}} element in group 2 and is a soft, silvery <b>alkaline</b> earth metal. Because of its high chemical reactivity, barium is never found in nature as a free element. Its hydroxide, known in pre-modern history as baryta, does not occur as a mineral, but can be prepared by heating barium carbonate.|$|E
5|$|During a 2004 {{assessment}} of Texas waterways, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality found {{higher than normal}} levels of bacteria {{at the mouth of}} Carancahua Creek and <b>alkaline</b> pH levels, symptomatic of algal bloom. The issues discovered by the Commission were common in the water bodies examined for the study, and they noted that such issues would be addressed.|$|E
5|$|Glacial {{acetic acid}} {{is used in}} {{analytical}} chemistry for the estimation of weakly <b>alkaline</b> substances such as organic amides. Glacial acetic acid is a much weaker base than water, so the amide behaves as a strong base in this medium. It then can be titrated using a solution in glacial acetic acid of a very strong acid, such as perchloric acid.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, a {{study was}} done on the pH of the waters of Nescopeck Creek and its tributaries. At three sites, its pH {{averaged}} 5.06, 4.85, and 4.49. However, the pH at Nescopeck Creek's headwaters is between 6.5 and 7. The lowest pH level in the Nescopeck Creek watershed is 4.2, which is on some parts of Black Creek. Creasy Creek is the most <b>alkaline</b> tributary of Nescopeck Creek, with a pH ranging from 6.9 to 7.2. Other relatively <b>alkaline</b> streams in the creek's watershed include Long Run (6.6), Reilly Creek (6.4), Long Hollow (6.4), Oley Creek (6.4), Conety Run (6.2), and Little Nescopeck Creek A (5.8 to 7). Brook trout are able to tolerate pHs down to 4.8 and the ideal pH range for freshwater fish is 6.5 to 9.0.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, 86% of cadmium {{was used}} in batteries, {{predominantly}} in rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries. Nickel-cadmium cells have a nominal cell potential of 1.2V. The cell consists of a positive nickel hydroxide electrode and a negative cadmium electrode plate separated by an <b>alkaline</b> electrolyte (potassium hydroxide). The European Union put a limit on cadmium in electronics in 2004 of 0.01%, with some exceptions, and reduced the limit on cadmium content to 0.002%.|$|E
5|$|Indium {{is one of}} many {{substitutes}} for mercury in <b>alkaline</b> batteries to prevent the zinc from corroding and releasing hydrogen gas. Indium is added to some dental amalgam alloys to decrease the surface tension of the mercury and allow for less mercury and easier amalgamation.|$|E
5|$|Lithium is {{corrosive}} {{and requires}} special handling to avoid skin contact. Breathing lithium dust or lithium compounds (which are often <b>alkaline)</b> initially irritate {{the nose and}} throat, while higher exposure can cause a buildup of fluid in the lungs, leading to pulmonary edema. The metal itself is a handling hazard because contact with moisture produces the caustic lithium hydroxide. Lithium is safely stored in non-reactive compounds such as naphtha.|$|E
5|$|Only a few {{compounds}} with metals {{have been}} reported, {{in the form}} of astatides of sodium, palladium, silver, thallium, and lead. Some characteristic properties of silver and sodium astatide, and the other hypothetical alkali and <b>alkaline</b> earth astatides, have been estimated by extrapolation from other metal halides.|$|E
5|$|Psilocybin (O-phosphoryl-4-hydroxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine, 4-PO-Psilocin, or 4-PO-HO-DMT) is a prodrug that is {{converted}} into the pharmacologically active compound psilocin {{in the body}} by a dephosphorylation reaction. This chemical reaction takes place under strongly acidic conditions, or under physiological conditions in the body, through the action of enzymes called <b>alkaline</b> phosphatases.|$|E
5|$|Rise Against began a U.S. {{tour with}} Thrice, <b>Alkaline</b> Trio, and The Gaslight Anthem {{to promote the}} album on October 2, 2008, in Cleveland, Ohio. The band co-headlined a 2009 tour with Rancid {{throughout}} the summer months. That {{was followed by a}} short tour of the UK in November, which was supported by the bands Thursday and Poison the Well.|$|E
5|$|Routine {{blood tests}} show {{features}} of acute inflammation (raised {{white blood cell}} count and elevated C-reactive protein level), and usually abnormal liver function tests (LFTs). In most cases the LFTs will be consistent with obstruction: raised bilirubin, <b>alkaline</b> phosphatase and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase. In the early stages, however, pressure on the liver cells may be the main feature and the tests will resemble those in hepatitis, with elevations in alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase.|$|E
5|$|Smyth {{specialized}} in petrology, chemical geology, and economic geology. He showed the sedimentary origin of iron ore deposits near his native Clinton, New York, mapped the geology {{of the western}} Adirondack Mountains, and published a well known monograph {{on the origins of}} <b>alkaline</b> igneous rocks. He was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a member of the American Philosophical Society, and a fellow of the Geological Society of America.|$|E
5|$|Stropharia caerulea is a {{saprophytic}} fungus that fruits singly or in groups. It {{grows in}} or on meadows, roadsides, hedgerows, gardens, and woodchip mulch. In Europe {{it is often}} found in beech woods in <b>alkaline</b> soil. It is a common species found throughout Europe, where it fruits from July to November. Although also found in North America, generally fruiting from August to October, {{the full extent of}} its distribution there is unknown.|$|E
5|$|The Phoenix lander {{returned}} data showing Martian soil to {{be slightly}} <b>alkaline</b> and containing elements such as magnesium, sodium, potassium and chlorine. These nutrients are found in soils on Earth, and they are necessary for growth of plants. Experiments performed by the lander showed that the Martian soil has a basic pH of 7.7, and contains 0.6% of the salt perchlorate.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of unbinilium {{is predicted to}} be {{similar to that of the}} <b>alkaline</b> earth metals, but it would probably behave more like calcium or strontium than barium or radium. Like strontium, unbinilium should react vigorously with air to form an oxide (UbnO) and with water to form the hydroxide (Ubn(OH)2), which would be a strong base, and releasing hydrogen gas. It should also react with the halogens to form salts such as UbnCl2. While these reactions would be expected from periodic trends, their lowered intensity is somewhat unusual, as ignoring relativistic effects, periodic trends would predict unbinilium to be even more reactive than barium or radium. This lowered reactivity is due to the relativistic stabilization of unbinilium's valence electron, increasing unbinilium's first ionization energy and decreasing the metallic and ionic radii; this effect is already seen for radium. the {{chemistry of}} unbinilium in the +2 oxidation state should be more similar to the chemistry of strontium than to that of radium. On the other hand, the ionic radius of the Ubn2+ ion is predicted to be larger than that of Sr2+, because the 7p orbitals are destabilized and are thus larger than the p-orbitals of the lower shells. Unbinilium may also show the +4 oxidation state, which is not seen in any other <b>alkaline</b> earth metal, in addition to the +2 oxidation state that is characteristic of the other <b>alkaline</b> earth metals and is also the main oxidation state of all the known <b>alkaline</b> earth metals: this is because of the destabilization and expansion of the 7p3/2 spinor, causing its outermost electrons to have a lower ionization energy than what would otherwise be expected. The +1 state may also be stable in isolation. Many unbinilium compounds are expected to have a large covalent character, due to the involvement of the 7p3/2 electrons in the bonding: this effect is also seen to a lesser extent in radium, which shows some 6s and 6p3/2 contribution to the bonding in radium fluoride (RaF2) and astatide (RaAt2), resulting in these compounds having more covalent character. The standard reduction potential of the Ubn2+/Ubn couple is predicted to be −2.9V.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} the fungus contain biologically active polysaccharides. A β-D-glucan called T-5-N and {{prepared}} from <b>alkaline</b> extracts {{has been shown to}} have anti-inflammatory properties. Its chemical structure is a linear chain backbone made largely of α-1→3 linked D-mannopyranosyl residues, with traces of 1→6 linked D-mannopyrosyl residues. The polysaccharide has tumour-suppressing activity against subcutaneously implanted sarcoma180 (a transplantable, non-metastasizing connective tissue tumour often used in research) in mice.|$|E
5|$|The fungus {{probably}} favours calcareous soil, {{although it}} has been found on nearly every soil type. It appears on sand, peat, limestone soils, rankers and Cambisols. It endures acidic as well as <b>alkaline</b> and low-nutrient to relatively high-nutrient soils. Heavily eutrophic soils are inappropriate for its habitat.|$|E
5|$|The {{poisonous}} fruit bodies cause neurotoxic symptoms if ingested, {{an effect}} {{attributable to the}} compound polyporic acid, which is present in high concentrations. When an <b>alkaline</b> solution {{is placed on the}} fungus, the flesh turns violet. The fungus is used in mushroom dyeing to produce purple colors.|$|E
