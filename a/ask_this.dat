The airline's improved financial performance last year was mainly attributable to its route rationalisation programme, which saw an overall 8% reduction in <b>ASK.</b> <b>This</b> was matched by a marginal 1% reduction in revenue to RM13.76bil in 2012 and seat factor holding at 74.5%. The reduced ASK also helped MAS register a corresponding 14% decrease in expenditure.|$|E

500|$|Icke {{has emerged}} as a {{professional}} conspiracy theorist within a global counter-cultural movement that combines New World Order conspiracism, the truther movement and anti-globalization, with an extraterrestrial conspiracist subculture (Roswell, alien abduction, crop circles, men in black, The X-Files). Thanks to Icke's prominence, public figures are regularly asked whether they are lizards. An Official Information Act request was filed in New Zealand in 2008 to <b>ask</b> <b>this</b> of John Key, the prime minister, and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg was asked the same during a Q in 2016. (Both men said they were not lizards. Key added that he had taken the unusual step of consulting not only a doctor but a vet.)

Morrison, as usual, declined {{to take part}} but the author's scholarly methods lend this weighty volume a real authority." [...] The Journal Gazette called the book: [...] "A definitive, provocative and revelatory portrait of an endlessly complicated man and his music." [...] A review in The Irish Times characterised the book as a [...] "magical" [...] journey into Van Morrison's life, noting: [...] "Johnny Rogan spent 23 years researching his biography of Van Morrison. It shows. In a book that really should have been titled Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Van Morrison But Were Too Petrified To <b>Ask,</b> <b>this</b> is a magical 'into the mystic' journey which vertiginously takes you from Edward Carson to Leadbelly, from the Mafia to the Rosacrucians, from drinking stories to Gestalt therapy, and from Bernadette Devlin to Terry Keane." [...] Brian Boyd of The Irish Times described Rogan's work as a [...] "superb book".|$|E
2500|$|Since every {{projective}} module over {{a principal}} ideal domain is free, one might <b>ask</b> <b>this</b> question: if R is a commutative ring such that every (finitely generated) projective R-module is free, then is every (finitely generated) projective R-module free?

Each of these sons phrases his question about the seder in a different way. The Haggadah recommends answering each son according to his question, using one of the three verses in the Torah that refer to this exchange.|$|E

Zeus rescued the unborn Dionysus by sewing him into his thigh. A few months later, Dionysus was born on Mount Pramnos in the island of Ikaria, where Zeus went to release the now-fully-grown baby from his thigh. In this version, Dionysus is born by two [...] "mothers" [...] (Semele and Zeus) before his birth, hence the epithet dimētōr (of two mothers) {{associated}} with his being [...] "twice-born".|$|E
2500|$|Guy of Lusignan and Reynald of Chatillon {{were brought}} to Saladin's tent.

Guy passed the goblet to Reynald, but Saladin struck it from his hands, saying [...] "I did not <b>ask</b> <b>this</b> evil man to drink, {{and he would not}} save his life by doing so". He then charged Reynald with breaking the truce. Some reports, such as that of Baha al' Din, claim that Saladin then executed Reynald himself with a single stroke of his sword. However, others record that Saladin struck Reynald as a sign to his bodyguards to behead him. Guy assumed that he would also be beheaded, but Saladin assured him that [...] "kings do not kill kings." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{intended}} {{audience is}} not evident. Some believe that Prufrock {{is talking to}} another person or directly to the reader, while others believe Prufrock's monologue is internal. Perrine writes [...] "The 'you and I' of the first line are divided parts of Prufrock's own nature", while Mutlu Konuk Blasing suggests that the [...] "you and I" [...] refers {{to the relationship between}} the dilemmas of the character and the author. Similarly, critics dispute whether Prufrock is going somewhere {{during the course of the}} poem. In the first half of the poem, Prufrock uses various outdoor images (the sky, streets, cheap restaurants and hotels, fog), and talks about how there will be time for various things before [...] "the taking of a toast and tea", and [...] "time to turn back and descend the stair." [...] This has led many to believe that Prufrock is on his way to an afternoon tea, where he is preparing to <b>ask</b> <b>this</b> [...] "overwhelming question". Others, however, believe that Prufrock is not physically going anywhere, but rather, is playing through it in his mind.|$|E
2500|$|In 1923, {{shortly after}} their arrival in Paris, Caresse {{introduced}} Crosby {{to her friend}} Constance Coolidge, also a Boston Brahmin, an American expatriate. She was the niece of Frank Crowninshield, editor of Vanity Fair, and had been married to American diplomat Ray Atherton. Constance didn't care what others thought about her. She loved anything risky and was addicted to gambling. Crosby nicknamed her the [...] "Lady of the Golden Horse." [...] Crosby immediately began {{a sexual relationship with}} her that continued for several months. Harry rationalized their affair, telling Constance, [...] "One should follow every instinct no matter where it leads." [...] In the fall of 1923, Caresse could not put up with their affair any longer and left for London. Harry told Constance the Caresse he could not meet Caresses' [...] demand that he [...] "love her more than anyone in the world. This is absolutely impossible." [...] But Crosby would not leave Caresse, nor did Constance <b>ask</b> <b>this</b> of him. But when Constance received a letter from Caresse who confessed that her affair with her husband had made her [...] "very miserable", Constance wrote Harry and told him she would not see him any more. Harry was devastated by her decision. [...] "Your letter was bar none the worst blow I have ever received. [...] I wouldn't leave her under any circumstances nor as you say would you ever marry me." [...] But the three remained friends, and on October 1, 1924 Constance married the Count Pierre de Jumilhac, although the marriage only lasted 5 years.|$|E
