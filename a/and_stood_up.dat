It departed Tarakan for Australia on 3December 1945 with No.78 Wing, arriving at RAAF Station Deniliquin, New South Wales, on the 14th. Still under the wing's control, it relocated to RAAF Station Schofields on 31May and then to RAAF Station Williamtown on 1August, disbanding on 1April 1948. No.114 MFCU was re-established under a newly organised No.78 Wing on 24January 1949—"in name only", however, as it remained non-operational. It began training in late 1955 prior to anticipated reactivation, and was renamed No.114 Mobile Control and Reporting Unit (MCRU) on 12March 1956. It relocated to RAAF Dubbo <b>and</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> as an independent unit on 14November.|$|E

MacArthur told Curtin to send Blamey back to Papua to take personal command of New Guinea Force. Curtin did so, and Blamey arrived in Port Moresby on 23 September. This put Rowell and Blamey on a collision course. They had a history of animosity going back to earlier in the war, first in the Middle East then in Greece. Rowell felt that Blamey should have supported him <b>and</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> to Curtin and MacArthur. Relations were fractious, and on 28 September Rowell had had enough. He spoke his mind to his commanding officer, and was dismissed. Potts had just lost his major advocate in Papua.|$|E

25|$|On {{the morning}} of 27 December, Bhutto met with Afghan President Hamid Karzai. In the afternoon, she gave a speech at a PPP rally held in Rawalpindi's Liaquat National Bagh. On leaving in a {{bulletproof}} vehicle, she opened the car's escape hatch <b>and</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> to wave to the surrounding crowds. A man stood within two to three metres of the car, fired three gunshots at her, and detonated a suicide vest packed with ball bearings. Bhutto was fatally injured; reports differ as to whether she was hit by bullets or by shrapnel from the explosion. Bhutto was rushed to Rawalpindi General Hospital, but was clinically dead on arrival and attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful. No autopsy was conducted, and the body was swiftly transported to Chaklala Air Base. The following day, she was buried next to her father in the Bhutto family mausoleum, Garhi Khuda Baksh, her family graveyard near Larkana. PPP supporters rioted {{in various parts of}} Pakistan.|$|E
500|$|Desiring an {{accurate}} emulation of a medieval castle {{to live in}} and house his substantial collection of medieval arts, arms, and armor, Wilhelm recruited architect and restorationist Carl Alexander Heideloff after turning down designs by Württemberg court painter Franz Seraph Stirnbrand and Christian Wilhelm von Faber du Faur - designs that differed substantially from today's structure.

500|$|In 1930 Noël Coward cast Olivier as Victor Prynne in his {{new play}} Private Lives, which opened at the new Phoenix Theatre in London in September. Coward and Gertrude Lawrence played the lead roles, Elyot Chase and Amanda Prynne. Victor is a {{secondary}} character, along with Sybil Chase; the author called them [...] "extra puppets, lightly wooden ninepins, only to be repeatedly knocked down <b>and</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> again". To make them credible spouses for Amanda and Elyot, Coward was determined that two outstandingly attractive performers should play the parts. Olivier played Victor in the West End and then on Broadway; Adrianne Allen was Sybil in London, but could not go to New York, where the part was taken by Esmond. In addition to giving the 23-year-old Olivier his first successful West End role, Coward became something of a mentor. In the late 1960s Olivier told Sheridan Morley: ...|$|E
500|$|In June 1986, Stephen Cook from TV Week {{announced}} that Daphne would accept a proposal from either Des or Shane, which would definitely result in her getting married. Smith told Cook [...] "I don't know whether Daphne actually needs {{a man in}} her life but she's certainly got two men there. It's a triangle that's developed, but to try and give a rational explanation to it is next to impossible." [...] Smith thought Daphne was ideal for Shane and that she {{had a great deal of}} love for him. On the other hand, Daphne also loved Des, who she trusted and had become good friends with. O'Brien stated that as far as Shane was concerned, Daphne was the only woman he ever loved and thought that he was more suited to her than Des. Keane commented that despite being engaged five times <b>and</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> once by Daphne, Des had always loved her. He added [...] "It was love at first sight for Des." ...|$|E
500|$|Tallon's non-selection for the 1938 Ashes touring party {{surprised}} commentators. In selection deliberations, Bradman had {{lobbied for}} Tallon and Walker, asserting that Oldfield was past his best. The other two selectors, Chappie Dwyer from New South Wales and Bill Johnson from Victoria, outvoted Bradman. They selected Barnett, {{because of his}} previous tour to England, and Walker. Tallon's omission was overshadowed by that of Grimmett, regarded alongside Bill O'Reilly as the world's leading legspinner. No official reason was given for Tallon's non-selection. A leak revealed {{that the reason for}} his omission was that he was not familiar with the bowling of Australia's three spinners: O'Reilly, Chuck Fleetwood-Smith and Frank Ward. [...] Another was Tallon's preference in standing back to medium pacers. In reality, Tallon stood back <b>and</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> to the stumps depending on the situation. While the medium pacers were swinging the ball, he would stand back to avoid the risk of missing an edge. When the ball was old, he would stand up to the stumps when a medium pacer was operating and effect many stumpings with his fast reflexes.|$|E

500|$|Dynamite Headdy {{received}} critical acclaim, {{with some}} believing {{it to be}} one of the best games on the Genesis. Journalists repeatedly highlighted the game's creativity as a strong point. Rik Skews of Computer and Video Games said it [...] "breathes new life" [...] into the action-platform genre <b>and</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> to the likes of the Sonic series. The staff at Mean Machines Sega found the game innovative and liked how each stage introduced new concepts to keep gameplay fresh. Tim Tucker at GamesMaster believed that Treasure was doing more innovation in the genre than any of its rivals. In addition to the game's originality, critics praised Treasure's programming expertise and Dynamite Headdys technical prowess. The staff of Electronic Gaming Monthly complimented the game's visual effects and colorful stages. Tucker said [...] "Dynamite Headdy is full of classic Treasure overstatement" [...] and cited the impressive colors, big explosions, large sprites, and rapidly changing backgrounds—which all together were perhaps a little too overwhelming. The Mean Machines staff believed that Dynamite Headdy followed in the footsteps of Treasure's previous games and therefore confirmed the studio's technical expertise. The gameplay drew some criticism, with Tucker finding it somewhat disjointed and [...] "patchy" [...] and Mean Machines stating that it takes a few stages to truly find its footing.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the opinion}} of the former West Australian {{champion}} rover Johnny Leonard, who had been the captain coach of South Melbourne in 1932 (he played 12 VFL games with South Melbourne in 1932), Pratt was a champion: [...] "I think Pratt was the most freakish footballer I ever saw. He was more freakish than Ted Flemming, and that's saying something. He had a heart as big as a grandstand <b>and</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> to heavy punishment as well as risking a broken neck in his phenomenal leaps for the ball. He was a great footballer".|$|E

Vienna's tourist board hoped to use Wurst to {{encourage}} more gay holidaymakers to visit the city, using her image on the Facebook page [...] "Gayfriendly Vienna". The Week stated that she had become [...] "a serious figure of hope" [...] for some LGBT people living [...] "under the shadow of officially-sanctioned intolerance" [...] in various European countries, while British trans activist Paris Lees commented that across Europe she inspired [...] "millions of people" [...] <b>and</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> for [...] "everyone who has ever been made to feel ashamed or afraid for being different." [...] LGBT rights groups in Serbia and Croatia criticised the tone with which their national broadcasters referred to Wurst, deeming it offensive and homophobic; Serbia's RTS subsequently issued a letter of apology.|$|E

2500|$|Coward {{received}} {{no fewer than}} 30 telegrams from Lawrence about the play. She first {{said that she had}} read the play and there was [...] "nothing wrong with it that can't be fixed." [...] Coward [...] "wired back curtly that the only thing {{that was going to be}} fixed was her performance." [...] Lawrence was indecisive about what to do about her previous commitment to André Charlot. Coward finally responded that he planned to cast the play with another actress. By the time he returned to London, he found Lawrence not only had cleared her schedule but was staying at Edward Molyneux's villa in Cap-d'Ail in southeastern France learning her lines. Coward joined her, and the two began rehearsing the scenes they shared. At the end of July they returned to London where Coward began to direct the production. Coward played the part of Elyot Chase himself, Adrianne Allen was his bride Sybil, Lawrence played Amanda Prynne, and Laurence Olivier was her new husband Victor. Coward wrote Sybil and Victor as minor characters, [...] "extra puppets, lightly wooden ninepins, only to be repeatedly knocked down <b>and</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> again". He later insisted, however, that they must be credible new spouses for the lead characters: [...] "We've got to have two people as attractive as Larry and Adrianne were in the first place, if we can find them." ...|$|E
2500|$|During this time, Gaye {{was able}} to prove his worth as a producer, {{producing}} several songs for Motown vocal group The Originals. The songs, [...] "Baby, I'm for Real" [...] and [...] "The Bells", became hits as a result. On March 16, 1970, Terrell succumbed from her illness, a month before her 25th birthday. Gaye dealt with Terrell's death by going on a prolonged seclusion from the music business. After his success with the Originals, Gaye changed his look, ditching his clean-cut, college boy image to grow a beard and dressing more casually, wearing sweatsuits. Gaye also pierced his ear in defiance <b>and</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> to Motown executives who felt {{he should have been}} touring. He also began working on fixing his personal issues, re-embracing his spirituality and also attended several concerts held by the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, which had been used for several Motown recordings in the 1960s. Around the spring of 1970, Gaye also began seriously pursuing a career in football with the professional football team the Detroit Lions of the NFL, even working out with the Eastern Michigan Eagles football team. However, Gaye's pursuit of a tryout with the Lions was stopped after being advised that an injury would derail his music career, leaving him upset. Despite this, Gaye would befriend three of the Lions teammates, Mel Farr, Charlie Sanders and Lem Barney, as well as the Detroit Pistons star and future Detroit mayor Dave Bing.|$|E
2500|$|S/L Bill Edrich {{had been}} a bomber pilot {{during the war and}} won the DFC in the [...] "RAF's most audacious and {{dangerous}} low-level bombing raid" [...] of 1941. A gutsy batsman he was [...] "almost indifferent to his own safety. No bowler is too fast to hook; no score too large to defy challenge" [...] <b>and</b> <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> to the bouncers of Lindwall and Miller. Returning to England in 1947 he became an amateur and made a record 3,539 runs (80.43) with 12 centuries, a total only exceeded by his Middlesex Twin Denis Compton who made 3,816 runs (90.85) and 18 centuries in the same season. Compton was the golden boy of post-war cricket [...] "illuminating the seemingly impossible stroke and playing shots which are so late that they appear to be afterthoughts." [...] He was restricted by Hammond's orders to stick to the crease as he liked to walk down the pitch to upset the slow bowlers – relying on his quick eye to keep him out of trouble – and was a shadow of himself until the Fourth Test when he ignored the captain's advice and made two centuries. His most famous stroke was the [...] "Compton Sweep" [...] in which he would pivot and drive the ball to long leg. Many others tried to copy this [...] "backward drive" [...] with fatal results, it was a product of Compton's own genius. Young Joe Hardstaff was the son of Joe Hardstaff of Notts and England and was a noted stylist [...] "all ease and elegance" [...] He had toured Australia in 1936–37, but failed to make a century and his Test career was stunted by the enmity of Gubby Allen. His selection was based on an innings of 205 not out against India in the Lords Test, but he had an otherwise poor season and failed on the tour.|$|E
