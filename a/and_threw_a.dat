5|$|In the {{following}} years, MacLaren {{and his family}} struggled financially. His wife's family sometimes sent money, but MacLaren often spent extravagantly whenever he had funds. On one occasion, when paid for writing an article, he moved out of his accommodation into an expensive hotel, <b>and</b> <b>threw</b> <b>a</b> dinner party for his friends. He ran up many debts—including an unpaid champagne bill at Old Trafford Cricket Ground in 1923—and borrowed money from friends.

Among other business ventures, he designed a cricket bat, showed specially shot cricket films, briefly owned a hotel and attempted to start a horse bloodstock agency. He continued to play club cricket and in 1924–25 he managed a privately organised tour of South Africa.|$|E

5|$|Sanchez was {{announced}} as the starter for the Eagles Week 11 {{game against the}} Buccaneers after {{it was revealed that}} Bradford suffered a separated shoulder and a concussion. Sanchez's opening drive was excellent, completing 100% of his passes and ending it with a 39-yard touchdown pass to Josh Huff to make the score 7-0. Sanchez continued to play well {{for the majority of the}} 1st half, <b>and</b> <b>threw</b> <b>a</b> second touchdown pass to Darren Sproles, but the Buccaneers offense had already scored 21 points. However, after that drive, Sanchez started to crumble, throwing an interception near the end of the second quarter. Sanchez finished the game with 3 interceptions, 1 of which was returned for a touchdown, in a humiliating 45-17 blowout. His 2 touchdown passes were the only points scored by the offense.|$|E

In his final game for them, he pitched both games of a doubleheader, winning one and losing the other. In 1906, Wilkes-Barre planned to re-sign Neuer, praising his hitting ability {{to the point that they}} were considering trying him out as an outfielder or first baseman. They were unable to agree on a contract, and as a result he sat out the 1906 season.|$|E

5|$|The Browns' first game, {{against the}} Miami Seahawks, {{took place on}} a warm late-summer evening in September. The crowd was the second-largest ever for a {{professional}} football game. The game was well-attended {{in part because of}} team owner Arthur B. McBride's promotion of the new team, but also because the Browns' two black players helped draw a large African-American crowd. Miami's team, drawn mainly from the Southern United States, was overmatched by Cleveland. The score was 27–0 at halftime and the final was 44–0. Browns end Mac Speedie scored the team's first points on a 19-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Cliff Lewis. Otto Graham came in at quarterback in the second quarter <b>and</b> <b>threw</b> <b>a</b> touchdown to Dante Lavelli. Placekicker Lou Groza kicked three field goals, and the Browns had two defensive touchdowns. Miami never advanced past the Browns' 39-yard line.|$|E
5|$|With about 10seconds left in {{the tenth}} round, Judah hit Mayweather with a low blow and {{followed}} it with a right hand {{to the back of}} Mayweather's head. As Mayweather hopped around the ring in pain, Steele called time to give Mayweather a rest period. Mayweather's uncle and trainer, Roger Mayweather, climbed into the ring and approached Judah. Yoel Judah entered the ring <b>and</b> <b>threw</b> <b>a</b> punch at Roger. At that point, members of both fighters' camps entered the ring and an all-out melee ensued. More than a dozen security officers and police officers rushed into the ring and managed to control the situation. After the ring was cleared, Roger Mayweather was ejected from the fight. Mayweather cruised through the last two rounds {{on his way to a}} unanimous decision victory by scores of 116–112, 117–111 and 119–109.|$|E
5|$|Florida State {{began the}} fourth quarter in {{possession}} of the ball and facing a third down, needing three yards for a first down. Weinke completed a pass for {{just short of the}} needed three yards. Instead of punting the ball away, Florida State head coach Bobby Bowden ordered the team to attempt to convert the first down. He brought backup quarterback Marcus Outzen into the game as a misdirection move, and instead of running a quarterback sneak as anticipated, Outzen tossed the ball to Minor, who ran for 16yards and a first down. During the play, Virginia Tech committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty that advanced the ball further and gave Florida State a first down at the Virginia Tech 23-yard line. Weinke returned to the game <b>and</b> <b>threw</b> <b>a</b> 10-yard pass to Chaney for another first down. Weinke threw an incomplete pass, then Tech stopped a rush up the middle for no gain. On third down, Weinke connected on a touchdown pass to Dugans, returning the lead to Florida State. The Seminoles, as had Virginia Tech before them, elected to attempt a two-point conversion. Unlike Virginia Tech's failed two-point conversions, the Seminoles successfully earned two points with a pass to Warrick, and the scores gave Florida State a 3629 lead with 12:59 remaining.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} quarter, Maryland {{advanced}} to the Oklahoma 20-yard line, and Tatum elected for a field goal attempt. Now against the wind, the kick failed, with the ball going wide right. The Sooners took over on downs and halfback Jack Ging completed a pass to end Max Boydston for a five-yard gain. Ging then rushed for threeyards. On the next play, Calame pitched to Grigg who ran {{to the left and}} picked up 12yards for a first down. Calame then completed a pass to back Bob Burris for sixyards. Grigg faked a pass and ran to the right for a gain of 12yards and a first down on the Maryland 39-yard line. The Terrapins stopped two Sooner rushing attempts before Calame connected with Burris again for an 11-yard gain. Burris then rushed for threemore yards to advance to the Maryland 25. Tatum called a time-out. On third down with oneyard to go, Calame faked a handoff to Ging and executed an option run to the left. He pitched to Grigg <b>and</b> <b>threw</b> <b>a</b> block. Grigg was tackled at the goal-line but managed to extend his body into the endzone. Buddy Leake made the extra point. Shortly before halftime, Calame suffered a separated collarbone. With back-up Pat O'Neal also injured, only third-string quarterback Jack Van Pool remained, and he had little game experience.|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma State scored first, with a {{surprising}} 49yard pass from Al Pena to D'Juan Woods. The Cowboys had lined up tight on 4th and 1 {{as if trying}} a short, power run, but faked that play <b>and</b> <b>threw</b> <b>a</b> deep pass instead, catching the Longhorn defense off-guard. Texas replied with a touchdown pass from Young to Thomas, but David Pino missed the extra point, allowing the Cowboys to retain the lead. Oklahoma State scored another touchdown and Texas completed a field goal to make the score 21–9 {{at the end of}} the firstquarter. The Cowboys scored one touchdown in the secondquarter off of a pass that was deflected by Texas, and Texas made a field goal near the end to cut into the lead, leaving Oklahoma State ahead 28–12 at halftime. The secondhalf was dominated by Texas as they scored fiveunanswered touchdowns to win the game. The scores consisted of tworushing touchdowns by Vince Young, tworushing touchdowns by Ramonce Taylor, and a 21-yard touchdown pass to Neale Tweedie.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech {{began the}} fourth quarter in {{possession}} of the ball with a first down at its 30-yard line. The Hokie drive fizzled, as had most of the offense in the third quarter, after DeShazo was sacked for a big loss on third down. Indiana returned the Tech punt to its 43-yard line, and Indiana brought in its backup quarterback, Chris Dittoe, to lead the offense. After being sacked on his first play, Dittoe completed a pass to near midfield, making up the yardage that had been lost on the sack. Despite that gain, Indiana couldn't make up the yardage lost to the sack {{and appeared to be}} ready to punt the ball. Instead, the Hoosiers faked the punt <b>and</b> <b>threw</b> <b>a</b> pass to an undefended Indiana player who dropped the ball. Following the turnover, Virginia Tech's offense started work at the Indiana 49-yard line. After being stopped short on two rushes, DeShazo completed a 42-yard pass to Antonio Freeman, who raced down the field and into the end zone. The extra point was good, and with 9:37 remaining in the game, Tech took a 3513 lead.|$|E
