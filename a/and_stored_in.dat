5|$|Catecholamines are {{produced}} in chromaffin {{cells in the}} medulla of the adrenal gland, from tyrosine, a non-essential amino acid derived from food or produced from phenylalanine in the liver. The enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase converts tyrosine to L-DOPA in {{the first step of}} catecholamine synthesis. L-DOPA is then converted to dopamine before it can be turned into noradrenaline. In the cytosol, noradrenaline is converted to epinephrine by the enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) <b>and</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> granules. Glucocorticoids produced in the adrenal cortex stimulate the synthesis of catecholamines by increasing the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and PNMT.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the first}} part was completed, Smederevo Fortress quickly became an {{important}} connection between the Balkans and central Europe. Shortly after it was built, the city reached its peak importance as a religious, commercial, and trade center, at which point it was populated mainly by Serbs and colonies of merchants, primarily from Dubrovnik.

5|$|Spedding {{recruited}} two chemistry {{professors at}} Ames for his group there, Harley Wilhelm and I. B. Johns. Spedding and Wilhelm {{began looking for}} ways to create the uranium metal.

It could be pressed and sintered <b>and</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> cans, but to be useful, it needed to be melted and cast. The Ames team found that molten uranium could be cast in a graphite container. Although graphite was known to react with uranium, this could be managed because the carbide formed only where the two touched.|$|E

Museum director, Anne Hawley has stated that the works {{should be kept in}} a stable environment of 50% humidity and 70°F. Additionally, they should be kept away from light <b>and</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> acid-free paper. Hawley also noted to avoid rolling the paintings, which will crack the paint. If these guidelines are not followed, the paintings could be damaged and drop in value. More repainting would need to be done too, which hurts the paintings' integrity.|$|E

5|$|Today {{there remain}} four paper scrolls of the emaki in varying {{condition}} <b>and</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> different collections: Hachisuka, Matsudaira, Hinohara scrolls (Tokyo), and Fujita scroll (Fujita Art Museum, Osaka).

This difference in time indicates that the original emaki most likely consisted of more scrolls than exist today.|$|E

5|$|Founded in 1998 by Richard and Frances Guerrera, the Golden Age of Trucking Museum was a {{non-profit}} organization dedicated to trucking. The Guerreras owned and operated R.J. Guerrera, a liquid transportation trucking company. Originally, a collection of trucks were restored <b>and</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> barns and garages throughout Connecticut. The Golden Age of Trucking Museum was opened to bring the collection under a single roof. After the property for the museum was purchased in July 1998, Richard Guerrera was diagnosed with cancer. In June 1999, he was transported to the site for an unofficial groundbreaking event. Richard Guerrera died a month later and the facility was completed in 2002. The museum was designed by Francis Guerrera's son-in-law, a general contractor. On September 23, 2002, the museum was formally opened with a ribbon-cutting ceremony in the complete 32,000 square foot building.|$|E
5|$|Geothermal {{energy is}} heat energy {{generated}} <b>and</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> the Earth. Thermal energy is {{the energy that}} determines the temperature of matter. The geothermal energy of the Earth's crust originates from the original formation of the planet and from radioactive decay of materials (in currently uncertain but possibly roughly equal proportions). The geothermal gradient, which is the difference in temperature between {{the core of the}} planet and its surface, drives a continuous conduction of thermal energy in the form of heat from the core to the surface. The adjective geothermal originates from the Greek roots γη (ge), meaning earth, and θερμος (thermos), meaning hot.|$|E
5|$|I'itoi {{onion is}} a {{prolific}} multiplier onion cultivated in the Baboquivari Peak Wilderness, Arizona area. This small-bulb type has a shallot-like flavour and {{is easy to}} grow and ideal for hot, dry climates. Bulbs are separated, and planted in the fall 1in below the surface and 12in apart. Bulbs will multiply into clumps and can be harvested throughout the cooler months. Tops die back {{in the heat of}} summer and may return with heavy rains; bulbs can remain in the ground or be harvested <b>and</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> a cool dry place for planting in the fall. The plants rarely flower; propagation is by division.|$|E

5|$|In 1798 Baker {{received}} a third official appointment, as government storekeeper for the Hawkesbury region {{in addition to}} his equivalent duties in Parramatta. Despite his past experience, Baker was quickly found wanting in the management of the stores, specifically those for farmers near the settlement of Windsor. In 1798 the local grain harvest was too large to be receipted <b>and</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> the Windsor storehouse, so Baker elected to fill that store solely with produce supplied by the region's three largest landholders. In consequence, smaller farmers at Windsor had no means of selling or storing their grain and were brought close to bankruptcy. Baker was deaf to their complaints, and Governor Hunter was forced to intervene in person to keep the peace. In a letter on 19 April, sent via the New South Wales Corps commander in Hawkesbury, Hunter directed Baker to return half of the harvest he had already stored, and instead fill the storehouse with goods from smaller farms.|$|E
5|$|Legislation {{was later}} {{introduced}} {{to amend the}} type of data collected <b>and</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> the National Register of Electors. On 17 May 2007, the Privacy Commissioner of Canada Jennifer Stoddart appeared before the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs regarding Bill C-31, An Act to amend the Canada Elections Act and the Public Service Employment Act submitting a letter in which she criticised the proposed changes to the Elections Act. One of the problems was the inclusion of an elector's date of birth in the voter lists sent to polling stations on election day for use by polling clerks and scrutineers; Stoddart stated that verification of an elector's birth year would be sufficient. The second problem she raised was inclusion of the date of birth in the voter lists sent to each candidate for all electoral districts in Canada, and also to all political parties.|$|E
5|$|Spedding and Wilhelm {{began looking}} for ways to create the uranium metal. At the time, it was {{produced}} {{in the form of a}} powder, and was highly pyrophoric. It could be pressed and sintered <b>and</b> <b>stored</b> <b>in</b> cans, but to be useful, it needed to be melted and cast. Casting presented difficulty because uranium corroded crucibles of beryllium, magnesia and graphite. To produce uranium metal, they tried reducing uranium oxide with hydrogen, but this did not work. While most of the neighboring elements on the periodic table can be reduced to form pure metal and slag, uranium did not behave this way. In June 1942 they then tried reducing the uranium with carbon in a hydrogen atmosphere, with only moderate success. They then tried aluminum, magnesium and calcium, all of which were unsuccessful. The following month the Ames team found that molten uranium could be cast in a graphite container. Although graphite was known to react with uranium, this could be managed because the carbide formed only where the two touched.|$|E
