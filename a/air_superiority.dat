5|$|The Battle of Midway {{redefined the}} central {{importance}} of <b>air</b> <b>superiority</b> {{for the remainder}} of the war when the Japanese suddenly lost their four main aircraft carriers and were forced to return home. Without any form of <b>air</b> <b>superiority,</b> the Japanese never again launched a major offensive in the Pacific.|$|E
5|$|Before both battles, {{the uneven}} {{deployments}} were kept secret by controlling aerial reconnaissance through British <b>air</b> <b>superiority.</b>|$|E
5|$|By August, as the {{serviceability}} and {{the quantity}} of the Luftwaffe's inventory steadily diminished due to combat, demand for air support only increased as the VVS recovered. The Luftwaffe found itself struggling to maintain local <b>air</b> <b>superiority.</b> With the onset of bad weather in October, the Luftwaffe was on several occasions forced to halt nearly all aerial operations. The VVS, although faced with the same weather difficulties, had a clear advantage thanks to the prewar experience with cold-weather flying, {{and the fact that}} they were operating from intact airbases and airports. By December, the VVS had matched the Luftwaffe and was even pressing to achieve <b>air</b> <b>superiority</b> over the battlefields.|$|E

25|$|Numaga was {{at least}} six feet tall, {{a man of great}} {{physical}} strength with a quiet dignity which gave him an <b>air</b> of <b>superiority.</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{the first}} level (<b>Air</b> <b>Superiority),</b> the player must destroy several enemy airstrips and their support facilities, as well as {{liberate}} an exposed pro-American spy who holds important information about Kilbaba's next plans.|$|E
5|$|Unternehmen Donnerkeil (Operation Thunderbolt) was the codename for a German {{military}} {{operation of the}} Second World War. Donnerkeil was designed as an <b>air</b> <b>superiority</b> operation to support the Kriegsmarine (German Navy) Operation Cerberus, {{also known as the}} Channel Dash.|$|E
5|$|By March 1945 the Luftwaffe {{had lost}} <b>air</b> <b>superiority</b> over all fronts. Western Allied Air Forces held air {{supremacy}} over the German Reich and remaining German-occupied territory. German industrial cities were now subjected to intensive bombardment which inflicted enormous {{damage on the}} German war effort. The United States Army Air Forces attacked by day, while RAF Bomber Command operated by night.|$|E
60|$|Helen Fairclough, who {{was doing}} the honours for Lady Cranston, her absent hostess, assumed the slight <b>air</b> of <b>superiority</b> to which the {{circumstances}} of the case entitled her.|$|R
6000|$|... "But he says, 'A ship's in the garden,' {{instead of}} 'a sheep,'" [...] said Letty, with an <b>air</b> of <b>superiority.</b> [...] "You might think he meant a ship off the sea." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't see why {{you should}} call it absurd," [...] I said, smiling with an <b>air</b> of <b>superiority.</b> [...] "I arrived here in a {{perfectly}} comfortable condition, neither heated nor wearied." ...|$|R
5|$|During April 6, 80 SAMs were {{launched}} by the NVA {{in the area around}} Hambleton. It was estimated that Hambleton and Clark {{were in the midst of}} five or six NVA battalions. The NVA air defense seriously challenged American <b>air</b> <b>superiority</b> and blunted the success of close air support in the area.|$|E
5|$|During the Gulf War of 1991, the <b>air</b> <b>superiority</b> of the {{coalition}} forces {{was so great that}} the majority of Iraqi Su-25s did not even manage to get airborne. On 25 January 1991, seven Iraqi Air Force Su-25s fled from Iraq and landed in Iran.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the failure}} to gain even local <b>air</b> <b>superiority</b> in the Battle of Britain, Operation Sea Lion was {{postponed}} indefinitely. Hitler and his generals {{were aware of the}} problems of an invasion. Hitler was not ideologically committed to a long war with Britain and many commentators suggest that German invasion plans were a feint never to be put into action.|$|E
60|$|No sooner was {{the boat}} laid down than Leo taking {{one of the}} bundles of {{trinkets}} stepped up to Grabantak, whom he easily distinguished by his <b>air</b> of <b>superiority</b> and the deference paid him by his followers.|$|R
60|$|Nor did the humorous doctor forbear {{to foster}} an opinion every way so {{advantageous}} to himself; at times, {{for the sake}} of the joke, assuming <b>airs</b> of <b>superiority</b> over myself, which, though laughable enough, were sometimes annoying.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hear the child!" [...] cried Primrose, with an <b>air</b> of <b>superiority.</b> [...] "How {{little he}} knows about the {{troubles}} of this world! Poor fellow! He will be wiser when he has seen as much of life as I have." ...|$|R
5|$|Göring {{had promised}} Hitler that Adlertag and Adlerangriff would achieve the results {{required}} within days, or at worst weeks. It {{had meant to}} {{be the beginning of}} the end of RAF Fighter Command, but Adlertag and the following operations failed to destroy the RAF, or gain the necessary local <b>air</b> <b>superiority.</b> As a result, Operation Sea Lion was postponed indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, {{the second}} Congress of FRELIMO was a {{propaganda}} {{victory for the}} insurgents, despite attempts by the Portuguese, who enjoyed <b>air</b> <b>superiority</b> throughout the conflict, to bomb {{the location of the}} meeting late in the day. This gave FRELIMO further weight to wield in the United Nations.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1940, the {{principal}} {{concern of the}} Royal Air Force, together with elements of the Fleet Air Arm, was to contest the control of British airspace with the German Luftwaffe. For the Germans, achieving at least local <b>air</b> <b>superiority</b> was an essential prerequisite to any invasion.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{shall never}} agree, my dear sir, we shall never agree;" [...] then, turning toward my uncle with the <b>air</b> of <b>superiority</b> that the vulgar so easily assume--"What {{do you say}} to all this, friend Dafidson--are you up-rent or down-rent?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Jukes, {{straddling}} {{his long}} legs {{like a pair of}} compasses, put on an <b>air</b> of <b>superiority.</b> [...] "We're going to catch it this time," [...] he said. [...] "The barometer is tumbling down like anything, Harry. And you trying to kick up that silly row. [...] ." ...|$|R
60|$|But she seldom made {{time to go}} and see Kitty's improvement; and, {{when she}} did run out for an hour she failed to {{discover}} any thing, except that the girl was prettier and more coquettish than ever, and assumed <b>airs</b> of <b>superiority</b> that tried Christie very much.|$|R
5|$|Luftflotte 2 {{operated}} {{in support of}} Army Group Centre, commanded by Fedor von Bock, continuing the close working relationship between the two. Kesselring's mission was to gain <b>air</b> <b>superiority,</b> and if possible air supremacy, {{as soon as possible}} while still supporting ground operations. For this he had a fleet of over 1,000 aircraft, {{about a third of the}} Luftwaffes total strength.|$|E
5|$|On 14 May, the Germans {{continued}} to attack Soviet {{positions in the}} north in localized offensives and by then, the Luftwaffe had gained <b>air</b> <b>superiority</b> over the Kharkov sector, forcing Timoshenko to move his own air assets forward in order to effectively counter the bolstered Luftflotte 4. The Luftwaffe won <b>air</b> <b>superiority</b> over their numerically superior, but technically inferior opponents. The air battles depleted the Soviet fighter strength, allowing the German strike aircraft the chance to influence the land battle even more. Nonetheless, the Soviet forces pushed on, disengaging from several minor battles and changing the direction of their thrusts. However, {{in the face of}} continued resistance and local counterattacks, the Soviet attack ebbed, especially when combined with the invariably heavy air raids. By the end of the day, the 28th Army could no longer conduct offensive operations against German positions.|$|E
5|$|Post-battle {{analysis}} suggests only 11 of the Luftwaffe's 34 air combat Gruppen made attacks {{on time and}} with surprise. The operation failed to achieve <b>air</b> <b>superiority,</b> even temporarily, while the German ground forces continued {{to be exposed to}} Allied air attack. Bodenplatte was the last large-scale strategic offensive operation mounted by the Luftwaffe during the war.|$|E
50|$|Ed Branish (Edward Herrmann), a snooty English {{teacher who}} finds his {{situation}} at Mingo Junction High School far beneath him and barely tolerable, flaunts his <b>air</b> of <b>superiority</b> over all, including his supportive wife (Kathleen Lloyd), by frequently spouting platitudes from literary masters to validate his often contemptuous viewpoint.|$|R
60|$|Lupus rose {{slowly to}} his feet with an angry glare in his eyes. He knew, however, that Scopus had in his time been {{unrivalled}} in the arena, and that, moreover, the rest, who had been offended by his <b>airs</b> of <b>superiority,</b> would side with the lanista against him.|$|R
60|$|There was an <b>air</b> of <b>superiority</b> {{about them}} both, and {{something}} in their appearance so unusual in such a place, that a respectful silence was observed until the whirr—r—bang of the spring door announced that {{they were out of}} hearing. It was broken by the wife of the ex-fruiterer.|$|R
5|$|The Heinkel He 111 {{served on}} all the German {{military}} fronts in the European Theatre of World War II. Beginning the war as a medium bomber it supported the German campaigns in the field until 1943 when, owing to Western Allied and Soviet <b>air</b> <b>superiority,</b> it reverted to a transport aircraft role.|$|E
5|$|The {{evacuation}} was code-named Operation Ke (ケ号作戦), and {{was scheduled}} to begin on 14 January 1943. An important element in the plan was an <b>air</b> <b>superiority</b> campaign starting 28 January 1943, to inhibit Allied aircraft or warships from disrupting {{the final stage of}} the Ke operation, which was the actual evacuation of all Japanese troops from Guadalcanal.|$|E
5|$|By 1943, the Allies {{had gained}} <b>air</b> <b>superiority</b> over Germany, and bombings of German cities and {{industry}} had become commonplace. However, the Allies in their strategic bombing campaign did not concentrate on industry, and Speer {{was able to}} overcome bombing losses. In spite of these losses, German production of tanks {{more than doubled in}} 1943, production of planes increased by 80 percent, and production time for Kriegsmarine submarines was reduced from one year to two months. Production would continue to increase until the second half of 1944.|$|E

2500|$|Through {{the night}} the IAF also struck the main East Pakistani airfields of Tejgaon, and later Kurmitolla. At the same time, the IAF was {{deploying}} additional aircraft to its forward airfields for the strikes that were to follow the next morning. Within days, the Indian Air Force was to achieve <b>air</b> [...] <b>superiority.</b>|$|R
