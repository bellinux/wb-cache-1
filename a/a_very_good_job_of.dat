500|$|In {{reviewing}} the second volume, Manga Life Dan Polley felt [...] "Fujima [...] <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> laying down the framework and executing a plot {{for fun and}} carefree adventures." [...] In his review of the third volume, Polley wrote that [...] "the art is enjoyable, but can sometimes be overloaded" [...] and that [...] "often there are sequences {{in which there is}} too much going on and it is hard to decipher exactly what the eyes are seeing." [...] However, he noted that [...] "fans of the series will continue to enjoy the animalistic cheekiness." ...|$|E
500|$|Certain reviewers {{have also}} commented {{negatively}} about Perry and his subplot, which Sherry Robinson of the St. Petersburg Times considers [...] "pretty trippy." [...] Kevin McDonough of Sun Coast Today {{described it as}} [...] "complicated" [...] and [...] "loosely connected" [...] {{to the rest of}} the series, writing that he is [...] "not sure what this accomplishes except to add the noise of explosions to the already constant din of singing and screaming." [...] Ed Liu of Toon Zone feels it is [...] "truly puzzling what Perry the secret agent is doing in this show in the first place." [...] Liu considers his subplot to be a type of [...] "throw everything against the wall and see what sticks" [...] element and writes that [...] "many of the earlier episodes of the show don't manage to do <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> balancing the subplot and the main one." ...|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the record}} crowd {{remained}} after the game as they watched Seattle players and coaches engaged in the post match trophy awarding ceremony and celebrated on the field. [...] In the post match press conference, Sigi Schmid praised his team's defensive efforts in the match, saying [...] "We talked about making sure their defenders – and primarily Pável Pardo – didn’t {{have a chance to}} lift their heads and hit those long balls in behind." [...] Schmid continued, [...] "I thought Evans did a really good job. Sometimes we were stretched in the midfield, but I thought he did <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> stepping up to Pável. When you look at the 90 minutes, it was a rare occasion {{that he was able to}} hit a ball behind our defense." [...] Chicago midfielder Logan Pause commented on the game saying, [...] "It’s disappointing. We came here to win. We were under the gun all night. They’re a great team, one of the best in the league. It was a great atmosphere and home field advantage. The better team won tonight unfortunately." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to DDoS attacks against Church of Scientology websites, Anonymous also organized a campaign {{on one of}} their websites to [...] "begin bumping Digg", referring to an attempt to drive up Scientology-related links on the website Digg.com. On January 25, 2008, eight of the top ten stories on Digg.com were about either Scientology-related controversies or Anonymous and attempts to expose Scientology. Digg CEO Jay Adelson told PC World that Anonymous had not manipulated the site's algorithm system to prevent artificial poll results, stating: [...] "They must have done <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> bringing in a diverse set of interests ... It just happened to hit a nerve that the Digg community was interested in." [...] Adelson said two other instances which similarly have dominated the Digg main page in the past were the Virginia Tech Massacre {{in the aftermath of the}} incident and the [...] "7/7" [...] London bombings in 2005. Adelson commented on the popularity of Scientology theme within the Digg community: [...] "In the history of Digg, there's no question that the topic of Scientology has been of great interest to the community ... I can't explain why." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics lauded the {{development}} of the storyline between Shane and Rick. Writing for Best Week Ever, Dan Hopper stated that it presented a cold and eerie outlook {{on the future of the}} two men. Nate Rawlings of Time evaluated their physical confrontation as [...] "darn good", and Alex Crumb of The Faster Times called it [...] "wholly satisfying". Entertainment Weekly writer Darren Franich commended the fight scene; [...] "The Shane/Rick fight was great, a brilliantly extended scuffle that started out with an air of boys-will-be-boys pettiness but quickly escalated into something genuinely homicidal." [...] Goldman summated on the scene: [...] "Of course, it was also gratifying to finally see that conflict turn physical, with a fight we've been waiting to see for a long time. Rick vs. Shane was appropriately brutal and did <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> representing the two men's different tactics—Rick was no doubt a formidable and dangerous guy in a fight, wailing on Shane with a series of punches. But Shane was going for the kill, using anything he could grab as a weapon, as he shoved a motorcycle onto Rick at one point and then threw a massive wrench at him in an effective, 'Holy S**t!' moment." ...|$|E

30|$|Theory {{does not}} do <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>job</b> {{explaining}} why producers would include expensive credence qualities in their goods but not seek the price premium that usually comes with certification. Differences in the costs of producing credence qualities can only partially explain this behavior. The apparent proliferation of non-certified credence goods can only be understood by recognizing that producers’ decisions about how to produce and whether to seek certification are more complicated than merely comparing revenue and costs.|$|R
