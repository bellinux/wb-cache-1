40|$|Introduction: Anorexia nervosa {{represents}} {{an eating disorder}} {{that is associated with}} substantial psychological, social and physiological abnormalities, involving 0. 5 - 2 % of female population. Objective: The secretion patterns of inhibin B, as marker of gonadal activity, and leptin, as an indicator of energy balance and body composition, were analyzed in our cross-sectional study in order to asses the restoration of reproductive function in patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) during gaining of normal weight. Method: The study included 20 patients with low weight <b>AN</b> (<b>BMI</b> 14. 3 ± 0. 3 kg/mI), 22 partially recovered <b>AN</b> (<b>BMI</b> 17. 4 ± 0. 1 kg/mI), and 29 gained regular weight, out of whom 16 had no restoration of menstrual cycle (BMI 19. 5 ± 0. 1 kg/mI), and 13 had at least six consecutive menstrual cycles (BMI 19. 3 ± 1. 0 kg/mI). Nineteen eumenorrheic females with BMI 19. 8 ± 0. 4 kg/mI were the controls. Results: Significant correlation between leptin and inhibin B (ς= 0. 446; p= 0. 000), leptin and delta LH (ς= 0. 611; p< 0. 001), and inhibin B and delta LH (ς= 0. 574; p< 0. 001) was found in patients with anorexia nervosa during weight gain. Leptin (p= 0. 0039), inhibin B (p= 0. 0173), LH (p= 0. 0323) and delta LH (p= 0. 0087) were important predictors of reproductive recovery in patients with anorexia nervosa during gaining of normal weight. Among aforementioned parameters, leptin (p= 0. 0057) appeared to be the most important. Conclusion: Leptin is the most important predictor of reproductive recovery in patients with anorexia nervosa during weight normalization. These findings suggest that decreased leptin levels may be responsible for several neuroendocrine abnormalities seen in anorexia nervosa. Thus, interventional studies involving administration of recombinant leptin are required to fully clarify the physiologic and potentially therapeutic role of leptin in anorexia nervosa...|$|E

40|$|The {{spectacular}} {{increase in}} the prevalence of obesity in our society and the significant complications and comorbidities that it gives rise to have stimulated the interest of scientists and public in this pathology. Surgical treatment is at present the only efficient and lasting treatment for morbid obesity {{and in many cases}} it appreciably improves, and even definitively cures, associated complications such as the case of diabetes or hypertension. Amongst the different techniques of bariatric surgery, the gastric bypass (GBP) seems to be definitively establishing itself, since it offers an excellent balance between loss of weight (> 70 % of the excess), surgical risk and subsequent quality of life. The possibility of carrying out this technique employing a laparoscopic approach has improved its acceptance by doctors and patients while it has made it possible to reduce morbidity and mortality, length of hospital stay and costs.

40|$|Mortality in anorexic {{patients}} is mainly due to suicide or cardiac failure. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate structural and functional cardiovascular alterations further by means of echocardiography in a sample of 15 medication-free patients with DSM-IV anorexia nervosa (<b>AN)</b> (<b>BMI</b> < 17. 5 kg/m 2) and without any known cardiovascular disease and/or a family history of deafness or sudden death, and correlate the findings with clinical variables. The controls consisted of a sample of 10 constitutionally thin women (BMI < 19 kg/m 2), of comparable age, height and degree of physical activity. All of the subjects underwent Doppler echocardiography (ECHO), and the patients were also administered the Diagnostic Schedule for Eating Disorders (DSED) in order to assess the features and course of the eating disorder. ECHO revealed silent pericardial effusion in 71. 4 % of the patients vs. 10 % of the controls (p < 0. 05); among the patients, the separation of pericardial leaflets was more frequent in those with a shorter duration of illness (p < 0. 05). Mitral valve motion abnormalities were more frequent among the patients than the controls (69. 2 % vs. 10 %, p < 0. 005), and the left ventricular mass/body surface area was lower (54. 8 % vs. 59 %, p < 0. 001). Isovolumetric relaxation time was longer in the patients (98. 4 vs. 65 msec, p < 0. 01), but there were no significant differences in left ventricular ejection fraction (53. 8 % vs. 59 %) or early diastolic deceleration time (146 vs. 155 msec).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Whether {{gastrointestinal}} {{motor and}} sensory function is primary cause or secondary effect of abnormal body weight is uncertain. Moreover, studies relating continuous postprandial sensations of satiation to measurable pathology are scarce. This work assessed postprandial gastrointestinal function and concurrent sensations of satiation {{across a wide}} range of body weight and after weight change. METHODS: Patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) and obesity (OB) were investigated in reference to normal weight controls (HC). AN were additionally investigated longitudinally. Gastric emptying, antral contractions and oro-cecal transit after ingestion of a solid meal were investigated by MRI and 13 C-lactose-ureide breath test. The dependency of self-reported sensations of satiation on the varying degree of stomach filling during gastric emptying was compared between groups. RESULTS: 24 <b>AN</b> (<b>BMI</b> 14. 4 (11. 9 - 16. 0) kg/m 2), 16 OB (34. 9 (29. 6 - 41. 5) kg/m 2) and 20 HC (21. 9 (18. 9 - 24. 9) kg/m 2) were studied. Gastric half-emptying time (t 50) was slower in AN than HC (p[*]=[*] 0. 016) and OB (p[*]=[*] 0. 007), and a negative association between t 50 and BMI was observed between BMI 12 and 25 kg/m 2 (p[*]=[*] 0. 007). Antral contractions and oro-cecal transit were not different. For any given gastric content volume, self-reported postprandial fullness was greater in AN than in HC or OB (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). After weight rehabilitation, t 50 in AN tended to become shorter (p[*]=[*] 0. 09) and postprandial fullness was less marked (p[*]<[*] 0. 01).

40|$|Summary Background & aims Body weight changes do {{not reflect}} the {{respective}} changes of body compartments, namely fat-free mass (FFM) and fat mass (FM). Both bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) and the Dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measure FFM and FM. This study in underweight patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) aims to compare measurements of FM and FFM done by DXA and BIA using 5 different BIA equations already validated in healthy population and to identify the most suitable BIA equation for AN patients. Methods Fifty female patients with <b>AN</b> (<b>BMI</b> = 14. 3 ± 1. 49, age = 19. 98 ± 5. 68 yrs) were included in the study. Body composition was measured by DXA (Delphi W, Hologic, Bedford, MA) and by 50 kHz BIA (FORANA, Helios) using 5 different BIA equations validated in healthy population (Sun, Geneva, Kushner, Deurenberg and Roubenoff equations). Comparison between the DXA and the 5 BIA equations was done using the sum of the squares of differences and Bland–Altman plots. Results The Deurenberg equation gave the best estimates of FFM when compared to the measurements by DXA (FFMdxa = 35. 80 kg versus FFMdeurenberg = 36. 36 kg) and very close estimates of FM (FMdxa = 9. 16 kg and FMdeurenberg = 9. 57 kg) The Kushner equation showed slightly better estimates for FM (FMkushner = 9. 0 kg) when compared to the DXA, but not for FFM. Sun equation gave the broadest differences for FM and FFM when compared with DXA. Conclusion The best available BIA equation to calculate the FFM and the FM in patients with AN is the Deurenberg equation. It takes into account the weight, height and age and is applicable in adults and adolescents AN patients with BMI of 12. 8 – 21. 0, and for ages between 13. 4 and up to 36. 9 years.

40|$|Abstract Background Sufficient {{exercise}} {{is important for}} people with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T 2 DM), as it can prevent future health problems. Despite, {{it is estimated that}} only 30 - 40 % of people with T 2 DM are sufficiently active. One of the psychosocial constructs that is believed to influence physical activity behaviour, is exercise self-efficacy. The goal {{of this study is to}} evaluate a patient-tailored exercise intervention for people with T 2 DM that takes exercise self-efficacy into account. Methods/Design This study is conducted as a non-randomized controlled clinical trial. Patients are eligible when they are diagnosed with T 2 DM, exercise less than advised in the ADA guideline of 150 [*]min/week of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity, have <b>an</b> <b>BMI</b> > 25 and are between 18 and 80 [*]years old. Recruitment takes place at a Primary care organization of general practitioners and practice nurses in the south of the Netherlands. Participants are allocated to three groups: An advice intervention -for participants with a high exercise self-efficacy score- in which participants receive a patient-tailored exercise intervention, an intensive intervention -for participants with a low exercise self-efficacy score- in which participants receive a patient-tailored exercise intervention accomplished by a group based intervention, and a control group in which participants receive regular Dutch diabetes care. The primary outcome measure of this study is physical activity. Secondary outcome measures are health status, (symptoms of) depression, exercise self-efficacy, Body Mass Index (BMI), blood pressure and glycemic control. Discussion We aimed to design an intervention that can be implemented in Primary care, but also to design an easy accessible program. This study is innovative as it is -to our best knowledge- the first study that takes level of exercise self-efficacy of people with T 2 DM into account by means of giving extra support to those with the lowest exercise self-efficacy. If the program succeeds in increasing the amount of physical activity it can be implemented in regular primary care. Trial registration Dutch Trial Register NTR 2734 </p...|$|E

SUBJECTS/ METHODS: We have studied 18 children and teenagers with CL, 10 girls and 8 boys, and 18 gender and age matched normal controls, with the same pubertal stage. All were recruited from the outpatient pediatric clinic nutrition unit. None of the children with CL showed symptoms of chronic illness, they had normal laboratory results, they had a normal caloric food intake, {{and they did not}} agree with the DSM-IV-TR criteria for anorexia nervosa. We describe the body mass index (BMI) of children and their parents. The children were classified according to Cole's recently published BMI cut-offs for thinness: under 18. 5 points in CL group, stable at least in the last year, and between 18. 5 and 25 cutt-offs in the control group. The body composition was calculated by anthropometric methods (skinfold thickness measurements). In addition REE was measured using fasting indirect calorimetry. The CL group had a higher mean percentage of FFM, and a mean FM significantly less, relative to controls (p < 0. 001). The average absolute REE was significantly lower in the CL group (1, 106. 55 ± 240. 72 kcal) than the control group (1, 353. 33 ± 270. 01 kcal/dia) (p < 0. 01). However, the REE adjusted for FFM showed a mean significantly greater in the CL group (41. 39 ± 2. 26 kcal/kg FFM) (Mean confidence interval (CI) 95 %: 40. 33 - 42. 45) than the controls (37. 37 ± 3. 06 kcal/kg FFM) (Mean CI 95 %: 35. 93 - 38. 81) (p < 0. 001).

Total and LDL (Low Density Lipoprotein) Cholesterol levels were higher (P < 0 Æ 05; P = 0 Æ 001) in AN (193 Æ 09 ± 39 Æ 86 mg dL) 1; 107 Æ 95 ± 27 Æ 75 mg dL) 1) than C (166 Æ 09 ± 13 Æ 70 mg dL) 1; 83 Æ 6 ± 15 mg dL) 1), while Albumin was lower (P < 0 Æ 05) in AN than C (4 Æ 40 ± 0 Æ 41 vs. 4 Æ 65 ± 0 Æ 57 g dL) 1); no difference between restricter and binge-purge subtype. Prealbumin and C Somatomedine were similar in AN and C because of these parameters rapidly change with changing of nutritional habits, and the study’s patients were already included into nutritional educational program: although their daily caloric intake was lower than the recommended assumption levels of nutrients (LARN, National Institute of Nutrition), the caloric division between macronutrients was correct. Conclusions: Increase of Apn in AN might be related to fat mass reduction, in fact Apn progressively increase in losing weight obese, or fat mass might exert negative feedback on Apn production, the severe emaciation in AN could inhibit this feedback...|$|E

40|$|Background: Anorexia Nervosa (AN) and Obesity are {{prevalent}} in modern societies, their pathogenesis {{is not yet}} well understood. Materials and methods: This study evaluate circulating levels of Neuropeptide Y (NPY), Peptide Tyrosine-Tyrosine (PYY), and Adiponectine (Apn), in 60 women: 20 with <b>AN</b> (<b>BMI</b> 15 Æ 7 ± 2 Æ 1 kg/m 2, age 30 Æ 2 ± 10 Æ 5 years), 12 restricter (BMI 14 Æ 9 ± 1 Æ 6 kg/m 2) and 8 binge-purge subtype (BMI 18 Æ 3 ± 0 Æ 8 kg/m 2); 20 with severe Obesity (BMI> 40 kg/m 2; age 33 Æ 6 ± 5 Æ 2 years) with type II diabetes with no therapy, and 20 healthy controls (BMI 22 Æ 06 ± 0 Æ 93 kg/m 2, age 32 Æ 4 ± 4 Æ 4 years). Results: NPY was higher (P < 0 Æ 001) in AN (70 Æ 2 ± 20 Æ 8 pmol/L) than obese and controls and lower (P < 0 Æ 001) in obese than controls (25 Æ 1 ± 7 Æ 3 and 52 Æ 2 ± 10 Æ 98 pmol/L, respectively). PYY was higher (P < 0 Æ 001), in AN (219 Æ 77 ± 83 Æ 51 pg/mL) than obese and controls (116 Æ 42 ± 41 Æ 42 e 94 Æ 97 ± 12 Æ 74 pg/mL; P = n. s.). Apn was higher (P < 0 Æ 001) in AN (36 Æ 84 ± 13 Æ 12 ng/ mL) than obese and controls (12 Æ 8 ± 4 Æ 7 and 15 Æ 1 ± 3 Æ 0 ng/mL; P = n. s.). NPY, PYY and Apn were higher (P = 0 Æ 06; P = 0 Æ 06; P = 0 Æ 004) in restricter (75 Æ 8 ± 20 Æ 9 pmol/L; 241 Æ 8 ± 84 Æ 6 pg/mL; 41 Æ 8 ± 11 Æ 0 ng/mL) than in binge-purge AN subtype (53 Æ 4 ± 8 Æ 7 pmol/L; 153 Æ 7 ± 29 Æ 5 pg/mL; 22 Æ 1 ± 4 Æ 5 ng/mL). Conclusions: Increase of NPY despite simultaneous PYY increase in AN {{might be related to}} reduced sensitivity to PYY inhibitory effect on NPY production or increased production of NPY from simpathetic peripheral nervous system, a finding evident mainly in restricter AN. Increased levels of Apn are related to fat mass reduction in AN. In obese women, PYY levels are similar to controls suggesting reduced intestinal production possibly secondary to overfeeding. Reduced NPY levels suggest that overfeeding is not dependent to increased hungry signal, but to inadequate satiety signal, and they could be explained by increased levels of insulin and leptin...|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between {{body mass index}} (BMI) and mortality remains controversial. Furthermore, the association between BMI and cardiovascular events (CVE) is not conclusive and may differ by ethnicity. We aimed to estimate the associations between the BMI and mortality or cardiovascular disease in a general Korean population. This study {{was based on a}} sample cohort database released by the Korean National Health Insurance Service. We analyzed a total of 415, 796 adults older than 30 years of age who had undergone a national health examination at least once from 2002 to 2012. Hazard ratios for death and cardiovascular events were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models. For both men and women, BMI and overall mortality showed a U-shaped association, with the lowest mortality rate among those with <b>a</b> <b>BMI</b> of 25 - 27. 4 kg/m 2. Compared with them, subjects with <b>a</b> <b>BMI</b> ≥ 30 kg/m 2, men with <b>a</b> <b>BMI</b> < 25 kg/m 2, and women with <b>a</b> <b>BMI</b> < 22. 5 kg/m 2 showed significantly higher overall mortality. Additionally, men with <b>a</b> <b>BMI</b> < 22. 5 kg/m 2 and women with <b>a</b> <b>BMI</b> < 20 kg/m 2 displayed an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality. Unlike the mortality trend, the CVD events trend showed a linearly positive association. The risk of a CVE was the lowest in men with <b>a</b> <b>BMI</b> ranging from 20 to 22. 4 kg/m 2 and in women with <b>a</b> <b>BMI</b> < 20 kg/m 2. The <b>BMI</b> showed <b>a</b> U-shaped association with overall mortality, where slightly obese subjects showed the lowest rate of mortality. The CVE exhibited a linear association with the BMI, where the lowest risk was observed for normal weight subjects in a general Korean population...|$|R
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of obesity among children and adults is increasing worldwide. There are substantial health risks and financial {{costs associated with the}} obesity epidemic that impact the practice of orthopaedic surgery. Patients with increased body mass index are more prone to sustaining distal extremity injuries than are those with a normal body mass index. Obese individuals are more likely than nonobese individuals to seek treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee. Body mass index (BMI) is defined as the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters (kg/m 2) 1. Adults with <b>a</b> <b>BMI</b> of 25 to 29. 9 are considered overweight, whereas those with <b>a</b> <b>BMI</b> of ‡ 30 are regarded as obese.
