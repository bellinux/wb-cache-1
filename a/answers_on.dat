5|$|On February 14, 2017, Yelp {{launched}} a Yelp Questions and Answers, new feature {{that allows the}} users to ask venue specific questions related to businesses. It allows users to upvote and downvote the <b>answers</b> <b>on</b> the basis of helpfulness.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} round, the contestants {{are asked to}} predict the most popular answer to each of three {{question}}s. Each question has three multiple choice options, and was asked {{to a group of}} 100 men. The panel is allowed to offer their opinion on the correct answer while the contestants submit their <b>answers</b> <b>on</b> their tablet computers. Each correct prediction is worth $200.|$|E

25|$|Some of the <b>answers</b> <b>on</b> {{the show}} have been disputed and {{shown to be}} incorrect. For example, in Series A, the show claimed that the longest animal {{in the world was}} the lion's mane jellyfish, but this was later {{corrected}} in Series C, saying that the longest animal in the world is the bootlace worm.|$|E
25|$|Subsequent {{questions}} are played for increasingly large sums, roughly doubling at each turn. The first few questions often have some joke <b>answers.</b> <b>On</b> episodes of the UK version aired between 1998 and 2007, the payout structure was as follows: first going from £100 to £300 in increments of £100, then from £500 to £64,000 with the pound value doubling for each new question, and finally from £125,000 to £1,000,000 with the pound value doubling for each new question.|$|E
25|$|His most {{important}} theological {{work is the}} Amphilochia, a collection of some 300 questions and <b>answers</b> <b>on</b> difficult points in Scripture, addressed to Amphilochius, archbishop of Cyzicus. Other similar works are his treatise in four books against the Manichaeans and Paulicians, and his controversy with the Latins on the Procession of the Holy Spirit. Photios also addressed a long letter of theological advice to the newly converted Boris I of Bulgaria. Numerous other Epistles also survive.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the indexed search results, DuckDuckGo displays relevant results, called Instant <b>Answers,</b> <b>on</b> top of the search page. These Instant Answers are collected from either 3rd party APIs or static data sources like text files. The Instant Answers are called zeroclickinfo because the intention behind these is to provide what the user is searching for on the search result page itself so that the user doesn't have to click any results to find what they are looking for. As of August 20, 2016, there are 989 Instant Answers active.|$|E
25|$|On the ACT, each {{question}} correctly answered is worth one raw point. There is no penalty for marking incorrect <b>answers</b> <b>on</b> the multiple-choice {{part of the}} test. Therefore, a student can answer all questions without suffering a decrease in their score for questions they answer incorrectly. This is parallel to several AP Tests eliminating the penalties for incorrect answers. To improve the result, students can retake the test: 55% of students who retake the ACT improve their scores, 22% score the same, and 23% see their scores decrease.|$|E
25|$|As in the 1970s version, two {{contestant}}s {{have two}} chances to match {{as many of}} the six celebrities as possible. Celebrity answers are printed in the booklets, and after the contestant gives an answer, the M.C. reads the celebrity responses one by one, marking correct <b>answers</b> <b>on</b> the game board. A contestant can get up to six matches in one game. The contestant with the most matches plays the Super Match round (the MC reads the question and the responses) for a chance to win money (with an Audience Match and a Head-to-Head Match similar to the TV show) of up to $5,000.|$|E

25|$|Answers {{are worth}} one point {{for every person}} in the 100-member survey who gave them. The winning family in each round scores the total points for all {{revealed}} answers to that question, including those given during the face-off but excluding the one used to steal (if applicable). The number of <b>answers</b> <b>on</b> the board decreases from round to round, and as the game progresses, certain rounds are played for double or triple point value. The first family to score 300 points wins the game and advances to the Fast Money bonus round for a chance to win a cash bonus. Until 1992, both teams received $1 per point scored.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} 17 years, Gandalf {{travelled}} extensively, searching for <b>answers</b> <b>on</b> the Ring. He found some answers in Isildur's scroll, {{in the archives}} of Minas Tirith. But he also wanted to interview Gollum, who had borne the Ring for many years. Gandalf searched long and widely for Gollum, and often had the assistance of Aragorn. Aragorn eventually succeeded, and Gandalf questioned Gollum, threatening him with fire when he proved unwilling to speak. Gandalf learned finally that Sauron had forced Gollum under torture in Barad-dûr to tell what he knew of the Ring. This reinforced Gandalf's growing suspicion that Bilbo's ring was the One Ring.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, some have criticised the over-reliance on private tuition, saying that {{students}} may not pay attention during lessons as {{they are able to}} fall back on their tuition classes later. Students may also be unable to find <b>answers</b> <b>on</b> their own, having relied on their tutors for answers during their school years. Some tuition centres reportedly do schoolwork on their students' behalf. Others have also criticised private tuition for taking up too much of students' free time. Due to the high cost of tuition, there are concerns that low-income families were unable to send their children for such classes. However, the government have partially subsidised private tuition at certain community bodies for children from low-income families.|$|E

25|$|The Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) is a {{national}} examination in Singapore that {{is administered by the}} Ministry of Education and taken by all students near the end of their sixth year in primary school before they move on to secondary school. The examination tests students' proficiency in the English language, their respective mother tongue languages (typically Chinese, Malay, Tamil or other Indian language), mathematics and science. Students have around two hours to complete each subject paper except for certain components of language subjects. Students answer multiple choice questions by shading their responses on a standardised optical answer sheet (OAS) that uses optical mark recognition to detect answers or by writing their workings and/or <b>answers</b> <b>on</b> the question booklet itself for certain sections of the paper.|$|E

Patrick then leaves after Robin says her work is more important then her family. Patrick soon files for divorce. It's revealed that Robin lied, and Jason is actually still alive. Victor threatened Robin into keeping quiet by having Rafe Kovich, Jr. (Jimmy Deshler) run Patrick's car off the road while he, Emma, and Sabrina were inside. Sabrina and Patrick's son, Gabriel, {{died as a result of}} the accident. Robin agrees to the divorce, despite being heartbroken.|$|E

500|$|A slow-paced, {{intimate}} R ballad, [...] "It's You" [...] features organ-like keyboards, pulsating {{beats and}} sparingly employed strings, piano, and electric guitar through its instrumentation. Lyrically, the song {{talks about a}} break-up, where the protagonist is desperate for <b>answers</b> <b>on</b> a failed relationship. Considered an album highlight by various reviewers, several critics additionally believed that the inspiration behind the track was Zayn's relationship with former girlfriend Perrie Edwards. [...] "It's You" [...] charted moderately around the world, including in the United Kingdom, Scotland, and the United States. The accompanying music video for the song was released on 26 February 2016 exclusively on the Apple Store and later on 28 March 2016.|$|E

The contestant in the chair earned money {{at a rate of}} $10 per second, even when bouts were not being played and during the prime time commercial breaks. When this contestant lost a bout, he/she stopped earning money and the challenger took control of the chair. Only the four contestants with the highest total winnings kept their money once the countdown clock ran out of time.|$|E
