Other types of <b>achondrogenesis</b> may exist, {{but they have not}} been characterized or their cause is unknown.|$|E
50|$|<b>Achondrogenesis,</b> type 1B {{is a rare}} genetic disorder; its {{incidence}} is unknown. <b>Achondrogenesis,</b> type 1B is {{the most}} severe condition in a spectrum of skeletal disorders caused by mutations in the SLC26A2 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that {{is essential for the}} normal development of cartilage and for its conversion to bone. Mutations in the SLC26A2 gene disrupt the structure of developing cartilage, preventing bones from forming properly and resulting in the skeletal problems characteristic of <b>achondrogenesis,</b> type 1B.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Achondrogenesis</b> type 2: Several {{kinds of}} {{mutations}} in the COL2A1 gene {{are responsible for}} <b>achondrogenesis,</b> type 2. These mutations may include missing pieces of the COL2A1 gene, substitution of the amino acid building-block glycine with another amino acid, or changes that cause important parts of the protein to be left out. All of these mutations prevent the normal production of mature type II collagen, which results in <b>achondrogenesis,</b> type 2 by affecting tissues that are rich in type II collagen.|$|E
50|$|<b>Achondrogenesis</b> type 1B {{is caused}} by a similar {{mutation}} in SLC26A2, which encodes a sulfate transporter.|$|E
50|$|<b>Achondrogenesis</b> is {{a number}} of {{disorders}} that are the most severe form of congenital chondrodysplasia (malformation of bones and cartilage). These conditions are characterized by a small body, short limbs, and other skeletal abnormalities. As {{a result of their}} serious health problems, infants with <b>achondrogenesis</b> are usually born prematurely, are stillborn, or die shortly after birth from respiratory failure. Some infants, however, have lived for a while with intensive medical support.|$|E

50|$|Hypochondrogenesis is a subtype of collagenopathy, types II and XI, and {{is similar}} to another {{skeletal}} disorder, <b>achondrogenesis</b> type 2, although the spinal changes seen in hypochondrogenesis tend to be somewhat milder.|$|E
50|$|<b>Achondrogenesis,</b> type 2 and hypochondrogenesis (a similar {{skeletal}} disorder) together affect 1 in 40,000 to 60,000 births. <b>Achondrogenesis,</b> type 2 is one {{of several}} skeletal disorders caused by mutations in the COL2A1 gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that forms type II collagen. This type of collagen is found mostly in cartilage and in the clear gel that fills the eyeball (the vitreous). It is essential for the normal development of bones and other tissues that form the body's supportive framework (connective tissues). Mutations in the COL2A1 gene interfere with the assembly of type II collagen molecules, which prevents bones and other connective tissues from developing properly.|$|E
50|$|<b>Achondrogenesis</b> type 1A {{is caused}} by a defect in the microtubules of the Golgi apparatus. In mice, a {{nonsense}} mutation in the thyroid hormone receptor interactor 11 gene (Trip11), which encodes the Golgi microtubule-associated protein 210 (GMAP-210), resulted in defects similar to the human disease. When their DNA was sequenced, human patients with <b>achondrogenesis</b> type 1A also had loss-of-function mutations in GMAP-210. GMAP-210 moves proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. Because of the defect, GMAP-210 is not able to move the proteins, and they remain in the endoplasmic reticulum, which swells up. The loss of Golgi apparatus function affects some cells, such as those responsible for forming bone and cartilage, more than others.|$|E
50|$|<b>Achondrogenesis,</b> type 2 is {{considered}} an autosomal dominant disorder because one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. The disorder is not {{passed on to the}} next generation, however, because affected individuals hardly survive past puberty.|$|E
50|$|Infants with <b>achondrogenesis,</b> type 2 have short {{arms and}} legs, a small chest with short ribs, and {{underdeveloped}} lungs. <b>Achondrogenesis,</b> type 2 is a subtype of collagenopathy, types II and XI. This condition is {{also associated with}} a lack of bone formation (ossification) in the spine and pelvis. Typical facial features include a prominent forehead, a small chin, and, in some cases, an opening in the roof of the mouth (a cleft palate). The abdomen is enlarged, and affected infants often have a condition called hydrops fetalis in which excess fluid builds up in the body before birth. The skull bones may be soft, but they often appear normal on X-ray images. In contrast, bones in the spine (vertebrae) and pelvis do not harden.|$|E

50|$|<b>Achondrogenesis,</b> type 1B is {{inherited}} in an {{autosomal recessive}} pattern, which means {{two copies of}} the gene in each cell are altered.

50|$|This gene encodes the alpha-1 {{chain of}} type II {{collagen}}, a fibrillar collagen found in cartilage and the vitreous humor of the eye. Mutations in this gene {{are associated with}} <b>achondrogenesis,</b> chondrodysplasia, early onset familial osteoarthritis, SED congenita, Langer-Saldino <b>achondrogenesis,</b> Kniest dysplasia, Stickler syndrome type I, and spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia Strudwick type. In addition, defects in processing chondrocalcin, a calcium binding protein that is the C-propeptide of this collagen molecule, are also associated with chondrodysplasia. There are two transcripts identified for this gene.Type II collagen, which adds structure and strength to connective tissues, is found primarily in cartilage, the jelly-like substance that fills the eyeball (the vitreous), the inner ear, and the center portion of the discs between the vertebrae in the spine (nucleus pulposus). Three pro-alpha1(II) chains twist {{together to form a}} triple-stranded, ropelike procollagen molecule. These procollagen molecules must be processed by enzymes in the cell. Once these molecules are processed, they leave the cell and arrange themselves into long, thin fibrils that cross-link to one another in the spaces around cells. The cross-linkages result in the formation of very strong mature type II collagen fibers.|$|E
50|$|Spondyloepiphyseal {{dysplasia}} congenita (abbreviated to SED {{more often}} than SDC) is a rare disorder of bone growth that results in dwarfism, characteristic skeletal abnormalities, and occasionally problems with vision and hearing.

40|$|<b>Achondrogenesis</b> type I is a perinatally lethal, short-limb chondrodysplasia. Two types, IA and IB, {{have been}} {{distinguished}} by radiographic and histological criteria; both types {{appear to be}} inherited as autosomal recessive traits. The underlying molecular defects are not known, but histochemical {{studies have suggested that}} in <b>achondrogenesis</b> type IB, cartilage matrix is deficient in sulfated proteoglycans. We have studied cartilage extracts of one newborn with <b>achondrogenesis</b> type IB and found that proteoglycans were quantitatively reduced, and, unlike in control cartilage, they did not stain with toluidine blue and did not bind to DEAE. Impaired synthesis of sulfated proteoglycans was observed also in fibroblast cultures of the <b>achondrogenesis</b> IB patient. Radioactive labeling and immunoprecipitation studies indicated that core protein and side chains of proteoglycans were synthesized normally but were not sulfated. Analysis of sulfate metabolism in fibroblast cultures showed, in the patient's cells, normal intracellular levels of free sulfate but markedly reduced levels of the two intermediate compounds in the sulfate activation pathway, adenosine-phosphosulfate and phosphoadenosine-phosphosulfate. The results can be explained by deficient activity of one of the enzymes responsible for the biologic activation of sulfate, possibly similar to that observed in cartilage (but not in skin) of the recessive, nonlethal mouse mutant brachymorphic and leading to defective sulfation of macromolecules. Expression of the sulfation defect in cultured fibroblasts may offer a diagnostic tool for the disorder...|$|E
40|$|<b>Achondrogenesis</b> type IB is {{a lethal}} {{osteochondrodysplasia}} caused by mutations in the diastrophic dysplasia sulfate transporter gene. How these mutations {{lead to the}} skeletal phenotype is not known. Histology of plastic-embedded skeletal fetal <b>achondrogenesis</b> type IB samples suggested that interterritorial epiphyseal cartilage matrix was selectively missing. Cartilage was organized in "chondrons" separated by cleft spaces; chondrocyte seriation, longitudinal septa, and, in turn, mineralized cartilaginous septa were absent. Agenesis of interterritorial matrix as the key histologic change was confirmed by immunohistology using specific markers of territorial and interterritorial matrix. Biglycan-enriched territorial matrix was preserved; decorin-enriched interterritorial areas were absent, although immunostaining was observed within chondrocytes. Thus, in <b>achondrogenesis</b> type IB: (1) a complex derangement in cartilage matrix assembly lies downstream of the deficient sulfate transporter activity; (2) the severely impaired decorin deposition participates in the changes in matrix organization with lack of development of normal interterritorial matrix; and (3) this change determines the lack of the necessary structural substrate for proper endochondral bone formation and explains the severe skeletal phenotype...|$|E
40|$|The <b>achondrogenesis</b> in its subgroupes type IA, IB and II marks one of {{the most}} severe osteochondrodystrophies, always causing death {{prenatal}} or perinatal. This thesis delivers a review about most and the most important contributions to the literature about <b>achondrogenesis.</b> Following this, detailed examinations of own cases with achondro-genesis type II are presented. The main interest in the examinations 1. have been laid on the way the collagen type II gets exchanged mainly into collagen type I in the epiphysal cartilage tissue, 2. the way of ossification in the bones while enchondral ossification is disordered, and 3. the actual way of bone growth in <b>achondrogenesis.</b> Statements are also made regarding other peculiarities of the <b>achondrogenesis</b> type II, as there are polyhydramnion, premature birth, stillbirth, respiratory insufficiency, bent bones or others, described in the literature, but not yet clearly causal. During own examinations three cases with <b>achondrogenesis</b> type II of the 17 th, 31 th and 34 th week of gestation were looked at. The infants had been examined in six steps regarding 1. physical, 2. radiological, 3. visceral, 4. anatomical and histological development in 5. general and 6. detailed view. This approach made it possible to compare physical, radiological and anatomical results with histological results. Genetic mutations in COL 2 A 1, the gene for collagen type II, lead to defective and missing collagen type II, which causes a failure in the mechanical strain of the modified epiphysal cartilage tissue in the articulations. This way, forces on the joints also affect the non-cartilage tissues, mainly by stimulating the fibrocytes in the paravascular tissue, causing increase and dilatation of the fibrovascular structures in the <b>achondrogenesis</b> type II. The production of this substituting tissue leads to all that special attributes of the epiphysal cartilage in achondro-genesis type II. It also generates different forms of ossification at the metaphysis and even in the epiphysis. Similarly, growth of the periostal bone is substitutively stimulated and causes growth of the entire bone, normally occurring enchondral. The mechanical forces on the joints influence the remarkable threefold-layered periostal rings around the border of the metaphysis, which definitely are wider and higher in the <b>achondrogenesis</b> than normally. At the outside is a layer in continuation of the clear wider periost. The middle layer shows numerous cells and corresponds to the cambium below the periost. The osseous part of the ring borders the metaphysis. The outside and the top of the osseous ring is covered by osteocytes, generating irregular growth of the entire bone in length and width. External forces like traction and compression, acting differently on the rings around the metaphyses via joints and periost, also cause the bending of bones. This in turn is responsible for the secondary periostal proliferation, causing a deposition of osteoid on the statically delicate bones...|$|E

40|$|<b>Achondrogenesis</b> II-hypochondrogenesis {{and severe}} spondyloepiphyseal {{dysplasia}} congenita (SEDC) are lethal forms of dwarfism caused by dominant mutations {{in the type}} II collagen gene (COL 2 A 1). To identify the underlying defect in seven cases with this group of conditions, we used the combined strategy of cartilage protein analysis and COL 2 A 1 mutation analysis. Overmodified type II collagen {{and the presence of}} type I collagen was found in the cartilage matrix of all seven cases. Five patients were heterozygous for a nucleotide change that predicted a glycine substitution in the triple helical domain (G 313 S, G 517 V, G 571 A, G 910 C, G 943 S). In all five cases, analysis of cartilage type II collagen suggested incorporation of the abnormal α 1 (II) chain in the extracellular collagen trimers. The G 943 S mutation has been reported previously in another unrelated patient with a strikingly similar phenotype, illustrating the possible specific effect of the mutation. The radiographically less severely affected patient was heterozygous for a 4  bp deletion in the splice donor site of intron 35, likely to result in aberrant splicing. One case was shown to be heterozygous for a single nucleotide change predicted to result in a T 1191 N substitution in the carboxy-propeptide of the proα 1 (II) collagen chain. Study of the clinical, radiographic, and morphological features of the seven cases supports evidence for a phenotypic continuum between <b>achondrogenesis</b> II-hypochondrogenesis and lethal SEDC and suggests a relationship between the amount of type I collagen in the cartilage and the severity of the phenotype.    Keywords: type II collagen disorders; <b>achondrogenesis</b> II-hypochondrogenesis; spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita; COL 2 A...|$|E
40|$|Establishing {{the genetic}} basis of phenotypes such as {{skeletal}} dysplasia in model organisms can provide insights into biologic processes {{and their role}} in human disease. We screened mutagenized mice and observed a neonatal lethal skeletal dysplasia with an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Through genetic mapping and positional cloning, we identified the causative mutation. Affected mice had a nonsense mutation in the thyroid hormone receptor interactor 11 gene (Trip 11), which encodes the Golgi microtubule-associated protein 210 (GMAP- 210); the affected mice lacked this protein. Golgi architecture was disturbed in multiple tissues, including cartilage. Skeletal development was severely impaired, with chondrocytes showing swelling and stress in the endoplasmic reticulum, abnormal cellular differentiation, and increased cell death. Golgi-mediated glycosylation events were altered in fibroblasts and chondrocytes lacking GMAP- 210, and these chondrocytes had intracellular accumulation of perlecan, an extracellular matrix protein, but not of type II collagen or aggrecan, two other extracellular matrix proteins. The similarities between the skeletal and cellular phenotypes in these mice and those in patients with <b>achondrogenesis</b> type 1 A, a neonatal lethal form of skeletal dysplasia in humans, suggested that <b>achondrogenesis</b> type 1 A {{may be caused by}} GMAP- 210 deficiency. Sequence analysis revealed loss-of-function mutations in the 10 unrelated patients with <b>achondrogenesis</b> type 1 A whom we studied. GMAP- 210 is required for the efficient glycosylation and cellular transport of multiple proteins.

Protein analysis of collagen from cartilage indicated posttranslational overmodification of the major cyanogen bromide peptides, and suggested a mutation near the carboxyl terminus of the type II collagen molecule. Analysis at the DNA level demonstrated that the phenotype was produced by a single base change (G [...] >C) that resulted in the substitution of glycine(691) by arginine in the type II collagen triple helical domain.

40|$|A lethal short-limbed {{dwarfism}} {{was diagnosed}} at autopsy as the Langer-Saldino variant of <b>achondrogenesis</b> by radiological, histological, and gross pathological criteria. Cartilage was obtained for biochemical and ultrastructural analyses from {{the ends of}} long bones, from ribs and from a scapula of the newborn infant. At all sites, it had an abnormal gelatinous texture and translucent appearance. Biochemical analyses of the cartilages to identify pepsin-solubilized collagen alpha-chains and collagen-specific CNBr-peptides failed to detect type II collagen at any site where it would normally be the main constituent. Instead, type I was the predominant collagen present. However, three cartilage-specific minor collagen chains identified as 1 alpha, 2 alpha, and 3 alpha chains by their electrophoretic mobility were present at about 10 % of the total collagen. Cartilage-specific proteoglycans also appeared to be abundant in the tissue judging by its high hexosamine content and high ratio of galactosamine to glucosamine.
