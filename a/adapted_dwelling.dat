40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to investigate the energy use and environmental impact of residential buildings. Seven authentic buildings built in the 1990 s in Sweden are investigated. They are analysed according to energy use and environmental impact during their life cycle: manufacture of building materials, transport of building materials and components to the building site, erection to a building, occupancy, maintenance and renovation, and finally demolition and removal of debris. Results show that approx. 85 % of the total estimated energy use during the life cycle is used during the occupation phase. The energy used to manufacture building and installation materials constitutes approx. 15 % of the total energy use. 70 - 90 % of the total environmental impact arises during the occupation phase, while the manufacture of construction and installation materials constitutes 10 - 20 %. In conclusion, the energy use and environmental impact during the occupation phase make up {{a majority of the}} total. At the end of the thesis, a tool is presented which helps designers and clients predict the energy use during the occupation phase for a future multi-family building before any constructional or installation drawings are made. In this way, different thermal properties may be elaborated in order to receive an energy-efficient and environmentally <b>adapted</b> <b>dwelling...</b>|$|E
40|$|After the Second World War, the Flemish {{region was}} confronted with massive suburbanisation. The privately owned, {{detached}} single family house became the dominant building type located in residential subdivisions, ribbon developments or as piecemeal developments scattered through the landscape. This PhD dissertation focuses on the widespread phenomenon of residential underuse: houses inhabited by fewer people than the surface and number of bedrooms would allow for. Today, the concerns about the sustainability of the underused suburban housing stock are growing. The social concerns regard the maladjustment of these large dwellings located in low density residential environments for the ageing population. In addition, {{because of the high}} amount of underused houses inhabited by empty nesters, young families with children in search of an affordable house in a green setting cant get access to them. The environmental concerns regard the high ecological footprint of these underused houses: outdated on energy performance and underused, the energy use of these houses per inhabitant is high. The underuse of the housing stock also results in higher surfaces of extensively built on land. The economic concerns regard the inefficient use of the available housing stock and the growing gap between demand and offer. Because of the ageing population and the decrease in family sizes, the demand for spacious single family houses in suburban Flanders will decrease in the future. The goal of this PhD dissertation is twofold: gaining insight in the experiences of people living in underused houses and formulating appropriate policies for a transformation of the underused suburban housing stock. In line with the Actor-Network Theory (ANT), underuse is approached as a process and the underused home is conceptualized as a dynamic network of infinitely interconnected actors, including the underused house and the overhoused inhabitant. For our twofold research goal, ANT is combined with the emancipatory agenda of Critical Theory. The research is based on an interdisciplinary perspective with material stemming from 61 home visits and interviews with home owners  predominantly empty nesters  living in underused, detached single family houses in 10 municipalities geographically dispersed over the Flemish region, supplemented with 20 interviews with key informants. The diagnostic part of the dissertation focuses on the intersection of the homes materiality, imaginaries and home making practices of empty nesters. When children leave the parental house, suddenly the normal functioning of the home is disrupted and this is reflected in the use and appearance of the house. But this unravelling of existing relations doesnt lead to transformations overcoming the typology of the single family house. The suburban home proves to be a very stable network, largely resistant to changes in the household situation. Based on the fieldwork, the image of ageing home owners for whom life in the underused house is problematic can be refined. In Flanders, there certainly is a privileged group of home owners who are in good health and have sufficient financial resources to age relatively trouble-free in the spacious family house. These houses fulfil an important role both {{in the lives of the}} empty nesters and in the extended family life. With regard to the phenomenon of residential underuse, multiple strategies are currently applied or discussed focusing either on the overhoused people or on the underused houses: home care to allow people to age in place, move-in-time to stimulate the elderly to move out to an <b>adapted</b> <b>dwelling,</b> house subdivision to subdivide or share spacious dwellings, and neighbourhood transformation which involves a spatially selective transformation of suburban neighbourhoods. Based on the research, the image of sedentary villa owners not willing to renounce their spacious dwelling can be refined. The desire for independence and self-sufficiency surpasses the emotional bond with the house or neighbourhood: empty nesters in general plan to move out when the underused house would become too much of a burden. A public support analysis on different neighbourhood transformation strategies  reconfiguration, replacement or removal  shows the largest support for (or least resistance against) the reconfiguration strategy consisting of incremental infill through house and plot subdivision. However, the interest to subdivide the private dwelling is rather limited, mainly because it is conceived as a privacy infringement. Today, the suburban housing stock proves to be very obdurate resulting of a complex entanglement of very heterogeneous elements such as the materiality of the house, the meaning of home, the local home culture, real estate values, spatial policies, zoning plans, the legislative framework, taxes, and regional and local politics. This PhD dissertation advocates a sustainable reassembling of the suburban housing stock. The term sustainable refers to an improvement of the social, economic and ecological performance of the post war suburban housing stock. The term reassembling refers to a transformation process which deals with both the spatial, social, political and economic aspects of suburban housing, directed at both the overhoused people and the underused houses. The basic principles for this sustainable reassembling are a collaborative planning process, a spatially selective, integral and integrated approach, and a responsibilization of the involved actors. status: publishe...|$|E

This fits into current urban planning policy in the Netherlands, which aims at combining housing and economic functions within neighborhoods. Since {{an increasing number of}} entrepreneurs start from home, this calls for insight in the combination of work and home. However, there is limited knowledge about the specific role of the dwelling in the decision to start a firm from home and to stay put. This explorative paper focuses {{on the use of the}} dwelling as location of a firm, both in the start-up phase and beyond in the firm life course, and its explanations. Our research questions are: what determines the decision to start a firm within the dwelling of the entrepreneur and its duration in time, and how does this relate to the propensity and decision to move? In our empirical analyses a combination of quantitative and qualitative research methods is used. We analyzed data from 130 questionnaires send out in April 2005 to young entrepreneurs who owned a firm in two Dutch urban neighborhoods. These questionnaires were followed by in-depth interviews with 10 entrepreneurs. We have found that most home based businesses did start from home and are strongly tied to the dwelling - and therefore the neighbourhood. Both firms with past growth in number of personnel and firms with growth aspirations do want to move relatively often. With respect to firm relocation and the personal propensity to move, housing characteristics as <b>adapted</b> <b>dwellings,</b> and owner-occupied, single family and large houses are important. With respect to future home-based business, to most firms breaking the work-home combination is not a realistic option. Household characteristics and more specifically the care of small children keeps entrepreneurs home-based. Also entrepreneurs who work almost full-time are relatively strong attached to their home, which may point to an explicit -and maybe also longlasting- choice for home-basedness. Economic policy should therefore foster start-ups within urban neighbourhoods, as many of them seem to be firmly anchored locally by attachment to their home. ...|$|R

Yet, for many years and through their own initiative, public housing dwellers have been engaged in alteration and extension activities aimed at <b>adapting</b> their <b>dwellings</b> to better suit their needs. These activities have resulted in the transformation of entire housing developments {{in many parts of the}} world. Therefore, this study examines the development of transformations in different public housing projects in Egypt and attempts to identify some of the implicit factors that control change at both dwelling and community levels. A wide array of transformation activities were recorded during a survey of twenty projects in Cairo and Alexandria, from which it was possible to establish a typology of transformations and to distinguish between different patterns through which they take place. One project (Ain el Sira) was chosen as a case study in order to examine change of dwelling characteristics from both external and internal aspects. It was found that user transformation of public housing projects should not be considered as a simple space enlargement process, but rather a result of a complex set of inter-related determinants associated with both context and dwelling characteristics. The finding also revealed that in favourable conditions, users were capable of successfully undertaking transformation activities which not only increased the range of used spaces within housing developments, but also created dynamic multi-functional estates that better respond to changing needs of households.

40|$|Housing {{managers}} are constantly {{confronted with the}} changing demands that their building stock has to comply with. One of the change agents is the changing climate, caused primarily by human induced greenhouse gases. Though, even if the emissions of all these gases could now be put to a hold, the process of climate change would not completely cease. Furthermore, the impacts of climate change would most probably be felt for many more years. In urban areas, the impacts are drought, flooding caused by extreme precipitation and heat stress caused by the urban heat island effect. Besides threatening the building stock, climate change is also threatening {{the quality of life}} of people in urban environments. In the Netherlands, housing associations are responsible for managing the social housing stock and maintaining their quality of life. Research has proven they are not yet aware of the challenge that lies ahead to <b>adapt</b> their <b>dwellings</b> to a changing climate. Considering the focus on the physical adaptations of the building stock, it was chosen to discuss in this paper the effectiveness of three types of governance strategies that housing associations can directly apply in their maintenance processes. The governance strategies are hypothesised based on research results of earlier studies on the implementation of climate change adaptations in social housing. The strategies are: S 1. Take up climate adaptation in the policy developments that guide the overall management of the stock; S 2. Involving actors that traditionally stand aside the construction process, such as insurance companies and water boards; S 3. Emphasising performance-based procurement stimulating the execution of the projects in a partnering approach. The effectiveness of the strategies was tested by means of a SWOT analysis per strategy with practitioners. Results are five scenarios, based on the combinations of strategies that are potentially feasible for the implementation of climate change adaptation measures in the Dutch social housing stock. A crucial factor in the scenarios is collaboration, because nowadays a housing association is not (financially) capable of assuming the responsibility of climate proofing its housing stock all by itself.

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the serial, International Journal of Disaster Resilience in the Built Environment [© Emerald Group Publishing Limited]. The definitive version is available at: [URL] – Dwelling retrofit strategies generally concentrate on measures to reduce energy use and carbon emissions. However, climate change projections predict increases in both the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, including heat waves. It is predicted that by the 2040 s severe heat waves similar to the European one in August 2003 may be expected to occur every year. Future guidance therefore needs to combine mitigation with adaptation in order to provide safe and comfortable dwellings, whilst also reducing heating energy use, within the available retrofit budget. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach – The research presented here used dynamic thermal simulation (EnergyPlus) to model a range of passive interventions on selected dwelling types to predict the effect on both dwelling overheating during a heat wave and annual space heating energy use. The interventions include modifications and additions to solar control, insulation and ventilation. Findings – Results demonstrate the effectiveness of interventions that reduce solar heat gains, with external shutters fitted to windows being the most effective single intervention in many cases. Solar reflective coatings also reduce overheating but lead to increased winter heating energy use, whilst wall insulation reduces heating energy use but can, in some cases, lead to increased overheating. The choice of wall insulation type is shown to be very important, with external insulation consistently performing better than internal for overheating reduction. The modelling further demonstrates that combined interventions can significantly reduce or in many cases eliminate overheating. Overheating exposure was found to vary significantly (up to a factor of ten times) between dwelling types. It can be significantly greater for residents who have to stay at home during the daytime, such as the elderly or infirm, and different interventions are sometimes more suitable in these cases. Originality/value – An innovative modelling methodology integrating overheating reduction, heating energy use and intervention cost has been developed and implemented for <b>adapting</b> UK <b>dwellings</b> to future heat waves.

40|$|The {{substitution}} of low-performance gas and fuel boilers by air to water electrical heat pumps {{is a solution}} to meet the energy challenge to reduce GHG dwellings emissions. Indeed, most dwelling emissions in Europe are due to heating and DHW generation with fossil fuels. Apart from low carbon emissions, high energy savings are expected from rated performances, but an AWHP may not deliver the expected efficiency because of a bad commissioning. Nowadays, these machines present {{a high number of}} parameters – over 40 on average – to be set during the installation, which makes this process very complex. Unfortunately, the parameter setting is a crucial step for the proper operation of the system throughout its life cycle. A non-optimal choice of AWHP parameters may lead to severe performance losses or discomfort. The first part of the paper describes the functions and parameters that the installer must adjust for the commissioning phase. In a second step, the consequences of a non-optimal parameterization of an AWHP are evaluated. This analysis is based on a computer model using Modelica language. The model consists of a heating system, installed in a typical detached dwelling. Simulations are run by pairing the heat pump with the dwelling and the heating system. Simulations show the potential energy savings and the accuracy of indoor air control when control parameters, in particular the heating curve, are <b>adapted</b> to the <b>dwelling</b> and to the heating network.

The leave of the own independent living for a move home to a Nursing hospital gives an indication of availability of a good living environment. Four main motives for leaving the own home were found: bad health condition, available good housing conditions, loneliness effects and the anxiousness for absence of future care-provisions. In this paper are explored answers for the motives to leave independent living for lifetime, which give criteria for dwelling design decisions, suitable for older growing persons. Possible Answers Formulated is a dwelling type, independent living for lifetime. This dwelling type consists in a general dwelling, which is used during lifetime, and in rules for design decisions, that facilitate flexibility to mutations, needed to <b>adapt</b> the <b>dwelling</b> on eventual individual ambitions. Exploration of the answers to health threat, loneliness, lacking dwelling quality and absence is focused on solutions within the competence of dwelling design. Results The exploration of answers resulted in the 5 following conditions: (1) A dwelling type, independent for lifetime, flexible to the potential mutations in functional use as a result of non-pathologic- ageing inhabitants during its planned exploitation-time; (2) A dwelling-design method, with a circular decision loop for each design decision phase and decision notation, based on 2 types of decisions, for the Conditional Interval and for Material Selection.

The control of Chrysops has not been considered as a viable cost-effective intervention; we reviewed the current knowledge of Chrysops vectors to assess the potential for control as well as identified areas for future research. We identified 89 primary published documents on the two main L. loa vectors C. silacea and C dimidiata. These were collated into a database summarising the publication, field and laboratory procedures, species distributions, ecology, habitats and methods of vector control. The majority of articles were from the 1950 - 1960 s. Field studies conducted in Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Nigeria and Sudan highlighted that C. silacea is the most important and widespread vector. This species breeds in muddy streams or swampy areas of forests or plantations, descends from forest canopies to feed on humans during the day, is more readily <b>adapted</b> to human <b>dwellings</b> and attracted to wood fires. Main vector targeted measures proposed to impact on L. loa transmission included personal repellents, household screening, indoor residual spraying, community-based environmental management, adulticiding and larviciding.

It highlights key vector transmission characteristics that may be targeted for vector control providing insights into the potential for integrated vector management, with multiple diseases being targeted simultaneously, with shared human and financial resources and multiple impact. Integrated vector management programmes for filarial infections, especially in low transmission areas of onchocerciasis, require innovative approaches and alternative strategies if the elimination targets established by the World Health Organization are to be achieved...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. The biology, ecology and behavior of Ochrimnus mimulus are described as they relate to its host plant, Baccharis spp. The ecological association between 0. mimulus and Baccharis was examined to determine temporal life cycle correspondence and insect host specificity. 0. mimulus is host specific for Baccharis and extremely host specific for asteraceous plants, both in the field and in dichotomous choice oviposition experiments. 0. mimulus population size and constitution fluctuate on an annual cycle that tightly corresponds to reproductive events in the plant's life cycle. The average population size of adult 0. mimulus per Baccharis bush in Brazos County, Texas is 165 in September, 101 in October and 64 in November. 0. mimulus adults are numerous on Baccharis in September, adults and nymphs are found from October through December, and from January until August the insect leaves the plant, often gathering in hibernaculae. The seed feeding habit of the insect, its oviposition behavior and egg shape appear specifically <b>adapted</b> for Baccharis <b>dwelling.</b> The egg and first through fifth instars of 0. mimulus are described along with their stadia and phenology. Photoperiod and food availability both influence oviposition in 0. mimulus females, and when these factors are combined there is an interactive effect. Food availability also influences the stadia of 0. mimulus nymphs. Field observations of anti-predator behavior in 0. mimulus demonstrate that its coloration is utilized in an aposematic display. Both nymphs and adults aggregate when disturbed, and they exude a distinctive odor. The insect was distasteful to Anolis carolinensis and these lizards displayed learned avoidance of 0. mimulus after an initial feeding attempt. It is clear that the insect uses volatile chemical deterrents, possibly ones derived from Baccharis. A coevolutionary relationship between 0. mimulus and Baccharis is a plausible explanation for many of the observed results...|$|R
3000|$|In {{the present}} study, {{it was found}} that at an age of 110 days (Table  1), A. marmorata had already metamorphosed and {{commenced}} migration to coastal waters of the northern Philippines, while A. japonica remained at the pelagic leptocephalus stage and continued to drift with currents in the open ocean until it reached northern Taiwan where it began to metamorphose approximately 24 days later. This must be the reason why the geographic distribution of A. japonica is more northerly than that of A. marmorata. The metamorphosis of leptocephalus to glass eels transforms the laterally compressed, willow leaf-like shape of the former to a more rounded, streamlined shape of the latter. This transformation reportedly causes drastic reductions in the length and weight of the leptocephalus and an estimated 80 % drop in whole body water (Bertin 1951; Otake 2003). Previous studies found that the body shape of the leptocephalus is suitable for drifting with oceanic currents (Miller 2009; Tsukamoto et al. 2009; Tsukamoto et al. 2011). Also, the laterally compressed willow leaf-like body shape of the anguillid leptocephalus and the high body water content greatly contribute to its buoyancy and is favorable for passive planktonic drift and transport by ocean currents, while the body of the glass eel is more <b>adapted</b> for bottom <b>dwelling.</b> Once the leptocephalus metamorphose into a glass eel, it loses buoyancy and leaves the strong ocean currents. In other words, metamorphosis from a leptocephalus to a glass eel in anguillid species terminates the passive drift of eel larvae and initiates migration to coastal waters, and it also determines the ultimate destination of larval dispersal. The completion of eel larval metamorphosis and the onset of the juvenile stage initiate a behavioral shift from pelagic migration to bottom settlement (Moran 1994). Earlier metamorphosing leptocephali are recruited earlier, while delayed metamorphosis leptocephali are bound for longer oceanic dispersal and later estuarine recruitment. Metamorphosis occurs during migration from their offshore marine spawning grounds to their continental freshwater growth habitats, and it marks an adaptive shift from oceanic drifting to river colonization {{and the beginning of the}} continental dispersal phase (Edeline et al. 2009). DGIs in otoliths can conveniently provide the timing for metamorphosis (T [...]...|$|R
40|$|Background In Latin America, the bloodsucking bugs Triatominae are vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the {{parasite}} that causes Chagas disease. Chemical elimination {{programs have been}} launched to control Chagas disease vectors. However, the disease persists because native vectors from sylvatic habitats are able to (re) colonize houses-a process called domiciliation. Triatoma brasiliensis is one example. Because the chemosensory system allows insects to interact with their environment and {{plays a key role}} in insect adaption, we conducted a descriptive and comparative study of the chemosensory transcriptome of T. brasiliensis samples from different ecotopes. Methodology/Principal Finding In a reference transcriptome built using de novo assembly, we found transcripts encoding 27 odorant-binding proteins (OBPs), 17 chemosensory proteins (CSPs), 3 odorant receptors (ORs), 5 transient receptor potential channel (TRPs), 1 sensory neuron membrane protein (SNMPs), 25 takeout proteins, 72 cytochrome P 450 s, 5 gluthatione S-transferases, and 49 cuticular proteins. Using protein phylogenies, we showed that most of the OBPs and CSPs for T. brasiliensis had well supported orthologs in the kissing bug Rhodnius prolixus. We also showed a higher number of these genes within the bloodsucking bugs and more generally within all Hemipterans compared to the other species in the super-order Paraneoptera. Using both DESeq 2 and EdgeR software, we performed differential expression analyses between samples of T. brasiliensis, taking into account their environment (sylvatic, peridomiciliary and domiciliary) and sex. We also searched clusters of coexpressed contigs using HTSCluster. Among differentially expressed (DE) contigs, most were under-expressed in the chemosensory organs of the domiciliary bugs compared to the other samples and in females compared to males. We clearly identified DE genes that play a role in the chemosensory system. Conclusion/Significance Chemosensory genes could be good candidates for genes that contribute to adaptation or plastic rearrangement to an anthropogenic system. The domiciliary environment probably includes less diversity of xenobiotics and probably has more stable abiotic parameters than do sylvatic and peridomiciliary environments. This could explain why both detoxification and cuticle protein genes are less expressed in domiciliary bugs.

Because, this kind of dwelling has the following troubles: little space for the daily activities, storage problems and space adjustments. Also, the intact dwelling is the exception and it doesn’t the rule. Under these conditions, any dwelling is modified. Consequently, these transformations happen because the inhabitants are looking for flexibility and they <b>adapt</b> the initial <b>dwelling</b> to their reality. Additionally, these modifications break {{the quality of the}} habitat. In this context, it is important to study the housing state flexibility. Because the researches has been centered only in the transformations of the informal housing. But a few researches has been studied the transformations of the formal housing. Likewise, they are reduced the studies that analyze the processes that lead to the flexibility in the housing. The essay explain the residential cluster concept. It exposes how the flexibility behaves in the residential clusters. Also, it proposes that the flexibility is an important agent to housing state design and habitat. Finally, it proposes a habitat explicative model. Actualmente, en Bogotá, la producción de vivienda social no satisface las necesidades de sus usuarios. Porque, este tipo de vivienda presenta poco espacio para las actividades cotidianas y Problemas de almacenamiento. Así mismo, las viviendas dejadas intactas son la excepción y no la regla. Por consiguiente, estas transformaciones ocurren porque los habitantes buscan flexibilidad y pretenden adecuar la vivienda inicial a su realidad. Por otro lado, estas modificaciones pueden comprometer la calidad de la vivienda y su hábitat, en la medida en que pueden producir los siguientes efectos: densificación del hábitat existente y desarticulación espacial en su área de afectación y con la ciudad. Aquí radica el interés de estudiar la flexibilidad en la vivienda social, porque las investigaciones realizadas se han centrado en las transformaciones de la vivienda informal, pero muy pocos trabajos estudian las transformaciones en la vivienda formal. Además, son escasos los estudios que analizan los procesos que conducen a la flexibilidad en la vivienda. Este ensayo expone el concepto de conjunto residencial y su comportamiento frente a la necesidad de flexibilidad. Además, sugiere que la flexibilidad es una condición necesaria para el diseño de vivienda social y la producción de hábitat. Por último, propone un modelo explicativo de hábitat con calidad...|$|R
40|$|Do {{the house}} forms and {{residential}} neighborhoods {{commonly found in}} the U. S. accommodate the present needs and lifestyles {{of the people who}} live in them? The single-family detached house and multi-family units like the triple-decker originated in an era quite unlike the one in which we now find ourselves. I intend to explore the possibility that we may not have to <b>adapt</b> to a <b>dwelling</b> sensibility that is restrictive and inappropriate for the late 20 th and early 21 st centuries. Perhaps the result will not look radically different than the models we already know but will only function in a subtly different manner, for very specific reasons of use and daily life. I will design a piece of a residential neighborhood in Newton Upper Falls, Massachusetts based on the premise that the physical, organizational, and functional aspects of housing design do affect and can contribute to the quality of people's lives. Some questions that I find valid for exploration in the context of housing are: 1) can a mix of uses animate a neighborhood by providing commonly needed services and by reducing the isolation of the home from everything else in life: work, shopping, child care, entertainment?; 2) have we been perpetuating outdated Victorian ideals about the separation of work and home based on roles related to gender? If so, couldn't housing design be more progressive in supporting the way women and men actually live today rather than the way one's great-grandparents lived?;(cont.) 3) if women still perform most of the household chores and child-rearing in the U. S. (whether married, single, or divorced), with the majority of American women also working full-time and getting paid two-thirds the salary of men, couldn't there exist a type of housing that considers the enormous demands on a person's time, energy, and resources necessary to accomplish all of this? I intend to research selected examples of feminist and experimental housing designs prior to starting my own. The Danish precedent of cohousing and Dolores Hayden's historical research and interpretive stance will establish my basic approach to the design project and its program. The design will be further informed by my own rethinking of domestic life and the architectural implications of it, recorded in "patterns" similar in intention to those of Alexander, et al. by Leslie K. Hamanaka. Thesis (M. Arch.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Architecture, 1990. Includes bibliographical references (p. 69) ...|$|R
40|$|The neighbourhoods {{discussed}} here address {{different combinations of}} social issues, technical contexts and design options. Different logics of production are deployed, ranging from total renovation, to ex novo construction, or to incremental change. One could legitimately state that such variety does not allow any conclusive evidence, apart from warning that change follows disparate paths. However, the in-depth discussion of the case studies supports at least some logical and qualitative generalizations. The first of these is that at a closer look, all the solid neighbourhood characteristics “melt into air”. Even the seemingly obvious distinction between newly built and renovated neighbourhoods may get blurred eventually, since different logics of production for built space combine in the same area, as in Warsaw for instance; or because material and symbolic representations constantly interplay and evolve, as in Hvidore-Copenhagen; or because one logic intentionally or covertly evolves into another, as in Lisbon or Marseille. On the contrary, the storylines of neighbourhood development and redevelopment, though often showing argumentative loops, constitute the materiality of places. Bergsli in Marseille, Bøggild and Yde in Hvidore-Copenhagen, for instance, {{have focused on the}} ideological discourse that accompanies the actual construction of the neighbourhood. The analysis of the tense interplay between argumentation and power has enucleated the formal and practical logic imbedded in local events. Those discourses have directed the actors in assembling local and global policy repertoires. The resulting places are thus shaped by actions and discourses together. Eventually, the reconstruction of local narratives raises a question regarding the hidden structure of power, the overlap of discourses and policy communities. Such investigation provides an {{answer to the question of}} how neighbourhoods conflictually adjust to cities’ strategies. This is the case explored in Marseille, but is addressed also by Karachalis in Psiri, Annunziata in Rome and De Leo in Afragola. Neighbourhoods change, as often happens, as the result of the adaptation of builders' or inhabitants' practice to the cities’ changing context. All of the studies presented here raise questions such as the following. Does “post-modern” urban space offer any ground for the idea of social bonds? How do the new technicalities of sustainability, quality, and design interpret the condition of contemporary citizenships? What political ideas are incorporated in these spaces and designs; what aims, vision and layout are incorporated in the projects; what do they tell about the urbanity of the city to come? What is the place of ideology in building designers’, planners’ and decision-makers’ approach to the new organization of cities (public space, neighbourhoods) ? Consumers, visitors and tourists might seem to be the only actors included by the neoliberal agenda, but these projects are actually describing a more hybrid concern, an exercise that apparently requires a challenging reconceptualisation of space. But how are the outputs of these different construction processes turned into a neighbourhood? The renovation of brown fields or former port areas involves a debate on the sustainable design of such an investment, as well as its budgetary and economic balance. All these have been areas of growing involvement for the local authorities over the last 30 years, and several countries’ experiences (albeit quite dissimilar) have been extensively studied and often taken as an example or a model. Flagship projects too, like EuroMediterranée in Marseille and Parque das Nações in Lisbon (Bergsli's and Aelbrecht's chapters), raise issues of culture and design. Both exemplify the process of redeveloping former industrial or infrastructural areas into a strategic part of the new envisioned city. Large urban projects are often viewed as the local epiphany of the "single thought” that lies behind neoliberal urban redevelopments. However, the story of urban projects in Europe -as these chapters show- is far more complicated than the mainstream critique allows, due to the strength of societal intermediate networks and the local state. In fact, all developments show a consistent process of mediation that is subject to all sorts of influences by the state, the local communities, and the technical bodies. And how does the construction of the local public sphere take place in these extremely different urban landscapes? The illegal settlement in the metropolitan area of Naples (De Leo), for instance, has a peculiar epiphany: not just informally built by the inhabitants, but organized or controlled by organized crime. The rehabilitation of old public estates (Bielany, but also Hvidore) is usually achieved through a laborious process, which involves an openly contested and conflict-ridden political dimension. Social housing estates usually carry a concern with social impacts, and with the way urban policy addresses such concerns (Eckardt and Klocke, Górzynska). Relying upon different combinations of public and private ethos, all these case-studies question the emergence of the public sphere in a statu nascendi local community, and the model of urban citizenship incorporated by the organization of space. These processes are often referred to as a new request for urbanity. The central question is apparently that the political discussion needs to reflect on the disappointing results of the promises of the Habermasian “project of modernity” aiming at social cohesion, civic liberties, and general wealth. New residential neighbourhoods have been built that exemplify the contemporary effort to devise a way of living into the 21 st century (Trkulja and Annunziata). The model Ørestad neighbourhood in Copenhagen is far different in ambitions from the ordinary, privately promoted and designed and assembled Ponte di Nona district in Rome. Neighbourhoods built by design are a field experiment in linking urbanism and urbanity. Only the social nature of urban space might be controlled by design and planning rules, at least in part; the organization of social bonds, instead, are created and recreated by inhabitants in practical engagements. This link is the basis of a long and sound debate in both planning and sociology. The resulting public space is the main design challenge for those settlements, which differ entirely in purpose and quality. Political scientists and planners share a distinctive, yet not coinciding interest in the public space and the public sphere. The public sphere faces here the same risk of erosion as the public space, and might be rescued by the same process of <b>adapting</b> to the <b>dwelling</b> practices of the inhabitants. Renovated, gentrified, evolving districts, such as the cultural quarter of Psiri in Athens, the modernist experiment of Hvidore in Copenhagen, the transition areas surrounding Bielany in Warsaw, the inner city of in Frankfurt, all address the coexistence of different social groups in a shared space, and the political approach to such processes. A concern is growing with the ideology of places, and the 'political' uses of the image of old and new neighbourhoods. ‘Political’ is used here in the sense that the building of the image is the subject of a large confrontation among a number of factors, which interact strategically in a symbolically mediated field. This is precisely the case in those neighbourhoods labelled as “cultural districts”, or as gentrified or renaissance areas. In these cases we explore the political art of branding, renaming, and selling new products in a very mobile submarket: a submarket made of the investment activities of new agencies, and of the often blurred actions of different tiers of government. “Changing places” reflects the empirical evidence of neighbourhoods, taken as some form of local-societal entity, and against the background of more observations of developments in urban planning, local governance and in particular citizenship, but also of a wide reaching construction of narratives, discourses and ideologies. In doing so, this book is caught up in the paradoxical situation that “change” and the observation of it cannot be separated from the more profound idea of change as such. What really changes, beyond the ideology of change? That is the final question that has motivated this book...|$|R
