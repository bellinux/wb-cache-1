In this paper, several works have been done to find-out the effectiveness and feasibility of options to reduce greenhouses gases fluxes from agriculture land. The experiments were consisted field works by collecting greenhouse gases by closed-chamber technique. The changes of microbial community structure were observed both by most probable number and standard plate count. The results suggest that 1) There are a potential for reducing emissions of N 2 O by applying nitrification inhibitor in arable land, while The CH 4 flux was reduced by controlled water level in rice field, 2) Types of nitrogen fertilizers influenced the N 2 O productions but did not significantly alter the structure of microbial communities...|$|E
