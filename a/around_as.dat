5|$|Following the Napoleonic wars, Denmark lost Norway and was {{excluded}} from international trade {{for some years}} which caused a recession for Aarhus' trade-based economy that lasted until the 1830s.

5|$|The 1866 {{construction}} was considerably stronger, {{compared to the}} two previous spans, due to major renovations. The old cables that snapped {{had been replaced by}} newer, stronger ones. Thomas also gave the span a new deck floor, a bridge railing and new stringers. The bridge was much better cared for this time <b>around,</b> <b>as</b> it also survived a local flood in 1903 and an icestorm in the early months of spring 1904.|$|E

5|$|By the 1990s {{crime rates}} started to drop {{dramatically}} due to revised police strategies, improving economic opportunities, gentrification, and new residents, both American transplants and new immigrants from Asia and Latin America. Murder rates that had reached 2,245 in 1990 plummeted to 537 by 2008, and the crack epidemic {{and its associated}} drug-related violence came under greater control. The outflow of population turned <b>around,</b> <b>as</b> the city once again became the destination of immigrants from around the world, joining with low interest rates and Wall Street bonuses to fuel {{the growth of the}} real estate market. Important new sectors, such as Silicon Alley, emerged in Manhattan's economy.|$|E
5|$|Increasingly, {{however, the}} ice trade {{began to focus}} on {{supplying}} the growing cities on the east coast of the U.S. and the needs of businesses across the Midwest. The citizens of New York City and Philadelphia became huge consumers of ice during their long, hot summers, and additional ice was harvested from the Hudson River and Maine to fulfil the demand. Ice began to be used in refrigerator cars by the railroad industry, allowing the meat packing industry around Chicago and Cincinnati to slaughter cattle locally, sending dressed meat east for either the internal or overseas markets. Chilled refrigerator cars and ships created a national industry in vegetables and fruit that could previously only have been consumed locally. American and British fishermen began to preserve their catches in ice, allowing longer voyages and bigger catches, and the brewing industry became operational all-year <b>around.</b> <b>As</b> U.S. ice exports diminished after 1870, Norway became {{a major player in the}} international market, shipping large quantities of ice to England and Germany.|$|E
5|$|Independently of Schmid's actions, another {{figure has}} also been {{credited}} with ensuring Gisela took place. Heinz-Wolfgang Schnaufer—who was to the end the war as the most successful night fighter ace on 121 aerial victories—was said to have attempted to gain support for a like-minded offensive. Schnaufer pursued RAF bombers regularly to the English coast, or least {{the other side of}} the frontline. He experienced a lack of British interference beyond German-held territory. He recalled that he could fly <b>around</b> <b>as</b> if it was peace time, since all British jamming and interference stopped immediately once he was in Allied airspace.|$|E

5|$|As with {{previous}} Megami Tensei games, demons {{are central to}} combat. They are acquired by the player through real-time negotiation: upon contacting a demon, they must successfully negotiate a conversation with them which can entail either friendly persuasion or intimidation of a demon. Once a demon is allied with the player, they aid them in combat: only one demon can be summoned at any one time, and when summoned that demon follows the player <b>around</b> <b>as</b> they navigate environments. Each time a demon is summoned, it costs {{a certain amount of}} magnetite, an in-game currency. Several demons can be held by them on the go, while further demons can be stored in Shinjuku Babel. Demons and the player gain experience levels separately: when the avatar has gained a level, they can assign stat points to various attributes. These in turn effect their abilities in battle and further skill development. Two different demons can be fused into a new demon in a location known as the Cathedral of Shadows: upon fusion, the new demon can inherit different skills from its demon parents. The skills a demon possesses can be altered or enhanced depending on their use in battles.|$|E
5|$|Link, {{who is the}} {{apprentice}} of a blacksmith, goes to deliver a sword to a captain at Hyrule Castle, only to encounter a mysterious figure named Yuga, who transforms a descendant of a Sage, Seres, into a painting. After being knocked out during the fight, Link is found by a merchant named Ravio, who gives him a bracelet in exchange for being allowed to stay in his home, and tells him to report {{what had happened to}} Princess Zelda. After going to Hyrule Castle, Zelda gives Link the Pendant of Courage and instructs him to seek out the pendants of Power and Wisdom in order to gain the power of the Master Sword. Along the way, Link encounters Yuga again and is turned into a painting himself. However, thanks to Ravio's bracelet, Link is protected from Yuga's spell and gains the ability to merge with walls and move <b>around</b> <b>as</b> a painting. After finding the other pendants and obtaining the Master Sword, Link returns to Hyrule Castle where he witnesses Yuga transform Zelda into a painting. Link pursues Yuga through a dimensional crack, arriving in the twisted decaying kingdom of Lorule. There, Yuga uses Zelda and the descendants of the Seven Sages, who he had all trapped inside paintings, to revive Ganon and fuse with him, obtaining the Triforce of Power in the process. Just then, Link is assisted by Princess Hilda, the ruler of Lorule, who traps Yuga in magic bonds.|$|E
5|$|Schnaufer's {{greatest}} one-night {{success and}} {{the second time he}} became an ace-in-a-day was on 21 February 1945, when he claimed nine Lancaster heavy bombers in the course of one day. Two were claimed {{in the early hours of}} the morning and a further seven, in just 19 minutes, in the evening between 20:44 and 21:03. Schnaufer was one of the influential figures that instigated a brief return to mass intruder operations over England named Operation Gisela. General der Nachtjagd (General of Night Fighters), was Generalleutnant Schmid, commanding I. Jagdkorps and Kammhuber, commanding XII. Fliegerkorps, and de facto command-in-chief of the German Night Fighter Force until November 1943, had long since desired to return to intruder operations over Bomber Command bases in England. The proposals met resistance from Hans-Jürgen Stumpff, Chief of the General Staff. Eventually, in October 1944, Schmid won support from Streib, Inspekteur der Nachtjagd, to begin planning an operation. Schnaufer voiced his support also. In his experience, he had regularly pursued RAF bombers to the English coast, or least the other side of the frontline. In British airspace, and over territory the Germans did not control, he experienced a lack of radar interference. Schnaufer recalled that he could fly <b>around</b> <b>as</b> if it was peace time, since all British jamming and interference stopped immediately once he was in Allied airspace.|$|E

5|$|The next day, Peggy visits Stacey in {{hospital}} and asks her {{to confess to}} burning the pub, as a sentence for arson would be less than one for murder, but Stacey refuses. Peggy realises that Stacey needs to look after her daughter so she leaves. Ryan confronts Stacey at the hospital, shocked with her confession, refuses to acknowledge his daughter, and goes on his honeymoon with Janine. Peggy goes into the pub and looks <b>around</b> <b>as</b> she remembers events from her time there. She then tells Billy she wants to take Phil away to make a fresh start and to protect him. Her niece Ronnie (Samantha Womack) tells Peggy she is five months pregnant and asks Peggy not to leave as she is like a mother to her. Peggy tells Ronnie to give her real mother, Glenda (Glynis Barber), another chance. Peggy's daughter Sam (Danniella Westbrook) does not want her to leave as Peggy promised to look after Sam's baby Richard for her, however, Peggy says she is old now and the baby needs a strong mother. Peggy gives her jewellery to Sam to sell so she has some money. Peggy speaks to Phil, accepting responsibility for making him {{the way he is}} and offering to help him get off the drugs. He says she needs him more than he needs her and that she suffocates him. Realising that he is right, Peggy asks the rest of her family to look after him, saying emotional goodbyes. Though Phil claims not to have meant what he said, Peggy says she has to leave for his sake. As she leaves the house, Phil begins to follow her, but she sends him back inside. She looks at the pub and walks out of Walford.|$|E
5|$|Typically, ice traders hired {{vessels to}} ship ice as freight, {{although}} Frederic Tudor initially purchased his own vessel and the Tudor Company later bought three fast cargo ships {{of its own}} in 1877. Ice was first transported in ships {{at the end of}} the 18th century, when it was occasionally used as ballast. Shipping ice as ballast, however, required it to be cleanly cut in order to avoid it shifting <b>around</b> <b>as</b> it melted, which was not easily done until Wyeth's invention of the ice-cutter in 1825. The uniform blocks that Wyeth's process produced also made it possible to pack more ice into the limited space of a ship's hold, and significantly reduced the losses from melting. The ice was typically packed up tightly with sawdust, and the hold was then closed to prevent warmer air entering; other forms of protective dunnage used to protect ice included hay and pine tree cuttings. This requirement for large quantities of sawdust coincided with the growth in the New England lumber industry in the 1830s; sawdust had no other use at the time, and was in fact considered something of a problem, so its use in the ice trade proved very useful to the local timber industry.|$|E
5|$|Zeta Coronae Borealis is {{a double}} star with two blue-white {{components}} 6.3arcseconds apart that can be readily separated at 100xmagnification. The primary is of magnitude5.1 and the secondary is of magnitude6.0. Nu Coronae Borealis is an optical double, whose components are a similar distance from Earth but have different radial velocities, hence {{are assumed to be}} unrelated. The primary, Nu1 Coronae Borealis, is a red giant of spectral type M2III and magnitude 5.2, lying 640±30 light-years distant, and the secondary, Nu2 Coronae Borealis, is an orange-hued giant star of spectral type K5III and magnitude 5.4, estimated to be 590±30light-years away. Sigma Coronae Borealis, on the other hand, is a true multiple star system divisible by small amateur telescopes. It is actually a complex system composed of two stars <b>around</b> <b>as</b> massive as the Sun that orbit each other every 1.14days, orbited by a third Sun-like star every 726years. The fourth and fifth components are a binary red dwarf system that is 14,000AU distant from the other three stars. ADS 9731 is an even rarer multiple system in the constellation, composed of six stars, two of which are spectroscopic binaries.|$|E
