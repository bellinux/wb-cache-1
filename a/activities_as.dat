40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the level of {{physical}} activity in adults with cerebral palsy (CP) and to analyse its relationship with physical <b>activity</b> <b>as</b> adolescents, pain, and gross motor function. A prospective cohort study was performed using data from the Swedish National CP Registry (CPUP) for all 129 individuals born in 1991 – 1993 living in Skåne and Blekinge who reported to CPUP at 14 – 16 years of age. Physical <b>activity</b> <b>as</b> adult was analysed relative to physical <b>activity</b> <b>as</b> adolescents, pain, and the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS). Seventy-one individuals at GMFCS I–V were followed up as adults and included in the analyses. Of these, 65 % were physically active, but only 56 % performed physical activity at least once a week. Their physical <b>activity</b> <b>as</b> adults differed relative to their physical <b>activity</b> <b>as</b> adolescents (p= 0. 011) but not to pain or GMFCS. Being physically active as an adolescent doubled the probability of being active as an adult (OR 2. 1; p= 0. 054), indicating that physical activity in adults with CP is related to their physical <b>activity</b> <b>as</b> adolescents. Therefore, interventions to increase physical activity among adolescents with CP are likely also to improve physical activity in adulthood...|$|R
40|$|Cellulolytic and ligninolytic {{activity}} in fifteen marine fungi was assessed. All displayed endoglucanase and cellobiohydrolase {{activity in}}dicated by utilisation of carboxymethylcellulose and crystalline cellulose respectively. Variations in salinity {{appeared to have}} {{little effect on the}} extent of cellulolysis. Ligninolytic enzyme <b>activity</b> <b>as</b> indicated by dye decolorization was observed for several isolates, with intensity of reaction varying with respect to primary carbon source, pH and salinity.

5|$|Whatever his upbringing, Bregowine was consecrated as {{archbishop}} on 27September761. His election {{took place}} in a brief period when Kent was free of Mercian dominance between 756 and 764, so the story that he owed his election to Æthelbert does fit with the time frame. He wrote letters to Archbishop Lul of Mainz which still exist, and which discuss an earlier meeting between the two men. Other <b>activities</b> <b>as</b> archbishop are recorded in surviving charters. One records that he protested at the loss of a church at Cookham that was confiscated by King Cynewulf of Wessex sometime after 760. Another surviving charter from Dunwald, a thegn of King Æthelbert, concerning land in Canterbury, records that Bregowine consented to the gift of land. Unfortunately, many of the early charters of the diocese of Canterbury are lost, which restricts knowledge of Bregowine's <b>activities</b> <b>as</b> archbishop.|$|E

5|$|As {{outlined}} in the 3,500-word Nichols letter, the hearing focused on 24 allegations, 23 of which dealt with Oppenheimer's Communist and left-wing affiliations between 1938 and 1946, including his delayed and false reporting of the Chevalier incident to authorities. The twenty-fourth charge related to {{his opposition to the}} hydrogen bomb. By including the hydrogen bomb, the AEC changed the character of the hearing, by opening up an inquiry into his <b>activities</b> <b>as</b> a postwar government adviser.|$|E
5|$|Bregowine (died August 764) was {{a medieval}} Archbishop of Canterbury. Little {{is known of}} his origins or his <b>activities</b> <b>as</b> archbishop, {{although}} a number of stories were told about his possible origins after the Norman conquest in 1066. There are no records of him prior to his becoming archbishop. He possibly owed his elevation to the Kentish monarch. The records after his elevation to Canterbury are mainly about disputes over land, but knowledge {{of his time in}} office is hampered by the destruction of many of the contemporary records. After his death, he was considered a saint and a life about him was written in the 12thcentury.|$|E

5|$|In the 16th century, the {{fishermen}} {{started to work}} in maritime <b>activities,</b> <b>as</b> pilots or seafarers in {{the crew of the}} Portuguese ships, due to their high nautical knowledge. The fishermen of the region are known to fish in Newfoundland since, at least, 1506. During the reign of John III the Povoan shipmaking art was already renowned, and Povoan carpenters were sought after by Lisbon's Ribeira das Naus shipyard due to their high technical skills. The single floored houses dominated the town's landscape, but there are indications of multiple floored habitations with rich architecture. The seafarers' social class, well-off gentlemen, was associated with this richer architecture around Praça Velha square.|$|E
