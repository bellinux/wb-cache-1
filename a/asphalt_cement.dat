25|$|The largest use {{of asphalt}} is for making asphalt {{concrete}} for road surfaces; this accounts for approximately 85% of the asphalt {{consumed in the}} United States. Asphalt concrete pavement mixes are typically composed of 5% <b>asphalt</b> <b>cement</b> and 95% aggregates (stone, sand, and gravel). Due to its highly viscous nature, <b>asphalt</b> <b>cement</b> must be heated {{so it can be}} mixed with the aggregates at the asphalt mixing facility. The temperature required varies depending upon characteristics of the asphalt and the aggregates, but warm-mix asphalt technologies allow producers to reduce the temperature required. There are about 4,000 asphalt concrete mixing plants in the US, and a similar number in Europe.|$|E

This research was aimed at determining the effects of additives on the aging of <b>asphalt</b> <b>cements</b> and rejuvenated <b>asphalt</b> <b>cements.</b> This was accomplished by performing two experiments. The first experiment was {{to determine the effects of}} various amounts of quick lime (CaO) and hydrated lime (Ca(OH),) on SHRP AAA-I and SHRP AAF- 1. The second experiment was to determine the effects of three different amines and various amounts of CaO on aged SHRP AAA-I and SHRP AAF-I rejuvenated with ABM-F 2, YBF-F 2, and AAF-F 3. The experiments were designed and performed to study the oxidation rates, the hardening rates, the hardening susceptibilities, and if possible, the prediction of the critical times for pavement failure due to the hardening of the <b>asphalt</b> <b>cements.</b> The results from the first experiment showed that Ca(OH), was a better lime additive than CaO. CaO accelerated the oxidation rates although it improved the hardening susceptibilities. Ca(OH) 2 improved the hardening susceptibilities as well but also slowed the oxidation rates. 4 -(3 -Phenylpropyl) -Pyridine and N-Phenyl- 1 -Naphthylamine from the second experiment increased the oxidation rates, dropped the initial viscosities, and decreased the critical times while the 2 -Aminophenol improved the oxidation rates, had only a slight drop in initial viscosities, and greatly increased the critical times. Except for the health hazards, the 2 -Aminophenol would be considered a good additive if it were determined to be cost effective. The second experiment also showed that CaO at the higher concentrations always improved the hardening susceptibilities of the rejuvenated asphalts and increased the critical times.

40|$|This is a {{continuation}} of a project initiated a year ago to determine any differences in test results on recovered <b>asphalt</b> <b>cements</b> caused by the use of industrial grade of solvent as compared with the reagent grade. AASHTO specifies the use of reagent grade of trichlorethylene, but the Laboratory uses industrial grade which costs much less. Last year this objective of the project was aborted when it was found that a larger difference in test results was obtained between the two distillation apparatuses than between the two solvents, Then all efforts were directed toward obtaining uniformity in test results between the apparatuses under the east hood as compared with that under the west hood. Considerable progress was made toward this end. (See report under this same title dated April 1982). The objective this year was to again evaluate the results when using both variables (apparatuses and solvents). Another objective developed later in this investigation; this was to determine any differences in test results on recovered <b>asphalt</b> <b>cements</b> caused by the use of reclaimed trichlorethylene (from the distillation process) as compared with the use of industrial grade of solvent.

40|$|This {{study focused}} on the key factors {{affecting}} the tensile strength of cold recycled <b>asphalt</b> mixture with <b>cement</b> and emulsified <b>asphalt.</b> The specific surface areas and strength of RAP were analyzed. The interaction between the emulsified <b>asphalt</b> and <b>cement</b> was observed. Comprehensive laboratory testing was conducted to evaluate the influences of RAP, emulsified <b>asphalt,</b> and <b>cement</b> on the tensile strength of cold recycled asphalt mixture. It is found that although RAP is used as aggregates, its inner structure and strength are much different from real aggregates. The strength of RAP has decisive effect {{on the strength of}} cold recycled asphalt mixture. New aggregates and fine gradation design can help improve the bonding between RAP and binder. For emulsified asphalt, slow setting of asphalt can give sufficient time for cement to hydrate which is helpful for strength formation in the cold recycled asphalt mixture. The high viscosity of asphalt can improve the early strength of cold recycled asphalt mixture that is important for traffic opening in the field. Cement is an efficient additive to improve the strength of cold recycled asphalt mixtures by promoting demulsification of emulsified <b>asphalt</b> and producing <b>cement</b> hydrates.

In this research, the viability of using crushed waste <b>asphalt</b> and <b>cement</b> concrete as a replacement of primary aggregate in unbound base layer of flexible pavements has been investigated.
