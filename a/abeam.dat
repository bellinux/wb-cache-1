5|$|By March, Clarke's {{deception}} operations {{had grown}} {{and it was}} decided to create a formal department. He chose the name Advanced Headquarters 'A' Force - the 'A' being a subtle reference to airborne - in the hope that it would help support the existence of paratroopers in the area (as well as hide the true purpose of the department). Clarke continued actively promoting the existence of 1st SAS until around June 1941, and it appears that Axis commanders accepted the brigade as real. Clarke had created the unit with no specific aims, although it did mean that the enemy command had to factor the existence of airborne troops into any battle plan. However, <b>Abeam</b> and the 1st SAS represented his first attempt at inflating the apparent strength of Allied forces, a tactic he would use significantly over the rest of the war. The brigade occasionally featured in Clarke's tactical deceptions; such as a March 1941 threat to Axis supply lines near Tripoli.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} <b>abeam</b> {{replenishment}} at sea (RAS) stations for diesel oil, aviation fuel and fresh water. The flight deck and helicopter hangar allow vertical replenishment at sea. The flight deck {{is large and}} strong enough for a Chinook helicopter to land on. Propulsion uses medium-speed diesel engines driving twin shafts in a hybrid CODELOD (Combined Diesel Electric or Diesel) arrangement designed for fuel efficiency across {{a wide range of}} speeds.|$|E
25|$|On 2 February 2016, 20 {{minutes after}} {{taking off from}} Mogadishu, Somalia, at 11:00 local time, en route to Djibouti City, at an {{altitude}} of about , an explosion occurred aboard the aircraft, opening a hole in the fuselage behind the R2 door. It was reported that day that the explosion was most likely close to seats15/16F, <b>abeam</b> the forward wing root and the fuel tanks.

25|$|She shipped four BL 4.7 in (120-mm) Mk.I guns on CP VI {{mountings}} in four single centre-line turrets. The turrets were disposed as two {{forward and}} two aft in super imposed firing positions. She also carried two QF 2 pounder Mk.II (40 mm L/39) ("Pom poms") mounted <b>abeam</b> between funnels and five Light machine guns (4 were Lewis guns and 1 was a Maxim). Abaft of the 2nd funnel, she carried six 21-inch Torpedo Tubes in two triple mountings on the centre-line.|$|E
25|$|She {{was laid}} down on 5 May 1904 at the J Samuel White {{shipyard}} at Cowes and launched on 7 March 1905. She {{was completed in}} October 1905. Her original armament {{was to be the}} same as the Turleback torpedo boat destroyers that preceded her. In 1906, the Admiralty decided to upgrade the armament by landing the five 6-pounder naval guns and shipping three 12-pounder 8 hundredweight (cwt) guns. Two would be mounted <b>abeam</b> at the foc'x'le break and the third gun would be mounted on the quarterdeck.|$|E
25|$|She {{was ordered}} under the 1903 – 1904 Naval Estimates, laid down on 22 March 1904, at Cammell Laird's {{shipyard}} at Birkenhead and launched on 10 November 1904.

25|$|HNoMS Maud {{was ordered}} on 28 June 2013 to replace HNoMS Tyr and HNoMS Valkyrien {{at a cost}} of NOK1,320m (~£140m} with 100% offsets. She is based on the AEGIR-18R design. but {{includes}} a 48-bed hospital underneath the flight deck with an operating theatre, isolation ward and CT scanner. She can carry 7000 tonnes of F76 fuel oil, 300 tonnes of F44/JP-5 jet fuel, 200 tonnes of ammunition and 40 ISO containers or a mix of vehicles and boats. She has two <b>abeam</b> RAS rigs and a stern reel, and a 25-tonne deck crane. A side ramp allows easy access for vehicles and for the support of submarines and other small vessels. The flight deck can accommodate helicopters up to CH-53 Super Stallion size, and the hangar can operate one NH90 with level 2 maintenance or stow a second. The core crew will be 40-50, with accommodation for 100 more if needed; facilities include a gym and sauna. Four Sea PROTECTOR remote weapon stations are planned.|$|E
