The US Environment Protection Agency (USEPA) has listed turbidity and sediment as major pollutants <b>for</b> <b>construction</b> <b>site</b> effluent.

40|$|Various {{agencies}} {{have discussed the}} possibility of using turbidity as an effluent standard <b>for</b> <b>construction</b> <b>site.</b> Turbidity monitoring can be difficult <b>for</b> dynamic <b>construction</b> <b>sites.</b> This project investigated turbidity relationships for conditions of Minnesota and developed protocols for the design and installation of cost-effective monitoring systems. Turbidity characteristics of fourteen different soils in Minnesota were investigated using the laboratory protocols. Trends in turbidity with sediment concentrations were well represented by power functions. The exponent of these power functions was relatively constant between soils and the log-intercept, or scaling parameter varied substantially among the different soils. A regression analysis for the scaling parameter was a function of percent silt, interrill erodibility, and maximum abstraction. A power value of 7 / 5 was chosen to represent all soils. The field studies were also used to develop turbidity monitoring systems that would be adaptable to <b>construction</b> <b>sites</b> and to collect turbidity data on <b>construction</b> <b>site</b> runoff. <b>Construction</b> <b>site</b> turbidities often exceeded 1000 NTUs and sometimes surpassed 3000 NTUs.

40|$|This {{report is}} an {{evaluation}} of Peab's purchase and call-off system, PIA. PIA is used to order goods <b>for</b> Peab's <b>construction</b> <b>sites.</b> The background to the work is that users of the system have understood the system cumbersome to use when purchasing goods <b>for</b> <b>construction</b> <b>sites.</b> The evaluation {{was carried out by}} the interviews and tests with users of the program, in this case, supervisors and site managers at the company. Ten users of the system were interviewed and eleven people have carried out a test order. The focus is primarily on the test order that users have implemented, which has been clocked and analyzed for time and cost. The evaluation is also a user analysis concerning how the users perceive the program, mainly in terms of usability, functionality and benefits. The result of this report shows that PIA is economically profitable to use for the purchase of goods <b>for</b> <b>construction</b> <b>sites.</b> It shows also that in the majority of cases take more time to place an order through PIA than by phone, but despite this, it is economically profitable to use the system. The result of the user analysis shows that the system performs what it is proposed to, despite some criticism from users. It also shows that the system is user friendly for those who have fairly good computer skills, and states that PIA brings the benefit that it is intended to do, i. e. creating economic profit to the company...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{examining}} {{the relationships between the}} effectiveness of safety intervention programmes and implementation strategies in the Nigeria construction industry. Structured questionnaires were distributed to construction stakeholders across some selected states in Nigeria and the data generated were analysed using Pearson’s product moment correlation. The study found that the effectiveness of safety intervention programmes <b>for</b> <b>construction</b> <b>site</b> accidents prevention is significantly related to the communication implementation strategies. Based on the principles of social ecological theory and UNICEF’s communication for development strategies, this study developed a multilevel safety intervention implementation strategy <b>for</b> <b>construction</b> industries in Nigeria. Four communication strategies, namely, advocacy, social mobilisation, social change communication, and behaviour change communication, which are central to the effectiveness of safety intervention implementation programmes <b>for</b> <b>construction</b> <b>site</b> accidents prevention, were identified. It further revealed that these communication strategies could be individually and collectively applied at different intervention levels but that the greatest effect would be felt when all strategies are systematically combined with more efficient use of resources. The study recommended systematic actions by policy makers, construction organisations, and various community groups towards construction safety interventions, since maximum effect could only be felt when safety interventions are implemented across all levels...|$|R

40|$|Quality {{has been}} {{considered}} one of the most important and competitive factors amongst the constructing companies during the past two decades. Reviewing literature pertinent to quality management concepts and its application in construction industry has formulated the definition of "Quality Management " as meeting the owner's requirements or compliance with the set standards and specifications. This definition can be realized through the application of quality management concepts which are represented by "Total Quality Management " TQM as a higher management level which has been achieved by quality management works. It has become clear that the responsibility of achieving applications of quality management concepts shall be borne by the construction management and its personnel. In turn, such management can be attained by a specialized management field named "Quality Management". The researchers have recommended a proposed Quality Management System <b>for</b> <b>Construction</b> <b>Site</b> aiming: firstly to raise the quality level of works in construction projects, and secondly to improve the construction staff consciousness, in different managerial levels, about quality management concepts and its importance for improving the quality of construction works.
