25|$|Early {{the next}} morning, Bullitt drives home. As {{he walks up}} to his apartment, he spots Cathy's car. He looks in and sees her {{sleeping}} in his bedroom, {{but he does not}} wake her. He takes off his gun and balances it on a banister. As he begins to wash up at the bathroom sink, he looks up into his own reflection and contemplates himself for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|E
500|$|Kimberly Roots, {{writing for}} TV Line, {{responded to the}} kiss scene by stating, [...] "What got me – and still gets me – about this kiss is how much fire it has. This isn’t a drunken, {{convenient}} hook-up. This isn’t a let’s-see-how-this-goes peck. This is two people acting on years of something unacknowledged between them. We get <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment</b> of LoVe in action before they break apart and realize what just happened." [...] Entertainment Weekly called [...] "Weapons of Class Destruction" [...] one of the [...] "10 essential episodes of Veronica Mars".|$|E
500|$|When {{the tenth}} inning ended, giving Hershiser the record, he [...] "stood bent {{with his hands}} on his knees for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment</b> after the final out and then was {{inundated}} by teammates pouring out of the dugout to congratulate him." [...] Drysdale served as the Dodger radio broadcast announcer with Vin Scully that year. As Hershiser left the mound with the record in hand, he was searching for Drysdale and saying [...] "Where is Drysdale? I've got to find Drysdale". Drysdale was on hand to congratulate Hershiser after the game. In fact, when Hershiser returned to the dugout, Drysdale was waiting with his microphone for an interview.|$|E
60|$|He {{glanced at}} her swiftly. Their eyes met. Fearlessly she held his fingers for <b>a</b> moment,--a <b>long,</b> {{wonderful}} <b>moment.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh keep me, keep me!" [...] {{he pleaded}} while her face still hung over him: in {{response}} to which it dropped again and stayed close, clingingly close. It was the seal of their situation--of which he tasted the impress for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> blissful <b>moment</b> in silence. But he came back. [...] "Yet how did you know--?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite true, my dear, {{and came}} near being Americans ourselves. Had my father {{established}} himself where he married, {{as had been}} his first intention, such would have been our national character. But, Mons. Le Compte {{has given us a}} moment to tell our stories to each other, and I think it will not be <b>a</b> very <b>long</b> <b>moment.</b> Let one of us commence, if we wish the offices done without unpleasant listeners." ...|$|R
2500|$|Wray {{was also}} a member {{of one of the most}} famous B-movie units at work during what is now viewed as the 'Golden Age' of Hollywood -- a group whose {{creative}} energy and inventiveness made Lewton's success possible. She spoke about working with the group in a conversation with her daughter many years later, a recollection that shines a clear light on the group's chemistry and skill, and the special place it held in Wray's heart:She rarely spoke about her early career or the McCarthy era. [...] But when I asked once what it was like working with Lewton, she smiled -- thought about it for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment</b> -- and then told me about the night the group spent figuring out how to build to the first murder in The Leopard Man. [...] The scene she had written was pure psychological terror, trading on very basic fears -- of the dark, of being punished unjustly, locked out of your own home, abandoned by people you trust -- and at the same time it sets up the mystery that is the premise of the entire film. [...] They were under pressure to get this sequence right, and almost everyone was there that night. The session went well into the small hours of the morning, was filled with laughter, and included a hilarious riff as one of them experimented with a set of castanets, which turned out to be the key to building the tension and suspense. They worked their way through a dozen different shot sequences before they were satisfied and, listening to her, I had the very strong impression that they would have come up with that same elegant, powerful scene even if they had been working with an A-movie budget and had more time. [...] As Agee so famously observed about Lewton, these were people who understood film and cared about human beings. [...] I can still see the smile on her face as she recalled that night. [...] -- Stefani Warren, September 2016 ...|$|E
60|$|The Cardinal {{continued}} to ponder him for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment</b> very searchingly.|$|E
60|$|For <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment</b> none spoke. Then Kulan Tith {{cleared his}} throat.|$|E
50|$|He {{walks towards}} the bathroom, past the {{flickering}} fluorescent tube, and stops. In a close up, Ashcroft stares slightly downward {{into a corner}} of the room for <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> silent <b>moment.</b> The silence is broken by the sound of Ashcroft urinating into an off-camera toilet. Immediately, ironically, as if to dismiss the prior foreboding, the song resumes of its own accord, loudly and triumphantly as Ashcroft continues to pass water.|$|R
60|$|Presently a black-maned male {{raised his}} head, and, with cocked ears and glaring eyes, gazed {{straight}} at the bush behind which we lay. I could have sworn that he had discovered us, and {{when he took a}} few short and stately steps in our direction I raised my rifle and covered him. But, after <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> tense <b>moment</b> he looked away, and turned to glare in another direction.|$|R
50|$|In August 1915 he {{commissioned}} the submarine HMS E19, {{the following month}} he forced a passage into the Baltic Sea to support the Russian Baltic Fleet, preying on iron ore transports from Sweden to the German Empire, where for <b>a</b> week <b>long</b> <b>moment</b> he had succeeded in entirely suspending German maritime traffic in the area. During his service in the Baltic, he torpedoed a German destroyer and on 7 November 1915 sank the German cruiser SMS Undine, as well as sinking or capturing 10 German steamships.|$|R
60|$|The girl {{stood looking}} at him for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment</b> before she spoke.|$|E
60|$|He {{stared at}} me for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment,</b> {{speechless}} in his utter amazement. Then he swallowed hard.|$|E
60|$|For <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment</b> each {{looked into}} the other's eyes with a {{singular}} intentness that nothing here would seem to warrant.|$|E
6000|$|He made a queer, whining sound, {{covering}} his face. And the beggar's tag: [...] "'Ave a feelin' 'eart, gentleman--'ave a feelin' 'eart!" [...] passed idiotically through Gyp's mind. Would he {{get up and}} strangle her? Should she dash to the door--escape? For <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> miserable <b>moment,</b> she watched him swaying on the window-seat, with his face covered. Then, without looking at her, he crammed a clenched hand up against his mouth, and rushed out.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the episode}} [...] "Night Out," [...] {{he puts his}} hand on Pam's leg and caresses it for <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> awkward <b>moment,</b> which {{everyone}} standing around seems to notice, making this the first time the employees see Toby's possible crush on Pam. Immediately thereafter, realizing what he had just done, he abruptly announces that he is moving to Costa Rica, runs outside to the security fence, scales it, and disappears into the night. This scene was done by a stunt double, as Lieberstein wanted to do it himself but it was decided for insurance reasons to let the stuntman do his work.|$|R
60|$|He {{held out}} his hand, and she gave him hers <b>a</b> moment--a <b>moment</b> <b>long</b> {{enough for him to}} bend his {{handsome}} bared head and kiss it. Then, still agitating, in his mastered emotion, his implement of the chase, he walked rapidly away. He was evidently much upset.|$|R
60|$|For <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment,</b> in {{speechless}} horror, {{both women}} stared at him, until, perceiving them, blankest surprise invaded his stern face.|$|E
60|$|They {{looked into}} each other's eyes for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment.</b> And then, hand in hand, they walked {{slowly into the}} palace.|$|E
60|$|She stopped again, {{clenching}} and unclenching her fingers, as if {{she were}} strangling some living thing. There was silence for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment.</b>|$|E
60|$|Once {{more she}} leaned towards me. The {{wind was blowing}} around us, she came closer as though seeking for the shelter of my body. I could smell the crushed violets, which she was still wearing at her bosom; her eyes were soft and bright, her lips were {{slightly}} parted. I took her into my arms--she clung to me for <b>a</b> moment--one <b>long,</b> delicious <b>moment.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Brian Wilson {{recalls that}} [...] "the {{five of us}} arrived at the Morgans' Melrose Avenue office." [...] The group sang a cover version of [...] "Sloop John B", though Hite Morgan's {{response}} was [...] "these days you need something original. You've gotta have an angle. The music business is all about selling a product." [...] Brian remembers that [...] "there was <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> awkward <b>moment</b> of silence that caught us looking at our shoelaces." [...] Dennis Wilson then surprised the other group members by responding, [...] "Yeah, we got an original. It's called 'Surfin'." [...] Hite Morgan then asked them to play the song but as Brian recalls he responded, [...] "Well, it's not finished. We've got the song, and it's original. But it's not done yet." ...|$|R
60|$|Hodder, {{in spite}} of a {{pressing}} invitation to remain for supper, had left them together. He turned his face westward, in the opposite direction from the parish house, still under the spell of that moment of communion which had lasted--he knew not how <b>long,</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of silent revelation to them both. She, too, was storm-tossed! She, too, who had fared forth so gallantly into life, had conquered only to be beaten down--to lose her way.|$|R
60|$|The park seemed full of shrill, {{piercing}} strife. It swelled, {{reached a}} highest pitch, sustained that for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment,</b> and then declined.|$|E
60|$|Lionel {{looked at}} him for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment</b> in silence, sitting up a little. Then he sank back again slowly against Sir John's breast.|$|E
60|$|But he did {{not speak}} a word. He {{remained}} motionless for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment,</b> his eyes pale and steady, his right hand like a claw.|$|E
60|$|A low-spoken {{word from}} Ladd {{recalled}} Gale {{to the question}} of surroundings and of possible dangers. Ladd had halted a few yards ahead. They had reached the summit of what was evidently a high ridge which sloped with much greater steepness on the far side. It was only after a few more forward steps, however, that Dick could see down the slope. Then full in view flashed a bright campfire around which clustered a group of dark figures. They were encamped in a wide arroyo, where horses could be seen grazing in black patches of grass between clusters of trees. A second look at the campers told Gale they were Mexicans. At this moment Lash came forward to join Ladd, and the two spent <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> uninterrupted <b>moment</b> studying the arroyo. A hoarse laugh, faint yet distinct, floated up on the cool wind.|$|R
5000|$|During the [...] "Last Days" [...] {{part of the}} Secret Wars storyline, Spectrum devises a plan {{to destroy}} Earth-1610 {{to keep it from}} colliding with Earth-616. In desperation during the two weeks {{before the end of the}} world, Spectrum {{channels}} her full power and goes to destroy Earth-1610. However, right before she successfully destroys the other Earth, she spots a group of children who live there, causing her to hesitate for only <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>long</b> enough for Ultimate Reed Richards to capture her.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{the glorious}} {{creature}} righted herself, and rose again, {{as if in}} noble shame, for one last struggle with her doom. Her bows were deep in the water, but her after-deck still dry. Righted: but only for <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>long</b> enough to let her crew come pouring wildly up on deck, with cries and prayers, and rush aft to the poop, where, under the flag of Spain, stood the tall captain, his left hand on the standard-staff, his sword pointed in his right.|$|R
60|$|Sully {{stared at}} his master for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment,</b> in stupefied silence, his loyal Huguenot soul refusing to {{discount}} by flattery the truth that he perceived.|$|E
6000|$|... "Lend me that glass," [...] demanded Guy, forcefully. He {{surveyed}} {{the band of}} men for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment,</b> then he handed the glass back to Jean.|$|E
6000|$|Verrian rose awkwardly {{and stood}} <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>moment</b> before his chair. Then he dropped back again, saying, dryly, [...] "I don't think I {{want to ask}} it anything." ...|$|E
60|$|The doe {{had hung}} {{back a little}} as Dale reached the camp-fire. It was a gray, slender creature, smooth as silk, with great dark eyes. It stood <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>long</b> ears erect, {{and then with a}} graceful little trot came up to Bo and reached a slim nose for her outstretched hand. All about it, except the {{beautiful}} soft eyes, seemed wild, and yet it was as tame as a kitten. Then, suddenly, as Bo fondled the long ears, it gave a start and, breaking away, ran back out of sight under the pines.|$|R
60|$|The strange ship, {{a darker}} {{shape in the}} night, {{did not seem to}} be moving onwards but only to grow more {{distinct}} right abeam, staring at the Ferndale with one green and one red eye which swayed and tossed as if they belonged to the restless head of some invisible monster ambushed in the night amongst the waves. <b>A</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>long</b> like eternity, elapsed, and, suddenly, the monster which seemed to take to itself the shape of a mountain shut its green eye without as much as a preparatory wink.|$|R
60|$|Then it {{was that}} White Fang struck. He gave no warning, with no snarl {{anticipated}} his own action. Into the air he lifted his body in the spring that landed him on the strange god's back. White Fang clung with his fore-paws to the man's shoulders, {{at the same time}} burying his fangs {{into the back of the}} man's neck. He clung on for <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>long</b> enough to drag the god over backward. Together they crashed to the floor. White Fang leaped clear, and, as the man struggled to rise, was in again with the slashing fangs.|$|R
