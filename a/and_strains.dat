5|$|People with OCD report activity-related {{pain that}} {{develops}} gradually. Individual complaints usually consist of mechanical symptoms including pain, swelling, catching, locking, popping noises, and buckling / giving way; the primary presenting symptom {{may be a}} restriction {{in the range of}} movement. Symptoms typically present within the initial weeks of stageI; however, the onset of stageII occurs within months and offers little time for diagnosis. The disease progresses rapidly beyond stageII, as OCD lesions quickly move from stable cysts or fissures to unstable fragments. Non-specific symptoms, caused by similar injuries such as sprains <b>and</b> <b>strains,</b> can delay a definitive diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Phillip Manning {{and colleagues}} (2009) {{attempted}} {{to test the}} function of the sickle claw and similarly shaped claws on the forelimbs. They analyzed the bio-mechanics of how stresses <b>and</b> <b>strains</b> would be distributed along the claws and into the limbs, using X-ray imaging to create a three-dimensional contour map of a forelimb claw from Velociraptor. For comparison, they analyzed the construction of a claw from a modern predatory bird, the eagle owl. They found that, based on the way that stress was conducted along the claw, they were ideal for climbing. The scientists found that the sharpened tip of the claw was a puncturing and gripping instrument, while the curved and expanded claw base helped transfer stress loads evenly.|$|E
5|$|The large {{figure of}} Jonah {{is of great}} {{significance}} to the total composition, both pictorially and theologically, being symbolic of the Risen Christ.

40|$|Myocardial strain is {{a measure}} of tissue {{deformation}} <b>and</b> <b>strain</b> rate is the rate at which deformation occurs. When applied to the heart, <b>strain</b> <b>and</b> <b>strain</b> rate give fundamental information on myocardial properties and mechanics that would otherwise be unavailable. Site specificity and angle independency are two unique characteristics of <b>strain</b> <b>and</b> <b>strain</b> rate data. <b>Strain</b> <b>and</b> <b>strain</b> rate can be obtained with tissue Doppler imaging or with 2 D speck tracking. These two techniques derive information on <b>strain</b> <b>and</b> <b>strain</b> rate in two fundamentally different ways and each has its own advantages and limitations. Tissue Doppler imaging yields velocity information from which <b>strain</b> <b>and</b> <b>strain</b> rate are mathematically derived whereas 2 D speckle tracking yields strain information from which <b>strain</b> rate <b>and</b> velocity data are derived. Data obtained from these two different techniques may not be equivalent due to limitations inherent with each technique. <b>Strain</b> <b>and</b> <b>strain</b> rate imaging have been used to assess myocardial function {{in a wide range of}} cardiac conditions. They are useful in detecting early left ventricular (LV) dysfunction in the setting of systemic diseases with cardiac involvement, in differentiating transmural from non-transmural infarction, and in identifying LV contractile reserve in regurgitant valve lesions. When used with dobutamine echocardiography, <b>strain</b> <b>and</b> <b>strain</b> rate imaging can identify viable myocardium and aid the detection of myocardial ischaemia. <b>Strain</b> <b>and</b> <b>strain</b> rate imaging can also be used to assess right ventricular and left atrial function. Despite significant promises, <b>strain</b> <b>and</b> <b>strain</b> rate imaging is technically challenging and signal to noise ratio may be potentially affected by a wide range of factors. As a result, <b>strain</b> <b>and</b> <b>strain</b> rate imaging have been slow to get incorporated into everyday clinical practice.

5|$|The {{preservation}} of various pure breeds <b>and</b> <b>strains,</b> including {{some that are}} rare today, was once undertaken in North America {{in large part by}} large agriculture-focused colleges and universities. However, many of these institutions have changed their focus to commercial or crossbred strains, with many herds being sent to slaughter. The Livestock Conservancy and Rare Breeds Canada intervened in some of these cases, leading to the survival and {{preservation of}} some gene stocks. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) participates in livestock preservation mainly through technology-based approaches such as gene mapping and germplasm (genetic material) storage. However, although the storage of genetic material is a useful technique in the preservation of rare breeds, it cannot preserve the entire range of genetic diversity within even an individual breed, and stored material cannot react and adapt to environmental or biological changes as live animal populations can. The US federal government rarely supports rare breed live animal population conservation, and while agricultural subsidies were once seen more than they are in present times, they were never focused on individual breeds. The Livestock Conservancy has been instrumental in preserving live populations of many rare livestock breeds in the US.|$|E
5|$|The type {{species of}} the genus Ramaria, R.botrytis was first {{described}} scientifically in 1797 by mycologist Christiaan Hendrik Persoon. A widely distributed species, it is found in North America, North Africa, central and eastern Europe, Australia, and Asia. The fungus is mycorrhizal with broadleaf trees, and fruits {{on the ground in}} wooded areas. There are several species of coral fungi that are superficially similar in appearance to R.botrytis, and although comparison of habitat or characteristics like color or branching morphology is often sufficient for identification, sometimes microscopy is required to definitively distinguish between them. Fruit bodies of Ramaria botrytis are edible, and young specimens have a mild, fruity taste. Some authors warn of laxative effects in susceptible individuals. The fungus contains several chemical compounds with in vitro biological activity, and fruit bodies have antimicrobial activity against several species <b>and</b> <b>strains</b> of drug-resistant bacteria that cause disease in humans.|$|E

40|$|Marriage {{is a key}} {{social status}} related to the {{distribution}} of later life disablement. One factor within the marital relationship thought to be consequential for disablement is social support from the spouse. Nonetheless, marriage is not inherently supportive and {{may also be a}} source of chronic strain. According to the social support/stress model spousal social support is expected to result in better functional health outcomes while spousal strain is hypothesized to produce poorer functional health in later life. Beyond spousal support <b>and</b> <b>strain,</b> marriage is also embedded in a broader web of emotionally close non-spousal ties that are also likely to serve as contexts for meaningful exchanges of support <b>and</b> <b>strain.</b> However, less is known {{about the importance of the}} contingencies between spousal and non-spousal support <b>and</b> <b>strain</b> for the disablement process. Using nationally representative data from a sample of older adults from the 2006 - 2012 waves of the Health and Retirement Study this dissertation examines the importance of spousal and non-spousal social support <b>and</b> <b>strain</b> for trajectories of functional limitations among older married men and women. Specifically, I analyzed the independent effects of social support <b>and</b> <b>strain</b> across spousal <b>and</b> non-spousal social domains, the interactive effects of domain-specific social support <b>and</b> <b>strain,</b> <b>and</b> the effects of cross-domain interactions between spousal support/strain and non-spousal support <b>and</b> <b>strain.</b> This research further considered whether the independent and interactive effects of social support <b>and</b> <b>strain</b> vary by gender. The results highlight that spousal and non-spousal support/strain are likely to have consequences for the disablement process, though the effects of social support <b>and</b> <b>strain</b> on functional limitations depend on the relationship domain in question and, in some instances, gender. Moreover, in some cases the effects of social support <b>and</b> <b>strain</b> were counterintuitive given the expectations of the social support/stress model. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this investigation is to analyze the influence of trabecular microstructure modeling on the biomechanical distribution of the implant-bone interface.

The values of equivalent stress at the implant-bone interface in the refined model increased {{compared with those of}} the simplified model <b>and</b> <b>strain</b> on the contrary. The distributions of stress <b>and</b> <b>strain</b> were more uniform in the refined model of trabecular microstructure, in which stress <b>and</b> <b>strain</b> were mainly concentrated in trabecular bone.

The relation between the stress <b>and</b> the <b>strain</b> concentration factors depends on Poisson’s ratio and the groove’s geometric configuration. The coupled influences of the shape factor of the semielliptic groove and the relative depth of the groove on the stress <b>and</b> <b>strain</b> concentrations are examined.
