40|$|Variable {{stiffness}} actuators are {{a particular}} class of actuators that {{is characterized by}} the property that the <b>apparent</b> <b>output</b> stiffness can be changed independent of the output position. To achieve this, variable stiffness actuators consist of a number of elastic elements and a number of actuated degrees of freedom, which determine how the elastic elements are perceived at the actuator output. Changing the <b>apparent</b> <b>output</b> stiffness is useful for a broad range of applications, which explains the increasing research interest in this class of actuators. In this paper, a generic, port-based model for variable stiffness actuators is presented, with which a wide variety of designs can be modeled and analyzed. From the analysis of the model, it is possible to derive kinematic properties that variable stiffness actuator designs should satisfy in order to be energy efficient. More specifically, the kinematics should be such that the <b>apparent</b> <b>output</b> stiffness can be varied without changing the potential energy that is stored in the internal elastic elements. A concept design of an energy-efficient variable stiffness actuator is presented and implemented.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new signal-conditioning technique for measuring strain and temperature which uses fewer connecting wires than conventional techniques. Simultaneous measurement of temperature and strain {{has been achieved}} by using thermocouple wire to connect strain gages to signal conditioning. This signal conditioning uses a new method for demultiplexing sampled analog signals and the Anderson current loop circuit. Theory is presented along with data to confirm that strain gage resistance change is sensed without appreciable error because of thermoelectric effects. Furthermore, temperature is sensed without appreciable error because of voltage drops caused by strain gage excitation current flowing through the gage resistance.

This work assesses related reliability issues and focuses on the second stage or inversion process in PV inverters. Three PV inverter topologies are analyzed and their reliability is determined on a component-by-component level. Limiting operating points are considered for each of these topologies. The capacitor in the dc link, the MOSFETs in the inverting bridge, and the output filter are the components affected. Studies show that varying power-factor operation with a constant real power output increases the energy storage requirement as well as the capacitance required in the dc link in order to produce the double-frequency power ripple. The overall current rating of the MOSFETs and output filter must also be sized to accommodate the current for the <b>apparent</b> power <b>output.</b> Modeling of the inverter verifies the conditions for each of the components under varying reactive power support commands.

In this work, we propose a strategy to control the variable stiffness actuator optimally, with respect to a cost criterion, to a desired periodic motion of the output. In particular, the cost criterion provides a measure of embodiment of the desired behavior in the passive behavior of the variable stiffness actuator, i. e., the variable stiffness actuator is controlled such that its passive behavior is {{as close as possible to}} the desired behavior and thus that the control effort is minimized...|$|E

This is mechanically achieved by the internal introduction {{of a number of}} elastic elements and a number of actuated degrees of freedom (DOFs), which determine how the elastic elements are sensed at the output. During the nominal behavior of these actuators, the power flow from the internal actuated DOFs can be such that energy is undesirably stored in the elastic elements because of the specific kinematic structure of the actuator. In this study, we focus on the analysis of the power flow in variable stiffness actuators. More specifically, the analysis is restricted to the kinematic structure of the actuators, in order to show the influence of the topological structure on the power flow, rather than on the realization choices. We define a measure that indicates the ratio between the total amount of power that is injected by the internal actuated DOFs and the power that is captured by the internal elastic elements which, therefore, cannot be used to do work on the load. In order to define the power-flow ratio, we exploit a generic port-based model of variable stiffness actuators, which highlights the kinematic properties of the design and the power flows in the actuator structure...|$|E

40|$|The {{productivity}} slowdown of {{the early}} 1970 s continues to puzzle economists. A frequent explanation of this puzzle is that mismeasurement of output has worsened enough to help account for the <b>apparent</b> shortfall of <b>output</b> growth. Griliches (1994) highlighted one channel through which this worsening measurement could occur. He raised the possibility that—because output growth {{in the service sector}} likely is undermeasured—the rising share of services has led to greater undermeasurement of overall economic growth. This paper demonstrates that this argument is of little quantitative significance. Even under assumptions most favorable to the hypothesis, the rising share of services has had only a small impact on measurement error. These results—along with evidence from Baily and Gordon (1988) —make mismeasurement of output an improbable explanation for the productivity slowdown in aggregate data. © 1997 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe imbricated-cell {{multilevel}} converter is {{well suited}} to high power applications. It allows the series connection of n switches with natural voltage sharing between these switches enabled through the connection of n- 1 flying capacitors. This paper deals with the application of soft-switching on this topology; to date, only the hard-switching mode has been studied. The use of soft switching enables an increase of the switching frequency (resulting in the size reduction of the flying capacitors) without a decrease of the converter efficiency. Of the soft switching methods considered, the Auxiliary Resonant Commutated Pole (ARCP) technique was chosen due to the relative ease in which it {{can be incorporated into}} the converter topology. Furthermore, this technique offers numerous advantages: loss reduction, no added stress to the switches and compatibility with PWM control. The main properties of the ARCP multicell converter are the same as the hard-switched topology: an increase of the <b>apparent</b> <b>output</b> switching frequency and natural self-balancing of the flying-capacitor voltages. This paper presents the results of both simulations performed and measurements taken from an experimental set-up in order to study the viable system functioning. The introduction of soft-switching strongly complicates the theoretical study of the balancing mechanisms, however. As a result, the authors depend on simulations to validate the natural balancing effect during soft switching. Lastly, a general method of loss measurement is presented.

40|$|Robots are {{traditionally}} used in factory environments, where they perform tasks with high precision and speed. This kind of robots {{is designed to}} have a high mechanical stiffness and with powerful motors, so that the required precision and speed can be achieved. However, such designs are inherently unsafe, and therefore these robots are separated from the factory workers. In order to have robots safely interact with humans, they need to meet new requirements in terms of safety and interaction. Actuators with variable stiffness are characterized by the property that their <b>apparent</b> <b>output</b> stiffness can be varied. This is generally realized by incorporating a number of elastic elements in the design. A number of internal degrees of freedom are then used to regulate how these elastic elements are perceived at the actuator output. A robot equipped with such actuators can thus adapt its impedance to levels suitable for a given task and environment. Furthermore, the elastic elements can be used to temporarily store energy, which can be beneficial for increasing the energy-efficiency of such robots. This dissertation explores the designs and applications of actuators with variable stiffness, with a focus on their energetic behavior. For this purpose a generic model has been developed, which enables the analysis for the power flows between the internal elastic elements and the environment. This analysis provides insight in the efficiency of the actuator by visualizing how externally supplied energy can be temporarily stored and reused. These insights are at the basis of two new control algorithms, which aim and minimizing the energy consumption of the actuator.

This paper deals {{with one of the}} vehicles, KD 605, which has an overall cab, 7. 2 ton in weight, and is equipped with a super-charged diesel engine. It is also provided with a navigation system, several berths for the crew and cooking space, snow melter, and some racks built in for installing observation and radio equipments. In addition, to endure the severe environment of low temperature (- 60 ℃) and high altitude of 4, 000 meters, special care was taken in selecting the materials and in making the inhabitants comfortable. The vehicle covered 5, 353 km within 110 days for driving and 31 days for camping, consuming 12, 068 litres in total of diesel fuel. The snow surface was relatively hard from Syowa Station to 75 °S. On the upward slope, drifting and blowing snow caused by katabatic wind was intense. In some areas the snow vehicle and sleds were stuck into soft snow accumulated by wind or due to the surface configuration. The highest area along the route was a plateau more than 3, 500 meters between 75 °S and 80 °S. Soft snow covers this plateau where the wind was very weak and the air temperature was below - 50 ℃. Snow vehicle tracks sank as deep as 30 cm into the snow and the fuel consumption rate rose as high as 3. 5 l/km. Stopping longer than 5 minutes caused the runner of sled to stick to the snow surface, so that starting without help became impossible. Sticking was more pronounced with the decrease of air temperature. On the high plateau, more than 3, 700 meteis in altitude, the exhausted gas became dark due to the shortage of air and the increasing resistance. As a result, <b>apparent</b> <b>output</b> lowering was accompanied by knocking sounds while the engine was driven at low to medium speed. In the terrain south of 80 °S, (except the soft snow-covered area near the pole), the air temperature was about - 30 ℃ and the snow condition was getting better. As the terrain was downward slope, all these conditions helped the party to have pleasant driving.

The SN, which was discovered behind the Large Magellanic Cloud at z = 0. 289 by the SuperMACHO microlensing survey, peaked at M_R = - 21. 5 mag and only declined by 2. 9 mag over 4. 7 years after the peak. Over this period, SN 2003 ma had an integrated bolometric luminosity of 4 x 10 ^ 51 ergs, more than any other SN to date. The radiated energy is close to the limit allowed by conventional core-collapse explosions. Optical spectra reveal that SN 2003 ma has persistent single-peaked intermediate-width hydrogen lines, a signature of interaction between the SN and a dense circumstellar medium. The light curves show further evidence for circumstellar interaction, including a long plateau with a shape very similar to the classic SN IIn 1988 Z [...] however, SN 2003 ma is ten times more luminous at all epochs. The fast velocity measured for the intermediate-width H_alpha component (~ 6000 km/s) points towards an extremely energetic explosion (> 10 ^ 52 ergs), which imparts a faster blast-wave speed to the post-shock material and a higher luminosity from the interaction than is observed in typical SNe IIn.

While the COW experiment did observe a gravitational influence on the output of the interferometer, their data is adequately described by analysing a Mach-Zehnder interferometer placed in a Newtonian gravitational field, rather than a truly relativistic spacetime. The key physical extension of the COW experiment present in [10] is to construct an interferometer large enough that general relativistic effects become <b>apparent</b> in the <b>output</b> of the interferometer, and to let the position of the photon in the interferometer serve as the local clock.

40|$|Objective: Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery induces a {{transient}} rise in pro-inflammatory cytokines typically released by activated monocytes. The E 4 variant of apolipoprotein E is a recognized {{risk factor for}} atherosclerosis. It has recently been shown that apolipoprotein E affects monocyte functions in vitro and leads {{to higher levels of}} median lipoprotein (a) in humans. The aim of the study is to investigate if the E 4 genetic variant of apolipoprotein E affects cytokine release after CPB surgery. Methods: 22 patients were operated on with standard coronary artery bypass grafting. Concentrations of interleukin 8 (IL- 8) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) were measured by automated Immulite immunoassay at regular intervals within 48 h after surgery. Total <b>apparent</b> cytokine <b>outputs</b> were calculated as area under the curve. Results are expressed as mean±standard deviation and compared by unpaired t-test. Results: In the presented patient population 6 (27 %) carried the E 4 allele. Sixteen (63 %) showed no E 4 allele. Mean cross clamp time (CCT) was 56. 2 ± 13. 5 min versus 55. 7 ± 12. 1 min and CPB time was 91. 8 ± 17. 5 versus 93. 5 ± 15. 7 min. No statistical difference between E 4 -carriers and E 4 non-carriers regarding CCT and CPB was observed. The total amount of IL- 8 and TNF-α was higher in patients carrying the E 4 genetic variant of apolipoprotein E in comparison to E 4 non-carriers (P≪ 0. 08, P≪ 0. 039).

40|$|The {{medical records}} of 118 {{patients}} (86 male, 32 female, age 10 - 50 (mean 27) years) who underwent pericardiectomy for constrictive pericarditis at the Christian Medical College Hospital, Vellore, from 1954 to 1985 were reviewed. All had appreciable pericardial constriction. Preoperatively 97 of the 118 were in class III or IV of the New York Heart Association classification and 100 had peripheral oedema or ascites. Tuberculosis was proved {{as the cause}} in 72 patients. Pericardiectomy was accomplished through a standard anterolateral thoracotomy (107 cases), median sternotomy (3 cases), or bilateral thoracotomy (8 cases). Postoperatively an <b>apparent</b> low cardiac <b>output</b> state was seen in 34 patients, 12 of whom died. Hospital mortality in the last 12 years was 11 %. Mortality was higher in NYHA class III and IV patients. The improved surgical results recently {{may be related to}} increased use of inotropic support and prolonged ventilation. At follow up there were 72 patients in whom functional capacity could be assessed; 63 were in class I or II. The poor results of pericardiectomy in some patients are likely to be related to advanced preoperative disability and early pericardiectomy is therefore recommended...|$|R
40|$|Strain gage <b>apparent</b> strain (thermal <b>output)</b> {{is one of}} {{the largest}} sources of error {{associated}} with the measurement of strain when temperatures and mechanical loads are varied. In this paper, experimentally determined apparent strains of WK-type strain gages, installed on both metallic and composite-laminate materials of various lay-ups and resin systems for temperatures ranging from - 450 F to 230 F are presented. For the composite materials apparent strain in both the 0 ply orientation angle and the 90 ply orientation angle were measured. Metal specimens tested included: aluminum-lithium alloy (Al-LI 2195 -T 87), aluminum alloy (Al 2219 -T 87), and titanium alloy. Composite materials tested include: graphite-toughened-epoxy (IM 7 / 997 - 2), graphite-bismaleimide (IM 7 / 5260), and graphite-K 3 (IM 7 /K 3 B). The experimentally determined apparent strain data are curve fit with a fourth-order polynomial for each of the materials studied. The apparent strain data and the polynomials that are fit to the data are compared with those produced by the strain gage manufacturer, and the results and comparisons are presented. Unacceptably high errors between the manufacture's data and the experimentally determined data were observed (especially at temperatures below - 270 -F) ...|$|R
40|$|Hedgehog (Hh) {{proteins}} play diverse organizing {{roles in}} animal development by regulating gene expression in responding cells. Several {{components of the}} Hh signal transduction pathway have been identified, yet their precise role in mediating the various outputs of the pathway is still poorly understood. The Gli homolog Cubitus interruptus (Ci) is involved in controlling the transcription of Drosophila Hh target genes and thus represents the most downstream component known in this pathway. We {{address the question of}} whether the Hh pathway is distally branched or, in other words, whether the regulation of Ci activity is the sole output of Hh signaling. Putative Ci-independent branches of Hh signaling are explored by analyzing the behavior of cells that lack Ci but have undergone maximal activation of the Hh transduction pathway due to the removal of Patched (Ptc). The analysis of target gene expression and morphogenetic read-outs of Hh in embryonic, larval and adult stages indicates that Ci is absolutely required for all examined aspects of Hh outputs. We interpret this as evidence against the existence of Ci-independent branches in the Hh signal transduction pathway and propose that most cases of <b>apparent</b> Ci/Gli-independent Hh <b>output</b> can be attributed to the derepression of target gene expression in the absence of Ci/Gli repressor function...|$|R
