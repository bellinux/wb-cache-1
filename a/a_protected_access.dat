This network is a generalised form of a real-world application, already developed under the Lotus Platform. This application ensures the restricted access of several authorised persons from local public institutions to log to a central server and to access the appropriate interfaces {{that allow them to}} send information. Other users are able to initiate the data collecting process. This project has as a result an automated data collecting system and has other useful functions as: centralisation of the data in <b>a</b> <b>protected</b> database, <b>access</b> to automated reports, public access to certain information via a WEB site, selective access to the database, accordingly {{to the role of the}} users, customisation of the interfaces, data exchange with other information systems etc. The solution will contribute to the genericity, and customisation improvement by a research with the objectives emphasised in the paper. This research will yield a software pattern, and also suggests several ways to make easy the customisation, including an original representation of the information.

40|$|A common {{operation}} in multiprocessor programs is acquiring <b>a</b> lock to <b>protect</b> <b>access</b> to shared data. Typically, the requesting thread is blocked if the lock it needs {{is held by}} another thread. The cost of blocking one thread and activating another can be {{a substantial part of}} program execution time. Alternatively, the thread could spin until the lock is free, or spin {{for a while and then}} block. This may avoid context-switch overhead, but processor cycles may be wasted in unproductive spinning. This paper studies seven strategies for determining whether and how long to spin before blocking. Of particular interest are competitive strategies, for which the performance can be shown to be no worse than some constant factor times an optimal off-line strategy. The performance of five competitive strategies is compared with that of always blocking, always spinning, or using the optimal off-line algorithm. Measurements of lock-waiting time distributions for five parallel programs were used to co [...] ...|$|R
