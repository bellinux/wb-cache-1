5|$|To the {{attacker}}s' surprise, Voss {{did not try}} {{to escape}} the aerial trap. Instead, he flicked his triplane <b>about</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> flat spin and fired at his attackers in a headon firing pass, holing McCudden's wings. Voss riddled Cronyn's SE.5 from close range, putting him out of the dogfight. Cronyn had to turn in under his attacker and throw his aircraft into a spin to escape being killed. His wingmates attacked Voss while Cronyn also limped for home.|$|E
5|$|The {{cemetery}} {{consists of}} neat lines of graves arranged on an east–west alignment, covering a nearly square area of <b>about</b> , <b>in</b> <b>a</b> layout {{not seen in}} any other known Anglo-Saxon cemetery. The enclosure within which the cemetery was laid out was many centuries older, dating to about 200BC; {{the establishment of a}} cemetery within its boundaries was probably intended to serve as a deliberate link to the past. It would still have been clearly visible in Saxon times. The layout of the cemetery seem to have consciously reflected that of the earlier enclosure, with its apparent main entrance aligned with that of the enclosure.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the episode come from a {{conversation}} between Jane O'Brien and Mike Scully, when the two {{were talking about how}} girls always want to grow up so fast, as Scully has five daughters; so they decided to produce an episode with a storyline based on this. The idea behind the episode plot came from Jace Richdale, {{who came up with the}} idea of Homer stealing grease and the grease business, having read <b>about</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> magazine. Several aspects of the characters used throughout the episode had been improvised significantly by Lisa Kudrow. Ron Hauge, a writer for The Simpsons, came up with the initial character of Alex, and Jane O'Brien named the character after her best friend. The scene showing Homer's hemorrhaged eye as Groundskeeper Willie strangles him got a big laugh in the studio. Mike Scully comments that he now uses it in college clip shows.|$|E

25|$|According to Gwendolyn O’ Neal, {{the author}} of African American Aesthetics of Dress (1997), she states that “while an African-American {{aesthetic}} of dress is neither African nor American, it is shaped by unique ‘cultural’ experiences resulting from being of African descent and living in America”. The famous rapper, Jay Z also echoed the same words O’Neal talks <b>about.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> Black Book Magazine interview Jay Z made, he once defended the upper-class tastes of fashion in the hip hop culture as ‘living it on our terms, {{instead of trying to}} emulate an elite lifestyle’ with the wearing of high-net-worth fashion house brands. It is not necessarily because of conspicuous consumption that the hip hop lifestyle brought in these high end fashion products.|$|E
25|$|As in all Macronaria, the forelimbs of brachiosaurids {{are long}} {{relative}} to the hindlimbs, but this trait is more pronounced in brachiosaurids. The forelimbs were very slender for a sauropod and the metacarpal bones of the forelimb were elongated. These adaptations overall increased the stride length of the forelimbs, arguably resulting in an uneven gait. However, it was previously argued that they were hindlimb dominant like other sauropods, and thus {{had the ability to}} rear up on their hindlimbs. Based on the structure of their legs, making it impossible for them to run, it is likely that they moved <b>about</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> low walking speed (20–40km/day), but were capable of moving faster when necessary, up to 20–30km/hour, depending on leg length.|$|E

25|$|Before any of {{us could}} rise to examine it, four more lights {{appeared}} almost simultaneously, about the same shape, and varying only in size. Surrounding each one was the dim outline of a small human figure, black and grotesque, more like a little image carved out of black shining wood, than anything else I can liken them to. Dorothea kissed her hands to these dreadful little shapes, and Michael bowed with great reverence.

25|$|Set in {{the early}} 1900s in the fictional Catfish Row section of Charleston, South Carolina, which serves as home to a black fishing community, the story focuses on the title characters: {{crippled}} beggar Porgy, who travels <b>about</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> goat-drawn cart, and the drug-addicted Bess, who lives with stevedore Crown, the local bully. While high on cocaine supplied by Sportin' Life, Crown kills Robbins after the latter vanquishes him in a craps game; Bess urges Crown to flee. Sportin' Life suggests she accompany him to New York City, an offer Bess declines. She seeks refuge with her neighbors, all of whom refuse to help her. Porgy finally agrees to let her stay with him.|$|E
25|$|In 1952, Gardner {{had begun}} to {{correspond}} with a young woman named Doreen Valiente. She eventually requested initiation into the Craft, and though Gardner was hesitant at first, he agreed that they could meet during the winter {{at the home of}} Edith Woodford-Grimes. Valiente got on well with both Gardner and Woodford-Grimes, and having no objections to either ritual nudity or scourging (which she had read <b>about</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> copy of Gardner's novel High Magic's Aid that he had given to her), she was initiated by Gardner into Wicca on Midsummer 1953. Valiente went on to join the Bricket Wood Coven. She soon rose to become the High Priestess of the coven, and helped Gardner to revise his Book of Shadows, and attempting to cut out most of Crowley's influence.|$|E

25|$|Alongside to cartels, are the {{paramilitary}} groups who work alongside {{them to provide}} protection. This protection began {{with a focus on}} maintaining the drug trade; however, paramilitary groups now secure other valuable industries such as oil and mining. It has been suggested that the rise in paramilitary groups coincides with a loss of security within the government. These paramilitary groups came <b>about</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> number of ways. Firstly, there have been large waves of elite armed forces and government security experts who have left the side of the government and joined the side of the cartels, often with large bribes and an opportunity for types of wealth they may not receive in government positions. The paramilitary group, the Zetas, used military personnel to create one of the largest paramilitary groups in Mexico. Some of the elite armed forces members who join paramilitaries are trained in the School of the Americas. These paramilitaries have begun out of a deregulation of the Mexican army who has been slowly replaced by private security firms.|$|E
25|$|Since Moore, {{other actors}} played him in later series, notably Return of the Saint (1978–1979) {{starring}} Ian Ogilvy; the series ran for one season, {{although it was}} picked up by the CBS network. In the mid-1980s, the National Enquirer and other newspapers reported that Moore was planning to produce a movie based on The Saint with Pierce Brosnan as Templar, but it was never made. (Ironically Brosnan almost became Moore's immediate successor as James Bond.) A television pilot for a The Saint in Manhattan series starring Australian actor Andrew Clarke was shown on CBS in 1987 as part of the CBS Summer Playhouse; the pilot was produced by Don Taffner, but it never progressed beyond the pilot stage. Inspector John Fernack of the NYPD, played by Kevin Tighe, made his first film appearance since the 1940s in that production, while Templar (sporting a moustache) got <b>about</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> black Lamborghini bearing the ST1 licence plate. In 1989, six movies were made by Taffner starring Simon Dutton. These were syndicated in the United States as part of a series of films titled Mystery Wheel of Adventure, while in the United Kingdom they were shown as a series on ITV.|$|E
25|$|The first Nootka Convention, {{called the}} Nootka Sound Convention, {{resolved}} {{the crisis in}} general. The convention held that the northwest coast {{would be open to}} traders of both Britain and Spain, that the captured British ships would be returned and an indemnity paid. It also held that the land owned by the British at Nootka Sound would be restored, which proved difficult to carry out. The Spanish claimed that the only such land was the small parcel where Meares had built the North West America. The British held that Meares had in fact purchased the whole of Nootka Sound from Maquinna, as well as some land to the south. Until the details were worked out, which took several years, Spain retained control of Nootka Sound and continued to garrison the fort at Friendly Cove. Complicating the issue was the changing role of the Nuu-chah-nulth in relation to Britain and Spain. The Nuu-chah-nulth had become highly suspicious and hostile toward Spain following the 1789 killing of Callicum. But the Spanish worked hard to improve the relationship, and by the time of Nootka Conventions were to be carried out the Nuu-chah-nulth were essentially allied with the Spanish. This development came <b>about</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> large degree due to the efforts by Alessandro Malaspina and his officers during his month-long stay at Nootka Sound in 1791. Malaspina was able to regain the trust of Maquinna and the promise that the Spanish had the rightful title of land ownership at Nootka Sound.|$|E
