In this paper, we show that the number of firms that adopt <b>advanced</b> <b>abatement</b> <b>technology</b> could be higher with emissions trading than with a tax if there is imperfect competition in the permits market. Under perfect competition, the number would always be higher with a tax, given that the regulator is myopic.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two independent studies. The first study belongs {{to the field of}} environmental economics and the second is on international trade, with a focus on offshoring. In the first study, we investigate firm investment in <b>advanced</b> <b>abatement</b> <b>technology</b> under a heterogeneous firms framework. In contrast to existing literature, we find that the optimal level of investment in <b>advanced</b> <b>abatement</b> <b>technology</b> is an inverted U-shaped function of firm productivity. More-productive firms have superior environmental performance, {{in the sense that they}} have lower emission per unit of output. Comparative statics shows that in response to a tighter environmental regulation, more-productive firms tend to raise their investment in <b>advanced</b> <b>abatement</b> <b>technology</b> while less-productive firms do the opposite. Key theoretical predictions are confirmed by Chinese data. The second study analyzes the decision of a multinational firm from a developed country to slice a production chain to allocate different tasks of the production chain globally. The process involves a wide range of tasks that varies from very routine jobs to very research and development (R&D) intensive work. We find that under certain conditions, a drop in offshoring costs (1) leads to more slicing (an increase in the length of production chain) and more offshoring, (2) stimulates R&D, and (3) raises employment in the developed country. published_or_final_versionEconomics and FinanceDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|Polluting {{firms with}} <b>advanced</b> <b>abatement</b> <b>technology</b> at their {{disposal}} have incentives or disincentives to share this technology with other polluting firms. The 'direction' and extent of those incentives depends on the liability rule applicable and the way technical change impacts marginal abatement costs. We establish that incentives for diffusion are socially optimal under strict liability and socially suboptimal under negligence if technical change lowers marginal abatement costs for all levels of abatement. Negligence may, however, induce better diffusion incentives than strict liability if technical change decreases (increases) marginal abatement costs for low (high) levels of abatement.

This paper demonstrates that productivity dispersion across plants {{is an important}} factor that influences the transmission of environmental policy. Within a general equilibrium framework, I model heterogeneous polluting plants by allowing them to be differing in productivity and to choose optimally a discrete emission-reduction technology taking into account both the costs of reducing emissions and the competition in the goods market. An emission-reduction policy affects the distribution of plants with the <b>advanced</b> <b>abatement</b> <b>technology</b> and relocates resources and market shares across plants. As a result, the aggregate effects of an environmental policy depend on the degree of productivity dispersion.

We examine multistage games where the government may intervene {{in order to maximize}} social welfare by setting an environmental tax rate. When the government intervenes, it levies either an energy tax or an emission tax. We show that the effectiveness of either type of tax depends on the shape of the multiproduct technology. In the absence of economies of scope in the production of energy and abatement, the energy tax reduces pollution but is ineffective in promoting technological change. The emission tax reduces pollution and is effective in promoting technological change for sufficiently small fixed costs of adoption. In the presence of economies of scope, firms may adopt the efficient technology {{even in the absence of}} taxation. When taxation is necessary for innovation, both types of taxes are effective.

In order to derive policy-relevant conclusions, we develop an ecology-economy model of the EU by linking an environmental effect from countries' SO 2 (sulphur dioxide) abatement with their economic outcomes. We consider SO 2 reduction strategies (GAINS) available for the EU member states during 2015 - 2020 and, compare environmental and economic impacts in two scenarios assuming that a base-line abatement technology and respectively, an <b>advanced</b> <b>abatement</b> <b>technology</b> are being used. Furthermore, we introduce elements of game theory and consider a possibility for cooperation in air pollution abatement among several Baltic countries (Finland, Sweden, Denmark and Latvia). The optimal choice of the technologies and corresponding levels of SO 2 reduction are determined for the given countries. The coalition scenario is shown to be superior to the baseline scenario. We study a positive externality effect and demonstrate that the neighboring countries, Estonia and Lithuania, receive the highest impact from pollution reduction. Possible free-riding by Latvia and Finland is considered. It has been proven that stability of cooperation is achievable...|$|E

They should be replaced by market-oriented instruments, such as a system of environmental taxes and charges. Such a system would provide incentives to reduce the demand for polluting activities or to substitute other goods for pollution-intensive commodities. Further, it would provide incentives to continually apply the most <b>advanced</b> <b>abatement</b> <b>technology</b> available. • With international or global environmental problems on the upsurge, there is an increasing role for environmental policy coordination at the Community level. Coordination of environmental policy should in general stop short of a harmonisation of environmental tax and charge rates, as differential tax and charge rates can very frequently be made compatible {{with the needs of}} the completed Internal Market 1992. • In the absence of transboundary spillovers, environmental policy can be completely decentralised if polluting activities can be charged without using integrated control devices. If integrated control devices are unavoidable, only the tax or charge base needs to be harmonised. Tax and charge rates should be fixed by national authorities. Furthermore, if there are no transboundary spillovers and if goods are taxed at the consumption level, only norms for the declaration of polluting components should be set at the Community level. If goods are taxed at the production level, an integrated market requires the harmonisation of tax bases and tax rates at the cost of major environmental distortions. • If there are international environmental spillovers and if side payments between countries are not feasible, merely international diffusion norms should be set at the Community level. If spillovers are global (e. g. {{in the case of the}} ozone hole and climate change), tax or charge bases as well as rates should be harmonised at the Community level. [...] ...|$|E

With respect to previous works, in which one of these three dimensions is omitted, we consider their combined effects, arriving to novel results in the literature.

Here, {{a positive relationship between}} public education spending and environment quality emerges as well as between environment maintenance expenditure and human capital. At the same time, countries with a high environmental quality should spend less on environment maintenance compared to heavily polluted countries.

In more than 50 percent of estimated cases in which water quality goals are not achieved, diffuse pollution is cited as the main cause. This guide surveys the myriad problems and challenges presented by this form of pollution, and offers a wide range of feasible, cost-effective solutions for dealing with them. Water Quality: Prevention, Identification, and Management of Diffuse Pollution covers aspects of diffuse pollution ranging from sources and sites to health and legal consequences. It provides readers with valuable discussions of Sources of diffuse pollution Legal definitions The hydrologic nature of diffuse loads, and the processes and land uses contributing to these loads Best management practices that emphasize removal of priority pollutants Use of wetlands The fate of pollutants in receiving waters The restoration of reservoirs, streams, lakes, and watersheds that have been damaged Extensive data are provided on nontoxic as well as toxic pollutants, including new toxic compounds. The authors provide an integrated approach to water quality control and explain <b>advanced</b> pollution <b>abatement</b> <b>technologies,</b> {{such as the use of}} wetlands. Sections on repercussions to the economy include discussions of cost/benefit analyses of abatement programs and the payments that support the programs.

The basic reason for these results is that a larger production scale supports more fixed investments in <b>abatement</b> <b>technology</b> and, in turn, lower emissions per output.
