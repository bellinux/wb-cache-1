Grecia Colmenares played Ana, which replaced Belen as the central figure. Darío Grandinetti played her romantic interest Juan and Marcela Kloosterboer played Candela, the main character in the young cast.

5000|$|A {{black-and-white}} film employing handheld {{camera and}} a fragmented, impressionistic narrative structure, Tanakas Confidential Report: Sex Market (1974) {{is among the most}} unusual-looking films in the Roman Porno series. The first film in Tanakas Showa Trilogy, A Woman Called Sada Abe is more conventional than most of his films, but highly regarded by critics. Tanaka was proud of his ability to produce a high-quality film on a minimal budget. Nikkatsu allotted 7,500,000 yen (approximately US$65,000) for their Roman porno films, but Tanaka used only about 6,600,000 yen to make A Woman Called Sada Abe. Tanaka later explained, [...] "I managed to make it for about 900,000 yen under budget. I believe it depends on the initial concept. I was confident {{that as long as the}} concept was good, it would become a great film and beat any of those films made for 10,000,000 yen. I think thats the most interesting thing about film-making: its so unpredictable. Abe Sadas simple lip movement could say more and be more appealing to an audience than thousands of horses running around a field. Its possible that lip movement could be more effective than thousands of horses <b>and</b> <b>thats</b> <b>why</b> film-making is very creative and incredibly interesting." ...|$|E

5000|$|For Squad 5-O, {{the move}} to Tooth and Nail {{was more than just}} a change of {{approach}} in musical style. The band also began to move away from explicit references to Jesus, and to use metaphor more extensively. They also began to tour in more mainstream venues than churches, as explained by Jeff Fortson: [...] "Jesus said to be fishers of men; we have realized that you cant do that unless youre where the people who need him are." [...] Generally, the band was discontented with the state of the Christian music industry and Christian subculture, which they saw as exploitive and misleading. Jeff Fortson contrasted for HM magazine their experiences playing at a [...] "large Christian event" [...] and a secular one a few days later. At the Christian event (which was headlined by Steven Curtis Chapman) [...] "... the kids were coming out of the seats and standing in the aisles to come up and rock out with us...

5000|$|Despite being heavily {{associated}} with firearms in his Westerns and police movies, Eastwood has publicly endorsed gun control {{since at least}} 1973. In the April 24, 1973, edition of The Washington Post, the star said, [...] "Im for gun legislation myself. I dont hunt." [...] Two years later, in 1975, Eastwood told People magazine that he favors [...] "gun control to some degree." [...] About a year later, Eastwood remarked that [...] "All guns should be registered.

[...] In 1993, he noted that he [...] "...was always a backer" [...] of the Brady Bill, with its federally mandated waiting period. In 1995, Eastwood questioned the purpose of assault weapons. Larry King, the television host and newspaper columnist, wrote in the May 22, 1995, edition of USA Today that [...] "my interview with Eastwood will air on Larry King Weekend ... I asked him his thoughts on the NRA and gun control and he said that while people think of him as pro-gun, he has always been in favor of controls.

[...] "Fairweather Friend" [...] featured originally music written by Schulz and Bruni. An unrecorded Lydon/Schulz composition [...] "Animal" [...] was registered too. Schulz and PIL tour bassist Bret Helm had previously registered a further (presumably non-PIL, therefore unused) composition called “Cat Rap”. John Lydon: “Most {{of the songs}} on the Album, for instance, were written at home and put onto demonstration tapes. But I didnt think the touring band were good enough or experienced enough really to, like, record the song properly. <b>And</b> <b>thats</b> <b>why</b> I use session people. using session musicians the songs obviously changed - their shape, and not their direction.” “I had a live band before recording took place {{and a lot of}} material together before going into the studio. But the band was totally inexperienced, they would have put the budget up by an incredible amount. So we decided to use session people.” “I make records for myself. I want them to be completely precise. Accuracy is very important to me. Otherwise its bad work and a waste of my time, and I really dont want to waste my time. There must be a conclusion to what you do, no vagueness. There must be a sense of completeness. Every song is an emotion and it has to succeed as that, otherwise youve failed. Its bad work. That annoys me. Bad work from anyone just annoys me. I just dont need it.” Producer Bill Laswell: “When we did PiL he had put a band together in California of some kids. And I had sort of decided to make a heavy group, so I invited Tony Williams, Ginger Baker, Steve Vai, and all these people came. We fired Johns band and there were many nights of really harsh arguing in bars. When the smoke cleared, we made sort of a classic record, an unusual record for the time.” ...|$|E
