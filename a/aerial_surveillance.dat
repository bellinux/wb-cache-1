5|$|The Germans {{had begun}} massing troops near the Soviet border {{even before the}} {{campaign}} in the Balkans had finished. By {{the third week of}} February 1941, 680,000 German soldiers were gathered in assembly areas on the Romanian-Soviet border. In preparation for the attack, Hitler had secretly moved upwards of 3 million German troops and approximately 690,000 Axis soldiers to the Soviet border regions. Additional Luftwaffe operations included numerous <b>aerial</b> <b>surveillance</b> missions over Soviet territory many months before the attack.|$|E

However, no action was taken against the Church. The investigation ground to a halt after a ruling by a U.S. District Court judge in a case concerning Marc and Claire Headley's complaints against the Church over their treatment at Gold Base.|$|E
5|$|No.114 MCRU {{deployed}} to Malaya in 1958, becoming operational at RAAF Base Butterworth on 19August. It took over responsibility for <b>aerial</b> <b>surveillance</b> and ground-controlled interception from the Royal Air Force's No.487 Signals Unit on 1December. From Butterworth, No.114 MCRU directed the Sabre fighters of Nos.3 and 77 Squadrons and the Canberra bombers of No.2 Squadron {{in the last}} years of the Malayan Emergency. It also sent controllers on attachment to Ubon Air Base in Thailand, where No.79 Squadron was based from 1962. On 3September 1964, the unit went on to a 24-hour operational footing to support the Sidewinder-armed Sabres of Nos.3 and 77 Squadrons during the Konfrontasi between Indonesia and Malaysia, though no combat ensued. Konfrontasi having been declared over in August 1966, No.114 MCRU transferred its responsibilities to RAF Western Hill on 22September, and disbanded at Butterworth on 31October.|$|E

5|$|The {{preceding}} bombing missions, {{together with}} resistance sabotage acts, hit the Germans heavily, interrupting railroads, damaging bridges, and disrupting the communication network. The landing {{started on the}} morning of 15August. Ships of the Western Naval Task Force approached under cover of darkness and were in position at dawn. The first of 1,300 Allied bombers from Italy, Sardinia, and Corsica began aerial bombardment shortly before 0600. Bombing was nearly continuous until 0730 when battleships and cruisers launched spotting aircraft and began firing on specific targets detected by <b>aerial</b> <b>surveillance.</b> Naval gunfire ceased as the landing craft headed ashore at 0800. The relatively steep beach gradients with small tidal range discouraged Axis placement of underwater obstacles, but landing beaches had been defensively mined. LCIs leading the first wave of landing craft fired rockets to explode land mines on the beaches to be used by following troops.|$|E
5|$|Though the Indian Navy {{achieved}} significant {{success with}} Operation Trident, its main target, the oil storage facilities in Karachi, were still operational as {{only one of}} the two missiles fired had hit them. This failure was later assessed as the result of confusion created between the commanding officers of the three missile boats. Furthermore, the Indians mistook tracer fire from the coastal artillery of Karachi as originating from Pakistani aircraft, and retreated hurriedly before they could properly target the tanks. After the first attack during Operation Trident on the Port of Karachi, Pakistan stepped up <b>aerial</b> <b>surveillance</b> of its coast as the presence of large Indian Navy ships gave the impression that another attack was being planned. Pakistani warships attempted to outsmart the Indian Navy by mingling with merchant shipping. To counter these moves, Operation Python was launched.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{describe}} {{an approach to}} evaluating algorithmic and human performance in directing UAV-based surveillance. Its key elements are a decision-theoretic framework for measuring the utility of a surveillance schedule and an evaluation testbed consisting of 243 scenarios covering a welldefined space of possible missions. We apply this approach to two example UAV-based surveillance methods, a TSP-based algorithm and a human-directed approach, then compare them to identify general {{strengths and weaknesses of}} each method. UAV-based <b>Surveillance</b> <b>Aerial</b> reconnaissance, <b>surveillance,</b> and other observation tasks have been primary aircraft applications {{since the early days of}} powered flight.
