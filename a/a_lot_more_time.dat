500|$|Soundgarden {{began working}} on its fourth album after touring in support of Badmotorfinger. Cornell said that while working on the album, the band allowed each other more freedom than on past records, and Thayil {{observed}} that the band spent <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> working on the recording of the songs than on previous records. Released on March 8, 1994, Superunknown became the band's breakthrough album, driven by the singles [...] "Spoonman", [...] "The Day I Tried to Live", [...] "Black Hole Sun", [...] "My Wave", and [...] "Fell on Black Days"; Superunknown debuted at {{number one on the}} Billboard 200 album chart.|$|E

50|$|After making {{just eight}} league {{appearances}} {{in the first half}} of the 13/14 Serie A season, all of them as a substitute, Belfodil joined fellow Serie A club Livorno on loan for the remainder of the 2013-14 season on 31 January 2014. At Livorno, Belfodil got <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> playing <b>time</b> but his form was poor in a side that was ultimately relegated, failing to register a goal or assist in his time there.|$|R
5000|$|The one - year {{option that}} the club had on Winchester's {{contract}} was exercised, extending his contract {{till the end}} of the 2014-15 season, with manager Lee Johnson stating that the club would be looking to loan him out next season to somewhere that could offer him <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> game <b>time</b> than Oldham could currently offer him, as well as stating that he believed [...] "there was a real player in there somewhere".|$|R
500|$|Soundgarden {{began work}} on the album about two months after {{finishing}} its stint on the 1992 Lollapalooza tour. The individual band members would work on material {{on their own and}} then bring in demos to which {{the other members of the}} band would contribute. Frontman Chris Cornell said that the band members allowed each other more freedom than on past records. Thayil observed that even though the band spent as much time writing and arranging as it had on previous albums, it spent <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> working on recording the songs. [...] After two albums with producer Terry Date, the band decided to seek another collaborator, as guitarist Kim Thayil said, [...] "We just thought we'd go for a change." [...] Eventually they settled on producer Michael Beinhorn, who [...] "didn't have his own trademark sound which he was trying to tack on to Soundgarden" [...] and had ideas the band approved.|$|E
500|$|The band {{first began}} writing songs at their {{rehearsal}} space in their hometown of Minneapolis, which they nicknamed the [...] "Dungeon", {{due to its}} ability to [...] "suck the life and energy out of the band." [...] For Pierre, the album came at {{the brink of a}} transitional period for him, in which he began to seek treatment for alcohol abuse. He left the band during the writing stages for Los Angeles where he moved in with Epitaph founder Brett Gurewitz and began attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Afterwards, the band rejoined Pierre in Los Angeles to begin recording demos for a month; the change of scenery brought about new energy for the group, according to Pierre. Commit This to Memory would be the first album by the band to feature material crafted by each musician in the group, as previous releases had featured songs written in the years prior to each member joining. In addition, the band had more time and funds to spend time working on the album. [...] "It was also the first time we had <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> and money to go in and feel like we were making a real record this time, whereas I Am the Movie was recorded in little segments here and there and eventually pieced together," [...] said drummer Tony Thaxton.|$|E
500|$|In January 2011, Eastwood {{told the}} UK's Daily Mail that [...] "I loved {{the fact that}} Obama is multi-racial. I thought that was terrific, as my wife is the same racial make-up. But I felt he was a greenhorn, {{and it turned out}} he didn't have {{experience}} in decision-making." [...] As for McCain, Eastwood reflected, [...] "I voted for McCain, not because he was a Republican, but because he had been through war (in Vietnam) and I thought he might understand the war in Iraq better than somebody who hadn't. I didn't agree with him on a lot of stuff." [...] On August 3, 2012, he attended a fundraiser for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, suggesting that Romney would boost the country and [...] "restore a decent tax system... so that there's a fairness and people are not pitted against one another as [...] who's paying taxes and who isn't." [...] During a speech at the 2012 Republican National Convention, Eastwood talked to an empty chair as if President Barack Obama were sitting in it. The speech was met with a huge response by the media with both praise and criticism. Eastwood, who said he came up with the speech 5 seconds before he gave it, said that if he could do it again he would say something different. [...] "My only message was [...] I wanted people to take the idolizing factor out of every contestant out there. Just look at the work, look at the background, and then make a judgment on that. I was just trying to say that, and did it in kind of a roundabout way which took <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>time,</b> I suppose, than they would have liked. I'd probably say something else but I'd try to get the same message across so that people don't have to kiss up to politicians. No matter what party they're in, you should evaluate their work and make your judgments accordingly. That's {{the way to do it}} in life and every other subject, but sometimes in America we get gaga, we look at the wrong values." ...|$|E

5000|$|The Allmusic site {{rated the}} album 3 stars stating [...] "There doesn't {{seem to be}} as much thought put into the sequel; though a number of moments are every bit as good as the {{material}} found on the first album, there's also <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> meandering this <b>time</b> around, and some real puzzlers".|$|R
50|$|In 2014, {{he earned}} <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> game <b>time</b> and had nailed down the {{starting}} halfback {{spot for the}} Blues {{by the end of}} the season, dislodging the far more experienced Weepu. However, all the momentum he'd built up through 2014 was lost when a broken foot picked up playing club rugby forced him to miss the entire 2015 campaign, but, fully fit in 2016, new head-coach Tana Umaga made him the franchise's first choice number 9 once more and he went on to play in all 15 of their matches during a slightly disappointing season which ended with them in 11th place in the overall standings.|$|R

2500|$|All {{the riders}} had flown from Lorient to Bordeaux {{on the evening}} of July 9 and now spent their rest day in Bordeaux or some place nearby. Important news on this day came from Floyd Landis, as he {{announced}} that he seriously injured his hip, during training in 2003, which still hinders him while riding due to a bad position on the bike and also causes sleeping problems. He has decided to undergo surgery to receive an artificial hip after the Tour which would hopefully relieve him of these problems. However this also means that it is very well possible that he {{will never be able to}} ride at a professional level again. As a conclusion he mentions this is an extra motivation for him to try to win this Tour. Floyd's teammate Axel Merckx on this day signed a new contract with [...] for one extra season. Merckx, who is now 33 years old, announced that the 2007 season will be his last season, as he wants to spend <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> with his family thereafter. The Phonak team will be called iShares next season.|$|E
50|$|Tapp {{was drafted}} by the Seattle Seahawks {{in the second round}} (63rd overall) of the 2006 NFL Draft. As a rookie, Tapp was a special teamer and part of the Seahawks' {{defensive}} end rotation. He recorded 33 tackles, three sacks, one forced fumble, one interception, and one defensive touchdown. In 2007, he saw <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> playing <b>time,</b> as the Seahawks' former starting left end Grant Wistrom was cut from the team, and the right end Bryce Fisher was traded to the Titans. As a result, he started all 16 games for the Seahawks with new arrival Patrick Kerney as the other defensive end. In 2007, Tapp made 49 tackles, seven sacks, and one interception.|$|R
5000|$|The band {{learned the}} new {{material}} and recorded the album within a two-week period, leaving {{little time to}} rehearse the songs. In addition to the time constraint, they had lost the rehearsal space they had shared with Black Flag, and until {{the first day of}} recording were unable to practice with all of their equipment plugged in. As a result, the songs had much more of a pop sound on the album than they did when the band performed them live. [...] "We could've put <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> practice <b>time</b> into it," [...] said Aukerman during the album's supporting tours, [...] "but I think that the songs themselves are just really good songs. We play them all better now." ...|$|R
50|$|Murray {{signed with}} the Philadelphia Flyers in 2001 where he {{received}} <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> ice <b>time</b> spending almost two full seasons with the team. He {{was traded to the}} Carolina Hurricanes in 2003, spending one season with the team. After the NHL lockout, Murray returned to Germany, spending one season with the Hannover Scorpions. Murray then re-signed with Philadelphia but remained with their AHL affiliate the Philadelphia Phantoms and was eventually claimed off waivers by the Los Angeles Kings, splitting his spell between LA and the Manchester Monarchs. Murray then signed for Swiss Nationalliga A side HC Lugano in 2007. The following year he rejoined the Monarchs for a single season prior to signing a contract with the Manitoba Moose the year after that.|$|R
50|$|Character point-based systems, such as Hero System, allow {{complete}} {{freedom of}} concept. The downside is that, in many cases, character creation {{is much more}} complex, making the GM spend <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>time</b> examining and approving each character concept.|$|E

5000|$|The {{development}} of a tie-in video game for Carmen Sandiego gave her {{the opportunity to do}} her first ever voice-over for a video game. She describes her time with the game as a [...] "really confusing experience" [...] as it required <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> lines and <b>time</b> than the show did. Her next major video game was with BioWare on their Baldur's Gate series on various roles, which would eventually lead to large roles in Mass Effect and other titles.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the end of}} the story, Stanford's father {{reveals that}} he has been working so {{incredibly}} hard all the time because he was hoping for a promotion - which his boss granted him. However, the promotion required a relocation to New York. Stanford protests angrily, but his father tells him that he didn't take the job. He says that he just recently realized how distant he became from his family, and that wants to reconnect with them. Now that he had rejected the promotion, he says, he would probably have <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> free <b>time</b> on his hands to spend with Stanford. The book ends with Stanford thinking, [...] "I have so much to tell my dad." [...] Later that night, he falls asleep wearing Alan Scott BK620s, what he always wanted the whole summer.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine how the {{religious}} education is implemented in junior and grammar school. As a base for my examination I used two private schools and two municipal schools. My main goal was to get a better view of the content of the education, the treatment of the students and the conditions for the students to get a greater understanding and respect for others’ religious beliefs and opinions through education. To reach this goal I did interviews and field studies which means that the paper has a qualitative approach. The examination showed clearly that the private schools spend <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> education <b>time</b> on their respective religions while the municipal schools have a more comprehensive education. Regarding the treatment of the students I could not find any differences since all of the schools gave the students space to express their opinions and thoughts. However there are clear differences when it comes to understand others’ opinions and respect other people’s religious views, since the students in the private schools only meet students with the same religion and views; they do not meet other students who do not share their thoughts...|$|R

50|$|Ted Harbert, boss of ABC Entertainment, {{commented that}} Barr {{was excited to}} return for a ninth season, with or without Goodman, which could be about her and her sister, Jackie Harris, as single parents. He {{attempted}} to dismiss the role of Dan, stating that Jackie has <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> screen <b>time</b> than he does. Los Angeles Daily News editor Phil Rosenthal criticized Harbert for his comments, describing Dan as the emotional anchor of the series. Rosenthal compared Dan to daughter Becky Conner, who was portrayed by two different actresses due to scheduling conflicts over the years, and son D.J. Conner, who was portrayed by a different actor in the pilot {{than the one in}} later episodes. He called Metcalf a wonderful actress, but added that Dan's love for his wife showed viewers that she could be lovable despite her abrasiveness, similarly to Edith Bunker and Archie Bunker in All in the Family. Rosenthal brought up similar departures that caused their respective programs to slip in quality, and warned that Roseanne may suffer the same fate if Goodman left. In the end, Goodman signed on for one more season.|$|R
5000|$|The {{script was}} {{originally}} called The Looters and Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale wrote {{it in the}} 1970s. Years later, Neil Canton showed it to director Walter Hill. Hill says he liked the script [...] "enormously":I was quite surprised because it’s certainly {{not the kind of}} story that Zemeckis and Gale identified with... but I thought it was enormously primal, elemental, brutal, and a great confrontation. It was totally dependent upon the narrative circumstances to reveal character and of course it took place in a time compression—both are things I’m very fond of.Hill was a writer and tended to work on the scripts of all his films:I don’t think the script changed all that much, to tell you the truth. Although there’s certainly no scene in the movie that wasn’t rewritten many times. The script evolved because of certain location problems and we worked out a new ending. The only thing that is significantly different from the script is that the film gives <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> screen <b>time</b> to King James and his gang and the ending is quite a bit different from the original."I wanted to make a down-and-dirty thriller," [...] said Hill. [...] "I wanted to shoot it in a fast, hard style. I wanted to work off the cuff, making it all happen right there." ...|$|R
2500|$|The album's sound {{has been}} {{described}} as emo pop, pop, pop rock, and power pop. Gaskarth felt the album was [...] "more of a pop-rock/alt-rock album for us.

But this album was an effort to develop our sound and hone in [...] on great songwriting rather than conform to the boundaries of a certain genre." [...] Gaskarth mentioned that they [...] "took influence from our older stuff in some of the songs, but in others we went in a new direction, whether that was poppier or more rock or just weird." [...] Gaskarth added that [...] "We stripped <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of the bells and whistles out this time and I think the songs are better off for it." [...] Barakat said the album was [...] "a good mix of faster type typical ATL songs and also some slow ballad type songs." [...] He added [...] "there are <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of pop songs, as well as <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> rock songs. There isn’t a mix of the two.
