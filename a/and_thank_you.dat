500|$|Also in 2008, Eckhart {{portrayed the}} comic book {{character}} Harvey Dent in Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight, the sequel to the 2005 film Batman Begins. Nolan's decision to cast Eckhart was based on his portrayal of corrupt characters in the films In the Company of Men, The Black Dahlia, <b>and</b> <b>Thank</b> <b>You</b> For Smoking. He noted in his depiction of the character that [...] " [...] is still true to himself. He's a crime fighter, he's not killing good people. He's not a bad guy, not purely", while admitting [...] "I'm interested in good guys gone wrong." [...] The Dark Knight was a big financial and critical success, setting a new opening weekend box office record for North America. With revenue of $1billion worldwide, it became the fourth highest-grossing film of all time, and the highest-grossing film of Eckhart's career. Roger Ebert opined that Eckhart did an [...] "especially good job" [...] as his character in the feature, while Premiere magazine also enjoyed his performance, noting that he [...] "makes you believe in his ill-fated ambition... of morphing into the conniving Two-Face." ...|$|E

500|$|Throughout January 1944, No. 450 Squadron {{undertook}} anti-shipping {{operations as}} well as ground support tasks. It flew missions against targets off Dalmatia and in the harbour at Sibenik, {{as well as}} around the ports of Velaluka and Zera. In March, the squadron's attention returned to Italy, launching strikes against rolling stock; the following month saw it heavily tasked, flying a total of 430 sorties. On 29 April 1944, a USAAF Republic P-47 Thunderbolt pilot strafed Cutella by mistake. No. 450 Squadron suffered no fatalities or aircraft destroyed but the pilot of a float plane belonging to an air-sea rescue unit was killed, some ground personnel were wounded, a Kittyhawk of No. 3 Squadron was destroyed and several others were damaged. The following month, No. 450 Squadron moved to San Angelo, mounting a series of attacks against a 200-vehicle convoy near Subiaco in concert with other Kittyhawk squadrons that claimed 123 vehicles destroyed or damaged. No. 450 Squadron later operated from several airfields in central and northern Italy, under the [...] "cab rank" [...] system, whereby patrolling fighter-bombers would attack as requested by army air liaison officers. It flew over 1,100 sorties in June and July. The Australian Kittyhawk units were regularly lauded for the accuracy of their assaults; following a mission by No. 450 Squadron on 12 July, the Eighth Army wired No. 239 Wing headquarters: [...] "Excellent bombing. Good show <b>and</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you.</b> No further attacks required." ...|$|E

His Westerns had a great influence on me, as I think they had on everybody. When I worked with Sergio Leone years ago in Italy, his favorite Director was John Ford and he spoke very openly about that influence. I want to thank everybody who is here from the Irish Academy, the John Ford family <b>and</b> <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> to John Ford Ireland." ...|$|E

2500|$|The band {{joined with}} long-time Hüsker Dü sound {{engineer}} Lou Giordano to record The Rising Tide, released in June 2000. The band had {{high expectations for}} the release, and subsequently undertook a lengthy US tour. At {{the end of the}} tour, the band expressed its desire to finally reach out to its European fans by undertaking its first overseas tour. However, {{on the eve of the}} tour, Time Bomb pulled its tour funding, claiming that they simply could not afford to support the band overseas. It turned out that the label had invested a substantial amount of money in supporting Peter Searcy's Could You Please <b>and</b> <b>Thank</b> <b>You,</b> and the album had performed so poorly that the label was almost completely bankrupt. [...] Not only could they not support Sunny Day Real Estate overseas, they could no longer fund the band at all. Some weeks later, the label ceased operations. Disillusioned and disappointed, the band retreated home, and subsequently announced their disbanding.|$|E
