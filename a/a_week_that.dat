5|$|The {{period between}} the Battle of Stillman's Run in May and the raid at Sinsinawa Mound in late June was filled with war-related activity. A series of attacks at Buffalo Grove, the Plum River settlement, Fort Blue Mounds, and the war's most famous incident, the Indian Creek massacre, all took place between mid-May and late June 1832. Two key battles, one at Horseshoe Bend on 16 June and the other at Waddams Grove on 18 June, {{played a role in}} {{changing}} public perception about the militia after its defeat at Stillman's Run. The Battle of Apple River Fort on 24 June marked the end of <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>that</b> was an important turning point for the settlers. The fight was a 45-minute gun battle between defenders garrisoned inside Apple River Fort and Sauk and Fox warriors led by Chief Black Hawk.|$|E
5|$|On 10July, {{the same}} day as Jane's proclamation, a letter from Mary Tudor arrived in London, saying that she was now queen and {{demanding}} the obedience of the Council. Mary was assembling her supporters in East Anglia; it was decided to take the field against her after some discussion over who should go, in which Jane made sure that her father should not. The Duke of Northumberland marched to Cambridge with his troops and passed <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>that</b> saw no action, until he heard on 20July that the Council in London had declared for Mary. Northumberland now proclaimed Mary Tudor himself at the market-place and was arrested the next morning. On 19July, a few hours before Queen Mary I's proclamation in London, the baptism of one of the Gentlemen Pensioners' children took place. Jane had agreed to be the godmother and wished the child's name to be Guildford. The Bishop of Winchester, Stephen Gardiner, who had been imprisoned in the Tower for five years, took great offence at this fact as he heard of it.|$|E

The performer was expected to return to the show.|$|E
25|$|Dijkstra joined Burroughs Corporation, {{a company}} known {{at that time}} for the {{production}} of computers based on an innovative hardware architecture, as its Research Fellow in August 1973. His duties consisted of visiting some of the company's research centers a few times a year and carrying on his own research, which he did in the smallest Burroughs research facility, namely, his study {{on the second floor of}} his house in Nuenen. In fact, Dijkstra was the only research fellow of Burroughs Corporation and worked for it from home, occasionally travelling to its branches in the United States. As a result, he reduced his appointment at the university to one day <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> <b>That</b> day, Tuesday, soon became known as the day of the famous 'Tuesday Afternoon Club', a seminar during which he discussed with his colleagues scientific articles, looking at all aspects – notation, organisation, presentation, language, content, etc. Shortly after he moved in 1984 to the University of Texas at Austin (USA), a new 'branch' of the Tuesday Afternoon Club emerged in Austin.|$|E

500|$|They passed <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>that</b> saw {{no action}} in Cambridge and Bury St Edmunds, hearing on 20 July that the Council in London had {{declared}} for Mary. Staying at Cambridge, Northumberland himself proclaimed Mary Tudor as queen {{at the market}} place. Warwick was {{with him as he}} threw up his cap and [...] "so laughed that the tears ran down his cheeks for grief." [...] The city that had welcomed the Duke splendidly was nervous to please the new queen. A large group of townsmen and university scholars surrounded King's College to arrest the Duke, who was with his son lodged on the premises. In contrast to his father, Warwick resisted arrest. A letter from the Council arrived that everyman could go his way, so the Duke asked to be set free, [...] "and so continued they all night [...] ". At dawn the Earl of Warwick [...] "was booted ready to have ridden in the morning", and escape. It was too late, however, as the Earl of Arundel arrived to again arrest the Duke and his entourage. The prisoners returned riding side by side through London, the guards having difficulties protecting them against the hostile populace.|$|E
