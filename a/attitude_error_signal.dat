The controller is adapted to control an attitude of a vehicle carrying an actuator system that is adapted to pulse in metered bursts in order to generate a control torque to control {{the attitude of the}} vehicle in response to a control pulse. The noise screen device is adapted to generate a noise screen signal in response to the control pulse that is generated when an input <b>attitude</b> <b>error</b> <b>signal</b> exceeds a predetermined deadband attitude level. The noise screen signal comprises a decaying offset signal that when combined with the attitude error input signal results in a net attitude error input signal away from the predetermined deadband level to reduce further control pulse generation...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} of six selected control moment gyro steering laws {{for use on}} the HEAO spacecraft is reported. Basic equations are developed to project the momentum and torque of four skewed, single gimbal CMGs into vehicle coordinates. In response to the spacecraft <b>attitude</b> <b>error</b> <b>signal,</b> six algorithms are derived for controlling the CMG gimbal movements. HEAO performance data are obtained using each steering law and compared {{on the basis of}} such factors as accuracy, complexity, singularities, gyro hang-up and failure adaption. Moreover, each law is simulated with and without a magnetic momentum management system. The performance of any steering law is enhanced by the magnetic system. Without magnetics, the gimbal angles get large and there are significant differences in steering law performances due to cross coupling and nonlinearities.

40|$|AbstractThere are two {{attitude}} estimation algorithms {{based on}} the different representations of <b>attitude</b> <b>errors</b> when modified Rodrigues parameters are applied to attitude estimation. The first is multiplicative <b>error</b> <b>attitude</b> estimator (MEAE), whose <b>attitude</b> <b>error</b> is expressed by the modified Rodrigues parameters representing the rotation from the estimated to the true attitude. The second is subtractive <b>error</b> <b>attitude</b> estimator (SEAE), whose <b>attitude</b> <b>error</b> is expressed by the arithmetic difference between the true and the estimated attitudes. It is proved that the two algorithms are equivalent {{in the case of}} small <b>attitude</b> <b>errors.</b> It is possible to describe rotation without encountering singularity by switching between the modified Rodrigues parameters and their shadow parameters. The attitude parameter switching does not bring disturbance to MEAE, but it does to SEAE. This article introduces a modification to eliminate the disturbance on SEAE, and simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the presented algorithm...|$|R
40|$|The in-motion {{alignment}} of a SINS/GPS integrated system uses the GPS velocity and position as observations, hence the SINS position and velocity errors are instantaneously observable. However the <b>attitude</b> <b>error</b> {{is not directly}} observable, {{it is important to}} find a way to improve the observability of <b>attitude</b> <b>error</b> because the degree-ofobservability of the <b>attitude</b> <b>error</b> affects the accuracy of alignment. In this paper, the singular value decomposition (SVD) method is used to analyze the degree-of-observability of SINS/GPS during in-motion alignment. Simulations involving nine typical maneuvers indicate that both the yaw-axis rotation and the accelerated motion can improve the degree-ofobservability of <b>attitude</b> <b>error.</b> Of the nine types of maneuvers, the triaxial rotation with acceleration is the most effective maneuver for improving the degree-of-observability of a SINS/GPS integrated system...|$|R

Testing provides a means to numerically quantify system performance, give confidence in the models and methods, and also discover and compensate for unexpected behaviours and interactions with the attitude determination system. The usefulness of the test results is dependent on {{an understanding of the}} uncertainties that contribute to the <b>attitude</b> <b>error.</b> With this understanding, the significance of the results can be assessed, and efforts to reduce <b>attitude</b> <b>errors</b> can be directed appropriately. The work of this thesis is to gain a quantitative understanding of the uncertainties that impact the <b>attitude</b> <b>error</b> of low cost spinning spacecraft using COTS camera (as Sun sensor) and MEMS magnetometer. The sensors were calibrated and the uncertainties in these calibrations were quantified, then propagated through the Triad method to uncertainties in the attitude. It was found that most systematic errors were reduced to negligible levels, except those due to timing latencies. <b>Attitude</b> <b>errors</b> achieved in the laboratory with the experimental setup were around 0. 14 degrees (3 σ) using either the Triad, q-method or Extended Kalman Filter with a gyro for dynamic model replacement. The errors in laboratory were dominated by magnetometer noise. Furthermore, correlated systematic errors had the effect of reducing the <b>attitude</b> <b>error</b> calculated in the laboratory. For an equivalent Sun-mag geometry in orbit, simulation showed that total <b>attitude</b> <b>error</b> would be of the order of 0. 77 degrees (3 σ). An uncertainty contribution analysis revealed this error was dominated by uncertainties in the inertial magnetic field model. Uncertainties in knowledge of the inertial Sun model, sensor calibration, sensor alignment and sensor noise were shown to be insignificant in comparison...|$|R

30|$|Given the SQAM waveforms, we also derived some test audio {{files for}} {{illustrating}} some interesting {{aspects of the}} proposed modeling approach. One subject of interest {{is to show that}} the residual signal of the reference channel is needed for good-quality synthesis, as opposed to using a synthetic <b>error</b> <b>signal</b> such as white noise or a randomly chosen segment from the actual <b>error</b> <b>signal</b> of the target signal. As is true for speech signals as well, white noise cannot be used as an <b>error</b> <b>signal</b> for synthesizing high-quality audio signals. In fact, in speech processing the problem of producing the best model <b>error</b> <b>signal</b> for achieving best audio quality has been an important issue both in text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) and speech coding alike. This problem is even more important in music applications as the one examined in the text, where quality is of extreme importance. It is thus necessary to note the fact that using white noise as model error, even with the correct energy scaling for each time frame, will not produce high-quality synthesis in our application, nor in speech synthesis and coding. The same is true for more carefully designed synthetic <b>error</b> <b>signals</b> (e.g., for speech an impulse train can be generated based on the estimated pitch, although this in practice is not possible for polyphonic music). The reason is that the whitening process is not perfect and important information remains in the <b>error</b> <b>signal.</b> This information cannot be approximated by white noise or any other synthetic signal but can be approximated by a similar <b>error</b> <b>signal</b> (obtained from the reference signal). The general practice in the speech processing domain is to use the error from actually recorded speech signals (e.g., phonemes, as in concatenative speech synthesis). Similarly in our case, the <b>error</b> <b>signal</b> is not synthesized but it is obtained from actually recorded signals (the reference recording), and this is possible only for the case that we examine here, that is, for various spot signals of a multichannel recording, which have similar content. If the various spot signals were not correlated, the proposed method would fail (unless a downmix signal was derived as a reference signal), since the model <b>error</b> <b>signals</b> must be very similar in order to use one <b>error</b> <b>signal</b> for synthesizing all spot signals.|$|R
