50|$|Tongue-and-groove pliers—also {{known as}} water pump pliers, <b>adjustable</b> <b>pliers,</b> groove-joint pliers, arc-joint pliers, Multi-Grips, tap or pipe spanners, gland pliers and Channellocks—are {{a type of}} {{slip-joint}} pliers. They have serrated jaws generally set 45 to 60 degrees from the handles. The lower jaw can be moved {{to a number of}} positions by sliding along a tracking section under the upper jaw. An advantage of this design is that the pliers can adjust to a number of sizes without the distance in the handle growing wider. These pliers often have long handles—commonly 9.5 to 12 inches long—for increased leverage.|$|E
