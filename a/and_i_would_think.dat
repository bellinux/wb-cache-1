[...] "When I first started covering the West Bank for Haaretz, I was young and brainwashed," [...] {{he said in an}} interview. [...] "I would see settlers cutting down olive trees and soldiers mistreating Palestinian women at the checkpoints, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>think,</b> 'These are exceptions, not part of government policy.' It {{took me a long time}} to see that these were not exceptions – they were the substance of government policy." ...|$|E

[...] "Ye see, I stand well {{in with my}} colonel, Count Drummond-Melfort; and, what's mair to the purpose, I have {{a cousin}} of mine {{lieutenant-colonel}} in a regiment of the Scots-Dutch. Naething could be mair proper than what I would get a leave to see Lieutenant-Colonel Stewart of Halkett's.

60|$|And all {{the while}} I was aware that this life of sea-bathing and sun-burning was for me but a holiday. In that year cannon were roaring for days {{together}} on French battle-fields; and I would sit in my isle (I call it mine, after the use of lovers) and think upon the war, and the loudness of these far-away battles, and {{the pain of the}} men's wounds, and the weariness of their marching. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> too of that other war which is as old as mankind, and is indeed the life of man; the unsparing war, the grinding slavery of competition; the toil of seventy years, dear-bought bread, precarious honour, the perils and pitfalls, and the poor rewards. It was a long look forward; the future summoned me as with trumpet calls, it warned me back as with a voice of weeping and beseeching; and I thrilled and trembled on the brink of life, like a childish bather on the beach.|$|E

60|$|I {{have put}} into this book[5] only those {{passages}} from Spenser that I {{want to remember}} and carry about with me. I have not tried to select what people call characteristic passages, for that is, I think, the {{way to make a}} dull book. One never really knows anybody's taste but one's own, and if one likes anything sincerely one may be certain that there are other people made out of the same earth to like it too. I have taken out of The Shepheards Calender only those parts which are about love or about old age, and I have taken out of the Faerie Queene passages about shepherds and lovers, and fauns and satyrs, and a few allegorical processions. I find that though I love symbolism, which is often the only fitting speech for some mystery of disembodied life, I am for the most part bored by allegory, which is made, as Blake says, 'by the daughters of memory,' and coldly, with no wizard frenzy. The processions I have chosen are either those, like the House of Mammon, that have enough ancient mythology, always an implicit symbolism, or, like the Cave of Despair, enough sheer passion to make one forget or forgive their allegory, or else they are, like that vision of Scudamour, so visionary, so full of a sort of ghostly midnight animation, that one is persuaded that they had some strange purpose and did truly appear in just that way to some mind worn out with war and trouble. The vision of Scudamour is, I sometimes think, the finest invention in Spenser. Until quite lately I knew nothing of Spenser but the parts I had read as a boy. I did not know that I had read so far as that vision, but year after year this thought would rise up before me coming from I knew not where. I would be alone perhaps in some old building, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> suddenly 'out of that door might come a procession of strange people doing mysterious things with tumult. They would walk over the stone floor, then suddenly vanish, and everything would become silent again.' Once I saw what is called, I think, a Board School continuation class play Hamlet. There was no stage, but they walked in procession into the midst of a large room full of visitors and of their friends. While they were walking in, that thought came to me again from I knew not where. I was alone in a great church watching ghostly kings and queens setting out upon their unearthly business.|$|E

She has opposed a guest worker program, saying {{that the idea of}} guest: [...] "connotates 'invite, come,' and, at the same time, it misleads because you ask people to come for a temporary job of three to six years and they have to leave if they don't have another job <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> that they would not." ...|$|E

In 2008, Uddin appeared in the BBC soap opera EastEnders as Jalil Iqbal, a love interest for Shabnam Masood (Zahra Ahmadi). His character first appears on 17 March and departs on 28 March. Uddin states: “I used {{to come to work}} and have crumpets with Barbara Windsor every morning which was brilliant as I used to have a crush on her too, I was all coy and pretended to be all harmless and she would pinch my cheeks <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> ‘yeah, go on!’ ...|$|E

The two teams {{actually}} get on very well which is why I've been so shocked by the whole situation. There were a lot of contentious decisions, but the way I was brought up in the game you've got to accept the umpire's decision whether you agree with it or not and it takes a discipline to accept the decision and walk off without showing dissent. I hope Ricky and Anil Kumblecan get together or the Australian and Indian management can get together and sort something out. I hope that we can work through this and get to Perth. For me it's been hard, uncompromising, tough Test cricket - some of the toughest Test cricket I've faced in my career. Michael Hussey - Australian cricketer ...|$|E
5000|$|Three {{weeks after}} her defeat at the Curragh, Found {{was sent to}} France for the Group One Prix Marcel Boussac over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. Ridden by Ryan Moore she was made the 9/4 {{favourite}} against eleven opponents. Her main opponents {{appeared to be the}} Prix de Cabourg winner Ervedya from France, the Silver Flash Stakes winner Jack Naylor (a filly despite her masculine name) from Ireland and the Prestige Stakes winner Malabar from England, whilst the other runners included Shahah (Prix d'Aumale) and Queen Bee (Prix du Calvados). Found started well but was settled in mid-division as first Ervedya, then Thank You Bye Bye set the pace. Ervedya regained the lead in the straight but Moore produced Found with a strong late run to overtake the French filly 100 metres from the finish before drawing away to win by two and a half lengths. Jack Naylor took third ahead of Malabar and Queen Bee. After the race, O'Brien said of the winner [...] "She is a lovely big filly, with a temperament to match, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> she will have no trouble getting a mile and a quarter and maybe a mile and a half, as she is by Galileo. Along with that she has plenty of natural pace, certainly enough to be a Guineas filly... She's a very exciting filly" ...|$|E
5000|$|On March 31, 2016, Beyoncé officially {{launched}} Ivy Park {{by revealing}} two covers for the May issue of Elle magazine. The issue includes an in-depth interview where Beyoncé explains her objectives for the brand {{and its impact}} on women. She said that her goal with the line is to [...] "push the boundaries of athletic wear and to support and inspire women who understand that beauty is more than your physical appearance". That same day, Beyoncé also released a promotional video, titled [...] "Where is your park" [...] that gives viewers a glimpse of her workout routine, samples of the clothing line and a narration explaining the origin and significance of the brand and its name; Ivy, representing her daughter who is named Blue Ivy Carter, and Park, representing Parkwood Park in Houston where Beyoncé used to go to exercise and find personal strength. She elaborated in the video,I would wake up in the morning, and my dad would come knocking at my door, telling me it's time to go running. I remember wanting to stop, but I would push myself to keep going. It taught me discipline. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> about my dreams. I would think about the sacrifices my parents made for me. I would think about my little sister and how I was her hero. I would look at the beauty around me, the sun shining through the trees. I would keep breathing. There are things I'm still afraid of. When I have to conquer those things, I still go back to that park. Before I hit the stage, I go back to that park. When {{it was time for me}} to give birth, I went back to that park. The park became a state of mind. The park became my strength. The park is what made me who I am.
