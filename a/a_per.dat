5|$|Neon is the second-lightest noble gas, after helium. It glows reddish-orange in {{a vacuum}} {{discharge}} tube.

It has over 40 times the refrigerating capacity of liquid helium and three times that of liquid hydrogen (on <b>a</b> <b>per</b> unit volume basis). In most applications it is a less expensive refrigerant than helium.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{new ideas}} about the {{treatment}} of alcoholism, the lifetime suspension was downgraded to a 10-year suspension in 1952. DUI prosecutions remained difficult in cases when drivers refused to take a Breathalyzer test, and so in 1966, the state authorized the suspension of a person's driver's license for refusing to submit a breath sample. In 1977, the BAC limit was reduced to 0.10%, but the law was modified to differentiate between {{the second and third}} offenses, with lesser penalties for first and second convictions. In 1983, the state established <b>a</b> <b>per</b> se rule wherein a person over the limit was considered drunk in all cases (that is, not merely a presumption). Nine years later, the 0.01% BAC limit for drivers under 21 was instituted, and in 2003, the 0.10% BAC limit was reduced to 0.08% to comply with federal highway funding requirements.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the limited}} {{resources}} of many developing nations, funding vitally effects how emergency medicine {{fits into the}} health system. Preventive care is {{a crucial part of}} healthcare in developing countries, and {{it may be difficult to}} budget for emergency medicine without cutting into those resources. This is a particular problem for poorer nations such as Zambia, which had <b>a</b> <b>per</b> capita health expenditure of 23 US dollars in 2003. Regardless of the amount of preventive care available, health problems requiring immediate attention will still occur, and emergency medical programs could increase access to care. Kobusingye et al. argue that expanding emergency medicine does not need to be unreasonably expensive, particularly if developing countries focus on low-cost but effective treatments administered by first responders.|$|E

5|$|Implementation of the Bland–Allison Act {{did not end}} {{calls for}} free silver. The 1880s saw a steep decline in the prices of grain and other {{agricultural}} commodities. Silver advocates argued that this dropoff, which caused the price of grain to fall below its cost of production, {{was caused by the}} failure of the government to adequately increase the money supply, which had remained steady on <b>a</b> <b>per</b> capita basis. Advocates of the gold standard attributed the decline to advances in production and transportation. The late 19th century saw divergent views in economics as the laissez-faire orthodoxy was questioned by younger economists, and both sides found ample support for their views from theorists.|$|E
5|$|In a 5–4 opinion, the Court {{held that}} forced {{extraction}} {{and analysis of}} a blood sample is not compelled testimony; therefore, it does not violate the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The Court also held that intrusions into the human body ordinarily require a search warrant. However, the Court ruled that the involuntary, warrantless blood sample taken {{in this case was}} justified under the Fourth Amendment's exigent circumstances exception because evidence of blood alcohol would be destroyed by the body's natural metabolic processes if the officers were to wait for a warrant. In 2013, the Supreme Court clarified in Missouri v. McNeely that the natural metabolism of alcohol in the bloodstream is not <b>a</b> <b>per</b> se exigency that would always justify warrantless blood tests of individuals suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol.|$|E

5|$|Maintaining an {{affordable}} food {{supply to the}} city of Rome had become a major political issue in the late Republic, when the state began to provide a grain dole (annona) to citizens who registered for it. About 200,000–250,000 adult males in Rome received the dole, amounting to about 33kg. per month, for <b>a</b> <b>per</b> annum total of about 100,000 tons of wheat primarily from Sicily, north Africa, and Egypt. The dole cost at least 15% of state revenues, but improved living conditions and family life among the lower classes, and subsidized the rich by allowing workers to spend more of their earnings on the wine and olive oil produced on the estates of the landowning class.|$|E
5|$|With {{the move}} of the {{majority}} of the AIF to France, the base organisation was transferred to the United Kingdom. Most of the training units moved to the Salisbury Plain, establishing depots at Perham Down, Rollestone, Larkhill and Tidworth. When it arrived, the 3rd Division also moved into camps in this area. Command Depots, where men returning from hospitals were sent before being returned to their units, were established at Perham Down, Weymouth, Wool, Dorset and Worgret. Depots for men moving from the United Kingdom to France were established at Étaples. In June 1917, these were swapped with the Canadians for depots around Le Havre, thereby reducing travelling time from the Salisbury Plain. AIF Headquarters was established at Horseferry Road in London and Colonel R. M. McC. Anderson, a businessman, was appointed as its commandant.

5|$|In 1958, {{the leader}} of the North Carolina branch of the CPUSA, Junius Scales, became the final CPUSA member convicted under the Smith Act, and the only one convicted after the Yates decision. Prosecutors pursued Scales' case because he {{specifically}} advocated violent political action and gave demonstrations of martial arts skills. Scales was accused of violating the membership clause of the Smith Act, not the clause prohibiting advocacy of violence against the government. In his appeal to the Supreme Court, Scales contended that the 1950 McCarran Internal Security Act rendered the Smith Act's membership clause ineffective, because the McCarran Act explicitly stated that membership in a communist party does not constitute <b>a</b> <b>per</b> se violation of any criminal statute. In 1961, the Supreme Court, in a 5–4 decision, upheld Scales' conviction, finding that the Smith Act membership clause was not obviated by the McCarran Act, because the Smith Act required prosecutors to prove first, that there was direct advocacy of violence; and second, that the defendant's membership was substantial and active, not merely passive or technical. Two Justices of the Supreme Court who had supported the Yates decision in 1957, Harlan and Frankfurter, voted to uphold Scales' conviction.|$|E
