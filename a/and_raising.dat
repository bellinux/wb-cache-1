5|$|During {{the mating}} season rival males may compete by wrestling, not by biting. Opponents attempt to subdue {{each other by}} intertwining their bodies <b>and</b> <b>raising</b> their heads high off the ground. Observers have on {{occasion}} mistaken such wrestling for mating.|$|E
5|$|Mole crickets live {{almost entirely}} below ground, digging tunnels of {{different}} kinds for the major functions of life, including feeding, escape from predators, attracting a mate (by singing), mating, <b>and</b> <b>raising</b> of young.|$|E

5|$|The British were {{welcomed by}} the {{remaining}} New York City population, pulling down the Continental Army flag <b>and</b> <b>raising</b> the Union Flag. Howe, who {{had wanted to}} capture New York quickly and with minimal bloodshed, considered the invasion a complete success. Not wanting to continue battling with the Americans that day, Howe stopped his troops short of Harlem.|$|E
5|$|A small species, the Inaccessible Island rail has brown plumage {{and a black}} {{bill and}} feet. It {{occupies}} most habitats on Inaccessible Island, from the beaches to the central plateau, feeding {{on a variety of}} small invertebrates and also some plant matter. Pairs are territorial and monogamous, with both parents being responsible for incubating the eggs <b>and</b> <b>raising</b> the chicks. Its adaptations to living on a tiny island at high densities include low base metabolic rates, small clutch sizes, and flightlessness.|$|E

5|$|After World War II, {{industrial}} development quickened. New technology increased farm productivity through automation of feedlots for hogs and cattle, machine milking at dairy farms, <b>and</b> <b>raising</b> chickens in large buildings. Planting became more specialized with hybridization {{of corn and}} wheat, {{and the use of}} farm machinery such as tractors and combines became the norm. University of Minnesota professor Norman Borlaug contributed to these developments as part of the Green Revolution. Suburban development accelerated due to increased postwar housing demand and convenient transportation. Increased mobility, in turn, enabled more specialized jobs.|$|E
5|$|After the {{declaration}} of war, Barkley supported bills implementing conscription <b>and</b> <b>raising</b> revenue for the fight. Between August and October 1918, he joined an unofficial congressional delegation that toured Europe, surveying the tactical situation and meeting with leaders there. Like Wilson, he supported U.S. ratification of the Treaty of Versailles and participation in the League of Nations, but both measures failed after {{the election of a}} more conservative Congress in 1918.|$|E
5|$|At nest sites, battles {{sometimes}} {{occur between}} {{two or more}} pairs before the original owners declare themselves {{as the owner of}} the nest. Red-billed tropicbirds are aggressive at nest sites, fighting with each other and ousting species such as shearwaters, petrels, and white-tailed tropicbirds. They have also been recorded taking over nests of white-tailed tropicbirds <b>and</b> <b>raising</b> their young if they failed to destroy their eggs. Vagrant red-billed tropicbirds have been implicated in egg loss in red-tailed tropicbird nests in Hawaii.|$|E

Tyler was a running back for Pasadena City College and San Diego State but was forced {{to give up the}} sport due to multiple sclerosis (MS). He returned to Texas after graduation and divides his time between the family business <b>and</b> <b>raising</b> awareness of MS with his father.|$|E
5|$|Elves {{have few}} children, {{as a rule}} (Fëanor and Nerdanel were an exception, conceiving seven sons), and there are {{relatively}} sizeable intervals between each child (but see below for notes on Elvish birth rates in Middle-earth versus in Aman). They are soon preoccupied with other pleasures; their libido wanes and they focus their interests elsewhere, like the arts. Nonetheless, they take great delight in the union of love, and they cherish the days of bearing <b>and</b> <b>raising</b> children as the happiest days of their lives.|$|E
5|$|Females become {{sexually mature}} at eight months, but mate no earlier than two years. Males mature later, at one-and-a-half years. Mating takes place {{throughout}} the year; peaks occur during {{spring and fall}} in Texas. Two peaks have been observed in India: from August to October and from March to April. Rutting males aggressively establish and defend their territories from other males, giving out loud grunts and engaging in serious head-to-head fights, pushing each other using horns. Aggressive display consists of thrusting the neck forward <b>and</b> <b>raising</b> it, folding the ears <b>and</b> <b>raising</b> the tail. The dominant male pursues the female with his nose pointing upward, smells her urine and shows a flehmen response. The female shows her receptivity by waving her tail and thumping the hindlegs on the ground. This is followed by several mounting attempts, and copulation. The whole process may {{last as long as}} six hours. The female will remain still for some time after copulation, following which she may start grazing. The male may then move on to mate with another female.|$|E

5000|$|Fulda, Ohio is {{noteworthy}} for sporting a few notable descendants. AAGPBL player Betty Jane Cornett (1932-2006) had a paternal grandmother with siblings who immigrated from Germany to the southeastern Ohio area, including Fulda. Cornett herself was born <b>and</b> <b>raised</b> within the Spring Hill, Pennsylvania. Paleoconservative politician Pat Buchanan (born 1938) and his sister, fellow conservative political commentator and United States Treasurer under Ronald Reagan, Angela [...] "Bay" [...] Buchanan (born 1948), had maternal relatives {{who were born}} <b>and</b> <b>raised</b> in Fulda before moving to Finleyville, Pennsylvania. The Buchanans' mother then moved to Washington, D.C., where Pat and [...] "Bay" [...] were born <b>and</b> <b>raised.</b> Singer ("shock rocker"), songwriter, musician, composer, painter, author, and part-time music journalist and actor Brian Hugh Warner, better known by his stage name Marilyn Manson (born 1969), had paternal relatives who were born <b>and</b> <b>raised</b> in Fulda before moving to Louisville, Ohio (Warner/Manson himself was born <b>and</b> <b>raised</b> within nearby Canton, Ohio).|$|R
5|$|Females perform all {{tasks of}} feeding <b>and</b> <b>raising</b> offspring, and have {{occasionally}} been observed caring for orphaned pups. Much {{has been written}} about the level of devotion of sea otter mothers for their pups– a mother gives her infant almost constant attention, cradling it on her chest away from the cold water and attentively grooming its fur. When foraging, she leaves her pup floating on the water, sometimes wrapped in kelp to keep it from floating away; if the pup is not sleeping, it cries loudly until she returns. Mothers have been known to carry their pups for days after the pups' deaths.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the rapid}} secessions of Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas, Congress began {{preparing}} {{the nation for}} war, including by strengthening the army and navy <b>and</b> <b>raising</b> funds for the treasury. Burnett attempted to circumvent these measures by proposing an amendment stipulating {{that none of these}} new appropriations could be used to subdue or make war against any of the southern states, but the amendment was defeated.|$|E
5|$|If a male is interested, he will stretch {{his neck}} and erect his feathers, then bend over and peck at the ground. He will circle around and sidle up to the female, swaying his body and neck from side to side, and rubbing his breast against his partner's rump. Often the female will reject his {{advances}} with aggression, but if amenable, she signals acceptance by squatting down <b>and</b> <b>raising</b> her rump.|$|E

5|$|In summer 969, Sviatoslav left Rus' again, {{dividing}} his dominion {{into three}} parts, each under a nominal rule {{of one of}} his sons. At the head of an army that included Pecheneg and Magyar auxiliary troops, he invaded Bulgaria again, devastating Thrace, capturing the city of Philippopolis, and massacring its inhabitants. Nikephoros responded by repairing the defenses of Constantinople <b>and</b> <b>raising</b> new squadrons of armored cavalry. In the midst of his preparations, Nikephoros was overthrown and killed by John Tzimiskes, who thus became the new Byzantine emperor.|$|E
