5|$|I was {{of course}} happy to meet the Hizbullah people, {{because it is a}} point of view that is rarely heard in the United States. I have no problem saying that I do want to express {{solidarity}} with them, and I am {{not going to be a}} coward of (sic) a hypocrite about it. I don't care about Hizbullah as a political organization. I don't know much about their politics, and anyhow, it's irrelevant. I don't live in Lebanon. It's <b>a</b> <b>choice</b> <b>that</b> the Lebanese have to make: Who they want to be their leaders, who they want to represent them. But there is a fundamental principle. People have the right to defend their country from foreign occupiers, and people have the right to defend their country from invaders who are destroying their country. That to me is a very basic, elementary and uncomplicated question.|$|E
5|$|On 17 November 1184 Coutances was {{translated}} to {{the diocese of}} Rouen, becoming Archbishop of Rouen. The original election to Rouen {{had taken place in}} the summer. King Henry had initially rejected the Rouen cathedral chapter's nominees and put forward three English bishops as the royal candidates. The king also indicated his preference that Coutances be elected, <b>a</b> <b>choice</b> <b>that</b> was confirmed by the pope in November. Coutances hesitated about the translation to Rouen, as the see there was poorer than Lincoln, but as an archbishopric rather than a bishopric it was of a higher status. The medieval chronicler William of Newburgh wrote that eventually Coutances' ambition overcame his greed, and he agreed to the translation. He was received at Rouen on 3 March 1185. Coutances remained in Henry's service however, and continued attend the royal court frequently. During the final 10years of Henry's reign, only Ranulf de Glanville witnessed more royal charters, and only William de Humez, the constable, equalled the 16charters that Coutances witnessed.|$|E

5|$|The game {{keeps track}} of the player's {{completed}} percentage of the storyline, increased by viewing the scenarios comprising each Episode. If 100% {{of the game is}} completed, an additional ending will be unlocked. The game features a fork in its plot, allowing the player to make <b>a</b> <b>choice</b> <b>that</b> changes what scenes they see and the number of percentage points they acquire afterward. It is impossible to see all of the game's content on a single playthrough, due to this fork in the storyline, although it is possible to achieve 100% storyline completion in a single playthrough. However, a 100% storyline completion can only be achieved through one of the two possible storylines. When the game is completed for the first time, it unlocks a New Game Plus option that allows the player to restart the game with all of the items, Garment Grids, dresspheres and storyline completion percentage achieved previously. However, all character levels are set back to one.|$|E

As so many did, he identified this loyalty with fealty to the Crown in abstraction and to Dom Pedro personally." [...] He was <b>a</b> <b>choice</b> <b>that</b> could please all sides. Caxias, said Needell, [...] "was not so much a political man as a man profoundly loyal to the Monarchy with which he ... had come to identify with the Conservative Party.

500|$|Waxy (1790 – 18 April 1818) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse {{that won}} the 1793 Epsom Derby and was an {{influential}} sire {{in the late eighteenth}} and early part of the nineteenth century. Waxy was bred by Sir Ferdinando Poole and was foaled at Lewes in 1790. He was sired by Pot-8-Os, a son of the foundation stallion Eclipse, whose genetic lineage traced to the Darley Arabian. Waxy's dam, Maria, was sired by the influential stallion Herod and produced one full-brother to Waxy, who was named Worthy. [...] Waxy derived his name from a variety of potato, <b>a</b> <b>choice</b> <b>that</b> was inspired by his sire's name. Trained by Robert Robson, Waxy won nine races out of 15 starts during his four-year racing career, retiring from racing at the age of seven in 1797 after sustaining an injury during his last start.|$|E

Aside from the well-received lead single, [...] "You", the album offered {{little in the way}} of [...] "hook-laden potential hit", author Bruce Spizer writes, leading to [...] "This Guitar" [...] being chosen as the follow-up single. Apple issued the single on 8 December in America, with the Apple catalogue number 1885. For this release, the song was edited down to a running time of 3:49, by fading out early during the closing solo. The B-side was the Dark Horse track [...] "Māya Love", <b>a</b> <b>choice</b> <b>that</b> underlined the paucity of radio-friendly selections on Extra Texture, according to Spizer. The single's UK release (as Apple R 6012) was delayed until 6 February 1976.|$|E

500|$|Writing for Screen Rant, Alex Leadbeater felt, {{regardless}} of the short's connections to Logan and Deadpool 2, it [...] "ultimately is a good slice of Deadpool fun." [...] Leadbeater also praised the alternate online release, as pirated versions of the theatrical showings had already appeared online and the extra scenes in the official online version were incentive for fans to watch the official release over the illegal ones. Trent Moore of Blastr called the short [...] "a fun little scene", and said that Leitch [...] "certainly {{seems to have a}} solid grasp of the irreverent tone that makes the character work so well." [...] Jacob Hall at /Film said the short was a [...] "fun little surprise" [...] and compared it to Marvel Studios' Marvel One-Shots. He added that there is [...] "not much to judge quite yet, but [...] does showcase a strong eye for comedy" [...] in the footage, and particularly noted the [...] "ridiculously depressing and dilapidated" [...] setting. Corey Chichizola of CinemaBlend said the short is [...] "certainly cool enough to the wet the palate for any X-Men fans", and particularly noted the [...] "strong blue tint, which is in stark juxtaposition to the very bright and yellow world of Deadpool.

500|$|Writing for Variety, Justin Chang said: [...] "One of the film's more {{remarkable}} achievements is that, despite their obvious differences {{in class and}} background, Therese and Carol seem to ease themselves (and the audience) so quickly and naturally into a bond {{that they have no}} interest in defining, or even really discussing — <b>a</b> <b>choice</b> <b>that</b> works not only for an era when their love dared not speak its name, but also for Haynes’ faith {{in the power of the}} medium to achieve an eloquence beyond words." [...] Francine Prose wrote in The New York Review of Books: [...] "Among the virtues of Todd Haynes's new film, Carol, is the delicacy, the patience, and the sheer amount of screen time that it lavishes on the experience of falling in love: the hesitations and doubts, the seemingly casual exchanges freighted with meaning and suppressed emotion, the simple happiness of being together." [...] Anita Katz from The San Francisco Examiner said: [...] "Haynes triumphs in his quest to make a sweeping romantic melodrama with social substance at the core. As a period piece, the movie immerses us in 1950s styles and attitudes. As a sensory experience, it dazzles with everything from rain-streaked windows to Therese’s plaid tam-o-shanter ... Haynes powerfully addresses the consequences of ignorance and intolerance. Impressively textured, the drama is filled with secret glances and other subtle aspects of forbidden love." [...] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post wrote: [...] "Carol" [...] is a performance of a performance, whereby codes and signals convey the most essential stuff of life, while the kabuki of being [...] "normal" [...] plays out with the carefully cultivated — and patently false — perfection of the toy train village Carol buys from Therese at their first meeting. Working from a carefully crafted script by Phyllis Nagy, Haynes portrays two people thirstily drinking each other in, while on the outside, they sip tea and cocktails with prim decorum." [...] Naming it [...] "one of the year's very best films", Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said: [...] "Camera virtuoso Edward Lachman finds visual poetry in the hothouse eroticism that envelops Carol and Therese, an amateur photographer who keeps framing Carol in her lens. Blanchett, a dream walking in Sandy Powell's frocks, delivers a master class in acting. And Mara is flawless ... Haynes' commitment to outcasts, then and now, makes Carol a romantic spellbinder that cuts deep." ...|$|E
