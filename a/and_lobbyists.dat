5|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to the September 27, 1962, publication, there was strong {{opposition}} to Silent Spring from the chemical industry. DuPont (a main manufacturer of DDT and 2,4-D) and Velsicol Chemical Company (exclusive manufacturer of chlordane and heptachlor) were among the first to respond. DuPont compiled an extensive report on the book's press coverage and estimated impact on public opinion. Velsicol threatened legal action against Houghton Mifflin as well as The New Yorker and Audubon unless the planned Silent Spring features were canceled. Chemical industry representatives <b>and</b> <b>lobbyists</b> also lodged a range of non-specific complaints, some anonymously. Chemical companies and associated organizations produced a number of their own brochures and articles promoting and defending pesticide use. However, Carson's and the publishers' lawyers were confident in the vetting process Silent Spring had undergone. The magazine and book publications proceeded as planned, as did the large Book-of-the-Month printing (which included a pamphlet endorsing the book by William O. Douglas).|$|E

25|$|Abramoff {{arranged}} for mailings from a Ralph Reed marketing company to Christian conservative voters. He bribed Roger Stillwell, a high-ranking political appointee at the Department of the Interior {{who was responsible}} for some Native American gaming policy; Stillwell pleaded guilty in 2006 to accepting gifts from Abramoff. All government officials and employees are prohibited from accepting gifts from consultants, businesses <b>and</b> <b>lobbyists.</b>|$|E

25|$|Rasmussen Reports {{found in}} a late-August survey that a 49% {{plurality}} of Americans believe that protesters genuinely express their own views while 37% consider them to be a creation of special interest groups <b>and</b> <b>lobbyists.</b> An early-August survey stated that 35% viewed the protests unfavorably and 41% viewed them favorably. Both polls showed highly partisan differences in people's view of the town halls.|$|E
25|$|By 1942, about $500,000 {{was coming}} from the syndicate's bookmaking wire {{operations}} each day. In 1946, due to complications with Siegel, the Chicago Outfit took the Continental Press and handed over the operation to Dragna, enraging Siegel. Despite those complications, Siegel controlled several illegal casinos and a major prostitution ring. Siegel maintained close relationships with politicians, businessmen, attorneys, accountants, <b>and</b> <b>lobbyists</b> who fronted for him.|$|E
25|$|Several {{economists and}} {{political}} scientists {{have argued that}} economic inequality translates into political inequality, particularly in situations where politicians have financial incentives to respond to special interest groups <b>and</b> <b>lobbyists.</b> Researchers such as Larry Bartels of Vanderbilt University have shown that politicians are significantly more responsive to the political opinions of the wealthy, even when controlling {{for a range of}} variables including educational attainment and political knowledge.|$|E

25|$|After graduating, Santorum was {{admitted}} to the Pennsylvania bar and practiced law for four years at the Pittsburgh law firm Kirkpatrick & Lockhart, a firm known for raising political candidates <b>and</b> <b>lobbyists</b> (later named K Gates). As an associate, he successfully lobbied on behalf of the World Wrestling Federation to deregulate professional wrestling, arguing that it should be exempt from federal anabolic steroid regulations because it was entertainment, not a sport. Santorum left his private law practice in 1990 after his election to the House of Representatives.|$|E
25|$|Bowser ran {{for reelection}} in 2012. Bowser {{said she would}} not turn down {{donations}} from corporations. Candidate Max Skolnik criticized Bowser for receiving campaign contributions from developers, corporate bundlers, <b>and</b> <b>lobbyists,</b> saying that Bowser would favor the interests of these corporate donors. Bowser said she was {{not in favor of}} banning corporations from making political donations altogether, saying that doing so would {{make it more difficult to}} track where campaign donations come from. She also said that corporations are banned from donating to federal elections, but that corporations still find ways to give to campaigns.|$|E

25|$|Carr {{was elected}} to the Texas House of Representatives from Lubbock District 19 in 1950. During his ensuing ten years of service, he focused on West Texas water quality and availability. Under his leadership, the {{legislature}} proposed a constitutional amendment and passed enabling legislation to establish the Texas Water Development Board. At its creation, the board was authorized to issue up to $200 million in water development bonds for the purpose of funding local water projects. Carr also helped to establish a code of ethics for legislators <b>and</b> <b>lobbyists.</b> He promoted tourism and industrial development.|$|E
25|$|On January 15, 2006, Ney {{resigned}} {{as chairman of}} the House Administration Committee. He maintained that he had done nothing wrong, but had been under increasing pressure to stand down since his ties to Abramoff were an increasing embarrassment in light of Republican plans for reforms of lobbying and campaign finance rules. The House Administration Committee has jurisdiction over elections <b>and</b> <b>lobbyists.</b> House Speaker Dennis Hastert reportedly emailed a Roll Call article regarding Ney's precarious hold on the gavel to several Capitol beat reporters. Ney's resignation was officially temporary. However, even some of his Republican colleagues expected him to be indicted. Under Republican caucus rules, he would have permanently lost his chairmanship if indicted.|$|E
500|$|In Turkey, [...] "many {{believe that}} Armenia's {{territorial}} claims {{are the main}} reason why the Armenian administration <b>and</b> <b>lobbyists</b> are pushing for global recognition" [...] of the Armenian Genocide. The Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism credits the idea of [...] "Great Armenia" [...] to Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan. According to Prof. İdris Bal [...] "Turkey considers Armenian policy (and the activities of its powerful diaspora groups) since 1989 to be against its national security interests and territorial integrity. Armenia's failure to recognize the Kars Agreement, along with the frequent public references to eastern Turkey as 'Western Armenia,' provides a serious irritant to Turkey. The Turkish Mt. Ararat is pictured in the official Armenian state emblem, which Turkey interprets {{as a sign that}} the 'greater Armenia' vision is still very much alive." ...|$|E

500|$|The Democrats, {{for their}} part, campaigned on the {{character}} of the candidates. They attacked Garfield for his connection with the Crédit Mobilier of America scandal of the early 1870s, in which many members of Congress were bribed by the Crédit Mobilier corporation, a railroad construction company. Garfield's precise involvement was unknown, but modern biographers agree that his account of his dealings with the construction syndicate were less than perfectly honest. Democrats used the incident as a contrast with Hancock who, as a career army officer, stood apart from Congress <b>and</b> <b>lobbyists.</b> Many in the Republican Party were reluctant to directly criticize the [...] "hero of Gettysburg", but they did characterize Hancock as uninformed on the issues, and some of his former comrades-in-arms gave critical speeches regarding his character. Democrats never made clear what about their victory would improve the nation; Jordan later characterized their message as simply [...] "our man is better than your man".|$|E
500|$|Pete Wentz {{was once}} again the primary lyricist of the band during the {{production}} of the album. Stump said that Wentz [...] "totally outdid himself on this record. He doesn't even know how good his lyrics are here." [...] Wentz, despite many recent personal developments (marriage to Ashlee Simpson, birth of his son, Bronx), desired to shift the focus away from himself and turn it outward onto the world. For the first time on a Fall Out Boy album, Folie is rarely autobiographical, as the band believed the format was [...] "losing its luster" [...] because [...] "everyone was doing it." [...] The songs on the album explore decaying relationships, moral dilemmas, and societal shortcomings, as well as concepts such as trust, infidelity, responsibility, and commitment. Stump tagged Folie à Deux as a [...] "message record" [...] that takes aim at [...] "the materialistic dance between any two parties obsessed with each other, whether it's teenage girls and handbag makers, politicians <b>and</b> <b>lobbyists</b> or tabloids and stars." [...] Folie à Deux also dissects how self-motivated American culture is, and many of the lyrics are intended to be satirical. While the album does contain political overtones, the band wanted to avoid being overt about these themes, leaving many lyrics open to interpretation for listeners.|$|E
500|$|As {{his tenure}} with VA-174 was ending, McCain was {{assigned}} to a low-profile desk job within the Naval Air Systems Command. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral James L. Holloway III thought this assignment a waste of McCain's social talents, and instead in July 1977 McCain {{was appointed to the}} Senate Liaison Office within the Navy's Office of Legislative Affairs (an assignment Jack McCain had once held). The office's role mostly consisted of providing constituent service and acting as a facilitator among legislators, the Department of Defense, <b>and</b> <b>lobbyists.</b> McCain later said the liaison job represented [...] " [...] real entry into the world of politics and the beginning of my second career as a public servant". McCain's lively personality and knowledge of military matters made his post in the Russell Senate Office Building a popular gathering spot for senators and staff. He also frequently escorted congressional delegations on overseas trips, where he arranged entertaining side escapades. McCain was influenced by senators of both parties, and formed an especially strong bond with John Tower of Texas, the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. During 1978 and 1979, McCain played a key behind-the-scenes role in gaining congressional funding for a new supercarrier against the wishes of the Carter administration and Navy Secretary W. Graham Claytor Jr. In August 1979, McCain was promoted to naval captain, and became Director of the Senate Liaison Office. [...] During McCain's time there, the Senate Liaison Office enjoyed one of its few periods of high influence.|$|E
