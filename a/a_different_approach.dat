5|$|After {{the repeal}} of the Stamp Act, Parliament took <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>approach</b> to raising revenue, passing the 1767 Townshend Acts, which {{established}} new duties on various imports and strengthened the customs agency by creating the American Customs Board. The British government believed that a more efficient customs system was necessary because many colonial American merchants had been smuggling. Smugglers violated the Navigation Acts by trading with ports outside of the British Empire and avoiding import taxes. Parliament hoped that the new system would reduce smuggling and generate revenue for the government.|$|E
5|$|Davies' script {{takes place}} in two {{distinct}} time frames and required two different actors for the eponymous role: the older Casanova was portrayed by Peter O'Toole, and the younger Casanova was portrayed by David Tennant. The serial takes place primarily during Casanova's early adulthood and depicts his life among three women: his mother (Dervla Kirwan), his lover Henriette (Laura Fraser), and his consort Bellino (Nina Sosanya). The script takes <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>approach</b> to Dennis Potter's 1971 dramatisation; instead of Potter's focus on sex and misogyny, the 2005 serial focuses on Casanova's compassion and respect for women.|$|E

5|$|For the {{production}} of the show, Gaga enlisted choreographer Richard Jackson and together with him and the Haus of Gaga, they came up with ideas regarding how the show should be constructed and what music should be performed. They also {{had to find a way}} to co-mingle all the different ideas to make a single, coherent show. For the choreography, which encompassed all the stages present, Jackson had to employ <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>approach,</b> so that the audience could see the performance from every angle.|$|E
5|$|Guitarist Kerry King {{wrote the}} {{majority}} of the lyrics, taking <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>approach</b> from earlier recordings by exploring topics such as religion, murder, revenge and self-control. He limited the lyrics to realistic subject matter most could relate to. The band experimented, recording most of the album in C# tuning, with three songs in drop B and two others with seven-string guitars in Bâ™­. The album's release was delayed due to the explicit cover artwork which led to alternative slip covers in some retail outlets, difficulties during audio mixing and a change of distributor for the band's record label, American.|$|E
5|$|In his Commentary on Matthew, however, Origen offered <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>approach.</b> Answering criticisms {{that there}} was no mention of this {{incident}} in any of the many non-Christian sources, he insisted that it was local to Palestine, and therefore would have gone unnoticed outside. To suggestions it was merely an eclipse, Origen pointed out that this was impossible and suggested other explanations, such as heavy clouds, drawing only on the accounts given in Matthew and Mark, which make no mention of the sun.|$|E

5|$|The first Myst titles used pre-rendered graphics, and {{digitally}} inserted {{footage of}} live actors into the backgrounds. For Myst V: End of Ages, <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>approach</b> was taken; a special camera recorded actor's faces and mapped the video onto digital models. The characters of Myst have been generally praised in each installment. Reviewers {{found that the}} live action characters increased immersion, while the digital body language and spoken conviction in End of Ages endeared the characters to the player. Dissenting reviewers considered Mysts acting overly melodramatic and overwrought.|$|E
5|$|The new 3-litre engines under {{development}} by competing team Ferrari had 12 cylinders. Jack Brabham, owner and lead driver of BRO, took <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>approach</b> {{to the problem}} of obtaining a suitable engine. He persuaded Australian company Repco to develop a new 3-litre eight-cylinder engine for him, largely based on available components; the engine would produce less power than Ferrari's, but would be lighter, easier to fix and more fuel efficient.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>different</b> <b>approach</b> {{to resolve}} the {{problems}} of range anxiety and lack of recharging infrastructure for electric vehicles was developed by Better Place. Its business model considers that electric cars are built and sold separately from the battery pack. As customers {{are not allowed to}} purchase battery packs, they must lease them from Better Place which will deploy a network of battery swapping stations thus expanding EVs range and allowing long distance trips. Subscribed users pay a per-distance fee to cover battery pack leasing, charging and swap infrastructure, the cost of sustainable electricity, and other costs. Better Place signed agreement for deployment in Australia, Denmark, Israel, Canada, California, and Hawaii. The Renault Fluence Z.E. was the electric car built with switchable battery technology sold for the Better Place network. The robotic battery-switching operation was completed in about five minutes.|$|E

5|$|After {{the repeal}} of the Stamp Act, Parliament took <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>approach</b> to raising revenue, passing the Townshend Acts in 1767 which {{established}} new duties on various goods imported into the colonies. These duties were relatively low because the British ministry wanted to establish the precedent that Parliament had the right to impose tariffs on the colonies before raising them. Revenues from these duties were to be used to pay for governors and judges who would be independent of colonial control. To enforce compliance with the new laws, the Townshend Acts created a customs agency known as the American Board of Custom Commissioners, which was headquartered in Boston.|$|E
5|$|Although Richard sought {{peace with}} France, he took <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>approach</b> to the {{situation}} in Ireland. The English lordships in Ireland were in danger of being overrun, and the Anglo-Irish lords were pleading for the king to intervene. In the autumn of 1394, Richard left for Ireland, where he remained until May 1395. His army of more than 8,000 men was the largest force brought to the island during the late Middle Ages. The invasion was a success, and a number of Irish chieftains submitted to English overlordship. It {{was one of the most}} successful achievements of Richard's reign, and strengthened the king's support at home, although the consolidation of the English position in Ireland proved to be short-lived.|$|E
5|$|As the {{combined}} Texian force prepared for battle, they sent a messenger to instruct the alcalde {{of the city}} to surrender. At 11pm, the alcade responded that the town would remain neutral, neither surrendering nor fighting. Several of the locals did, however, supply axes to the Texian militia. The Texians divided themselves into four groups, each assigned <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>approach</b> to the presidio. In the pre-dawn hours of October 10, the Texians attacked. The lone sentinel managed to give the alarm but was immediately shot dead. The Texians quickly hacked through a door on the north wall of the fortress and ran to the interior courtyard. Hearing the commotion, the Mexican soldiers had lined the walls to defend the fort.|$|E

5|$|Chomsky {{argues that}} the multi-party, representative, liberal {{democracy}} that governs the United States is insufficiently democratic, instead advocating a form of participatory, direct democracy through which the ordinary citizens have a direct say in public policy. As such, he advocates that communities take <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>approach</b> to the upcoming primary elections; instead of simply listening to speeches given by the politicians hoping to be elected, they should get together in democratic councils and discuss what issues they want addressing. That done, Chomsky argues, they should approach the politicians, informing them {{that they have no}} interest in their speeches, but that if they want to get elected, they must come and listen {{to the demands of the}} people; alternately, he argues, these communities should select their own representatives whom they could then vote for.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy IX was {{developed}} alongside Final Fantasy VIII, but took <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>approach</b> {{by returning to}} the more traditional style of the early Final Fantasy games. Consequently, Final Fantasy IX was influenced significantly by the original Final Fantasy game, and features allusions to other titles in the series. It was released to critical acclaim and holds the highest Metacritic score of all Final Fantasy installments. It is often cited by critics and fans {{as one of the}} best entries in the series. Final Fantasy IX was commercially successful, selling over five million copies worldwide by March 2003 and five and a half million copies by February 2016. In 2016 ports featuring minor gameplay and graphical enhancements were released for iOS, Android and Microsoft Windows followed by a port for PlayStation 4 in 2017.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} two weeks, the outnumbered Berryforce {{attempted}} to retake the strategically important town in the Battle of Merdjayoun. His first attempt was a failure. After carrying out a personal reconnaissance on 18 June, Berryman tried again. This time his attack was halted by staunch defence by the French Foreign Legion and tanks. Berryman then tried <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>approach.</b> Instead of attempting to capture the town, he seized high ground overlooking the French supply lines. Faced with being cut off, the French withdrew from the town. Berryforce was then dissolved and Berryman returned to his role as commander of the 7th Division artillery.|$|E
