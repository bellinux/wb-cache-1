25|$|Even many {{of those}} who never {{received}} a deferment or exemption never served, simply because the pool of eligible men was so huge compared to the number required for service, that the draft boards never got around to drafting them when <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>crop</b> <b>of</b> men became available (until 1969) or because they had high lottery numbers (1970 and later).|$|E
25|$|Nonzee Nimibutr's Nang Nak in 1999 was a ghost story {{based on}} the same folkloric theme that had been {{depicted}} dozens of times throughout the history of Thai cinema and television. But it gave rise to <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>crop</b> <b>of</b> Thai horror and suspense films, including the Pang Brothers' The Eye, Nonzee's pan-Asian compilation Three, Bangkok Haunted, directed by Pisuth Praesaeng-Iam and Oxide Pang and the 2004 box-office smash Shutter by Banjong Pisonthanakun and Parkpoom Wongpoom.|$|E
500|$|Next came The Laws of Scourge (1991), {{considered}} a [...] "revolution" [...] in the band's career. A combination of better musicianship, improved production values, {{and more sophisticated}} songwriting landed them into technical death metal territory. Sarcófago's new direction in music was partly influenced by new members Fábio [...] "Jhasko" [...] (guitar) and Lúcio Olliver (drums), and inspired by <b>a</b> <b>newer</b> <b>crop</b> <b>of</b> extreme metal bands such as Godflesh, Paradise Lost, Bolt Thrower, Deicide, and Morbid Angel.|$|R

2500|$|In 1990 the new lineup {{recorded}} Fear of a Punk Planet, {{an album}} which established their presence amongst <b>an</b> emerging <b>new</b> <b>crop</b> <b>of</b> California punk rock bands including Green Day, NOFX, The Offspring, Rancid, Pennywise, and Sublime.

25|$|The early 1970s saw the {{emergence}} of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>crop</b> <b>of</b> West Indian cricketers, ones eager to shake the tag of Calypso, and who could dominate world cricket. However, {{it is said that}} when you have 10 young men from various islands in the Caribbean, you don't have a team; you have a gang. What was needed was a guiding hand, who could steer this young team in the right direction, and unite them for a common cause on the cricket field. That man was Clive Lloyd. Appointed as Captain in 1974, Lloyd's first major challenge came in the 1975-76 West Indies Tour of Australia.|$|E
25|$|Brown {{broke the}} magazine's longstanding taboo against {{treating}} photography seriously in 1992, when she invited Richard Avedon {{to be its}} first staff photographer. She also approved controversial covers from <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>crop</b> <b>of</b> artists, including Edward Sorel's October 1992 cover that had people buzzing {{about the meaning of}} a punk rock passenger sprawled in the backseat of an elegant horse-drawn carriage: was it Brown's self-mocking riposte to fears she would downgrade the magazine? A year later a national controversy was provoked by her publication of Art Spiegelman's Valentine's Day cover of a Jewish man and a black woman in an embracing kiss, a comment on the mounting racial tensions between blacks and ultra-Orthodox Jews in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, New York.|$|E
5000|$|I was 27 {{and still}} looked 16, {{but there was}} <b>a</b> whole <b>new</b> <b>crop</b> <b>of</b> boys coming up who really were that age. I'd thought my career was going {{straight}} up.

Some gymnasia have mentors that help the new, younger students get settled in. They show them around the school and introduce them to older students. In the case of boarding schools, they also show them the city. The mentoring does not mean a student is seen as being [...] "at risk". On the contrary, if there is a mentoring programme, all new students are likely to have a mentor.|$|R
25|$|Although, in Cuba, many composers {{have written}} both {{classical}} and popular creole types of music, the distinction became clearer after 1960, when (at least initially) the regime frowned on popular music and closed {{most of the}} night-club venues, whilst providing financial support for classical music rather than creole forms. From then on most musicians have kept their careers {{on one side of}} the invisible line or the other. After the Cuban Revolution in 1959, <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>crop</b> <b>of</b> classical musicians came onto the scene. The most important of these is guitarist Leo Brouwer, who made significant innovations in classical guitar, and is currently the director of the Havana Symphonic Orchestra. His directorship in the early 1970s of the Cuban Institute of Instrumental and Cinematographic Arts (ICAIC) was instrumental in the formation and consolidation of the nueva trova movement.|$|E
25|$|The 1980s was {{the decade}} in which Australia began to truly {{dominate}} world rugby league. Along {{with the emergence}} of State of Origin football came <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>crop</b> <b>of</b> superstar players who would lead Australia throughout the 1980s. Players such as Peter Sterling, Mal Meninga, Wayne Pearce, Brett Kenny, Eric Grothe and Wally Lewis came to prominence on the 1982 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France. Australia's performance was taken into a new dimension by the tourists, also known as 'the Invincibles', when they became the first team to win every game of the tour (fifteen games) including the first test by 40–4 at Hull in front of 26,771 spectators. After the extremely poor showing during their 1979 Australasian tour, the Kangaroos rammed home just how far behind British football had fallen at Boothferry Park. The score was only 10–4 at half time, but after the break Australia's superior fitness showed and they ran in six unanswered tries to leave the crowd and British football stunned.|$|E
25|$|The tour of Sri Lanka was Moores {{first tour}} overseas. The tour started with five ODI Internationals. Several new players were {{called up to}} the squad, {{including}} Phil Mustard and Graeme Swann. England were humbled in the first match, being bowled out for 150 chasing 270 {{to win the game}}. The following match saw the tables turned as England bowled Sri Lanka for out for 169 to win the game by 65 runs and level the series 1-1. Ryan Sidebottom, a player Moores had handed his debut to and integrated into the England squad, was the pick of the bowlers, with figures of 2-23. England then won the next match of the series which was badly affected by rain, resulting in the match being decided by the DL Method. The fourth ODI saw England complete a series win after winning the game by five wickets after chasing down 212 to win. Although England lost the final game by 107 runs after being bowled out for just 104, the 3-2 series win represented major progress for England, who had traditionally struggled on the sub-continent pitches. England had also gone into the series with a young team, including James Anderson, Stuart Broad and Ravi Bopara, showing that Moores was successfully bringing through <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>crop</b> <b>of</b> England players.|$|E

25|$|Australian Royce Simmons {{took over}} from compatriot Mick Potter {{for the start}} of the 2011 season. As the club awaited {{completion}} of the new stadium, all home fixtures in 2011 were played at the Halton Stadium in Widnes, effectively meaning St Helens were forced to play an entire season of away fixtures. In addition, they suffered upheaval in terms of the playing squad; having already lost the influential Cunningham to retirement and other club legends like Sean Long, the start of the season was overshadowed by the news that Kyle Eastmond, who had been earmarked as Long's replacement, and inspirational leader James Graham were both looking to leave the club. A number of serious injuries to further key players such as Leon Pryce and Ade Gardner meant the team was facing an uphill battle on the field all season. However, despite all the problems faced, St Helens defied the odds to reach their 11th Challenge Cup semi-final in a row, and at the end of the season they qualified for their 6th consecutive Grand Final. However, for the 5th year in a row they were on the losing side, as the injury-plagued squad finally succumbed to Leeds. However, the 2011 season saw the emergence of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>crop</b> <b>of</b> talent, with players such as Jonny Lomax and Lee Gaskell stepping up to fill the gaps left by senior players and earning rave reviews for their performances.|$|E
500|$|Nathaniel Hawthorne, {{though a}} {{founding}} member, was unhappy {{during his tenure}} as a Brook Farmer, partly because {{he was unable to}} write while living there. [...] "I have no quiet at all", he complained, and his hands were covered [...] "with <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>crop</b> <b>of</b> blisters—the effect of raking hay". He later presented a fictionalized portrait of his experience in his 1852 novel, The Blithedale Romance. He acknowledged the resemblance in his introduction, saying [...] "in the 'Blithedale' of this volume, many readers will probably suspect a faint and not very faithful shadowing of Brook Farm, in West Roxbury, which (now a little more than ten years ago) was occupied and cultivated by a company of socialists." [...] The chapter called [...] "The Masqueraders", for example, was based on a picnic held one September to celebrate the harvest season. George Ripley, who reviewed the book for the New York Tribune, said that former Brook Farmers would only notice the resemblance in the humorous parts of the story. Some have also seen a resemblance between Margaret Fuller and Hawthorne's fictional character Zenobia. In the novel, a visitor—a writer like Hawthorne—finds that hard farm labor is not conducive to intellectual creativity.|$|E

25|$|In 1980, at age 17, Escalante {{joined the}} punk rock band The Vandals, {{becoming}} their first permanent drummer. He would remain the sole constant {{member of the}} band {{throughout the rest of}} their career. They released their debut EP Peace thru Vandalism in 1982 through Epitaph Records. In 1984 Escalante and the other band members appeared in the Penelope Spheeris film Suburbia and released their first album When in Rome Do as the Vandals. In 1987 they appeared in another Spheeris film, Dudes. By 1989 Escalante had moved from the drums into the bass guitar position, and fluctuations in the band's membership had left him as the only member remaining from the original recording lineup. In order to continue the band, he and vocalist Dave Quackenbush set about finding new members, recruiting guitarist Warren Fitzgerald and drummer Josh Freese. In 1990 this lineup released the album Fear of a Punk Planet, establishing themselves amongst <b>an</b> emerging <b>new</b> <b>crop</b> <b>of</b> southern California punk rock bands.

With the Murrow Boys dominating the newsroom, Cronkite felt like an outsider soon after joining the network. Over time, as Murrow's career seemed on the decline and Cronkite's on the rise, the two found it increasingly difficult to work together. Cronkite's demeanor was similar to reporters Murrow had hired; the difference being that Murrow viewed the Murrow Boys as satellites rather than potential rivals, as Cronkite seemed to be.|$|E
