[...] Ark Music {{offered to take}} the video down from YouTube, but Black refused the offer, saying {{that she did not}} wish [...] "to give the haters the satisfaction that they got me so bad I gave up." [...] Black's father has accompanied her in public to guard against potential <b>accosters.</b> In response to criticism over the song's significant use of Auto-Tune, Black performed an acoustic version during an interview with ABC News, which earned over 180,000 dislikes on YouTube (84% of total ratings) by November 2011. Later in the interview Black's mother, Kelly, stated that she was [...] "angry and upset" [...] after Black was brought to tears by comments, such as [...] "I hope you go cut yourself and die" [...] and [...] "'I hope you cut yourself and get an eating disorder so you'll look pretty." [...] Black said, however, that soon she was able to ignore such comments, and asked Justin Bieber, her idol, to perform a duet with her. Although Bieber has not released an official announcement regarding the offer, he posted on Twitter [...] "sunday comes after saturday? weird." [...] Bieber later sang part of the chorus at one of his concerts. Rolling Stone's Perpetua again praised Black after the interview and said, [...] "She is actually a pretty decent singer. [...] She is a total sweetheart. [...] Black comes off as a well-adjusted, happy and grateful kid." [...] He also pointed out Black's intention to donate part of the profits from the song to school arts programs and relief efforts in Japan following the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami. Benni Cinkle, who became known as [...] "that girl in pink" [...] and appears during the second verse of the video, released her own song entitled [...] "Can You See Me Now" [...] and created an anti-bullying organization (That Girl In Pink Foundation) due to the negative response she got from [...] "Friday".|$|R
