Our sample includes the S&P 500 constituent firms {{in the first two}} fiscal years after the disclosing compliance deadline of December 15, 2006. We have 1, 082 performance targets for 526 firm-years. The top five performance measures are earnings per share (EPS), revenue, operating income, net income, and free cash flow. Our detailed analysis using EPS shows that EPS targets are set consistently lower than earnings expectations. In particular, EPS targets are lower than analyst consensus; and EPS growth targets are significantly lower than the previous year’s EPS growth and analyst consensus on the EPS growth for the firm as well as that for the firm’s industry. Comparing EPS targets with ex-post performance, we find that 70 % of firms exceed their performance targets. As a result, the ex-post <b>annual</b> <b>incentive</b> payouts (bonuses) are on average 127 % of the target payouts in our sample. Furthermore, after controlling for firm and CEO characteristics, we find that EPS targets are less challenging in firms with busier boards and lower institutional ownership...|$|E
40|$|After the Great Recession of 2007 {{there was}} a {{spotlight}} on executive compensation. The magnitude and structure of executive pay became an area of concern to the public.

30|$|The {{results in}} Table  2 on {{willingness}} to continue implementing PES practices imply significant importance farmers attached to PES farm practices. Similar studies (FAO 2011) have shown high willingness to restore ecological functions {{could be an}} indicator that PES can work in agriculture sector where ecosystem services are under threat and the opportunity costs for alternatives are not very high. However, Purvis et al. (1989) and Bond and Mayers (2010) demonstrated that farmers’ willingness to continue implementing PES interventions is influenced by <b>annual</b> <b>incentives</b> as beneficial additionality on ecological conditions and farmer opportunity cost. Conversely, Robertson et al. (2015) observed that farmers’ willingness to adopt new farm interventions that enhance sustainable ecosystem service provision depends on awareness creation, farmers’ attitudes, and incentive availability. High number of farmers willing to implement different PES interventions implies PES practices acceptance and possible understanding that the alternative PES interventions could have positive influence on environment and household livelihoods. Riparian land is important to farmers due to provision of water sources especially during dry season to support related ecosystem service for instance crop farming for food security. Farmers’ willingness to accept pay to implement grass strips is related to its dual purpose of {{soil and water conservation}} as well as provision of fodder for livestock. Low number of farmers (15  %) willing to accept pay to implement terracing is linked to different reasons ranging from high physical labour demand for mapping, marking, and digging terraces along with the high cost associated with the intervention. Contour cropping was a favoured practice by 32  %, and this is connected to less labour and skills required to implement the practice.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is twofold. Firstly, it examines the relationship between the use of financial and non-financial performance measures in executives’ <b>annual</b> <b>incentive</b> systems and firm performance. Secondly, it looks at the extent to which this relationship is influenced by five different organisational contingencies (business risk, ownership structure, organisational culture, the quality of the performance measures used in executives’ annual incentives and the effectiveness of the executives’ reward system). Agency theory and contingency theory are used to develop the theoretical framework that underpins this study. The research design is based on survey and archival data from 132 private and publicly quoted organisations based in the UK. Data is studied using multivariate analysis, in particular, multiple regression analysis with main and interaction effects. Contrary to expectations, the study finds that the relationship between the use of financial and non-financial performance measures in executives’ annual incentives and economic firm performance (measured by return on assets and sales annual growth) is negative rather than positive. However, this relationship is not universalistic. Results suggest that when organisations operate in high or low business risk environments or when organisations have clan or adhocracy cultural values the use of multi-criteria performance measures in executives’ annual incentives is beneficial as it facilitates the achievement of business goals. Results also suggest that ownership structure, the quality of performance measures and the effectiveness of executives’ reward systems are organisational contingencies that do not influence the performance impact of using multi-criteria performance measures in executives’ <b>annual</b> <b>incentive</b> systems. This thesis contributes to the management literature; in particular, to the literature that looks at the use of non-financial performance measures in management control systems. It contributes to agency-based research by providing empirical evidence that refutes some of its premises regarding the use of multi-criteria performance measures in incentive systems. This thesis also contributes to contingency-based research as it supports the notion that there is no universally appropriate management control system –in this case, the executive incentive system– which applies equally to all organisations in all circumstances.

40|$|A {{forest is}} a source of {{important}} ecosystem services with the total economic value which might exceed the private value associated with conversion of forest land to non-forest uses. Thus, compensating forest landowners for keeping their land in forest uses and for managing their forests for ecosystem services can be sound economic policy. We estimate the “supply curve ” for working forest retention and ecosystem service-enhancing forest management. The public, and/or conservation organizations would have to specify the terms of the “demand curve ” reflecting the public values attached to preventing forest conversion. Results are consistent with existing economic theory and empirical evidence of forest landowner program participation: landowners prefer larger per acre <b>annual</b> <b>incentive</b> payments, they prefer to commit to shorter contract duration, and they require extra compensation to engage in ecosystem production-enhancing forest management. The value of development option (however far removed into the future) is confirmed: landowners strongly dislike permanent conservation easement programs. Landowners concerned about the development pressure on their forestland appear more willing to participate in forest preservation programs. We do not expect these findings to change when the comprehensive survey results become available...|$|E

The aim of this project is to demonstrate to government that public and/or private funds can be efficiently allocated for vegetation corridor protection through voluntary engagement with landholders. The mechanism to demonstrate is a type of auction system where competing proposals for corridor locations are evaluated for potential funding. There are several ways that an auction or tender system can be designed to employ a competitive process to allocate public funding for corridor establishment. To identify the most appropriate mechanisms, a series of experimental workshops have been designed where landholders will be asked to indicate potential corridors and required <b>annual</b> <b>incentive</b> payments on maps of ‘dummy’ or ‘mock’ properties. ‘Dummy’ properties are being used as a way of controlling and limiting the influence of a number of variables.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of two essays exploring the effects of executive compensation contracts on the real economy. Evidence from equity incentive schemes and annual bonus plans are provided separately in the two essays. The first essay examines the relation between CEO option compensation and bank risk-taking, {{and the role of}} CEO option compensation in affecting bank performance during the 2007 - 2008 financial crisis. Through panel regressions, I find that over the sample period (1993 - 2011), option awards received by bank CEO and CEO option holdings lead to higher bank risk which is not rewarded by better performance. Bank CEOs take more risk by engaging more in financial innovation and maintaining more risky loan portfolios. Institutional investors favor high option compensation in their own interests of pursuing short-term stock price upswing, while a larger board corrects this excessive risk-taking by providing bank CEOs with less option compensation. Cross-sectional evidence shows that during the crisis period, the effect of option compensation in increasing risk-taking and worsening performance comes from exercisable option holdings. In addition to the findings regarding option compensation, stock awards are shown to affect bank risk and performance, while stock holdings play no role. In the second essay, using a hand collected sample of 1491 firm-years spanning 2006 - 2011, for which I have been able to gather from <b>annual</b> <b>incentive</b> schemes performance measures and two levels of corresponding targets which represent board directors’ performance expectations on chief executive officers (CEOs), I discover that the probability of CEO turnover significantly increases when a firm fails to meet its performance targets, and the likelihood of CEO replacement becomes even higher when minimum performance targets are missed. In a horse race of various financial measures used, failure to meet earnings targets most significantly increases the likelihood of CEO dismissal, and cash flow matters most when minimum targets are considered. Further, the effect varies with firm characteristics in that failing to meet revenue targets lead to turnover only in growth firms, while only in distressed firms CEOs are more likely to lose the job because of missing cash flow targets. Results are robust to the control of possible selection issues related to performance target disclosure and the choice of financial measures. published_or_final_versionEconomics and FinanceDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E

However, both financial incentives and contract lengths significantly influenced forest owners’ intent to enroll. Neither program administration nor forest owners’ sense of place influenced intent to enroll.

40|$|ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Ecuador {{experienced}} a deforestation rate, {{for the period}} between 2005 and 2010, of 186, 448 ha/year. Thus, Ecuador is among the countries with the highest deforestation rate in Latin America. The Socio Bosque Program (SBP) implemented by the Ecuadorian government aims at reducing deforestation, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and alleviating poverty by paying an <b>annual</b> monetary <b>incentive</b> for each hectare of native forest enrolled under the program. This study aims {{to gain a better}} understanding of the complexity of individual landowners' decision in the allocation of their native forest resources. A mixed mode design survey (face to face survey, telephone survey and online survey) was conducted in the northwest region of the province of Pichincha, Ecuador. A representative farm was modeled in the area of study using General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) in order to calculate a combination of land uses options alternatives- (including the SBP) which would optimize landholders' net present value (NPV) of lands. Results of the survey indicate that individuals participating in the program reported an average farm size of 129 hectares, while non-participants reported on average 62 hectares. SBP participants reported that 57 %, and nonparticipants reported 56 % of their land was covered by native forests. Out of the 174 individuals sampled, 32 were participating in the SBP. Of the remaining 142 landholders, 37 % were not participating due to the low payment of the SBP, 30 % were not participating because they lacked trust in the program, and 29 % of the respondents said they were not participating because the SBP was too complicated. Results from the logistic regression model showed that the number of hectares of native forest and whether the landholder lives in rural or urban area were significant important variables to predict landholder's participation in the SBP. The results of the GAMS model indicated that individual landholders maximize the NPV of their property by combined SBP enrollment with ecotourism, and harvesting activities. This study contributes to the current understanding of the SBP by determining variables that influence landholders' decision in whether or not to participate...|$|R
40|$|In 2007, the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) {{formed the}} Customer Response Task Force (CRTF) to {{identify}} barriers to deploying demand response (DR) resources in wholesale markets and develop policies {{to overcome these}} barriers. One of the initiatives of this Task Force was to develop more detailed information on existing retail DR programs and dynamic pricing tariffs, program rules, and utility operating practices. This report describes {{the results of a}} comprehensive survey conducted by LBNL in support of the Customer Response Task Force and discusses policy implications for integrating legacy retail DR programs and dynamic pricing tariffs into wholesale markets in the SPP region. LBNL conducted a detailed survey of existing DR programs and dynamic pricing tariffs administered by SPP's member utilities. Survey respondents were asked to provide information on advance notice requirements to customers, operational triggers used to call events (e. g. system emergencies, market conditions, local emergencies), use of these DR resources to meet planning reserves requirements, DR resource availability (e. g. seasonal, <b>annual),</b> participant <b>incentive</b> structures, and monitoring and verification (M&V) protocols. Nearly all of the 30 load-serving entities in SPP responded to the survey. Of this group, fourteen SPP member utilities administer 36 DR programs, five dynamic pricing tariffs, and six voluntary customer response initiatives. These existing DR programs and dynamic pricing tariffs have a peak demand reduction potential of 1, 552 MW. Other major findings of this study are: o About 81 percent of available DR is from interruptible rate tariffs offered to large commercial and industrial customers, while direct load control (DLC) programs account for ~;; 14 percent. o Arkansas accounts for ~;; 50 percent of the DR resources in the SPP footprint; these DR resources are primarily managed by cooperatives. o Publicly-owned cooperatives accounted for 54 percent of the existing DR resources among SPP members. For these entities, investment in DR is often driven by the need to reduce summer peak demand that is used to set demand charges for each distribution cooperative. o About 65 - 70 percent of the interruptible/curtailable tariffs and DLC programs are routinely triggered based on market conditions, not just for system emergencies. Approximately, 53 percent of the DR resources are available with less than two hours advance notice and 447 MW can be dispatched with less than thirty minutes notice. o Most legacy DR programs offered a reservation payment ($/kW) for participation; incentive payment levels ranged from $ 0. 40 to $ 8. 30 /kW-month for interruptible rate tariffs and $ 0. 30 to $ 4. 60 /kW-month for DLC programs.

40|$|The Organization of Midwest ISO States (OMS) {{launched}} the Midwest Demand Resource Initiative (MWDRI) in 2007 to identify barriers to deploying demand response (DR) {{resources in the}} Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) region and develop policies to overcome them. The MWDRI stakeholders decided that a useful initial activity would be to develop more detailed information on existing retail DR programs and dynamic pricing tariffs, program rules, and utility operating practices. This additional detail could then be used to assess any "seams issues" affecting coordination and integration of retail DR resources with MISO's wholesale markets. Working with state regulatory agencies, we conducted a detailed survey of existing DR programs, dynamic pricing tariffs, and their features in MISO states. Utilities {{were asked to provide}} information on advance notice requirements to customers, operational triggers used to call events (e. g. system emergencies, market conditions, local emergencies), use of these DR resources to meet planning reserves requirements, DR resource availability (e. g., seasonal, <b>annual),</b> participant <b>incentive</b> structures, and monitoring and verification (M&V) protocols. This report describes the results of this comprehensive survey and discusses policy implications for integrating legacy retail DR programs and dynamic pricing tariffs into organized wholesale markets. Survey responses from 37 MISO members and 4 non-members provided information on 141 DR programs and dynamic pricing tariffs with a peak load reduction potential of 4, 727 MW of retail DR resource. Major findings of this study area: - About 72 percent of available DR is from interruptible rate tariffs offered to large commercial and industrial customers, while direct load control (DLC) programs account for ~;; 18 percent. Almost 90 percent of the DR resources included in this survey are provided by investor-owned utilities. - Approximately, 90 percent of the DR resources are available with less than two hours advance notice and over 1, 900 MW can be dispatched on less than thirty minutes notice. These legacy DR programs are increasingly used by utilities for economic in addition to reliability purposes, with over two-thirds (68 percent) of these programs callable based on market conditions. - Approximately 60 percent of DLC programs and 30 percent of interruptible rate programs called ten or more DR events in 2006. Despite the high frequency of DR events, customer complaints remained low. The use of economic criteria to trigger DR events and the flexibility to trigger a large number of events suggests that DR resources can help improve the efficiency of MISO wholesale markets. - Most legacy DR programs offered a reservation payment ($/kW) for participation; incentive payment levels averaged about $ 5 /kW-month for interruptible rate tariffs and $ 6 /kW-month for DLC programs. Few programs offered incentive payments that were explicitly linked to actual load reductions during events and at least 27 DR programs do not have penalties for non-performance. - Measurement and verification (M&V) protocols to estimate load impacts vary significantly across MISO states. Almost half of the DR programs have not been evaluated in recent times and thus performance data for DR events is not available. For many DLC programs, M&V protocols may need to be enhanced in order to allow participation in MISO's proposed EDR schedule. System operators and planners will need to develop more accurate estimates of the load reduced capability and actual performance...|$|R
40|$|Debt {{relief and}} the scaling up {{of aid to}} low-income {{countries}} should allow for greater fiscal space for expenditure programs to create long-term growth and lower poverty rates. But designing a suitable medium-term fiscal framework that fosters a sustainable delivery of better public services and infrastructure while maintaining a credible commitment to fiscal prudence confronts many challenges. This paper discusses what low-income countries can do to shape fiscal policy frameworks that are ambitious in trying to absorb additional aid while still ensuring longer-term sustainability for government expenditure programs and finances.
