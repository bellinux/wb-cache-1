5|$|FN's 5.7×28mm {{cartridge}} cases <b>are</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> {{a special}} polymer coating for easier extraction with the PS90 carbine {{due to the}} high chamber pressures and lack of case tapering. In addition, this coating ensures proper feeding and function in the magazines.|$|E
5|$|Its spores are spherical, {{measuring}} 8–13µm, {{and have}} a surface of irregular, coarse warts. The capillitium refers to late-maturing, thick-walled cells in the gleba. The main axes of these branched cells are 20–30µm thick, and they <b>are</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> numerous spines.|$|E
5|$|Mill Creek Mountain, {{a narrow}} {{anticlinal}} mountain ridge, rises westward from the South Branch Potomac River across from Valley View.

5|$|The first pereiopod is {{modified}} into {{a strong}} cheliped (claw-bearing leg): the claw's fingers, the dactylus and propodus, are black at the tips. The other pereiopods <b>are</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> rows of short stiff setae; the dactylus of each is black towards the tip, and {{ends in a}} sharp point.|$|E
5|$|After an implant is placed, the {{internal}} components <b>are</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> either a healing abutment, or a cover screw. A healing abutment {{passes through the}} mucosa, and the surrounding mucosa is adapted around it. A cover screw is {{flush with the surface}} of the dental implant, and is designed to be completely covered by mucosa. After an integration period, a second surgery is required to reflect the mucosa and place a healing abutment.|$|E
5|$|For newly emerged {{adults of}} most {{myrmecophilous}} Lycaenidae, deciduous waxy scales provide some protection from predators as they {{emerge from the}} nest. In {{the case of the}} moth butterfly (Liphyra brassolis), the caterpillars are unwelcome guests in nests of tree ants, feeding on ant larvae. The adults emerging from pupae <b>are</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> soft, loose adhesive scales which rub off and stick on the ants as they make {{their way out of the}} nest after hatching.|$|E
50|$|The central {{bridge is}} partly built from Glinica limestone. Other parts are built from concrete. The balustrades with 642 balusters {{are made of}} {{artificial}} concrete. The platform <b>is</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> granite blocks laid in 2010. Previously, it <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> asphalt.|$|R
5000|$|Roofs in Scandinavia have {{probably}} <b>been</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> birch bark and sod since prehistory. During the Viking and Middle Ages most houses had sod roofs.

40|$|Four {{patients}} with five wounds {{were randomly assigned}} to treatment with three occlusive dressings: DuoDERM, Restore and Comfeel Ulcus; the dressings were left intact for 24 - 48 h. When the dressings were removed, it was found that wounds that had <b>been</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> Restore and Comfeel contained coagulated sanguinous material. Two wounds that had <b>been</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> Comfeel and Restore, respectively, <b>were</b> then <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> DuoDERM, while one wound previously <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> DuoDERM <b>was</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> Restore. Either no clotting occurred under DuoDERM or clots may have resolved. Although these preliminary data suggest that DuoDERM gel may have fibrinolytic properties, more extensive and controlled studies are needed to assess the characteristics of this dressing...|$|R
5|$|Humpbacks {{can easily}} be {{identified}} by their stocky body, obvious hump, black dorsal coloring and elongated pectoral fins. The head and lower jaw <b>are</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> knobs called tubercles, which are hair follicles and are characteristic of the species. The fluked tail, which typically rises above the surface when diving, has wavy trailing edges.|$|E
5|$|In deposit, {{the spores}} appear brown. Viewing {{them with a}} light {{microscope}} reveals finer details of their structure: they are roughly spherical but end abruptly in a small point, their surfaces <b>are</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> small, wart-like nodules, and their size is between 5.0–5.3 by 4.0–4.7µm. The spores are in amyloid, meaning they do not absorb iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent.|$|E
5|$|Like all arthropods, chelicerates' {{bodies and}} {{appendages}} <b>are</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> a tough cuticle made mainly of chitin and chemically hardened proteins. Since this cannot stretch, the animals must molt to grow. In other words, they grow new but still soft cuticles, then cast {{off the old}} one {{and wait for the}} new one to harden. Until the new cuticle hardens the animals are defenseless and almost immobilized.|$|E
50|$|The {{floors are}} {{finished}} with a pale green vinyl tile, however much of the nave floor has <b>been</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> a dark blue carpet. The floor of the sanctuary was {{finished with a}} cream marbled tile, which has also <b>been</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> a cream carpet.|$|R

The site is currently closed to the public in order to prevent further deterioration.|$|E
5|$|The broadly {{ellipsoid}} {{to roughly}} spherical spores are 5.5–7.5 by 4.5–5.5μm. Their surfaces <b>are</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> small rounded bumps. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are narrowly club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 25–30 by 6–7.5μm. The hyphae {{of the flesh}} are brownish with thin walls, and measure 4–6μm; hyphae in the spines are thin-walled, septate, and sometimes branched, measuring 3.5–4.5μm. The hyphae do not have clamp connections.|$|E

5|$|The {{interior}} room, {{like the}} exterior, is oriented east-west. The most prominent decorative element inside is the hand graining detail {{on the wood}} surfaces. An elevated gallery lines the north wall facing the pews which are bisected by 3½ ft (1.1 m) tall, 5 in (13cm) wide beaded board partition. The pews, partition, door, and window trim are all hand grained. The interior walls <b>are</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> 6 in (15cm) pine wainscotting. The original iron stoves have been replaced with oil-burning stoves, set into the original flues.|$|E
5|$|The {{red brick}} facade is {{detailed}} with {{significant amounts of}} limestone, including in its continuous lintels and sills. The entrances <b>are</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> large round arches. The full basement is hinted at by the building's prominent foundation and water table. The window lintels, and sills, {{as well as the}} arches and stairs are trimmed with limestone.|$|E
5|$|To avoid further wear of stairs' stones, since November 2014, {{two main}} {{sections}} of Borobudur stairs — the eastern (ascending route) and northern (descending route) sides — <b>are</b> <b>covered</b> <b>with</b> wooden structures. The similar technique {{has been applied}} in Angkor Wat in Cambodia and Egyptian Pyramids. In March 2015, Borobudur Conservation Center proposed further to seal the stairs with rubber cover.
