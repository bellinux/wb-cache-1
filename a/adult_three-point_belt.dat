40|$|Results of the swov-accident {{investigation}} {{prove that}} {{if there are any}} differences in the effectiveness of lap <b>belts</b> and <b>three-point</b> <b>belts,</b> these are so small that they cannot form a basis for giving preference to one type over the other. Furthermore, in spite of the results of this investigation which show some disadvantageous effects of diagonal belts (as compared to lap <b>belts</b> and <b>three-point</b> <b>belts),</b> involving a higher injury risk, which leads to the conclusion that general use of this type should not be favoured, a complete comdemnation of diagonal belts seems exaggerated. The effectiveness percentages of both lap <b>belts</b> and <b>three-point</b> <b>belts</b> show independently very high values. It is justifiable to draw the conclusion that both lap <b>belts</b> and <b>three-point</b> <b>belts</b> are highly effective measures for safety in traffic. There is also a dutch version of this report...|$|R
5000|$|A 3-point belt is a Y-shaped arrangement, {{similar to}} the {{separate}} lap and sash belts, but unitized. Like the separate lap-and-sash belt, in a collision the 3-point belt spreads out {{the energy of the}} moving body over the chest, pelvis, and shoulders. Volvo introduced the first production <b>three-point</b> <b>belt</b> in 1959. The first car with a <b>three-point</b> <b>belt</b> was a Volvo PV 544 that was delivered to a dealer in Kristianstad on August 13, 1959. However, the first car model to feature the <b>three-point</b> seat <b>belt</b> as a standard item was the 1959 Volvo 122, first outfitted with a two-point belt at initial delivery in 1958, replaced with the <b>three-point</b> seat <b>belt</b> the following year. The <b>three-point</b> <b>belt</b> was developed by Nils Bohlin who had earlier also worked on ejection seats at Saab. [...] Volvo then made the new seat belt design patent open in the interest of safety and made it available to other car manufacturers for free.|$|R
40|$|Use of seatbelts in late model {{cars with}} {{automatic}} or manual belt systems {{was observed in}} suburban Washington, DC, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia. In cars with automatic two-point belt systems, the use of shoulder belts by drivers was substantially {{higher than in the}} same model cars with manual <b>three-point</b> <b>belts.</b> This finding was true in varying degrees whatever the type of automatic belt, including cars with detachable nonmotorized belts, cars with detachable motorized belts, and especially cars with nondetachable motorized belts. Most of these automatic shoulder belts systems include manual lap belts. Use of lap belts was lower in cars with automatic two-point belt systems than in the same model cars with manual three-point belts; precisely how much lower could not be reliably estimated in this survey. Use of shoulder and lap belts was slightly higher in General Motors cars with detachable automatic <b>three-point</b> <b>belts</b> compared with the same model cars with manual three-point belts; in Hondas {{there was no difference in}} the rates of use of manual <b>three-point</b> <b>belts</b> and the rates of use of automatic <b>three-point</b> <b>belts...</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1955 (as a 1956 package), Ford offered lap only {{seat belts}} {{in the rear}} seats as an option within the Lifeguard safety package. In 1967, Volvo started to install lap belts in the rear seats. In 1972, Volvo {{upgraded}} the rear seat <b>belts</b> to a <b>three-point</b> <b>belt.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present the crash {{exposure}} patterns of pregnant occupants and to evaluate the effectiveness of restraint systems, including four-point seatbelts, in far side crashes. The NASS CDS database revealed that 53. 0 % of pregnant occupants are exposed to frontal crashes while 13. 5 % are exposed to far side impacts. Given that far side crashes were the second leading crash mode after frontal impacts, a previously validated MADYMO computer model of a 30 week pregnant occupant was utilized to investigate pregnant occupant biomechanics in far side crashes. Three impact speeds (5, 15, and 25 mph) were simulated with four restraint conditions: unbelted, lap-belt only, <b>three-point</b> <b>belt,</b> and a four-point belt. Direct abdominal contact from the shoulder strap of the <b>three-point</b> or four-point <b>belt</b> caused uterine-placental strain in contrast to the inertial loading induced strain in the lap-belt and unbelted cases. Overall, the <b>three-point</b> and four-point <b>belt</b> systems provide superior restraint effectiveness for the pregnant occupant compared to the lap-belt and no restraint cases. The four-point resulted in slightly better performance than the <b>three-point</b> <b>belt</b> by reducing the fetal injury risk and occupant excursion...|$|R
50|$|A {{lap belt}} is a strap that {{goes over the}} waist. This was the most {{commonly}} installed type of belt prior to legislation requiring 3-point belts, and is primarily found in older cars. Coaches are equipped with lap belts (although many newer coaches have <b>three-point</b> <b>belts),</b> as are passenger aircraft seats.|$|R

5000|$|In 1992, the V6 and 5.2L V8 engines were {{fitted with}} {{sequential}} multiple-port fuel injection (SMPI) and a [...] "barrel"-type intake manifold, which boosted power dramatically, and the outboard {{positions of the}} rear seat gained <b>three-point</b> <b>belts.</b> In the same year, compressed natural gas 5.2 L engines became optional for fleet buyers. The 5.9 L received the new intake and SMPI for 1993.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to designing an effective <b>three-point</b> <b>belt,</b> Bohlin demonstrated its effectiveness {{in a study}} of 28,000 accidents in Sweden, and presented a paper at the 11th Stapp Car Crash Convention. Unbelted occupants sustained fatal injuries throughout the whole speed scale, whereas none of the belted occupants was fatally injured at accident speeds below 60 mph. No belted occupant was fatally injured if the passenger compartment remained intact. This study resulted in the U.S. Department of Transportation requiring <b>three-point</b> seat <b>belts</b> in American cars. In 1968, the new seat belt design was made free for the public to use. In most industrial countries, occupants are required by law to use seat belts.|$|R
40|$|A revised {{brochure}} {{is presented}} {{which is designed}} to stimulate the use of safety belts. After an introduction questions on the need for safety belts. The best type of belt and the connect wearing of the belt are answered. The effectiveness of the different types of restraint systems, <b>three-points</b> <b>belts,</b> diagonal belts, lap belts and head rests is discussed. The use of safety belts in rural and urban areas is mentioned, as is the problem of cars in which safety belts have to be used. A distinction is made between adults, children of different ages, disabled persons and pregnant women. Finally some objections to the use of safety belts are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Starting in 1971 {{and ending}} in 1972, the United States {{conducted}} {{a research project}} on seat belt effectiveness on a total of 40,000 vehicle occupants using car accident reports collected during that time. Of these 40,000 occupants, 18% were reported wearing lap belts, or two-point safety belts, 2% were reported wearing a <b>three-point</b> safety <b>belt,</b> and the remaining 80% was reported as wearing no safety belt. The results concluded that users of the two-point lap belt had a 73% lower fatality rate, a 53% lower serious injury rate, and a 38% lower injury rate, {{when compared with the}} occupants that were reported unrestrained. Similarly, users of the <b>three-point</b> safety <b>belt</b> had a 60% lower serious injury rate and a 41% lower rate of all other injuries.

40|$|There is an {{increased}} risk of the shoulder belt slipping off in certain crash configurations, resulting in sub-optimal protection. An extra seat belt would improve the restraint system. The objective {{of this study was to}} identify children’s and adult’s attitudes toward extra seat belts added to the <b>three-point</b> <b>belt</b> in the rear seat of a passenger car. Five focus groups were conducted with 11 Swedish children (8 - 10 years), and 18 adults. Two concepts were studied, the Backpack with an extra belt over the inboard shoulder, and the Criss-Cross with an extra belt across the torso. The results showed that seat belt usage was not questioned. The <b>three-point</b> <b>belt</b> was experienced as very safe, and extra seat belts were considered to further increase safety. Both concepts were accepted, but Criss-Cross was preferred due to greater perceived safety and comfort. Discomfort occurred in both concepts due to chafing at the neck, extra pressure on the upper body, and reduced ability to move. In conclusion, extra seat belts were in line with children’s current attitudes toward car safety, while adults were more hesitant. Increased understanding of user attitudes provides input to future restraint system design, resulting in attractive systems with improved restraint function...|$|R

50|$|This has {{led many}} {{countries}} to adopt mandatory seat belt wearing laws. It is generally accepted that, in comparing like-for-like accidents, a vehicle occupant not wearing a properly fitted seat belt has a significantly and substantially higher chance of death and serious injury. One large observation studying using US data showed that the odds ratio of crash death is 0.46 with a <b>three-point</b> <b>belt,</b> when compared with no belt. In another study that examined injuries presenting to the ER pre- and post-seat belt law introduction, {{it was found that}} 40% more escaped injury and 35% more escaped mild and moderate injuries.|$|R

The occupant model represents a 5 th percentile female at around the 38 th week of pregnancy. A finite element uterus and multi-body fetus is integrated into an existing female model to incorporate pregnant female anthropometry. The complete model, ‘Expecting’, is used to simulate a range of frontal impacts of increasing severity from 15 km/h to 45 km/h. Three levels of occupant restraint, completely unrestrained, <b>three-point</b> seat <b>belt,</b> and <b>three-point</b> seat <b>belt</b> with an airbag, are investigated. The strains developed in the uterus because of loading from the seat belt and steering-wheel unit are presented, together with an analysis of stress distribution due to inertial loading of the fetus on the uterus. The unrestrained cases are shown to be the most dangerous to the fetus, owing to the large interaction with the vehicle steering wheel {{at the level of the}} placenta. The use of a <b>three-point</b> seat <b>belt</b> together with a driver airbag appears to offer the greatest protection to the fetus...|$|R
5000|$|Most {{seat belt}} {{laws in the}} United States are left to the states. However, the first seat belt law was a federal law, Title 49 of the United States Code, Chapter 301, Motor Vehicle Safety Standard, which took effect on January 1, 1968, that {{required}} all vehicles (except buses) to be fitted with seat belts in all designated seating positions. This law has since been modified to require <b>three-point</b> seat <b>belts</b> in outboard-seating positions, and finally <b>three-point</b> seat <b>belts</b> in all seating positions. Initially, seat belt use was voluntary. New York was {{the first state to}} pass a law which required vehicle occupants to wear seat belts, a law that came into effect on December 1, 1984.
