40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{a case study}} of model-based diagnostics system development for <b>a</b> <b>space</b> <b>launch</b> <b>vehicle</b> application. The diagnostics algorithms described in the paper can work with on-board or telemetry flight data. The key innovation is in designing a distributed diagnostics system that directly uses parametric data, such as sensors data. The computations are partitioned between the subsystems and a central IVHM system to match the system knowledge partitioning. The subsystem algorithms use detailed systems models. The central algorithms use cross-vehicle fault signature knowledge. The developed algorithms provide fault condition estimates that allow for consistent detection of incipient performance faults and abnormal conditions...|$|R

Estimation of time varying fault parameters uses parametric vehicle-level data and detailed dynamical models. The algorithms explicitly utilize the knowledge of fault monotonicity (damage can only increase, never improve with time) where available.
