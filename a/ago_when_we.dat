25|$|The {{purpose of}} {{archaeology}} {{is to learn}} more about past societies and the development of the human race. Over 99% of the development of humanity has occurred within prehistoric cultures, who did not make use of writing, thereby no written records exist for study purposes. Without such written sources, the only way to understand prehistoric societies is through archaeology. Because archaeology is the study of past human activity, it stretches back to about 2.5 million years <b>ago</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> find the first stone tools - The Oldowan Industry. Many important developments in human history occurred during prehistory, such as the evolution of humanity during the Paleolithic period, when the hominins developed from the australopithecines in Africa and eventually into modern Homo sapiens. Archaeology also sheds light on many of humanity's technological advances, for instance the ability to use fire, the development of stone tools, the discovery of metallurgy, the beginnings of religion and the creation of agriculture. Without archaeology, we would know little or nothing about the use of material culture by humanity that pre-dates writing.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2013, Russian {{president}} Vladimir Putin said in {{a television}} interview that Russia attacked Georgia because the Georgian government was smuggling terrorists across Abkhazia to the Russian border near Sochi. [...] "About {{six or seven years}} <b>ago</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> had to attack Georgian territories, those were not just strikes on Georgia. We targeted militant groups that came very close to Sochi. … Georgian police vehicles were transporting the militants to the Russian border. So we had to take some pre-emptive measures.

2500|$|According to Deacon, this {{occurred}} between 2 and 2.5 million years <b>ago,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> {{have the first}} fossil evidence of stone tool use {{and the beginning of}} a trend in an increase in brain size. But it is the evolution of symbolic language which is the cause—and not the effect—of these trends. More specifically, Deacon is suggesting that Australopithecines, like contemporary apes, used tools; it is possible that over the millions of years of Australopithecine history, many troops developed symbolic communication systems. All that was necessary was that one of these groups so altered their environment that [...] "it introduced selection for very different learning abilities than affected prior species." [...] This troop or population kick-started the Baldwinian process (the [...] "ratchet effect") that led to their evolution to genus Homo.|$|E
2500|$|During his {{postponed}} trip to Venezuela, Humala {{was personally}} welcomed by Chavez at Miraflores Palace. He reiterated calls for regional integration saying [...] "As 200 years <b>ago,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> fought colonialism, {{today we have}} common enemies like poverty, inequalities, drug trafficking and so many threats against our countries. I have come as a friend and a brother; and this brotherhood leads us to a similar future." [...] He also wished Chavez a recovery from his cancer treatment: [...] "We are giving you support, please count on our forces and the prayers of the Peruvian people, who want your recovery {{because you have a}} mission to accomplish." [...] Humala also paid a visit to Simón Bolívar's birthplace house and met with officials at the headquarters of the Corporacion Andina de Fomento.|$|E
2500|$|Newly crowned {{champion}} di Grassi said of {{his title}} success, [...] "This journey, this day started three years <b>ago</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> started season one, {{and then we got}} a lot of good results. I arrived in London fighting for the championship, even though I got disqualified from winning a race. Season two, the same situation, even got disqualified from winning a race. Finally I came here as an underdog, 10 points behind and had the nerves to keep calm, I did the job yesterday and today managed to win it also. I’m so happy for my team, so happy for the ABT Schaeffler Audi Sport guys, they really deserve it." [...] He later claimed to have not given up hope in winning the championship despite a competitive field and retiring from the Paris ePrix, but also admitted that focusing on Formula E after Audi's withdrawal from the World Endurance Championship at the end of 2016 aided his title effort. While Buemi admitted his disappointment in losing the championship, he congratulated di Grassi on securing the accolade, and stated him missing the New York City races was not an excuse in his loss. Regarding his pit stop early in the race, Buemi chose not to judge if the stewards made the correct decision and admitted not knowing about the regulation that required him to enter the pit lane because of car damage.|$|E

We can only control getting to the Rose Bowl. Winning our conference and going to the Rose Bowl is what our goal is every year. Our goal isn't about national championships, because we don't have control of that -- that's in somebody else's hands. We found that out years <b>ago</b> 2003, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were No. 1 but then we were No. 3. We already knew that but that just proved it.

60|$|Sometimes this dawn of {{consciousness}} is {{preceded by a}} long twilight of soul-awakening; but sometimes, upon more sensitive and subtler natures, the light breaks with all the suddenness of a sunrise at the equator, revealing to the mind's eye an unsuspected world of self within. But in whatever way we may awake to it, the sense of personality, when first realized, appears already, like the fabled Goddess of Wisdom, full grown in the brain. From the moment <b>when</b> <b>we</b> first remember ourselves {{we seem to be}} as old as we ever seem to others afterwards to become. We grow, indeed, in knowledge, in wisdom, in experience, as our years increase, but deep down in our heart of hearts we are still essentially the same. To be sure, people pay us more deference than they did, which suggests a doubt at times whether we may not have changed; small boys of a succeeding generation treat us with a respect that causes us inwardly to smile, as we think how little we differ from them, if they but knew it. For at bottom we are not conscious of change from that morning, long <b>ago,</b> <b>when</b> first <b>we</b> realized ourselves. We feel just as young now as we felt old then. We are but amused at the world's discrimination where we can detect no difference.|$|R

From the top field that we crossed to go down to their cottage, all the far sweep of those outstretched wings of beauty could be seen. Very wonderful was the poise of the sacred bird, that moved nowhere but in our hearts. The lime-tree scent was just stealing out into air for some days already bereft of the scent of hay; and the sun was falling to his evening home behind our pines and beeches. It was no more than radiant warm. And, as we went, we wondered why we had not been told before that Mrs. Herd was so very ill. It was foolish to wonder--these people do not speak of suffering till it is late. To speak, when it means what this meant loss of wife and mother--was to flatter reality too much. To be healthy, or--die! That is their creed. To go on till they drop--then very soon pass away! What room for states between--on their poor wage, in their poor cottages? ...|$|R
