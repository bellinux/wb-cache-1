5|$|In {{day-to-day life}} {{all of us}} observe that a stream of water {{emerging}} from a faucet will break up into droplets, no matter how smoothly the stream is emitted from the faucet.

5|$|Presumably as <b>a</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Roman advance, various hill forts such as Dun Mor in Perthshire, {{which had}} been {{abandoned}} by the natives long ago, were re-occupied.

5|$|Among the colonies, news of {{the attack}} led to {{rejection}} of British authority {{and the establishment of}} independent governments.

5|$|Apart from {{arguments}} {{over whether or}} not austerity, rather than increased or frozen spending, is a macroeconomic solution, union leaders have also argued that the working population is being unjustly held responsible for the economic mismanagement errors of economists, investors, and bankers. Over 23 million EU workers have become unemployed as <b>a</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> global economic crisis of 2007–2010, and this has led many to call for additional regulation of the banking sector across not only Europe, but the entire world.|$|E
5|$|As <b>a</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> race, Coulthard's {{second place}} narrowed the gap to Michael Schumacher in the Drivers' Championship to six points, while Häkkinen's win meant he closed to within two points of Coulthard. After the Grand Prix, McLaren were docked 10 points for a post-race {{technical}} infringement, resulting in Ferrari maintaining their {{lead in the}} Constructors' Championship with a four-point gap over McLaren, with seven races of the season remaining.|$|E

5|$|As <b>a</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> race, Hamilton {{extended}} his {{lead in the}} World Drivers' Championship to be seven points ahead of Button. This ensured the pair would enter the next, and their home race - the British Grand Prix - as first and second in the championship. Vettel's victory moved him up to third in standings; he became six points behind Button after surpassing the totals of teammate Mark Webber and Fernando Alonso. By gaining the most points from the race, McLaren extended their lead in the World Constructors' Championship to thirty over Red Bull.|$|E
5|$|As <b>a</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> race, Michael Schumacher {{retained}} his points {{advantage in}} the Drivers' Championship over nearest rival David Coulthard as both drivers retired from the event. Ralf Schumacher moved ahead of Barrichello to take over third position. In the Constructors' Championship, Ferrari retained their lead, while Williams reduced the deficit to McLaren by ten points, with five races of the season remaining. This was the last Grand Prix to be held on the former Hockenheimring circuit; the race was held on a shorter reconfigured track from 2002.|$|E
5|$|As <b>a</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> race, Michael Schumacher won the Drivers' Championship with a {{twelve-point}} gap over championship rival Häkkinen, who in {{turn was}} confirmed as the runner-up in the Championship. Coulthard maintained third with 67 points, nine points ahead of Barrichello, and 43 in front of Ralf Schumacher. In the Constructors' Championship, Ferrari increased their lead to thirteen points. Williams, with 36 points, increased the gap to their rivals Benetton by 16 points, while BAR passed Jordan for fifth place on 18 points, with one race of the season remaining.|$|E

5|$|As <b>a</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> race, Schumacher reduced Häkkinen's {{lead in the}} Drivers' Championship to two points, with David Coulthard {{a further}} 17 points back. Rubens Barrichello who {{was caught up in}} the first lap {{accident}} was mathematically ruled out of clinching the title. In the Constructors' Championship, McLaren's eight-point advantage going into the race was reduced to four, with three races of the season remaining. Gislimberti later died in hospital and his death caused safety measures in Formula One to be reviewed.|$|E
5|$|By June 1992, {{approximately}} 800 {{people had}} been killed by the bombardment. By the end of the Croatian War of Independence in 1995, a total of 1,724 people from Osijek had been killed, including 1,327 soldiers and 397 civilians. The city itself suffered great damage during the war, with the bulk of direct damage occurring as <b>a</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1991–92 bombardment. Direct war damage sustained by the city was estimated at a total of US$1.3billion. The damage was regularly recorded by 400 volunteers during the bombardment.|$|E
5|$|Following an 1866 {{conflict}} between the increasingly authoritarian Cuza and the political class, various trends organized a coup which brought Prince Carol, a Hohenzollern, to the Romanian throne—echoing a will expressed {{by some of the}} 1848 activists to have a foreign dynasty rule over a unified state. In 1877, as <b>a</b> <b>consequence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Russo-Turkish War, Romania proclaimed her independence.|$|E
