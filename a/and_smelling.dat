5|$|Bramshill {{has been}} cited {{as one of the}} most haunted houses in England. According to one UK police officer who worked at the college, 14 ghosts have purportedly been identified, {{although}} another officer at the college did not take these suggestions seriously. They include a Grey Lady (one story suggests that her husband, a religious dissenter, was beheaded in the 17th century) and a Green Man (a Cope family member who either drowned in the lake in 1806, according to the journalist P. Lal, or threw himself off a cliff near Brighton, according to the author Penny Legg). The Green Man, dressed as his name suggests, reportedly manifests near the lake, as does the ghost supposed to be that of a gardener who drowned there. The Grey Lady allegedly haunts the terrace, the library, and the chapel. Legg suggests that she has a young and beautiful appearance, with a sad, tear-stained face and golden hair, <b>and</b> <b>smelling</b> of the lilies of the valley; Lal argues that she has reddish-brown hair and wears a grey, sleeveless robe. The Grey Lady's husband has been reported to haunt the stables and the chapel drawing room. The ghost of a young child allegedly haunts the library and the Fleur de Lys room; the child has supposedly been heard crying, and attempts to hold visitors' hands. Folklore holds that the Grey Lady was the child's mother. A lady dressed in the style of Queen Anne, and a knight in armour, are reported to have been seen in the chapel drawing room. The chapel itself is purportedly frequented by the ghost of a lady in 17th-century dress, and by that of a nun. A young man dressed in 1920s tennis garb, reputed to be a Cope family member who fell from a train, has supposedly been seen in the reception area of the house. A small boy documented to haunt the terrace is said to have fallen from the roof sometime in the 18th century.|$|E
25|$|While modern {{identification}} of mushrooms is quickly becoming molecular, the standard methods for identification are still used by most and have {{developed into a}} fine art harking back to medieval times and the Victorian era, combined with microscopic examination. The presence of juices upon breaking, bruising reactions, odors, tastes, shades of color, habitat, habit, and season are all considered by both amateur and professional mycologists. Tasting <b>and</b> <b>smelling</b> mushrooms carries its own hazards because of poisons and allergens. Chemical tests are also used for some genera.|$|E

25|$|The {{surviving}} building holds a local {{reputation as}} the locale of various paranormal activity, with visitors and local residents claiming to {{hear the sound of}} rattling chains or wagon wheels and horses' hooves, seeing smoke (presumably from soldiers' pipes), spotting apparitions of a woman in a hoop skirt, <b>and</b> <b>smelling</b> a strong lavender violet perfume. The Drum Barracks was profiled on Unsolved Mysteries in the early 1990s in a segment called 'Civil War Ghosts'. Some of the people interviewed in that segment claimed to have seen apparitions of Civil War soldiers. In 2005 the Barracks was featured in an episode of Most Haunted.|$|E
25|$|Walking {{the streets}} of Venice, Aschenbach is accosted at every turn by beggars, street sellers and others {{demanding}} his custom. Seeing rubbish on the streets <b>and</b> <b>smelling</b> the foul water of the canals, he feels nauseated and claustrophobic, and decides that he must leave Venice. Back at the hotel, the Manager expresses his regret over Aschenbach's departure. When Tadzio returns Aschenbach's glances, Aschenbach himself also feels regret. On arriving at the station, Aschenbach finds that his luggage has been sent on the wrong train ("I am furious because I am forced to return, but secretly I rejoice. Vacillating, irresolute, absurd"), and he realises upon seeing Tadzio again that the boy {{was the cause of}} his regret at leaving.|$|E
25|$|The {{first three}} planes {{belong to the}} subtle sphere, the fourth is on the {{threshold}} between the subtle and the mental spheres and the fifth and sixth planes are in the mental sphere. The first plane starts from {{the threshold of the}} gross and the subtle sphere. The soul here starts experiencing subtle phenomena simultaneously through its gross and subtle senses. It starts hearing subtle sounds <b>and</b> <b>smelling</b> subtle scents, although their nature is far different from their gross equivalents. Eventually it starts perceiving the subtle world through its subtle body and so comes to the second plane. Here the soul becomes aware of infinite energy and can perform minor miracles, like stopping moving objects or filling dried wells with fresh water. Being not conscious of the gross world its experience gives rise only to subtle impressions of the sights, scents and sounds of the subtle world. Further involution of consciousness makes the soul experience the third plane. Here the soul can use more aspects of the infinite energy by performing greater miracles, such as giving sight to the blind, or restoring maimed limbs.|$|E

500|$|The show is {{staged in}} what is {{described}} as an [...] "unapologetically low-tech" [...] manner. The play uses clothing {{as a metaphor for}} women's experiences. In addition to clothing, accessories such as a purse are important, and Charles Isherwood of The New York Times notes that when Ms. Ephron views a purse, [...] "In the chaos of its interior she sees a symbol of herself, as in a dark mirror smudged with old lipstick <b>and</b> <b>smelling</b> of spilled perfume." [...] The show consists of five women's monologues about wardrobe malfunctions, puberty's relationship with personal wardrobe, first date outfits, lucky underwear, prom dresses, favorite boots, irreplaceable shirts, the detested, disorganized purse, and experiences in the dressing room. The recollections about the clothing prompt the women's memories about their mothers, boyfriends, husbands, ex-husbands, sisters and grandchildren.|$|E

The player can command the dog to search the ground at any time, including in huts and cities.

With repeated use, Alchemy Formulas will increase in level, enhancing their curative, offensive, or support effectiveness. Although {{there are dozens of}} Formulas available to be found within the game, only nine can be equipped at a time. To overcome this, there are several Alchemists scattered throughout the game who offer to manage the boy's current Alchemy list; any formula that has already been learned can be stored by the Alchemist for later use.|$|E

40|$|Malnutrition {{is common}} in both adult and {{pediatric}} patients undergoing treatment for cancer. Patients commonly attribute difficulties maintaining food intake to an altered taste developed during treatment. This review summarizes {{what is known about}} taste <b>and</b> <b>smell</b> dysfunction in patients with undergoing chemotherapy as their main treatment modality. Self-reported taste <b>and</b> <b>smell</b> alterations are prevalent in upwards of 86 % of cancer patients. There is some evidence for decreased taste sensitivity in cancer patients when assessed using common gustatory tests. In some patients, taste <b>and</b> <b>smell</b> alterations may continue well after their cancer treatment has been completed. Such disorders can increase distress, reduce appetite and contribute towards poor nutritional status in cancer patients. There remain no effective interventions for improving the appetite or nutritional intake of patients with cancer experiencing taste <b>and</b> <b>smell</b> changes. There is a lack of consistency in assessment methodologies for measuring taste <b>and</b> <b>smell</b> changes in cancer patients and we therefore recommend that future work use well-established methods. Research should also take into account the role of food hedonics, food flavor and texture in assessing the association between taste dysfunction, poor oral intake and malnutrition in cancer patients. Both adult and child cancer patients should be counselled on the potential impact taste <b>and</b> <b>smell</b> dysfunction can have on their appetite and oral intake...|$|R
500|$|When an {{interviewer}} {{asked him to}} describe himself as a child, he replied that he was [...] "probably well-meaning and naive like all kids." [...] His passion for sea life {{can be traced to}} his childhood, when several films by French oceanographer Jacques Cousteau made a strong impression on him. He has said that Cousteau [...] "provided a view into that world", which he did not know existed. He liked to explore tide pools as a child, bringing home objects that [...] "should have been left there and that ended up dying <b>and</b> <b>smelling</b> really bad." [...] Also at a young age, Hillenburg developed his interest in art. His first drawing was of an orange slice. An illustration that he drew in third grade depicting [...] "a bunch of army men... kissing and hugging instead of fighting" [...] marked the first praise that he received for his work after his teacher commended it. [...] "Of course, this is 1970... She liked it because, I mean, obviously that {{was in the middle of}} [...] She was, I would imagine, not a hundred percent for the war like a lot of people then. ...I had no idea about the implications, really, because I just thought it was a funny idea. I remember that still, that moment when she said, 'oh my gosh, look at that,'" [...] Hillenburg elaborated. It was then when he knew that he [...] "had some [...] skill". Hillenburg asserted that his artistry comes from his mother's side, despite his father being a draftsman, noting that his maternal grandmother was [...] "really, really gifted" [...] and a [...] "great painter". In the 1970s, someone took him to the International Tournée of Animation at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Hillenburg was [...] "knocked out" [...] by the foreign animated films that were screened at the festival, including Dutch animator Paul Driessen's The Killing of an Egg (1977). [...] "That was the film that I thought was uniquely strange and that lodged itself in my head early on," [...] he recounted.|$|E

The ritual involves lighting a special havdalah candle with several wicks, blessing a cup of wine <b>and</b> <b>smelling</b> sweet spices. Shabbat ends on Saturday night after the appearance of three stars in the sky. Some communities delay the Havdalah in order to prolong Shabbat.|$|E
2500|$|Mr. Jenkins [...] Meg's {{high school}} {{principal}} in A Wrinkle in Time, who in A Wind in the Door has become the principal of Charles Wallace's elementary school instead, an apparent demotion. He is described as having dandruff <b>and</b> <b>smelling</b> of [...] "old hair cream." [...] He appears not to like or understand either Meg or Charles Wallace, and Meg in turn thinks of Mr. Jenkins as a failure and an obstacle, who believes in [...] "the law of the jungle". However, in A Wind in the Door, Jenkins notices Charles Wallace's physical weakness before Meg does, and Meg is reminded that he once secretly bought Calvin a [...] badly needed pair of shoes. Knowing these things helps Meg to [...] "Name" [...] Mr. Jenkins; i.e., to love and understand him, and help him to do the same. Meg eventually realizes that both she and Mr. Jenkins himself have consistently underestimated him. Once named, Mr. Jenkins joins Meg and Calvin O'Keefe on their quest to save Charles Wallace. He is a classic skeptic.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{his start}} of {{secondary}} studies {{coincided with the}} beginning of World War I in September 1914 shortly followed with the school's financial problems, managed by a severe headmaster. Bourguiba stated that back in that time, food was terrible: They served them a stew with squash and a macaroni at lunch while giving them a donut wrapped in newspaper <b>and</b> <b>smelling</b> oil, at breakfast. These terrible conditions led the students to protest, despite the headmaster's efforts to end the revolt. When he questioned Bourguiba, the young Habib denounced these horrible conditions, declaring that he did not deserve to be treated in this manner. Thinking {{that he was about to}} be punished, nothing happened and the young boy learned to dare, speak and denounce. He was also marked by the education he had and which started in him the germs of revolt. In his before final year, Bourguiba admired a talented student named Habib Jaouahdou. Jaouahdo explained to the pupils what was happening outside the walls of Sadiki and telling them all about the nationalist movement. His Arabic skills are reinforced by a marking professor: Mohamed Lasrem, who was as old as Bach Hamba and that Bourguiba remembered by saying: [...] "I have to recognize that it is thanks to him that we have learned, since then, to express ourselves and write in classical arabic. This language was, at first, taught, mainly in the form of various versions. We had to translate administrative letters".|$|E
