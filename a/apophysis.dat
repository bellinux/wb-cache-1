5|$|Wanless {{divided the}} genus Portia into two species groups: the schultzi group, in which males' palps have a fixed tibial apophysis; and the kenti group, {{in which the}} <b>apophysis</b> of each palp in the males has a joint {{separated}} by a membrane. The schultzi group includes P. schultzi, P. africana, P. fimbriata, and P. labiata.|$|E
5|$|The {{legs are}} reddish brown, or {{sometimes}} yellowish, with the femora of the anterior (first) pair being darker and enlarged, {{especially in the}} male. The anterior legs have three pairs of long spines on the ventral surface of the tibia and two pairs of spines on the metatarsus. The Peckhams give the following measurements for the lengths of the legs of a male specimen, starting with the anterior pair: 3.7mm, 2.2mm, 2mm, 3mm. In females, the fourth pair of legs are the longest. The pedipalp in the male has a single tibial <b>apophysis</b> which tapers gradually.|$|E
5|$|Geastrum pectinatum {{has been}} mistaken for the morphologically similar but smaller species G.schmidelii. The latter species lacks {{vertical}} striations on the basal {{portions of the}} endoperidium, and {{does not have a}} pseudoparenchymatous collar around the stem. Another similar species, G.berkeleyi, has a shorter stem and is missing the ridges {{at the base of the}} spore sac. Further, the color of its spore sac is usually brown, in contrast to the gray-blue of G.pectinatum. G.xerophilum also has a dusting of white powder on the surface of the spore sac, but unlike G.pectinatum, consistently lacks a ring at the base of the pedicel; furthermore, in contrast to G.pectinatum, the spores of G.xerophilum are yellow and contain oil drops that are readily observable with a microscope. G.striatum has smaller fruit bodies than G.pectinatum, and a distinct collar-like <b>apophysis.</b>|$|E

25|$|Male palpal bulbs are {{relatively}} simple in appearance, with a circular embolus, and are rather similar in different species. The palp usually has a simple retrolateral tibial <b>apophysis</b> with a blunt tip.|$|E
25|$|Apophysomyces variabilis {{resembles the}} other {{three members of the}} genus Apophysomyces but is {{characterized}} by the variable appearance of its sporangiospores and sporangiophores which range from club-shaped to trapezoidal to flattened spheres. The sporangiophore can measure up to 400μm in length and has a funnel-shaped <b>apophysis</b> or swelling below the columella. Hyphae are smooth-walled, aseptate, and branched.|$|E
25|$|Portia africana {{is one of}} 17 {{species in}} the genus Portia as of May 2011. Wanless divided the genus Portia into two species groups: the schultzi group, in which males' palps have a fixed tibial apophysis; and the kenti group, in which the <b>apophysis</b> of each palp in the males has a joint {{separated}} by a membrane. The schultzi group includes P. schultzi, P. africana, P. fimbriata, and P. labiata.|$|E
25|$|The calcitic {{shell is}} {{situated}} beneath the hinder {{part of the}} shield, and is perceptible through the skin. The color of the shell is whitish. The shape of the shell is oblong-oval and thin, slightly convex above, and correspondingly concave beneath, with a membranous margin. The apex or nucleus is at the posterior margin but inclined towards the left side, and forming the <b>apophysis</b> by which the shell is organically attached to the animal. The length of the shell is 13mm (1/2inch) and {{the width of the}} shell is 7mm (1/4inch). Shells of different Limacidae species are undiagnostic: in other words, they are not helpful for identification purpose.|$|E
500|$|P. fimbriata {{is one of}} 17 {{species in}} the genus Portia as of May 2016. Wanless divided the genus Portia into two [...] species groups: the schultzi group, in which males' palps have a fixed tibial apophysis; and the kenti group, in which the <b>apophysis</b> of each palp in the males has a joint {{separated}} by a membrane. The schultzi group includes P. schultzi, P. africana, P. fimbriata, and P. labiata.|$|E
500|$|The {{tough and}} {{membranous}} endoperidium comprising the spore sac, purple-brown {{in color and}} [...] tall by [...] wide, {{is supported by a}} small stalk—a pedicel—that is 3–4mm long by 7–10mm wide and which has a grooved (sulcate) <b>apophysis,</b> or swelling. This ring-shaped swelling is made of remnants from a tissue called the pseudoparenchymatous layer. When fresh, the pseudoparenchymatous layer is whitish in color, thick and fleshy; it dries to become brown to dark brown while shrinking and often splitting and peeling. The endoperidium may be —covered with fine, white, powder—although the presence of this characteristic has been noted as being somewhat variable. The spore sac is opened by a single [...] pore atop a conical [...] "beak", or peristome. The peristome is pectinate—made of tissue that resembles the teeth of a comb; the specific epithet is named after this characteristic. The peristome is [...] long, and comprises 20–32 distinct ridges. The mass of spores and surrounding cells within the sac, the gleba, is dark-brown, and becomes powdery in mature specimens. Internally, the endoperidium contains a structure called the columella that is narrowly conical in shape, whitish or pale brown, and extends more than halfway into the gleba. G.pectinatum has no distinguishable odor or taste; like other earthstar mushrooms, it is inedible, and of [...] "no alimentary interest".|$|E
6000|$|The duck of Vaucanson {{was still}} more remarkable. It {{was of the}} size of life, and so perfect an {{imitation}} of the living animal that all the spectators were deceived. It executed, says Brewster, all the natural movements and gestures, it ate and drank with avidity, performed all the quick motions of the head and throat which are peculiar to the duck, and like it muddled the water which it drank with its bill. It produced also the sound of quacking in the most natural manner. In the anatomical structure the artist exhibited the highest skill. Every bone in the real duck had its representative In the automaton, and its wings were anatomically exact. Every cavity, <b>apophysis,</b> and curvature was imitated, and each bone executed its proper movements. When corn was thrown down before it, the duck stretched out its neck to pick it up, swallowed, and digested it. {*1} ...|$|E

Young T. <b>apophysis</b> spiders have pink shading {{at the end}} of each leg, which fades with each moult. T. <b>apophysis</b> has an additional stridulating organ on the coxa of the second leg and thinner femora than T. blondi. The male T. <b>apophysis</b> has tibial apophyses (projections) - hence the species name. The ground colour of both sexes is coffee brown; the legs and opisthosoma have long scattered orange-brown hairs, with long orange hair on the femora. Mature males have a metallic sheen, described as [...] "wine red" [...] in colour, on the cephalothorax, the dorsal surface of the chelicerae, the pedipalps, and the coxa, trochanter and femur of the legs, as well as the patella of the first leg.|$|E
