2500|$|The {{proposed}} book outraged the Goldman family, who {{criticized the}} publisher for [...] "helping a murderer get his voice out there." [...] According to lawyers for Ron Goldman's family, the Goldmans planned {{to attempt to}} garnish any earnings Simpson might get from the book. Fred Goldman, Ron's father, was awarded $33.5 million by a jury in 1997 for the wrongful death of his son. However, Simpson never paid this judgment due to a California law that prevents pensions from being used to satisfy judgments, {{and the fact that}} the bulk of his income comes from his NFL pension. Goldman described the book and television interview as [...] "an all-time low" [...] and [...] "morally reprehensible to me... to think you <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> somebody airtime about how they would murder two people." [...] Patricia Schroeder, president and chief executive of the Association of American Publishers, felt that the book would [...] "stir an awful lot of debate and make the culture take a real look at itself, and that may not be unhealthy".|$|E
2500|$|The {{controversy}} drew sharp rebuttals from Law and Foreign Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam. In {{a speech}} at a forum organized by the Institute of Policy Studies, he argued that voters elect the President {{for the purpose of}} enabling him to exercise the discretionary powers granted to him under the Constitution, which means the President's accountability to the electorate is restricted to these matters. He then raised the argument that since Article 21(1) states that the President shall, [...] "in the exercise of his functions under this Constitution or any other written law, act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet or of a Minister acting under the general authority of the Cabinet", it would be unconstitutional for the President to speak on his own volition in the absence of Cabinet's advice. He also said that the President's constitutional position {{is similar to that of}} the British Monarch, quoting a letter of 4 December 1963 from the British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin to King Edward VIII in which it was stated that [...] "Ministers <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> an experienced Monarch who thoroughly understands and has always strictly observed constitutional limitations, a discretion to what he would say, and are content to take full responsibility knowing well that the Monarch will say nothing of which his Ministers would not approve". Shanmugam posed the question: [...] "If the purpose is to influence the Government, would the best approach be to go public, or would it be to speak to the Prime Minister– as is generally done?" ...|$|E

I would have worked for fifteen shillings a week. I walked the streets till my boots were worn through and my clothes hung around me like rags. It was bad luck at first--afterwards it was my clothes.

I suppose in the whole settlement there is not, with the exception of the man in authority, a single person who does not perceive that the situation is a dangerous one, and that no possible precaution should be omitted; and yet the man who is responsible for the safety of all throws cold water on every proposal, and snubs those who <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up time and labour in order to ensure the safety of the place.|$|E
