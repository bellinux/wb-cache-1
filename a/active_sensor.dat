50|$|Pyroelectric nanogenerator is {{expected}} to be applied for various applications where the time-dependent temperature fluctuation exists. One of the feasible applications of the pyroelectric nanogenerator is used as an <b>active</b> <b>sensor,</b> which can work without a battery. One example has been introduced by Professor Zhong Lin Wang's group in 2012 by using a pyroelectric nanogenerator as the self-powered temperature sensor for detecting a change in temperature, where the response time and reset time of the sensor are about 0.9 and 3 s, respectively. In general, the pyroelectric nanogenerator gives a high output voltage, but the output current is small. It not only {{can be used as a}} potential power source, but also as an <b>active</b> <b>sensor</b> for measuring temperature variation.|$|E
3000|$|Coverage {{problems}} have been extensively studied {{in the context of}} sensor networks (see, e.g., [1 – 4]).

50|$|<b>Active</b> <b>sensors</b> emit {{radiation}} in {{the direction}} of the object they are observing causing it to light up. To get a reading, it measures how much energy is reflected back at the <b>sensor.</b> Most <b>active</b> <b>sensors</b> are in the microwave part of the electromagnetic spectrum. This means that they are able to pass through almost any atmospheric condition.|$|R
50|$|In {{regard to}} sensors, {{airborne}} sensor operators work with either <b>active</b> <b>sensors</b> or passive <b>sensors.</b> The typical <b>active</b> <b>sensors</b> used by sensor operators are Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) and sonar. The typical passive sensors used by sensor operators are electro-optical/ infrared (EO/IR), Hyper-spectral, RGB cameras, Thermal cameras, magnetometers and communication/signal receivers.|$|R

50|$|The active {{pressure}} sensor and the integrated sensor array {{based on the}} triboelectric effect have several advantages over conventional passive {{pressure sensor}}s. First, the <b>active</b> <b>sensor</b> is capable of both static pressure sensing using the open-circuit voltage and dynamic pressure sensing using the short-circuit current, while conventional sensors are usually incapable of dynamic sensing to provide the loading rate information. Second, the prompt response of both static and dynamic sensing enables the revealing of details about the loading pressure. Third, the detection limit of the TENG for dynamic sensing is as low as 2.1 Pa, owing to the high output of the TENG. Fourth, the <b>active</b> <b>sensor</b> array presented in this work has no power consumption and could even be combined with its energy harvesting functionality for self-powered pressure mapping. Future works in this field involve the miniaturization of the pixel size to achieve higher spatial resolution, and {{the integration of the}} TEAS matrix onto fully flexible substrate for shape-adaptive pressure imaging.|$|E
50|$|Satellite {{remote sensing}} {{provides}} another {{important source of}} spatial data. Here satellites use different sensor packages to passively measure the reflectance from parts {{of the electromagnetic spectrum}} or radio waves that were sent out from an <b>active</b> <b>sensor</b> such as radar. Remote sensing collects raster data that can be further processed using different bands to identify objects and classes of interest, such as land cover.|$|E

50|$|TENG is a {{physical}} process of converting mechanical agitation to an electric signal through the triboelectrification (in inner circuit) and electrostatic induction processes (in outer circuit). This basic process has been demonstrated for two major applications. The first application is energy harvesting with a particular advantage of harvesting mechanical energy. The other application is {{to serve as a}} self-powered <b>active</b> <b>sensor,</b> because it does not need an external power source to drive.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{multi-sensor}} AF cameras allow {{manual selection}} of the <b>active</b> <b>sensor,</b> and many offer automatic {{selection of the}} sensor using algorithms which attempt to discern {{the location of the}} subject.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{consider}} a many-to-one sensor network where {{a large number}} of sensors are deployed to monitor a physical environment. We explore sensor activity management to maximize the network lifetime, while meeting the quality-of-service (QoS) requirement. Specifically, in each round the sink estimates the number of <b>active</b> <b>sensors</b> and the control information is fed back to the sensors for activity control. We start with a basic case where the total number of sensors is known, and the estimator of the number of <b>active</b> <b>sensors</b> ” is accurate. We devise a sensor activity control scheme under which the number of <b>active</b> <b>sensors</b> would converge to the minimum that can meet the QoS requirement. Next, we generalize the study to the following two more complicated cases: (1) The case with known and inaccurate ”: For this case, we propose a stochastic approximation algorithm to minimize the average number of <b>active</b> <b>sensors</b> while meeting the QoS requirement. (2) The case with unknown and accurate ” : For this case, we cast the problem as the adaptive control of a Markov chain with unknown parameters and propose a composite optimization-oriented approach for the corresponding sensor activity control. We show that using this composite optimization-oriented approach the number of <b>active</b> <b>sensors</b> would converge to the minimum that can meet the QoS requirement.

40|$|Abstract—Sensor {{networks}} {{have been deployed}} for many barrier coverage applications such as intrusion detection and border surveillance. In these applications, {{it is critical to}} operate a sensor network in an energy-efficient manner so the barrier can be covered with as few <b>active</b> <b>sensors</b> as possible. In this paper, we study barrier information coverage which exploits collaborations and information fusion between neighboring sensors {{to reduce the number of}} <b>active</b> <b>sensors</b> needed to cover a barrier and hence to prolong the network lifetime. Moreover, we propose a practical solution to identify the barrier information coverage set which can information-cover the barrier with a small number of <b>active</b> <b>sensors.</b> The effectiveness of the proposed solution is demonstrated by numerical and simulation results.

50|$|Sensors are {{classified}} into three categories: passive, omnidirectional sensors; passive, narrow-beam sensors; and <b>active</b> <b>sensors.</b> Passive sensors sense the data without actually manipulating the environment by active probing. They are self powered; that is, energy is needed only to amplify their analog signal. <b>Active</b> <b>sensors</b> actively probe the environment, for example, a sonar or radar sensor, and they require continuous energy from a power source. Narrow-beam sensors have a well-defined notion of direction of measurement, {{similar to a}} camera. Omnidirectional sensors have no notion of direction involved in their measurements.|$|R
50|$|The system {{includes}} a 3D <b>active</b> <b>sensor,</b> a thermal imager and Neptec's model based tracking software. Using only {{knowledge about the}} target spacecraft's geometry and 3D data acquired from the sensor, the system computes the 6 Degree Of Freedom (6DOF) relative pose directly. The computer vision algorithms developed by Neptec allow this process to happen in real-time on a flight computer while achieving the necessary robustness and reliability expected for mission critical operations. Fast data acquisition has been achieved by implementing a smart scanning strategy referred to as More Information Less Data (MILD) where only the necessary data to perform the pose estimation is acquired by the sensor. This strategy minimizes the requirements on acquisition time, data bandwidth, memory and processing power.|$|E
5000|$|The MQ-4C {{can stay}} aloft for over 30 hours at 55,000 ft at speeds {{of up to}} [...] Its {{surveillance}} sensor is the AN/ZPY-3 Multi-Function <b>Active</b> <b>Sensor</b> (MFAS) X-band AESA radar with a 360-degree field-of-regard, capable of surveying 2,700,000 mi2 km2 of sea (as well as shoreline or land), or 2,000 mi2 km2 in a single sweep. Using the radar in inverse synthetic aperture mode, the MFAS can identify a target in any weather condition and take high definition radar pictures, then use the advanced image and radar return recognition software of the onboard automatic identification system (AIS) to classify it without the aircraft operators needing to. The Triton is made to be semi-autonomous to conserve manpower, so operators only have to pick an area for the aircraft to fly in and set speed, altitude, and objective rather than actually operating controls.|$|E
40|$|Your task is {{to detect}} a {{submarine}} with your active sonar. The submarine can hear your active sonar before you can detect him. If the submarine is fast enough he can evade you before you can detect him. How do you then detect him? If you are using your active sonar continuously you will not detect him. Likewise, {{if you are not}} using your sonar at all. In between those two extremes there is an optimum. We will find that optimum. Or said more precisely and general: In the same two dimensional region two platforms are present. One platform, the searcher, equipped with one <b>active</b> <b>sensor</b> (sonar, radar, lidar etc.), is trying to detect the other platform, the target, by means of its <b>active</b> <b>sensor.</b> The target tries to avoid detection using only a passive sensor to detect the searcher. The target can detect the <b>active</b> <b>sensor</b> before the searcher can detect the target (forestalling). The <b>active</b> <b>sensor</b> is therefore used intermittently to surprise the target. The aim {{of this study is to}} quantify the passive period of the <b>active</b> <b>sensor</b> by minimizing missed detection opportunities. The active period is subsequently found by maximizing the average detection width of the searcher sensor over time. Comment: Key words: <b>Active</b> <b>sensor.</b> Sonar. Radar. Lidar.

40|$|Abstract—In this article, {{we propose}} an {{energy-efficient}} data gathering scheme for {{wireless sensor network}} called Sleep-Route, which splits the sensor nodes into two sets – active and dormant (low-power sleep). Only the active set of sensor nodes participate in data collection. The sensing values of the dormant sensor nodes are predicted {{with the help of}} an <b>active</b> <b>sensor</b> node. Virtual Sensing Framework (VSF) provides the mechanism to predict the sensing values by exploiting the data correlation among the sensor nodes. If the number of <b>active</b> <b>sensor</b> nodes can be minimized, a lot of energy can be saved. The active nodes ’ selection must fulfill the following constraints- (i) the set of active nodes are sufficient to predict the sensing values of the dormant nodes, (ii) each <b>active</b> <b>sensor</b> nodes can report their data to the sink node (directly or through some other active node(s)).

40|$|In {{wireless}} {{sensor network}} applications where data gathered by different sensor nodes is correlated, not all sensor nodes need to be active for the {{wireless sensor network}} to be functional. Given that the sensor nodes that are selected as active form a connected wireless network, the inactive sensor nodes can be turned off. Allowing some sensor nodes to be active and some sensor nodes inactive interchangably during the lifecycle of the application helps the wireless sensor network to have a longer lifetime. The problem of determining a set of <b>active</b> <b>sensor</b> nodes in a correlated data environment for a fully operational wireless sensor network can be formulated as an instance of the connected correlation-dominating set problem. In this work, our contribution is twofold; we propose an effective and runtime-efficient iterative improvement heuristic to solve the <b>active</b> <b>sensor</b> node determination problem, and a benefit function that aims to minimize the number of <b>active</b> <b>sensor</b> nodes while maximizing the residual energy levels of the selected <b>active</b> <b>sensor</b> nodes.
