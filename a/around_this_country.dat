The resulting patchwork of doctrinal approaches provides little clarity for courts and only illusory protection for teachers. This Note will start from scratch, examining the first principles at play in public school classrooms and tailoring a First Amendment approach to respect the needs of government, teachers, and students. When determining if the First Amendment protects classroom speech, the teacher’s interest in speaking on matters of legitimate pedagogical concern should be balanced against the school’s interest in providing an effective educational environment...|$|E

40|$|We {{examined}} the efficacies of the,I-lactam-p-lactamase inhibitor combinations ampicillin-sulbactam and piperacillin-tazobactam {{in the treatment}} of intra-abdominal abscesses caused by a TEM- 26 -producing strain ofKlebsie 1 la pneumoniae. At lower doses, both combinations reduced abscess colony counts by more than 3 log 1 o CFU/g from that of untreated controls, but treatment with these drugs was inferior to treatment with imipenem. Increasing the doses of the combinations resulted in a further decrease in abscess CFU to a level where both were similar to imipenem in efficacy. These results suggest that the f 1 -lactam- 1 i-lactamase inhibitor combinations ampicillin-sulbactam and piperacillin-tazobactam may be viable alternatives for the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible extended-spectrum P-lactamase-producing strains ofK. pneumoniae. Strains of Kiebsiella pneumoniae resistant to extended-spec-trum cephalosporins by virtue of the production of extended-spectrum, 3 -lactamases are becoming increasingly common in hospitals <b>around</b> <b>this</b> <b>country</b> (3).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Colombia and Brazil are {{affected}} by severe cases of scorpionism. In Colombia the most dangerous accidents are caused by Tityus pachyurus that is widely distributed <b>around</b> <b>this</b> <b>country.</b> In the Brazilian Amazonian region scorpion stings are a common event caused by Tityus obscurus. The main objective of this work was to perform the molecular cloning of the putative Na(+) -channel scorpion toxins (NaScTxs) from T. pachyurus and T. obscurus venom glands and to analyze their phylogenetic relationship with other known NaScTxs from Tityus species. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: cDNA libraries from venom glands of these two species were constructed and five nucleotide sequences from T. pachyurus were identified as putative modulators of Na(+) -channels, and were named Tpa 4, Tpa 5, Tpa 6, Tpa 7 and Tpa 8; the latter being the first anti-insect excitatory β-class NaScTx in Tityus scorpion venom to be described. Fifteen sequences from T. obscurus were identified as putative NaScTxs, among which three had been previously described, {{and the others were}} named To 4 to To 15. The peptides Tpa 4, Tpa 5, Tpa 6, To 6, To 7, To 9, To 10 and To 14 are closely related to the α-class NaScTxs, whereas Tpa 7, Tpa 8, To 4, To 8, To 12 and To 15 sequences are more related to the β-class NaScTxs. To 5 is possibly an arthropod specific toxin. To 11 and To 13 share sequence similarities with both α and β NaScTxs. By means of phylogenetic analysis using the Maximum Parsimony method and the known NaScTxs from Tityus species, these toxins were clustered into 14 distinct groups. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This communication describes new putative NaScTxs from T. pachyurus and T. obscurus and their phylogenetic analysis. The results indicate clear geographic separation between scorpions of Tityus genus inhabiting the Amazonian and Mountain Andes regions and those distributed over the Southern of the Amazonian rainforest. Based on the consensus sequences for the different clusters, a new nomenclature for the NaScTxs is proposed...|$|E
