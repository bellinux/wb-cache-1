Another was to suspend the bomb in a tank of water. As with Jumbo, it was decided not to proceed with these means of containment either.

30|$|To {{characterize}} the electrochemical {{behavior of the}} button-type supercapacitor based on graphene/MnO 2 composites, we have carried out cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (CD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests using a two-electrode system. To avoid complex steps, we adopted a simple method of dipping directly the as-prepared Ni-foam into the suspension of graphene/MnO 2 composite, carbon black, and PTFE to prepare electrode slices. This method is simple to operate, and the <b>active</b> <b>materials</b> {{are not easy to}} fall off once they have been coated on Ni-foam. Furthermore, the <b>active</b> <b>materials</b> are relatively well distributed. However, there is also a disadvantage, that is, it is hard to control the mass of the <b>active</b> <b>materials.</b> Hence, we cannot get the difference in specific capacitance directly just by looking at the CV and CD diagrams since the mass of the <b>active</b> <b>materials</b> is different in those three samples. Nonetheless, the mass of the <b>active</b> <b>materials</b> can be calculated out by comparatively weighing the Ni-foam before and after coating the <b>active</b> <b>materials,</b> and the specific capacitance can be therefore obtained for each supercapacitor device.|$|R
50|$|Solid {{dispersion}} {{redox flow}} battery is one {{specific type of}} redox flow battery using dispersed solid <b>active</b> <b>materials</b> as the energy storage media. The solid suspensions are stored in energy storage tanks and pumped through electrochemical cells while charging or discharging. In comparison with a conventional redox flow battery where active species are dissolved in aqueous or organic electrolyte, the <b>active</b> <b>materials</b> in a solid dispersion redox flow battery maintain the solid form and are suspended in the electrolyte. The solid <b>active</b> <b>materials,</b> especially with <b>active</b> <b>materials</b> from lithium-ion battery, can help the suspensions achieve much higher energy densities than conventional redox flow batteries. This concept is similar to semi-solid flow batteries in which slurries of <b>active</b> <b>materials</b> accompanied by conductive carbon additives to facilitate electrons conducting are stored in energy storage tanks and pumped through the electrochemical reaction cells.|$|R

[...] In the meantime, the CM Division experimented with uranium hydride.

500|$|Groves did not {{relish the}} {{prospect}} of explaining {{the loss of a}} billion dollars worth of plutonium to a Senate committee, so a cylindrical containment vessel codenamed [...] "Jumbo" [...] was constructed to recover the <b>active</b> <b>material</b> {{in the event of a}} failure.

By the time it arrived, confidence in the implosion method was high enough, and the availability of plutonium was sufficient, that Oppenheimer decided not to use it. Instead, it was placed atop a steel tower [...] from the weapon as a rough measure of how powerful the explosion would be. In the end, Jumbo survived, although its tower did not, adding credence to the belief that Jumbo would have successfully contained a fizzled explosion.|$|E

Nor would Harwell have been able to handle them if they had; a [...] "hot" [...] radioactive laboratory was not built until 1949, although a small hot laboratory was pressed into service in 1948. A pilot plant was established at the Chalk River Laboratories, which ran until 1950. [...] Despite concerns over whether the process would work, numerous minor changes, and construction problems related to the steel used, the plant was completed on schedule in April 1951. The first <b>active</b> <b>material</b> was fed into the plant on 25 February 1952. The plant performed well for twelve years, exceeding its designed production targets, and was only decommissioned when a larger facility was required.

Micromechanics analysis of heterogeneous materials based on finite element method is a typically numerical way to study the thermal-mechanical behaviors of soft <b>active</b> <b>materials</b> with phase evolution. While the constitutive models that can precisely describe the stress and strain fields of materials {{in the process of}} phase evolution can not be found in the databases of some commercial finite element analysis (FEA) tools such as ANSYS or Abaqus, even the specific constitutive behavior for each individual phase either the new formed one or the original one has already been well-known. So developing a computationally efficient and general three dimensional (3 D) thermal-mechanical constitutive model for soft <b>active</b> <b>materials</b> with phase evolution which can be implemented into FEA is eagerly demanded. This paper first solved this problem theoretically by recording the deformation history of each individual phase in the phase evolution process, and adopted the idea of effectiveness by regarding all the new formed phase as an effective phase with an effective deformation to make this theory computationally efficient. A user material subroutine (UMAT) code based on this theoretical constitutive model has been finished in this work which can be added into the material database in Abaqus or ANSYS and can be easily used for most soft <b>active</b> <b>materials</b> with phase evolution. Model validation also has been done through comparison between micromechanical FEA and experiments on a particular composite material, shape memory elastomeric composite (SMEC) which consisted of an elastomeric matrix and the crystallizable fibre.
