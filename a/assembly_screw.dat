40|$|Real complex {{assemblies}} have {{to deliver}} {{large number of}} customer requirements. Assemblies in general have many parts which work together to deliver those requirements. The involvement of many parts and presence of many requirements to be delivered, results in the involvement of {{a part in the}} delivery chains of more than one requirement. As a result most of the requirements are not delivered independently. Coupling among the requirements makes it hard to achieve all the requirements with in their respective tolerance limits. The thesis gives classification of nature of relationships that can exist among various requirements. It discusses characteristic of each relationship and how it can affect the robustness of an assembly. When the requirements in the assembly are conflicting, i. e. reduction in variation in one of the requirements increases variation in conflicting requirement, it tends to become non-robust. Non-robust assemblies entail high manufacturing costs. Aim of the thesis is to identify the scenarios of conflict in the <b>assembly.</b> <b>Screw</b> theory ca...|$|E

40|$|A {{connector}} retainer {{and mounting}} {{system has been}} designed to replace screw-mounting of Winchester connectors. Countersunk screws are normally used to secure connectors to structures, and to keep them from coming apart. These screws are normally put into threaded or through-holes in metallic structures.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is present tools which support the {{top-down}} design process for assemblies by analyzing the locating scheme or constraint structure of assemblies in absence of detailed level part geometry. The top-down design process has received attention both in academia and industry. However, {{there have been few}} analytical tools to support it. The bottom-up approach supported by CAD systems is good for detailed level design of a single part. The representation and manipulation of assemblies involves structural and spatial relationships between individual parts at a higher level of abstraction than the representation of single parts. This thesis uses the Datum Flow Chain (DFC) for symbolic representation of mechanical <b>assemblies</b> and <b>screw</b> theory for representation of constraints between two parts. DFC captures the design intent by recording location scheme of <b>assemblies.</b> <b>Screw</b> theory can represent constraints in three dimensions. This thesis presents the design steps and corresponding analytical tools for a top-down design process in a logical progressive way. The approach of bottom-up process supported by CAD systems is compared all along the presentation. A method to generate the screw theory representation of relative constraints between two arbitrary contacting surfaces is presented first. A procedure has been outlined to generate the screw representation of an assembly feature constructed by several contacting surface pairs. These tools can be used to construct screw theory representation of an arbitrarily complex assembly feature. A method of finding the constraint properties of <b>assemblies,</b> which uses <b>screw</b> theory, is presented next. The method of motion analysis can find under-constraints for all assemblies. This can be used for analysis of instantaneous kinematics of a general mechanism as well. Finding over-constraints in an assembly is a separate problem and it requires different procedure of analysis than motion analysis. This thesis presents a method of finding over-constraints of assemblies. Quantitative information about over-constraint of all assemblies may not be found in cross-coupled assemblies. Motion and constraint analyses can help assembly designers in evaluating the nominal design. A method to calculate the sensitivity of the location of a part due to variation in the location of an assembly feature is presented next. This method uses the screw theory representation of constraints and information about location of assembly features. Clearance is introduced on bi-directional assembly features to reduce the probability of interference but it introduces uncertainty in the location of parts. A method is proposed to analyze uncertainty in the location of parts due to clearance on the size dimensions of assembly features. These analysis tools can be used to check robustness of the nominal design. A classification of assemblies based upon constraint properties is presented next. This classification relates properties of constraint structure of assemblies to design context. Finally, this thesis lays out a coherent scheme of design steps forming a procedure for designing mechanical assemblies in a top-down fashion. by Gaurav Shukla. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|International audienceIn {{tolerance}} analysis, approaches {{based on}} sets of constraints (also called convex hull techniques) {{are able to}} study simultaneously all the possible extreme configurations of a mechanism when simulating manufacturing defects in its components. The accumulation of these defects can be calculated by summing and intersecting 6 -dimensional sets of constraints, i. e. polyhedra.

Screw presses are {{exclusively}} {{used for}} extraction {{of oil from}} vegetable seeds; having a mechanical <b>assembly</b> where <b>screw</b> shaft is used to press the seeds at high pressures {{in order to have}} a reasonable oil yield. Mostly conventional screw presses are used in the commercial and industrial sectors having high O&M costs and hence less life. For this purpose an efficient small scale screw press was selected for this study. The objective was to apply the optimization techniques {{in order to have a}} set of optimized decision variables satisfying certain constraints to get the maximum oil yield. The software used for linear optimization was TORA TM Version 2. 00. The objective function was to maximize the oil yield. The decision variables comprised of seed input, screw speed, motor power, die opening size, total pressure and temperature. Constraints were accordingly defined for each variable and the data was fed to TORA’s input grid. The solver menu used the simplex starting all-slack method to solve the LP model. The output of the model selected the optimized variables which resulted in maximum oil yield. To include the losses incurred in the screw press a loss function was developed including the heat losses, mechanical/inertial losses and seed cake losses.

However, {{little is known about}} the factors influencing the stability of the screw-abutment complex. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of lubricant action during implant <b>assembly</b> on <b>screw</b> preload and stresses in a dental implant-abutment complex. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A dental implant was modeled for finite element stress analysis. Different friction coefficients (μ= 0. 2 to 0. 5) were chosen for the interfaces between implant components to simulate lubricant action or dry conditions. The stress analyses were each divided into 2 load steps. First, the abutment screw was virtually tightened with a torque of 25 Ncm. This was achieved by applying an equivalent preload calculated according to the different friction coefficients chosen. Second, the construction was externally loaded with a force of 200 N inclined by 30 degrees relative to the implant axis. RESULTS: The screw preload increased with the decreasing friction coefficient. In all components, stresses increased with decreasing friction coefficient. Plastic deformation was observed at the implant neck in an area that expanded with decreasing friction coefficient. No plastic deformation occurred in the abutment. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicated that screw preload should be included in the finite element analysis of dental implants for a realistic evaluation of stresses in the implant-abutment complex. The friction coefficient significantly influenced the screw preload value and modified the stresses in the implant-abutment complex...|$|R

An analysis of 3 D finite elements was performed to {{evaluate the}} distribution of the equivalent stress (triple stress state) in a Schanz screw fixed bicortically and orthogonally to a tubular bone, using two mounting patterns: (1) thread/shaft transition located 20 mm from the anchorage of the Schanz screws in {{the entrance to the}} bone cortex and (2) thread/shaft transition located 3 mm from the anchorage of the Schanz screws in entrance to the bone cortex. The simulations were performed maintaining the same direction of loading and the same distance from the force vector in relation {{to the center of the}} hypothetical bone. The load applied, its direction, and the distance to the center of the bone were constant during the simulations in order to maintain the moment of flexion equally constant. The present calculations demonstrated linear behavior during the experiment. It was found that the model with a distance of 20 mm between the Schanz screws anchorage in the entrance to the bone cortex and the thread/shaft transition reduces the risk of breakage or fatigue of the material during the application of constant static loads; in this model, the maximum forces observed were higher (350 MPa). The distance between the Schanz screws anchorage at the entrance to the bone cortex and the smooth thread/shaft transition of the screws used in a femoral distractor during acute distraction of a fracture must be farther from the entrance to the bone cortex, allowing greater degree of elastic deformation of the material, lower mechanical stress in the thread/shaft transition, and minimized breakage or fatigue.

The CD instrumentation is based on segmentation of curves, thus improving the angular correction and actuates sagittal profile. Sublaminar acrylic loops (Universal Clamp) shows the same resistance to stress as steel or titanium alloy sublaminar wires.

The authors treated surgically 84 patients affected by neurologic scoliosis with an average age of 14  years (range 10 – 17). Universal Clamps associated with Socore TM spinal <b>assembly,</b> transpedicular lumbar <b>screws</b> and thoracic hooks at the upper end of the curve were used. The etiology of disease was cerebral palsy in 81 cases, Friedreich ataxia in two cases and Aicardi syndrome in one case. The average preoperative angular value was 73 ° ±  16 °. It was implanted a mean of seven Clamps for each procedure (range 5 – 9). The average percentage of correction was 72 %. Mean operative time was 240  ±  30  min with mean blood loss of 1200  ±  400  ml. No intra-operative complications occurred. Mean follow-up was 36  months. At one-year follow-up the mean loss of correction was 7 ° ±  2 ° with no re-intervention required. This is the first report on treatment of neurological scoliosis with this hybrid construct (lumbar screws, thoracic acrylic clamps, thoracic hooks at the upper end of the curve). In this group of patients the Universal Clamps technique appeared safe and effective and its mechanical performance is comparable to all-level screws construct. Furthermore, the kyphotic component can be better managed in case of thoracic lordosis. The most important aspect of this technique is a short operative time and low vascular and neurologic risks combined with a satisfying stability in the short-postoperative period.

The AK type magazines can be modified to lock in place, but cartridges may not feed because the Saiga's receiver lacks a bullet guide. The bullet guide allows a round to be pulled from a magazine and then fed into the chamber without being caught on the front trunnion; this bullet guide is specifically built on the lip of the Saiga magazine. Any magazine used that does not have this feature may not feed reliably in the rifle.Another difference of some later model Saigas is that they have a bolt hold open button. The Saiga bolt hold open is engaged by manually pressing a lever near the trigger guard and pulling the charging handle rearward although this feature does not automatically hold the rifle's action open after the last round is fired as seen on the AR-15. Most versions of the rifle lack a pistol grip and don't have a threaded front sight block, making it unable to accept muzzle devices. The trigger and trigger guard of most of the US versions are placed farther back on the receiver than on a typical AK series rifle, and a transfer bar type system is used to release the hammer. This results in the Saiga to have a considerably heavier and grittier trigger pull than that of other Kalashnikov-made firearms.|$|R
