5|$|Digestion {{starts in}} buccal cavity (mouth) as {{partially}} chewed food is {{broken down by}} saliva from the salivary glands. As the salivary glands produce fluid and carbohydrate-digesting enzymes (mostly <b>amylases),</b> strong muscles in the pharynx pump fluid into the buccal cavity, lubricating the food like the salivarium does, and helping blood feeders, and xylem and phloem feeders.|$|E
5|$|Fungi {{are used}} {{extensively}} to produce industrial chemicals like citric, gluconic, lactic, and malic acids, and industrial enzymes, such as lipases used in biological detergents, cellulases used in making cellulosic ethanol and stonewashed jeans, and <b>amylases,</b> invertases, proteases and xylanases. Several species, most notably Psilocybin mushrooms (colloquially known as magic mushrooms), are ingested for their psychedelic properties, both recreationally and religiously.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} function of enzymes {{is in the}} digestive systems of animals. Enzymes such as <b>amylases</b> and proteases break down large molecules (starch or proteins, respectively) into smaller ones, {{so they can be}} absorbed by the intestines. Starch molecules, for example, are too large to be absorbed from the intestine, but enzymes hydrolyze the starch chains into smaller molecules such as maltose and eventually glucose, which can then be absorbed. Different enzymes digest different food substances. In ruminants, which have herbivorous diets, microorganisms in the gut produce another enzyme, cellulase, to break down the cellulose cell walls of plant fiber.|$|E
5|$|Yeasts {{have been}} used since ancient times to leaven bread and to ferment beer and wine. More recently, fungi {{have been used}} {{for a wide variety of}} {{industrial}} fermentations, whether working directly for their effects on materials such as processing paper pulp or bioremediating industrial waste, or serving as the source of enzymes for many purposes, such as fading and softening denim for fashionable blue jeans. Fungi yield a wide variety of industrial enzymes including <b>amylases,</b> invertases, cellulases and hemicellulases, pectinases, proteases, laccases, phytases, alpha-glucuronidases, mannanases, and lipases.|$|E
25|$|In human physiology, {{both the}} salivary and {{pancreatic}} <b>amylases</b> are α-amylases.|$|E
25|$|<b>Amylases</b> {{are used}} in {{breadmaking}} and to break down complex sugars, such as starch (found in flour), into simple sugars. Yeast then feeds on these simple sugars and converts it into the waste products of alcohol and CO2. This imparts flavour and causes the bread to rise. While <b>amylases</b> are found naturally in yeast cells, it takes time for the yeast to produce enough of these enzymes to break down significant quantities of starch in the bread. This {{is the reason for}} long fermented doughs such as sour dough. Modern breadmaking techniques have included <b>amylases</b> (often in the form of malted barley) into bread improver, thereby making the process faster and more practical for commercial use.|$|E
25|$|Dextrins can be {{produced}} from starch using enzymes like <b>amylases,</b> as during digestion {{in the human body}} and during malting and mashing, or by applying dry heat under acidic conditions (pyrolysis or roasting). The latter process is used industrially, and also occurs on the surface of bread during the baking process, contributing to flavor, color and crispness. Dextrins produced by heat are also known as pyrodextrins. The starch hydrolyses during roasting under acidic conditions, and short-chained starch parts partially rebranch with α-(1,6) bonds to the degraded starch molecule. See also Maillard Reaction.|$|E
25|$|The {{first section}} of the {{alimentary}} canal is the foregut (element 27 in numbered diagram), or stomodaeum. The foregut is lined with a cuticular lining made of chitin and proteins as protection from tough food. The foregut includes the buccal cavity (mouth), pharynx, esophagus, and Crop and proventriculus (any part may be highly modified), which both store food and signify when to continue passing onward to the midgut. Here, digestion starts as partially chewed food is broken down by saliva from the salivary glands. As the salivary glands produce fluid and carbohydrate-digesting enzymes (mostly <b>amylases),</b> strong muscles in the pharynx pump fluid into the buccal cavity, lubricating the food like the salivarium does, and helping blood feeders, and xylem and phloem feeders.|$|E
500|$|Extremophile archaea, {{particularly}} those resistant either to heat or to extremes of acidity and alkalinity, {{are a source}} of enzymes that function under these harsh conditions. These enzymes have found many uses. For example, thermostable DNA polymerases, such as the Pfu DNA polymerase from Pyrococcus furiosus, revolutionized molecular biology by allowing the polymerase chain reaction to be used in research as a simple and rapid technique for cloning DNA. In industry, <b>amylases,</b> galactosidases and pullulanases in other species of Pyrococcus that function at over [...] allow food processing at high temperatures, such as the production of low lactose milk and whey. Enzymes from these thermophilic archaea also tend to be very stable in organic solvents, allowing their use in environmentally friendly processes in green chemistry that synthesize organic compounds. This stability makes them easier to use in structural biology. Consequently, the counterparts of bacterial or eukaryotic enzymes from extremophile archaea are often used in structural studies.|$|E

(alternative names: Glucan 1,4-α-glucosidase; amyloglucosidase; Exo-1,4-α-glucosidase; glucoamylase; {{lysosomal}} α-glucosidase; 1,4-α-D-glucan glucohydrolase) will cleave α(1–6) glycosidic linkages, {{as well as}} {{the last}} α(1–4)glycosidic linkages at the nonreducing end of amylose and amylopectin, yielding glucose. The γ-amylase has most acidic optimum pH of all <b>amylases</b> because it is most active around pH 3.|$|E
2500|$|Alpha and beta <b>amylases</b> are {{important}} in brewing beer and liquor made from sugars derived from starch. [...] In fermentation, yeast ingest sugars and excrete alcohol. [...] In beer and some liquors, the sugars present {{at the beginning of}} fermentation have been produced by [...] "mashing" [...] grains or other starch sources (such as potatoes). [...] In traditional beer brewing, malted barley is mixed with hot water to create a [...] "mash," [...] which is held at a given temperature to allow the <b>amylases</b> in the malted grain to convert the barley's starch into sugars. [...] Different temperatures optimize the activity of alpha or beta amylase, resulting in different mixtures of fermentable and unfermentable sugars. [...] In selecting mash temperature and grain-to-water ratio, a brewer can change the alcohol content, mouthfeel, aroma, and flavor of the finished beer.|$|E
2500|$|Eggs {{are tiny}} and oval-shaped, {{remaining}} {{the same size}} for around a week.

Larvae measure [...] They show a similar appearance to S. geminata larvae, but they can be distinguished by the integument with spinules on top of the dorsal portion of the posterior somites. The body hairs measure [...] with a denticulate tip. The antennae both have two or three sensilla. The labrum is smaller with two hairs on the anterior surface that are [...] The maxilla has a sclerotised band between the cardo and stipes. The [...] also has a small sclerotised band. The tubes of the labial glands are known to produce or secrete a proteinaceous substance that has a rich level of digestive enzymes, which includes proteases and <b>amylases</b> that function as an extraintestinal digestion of solid food. The midgut also contains <b>amylases,</b> roteases and upases. The narrow cells in its reservoir have little to no function in secretion. The pupae resemble adults of any caste, except that their legs and antennae are held tightly against the body. They appear white, but over time, the pupae turns darker when they are almost ready to mature.|$|E
2500|$|Because many Archaea {{have adapted}} to life in extreme environments such as polar regions, hot springs, acidic springs, {{alkaline}} springs, salt lakes, and the high pressure of deep ocean water, they possess enzymes that are functional under quite unusual conditions. [...] These enzymes are of potential use in the food, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries, where biotechnological processes frequently involve high temperatures, extremes of pH, high salt concentrations, and / or high pressure. [...] Examples of enzymes identified to date include <b>amylases,</b> pullulanases, cyclodextrin glycosyltransferases, cellulases, xylanases, chitinases, proteases, alcohol dehydrogenase, and esterases. [...] Archaea represent a source of novel chemical compounds also, for example isoprenyl glycerol ethers 1 and 2 from Thermococcus S557 and Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, respectively.|$|E
2500|$|An amylase (...) is {{an enzyme}} that catalyses the {{hydrolysis}} of starch into sugars. Amylase {{is present in}} the saliva of humans and some other mammals, where it begins the chemical process of digestion. Foods that contain large amounts of starch but little sugar, such as rice and potatoes, may acquire a slightly sweet taste as they are chewed because amylase degrades some of their starch into sugar. The pancreas and salivary gland make amylase (alpha amylase) to hydrolyse dietary starch into disaccharides and trisaccharides which are converted by other enzymes to glucose to supply the body with energy. Plants and some bacteria also produce amylase. As diastase, amylase was the first enzyme to be discovered and isolated (by Anselme Payen in 1833). [...] Specific amylase proteins are designated by different Greek letters. All <b>amylases</b> are glycoside hydrolases and act on α-1,4-glycosidic bonds.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Amylases</b> are a {{group of}} {{extracellular}} enzymes (glycoside hydrolases) that catalyze the hydrolysis of starch into maltose. These enzymes are grouped into three classes based on their amino acid sequences, mechanism of reaction, method of catalysis and their structure. [...] The different classes of <b>amylases</b> are α-amylases, β-amylases, and glucoamylases. The α-amylases hydrolyze starch by randomly cleaving the 1,4-a-D-glucosidic linkages between glucose units, β-amylases cleave non-reducing chain ends of components of starch such as amylose, and glucoamylases hydrolyze glucose molecules from the ends of amylose and amylopectin. <b>Amylases</b> are critically important extracellular enzymes and are found in plants, animals and micro-organisms. In humans, <b>amylases</b> are secreted by both the pancreas and salivary glands with both sources of the enzyme required for complete starch hydrolysis.|$|E

50|$|While rye {{and wheat}} are genetically similar enough to interbreed (resulting in hybrids known as triticale), their biochemistries differ {{enough that they}} affect the {{breadmaking}} process. The key issue is differing <b>amylases,</b> the enzyme which breaks starch down into sugar. While wheat <b>amylases</b> are generally not heat-stable and thus do not affect stronger wheat gluten that gives wheat bread its structure, rye amylase remains active at substantially higher temperatures. Since rye gluten (secalin) is not particularly strong, rye dough structure is based on complex polysaccharides, including rye starch and pentosans. As a result, <b>amylases</b> in rye flour can break down dough structure, inhibiting it from rising.|$|E
50|$|Note {{that the}} <b>amylases</b> used in brewing reach their peak {{efficiencies}} around 66 °C.|$|E
