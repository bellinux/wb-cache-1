5|$|For example, between 1985 and 1991, over 75 public {{officials}} {{were convicted of}} corruption offenses in the Southern District of West Virginia alone.

5|$|In 1892, the Interstate Commerce Commission {{agreed with}} the city after it filed a {{complaint}} about these practices, but that decision was struck down by <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> <b>court.</b> In 1906, Spokane sued under the newly passed Hepburn Act, and won on July 24, 1911.|$|E

5000|$|Lapides v. Board of Regents of University System of Georgia, , is a {{decision}} by the Supreme Court of the United States which ruled that a state voluntarily waives at least part of its Eleventh Amendment immunity when it invokes <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> <b>court's</b> removal jurisdiction.

5|$|A more narrow bail-in process {{pertaining}} to federal observer certification is prescribed in Section 3(a). Under this provision, <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> <b>court</b> may certify a non-covered jurisdiction to receive federal observers {{if the court}} determines that the jurisdiction violated the voting rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments. Jurisdictions certified to receive federal observers under Section 3(a) {{are not subject to}} preclearance.|$|E
5|$|In 1873, Melvin {{refused to}} {{transfer}} the case of Taylor Strauder, a black man, to <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> <b>court</b> following his indictment by an all-white Ohio County grand jury {{for the murder of}} his wife. Strauder and his lawyers argued that he would not receive equal treatment in the West Virginia courts due to its all-white jury law and cited the Civil Rights Act of 1866 for a transfer to <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> <b>court.</b> Following Melvin's ruling, Strauder's murder trial proceeded in the Ohio County court in May 1873, and he was inevitably convicted by an all-white jury. Strauder appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia and finally to the Supreme Court of the United States, where his case Strauder v. West Virginia 100 U.S. 303 (1879) was decided on March1, 1880. The Supreme Court held that categorical exclusion of blacks from juries {{for no other reason than}} their race violated the Equal Protection Clause, and Strauder's conviction was overturned due to the Ohio County court's violation of United States constitutional criminal procedure.|$|E

The first two of these were discontinued after reaching <b>a</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Court</b> hearing, and the third was rejected as not meeting applicable provisions.

5|$|When <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> <b>court</b> {{released}} former Confederate president Davis on bail on May 13 (he {{had been}} captured shortly after the war), the committee investigated whether the President had impeded the prosecution. It learned that Johnson was eager to have Davis tried. A bipartisan majority of the committee voted down impeachment charges; the committee adjourned on June 3.|$|E
5|$|During the Act's early history, Section 3(c) {{was little}} used; no jurisdictions were bailed in until 1975. Between 1975 and 2013, 18 jurisdictions were bailed in, {{including}} 16 {{local governments and}} the states of Arkansas and New Mexico. Although the Supreme Court held the Section 4(b) coverage formula unconstitutional in Shelby County v. Holder (2013), it did not hold Section 3(c) unconstitutional. Therefore, jurisdictions may continue to be bailed-in and subjected to Section 3(c) preclearance. In the months following Shelby County, courts began to consider requests by the Attorney General and other plaintiffs to bail in the states of Texas and North Carolina, and in January 2014 <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> <b>court</b> bailed in Evergreen, Alabama.|$|E
5000|$|Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick, [...] was a {{decision}} by the Supreme Court of the United States involving copyright law.

5|$|Garza, {{troubled by}} what he had done, confessed to the police that he acted as a {{middleman}} in Fischer's murder. He cooperated with the police to incriminate Martínez, who then aided in Cisneros' arrest. Cisneros and Garza were eventually {{sentenced to life in}} prison by a state court in 1994, but Cisneros' sentence was overturned due to a legal technicality. She was convicted again in 1998 by <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> <b>court</b> and {{sentenced to life in prison}}. Martínez was given a 20-year sentence after pleading guilty and testifying against the two in court. Though U.S. officials tried to have the two assassins extradited, the hitmen never faced trial in Texas. They were prosecuted in Mexico and given a 15-year sentence.|$|E
5|$|Madrid mailed {{her poem}} to six {{publishers}} in October 1999, notably Chronicle Books, before {{turning it into}} a local stage musical in August 2001.

In October 2001, she filed the suit against Chronicle Books, Pixar, and Disney in <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> <b>court</b> in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Her lawyer asked the court to issue a preliminary injunction, that would forbid Pixar and Disney from releasing the film while the suit was pending.|$|E
5|$|On 26 May 2009 Osbourne {{filed suit}} in <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> <b>court</b> in New York against Iommi alleging that he {{illegally}} claimed the band name. Iommi noted {{that he has been}} the only constant band member for its full 41-year career, and that his bandmates relinquished their rights to the name in the 1980s, therefore claiming more rights to the name of the band. Although, in the suit, Osbourne was seeking 50% ownership of the trademark, he said that he hoped the proceedings would lead to equal ownership among the four original members.|$|E

5|$|Original film {{producer}} Sean S. Cunningham claims that Miller wrote the screenplay for Friday the 13th as a work-made-for-hire for the Manny Company. Under copyright law, an employer {{is considered the}} statutory author and copyright holder if a work {{is made in the}} employee's scope of employment. If, as Cunningham contends, Miller wrote the screenplay as the Manny Company's employee, he never held a copyright to the screenplay to transfer or reclaim. A lawsuit seeking the parties' declaration of rights is currently pending in <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> <b>court</b> in Connecticut.|$|E

In 2004, Variety reported an American remake was set to be produced for NBC; Michael Chernuchin was to produce the series, which would follow <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> <b>court</b> judge in Washington, D.C. who would preside over terrorism and civil rights cases. There have been no further developments since the announcement was made in 2004.|$|E
5|$|The {{case was}} argued before Judge (and later President) William Howard Taft, who {{held that the}} federal court could not prevent the removal of {{officers}} by injunction. He advised the Republicans to seek remedy quo warranto in the state courts. Taft further opined that, should any federal question be raised in such proceedings, the officers could seek remedy in <b>a</b> <b>federal</b> <b>court</b> on appeal. The Republicans were encouraged by Taft's decision, which {{cleared the way for}} an appeal {{all the way to the}} federal Supreme Court if a federal question could be raised.|$|E
