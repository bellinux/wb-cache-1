5|$|The Royalists in Chester saw the Parliamentarian {{reinforcements}} under Jones and Booth advance, {{and sent}} Shakerley to warn Langdale's force. After receiving the message, Langdale withdrew nearer to Chester, reforming at Rowton Heath, an entirely open space. At {{the same time}} the Royalists in Chester began to move, with Gerard advancing with 500 foot and 500 cavalry. Gerard hoped to attack Jones's force from the rear, but the Parliamentarians responded by dispatching 200 cavalry and 200 infantry to prevent this. With a shorter distance to travel, this force met Gerard on Hoole Heath, and after a confused engagement in which Lord Bernard Stewart was slain, Gerard's force was prevented from marching to Langdale's aid. Instead, Jones and Booth linked up with Poyntz, giving a combined Parliamentarian force of 3,000 horse and 500 musketeers against <b>a</b> <b>tired</b> Royalist army of approximately 2,500 horse. At approximately 4:00pm Poyntz advanced, covered by the musketeers firing a full volley.|$|E
5|$|Whoever {{looks in}} the past and thinks about the time of 1919 to 1932 will be {{overpowered}} by great pain {{in the face of the}} mistakes that have been made. When Hitler published his book Mein Kampf, it was time to begin the most stringent battle against the theories proposed in that book. Hitler proposed to do away with all present parties and institutions, even those brought about after centuries of sacrifices and great exertion. What would a man do if a thief announced a proposed break-in? Anybody would make security arrangements. And what did the government and the representatives of the people do? As much as nothing. <b>A</b> <b>tired,</b> weak and sick population, as well as a weak government, let a charlatan of the worst sort promise them healing. For every problem this quack had the only right medicine. He alone possessed the magic wand that would uproot human weakness and produce angels.|$|E
5|$|After the new ball bowlers had {{finished}} their new ball spells, Bradman reverted to the slower bowlers, using run-saving, defensive field settings. Immediately thereafter, Bedser targeted Toshack and hit three consecutive fours and a two in one over. Bradman immediately removed the left-armer and replaced him with Johnson. The Australian captain set his infield rather deep, effectively allowing the batsmen to take easy singles. Bedser responded cautiously, surveying Johnson's off spin for one over, {{before going on}} the attack in the next. He lofted Johnson into the leg side three times, yielding a six over long on and two fours, taking his score to 47. Bedser then hit a ball back to the bowler Loxton, which was almost caught, before reaching 50. Bradman also brought back <b>a</b> <b>tired</b> Miller to bowl medium pace off breaks, to no avail. England went to the lunch adjournment at 360/2, with Edrich on 76 and Bedser on 52. They had added 92 for the session, including 70 in the second hour. Lindwall {{had been the only}} bowler who caused much difficulty to the batsmen, particularly concerning Edrich, but the Englishmen dealt with his colleagues comfortably and Miller, nursing fitness concerns, was forced to bowl medium-paced off breaks.|$|E

5000|$|The {{treadwear}} {{grade is}} a comparative rating {{based on the}} wear rate of the tire when tested under controlled conditions on a specified government test track. <b>A</b> <b>tire</b> graded 200 would last twice as long on the government test course under specified test conditions as one graded 100. In theory, this means that <b>a</b> <b>tire</b> with <b>a</b> 200 grade will wear {{twice as long as}} <b>a</b> <b>tire</b> with <b>a</b> 100 grade. However, tire manufacturers are not under any obligation to grade <b>a</b> <b>tire</b> based on the test results, except to say that they cannot overstate the grade. This is enforced by NHTSA requiring documentation to justify any assignment of a grade on <b>a</b> <b>tire,</b> [...] "These treadwear grades are no guarantee of actual tire mileage; differences in driving habits, service practices, climate, and road characteristics will affect <b>a</b> <b>tire's</b> longevity." ...|$|R

25|$|A short week two-game {{road trip}} {{concluded}} on a Friday in Chicago, where D.C. once again rescued {{a point in}} the final minutes. The game started brightly for the visitors, when they were awarded an indirect free kick just outside the Fire's 6-yard box. Rob Vincent scored his first MLS goal, with a blast through the defense, assisted by Acosta. However, the Fire responded quickly as Luke Mishu, playing for the injured Franklin, lost his mark on a corner kick and surrendered a header for goal. The Fire made it 2-0 not long thereafter, as David Accam dribbled around Birnbaum and took a long shot that found the corner of the goal. Down a goal, United turned in <b>a</b> <b>tired</b> display, and seemed destined for a defeat. As the game went into stoppage time, Mullins took a chance with a spectacular overhead volley that rang off the crossbar. The rebound went to Nyarko, who forced a save by the diving Sean Johnson, but Boswell headed that rebound in for the tying goal. The draw again put United ahead of Orlando City Soccer Club {{in the race for the}} final playoff position, - but only on the goal differential tiebreaker with a big home match against Orlando City looming the following weekend. Both teams actually trailed New England Revolution in that race, by two points, but the Revolution had played an additional game.|$|E
25|$|The replay (the last semi-final replay in {{the history}} of the FA Cup) went down as one of the {{greatest}} games ever played. David Beckham opened the scoring with a curving shot past Arsenal goalkeeper David Seaman from 22 yards, but Dennis Bergkamp equalised halfway through the second half, his shot deflecting off the knee of Jaap Stam. Nicolas Anelka had the ball in the back of the net for Arsenal again shortly afterwards, and the celebrations were well underway before anyone realised that the linesman had flagged Anelka offside before the goal was scored. Roy Keane then received a second booking and was sent off for a cynical foul on Marc Overmars, leaving Manchester United to play out the match with 10 men. The match was heading for extra time when Phil Neville made <b>a</b> <b>tired</b> challenge on Ray Parlour inside the penalty area; Bergkamp stepped up to take the penalty, but Peter Schmeichel guessed the direction of his kick correctly and it was at a good height for him to make the save. The first half of extra time passed without incident, before Patrick Vieira gave the ball away to Giggs at the start of the second; Giggs ran from just inside his own half, taking on four Arsenal defenders as he drove into the penalty area, then shot from a narrow angle over the head of Seaman into the roof of the Arsenal net. Manchester United hung on for the remaining 10 minutes to secure their place in the final.|$|E

5000|$|Vehicles {{typically}} carry <b>a</b> spare <b>tire,</b> already {{mounted on}} awheel rim, {{to be used}} in the event of <b>a</b> flat <b>tire</b> or blowout. Spare tires (sometimes called [...] "doughnuts") for modern cars are smaller than regular tires (to save trunk space, weight and cost) and should not be used to drive very far before replacement with <b>a</b> full-size <b>tire.</b> <b>A</b> few vehicle models use conventional size spare tires. Jacks and wrenches for emergency replacement of <b>a</b> flat <b>tire</b> with <b>a</b> spare are included with a new car.

25|$|On the 17th a {{division}} of cavalry and infantry under Brigadier General Doyle after having been given information by local Arabs intercepted a body of 550 camels escorted by 560 French soldiers going from Alexandria when they had departed on the 14th towards Middle Egypt to secure provisions. The French cavalry made <b>a</b> <b>tired</b> charge but they were overtaken by a party of British dragoons and surrendered upon honourable terms. The small garrison about 200 of the fort of Ras El Bar on the Damietta branch of the Nile was invested {{on the same day}} on the land side by a by a flotilla of British guns and Ottoman gunboats and near the mouth of the Damietta. On seeing this the French abandoned the post and retired upon Port Said; the two garrisons numbering altogether 700 men were also evacuated and embarked on board five small vessels in the {{hope to be able to}} reach the port of Alexandria. Four of these vessels however were captured and carried into Abu Qir Bay with only one escaping to the coast of Italy. On the 6th of June Colonel Lloyd with his detachment of the 86th regiment numbering about 150 men set out to march across the desert to Cairo a distance by a route intended to be taken in order to avoid meeting a superior force. By the 10th these men joined Colonel John Stewart's detachment which was to be attached to Yusuf Pashas' (the Grand Vizier) army on the right bank of the Nile.|$|E
25|$|The Australia XI {{match against}} the MCC {{used to be}} seen as {{virtually}} another Test match and important for the Australian selectors to see up and coming cricketers in action before choosing a team. For some reason in 1950–51 it was scheduled between the First and Second Tests and after the team for the latter had already been announced. Even if someone made a century or took ten wickets they could not be picked for the Australian team until the Third Test early in 1951, though Ken Archer and Jim Burke had been named in the XII and were fighting to avoid being the twelfth man. The game was held in Sydney as their rivals Melbourne were hosting two of the Tests. The Australian vice captain Arthur Morris was in charge on his home ground with local hero Keith Miller and the Victorian Neil Harvey who hardly needed testing. The batsmen Graeme Hole, wicket-keeper Gil Langley and bowlers Alan Walker, Geoff Noblet and Chris Langdon were also included, as was Ritchie Benaud, but he was too ill to play and was replaced by the veteran leg-spinner Doug Ring. Morris won the toss again and batted on a flat Sydney wicket, he added 170 with Ken Archer (81) before he was out for exactly 100, Harvey (40), Miller (62), Burke (128) and Hole (41) piled up the runs and Morris declared during the second day's tea interval for 526/9. John Warr (2/89) opened the bowling, Alec Bedser and Freddie Brown failed to take a wicket and Eric Hollies (3/108) and Bob Berry (2/108 off just 14 overs) could not contain the attack. The two spinners could not blame the fielding as they each dropped Morris of their own bowling, and Berry dropping him off Hollies. Alan Walker (5/60) and Doug Ring (3/106) reduced the MCC's reply to 47/3 by stumps and it was up to Denis Compton (115) and nightwatchman Godfrey Evans (31) to restore the innings with a partnership of 85, followed by another of 130 between Compton and Gilbert Parkhouse (58). Burke added to his credentials be taking a great catch in gully to dismiss <b>a</b> <b>tired</b> Compton, leaving Brown to punch 46 before the tail gave way five runs short of saving the follow on. Morris sent the MCC back in to bat and saw them fall to 22/2 before John Dewes (66 not out) and Parkhouse (46 not out) saved the day. Dewes retired hurt at 66/2, but returned after Compton was dismissed for 29 and they ended on 173/3. Although Jim Burke made the most runs he carried the drinks in the Second Test and Archer opened with Morris, but Burke was chosen for the Fourth Test at Adelaide and made a century on debut. Langley proved to be a competent keeper, but failed to oust Don Tallon despite the latter's lack of form. The results for Freddie Brown were more dire, Compton's knee had swollen again due to his exertions and he was unfit to play at Melbourne, Berry and Hollies had proved incapable of containing the Australian batsmen and Bedser and Brown has lost the form which had caught Australia out at Brisbane. The only good news was that John Dewes had shown his fighting abilities regardless of form and a fair crowd had come to watch, so increasing coffers of the MCC Manager John Nash.|$|E

5000|$|Sidewall {{deflection}} is not {{a direct}} measurement of rolling friction. <b>A</b> high quality <b>tire</b> with <b>a</b> high quality (and supple) casing will allow for more flex per energy loss than <b>a</b> cheap <b>tire</b> with <b>a</b> stiff sidewall.
