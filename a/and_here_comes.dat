500|$|Dylan's contemporaries in 1965 {{were both}} startled and {{challenged}} by the single. Paul McCartney remembered going around to John Lennon's house in Weybridge to hear the song. According to McCartney, [...] "It seemed {{to go on and}} on forever. It was just beautiful... He showed all of us {{that it was possible to}} go a little further." [...] Frank Zappa had a more extreme reaction: [...] "When I heard 'Like a Rolling Stone', I wanted to quit the music business, because I felt: 'If this wins and it does what it's supposed to do, I don't need to do anything else...' But it didn't do anything. It sold but nobody responded to it in the way that they should have." [...] Nearly forty years later, in 2003, Elvis Costello commented on the innovative quality of the single. [...] "What a shocking thing to live in a world where there was Manfred Mann and the Supremes and Engelbert Humperdinck <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>comes</b> 'Like a Rolling Stone'".|$|E

2500|$|Originally, Parker {{was set to}} be {{released}} on October 12, 2012. However, the release date was moved back due to strong competition it would have faced {{at the box office}} from other films released around that time including Gangster Squad <b>and</b> <b>Here</b> <b>Comes</b> the Boom; the former of which later had its release date moved to January due to the 2012 Aurora shooting. Matt Goldberg of the website Collider noted that it would have probably lost to these films if it had been released that October. Boxoffice listed the pros of the film release, which were Statham's [...] "consistent" [...] performance at the box office and Lopez's appearance which [...] "could help the film expand a bit beyond Statham's usual audience". It also listed the cons, which are Lopez's presence that might [...] "turn off some of Statham's usual audience" [...] as well as heavy competition from multiple other films.|$|E
2500|$|George Harrison wrote [...] "Here Comes the Moon" [...] {{while in}} Hana on the Hawaiian island of Maui in February 1978. The {{purpose of the}} visit was partly to write {{material}} for his first album in two years, titled simply George Harrison, and partly for Harrison and his girlfriend, Olivia Arias, to enjoy a holiday after learning {{that they were to}} become parents for the first time. As with several of the songs on the album, Harrison drew inspiration for [...] "Here Comes the Moon" [...] from his surroundings on Maui. In his 1980 autobiography, I Me Mine, he recalls seeing [...] "marvellous" [...] sunsets there and regularly sighting whales. On this particular occasion, Harrison adds, [...] "the full moon was coming up as the sun was going down – all this <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>comes</b> the moon! Too much." [...] His experience was heightened by the effects of either LSD or magic mushrooms, the last of which provided inspiration for another new song, [...] "Soft-Hearted Hana".|$|E
2500|$|With {{about two}} {{minutes left in the}} half, the Dolphins finally managed to get a good drive going on their next possession. Marino {{completed}} seven out of nine passes, the last one being a 30-yard pass to tight end Joe Rose, to reach the 49ers' 12-yard line. However, San Francisco's defense tightened up on the next three plays, forcing two incompletions and a completed pass for no gain, and Miami was forced to settle for von Schamann's second field goal of the game to cut their deficit to 28–13 with 12 seconds left in the half. Then Miami caught a break as the 49ers botched the ensuing kickoff. San Francisco lineman Guy McIntyre received von Schamann's short kick and was about to down the ball, but then changed his mind at the last second and decided to return it. This {{turned out to be a}} big mistake; McIntyre fumbled while being leveled by rookie Joe Carter, and Jim Jensen recovered the ball for Miami at the 49ers' 12-yard line. After that, von Schamann kicked his third field goal on the last play of the half, cutting the score to 28–16. [...] "I can laugh about the play now, but it wasn't funny at the time," [...] McIntyre said after the game. [...] "My first instinct when I got the ball was to fall down. Then I heard everyone yelling, 'Get up! Get up!' So I got up, <b>and</b> <b>here</b> <b>comes</b> someone sneaking underneath me, and he hit the ball." ...|$|E
