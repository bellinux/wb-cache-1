Two of our greatest interpreters proclaimed it, Emerson and William James. In a recent address at the Paris Sorbonne on [...] "American Idealism," [...] M. Firmin Roz observed that a people is rarely justly estimated by its contemporaries. The French, he says, have been celebrated chiefly for the skill of their chefs and their vaudeville actors, while in the disturbed 'speculum mundi' Americans have appeared as a collection of money grabbers whose philosophy is the dollar. It remained for the war to reveal the true nature of both peoples. The American colonists, M. Roz continues, unlike other colonists, were animated not by material motives, but by the desire to safeguard and realize an ideal; our inherent characteristic today is a belief in the virtue and power of ideas, of a national, indeed, of <b>a</b> <b>universal,</b> <b>mission.</b> In the Eighteenth Century we proposed a Philosophy and adopted a Constitution far in advance of the political practice of the day, and set up a government of which Europe predicted the early downfall. Nevertheless, thanks partly to good fortune, and to the farseeing wisdom of our early statesmen who perceived that the success of our experiment depended upon the maintenance of an isolation from European affairs, we established democracy as a practical form of government.|$|E

They are merely required to establish their religion among their own people. This is why the Israelites after Moses and Joshua remained unconcerned with royal authority for about four hundred years. Their only concern was to establish their religion... The Israelites dispossessed the Canaanites of the land that God had given them as their heritage in Jerusalem and the surrounding region, {{as it had been}} explained to them through Moses. The nations of the Philistines, the Canaanites, the Armenians, the Edomites, the Ammonites, and the Moabites fought against them. During that time political leadership was entrusted to the elders among them. The Israelites remained in that condition for about four hundred years. They did not have any royal power and were harassed by attacks from foreign nations. Therefore, they asked God through Samuel, one of their prophets, that he permit them to make someone king over them. Thus, Saul became their king. He defeated the foreign nations and killed Goliath, the ruler of Philistines. After Saul, David became king, and then Solomon. His kingdom flourished and extended to the borders of the land of the Hijaz and further to the borders of Yemen and to the borders of the land of the Byzantines. After Solomon, the tribes split into two dynasties. One of the dynasties was that of the ten tribes in the region of Nablus, the capital of which is Samaria (Sabastiyah), and the other that of the children of Judah and Benjamin in Jerusalem. Their royal authority had had an uninterrupted duration of a thousand years.|$|E

Accordingly, when Ignatius of Loyola is mentioned in this paper as the »founder« od the Society of Jesus, he is considered as the person who, through his charisma, inspired and gathered others about him He founded the Society of Jesus {{taking into account the}} experience of other orders, e. g. Franciscans / he spent his youth in a franciscan athmosphere/, Dominicans / his confessors/, Benedictines / he had few but significant encounters with them/, Carthusians / their spirit is present in the »Exercitia spiritualia«, and the regular clergy / he adopted their mode of life, their dress. In founding the Society of Jesus, Ignatius intruduced something essentially new. Jesuits are not mordcs, they are clerics and apostles with <b>an</b> <b>universal</b> <b>mission.</b> Accordingly, they have to seek God in all things, not only in the forms defined up to that time. Therefore, no »observance« are required, but a »normal mode oflife«. The Ignatian quality of the Society of Jesus consists to a lesser degree of details and new rules, but much of the consequent carrying out of single directives leading to more perfect serving of the Curch, requiring disponibiliiy and mobility as well as constant adaptation to time, place, persons, and circumstances...|$|R
25|$|Colonialism was a {{capitalist}} venture moved by appropriation and plundering of foreign lands. It {{was supported by}} military force and a discourse that legitimized its violence {{in the name of}} progress and <b>a</b> <b>universal</b> civilizing <b>mission.</b> This discourse is complex and multi-faceted. It was elaborated in the 19th century by colonial ideologues such as Joseph-Ernest Renan and Arthur de Gobineau, but its roots reach far back in history. In Rethinking Postcolonialism: Colonialist Discourse in Modern Literature and the Legacy of Classical Writers, Amar Acheraiou discusses the history of colonialist discourse and traces its spirit to ancient Greece, including Europe’s claim to racial supremacy and right to rule over non-Europeans harboured by Renan and other 19th century colonial ideologues. He argues that modern colonial representations of the colonized as “inferior”, “stagnant” and “degenerate” were borrowed from Greek and Latin authors like Lysias (440-380 BC), Isocrates (436-338 BC), Plato (427-327 BC), Aristotle (384—322 BC), Cicero (106-43 BC), and Sallust (86-34 BC), who all considered their racial others – the Persians, Scythians, Egyptians as “backward”, “inferior”, and “effeminate”. Among these ancient writers Aristotle is the one who articulated more thoroughly these ancient racial assumptions, which served as a source of inspiration for modern colonists. In The Politics, he established a racial classification and ranked the Greeks superior to the rest. He considered them as an ideal race to rule over Asian and other ‘barbarian’ peoples, for they knew how to blend the spirit of the European “war-like races” with Asiatic “intelligence” and “competence”.|$|R

Teachers have <b>a</b> <b>universal</b> <b>mission</b> to serve all children, which can translate to quite radical claims-making when this universality is applied in other contexts. With the Parents’ Association Federation (FCPE) network structure as a guide, RESF recruited and established school leaders at each school.

Along with other teachers, school social workers, and staff, these leaders often act as a first contact, someone in a school who serves as a bridge to other resources for undocumented youth. Active teachers tend towards the left of the political spectrum that espouses a more inclusive philosophy towards immigrants, though RESF does not formally align with any political party.|$|E
40|$|This article {{attempts}} to relate modern anti-Semitism to the increasingly close interactions of Jews and non-Jews {{in an age}} of political emancipation and social integration. It argues that the changing mutual perceptions of Jews and Protestants in the German educated bourgeoisie are of central importance in this regard. In nineteenth-century Germany, literature movements such as realism, and various human sciences such as anthropology, Protestant theology or philology provided ample material for discussing the Jewish character. These fields suggest four ways of perceiving Jews: the Jew as parvenu, as Talmudist, as materialist and as nomad. Indeed, bourgeois Jews themselves contributed to these literary and scholarly debates. Their discussions were frequently shaped by the attempt to confront anti-Jewish misconceptions. Moreover, they propagated their own interpretation of the Jewish character: the figure of the humanistic Jew. This Jewish interpretation, which identifies <b>a</b> <b>universal</b> <b>mission,</b> proves to have a twofold nature: it is not only a counter-attack against anti-Semitic polemics, but also a particular result of the peculiar Jewish adaptation of bourgeois culture. As the article argues, however, this humanistic perception of Jewish identity caused concern on the Protestant side, which led to further polemics and thus further Jewish defence. The resulting spiral of problematic perceptions was the consequence of the growing social intimacy of bourgeois Jews and Protestants in nineteenth-century Germany. Modern anti-Semitism, it is thus argued, can be interpreted as a specific form of rejection of ambivalence and the establishment of neat binary codes in the confusing closeness of Jews and non-Jews...|$|E

40|$|Since {{the ancient}} times {{the belief in}} the rise of the Reformer has been a {{fundamental}} principle. Many of the holy prophets have announced the advent of new prophet. Moreover in the announcements and indications of predecessors there are always allusions to "the Last Promised" and "the Savior of Last Days" under such titles as "Kalki", "Fifth Buddha", "Soshyans", "Messiah", "The Son of Man" {{and so on and so}} forth. Of course there are different types of belief in the last reformer in religions. In one place the Savior is merely a social reformer while in another place he is only after the spiritual salvation of people and even sometimes he undertakes both tasks. On the other hand, the Last Promised is once nationalist and once seeks to save the whole world.    This essay seeks to assay the views of pre-Islamic great religions including Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Christianity, Hinduism and Buddhism as to the Promised Savior. This essay is an analytico-descriptive research which has based itself on the first hand works comprising the sacred scriptures of religions and proceeds through the typological analyses of idea of the Promised in religions.    Zoroastrianism: the idea of the Promised has been tied to the notion of Soshyant. Generally speaking, this notion alludes to a group of people who periodically emerge at the end of every millennium of the last three millennia of world&# 39;s age so as to uproot evil and renew the world, the last one of these reformers is Soshyans. According to the aforementioned typology, Zoroastrian idea of Last Savior is among the Promised who saves the whole world. Moreover Zoroastrian Promised cannot be declared only a social savior as he is not wholly detached from people&# 39;s spirituality too. From another point of view, Zoroastrian idea of the Promised represents a universal and not nationalist savior who is relatively a human and not divine entity who emerges in the last millennium of world&# 39;s age.    Judaism: in the Old Testament Mashih (Messiah) means the anointed one by God and is the one who has been exposed to the spirit of Yahweh and this virtue has equipped him with all qualities which are necessary for an ideal king of Israel "the spirit of God will perch on that branch, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of council and power, the spirit of knowledge of Yahweh and fear of him. " (Isaiah, 2 : 11). Mashih recalls a Savior of political taste. According to Jews, when Messiah rises the kingdom of heaven becomes established on earth and all nations return to Jerusalem (Isaiah, 14 : 45) and the golden age of Jewish rule over the world begins. Thus Jewish taking of the Promised is ethnically motivated whose main concern is reclaiming the dominance and prosperity of Jews and it is less concerned with spiritual salvation. Although this Savior is of a Jewish origin but since his personal qualities are not decided then it is impersonal and void of divinity.    Christianity: the idea of the Promised has revealed itself in Christianity in three forms: first in the form of Jesus of Nazareth who plays the role of Savior and fulfills the expectations; second, in the form of "Judge of worlds" who will reveal himself when Jesus returns to the earth at the Day of Judgment as he once left there (Acts, 1 : 11). And third, in the form of a man whose advent is announced by Jesus Christ and is described as the "source of consolation" and "spirit of honesty" who will bless Jesus and approve him (John, 14 : 17). Accordingly, Christianity contains three versions of the Promised idea.    According to the previously mentioned typology, the first countenance of the Savior in Christianity, i. e. Jesus as Messiah in the New Testament, not only does not indicate the occurrence of a social uprising for establishing a government or spiritual refinement of people but rather the Savior in this sense undergoes a severe agony to relieve humanity from the burden of original sin (Acts, 8 : 32). This Christian taking of the Promised is unique in its kind and has no equivalent in other religions.    But in the second form which promises the return of Jesus to help people to reach their perfection (Mathew, 37 : 24 - 27; Luke, 18 : 69 & 22 : 18). Then the Promised in this sense aims at universal spiritual flourishing and is a person but a divine person.    The third manifestation of the Promised which has been described as "the spirit of honesty" and the "source of consolation" is the Holy Spirit, according to the Christians, who leads the church in its quest for righteousness in the absence of Christ.    Typologically speaking, Christian taking of the Promised has a spiritual character. It is universal and pro-millennium.    Hinduism: Hindu taking of the Promised is built upon a figure called Kalki who emerges at the Last Day when darkness devours the whole universe and evil minds take the helm. By the end of this dark period the tenth and final incarnation (avatar) of Vishnu which is named Kalki, riding a white horse with a castrated sword and like a falling star rises to uproot the evil and wickedness and establish justice and virtue.    Bhagavata Purana indicates that: "his empire will be universal and his mission will be the resurrection of dharma (law) and justice and truth". Thus the Hindu promised Messiah is personal and divine and actually his mission is social and spiritual, so he is not ethnically motivated but is universal.    Buddhism: Promised Savior in Buddhism is explained by the concept of "Maitreya" which is a Sanskrit word meaning "loving-kindness". In Buddhist theology he is known as the fifth and the last ground Buddha who is yet to come but he will come to save all mankind. In Buddhism symbolism he is in shape of a sitting man who is ready to get up which is the symbol of his preparation to arise. In Mahavastu, a text book of sub sect Hinayana that is about history of Sri Lanka, chronology of events of Maitreya uprising is clearly mentioned. Based on the typology, the promised Buddhist Savior is spiritual saving and he does not have social purposes. He is a personal Savior and with human - divine characteristic. Since the mission of the fifth Buddha is not to rescue a specific nation it could be <b>a</b> <b>universal</b> <b>mission.</b> The result of this study is that although expressions and typology of belief in Savior in mentioned religions is deferent, however there is an important common belief among all them, which is faith and hope in uprising of Savior in apocalypse...|$|E
