50|$|Audio {{cannot be}} {{recorded}} on a VHS tape without recording a video signal, {{even in the}} <b>audio</b> <b>dubbing</b> mode. If there is no video signal to the VCR input, most VCRs will record black video as well as generate a control track while the audio is being recorded. Some early VCRs would record audio without a control track signal, but this was of little practical use since {{the absence of a}} control track signal meant that the linear tape speed was irregular during playback.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the lack}} of video {{software}} for domestic television, video software was imported from abroad. When the television program was shown on television, it was mostly dubbed. There was a character limit for a small TV screen at a lower resolution, and this method was not suitable for the poor elderly and illiterate eye, as was <b>audio</b> <b>dubbing.</b> Presently, TV shows and movies (both those aimed at all ages and adults-only) are shown dubbed with the original language and Japanese subtitles, while providing the original language option when the same film is released on VHS, DVD and Blu-ray.|$|E
5000|$|English {{language}} in the Netherlands refers {{to the use of}} the English {{language in}} the Netherlands. Research states that between 90% and 93% of the Dutch population claims to be able to converse in English. According to some, the main reasons for the high degree of English speakers is the country's small size, dependency on international trade, and the use of subtitles for foreign languages on television rather than <b>audio</b> <b>dubbing.</b> Occupations which require a complex knowledge of the English language, such as those in aviation and the sciences, are also abundant in the Netherlands. Furthermore, it is (alongside Dutch) an official language of the municipality of Amsterdam [...] and the Caribbean municipalities of Saba and Sint Eustatius.|$|E

50|$|A lip dub {{is a type}} {{of music}} video that {{combines}} lip synching and <b>audio</b> <b>dubbing</b> to make a music video. It is made by filming individuals or a group of people lip synching while listening to a song or any recorded audio then dubbing over it in post editing with the original audio of the song. There is often some form of mobile audio device used such as an MP3 player. Often they look like simple music videos, although many involve a lot of preparation and production. Lip dubs are usually done in a single unedited shot that often travel through different rooms and situations within a building. They have become popular with the advent of mass participatory video content sites like YouTube.|$|E

5000|$|The Critic's Word {{reviewer}} made note of {{this being}} the first feature film of Princeton Holt. He wrote that as a [...] "character driven piece", the film may at first glance [...] "look and feel like an X-rated skin flick to the viewing eye", but that initial imprssion is dispelled as the film quickly reveals itself to be [...] "a touching film {{with a lot of}} depth and an incredible sense of weight within its story." [...] But he also noted that the film was not without its problems, the first being the [...] "film’s deluge which felt a little drowned out at times and a little like gap fillers for the most part, but nothing too harmful that would seriously hurt the film in any real way though," [...] and the second being the film's <b>audio</b> <b>dubbing</b> which was [...] "off" [...] in certain parts. He also commented that while the pacing might have been too slow for some viewers, it managed to [...] "tell a very adequate story about a young woman living life in its whole realism form." [...] Speaking toward the writer/director, the reviewer wrote [...] "Holt is {{a breath of fresh air}} and projects an unique and somewhat uncanny style of filmmaking that reminded me of the late 80’s and early 90’s of filmmaking". He also commended the cast when writing [...] "most of the cast did an equally fair job in their performances." [...] In summation he noted that he first viewed the film with low expectations, and was surprised that [...] "the film came out very enjoyable and was a terrific experience." ...|$|E
50|$|Editworks {{was founded}} in 1990 by Paul Smith, of Complete Communications, as a {{broadcast}} offshoot from Complete Video, which targeted mostly short form commercial work. It was originally based at Chelsea Harbour along with The Shooting Crew, which provided cameras and crew for location productions. Editworks was initially run by Geraint Owen, with Graham Hutchings and Perry Widdowson as editors. The Shooting Crew was run by Barry Noakes. Mark Sangster joined the company in 1992, from Thames Television. Originally, there were two linear online edit suites and one U-matic offline suite, based at Chelsea Harbour. Any extra sound work usually went to be finished at Complete Video in Covent Garden. In 1993, editworks used Avid {{for the first time}} to cut a Paul McCartney documentary and the non-linear system soon became the editors and Producers preferred tool. Expansion continued and in 1995 it was decided to build an <b>audio</b> <b>dubbing</b> suite at Chelsea and Adrian Smith joined the company as dubbing mixer from TVS. The U-matic offline suite became a third linear online and three dedicated Avid offline suites were built. Ex-BBC editor Steve Murray joined the company on 18 September 1995. During that period, James Thomas and Paul Richmond were promoted to editors from the Technical Staff. Following the success of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, Paul Smith decided to divest himself of editworks and invited the management team to buy the company from him. In 2000, Jim Boyers (then General Manager), together with Roger Cumner (Chief Engineer), Graham Hutchings, Mark Sangster, Adrian Smith and Perry Widdowson formed editworks 2000 ltd. The company was relocated from Chelsea Harbour to its present location in Charlotte Street, London. In 2005, Nick Dixon was promoted to on-line DS Editor as well as continuing to supervise the technical area along with Steve Willey. In 2008, a formal in-house editor training scheme commenced with three technical assistants, Brendon Blackshaw, Rebecca Bowker and John Foxen taking part. In 2010, Andrew Barrett (Ex-Heinz CEO) became Editworks’ Company Chairman to assist the company’s growth into the Scottish Television market. In June 2010, Editworks Scotland opened in The Hub, Pacific Quay, Glasgow. On 12 September 2012 Editworks 2000 Ltd entered administration. Editworks Scotland Ltd continues to trade.|$|E
40|$|The current paper {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of a 3 D character generation and multilingual talking emulation software application. Traditional lip sync techniques in 3 D graphics productions require a careful (and painful) design at the pre-render phase, as well as the selection of the mostly matching phrases during <b>audio</b> <b>dubbing.</b> This paper proposes a completely different approach, whereas graphic designers are not worried about facial animation for lip sync purposes. When the scene’s sequence modeling is finished, rendering starts just after an automatic modification procedure where faces are morphed according to the driving sound. In case of a multilingual production, rendering for each different language is required, but the content of the dialogues is not depended on the original facial expressions formed according to the original language. Based on our experimentation, we suggest a “standardized face ” format for 3 d graphic popular platforms in combination with the developed algorithm for automated lip sync, translation and rendering...|$|E
