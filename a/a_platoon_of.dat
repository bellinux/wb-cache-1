50|$|A re-organisation of the Territorial Army {{took place}} in 1969 and <b>a</b> rifle <b>platoon</b> <b>of</b> Headquarters Company, 51st Highland Volunteers was formed at the Hunter Street drill hall at that time; the rifle platoon was {{expanded}} to create 'B (The Black Watch) Company', 1st Battalion, 51st Highland Volunteers also at the Hunter Street drill hall in 1971. This unit was re-designated 'K Company' in 1975. The presence at the drill hall was reduced to <b>a</b> rifle <b>platoon</b> <b>of</b> 'A (Black Watch) Company' of the 51st Highland Regiment in 1999: the drill hall remains an active Army Reserve Centre used by <b>a</b> rifle <b>platoon</b> <b>of</b> 'A (Black Watch and Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders) Company' of 51st Highland, 7th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland.|$|R

5|$|In {{the last}} week of March, the {{battalion}} finally withdrew to refit with the M18 Hellcat self-propelled tank destroyer. In so doing, it reverted to the old self-propelled battalion organisation; three companies of twelve tank destroyers, plus a fourth reconnaissance company with <b>a</b> <b>platoon</b> <b>of</b> pioneers. The new organisation was smaller than the old - fewer men were needed for vehicle crews - and so even after the creation of the new Reconnaissance Company on 27 March, the 824th finished the month with a complement of 646 all ranks, down from 750.|$|E
5|$|Jordanians and Arab irregulars had 5 {{deaths and}} 6 injured. The Israelis counted 72 deaths (52 from the 32nd Battalion and 20 from the 72nd Battalion), 6 prisoners and 140 injured.

5|$|The KRRC's 3rd Battalion, {{including}} <b>a</b> <b>platoon</b> <b>of</b> 70 Rhodesians, {{was transferred}} from France to the Salonika Front in 1915. On this comparatively quiet front, they were slowly whittled {{down over the}} course of the war: 26 of them remained in January 1917, and by the end of the war so few were left that the platoon no longer existed. Most of the men had been killed in action, while others were prisoners of the Bulgarians.|$|E
5|$|The advance against Croat-held villages {{along the}} Una was also preceded by an hour-long mortar {{bombardment}} of the area. More than 250 rounds were fired, commencing on 26 July at 10:00, {{after which the}} infantry was ordered to advance. The attacking force consisted of 50 SAO Krajina special forces troops drawn from Knin, 50 policemen and 700 conscripts. The JNA estimated that there were about 240–280 Croatian police and ZNG personnel deployed in the area from Struga to Kozibrod. The SAO Krajina plan saw a battalion led by Braco Orlović advancing north from Dvor through the village of Zamlača to approach the village of Struga. Once there, it was to maintain its position and advance gradually if possible. Additional forces were meant to outflank and pin down the Croatian defending force: <b>a</b> <b>platoon</b> <b>of</b> special forces led by Nikola Sundać, reinforced by <b>a</b> <b>platoon</b> <b>of</b> conscripts, was tasked with bypassing Struga and interdicting traffic along the road between the village of Unčani and Struga, preventing any access {{from the direction of}} Kozibrod. Another special forces platoon led by Željko Sanader was tasked with seizing the villages of Volinja and Kuljani before advancing towards Kozibrod, while the second battalion attached to the attacking force—led by Mićo Popović—engaged Croatian troops near Divuša, Golubovac Divuški and Kozibrod.|$|E
5|$|Two Israeli sappers {{were sent}} to mine {{the area of the}} {{quarantine}} station, but did not know that it was already under Syrian control.

Its advance was halted by the village residents as well as <b>a</b> <b>platoon</b> <b>of</b> reinforcements armed with 20 mm cannons. The company retreated to its position and commenced artillery fire on the two kibbutzim.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there were}} minor exchanges {{of fire and}} some patrol activity, there was a lull in the battle on 14March in the {{northern}} sector. The following day, three Japanese infantry battalions fell on the US positions before dawn. They made some progress around Cox's Creek, but US forces counterattacked with air support, bazookas and flamethrowers, retaking part of the line. <b>A</b> <b>platoon</b> <b>of</b> M4 Sherman tanks arrived during the afternoon, and at around 3:00pm they attacked the Japanese with supporting artillery fire and regained more of the perimeter. From there, the battle followed a similar pattern, with a lull in the fighting on 16March, followed by a renewed effort by the Japanese the next day, with several US positions being overrun.|$|E
5|$|Euryalus {{became the}} {{flagship}} of Rear Admiral Rosslyn Wemyss in April, {{after he was}} put in charge of the main landings at Gallipoli. During the landings at Cape Helles on the morning of 25 April, Euryalus transported three companies of the 1st Battalion of the Lancashire Fusiliers and <b>a</b> <b>platoon</b> <b>of</b> the Royal Naval Division, and then provided fire support to the landing after the soldiers were transferred to their boats for the actual landing on Beach 'W'. She also bombarded Turkish positions during the Second Battle of Krithia on 6 May. A month later, Wemyss hauled down his flag and resumed his original commanding of the Allied base at Mudros. Euryalus received a brief refit at Malta from 30 December 1915 to 20 January 1916 before proceeding to Egypt to reinforce the defences there.|$|E
5|$|In the {{southern}} part of the area of operations around Stolac, the situation was significantly calmer than around Nevesinje, although a group of 200 Ustaše at Berkovići were falsely claiming that they were being surrounded by rebels at night. Despite this claim, they had suffered no casualties. Regardless, Prpić sent them ammunition and <b>a</b> <b>platoon</b> <b>of</b> the 18th Battalion. At 19:00 on 26 June, Francetić arrived at Prpić's headquarters in Mostar to be briefed on the situation. He resolved that he would travel to Berkovići the following day and take personal command of the Ustaše unit there.|$|E

5|$|Italian forces entered British Somaliland from Abyssinia on 4 August 1940, {{overcame the}} {{garrison}} at Hargeisa, and advanced north-east towards the capital Berbera. The British force, including <b>a</b> <b>platoon</b> <b>of</b> 43 Rhodesians in the 2nd Battalion of the Black Watch, took up positions on six hills overlooking the only road towards Berbera and engaged the Italians at the Battle of Tug Argan. Amid heavy fighting, the Italians gradually made gains and by 14 August had almost pocketed the Commonwealth forces. The British retreated to Berbera between 15 and 17 August, the Rhodesians {{making up the}} left flank of the rearguard, and by 18 August had evacuated by sea. The Italians took the city and completed their conquest of British Somaliland a day later.|$|E
5|$|On 13 September, <b>a</b> <b>platoon</b> <b>of</b> the 2/25th Infantry Battalion {{came under}} very heavy fire from a {{concealed}} Japanese machine gun near Heath's Plantation that wounded {{a number of}} Australians, including Corporal W. H. (Billy) Richards, and halted the platoon's advance. Private Richard Kelliher suddenly, on his own initiative, dashed toward the post and hurled two grenades at it, which killed some of the Japanese defenders but not all. He returned to his section, seized a Bren gun, dashed back to the enemy post and silenced it. He then asked permission to go out again to rescue the wounded Richards, which he accomplished successfully under heavy fire from another enemy position. Kelliher was awarded the Victoria Cross.|$|E
5|$|On {{the main}} road, the 2nd Battalion, 35th Infantry, held a {{blocking}} position northwest of Hamch'ang, supported by <b>a</b> <b>platoon</b> <b>of</b> tanks from A Company, 78th Tank Battalion, and A Battery, 90th Field Artillery Battalion. The 1st Battalion was emplaced with the 2nd Battalion but stayed less than 24 hours {{before it was}} sent to reinforce the US 27th Infantry Regiment on the next north-south line of communications westward. Thus, in effect, one battalion of US troops stood behind ROK units on the Hamch'ang approach. On the second road, that leading into Sangju from the west, the 24th Infantry Regiment assembled two, and later all three, of its battalions.|$|E
