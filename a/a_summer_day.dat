5|$|The severed ear that Jeffrey discovers {{is also a}} key {{symbolic}} element, leading Jeffrey into danger. Indeed, just as Jeffrey's troubles begin, {{the audience}} is treated to a nightmarish sequence in which the camera zooms into the canal of the severed, decomposing ear. Notably, the camera does not reemerge from the ear canal {{until the end of}} the film. When Jeffrey finally comes through his hellish ordeal unscathed, the ear canal shot is replayed, only in reverse, zooming out through Jeffrey's own ear as he relaxes in his yard on <b>a</b> <b>summer</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} thieves stole, on <b>a</b> <b>summer</b> <b>day,</b> horses {{that belonged to}} the Monastery of StJovan Vladimir. When they came to the nearby stream of Kusha to take the horses across, it {{appeared}} to them like an enormous river. They moved away from it in fear, but when they looked back from a distance, the stream appeared small. As they approached it again, the Kusha again became huge and impassable. After several such attempts to cross the stream, the thieves realized that this was a miracle of the saint, so they released the monastery's horses and ran away in horror.|$|E

5|$|Modern DST {{was first}} {{proposed}} by the New Zealand entomologist George Hudson, whose shift work job gave him leisure time to collect insects and led him to value after-hours daylight. In 1895 he presented a paper to the Wellington Philosophical Society proposing a two-hour daylight-saving shift, and after considerable interest was expressed in Christchurch, he followed up in an 1898 paper. Many publications credit DST proposal to the prominent English builder and outdoorsman William Willett, who independently conceived DST in 1905 during a pre-breakfast ride, when he observed with dismay how many Londoners slept through {{a large part of}} <b>a</b> <b>summer</b> <b>day.</b> An avid golfer, he also disliked cutting short his round at dusk. His solution was to advance the clock during the summer months, a proposal he published two years later. The proposal was taken up by the Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) Robert Pearce, who introduced the first Daylight Saving Bill to the House of Commons on February 12, 1908. A select committee was set up to examine the issue, but Pearce's bill did not become law, and several other bills failed in the following years. Willett lobbied for the proposal in the UK until his death in 1915.|$|E

25|$|Nantucket {{is served}} by Nantucket Memorial Airport (IATA airport code ACK), a three-runway airport {{on the south side}} of the island. The airport is one of the busiest in Massachusetts and often logs more take-offs and {{landings}} on <b>a</b> <b>summer</b> <b>day</b> than Boston's Logan Airport. This is due in part to the large number of private planes used by wealthy summer inhabitants, and in part to the 10-seat Cessna 402s used by several commercial air carriers to serve the island community.|$|E

25|$|In 1909 he {{returned}} to the beach in Valencia and again took up themes depicting people at sea. In the portrait Elena en la playa Sorolla portrayed his youngest daughter in a white dress with the beach as a background. In this portrait, from {{about the same time as}} Walk on the Beach, Sorolla painted the meeting of land and sea, the waves of the sea, the dress moving in the wind, a hat and the light of <b>a</b> <b>summer</b> <b>day</b> in the Mediterranean.|$|E
25|$|In {{their bright}} whites, the figures clearly {{stand out from}} the rest of the image. The light is {{characteristic}} of the early evening of <b>a</b> <b>summer</b> <b>day</b> in the Mediterranean. The already low sun appears from the direction of the viewer on the two sides to seeing women whose long shadows loom on the beach behind them. Playback of these lighting effects under the southern sun are typical Valenciano for Luminismo, one in Spain resulting from the Impressionism as a special form of Neo-Impressionism, whose main representative was Joaquín Sorolla.|$|E
500|$|After Nazi Germany {{surrendered}} in May 1945, General Arnold ordered Crump {{to document}} {{the extent of the}} damage caused by aerial bombardment. This project was code-named [...] "Special Film Project 186." [...] Crump and his crew, using color film, surveyed bomb damage inflicted on the major European cities. In addition, Crump recorded the debriefings of Nazi civilian and military personnel in Allied custody such as Hermann Goering, as well as the capture of the Ohrdruf and Buchenwald concentration camps by American soldiers. Upon viewing the film of the camps for the first time, Malvin Wald recollected, [...] "Even though it was <b>a</b> <b>summer</b> <b>day,</b> Reagan came out shivering—we all did. We’d never seen anything like that." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{historic}} picture, [...] "Meet the Hull House Kids," [...] {{was taken}} on <b>a</b> <b>summer</b> <b>day</b> in 1924 by Wallace K. Kirkland Sr., Hull House Director. [...] He {{later became a}} top photographer with Life. The twenty Hull House Kids were erroneously described as young boys, of Irish ancestry, posing in the Dante School yard on Forquer Street (now Arthington Street). [...] It circulated {{the world as a}} [...] "poster child" [...] of sorts for the Hull House social experiment. [...] On April 5, 1987, over a half century later, the Chicago Sun-Times refuted the contention that the Hull House Boys were of Irish ancestry. In doing so, the Sun-Times article listed the names of each of the young boys. [...] All twenty boys were first-generation Italian-Americans, all with vowels {{at the end of their}} names. [...] "They grew up to be lawyers and mechanics, sewer workers and dump truck drivers, a candy shop owner, a boxer and a mob boss." ...|$|E
500|$|The LIRR was {{entitled}} {{by law to}} take the case to the New York Court of Appeals (the state's highest court) as there had been a dissent in the Appellate Division, and it did. The railroad argued again that Palsgraf had failed to establish that she had come to harm through the railroad's negligence: that there was no negligence, and even if there was, that neglect had not harmed Palsgraf, since such injury was not [...] "a natural and probable consequence of assisting a man to board a train". Its brief alleged that the trainmen could not have stopped the man from boarding, and once he had flung himself onto the train, {{had little choice but to}} help him, [...] "faced with such an emergency they cannot be charged with negligence because they elected to assist the man rather than stand idly by and leave him to his fate." [...] Wood, for his part, argued that negligence had been found by the jury, and by both majority and dissenting justices in the Appellate Division. He wrote that there were many facts from which the jury could have found negligence, including the fact that the train had not shut its doors as it departed (though whether this was to allow latecomers to board or because it was <b>a</b> <b>summer</b> <b>day</b> is uncertain). The case was argued before the Court of Appeals in Albany on February 24, 1928.|$|E
