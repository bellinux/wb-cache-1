40|$|In {{the present}} work, {{the effect of}} {{viscoelasticity}} on the yield behaviour of a polycarbonate, PC, was studied and the identification of a yield criterion which {{takes into account the}} effects of the mechanical history on the onset of plastic strain, was attempted. The attention was focused on the shear yielding plastic deformation process and different loading histories were performed under uniaxial compression: constant strain rate at different rates, stress relaxation at different applied strain levels, creep under different stress levels. Some tests were also carried out under shear loading, in which the hydrostatic stress component is equal to zero and its effect on the yield onset can be considered. For the definition of a yield criterion, different quantities, some already proposed in an analogous work on a styrene- <b>acrylonitrile</b> <b>copolymer</b> (SAN), were considered and determined at yield onset for each of the applied loading histories. The results obtained in this work show that the relative ratios of the viscoelastic strain over the overall strain and of viscoelastic energy over the deformation work are fairly constant irrespective of both loading history and stress state. The re-elaboration of the data previously obtained on SAN is consistent with these results. Discussing the experimental data, differences between the mechanical behaviour of the two glassy polymers were pointed out and a more difficult activation of the plastic deformation process of PC than SAN was generally observed...|$|E

Diradical intermediates were also trapped in reactions of isoprene, 1, 3 -butadiene, 2, 3 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -butadiene, cis and trans-piperylene and 2, 5 -dimethyl- 2, 4 -hexadiene with <b>acrylonitrile.</b> <b>Copolymers</b> were obtained in all cases.

A zwitterionic intermediate was successfully trapped in the reactions of p-anisyl- 1, 3 -butadiene and 1 -phenyl- 1, 3 -butadiene with various leaving groups in the β-position. Homopolymer of the arylbutadiene was obtained in all cases. Polymerization was initiated from a cationic species which arose from {{the elimination of the}} leaving group from a zwitterionic hexamethylene species. Polymerization was accompanied by [4 + 2] cycloaddition. Reactions of p-anisyl- 1, 3 -butadiene and 1 -phenyl- 1, 3 -butadiene with methyl 2, 2 -dicyanoacrylate, dimethyl cyanofumarate, trimethyl ethylenetricarboxylate gave only the [4 + 2] cycloadduct. No polymer was formed in this reaction and no evidence for a reactive intermediate was obtained. The BFI theory was also applied to Group Transfer Polymerization reactions to determine whether the reaction mechanism involved a tetramethylene diradical intermediate. No styrene was incorporated into the methyl acrylate polymer, and so no evidence for a radical intermediate was obtained.

30|$|India {{is one of}} the top ten {{producers}} of aquaculture products in the world (Greenfacts 2010). The export of shrimps and crabs is usually done in a canned form for which meat is shelled and processed further. The unused shells sometimes are sold to poultry farms as feed but the quantity thus used is not comparable to tonnes of waste that is generated. Additionally, the disposal of this waste causes environmental problems. This waste in the form of chitin is a potential biosorbent of heavy metals. Chitin, obtained from crustacean shells is the second most abundant natural polysaccharide (Kumar 2000). Chitin contains 5 – 8  % of nitrogen in the form of aliphatic amino groups (Dutta et al. 2004). Chitosan is a polymer of glucosamine, found naturally in some fungal cell wall, produced chemically from the deacetylation of chitin. Chitin and chitosan are renewable, biodegradable, non-toxic polymers with very good adsorptive capacity (Dutta et al. 2004). Chitosan chelates five to six times greater amount of metals than chitin due to the free amino groups exposed during deacetylation. Adsorption capacity of chitosan varies with affinity for water, percent deacetylation and amino group content. Chitosan has been modified and its composites have been produced to improve the adsorptive capacity. Composites like chitosan-coated calcium silicate hydrate (Zhao et al. 2014), chitosan polystyrene blend (Acharyulu et al. 2014), chitosan graft <b>acrylonitrile</b> <b>copolymer</b> (Shankar et al. 2014) and poly(vinyl alcohol)/citric acid/chitosan beads (Zuo and Balasubramanian 2013) have produced good results.

The concentration of ceftazidime in multiple plasma and dialysate or ultrafiltrate samples was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The diffusional clearances (CIdiffusion) and sieving coefficients of ceftazidime were compared by a mixed-model repeated-measures analysis of variance with filter and blood, dialysate inflow, or ultrafiltration rate as the main effect and the patient as a random effect. The fraction of ceftazidime bound to plasma proteins was 17 % ± 7 % (range, 10 to 25 %). The clearances of ceftazidime, urea, and creatinine by CVVHD were essentially constant at blood flow rates of 75 to 250 ml/min for all three filters. Significant linear relationships (P < 0. 0001) were observed between CIdiffusion of ceftazidime and clearance of urea for all three filters: AN 69 (slope = 0. 83), PMMA (slope = 0. 89), and PS (slope = 1. 03). Ceftazidime clearance was membrane independent during CVVH and CVVHD. CVVH and CVVHD can significantly augment the clearance of ceftazidime.

Synthesized polymers were characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), Simultaneus Thermal Analysis (STA) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). Fiber morphologies and nanoparticle sizes were examined via Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-Ray Diffractometer (XRD) and Tunneling Electron Microscopy (TEM). Electrochemical performance of metal nanooarticles was evaluated bv means of cyclic voltammetrv (CV...|$|R
40|$|<b>Acrylonitrile</b> {{acrylic acid}} <b>copolymer</b> was {{synthesised}} using suspension polymerisation and β-cyclodextrin was mixed with this copolymer in different ratios. then poly(acrylonitrile-acrylic acid) /-cyclodextrin (PANAA/-CD) nanowebs were produced using the electrospin-ning process. The effect of different electrospinning parameters such as polymer concentra-tion, distance, flow rate and voltage on nanofibre properties was studied. The presence of CD molecules in the PANAA solutions {{did not affect}} the diameter of nanofibres significantly. The presence of CD molecules in the PANAA/CD nanofibres produced was studied by means of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The molecular filtration capability of the nanowebs produced was studied using phenolphthalein as a model organic molecule, by means of a UV-Vis Spectrophotometer. Results show that the nanofibres produced are able to remove phenolphthalein effectively from the solution. These nanowebs have the poten-tial {{to be used as a}} molecular filter and/or nanofilter for filtration/purification/separation purposes.
