Continuous data assurance uses software to extract data from IT systems for analysis at the transactional level to provide more detailed assurance. CDA systems provide the ability to design expectation models for <b>analytical</b> <b>procedures</b> at the business-process level, {{as opposed to the}} current practice of relying on ratio or trend analysis at higher levels of data aggregation. CDA software can continuously and automatically monitor transactions, comparing their generic characteristics with predetermined benchmarks, thereby identifying anomalous situations. When significant discrepancies occur, alarms are triggered and routed to appropriate stakeholders and auditors.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} {{estimate}} the possible influence of the cartridge treatment on the perchlorate result, the equivalency of the analytical data obtained by direct sample injection (fundamental <b>analytical</b> <b>procedure)</b> and of the data obtained after injecting the sample after treatment (overall <b>analytical</b> <b>procedure)</b> the method of orthogonal regression described in [29] was used. Possible constant-systematic deviations were tested by the joined t-test and for potential proportional-systematic deviations the Chi-square-test was applied. Both statistical evaluations were applied to the perchlorate calibration (1.5 to 15  µg/L) for peak areas and peak heights. No proportional-systematic or constant-systematic deviations were found, proving the statistical equivalency of non-treated sample measurement and treated sample measurement. Due to this result, a calibration of the fundamental <b>analytical</b> <b>procedure</b> {{could be applied to}} all of the measurements for this study.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to develop a simplified <b>analytical</b> <b>procedure</b> for determining the optimal timing for upgrading low-volume roads in developing countries. Most roadway upgradings from gravel to surface treated and to asphaltic concrete are carried out when total transport cost on a road becomes high as a result of high traffic and the consequent rapid deterioration of the roadway. Adequate timing of upgrading strategies ensures effective use of resources and lower total transport cost. This study examined existing systems, models, and approaches for estimating total transport cost components. An <b>analytical</b> <b>procedure</b> was then developed using a decision-tree concept to delineate all possible upgrading strategies within a plan period. The decision-tree concept depicts all the possible upgrading strategies within a plan period with decisions on roadway upgrading made at certain decision intervals. The total transport cost of the upgrading strategies is evaluated to establish the optimal strategies and traffic warrants for improving a roadway surface. A computer program PVMNT was written to facilitate the computation of the total transport cost. A case study was presented to demonstrate the application of the <b>analytical</b> <b>procedure.</b> The case study revealed interesting results on the changes of optimal upgrading strategies with changes in base traffic volume and growth rate. However, general conclusions could not be drawn {{based on the results of}} the case study. These results, as well as the <b>analytical</b> <b>procedure,</b> should be of interest to engineers responsible for providing low-volume roads in developing countries...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a GC-MS <b>analytical</b> <b>procedure</b> for determining proteinaceous materials, glycerolipids, natural waxes and terpenoid resins {{in the same}} paint micro-sample. The procedure is also reliable when high amounts of interfering inorganic pigments, dryers and charges are present. The characterisation of proteinaceous binders in a paint sample can be subject to analytical interferences by inorganic materials. Such materials may form complexes with functional groups of proteins, thus preventing their efficient derivatisation, which is necessary prior to GC analysis. For this reason an <b>analytical</b> <b>procedure</b> has been developed based on two extractions and a clean-up step, {{in order to obtain}} two fractions: a lipid-resinous fraction and a proteinaceous fraction. The lipid-resinous fraction is subjected to salification/saponification assisted by microwaves, followed by acidification, extraction, derivatisation and GC-MS analysis. The proteinaceous fraction is analysed by CC-MS after hydrolysis and derivatisation of the freed amino acids. The desalting step is applied before the hydrolysis, and is based {{on the use of the}} monolithic sorbent tip technology with a C 4 stationary phase. Reference paint replicas of egg, casein and animal glue were prepared with and without several metals containing pigments, and used to develop and validate the <b>analytical</b> <b>procedure.</b> The procedure proved to be efficient in desalting the proteinaceous materials both from cations and anions. Although non quantitative, it is reliable in the analysis of samples whose content of extractable proteins is < 1 mu g, thus showing it to be suitable for the characterisation of paint samples. An example of how the <b>analytical</b> <b>procedure</b> was used to characterise a sample from a 15 th century panel painting is also discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
