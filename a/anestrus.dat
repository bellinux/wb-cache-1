5|$|Gestation lasts {{approximately}} 340days, with {{an average}} range 320–370 days, and usually results in one foal; twins are rare. Horses are a precocial species, and foals are capable of standing and running {{within a short time}} following birth. Foals are usually born in the spring. The estrous cycle of a mare occurs roughly every 19–22 days and occurs from early spring into autumn. Most mares enter an <b>anestrus</b> period during the winter and thus do not cycle in this period. Foals are generally weaned from their mothers between four and six months of age.|$|E
5|$|The least weasel mates in April–July {{and there}} is a 34- to 37-day {{gestation}} period. In the Northern Hemisphere, the average litter size consists of 6 kits and these reach sexual maturity in 3 to 4 months. Males may mate during their first year of life, though this is usually unsuccessful. They are fecund in February–October, though the early stages of spermatogenesis do occur throughout the winter months. <b>Anestrus</b> in females lasts from September until February.|$|E
25|$|Uterus: {{increased}} levels of estrogen during estrus cause edema within the uterus, making it feel heavier, and the uterus loses its tone. This edema decreases following ovulation, and the muscular tone increases. High levels of progesterone do not cause edema within the uterus. The uterus becomes flaccid during <b>anestrus.</b>|$|E
25|$|The estrous cycle (also spelled oestrous) {{controls}} when a mare is sexually receptive {{toward a}} stallion, {{and helps to}} physically prepare the mare for conception. It generally occurs during {{the spring and summer}} months, although some mares may be sexually receptive into the late fall, and is controlled by the photoperiod (length of the day), the cycle first triggered when the days begin to lengthen. The estrous cycle lasts about 19–22 days, with the average being 21 days. As the days shorten, the mare returns to a period when she is not sexually receptive, known as <b>anestrus.</b> <b>Anestrus</b> - occurring in the majority of, but not all, mares - prevents the mare from conceiving in the winter months, as that would result in her foaling during the harshest part of the year, a time when it would be most difficult for the foal to survive.|$|E
25|$|The {{hypothalamus}} {{is considered}} to be the central control for reproduction due to its role in hormone regulation. Hence, factors that determine when a seasonal breeder will be ready for mating affect this tissue. This is achieved specificlly through changes in the production of the hormone GnRH. GnRH in turn transits to the pituitary where it promotes the secretion of the gonadotropins LH and FSH, both pituitary hormones critical for reproductive function and behavior, into the bloodstream. Changes in gonadotropin secretion initiate the end of <b>anestrus</b> in females.|$|E
500|$|The ovaries are reddish, {{circular}} and flattened. They are {{enclosed in}} a conical bursa {{and have the}} dimensions [...] during <b>anestrus.</b> The oviducts are [...] long.

500|$|In {{addition}} to natural insemination by rams, artificial insemination and embryo transfers {{have been used}} in sheep breeding programs for many years in Australia and New Zealand. These programs have become more commonplace in the United States during the 2000s as the number of veterinarians qualified to perform these types of procedures with proficiency have grown. However, ovine AI is a relatively complicated procedure compared to other livestock. Unlike cattle or goats, which have straight cervices that can be vaginally inseminated, ewes have a curved cervix which is more difficult to access. Additionally, breeders were until recently unable to control their ewe's estrus cycles. The ability to control the estrus cycle is much easier today because of products that safely assist in aligning heat cycles. [...] Some examples of products are PG600, CIDRs, Estrumate and Folltropin V.

2500|$|Hence, {{seasonal}} breeders can {{be divided}} into groups based on fertility period. [...] "Long day" [...] breeders cycle when days get longer (spring) and are in <b>anestrus</b> in fall and winter. Some animals that are long day breeders include; ring-tailed lemurs, horses, hamsters, groundhogs, and mink. [...] "Short day" [...] breeders cycle when the length of daylight shortens (fall) and are in <b>anestrus</b> in spring and summer. The decreased light during the fall decreases the firing of the retinal nerves, in turn decreasing the excitation of the superior cervical ganglion, which then decreases the inhibition of the pineal gland, finally resulting in an increase in melatonin. This increase in melatonin results in an increase in GnRH and subsequently an increase in the hormones LH and FSH, which stimulate cyclicity. Some animals that are short day breeders include; sheep, goats, foxes, red deer, elk, moose, and mice.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{for most}} {{competitive}} purposes, foals are given an official [...] "birthday" [...] of January 1 (August 1 in the Southern hemisphere), and many breeders want foals {{to be born}} as {{early in the year}} as possible. Therefore, many breeding farms begin to put mares [...] "under lights" [...] in late winter in order to bring them out of <b>anestrus</b> early and allow conception to occur in February or March. One exception to this general rule is the field of endurance riding, which requires horses to be 60 true calendar months old (5 years) before competing at longer distances.|$|E
2500|$|Seasonal breeders are {{animal species}} that {{successfully}} mate only during certain {{times of the}} year. These times of year allow for the optimization of survival of young due to factors such as ambient temperature, food and water availability, {{and changes in the}} predation behaviors of other species. Related sexual interest and behaviors are expressed and accepted only during this period. Female seasonal breeders will have one or more estrus cycles only when she is [...] "in season" [...] or fertile and receptive to mating. At other times of the year, they will be <b>anestrus,</b> or have a dearth of their sexual cycle. Unlike reproductive cyclicity, seasonality is described in both males and females. Male seasonal breeders may exhibit changes in testosterone levels, testes weight, and fertility depending on the time of year.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anestrus</b> is {{the period}} of {{reproductive}} quiescence. The female has no attraction to or from the male. <b>Anestrus</b> generally lasts four to five months.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anestrus</b> {{refers to}} the phase when the sexual cycle rests. This is {{typically}} a seasonal event and controlled by light exposure through the pineal gland that releases melatonin. Melatonin may repress stimulation of reproduction in long-day breeders and stimulate reproduction in short-day breeders. Melatonin is thought to act by regulating the hypothalamic pulse activity of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone. <b>Anestrus</b> is induced by time of year, pregnancy, lactation, significant illness, chronic energy deficit, and possibly age.|$|E

50|$|Other signs {{suggesting}} EMS include elevated blood triglyceride {{levels and}} leptin levels, hypertension, and reproductive changes in mares (an increased diestrus period, {{and a lack}} of <b>anestrus).</b> Horses also occasionally show anemia and elevated Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) levels.|$|E
50|$|A mare may be 4 to 10 days in {{heat and}} about 14 days in diestrus. Thus a cycle may be short, e.g., 3 weeks. Horses mate {{in spring and}} summer, autumn is a {{transition}} time, and <b>anestrus</b> rules the winter.|$|E

The absence of affected fetuses or fetal remnants does not exclude PPV-induced reproductive failure.

50|$|A {{female dog}} is diestrous {{and goes into}} heat {{typically}} twice every year, although some breeds typically have one or three cycles a year.

50|$|The {{major and}} usually only {{clinical}} response to infection with PPV is maternal reproductive failure. Pathologic sequelae depend mainly on when exposure occurs during gestation. Dams may return to estrus, fail to farrow despite being <b>anestrus,</b> farrow few pigs per litter, or farrow {{a large proportion}} of mummified fetuses. All can reflect embryonic or fetal death or both. The only outward sign may be a decrease in maternal abdominal girth when fetuses die at midgestation or later and their associated fluids are resorbed. Other manifestations of maternal reproductive failure, namely, infertility, abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, and reduced neonatal vitality, also have been ascribed to infection with PPV. These are normally only a minor component of the disease. The presence of mummified fetuses in a litter can prolong both gestation and the farrowing interval. Either may result in stillbirth of apparently normal littermates, {{whether or not they are}} infected.|$|E
40|$|Aim: Postpartum <b>anestrus</b> {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{problems}} in buffalo reproduction; the knowledge of its incidence may be helpful to adopt preventive and therapeutic measures for improvement of reproductive efficiency and thus production of the dairy animals. Materials and Methods: To investigate the incidence of postpartum <b>anestrus,</b> a total 6105 Murrah and upgraded Murrah buffaloes were surveyed in and around the district of Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, India. Among these, 4708 and 1397 buffaloes were surveyed in organized and unorganized rearing system, respectively. Among the organized farms, 2050 and 2658 buffaloes were observed in good and moderate managemental condition, respectively. <b>Anestrus</b> and sub estrus were confirmed by per rectal examination and serum progesterone estimation. Results: The overall incidence of <b>anestrus</b> was recorded 29. 12 %. The incidence of <b>anestrus</b> was recorded 25. 84 % and 40. 15 %, respectively, in organized and unorganized rearing system, and among organized farms it was 22. 58 % and 28. 36 % in good and moderate managemental conditions, respectively. The incidence of <b>anestrus</b> in summer, rainy, and winter season was found to be 66. 28 %, 22. 51 %, and 11. 25 %, respectively. Based on per-rectal examination and serum progesterone concentration, 60. 58 per cent buffaloes were classified as true <b>anestrus,</b> 20. 88 per cent as sub estrus, and 18. 52 per cent <b>anestrus</b> due to other unknown conditions. Conclusion: These results indicated that the incidence of <b>anestrus,</b> especially true <b>anestrus,</b> was higher at farmer's door. Moreover, the incidence of <b>anestrus</b> was higher in summer season and hence appropriate preventive and or therapeutic measures as per the type of <b>anestrus</b> need to be undertaken...|$|E
