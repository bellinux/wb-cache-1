25|$|According to the College of Veterinary Medicine at Washington State University, the Shetland Sheepdog, {{and many}} other herding breeds, have a risk of being born with a MDR1 Gene Mutation, with about 15% of {{individuals}} affected. Cross-breeds are also affected. Dogs carrying Mdr1-1 share a common ancestor that experienced remarkable evolutionary success, having contributed genetically to at least nine distinct breeds of dog. Due to this genetic mutation, affected dogs may exhibit sensitivity or adverse reactions to many drugs, including <b>Acepromazine,</b> Butorphanol, Doxorubicin, Erythromycin, Ivermectin, Loperamide, Milbemycin, Moxidectin, Rifampin, Selamectin, Vinblastine, and Vincristine.|$|E
25|$|Berdella is {{believed}} to have killed his first victim on July 5, 1984. His first known victim was 19-year-old Jerry Howell, with whom he had become closely reacquainted in the year prior to his murder and whom he abducted on the promise of driving the youth to attend a dancing contest in Merriam. According to Berdella, he plied Howell with alcohol, Valium and <b>acepromazine</b> both in his car and at his house until the youth became unconscious. He then injected Howell with a heavy tranquilizer before binding the youth to his bed.|$|E
25|$|During an FBI raid on {{the organ}} donor {{facility}} where Dacyshyn works, he ends up escaping, leaving Bannan's severed head at the scene. Mulder, who accompanied Whitney on the raid, chases Dacyshyn to a building construction site. Whitney follows, and is killed when Dacyshyn pushes her down an elevator shaft. Scully, seeking a resolution, asks Joe, who has not yet heard {{of the discovery of}} Bannan's head, if he senses that she is still alive. He replies that she is. Discouraged but still determined, Mulder decides to investigate the incidents further. He starts by driving Scully's car to Nutter's Feed Store in a small town near the abductions, as the human remains contain <b>acepromazine,</b> an animal tranquilizer. When Dacyshyn coincidentally arrives moments later, Mulder slips out and follows him. Dacyshyn notices him, however, and runs his car off the road. Mulder survives and manages to tail Dacyshyn, who exits his truck after the engine fails, to a small compound in a former barn. Mulder enters, and the commotion caused by a two-headed guard dog brings Dacyshyn out from one of the buildings. The compound is being used by an east-European medical team that has been murdering people and stealing their organs for years. The field where Father Joe had earlier discovered the bodies turned out to be their dumping ground. Mulder enters the building to find that the team has been using the organs and body parts in an attempt to keep Tomczeszyn alive. At that moment, they attempt to place Tomczeszyn's head on the body of the second abducted woman. Mulder tries to save her from the gruesome fate, but a doctor comes from behind and injects him with a tranquilizer. Helpless, Mulder is taken outside to be murdered by Dacyshyn.|$|E

2500|$|Anesthesia {{in animals}} has many {{similarities}} to human anesthesia, but some differences as well. [...] Local anesthesia is primarily used for wound closure and removal of small tumors. Lidocaine, mepivacaine, and bupivacaine {{are the most}} commonly used local anesthetics used in veterinary medicine. Sedation without general anesthesia is used for more involved procedures. Sedatives commonly used include <b>acepromazine,</b> hydromorphine, midazolam, diazepam, xylazine, and medetomidine. α2 agonists like xylazine and medetomidine are especially useful because they can be reversed, xylazine by yohimbine and medetomidine by atipamezole. [...] Xylazine is approved for use in dogs, cats, horses, deer, and elk in the United States, while medetomidine is only approved for dogs.

2500|$|General {{anesthesia}} {{is commonly}} used in animals for major surgery. Animals are often premedicated intravenously or intramuscularly with a sedative, analgesic, and anticholinergic agent (dogs frequently receive buprenorphine, <b>acepromazine,</b> and glycopyrrolate). The next step is induction, usually with an intravenous drug. [...] Dogs and cats commonly receive thiopental (no longer allowed in the UK), ketamine with diazepam, tiletamine with zolazepam (usually just in cats), and/or propofol. Alfaxalone is a steroid anaesthetic used in many practices in the UK to induce anaesthesia in cats and sometimes dogs. It is similar in physiological effect but different in composition to the now withdrawn Saffan. [...] Horses commonly receive thiopental and guaifenesin. [...] Following induction, the animal is intubated with an endotracheal tube and maintained on a gas anesthetic. [...] The most common gas anesthetics in use in veterinary medicine are isoflurane, enflurane, and halothane, although desflurane and sevoflurane are becoming more popular due to rapid induction and recovery.|$|E
50|$|Literature {{from the}} 1950s raised {{concerns}} about phenothiazine-induced seizures in human patients. For this reason, caution has typically been advised when contemplating <b>acepromazine</b> use in epileptic canine patients, as it was widely believed to lower the seizures threshold. More current studies, however, have failed to show a positive association between use of <b>acepromazine</b> and seizure activity and show a possible role for <b>acepromazine</b> in seizure control: in a retrospective study at University of Tennessee, <b>acepromazine</b> was administered for tranquilization to 36 dogs with a prior history of seizures and to decrease seizure activity in 11 dogs. No seizures were seen within 16 hours of <b>acepromazine</b> administration in the 36 dogs that received the drug, and the seizures abated for 1.5 to 8 hours (n=6) or did not recur (n=2) in eight of 10 dogs that were actively seizing. Excitement-induced seizures were reduced for 2 months in one dog. A second retrospective study also concluded that administration of <b>acepromazine</b> to dogs with prior or acute seizure history did not potentiate seizures, {{and there was some}} trend toward seizure reduction. It {{should be noted that the}} original seizure cautions reported in the 1950s were in human patients on relatively high doses of the antipsychotic chlorpromazine while the doses of <b>acepromazine</b> used in the two published veterinary studies cited above are much lower.|$|E

50|$|In some boxers, <b>acepromazine</b> {{can cause}} vasovagal syncope (due to a {{decreased}} {{stimulation of the}} sympathetic nervous system) and hypotension (due to vasodilation), leading to collapse. This may occur only in certain families of boxers, but the unknown risk to a individual dog means that <b>acepromazine</b> should be used at reduced doses, or not at all, in this breed. Individual dogs of any breed can have a profound reaction characterized by hypotension, especially {{if there is an}} underlying heart problem.|$|E
50|$|P-glycoprotein (P-gp), {{also known}} as multidrug {{resistant}} protein 1 (MDR1), is a protein found in cell membranes which {{is important in the}} metabolism and excretion of some drugs, such as <b>acepromazine</b> and ivermectin. This protein is encoded by the ABCB1 gene (previously known as the MDR1 gene). A mutation in ABCB1 prevents P-gp from being correctly produced, so that dogs with this mutation have an increased sensitivity to drugs (such as <b>acepromazine)</b> which are substrates of P-gp. Dogs which are heterozygous (that is, which have one functioning ABCB1 gene, and one non-functioning gene) are less sensitive to <b>acepromazine</b> than dogs which are homozygous (that is, which have two copies of the mutant gene). 75% of Collies carry the mutated ABCB1 gene, as do 50% of Australian Shepherds. Other affected breeds include: Border Collie, English Shepherd, German Shepherd, Old English Sheepdog, and Sighthounds, shelties, long haired greyhound.|$|E
50|$|Side {{effects are}} not common, but {{the use of}} <b>acepromazine</b> in stallions should be used with caution (but is not {{absolutely}} contraindicated) due to the risk of paraphimosis and priapism.|$|E

50|$|<b>Acepromazine</b> also lowers blood pressure, {{and should}} {{therefore}} be used with caution in horses that are experiencing anemia, dehydration, shock, or colic. It {{should not be used}} in horses dewormed with piperazine.|$|E
50|$|Pentafusion, or the {{administration}} of ketamine, lidocaine, morphine, detomidine, and <b>acepromazine</b> at a constant rate of infusion, may be of particular benefit to horses suffering from laminitis. Epidurals may also be used in hind-limb laminitis.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} uses of <b>acepromazine</b> in animals are as an oral {{sedative}} before stressful events (such as thunderstorms), an injectable tranquilizer for particularly aggressive or fractious animal, and {{when combined with}} opiates, a premedication or a post-operative pain reliever. Its effects as a CNS depressant means that less opiates are required to reach {{the same amount of}} sedation, and it prevents the arrhythmia and vomiting that many opiates induce. Its use as an oral sedative is somewhat controversial; <b>acepromazine</b> can increase sensitivity to noise and cause exaggerated startle reflexes. The dysphoric effect of phenothiazines and this increase in sensitivity can make some aggressive dogs and fractious cats more so.|$|E
50|$|In equine surgery, {{premedication}} with <b>acepromazine</b> {{has been}} shown to reduce the perianaesthetic mortality rate, possibly due to its actions as a sedative and anxiolytic. It is less effective as a sedative if the horse is already excited.|$|E
50|$|<b>Acepromazine,</b> acetopromazine or acetylpromazine (more {{commonly}} known as ACP, Ace, or by the trade names Atravet or Acezine 2, number depending on mg/ml dose) is a phenothiazine derivative antipsychotic drug. It was used on humans during the 1950s as an antipsychotic, but is now almost exclusively used on animals as a sedative and antiemetic. Its closely related analogue, chlorpromazine, is still used as an antipsychotic in humans. <b>Acepromazine</b> is used primarily as a chemical restraint in hyperactive or fractious animals. However, it does not relieve anxiety, and some believe it may make anxiety worse {{in the long run}} if used on an anxious animal (for example, thunderstorm phobias).The standard pharmaceutical preparation, <b>acepromazine</b> maleate, is used in veterinary medicine in dogs, and cats. It is used widely in horses as a pre-anesthetic sedative and has been shown to reduce anesthesia related death. However, it should be used with caution (but is not absolutely contraindicated) in stallions due to the risk of paraphimosis and persistent priapism. Its potential for cardiac effects, namely hypotension due to peripheral vasodilation, can be profound and as such is not recommended for use in geriatric or debilitated animals.|$|E
50|$|In {{veterinary}} anesthesia, butorphanol (trade name: Torbugesic) {{is widely}} used as a sedative and analgesic in dogs, cats and horses. For sedation, it may be combined with tranquilizers such as alpha-2 agonists (medetomidine), benzodiazepines, or <b>acepromazine</b> in dogs, cats and exotic animals. It is frequently combined with xylazine or detomidine in horses.|$|E
50|$|Large Animal Immobilon is a {{combination}} of etorphine plus <b>acepromazine</b> maleate. An etorphine antidote Large Animal Revivon contains mainly diprenorphine for animals and a human-specific naloxone-based antidote, which should be prepared prior to the etorphine. A 5-15 mg dose is enough to immobilize an African elephant and a 2-4 mg dose is enough to immobilize a Black Rhino.|$|E
50|$|Rodent {{cocktail}} is an anesthetic mixture {{used for}} rodents in research. The injectable, clear liquid {{is a mixture}} of ketamine, xylazine, and <b>acepromazine.</b> The ratio used depends on the species of rodent. This mixture is often preferred by researchers because of its low mortality in rodents, its relatively quick recovery time (one hour after injection), and low cost.|$|E
50|$|While <b>acepromazine</b> is {{also used}} in cats, its {{absorption}} is erratic and can differ wildly from one cat to the next. It also generally induces less sedation than in dogs. It also causes spontaneous motor activity (in both cats and dogs, but more often in cats) by blocking dopamine receptors in the striatum and substantia nigra.|$|E
5000|$|StimulantsAmong the equine stimulants are amphetamines, {{as well as}} the amphetamine-like {{drugs such}} as {{methylphenidate}} (Ritalin). [...] TranquilizersHorses can also be medicated to win by relaxing them, and allowing the horse to run its best possible race or show with an appearance. The widely used tranquilizer <b>acepromazine,</b> and any number of related or equivalent agents, have been used in this way. Higher doses of tranquilizers can also decrease a horse's performance.|$|E
5000|$|Additionally, <b>acepromazine</b> {{is used as}} a {{vasodilator}} in {{the treatment}} of laminitis, where an oral dose equivalent to [...] "mild sedation" [...] is commonly used, although the dose used is highly dependent on the treating veterinarian. While it is shown to elicit vasodilation in the distal limb, evidence showing its efficacy at increasing perfusion in the laminae is lacking. It is also sometimes used to treat a horse experiencing equine exertional rhabdomyolysis.|$|E
