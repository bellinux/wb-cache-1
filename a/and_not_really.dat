5|$|Note {{that these}} numbers are for the {{terrestrial}} surface <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> a global average. Whether dimming (or brightening) occurred over the ocean has {{been a bit of}} an unknown though a specific measurement (see below, Causes) measured effects some 400 miles (643.7km) from India over the Indian Ocean towards the Maldives Islands. Regional effects probably dominate but are not strictly confined to the land area, and the effects will be driven by regional air circulation. A 2009 review by Wild et al. found that widespread variation in regional and time effects. There was solar brightening beyond 2000 at numerous stations in Europe, the United States, and Korea. The brightening seen at sites in Antarctica during the 1990s, influenced by recovering from the Mount Pinatubo volcanic eruption in 1991, fades after 2000. The brightening tendency also seems to level off at sites in Japan. In China there is some indication for a renewed dimming, after the stabilization in the 1990s. A continuation of the long-lasting dimming is also noted at the sites in India. Overall, the available data suggest continuation of the brightening beyond the year 2000 at numerous locations, yet less pronounced and coherent than during the 1990s, with more regions with no clear changes or declines. Therefore, globally, greenhouse warming after 2000 may be less modulated by surface solar variations than in prior decades. The largest reductions are found in the northern hemisphere mid-latitudes. Visible light and infrared radiation seem to be most affected rather than the ultraviolet part of the spectrum.|$|E

[...] The song became Madonna's fourth number-one single in the U.S. and also reached the top spot in Canada, Ireland, Italy, and the United Kingdom. [...] "True Blue" [...] {{was released}} as the album's third single in September 1986. It is a dance-pop song inspired by the Motown's girl groups from the 1960s.

In the United Kingdom, [...] "In the Dark" [...] was released in a digital extended play (EP) alongside three remixes of the track {{as well as its}} music video. Rapper Flo Rida is featured on an official remix of the song, and Dev stated that she wanted to make a remix as it would be refreshing and [...] "great for radio". She explained that a rapper would suit the song well and that she would enjoy the remix when hearing it on the radio. She elaborated on choosing Flo Rida, saying: [...] "We went in thinking about who would be cool on the radio and who would fit the fact that it's kind of a flavorful song <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> a hood rap song.

500|$|On August 4, Yankovic began {{recording}} parodies {{starting with}} [...] "Living With a Hernia". The song, a spoof of [...] "Living in America" [...] by James Brown—which {{was also the}} theme to the 1985 film [...] Rocky IV—is about hernias. When {{it came time to}} pick a song to parody as the lead single for Polka Party! Scotti Brothers Records [...] "had some very strong ideas" [...] and wished to have Yankovic parody a musician who was signed on the same label. After [...] "Living in America" [...] became a hit, the record label insisted that Yankovic parody the song, to which Yankovic obliged. In order to accurately write the song, Yankovic researched the various types of hernias. Yankovic noted that [...] "it was a real thrill to do James Brown. I'm a total non-dancer, never went to any dances in high school, but if I analytically dissect a dance routine I can figure it out." [...] A choreographer named Chester Whitmore was hired to accurately create the dance scenes featured in the video, which was shot on the concert set actually used in the movie Rocky IV. The second parody recorded was [...] "Addicted to Spuds", a pastiche of [...] "Addicted to Love" [...] by Robert Palmer, about a man's obsession for potatoes and potato-based dishes. A music video for the song was never made to the song because there was a strict budget for videos for the album, and Yankovic felt that the video would be one big joke <b>and</b> <b>not</b> <b>really</b> worth its own video. A parody of Palmer's video, however, was later inserted into Al's [...] "UHF" [...] video.|$|E
