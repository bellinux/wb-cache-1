Patients and Methods A total of 811 men who underwent transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) -guided TP biopsy from January 2008 to June 2012 at our two institutions were retrospectively analyzed. Among these 811 men, 672 received no <b>antithrombotic</b> <b>agents</b> (group I), 103 received and continued administration of <b>antithrombotic</b> <b>agents</b> (group II), and 36 interrupted administration of <b>antithrombotic</b> <b>agents</b> (group III). Overall complications were graded and hemorrhagic complications were compared (group I with group II) using propensity score matching (PSM) analysis. Results An overall complication rate of 4. 6 % was recorded. Hemorrhagic complications occurred in 1. 8 % and they were virtually identical in all the three groups, and no severe hemorrhagic complications occurred. One patient in group III required intensive care unit admission for cerebral infarction. PSM analysis revealed no statistical difference between groups I and II {{with regard to the}} incidence of gross hematuria, perineal hematoma, and rectal bleeding.

30|$|As the world’s {{population}} ages rapidly, {{a relatively}} high proportion of patients are on prescribed medication for comorbidities; these medications include long-term antithrombotic therapy using low-dose aspirin, clopidogrel/ticlopidine, and warfarin. Several prospective studies support the safety of continuation of low-dose aspirin in TRUS biopsy (Giannarini et al. 2007; Maan et al. 2003). Conversely, no recommendation exists regarding the management of non-aspirin <b>antithrombotic</b> <b>agents</b> (warfarin or clopidogrel/ticlopidine) before a TRUS biopsy. Clinicians have three options for management, depending on the risk of thrombosis. First, <b>antithrombotic</b> <b>agents</b> can be continued during procedures associated with low rates of bleeding complications. Second, they can be discontinued for several days prior to the procedure and restarted thereafter. Third, they can be discontinued with bridging anticoagulation using heparin (heparin bridging therapy), administered during the sub-therapeutic window, in patients {{at high risk of}} thromboembolic events (Douketis et al. 2008; El-Hakim and Moussa 2010). However, there are few prospective studies regarding the relationship between TRUS biopsy and continuation of <b>antithrombotic</b> <b>agents.</b> Furthermore, the safety of short-term discontinuation of <b>antithrombotic</b> <b>agents</b> with heparin bridging therapy in TRUS biopsy has not been well documented.

This analogue, having a P-C-P bridge in place of a P-O-P internucleoside linkage, has been found resistant to phosphodiesterase activity. Rabbits were infused with the dinucleotide at a dose of 50 mg per kg over a 2 -hr period, at a controlled rate by pump. A 1 -cm length of polyethylene cannula (1 mm i. d.) was tied into the carotid artery. Animals were stable under general anesthesia during the entire period of the experiment. In the control group, 16 of 20 animals formed clots, an incidence of 80 %, whereas in the test animals, 6 of the 20 formed clots (30 % incidence, P < 0. 05). After preincubation of whole blood with 50 microM AppCHClppA at 37 degrees C for up to 3 hr, a consistent suppression of ADP-induced platelet aggregation was observed.

The safety and efficacy of the endoscopic tissue sealing method with PGA sheets and fibrin glue {{for the prevention of}} post-ESD bleeding were examined in 104 patients taking <b>antithrombotic</b> <b>agents.</b> During the study period, 70 patients taking <b>antithrombotic</b> <b>agents</b> did not undergo the sealing method, 36 patients discontinued <b>antithrombotic</b> <b>agents,</b> and 724 patients had not received antithrombotic therapy. Results. Delayed bleeding rates were 3. 8 % (4 / 104) in the sealing group, 12. 9 % (9 / 70) in the nonsealing group, 8. 3 % (3 / 36) in the discontinuation group, and 4. 6 % (33 / 724) in the nonantithrombotic therapy group. Thus, the delayed bleeding rate was signific ntly lower in the sealing group than in the nonsealing group and comparable to that in the nonantithrombotic therapy group. Conclusions.

30|$|When {{patients}} {{have a high}} risk of thromboembolism, either continuation of <b>antithrombotic</b> <b>agents</b> or discontinuation of <b>antithrombotic</b> <b>agents</b> with heparin bridging therapy is required. As a definitive recommendation regarding the management of <b>antithrombotic</b> <b>agents</b> before TRUS biopsy is yet to be established, the benefits and adverse effects of heparin bridging therapy are debatable. Clinicians have traditionally discontinued <b>antithrombotic</b> <b>agents</b> and started heparin bridging therapy, depending on the risk of thrombotic events (Douketis et al. 2008; El-Hakim and Moussa 2010). The guidelines for the management of <b>antithrombotic</b> <b>agents</b> for endoscopic procedures suggest heparin bridging therapy for higher-risk procedures (e.g., polypectomy) in high-risk patients (e.g., those with atrial fibrillation with mechanical valves, valvular heart disease, and/or a history of cerebrovascular accidents, and those who experience transient ischemic attacks) (Murasaki 2011). A recent prospective study suggested that heparin bridging therapy increased the risk of bleeding complications from interruption alone (0.8 %) to bridging (13 %) in colonoscopy and oral and ophthalmic surgeries (Garcia et al. 2008). However, there is little reliable evidence for the benefits and harm associated with heparin bridging therapy in TRUS biopsy. To our knowledge, this is the first report to describe the risk of heparin bridging therapy for TRUS biopsy in patients requiring temporary discontinuation of <b>antithrombotic</b> <b>agents.</b> Our data suggested that discontinuation of <b>antithrombotic</b> <b>agents</b> with heparin bridging therapy increased the incidence of complications after TRUS biopsy. Furthermore, there was an increase in bleeding-related complications and urinary tract infections. Although the majority of complication grades were low (1 or 2), the incidence rate of complications was significantly higher in heparin bridging patients than in control patients. Similarly to a previous study (Garcia et al. 2008), our results suggested the possibility that heparin bridging therapy may cause more harm than good. From a different perspective, this is reasonable because patients who are indicated for heparin bridging therapy have a number of severe comorbidities. In fact, our patients treated with heparin bridging therapy had a significantly higher prevalence of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, it is possible that those patients who were recommended heparin bridging therapy have a high risk for complications, and careful management of such complications is required in these patients.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Ximelagatran, {{the first}} oral direct {{thrombin}} inhibitor, {{was shown to}} be an effective <b>antithrombotic</b> <b>agent</b> but was associated with potential liver toxicity after prolonged administration. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: The aim of the EXTEND study was to assess safety and efficacy of extended administration (35 days) of ximelagatran or enoxaparin for the prevention of venous thromboembolism after elective hip replacement and hip fracture surgery. A follow-up period, including assessment of liver enzymes (in particular alanine aminotransferase; ALAT), until post-operative day 180 was planned, with visits at days 56 and 180. RESULTS: Randomization and administration of study drugs were stopped following a report of serious liver injury occurring 3 weeks after completion of ximelagatran treatment. At the time of study termination, 1158 patients had been randomized and 641 had completed the 35 -day treatment; with 303 ximelagatran and 265 enoxaparin patients remaining in the study through to the day 56 follow-up visit. Overall, 58 patients showed an ALAT increase to > 2 x upper limit of normal: 31 treated with enoxaparin, 27 with ximelagatran. Three ximelagatran patients also showed symptoms potentially related to liver toxicity. Eleven ximelagatran patients showed an ALAT increase after study treatment ended. The clinical development of ximelagatran was terminated and the drug withdrawn from the market. Evaluation of the relative efficacy of the two treatments as specified in the protocol was impossible due to the premature termination of the study. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged administration of ximelagatran was associated with an increased risk of liver toxicity.

There {{was no significant difference in}} average operative time (51 minutes versus 54 minutes), or average days to removal of urethral catheter (3. 7 days versus 3. 3 days) between the study and control groups. Hemorrhagic and ischemic complications were noted in 11 (10. 5 %) and 2 (1. 9 %) patients in the study group and 11 (6. 4 %) and none (0 %) of the patients in the control group, respectively, with no significant difference between the 2 groups. However, prevalence of hemorrhagic complications in patients receiving heparin bridging therapy (21. 4 %) was significantly higher than that in the control group. Ischemic complications in the study group included chest pain suggestive of angina in one patient and acute myocardial infarction leading to death in another patient. We should pay attention to hemorrhagic complications in patients receiving heparin bridging therapy and keep in mind the possibility of lethal ischemic complications after discontinuation of <b>antithrombotic</b> <b>agents...</b>|$|R
