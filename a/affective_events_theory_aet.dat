5000|$|<b>Affective</b> <b>events</b> <b>theory</b> (<b>AET)</b> {{is a model}} {{developed}} by organizational psychologists Howard M. Weiss (Purdue University) and Russell Cropanzano (University of Colorado) to explain how emotions and moods influence job performance and job satisfaction. The model explains the linkages between employees' internal influences (e.g., cognitions, emotions, mental states) and their reactions to incidents that occur in their work environment that affect their performance, organizational commitment, and job satisfaction. The theory proposes that affective work behaviors are explained by employee mood and emotions, while cognitive-based behaviors are the best predictors of job satisfaction. The theory proposes that positive-inducing (e.g., uplifts) as well as negative-inducing (e.g., hassles) emotional incidents at work are distinguishable and have a significant psychological impact upon workers' job satisfaction. [...] This results in lasting internal (e.g., cognition, emotions, mental states) and external affective reactions exhibited through job performance, job satisfaction, and organizational commitment.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{current study}} aims {{to explore the}} causes, {{characteristics}} and consequences of workplace anger expression and suppression, with an additional aim of testing the emotional dimension of <b>Affective</b> <b>Events</b> <b>Theory.</b> Design/methodology/approach: Participants (n= 187) from management and non-management positions completed an event-contingent anger diary {{over a period of}} four working weeks, alongside measures on trait anger and job satisfaction. Findings: Over fifty per cent of the sample disclosed anger causing events. In keeping with <b>Affective</b> <b>Events</b> <b>Theory</b> disposition was important, with trait anger higher in those disclosing anger causing events. There appeared a range of factors predicting the expression of anger, with these focused primarily on individual issues and pre-existing emotion rather than work characteristics.

It notes the value in focusing on discrete emotion. The findings offers clear direction for future research that could assist with enhancing models of workplace emotion, particularly if the aim is to account for discrete emotions...|$|R

40|$|Since its {{publication}} in 1996, <b>Affective</b> <b>Events</b> <b>Theory</b> (<b>AET)</b> {{has come to}} be regarded as the seminal explanation for structure, causes and consequences of affective experiences at work. AET does not, however, elucidate why, how and when objects and events in the worplace trigger moods and emotions which in turn influence cognitive and behavioral outcomes. Consequently, AET does not yet provide us with a theoretical basis upon which to predict the way in which contextual, cognitive motivational, or individual factors might moderate the impact of workplace events on affective states and subsequent behavior.

This paper addresses this gap by applying <b>Affective</b> <b>Events</b> <b>Theory</b> (<b>AET)</b> to further our understanding of how events in the workplace trigger influence employees’ workplace psychological well-being. More specifically, this paper studies the impact of positive and negative events on employees’ psychological wellbeing, accounting for the moderating effects of their personality traits and servant leadership.

40|$|Extract:Affective <b>Events</b> <b>Theory</b> (<b>AET)</b> (Weiss and Cropanzano, 1996) {{proposes that}} {{organizational}} events are proximal causes of affective reactions. 2 ̆ 2 Things happen {{to people in}} work settings and people often react emotionally to these <b>events.</b> These <b>affective</b> experiences have direct influences on behaviors and attitudes 2 ̆ 2. Recent research by Fisher (1998) has supported the hypothesized relationship between aggregated moment to moment emotions at work and outcomes such as job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and intention to quit. AET also proposes that stable work environment features such as job scope predispose the occurrence of certain types of affect-producing events. For instance, an enriched job might more often lead to discrete events involving feedback, task accomplishment, and optimal challenge, which may then lead to positive emotions such as pride, happiness, and enthusiasm...|$|R

These problems can then persist on subsequent days. However, AET also argues that individual strategies can diminish the ill effects of negative events. We explicitly focused on good sportsmanship or abstaining from unnecessary complaints and criticism as a possible moderator {{of the effects of}} daily negative work events on daily work engagement and positive affect. We tested this possibility with a 3 -day diary study among 112 employees. As expected, we found that daily negative events lowered daily engagement and momentary positive affect for two consecutive days. However, this effect only held on days that people exhibited low sportsmanship. For days that people exhibited high sportsmanship, there were no significant effects. Creating a resource rich work environment that enhances individuals’ sportsmanship behaviour can help to minimize the unfavourable impact of daily negative events...|$|E
40|$|Beginning in the 1990 s and {{following}} decades of neglect, {{what came to}} be referred to as the Affective Revolution has radically transformed our understanding of the role played by emotion in organizational psychology and organizational behavior (OPOB). In this article, we review the field of emotion in the workplace from different perspectives, corresponding to five discrete levels of analysis: (a) within-person temporal effects, (b) between-person (personality and attitudes) factors, (c) interpersonal behaviors (perception and communication of emotion), (d) group level (leadership and teams), and (e) organizational level (culture and climate). Within these perspectives, we address the importance of <b>affective</b> <b>events</b> <b>theory</b> (<b>AET)</b> and its interaction with emotional intelligence, emotional labor, and emotional contagion, as well as the role of emotion in leadership and organizational culture and climate. We conclude by presenting an integrative model that shows how the five levels are linked, followed by discussion of measurement issues, ideas and areas for future research, and suggestions for practice...|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} {{predicated}} {{on the idea that}} leaders shape workplace affective events. Based on <b>Affective</b> <b>Events</b> <b>Theory</b> (<b>AET),</b> I argue that leaders are sources of employee positive and negative emotions at work. Certain leader behaviors displayed during interactions with their employees are the sources of these affective events. The second theoretical underpinning of the article is the Asymmetry Effect of emotion. Consistent with this theory, employees are more likely to recall negative incidents than positive incidents. In a qualitative study, evidence that these processes exist in the workplace was found. Leader behaviors were sources of positive or negative emotional responses in employees; employees recalled more negative incidents than positive incidents, and they recalled them more intensely and in more detail than positive incidents. Consequently, leaders may need to exercise their emotional intelligence to generate emotional uplifts to overcome the hassles in the workplace that employees seem to remember so vividly.

The paper contributes to the evaluation of the role of emotions and the value of <b>Affective</b> <b>Events</b> <b>Theory</b> (<b>AET)</b> in studies of leadership by (a) identifying the obstacles to innovation and performance in R&D teams, (b) testing the relations between negative events, team affective climate, and team performance, and (c) by identifying the role of team leadership in response to negative events in R&D teams.

40|$|Customer {{service workers}} are {{frequently}} subjected to aggression of varying intensity from those individuals they serve – their customers. Using <b>Affective</b> <b>Events</b> <b>Theory</b> (<b>AET)</b> a conceptual model {{is presented to}} investigate individual attachment style, emotion regulation, the experience of customer service aggression, and related attitudes and behaviours. Emotions in the Workplace Emotions affect every aspect of life, including the workplace. Organizational researchers have demonstrated that emotions and affect play a powerful role {{in many areas of}} human resources and organizational behaviour, including selection, training, performance management, customer service (Ashkanasy & Daus, 2002), and leadership (Dasborough & Ashkanasy, 2002). Early research on emotions at work emerged in the 1930 s, after which it declined and remained relatively understudied until the 1990 s (Fox & Spector, 2002) when it re-emerged as a topic of interest in organizational research (Brief & Weiss, 2002). One of the domains in which this renewal of interest is particularly notable is the customer service context, where workers are expected to manage negative emotions and display positive emotions while facing demands that include aggressive behaviour from customers (Grandey &...|$|E
40|$|One {{feature of}} a {{democratic}} society is voice, especially the freedom to dissent. One form of dissent of relevance to organizational scholars is complaining, whether it be complaints from employee stakeholder groups or customer stakeholder groups. Despite the increased ability that the knowledge economy provides for people of {{all walks of life}} and nationalities to voice complaint, {{little is known about the}} antecedents and consequences of complaining. This paper addresses this issue with respect to customers' response to service failures. Specifically, this paper develops a conceptual model for service settings building upon a model of emotional and cognitive response formation to an affective event (Hartel, McColl-Kennedy & Bennett, 2002), and its source theory, Weiss and Cropanzano's (1995) <b>Affective</b> <b>Events</b> <b>Theory</b> (<b>AET).</b> We argue that when a service failure occurs, a number of cognitive and affective responses take place in consumers. The proposed model aims to operationalize affective responses to service failures in the marketplace. 'Affective response' refers to cognitive, emotional, behavioral and neuropsychological responses to emotional events. As such, the model makes explicit the relationships between and factors within each of these domains of affect expression...|$|E

40|$|Each year company crises {{such as that}} {{involving}} Shell's {{actions in}} Nigeria and Europe generate substantial negative publicity, costing {{millions of dollars in}} lost sales due to reduced consumer purchase intentions. The little research that exists on crises mainly employs attributional theory (AT) and shows that consumer anger is the immediate antecedent of negative purchase intentions. While AT recognises that an appraisal of personal relevance of the event to the consumer is a crucial determinant of anger intensity, this variable is not included in the AT model. One model that does apply both the construct of personal relevance and emotions to negative events is Weiss and Cropanzano's (1996) <b>Affective</b> <b>Events</b> <b>Theory</b> (<b>AET).</b> AET identifies personal relevance of goals as comprising event appraisal. We modify AET for the context of mishaps, arguing that the broader construct of involvement is more appropriate to apply to company crises.

40|$|Based on {{data from}} 2091 call centre representatives working in 85 call centres in the UK, central {{assumptions}} of <b>affective</b> <b>events</b> <b>theory</b> (<b>AET)</b> are tested. AET predicts that specific features of work (e. g. autonomy) {{have an impact on}} the arousal of emotions and moods at work that, in turn, co-determine job satisfaction of employees. AET further proposes that job satisfaction is an evaluative judgement that mainly explains cognitive-based behaviour, whereas emotions and moods better predict affective-based behaviour. The results support these assumptions. A clear separation of key constructs (job satisfaction, positive and negative emotions) was possible. Moreover, correlations between several work features (e. g. supervisory support) and job satisfaction were, in part, mediated by work emotions, even when controlling for gender, age, call centre type (in-house versus outsourced centres) and call centre size. Predictions regarding consequences of satisfaction and affect were partly corroborated as continuance commitment was more strongly related to job satisfaction than to positive emotions. In addition, affective commitment and health complaints were related to both emotions and job satisfaction to the same extent. Thus, AET is a fruitful framework for explaining why and how specific management strategies used for designing work features influence important organizational attitudes and well-being of employees. © 2006 British Academy of Management...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide insight into the affective or {{emotional}} mechanisms that underlie the relationship between high-performance HR practices (HPHRP) and employee attitudes and behaviours. Drawing on <b>affective</b> <b>events</b> <b>theory</b> (<b>AET),</b> this paper examines a mediation model in which HPHRP influence positive affect which in turn affects job satisfaction and organizational citizenship behaviours (OCBs). Design/methodology/approach – Two-wave data was collected from a sample of local government workers in Wales (N= 362). HPHRP were measured together with job satisfaction and OCBs at Time 1 and six months later, job satisfaction and OCBs were measured again together with positive affect. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to test the study hypotheses. Findings – The results revealed that HPHRP induced positive affect which, in turn, led to increased job satisfaction and OCBs. Furthermore, positive affect fully mediated the relationships between HPHRP and both job satisfaction and OCBs. Research limitations/implications – All data were collected from public sector employees in the government of Wales, which makes the generalizability of the findings unknown. More work is needed using different samples to determine whether the study results are replicable. Practical implications – Managers should endeavour to ensure that enough resources are assigned to the implementation of HPHRP and other work features that help evoke affective reactions, as these reactions are an important determinant of employees’ attitudes and behaviours. Originality/value – This is one of the first studies to empirically examine the mediating role of positive affect on the relationship between HPHRP and employee attitudes and behaviours...|$|E
40|$|The {{forces of}} {{globalisation}} {{over the last}} few decades have created opportunities for intemational business as never before, whilst leaving no organisation immune to competition. With the Global Financial Crisis impacting the world economy, the BRIC economies as a group - Brazil, Russia, India and China, have steadily benefited from continuing growth in 2008 and 2009 (Bhattacharya, Hemerling and Waltermann, 2010). Despite China being a key international trading partner for Australia, the number of successful joint ventures and negotiations between the two countries remains limited. A closer examination of the international business interactions between Australia and China is thus urgently needed. When negotiating with the Chinese, Western managers may not always be aware of what they are really negotiating for. To be successful, they have to be equipped with the 2 ̆ 7 specialised knowledge 2 ̆ 7, a form of 2 ̆ 7 tacit or implicit knowledge 2 ̆ 7, which comes with experience (Nonaka, 1994, Pavesi, 2003) in communicating and negotiating with their Chinese counterparts. The Chinese way of business negotiation can challenge the logic of Western business thinking. This, coupled with possible generational differences or changes in the Chinese business counterpart 2 ̆ 7 s way of doing business, means we must try to understand the business communication and negotiation process from not only the Western but also the Chinese perspective. In particular, in addition to the contextual (Phatak, & Habib, 1996; Risberg, 1997), social (Ghauri, & Fang, 2001), and cognitive factors (George, Gareth, & Gonzalez, 1998) focused on by past researchers, the intangible aspects of negotiation must also be considered. These include trust, reputation, relationship quality (guanxi {{in the case of the}} Chinese), and the moods and emotions that shape the processes and outcomes of communication and negotiation (Griffith, 2002; Hartel & Ma, 2006; Ma & Hartel 2005; and Zhao & Krohmer, 2006). This paper reports on a qualitative investigation of the communication processes occurring in negotiations between Australian and Chinese managers and entrepreneurs. The examination is based on a theoretical framework looking at emotions and culture from an <b>affective</b> <b>events</b> <b>theory</b> (<b>AET)</b> perspective. Both interview and focus groups techniques were used. Findings identified guanxi, core to relationship development and maintenance in Chinese culture, together with emotions as major determining factors of negotiation outcomes. Findings also suggest there are generational differences in attitudes among Chinese managers with Gen. X and Gen. Y placing a different emphasis on guanxi in business. These findings suggest that the popular advice to people doing business in China is out of date. <br /...|$|E
