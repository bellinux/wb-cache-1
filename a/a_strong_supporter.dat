5|$|Adams was {{concerned}} about the new Constitution and made an attempt to re-enter national politics.

Despite his defeat, Adams continued to work for amendments to the Constitution, a movement that ultimately resulted in the addition of a Bill of Rights in 1791. Adams subsequently became a firm supporter of the Constitution, with these amendments and the possibility of more.|$|R

5|$|A {{collective}} {{leadership was}} founded immediately after Khrushchev's ouster, consisting of Brezhnev as First Secretary, Kosygin {{as head of}} government, and Anastas Mikoyan (and later Nikolai Podgorny) as head of state. From the beginning, Suslov was a vocal critic of one-man rule such as that seen under Joseph Stalin and Khrushchev. While he condemned Stalin's one-man rule, he equally criticised the individualistic assertiveness of Khrushchev's de-Stalinisation policy. <b>A</b> <b>strong</b> <b>supporter</b> of democratic centralism, Suslov prevented Brezhnev from taking over Kosygin's post as head of government in 1970. Kirilenko, Brezhnev, and Suslov were members of an unofficial Troika within the Communist Party leadership.|$|E
5|$|Barkley, {{recently}} {{chosen as}} Senate Majority Leader {{by a single}} vote, was <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>supporter</b> of President Roosevelt and the New Deal. Chandler identified with the more conservative southern Democrats who, wary of Roosevelt and his New Deal, sought {{to gain control of}} the party ahead of the 1940 presidential election. Because Roosevelt was very popular in Kentucky, Chandler was put in the awkward position of expressing personal support of the president while opposing his hand-picked leader in the Senate and his New Deal legislation. In April, polls showed Barkley ahead of Chandler by a 2-to-1 margin, and the May 3 primary victory of New Deal Florida Senator Claude Pepper finally persuaded Chandler to abandon his attacks of the program.|$|E

5|$|Converting to evangelical Christianity in the 1880s, Sunday left {{baseball}} for the Christian ministry. He gradually developed his {{skills as a}} pulpit evangelist in the Midwest and then, during the early 20th century, he became the nation's most famous evangelist with his colloquial sermons and frenetic delivery. Sunday held widely reported campaigns in America's largest cities, and he attracted the largest crowds of any evangelist {{before the advent of}} electronic sound systems. He also made {{a great deal of money}} and was welcomed into the homes of the wealthy and influential. Sunday was <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>supporter</b> of Prohibition, and his preaching likely played a significant role in the adoption of the Eighteenth Amendment in 1919.|$|E
5|$|Davies {{reacted to}} his deselection by announcing {{that the people}} of Merthyr, not the local Labour Party, would decide his future. If {{physically}} fit he would contest the next election as an Independent Socialist. Friends advised him not to risk humiliation; no deselected candidate in recent times had won election against the party machine, and Davies would, they predicted, get no more than 1,000 votes. Within a few days of the deselection meeting Wilson called a snap general election, which gave the Merthyr party little time to find their new candidate. They chose Tal Lloyd, an Amalgamated Engineering Union (AEU) official, a long-serving councillor and a former mayor, on the moderate wing of the Labour Party, and <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>supporter</b> of Wilson.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 Clinton, a Senator and {{candidate}} for the Democratic Party presidential nomination, became the first American woman to win a presidential primary. Traister discusses Clinton's political campaign, which did not focus on her gender, and the misogynistic reactions she received from the media and political opponents. She argues that the Democratic Party's lack of response to the sexism of Clinton's opponents led {{a large number of}} liberal female voters to abandon the party, and blames Mark Penn for advising Clinton not to advertise herself as a feminist. Although she originally supported John Edwards' candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination, she became <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> <b>supporter</b> of Clinton.|$|E
