50|$|Due to the {{unexpected}} nature of Tina Watson's {{death and the}} implausible and conflicting statements given by Watson, the death was investigated by the State Coroner's office. A coronial inquiry was held, as is the usual practice in Australia. Gabe Watson declined to return to Australia, so did not testify during the inquest but gave evidence through his lawyers to the inquest and to the Queensland police. During the inquest, prosecutors submitted evidence that Watson's story contradicted the record of his actions stored by his dive computer. They suggested {{the possibility that he}} turned off Tina's <b>air</b> <b>regulator</b> and held her until she was unconscious, then turned the air back on and let her sink before surfacing himself. As evidence, they described the many painstaking re-enactments of various scenarios conducted by police divers. Tina's father claimed that Gabe Watson had asked Tina, shortly before their wedding, to increase her life insurance and make him the sole beneficiary.|$|E
50|$|The first microdermabrasion {{unit was}} {{developed}} in Italy in 1985, using small inert aluminium oxide crystals to abrade the skin. In 1986, other European markets had introduced the technology, which was immediately adopted by physicians for mechanical exfoliation. There were 10 microdermabrasion units {{on the market in}} Europe by the end of 1992. In 1996, Mattioli Engineering partnered with one of the Italian designed machines and started working towards meeting FDA requirements for the USA. By the end of 1996, the FDA issued the first approval letter for microdermabrasion machines. In January 1997, the first microderm machine was being sold and marketed in the US. The diamond tip was introduced in 1999 and the bristle tip brush was introduced in 2005. The first standard vacuum based microdermabrasion system called Vacubrasion was introduced in 2012 in the U.S. and world markets, and provides diamond tip exfoliation and suction. Vacubrasion's patented <b>air</b> <b>regulator</b> delivery system was designed and underwent extensive testing by U.S. dermatologists and physicians. Its straightforward design revolutionized microdermabrasion to permit use of almost any type of suction source (primarily retail brand vacuums with a 1.25 inch standard round hose such as Eureka, Stanley vacuums) with a non-disposable, attached electroplated fine diamond abrasive tip. While traditional, older crystal based microdermabrasion and home microdermabrasion systems are not infrequently fraught with clogging issues and potential loss of suction, the crystal-free Vacubrasion systems utilize a universal, larger and more powerful suction source that avoids many of these issues.|$|E

30|$|DEC fire {{managers}} face fewer {{hurdles to}} collaborations with regulators {{due to the}} fact that a separate arm within the DEC agency, the Air Quality Management Branch (AQMB), has responsibility for protecting and maintaining air quality in Western Australia. The AQMB works closely with and provides regular advice to other sections of the DEC, including fire operators and other state and local government agencies, to ensure that national air quality standards and thresholds are not exceeded. Similar to <b>air</b> <b>regulators</b> in California, they are held responsible for maintaining emissions and visibility below threshold levels for public health and safety. The key difference is that intra-agency collaboration between fire managers and air-quality regulators is the default, and is mandated by supervisors within the DEC. Despite the large amount of land burned annually by the DEC fire program, the sharing of responsibilities for smoke management policy and prescribed burn practices (by both the fire program and AQMB) have successfully led to a reduced incidence of undesirable smoke and haze within Perth city and most other major population centers in Western Australia.|$|R

A better solution, with greater legitimacy under existing European Union and United Nations agreements, is to maintain a system of national air traffic management while empowering private carriers to make cancellation decisions with input from outside agencies as requested. National sovereignty should be respected in air traffic regulation not just because of its historic relevance, but because the practical costs of the loss of sovereignty in air traffic management can be impermissibly high. In short, there should not be a tradeoff in European aviation between innovations in safety and maintaining the sovereignty of individual nations...|$|R
40|$|Subsidies are {{creating}} a toxic mix of imperfect competition and imperfect regulation working directly at cross-purposes with each other. ” John Moot, former FERC General Counsel.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) determined that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations. With the failure to adopt a national carbon dioxide cap-and-trade program, the responsibility and authority to regulate carbon dioxide falls under the rubric of the CAA. The regulations divide into those for new and existing affected fossil fuel generating plants. For new plants, the approach is relatively straightforward, and essentially reinforces the market choice to prefer new natural gas plants to new coal plants, at least at the present and expected price of natural gas.

40|$|Evidence {{shows that}} smoke from fires (wildfi re, {{controlled}} burning, and agricultural burning) is contributing signifi cantly to fine particulate matter (PM 2. 5) and haze in many {{urban and rural}} areas, affecting health, visibility, and ecosystems. In addition to the primary particulate matter directly emitted by fires, gaseous organic compounds are emitted that transform into “secondary” particulate matter downwind from fires, which contributes notably to PM 2. 5 and haze. States and tribes are required to implement programs to reduce emissions {{to meet the requirements}} of the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) National Ambient Air Quality Standards and Regional Haze Rule, and central to any meaningful implementation plan is an understanding of which sources contribute to these pollutants. <b>Air</b> quality <b>regulators</b> must be able to correctly identify the sources so that managers can implement emission reduction strategies that will assist in the attainment of air quality standards. This project has developed new methodologies and tools for use by experts to better quantify what portion of fi ne particulates comes from fire, and of that amount, to determine how much comes from wildfire, prescribed fire, and agricultural burning. This information can then be directly used by <b>air</b> quality <b>regulators</b> to develop and implement plans to reduce PM 2. 5 and haze below regulated thresholds.

40|$|Fuel {{treatments}} (prescribed {{fire and}} mechanical removal) {{on public lands}} in California are critical for reducing fuel accumulation and wildfire frequency and severity and protecting private property located in the wildland–urban interface. Treatments are especially needed in forests impacted by air pollution and subject to climate change. High ambient ozone (O 3) concentration and elevated nitrogen (N) deposition weakens and predisposes trees to bark beetle attacks, increases foliar senescence and fuel build-up, and increases water stress during drought periods. Climate variability {{is expected to increase}} beyond historic ranges of variation, resulting in more severe droughts. Combinations of future climate variability and air pollution are likely to increase risk of episodic tree mortality, long-term ecosystem changes, and frequency and severity of wildland fires. Fuel treatments, however, are difficult to implement in these forests. Smoke from prescribed fires can adversely affect local and regional air quality leading to conflicts with local and regional air regulatory agencies. Over the past several years federal land air quality and fire managers have responded to these conflicting needs by expanding beyond the boundaries of their historical job responsibilities. For example, they are now actively forging cooperative relationships with local, state, and federal <b>air</b> <b>regulators.</b> The result has been fewer conflicts about smoke in populated or protected areas, with managers achieving an adequate level of prescribed fire treatments.
