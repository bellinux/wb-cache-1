25|$|The use of <b>adult</b> <b>stem</b> {{cells in}} {{research}} and therapy is not as controversial {{as the use of}} embryonic stem cells, because the production of <b>adult</b> <b>stem</b> cells does not require the destruction of an embryo. Additionally, in instances where <b>adult</b> <b>stem</b> cells are obtained from the intended recipient (an autograft), the risk of rejection is essentially non-existent. Consequently, more US government funding is being provided for <b>adult</b> <b>stem</b> cell research.|$|E

40|$|The {{functional}} {{significance of}} <b>adult</b> neural <b>stem</b> and progenitor cells in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory {{has been well}} documented. Although <b>adult</b> neural <b>stem</b> and progenitor cells in the subventricular zone are known to migrate to, maintain and reorganize the olfactory bulb, it is less clear whether they are functionally required for other processes. Using a conditional transgenic mouse model, selective ablation of <b>adult</b> neural <b>stem</b> and progenitor cells in the subventricular zone induced {{a dramatic increase in}} morbidity and mortality of central nervous system disorders characterized by excitotoxicity-induced cell death accompanied by reactive inflammation, such as 4 -aminopyridine-induced epilepsy and ischaemic stroke. To test the role of subventricular zone <b>adult</b> neural <b>stem</b> and progenitor cells in protecting central nervous system tissue from glutamatergic excitotoxicity, neurophysiological recordings of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents from single medium spiny striatal neurons were measured on acute brain slices. Indeed, lipopolysaccharide-stimulated, but not unstimulated, subventricular zone <b>adult</b> neural <b>stem</b> and progenitor cells reverted the increased frequency and duration of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents by secreting the endocannabinod arachidonoyl ethanolamide, a molecule that regulates glutamatergic tone through type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB(1)) binding. In vivo restoration of cannabinoid levels, either by administration of the type 1 cannabinoid receptor agonist HU 210 or the inhibitor of the principal catabolic enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase, URB 597, completely reverted the increased morbidity and mortality of <b>adult</b> neural <b>stem</b> and progenitor cell-ablated mice suffering from epilepsy and ischaemic stroke. Our results provide the first evidence that <b>adult</b> neural <b>stem</b> and progenitor cells located within the subventricular zone exert an 'innate' homeostatic regulatory role by protecting striatal neurons from glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity...|$|R

These cultured stem cells were, later, used to produce corneal epithelia that can be stitched on to human eye.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveIt {{is thought}} that <b>adult</b> human mesenchymal <b>stem</b> cells do not induce immunoreactivity even to xenografts. We wanted to study whether <b>adult</b> human mesenchymal <b>stem</b> cells survive and engraft in {{experimentally}} induced ischemic rat myocardium. MethodsBone marrow–derived <b>adult</b> human mesenchymal <b>stem</b> cells (2. 5 × 106) were injected into the myocardium of 4 Sprague-Dawley rats. One week after injection, peripheral blood rat lymphocytes were added to <b>adult</b> human mesenchymal <b>stem</b> cells in a mixed lymphocyte reaction. Furthermore, an infarction was created by left anterior descending artery ligation of 8 Sprague-Dawley rats, 4 of which were immunosuppressed with tacrolimus (0. 1 mg/kg/d) and 4 RNU athymic rats. One week after left anterior descending artery ligation, 2. 5 to 3. 5 × 106 <b>adult</b> human mesenchymal <b>stem</b> cells were injected around the infarcted area. The <b>adult</b> human mesenchymal <b>stem</b> cells were identified with {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} technique and myocardial antigens by immunohistochemistry. The immune response was studied by hematoxylin and eosin staining and by antibodies directed toward macrophages. ResultsSignificant rat lymphocyte proliferation was observed when <b>adult</b> human mesenchymal <b>stem</b> cells were added to peripheral blood from Sprague-Dawley rats previously exposed to <b>adult</b> human mesenchymal <b>stem</b> cells. No reactivity was seen in lymphocytes from untreated Sprague-Dawley rats and athymic rats. <b>Adult</b> human mesenchymal <b>stem</b> cells could only be identified in the myocardium of athymic rats. Further, in normal Sprague-Dawley rats, there was a significant myocardial infiltration of round cells, mostly macrophages, in the area of injection of <b>adult</b> human mesenchymal <b>stem</b> cells. In RNU rats, this reaction was less intense. ConclusionAdult human mesenchymal stem cells did not induce xenoreactivity in vitro in previously unexposed immunocompetent Sprague-Dawley rats. However, although mesenchymal stem cells are transplantable across allogeneic barriers, transplant rejection can occur in a xenogenic model. When transplanted into an immunoincompetent host, <b>adult</b> human mesenchymal <b>stem</b> cells showed persistent engraftment...|$|R

25|$|<b>Adult</b> <b>stem</b> {{cells are}} not able to proliferate and {{differentiate}} as effectively in vitro as they are able to in vivo. <b>Adult</b> <b>stem</b> cells can come from many different tissue locations, {{but it is difficult to}} isolate them because they are defined by behavior and not surface markers. A method has yet to be developed for clearly distinguishing between stem cells and the differentiated cells surrounding them. However, surface markers can still be used to a certain extent to remove most of the unwanted differentiated cells. Stem cell plasticity is the ability to differentiate across embryonic germ line boundaries. Though, the presence of plasticity has been hotly contested. Some claim that plasticity is caused by heterogeneity among the cells or cell fusion events. Currently, cells can be differentiated across cell lines with yields ranging from 10% to 90% depending on techniques used. More studies need to be done in order to standardize the yield with transdifferentiation. Transdifferentiation of multipotent stem cells is a potential means for obtaining stem cells that are not available or not easily obtained in the adult.|$|E

25|$|Another theory {{associates}} <b>adult</b> <b>stem</b> cells (ASC) with tumor formation. This is {{most often}} associated with tissues with {{a high rate of}} cell turnover (such as the skin or gut). In these tissues, ASCs are candidates because of their frequent cell divisions (compared to most ASCs) in conjunction with the long lifespan of ASCs. This combination creates the ideal set of circumstances for mutations to accumulate: mutation accumulation is the primary factor that drives cancer initiation. Evidence shows that the association represents an actual phenomenon, although specific cancers have been linked to a specific cause.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe adult {{mammalian}} {{central nervous}} system contains resident neural stem cells able to self-renew and to generate new neurons throughout life, {{as well as other}} neural cell types. Progressive changes in <b>adult</b> neural <b>stem</b> cells accompany the aging process, which may contribute to a progressive decline in regenerative capacities, tissue degeneration, and functional impairments. For example, accelerated and pathological declines in neural stem cell functions have been associated with age-related brain diseases. Therefore, identifying and better understanding the age-associated molecular events involved in the deterioration of <b>adult</b> neural <b>stem</b> cell homeostasis is of high interest. To date, several intrinsic and extrinsic factors have been identified as putative drivers for age-related dysfunctions in brain stem cell niches.

40|$|The {{recruitment}} of endogenous <b>adult</b> neural <b>stem</b> cells for brain repair is a promising regenerative therapeutic strategy.

Currently, {{there is a}} lack of a single therapeutic approach that can act on these multiple stages of <b>adult</b> neural <b>stem</b> cell development to enhance neural regeneration. Here we show that metformin, an FDA-approved diabetes drug, promotes proliferation, self-renewal, and differentiation of adult neural precursors (NPCs). Specifically, we show that metformin enhances adult NPC proliferation and self-renewal dependent upon the p 53 family member and transcription factor TAp 73, while it promotes neuronal differentiation of these cells by activating the AMPK-aPKC-CBP pathway. Thus, metformin represents an optimal candidate neuro-regenerative agent that is capable of not only expanding the adult NPC population but also subsequently driving them toward neuronal differentiation by activating two distinct molecular pathways...|$|R

40|$|In the {{mammalian}} brain, neurogenesis continues only in few {{regions of}} the forebrain. The molecular signals governing neurogenesis in these unique neurogenic niches, however, are still ill defined. Here, we show that bone morphogenic protein (BMP) -mediated signaling is active in <b>adult</b> neural <b>stem</b> cells and is crucial to initiate the neurogenic lineage in the adult mouse subependymal zone. Conditional deletion of Smad 4 in <b>adult</b> neural <b>stem</b> cells severely impairs neurogenesis, and this is phenocopied by infusion of Noggin, an extracellular antagonist of BMP. Smad 4 deletion in stem, but not progenitor cells, as well as Noggin infusion lead to an increased number of Olig 2 -expressing progeny that migrate to the corpus callosum and differentiate into oligodendrocytes. Transplantation experiments further verified the cell-autonomous nature of this phenotype. Thus, BMP-mediated signaling via Smad 4 is required to initiate neurogenesis from <b>adult</b> neural <b>stem</b> cells and suppress the alternative fate of oligodendrogliogenesis...|$|R
