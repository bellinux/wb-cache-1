5|$|The main {{muscular system}} in {{bivalves}} is the posterior and anterior <b>adductor</b> muscles, although the anterior muscles {{may be reduced}} or even lost in some species. These strong muscles connect the two valves and contract to close the shell. They work {{in opposition to the}} ligament which tends to pull the valves apart. In sedentary or recumbent bivalves that lie on one valve, such as the oysters and scallops, the anterior <b>adductor</b> muscle has been lost and the posterior muscle is positioned centrally. In file shells that can swim by flapping their valves, a single, central <b>adductor</b> muscle occurs. These muscles are composed of two types of muscle fibres, striated muscle bundles for fast actions and smooth muscle bundles for maintaining a steady pull.|$|E
5|$|In his 1935 work Handbuch der systematischen Weichtierkunde (Handbook of Systematic Malacology), Johannes Thiele {{introduced}} a mollusc taxonomy {{based upon the}} 1909 work by Cossmann and Peyrot. Thiele's system divided the bivalves into three orders. Taxodonta consisted of forms that had taxodont dentition, {{with a series of}} small parallel teeth perpendicular to the hinge line. Anisomyaria consisted of forms that had either a single <b>adductor</b> muscle or one <b>adductor</b> muscle much smaller than the other. Eulamellibranchiata consisted of forms with ctenidial gills. The Eulamellibranchiata was further divided into four suborders: Schizodonta, Heterodonta, Adapedonta and Anomalodesmata.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{pelvic floor}} muscle (PFM) {{training}} {{is the most}} common treatment for urinary incontinence (UI), however many women performed the contraction of PFM with associated contraction of abdominal, gluteus and hip <b>adductors</b> muscles. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of pelvic floor muscle (PFM) training on isometric and isokinetic hip <b>adductors</b> peak torque (PT) among women suffering from urinary incontinence (UI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: It is a longitudinal and prospective exploratory study. This study included 15 physically active women aged 45 years old and over, who presented complaints of UI. The PFM function (digital evaluation and perineometry), isometric and isokinetic hip <b>adductors</b> PT and one hour pad test were performed before and after treatment. The PFM training was performed in group, one hour once a week for 12 sessions. RESULTS: Significant improvement of PFM function and pressure level (p = 0. 003), and significant decrease of hip <b>adductors</b> isometric PT and one-hour pad test, were found post-treatment. Moderate negative correlations between PFM contraction pressure and hip <b>adductors</b> isokinetic PT for dominant side (DS) (r = - 0. 62; p = 0. 03) and non-dominant side (NDS) (r = - 0. 64; p = 0. 02); and between PFM fast fibers contraction and hip <b>adductors</b> isometric PT for DS (r = - 0. 60; p = 0. 03) and NDS (r = - 0. 59; p = 0. 04) were also found.

5|$|Most {{bivalves}} adopt a sedentary or even sessile lifestyle, often {{spending their}} whole lives {{in the area in}} which they first settled as juveniles. The majority of bivalves are infaunal, living under the seabed, buried in soft substrates such as sand, silt, mud, gravel, or coral fragments. Many of these live in the intertidal zone where the sediment remains damp even when the tide is out. When buried in the sediment, burrowing bivalves are protected from the pounding of waves, desiccation, and overheating during low tide, and variations in salinity caused by rainwater. They are also {{out of the reach of}} many predators. Their general strategy is to extend their siphons to the surface for feeding and respiration during high tide, but to descend to greater depths or keep their shell tightly shut when the tide goes out. They use their muscular foot to dig into the substrate. To do this, the animal relaxes its <b>adductor</b> muscles and opens its shell wide to anchor itself in position while it extends its foot downwards into the substrate. Then it dilates the tip of its foot, retracts the <b>adductor</b> muscles to close the shell, shortens its foot and draws itself downwards. This series of actions is repeated to dig deeper.|$|E
5|$|Hašek played {{increasingly}} {{well for}} the Senators up until the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. During the season, he reached 300 career wins, and his GAA and save percentage were the second-best in the league. Upon departure to Turin, Hašek's equipment was accidentally left behind in Ottawa. This caused Hašek to miss a number of practices with the Czech National team. At the Winter Olympics, he injured his right <b>adductor</b> muscle while making a save in the first qualifying match against Germany, forcing {{him to leave the}} game after only 9 minutes and 25 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The {{processes}} of feeding and capture may be aided by special parts; Pisaster brevispinus, the short-spined pisaster from the West Coast of America, {{can use a}} set of specialized tube feet to dig itself deep into the soft substrate to extract prey (usually clams). Grasping the shellfish, the starfish slowly pries open the prey's shell by wearing out its <b>adductor</b> muscle, and then inserts its everted stomach into the crack to digest the soft tissues. The gap between the valves need only be {{a fraction of a}} millimetre wide for the stomach to gain entry.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the regular}} season success, the team entered the playoffs under a cloud. In February, Hasek had {{suffered}} an <b>adductor</b> muscle injury while playing for the Czech Republic men's national ice hockey team during the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. He had played only one game for the Czechs and returned to Ottawa to heal, but would never play for the Senators again. Rookie goaltender Ray Emery had {{to take over the}} starting goaltender duties, leading the media to predict an early playoff exit due to Hasek's absence. Hopes were raised in the first round, however, when Emery would become the first rookie goaltender since Philadelphia's Brian Boucher in 2000 to win a playoff series when the Senators defeated the Tampa Bay Lightning four games to one. However, the Senators then lost to the Buffalo Sabres in the second round, a series in which all games were decided by one goal.|$|E
5|$|Distinguishing {{features}} of the teleosts are mobile premaxilla, elongated neural arches {{at the end of}} the caudal fin and unpaired basibranchial toothplates. The premaxilla is unattached to the neurocranium (braincase); it plays a role in protruding the mouth and creating a circular opening. This lowers the pressure inside the mouth, sucking the prey inside. The lower jaw and maxilla are then pulled back to close the mouth, and the fish is able to grasp the prey. By contrast, mere closure of the jaws would risk pushing food out of the mouth. In more advanced teleosts, the premaxilla is enlarged and has teeth, while the maxilla is toothless. The maxilla functions to push both the premaxilla and the lower jaw forward. To open the mouth, an <b>adductor</b> muscle pulls back the top of the maxilla, pushing the lower jaw forward. In addition, the maxilla rotates slightly, which pushes forward a bony process that interlocks with the premaxilla.|$|E
5|$|Samuelsson {{struggled}} in the 2011 playoffs, {{as he returned}} from a lower-body injury that kept him from the six games {{near the end of}} the regular season. Recording three points over 11 games against the Blackhawks and Nashville Predators in the first two rounds, he was demoted at one point to the Canucks' fourth line in the second round against Nashville; it was suspected he was playing through an injury. In Game 5 of the second round against Nashville, he fell to the ice while stretching to retrieve a loose puck and needed to be helped off the ice. Twelve days later, on May 19, he underwent surgery for his <b>adductor</b> tendon and a sports hernia, sidelining him for the remainder of the playoffs. With Samuelsson out of the lineup, Vancouver advanced to the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals, where they were defeated in seven games by the Boston Bruins.|$|E

40|$|Abstract &nbsp; Background and Aim: Spasticity {{is one of}} the {{symptoms}} that contributes to functional limitation in adults with cerebral palsy and characterized by a velocity dependent increase in tonic reflex due to the hyperexcitability of the stretch reflex. Modified Tardieu Scale (MTS) is a valid clinical tool for assessment of spasticity. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate Inter-rater reliability of the Modified Tardieu Scale (MTS) for hip <b>adductors,</b> knee extensors and ankle plantar flexors muscles in adult subjects with cerebral palsy. &nbsp; Materials and Methods: In an analytical cross sectional study, 30 participants (11 men ، 21 women, age range 20 to 40 years, mean age (26. 57 &plusmn; 4. 8) with spastic cerebral palsy from Ra'ad Rehabilitation Goodwill Complexes in Tehran city in a convenient sampling took part in this study. Spasticity was measured by two physiotherapist for hip <b>adductors,</b> knee extensors and ankle plantar flexors with MTS during same session with ten minutes interval between assessment of two raters. &nbsp; Results: ICC values for R 2 -R 1 as an indicator of spasticity in hip <b>adductors,</b> knee extensor and plantar flexors were 0. 97, 0. 88 and 0. 81 respectively.

5000|$|The psoas is {{the primary}} hip flexor, {{assisted}} by the iliacus. The pectineus, the <b>adductors</b> longus, brevis, and magnus, {{as well as the}} tensor fasciae latae are also involved in flexion.|$|R
5|$|The <b>adductor</b> muscle of the jaw {{appears to}} have {{attached}} to the quadrate instead of the supratemporal fenestra. Both this and the other mastication muscles were likely weak, and Nigersaurus is estimated to have {{had one of the}} weakest bites of the sauropods. In addition, the small, nearly parallel nature of the tooth scratches and pits (caused by grit, which would not be obtained as often by high-browsers) indicate that it ate relatively soft, herbaceous plants such as low-growing ferns. Because of the lateral orientation of the teeth, it probably {{would not have been able}} to chew. Nigersaurus wore its tooth crowns down faster than other dinosaurian herbivores, and its tooth replacement rate was the highest of any known dinosaur. Each tooth was replaced once every 14 days; the rate had previously been estimated lower. In contrast to Nigersaurus, sauropods with lower tooth replacement rates and broader tooth crowns are thought to have been canopy browsers.|$|E
5|$|The first fishes lacked {{jaws and}} used {{negative}} pressure to suck their food in through their mouths. The jaw in the bowfin {{is a result}} of their evolutionary {{need to be able to}} catch and eat bigger and more nutritious prey. As a result of being able to gather more nutrients, Bowfin are able to live a more active lifestyle. The jaw of a bowfin has several contributions. The maxilla and premaxilla are fused and the posterior chondrocranium articulates with the vertebra which allows the jaw freedom to rotate. The suspensorium includes several bones and articulates with the snout, brain case, and the mandible. When the jaw opens epaxial muscles lift the chondrocranium which is attached to the upper jaw, and <b>adductor</b> muscles close the lower jaw. This ability to open and close the jaw allows the bowfin to become more of a predator, in that it can catch bigger prey and be able to mechanical catch, and digest it.|$|E
5|$|The {{sedentary}} {{habits of}} the bivalves have meant that in general the nervous system is less complex than in most other molluscs. The animals have no brain; the nervous system consists of a nerve network {{and a series of}} paired ganglia. In all but the most primitive bivalves, two cerebropleural ganglia are {{on either side of the}} oesophagus. The cerebral ganglia control the sensory organs, while the pleural ganglia supply nerves to the mantle cavity. The pedal ganglia, which control the foot, are at its base, and the visceral ganglia, which can be quite large in swimming bivalves, are under the posterior <b>adductor</b> muscle. These ganglia are both connected to the cerebropleural ganglia by nerve fibres. Bivalves with long siphons may also have siphonal ganglia to control them.|$|E
2500|$|The {{muscles of}} the thigh can be {{classified}} into three groups according to their location: anterior and posterior muscles and the <b>adductors</b> (on the medial side). All the <b>adductors</b> except gracilis insert on the femur and act on the hip joint, and so functionally qualify as hip muscles. The majority of the thigh muscles, the [...] "true" [...] thigh muscles, insert on the leg (either the tibia or the fibula) and act primarily on the knee joint. Generally, the extensors lie on anterior of the thigh and flexors lie on the posterior. Even though the sartorius flexes the knee, it is ontogenetically considered an extensor since its displacement is secondary.|$|R
50|$|Fick divided {{these three}} groups of fibers, often {{referred}} to as parts (Latin: pars) or bands, into seven functional components: the anterior part has two components (I and II); the lateral one (III); and the posterior four (IV, V, VI, and VII) components. In standard anatomical position (with the upper limb hanging alongside the body), the central components (II, III, and IV) lie lateral to the axis of abduction and therefore contribute to abduction {{from the start of the}} movement while the other components (I, V, VI, and VII) then act as <b>adductors.</b> During abduction most of these latter components (except VI and VII which always act as <b>adductors)</b> are displaced laterally and progressively start to abduct.|$|R
40|$|Insertional {{tendinopathy}} of the <b>adductors</b> and rectus abdominis {{is common}} in male athletes, especially in soccer players. It may be worsened by physical activity and it usually limits sport performance. The manage- ment goal in the acute phase consists of analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs and physical rehabilitation. In {{the early stages of}} rehabilitation, strengthening exer- cises of <b>adductors</b> and abdominal muscles, such as postural exercises, have been suggested. In the sub- acute phase, muscular strength is targeted by overload training in the gym or aquatherapy; core stability exer- cises seem to be useful in this phase. Finally, specific sport actions are introduced by increasingly complex exercises along with a preventive program to limit pain recurrences...|$|R
5|$|The {{sensory organs}} of {{bivalves}} {{are not well}} developed and are largely located on the posterior mantle margins. The organs are usually mechanoreceptors or chemoreceptors, in some cases located on short tentacles. The chemoreceptor cells taste the water and are sensitive to touch. They are typically found near the siphons, but in some species, they fringe the entire mantle cavity. The osphradium is a patch of sensory cells located below the posterior <b>adductor</b> muscle that may serve to taste the water or measure its turbidity, but is probably not homologous with {{the structure of the}} same name found in snails and slugs. Statocysts within the organism help the bivalve to sense and correct its orientation. Each statocyst consists of a small sac lined with sensory cilia that detect the movement of a mineral mass, a statolith, under gravity. In the order Anomalodesmata, the inhalant siphon is surrounded by vibration-sensitive tentacles for detecting prey.|$|E
5|$|The two valves of the bivalve shell {{are held}} {{together}} at the hinge by a ligament composed of two keratinised proteins, tensilium and resilium. In different groups of bivalves, the ligament may be internal or external in position. The main function of the ligament (as well as joining the valves together) is to passively cause the shell to open. The shell is actively closed using the <b>adductor</b> muscle or muscles which {{are attached to the}} inner surface of both valves. The position of the muscles is often clearly visible on the inside of empty valves as circular or oval muscle scars. Along the hinge line of the shell are, in most cases, a number of hinge teeth which prevent the valves from moving laterally relative to one another. The arrangement of these teeth is often important in identifying bivalves.|$|E
5|$|A month {{into the}} 2008–09 season, Luongo began a shutout streak that lasted three {{games against the}} Nashville Predators, Phoenix Coyotes, and the Minnesota Wild, akin to the feat he {{accomplished}} in the same month of November the previous year. His overall shutout streak was snapped at 242:36 minutes, in a 2–1 shootout loss against the Colorado Avalanche, surpassing the Canucks record he set the previous season. Later that month, on November 22, Luongo left a game versus the Pittsburgh Penguins after suffering an <b>adductor</b> strain in his groin. Initially listed as week-to-week, he attempted what was considered an early comeback within {{two weeks of the}} injury, but suffered a setback during a team practice on December 10, leaving early in discomfort. After missing 24 games, Luongo made his return on January 15, 2009, in a 4–1 loss to the Phoenix Coyotes. While injured, Luongo was chosen for the fourth time to the NHL All-Star Game in 2009 as the lone Canucks representative. Despite speculation he would have to miss his second straight All-Star Game, Luongo recovered in time and took part in a 12–11 shootout loss to the Eastern Conference. He finished the season with back-to-back shutouts in the final two games against the Los Angeles Kings and Colorado Avalanche to establish a new career-high of nine shutouts on the season, breaking Dan Cloutier's previous franchise single-season shutout record of seven, set in 2001–02.|$|E

5|$|The spiny scallop anchors {{itself to}} the {{substrate}} with a few byssus threads. It is unclear what {{the purpose of these}} is but they may serve to help orient the scallop with regard to the current for optimal feeding. Another possibility is that they may angle the scallop ready for a quick getaway. They are easily broken when the scallop starts to swim. It is a filter feeder. It exposes its mantle by separating its valves and passes water through its gills by ciliary action. A large scallop can process about 4 litres of water an hour per gram of its weight. Phytoplankton are sieved from the water by the gills and moved to the mouth in ciliated grooves. Here they are sorted by a pair of labial palps (mouth appendages), before being ingested. Rejected particles are formed into mucous-wrapped blobs. These are ejected from the mantle cavity at intervals along with the faeces by a rapid clapping of the valves. When the gonads are ripening, a raised level of microalgae in the diet has been found to increase gonadal development. At this time, glycogen storage in the main <b>adductor</b> muscle is depleted as energy is transferred from there to the gonads.|$|E

It was also the third fastest hat trick scored in the league's history at 9 minutes. Following the match, he received the player of the week award {{for the third time in}} the 2015 MLS season. After scoring and assisting in a 2–1 home win over Philadelphia Union on 18 July 2015, Giovinco was one of the 22 players to be named to the 2015 MLS All-Star Game roster, although he was later ruled out of the match due to injury, and replaced by his teammate Altidore. On 5 August 2015, Giovinco scored a hat-trick in a 4–1 home win over Orlando City to bring him to the top of the MLS scoring tables with 16 goals, also breaking the club's single-season record of 15 goals set in 2010 by Dwayne De Rosario in the process. On 6 August 2015, he was named the Etihad Airways MLS Player of the Month for July 2015. On 14 August 2015, Giovinco's free kick goal against Orlando City was awarded the MLS Goal of the Week Award. On 29 August 2015, he was substituted in the 51st minute in a 2–1 win over Montreal Impact due to an <b>adductor</b> strain; although it was reported that the injury was not serious, he was ruled out indefinitely.
