5|$|In 1860 Berkeley and Curtis {{described}} the species Agaricus cyanophos from material also {{collected from the}} Bonin Islands. This material was found near the location that the original specimens of M.chlorophos were found, but <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>later.</b> Japanese mycologists Seiya Ito and Sanshi Imai studied these collections in the late 1930s, and concluded that Agaricus cyanophos was the same species as M.chlorophos, despite differences in cap shape, gill attachment, {{and the color of}} emitted light. Desjardin and colleagues agreed with this determination after examining the type material of both taxa. M.chlorophos is classified in the section Exornatae of the genus Mycena. Other luminescent species in this section are M.discobasis and M.marginata. Some authors have considered M.illuminans to be synonymous with M.chlorophos due to their morphological similarity, but molecular analysis has shown that they are distinct species.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>later</b> in late June in the Wimbledon singles {{he again}} {{suffered}} a surprise loss to Ian Collins {{in the second}} round. In the mixed event Cochet and Whittingstall lost in semifinal stage, this time to Enrique Maier and Elizabeth Ryan. The singles competition was won by Ellsworth Vines, his first non-American title. The American Davis Cup team traveled back to France to challenge the reigning holder at the Stade Roland Garros. The French Musketeers secured the cup for the sixth and final time after four rubbers, losing only the doubles match. Cochet and Vines met in the dead fifth rubber. The face-off between the two {{was one of the}} few encounters that later had a decisive effect on the rankings. Vines ameliorated his team's result by defeating Cochet in five sets. The two European major champions then met in the final of the U.S. National Championships final in September. Vines kept the national title home with his second win, a straight sets 6–4 victory over Cochet. Vines and Keith Gledhill subsequently beat Cochet and Marcel Bernard in the doubles final. Cochet and Virginia Rice were dropped out in the mixed semifinal while Vines reached the finals. These losses sealed the fate of the year-end rankings.|$|E
