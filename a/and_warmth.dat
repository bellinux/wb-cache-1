The former Liberal MP Frank Owen confided to Bessell his suspicions that Thorpe was a homosexual; other West Country Liberals had formed the same opinion. Aware that exposure as a homosexual would end Thorpe's career, Bessell became his self-appointed protector, even to the extent, he later said, of falsely claiming to be bisexual, {{as a means of}} acquiring his friend's confidence.|$|E
5|$|Weisman uses New York City as a {{model to}} outline how an unmaintained urban area would deconstruct. He {{explains}} that sewers would clog, underground streams would flood subway corridors, and soils under roads would erode and cave in. From interviews {{with members of the}} Wildlife Conservation Society and the New York Botanical Gardens Weisman predicts that native vegetation would return, spreading from parks and out-surviving invasive species. Without humans to provide food <b>and</b> <b>warmth,</b> rats and cockroaches would die off.|$|E

5|$|In 1844, Isabella fell ill. She recovered, but {{the illness}} recurred the {{following}} year, {{and she became}} an invalid. John Macdonald took his wife to Savannah, Georgia, in the United States in 1845, hoping that the sea air <b>and</b> <b>warmth</b> would cure her ailments. Although John Macdonald was {{able to return to}} Canada after six months, Isabella remained in the United States for three years. He visited her again in New York at the end of 1846, and returned several months later when she informed him she was pregnant. In August 1847 their son John Alexander Macdonald Jr. was born in New York, but as Isabella remained ill, relatives cared for the infant.|$|E
5|$|Populations are dense in {{the higher}} {{mountain}} regions of Tasmania. Widespread throughout the state, their presence is known on King Island, located north-west from Tasmania. The ant prefers rural areas, found in warm, dry, open eucalypt woodlands; the climate provides the ant with isolation <b>and</b> <b>warmth.</b> This environment also produces the ant's food, which includes nectar and invertebrate prey. In suburban areas, this ant is found in native vegetation, and use rockeries, cracks in concrete walls, dry dirt and grass to build nests. One study found suburbs with voluminous vegetation cover such as Mount Nelson, Fern Tree and West Hobart host jack jumper populations, while the heavily urbanised suburbs of North Hobart and Battery Point, do not.|$|E

40|$|This 1 -year {{longitudinal}} {{study investigated the}} effects of adolescents' depressed mood on perceived parental <b>and</b> peer <b>warmth</b> during the transition to young adulthood. We hypothesized that ethnicity would moderate such effects. As {{part of a larger}} study, 511 adolescents (154 European, 205 Hispanic, and 152 Asian Americans) participated in this research. They were surveyed shortly before their high school graduation and again 1 year later. Analyses based on 2 -wave cross-lagged models showed that higher levels of initial depressive symptoms predicted lower levels of subsequent perceived parental <b>and</b> peer <b>warmth</b> for European Americans. For Asian Americans, higher initial depressed mood was significantly associated with lower levels of perceived peer <b>warmth</b> <b>and</b> was marginally associated with lower levels of parental warmth. In contrast, the erosion of parental <b>and</b> peer <b>warmth</b> was not evident for Hispanic Americans. The role of culture in the erosion of parental <b>and</b> peer <b>warmth</b> during life transitions was discussed. © 2009, Society for Research on Adolescence...|$|R

40|$|Two traits – <b>warmth</b> <b>and</b> {{competence}} – govern social {{judgments of}} individuals and groups, and these judgments shape people‘s emotions and behaviors. The present chapter describes the causes <b>and</b> consequences of <b>warmth</b> <b>and</b> competence judgments; how, when and why they determine significant professional and organizational outcomes, such as hiring, employee evaluation, and allocation of tasks <b>and</b> resources. <b>Warmth</b> <b>and</b> competence represent the central dimensions of group stereotypes, the majority of which are ambivalent – characterizing groups as warm but incompetent (e. g., older people, working mothers) or competent but cold (e. g., ―model minorities, ‖ female leaders), in turn eliciting ambivalent feelings (i. e., pity and envy, respectively) and actions toward members of those groups. However, through nonverbal behaviors that subtly communicate <b>warmth</b> <b>and</b> competence information, people can manage the impressions they make on colleagues, potential employers, and possible investors. Finally, we discuss important directions for future research, such as investigating the causes an...|$|R

50|$|By contrast, a newer {{model of}} {{stereotype}} content theorizes that stereotypes are frequently ambivalent and vary along two dimensions: <b>warmth</b> <b>and</b> competence. <b>Warmth</b> <b>and</b> competence are respectively predicted {{by lack of}} competition and status. Groups that do not compete with the in-group for the same resources (e.g., college space) are perceived as warm, whereas high-status (e.g., economically or educationally successful) groups are considered competent. The groups {{within each of the}} four combinations of high and low levels of <b>warmth</b> <b>and</b> competence elicit distinct emotions. The model explains the phenomenon that some out-groups are admired but disliked, whereas others are liked but disrespected. This model was empirically tested on a variety of national and international samples and was found to reliably predict stereotype content.|$|R
