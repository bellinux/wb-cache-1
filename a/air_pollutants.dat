Fine particulates (PM2.5) and sulfate aerosols, which may be released in traffic exhaust fumes, are associated with slightly increased risk. For nitrogen dioxide, an incremental increase of 10 parts per billion increases the risk of lung cancer by 14%. Outdoor air pollution is estimated to account for 1–2% of lung cancers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a novel Neural Network application {{in order to}} estimate <b>Air</b> <b>Pollutant</b> Levels. The application considers both Pollutant concentrations and Meteorological variables. In order to com-pute the <b>Air</b> <b>Pollutant</b> Level the method considers three important stages. In first stage, A process to validate data information and built a threedimensional Information Feature Vector with Pollutant concentra-tions and both wind speed and wind direction meteorological variables is developed. The information Feature Vector is orderly like a time se-ries to estimate the <b>Air</b> <b>Pollutant</b> Level. In second stage, considering the behavior space knowledge a priori about pollutant and meteorological variables distribution a threedimensional Representative Vector is built in order to reduces the computational cost in Neural Network training process. In last stage, a Neural Network is designed and trained with the Threedimensional Representative Vector, then using the Threedimen-sional Information Feature Vector the <b>Air</b> <b>Pollutant</b> Level is estimated. This paper considers a real time series from an Automatic Environmental Monitoring Network from Salamanca, Guanajuato, Mexico, and there-fore in this proposal a real <b>Air</b> <b>Pollutant</b> Level is also estimated...|$|R

These dangerous pollutants are known as the criteria pollutants, and include ozone, particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and lead.|$|E

40|$|A rapid {{industrial}} development causes several environment pollution problems. One {{of the main}} problems is air pollution, which affects {{human health and the}} environment. The consideration of an <b>air</b> <b>pollutant</b> has to focus on a polluted source. An industrial factory is an important reason that releases the <b>air</b> <b>pollutant</b> into the atmosphere. Thus a mathematical model, an atmospheric diffusion model, is used to estimate air quality {{that can be used to}} describe the sulfur dioxide dispersion. In this research, numerical simulations to air pollution measurement near industrial zone are proposed. The air pollution control strategies are simulated to achieve desired pollutant concentration levels. The monitoring points are installed to detect the air pollution concentration data. The numerical experiment of air pollution consisted of different situations such as normal and controlled emissions. The <b>air</b> <b>pollutant</b> concentration is approximated by using an explicit finite difference technique. The solutions of calculated <b>air</b> <b>pollutant</b> concentration in each controlled and uncontrolled point source at the monitoring points are compared. The <b>air</b> <b>pollutant</b> concentration levels for each monitoring point are controlled to be at or below the national air quality standard near industrial zone index...|$|R
25|$|Drilling has {{increased}} {{two out of}} six “criteria” pollutants (particulate matter and ozone) that the EPA regulates due to their negative impacts. People who {{come in contact with}} these <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> can have severe health problems such as respiratory issues, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. A study has found that people within half a mile from a gas well site {{were more likely to have}} health problems from air pollution than people living farther.|$|E
25|$|Nitrogen oxides (NOx) - Nitrogen oxides, {{particularly}} nitrogen dioxide, {{are expelled}} from high temperature combustion, {{and are also}} produced during thunderstorms by electric discharge. They {{can be seen as}} a brown haze dome above or a plume downwind of cities. Nitrogen dioxide is a chemical compound with the formula NO2. It is one of several nitrogen oxides. One of the most prominent <b>air</b> <b>pollutants,</b> this reddish-brown toxic gas has a characteristic sharp, biting odor.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, {{the levels}} of other <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> and non-CO2 {{greenhouse}} gas emissions from combustion depend on the precise technology applied when fuel is combusted. These emissions are basically caused by either incomplete combustion of {{a small fraction of}} the fuel (carbon monoxide, methane, non-methane volatile organic compounds) or by complicated chemical and physical processes during the combustion and in the smoke stack or tailpipe. Examples of these are particulates, NOx, a mixture of nitric oxide, NO, and nitrogen dioxide, NO2).|$|E

25|$|Burning surface oil {{can also}} be a source for {{pollution}} such as soot particles. During the cleanup and recovery process, it will also generate <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> such as nitric oxides and ozone from ships. Lastly, bubble bursting {{can also be}} a generation pathway for particulate matter during an oil spill. During the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, significant air quality issues were found on the Gulf Coast, which is the downwind of DWH oil spill. Air quality monitoring data showed that criteria pollutants had exceeded the health-based standard in the coastal regions.|$|E
25|$|Utrecht is well-connected to the Dutch road network. Two of {{the most}} {{important}} major roads serve the city of Utrecht: the A12 and A2 motorways connect Amsterdam, Arnhem, The Hague and Maastricht, as well as Belgium and Germany. Other major motorways in the area are the Almere–Breda A27 and the Utrecht–Groningen A28. Due to the increasing traffic and the ancient city plan, traffic congestion is a common phenomenon in and around Utrecht, causing elevated levels of <b>air</b> <b>pollutants.</b> This has led to a passionate debate in the city about the best way to improve the city's air quality.|$|E

During the last 30 years of its operational life, the Tracy thermal {{generating station}} was faced with increasingly more stringent environmental rules. The Canada-US Agreements on acid rain, new regulations lowering the sulfur content of fuel and greenhouse gas emissions regulations gradually constrained its operational flexibility outside of peak hours.|$|E

25|$|The {{valley of}} Mexico is {{surrounded}} by mountains on all four sides creating a basin with only one small opening at the north, trapping all exhaust emissions of the city. At {{the southern part of}} the basin the mountain range reaches an altitude of 3,952 m (12,965ft) above sea level; and to the east the volcanoes reach an altitude of more than 5,000 m (16,000ft). The region receives anti-cyclonic systems, producing weak winds that do not allow for the dispersion of accumulated <b>air</b> <b>pollutants,</b> produced by the 50,000 industries operating in Greater Mexico City and the 4 million vehicles circulating in its roads and highways.|$|E
25|$|Though Los Angeles {{was one of}} {{the best}} known cities {{suffering}} from transportation smog for much of the 20th century, so much so that it was sometimes said that Los Angeles was a synonym for smog, strict regulations by government agencies overseeing this problem, including tight restrictions on allowed emissions levels for all new cars sold in California and mandatory regular emission tests of older vehicles, resulted in significant improvements in air quality. For example, air concentrations of volatile organic compounds declined by a factor of 50 between 1962 and 2012. Concentrations of <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> such as nitrous oxides and ozone declined by 70% to 80% over the same period of time.|$|E
25|$|Air {{pollution}} {{is a significant}} risk factor {{for a number of}} pollution-related diseases and health conditions including respiratory infections, heart disease, COPD, stroke and lung cancer. The health effects caused by air pollution may include difficulty in breathing, wheezing, coughing, asthma and worsening of existing respiratory and cardiac conditions. These effects can result in increased medication use, increased doctor or emergency room visits, more hospital admissions and premature death. The human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching, but principally affect the body's respiratory system and the cardiovascular system. Individual reactions to <b>air</b> <b>pollutants</b> depend on the type of pollutant a person is exposed to, the degree of exposure, and the individual's health status and genetics.|$|E

500|$|The {{technical}} {{literature on}} air pollution dispersion is quite extensive and {{dates back to}} the 1930s and earlier. One of the early <b>air</b> <b>pollutant</b> plume dispersion equations was derived by Bosanquet and Pearson. Their equation did not assume Gaussian distribution nor did it include the effect of ground reflection of the pollutant plume. [...] Sir Graham Sutton derived an <b>air</b> <b>pollutant</b> plume dispersion equation in 1947 which did include the assumption of Gaussian distribution for the vertical and crosswind dispersion of the plume and also included the effect of ground reflection of the plume. [...] Under the stimulus provided by the advent of stringent environmental control regulations, there was an immense growth in the use of <b>air</b> <b>pollutant</b> plume dispersion calculations between the late 1960s and today. A great many computer programs for calculating the dispersion of <b>air</b> <b>pollutant</b> emissions were developed {{during that period of time}} and they were called [...] "air dispersion models". The basis for most of those models was the Complete Equation For Gaussian Dispersion Modeling Of Continuous, Buoyant Air Pollution Plumes [...] The Gaussian <b>air</b> <b>pollutant</b> dispersion equation requires the input of H which is the pollutant plume's centerline height above ground level—and H is the sum of Hs (the actual physical height of the pollutant plume's emission source point) plus ΔH (the plume rise due the plume's buoyancy).|$|R
