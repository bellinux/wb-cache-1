5|$|Napoleon is seen wearing {{clothing}} {{appropriate for}} his location: over his uniform {{he wears a}} long topcoat which is wrapped firmly around him, in which he keeps his gloveless right hand warm. He retains <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> dignity in the gold-trimmed black bicorne he wears on his head. The mule Napoleon rides is undernourished, tired from its ordeal in struggling through the Alps. On {{the left of the}} mule is his guide, Pierre Nicholas Dorsaz, who must constantly push himself and the mule forward, and who leans heavily on the shaft of wood he clutches in his left hand to allow himself to continue moving forward. His clothes are weather-beaten, his face ruddy from the cold. He is not allowed the luxury of riding an animal, for he must be able to navigate independently, on the ground.|$|E
5|$|In 2036, FBI Agents Simon Foster (Henry Ian Cusick) and Henrietta 'Etta' Bishop (Georgina Haig) {{recover the}} body of Walter Bishop (John Noble), Walter having purposefully encased himself and his team in amber shortly after the Observer takeover. Though {{they are able to}} release him from the amber, they find that he has {{suffered}} memory damage and lacks the mental capacity to build a strange device of his own design. Simon and Etta talk to Nina Sharp (Blair Brown), learning that Walter had William Bell remove <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> brain some time in the past, which she postulates could be used to heal Walter's brain now. However, the piece is still in storage in the old Massive Dynamic facility on the main island of New York City, tightly controlled by Observers who can read their thoughts, making its recovery difficult. They are able {{to make it to the}} vault in Massive Dynamic, in part due to the inability of the Observers to read Etta's mind, and successfully restore Walter's memories. They are, however, unaware that they have alerted Fringe division—still led by Agent Broyles (Lance Reddick)—and the Observers to their presence; a coordinated team, instructed to shoot on sight, is dispatched.|$|E

25|$|On January 22, 2014, an anti-government {{activist and}} member of AutoMaidan was kidnapped by unknown parties and {{tortured}} for a week. His captors kept him in the dark, beat him, cut off <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> ear, and nailed him to a cross. His captors ultimately left him in a forest outside Kiev after forcing him to confess to being an American spy and accepting money from the US Embassy in Ukraine to organize protests against then-President Viktor Yanukovych.|$|E
25|$|A {{newspaper}} reported that Kelly's body was dissected by medical students who removed {{his head and}} organs for study. Dissection outside of a coronial enquiry was illegal. Public outrage at the rumour raised real fears of public disorder, leading the commissioner of police to write to the gaol's governor, who denied that a dissection had taken place. (Saw cuts on <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> occipital bone recovered in 2011 confirm that a dissection had been done.) His head was allegedly given to phrenologists for study, {{then returned to the}} police, who used it for a time as a paperweight.|$|E
25|$|Voldemort's {{creation}} of Horcruxes {{is central to}} the later storyline of the Harry Potter novels. As the number seven is a powerful number in magic, Voldemort intended to split his soul into that many pieces, with six Horcruxes and the last piece reposing within his body. When Voldemort attacked the Potter family, and his body was destroyed by the rebounded Killing Curse, <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> soul splintered off and attached itself to the only living thing remaining in the room, Harry Potter, {{in a manner similar to}} a Horcrux. Later on, Voldemort went on to complete his collection of the intended six Horcruxes by turning his snake Nagini into one, thus fragmenting his soul into a total of eight (counting the one residing in his own body), not seven, pieces. Complicating things even further, no more than six Horcruxes (including Harry) ever existed at any one time in the series: by the time Nagini had been made a Horcrux, one of the Horcruxes (Tom Riddle's diary) had already been destroyed.|$|E

A young Horatio Nelson was serving in the West Indies at the time, and wrote to his friend and patron William Locker about the captures, noting that William Williams, commander of Active had also died shortly afterwards, apparently of a broken heart. The heavy British losses at the time speeded Nelson's own promotion, and he was made master and commander of the brig [...] on 8 December 1778.|$|E
500|$|After {{being sent}} an invite to Aragog the Spider's funeral, he uses an hour's dose of Felix Felicis and succeeds in {{retrieving}} Slughorn's unedited memory {{while at the}} funeral. In it, Slughorn tells Riddle {{about the process of}} splitting one's soul and hiding it in several objects called Horcruxes. Only by committing a murder can a wizard turn an object into a Horcrux; Voldemort has created six of them, making himself virtually immortal by placing <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> soul in each and keeping the seventh and last one within his body. Dumbledore explains that in order to destroy Voldemort, all the Horcruxes must first be destroyed. Two Horcruxes—Riddle's diary from Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and a ring belonging to Voldemort's grandfather Marvolo Gaunt—have already been destroyed, but four others remain.|$|E

Before she can give it to him, Wonder Woman and her group arrive to retrieve the box. Upon touching the box, Wonder Woman is apparently possessed just as Superman was.|$|E
500|$|Like most spiders, the pedipalps {{of mature}} males {{end in a}} bulb {{terminating}} in a thin, curved [...] projection called an embolus, through which sperm is released during mating. Female U. catleyi have been observed with broken-off embolus tips lodged in their genitalia. This has been hypothesized {{as a type of}} [...] "sperm-plug" [...] or copulatory plug, where, by breaking off <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> anatomy (a process known as genital mutilation or genital breakage), a male physically precludes other males from successfully mating with the female, one of many types of sperm competition in animals. An alternative to the sperm competition function is that genital mutilation might allow males to more rapidly escape and avoid being cannibalized after mating, although this function is thought to be unlikely in Unicorn since there are no significant size differences between sexes, and cannibalism is more common when females are much larger than males. Sperm plugs of various types, including gelatinous or waxy substances, have been observed in at least 41 spider families, and are generally thought to ensure paternity. U. catlyei is one of only few goblin spiders known or suspected to utilize sperm plugs.|$|E

Even when he’s doing {{something as simple as}} a late night show performance, he makes sure he’s on his A game". The song was performed at NBC’s The Today Show on November 22, 2010, as part of the Toyota Concert Series and at the 2010 Soul Train Music Awards on November 28, 2010. On January 6, 2011, Mars performed [...] "Grenade" [...] on The Ellen DeGeneres Show with a guitar, [...] "backed by three background singers, a strings section, and pianist".

2500|$|Consequently, Tito Muñoz has {{received}} substantial media attention. Muñoz, a Colombian immigrant, is presently a small construction company owner and a United States citizen.

At the rally, he introduced Sarah Palin. He also had a confrontation with reporters. Will Rabbe, of the Independent Film Channel, has posted a video about Muñoz and his interaction with reporters. Five days before the election, Muñoz appeared on Fox News' Hannity & Colmes.

2500|$|During {{the rescue}} efforts {{following}} the bombing, a Catholic Chaplain named George Pucciarelli tore off <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Marine camouflage uniform {{to make a}} skullcap ("kippah") for Resnicoff, after Resnicoff used his to wipe the blood from a wounded Marine's face. This widely reported story, recounted in President Reagan's 1984 speech, was entered into the Congressional Record. [...] The story was credited with helping {{the passage of the}} religious apparel amendment allowing military personnel to wear head coverings for religious reasons (an amendment that had failed to pass in the House of Representatives for two years prior to the recounting of this story). This story was also quoted by some military leaders who had previously opposed the uniform policy change, but now supported it, including the Commandant and Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps. This amendment reportedly laid the groundwork for the directive (later, changed to a Department of Defense Instruction)that established wide-ranging changes to official military policies and procedures for the Accommodation of Religious Practices Within the Military Services.|$|E
2500|$|One {{example of}} visible {{religious}} apparel {{cited in the}} instructions as authorized, provided it passes the [...] "neat and conservative" [...] test, is the kippah (skullcap) worn by some Jewish personnel, referred to in some military directives by the Yiddish word, [...] "yarmulke." [...] The modern history of authorizing the kippa {{under the rubric of}} [...] "religious accommodation" [...] began with a 1986 Supreme Court case (Goldman v. Weinberger) involving an orthodox rabbi who was serving in the air force as a psychologist, not a chaplain, who had been told to remove his kippa. When the court affirmed that existing military regulations did give the military the right to prohibit the kippa if it so chose—and deferred to Congress to decide whether to change the situation—Congress attempted to introduce the [...] "neat and conservative" [...] approval rule in a proposed [...] "Religious Apparel Amendment." [...] That proposed amendment failed to pass for two years, ultimately passing after a story about two navy chaplains present during the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing was read into the Congressional Record. The story focused on Catholic Chaplain George Pucciarelli, who tore off <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Marine Corps uniform to replace Jewish Chaplain Arnold Resnicoff's kippah, bloodied after being used to wipe the faces of wounded Marines. This amendment passed, and was eventually incorporated into the newer DOD religious accommodation directive, which now exists in revised form as DOD Instruction 1300.17.|$|E
