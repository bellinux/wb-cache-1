5|$|Markway becomes {{alarmed at}} Eleanor's {{obsession}} with Hill House {{in spite of}} the dangers it poses for her. Despite Eleanor's pleas to stay, Markway insists that she leave at once and asks Luke to accompany her home. Before he can join her in the car, Eleanor drives off and speeds down the road toward the front gates. She soon feels the steering wheel move by itself and the car advances erratically. At first she struggles to regain control but then surrenders to the unseen force. Suddenly Grace appears from behind a tree and steps in front of the car. Eleanor crashes into the tree and is killed. Luke observes it seemed that Eleanor deliberately <b>aimed</b> <b>the</b> car at the tree, but Markway asserts that something was in the car with her. He notes that the tree that claimed Eleanor's life is the same one that killed the first Mrs. Crain. Theo remarks that Eleanor got what she wanted—to remain with the house.|$|E

Koestler-Grack reports that, on March 19, 1884, she {{was being}} watched by Chief Sitting Bull when:Oakley playfully skipped on stage, lifted her rifle, and <b>aimed</b> <b>the</b> barrel at a burning candle. In one shot, she snuffed out the flame with a {{whizzing}} bullet. Sitting Bull watched her knock corks off of bottles and slice through a cigar Butler held in his teeth.|$|E

25|$|Leavitt <b>aimed</b> <b>the</b> almanacs at {{the general}} {{population}} of New England, supplying tips on everything from farming to the weather to astronomy. As word spread about the publication, readership jumped, and the publication became a fixture throughout the region. The almanacs were sold at general stores, and later at grocery stores and drug stores. Leavitt was aided in some of the almanac's calculations geared towards agriculture by his nephew, astronomer William B. Leavitt.|$|E
25|$|Colton {{arranged}} for the demonstration of a prototype system in late November 1938. The system was designated SCR-268, with SCR meaning either Set Complete Radio or Signal Corps Radio used interchangeably in documents. The SCR-268 was primarily intended for aiming searchlights associated with anti-aircraft guns; the system allowed coarse pointing of a thermal infrared detector, and this then <b>aimed</b> <b>the</b> searchlight. The night demonstration was for the Coast Artillery Board and was conducted at Fort Monroe, just off the coast near Hampton, Virginia.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the Army {{had been}} very {{impressed}} {{with the performance of}} the 25cm experimental sets and became interested in using it as a range finder in a Gun Laying radar. Operators would point the radar at targets indicated to them by search radars, and from then on the radar information would be fed to the analogue computers that <b>aimed</b> <b>the</b> guns. Power was not a serious concern in this case as the range would be relatively short. The Air Defence Experimental Establishment (ADEE) of the Army was working on this using the klystron design from Birmingham and British Thomson-Houston (BTH) as their industrial partner.|$|E

25|$|On {{hearing of}} the Paris results, neither Rutherford nor James Chadwick at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge were {{convinced}} by the gamma ray hypothesis. Assisted by Norman Feather, Chadwick quickly performed a series of experiments showing that the gamma ray hypothesis was untenable. He repeated {{the creation of the}} radiation using beryllium, used better approaches to detection, and <b>aimed</b> <b>the</b> radiation at paraffin following the Paris experiment. Paraffin is high in hydrogen content, hence offers a target dense with protons; since neutrons and protons have almost equal mass, protons scatter energetically from neutrons. Chadwick measured the range of these protons, and also measured how the new radiation impacted the atoms of various gases. He found that the new radiation consisted of not gamma rays, but uncharged particles with about the same mass as the proton; these particles were neutrons. Chadwick won the Nobel Prize in Physics for this discovery in 1935.|$|E
25|$|On {{the weekend}} of March 1–2, 1992, Mayor Daley and wife Maggie {{attended}} a family party in New York, and 16-year-old Patrick was to stay with relatives. Patrick told the relatives he was staying with friends and drove his father's new sports utility vehicle to the Daley second home in Grand Beach, Michigan and threw a party Saturday night. Patrick fetched former Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley's 20-gauge double-barrel shotgun from the Daley home {{and handed it to}} his cousin, R. J. Vanecko, 17. Vanecko <b>aimed</b> <b>the</b> shotgun at teenagers, pulled the trigger twice and yelled that he was not afraid to use the weapon. A youth threw a concrete goose lawn ornament through the windshield of Mayor Daley's truck, and Patrick punched him. A youth was seriously injured when struck {{in the head with a}} baseball bat wielded by a juvenile, was hospitalized in critical condition, underwent surgery to remove a blood clot on his brain and spent three days in intensive care.|$|E
25|$|The {{collaboration}} with socialist Prime Minister Victor Ponta was praised {{by both sides}} {{at the start of}} the mandate, but deteriorated thereafter once with foreign visits of the Head of the Executive, without informing the President, but especially with the criminal prosecution of Victor Ponta for 22 alleged corruption charges, prompting Iohannis to demand his resignation from the head of the Government. Relations with Parliament went similarly. Iohannis criticized the Parliament for defending MPs by rejecting the requests of the National Anticorruption Directorate for lifting their immunity, as in the case of PSD senator Dan Șova or Prime Minister Victor Ponta. Regarding the judicial system, Klaus Iohannis pleads for a sustained fight against corruption. Likewise, Iohannis expressed dissatisfaction with attempted amendments to the Penal Code. Since coming into office, President Klaus Iohannis has made a habit to hold consultations with parliamentary parties. The first round of consultations took place on 12 January, the purpose of these discussions being a political agreement that would ensure, by 2017, a minimum threshold of 2% of GDP for the Ministry of Defence, agreement signed by all parties. The second round of consultations focused on the legislative priorities of the parliamentary session: voting in diaspora, financing electoral campaigns and parties and lifting parliamentary immunity. Because the Parliament has not implemented the commitments made on 28 January, Iohannis has organised another series of consultations on the state of electoral laws, but also on rejection of Justice requests for approval of arrest or prosecution of MPs. The topics of other meetings between the president and parties <b>aimed</b> <b>the</b> Big Brother law package and the national defense strategy.|$|E

25|$|On 4 May 1789, al-Jazzar {{dispatched}} two of {{his senior}} mamluk commanders and their troops to collect taxes from Emir Yusuf, which the latter had been reticent to pay. For this purpose, Salim Pasha al-Saghir was sent with 2,000 cavalry to Hasbaya, while Sulayman Pasha was sent with 800 infantry to the coast. According to French consul Jean-Pierre Renaudot, the relatively large size of mobilized troops sent for a relatively routine procedure such as collecting taxes was actually an attempt by al-Jazzar to avoid contributing his forces to the Ottoman war effort with Russia by demonstrating how his forces were still needed to combat the Druze of Mount Lebanon. On 8 May, al-Jazzar became aware of sexual relations between {{a number of his}} mamluks and women from his harem. He consequently cut off the arms of the mamluks who were headquartered in Acre's seraglio (where the harem was located) and had a number of women drowned at sea. On 9 May, al-Jazzar proceeded to purge his mamluks, arresting many, a number of whom were then executed, with the assistance of 30 Bosnian soldiers. The mamluks of Acre subsequently revolted and barricaded themselves in the treasury, which was located in Acre's Big Tower. Angered by the execution of his favored valet, the treasurer, a brother of Salim Pasha, then broke the incarcerated mamluks out of prison and linked up with the mamluk rebels at the Big Tower. The mamluks <b>aimed</b> <b>the</b> artillery pieces of the Big Tower at the seraglio and threatened to destroy it.|$|E
500|$|Despite having {{denied that}} he <b>aimed</b> <b>the</b> stone at an Israeli guardhouse, the Beirut {{newspaper}} As-Safir (The Ambassador) reported that a Lebanese local resident reported that Prof. Said was at less than ten metres (ca. 30 ft.) distance from the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) soldiers manning the two-storey guardhouse, when Said aimed and threw the stone over the border fence; the stone’s projectile path was thwarted when it struck the barbed wire atop the border fence. Nonetheless, in the U.S., despite a political fracas by right-wing students at Columbia University and the Anti-Defamation League of B’nai B’rith International (Sons of the Covenant), the university provost published a five-page letter defending Prof. Said’s action as an academic’s freedom of expression: ...|$|E

500|$|During the Napoleonic Wars, a British gun team {{consisted}} of 5 numbered gunners - fewer crew than {{needed in the}} previous century.

The No.2 was the [...] "spongeman" [...] who cleaned the bore with the sponge dampened with water between shots; the intention being to quench any remaining embers before a fresh charge was introduced. The No.3, the loader, inserted the bag of powder and then the projectile. The No.2 then used a rammer, or the sponge reversed, to drive it in. At the same time, the No.4 ("ventsman") pressed his thumb on the vent hole to prevent a draught that might fan a flame. The charge loaded, the No.4 pricked the bagged charge through the vent hole and filled the vent with powder. At the No.1s command the No.5 would fire the piece with his slowmatch.|$|E
500|$|Pervenets rolled {{heavily in}} service, {{therefore}} bilge keels were fitted {{during the winter}} of 1864–65, the first used on a Russian ship. To alleviate the cramped conditions of the steersmen, the ship's wheel was transferred from the gun deck to a platform that spanned her bulwarks in front of the mizzenmast in 1871. In 1872 she evaluated the Davydov fire-control system that could fire all guns electrically and indicated to the gunners where their guns should be <b>aimed.</b> <b>The</b> conning tower was removed in 1876–77 and new boilers were installed.

She was reclassified as a coast defense ironclad on 13 February 1892 and was placed in reserve on 23 December 1904. The ship was disarmed the following year and stricken from the Navy List on 15 September 1905. Turned over to the Port of Kronstadt for disposal, she was sold on 8 September 1908 and renamed Barge No. 1 (Barzha No. 1).|$|E
