5|$|Fauré's {{music has}} been {{described}} as linking the end of Romanticism with the modernism of the second quarter of the 20th century. When he was born, Chopin was still composing, and by the time of Fauré's death, jazz and the <b>atonal</b> <b>music</b> of the Second Viennese School were being heard. The Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, which describes him as the most advanced composer of his generation in France, notes that his harmonic and melodic innovations influenced the teaching of harmony for later generations. During the last twenty years of his life, he suffered from increasing deafness. In contrast with the charm of his earlier music, his works from this period are sometimes elusive and withdrawn in character, and at other times turbulent and impassioned.|$|E
25|$|The {{vocabulary}} of serialism eventually became rooted in set theory, {{and uses a}} seemingly quasi-mathematical vocabulary to describe how the basic sets are manipulated to produce the final result. Musical set theory {{is often used to}} analyze and compose serial music, but may also be used to study tonal music and nonserial <b>atonal</b> <b>music.</b>|$|E
25|$|Musical {{set theory}} {{provides}} concepts for categorizing musical objects and describing their relationships. Many of the notions were first elaborated by Howard Hanson (1960) {{in connection with}} tonal music, and then mostly developed in connection with <b>atonal</b> <b>music</b> by theorists such as Allen Forte (1973), drawing on the work in twelve-tone theory of Milton Babbitt. The concepts of set theory are very general and {{can be applied to}} tonal and atonal styles in any equally tempered tuning system, and to some extent more generally than that.|$|E
5000|$|More generally, {{a musical}} {{permutation}} is any reordering {{of the prime}} form of an ordered set of pitch classes [...] or, with respect to twelve-tone rows, any ordering {{at all of the}} set consisting of the integers modulo 12. In that regard, a musical permutation is a combinatorial permutation from mathematics as it applies to music. Permutations are in no way limited to the twelve-tone serial and <b>atonal</b> <b>musics,</b> but are just as well utilized in tonal melodies especially during the 20th and 21st centuries, notably in Rachmaninoffs Variations on the Theme of Paganini for orchestra and piano.|$|R

25|$|The {{most famous}} French {{composer}} {{of the late}} Belle Époque in Paris was Claude Debussy (1862-1918). He was born at Saint-Germain-en-Laye, near Paris, and entered the Conservatory in 1872. He {{became part of the}} Parisian literary circle of the symbolist poet Mallarme. At first an admirer of Richard Wagner, he went on to experiment with impressionism in music, <b>atonal</b> <b>music</b> and chromaticism. His most famous works include Clair de Lune for piano (written ca. 1890, published 1905), La Mer for orchestra (1905) and the opera Pelléas et Mélisande (1903-1905).|$|E
25|$|While the {{influence}} of Brahms is evoked in Zemlinsky's early works (prompting encouragement from Brahms himself), an original voice is present from the first works on, handling dissonances in a much freer manner than Brahms. Later works adopt the kind of extended harmonies that Wagner had introduced and also reflect {{the influence}} of Mahler. In contrast to his friend Schoenberg, he never wrote <b>atonal</b> <b>music,</b> and never used the twelve-tone technique. However, some of his late works such as the Symphonische Gesänge, Sinfonietta and {{the third and fourth}} string quartets move away from post-Romanticism towards a leaner, harder-edged idiom that incorporates elements of Neue Sachlichkeit, Neoclassicism, and even jazz.|$|E
25|$|In music, {{even if the}} {{opposition}} often is founded on the preceding, objective distinction, it more often is subjective, conventional, cultural, and style- and/or period-dependent. Dissonance can then {{be defined as a}} combination of sounds that does not belong to the style under consideration; in recent music, what is considered stylistically dissonant may even correspond to what is said to be consonant {{in the context of a}}coustics (e.g. a major triad in 20th century <b>atonal</b> <b>music).</b> A major second (e.g. the notes C and D played simultaneously) would be considered dissonant if it occurred in a J.S. Bach prelude from the 1700s; however, the same interval may sound consonant in the context of a Claude Debussy piece from the early 1900s or an atonal contemporary piece.|$|E

5000|$|Fartein Valen (25 August 1887 [...] - [...] 14 December 1952) was a Norwegian composer, {{notable for}} his work in <b>atonal</b> {{polyphonic}} <b>music.</b> He developed a polyphony similar to Bach's counterpoint, but based on motivic working and dissonance rather than harmonic progression.|$|R
50|$|From 1991-1995 Marchisano-Adamo studied {{music at}} the Franz Liszt Academy of Music in Budapest, Hungary with Ferenc Rados and Balázs Szokolay. It was in Budapest that he {{discovered}} <b>atonal,</b> electronic <b>music,</b> and serial composition. György Kurtág, György Ligeti, Karlheinz Stockhausen, La Monte Young, Terry Riley, Steve Reich, and John Cage are some of his influences.|$|R
25|$|In {{the modern}} era, musical set theory uses the {{language}} of mathematical set theory in an elementary way to organize musical objects and describe their relationships. To analyze {{the structure of a}} piece of (typically <b>atonal)</b> <b>music</b> using musical set theory, one usually starts with a set of tones, which could form motives or chords. By applying simple operations such as transposition and inversion, one can discover deep structures in the music. Operations such as transposition and inversion are called isometries because they preserve the intervals between tones in a set. Expanding on the methods of musical set theory, some theorists have used abstract algebra to analyze music. For example, the pitch classes in an equally tempered octave form an abelian group with 12 elements. It is possible to describe just intonation in terms of a free abelian group.|$|E
25|$|The Nazi regime passed notorious edicts banning jazz {{records and}} muted {{trumpets}} calling them degenerate art or entartete Kunst. “Degenerate Music” was an exhibit {{sponsored by the}} Nazi regime that singled out “degeneracy” {{or the use of}} <b>atonal</b> <b>music,</b> jazz, discordant-sounding organization of tones and the individual composers and conductors, both of Aryan and non-Aryan descent. The “Degenerative Music” exhibit actually had the opposite effect of what the Nazis had hoped because soldiers became interested in genuine jazz (Potter). The documentary film Swing Under the Swastika looks at Jazz music under the Nazi regime in Germany, and at the cases of the Madlung sisters who were sent to Ravensbruck concentration camp merely for owning jazz records. There are also interviews with jazz drummer and guitarist Coco Schumann and pianist Martin Roman, who were saved in the camps so they could and had to play for SS officers and during executions in Auschwitz as part of the `Ghetto Swingers'.|$|E
25|$|Music-specific neural {{networks}} {{exist in the}} brain {{for a variety of}} music-related tasks. It has been shown that Broca's area is involved in the processing of musical syntax. Furthermore, brain damage can disrupt an individual's ability {{to tell the difference between}} tonal and <b>atonal</b> <b>music</b> and detect the presence of wrong notes, but can preserve the individual's ability to assess the distance between pitches and the direction of the pitch. The opposite scenario can also occur, in which the individual loses pitch discrimination capabilities, but can sense and appreciate the tonal context of the work. Distinct {{neural networks}} also exist for music memories, singing, and music recognition. Neural networks for music recognition are particularly intriguing. A patient can undergo brain damage that renders him/her unable to recognize familiar melodies that are presented without words. However, the patient maintains the ability to recognize spoken lyrics or words, familiar voices, and environmental sounds. The reverse case is also possible, in which the patient cannot recognize spoken words, but can still recognize familiar melodies. These situations overturn previous claims that speech recognition and music recognition share a single processing system. Instead, it is clear that there are at least two distinct processing modules: one for speech and one for music.|$|E

Sandved also participated actively in the public sphere, defending the composer Fartein Valen and his <b>atonal</b> polyphonic <b>music</b> in the local newspapers.

500|$|Ralph Oliver Patt (5 December 1929 – 6 October 2010) was an American jazz-guitarist who {{introduced}} major-thirds tuning. Patt's tuning simplified {{the learning of}} the fretboard and chords by beginners and improvisation by advanced guitarists. He invented major-thirds tuning under the inspiration of first the <b>atonal</b> <b>music</b> of Arnold Schoenberg and second [...] the jazz of John Coltrane and Ornette Coleman.|$|E
500|$|Patt was {{inspired}} by the jazz of OrnetteColeman and JohnColtrane and the <b>atonal</b> <b>music</b> of Schoenberg. Seeking a guitar-tuning that would facilitate improvisation, [...] he introduced major-thirds tuning by 1964, perhaps in 1963. Patt's tuning is a regular tuning in the sense that all of the intervals between its successive open strings are major thirds; in contrast, the standard guitar-tuning has one major-third amid four fourths. Patt used major-thirds tuning during all of his work as a session musician after 1965 in New York.|$|E
500|$|With Frank Angelo as {{his manager}} since 1961, Laucke {{performed}} his first guitar concert in Montreal in 1965, {{a program of}} <b>atonal</b> <b>music</b> with the Société de musique contemporaine du Québec. In 1971, following {{the first of his}} many concerts at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., The Washington Post proclaimed Laucke displayed: [...] "the highest form of virtuosity". His first concert in New York took place in 1972 at the Greenwich House Music School. U.S. Senator Claiborne Pell was in attendance and invited Laucke to perform his first concerts in Washington, DC, beginning a 15-year affiliation as Laucke's active supporter in the U.S. Pell's former campaign manager, Raymond Nelson, handled logistics for many of Laucke's U.S. performances. Laucke starred in a 1973 documentary produced by Radio-Québec called La Guitare. He performed at Montreal's Summer Olympic Games in 1976.|$|E

50|$|Khalatbari's {{conducting}} repertoire spans a {{wide spectrum}} of musical traditions, ranging from classical opera and symphonic, to <b>atonal</b> and contemporary <b>music.</b> Conducting the Simorq musical project, the world premiere of Hamid Motebassem with Homayoun Shajarian's vocal, is one of the brightest points in this range.|$|R
50|$|His musical {{approaches}} are very diverse, ranging from direct to abstract {{in response to}} various characteristics (subject matter, language, style, structure, historical era, etc.) of the texts he sets. His Latin sacred settings, such as the Lux Aeterna and motets, often reference Gregorian chant plus Medieval and Renaissance procedures while blending them within a freshly contemporary sound while other works such as the Madrigali and Cuatro Canciones are highly chromatic or <b>atonal.</b> His <b>music</b> has an overall lyricism and is tightly constructed around melodic and harmonic motives.|$|R
500|$|Aaron Copland {{wrote that}} {{although}} Fauré's works {{can be divided}} into the usual [...] "early", [...] "middle" [...] and [...] "late" [...] periods, there is no such radical difference between his first and last manners as is evident with many other composers. Copland found premonitions of late Fauré in even the earliest works, and traces of the early Fauré in the works of his old age: [...] "The themes, harmonies, form, have remained essentially the same, but with each new work they have all become more fresh, more personal, more profound." [...] When Fauré was born, Berlioz and Chopin were still composing; the latter was among Fauré’s early influences. In his later years Fauré developed compositional techniques that foreshadowed the <b>atonal</b> <b>music</b> of Schoenberg, and, later still, drew discreetly on the techniques of jazz. Duchen writes that early works such as the Cantique de Jean Racine are in the tradition of French nineteenth-century romanticism, yet his late works are as modern as any of the works of his pupils.|$|E
