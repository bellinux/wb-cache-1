Cultures of leukocytes obtained from animals immune to CV produced 2 - to 10 -fold greater amounts of interferon when exposed to an inoculum of CV than similar cell preparations from nonimmune, control animals. The viral inhibitor produced in increased quantity by CV-immune leukocytes had the biological and biochemical properties of interferon. The enhanced interferon production was inhibited by actinomycin D. This response of immune leukocytes was specific, and was initiated only by CV; it was not observed in leukocytes from animals immunized against other viruses which were challenged with CV. The presence of neutralizing antibody could not be related to this response. The observed increase in interferon production was not dependent upon an enhanced virus uptake.

Several members of the aquaporin (AQP) family of water channel–forming integral membrane proteins {{have been identified in}} epididymal cells, but expression profiling for this epithelium is presently incomplete, and no AQP isoform has yet been identified on basolateral plasma membranes of these cells. In this study, we explored AQP expression by RT-PCR and light microscopy immunolocalizations using peroxidase and wide-field fluorescence techniques. The results indicate that several AQPs are coexpressed in the epididymis including AQP 5, 7, 9, and 11. Immunolocalizations suggested complex patterns in the spatial distribution of these AQPs. In principal cells, AQP 9 and 11 were present mainly on microvilli, whereas AQP 7 was localized primarily to lateral and then to basal plasma membranes in a region-specific manner. AQP 5 was also expressed regionally but was associated with membranes of endosomes. Additionally, AQPs were expressed by some but not all basal (AQP 7 and 11), clear (AQP 7 and 9), and halo (AQP 7 and 11) cells.

It {{was hypothesized that}} such activation occurs in the kidneys of hypertensive rats and causes tissue reninangiotensin system (RAS) activation and end-organ damage. Because the HR’s binding to its binding protein made the adjacent tetrameric “gate region ” (GR) accessible to its specific antibody, immunohistochemistry of the GR was performed to test the hypothesis. Methods also were devised specifically to inhibit the nonproteolytic activation by the decapeptide corresponding to the HR as a decoy.

Continuous subcutaneous administration of the HR decoy peptide completely inhibited both nonproteolytic activation of tissue prorenin and activation of tissue RAS without affecting circulating RAS or arterial pressure and significantly attenuated the development and progression of proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis.

40|$|The {{organization}} of the cnidarian nervous system has been widely documented in polyps and medusae, but {{little is known about}} the nervous system of planula larvae, which give rise to adult forms after settling and metamorphosis. We describe histological and cytological features of the nervous system in planulae of the hydrozoan Clava multicornis. These planulae do not swim freely in the water column, but rather crawl on the substrate by means of directional, coordinated ciliary movement coupled to lateral muscular bending movements associated with positive phototaxis. Histological analysis shows pronounced antero-posterior regionalization of the planula`s nervous system, with a different neural cell types highly concentrated at the anterior pole. Transmission electron microscopy of planulae shows the nervous system to be unusualy complex, with a large orderly array of sensory cells at the anterior pole. In the anterior half of the planula the basi-ectodermal plexus of neurites forms an extensive orthogonal network, whereas more posteriorly neurites extend longitudinally along the body axis. Additional levels of nervous system complexity are uncovered by neuropeptide-specific immunocytochemistry, which reveal distinct neural subsets having specific molecular phenotypes. Together these observations imply that the nervous system of planulae of Clava multicornis manifests a remarkable level of histological, cytological and functional organization, whose features may be reminiscent of those present in early bilaterian <b>animals.</b> <b>J.</b> Comp.

The sodium salt inhibited both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria by filter paper disc assays at concentrations of 0. 012 – 12. 0 mg/ml.

In an attempt to explain the absence of typical strains of Escherichia coli and the suppression of the atypical coliform microflora in the anterior gastrointestinal segments of pygoscelid penguins in areas where the phytoplankton was dominated by P. pouchetii, chick trials were conducted with sodium acrylate. Acrylate supplementation of chicken feed at levels as low as one-fifth (0. 01 %) of those estimated to be ingested by penguins under natural conditions, suppressed the E. coli population and permitted its partial replacement by Aerobacter aerogenes.

In these experiments we examined the effects of aggressive encounters and physical restraint in a primate chair on the patterns of LH secretion in ovariectomized, oestrogen-primed female marmosets. Receipt of aggression from a female conspecific, followed by physical restraint for collection of blood samples (at 10 -min intervals for 4 h), resulted in marked declines in LH concentrations during oestradiol-induced LH surges in five animals(from 112 =+- 4 =m/lto 45 =+- 2 =m/l;group means =+- s. e. m.; P< 0 =. 5). This was due to reductions in LH pulse amplitude rather than to changes in pulse frequency. Decreases in plasma concentrations of LH were reversed by treating females with exogenous LH-releasing hormone (LHRH). Cortisol treatment had no effect on LH levels during oestrogen-induced LH surges. Effects of aggressive encounters and physi-cal restraint on plasma LH were not therefore due to reduced pituitary responsiveness to LHRH or to increased plasma concentrations of cortisol. In separate experiments it was found that physical restraint alone had no effect on plasma LH in habitu-ated subjects, and that decreases in plasma LH after receipt of aggression only occurred if animals were subsequently placed in the restraint chair. A sum-mation of stressful effects is therefore required to pro-duce the fall in circulating LH.

This type of experiment has discontinued in this laboratory {{in favor of an}} airborne challenge type of experiment, with the advantages that animals can be challenged with small numbers of bacilli by a natural route, and the number of primary lesions, the rate of spread from those lesions, and the rate of bacillary multiplication can be used to evaluate protection.

As in rats, infusion of ANP to rabbits resulted in a diuresis, natriuresis, and increase in GFR; however, unlike in rats, the fractional excretion of phosphate (Pi) was not changed. In BBMV prepared from cortices of ANP-infused rabbits, the rate of Na+-H+ antiport was decreased (Δ - 27 %), but Na+ gradient-dependent uptakes of Pi and L-proline were not different from controls. Incubation of rabbit cortical tubule suspension in vitro with ANP 10 - 7 M alone had no inhibitory effect on Na+-H+ antiport in BBMV prepared from these tubules, whereas incubation with other hormonal agents, 1 U/ml PTH (Δ 61 %) or with dopamine (DA) 10 - 4 M (Δ - 34 %), did inhibit the rate of Na+-H+ antiport in BBMV from the same pool of tubules. However, when tubules were incubated {{in the presence of}} (10 - 5 M) DA, the addition of 10 - 7 M ANP did cause a significant (Δ - 21 %) decrease in Na+-H+ antiport activity in BBMV. In contrast, ANP did not show similar inhibitory effect in the presence of submaximal inhibitory doses of PTH. To explore whether ANP may act on proximal tubules in vivo indirectly, via mediation of DA, we evaluated the effect of ANP on some parameters of catecholamine system in vivo. Infusion of ANP, in doses which caused inhibition of Na+-H+ antiport in BBMV and natriuresis, markedly enhanced (Δ + 134 %) excretion of non-conjugated DA in urine, indicating increased intrarenal generation of DA, while it had no detectable effect on the plasma levels of DA, its precursor L-dopa, or on DA content in extracts of renal cortical tissue. Taken together, these observations provide evidence for the hypothesis that circulating ANP can inhibit the rate of Na+-H+ exchange across renal BBM: a) indirectly, via the autocrine DA system in renal proximal tubules, that is, ANP, enhances the intrarenal generation of DA, which in turn inhibits Na+-H+ antiport; b) in addition, ANP may also directly potentiate the inhibitory action of DA on Na+-H+ antiport...|$|E
