25|$|Israel prohibits its {{citizens}} from visiting enemy nations without permission, a travel restriction which, in 2015, included Syria, Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia. The <b>Adalah</b> Legal Center claims this disproportionately discriminates against Arab-Israeli citizens, and that authorities did not detain Jewish Israelis upon return from trips to unauthorized countries {{as they did}} with Arab Israelis. The Israel Airports Authority has also been criticised for racial profiling of Arab citizens.|$|E
25|$|On 7 February 2004, Mohammad Kana'neh, the General Secretary the {{movement}} and a board member for the NGO Ittijah, was arrested in his home in Arrabe {{at four in the}} morning. According to the legal advocacy group, <b>Adalah,</b> during the search of his home, Israeli police beat his son, wife, and mother. Also arrested that day was Mohammed's brother, Hussam Kana'neh (also known as Majed), a central committee member of Abnaa el-Balad. Initially, no reasons were provided for their arrest, nor were they allowed contact to their lawyer, and a court hearing the night of their arrest granted the police the right to detain them for 10 days.|$|E
25|$|In September 2007, the High Court heard {{a further}} <b>Adalah</b> {{petition}} seeking cancellation of an ILA policy {{as well as}} Article 27 of the Regulations of the Obligations of Tenders, which in concert prevent Arab citizens from participating in bids for JNF-controlled land. The High Court of Justice agreed to delay a ruling by at least four months, and a temporary settlement was reached (following the compromise proposed in 2005 by Menachem Mazuz) wherein, although the JNF would be prevented from discriminating on grounds of ethnicity, nevertheless every time land is sold to a non-Jew, the ILA would compensate it with an equivalent amount of land, thus ensuring {{the total amount of}} land owned by Jewish Israelis remains the same.|$|E
25|$|On April 15 {{humanitarian}} aid organizations were granted {{access to the}} camp {{for the first time}} since the invasion had begun. Palestinian Red Crescent Society and International Committee of the Red Cross staff entered the camp, accompanied by the IDF. Officials from the Red Crescent told lawyer Hassan Jabareen that the IDF did not allow them to move around the camps freely, and that advanced decomposition, as well as the enormous destruction in the camp, made it impossible to find and retrieve bodies without the proper equipment. That same day <b>Adalah</b> and LAW, the Palestinian Society for the Protection of Human Rights and the Environment, filed a petition asking the Court to order the IDF to immediately hand over the bodies of Palestinians to the Red Cross or the Red Crescent, saying that the bodies of dead Palestinians were being left to rot in the camp. On April 19, a day after Israeli troops withdrew from the camp, journalists reported counting about 23 bodies that were lined up on the outdoor grounds of the clinic, before being quickly buried by Palestinians.|$|E

2500|$|The Arab Association for Human Rights, <b>Adalah,</b> Mossawa, I'lam, {{and other}} Arab NGOs in Israel cited “deep rooted {{frustration}} [...] {{at their own}} status as second class Israeli citizens,” as an underlying factor.

In 2007, Nabiah A-Din, {{the chairman of the}} forum of the Druze and Circassian authority heads, and head of the Kasra Adia municipality, criticized the [...] "multi-cultural" [...] Israeli constitution proposed by the Israeli Arab organization <b>Adalah,</b> saying that he finds it unacceptable.

2500|$|The same day, in {{response}} to a petition presented by the <b>Adalah</b> organization, the Israeli High Court ordered the IDF to stop removing the bodies of Palestinians killed in battle until after a hearing on the matter. MK Ahmed Tibi, one of many signatories to the petition before the court, said that removing the bodies from the city violated international law and was [...] "intended to hide the truth from the public about the killing that occurred there". Following the court's decision, issued by Supreme Court President Aharon Barak, the IDF stopped clearing the bodies from the camp. It was reported that by the afternoon of April 13, the IDF had determined the location of 23 bodies in the camp which were marked on maps. On April 14, the Supreme Court reversed its decision, and ruled that the IDF could remove the bodies. IDF Chief of Staff Shaul Mofaz confirmed to Israeli media on April 14 that the army intended to bury the bodies in the special cemetery.|$|E
