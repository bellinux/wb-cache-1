40|$|During March through June 1964, an {{epidemic}} of acute non-vibrio diarrhoeal disease, closely simulating cholera, occurred in Calcutta. To clarify the etiology and pathophysiology and improve the therapy of this illness, bacteriological and metabolic studies were performed on 145 consecutive hypotensive adult male patients admitted with <b>acute</b> <b>diarrhoeal</b> <b>disease</b> to the Calcutta Infectious Disease Hospital. Bacteriological and serological studies clearly demonstrated {{that the majority of}} patients with <b>acute</b> <b>diarrhoeal</b> <b>disease</b> admitted during this period of time were not suffering from V. cholerae infection; no known pathogen could be recovered from 86 % of such patients. Biochemical studies indicated that, in contrast to the findings in cholera, factors other than saline depletion contributed to hypotension in many of the patients with non-vibrio diarrhoeal disease. Although the majority of the acute diarrhoeal patients responded well to the 2 : 1 saline: lactate regimen which is consistently successful in treating adult cholera patients, six of the non-cholera patients required prolonged administration of vasopressor drugs as an adjunct to fluid and electrolyte repletion therapy...|$|E

With the advent of the Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI) strategy, this programme subsequently emerged as a community-based IMCI but retained its mainstream activities. We reviewed and analysed policy decisions and programme development, implementation and expansion. Local setting Severe resource constraints and difficult terrain limit access to health-care facilities in many parts of Nepal. Relevant changes In districts with interventions, more cases of acute diarrhoea and of ARIs (including pneumonia) were reported. The proportion of diarrhoea cases with dehydration and the proportion of ARI cases with pneumonia were significantly lower in districts with interventions. Case fatality rates due to acute diarrhoea and the proportion of severe pneumonia among ARI cases across the country showed a significant trend towards a decrease from 2004 to 2007.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Diarrhoeal</b> <b>diseases</b> {{constitute}} one of {{the most}} important causes of illness and death all over the world. In Nigeria, the epidemiology of diarrheagenic bacteria and the virulence of the various E. coli pathotypes have not been well studied because most of the currently published data were from the southwestern axis leaving the southeast and north unstudied. 520 stool samples were collected from infants, young children and other age groups with <b>acute</b> <b>diarrhoeal</b> <b>diseases</b> in Enugu and Onitsha, Southeastern Nigeria. Stool samples from 250 apparently healthy individuals with similar age distribution and locality were used as control subjects. The stool samples were screened for diarrhoeal causing bacterial agents. The isolated E. coli strains from both groups were examined by PCR for 16 virulence genes. Out of the 520 stool samples in the diarrhoea group, majority, 102 (44. 74 %) were Esherichia coli. Fifty (49. 02 %) were enteropathogenic (EPEC), 22 (21. 57 %) were enterotoxigenic (ETEC) while 7. 84 % was EAEC. Sex had no effect on the distribution of diarrhoegenic bacteria, except for EIEC. The isolated E. coli strains from the diarrhea and healthy asymptomatic age-matched control groups examined by PCR for 16 virulence genes indicates that the detection of EAEC, ETEC, EPEC and EIEC were significantly associated with diarrhea. The isolation of about eight different bacterial pathogens of diarrheogenic importance especially E. coli confirms the fact that these organisms play important role in the etiology of acute diarrhoea in Southeastern Nigeria.

40|$|Diarrhoeal {{disease and}} its {{complications}} remain {{a major cause}} of morbidity and mortality in children, especially in developing countries. Diarrhoea is characterised by an increased frequency and volume, and decreased consistency of stool from the norm. Pathogens vary between developed and developing world settings. Rotavirus diarrhoea is the most important aetiological agent implicated in severe dehydrating diarrhoea. Although it is important to recognise the specific microbiological causation of diarrhoea in order to target appropriate treatment, the broader preventive aspects put forward by the World Health Organization (WHO) indicate the fundamental contributors to the massive burden of disease in developing countries. The management of a child presenting with acute diarrhoea must include a thorough history and examination with evaluation of hydration status, nutritional status and comprehensive clinical evaluation for any complications or associated illnesses.

40|$|Acute {{gastroenteritis}} {{in children}} Acute gastroenteritis {{is a common}} problem in children and refers to infections of the gastrointestinal tract caused by viral, bacterial or para-sitic pathogens. Most cases are not serious and self-limiting. However, severe complications and a high mortality rate may be associated, with diarrhoea being responsible for up to 2. 5 million deaths worldwide in young children each year. Diarrhoea may also contribute to serious morbidity where acute cases become persistent with a signifi cant impact on nutritional status.

While no antimicrobial resistance to ciprofloxacin was found for both Shigella species, only 36 and 26 % of the Shigella isolates were sensitive to ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ), respectively. These findings point out to the emergence of drug resistance to commonly used antimicrobial drugs.

40|$|Vibrio cholerae is a Gram-negative {{pathogen}} {{which causes}} <b>acute</b> <b>diarrhoeal</b> <b>disease,</b> cholera by {{the expression of}} virulence genes through quorum sensing (QS) mechanism. The QS circuit of V. cholerae {{is controlled by the}} global quorum regulator, LuxO, which at low cell density (LCD) state produces major virulence factors such as, toxin co-regulated pilus (TCP) and cholera toxin (CT) to mediate infection. On the contrary, at the high cell density (HCD) state the virulent genes are downregulated and the vibrios are detached from the host intestinal epithelial cells, promoted by HapA protease. Hence, targeting the global regulator LuxO would be a promising approach to modulate the QS to curtail V. cholerae pathogenesis. In our earlier studies, LuxO targeted ligand, 2, 3 pyrazine dicarboxylic acid (PDCA) and its derivatives having desired pharmacophore properties were chemically synthesized and were shown to have biofilm inhibition as well as synergistic activity with the conventionally used antibiotics. In the present study, the QS modulatory effect of the PDCA derivative with pyrrolidine moiety designated as PDCApy against the V. cholerae virulence gene expression was analyzed at various growth phases. The data significantly showed a several fold reduction in the expression of the genes, tcp and ct whereas the expression of hapR was upregulated at the LCD state. In addition, PDCApy reduced the adhesion and invasion of the vibrios onto the INT 407 intestinal cell lines.

To the extent that the behaviours of these parties can be accurately mapped, they may reveal important sites for effective community interventions and the improvement of medical care. This possibility is explored in relation to infant mortality in Cape Town, South Africa, by analysing verbal histories provided by the caregivers of 70 infants in the course of obtaining police death certification. From these verbal histories it appears that acute respiratory infection and <b>diarrhoeal</b> <b>disease</b> caused the majority of deaths.

40|$|Vibrio cholerae, the {{etiological}} {{agent of}} <b>acute</b> <b>diarrhoeal</b> <b>disease</b> cholera, harbors {{large numbers of}} lysogenic filamentous phages, contribute significantly to the host pathogenesis and provide fitness factors to the pathogen that help the bacterium to survive in natural environment. Most of the vibriophage genomes are not equipped with integrase and thus exploit two host-encoded tyrosine recombinases, XerC and XerD, for lysogenic conversion. Integration is site-specific and it occurs at dimer resolution site (dif) of either one or both chromosomes of V. cholerae. Each dif sequence contains two recombinase-binding sequences flanking a central region. The integration follows a sequential strand exchanges between dif and attP sites within a DNA-protein complex consisting of one pair of each recombinase and two DNA fragments. During entire process of recombination, both the DNA components and recombinases of the synaptic complex keep transiently interconnected. Within the context of synaptic complex, both of the actuated enzymes mediate cleavage of phosphodiester bonds. First cleavage generates a phosphotyrosyl-linked recombinase-DNA complex at the recombinase binding sequence and free 5 ’-hydroxyl end at the first base of the central region. Following the cleavage, the exposed bases with 5 ’-hydroxyl ends of the central region of dif and attP sites melt from their complementary strands and react with the recombinase-DNA phosphotyrosyl linkage of their recombining partner. Subsequent ligation between dif and attP strands requires complementary base pair interactions {{at the site of}} phosphodiester bond formation. Integration mechanism is mostly influenced by the compatibility of dif and attP sequences. dif sites are highly conserved across bacterial phyla. Different phage genomes have different attP sequences; therefore they rely on different mechanisms for integration. Here, I review our current understanding of integration mechanisms used by the vibriophages...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Non-typhoidal Salmonella {{are one of}} the key {{etiological}} {{agents of}} diarrhoeal disease. The appearance of multiple drug resistance along with resistance to quinolones in this bacterium poses a serious therapeutic problem. We determined the prevalence of nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin resistance in non-typhoidal Salmonella isolated from faecal samples of patients with <b>acute</b> <b>diarrhoeal</b> <b>disease</b> attending the outpatient and inpatient department of a hospital in Saudi Arabia during the years 1999 to 2002. METHODS: Non-typhoidal Salmonella were isolated from faecal samples. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by the disc diffusion test. MICs to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin were determined by the agar dilution method. RESULTS: During the study period, 524 strains of non-typhoidal Salmonella were isolated. Strains belonging to serogroup C 1 were the commonest (41. 4 &#x 0025;) followed by serogroups B and D (15. 6 &#x 0025; and 14. 5 &#x 0025;, respectively). Resistance to ampicillin was observed in 22. 9 &#x 0025; and to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in 18. 5 &#x 0025; of the strains. Nalidixic acid resistance was encountered in 9. 9 &#x 0025; and ciprofloxacin resistance in 2. 3 &#x 0025; of the strains. Resistance to nalidixic acid significantly increased from 0. 1 &#x 0025; in 1999 to 5. 5 &#x 0025; in 2002 (P= 0. 0007) and ciprofloxacin resistance increased significantly from 0. 1 &#x 0025; in 1999 to 0. 9 &#x 0025; in 2002 (P= 0. 0001). MICs to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin were determined among 29 nalidixic acid-resistant strains of non-typhoidal Salmonella isolated during 2002. The MIC was > 256 microg/mL to nalidixic acid and 8 to 16 microg/mL to ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSION: The increasing rates of antimicrobial resistance encountered among non-typhoidal Salmonella necessitate the judicious use of these drugs in humans. Moreover, these findings support the concern that the use of quinolones in animal feed may lead to an increase in resistance and should be restricted...|$|E
40|$|Cholera is an <b>acute</b> form of <b>diarrhoeal</b> <b>disease</b> {{that plagued}} human civilization over the centuries. The sudden and {{explosive}} {{onset of the}} disease {{in the form of}} an outbreak or epidemic, coupled with high mortality and morbidity rates, had a tragic impact on the personal as well as social life of people living in the affected areas. The enormity of human sufferings led clinicians and scientists to carry out extensive research on cholera and Vibrio cholerae (the causative bacterium of the disease) leading to major discoveries that opened up novel areas of research or new disciplines in biomedical sciences. An attempt is made here to summarize some of these breakthroughs and outline their significance in broader perspectives. Finally, the possible impact of the global socio-political scenario on the spread of cholera epidemics (pandemicity of cholera) is briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|Summary Communicable {{diseases}} {{are of particular}} concern in conflict and disaster-affected populations that reside in camp settings. In the <b>acute</b> emergency phase, <b>diarrhoeal</b> <b>diseases</b> have {{accounted for more than}} 40 % of deaths among camp residents. Clear limitations exist in current water treatment technologies, and few products are capable of treating turbid water. We describe the findings of a 12 -week effectiveness study of point-of-use water treatment with a flocculant–disinfectant among 400 households in camps for displaced populations in Monrovia, Liberia. In intervention households, point-of-use water treatment with the flocculant–disinfectant plus improved storage reduced diarrhoea incidence by 90 % and prevalence by 83 %, when compared with control households with improved water storage alone. Among the intervention group, residual chlorine levels met or exceeded Sphere standards in 85 % (95 % CI: 83. 1 – 86. 8) of observations with a 95 % compliance rate...|$|R
40|$|Background The Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System (KHDSS) is {{the largest}} {{population}} under continuous mortality surveillance in tropical Africa. Admissions to Kilifi County Hospital, the only inpatient facility in KHDSS, {{are linked to the}} KHDSS population register creating passive morbidity surveillance. We analysed the cause-specific incidence of hospital admissions and prevalence to interpret mortality trends in the KHDSS. Methods We studied all deaths in children and adults and all childhood (under 5 years) admissions among residents of KHDSS from January 2004 to December 2013. We estimated mortality rates as the number of deaths divided by the person-years-at-risk (PYAR) of KHDSS residents during each study period. We used ecological regression analyses of observations from 15 locations in each of 10 years to estimate the association between admission rates and prevalence for major infectious diseases and child mortality rates. Results Among 2, 449, 153 PYAR in all ages, 13, 615 deaths were observed; among 450, 632 PYAR in children aged under 5 years, 3592 deaths occurred (rate 8. 2 / 1000 /y). Mortality rates in children, infants and neonates declined by approximately 53 % between 2004 and 2008 but remained stable subsequently. Mortality rates also declined for older children and young adults but not for individuals over 50 years of age. The admission rates of neonatal syndromes remained stable throughout the study period. Admission rates for severe malaria among infants (1 - 12 m) and children (1 - 4 years) declined by 93 % and 72 %, respectively, between 2004 and 2008 but remained stable subsequently. By contrast, admission rates for severe pneumonia, invasive bacterial <b>disease</b> (IBD) and <b>acute</b> <b>diarrhoeal</b> <b>diseases</b> declined steadily throughout the whole period. Examining historical data from 1994 - 6, mortality in children aged 1 - 4 years fell by 89 % over 20 years whilst malaria prevalence declined by 97 %. In ecological analyses from 2004 - 2013, childhood mortality was significantly associated with both prevalence of malaria and incidence of hospitalised malaria; under- 5 year mortality increased by 11 · 5 / 1000 PYAR for each 10 percentage points increase in the background prevalence of malaria. Conclusions Mortality rates declined precipitously in children and young adults but not in those aged over 50 years. Although admission rates for most infectious diseases in children have declined steadily throughout this period, those for malaria most closely reflect the biphasic pattern of mortality reductions. </p...|$|R
