500|$|To {{differentiate}} the storytelling {{from what the}} audience already knew, the writing staff decided to begin the pilot {{with the end of}} the typical Snow White fairytale. Themes concerning family and motherhood were emphasized, in contrast to the focus on fatherhood in Lost. Kitsis and Horowitz sought to write strong female characters, rather than the classic damsel in distress. Horowitz stated their desire to approach each character the same way, <b>asking</b> <b>themselves,</b> [...] "How do we make these icons real, make them relatable?" ...|$|E
500|$|Rucka and Lark {{developed}} {{the setting for}} Lazarus {{by looking at the}} Occupy movement and the underlying economics and <b>asking</b> <b>themselves</b> [...] "What happens if it goes horribly wrong?" [...] The main character was originally named Endeavor, but Rucka changed it to Forever to avoid a conflict with a different comic being developed at the same time about a young Inspector Morse. Her body type is based on the soccer player Hope Solo. The story's ending was planned before work began on the first issue.|$|E
500|$|Lumina was {{designed}} by Toshiyuki Itahana, who had worked on multiple titles in the Final Fantasy series. Her look {{has been described as}} a [...] "Gothic lolita" [...] style. She came about when the team were <b>asking</b> <b>themselves</b> how to portray Lightning's hidden self. Her appearance is a young version of Serah, but her inner feelings reflect Lightning's hidden emotions. Her personality and actions were made to be unpredictable, with her both aiding and hindering Lightning on her journey. In creating her childlike appearance and extravagant movements, the development team tried to make them as realistic as possible. Lumina is voiced by Jessica DiCicco in English and Kanae Ito in Japanese.|$|E

The following questions were deduced from employee comments about their office environment. These are questions the listeners implicitly <b>ask</b> <b>themselves</b> to determine their response to their environment. The design of a sound masking system must take these opinions into account.|$|R

500|$|Speed2: Cruise Control {{has been}} {{referenced}} and parodied in pop culture. A 1998 {{episode of the}} British sitcom Father Ted titled [...] "Speed3" [...] involves a bomb planted on a milk float that will explode if the float travels under [...] While the plot is a parody of Speed, writers Graham Linehan and Arthur Mathews {{got the idea for}} the episode after <b>asking</b> <b>themselves</b> if it was possible {{to come up with a}} [...] "worse idea for a sequel than Speed2." [...] The Simpsons episode [...] "Bye Bye Nerdie" [...] (2001) features a scene on a racing school bus where character Milhouse Van Houten says [...] "It's like Speed2, only with a bus instead of a boat!" [...] The Family Guy episode [...] "Blind Ambition" [...] (2005) includes a parody of the film's finale where a cruise ship crashes into a pier and through a city before stopping in the middle of an airport.|$|E
2500|$|Humble Bundle {{works with}} {{developers}} to determine scheduling {{and availability of}} games, and make decisions about which games to include within bundles, <b>asking</b> <b>themselves</b> [...] "will this be exciting for gamers", according to employee Richard Esguerra. The full arrangements with developers to create the bundle typically conclude {{a month before the}} bundle goes live. The Humble Bundle group earns about 15% of the total funds raised.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the latter}} half of his argument, he {{addressed}} the lesser-included issue. At trial, the jury had deliberated for three hours. Since Schmuck had admitted to the odometer tampering, [...] "the only thing the jury could have been out considering was is this really mail fraud. Are these mailings really sufficiently closely related to what my client was trying to do to be mail fraud?" [...] he posited them <b>asking</b> <b>themselves.</b> [...] "I think it's clear from that record that a lesser instruction on odometer tampering had at least an arguable chance of success." [...] The justices asked no questions, and Steinberg asked to reserve his remaining time for rebuttal.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the end of}} his life, he was publicizing his {{disappointment}} with the political environment of Greater Romania and explaining his return to socialism. In a Viața Basarabiei article, he claimed: [...] "Wherever I look around me I see only decay. The old and the young, the cultivated and the illiterate, all behave equally, not even <b>asking</b> <b>themselves</b> what the meaning of their life is in the general progress of humanity. Living inside Romanian society I for one was not able to merge into it. [...] I haven't had and I still don't have friends in Romania." [...] His attitude, including claims that Bessarabia was being colonized by rapacious Romanians from other provinces, outraged the nationalist newspaperman Alexandru [...] "Ion Gorun" [...] Hodoș, who wrote that Arbore was no longer sincerely interested in national unity, but rather displayed [...] "the need to detect, under any Romanian uniform, an assassin of Bessarabia's population." ...|$|E
2500|$|The girls' plan is leave Hanna {{waiting for}} 'Uber A' {{to arrive at}} Lost Woods Resort, while Aria and the boys are out hiding, but when Hanna goes missing they find out that 'Uber A' used a secret passage and kidnapped her. Looking over footage from cameras outside, they all are shocked to see what looks to be Mrs. D, <b>asking</b> <b>themselves</b> how this is possible. At Alison's house, [...] "Wilden" [...] rips off his mask {{revealing}} himself to be Elliott, and Mary Drake, who is revealed to be Jessica's twin, joins him. They succeeded in committing Alison, and with Ali hospitalized, he has her money and the house as her husband, which is their revenge {{for what happened to}} Charlotte, as {{he was in love with}} her and Mary always felt an attachment as her birth mother. She glances at a photograph of Charlotte and says it is what she would've wanted. In the last scene, we see Hanna's unconscious body being dragged by 'Uber A' in the church's bell tower.|$|E
2500|$|Several critics {{theorized that}} another {{probable}} {{factor in the}} film's box office failure was the confusion related to its title. Cyriaque Lamar of Cracked.com notes that [...] "udiences expecting mystical weirdness a la The Exorcist walked out of theaters" [...] which in turn forced distributors to put [...] "ads that Sorcerer was 'NOT A FILM ABOUT THE SUPERNATURAL'." [...] Film critic Gene Siskel thought Sorcerer was a [...] "very bad title". To him the title might have indicated a certain likeness to The Exorcist and thought the audiences {{at the time were}} either bored with yet another film about exorcisms or that was precisely what they wanted and upon seeing the movie, they got confused, <b>asking</b> <b>themselves</b> [...] "where's the devil?" [...] Siskel also thought each of the production companies would think the other one would handle the promotion, and nobody perceived it as a [...] "sole project of their own, it was dropped in-between them." [...] On the other hand, Roger Ebert expressed his disappointment about the movie's box office performance by saying that [...] "you could make more than that just by opening in the first week, people stumbling into a wrong theater looking for Bruce Lee," [...] as well as blamed Universal and Paramount for the lack of support. Friedkin stated that his attitude throughout the making of the film [...] "alienated the top management of two studios", and as a consequence they did not feel compelled to support it.|$|E

There was deadly silence in the hall, all eyes were fixed on him, and all minds were <b>asking</b> <b>themselves,</b> 'What will he say?' Girolamo was leaning forward, resting his chin on his hand, looking anxious. I wondered if he regretted that he had called the meeting.|$|E
60|$|The days {{following}} Clarence's {{visit to the}} offices of the Encore were marked by a growing feeling of unrest, alike among invaded and invaders. The first novelty and excitement of the foreign occupation of the country was beginning to wear off, and in its place the sturdy independence so typical of the British character was reasserting itself. Deep down in his heart the genuine Englishman has a rugged distaste for seeing his country invaded by a foreign army. People were <b>asking</b> <b>themselves</b> by what right these aliens had overrun British soil. An ever-growing feeling of annoyance had begun to lay hold of the nation.|$|E

The impression on the audience in general was sudden and evident: and a number of enlightened and highly educated persons, who at different times afterwards addressed me on the subject, expressed their wonder, that truth so obvious should not have struck them before; but at the same time acknowledged--(so much had they been accustomed, in reading poetry, to receive pleasure from the separate images and phrases successively, without <b>asking</b> <b>themselves</b> whether the collective meaning was sense or nonsense)--that they might in all probability have read the same passage again twenty times with undiminished admiration, and without once reflecting, that ...|$|E
60|$|But Caron {{had already}} left his side to repair {{to the spot where}} Marie was lying. The {{peasantry}} followed him, though leisurely, in their timid hesitation. They were <b>asking</b> <b>themselves</b> whether, even so remotely as by tending the girl, they dared participate in the violence La Boulaye had committed. That a swift vengeance would be the Seigneur's answer they were well assured, and a great fear possessed them that in that vengeance those of the Chateau might lack discrimination. Charlot was amongst them, and on his feet, but still too dazed to have a clear knowledge of the circumstances. Presently, however, his faculties awakening and taking in the situation, he staggered forward, and came lurching towards La Boulaye, who was assisting the frightened Marie to rise. With a great sob the girl flung herself into her husband's arms.|$|E
60|$|Men have {{constantly}} been <b>asking</b> <b>themselves</b> {{what the}} great literary precursors of the Revolution would have thought, {{and how they}} would have acted, {{if they could have}} survived to the days of the Terror.

To ask whether these famous men would have sanctioned the Terror, is to insult great memories; but {{there is no reason to}} suppose that their strong spirits would have faltered. One or two of the younger generation of the famous philosophic party did actually see the break-up of the old order. Condorcet faced the storm with a heroism of spirit that has never been surpassed: disgust at the violent excesses of bad men could never make him unfaithful to the beneficence of the movement which their frenzy distorted.|$|E
