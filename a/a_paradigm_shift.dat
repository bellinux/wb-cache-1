5|$|After a premiering out of {{competition}} at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival, U2 3D showed at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival and had its limited theatrical release in late January 2008, followed by its wide release the following month. The film was distributed by National Geographic Entertainment and was only released in IMAX 3D and digital 3D theaters. It peaked at number 19 at the United States box office, and earned over $26million worldwide, ranking {{as one of the}} highest-grossing concert films. It received widely positive reviews, with critics praising the 3D technology and innovation. U2 3D won several awards, and its reception convinced some of the creators that the project marked <b>a</b> <b>paradigm</b> <b>shift</b> in filmmaking.|$|E
5|$|The {{project has}} pioneered {{the use of}} {{graphics}} processing units (GPUs), PlayStation3s, Message Passing Interface (used for computing on multi-core processors), and some Sony Xperia smartphones for distributed computing and scientific research. The project uses statistical simulation methodology that is <b>a</b> <b>paradigm</b> <b>shift</b> from traditional computing methods. As part of the client–server model network architecture, the volunteered machines each receive pieces of a simulation (work units), complete them, and return them to the project's database servers, where the units are compiled into an overall simulation. Volunteers can track their contributions on the Folding@home website, which makes volunteers' participation competitive and encourages long-term involvement.|$|E
5|$|Buoyed by a {{recovering}} {{global economy and}} ETOPS approval, 767 sales accelerated in the mid-to-late 1980s; 1989 was the most prolific year with 132 firm orders. By the early 1990s, the wide-body twinjet had become its manufacturer's annual best-selling aircraft, despite a slight decrease due to economic recession. During this period, the 767 became the most common airliner for transatlantic flights between North America and Europe. By {{the end of the}} decade, 767s crossed the Atlantic more frequently than all other aircraft types combined. The 767 also propelled the growth of point-to-point flights which bypassed major airline hubs in favor of direct routes. Taking advantage of the aircraft's lower operating costs and smaller capacity, operators added non-stop flights to secondary population centers, thereby eliminating the need for connecting flights. The increased number of cities receiving non-stop services caused <b>a</b> <b>paradigm</b> <b>shift</b> in the airline industry as point-to-point travel gained prominence {{at the expense of the}} traditional hub-and-spoke model.|$|E

5|$|The 1989 Draft {{has been}} noted as having been {{exceptionally}} successful for Detroit. While team executive Jim Devellano stated the team would be satisfied with two players from that draft {{making it to the}} NHL, seven of them did so. Those seven players (Mike Sillinger, Bob Boughner, Lidstrom, Fedorov, Shawn McCosh, Dallas Drake and Vladimir Konstantinov) amassed 5,995 games played, 1,227 goals, 2,367 assists, 3,594 points and 5,108 penalties in minutes. That draft has also been marked as signalling <b>a</b> <b>paradigm</b> <b>shift</b> for Detroit as prior to that the club was very reluctant to draft players from outside North America. Since then the club has drafted a large number of European as well as other non-North American players. In 2000, for example, they drafted four Swedes, three Russians, two Canadians, one Slovak and one American.|$|E

25|$|The philosopher Robert Todd Carroll {{responded that}} Grinder has not {{understood}} Kuhn's {{text on the}} history and philosophy of science, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. Carroll replies: (a) individual scientists never have nor are they ever able to create paradigm shifts volitionally and Kuhn does not suggest otherwise; (b) Kuhn's text does not contain the idea that being unqualified {{in a field of}} science is a prerequisite to producing a result that necessitates <b>a</b> <b>paradigm</b> <b>shift</b> in that field and (c) The Structure of Scientific Revolutions is foremost a work of history and not an instructive text on creating paradigm shifts and such a text is not possible—extraordinary discovery is not a formulaic procedure. Carroll explains that <b>a</b> <b>paradigm</b> <b>shift</b> is not a planned activity, rather it is an outcome of scientific effort within the current (dominant) paradigm that produces data that can't be adequately accounted for within the current paradigm—hence <b>a</b> <b>paradigm</b> <b>shift,</b> i.e. the adoption of a new paradigm.|$|E
40|$|<b>A</b> {{systemic}} <b>paradigm</b> <b>shift</b> of {{any sort}} is complex and multifaceted. <b>A</b> systemic <b>paradigm</b> <b>shift</b> of justice is no different. The {{purpose of this study}} is to identify the barriers that exist in <b>a</b> systemic <b>paradigm</b> <b>shift</b> from retributive justice to restorative justice. The methodology for this study is an interpretive synthesis of literature on restorative justice and consists of primarily theoretical literature. The literature for this study came from a variety of disciplines (e. g. psychology, criminal justice, sociology, and social work) in order to obtain a holistic perspective. A tripartite analysis was conducted using three perspectives: criminal justice, social systems model, and social work. In using these three lenses, different barriers to <b>a</b> systemic <b>paradigm</b> <b>shift</b> were able to be identified. This study identified several barriers from all three perspectives that may likely impede <b>a</b> systemic <b>paradigm</b> <b>shift</b> to restorative justice. With these barriers is it possible that <b>a</b> restorative justice <b>paradigm</b> might not be able to wholly replace the criminal justice system, but rather, that it can grow to work in concert with the current criminal justice system, and infusing the criminal justice system with restorative values. This study holds the potential for social workers to focus efforts on social change, and addressing the barriers that have been identified. This research advocates for social workers to be active in political action as well as in community organizing and development. Social work, because of its mission, values, and perspectives, is in a unique position to address these barriers...|$|R

Aristotle had argued that this was presumably a fundamental property of nature: for the motion of an object to be sustained, it must continue to be pushed. Given the knowledge available at the time, this represented sensible, reasonable thinking.|$|E

25|$|Thomas Kuhn was an {{important}} philosopher and writer who worked extensively {{in the fields of}} the history of science and the philosophy of science. He is famous for writing The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, one of the most cited academic works of all time.

This transformed Toryism, away from its historic reliance on community (particularly religious) charities, and towards acceptance of a humanitarian welfare state which would guarantee a minimum living standard for those unable to work or who took out national insurance. In 1927, he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society.|$|E
