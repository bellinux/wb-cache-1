5000|$|The <b>Antillean</b> <b>crested</b> <b>hummingbird</b> (Orthorhyncus cristatus) is {{a species}} of hummingbird in the Trochilidae family.It is found in Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Montserrat, {{north-east}} Puerto Rico, Saba, Saint-Barth√©lemy, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Martin, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Sint Eustatius, the British Virgin Islands, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Lesser Antilles ...|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The IBA is an {{important}} site for <b>Antillean</b> <b>crested</b> <b>hummingbirds</b> ...|$|R
50|$|The IBA was {{identified}} as such by BirdLife International because it supports, populations of bridled quail-doves, green-throated caribs, <b>Antillean</b> <b>crested</b> <b>hummingbirds,</b> scaly-breasted thrashers, pearly-eyed thrashers, brown tremblers, forest thrushes, Montserrat orioles and Lesser Antillean bullfinches.|$|R
50|$|Avifauna in the wild, both {{native and}} {{migrating}} include brown pelican {{along the shore}} line, magnificent frigatebirds with long wingspans of up to 1.8 m, green herons, snowy egrets, belted kingfishers; bananaquits; broad-winged hawks; two species of hummingbirds, the green-throated carib and <b>Antillean</b> <b>crested</b> hummingbird; and zenaida doves.|$|R
50|$|Bird Life International has {{identified}} the reserve as an Important Bird Area (IBA) bird reserve. In the forest habitat of Basse-Terre, the IBA-identified species reported are: Least tern (Sterna antillarum), Purple-throated carib (Eulampis jugularis), Green-throated carib (Eulampis holosericeus), <b>Antillean</b> <b>crested</b> <b>hummingbird</b> (Orthorhyncus cristatus), Caribbean elaenia (Elaenia martinica), Scaly-breasted thrasher (Margarops fuscus), and Pearly-eyed thrasher (Margarops fuscatu). Ruddy turnstone (Arenaria interpres) and sandpipers are also reported.|$|E
50|$|Birds of the United States Virgin Islands include {{at minimum}} 144 species, {{including}} numerous tropical Caribbean birds, wood warblers, various seabirds and hawks. Some {{of the tropical}} species include the brown-throated parakeet, Hispaniolan parrot and three species of hummingbirds: the green-throated carib, <b>Antillean</b> <b>crested</b> <b>hummingbird</b> and Antillean mango. Raptors include four species of hawks: the fish hawk, marsh hawk, sharp-shinned hawk and red-tailed hawk, and three species of falcons, including the American kestrel, merlin and peregrine falcon, {{as well as two}} species of owls, the Puerto Rican screech owl and the short-eared owl.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} examples of plant-pollinator co-adaptation is between the heliconias Heliconia bihai and H. caribaea, and the Lesser Antillean hummingbird - the purple-throated carib Eulampis jugularis. To date, the purple-throated carib is the only reported pollinator of these heliconias on the islands of St. Lucia and Dominica. Here, we show that the pollination of H. bihai and H. caribaea in the Lesser Antilles is more complex than previously hypothesized, locally involving several hummingbird species, specifically the green-throated carib Eulampis holosericeus, rufous-breasted hermit Glands hirsuta, blue-headed hummingbird Cyanophaia bicolor, and the <b>antillean</b> <b>crested</b> <b>hummingbird</b> Orthorhyncus cristatus. Hopefully, our observations will stimulate research into whether H. bihai and H. caribaea show local co-adaptation toward hummingbird pollinators other than the purple-throated carib. This would further verify the co-adaptation hypothesis between heliconias and Lesser Antillean hummingbirds, although, depending on locality, more hummingbird species have to be added as mutualistic partners...|$|E
50|$|The fauna is {{represented}} by: spectacled bears, jaguars, (both endangered species), armadillos, parrots, opossums, howler monkeys, deer, ocelots, pumas and southern tamandua. There are birds like the <b>crested</b> curassow, <b>hummingbird,</b> great kiskadee and cardinal. One {{of the largest}} species of moth {{in the world can}} be found: the thysania agrippina, with wingspan of 30.5 cm.|$|R
40|$|There {{are four}} species of {{hummingbirds}} in Dominica: Eulampis jugularis, Sericotes holosericeus, Orthorhyncus cristatus and Cyanophaia bicolor. Hummingbirds {{are known to}} be quite territorial, often displaying aggressive behaviors. In this study, four sucrose-water feeders were hung at SCEPTRE (Springfield Centre for Environmental Protection, Teaching, Research and Education) in order to observe species, sex, feeding time, feeder number and aggressive or territorial behaviors. Some behaviors observed were chasing an opponent, vocalizing, fluttering and constantly looking around the territory. Figures and tables are included, describing feeding times for each species, location preferences, feeder distances and behaviors observed. From the figures and tables, a pattern of hierarchy was determined. The Trembler and Purple-throated Carib control the top, followed by the other larger birds, leaving the female <b>Antillean</b> <b>Crested</b> <b>hummingbird</b> at a foraging disadvantage. By the end of the observation time, a Purple-throated Carib had dominated the territory...|$|E
40|$|What is a {{bird nest}} like? Bird nests vary {{enormously}} among species in their form, size and composition. The nest of a long-tailed tit (Aegithalos caudatus) is a flexible bag composed of small-leaved mosses entangled in myriad loops of fluffy spider egg cocoon silk - a 'Velcro' fabric. For insulation, this bag {{is lined with}} as many as 2, 000 small feathers. For camouflage, the outside of the nest is covered with a few thousand small lichen flakes. At the other extreme of nest complexity is the nest of the Arctic tern (Sterna paradisea), which is often no more than a shallow depression scraped in a shingle beach. The size of nests is equally variable. An <b>Antillean</b> <b>crested</b> <b>hummingbird</b> (Orthorhyncus cristatus), at &# 8764; 2. 4 grams, may be more than twice the weight of the tiny nest cup on which it sits, while the massive platform nest of the bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) can be three metres in width and weigh up to three metric tons, about 600 times the weight of the bird itself. The composition of nesting material varies from grasses and twigs to those used by the common tailorbird (Orthotomus sutorius), which stitches together a folded-over living leaf with threads of spider silk...|$|E
