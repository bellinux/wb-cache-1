500|$|In 1993, Congress {{enacted the}} Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, {{amending}} the Gun Control Act of 1968. [...] "The Brady Law" [...] instituted federal {{background checks on}} all firearm purchasers who buy from federally licensed dealers (FFL). This law had no provisions for private firearms transactions or sales. The Brady Law originally imposed an interim measure, requiring a waiting period of 5 days before a licensed importer, manufacturer, or dealer may sell, deliver, or transfer a handgun to an unlicensed individual. The waiting period applied only in states without an <b>alternate</b> <b>system</b> that was deemed acceptable of conducting background checks on handgun purchasers. Personal transfers and sales between unlicensed Americans could also still be subject to other federal, state, and local restrictions. These interim provisions ceased to apply on November 30, 1998.|$|E

500|$|Portal was {{the first}} Valve-developed game {{to be added to}} the OS X-compatible list of games {{available}} on the launch of the Steam client for Mac on May 12, 2010, supporting Steam Play, in which players that had bought the game either on a Macintosh or Windows computer could also play it on the <b>alternate</b> <b>system.</b> As part of the promotion, Portal was offered as a free title for any Steam user during the two weeks following the Mac client's launch. Within the first week of this offer, over 1.5 million copies of the game were downloaded through Steam. A similar promotion was held in September 2011, near the start of a traditional school year, encouraging the use of the game as an educational tool for science and mathematics. Valve wrote that they felt that Portal [...] "makes physics, math, logic, spatial reasoning, probability, and problem-solving interesting, cool, and fun", a necessary feature to draw children into learning. This was tied to Digital Promise, a United States Department of Education initiative to help develop new digital tools for education, and which Valve is part of.|$|E

40|$|<b>Alternate</b> {{numeration}} <b>systems</b> {{are common}} in preservice teacher (PST) mathematics curricula, but there is limited research on how to leverage <b>alternate</b> <b>systems</b> to promote the development of mathematical knowledge for teaching. I analyzed the role of <b>alternate</b> numeration <b>systems</b> in three ways. I conducted a thematic analysis of current PST textbooks to consider the role of <b>alternate</b> numeration <b>systems</b> in written curricula. I conducted a teaching experiment to analyze PSTs 2 ̆ 7 mathematical activity as they engaged with a base five task sequence to reinvent an algorithm for multiplication. And I introduced problematizing mathematical contexts as a design heuristic, situating this within the design theory of Realistic Mathematics Education. I found that <b>alternate</b> numeration <b>systems</b> can be leveraged to create opportunities for PSTs to (a) engage in guided reinvention of an algorithm, (b) improve understanding of base ten by comparing it to other numeration systems, and (c) reflect on their learning experience and the learning experiences of children...|$|R
