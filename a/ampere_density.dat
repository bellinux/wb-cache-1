40|$|In the {{preliminary}} design process of switched reluctance machine (SRM), adjusting {{the number of}} wingding turns or cross-sectional area of conductor to optimize windings design has dramatic effects on the performances like torque density, efficiency and thermal dissipation and so on. However, the difficulty exists on how to guarantee these performances while optimizing winding design. This paper proposes an analytical optimization design method based on an regulation model of <b>ampere</b> <b>density</b> and coil space factor, which can directly determine the optimal number of winding turns, the cross-sectional area of conductor, the <b>ampere</b> <b>density</b> and the coil space factor. And a MATLAB pre-design program has been developed to provide two design schemes respectively with and without the optimization model. The comparison analysis has been further carried out with finite element analysis (FEA). The simulation results verify that the performances can be highly improved with the proposed optimization model...|$|E

50|$|The {{non-uniform}} {{current density}} {{must also be}} considered when calculating the magnetic flux <b>density.</b> <b>Ampere's</b> Law for a basic current carrying loop of wire gives that the on-axis magnetic flux is proportional to the current running through the wire and is related to the basic geometry of the loop, but is not concerned with the geometry of the cross section of the wire. The current density is uniform across the cross-sectional area of a wire. This is not the case for a Bitter disc. As such, the current term must be replaced with terms discussing the cross-sectional area of the disc and the current density. The equation for the on-axis magnetic flux density of a Bitter disc becomes much more complex as a result.|$|R
30|$|Much as it {{featured}} no bright aurora, the growth or pre-onset phase featured no consistently strong magnetic perturbations. In the hour 3 – 4 UT, the automated meridian modeling (AMM) inversion technique (Connors and Rostoker 2015) gave no meaningful results due to weak signal. Inversion results, which became meaningful after 4 : 20 UT with strengthening perturbations allowing solution, are shown {{for the period}} 4 – 6 UT in Fig. 6. The bottom panel shows in black the cross-meridian current in the Churchill line, whose amplitude AMM suggested maximized at nearly 0.7 MA. We show in red {{the results of the}} more general inversion technique automated forward modeling (AFM) in its regional variant, as applied to a set of North American stations by Connors et al. (2014), which do not exceed 0.5 MA westward. Connors and Rostoker (2015) discuss that AFM applied on a meridian with field-aligned currents in the model constrained to be very distant is similar to finding equivalent currents. On the other hand it is inferred in (Connors et al. 2014), as supported by AMPERE data, that application to a set of distributed stations gives physical parameters, i.e., the real current. We do not examine this point further here but return {{to the fact that the}} regional inversion gave a smaller current than the meridian approach. <b>AMPERE</b> current <b>density</b> data as integrated by (Connors et al. 2014) gave a value of about 0.6 MA in the SCW system, not decisively favoring either modeling result. Nevertheless, for the reasons discussed below, we feel that AMM has overestimated the current.|$|R
30|$|With the {{possibility}} of a tropospheric origin shown by computer simulation (Zettergren and Snively 2013), the field-aligned currents are caused by the propagation of acoustic gravity waves generated by tropospheric sources through the E-layer dynamo. The period of the acoustic wave is around 3.5  min, i.e., near the vertical resonance period. The order of the speed of the neutral wind at an altitude of 100  km, i.e., the E-layer, caused by the acoustic wave is 10  m/s, and the spatial scale is around 100  km. As a result, the order of the density of the field-aligned current at an altitude of 100 and 400  km is 0.1 and 0.01  μ Am− 2, respectively. On the other hand, with use of <b>Ampere's</b> law, the <b>density</b> can be estimated from the observed magnetic fluctuations. The order of the amplitude of the typical magnetic fluctuations, main magnetic field, and the latitudinal spatial scale estimated from the CHAMP observation are 1 nT, 10, 000 nT, and 100  km, respectively. Then, the order of density at the CHAMP altitude is 0.01  μ Am− 2, which is consistent with that predicted by Zettergren and Snively (2013).|$|R
30|$|The optical {{picture of}} the {{substorm}} just presented conforms generally to the interpretation in Connors et al. (2014). However, there is clearly organized auroral activity prior to the nominal onset time, much as that study suggested there was magnetic activity. Starting about 4 : 16 UT (just left of, or before, the white bar which is missing data), a band of aurora brightened and moved poleward in a very systematic manner, remaining very narrow. It moved from one keogram to the other but appeared to stall in its motion as the nominal onset time approached. Since structuring of auroras can aid in establishing onset times (as for example in Liang et al. (2008)), and this structuring is not obvious in keograms, we now inspect all-sky image sequences near the potential times of interest. Figure 5 shows RANK and GILL for the minute 04 : 12 UT, and those stations and the more easterly one KUUJ in the several minutes following 04 : 26 UT (we return to the RANK 04 : 38 UT set below). The earlier pair shows an arc which had actually formed in the 04 : 11 UT minute near GILL but was not bright enough to present. This arc {{is seen in the}} top part of the GILL images, as it brightens and structures. The RANK images are essentially devoid of aurora although some remant of faded growth phase arcs is seen below the Moon (brightest spot in lower left). There is no indication that an auroral streamer from the north initiated the activity near GILL, as Nishimura et al. (2010) found to sometimes be the case. Although there are lunar reflections (in the optical system including the dome housing the camera) present in the images, the arc visible from GILL formed clearly in the 04 : 11 UT minute equatorward of the growth phase arcs, much in the fashion described by Akasofu (1964). As discussed, after a small amount of initial equatorward motion, it brightened and rapidly moved northward. However, the auroras did not become extremely active, nor did magnetic field perturbations as reflected by indices or any individual station records, until near the nominal onset time of Connors et al. (2014). As discussed in the “Introduction” section, there seems to be considerable overlap in the literature in the descriptions of pseudobreakups and full expansive phase onsets (especially in cases of “double onset”). We tend to regard this weak event as a pseudobreakup. The initiation of full onset seems to be indicated by the formation of a new arc between two pre-existing ones shown in the KUUJ 04 : 26 panel of Fig. 5. This arc structured and moved toward the east (right) rapidly within the 04 : 26 UT minute as seen from KUUJ. In the next minute, the arc which had developed out of the pseudobreakup brightened in the northern sky of GILL and also as seen on the southern horizon from RANK. The KUUJ and RANK/GILL images do not overlap, so we cannot determine the exact relation of the arc at KUUJ to the pre-existing one further west. As the keograms of Fig. 4 indicate, a very full expansion of aurora was observed after this time, and a strengthening of electric currents leading to perturbations large enough that (as also indicated by <b>AMPERE</b> current <b>density</b> integrations) Connors et al. (2014) identified 04 : 30 UT as the nominal onset time. We now proceed to examine ground magnetic fields for the event, both with a meridian inversion technique and as individual magnetograms.|$|R
