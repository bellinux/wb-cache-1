5|$|In {{addition}} to the above, blood samples are usually taken to measure urea and creatinine (measures of kidney function, which may be impaired in DKA {{as a result of}} dehydration) and electrolytes. Furthermore, markers of infection (complete blood count, C-reactive protein) and acute pancreatitis (<b>amylase</b> and lipase) may be measured. Given the need to exclude infection, chest radiography and urinalysis are usually performed.|$|E
5|$|The Andes in South America has Chicha, {{made from}} germinated maize (corn); while the {{indigenous}} peoples in Brazil have Cauim, a traditional beverage made since pre-Columbian times by chewing manioc so that an enzyme (<b>amylase)</b> present in human saliva can break down the starch into fermentable sugars; {{this is similar to}} Masato in Peru.|$|E
5|$|However, {{vegetables}} often {{also contain}} toxins and antinutrients which {{interfere with the}} absorption of nutrients. These include α-solanine, α-chaconine, enzyme inhibitors (of cholinesterase, protease, <b>amylase,</b> etc.), cyanide and cyanide precursors, oxalic acid, and others. These toxins are natural defenses, used {{to ward off the}} insects, predators and fungi that might attack the plant. Some beans contain phytohaemagglutinin, and cassava roots contain cyanogenic glycoside as do bamboo shoots. These toxins can be deactivated by adequate cooking. Green potatoes contain glycoalkaloids and should be avoided.|$|E
5|$|Maltose {{is formed}} during the {{germination}} of certain grains, {{the most notable}} being barley, which is converted into malt, {{the source of the}} sugar's name. A molecule of maltose is formed by the combination of two molecules of glucose. It is less sweet than glucose, fructose or sucrose. It is formed in the body during the digestion of starch by the enzyme <b>amylase</b> and is itself broken down during digestion by the enzyme maltase.|$|E
5|$|One synonym, Iridomyrmex greensladei, was {{described}} as a separate species from the meat ant based on the anatomical differences of its head and pronotum (the dorsal portion of the prothorax's exoskeletal plates), which are the same colour as its mesosoma. In the meat ant, the head and pronotum are usually lighter than the mesosoma. American entomologist Steve Shattuck notes that the two ants are non-sympatric (they exist in the same geographic area and regularly encounter each other), and supporting evidence to separate them as two distinct species emerged when the enzymes esterase and <b>amylase</b> were examined and the results show that they had different <b>amylase</b> allele. These examinations, however, did not take any account of any distinction in colour between populations previously known as I. greensladei and I. purpureus. For example, colonies residing in Western Australia may have lighter heads whereas those living in the eastern states have darker heads. An unpublished study examining the mitochondrial DNA did not find any distinction between eastern and western populations of I. greensladei and I. purpureus. Additional evidence suggests that the populations found in the east and west are the same species. Despite this evidence, there are several problems: forms intended to be I. greensladei were found in the Yorke Peninsula by a 1987 study, which noted that while the ants were morphologically indistinguishable from both I. greensladei and I. purpureus populations, their nests only contained a single nest hole (whereas I. purpureus nests have many). Shattuck also collected workers for his holotype and paratype specimens from Israelite Bay in Western Australia, rather than collecting those from Yorke Peninsula. The forms in Yorke Peninsula have also never been subject to study, so future research may shed light {{as to whether or not}} these ants are genetically different from the meat ant.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} members of the genus, these leaf blades are densely covered by peduncular (stalked) {{mucilaginous}} glands and sessile (flat) digestive glands. The peduncular glands consist of a few secretory cells on top of a single-celled stalk. These cells produce a mucilaginous secretion which forms visible droplets across the leaf surface. This wet appearance probably helps lure prey in search of water; a similar phenomenon is observed in the sundews. The droplets secrete only limited enzymes and serve mainly to entrap insects. On contact with an insect, the peduncular glands release additional mucilage from special reservoir cells located at the base of their stalks. The insect struggles, triggering more glands and encasing itself in mucilage. P. moranensis can bend its leaf edges slightly by thigmotropism, bringing additional glands into contact with the trapped insect. The sessile glands, which lie flat on the leaf surface, serve to digest the insect prey. Once the prey is entrapped by the peduncular glands and digestion begins, the initial flow of nitrogen triggers enzyme release by the sessile glands. These enzymes, which include <b>amylase,</b> esterase, phosphatase, protease, and ribonuclease break down the digestible components of the insect body. These fluids are then absorbed back into the leaf surface through cuticular holes, leaving only the chitin exoskeleton of the larger insects on the leaf surface.|$|E
25|$|Reasons for false {{positive}} elevated serum <b>amylase</b> include salivary gland disease (elevated salivary <b>amylase),</b> bowel obstruction, infarction, cholecystitis, and a perforated ulcer.|$|E
25|$|In {{molecular}} biology, {{the presence}} of <b>amylase</b> can serve as an additional method of selecting for successful integration of a reporter construct in addition to antibiotic resistance. As reporter genes are flanked by homologous regions of the structural gene for <b>amylase,</b> successful integration will disrupt the <b>amylase</b> gene and prevent starch degradation, which is easily detectable through iodine staining.|$|E
25|$|Factory {{workers who}} work with <b>amylase</b> {{for any of the}} above uses are at {{increased}} risk of occupational asthma. Five to nine percent of bakers have a positive skin test, and a fourth to a third of bakers with breathing problems are hypersensitive to <b>amylase.</b>|$|E
25|$|Carbohydrates are a {{food source}} rich in energy. Following the {{agricultural}} revolution 12,000 years ago, human diet began to {{rely more on}} plant and animal domestication in place of hunting and gathering. This shift also symbolizes {{the beginning of a}} diet composed of 49% carbohydrates as opposed to the previous 35% observed in Paleolithic humans. As such, starch became a staple of human diet. Large polymers such as starch are partially hydrolyzed in the mouth by the enzyme <b>amylase</b> before being cleaved further into sugars. Therefore, humans that contained <b>amylase</b> in the saliva would benefit from increased ability to digest starch more efficiently and in higher quantities. Despite the obvious benefits, early humans did not possess salivary <b>amylase,</b> a trend that is also seen in evolutionary relatives of the human, such as chimpanzees and bonobos, who possess either one or no copies of the gene responsible for producing salivary <b>amylase.</b> This gene, AMY1, originated in the pancreas. A duplication event of the AMY1 gene allowed it to evolve salivary specificity, leading to the production of <b>amylase</b> in the saliva. In addition the same event occurred independently in rodents, emphasizing the importance of salivary <b>amylase</b> in organisms that consume relatively large amounts of starch.|$|E
25|$|To produce ethanol from starchy {{materials}} such as cereal grains, the starch must first be converted into sugars. In brewing beer, this has traditionally been accomplished by allowing the grain to germinate, or malt, which produces the enzyme <b>amylase.</b> When the malted grain is mashed, the <b>amylase</b> converts the remaining starches into sugars.|$|E
25|$|Most, {{but not all}} {{individual}} studies {{support the}} superiority of the lipase. In one large study, there were no patients with pancreatitis who had an elevated <b>amylase</b> with a normal lipase. Another study found that the <b>amylase</b> could add diagnostic value to the lipase, but only if the results of the two tests were combined with a discriminant function equation.|$|E
25|$|Bacilliary <b>amylase</b> is {{also used}} in {{clothing}} and dishwasher detergents to dissolve starches from fabrics and dishes.|$|E
25|$|When {{used as a}} food additive, <b>amylase</b> has E number E1100, and may {{be derived}} from swine {{pancreas}} or mould mushroom.|$|E
25|$|If the lipase {{level is}} about 2.5 to 3 {{times that of}} <b>amylase,</b> it is an {{indication}} of pancreatitis due to alcohol.|$|E
25|$|Serum <b>amylase</b> may {{be normal}} (in 10% of cases) for cases of acute or chronic {{pancreatitis}} (depleted acinar cell mass) and hypertriglyceridemia.|$|E
25|$|<b>Amylase</b> is {{an enzyme}} in saliva that is {{responsible}} for the breakdown of starch into monosaccharides, and one type of <b>amylase</b> is encoded by the alpha-amylase gene (AMY1). The AMY1 locus, as well as the <b>amylase</b> enzyme, {{is one of the most}} extensively studied and sequenced gene in the human genome. Its homologs are also found in other primates and therefore it is likely that the primate AMY1 gene is ancestral to the human AMY1 gene and was adapted early in primate evolution. AMY1 is a particularly interesting gene to examine as it is one of the most well studied genes which has wide range of variable numbers of copies throughout different human populations. The AMY1 gene is also one of the few genes that had been studied that displayed convincing evidence which correlates its protein function to its copy number. Copy number is known to alter transcription as well as translation levels of a particular gene, however research has shown that the relationship between protein levels and copy number is variable. In the AMY1 genes of European Americans it is found that the concentration of salivary <b>amylase</b> is closely correlated to the copy number of the AMY1 gene. As a result, it was hypothesized that the copy number of the AMY1 gene is closely correlated with its protein function, which is to digest starch.|$|E
25|$|Baker's allergy has a ω-gliadin {{component}} and thioredoxin hB component. In addition, a gluten-extrinsic allergen {{has been}} identified as aspergillus <b>amylase,</b> added to flour to increase its baking properties.|$|E
25|$|Elevated serum <b>amylase</b> and lipase levels, in {{combination}} with severe abdominal pain, often trigger the initial diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. However, they have no role in assessing disease severity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Amylase</b> and lipase are 2 enzymes {{produced}} by the pancreas. Elevations in lipase are generally considered a better indicator for pancreatitis as it has greater specificity and has a longer half life.|$|E
25|$|<b>Amylase</b> {{also has}} medical {{applications}} {{in the use of}} Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy (PERT). It is one of the components in Sollpura (Liprotamase) to help in the breakdown of carbohydrates into simple sugars.|$|E
25|$|A high <b>amylase</b> level (twice the {{serum level}} or the {{absolute}} value is greater than 160 Somogy units) in the pleural fluid is indicative of either acute or chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic pseudocyst that has dissected or ruptured into the pleural space, cancer or esophageal rupture.|$|E
25|$|A {{perforation}} of the pancreas, {{which may}} lead to the secretion of digestive enzymes such as lipase and <b>amylase</b> into the abdominal cavity as well as subsequent pancreatic self-digestion and digestion and damage to organs within the abdomen, generally requires prompt and experienced medical intervention.|$|E
25|$|The {{salivary glands}} in mammals are exocrine glands, glands with ducts, that produce saliva, which is {{composed}} of several components including <b>amylase,</b> a digestive enzyme that breaks down starch into maltose and glucose. In humans and some other mammals the secretion is alpha-amylase, also known as ptyalin.|$|E
25|$|Dietary fiber {{interacts with}} {{pancreatic}} and enteric enzymes and their substrates. Human pancreatic enzyme activity is reduced when incubated with most fiber sources. Fiber may affect <b>amylase</b> activity {{and hence the}} rate of hydrolysis of starch. The more viscous polysaccharides extend the mouth-to-cecum transit time; guar, tragacanth and pectin being slower than wheat bran.|$|E
25|$|Bowel {{obstruction}} {{may occur}} {{in up to}} 0.2 per 1000 per year. A worm may block the ampulla of Vater, or go into the main pancreatic duct, resulting in acute pancreatitis with raised serum levels of <b>amylase</b> and lipase. Occasionally, a worm can travel through the billiary tree and even into the gallbladder, causing acute cholangitis or acute cholecystitis.|$|E
25|$|The {{pancreas}} secretes substances which {{help in the}} digestion of starch and other carbohydrates, proteins and fats. Proteases, the enzymes involved in the digestion of proteins, include trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen. The enzyme involved in the digestion of fats is lipase. <b>Amylase,</b> also secreted by the pancreas, breaks down starch (amylum) and other carbohydrates. The pancreas also secretes phospholipase A2, lysophospholipase, and cholesterol esterase.|$|E
25|$|Digestion is {{a complex}} process {{controlled}} by several factors. pH {{plays a crucial role}} in a normally functioning digestive tract. In the mouth, pharynx and esophagus, pH is typically about 6.8, very weakly acidic. Saliva controls pH in this region of the digestive tract. Salivary <b>amylase</b> is contained in saliva and starts the breakdown of carbohydrates into monosaccharides. Most digestive enzymes are sensitive to pH and will denature in a high or low pH environment.|$|E
25|$|A {{physical}} examination confirms {{the presence of}} the swollen glands. Usually, the disease is diagnosed on clinical grounds, and no confirmatory laboratory testing is needed. If there is uncertainty about the diagnosis, a test of saliva or blood may be carried out; a newer diagnostic confirmation, using real-time nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology, has also been developed. As with any inflammation of the salivary glands, the serum level of the enzyme <b>amylase</b> is often elevated.|$|E
25|$|In pancreatitis, enzymes of the exocrine {{pancreas}} {{damage the}} structure and tissue of the pancreas. Detection {{of some of these}} enzymes, such as <b>amylase</b> and lipase in the blood, along with symptoms and findings on X-ray, are often used to indicate that a person has pancreatitis. A person with pancreatitis is also at risk of shock. Pancreatitis is often managed medically with analgesics, removal of gallstones or treatment of other causes, and monitoring to ensure a patient does not develop shock.|$|E
25|$|While some {{articles}} {{have suggested that}} homeopathic solutions of high dilution can have statistically significant effects on organic processes including the growth of grain, histamine release by leukocytes, and enzyme reactions, such evidence is disputed since attempts to replicate them have failed. (mercurius corrosivus) affect the activity of diastase and <b>amylase?</b> |journal=Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine |volume=12 |pages=359–65 |year=2006 |doi=10.1089/acm.2006.12.359 |issue=4}} A 2007 systematic review of high-dilution experiments found {{that none of the}} experiments with positive results could be reproduced by all investigators.|$|E
25|$|Digestive enzyme {{supplements}} may {{significantly reduce}} the amount of flatulence caused by some components of foods not being digested by the body and thereby promoting the action of microbes in the small and large intestines. It has been suggested that alpha-galactosidase enzymes, which can digest certain complex sugars, are effective in reducing the volume and frequency of flatus. The enzymes alpha-galactosidase, lactase, <b>amylase,</b> lipase, protease, cellulase, glucoamylase, invertase, malt diastase, pectinase, and bromelain are available, either individually or in combination blends, in commercial products.|$|E
25|$|In {{the human}} {{digestive}} system, food enters {{the mouth and}} mechanical digestion of the food starts {{by the action of}} mastication (chewing), a form of mechanical digestion, and the wetting contact of saliva. Saliva, a liquid secreted by the salivary glands, contains salivary <b>amylase,</b> an enzyme which starts the digestion of starch in the food; the saliva also contains mucus, which lubricates the food, and hydrogen carbonate, which provides the ideal conditions of pH (alkaline) for <b>amylase</b> to work. After undergoing mastication and starch digestion, the food will be {{in the form of a}} small, round slurry mass called a bolus. It will then travel down the esophagus and into the stomach by the action of peristalsis. Gastric juice in the stomach starts protein digestion. Gastric juice mainly contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin. As these two chemicals may damage the stomach wall, mucus is secreted by the stomach, providing a slimy layer that acts as a shield against the damaging effects of the chemicals. At the same time protein digestion is occurring, mechanical mixing occurs by peristalsis, which is waves of muscular contractions that move along the stomach wall. This allows the mass of food to further mix with the digestive enzymes.|$|E
25|$|The {{salivary glands}} of some species however, are {{modified}} to produce proteins; salivary <b>amylase</b> {{is found in}} many, {{but by no means}} all, bird and mammal species (including humans, as noted above). Furthermore, the venom glands of venomous snakes (colloquially called poisonous snakes), Gila monsters, and some shrews, are modified salivary glands. In other organisms such as insects, salivary glands are often used to produce biologically important proteins like silk or glues, and fly salivary glands contain polytene chromosomes that have been useful in genetic research.|$|E
25|$|Tests used to {{investigate}} for gallbladder disease include blood tests and medical imaging. A {{full blood count}} may reveal an increased white cell count suggestive of inflammation or infection. Tests such as bilirubin and liver function tests may reveal if there is inflammation linked to the biliary tree or gallbladder, and whether this is associated with inflammation of the liver, and a lipase or <b>amylase</b> may be elvated if there is pancreatitis. Bilirubin may rise when there is obstruction {{of the flow of}} bile. A CA 19-9 level may be taken {{to investigate}} for cholangiocarcinoma.|$|E
25|$|Pancreatic {{disease may}} present {{with or without}} {{symptoms}}. When symptoms occur, such as in acute pancreatitis, a person may suffer from acute-onset, severe mid-abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. In severe cases, pancreatitis may lead to rapid blood loss and systemic inflammatory response syndrome. When the pancreas is unable to secrete digestive enzymes, such as with a pancreatic cancer occluding the pancreatic duct, result in jaundice. Pancreatic disease might be investigated using abdominal x-rays, MRCP or ERCP, CT scans, and through blood tests such as measurement of the <b>amylase</b> and lipase enzymes.|$|E
