5|$|Reactive {{attachment}} disorder {{first made}} its appearance in standard nosologies of psychological disorders in DSM-III, 1980, following {{an accumulation of}} evidence on institutionalized children. The criteria included a requirement of onset {{before the age of}} 8 months and was equated with failure to thrive. Both these features were dropped in DSM-III-R, 1987. Instead, onset was changed to being within the first 5 years of life and the disorder itself was divided into two subcategories, inhibited and disinhibited. These changes resulted from further research on maltreated and institutionalized children and remain in the current version, DSM-IV, 1994, and its 2000 text revision, DSM-IV-TR, as well as in ICD-10, 1992. Both nosologies focus on young children who <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> at increased risk for subsequent disorders but are already exhibiting clinical disturbance.|$|E
5|$|The {{first part}} of the title {{indicates}} that the ‘stories’ <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> fictitious but have a factual basis in domestic, quotidian life, though readers would understand ‘from real life’ to mean ‘based on’ or ‘adapted from real ‘life’, and not necessarily ‘representation of actual events’. The ‘stories’ are ‘original’ because narratives for children should start afresh in order to avoid continued ideological contamination from vulgar chapbooks or courtly ‘fairy tales’. The phrase ‘real life’ strengthens ‘original’, excluding both the artificial and the fictional or imaginary. ‘Conversations’ suggests familiar, familial discourse rather than formal moralising. ‘Calculated’ suggests a programme rationally determined. These ‘conversations’ and ‘stories’ are also to construct the youthful self in a particular way, by regulating ‘the affections’ or emotional self and forming ‘the mind’ or rational and moral self ‘to truth and goodness’ – understood in terms of professional middle-class culture.|$|E
5|$|In Reformed theology, sacraments {{are held}} to be, along with the word of God preached, the means of grace. In the sacraments, God graciously condescends to use common {{material}} objects to communicate divine promises to people. The grace promised consists not only in benefits which God bestows on people, but Christ's person himself, to whom God unites the believer. Sacraments confirm or ratify the promises communicated in preaching. Both preaching and the sacraments <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> symbolic and representative of the reality to which they refer, but actually create the reality of saving grace. The sacraments are made efficacious by the Holy Spirit in actually bringing into effect the promises signified in the sacraments. This efficacy is only beneficial, however, {{for those who have}} faith. The sacrament remains efficacious regardless of the recipient's response. Its effect is negative, resulting in judgement, for the faithless; while it confers Christ and his benefits for the faithful.|$|E

25|$|Systems of {{classification}} {{such as this}} one are primarily of value to malacologists (people who study mollusks) and other biologists. Biological classification schemes <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> a convenience, they are an attempt to show the actual phylogeny (the evolutionary relatedness) within a group of organisms. Thus a taxonomy {{such as this one}} can be seen as an attempt to elucidate part of the tree of life, a phylogenetic tree.|$|E
25|$|These {{differences}} <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> external, but a core {{aspect of}} military life. Children of enlisted personnel often believe that children of officers receive specialized treatment because non-officers {{are afraid to}} upset the officers. The physical separation and differences between available activities make it very difficult. Most military brats {{on a personal level}} do not let this affect their social interactions, and in most cases it is frowned upon to treat others by their parent's pay grade or rank.|$|E

25|$|Counting {{has been}} {{considered}} an ability that shows intelligence. Anecdotal evidence from the '60s has suggested that crows may count up to 3. Researchers however need to be cautious and ensure that birds <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> demonstrating the ability to subitize, or count {{a small number of}} items quickly. Some studies, such as one done at Moscow State University, have suggested that crows may indeed have a true numerical ability. It has been shown that parrots can count up to 6.|$|E
25|$|The {{morphology}} and kinematics of lenticular galaxies each, to a degree, {{suggest a}} mode of galaxy formation. Their disk-like, possibly dusty, appearance suggests they come from faded spiral galaxies, whose arm features disappeared. Alternatively, as lenticular galaxies {{are likely to be}} more luminous than spiral galaxies, which suggests that they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> the faded remnants of spiral galaxies. Rather, lenticular galaxies might result from galaxy merger, which increase the total stellar mass and give the newly merged galaxy its disk-like, arm-less appearance.|$|E
25|$|As {{distinct}} from instars (the life cycle stages separated by metamorphosis), only one particular type within an instar has been graphed {{at this stage}} - gravid females. It is probable that further separation of types will become possible with additional survey and observation, for example it appears that at certain times in spring and summer adult males greatly outnumber females, in proportions as high as five to one. These and other indications need further checking {{to ensure that they}} <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> coincidences.|$|E

25|$|In Zachman’s opinion, {{the single}} factor that makes his {{framework}} unique {{is that each}} element on either axis of the matrix is explicitly distinguishable {{from all the other}} elements on that axis. The representations in each cell of the matrix <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> successive levels of increasing detail, but actually are different representations — different in context, meaning, motivation, and use. Because each of the elements on either axis is explicitly different from the others, it is possible to define precisely what belongs in each cell.|$|E
25|$|Malhotra {{summarizes}} his {{rationale for}} treating Dharmic traditions as a family, contrasting {{the family of}} Dharmic traditions with Abrahamic religions. He constructs their differences from this 'Dharmic perspective,' thereby 'reversing the gaze.' Malhotra clarifies {{that he is not}} replacing a West-centric view with a Dharma-centric view by proposing the reversal of gaze. Malhotra explains that he seeks a dialogue, where the world civilizations <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> seen from the viewpoint of the West, but the west is also seen from a non-western, c.q. 'dharmic' point of view.|$|E
25|$|In certain jurisdictions {{it is or}} {{has been}} held that hyperlinks <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> {{references}} or citations, but are devices for copying web pages. In the Netherlands, Karin Spaink was initially convicted in this way of copyright infringement by linking, although this ruling was overturned in 2003. The courts that advocate this view see the mere publication of a hyperlink that connects to illegal material to be an illegal act in itself, regardless of whether referencing illegal material is illegal. In 2004, Josephine Ho was acquitted of 'hyperlinks that corrupt traditional values' in Taiwan.|$|E

25|$|The metaphysical and cosmological {{significance}} of marriage within Islam – particularly within Sufism or Islamic mysticism – {{is difficult to}} overstate. The relationship and interplay {{between male and female}} is viewed as nothing less than that between heaven (represented by the husband) and earth (symbolised by the wife). Because of her beauty and virtue, the earth is eminently lovable: heaven marries her not simply out of duty, but for pleasure and joy. Marriage and sexual intercourse <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> human phenomena, but the universal power of productivity found within every level of existence: sex within marriage is the supreme instance of witnessing God in the full splendour of His self-disclosure.|$|E
25|$|Using US definitions, {{a person}} who owns street name {{securities}} and {{who is not a}} member of an exchange, holds the securities through a registration chain which involves one or more custodians. This is due to the perceived impracticality of registering traded securities in the name of each individual holder; instead, the custodian or custodians are registered as the holders and hold the securities in a fiduciary arrangement for the ultimate security holders. However, the ultimate security holders are still the legal owners of the securities. They <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> beneficiaries of the custodian as a trustee. The custodian does not become at any point the owner of the securities, but is only a part of the registration chain linking the owners to the securities.|$|E
25|$|Roquentin's {{difficulties}} as {{arising from}} man's inherent existential condition. His seemingly special circumstances (returning from travel, reclusiveness), which {{goes beyond the}} mere indication of his very real depression, are supposed to induce in him (and in the reader) a state that makes one more receptive to noticing an existential situation that everyone has, but may not be sensitive enough to let become noticeable. Roquentin undergoes a strange metaphysical experience that estranges him from the world. His problems <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> a result of personal insanity, without larger significance. Rather, like {{the characters in the}} Dostoevsky and Rilke novels, they are victims of larger ideological, social, and existential forces that have brought them to the brink of insanity. Sartre's point in Nausea is to comment on our universal reaction to these common external problems.|$|E

25|$|Insect fossils <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> impressions, {{but also}} appear {{in many other}} forms; While wings are indeed a common insect fossil, they do not readily decay or digest, which is why birds and spiders {{typically}} leave the wings after devouring the rest of an insect. Terrestrial vertebrates are almost always preserved just as bony remains (or inorganic casts thereof), the original bone usually having {{been replaced by the}} mineral apatite. Occasionally, mummified or frozen vertebrates are found, but their age is usually no more than several thousand years. Fossils of insects, in contrast, are preserved as three-dimensional, permineralized, and charcoalified replicas; and as inclusions in amber and even within some minerals. There is also abundant fossil evidence for the behavior of extinct insects, including feeding damage on fossil vegetation and in wood, fecal pellets, and nests in fossil soils. Dinosaur behavior, by contrast, is recorded mostly as footprints and coprolites.|$|E
25|$|Psychoanalysis, a psychotherapeutic {{approach}} to behavior change developed by Sigmund Freud and modified by his followers, has also offered {{an explanation of}} substance abuse. This orientation suggests {{the main cause of}} the addiction syndrome is the unconscious need to entertain and to enact various kinds of homosexual and perverse fantasies, {{and at the same time}} to avoid taking responsibility for this. It is hypothesised specific drugs facilitate specific fantasies and using drugs is considered to be a displacement from, and a concomitant of, the compulsion to masturbate while entertaining homosexual and perverse fantasies. The addiction syndrome is also hypothesised to be associated with life trajectories that have occurred within the context of traumatogenic processes, the phases of which include social, cultural and political factors, encapsulation, traumatophilia, and masturbation as a form of self-soothing. Such an approach lies in stark contrast to the approaches of social cognitive theory to addiction—and indeed, to behavior in general—which holds human beings regulate and control their own environmental and cognitive environments, and <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>merely</b> driven by internal, driving impulses. Additionally, homosexual content is not implicated as a necessary feature in addiction.|$|E

They are also said to be able to bring about illness and curse the possessions, crops, and livestock of ones that they hate, and as a result of being considered taboo by the other families, it has led to societal problems.|$|E
