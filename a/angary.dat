5000|$|These {{articles}} seem {{to sanction}} {{the right of}} <b>angary</b> against neutral property, while limiting it as against both belligerent and neutral property. It may be considered, however, {{that the right to}} use implies as wide a range of contingencies as the [...] "necessity of war" [...] can be made to cover.|$|E

50|$|On 20 March 1918, Zaanland {{was seized}} at Newport News, Virginia, by the United States Government {{under the right}} of <b>angary,</b> which allowed a belligerent power to use the {{property}} of a neutral nation if necessary, subject to full indemnification.

5000|$|During World War I, {{which began}} in 1914 and ended in 1918, the Netherlands was a neutral power. This meant that Dutch ships {{could not be used}} to support either side in the conflict. When the United States entered the war on 6 April 1917, the {{pressure}} increased on the Netherlands to allow their ships to be used, but they were {{not in a position to}} do this without risking German retaliation. Finally, on 20 and 21 March 1918, the U.S. and the British simply seized all the Dutch ships in their ports and justified it with the legal concept of the right of <b>angary.</b> A total of 135 Dutch ships were seized including Pollux and two of her sister ships: Clio and Mercurius.|$|E
