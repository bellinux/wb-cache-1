5|$|<b>Alex</b> <b>was</b> born on July 18, 1992. She {{grew up in}} Oakland, California, {{with her}} parents Michael and Sita. Her father was an {{alcoholic}} and physically abusive towards his wife. When <b>Alex</b> <b>was</b> in her pre-teenage years, Michael was killed during a violent episode against Sita. The police declined to press charges, unaware that <b>Alex</b> <b>was</b> responsible for Michael's death. <b>Alex</b> <b>was</b> then sent to live with Sita's family in Mumbai, India. Alex returned to the United States, where she enrolled at the FBI Academy in 2015. Unknown to the Bureau, Alex had discovered that {{her father was a}} former FBI agent and had applied to learn more about his past. Alex kept her activities a secret from Sita, telling her mother that she was starting graduate school. A stuffed bear wearing a UC Berkeley sweater can be seen on her desk in the fifteenth episode of the first season, suggesting that she may have attended the University of California, Berkeley, prior to enrolling at Quantico.|$|E
5|$|Alex {{marked the}} fifth-latest start to a {{hurricane}} season since 1954. The latest start to a hurricane season since 1954 was Hurricane Anita of the 1977 season, forming on August 29. Alex {{is only the}} second hurricane on record to have reached Category3 strength north of 38°N latitude. The other storm was Hurricane Ellen in the 1973 Atlantic hurricane season; <b>Alex</b> <b>was</b> the stronger of the two. It is also one of only five hurricanes to be at major hurricane (Category 3 or higher) status within Canadian waters since 1950.|$|E
5|$|<b>Alex</b> <b>was</b> {{the first}} Atlantic {{hurricane}} {{in the month}} of June since Hurricane Allison in 1995, and the strongest in terms of wind speed since Hurricane Alma in 1966. Its barometric pressure recording of 946 mbar (27.96inches) is the most intense from any Atlantic hurricane in June, although Hurricane Audrey in 1957 ties this intensity. Alex is thus tied for the most intense June Atlantic hurricane on record overall. However, as Audrey's pressure was estimated, Audrey's actual pressure might be as low as 925 mbar.|$|E
50|$|At the Camporee, <b>Alex</b> {{claims he}} <b>is</b> the Den Mother. Dina disapproves, even though <b>Alex</b> <b>is</b> legally their Den Brother and is {{eligible}} for her troops to be in Camporee, but Dina explained that <b>Alex</b> needs to <b>be</b> in Bumblebee uniform to attend. Matisse helped him out with that problem. <b>Alex</b> <b>is</b> in full Bumblebee Uniform and his troop can attend Camporee. Dina is mad and that <b>Alex</b> <b>is</b> making a mockery about Camporee, but her husband (the hockey official who originally suspended <b>Alex),</b> <b>is</b> pleased with his attitude and offers him {{a spot on the}} All-Stars. Alex accepts as long as it works around his troop's schedule.|$|R
5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of the novel, <b>Alex</b> <b>is</b> a 15-year-old juvenile delinquent. In the film, to minimise controversy, <b>Alex</b> <b>is</b> portrayed as somewhat older, around 17 or 18.|$|R
50|$|Paul Freeman as Alex Goldsmythe: A {{friend with}} whom Jack Quinn is reunited after {{arriving}} at the Colony and who Jack had previously thought dead, <b>Alex</b> <b>is</b> Jack's 'guardian'. Jack's welfare and performance <b>is</b> <b>Alex's</b> responsibility and <b>Alex</b> <b>is</b> involved with tracking Jack once he escapes the island.|$|R
5|$|When <b>Alex</b> <b>was</b> still located {{over the}} Yucatán Peninsula, the NHC remarked upon the {{potential}} for significant strengthening. Because of low wind shear and very warm water temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, the possibility existed that Alex could intensify into a major hurricanea Category3 storm on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scalebefore its next landfall. Early on June28, thunderstorm activity had reformed over the center, and the depression re-intensified into a tropical storm. For the next day, the combination of dry air, increasing wind shear and slightly cooler water temperatures prevented significant convection from developing over the center. At the same time, <b>Alex</b> <b>was</b> moving slowly off the northwest coast of the Yucatán Peninsula, and the environment's conditions became more favorable for intensification as the tropical storm tracked away from the coast. The circulation envelope of Alex remained very large, and by June29, the storm's rainbands covered the entire western half of the Gulf of Mexico; rainfall was reported along the Texas and Louisiana coasts, even while the center was still several hundred miles offshore. The tropical storm continued to strengthen, and based on reports from Hurricane Hunters, {{it is estimated that}} Alex attained hurricane status at 0300UTC on June30, about 255miles (415km) southeast of Brownsville, Texas.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane <b>Alex</b> <b>was</b> a rare June {{hurricane}} and {{the first}} tropical cyclone to develop in the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season. Originating from an area of disturbed weather on June25, 2010, it slowly developed in the western Caribbean Sea and struck Belize as a strong tropical storm. After entering the Gulf of Mexico, Alex became very large and encountered conditions favorable for gradual development. Early on June30, the cyclone attained hurricane status as it approached northeastern Mexico, the first June hurricane in the Atlantic basin since Hurricane Allison in 1995, and the storm rapidly intensified just {{off the coast of}} Tamaulipas. Alex came ashore near Soto la Marina as a Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.|$|E
5|$|Sayid {{escapes from}} Rousseau's bunker {{while she is}} gone, {{grabbing}} a rifle, maps and notes she has made about the island. Rousseau finds him {{and they have a}} standoff; he tries to fire the rifle, but no bullet discharges. Rousseau says she removed the firing pin, and Robert, her former lover, made the same mistake before she killed him. She reveals that it was she who killed her team, aiming to stop the disease from reaching the outside world. Sayid talks Rousseau into letting him go, but, before leaving, asks about Alex. Rousseau says that <b>Alex</b> <b>was</b> her child. While trying to find his way back to camp, Sayid hears the whispering of which Rousseau had spoken.|$|E
50|$|<b>Alex</b> <b>is</b> one of Nathan and Simon’s enemies. He is {{considered}} to be the school bully. Not much <b>is</b> said about <b>Alex’s</b> appearance but Nathan often refers to him as looking like an ‘ape’ or a ‘monkey’. <b>Alex</b> <b>is</b> not the smartest kid on the block. This is seen when Nathan makes fun of him saying “his brain is rolling around in his head”. Although <b>Alex</b> <b>is</b> a bully, when Simon died he was sensitive to Nathan.|$|R

5|$|Substantial {{structural}} changes {{took place on}} January12: frontal boundaries separated from {{the core of the}} cyclone; convection developed atop the circulation; and it acquired a weak warm-core. All these factors, alongside the system being co-located with an upper-level low, indicated its transition into a subtropical cyclone by 18:00UTC. Upon doing so, the system received the name Alex. Though relatively shallow, owing to the seasonally low level of the tropopause, convection was deemed deep enough for classification. At this time, the subtropical storm was situated 1,150mi (1,850km) west-southwest of the Canary Islands. The trough that previously enabled the sharp southward turn later steered Alex to the east-northeast and later north-northeast. Operationally, <b>Alex</b> <b>was</b> not classified as a subtropical storm until late on January13.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane <b>Alex</b> <b>was</b> {{the first}} Atlantic {{hurricane}} in January since Hurricane Alice in 1955, {{and the first}} to form in the month since 1938. The first tropical cyclone of the 2016 Atlantic hurricane season, Alex originated as an extratropical cyclone near the Bahamas on January7, 2016. The system initially traveled northeast, passing Bermuda on January8, before turning southeast. It subsequently deepened and acquired hurricane-force winds by January10. Slight weakening took place thereafter, and the system eventually turned east and northeast as it acquired tropical characteristics. On January12, it developed into a subtropical cyclone well south of the Azores, becoming the first tropical or subtropical system during January in the North Atlantic since an unnamed storm in 1978. As it turned north-northeast, Alex transitioned into a full-fledged tropical cyclone on January14 and became a hurricane. The storm peaked as a Category1 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale with maximum sustained winds of 85mph (140km/h) and a barometric pressure of 981mbar (hPa; 28.97inHg). After weakening slightly, Alex made landfall on Terceira Island as a tropical storm the next day. Concurrently, Alex began transitioning back into an extratropical cyclone; it completed this cycle hours after moving away from the Azores. The system ultimately merged with another extratropical cyclone over the Labrador Sea on January17.|$|E
5|$|The {{focal point}} of the series, <b>Alex</b> <b>was</b> {{introduced}} as a recruit at the FBI Academy, Quantico, Virginia. Alex eventually became an FBI field agent and later the prime suspect for a terrorist attack on Grand Central Terminal. Despite clearing her name, she was fired from the Bureau and went on to join the CIA, where she was later named a fugitive for releasing classified U.S. intelligence to the public. The series focuses on her struggle to keep her country safe, while juggling her career and maintaining her on and off relationship with boyfriend Ryan Booth and her friendship with her best friend Shelby Wyatt. Originally conceived as a white character, Alex's characterization changed significantly following Chopra's casting, which came {{as a result of a}} talent holding deal ABC Studios had with the actress. Chopra had said that she saw this role as an opportunity to represent South Asians and break Indian stereotypes in Hollywood and the United States.|$|E

5|$|When the First World War {{began in}} 1914, both of Gardiner's {{brothers}} enlisted and were sent overseas. Gardiner's father John also enlisted, but he died May 30, 1916 {{before he was}} sent overseas. Both his brothers returned home after the war ended; while <b>Alex</b> <b>was</b> unharmed, John {{had been involved in}} a poison gas attack, and was seriously ill. To help provide for the family Gardiner began working for the J.H. Ashdown Hardware Company at the age of twelve. In December 1928 John began to develop an illness {{as a result of his}} poison gas attack in the war, and died December 13. Edith had planned to get married on December 31, but wanted to delay the marriage because of John's death, though her family convinced her to continue with the original plan. Gardiner married Myrtle Brooks August 6, 1927 at Grace United Church in Winnipeg. Their first son, Robert Roy, was born May 20, 1929. They also had a girl on May 7, 1931, but she died the same day.|$|E
25|$|Alex (1976– 6 September 2007) was an African {{grey parrot}} {{and the subject}} of a thirty-year (1977–2007) {{experiment}} by animal psychologist Irene Pepperberg, initially at the University of Arizona and later at Harvard University and Brandeis University. When <b>Alex</b> <b>was</b> about one year old, Pepperberg bought him at a pet shop. The name <b>Alex</b> <b>was</b> a backronym for avian language experiment, or avian learning experiment.|$|E

Alex concludes that Robert is the baby's father.|$|E
25|$|Evidence that birds {{can form}} {{abstract}} {{concepts such as}} same v. different has been provided by Alex, the African grey parrot. <b>Alex</b> <b>was</b> trained by animal psychologist Irene Pepperberg to vocally label more than 100 objects of different colors and shapes and which are made from different materials. Alex could also request or refuse these objects ('I want X') and quantify numbers of them.|$|E
25|$|Claire, {{hoping to}} speed up Alex's {{negotiations}} for a rug, complained about being tired and wanting {{to return to the}} hotel, to pressure the seller into dropping the price faster. This idea backfired, as <b>Alex</b> <b>was</b> forced to buy it when the price was frozen instead. Sir Alan indicated that had Renaissance lost the task by a narrower margin, he would have fired Claire for this, while later stating that, despite his single mistake with the unbranded tajines, Alex had done far better {{than the rest of the}} team.|$|E
