50|$|Godzilla Game was a {{board game}} {{released}} by Mattel in 1978. Between two and four people could play. Each player controlled six spaceships. One player's spaceships <b>were</b> all green, <b>another's</b> <b>were</b> all yellow, <b>another's</b> <b>were</b> all orange, and <b>another's</b> <b>were</b> all magenta. Occasionally Godzilla would appear and eat {{one of the}} spaceships. The last player to have a spaceship left would be the winner.|$|R

5|$|Separate {{from the}} series, a sketch {{was made for}} Comic Relief and {{screened}} on 11 March 2005. <b>Another</b> <b>was</b> performed live at The Secret Policeman's Ball on 14 October 2006.|$|E
5|$|After later {{studies were}} {{conducted}} with {{a larger number of}} birds, the advisories were revised and <b>another</b> <b>was</b> added for cinnamon teal. Seven other species of duck were studied and found to have levels of mercury below EPA guidelines, thus being determined safe to eat.|$|E
5|$|Aided by {{the monsoon}} trough, the outer rainbands of Typhoon Ruby brought an {{extended}} period of heavy rains across eastern Taiwan. According to press reports, one person was killed and <b>another</b> <b>was</b> initially reported as missing. River levels rose drastically, which led to flooding along low-lying areas. High seas associated with the outer rainbands of the storm were responsible for $9.89million in destruction to the Fujian Province.|$|E

50|$|Decision {{boundaries}} {{are not always}} clear cut. That is, the transition from one class in the feature space to <b>another</b> <b>is</b> not discontinuous, but gradual. This effect is common in fuzzy logic based classification algorithms, where membership in one class or <b>another</b> <b>is</b> ambiguous.|$|R
5|$|All told, sixteen people {{pleaded guilty}} for crimes {{committed}} at the company, and five others, including four former Merrill Lynch employees, were found guilty. Eight former Enron executives testified—the main witness being Fastow—against Lay and Skilling, his former bosses. <b>Another</b> <b>was</b> Kenneth Rice, {{the former chief}} of Enron Corp.'s high-speed Internet unit, who cooperated and whose testimony helped convict Skilling and Lay. In June 2007, he received a 27-month sentence.|$|E
5|$|Arias' {{maternal}} {{family was}} from Nicaragua, having left during political upheaval there before his birth. One of Arias' great uncles {{ran for president}} in Panama, while <b>another</b> <b>was</b> {{a supporter of the}} Nicaraguan revolutionary Sandino, a family history that gave Arias an early interest in politics. His father, an engineer, died when Arias was two years old, and he was raised primarily by his mother, aunt, and grandmother. His mother later remarried to a Panamanian ambassador to the United States.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act, Alyeska was {{required}} to remove most traces of the 31 pipeline construction camps. Seven camps closed in November 1976, and six more closed before the 1977 construction season started. All told, 20 camps went up for sale. One was sold to the University of Alaska {{for use as a}}n Arctic research facility, while <b>another</b> <b>was</b> converted for use as a truck stop and motel.|$|E

5|$|At Copán in Honduras, another {{important}} Maya site, archaeologists found a potbelly sculpture {{on top of}} the Northwest Platform, {{to the west of the}} Great Plaza. <b>Another</b> <b>was</b> found in a cache under Stela 4. Further potbelly monuments have been found in caches under Late Classic stelae in the Great Plaza itself and throughout the Copán valley.|$|E
5|$|Basset's {{rewards for}} his royal service {{included}} {{a number of}} manors. Basset was granted the manor of Mixbury by the king, after the family that held {{it at the time}} of Domesday Book died out and it escheated to the king. Other lands held by Basset were probably royal rewards also. One was Quiddenham, which had been held in 1086 by crown. <b>Another</b> <b>was</b> Stoney Stanton, originally held in 1086 by Robert Despenser.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, Herbert Chapman, wanting {{his players}} {{to be more}} {{distinctly}} dressed, updated the kit, adding white sleeves and changing the shade to a brighter pillar box red. Two possibilities have been suggested for {{the origin of the}} white sleeves. One story reports that Chapman noticed a supporter in the stands wearing a red sleeveless sweater over a white shirt; <b>another</b> <b>was</b> that he was inspired by a similar outfit worn by the cartoonist Tom Webster, with whom Chapman played golf.|$|E
5000|$|The {{apparent}} claim (Aramaic primacy) that Matthew {{wrote in}} Hebrew—which in Greek could refer to either Hebrew or Aramaic—is echoed by many other ancient authorities. Modern scholars have proposed numerous explanations for this assertion, {{in light of}} the prevalent view that canonical Matthew was composed in Greek and not translated from Semitic. One theory is that Matthew himself produced firstly a Semitic work and secondly a recension of that work in Greek. <b>Another</b> <b>is</b> that others translated Matthew into Greek rather freely. <b>Another</b> <b>is</b> that Papias simply means [...] "Ἑβραίδι διαλέκτῳ" [...] as a Hebrew style of Greek. <b>Another</b> <b>is</b> that Papias refers to a distinct work now lost, perhaps a sayings collection like Q or the so-called Gospel according to the Hebrews. Yet <b>another</b> <b>is</b> that Papias was simply mistaken.|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} forces shape {{the way in}} which {{software}} evolves. One is a desire to make programs as general as possible. <b>Another</b> <b>is</b> to push configuration decisions out into the data. Yet <b>another</b> <b>is</b> to push them out onto the users. Still <b>another</b> <b>is</b> to defer such decisions until runtime. The patterns herein explore how complexity migrates from the code to the data as systems mature. As data become more sophisticated, the power that can, in turn, be brought to bear upon them at runtime increases.

5|$|In {{protest of}} the decision, {{multiple}} photographs of We Are Our Mountains were displayed during {{the presentation of}} voting results from Armenia; one was displayed on a video screen at Yerevan's Republic Square in the background, and <b>another</b> <b>was</b> displayed {{on the back of}} a clipboard that the presenter Sirusho was reading results from. Despite the controversy, 1,065 Armenians voted for the Azerbaijani entry, enough to give the country a single point. A total of 43 Azerbaijanis voted for the Armenian entry.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} years, more towers were {{built around the}} islands. The first group, the Wignacourt towers, were built between 1610 and 1620. Six of these were built, and they were more than just watchtowers as they formed significant strongpoints intended to protect vulnerable sections of the coast from attack. Of the six towers, one collapsed in around 1715 and <b>another</b> <b>was</b> demolished in 1888. The other four towers survive to this day.|$|E
5|$|Not {{including}} the attacker, nine {{people were killed}} and six others were seriously wounded in the attack. Seven of the dead were Americans working for the CIA.

5|$|Numerous bridges {{have been}} built over Toby Creek. One was built in 1920 and {{repaired}} in 1989. <b>Another</b> <b>was</b> built in 1928 and repaired in 1963 and a third was built in 1939. Six bridges were built over the creek in 1941, {{all of them in}} Kingston Township or Dallas Township. Another bridge was built over Toby Creek in 1955 and four more were built in 1963, one of which was repaired in 1988. One was built in 1970 and repaired in 1980 and <b>another</b> <b>was</b> built in 1976 and repaired in 1997. Two more bridges were built across the creek in 1980, one more in 1984, and one in 1989.|$|E
5|$|On 15 September 1881, a {{light engine}} and a coal train {{collided}} {{near the mouth}} of Copenhagen Tunnel north of the station because of a signalman's error. One person was killed and <b>another</b> <b>was</b> severely injured. Bad weather contributed to flooding in the tunnels. One such incident in July 1901 suspended all traffic from the station for more than four hours, which happened at no other London terminus.|$|E
5|$|On October 24, 2014, the {{cafeteria}} of Marysville Pilchuck High School {{was the site}} of a school shooting, in which five students (including the perpetrator) were killed and <b>another</b> <b>was</b> left seriously injured.
