500|$|The austere {{settings}} {{in the game}} came about because testers {{spent too much time}} trying to complete the puzzles using decorative but non-functional elements. As a result, the setting was minimized to make the usable aspects of the puzzle easier to spot, using the clinical feel of the setting in the film The Island as reference. While there were plans for a third area, an office space, to be included after the test chambers and the maintenance areas, the team ran out of time to include it. They also dropped the introduction of the Rat Man, a character who left the messages in the maintenance areas, to avoid creating too much narrative for the game, though the character was developed further in a tie-in comic [...] "Lab Rat", that ties Portal and Portal 2s story together. According to project lead Kim Swift, the final battle with GLaDOS went through many iterations, including having the player chased by James Bond lasers, which was partially applied to the turrets, Portal Kombat where the player would have needed to redirect rockets while avoiding turret fire, and a chase sequence following a fleeing GLaDOS. Eventually, they found that playtesters enjoyed a rather simple puzzle with a countdown timer near the end; Swift noted, [...] "Time pressure makes people think something is <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>complicated</b> than it really is", and Wolpaw admitted, [...] "It was really cheap to make [...] " [...] in order to simplify the dialogue during the battle.|$|E

Understanding a simple model in detail teaches us <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> about <b>more</b> <b>complicated</b> models in generic situations. Five years ago, C. Vafa and I {{found that the}} closed N = 2 string theory, that is a string theory with the N = 2 local supersymmetry on the worldsheet, is classically equivalent to the self-dual Einstein gravity in four spacetime dimensions. Thus this string theory is solvable at the classical level. More recently, we have examined the N = 2 string partition function for spacial compactifications, and computed it to all order in the string perturbation expansion. The fact that such computation is possible at all suggests that the N = 2 string theory is solvable even quantum mechanically...|$|R

50|$|Gun-mortars are hybrid weapons, the {{archetype}} {{being the}} Brandt Mle CM60A1 and Brandt 60 mm LR, which combine features of modern infantry mortars together {{with those of}} modern cannon. Such weapons are smoothbore, firing fin stabilised rounds, using relatively small propellant charges in comparison to projectile weight, they have short barrels in comparison to guns and are much more lightly built than guns of a similar calibre-all characteristics of infantry mortars. However, they also have gun like features, such as vehicle mountings (or mounting on a gun carriage) together with sighting systems that allows direct fire, breech loading and recuperation; some such as the 2B9 Vasilek are autoloading. This produces a weapon capable of engaging area targets with indirect high angle fire, and also specific targets such as vehicles and bunkers with direct fire. Such hybrids are <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> heavier and <b>more</b> <b>complicated</b> than infantry mortars, superior to rocket propelled grenades in the anti armour and bunker busting role, but have a reduced range compared to modern gun-howitzers and inferior anti-tank capability compared to modern anti tank guided weapons. However, {{they do have a}} niche in, for example, providing a multi-role anti-personnel, anti-armour capability in light mobile formations.|$|R

2500|$|Scorpion {{is often}} {{regarded}} as one of the most popular and iconic characters in the Mortal Kombat franchise, and in the fighting-game genre in general. Game Informer rated Scorpion the third-best fighting game character in 2009, while UGO Networks ranked Scorpion second only to the series' main protagonist Liu Kang in their 2012 list of the top fifty characters in the franchise. Scorpion was rated the third-best ninja character in video games by Cheat Code Central in 2011, and PLAY similarly ranked him fourth on their own list in 2013. Lucas Sullivan of GamesRadar ranked him as the seventh-best fighting game character in the genre's history, stating, [...] "Scorpion has some tough competition in the MK franchise, but none come close to the sheer coolness of his 'undead antagonist' factor. Despite the fact that he started out as a mere palette swap, Scorpion’s appeal made him a frontrunner in every major MK game to date."

50|$|Many of Leonora's {{family members}} and friends {{expressed}} great concern in relation to her decision of going off to such a far away country as Brazil - a place where she did not even know the language! Many of them believed that she was taking a very dangerous risk, by traveling alone without knowing anyone in Brazil. However, her desire to teach the Bahá'í Faith was so great, that on February 1, 1921 she arrived in the port of Rio de Janeiro. At that time she was only 25 years old and she did not know anyone in that country. The fact that she was a woman and single, in a time that women had less rights and freedom, made her situation <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>complicated</b> but she still managed to stay in Brazil. Leonora got her first job in a very simple office through a young theosophist in the city of Santos, São Paulo.

Sometimes when she could, Leonora would participate as a speaker in the national conferences - her first year in Rio de Janeiro, she participated in the National Congress of Esperanto which extended to São Paulo and Santos and later to many other capitals of Brazil.|$|E

Having grown into a righteous young man of considerable martial skill, Yuan sets out on his own. He discovers the hideout of a long-dead martial arts master known as Golden Snake Xia Xueyi and lays claim to his buried martial arts manual, sword, and collection of darts. He also discovers the whereabouts of a lost treasure and instructions to deliver a portion of it to a certain woman. Cheng-chih sets out to find her in order to honor the dead man's wishes and ends up meeting a spoiled and not-so-cleverly disguised young woman posing as a man named Wen Qingqing. It's enough to fool the naive Yuan Chengzhi, who befriends Wen after she takes a liking to him. She brings him into her household, which is home to a wealthy clan of martial artists known for their mastery of the Five Element Array. Yuan's stay grows unsettling, first when jealous quarreling sparked by his presence erupts between Wen and her cousin. Things get <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> <b>complicated</b> when a trio of angry martial artists storm the household and accuse Wen of theft.

As hidden truths about the Wen clan and their dark part are revealed through flashbacks, Yuan finds himself forced to fight their infamous Five Element Array in order to complete his quest and escape in one piece.|$|E
