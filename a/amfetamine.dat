40|$|Stimulants used {{to treat}} attention-deficit/hyperactivity {{disorder}} (ADHD) have been well researched, but comparisons among stimulants are hindered {{by the absence of}} direct comparative trials. The goal of this work was to compare the efficacy of methylphenidate and <b>amfetamine</b> formulations through a meta-analysis of double-blind placebo-controlled trials. We analyzed recent published literature on the stimulant therapy of ADHD to describe the variability of drug-placebo effect sizes. A literature search was conducted to identify double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of ADHD in children and adolescents published after 1979. Meta-analysis regression assessed the influence of medication type and study design features on medication effects. Twenty-three trials met criteria and were included in this meta-analysis. These trials studied 11 drugs using 19 different outcome measures of hyperactive, inattentive, or impulsive behavior. We found significant differences between <b>amfetamine</b> and methylphenidate products, even after correcting for study design features that might have confounded the results. Our analyses indicate that effect sizes for <b>amfetamine</b> products are significantly, albeit moderately, greater than those for methylphenidate. We found that most measures of effect from all studies were statistically significant. Our findings suggest that <b>amfetamine</b> products may be moderately more efficacious than methylphenidate products, even after controlling for potentially confounding study design features. This difference in effect size may be due to differences between <b>amfetamine</b> and methylphenidate in the molecular mechanisms involved in facilitating the dopaminergic neurotransmission...|$|E
40|$|A {{feasibility}} {{study has been}} undertaken to assess the suitability of a commercially available SERS substrate {{for use in a}} roadside screening device for detection of drugs (RSDD) in oral fluid. Considerations include; sensitivity, reproducibility and optimum experimental sampling conditions. Data was collected for five decreasing concentrations of aqueous <b>amfetamine</b> sulfate, at two laser wavelengths. Results showed that at 785 nm the lowest reliably detectable concentration of <b>amfetamine</b> sulfate was 1 x 10 - 5 M, whilst for 633 nm it was 1 x 10 - 4 M. The draft type approval specification document [1] which details the lower limit of detection (LLD) for potential RSDD’s gives a LLD of 1 x 10 - 7 M for <b>amfetamine</b> sulfate. The commercially available substrate does not meet the LLD, and also shows high background variability, both of which indicate that this SERS substrate is not suitable for application in a RSDD at this time...|$|E

25|$|It {{is also a}} {{moderate}} inhibitor of CYP2D6 and also a substrate for CYP2D6 and hence can inhibit its own metabolism. It can also inhibit the clearance of CYP2D6 substrates such as dextromethorphan and hence also potentiate their effects. Other drugs like codeine and tamoxifen which require CYP2D6-mediated activation into their respective active metabolites may have their therapeutic effects attenuated. Likewise CYP2D6 inhibitors such as paroxetine or fluoxetine can reduce chlorpromazine clearance and hence increase serum levels of chlorpromazine and hence potentially also its adverse effects. Chlorpromazine also reduces phenytoin levels and increases valproic acid levels. It also reduces propranolol clearance and antagonises the therapeutic effects of antidiabetic agents, levodopa (a Parkinson's medication. This is likely {{due to the fact}} that chlorpromazine antagonises the D2 receptor which is one of the receptors dopamine, a levodopa metabolite, activates), <b>amfetamines</b> and anticoagulants. It may also interact with anticholinergic drugs such as orphenadrine to produce hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar).|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Central {{nervous system}} (CNS) stimulants {{may be used}} to reduce {{tiredness}} and increase alertness, competitiveness, and aggression. They {{are more likely to be}} used in competition but may be used during training to increase the intensity of the training session. There are several potential dangers involving their misuse in contact sports. This paper reviews the three main CNS stimulants, ephedrine, <b>amfetamine,</b> and cocaine, in relation to misuse in sport. METHODS: Description of the pharmacology, actions, and side effects of <b>amfetamine,</b> cocaine, and ephedrine. RESULTS: CNS stimulants have psychotropic effects that may be perceived to be ergogenic. Some are prescription drugs, such as Ephedra alkaloids, and there are issues regarding their appropriate therapeutic use. Recently attention has been given to their widespread use by athletes, despite the lack of evidence regarding any ergogenic or real performance benefit, and their potentially serious side effects. Recreational drugs, some of which are illegal (cocaine, amfetamines), are commonly used by athletes and cause potential ergolytic effects. Overall, these drugs are important for their frequent use and mention in anti-doping laboratories statistics and the media, and their potentially serious adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: Doping with CNS stimulants is a real public health problem and all sports authorities should participate in its prevention. Dissemination of information is essential to prevent doping in sport and to provide alternatives. Adequate training and education in this domain should be introduced...|$|E

40|$|Context: Recreational drug {{toxicity}} is frequent. Availability of new psychoactive substances is steadily increasing. However, data with verified analyses from clinical settings are limited. To evaluate {{the impact of}} novel psychoactive substances (NPS) on recreational {{drug toxicity}} in Oslo, Norway, we analysed samples from a selection of patients. Methods: All the patients presenting with recreational drug toxicity at the Oslo Accident and Emergency Outpatient Clinic (OAEOC) and at the Oslo University Hospital (OUH) were registered from April through September 2014. Oral fluid samples were collected at the OAEOC. Blood samples were collected at the OUH. The samples were screened using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography – tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). Results: Nine hundred and sixty-four cases were included, 841 (87. 2 %) at the OAEOC and 123 (12. 8 %) at the OUH. A total of 55 oral fluid samples (OAEOC) and 103 blood samples (OUH) could be analysed. NPS were not clinically suspected {{in any of the}} screened cases. At the outpatient clinic, the most commonly found substances were clonazepam in 42 / 55 (76. 4 %) cases, <b>amfetamines</b> in 40 / 55 (72. 7 %) and heroin in 39 / 55 (70. 9 %). In seven (12. 7 %) cases NPS were detected: 4 -methylamfetamine in three cases, dimethyltryptamine in two, methylone in one, and N,N-dimethyl- 3, 4 -methylenedioxyamfetamine in one. Among the hospital patients, the most commonly found substances were clonazepam in 51 / 103 (49. 5 %) cases, <b>amfetamines</b> in 48 / 103 (46. 6 %), heroin in 31 / 103 (30. 1 %), and diazepam in 30 / 103 (29. 1 %). In five (4. 9 %) cases NPS were detected: JWH- 210 in two cases, AM- 2201 in two, and 5 -EAPB in one. Conclusion: NPS were clinically not suspected, though found in eight percent of cases. Still, the vast majority of patients treated for recreational drug toxicity in Oslo have taken classical drugs. Management of these patients should be based on their clinical condition. However, it is highly important to be alert to atypical presentations possibly resulting from unsuspected drugs.

40|$|Original article can {{be found}} at : [URL] Copyright Russell Publishing Ltd. [Due to {{publisher}} restrictions full text of this article is not available in the UHRA]Designer drugs represent a rapidly expanding phenomenon particularly facilitated by their Internet availability. These drugs are continuously emerging as analogues of controlled substances (<b>amfetamine,</b> aminoindane, cathinone, phencyclidine, etc [...] .) and once an analogue has been banned; another replacement analogue appears on the market. They are often made in unlicensed laboratories which can result in their poor quality. This highlights the importance of analysing these products through detecting both their identity and purity. However, most of the analysis methods focused on emerging analogues of cathinone and very few studied other newer analogues such as phencyclidine derivatives. This is due partly to the regulations surrounding the analysis, the time consuming analytical procedures and the technical skills involved. Analysis of these designer drugs in the literature included both the identification of drug products and monitoring of products consistency over a period of time. In all cases, the results showed that these products may contain a range of a single or mixture of components including: a designer drug, a pharmaceutical active agent, an excipient or inorganic material...|$|E
40|$|Objective: As {{dopamine}} functioning {{varies by}} sex and age {{it might be}} expected {{that the effects of}} methylphenidate or <b>amfetamine,</b> the psychostimulants used for the treatment of Attention Deficit /Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), will also be moderated by these factors. Here we review the published literature on whether stimulant effects in ADHD symptoms vary by age and sex. Method: We searched for studies published from 1989 until October 2009. Databases searched included U. S. National Library of Medicine (PubMed), Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO and ISI Web of Knowledge. Firstly, we reviewed the effects of stimulant drugs on male and female patients and also patients of pre-school, middle childhood, adolescence and adulthood. Secondly, we reviewed studies that directly tested the moderating effect of age and sex on stimulant treatment outcome. Results: Randomised controlled trials confirm that stimulant medication is efficacious for, and well tolerated by, males and females and patients across the age range; although preschoolers appear to have a less beneficial response and more side effects. Few studies that specifically examined the moderating effect of age and/or sex were identified. For sex, no effects on overall response were found, although one study reported that sex moderated methylphenidate pharmacodynamics. The few effects found for age were small and inconsistent. Conclusions: The available evidence suggests that stimulant medication, when appropriately administered, has efficacy as an ADHD treatment for both sexes and across all ages. There are currently too few published papers examining the effects of sex and age to draw strong conclusions about moderation. Further studies of the pharmacodynamics of stimulants on symptoms measured using objective tests in the laboratory or classroom setting need to be undertaken...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a single method to analyse drugs in hair and to apply this to case samples {{received}} from The Security Forces Hospital, Saudi Arabia. First of all, mass fragments and retention times for amfetamines and cannabinoids were identified by GC-MS using derivatization agents, PFPA/ethyl acetate (2 : 1 v/v) and PFPA / PFPOH (1 : 0. 75 v/v) for amphetamines and cannabinoids, respectively. The results showed good peak shape, good chromatographic resolution and good sensitivity for <b>amfetamine</b> (AF), methamphetamine (MA), 3, 4 -Methylenedioxyamfetamine (MDA), 3, 4 -Methylenedioxymethamfetamine (MDMA), 3, 4 -Methylenedioxyethylamfetamine (MDEA), Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ 9 -THC) and 11 -nor- 9 -carbody- Δ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ 9 -THC-COOH) compounds. The comparison of the efficiency of four different pre-treatment methods (enzymatic, alkaline, acid and methanol) to extract AF, MA, MDA, MDMA, MDEA, Δ 9 THC and Δ 9 -THC-COOH from hair samples obtained from known amfetamines and cannabinoid abusers was investigated. The preliminary results demonstrated difficulty with the cannabinoids recovery and the lower concentration of standards were not detected using any of the pre-treatment methods. As a result of the poor cannabinoids recovery, only the amfetamines were investigated. For the comparison study, only one hair sample positive for amphetamine was available so the pre-treatment comparison study was based on the recovery of AF using the four pre-treatment methods. The positive hair sample was separated into portions and pre-treatment methods, alkaline (1 M NaOH), β-Glucuronidase (helix pomatia), methanol (MeOH) and acid (0. 1 M HCI) were used on these and compared. The best recovery for amphetamine was obtained using the β-glucuronidase pre-treatment method and this extract was also found to be cleaner than the alkaline and methanol pre-treatments. Β-glucuronidase pre-treatment was selected as the method of choice for the extraction of amphetamine content in hair. The method was validated to include linearity, recovery, intra- and inter-day precision, limit of quantitation (LOQ) and limit of detection (LOD) for all five amphetamine compounds. The method was shown to be reliable and robust for these substances. The stability of AF in hair was investigated to assess the validity of analysing hair samples for the presence of AF in victims of drowning. Ten amphetamine positive hair samples were submerged in fresh and sea water for different periods of time. The drug concentrations in the samples were monitored over a period of 8 weeks. Hair samples were analysed using the validated method. The results showed a significant decrease of amphetamine in hair with the time submerged in sea water. Fresh water had a much less significant effect over the study period. The validated method was successfully applied to 16 case samples obtained for living volunteers with a known history of fenethylline (AF precursor) abuse and 6 post-mortem case samples where amfetamines had been detected in the post-mortem blood.
