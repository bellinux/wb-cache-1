Busch also uses dactyls, where one <b>accented</b> <b>syllable</b> {{is followed by}} two unaccented syllables, as in his Plisch und Plum, where they underline the pedantic and solemn words with which teacher Bokelmann educates his pupils. They create tension in the Sourdough chapter from Adventures of a Bachelor, through the alternation of trochees and dactyls. Busch often synchronizes format and content in his poems, as in Fips the Monkey, where he uses the epic hexameter in a speech about wisdom.|$|E

25|$|Thus, monosyllabics {{generally}} have falling tone, whilst polysyllabics {{generally have}} falling or rising tone {{on the first}} syllable, and rising in all the other syllables but the last one.

5000|$|On <b>accented</b> <b>syllables,</b> {{the acute}} {{came to be}} {{accompanied}} by a distinct pitch contour in late Proto-Balto-Slavic. Consequently, <b>accented</b> <b>syllables</b> of any type that could carry the acute register in Proto-Balto-Slavic (listed above) now differed in pitch contour as well as articulation; they had rising or falling pitch (whether <b>accented</b> acute <b>syllables</b> had rising or falling pitch differed by dialect).

25|$|In this region, {{the acute}} accent is more intense {{and has a}} higher pitch; the {{threshold}} of pitch between the <b>accented</b> <b>syllable</b> and the following syllable nucleus is larger, (56Hz versus 51Hz), {{and the length of}} the nuclei of the syllables is shorter (rýte, where y = 394 ms and e = 163 ms versus rỹte where y = 433 ms and e = 194 ms). Vowels with an acute are significantly shorter and less intense that vowels with a circumflex (rýte, where y length = 190 ms and e length = 102 ms versus rỹte where y length = 286 ms and e length = 80 ms).|$|E
2500|$|The acute {{accent was}} first used in the polytonic orthography of Ancient Greek, where it {{indicated}} a syllable with a high pitch.

2500|$|A long-running {{controversy}} has surrounded the correct spelling, pronunciation, and etymology of the woman's name, however, linguists working on Hidatsa since the 1870s have always considered the name's Hidatsa etymology essentially indisputable. The {{name is a}} compound of two common Hidatsa nouns, cagáàga [...] 'bird' and míà [...] 'woman'. The compound is written as Cagáàgawia 'Bird Woman' in modern Hidatsa orthography, and pronounced [...] ( [...] is pronounced [...] between vowels in Hidatsa). The double [...] in the name indicates a long vowel and the diacritics a falling pitch pattern. Hidatsa is a pitch-accent language {{that does not have}} stress, therefore, in the Hidatsa pronunciation all syllables in [...] are pronounced with roughly the same relative emphasis, however, most English speakers perceive the <b>accented</b> <b>syllable</b> (the long [...] ) as stressed. In faithful rendering of the name Cagáàgawia to other languages, it is advisable to emphasize the second, long syllable, not the last, as is common in English.|$|E
50|$|When perceiving <b>accented</b> <b>syllables</b> in English, Japanese nonnative {{speakers}} of English tend to rely only on F0, or {{pitch of the}} <b>accented</b> <b>syllables,</b> while native speakers use F0, duration, and amplitude (Beckman, 1986).

2500|$|British {{descriptions}} of English intonation {{can be traced}} back to the 16th century. Early in the 20th century the dominant approach in the description of English and French intonation was based on a small number of basic [...] "tunes" [...] associated with intonation units: in a typical description, Tune 1 is falling, with final fall, while Tune 2 has a final rise. Phoneticians such as H.E. Palmer broke up the intonation of such units into smaller components, the most important of which was the nucleus, which corresponds to the main <b>accented</b> <b>syllable</b> of the intonation unit, usually in the last lexical word of the intonation unit. Each nucleus carries one of a small number of nuclear tones, usually including fall, rise, fall-rise, rise-fall, and possibly others. The nucleus may be preceded by a head containing stressed syllables preceding the nucleus, and a tail consisting of syllables following the nucleus within the tone unit. Unstressed syllables preceding the head (if present) or nucleus (if there is no head) constitute a pre-head. This approach was further developed by Halliday and by O'Connor and Arnold, though with considerable variation in terminology. This [...] "Standard British" [...] treatment of intonation in its present-day form is explained in detail by Wells and in a simplified version by Roach. Halliday saw the functions of intonation as depending on choices in three main variables: Tonality (division of speech into intonation units), Tonicity (the placement of the tonic syllable or nucleus) and Tone (choice of nuclear tone); these terms (sometimes referred to as [...] "the three T's") have been used more recently.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} {{the influence of}} focal condition, sentence mode and phrase boundary location {{on the most important}} prosodic features of German, syllable duration and F 0 contour. A small corpus uttered by a single speaker was auditorily segmented and the F 0 contours modeled using a quantitative model decomposing the contour into a sequence of tone switches. The correlation of these tone switches with changes of the <b>accent</b> <b>syllable</b> durations was examined. It was found that narrow focusing of an item boosts the tone switch at its word <b>accent</b> <b>syllable</b> whereas significant lengthening of this syllable was only observed in phrase-medial, but not in phrase-final position. In the latter case, instead of noticeable lenghtening of the word <b>accent</b> <b>syllable,</b> preceding items are being compressed. This indicates that the durational organisation of the phrase behaves in a different manner than the intonational one. Pre-phrase boundary syllables are lengtened for an average 60 % compared with phrase medial ones. 1...|$|R
