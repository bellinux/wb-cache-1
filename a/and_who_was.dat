5|$|According to the 19th-century Anglesey {{historian}} Angharad Llwyd, {{the first}} {{church in the}} area was established by St Edwen in 640. Nothing is known of Edwen's life, {{but according to the}} manuscript sources, she was the daughter – perhaps the illegitimate daughter – or the niece of Edwin of Northumbria, a king who converted to Christianity in 627 <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> venerated as a saint after his death in 633. The 12th-century writer Geoffrey of Monmouth said that Edwin was born whilst his mother was taking refuge in north Wales with Cadfan ap Iago.|$|E
5|$|As {{would emerge}} in later {{testimony}} at the post-crash hearing, this crewing combination led to {{confusion in the}} cockpit during the final flight segment, as to who was making the decisions and giving the orders as pilot in command, <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> operating the engine and fuel controls as flight engineer.|$|E

He bored a spyhole into the door of the presidential box earlier that day so that he could check that his intended victim had made it to the play and observe the box's occupants.|$|E

5|$|Chopin's qualities as {{a pianist}} and {{composer}} were recognized {{by many of}} his fellow musicians. Schumann named a piece for him in his suite Carnaval, and Chopin later dedicated his Ballade No. 2 in F major to Schumann. Elements of Chopin's music can be traced in many of Liszt's later works. Liszt later transcribed for piano six of Chopin's Polish songs. A less fraught friendship was with Alkan, with whom he discussed elements of folk music, <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> deeply affected by Chopin's death.|$|E
5|$|Europium {{was first}} found in 1890 by Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, who {{obtained}} basic fractions from samarium-gadolinium concentrates which had spectral lines not {{accounted for by}} samarium or gadolinium. However, the discovery of europium is generally credited to French chemist Eugène-Anatole Demarçay, who suspected samples of the recently discovered element samarium were contaminated with an unknown element in 1896 <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> able to isolate it in 1901; he then named it europium.|$|E
5|$|Floyd C. Brown succeeded George Presley as coach. Like Presley, Brown {{had played}} for {{and served as}} an {{assistant}} under the previous coach. Stanford finished with an 8–3 record, including its first Big Game win in five years, led by Danny Carroll, who had {{won a gold medal}} in the 1908 Summer Olympics {{as a member of the}} Australia national rugby union team <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> now earning a degree in geology from Stanford. Stanford played its final rugby game against USC, who returned to American football the next year, and suffered two blowout losses to the famed New Zealand All Blacks, who were on a North American tour.|$|E

5|$|Geisel {{created the}} book in {{response}} to a debate in the United States about literacy in early childhood and the ineffectiveness of traditional primers such as those featuring Dick and Jane. Geisel was asked to write a more entertaining primer by William Spaulding, whom he had met during World War II <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> then director of the education division at Houghton Mifflin. However, because Geisel was already under contract with Random House, the two publishers agreed to a deal: Houghton Mifflin published the education edition, which was sold to schools, and Random House published the trade edition, which was sold in bookstores.|$|E
5|$|He {{was said}} to have been crowned by St Humbert (Bishop Humbert of Elmham) on 25 December 855, at a {{location}} known as Burna (probably Bures St. Mary in Suffolk) which at that time functioned as the royal capital. Later versions of his life recorded that he was a model king who treated all his subjects with equal justice <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> unbending to flatterers. It was written that he withdrew for a year to his royal tower at Hunstanton and learned the whole Psalter, so that he could recite it from memory.|$|E
5|$|In 1882, Crease {{presided over}} the trial of John Hall, who owned {{most of the land}} on Burrard Inlet that now makes up the {{community}} of Belcarra, British Columbia, <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> accused of murdering his mother in law. Hall and Crease had known each other for years, and Crease had once employed him as his agent in a dispute with trespassers who illegally logged on land he and his friend Robert Burnaby owned near Hall's ranch. Hall was found guilty of manslaughter, and his land signed over to his attorney to pay for his defence.|$|E

5|$|John Schneider {{was brought}} in to play Jonathan Kent. Schneider was already well known as Bo Duke from The Dukes of Hazzard, and Gough {{believed}} Schneider's experience from The Dukes of Hazzard added believability to the idea that he could have grown up running a farm. Cynthia Ettinger was originally cast as Martha Kent, but during filming it was generally agreed—Ettinger included—that she was not right for the role. Annette O'Toole, who previously portrayed Lana Lang in Superman III, <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> fresh off the recent cancellation of her television series The Huntress, was cast in Ettinger's place, reshooting the scenes Ettinger had filmed.|$|E
5|$|Kogălniceanu {{was educated}} at Trei Ierarhi monastery in Iași, before being tutored by Gherman Vida, a monk {{who belonged to}} the Transylvanian School, <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> an {{associate}} of Gheorghe Șincai. He completed his primary education in Miroslava, where he attended the Cuénim boarding school. It was during this early period that he first met the poet Vasile Alecsandri (they studied under both Vida and Cuénim), Costache Negri and Cuza. At the time, Kogălniceanu became a passionate student of history, beginning his investigations into old Moldavian chronicles.|$|E
5|$|On 14 July 1909, Ramanujan married Janaki (Janakiammal) (21 March 1899 – 13 April 1994), a girl whom {{his mother}} had {{selected}} for him a year earlier, <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> {{was ten years old}} when they married. It was not unusual for marriages to be arranged with young girls. She came from Rajendram, a village close to Marudur (Karur district) Railway Station. Ramanujan's father did not participate in the marriage ceremony. As was common at that time, Janakiammal continued to stay at her maternal home for three years after marriage till she attained puberty. In 1912, she and Ramanujan's mother joined Ramanujan in Madras.|$|E

5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov became {{especially}} appreciated within The Five, {{and among}} those who visited the circle, for his talents as an orchestrator. He was asked by Balakirev to orchestrate a Schubert march for a concert in May 1868, by Cui to orchestrate the opening chorus of his opera William Ratcliff and by Alexander Dargomyzhsky, whose works were greatly appreciated by The Five <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> close to death, to orchestrate his opera The Stone Guest.|$|E
5|$|Smuts's {{religious}} observance was unsurprising in one who whose moral outlook was based exclusively upon Biblical teachings <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> destined {{for a future}} in the Church. Yet, though religion continued to serve in this central role, his studies at Stellenbosch, with their decidedly scientific bias, led Smuts towards a more critical examination of his faith. From this time onwards Smuts was, by gradual degrees, to start {{to move away from}} the uncompromisingly Calvinist outlook within which he had been raised.|$|E
5|$|The humanists {{believed}} {{that it is important}} to transcend to the afterlife with a perfect mind and body, which could be attained with education. The purpose of humanism was to create a universal man whose person combined intellectual and physical excellence <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> capable of functioning honorably in virtually any situation. This ideology was referred to as the uomo universale, an ancient Greco-Roman ideal. Education during the Renaissance was mainly composed of ancient literature and history as it was thought that the classics provided moral instruction and an intensive understanding of human behavior.|$|E

5|$|There are {{variants}} {{within this}} tradition. Some versions give {{the credit for}} finding the child to Queen Kirupanci of Chandragiri. Others omit mention of the king of Chandragiri altogether, and omit reference to the Koovagam temple. Instead they focus on the demon Kuttacuran and an apparently impossible boon granted {{to him that he}} will be killed by a person having only a head <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> born from water. Vishnu, incarnated as Krishna, informs the gods that Aravan will kill this demon. With this in mind, the head of Aravan is consigned to the river and is transformed into a child called Kuttan ("born from water"), who kills the demon.|$|E
5|$|Three {{players in}} {{particular}} contributed to that rushing success. Running backs Ken Oxendine, Marcus Parker, and Shyrone Stith combined for 1,831 yards of Tech's total. Oxendine, who missed 2½ games due to injury, accumulated career highs of 890 rushing yards and 13 touchdowns. Parker, who missed four games {{due to a}} discipline-related suspension, earned 467 yards and four touchdowns. Stith, meanwhile, had 474 yards and five touchdowns. Helping block {{the way for the}} rushers was center Billy Conaty, who was named an All-American by the Sporting News <b>and</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> playing in a then-school record 48th straight game.|$|E

Ostoja, the next king, may have been Tvrtko I's illegitimate son (or more likely another illegitimate half-brother).|$|E
