Walker {{emphasized the importance of}} faculty governance by regularly attending their meetings and seeking their advice on major decisions.|$|E
5|$|As governor, Ford raised {{revenue from}} a {{severance}} tax on coal, a two-cent-per-gallon tax on gasoline, {{and an increased}} corporate tax. He balanced these increases by exempting food from the state sales tax. The resulting large budget surplus allowed him to propose several construction projects. His victory in the primary had been largely due to Jefferson County, and he returned the favor by approving funds to build the Commonwealth Convention Center <b>and</b> <b>expand</b> <b>the</b> Kentucky Fair and Exposition Center. He also shepherded a package of reforms to the state's criminal justice system through the first legislative session of his term.|$|E
5|$|At around 4:00 PM on October 17, the {{pontoon bridge}} had been fully assembled, opening the first Israeli {{bridge across the}} canal. The roller bridge was laid soon after at dawn on October 18, and by afternoon, Adan's {{division}} crossed {{to the west bank}} followed by Kalman Magen's division. Adan, supported by Magen, would go on to reach Suez after the failure of a United Nations ceasefire, thereby cutting off two infantry divisions of the Egyptian Third Field Army. Sharon also crossed with part of his division, simultaneously trying to defend <b>and</b> <b>expand</b> <b>the</b> Israeli corridor to the Suez Canal—as well attacking northwards on the west bank to Ismailia in an attempt to similarly cut off the Second Army. His efforts bogged down, and he was unable to reach Ismailia (see Battle of Ismailia), while attempts to seize critical positions <b>and</b> <b>expand</b> <b>the</b> Israeli corridor on the east bank saw little to no success.|$|E

5|$|Because he was {{credited}} with divine power himself, the pharaoh, as a sacred king, was regarded as Egypt's representative to the gods and its most important upholder of maat. Thus, it was theoretically his duty to perform the temple rites. While it is uncertain how often he participated in ceremonies, the existence of temples across Egypt {{made it impossible for}} him to do so in all cases, {{and most of the time}} these duties were delegated to priests. The pharaoh was nevertheless obligated to maintain, provide for, <b>and</b> <b>expand</b> <b>the</b> temples throughout his realm.|$|E
5|$|Because the 1924 Rose Bowl {{and several}} later Rose Bowls had very high ticket sales, the Tournament of Roses Association decided to close off the {{southern}} end of the Rose Bowl stadium <b>and</b> <b>expand</b> <b>the</b> seating from a horseshoe design to one that surrounded the entire field. The 1924 game was the first in which the Tournament of Roses made participating schools responsible for ticket sales. The strategy has been used since, with only a small number of tickets allocated to Tournament officials for each yearly edition.|$|E
5|$|On July 12, 2016, Boeing {{announced}} that it had finalized terms of acquisition with Volga-Dnepr Group for 20 747-8 freighters, valued at $7.58 billion at list prices. Four aircraft were delivered beginning in 2012. Volga-Dnepr Group is the parent of three major Russian air-freight carriers – Volga-Dnepr Airlines, AirBridgeCargo Airlines and Atran Airlines. The new 747-8 freighters will replace AirBridgeCargo's current 747-400 aircraft <b>and</b> <b>expand</b> <b>the</b> airline's fleet and will be acquired through a mix of direct purchases and leasing {{over the next six}} years, Boeing said.|$|E

However, higher-than-expected ridership on NYC Ferry routes in summer 2017 caused officials to order new vessels <b>and</b> <b>expand</b> <b>the</b> capacity of existing vessels. Despite the ferry's crowded nature, it has generally received positive acclaim from passengers.|$|E
5|$|Angelou was {{challenged}} by her friend, author James Baldwin, and her editor, Robert Loomis, {{to write an}} autobiography that was also a piece of literature. Reviewers often categorize Caged Bird as autobiographical fiction because Angelou uses thematic development and other techniques common to fiction, but the prevailing critical view characterizes it as an autobiography, a genre she attempts to critique, change, <b>and</b> <b>expand.</b> <b>The</b> book covers topics common to autobiographies written by Black American women {{in the years following}} the Civil Rights Movement: a celebration of Black motherhood; a critique of racism; the importance of family; and the quest for independence, personal dignity, and self-definition.|$|E
5|$|Because none of Gediminas' {{siblings}} {{had strong}} heirs, Gediminas {{and his children}} were in a favorable position to assume and consolidate power in the Grand Duchy. Gediminas had at least five daughters and seven sons, whose shrewd marriages helped to consolidate <b>and</b> <b>expand</b> <b>the</b> Grand Duchy's influence to areas east and west of Lithuania. Those marriages speak to Gediminas' diplomatic talent in building alliances with the neighboring states that shared his goals to destroy the Teutonic Order and contain the growing power of Moscow and Poland. The marriages of Gediminas' sons helped to consolidate the dynasty's power over various territories already within the Grand Duchy, while his daughters' and granddaughters' marriages worked to strengthen Lithuanian relationships with neighboring powers.|$|E

The Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) was given the mandate {{to form a new}} subsidiary corporation that would restore, renovate, <b>and</b> <b>expand</b> <b>the</b> Manila Hotel. In the following two decades, Mr. Marcos's wife, Imelda, could frequently be seen at the hotel restaurants. During her visits, a red carpet and garlands were put out and the air was sprayed with deodorant. Under Imelda's patronage, the hotel reaped international recognition and awards. It was the place to go and be seen during the martial law years.|$|E
5|$|First {{offered in}} 1946 in the Sandusky area and later {{expanded}} to serve Erie, Huron, Lorain, and Ottawa counties, extension programs established {{a foundation for}} BGSU Firelands, the university's regional campus. The college was established at a site located near Lake Erie in Huron, Ohio when the first building (now Foundation Hall) was opened. In 2003, Cedar Point Center opened its doors on the Firelands campus. The facility houses a 450-seat divisible public meeting area, smaller conference rooms, a cyber cafe, multimedia classrooms, and two distance learning classrooms. In March 2011, BGSU Firelands unveiled a new master plan calling {{for the construction of}} three buildings to handle more students, more college/community partnerships; <b>and</b> <b>expand</b> <b>the</b> James H.

5|$|In November, Silahdar Yusuf Pasha {{left behind}} a strong {{garrison}} and returned to Constantinople for the winter. There however, he fell foul of the Sultan and was executed. Nevertheless, Ottoman preparations continued in order to renew <b>and</b> <b>expand</b> <b>the</b> war, while the Venetians were frantically trying to raise money and men, and attempting to induce other European powers to join them against the Ottomans. However, as most of Europe was locked into the fierce antagonisms of the Thirty Years' War, their pleas fell mostly on deaf ears. The Venetians were hard pressed by the financial demands of the war: besides placing taxes on the Italian mainland possessions (the Terraferma), they resorted to the sale of nobility titles and state offices to fill their war coffer. To lead the effort against the Ottomans, the Senate initially appointed the 80-year-old doge Francesco Erizzo, but {{after his death in}} early 1646, he was replaced by the 73-year old Giovanni Cappello as Captain General of the Sea.|$|E
