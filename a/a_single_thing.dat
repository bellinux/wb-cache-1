25|$|My beloved children, I do {{not know}} what you await to shake off the heavy yoke and {{laborious}} servitude in which the subjugation of the Spanish has placed you. I have traveled through all of the province and have inspected all of the villages and, considering carefully the usefulness the Spanish subjugation has brought to us, I have not found <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>thing</b> but painful and inexorable servitude.... The demand for tribute is not appeased by the poverty that locks up our comrades as in a jail, nor is the thirst for our blood satisfied by the continuous whippings that bite and tear our bodies to pieces.|$|E

The Stampeders regained the lead, 11-5, when Howell {{electrified}} the home crowd with his punt return touchdown. The lead was boosted to 14-5 on a successful 25-yard DeAngelis field goal attempt. Calgary increased the margin to 21-5 when Burris sneaked over the goal line amidst a mass of bodies from two yards out, but the Riders closed out the first half strongly. Joseph led the charge from his own 35-yard line and hooked up with Matt Dominguez for a 22-yard strike, capping an eight-play, 75-yard drive which closed the gap to 21-12 at the break.|$|R

500|$|Rock 'n' Roll Circus {{received}} mixed to favorable {{reviews from}} most music critics. [...] A staff reviewer from CD Journal praised the album's rock influences, and commended the album's production. Greg from Selective Hearing was positive towards the album. He commented, [...] "This {{was an excellent}} album and I couldn’t think of <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>thing</b> that could be wrong. It proves that Ayu is still {{at the top of}} her game." [...] However, he felt that [...] "Last Links", [...] "Lady Dynamite", [...] "Sexy Little Things", [...] "The Meaning Of Love", and [...] "Red Line -for TA-" [...] were the album's, [...] "standard cookie cutter fillers". Asian Junkie editor Random J reviewed the album on his personal blog, and awarded it seven stars. He stated, [...] "Rock 'n Roll Circus feels more accessible and easier to connect with than the likes of Guilty." [...] He later commented, [...] "I think this is one of the few albums where Ayumi Hamasaki sounds comfortable and locked into its sound... The album title is a tad misleading, but we can forgive Ayumi Hamasaki for it, given that given the music is good." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1800s, {{psychiatry}} made {{advances in the}} diagnosis of mental illness by broadening the category of mental disease to include mood disorders, in addition to disease level delusion or irrationality. The term psychiatry (Greek [...] "ψυχιατρική", psychiatrikē) which comes from the Greek [...] "ψυχή" [...] (psychē: [...] "soul or mind") and [...] "ιατρός" [...] (iatros: [...] "healer") was coined by Johann Christian Reil in 1808. Jean-Étienne Dominique Esquirol, a student of Pinel, defined lypemania as an 'affective monomania' (excessive attention to <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>thing).</b> This was an early diagnosis of depression.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout the 1950s, Serling {{established}} himself {{as one of the}} most popular names in television.

His most vocal complaints concerned censorship, which was frequently practiced by sponsors and networks. [...] "I was not permitted to have my senators discuss any current or pressing problem," [...] he said of his 1957 production The Arena, intended to be an involving look into contemporary politics. [...] "To talk of tariff was to align oneself with the Republicans; to talk of labor was to suggest control by the Democrats.

2500|$|Bernal Díaz del Castillo is the chronicler {{who gives}} the most {{detail about the}} voyage of Hernández de Córdoba; his is also the only first-person account by someone who was present for the entire process. Also, Bernal {{declares}} in his chronicle {{that he had been}} himself a promoter of the project, together with another hundred or so Spaniards who said they had to [...] "occupy themselves". These soldiers and adventurers had been three years now in the newly settled territory of Cuba, many also having moved there from the colony of Castilla del Oro (Tierra Firme, present-day Panama) under its governor Pedrarias Dávila, where they were apparently surplus to requirements; they complained that [...] "they hadn't done <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>thing</b> worth the telling".|$|E
2500|$|Initially Davies and {{director}} Giacomo Campiotti clashed {{about how to}} present the material. Davies recalled, [...] "The first couple of weeks after Giacomo joined this project were horrendous for me because Zhivago {{has always been one}} of his very favorite books. He has always dreamed about filming it and has his own interpretation in his head. I can actually remember thinking after one long, long day, where we just didn't agree about <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>thing,</b> that it wasn't going to work—it's either got to be him or me. Somehow, we arrived at a compromise and I have almost forgotten what we were arguing about now, as now we are both very pleased with the script. I always knew that he would make it look beautiful because he has got a poet's vision and now, having seen the rushes and some cut footage, I feel like he is my favourite director of all time. Everything is delightful now... Giacomo Campiotti's direction makes it extraordinary." ...|$|E

Surely, this sacrifice of time and inclination requires some compensation, which it meets with. But how am I entitled to make my fortune (which cannot be done without all this anxiety and drudgery) who do hardly any thing at all, and never any thing but what I like to do?

Charles Ardai of Computer Gaming World gave the game {{two and a half}} stars out of five, praising the graphics and visuals as [...] "gorgeous", but criticizing the playability, the bots' responses in the text parser, and ultimately thought that the game is [...] "just not very funny". Adventure Gamers's Evan Dickens similarly praised the graphics and [...] "beautiful" [...] animation, but criticized the navigation and the parser, writing that the bots [...] "won't understand or respond correctly to <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>thing</b> [...] ", and called it an [...] "antiquated keyword-recognition system".

60|$|Our first {{stopping}} {{place was}} the Isle of Wight. We entered the Solent about ten o'clock one morning, and I must confess that my heart sank {{as we came}} close to shore. No lighthouse was visible, though one was plainly indicated upon my map. Upon neither shore was sign of human habitation. We skirted the northern shore of the island in fruitless search for man, and then at last landed upon an eastern point, where Newport should have stood, but where only weeds and great trees and tangled wild wood rioted, and not <b>a</b> <b>single</b> manmade <b>thing</b> was visible to the eye.|$|R
2500|$|Fellow crime writer Anthony Berkeley Cox, writing {{under the}} nom de plume of Francis Iles, {{reviewed}} the novel in the 6 December 1957 issue of The Guardian, {{in which he}} confessed to being disappointed with the work: [...] "I have only pity for those poor souls who cannot enjoy the sprightly stories of Agatha Christie; but though sprightliness is {{not the least of}} this remarkable writer's qualities, there is another that we look for in her, and that is detection: genuine, steady, logical detection, taking us step by step nearer {{to the heart of the}} mystery. Unfortunately it is that quality that is missing in 4.50 from Paddington. The police never seem to find out <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>thing,</b> and even Miss Marples (sic) lies low and says nuffin' to the point until the final dramatic exposure.

2500|$|While Leone {{developed}} Vincenzoni's idea into a script, the screenwriter {{recommended the}} comedy-writing team of Agenore Incrucci and Furio Scarpelli {{to work on}} it with Leone and Sergio Donati. According to Leone, [...] "I couldn't use <b>a</b> <b>single</b> <b>thing</b> they'd written. It was the grossest deception of my life." [...] Donati agreed, saying, [...] "There was next to nothing of them in the final script. They only wrote the first part. Just one line." [...] Vincenzoni claims that he wrote the screenplay in 11 days, but he soon left the project after his relationship with Leone soured. The three main characters all contain autobiographical elements of Leone. In an interview he said, [...] " [...] has no spirit, he's a professional in the most banal sense of the term. Like a robot. This isn't the case with the other two. On the methodical and careful side of my character, I'd be nearer il Biondo (Blondie): but my most profound sympathy always goes towards the Tuco side... He can be touching with all that tenderness and all that wounded humanity." [...] Film director Alex Cox suggests that the cemetery-buried gold hunted by the protagonists may have been inspired by rumours surrounding the anti-Communist Gladio terrorists, who hid many of their 138 weapons caches in cemeteries.|$|E

40|$|Resolution of {{the problem}} of mass nouns depends on an {{expansion}} of our semantic/ontological taxonomy. Semantically, mass nouns are neither singular nor plural; they apply to neither just one object, nor to many objects, at a time. But their deepest kinship links them to the plural. A plural phrase — 'the cats in Kingston' — does not denote <b>a</b> <b>single</b> plural <b>thing,</b> but merely many distinct things. Just so, 'the water in the lake' does not denote <b>a</b> <b>single</b> aggregate — it is not ONE, but rather MUCH. The world is not the totality of singular objects, plural objects, and mass objects; for there are no plural or mass objects. It is the totality of single objects and (just) stuff...|$|R

As he watched, the dead flat of the scenery overpowered him, though he was fully alive to the beauty of that untarnished early summer green which was worn for the nonce by the poorest blade. There was something in its oppressive horizontality which too much reminded him of the arena of life; it gave him a sense of bare equality with, and no superiority to, <b>a</b> <b>single</b> living <b>thing</b> under the sun.|$|R
