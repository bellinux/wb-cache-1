At {{the time of its}} introduction, The APL Machine was likely the fastest APL system available. Although a technological success, The APL Machine was a marketing failure. The initial version supported a single process at a time. At the time the project was discontinued, the design had been completed to allow multiple users. As an aside, an unusual aspect of The APL Machine was that the library of workspaces was organized such that a single function or variable that was shared by many workspaces existed only once in the library. Several of the members of The APL Machine project had previously spent a number of years with Burroughs implementing APL\700.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{multiple}} measurement vector (MMV) problem {{addresses the}} identification of unknown input vectors that share common sparse support. Even though MMV problems have been traditionally addressed {{within the context of}} sensor <b>array</b> signal <b>processing,</b> the recent trend is to apply compressive sensing (CS) due to its capability to estimate sparse support even with an insufficient number of snapshots, in which case classical <b>array</b> signal <b>processing</b> fails. However, CS guarantees the accurate recovery in a probabilistic manner, which often shows inferior performance in the regime where the traditional <b>array</b> signal <b>processing</b> approaches succeed. The apparent dichotomy between the probabilistic CS and deterministic sensor <b>array</b> signal <b>processing</b> has not been fully understood. The main contribution of the present article is a unified approach that revisits the link between CS and <b>array</b> signal <b>processing</b> first unveiled in the mid 1990 s by Feng and Bresler. The new algorithm, which we call compressive MUSIC, identifies the parts of support using CS, after which the remaining supports are estimated using a novel generalized MUSIC criterion.

40|$|<b>Array</b> signal <b>processing</b> is an {{important}} branch {{in the field of}} signal processing. In recent years, it has developed dramatically. It can be applied in such fields as radio detection and ranging, communication, sonar, earthquake, exploration, astronomy and biomedicine. The field of direction of <b>array</b> signal <b>processing</b> can be classified into self-adaption <b>array</b> signal <b>processing</b> and spatial spectrum, in which spatial spectrum estimation theory and technology is still in the ascendant status, and become a main aspect in the course of <b>array</b> signal <b>processing.</b> Spatial spectrum estimation is focused on investigating the system of spatial multiple sensor arrays, with the main purpose of estimating the signal’s spatial parameters and the location of the signal source. The spatial spectrum expresses signal distribution in the space from all directions to the receiver. Hence, if one can get the signal’s spatial spectrum, then the direction of arrival (DOA) can be obtained. As thus, spatial spectrum estimation is also called DOA estimation. DOA technology research is important in <b>array</b> signal <b>processing,</b> which is an interdisciplinary technology that develops rapidly in recent years, especially the direction of arrival with multiple signal sources, the estimation of coherent signal sources, and the DOA estimation of broadband signals. DOA estimation has a wide application prospect in radar, sonar, communication, seismology measurement and biomedicine. Over the past few years, all kinds of algorithms which can be used in DOA estimation have made great achievements, the most classic algorithm among which is Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC). In this thesis I will give an overview of the DOA estimation based on MUSIC algorithm...|$|R
40|$|Electrostatic sensor arrays (ESAs) are {{promising}} in industrial applications related to charged particle monitoring. Sensitivity {{is a fundamental}} and commonly-used sensing characteristic of an ESA. However, the usually used spatial sensitivity, which is called static sensitivity here, is not proper for moving particles or capable of reflecting <b>array</b> signal <b>processing</b> algorithms integrated in an ESA. Besides, reports on ESAs for intermittent particles are scarce yet, especially lacking suitable <b>array</b> signal <b>processing</b> algorithms. To solve the problems, the dynamic sensitivity of ESA is proposed, and a hemisphere-shaped electrostatic sensors’ circular array (HSESCA) along with its application in intermittent particle monitoring are taken as an example. In detail, a sensing model of the HSESCA is built. On this basis, its array signals are analyzed; the dynamic sensitivity is thereupon defined by analyzing the <b>processing</b> of the <b>array</b> signals. Besides, a component extraction-based <b>array</b> signal <b>processing</b> algorithm for intermittent particles is proposed, and the corresponding dynamic sensitivity is analyzed quantitatively.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{estimating}} {{the parameters of}} several wavefronts from the measurements of multiple sensors {{is often referred to}} as <b>array</b> signal <b>processing.</b> The maximum likelihood (ML) estimator in <b>array</b> signal <b>processing</b> for the case of non-coherent signals has been studied extensively. The focus here is on the ML estimator for the case of stochastic coherent signals which arises due to, for example, specular multipath propagation. We show the very surprising fact that the ML estimates of the signal parameters obtained by ignoring the information that the sources are coherent, coincide in large samples with the ML estimates obtained by exploiting the coherent source information. Thus, the ML signal parameter estimator derived for the non-coherent case (or its large-sample realizations such as MODE or WSF) asymptotically achieves the lowest possible estimation error variance (corresponding to the coherent Cram'er-Rao bound). 1.

50|$|Precisely, we are {{interested}} in solving these problems in noisy environments (in the presence of noise and interfering signals). Estimation theory is an important and basic part of signal processing field, which used to deal with estimation problem in which the values of several parameters of the system should be estimated based on measured/empirical data that has a random component. As the number of applications increases, estimating temporal and spatial parameters become more important. <b>Array</b> <b>processing</b> emerged in the last few decades as an active area and was centered on the ability of using and combining data from different sensors (antennas) {{in order to deal with}} specific estimation task (spatial and temporal processing). In addition to the information that can be extracted from the collected data the framework uses the advantage prior knowledge about the geometry of the sensor array to perform the estimation task. <b>Array</b> <b>processing</b> is used in radar, sonar, seismic exploration, anti-jamming and wireless communications. One of the main advantages of using <b>array</b> <b>processing</b> along with an array of sensors is a smaller foot-print. The problems associated with <b>array</b> <b>processing</b> include the number of sources used, their direction of arrivals, and their signal waveforms. There are four assumptions in <b>array</b> <b>processing.</b> The first assumption is that there is uniform propagation in all directions of isotropic and non-dispersive medium. The second assumption is that for far field <b>array</b> <b>processing,</b> the radius of propagation is much greater than size of the array and that there is plane wave propagation. The third assumption is that there is a zero mean white noise and signal, which shows uncorrelation. Finally, the last assumption is that there is no coupling and the calibration is perfect.|$|E
