5|$|Breaking Benjamin is an American {{rock band}} from Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, founded in 1999 by lead singer and guitarist Benjamin Burnley and drummer Jeremy Hummel. The first lineup {{of the band}} also {{included}} guitarist Aaron Fink and bassist Mark Klepaski. This lineup released two albums, Saturate (2002) <b>and</b> <b>We</b> <b>Are</b> <b>Not</b> Alone (2004), before Hummel was replaced by Chad Szeliga in 2005. The band released two more studio albums, Phobia (2006) and Dear Agony (2009), before entering an extended hiatus in early 2010 due to Burnley's recurring illnesses.|$|E

25|$|A third sale of 144 plots {{took place}} on 7 July 1890 making £2,450 for the Land Company, and events {{included}} a regatta with a coastguards' race and pair-oared rowing race, plus a traditional duck hunt in which a man acts as duck. The fourth and final auction of 124 plots on 28 July 1890 promised yet another special train from London {{and the opportunity to}} buy the shop plots and more villa plots. Four shop plots went for £54, villa plots for £3 to £7, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> told the sum earned by the company. Some plots remained unsold, and these were advertised throughout 1891. Following the four auctions and three years of advertising, very few plots were developed, and the temperance hotel, church, shops and tavern were never built.|$|E

40|$|Context: Bipolar cautery forceps are an {{expensive}} instrument {{and especially in}} Government Medical colleges and Government Hospitals, getting a pair is a very tedious and prolonged task due to official reasons. Aims: To make a cheap and easily obtainable bipolar cautery forceps. Settings and Design: The reason for innovation was that the cautery forceps in the department were out of order <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> getting replacements. Materials and Methods: Made from condemned and damaged forceps or from stainless steel nonsurgical forceps which are very low-cost, very cheap and easy to get hold of, especially in a Government institution with limited resources. Results: It {{has been used for}} the past one {{and a half years in}} our Department for plastic surgical procedures, including microvascular surgery. Initially, it was designed when the cautery forceps in the department were out of order <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> getting replacements <b>and</b> later on, it became part of the routine set as it was found to be equally good. Conclusions: A very cheap and useful alternative to the commercially available bipolar cautery forceps has been made...|$|R

30|$|There {{are a few}} {{limitations}} of our study. First, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> only able to consider men. Since women have a weaker attachment to the labor market in general, their responses to the unemployment rate and its interactions with health and skills may be quite {{different from that of}} males. Second, the number of time periods in our data was small (only five), <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> able to include years of large business cycle swings. Studies using more observations over time would be able to exploit larger variations in unemployment rates, and they could look into the effects of more specific aspects of health and abilities, as well as long-term effects.|$|R

500|$|In June 2006, McEvilly {{was set to}} join for Bradford City on a free {{transfer}} after agreeing {{a contract}} with the club. Despite McEvilly passing a medical, the move fell through as he was unwilling to train with Bradford during their pre-season without guarantee of a contract. Bradford City manager Colin Todd explained; [...] "We were concerned about an old injury to his foot which has resulted in it being pinned <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> prepared to take a risk with him". McEvilly opted to sign a new two-year contract with Wrexham. During pre-season with Wrexham, McEvilly broke his other foot, having previously broke the same bone twice in four-months during the previous season. His first appearance of the 2006–07 season, was on 25 November at home against Lincoln City in the 2–1 win in League Two, when he came on as a substitute for Kevin Smith in the 80th minute. McEvilly went on to make 28 appearances in League Two, scoring eight goals and a further two appearances in the FA Cup, scoring once against Championship side Derby County in their 3–1 defeat at Pride Park on 6 January. His contract was cancelled by mutual consent {{at the end of the}} season. Wrexham manager Brian Carey said that they are [...] "well covered in terms of strikers" [...] and [...] "he is some way down the pecking order".|$|E
500|$|Nelson's {{passage from}} Sicily to Alexandria was uneventful, the journey taking six days. Due to {{his lack of}} frigates, Nelson was unable to scout to the flanks of his advance {{and as a result}} only spoke with three {{merchant}} ships, none of which had useful information about the French fleet. The lack of frigates had already had a decisive effect on 22 June, when the British fleet sighted four sails to the southeast. Although Captain Thomas Thompson of HMS Leander requested permission to investigate the strangers, Nelson refused and ordered his fleet to continue on their current heading, believing the French to be five days ahead and wishing to reach Alexandria as rapidly as possible. Had British frigates been available to approach and investigate the distant squadron, they might have discovered that they were scouts for the main French fleet, which was only a short distance away. The French frigate had sighted the British fleet and reported its presence to Bonaparte, who adjusted his convoy's direction slightly to a more northerly trajectory. As a result, Nelson's fleet passed north of the French to the east of Malta during the night in a heavy mist. Although Nelson was so close that his signal guns could be heard aboard Orient, his lookouts did not observe the French ships and the British fleet continued ahead without deviating. When dawn broke the following day, Bonaparte's diversion to the northeast had taken his convoy {{out of sight of the}} British fleet, which continued to the southeast undisturbed. On 28 June, Mutine [...] arrived at Alexandria ahead of Nelson's fleet, and discovered that the French fleet was not in the harbour. Once the main fleet had arrived, attempts were made to contact the British Consul George Baldwin, but these failed as he had been dismissed by the British government shortly before and had left the city. As a result, official diplomatic channels were closed to Nelson. A message warning of the French approach was carried to the Ottoman governor Sayyid Muhammad Kurayyim by Hardy in Mutine. Kurayyim replied that he had not seen the French fleet, and that he would enforce the Ottoman Empire's neutrality and forbid both the British and the French from entering the harbour or landing on the coast. He was dismissive of the British warnings: [...] "It is impossible that the French should come to our country. They have no business here <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> at war with them." [...] Without Baldwin no further entries could be made, and when there was still no sign of the French on the morning of 29 June, Nelson decided to turn back northeast and take another pass across the central Mediterranean towards Corfu, following a more northerly course than his first voyage.|$|E
30|$|Another {{limitation}} is the retrospective {{nature of this}} study. However, while women may <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> able to recall their preoperative symptoms with great precision, we believe {{that they were able}} to present a reasonably accurate view of the whole experience from the pre- to postoperative period, and therefore the change in symptoms is likely to reflect improvements or deteriorations.

We report a novel case of IPM that confirms the myofibroblastic differentiation of the tumor. The onset of IPM has been associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). In addition, recently reported cases of IPM have been seen with cyclin 1 overexpression and also with human herpes virus (HHV) - 8 and EBV DNA sequences.

30|$|Essentially, {{when dealing}} with Big Data {{challenges}} and heterogeneous inputs or outputs, the resulting data will still be Big Data if the Big Data Challenge <b>is</b> <b>not</b> eliminated in some way.

In this case, if feature selection was effectively employed as a “Big Data Handler”, then the “Big Data Challenge” would <b>be</b> removed <b>and</b> <b>we</b> would have “Handled Big Data”. Likewise, if feature selection <b>was</b> <b>not</b> effective (or used), then the “Big Data Challenge” would remain <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> able to effectively handle the particular challenges from Big Data.|$|R
