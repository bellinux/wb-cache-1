25|$|Gladys Pugh (Ruth Madoc) Chief Yellowcoat/Sports Organiser/Radio Maplin Announcer â€“ Gladys {{was born}} in 1933 in Pontypridd, and spent her youth in the Rhondda Valley. She joined Maplins holiday camp in 1955 and rose through the ranks to become sports {{organiser}} and later chief Yellowcoat. She won the competition for the most popular girl Yellowcoat every year between when she joined and 1959, when she was beaten by Sylvia Garnsey. Upon Jeffrey Fairbrother's arrival at the camp {{at the start of}} the 1959 season, she fell passionately in love with him, although he did not reciprocate this. On one occasion, she found herself in a situation where Jeffrey had unintentionally become drunk, and she helped him back to his chalet. The following morning he awoke naked with no memory of the previous night, and found Gladys' bra in his bed. What actually happened was left ambiguous. Gladys disliked all the other female Yellowcoats, in particular Sylvia Garnsey, whom she saw as competition in her fight for Jeffrey's affections. Like Jeffrey, she also disapproved of Ted's schemes to scam the campers, even though she secretly had her own scheme selling reconditioned tennis balls. In the 1960 season, Spike Dixon fell in love with her, although she never knew this and it never amounted to anything. Gladys was left heartbroken when Jeffrey departed for Wisconsin without telling <b>anyone</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the season, but she quickly recovered upon meeting Squadron Leader Clive Dempster, who arrived to take over Fairbrother's job. She immediately became attracted to Clive, and the two had an on-off relationship throughout the 1960 season. She eventually married Clive and moved to Australia with him at the end of the season.|$|E

500|$|After {{a six-month}} break, which Dickinson mostly spent practising fencing, Iron Maiden began writing their next album, Somewhere in Time.

He has no writing credits on the release, as his material, based on his own suggestion that the album should be more acoustic-focused, was rejected {{by the rest of the}} band. Steve Harris, on the other hand, stated that his material was rejected because it was not good enough, and that Dickinson [...] "was probably more burnt out than <b>anyone</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the last tour".|$|E

500|$|Although Sharon {{also moved}} on, marrying Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman), Nick and Sharon remain in love. They kiss while Nick, {{suffering}} from amnesia, believes {{they are still}} married; Phyllis is jealous of Sharon, insulting her {{in an article in}} her magazine Restless Style. In January 2009, Nick and Sharon reunite in a sexual affair at the Abbott cabin, an event much anticipated by viewers. According to Case, Sharon wanted Nick more than <b>anyone</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time but only if he left Phyllis; Morrow told TV Guide that although the reunion was [...] "messy", viewers wanted this for a long time. After another one-night stand Sharon becomes pregnant, briefly lying that Jack is the baby's father when Summer becomes ill and Phyllis needs Nick. Nick soon finds out, but their daughter Faith is kidnapped at birth by Nick's brother (Adam) and given to Ashley (Jack's sister). Sharon, believing Faith has died, seduces a guilty Adam. Faith is eventually reunited with her parents, and Adam's crimes are revealed. Nick and Sharon are briefly engaged that November, but they break up when she sleeps with Adam and their relationship becomes bitter. Although Case and Morrow believe the couple belong together, they are apart for several years; during which they both believed a reunion wouldn't happen anytime soon. In late 2013, the characters begin to grow closer again despite the fact that Sharon secretly switched the paternity test results of Nick's daughter Summer; Case stated in an interview that Sharon is in [...] "constant turmoil" [...] regarding her secret, and Morrow stated that he believed a reunion was a possibility given Nick's vulnerability, saying: [...] "They've worked things out beforeâ€”and they could work things out again. There is always a possibility for Nick and Sharon to get back together!"
