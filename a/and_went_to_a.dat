5|$|Han Sai Por {{was born}} on 19 July 1943 in Singapore during the Japanese occupation. She was one of six {{children}} of a poor couple, and her family were squatters living in Changi in a house made of cardboard boxes and coconut leaves. Nonetheless, Han had a happy childhood, <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> nearby beach to make figurine animals out of sand. This experience helped her to appreciate nature and instilled in her a sense of adventure and exploration. At ten years of age, Han was introduced to Michelangelo's sculptures through a book given to her by her mother.|$|E

He ran to the site and {{assisted}} the injured. Rumsfeld returned to his office, <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> conference room in the Executive Support Center where he joined a secure videoteleconference with Vice President Dick Cheney and other officials. On the day of the attacks, DoD officials considered moving their command operations to Site R, a backup facility in Pennsylvania. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld insisted he remain at the Pentagon, and sent Deputy Secretary Paul Wolfowitz to Site R. The National Military Command Center (NMCC) continued to operate at the Pentagon, even as smoke entered the facility. Engineers and building managers manipulated the ventilation and other building systems that still functioned to draw smoke out of the NMCC and bring in fresh air.|$|E

25|$|Māori {{were badly}} {{hit by the}} 1918 {{influenza}} epidemic when the Māori battalion returned from the Western Front. The death rate from influenza for Māori was 4.5 times higher than for Pakeha. Many Māori, especially in the Waikato, were very reluctant to visit a doctor <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> hospital only when the patient was nearly dead. To cope with isolation, Waikato Māori, under Te Puea's leadership, increasingly returned to the old Pai Marire (Hau hau) cult of the 1860s.|$|E
25|$|During {{high school}} Rosalie participated in theater as had her parents while in college. She acted and sang in many productions, garnering praise for her {{performances}} in the local media.

She earned a scholarship to the University of Idaho, but as a result of a rape, she became pregnant <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> home for unwed mothers in California to await the birth of her child, a daughter. Again, the experience of making the difficult choice of adoption shows in her later writings and music.|$|E

As Roma's Bruno Conti prepared to take his kick, Grobbelaar walked towards the goal smiling confidently at the cameras lined-up behind, then proceeded to bite {{the back of the}} net, in imitation of eating spaghetti. Conti sent his spot kick over the bar. Grobbelaar then produced a similar performance before Francesco Graziani took his kick, wobbling his legs in mock terror. Graziani missed and Liverpool {{went on to win the}} shootout 4–2.|$|E

The best run of the paper in the United States exists at the New York Public Library, which holds master negative microfilm of the broken run in their collection. The paper was replaced; by Deutsches Volksecho in 1937.|$|E
25|$|Beck {{probably}} witnessed {{his first}} cardiac arrest during his internship in 1922 {{while on the}} surgery service at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. During a urologic operation, the anaesthetist announced that the patient's heart had stopped. To the amazement of Beck, the surgical resident removed his gloves <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> telephone {{in a corner of}} the room and called the fire department. Beck remained in total bewilderment as the fire department rescue squad rushed into the operating room 15minutes later and applied oxygen-powered respirators to the patient's face. The patient died, but the episode left an indelible impression on him. Beck would go on to develop techniques to take back the management of cardiac arrest from the fire department and place it in the hands of surgeons.|$|E
25|$|Jackson {{was born}} in Deer Lodge, Montana. Both of his parents, Charles and Elisabeth Funk Jackson, were Assemblies of God ministers. Elisabeth came {{from a long line}} of German Mennonites before her {{conversion}} to the Assemblies of God. In the churches that they served, his father generally preached on Sunday mornings and his mother on Sunday evenings. Eventually, his father became a ministerial supervisor. Phil, his two brothers, and his half-sister grew up in a remote area of Montana in an austere environment, in which no dancing or television was allowed. Jackson did not see his first movie until he was a senior in high school, <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> dance for the first time in college. Growing up, he assumed he would become a minister.|$|E

On 5 August, he was called away to the United States to ameliorate the controversy that had resulted from the publication of Lennon's comment that the Beatles had become more popular than Christ. When the 1966 world tour resumed there on 12 August, the band were the subject of radio bans in some southern states and further death threats. According to Barrow, the {{decision to}} quit touring after 1966 was made without McCartney's agreement and {{marked the first time}} that the Beatles had committed to a course of action without unanimous agreement among the four. McCartney said that he was finally persuaded to join the others' way of thinking following the group's concert at St Louis, which took place on 21 August.|$|E
25|$|This {{mine was}} one of the most {{successful}} on the field <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> depth of approximately 400 feet. In the two years after its establishment in 1898 they produced 9,673 tons of quartz for a yield of 36,296 ounces of gold valued at £96,927. The mine was known as Cashman's and the private syndicate of owners was preparing in 1900 to work the mine towards the Golden Gate United reef end on an extensive scale. The ore from the mine was crushed at the Enterprise mill and in March 1900 James Davis had purchased the whole of the tailings of Golden Gate No. 3 and 4 South to be cyanided at the new Station Creek cyanide treatment works. Frederick William Cuthbert, a well known Croydon mining agent, purchased the No. 3 and 4 Golden Gate South and profited handsomely in 1902.|$|E

On 6 May, McIlroy was in contention at the Wells Fargo Championship <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> playoff with Rickie Fowler and D. A. Points. Fowler won the tournament on the first playoff hole with a birdie. The runner-up finish put McIlroy back {{at the top of}} the Official World Golf Ranking.

25|$|By this time, referee J. C. Louderback and his officiating {{crew had}} {{realized}} their mistake, and conferred for nearly 20 minutes to decide their course of action. During the delay, {{radio and television}} announcers also noticed that Colorado had scored {{with the help of}} an additional play. Louderback was shown on the phone. After a lengthy consultation, the referees announced their decision: the touchdown counted, giving Colorado a 33-31 lead. They also decided that the Buffs would have to attempt the extra point. The rules do not require the extra point try if time has expired and the result will not affect the outcome of the game. However, since Colorado only led by two, Missouri could have potentially blocked the try and returned it for two points to tie the game, the try was required. Not wanting to take this chance, Johnson took the snap <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> knee, allowing the Buffaloes to go home with a controversial win.|$|E
25|$|During the 1994–95 season, Genoa were {{narrowly}} relegated; {{they finished}} level on points with Padova after the normal season period.

Genoa eventually lost the shoot-out 5–4. While back down in Serie B, the club had another taste of international cup success when they became the final winners of the Anglo-Italian Cup by beating Port Vale 5–2 with Gennaro Ruotolo scoring a hat-trick. Chairman Spinelli sold Genoa in 1997, moving onto other clubs (Alessandria and, currently Livorno). The late 1990s and early 2000s {{would be the most}} trying {{time in the history of}} the club, with constantly changing managers, a poor financial situation and little hope of gaining promotion, outside of a decent 6th-place finish in 1999–00. From 1997 until 2003, Genoa had a total of three different owners and four different chairmen, before the club was passed on to the toys and games tycoon from Irpinia Enrico Preziosi, already chairman of Como football club he previously owned.|$|E
25|$|In October 1942, the Kamionka Jewish council (Judenrat) {{informed}} the Jewish residents {{that they would}} be resettled in the Lubartów Ghetto. Blaichman slipped out of Kamionka <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> gentile farmer in the village of Kierzkówka who offered him assistance (the family of Aleksander and Stanisława Głos, which would later be listed among the Polish Righteous Among the Nations). He later learned that the Jews of Kamionka had not been relocated to the Lubartów Ghetto but rather were deported on trains to an unknown destination. Blaichman heard that a group of Jews were hiding in the forest, so after two days with the farmer, {{he made his way to}} the forest and found more than one hundred Jews living in an encampment of small bunkers in the forest. He realized that the group was in constant danger. Blaichman encouraged the group to form a defense unit to guard the camp even though they had no firearms. In December 1942 the group managed to acquire firearms from a local Polish farmer. (However, according to another biography, it was only in summer of 1943 that Blaichman left the Głos family and joined the resistance).|$|E
