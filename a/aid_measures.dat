25|$|Like other {{corrosive}} {{acids and}} alkalis, drops of sodium hydroxide solutions can readily decompose proteins and lipids in living tissues via amide hydrolysis and ester hydrolysis, which consequently cause chemical burns and may induce permanent blindness upon contact with eyes. Solid alkali can also express its corrosive nature {{if there is}} water, such as water vapor. Thus, protective equipment, like rubber gloves, safety clothing and eye protection, should always be used when handling this chemical or its solutions. The standard first <b>aid</b> <b>measures</b> for alkali spills on the skin is, as for other corrosives, irrigation with large quantities of water.

25|$|The Santiago Conference, 15 April 1972, was {{the third}} {{occasion}} on which the developing countries have confronted the rich {{with the need to}} use trade and <b>aid</b> <b>measures</b> more effectively to improve living standards in the developing world. Discussion centred on the international monetary system and specifically on the South's proposal that a higher proportion of new special drawing rights (SDRs) should be allocated to LDCs as a form of aid (the so-called 'link'). In Santiago, substantial disagreements arose within the Group of 77 (G77) despite preconference meetings. There was disagreement over the SDR proposal and between those in the G77 who wanted fundamental changes such as a change in the voting allocations in the South's favour at the IMF and those (mainly the Latin American countries) who wanted much milder reforms. This internal dissent seriously weakened the group's negotiating position and led to a final agreed motion which recommended that the IMF should examine the link and that further research be conducted into general reforms. This avoided firm commitments to act on the 'link' or general reform, and the motion was passed by conference.|$|E

We find that external aid has a positive and significant impact on physical capital investment given the support of the sample data we use. This effect is robust to the measurement of aid as well as the policy environment. However, the character of the positive relationship between aid and investment varies with the combination of the <b>aid</b> <b>measure</b> and the policy environment. We find that conditional on inflows, the better the policy environment, the higher the investment rate, all things being equal.

40|$|SummaryPurposeDespite recent {{advances}} {{in the management of}} epilepsy the efforts to assess knowledge, attitude and practice towards epilepsy are limited, particularly in the developing countries. To delineate the magnitude and scope of this problem, present study was conducted to assess the knowledge attitude and practice about epilepsy amongst schoolteachers in Northeast Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state of India. The basis of involving schoolteachers was their special role in Indian society with their larger interaction among the segment of population most affected by epilepsy. MethodsSimple self-administered questionnaires were sent to the schoolteachers of primary and secondary levels. The questionnaires contained 15 questions related to awareness and attitudes towards epilepsy with details of first aid management of seizures. ResultsWe found that 97 % of schoolteachers were aware of epilepsy with majority including it as a brain disease. A substantial proportion (38. 2 %) was uncertain about relation of epilepsy and insanity and 31. 7 % felt epileptics to be of below average intelligence. Only about half of them (55. 3 %) preferred their children to play with an epileptic. An overwhelming no was obvious about marriage with an epileptic (86. 8 %). Only 27. 8 % of the respondents had given any first <b>aid</b> <b>measure</b> to a seizing patient with only 16. 3 % giving it properly. ConclusionDespite a great degree of awareness about epilepsy amongst schoolteachers in India negative and wrong attitudes still exist. Stress on proper first <b>aid</b> <b>measure</b> to a seizing child needs greater emphasis to remove fright and fear amongst the public. Besides adequate management, public education to address existing biases and fear are equally important {{to improve the quality of}} life of epileptics...|$|R
