5000|$|While {{he is most}} {{recognized}} for his influence on fair use laws, he was {{first and foremost a}} champion of libraries and librarianship. In his lifetime McCarthy served as Assistant Director of the University of Nebraska Library, Assistant Director of the Columbia University Library, Director of the Cornell University Libraries, President of the New York Library Association, and President of the Nebraska Library Association. His dedication to good librarianship is made evident {{by the fact that he}} initially refused to accept the job as Director of Cornell University Libraries because of the poor condition they were in when he arrived at Ithaca. Eventually, he accepted the job because he was promised that the libraries would be brought up to date and have resources available to make them state of the art. [...] McCarthy himself would play a large role in developing the collection at Cornell and his tenure saw the unification of the 16 campus libraries.He also undertook a major reclassification project at Cornell, moving the cataloguing system from the Harris system to the Library of Congress Catalogue. The Cornell University Library website boasts that it was during his tenure that the Cornell library system became one of the greatest research library systems in the country. They write,"The staff grew from 70 to 323, while total annual library expenditures increased from about $360,000 to nearly $3.7 million. Some 170,000 volumes were added each year under his administration, compared with about 33,000 <b>annual</b> <b>additions</b> in 1946. Cornell Library’s total collections reached three million volumes by 1967." [...] The Cornell Library website maintains that his lasting legacy at the University is that he initiated the construction of the Olin Library. McCarthy left a substantial impact on research librarianship as is evidenced by his numerous directorships and committee assignments. He personally advocated financial support for academic and college libraries as he recognized the importance they played in advancing the educational mission of universities. The American Library Association classifies him as one of the most influential librarians in the past 100 years.|$|E

Similarly, fears for the adequacy of <b>annual</b> <b>additions</b> to reserves are unfounded: the world is running into oil, not out of it. By contrast, the geography of reserves development is important. Twothirds of reserves are in the Middle East, but 85 % of these are irrelevant to global production to 2010, given the potential in OECD and non-OPEC developing countries, and the maintenance of the current oil price. Thus, demand for Middle East oil will remain frustratingly modest. Efforts to expand production, necessarily in cooperation with major oil corporations, will regenerate fears elsewhere for supply security and create prospects for regionalising global oil around the three groupings of OECD countries, to which the non-Middle East OPEC members will adhere. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{research}} paper on small scale enterprise development in rural Swaziland, {{presented at the}} Fourth Annual Conference on Food Security In Southern Africa, 31 October- 3 November, 1988. There is increasing international concern over the shortfall in food production in Africa. However, there is another issue that has yet not been fully explored [...] the issue of access to food. A critical question {{is the role of}} rural small enterprises in generating rural employment and income as a means of increasing access to food. The tie between rural enterprise development and food production in Swaziland has been examined by Magagula (1980), de Vletter (1984), Carloni (1982), McCann (1981,) and Neocosmos (1985). The government of Swaziland is promoting small rural enterprises because of the realization that {{only a fraction of the}} <b>annual</b> <b>additions</b> to the labour force can be productivel^employed in urban areas and farming because of the large numbers of business that are owned by expatriates.

Two methods of intensification, feeding maize silage (MS) or applying nitrogen (N) fertiliser, were implemented on two farm types differing in the proportions of cultivatable land to hill land (25 % vs. 75 % hill). In addition, the consequences of intensification by incorporating a beef feedlot (FL) into each of the farm types were also examined.
