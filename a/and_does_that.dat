2500|$|Resh Lakish {{taught that}} great is repentance, for because of it, Heaven {{accounts}} premeditated sins as errors, as [...] says, “Return, O Israel, to the Lord, your God, for you have stumbled in your iniquity.” “Iniquity” refers to premeditated sins, and yet Hosea calls them “stumbling,” implying that Heaven considers those who repent of intentional sins {{as if they}} acted accidentally. [...] But the Gemara said {{that that is not}} all, for Resh Lakish also said that repentance is so great that with it, Heaven accounts premeditated sins as though they were merits, as [...] says, “And when the wicked turns from his wickedness, <b>and</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby.” The Gemara reconciled the two positions, clarifying that in the sight of Heaven, repentance derived from love transforms intentional sins to merits, while repentance out of fear transforms intentional sins to unwitting transgressions.|$|E

50|$|Many {{airlines}} promote by seniority {{only within}} their own company. As a consequence, an airline first officer may be older and/or have more flight experience than a captain, by virtue of having experience from other airlines or the military. Traditionally, the first officer sits {{on the right-hand side}} of a fixed-wing aircraft ("right seat") and the left-hand side of a helicopter (the reason for this difference is related to the fact that in many cases the pilot flying is unable to release the right hand from the cyclic control to operate the instruments, thus he or she sits on the right side <b>and</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> with the left hand). Other airlines may designate the more senior of two first officers operating a long-haul sector together with a captain in an enlarged crew as the senior first officer. The senior first officer will then sit in the left seat when the captain takes his rest.|$|E
5000|$|After {{its premiere}} {{and a week}} into the general run (with a running time of 146 minutes), Kubrick cut a scene at the end {{that took place in}} a hospital. The scene shows Wendy in a bed talking with Mr. Ullman who {{explains}} that Jack's body could not be found; he then gives Danny a yellow tennis ball, presumably the same one that Jack was throwing around the hotel. This scene was subsequently physically cut out of prints by projectionists and sent back to the studio by order of Warner Bros., the film's distributor. This cut the film's running time to 144 minutes. As noted by Roger Ebert: If Jack did indeed freeze to death in the labyrinth, of course his body was found - and sooner rather than later, since Dick Hallorann alerted the forest rangers to serious trouble at the hotel. If Jack's body was not found, what happened to it? Was it never there? Was it absorbed into the past <b>and</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> explain Jack's presence in that final photograph of a group of hotel party-goers in 1921? Did Jack's violent pursuit of his wife and child exist entirely in Wendy's imagination, or Danny's, or theirs? ... Kubrick was wise to remove that epilogue. It pulled one rug too many out from under the story. At some level, it is necessary for us to believe the three members of the Torrance family are actually residents in the hotel during that winter, whatever happens or whatever they think happens.|$|E

To answer these questions we couple comprehensive bank-firm level CDS trading data from the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation with the German credit register containing bilateral bank-firm credit exposures. We find that following the Small Bang in the European CDS market, extant credit relationships with riskier firms increase banks' CDS trading and hedging of these firms. Properly hedged banks holding more CDS contracts of riskier firms supply relatively more credit to these firms. Our results are overall stronger for firm CDSs experiencing larger improvements in liquidity...|$|E

40|$|The various {{approaches}} {{prevalent in}} argumentation theory take as their fundamental {{unit of analysis}} the concept of `an argument'. It is generally assumed that any unit of argument is inherently dialectical: Eemeren and Grootendorst (1992), for example, use {{the notion of an}} "implicit discussion". It has recently been recognised, however, that there may be important differences between arguments found in monologic situations and those found in dialogue. Once the distinction has been drawn between monologue and dialogue, a number of important questions arise: How can we define a monologue? How does a monologue differ from a turn in a dialogue? What are the linguistic and contextual parameters that affect monologue and dialogue, and how do these parameters impact the resultant form of argument? How can we classify a given argument, <b>and</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> classification then affect subsequent evaluation?

40|$|Hoarding {{disorder}} is an under-recognized yet complex and pervasive psychological problem that dominates an individual&# 039;s time, living spaces, relationships and safety. Hoarding behaviours {{have been associated}} with a number of disorders, including Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), but as of yet, {{there has not been a}} systematic investigation of the presentation of hoarding phenomena across disorders. Simply, what do individuals with hoarding actually hoard, <b>and</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> differ from objects kept by people without hoarding? An understanding of the differential presentation of hoarding phenomena could help clarify the clinical status of hoarding disorder, which is currently under review. This study examined hoarding phenomena in 109 participants from five cohorts (individuals who hoard with and without comorbid OCD, individuals with OCD without hoarding, individuals with other Anxiety Disorders and non-clinical controls). The results supported the presence of hoarding symptoms across clinical and non-clinical cohorts, but some differences were apparent. In particular, individuals with hoarding disorder were far more likely than controls to collect idiosyncratic objects, some with deeply personal connections. Implications are discussed...|$|E
