5|$|The {{determined}} {{resolution of}} the small party which held this small post {{for more than a}} month, against so comparatively large a force, must surely wring admiration from every voice, especially when the horrors of the latter portion of this time are considered; the dismal spectacle of their slaughtered comrades, the sufferings of their women and children thus immured with themselves, and the hopelessness of relief, which destroyed any other motive for their obstinate defence they made, than that resulting from a high sense of duty, supported by unsubdued courage. This, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>generous</b> spirit of courtesy towards their enemy, certainly marked the character of the garrison of Kalunga, during the period of its siege.|$|E

He died in London, England on 25 April 1778 and was interred in the baptist burial ground, Maze Pond, Southwark; the {{inscription}} on his tombstone represents him as 'aged 56 years'. Two elegies were written by admirers. He left a widow and one daughter, who was living in 1808 and had issue. John Relly Beard was named after him, but was not a descendant. Relly's portrait was twice engraved.|$|E
25|$|Though Paules {{highlights}} the positive consequences of emotional labor {{for a specific}} population of waitresses, other scholars have also found negative consequences of emotional labor within the waitressing industry. Through eighteen months of participant observation research, Bayard De Volo (2003) found that casino waitresses are highly monitored and monetarily bribed to perform emotional labor in the workplace. Specifically, Bayard De Volo (2003) argues that through a sexualized environment <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>generous</b> tipping system, both casino owners and customers control waitresses' behavior and appearance for their own benefit and pleasure. Even though the waitresses have their own forms of individual and collective resistance mechanisms, intense and consistent monitoring of their actions by casino management {{makes it difficult to}} change the power dynamics of the casino workplace.|$|E

500|$|Sir John Tomlinson Brunner, 1st Baronet, [...] (8 February 1842 – 1 July 1919) was a British {{chemical}} industrialist and Liberal Party politician. At Hutchinson's alkali {{works in}} Widnes {{he rose to}} the position of general manager. There he met Ludwig Mond, with whom he later formed a partnership to create the chemical company Brunner Mond & Co., initially making alkali by the Solvay process. As a Member of Parliament he represented Northwich, Cheshire, in 1885–1886 and then from 1887–1910. He was a paternalistic employer and as a politician supported Irish Home Rule, trade unions, free trade, welfare reforms and, leading up to the First World War, a more sympathetic stance towards Germany. Brunner was a prominent Freemason, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>generous</b> benefactor to the towns in his constituency and to the University of Liverpool.

In {{a review of the}} group's 2007 compilation album Greatest Hits, Talia Kraines of BBC Music called it [...] "shimmering" [...] adding that [...] "only a cold heart could fail to love their first festive #1". Digital Spy's Nick Levine said that the group's slower songs were [...] "probably their strongest suit", and thought that [...] "'2 Become 1' manages to combine every element of the perfect Christmas ballad–a touch of elegance, a hint of romance, a soupcon of sexiness <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>generous</b> sprinkling of sparkle–and still finds time for a coy safe sex message".|$|E

500|$|Though {{successful}} in San Francisco, Edwards decided {{to head for}} Boston and New York City to see if his career as an actor could benefit from appearances in the eastern United States. On June 29, 1878, somewhat fewer than 100 of his Bohemian friends gathered in the woods near Taylorville, California (present-day Samuel P. Taylor State Park), for a night-time send-off party in Edwards' honor. Bohemian Club historian Porter Garnett later wrote that {{the men at the}} [...] "nocturnal picnic" [...] were [...] "provided with blankets to keep them warm <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>generous</b> supply of liquor for the same purpose". Japanese lanterns were used for illumination and decoration. This festive gathering was repeated without Edwards by club members the next year, and every year thereafter, eventually evolving and expanding into the club's annual summer encampment at the Bohemian Grove, famous (or infamous) for the casual commingling of top politicians and powerful captains of industry in attendance.|$|E
500|$|Silver's early {{recordings}} displayed [...] "a crisp, chipper but slightly wayward style, idiosyncratic {{enough to}} take him out of the increasingly stratified realms of bebop". In contrast to the more elaborate bebop piano, he stressed straightforward melodies rather than complex harmonies, and included short riffs and motifs that came and went {{over the course of a}} solo. While his right hand provided cleanly played lines, his left added bouncy, darker notes and chords in a near-perpetual rumble. Silver [...] "always played percussively, rarely suggesting excessive force on the keys but mustering a crisp [...] sound." [...] His fingering was idiosyncratic, but this added to the individuality of his pianism, particularly to the authenticity of the blues facets of his playing. The Penguin Guide to Jazz gave the overall assessment that [...] "Blues and gospel-tinged devices and percussive attacks give his methods a more colourful style, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>generous</b> good humour gives all his records an upbeat feel." [...] Part of the humor was Silver's predilection for quoting other pieces of music in his own playing.|$|E
500|$|Having {{considered}} the matter, Cromwell, now Earl of Essex, suggested Anne, the 25-year-old {{sister of the}} Duke of Cleves, who {{was seen as an}} important ally in case of a Roman Catholic attack on England, for the duke fell between Lutheranism and Catholicism. Hans Holbein the Younger was dispatched to Cleves to paint a portrait of Anne for the king. Despite speculation that Holbein painted her in an overly flattering light, {{it is more likely that}} the portrait was accurate; Holbein remained in favour at court. After seeing Holbein's portrait, and urged on by the complimentary description of Anne given by his courtiers, the 49-year-old king agreed to wed Anne. However, it was not long before Henry wished to annul the marriage so he could marry another. Anne did not argue, and confirmed that the marriage had never been consummated. Anne's previous betrothal to the Duke of Lorraine's son Francis provided further grounds for the annulment. The marriage was subsequently dissolved, and Anne received the title of [...] "The King's Sister", two houses <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>generous</b> allowance. It was soon clear that Henry had fallen for the 17-year-old Catherine Howard, the Duke of Norfolk's niece, the politics of which worried Cromwell, for Norfolk was a political opponent.|$|E

500|$|Marcus {{was an avid}} art collector, as well as {{amassing}} {{a collection}} of masks from around the world. In 2002, the Sotheby's auction house mounted a sale of works from his estate, calling Marcus [...] "an insightful and forward-looking collector <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>generous</b> lender whose contributions to exhibitions helped bring notice {{to the world of}} Latin American Art during the 40s, 50s and 60s." [...] The auction house also noted that Marcus had begun collecting at age five (influenced by his parents), but had found his interest in good design vastly deepened by a 1925 graduation trip to Europe, where he visited a famed international exhibition of decorative arts and thus was introduced to the earliest works of Art Deco. The Marcus collections included significant works by Mexican artists Rufino Tamayo, David Alfaro Siqueiros, Diego Rivera, and Rivera's lesser-known friend and colleague Antonio Ruíz; the American sculptor Alexander Calder, and American painter Georgia O'Keeffe. Marcus was friends with Rivera and Tamayo– playing a major role in bringing one of Tamayo's murals to the Dallas Museum of Art– {{and one of the first}} board members of the O'Keeffe museum, which honored him at the time of his death with a paid notice in The New York Times that stated [...] "Stanley's generous support, leadership, enthusiasm, friendship and keen artistic judgment were instrumental in the Museum's inception and success. We shall miss him greatly." ...|$|E
500|$|The Liberal Party {{won more}} seats {{than any other}} party in the election, but {{insufficient}} to form a majority government, leaving the Irish Parliamentary Party holding the balance of power. It proved impossible to form a stable government, and so another general election was called in June 1886. [...] In the meantime, the Liberal Party had split, and the Liberal Unionist Party had been formed. Brunner's opponent at the 1886 election was William Henry Verdin's brother, Robert, standing as a Liberal Unionist. The election was held on 13 July 1886, and Brunner was defeated by 458 votes. In November 1886, Brunner embarked on a world tour, accompanied by {{his wife and his}} son Stephen. [...] His return to Northwich on 2 July 1887 was greeted with great celebration, as he was extremely popular in the town, regarded as a kind and sympathetic employer <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>generous</b> benefactor. [...] Within three weeks of Brunner's return, Robert Verdin died and a by-election was called. Brunner's opponent was Lord Henry Grosvenor, who was standing as a Liberal Unionist. This time, at the election on 13 August, Brunner won with a majority of 1,129. [...] At the 1892 general election, Brunner's opponent was not a Liberal Unionist, but a Conservative, George Whiteley, who was a cotton manufacturer from Blackburn. [...] Brunner was returned with an increased majority of 1,255. [...] In the 1895 election he beat Thomas Ward, another Conservative, by 1,638 votes. The 1900 general election was held during the Boer War, to which Brunner was opposed. [...] He retained his seat, but with a reduced majority of 699. [...] In the 1906 general election, Brunner's opponent was the Conservative Colonel B.N. North who had fought in the Boer War. [...] Brunner increased his majority to 1,792. [...] He continued to be the Member of Parliament for Northwich until the general election in January 1910, when he decided not to stand again, partly because of his own health and also because of concern for his wife's health. [...] Subsequently, he moved to Surrey, [...] but continued to play a part in politics when {{he was elected to the}} Chertsey division of Surrey County Council.|$|E

[...] Between 1859 and 1901 Ordronaux published at least fifteen books and articles about subjects as diverse as heroes of the American Revolution of 1776, military medicine, medical jurisprudence, mental health, United States constitutional law and historical treatises. He left an estate worth $2,757,000 much of which he gave in endowments to several US universities and other institutions. He did not marry.|$|E

Principals were originally elected for life, but subsequent to a council order dated 15 June 1668 they were subject to re-election every three years.
