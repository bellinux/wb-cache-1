5|$|The tansy beetle has a Palearctic distribution. Evidence from archaeological {{excavation}} {{has shown}} that its presence in western Europe is confirmed at least {{as early as the}} Neolithic period. The beetles may be found on tansy (Tanacetum vulgare) and water mint (Mentha aquatica) in fen land <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>banks</b> of rivers with broad floodplains in Britain. Larvae are also recorded from other host plants: Achillea ptarmica (sneezewort) in France and various plants of the genus Artemisia in Russia. Adults and larvae feed on the leaves of their host plants.|$|E
5|$|The wooden Pontnewydd aqueduct, {{which was}} prone to the river flowing over its top, was {{replaced}} by an iron one built on a slightly higher level to provide more room for the river to flow under it. Pinkerton's two locks were rebuilt, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>banks</b> of the Kymer canal were raised by , to allow the water level to be raised. This had also required the Kidwelly basin walls to be raised. At the southern end, access to Burry Port harbour required a deep cutting to be constructed, and this was completed by March 1835.|$|E
5|$|On November 16, the Kiribati islands {{suffered}} the side-effects of Cyclone Tia, with several houses in Tarawa and seaweed farms damaged. Late on November 17, TCWC Nadi started to release special advisories for Vanautu {{after it had}} become clear that the systems south-southwest movement, would bring the cyclone sufficiently close to the Banks and Torres Islands to cause either gale or storm force winds. Over the next 24 hours, TCWC Nadi continued to issue these bulletins as the system moved southwards and brought gale force winds to Maewo, Pentecost <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Banks</b> Islands before they issued the final advisory early on November 19. Tia {{was the first of}} six tropical cyclones to affect Vanuatu during the 1991–92 South Pacific cyclone season, and caused minor damage that was mainly confined to houses, crops and fruit trees on the Banks and Torres Islands. Within the Banks Islands a church was flattened, several roads were blocked and a man was slightly injured by flying debris.|$|E

5|$|The New Englanders {{saw that}} the only {{possible}} place to crack the defences was on the city's northeastern side, where the walls were weakest. Their plan was to land their main force on the Beauport shore east of the Saint Charles River, and have it cross the river in the fleet's boats, along with the field guns. When the landing force was on the heights west of Quebec, the fleet would attack the city and land a second force there. Frontenac had expected the land attack to come from Beauport, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>banks</b> of the river had already been built up with field fortifications on the southwestern side. He proposed to fight only a skirmishing action there, holding his regulars in reserve for a European-style battle on the open ground west of Quebec.|$|E
5|$|The River Slea {{rises to}} the west of Sleaford, near Ancaster, and flows in an easterly direction, passing through Sleaford on its way to South Kyme, beyond which it is called the Kyme Eau, joining the River Witham at Chapel Hill. Kyme Eau had been navigable since at least the reign of Edward III, for in 1375 Gilbert d'Umframville was accused of {{illegally}} collecting tolls on boats carrying food products to the people of Kesteven. He had been doing so for 12 years, and he defended his case before the king, explaining that the river was navigable from Dog Dyke to Brent Fen, but that it suffered from silting <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>banks</b> were in a poor state of repair. Having agreed to carry out repairs, he was granted the right to levy tolls by letters patent.|$|E

Above Ebridge lock, the mill pond has been dredged <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>banks</b> cleared, to create a large expanse of open water. Wildlife has benefitted, with sightings of water voles, otters, reed warblers, dragonflies, kingfishers, wood sandpipers and a marsh harrier being recorded.

25|$|New York grew in {{importance}} as a trading port while under British {{rule in the}} early 1700s. It also became a center of slavery, with 42% of households holding slaves by 1730, {{more than any other}} city other than Charleston, South Carolina. Most slaveholders held a few or several domestic slaves, but others hired them out to work at labor. Slavery became integrally tied to New York's economy through the labor of slaves throughout the port, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>banks</b> and shipping tied to the American South. Discovery of the African Burying Ground in the 1990s, during construction of a new federal courthouse near Foley Square, revealed that tens of thousands of Africans had been buried in the area in the colonial years.|$|E

25|$|It {{was during}} the 19th century that the {{transformation}} of the Colombian economy took place, going from a system of mules, tobacco and gold into a system based on coffee, railways <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>banks,</b> which created the favorable conditions for a robust economic growth. The initiative for the development, investment and expansion of coffee growing in Colombia came from a group of national dignitaries and pioneers, who devoted their personal talents and resources into a venture of slow turnaround and high risk. Especially Colombian magnate Mr. Carlos Pinzón, virtually the founder of Colombia's modern coffee export business. In many ways, Mr. Carlos Pinzon´s coffee empire was the precursor of the present-day Coffee Grower's Federation, overlording consignments, tying up export orders, arranging insurance, and, in many cases, financing.|$|E
25|$|Bords de la Marne, {{also called}} Les Bords de la Marne <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Banks</b> of the Marne, is a proto-Cubist oil {{painting}} on canvas created in 1909 by the French artist, theorist and writer Albert Gleizes. In this {{work can be}} seen {{a departure from the}} representation of the observable world. The subject is treated neither as a confined symbolic allegory nor as a cultural background indicated by specific real appearance, but is instead presented in concrete and precise geometric terms. The development of Cubist and abstract art in the work of Gleizes was necessarily a transformation from the synthetic preoccupation with his subject matter. The passage of Gleizes' painting from an epic visionary figuration to total abstraction was foreshadowed during his proto-Cubist period. Bords de la Marne measures 54×65cm, and is currently in the permanent collection of the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Lyon.|$|E
25|$|By 1923, {{the scheme}} had {{effectively}} collapsed {{with the company}} going into voluntary liquidation. About 30 families stayed on. In order to remain on their selections the Kendenup Settlers Association (Inc.) took up the fight. The government established a Royal Commission 'to inquire into and report upon {{the establishment of the}} settlement at Kendenup', headed by Commissioner William Grogan. Fraud by De Garis had been alleged prior to the Royal Commission but he was exonerated in the findings. A second Royal Commission headed by barrister Ross McDonald was held to look into the difficulties faced by the settlers and possible assistance which could be offered. Changes to the Act which governed the Agricultural Bank of Western Australia were made as a result. McDonald later worked pro bono on the settlers' behalf to negotiate with creditors <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>banks</b> to enable them to purchase additional land and transfer the debentures to conventional mortgages.|$|E

25|$|The town of Peñamiller {{is a small}} {{community}} of less than 1,100 as of 2005, located in {{the west of the}} municipality at an altitude of 1330 meters. The town is wedged between mountains <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>banks</b> of the Extoraz River. It was founded and named by José de Escandón {{in the middle of the}} 18th century. He named it Peña Mellera as the mountain now known as Picacho just east of the town reminded him of a similar formation in the Peñamellera Bajo in Spain. Inside and just outside the town there are many walnut trees. Just further out there are many tall cactus and buzzards can frequently be seen circling in the air riding on warm air currents. Many of the town’s roads are still dirt. The main church building dates from the 19th century and the municipal palace building is one of the oldest in the town. The municipal seat has one public library called the Biblioteca Pública Municipal Lic. Benito Juárez. It offers lending of books with home delivery, research help, guided tours, story hours for children and digital services.|$|E
25|$|With {{few options}} left, the Commissioners built a steam pumping station at Arram Beck in 1868. This was not successful, as the low {{banks of the}} Hull meant {{that there was little}} spare capacity, and the pumped water would often return to the drain because of the {{overfall}} near Grovehill. Next they suggested to the Holderness Drainage that if they jointly dredged the Hull, they could use the mud to raise the banks {{on both sides of the}} river, but the Driffield Navigation objected, and little dredging took place. Finally, the impasse was broken in 1880. The Commissioners obtained a new Act of Parliament, which allowed them to dredge the river from the Driffield Navigation to the Old Harbour. They had to alter the lock at Hempholme, to allow for the lower water levels, but the restrictions on the height of the banks and the necessity of the overfall, imposed by the 1798 Act, were removed. By early 1883, most of the dredging had been done <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>banks</b> had been raised. The Arram Beck pumping station, and another at Hempholme, started working, and further south, the new river levels enabled a new steam pumping station to be erected at Dunswell by the Beverley and Skidby Drainage. Regular flooding of the Beverley and Barmston level was effectively ended.|$|E

Karega returns to Ilmorog, telling of his slow spiral into alcoholism before finally securing work in a factory. After getting fired from the factory, he returns to Ilmorog. The change in Ilmorog is rapid, and the villages changes into the town of New Ilmorog. The farmers are told that they should fence off their land and mortgage parts of it {{to ensure that they}} own a finite area. They are offered loans which are linked to their harvest turnout to pay for this expense. Nyakinyua dies <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>banks</b> move to take her land. To prevent this Wanja sells her business and buys Nyakinyua's land. She opens up a successful brothel in the town, and is herself one of the prostitutes. Munira goes to see her to attempt to rekindle their romance, but is met with only a demand for money. He pays, and the couple have sex. Karega goes to see Wanja who both still have strong feelings for each other, but after disagreeing about how to live he leaves. Wanja plans to separate herself finally from the men who have exploited her during her life, wanting to bring them to her brothel with all of her prostitutes sent away so that she could present the downtrodden but noble Abdulla as her chosen partner. Meanwhile, Munira is watching the brothel, and sees Karega arrive, and then leave. In a religious fervour, he pours petrol on the brothel, sets it alight, and retreats to a hill to watch it burn. Wanja escapes but is hospitalized due to smoke inhalation; the other men Wanja had invited died in the fire. Munira is sentenced with arson; later, Karega learns that the corrupt local MP was gunned down in his car whilst waiting for his chauffeur in Nairobi.|$|E
