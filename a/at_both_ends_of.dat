5|$|A {{number of}} {{improvement}} works {{are planned for}} Tonkin Highway, which will see most of the central and northern sections upgraded to a freeway-standard road with grade separated interchanges. Extensions are also planned <b>at</b> <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the highway, which would see the southern end extended to South Western Highway south of Byford, and link the northern end to the future Perth Darwin National Highway near Ballajura.|$|E

The inner circle has two (2) trees in the left {{background}}, three (3) hills in the center background with nearly a full sun setting behind and {{between the first and}} second hill from the left.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} {{surrounded}} {{on all sides}} by the A38 road, which splits the carriageways at this point, with the station in between. The line runs under the road <b>at</b> <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the station. Access between the platforms is via steps to the A38 at {{the east end of}} the platforms. There is no disabled access.|$|E
50|$|Based on {{multiple}} antennas <b>at</b> <b>both</b> transmitters and receivers, a MIMO vector channel sounder can effectively collect the propagation direction <b>at</b> <b>both</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> connection and significantly improve {{resolution of the}} multiple path parameters.|$|R

5|$|Throughout 2016 the {{necessary}} repairs {{were made and}} as of November 2016 the bridge is once again open to traffic. Height bars were installed <b>at</b> <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the bridge to prevent heavy vehicles {{from being able to}} use the bridge, which is what caused the most recent damage to the structure.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{subsequent}} vowel loss many Mayan languages now show complex consonant clusters <b>at</b> <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> syllables. Following {{the reconstruction}} of Lyle Campbell and Terrence Kaufman, the Proto-Mayan language had the following sounds. It {{has been suggested that}} proto-Mayan was a tonal language, {{based on the fact that}} four different contemporary Mayan languages have tone (Yucatec, Uspantek, San Bartolo Tzotzil and Mocho'), but since these languages each can be shown to have innovated tone in different ways, Campbell considers this unlikely.|$|E
5|$|Limestone traffic {{continued}} on the Tiverton section. Only two boats were working the canal by 1904, {{and the last}} commercial traffic was roadstone from Whipcott quarry to Tiverton, {{where there was a}} crushing plant. Around 7,000tons per year were transported up to 1925. After this the only income was from the washing of sheep, for which a charge was made for every 20 sheep, and the sale of water lilies which grew in the canal. In the 1930s, dams were built <b>at</b> <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> a section near Halberton, where persistent leakage could not be cured.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{asynchronous}} signalling, asynchronous start-stop signalling, uses a near-constant 'bit' timing (+/- 5% local oscillator required <b>at</b> <b>both</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the connection). Using this, the receiver detects the 'first' edge transition... (the START BIT), then waits 'half a bit duration' then reads A further delay of one 'whole bit duration' is executed {{before the next}} data bit is 'read' - repeating for length of the whole serial word (typically 7/8-data bits).Finally an optional STOP bit is appended to identify the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the data word.|$|R
2500|$|In the 1890s the Senate {{sent two}} {{engineers}} and Leonard Melán, {{who later became}} the captain of Sampo, to investigate a new icebreaker design that had been developed in the United States in the 1880s and find out its icebreaking capability. Unlike the European icebreakers, the 1888-built train ferry St Ignace had two propellers, one <b>at</b> <b>both</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the ship. Convinced about {{the superiority of the}} new design, the winter navigation committee recommended that the new icebreaker should be of the so-called [...] "American type".|$|R
5000|$|Fili (Фили) is a surface-level {{station on}} the Filyovskaya Line of the Moscow Metro. The station was opened on 7 November 1959, as the last surface side {{platform}} {{station on the}} line. The dual platforms are protected by canopies and are intersected at either end by road overpasses that provide additional shelter for waiting passengers. Two glazed upper-level entrance vestibule <b>at</b> <b>both</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the station allow passengers to change platforms. Robert Pogrebnoi and Yuriy Zenkevich were the main architects for the station's design. Daily passenger volume is approximately 30,100.|$|R
5|$|The Mitsubishi Electric {{propulsion}} system was retained, having performed better than expected. The wheelchair space was made {{available on the}} end of two mid-train cars, nearest to the lifts in above-ground stations. LED displays that blink to warn passengers of closing doors were introduced in the upper middle section of the door. Additional loudspeakers and advertisement panels were also introduced. Hand grips were moved to the support bars of the seats on the ceiling and grabpoles were located near the doors and <b>at</b> <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> each carriage. The air-conditioning system was modified to match the system used in the C751B cars, with air-conditioning vents and in-flow fans installed.|$|E
5|$|The final {{assault on}} Jerusalem began on 13 July; Raymond's troops {{attacked}} the south gate {{while the other}} contingents attacked the northern wall. Initially the Provençals at the southern gate made little headway, but the contingents at the northern wall fared better, with a slow but steady attrition of the defence. On 15 July, a final push was launched <b>at</b> <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the city, and eventually the inner rampart of the northern wall was captured. In the ensuing panic, the defenders abandoned {{the walls of the}} city at both ends, allowing the Crusaders to finally enter.|$|E
5|$|A {{collision}} with Edmonton's Dan McGillis {{early in the}} 1997–98 season forced Gélinas out of the lineup with a sprained knee. He missed 16 games due to the injury and had only eight points in 24 games played. His tenure with the Canucks ended January 3, 1998. He was traded, along with Kirk McLean to the Carolina Hurricanes in exchange for Sean Burke, Geoff Sanderson and Enrico Ciccone. Gélinas was added to Carolina's roster to add a physical presence to the team and improve the team <b>at</b> <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the ice. He finished the season with 24 points in 40 games with the Hurricanes, and was invited to join Team Canada for the 1998 World Championship. Gélinas scored one goal for the sixth-place Canadians.|$|E
40|$|A bifunctional Poly(2 -ethyl- 2 -oxazolines) {{containing}} hydrophobic <b>end</b> groups <b>at</b> <b>both</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> {{the polymer}} chains were synthesised by terminating a living cationic polymerisation with 4 -bromomethyl benzoic acid. The results {{obtained for the}} clouding point measurement using UV-visible spectrophotometer shows that bifunctional polymer containing 20 monomer units (DP 20) exhibited a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) near 49 oC due to formation of hydrophobic domains by the polymer end-groups. In contrast, the polymer with 50 monomer units does not exhibit any LCST between 20 to 70 oC due to the imbalance in the hydrophilic-hydrophobic interaction in this polymer...|$|R
50|$|Platform 1 and 2 are {{normally}} used only on early mornings and when engineering works dictate. At all other times, services on the Brighton Main Line run limited stop between East Croydon and Brighton: these trains, together with Gatwick Express and Thameslink services, pass through platforms 1 and 2. During 2008 a fence was erected to prevent access to Platform 2, for safety reasons. Gates <b>at</b> <b>both</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> this fence is opened by staff {{for the few}} trains that stop. Platform 3 is used for main line services to London Bridge, London Victoria and Thameslink services to Bedford.|$|R
5000|$|The {{airfield}} of Emmen is {{used primarily}} for military use and is {{operated by the}} Swiss Air Force as training and alternate airfield for jet and propeller aircraft {{as well as the}} ADS95 RUAG Ranger UAV. This means that no jet aircraft squadron is stationed in Emmen, but the airfield is still used as a training and alternate air base. The air base is, <b>at</b> <b>both</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the runway, equipped with retractable arresting gear devices (used by the F/A-18 and in case of a problem by the F-5).

5|$|In August 1998, {{signs were}} {{installed}} along the Meadowbrook State Parkway dedicating {{the road in}} honor of State Senator Norman J. Levy, who died in February 1998 after brain surgery. Levy had served on the State Senate Transportation Committee since 1982 and sponsored the first seat belt law in the United States, and had also {{been part of the}} negotiations that helped work resume on the Meadowbrook–Northern State interchange. The new signs were unveiled in a ceremony in the median of the parkway just south of Merrick Road. Dignitaries at the honoring ceremony included then-Governor George Pataki, Senator Charles Fuschillo and Levy's widow, Joy Levy. Signs were erected <b>at</b> <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the Meadowbrook Parkway and at a point near the Babylon Turnpike interchange.|$|E
5|$|K-383 was {{assigned}} in 1981 over the portions of former US-383 {{that had not}} run concurrently with either US-83 or US-183. The highway was originally designated as parts of US-36 and K-22 in the mid-1920s. The entire route became US-83 and was placed on much of its modern alignment in the early 1930s. replacing the original path that followed section lines. The route was redesignated US-383 in the mid-1940s and paved from the late 1930s to the late 1940s. The highway was relocated within Norton in the late 1930s and early 1940s. Other relocations of K-383 have included the segment near Clayton in the mid-1950s, southwest of Norton in the late 1930s {{and again in the}} early 1960s, and <b>at</b> <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the highway in the early 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Now in {{the town}} of Walworth, NY441 becomes Walworth–Penfield Road. Just east of the county line, NY441 shifts {{slightly}} northward by way of an S-curve that serves as a connector between the segmented West Walworth Road, which NY441 intersects <b>at</b> <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the curve. This is the last curve along NY441 as it follows a linear east–west routing over several small hills to a junction with NY350 west of the hamlet of Walworth, where NY441 terminates. The roadway, however, continues east to Marion as Walworth–Penfield Road, Walworth–Marion Road, and Buffalo Street, a continuous highway maintained by Wayne County as County Route205 (CR205) west of Hall Center Road and Maple Avenue and as CR207 east of those roads.|$|E
50|$|Gap buffers {{are similar}} to dynamic arrays but allow {{efficient}} insertion and deletion operations clustered near the same arbitrary location.

5|$|Public {{access to}} Michigan's {{legislative}} bodies {{is through the}} third floor. The capitol building holds the chambers and offices of the bicameral state legislature, which is composed of the Michigan House of Representatives and Michigan Senate. Public galleries are <b>at</b> <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the third floor. The Senate, with 38 members, has its chambers {{on the south side}} of the building, while the House of Representatives, with 110 members, has its chambers in the north wing. House sessions are normally held on Tuesdays and Wednesdays at 1:00 PM and Thursdays at 10:30 AM, while Senate sessions begin at 10:00 AM on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays. Both houses occasionally convene on Mondays and Fridays. Senate and House sessions are taped by Michigan Government Television, a public service body transmitted to local cable television systems' government-access television channels. Similar to C-SPAN, MGTV has made live coverage of the legislative proceedings available since July 15, 1996.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{is now a}} ruin, and {{all that}} remains above ground is a large grey {{sandstone}} wall, {{which has been the}} only remnant of any building on the site since at least the early 18th century. It includes two large tracery windows, decorated by red sandstone, which stand out against the grey. Red sandstone also appears <b>at</b> <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the walls, suggesting at least two more windows, and meaning that the wall would have been at least twice the length of the surviving fragment when built. Beneath the large windows are two smaller ones, suggestive of an undercroft, and a flue runs between the sets of windows. The wall fragment is thought to be 14th century, likely dating from the reconstruction in 1354.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships were}} to have been {{protected}} with Krupp and Wotan, Hart ("Wotan", Hard) armor plating. The class decks were 20mm thick, with 35mm thick sloped deck. The conning tower had a roof that was 50mm thick and sides 100mm thick. The inner layer of the armor belt was 50mm thick in critical areas amidships, and tapered down to zero protection at the stern and bow. The outer layer was 30mm amidships; it too tapered down to nothing <b>at</b> <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the ships. The gun turrets had the same armor protection as the preceding light cruiser : the sides were 35mm thick, the faces were 80mm thick, the roofs ranged in thickness from 2035mm. The armor protecting the turret barbettes was 60mm thick.|$|E

5|$|At this point, US 1/9 turns east off Broad Avenue {{to merge}} onto US 46, {{which is a}} four-lane freeway. This freeway makes a sharp turn to the {{north-northeast}} and has partial interchanges <b>at</b> <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the 5th Street and 6th Street frontage roads, which parallel the freeway through residential areas and provide access to CR 501. US 1/9/46 continue into Fort Lee, where it has access to a couple commercial areas before encountering the northern terminus of Route 63 at a westbound exit and eastbound entrance. From here, the highway becomes a surface road that continues past more businesses and homes, angling northeast as it comes to an exit for Main Street. Immediately past this point, the road turns east and encounters a complex interchange with I-95, the eastern terminus of Route 4, and the southern terminus of US 9W. Here, US 1/9/46 all join I-95 and continue to the southeast along a multilane freeway with local-express lane configuration consisting of four local lanes and four express lanes in each direction, passing numerous high-rise buildings as it heads east to the George Washington Bridge over the Hudson River.|$|E
5|$|Carl Berners plass {{became a}} public {{transport}} station on 1 February 1923, when the then single-track Sinsen Line of the tramway opened as {{a branch of}} the Rodeløkka Line. The station took its name from the square it was located at, Carl Berners plass, which is again named for the politician Carl Berner. The station was served by the newly created Line 13 that operated through the city center and ran every twelve minutes, and since 29 June 1924 every fifteen minutes. The line was built by Kristiania Sporveisselskap, but they were taken over by the municipality in 1924, and the line became part of Oslo Sporveier. On 28 June 1938, the line was rebuilt to double track. From 19 December 1939, the line was extended along Trondheimsveien to Sinsen; this section was built with double track. In 1948, the tracks at Carl Berners plass was rebuilt to run through the roundabouts <b>at</b> <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the square. The station was served by various services numbers along the Sinsen Line, including 1, 3, 7, 13 and 17, although not all at the same time. At the most, three services operated to the station, giving a five-minute headway.|$|E
5|$|Each {{side has}} {{two sets of}} street stairs, with the {{full-time}} entrance at Grand Avenue and Broadway on the west end. There are two additional staircases by the crossovers; however, these are closed at night. HEET access <b>at</b> <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> the mezzanine allow people to exit fare control without having to {{walk down to the}} middle of the mezzanine. Originally, there were two fare control areas at each end, which is clear from the presence of two closed staircases at the Manhattan-bound side. The mezzanine narrows to about two-thirds of its width on the southern side of the mezzanine directly to the opposite of the closed staircases. The narrowing of the mezzanine did not allow for staircases on the Queens-bound side in this location like on the Manhattan-bound side. Chain-link fence is used to separate the area inside and outside fare control. In total, this side of the station has four staircases in addition to the two closed ones mentioned, while the other side has five staircases.|$|E
25|$|The {{stretch of}} the canal from Banbury to Oxford was built as cheaply as possible. Many economy {{measures}} were used. Wherever possible, wooden lift or swing bridges were built instead of expensive brick ones. Deep locks were used wherever possible, with single gates <b>at</b> <b>both</b> <b>ends</b> instead <b>of</b> double gates.|$|R
