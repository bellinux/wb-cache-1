5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, the term neo-Lamarckism {{came to be}} {{associated}} with the position of naturalists who viewed the inheritance of <b>acquired</b> <b>characteristics</b> as the most important evolutionary mechanism. Advocates of this position included the British writer and Darwin critic Samuel Butler, the German biologist Ernst Haeckel, and the American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope. They considered Lamarckism to be philosophically superior to Darwin's idea of selection acting on random variation. Cope looked for, and thought he found, patterns of linear progression in the fossil record. Inheritance of <b>acquired</b> <b>characteristics</b> was part of Haeckel's recapitulation theory of evolution, which held that the embryological development of an organism repeats its evolutionary history. Critics of neo-Lamarckism, such as the German biologist August Weismann and Alfred Russel Wallace, pointed out that no one had ever produced solid evidence for the inheritance of <b>acquired</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Despite these criticisms, neo-Lamarckism remained the most popular alternative to natural selection at the end of the 19th century, and would remain the position of some naturalists well into the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The early 19th-century {{zoologist}} Jean-Baptiste Lamarck {{suggested the}} inheritance of <b>acquired</b> <b>characteristics</b> {{as a mechanism}} for evolutionary change; adaptive traits acquired by an organism during its lifetime could be inherited by that organism's progeny, eventually causing transmutation of species. This theory, Lamarckism, was an influence on the Soviet biologist Trofim Lysenko's antagonism to mainstream genetic theory {{as late as the}} mid 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} evolutionary theory before Darwin's {{was that of}} Jean-Baptiste Lamarck; based on the inheritance of <b>acquired</b> <b>characteristics</b> (an inheritance mechanism that was widely accepted until the 20th century), it described a chain of development stretching from the lowliest microbe to humans. The British naturalist Charles Darwin, combining the biogeographical approach of Humboldt, the uniformitarian geology of Lyell, Thomas Malthus's writings on population growth, and his own morphological expertise, created a more successful evolutionary theory based on natural selection; similar evidence led Alfred Russel Wallace to independently reach the same conclusions.|$|E

5|$|In 1898, after {{studying}} butterfly coloration, Theodor Eimer (1843–1898) introduced the term orthogenesis with a widely read book, On Orthogenesis: And the Impotence of Natural Selection in Species Formation. Eimer claimed there were trends in evolution with no adaptive significance {{that would be}} difficult to explain by natural selection. To supporters of orthogenesis, in some cases species could be led by such trends to extinction. Eimer linked orthogenesis to neo-Lamarckism in his 1890 book Organic Evolution as the Result of the Inheritance of <b>Acquired</b> <b>Characteristics</b> According to the Laws of Organic Growth. He used examples such as the evolution of the horse to argue that evolution had proceeded in a regular single direction that was difficult to explain by random variation. Gould described Eimer as a materialist who rejected any vitalist or teleological approach to orthogenesis, arguing that Eimer's criticism of natural selection was common amongst many evolutionists of his generation; they were searching for alternative mechanisms, as they had come to believe that natural selection could not create new species.|$|E
5|$|Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed, in his Philosophie Zoologique of 1809, {{a theory}} of the {{transmutation}} of species (transformisme). Lamarck {{did not believe that}} all living things shared a common ancestor but rather that simple forms of life were created continuously by spontaneous generation. He also believed that an innate life force drove species to become more complex over time, advancing up a linear ladder of complexity that was related to the great chain of being. Lamarck recognized that species adapted to their environment. He explained this by saying that the same innate force driving increasing complexity caused the organs of an animal (or a plant) to change based on the use or disuse of those organs, just as exercise affects muscles. He argued that these changes would be inherited by the next generation and produce slow adaptation to the environment. It was this secondary mechanism of adaptation through the inheritance of <b>acquired</b> <b>characteristics</b> that would become known as Lamarckism and would influence discussions of evolution into the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|After {{maintaining}} a nearly steady course for three days, Hurricane Debbie turned northward and slowed as it neared {{a break in}} the ridge previously steering it west-northwestward. During the evening of September 11, a United States Navy Aircraft reconnaissance mission into the storm found sustained winds of 110 – 120 mph (175 – 195 km/h) and a central pressure of 976 mbar (hPa; 28.82 inHg), reaching its peak intensity as a modern-day Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale with winds of 120 mph (195 km/h). After maintaining its windspeeds for over 24 hours, the system weakened and turned sharply towards the east-northeast in response to the upper-level westerlies. By the afternoon of September 13, Debbie was again a Category 1 storm as it quickly accelerated towards the Azores. Early on September 15, the storm passed over the easternmost Azores with winds estimated at 80 mph (130 km/h) before turning more northeasterly. Once past the Azores, there is an uncertainty over the structural changes that took place with Debbie. According to the United States Weather Bureau's preliminary report, the system <b>acquired</b> <b>characteristics</b> of an extratropical cyclone on September 15, though remained a strong system. This conflicts with the best track supplied by the Bureau and the National Hurricane Center's hurricane database maintains the system as a tropical cyclone until the afternoon of September 16.|$|E

25|$|Lamarck {{is usually}} remembered for {{his belief in}} the {{inheritance}} of <b>acquired</b> <b>characteristics,</b> and the use and disuse model by which organisms developed their characteristics. Lamarck incorporated this belief into his theory of evolution, along with other more common beliefs of the time, such as spontaneous generation. The inheritance of <b>acquired</b> <b>characteristics</b> (also called the theory of adaptation or soft inheritance) was rejected by August Weismann in the 1880s when he developed a theory of inheritance in which germ plasm (the sex cells, later redefined as DNA), remained separate and distinct from the soma (the rest of the body); thus nothing which happens to the soma may be passed on with the germ-plasm. This model underlies the modern understanding of inheritance.|$|E
25|$|Critics of neo-Lamarckism {{pointed out}} {{that no one had}} ever {{produced}} solid evidence for the inheritance of <b>acquired</b> <b>characteristics.</b> The experimental work of the German biologist August Weismann resulted in the germ plasm theory of inheritance. This led him to declare that inheritance of <b>acquired</b> <b>characteristics</b> was impossible, since the Weismann barrier would prevent any changes that occurred to the body after birth from being inherited by the next generation. This effectively polarised the argument between the Darwinians and the neo-Lamarckians, as it forced people to choose whether to agree or disagree with Weismann and hence with evolution by natural selection. Despite Weismann's criticism, neo-Lamarckism remained the most popular alternative to natural selection {{at the end of the}} 19th century, and would remain the position of some naturalists well into the 20th century.|$|E

Zapotec languages (along with all Oto-Manguean languages) form part of the Mesoamerican Linguistic Area, an area of linguistic convergence developed throughout millennia of interaction between the peoples of Mesoamerica. As a result, languages have <b>acquired</b> <b>characteristics</b> from genetically unrelated languages of the area.|$|E
25|$|Defects of {{character}} supposedly generated by tropical climates {{were believed to}} be inheritable under the Lamarckian theory of inheritance of <b>acquired</b> <b>characteristics,</b> a discredited precursor to the Darwinian theory of natural selection. The outdated theory begins with the observation that an organism faced with environmental pressures may undergo physiological changes during its lifetime through the process of acclimatization. Lamarckianism suggested that those physiological changes may be passed directly to offspring, without the need for offspring to develop the trait in the same manner.|$|E
25|$|Charles Darwin's 1859 book On the Origin of Species was {{successful}} in convincing most biologists that evolution had occurred, but was less successful in convincing them that natural selection was its primary mechanism. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, variations of Lamarckism, orthogenesis (progressive evolution), saltationism (evolution by jumps) and mutationism (evolution driven by mutations) were discussed as alternatives. Samuel Butler coined the term neo-Darwinism in 1880 {{to refer to the}} selectionist version of evolution advocated by Alfred Russel Wallace. Unlike Darwin, Wallace completely rejected neo-Lamarckian inheritance of <b>acquired</b> <b>characteristics.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century the term neo-Lamarckism {{came to be}} {{associated}} with the position of naturalists who viewed the inheritance of <b>acquired</b> <b>characteristics</b> as the most important evolutionary mechanism. Advocates of this position included the British writer and Darwin critic Samuel Butler, the German biologist Ernst Haeckel, the American paleontologists Edward Drinker Cope and Alpheus Hyatt, and the American entomologist Alpheus Packard. They considered Lamarckism to be more progressive and thus philosophically superior to Darwin's idea of natural selection acting on random variation. Butler and Cope both believed that this allowed organisms to effectively drive their own evolution, since organisms that developed new behaviors would change the patterns of use of their organs and thus kick-start the evolutionary process. In addition, Cope and Haeckel both believed that evolution was a progressive process. The idea of linear progress was an important part of Haeckel's recapitulation theory of evolution, which held that the embryological development of an organism repeats its evolutionary history. Cope and Hyatt looked for, and thought they found, patterns of linear progression in the fossil record. Packard argued that the loss of vision in the blind cave insects he studied was best explained through a Lamarckian process of atrophy through disuse combined with inheritance of <b>acquired</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Packard also wrote a book about Lamarck and his writings.|$|E
25|$|Goldsmith {{proposed}} {{that in addition}} to increasing the generation rate, and thereby evolution rate, a limited lifespan improves the evolution process by limiting the ability of older individuals to dominate the gene pool. Further, the evolution of characteristics such as intelligence and immunity may specially require a limited lifespan because otherwise <b>acquired</b> <b>characteristics</b> such as experience or exposure to pathogens would tend to override the selection of the beneficial inheritable characteristic. An older and more experienced, but less intelligent animal would have a fitness advantage over a younger, more intelligent animal except for the effects of ageing.|$|E
25|$|Orthogenesis was {{the theory}} that life has an innate {{tendency}} to change, in a unilinear fashion in a particular direction. The term was popularized by Theodor Eimer, a German zoologist, in his 1898 book On Orthogenesis: And the Impotence of Natural Selection in Species Formation. He had studied the coloration of butterflies, and believed he had discovered non-adaptive features {{which could not be}} explained by natural selection. Eimer also believed in Lamarckian inheritance of <b>acquired</b> <b>characteristics,</b> but he felt that internal laws of growth determine which characteristics would be acquired and guided the long term direction of evolution down certain paths.|$|E

5|$|In the book, Lamarck named two {{supposed}} {{laws that}} would enable animal species to <b>acquire</b> <b>characteristics</b> {{under the influence of}} the environment. The first law stated that use or disuse would cause body structures to grow or shrink over the generations. The second law asserted that such changes would be inherited. Those conditions together imply that species continuously change by adaptation to their environments, forming a branching series of evolutionary paths.|$|R

[...] Only through vast experience in the natural world can humans learn to recognize objects in all of the various orientations in which we encounter them on a day-to-day basis. The ability to do something well is an <b>acquired</b> <b>characteristic,</b> since a skill comes from one's knowledge, practice, aptitude, etc.|$|R
25|$|As a {{consequence}} of the debate over the viability of neo-Lamarckism, in 1896 James Mark Baldwin, Henry Fairfield Osborne and C. Lloyd Morgan all independently proposed a mechanism where new learned behaviors could cause the evolution of new instincts and physical traits through natural selection without resort to the inheritance of <b>acquired</b> <b>characteristics.</b> They proposed that if individuals in a species benefited from learning a particular new behavior, the ability to learn that behavior could be favored by natural selection, and the end result would be the evolution of new instincts and eventually new physical adaptations. This became known as the Baldwin effect and it has remained a topic of debate and research in evolutionary biology ever since.|$|E
25|$|The {{modern era}} {{generally}} remembers Lamarck for {{a theory of}} inheritance of <b>acquired</b> <b>characteristics,</b> called soft inheritance, Lamarckism or use/disuse theory, which he described in his 1809 Philosophie Zoologique. However, his idea of soft inheritance was, perhaps, {{a reflection of the}} wisdom of the time accepted by many natural historians. Lamarck's contribution to evolutionary theory consisted of the first truly cohesive theory of biological evolution, in which an alchemical complexifying force drove organisms up a ladder of complexity, and a second environmental force adapted them to local environments through use and disuse of characteristics, differentiating them from other organisms. Scientists have debated whether advances in the field of transgenerational epigenetics mean that Lamarck was to an extent correct, or not.|$|E
25|$|From the 1880s onwards, {{there was}} a {{widespread}} belief among biologists that Darwinian evolution was in deep trouble. This eclipse of Darwinism (in Julian Huxley's phrase) {{grew out of the}} weaknesses in Darwin's account, written with an incorrect view of inheritance. Darwin himself believed in blending inheritance, which implied that any new variation, even if beneficial, would be weakened by 50% at each generation, as the engineer Fleeming Jenkin correctly noted in 1868. This in turn meant that small variations would not survive long enough to be selected. Blending would therefore directly oppose natural selection. In addition, Darwin and others considered Lamarckian inheritance of <b>acquired</b> <b>characteristics</b> entirely possible, and Darwin's 1868 theory of pangenesis, with contributions to the next generation (gemmules) flowing {{from all parts of the}} body, actually implied Lamarckism.|$|E
