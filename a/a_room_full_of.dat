5|$|One {{sequence}} came directly {{after the}} casino robbery, where Batman follows a robbery signal on a tracking device in the Batmobile. He {{shows up at}} the crime scene and finds he is at the wrong place (a beauty salon), in which <b>a</b> <b>room</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> girls laugh at him. The Riddler had been throwing Batman off the track by messing with the Batmobile's tracking device. This would explain why in the theatrical version Batman seems to give Riddler and Two-Face moments of free rein over the city. This scene appears in a rough edit on the Special Edition DVD.|$|E
5|$|John's wishes come true, {{though he}} is unaware that the Green-Eyed One owes Elspeth, his hideous spellcasting sister, a wish of her own. In order to fulfill her ambitions, the Green-Eyed One {{transforms}} Elspeth into {{a beautiful young woman}} who can now marry John and become his queen, second and new wife, and Snow White's stepmother. The creature also provides Elspeth with a magical mirror that allows her to see others unseen and to deceive John. As years pass, Elspeth forms a good relationship with her new husband, John, and stepdaughter, Snow White (who now becomes a beautiful princess 16 years later). However, Elspeth is vain and keeps <b>a</b> <b>room</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> magical mirrors which assure her each day that she is the fairest of them all whenever she asks.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Colombian film director Simon Brand, in Los Angeles between April 6 and April 8, 2001, and was choreographed by Dan Karaty. Shot in a set with futuristic backdrops, Simpson assumes {{the role of a}} spy on a mission in the video. It begins with Simpson exiting a helicopter then entering a building to compromise evidence in a laboratory there. Simpson takes the elevator which opens onto a pathway. While she is walking, a gadget appears on the floor followed by a small explosion. In the next scene, Simpson walks through a water tunnel, out of which she is pulled by a robotic hand. As the video progresses, Simpson is shown dancing in <b>a</b> <b>room</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> mirrors. Scenes of ninjas climbing up a rope hanging from top of the building are inter-cut with scenes of Simpson dancing until the laboratory explodes. Simpson is next shown dancing on the rooftop alongside the ninjas before a helicopter arrives and Simpson boards it.|$|E

60|$|They entered <b>a</b> big <b>room</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> people, {{apparently}} doing nothing. From {{the opposite}} side, where the dance-hall opened, came a hum that seemed at once music and discordance, gaiety and wildness, with a strange, carrying undertone raw and violent.|$|R

"Ladies {{were the}} best judges {{in such a case}} as this," [...] said Mrs. Langford, [...] "and let who would consent, she would never have her granddaughters {{standing}} up, speaking speeches out of Shakespeare, before <b>a</b> whole <b>room</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> company." ...|$|R
5|$|Thirty Flights of Loving {{begins with}} the player walking through a small {{corridor}} where individual gameplay elements such as movement and key allocations are explained. After walking through a bar and several more corridors, Anita and Borges are introduced. All three characters then exit on a plane. A smash cut skips the narrative forward to a scene with Anita and Borges lying shot in <b>a</b> <b>room</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> crates. The player character lifts Borges and takes him outside to what looks to be an airport. The player is then taken to a dark room with Anita sitting on a chair, peeling and eating oranges. After walking through another corridor, Anita, Borges, and the player join a wedding.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{sitting on a}} couch in an apartment's living room, holding a {{heart-shaped}} locket in her hand. The next scene shows Clarkson in the bathroom where she fixes {{her face in the}} mirror, she opens the medicine cabinet and tossing all the pills in the medicine cabinet over her shoulder and messing all the bathroom items on the floor, squirting the toothpaste into the sink. When she gets to a container of birth control pills, she turns on the water in the sink, snaps the pills out, and drops them down the drain. Clarkson then starts to take other items; she throws a container of makeup powder spray in the air and smears a container of facial mud mask on the wall. During the chorus, Clarkson and her band perform the song for a dancing crowd in a club. After the first chorus, Clarkson walks into <b>a</b> <b>room</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> closets. She cuts up dresses, rifling through the closets and pulling out clothes, destroying them and singing in a pile of them. After the second chorus, she walks into a bedroom and begins to tear the pillow on the bed, filling the room with feathers. The scenes of Clarkson singing with her band then alternate with a montage of her destroying the apartment, breaks the glass window from the door, breaks the vase, television, clock, fridge, lights, microwave, phone, furniture and the chair. Later, Clarkson takes a framed photo of her ex-boyfriend with another girl in the living room, before pushing a tall CD rack over. She then smashes the framed photo through a glass table, breaking it in half. Having decimated the apartment, Clarkson walks out the door and down the hallway with a hat on her head, just as her ex-boyfriend appears with his girlfriend, walking arm in arm. Clarkson hides her face as she walks away from them. The final scene shows the couple seeing their damaged apartment in shock and the scene of the locket swinging.|$|E
5|$|The video {{starts at}} the Clarksons' household. There, {{she and her husband}} are engaged in a heated {{argument}} and he threatens to smash down a picture of the family at one point. Time freezes still and her husband becomes immobile; Clarkson, however, is immune to this. Looking around her house, she sees her younger self. Hand in hand, the younger and older versions of Clarkson relive her troubled childhood as various painful memories are seen, such as the younger Clarkson making a picture for her father who tosses it into the sink while talking on the phone, and Clarkson's mother making an unappreciated dinner for her father as she puts the father's dinner into the bin. These events drive her mother to the point of taking pills before closing the door in the younger Clarkson's face, so that she doesn't see her starting to cry. The breaking point is finally seen when Clarkson's parents have a physical fight and throw objects at each other. Soon after, Clarkson's father packs his bags and leaves despite the younger Clarkson's pleas for him to stay. The older Clarkson runs back in time to the present, and instead of fighting with her husband, they make up. They then see that their daughter in the video had seen them fight, and they embrace her and each other. Throughout the music video, Clarkson is shown singing on the front porch, her mother's bed and <b>a</b> <b>room</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> mirrors, reflecting an image of her younger self. Note that Kelly is holding Kennedy's hand in the scene where the childhood memories are revealed.|$|E

50|$|Marilyn Waring, who deeply {{criticized the}} UN account system for {{systematically}} under-valuing {{the social and}} economic contributions of women, stated also that she had to read literally <b>an</b> entire <b>room</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> books in order even to understand the standards applied today.|$|R

25|$|When I {{served as}} {{director}} of the Leipzig Bach Archive from 2001 to 2013, I and my colleagues there extensively refuted the basic premises of the thesis, on grounds of documents, manuscript sources, and musical grounds. There is not a shred of evidence, but Jarvis doesn’t give up despite the fact that several years ago, at a Bach conference in Oxford, <b>a</b> <b>room</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> serious Bach scholars gave him an embarrassing showdown.|$|E
25|$|The Higgs field's {{effect on}} {{particles}} was famously described by physicist David Miller as akin to <b>a</b> <b>room</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> political party workers spread evenly throughout a room: the crowd gravitates to and slows down famous people {{but does not}} slow down others. He also drew attention to well-known effects in solid state physics where an electron's effective mass can be much greater than usual {{in the presence of}} a crystal lattice.|$|E
25|$|In November 2013, Hemme {{was put in}} a storyline with Samuel Shaw, after Hemme interviewed Shaw at his home. Shaw {{later became}} an obsessed fan of Hemme, and started asking her on dates, {{including}} one in his house, where it was shown that Shaw had <b>a</b> <b>room</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> posters and a mannequin of Hemme. Hemme was confronted by Shaw on the February 27 episode of Impact Wrestling after an incident the previous week, {{in which she was}} injured when Shaw attacked Mr. Anderson. Hemme was used as a shield by Shaw to fend off Mr. Anderson after Anderson attempted to save Hemme from Shaw after she slapped him as well as exact revenge for the previous week's attack.|$|E

25|$|The Clive Davis's pre-Grammy {{party that}} Houston was {{expected}} to attend, which featured many {{of the biggest names}} in music and movies, went on as scheduled although it was quickly turned into a tribute to Houston. Davis spoke about Houston's death at the evening's start: By now you have all learned of the unspeakably tragic news of our beloved Whitney's passing. I don't have to mask my emotion in front of <b>a</b> <b>room</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> so many dear friends. I am personally devastated by the loss of someone who has meant so much to me for so many years. Whitney was so full of life. She was so looking forward to tonight even though she wasn't scheduled to perform. Whitney was a beautiful person and a talent beyond compare. She graced this stage with her regal presence and gave so many memorable performances here over the years. Simply put, Whitney would have wanted the music to go on and her family asked that we carry on.|$|E

For those who find the piece less successful, however, Rockwell's desire to give concrete form to an ideal produces a strained result. To such critics the people looking up at the speaker have stars in their eyes, their posture conveying celebrity worship, not <b>a</b> <b>room</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> respectful dissent." ...|$|E
50|$|Although {{the phrase}} {{has been widely}} used, there are often misconceptions about the {{function}} of fusion centers. Perhaps the most common is that the center is <b>a</b> large <b>room</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> work stations where the staff are constantly responding to inquiries from officers, investigators, and agents. This vision is more accurately a watch center or an investigative support center—not an intelligence fusion center.|$|R

It has been rumored that the crowd noise was added in a studio rather than recorded on stage. Joel McIver, author of The Bloody Reign of Slayer, asked Live Undead producer/engineer Bill Metoyer, who had worked on the album in Los Angeles. Metoyer responded: [...] "I don't know if I should tell you ! Isn't that one of those great industry secrets? Let's just say that when you're doing a live record, you want live sound — even if perhaps the microphones didn't pick up the audience properly." ...|$|E
