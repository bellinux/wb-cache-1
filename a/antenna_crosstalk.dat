40|$|In {{this paper}} we study two {{important}} reliability issues in deep submicron VLSI design, namely <b>antenna</b> effect and <b>crosstalk</b> noise, {{in the context}} of threelayer channel routing. Cost functions for both of the failure mechanisms are introduced and based on these cost models, reliability enhancement techniques are presented. For antenna effect minimization, a layer reassignment algorithm is adopted while for crosstalk minimization, an algorithm that combines layer reassignment and track reassignment is presented. Experimental results show that these algorithms can reduce the antenna effect and the crosstalk noise considerably without increasing the routing area. The relationship between these two objectives has also been studied and a technique for optimizing them simultaneously is proposed.

The approach was used to successfully detect interfaces within 5 cm of the ground surface. This technique has been adapted for the important task of layer thickness estimation in the near-surface range. This is inherently a difficult problem to solve in practice because the radar echo is often dominated by unwanted components such as <b>antenna</b> <b>crosstalk</b> and ring-down, ground reflection effects and clutter.

40|$|Several {{yield and}} {{reliability}} enhancement techniques {{have been proposed}} for the compaction, routing and technology mapping stages of VLSI design. For yield, we modify the existing layouts to reduce {{the sensitivity of the}} design to random point defects, which are the main yield detractors in today 2 ̆ 7 s IC technology. For reliability, we deal with several important failure mechanisms including electromigration, <b>antenna</b> effect, <b>crosstalk</b> noise and hot-carrier effect. ^ At the layout compaction stage, new techniques for yield enhancement are presented and the yield improvement results on some industrial examples are shown. These new techniques take 2 D connections into consideration when performing 1 D compaction and they consider the problem of data volume control when dealing with hierarchical design. For this stage of the VLSI layout design, we also propose a minimum layout perturbation compaction algorithm for electromigration reliability enhancement. This algorithm can increase the width of the wires which have electromigration reliability problems and resolve the design rule violations introduced by the wire widening process with minimum changes to the layout so that the previously achieved layout optimization goals such as area, performance and yield can be preserved as much as possible. ^ At the routing stage, a layer reassignment algorithm is presented for yield enhancement for 2 -layer channel routing. This layer reassignment approach is then extended to antenna effect minimization during the 3 -layer routing process. We also develope an algorithm which combines layer reassignment, track reassignment and dogleg insertion to reduce the crosstalk noise in routing. ^ For the technology mapping stage, a logic level hot-carrier effect model is presented. Based on this model a mapping algorithm which targets hot-carrier effect is proposed and it is shown that a design with the lowest power measure, which has long been regarded as the rough measure of reliability, is not always the best design for reliability. ^ Experimental results have shown that by applying the proposed techniques it is possible to achieve significant yield and reliability improvement during the layout and logic levels of VLSI design. ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{a digital}} {{predistortion}} (DPD) technique for wideband multi-antenna transmitters is proposed. The proposed DPD compensates for the combined effects of power amplifier (PA) nonlinearity, <b>antenna</b> <b>crosstalk</b> and impedance mismatch.

It is shown that all blocks can be identified from measurements of the PA output signals using least-squares estimation. Measurement results of a four-path transmitter are presented and used to evaluate the proposed DPD technique against existing techniques. The results show that the performance of the proposed DPD technique is similar to those of existing techniques, while the complexity is lower...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{developed}} a calibration procedure for imaging radar polarimeters and applied it {{to a set}} of images acquired by the NASA DC- 8 multifrequency radar system. The technique requires the use of ground reflectors known cross-section for absolute calibration, that is, solution for sigma exp 0; however, the image data themselves can usually provide all information necessary for phase calibration and for <b>antenna</b> <b>crosstalk</b> correction. The accuracy of the approach, as measured by calculating the cross-section residuals of known targets in each calibrated scene, is on the order of +/- 1 - 2 dB at P- and C-band, but improves to +/- 0. 5 dB at L-band. The authors present the results of applying this technique to radar scenes of lava flows of varying roughness, temperate and tropical rain forests, and ocean water surfaces. They also present several example applications which are feasible with calibrated data but which would be difficult to implement with uncalibrated data...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{technique}} for comprehensive analysis of nonlinear and dynamic characteristics of multi-antenna transmitters (TXs). The analysis technique is enabled by the development of a Volterra series-based dual-input model for power amplifiers (PAs), which is capable of taking into account the joint effects of PA nonlinearity, <b>antenna</b> <b>crosstalk</b> and mismatch for wideband modulated signals. By combining multiple instances of the PA model with linear dynamic antenna simulations we develop the analysis technique. The proposed method allows the prediction of the output signal of every antenna in an arbitrarily sized TX array, as well as the total far-field radiated wave of the TX for any input signal with low computational effort. A 2. 12 GHz four-element TX demonstrator based on GaAs PAs is implemented to verify simulation results with measurements. The proposed technique is a powerful tool to study hardware characteristics, as for example the effects of antenna design and element spacing. It can be used in cases where experiments are not feasible, and thus aid the development of next generation wireless systems...|$|E
40|$|Precise SAR imaging {{of objects}} or {{detection}} of moving a person behind a wall with UWB radar or nondestructive testing of walls in civil engineering requires {{the knowledge of}} wall parameters like thickness and permittivity. Their use in the data processing produces more precise and realistic results. The measurement of the wall parameters is challenge in a real environment especially when there is access only {{from one side of}} the wall. In this paper, an effective and fast algorithm for wall parameters estimation that can be used in practice is presented. For that purpose the magnitudes and the time positions of reflections from inner and outer interfaces of the wall are extracted from the data. A new scanning method reduces drastically the clutter caused by objects in the measurement environment such as reflections from other walls, the ceiling, the floor and <b>antenna</b> <b>crosstalk.</b> The algorithm was tested on 13 different types of walls with different permittivity and thickness. A handheld M-sequence UWB radar with horn and circular antennas was used for data gathering. The proposed method is very robust and the error of the thickness estimation was less than 10 % for most of walls. The whole measurement can be handled by one person.

40|$|The use {{of ground}} {{penetrating}} radar (GPR) for detecting the presence of near-surface interfaces is a scenario of special interest to the underground coal mining industry. The problem is difficult to solve in practice because the radar echo from the near-surface interface is often dominated by unwanted components such as <b>antenna</b> <b>crosstalk</b> and ringing, ground-bounce effects, clutter, and severe attenuation. These nuisance components are also highly sensitive to subtle variations in ground conditions, rendering the application of standard signal pre-processing techniques such as background subtraction largely ineffective in the unsupervised case. As {{a solution to this}} detection problem, we develop a novel pattern recognition-based algorithm which utilizes a neural network to classify features derived from the bispectrum of 1 D early time radar data. The binary classifier is used to decide between two key cases, namely whether an interface is within, for example, 5 cm of the surface or not. This go/no-go detection capability is highly valuable for underground coal mining operations, such as longwall mining, where the need to leave a remnant coal section is essential for geological stability. The classifier was trained and tested using real GPR data with ground truth measurements. The real data was acquired from a testbed with coalclay, coal-shale and shale-clay interfaces, which represents a test mine site.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} goals in coal mining technology research is the automation of underground coal mining machinery. A current challenge with automating underground coal mining machinery is measuring and maintaining a coal mining horizon. The coal mining horizon is the horizontal path the machinery follows through the undulating coal seam during the mining operation. A typical mining practice is to leave a thin remnant of coal unmined in order to maintain geological stability of the cutting face. If the remnant layer is too thick, resources are wasted as the unmined coal is permanently unrecoverable. If the remnant layer is too thin, the product is diluted by mining into the overburden and there is an increased risk of premature roof fall which increases danger. The main challenge therefore is to develop a robust sensing method to estimate the thickness of thin remant coal layers. This dissertation addresses this challenge by presenting a pattern recognition methodology to estimate thin remnant coal layer thickness using ground penetrating radar (GPR). The approach is based upon a novel feature vector, derived from the bispectrum, that is used to characterise the early-time segment of 1 D GPR data. The early-time segment is dominated by clutter inherent in GPR systems such as <b>antenna</b> <b>crosstalk,</b> ringdown and ground-bounce. It is common practice to either time-gate the signal, disregard the clutter by rendering the early-time segment unusable, or configure the GPR equipment to minimise the clutter effects which in turn reduces probing range. Disregarding the early-time signal essentially imposes a lower thickness limit on traditional GPR layer thickness estimators. The challenges of estimating thin layer thickness is primarily due to these inherent clutter components. Traditional processing strategies attempt to minimise the clutter using pre-processing techniques such as the subtraction of a calibration signal. The proposed method, however, treats the clutter as a deterministic but unknown signal with additive noise. Hence the proposed approach utilises the energy from the clutter and monitors change in media from subtle changes in the signal shape. Two complementary processing methods important to horizon sensing have been also proposed. These methods, near-surface interface detection and antenna height estimation, may be used as pre-validation tools to increase the robustness of the thickness estimation technique. The proposed methods have been tested with synthetic data and validated with real data obtained using a low power 1. 4 GHz GPR system and a testbed with known conditions. With the given test system, it is shown that the proposed thin layer thickness estimator and near-surface interface detector outperform the traditional matched filter based processing methods for layers less than 5 cm in thickness. It is also shown that the proposed antenna height estimator outperforms the traditional height estimator for heights less than 7 cm. These new methods provide a means for reliably extending layer thickness estimation to the thin layer case where traditional approaches are known to fail...|$|E
