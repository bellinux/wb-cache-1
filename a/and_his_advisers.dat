5|$|Jon Snow, Sansa Stark, Tormund Giantsbane and Davos Seaworth {{meet with}} Ramsay Bolton <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>advisers</b> before the battle. Ramsay offers to pardon Jon for {{breaking}} his Night's Watch vows if he hands Sansa over. Jon offers to settle their dispute with single combat; Ramsay refuses, {{saying that he}} may be unable to defeat Jon but the Bolton army can beat the Stark loyalists. When Smalljon Umber proves that Rickon Stark is captured by presenting Shaggydog's head, Sansa tells Ramsay that he will die the next day and rides off. Ramsay gloats that he has been starving his hounds in anticipation of feeding them Jon <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>advisers.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the Mahabharata retelling, when Sugriva re-challenges Vali, Tara dissuades Vali {{from going}} to the fight and points out that Sugriva may have found a protector. Tara, {{described}} as lustrous like the moon, is praised by Vali as one who understands the language of all creatures and is astute to clarify her statement. Tara warns him about Sugriva's alliance with Rama and the plotting of Vali's death {{at the hands of}} Sugriva <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>advisers.</b> Vali not only disregards Tara's advice, but also suspects Tara of cheating on him with Sugriva. Vali leaves, speaking harshly to Tara.|$|E
5|$|In the confusion, Whitlam <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>advisers</b> did not {{immediately}} tell any Senate members of the dismissal, {{with the result that}} when the Senate convened at 2.00pm, the appropriation bills were rapidly passed, with the ALP senators assuming the Opposition had given in. The bills were soon sent to Kerr to receive Royal Assent. At 2.34pm, ten minutes after supply had been secured, Fraser rose in the House and announced he was prime minister. Whitlam immediately moved a no confidence motion against the new prime minister in the House, which instructed the Speaker, Gordon Scholes, to advise Kerr to reinstate Whitlam.|$|E
50|$|Notes: the Greenland {{expedition}} included Professor Eugen Wegmann (University of Neuchâtel), Swiss geologists René Masson and Eduard Wenk. The Bhutan expeditions {{were possible}} {{with the help of}} Jigme Dorje Wangchuks, King of Bhutan <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>adviser</b> Fritz von Schulthess.|$|R
50|$|Stülpnagel <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>adviser</b> {{were both}} {{arrested by the}} Gestapo, and Stülpnagel was brought before the Volksgerichtshof (People's Court) on 30 August 1944. He {{was found guilty of}} high treason and hanged the same day at Plötzensee Prison in Berlin.|$|R
60|$|But {{with united}} voice, Pavillon <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>adviser</b> exclaimed against {{the propriety of}} such an attack upon their ally's soldiers, with some hints {{concerning}} its rashness, which satisfied Quentin {{that it was not}} a risk to be hazarded with such associates.|$|R
5|$|In {{response}} to Stephen's siege, Henry returned to England {{again at the}} start of 1153, braving winter storms. Bringing only a small army of mercenaries, probably paid for with borrowed money, Henry was supported in the north and east of England by the forces of Ranulf of Chester and Hugh Bigod, and had hopes of a military victory. A delegation of senior English clergy met with Henry <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>advisers</b> at Stockbridge shortly before Easter in April. Details of their discussions are unclear, but it appears that the churchmen emphasised that while they supported Stephen as king, they sought a negotiated peace; Henry reaffirmed that he would avoid the English cathedrals and would not expect the bishops to attend his court.|$|E
5|$|The King <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>advisers</b> were {{concerned}} about the rise of socialism and the growing labour movement, which they mistakenly associated with republicanism. The socialists no longer believed in their anti-monarchical slogans and were ready {{to come to terms with}} the monarchy if it took the first step. George adopted a more democratic, inclusive stance that crossed class lines and brought the monarchy closer to the public and the working class—a dramatic change for the King, who was most comfortable with naval officers and landed gentry. He cultivated friendly relations with moderate Labour party politicians and trade union officials. His abandonment of social aloofness conditioned the royal family's behaviour and enhanced its popularity during the economic crises of the 1920s and for over two generations thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Edward's {{forces in}} Gascony were around 4,400 strong, but the French army, {{commanded}} by Charles of Valois, numbered 7,000. Valois took the Agenais and then advanced further {{and cut off}} the main city of Bordeaux. In response, Edward ordered the arrest of any French persons in England and seized Isabella's lands, {{on the basis that}} she was of French origin. In November 1324 he met with the earls and the English Church, who recommended that Edward should lead a force of 11,000 men to Gascony. Edward decided not to go personally, sending instead the Earl of Surrey. Meanwhile, Edward opened up fresh negotiations with the French king. Charles advanced various proposals, the most tempting of which was the suggestion that if Isabella and Prince Edward were to travel to Paris, and the Prince was to give homage to the French King for Gascony, he would terminate the war and return the Agenais. Edward <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>advisers</b> had concerns about sending the prince to France, but agreed to send Isabella on her own as an envoy in March 1325.|$|E
50|$|Dr. Lundstrom {{received}} <b>his</b> BEE <b>and</b> MSEE {{degrees from}} the University of Minnesota in 1973 and 1974 and the Ph.D. degree from Purdue University in 1980.

5|$|Wilson {{was kept}} secluded {{by his wife}} and {{personal}} physician and only his close advisers were allowed to see him; none would divulge official information on his condition. Although Marshall sought to meet with Wilson to personally determine his condition, {{he was unable to}} do so, and relied on vague updates he received through a few bulletins published by Wilson's physician. Believing that Wilson <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>advisers</b> would not voluntarily transfer power to the vice president, a group of Congressional leaders initiated Marshall's requested joint resolution. The senators opposed to the League of Nations treaty, however, believed that as president Marshall would make several key concessions that would allow the treaty to win ratification. Wilson, in his present condition, was either unwilling or unable to make the concessions, and debate on the bill had resulted in a deadlock. In order to prevent the treaty's ratification, the anti-League senators blocked the joint resolution.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} few months, Cranmer and the king worked on {{establishing}} legal procedures on how the monarch's marriage would be judged by his most senior clergy. Several drafts of the procedures have been preserved in letters written between the two. Once the procedures were agreed, Cranmer opened his court on 10 May, inviting Henry and Catherine of Aragon to appear. Gardiner represented the king; Catherine did not appear or send a proxy. On 23 May Cranmer pronounced the judgement that Henry's marriage with Catherine was against the law of God. He even issued a threat of excommunication if Henry did not stay away from Catherine. Henry was now free to marry and, on 28 May, Cranmer validated Henry and Anne's marriage. On 1 June, Cranmer personally crowned and anointed Anne queen and delivered to her the sceptre and rod. Pope Clement VII was furious at this defiance, {{but he could not}} take decisive action as he was pressured by other monarchs to avoid an irreparable breach with England. However, on 9 July he provisionally excommunicated Henry <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>advisers</b> (which included Cranmer) unless he repudiated Anne by the end of September. Henry kept Anne as his wife and, on 7 September, Anne gave birth to Elizabeth. Cranmer baptised her immediately afterwards and acted as one of her godparents.|$|E
25|$|After much deliberation, Bayinnaung <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>advisers</b> {{decided that}} their war of {{restoration}} would begin at Toungoo, the original {{home of the}} dynasty. It was a calculated gamble since {{they would have to}} pass through the heart of Pegu-controlled territory. But they decided to take the gamble because they felt Bayinnaung would find best support in his native Toungoo rather than in the deep Mon country they found themselves in.|$|E
50|$|The King of Clubs <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>adviser</b> Pantalone {{lament the}} {{sickness}} of the Prince, {{brought on by}} an indulgence in tragic poetry. Doctors inform the King that his son's hypochondria can only be cured with laughter, so Pantalone summons the jester Truffaldino to arrange a grand entertainment, together with the (secretly inimical) prime minister, Leandro.|$|R

His Ph.D. In Physics from The Graduate Center of the City of New York was awarded in 1975. His thesis was entitled. “Optimized Average Excited States of Atoms: Intermediate Energy Scattering” <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>adviser</b> was Marvin H. Mittleman.|$|R
25|$|The {{question}} of where the Shah and Shahbanu would go after leaving Iran {{was the subject of}} some debate, even between the monarch <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>advisers.</b> During his reign, Mohammad Reza had maintained close relations with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Farah had developed a close friendship with the President's wife, Jehan Sadat. The Egyptian President extended an invitation to the Imperial Couple for asylum in Egypt which they accepted.|$|E
25|$|During {{his stay}} Washington <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>advisers</b> which {{included}} Alexander Hamilton, Robert H. Harrison, Tench Tilghman, David Humphreys and James McHenry used the four {{rooms on the}} south-eastern side of the mansion for their bedrooms {{as well as their}} military war rooms. Washington also had numerous visitors while at the Dey Mansion, those of which include the Marquis de Lafayette, General Anthony Wayne, Major General Lord Stirling, Benedict Arnold, General William Howe and the Marquis de Chastellux.|$|E
25|$|Sir Alan <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>advisers</b> {{pointed out}} that selling the extras {{played a crucial role}} in {{deciding}} who won and criticised Velocity for not realising this, though Ruth was given much praise for her sales. Meanwhile, there was some confusion about who had made three of Velocity's sales, with Ruth and Samuel both trying to take credit. In the end, Sir Alan decided that Ruth deserved sole credit, leaving Samuel without a sale to his name.|$|E

Calling his new realm the Hanauish Indies (Hanauisch-Indien), Frederick Casimir ran up huge debts that ultimately forced <b>his</b> overthrow <b>and</b> the redivision of his counties.|$|R

50|$|To {{cover up}} {{the signing of the}} treaty, the Teutonic Knights {{organized}} a five-day hunt in May 1380. The Lithuanian side was represented by Jogaila <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>adviser</b> Vaidila, Vytautas <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>adviser</b> Ivan Olshanski. Vytautas' presence further complicated explanations of the treaty and it is unclear if he knew about the negotiations. The Teutons sent grosskomtur Rüdiger von Elner, komtur of Elbing Ulrich von Fricke, and vogt of Dirschau Albrecht von Luchtenberg. The place where the treaty was signed is not known. The name of Dovydiškės is found only in the chronicles of Wigand of Marburg as Dowidisken. The treaty itself mentions Daudiske; German language texts have used Daudiske or Daudisken. However, no such place is known either in Lithuania or Prussia. Some theories claim that the treaty was signed somewhere between Kaunas and Insterburg or that the village was named Šiaudiniškė (Szaudiniszki).|$|R
25|$|In {{drafting}} the Irish constitution in 1936 and 1937, Éamon de Valera <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>advisers</b> chose to reflect {{what had been}} a contemporary willingness by constitution drafters and lawmakers in Europe to mention and in some ways recognise religion in explicit detail. This contrasted with many 1920s constitutions, notably the Irish Free State Constitution of 1922, which, following the secularism of the initial period following the First World War, simply prohibited any discrimination based on religion or avoided religious issues entirely.|$|E
25|$|Task Review - The losing {{team are}} {{subjected}} to a more detailed, extensive review of their performance in the boardroom, with Lord Sugar <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>advisers</b> being more openly critical of any team member's performance on the task, particularly those who performed poorly or contributed very little, while candidates argue their case for staying in the competition, often highlighting others in their team and countering any criticism they receive that they feel is unfounded. Once discussions are brought to an end, the team's project manager for the task is asked to select two candidates from their team to accompany them into for a final boardroom discussion, {{with the power of}} their choice meaning that anyone can be selected, whether they were responsible for the failure of the task or considered to be by the PM, or are someone whom the PM has issues with such as personality clashes. Those not picked are sent back to the candidates' accommodation for that series, while Sugar <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>advisers</b> have a private discussion amongst themselves about the PM and their choices after the group are told to wait outside the boardroom; if the team only consists of two or three candidates, they are simply told to step outside {{at the end of the}} team's discussion period.|$|E
25|$|Helene came {{perilously close}} to being fired due to her failure to make any sales, along with suspicions by Sir Alan <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>advisers</b> (particularly Margaret) that she had {{consciously}} {{decided to take a}} backseat due to her having the least sales experience of the three members of Renaissance, but was saved by the fact that Sir Alan felt she {{had been one of the}} strongest candidates prior to her three-week losing run, and decided to give her a chance in the interviews. The You're Fired panel, while agreeing with Michael's dismissal, felt that firing Helene would have also been justifiable.|$|E
50|$|In 1168, the Rani were {{defeated}} by Danish king Valdemar I <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>adviser</b> Absalon, Bishop of Roskilde, {{resulting in the}} conversion of the region to Christianity. In the course of the 13th century in Pomerania, the tribe was assimilated by German and Danish settlers during the Ostsiedlung, resulting in a gradual Germanisation of the Rani. The Principality of Rugia remained Danish until 1325.|$|R

25|$|In {{an online}} article posted on Catholic News Agency by Alejandro Bermúdez on 31 March 2012, Cuban President Raúl Castro, with the Communist Party <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>advisers,</b> decreed that Good Friday that {{year would be}} a holiday. This was Castro's {{response}} to a request made personally to him by Pope Benedict XVI during the latter's Apostolic Visitation to the island and León, Mexico that month. The move followed the pattern of small advances in Cuba's relations with the Vatican, mirroring Pope John Paul II's success in getting Fidel Castro to declare Christmas Day a holiday. Both Good Friday and Christmas are now annual holidays in Cuba.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, Nana Sahib's forces were wary of {{entering}} the entrenchment, as {{they believed that}} it had gunpowder-filled trenches. Nana Sahib <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>advisers</b> {{came up with a}} plan to end the deadlock. On 24 June, they sent a female European prisoner, Mrs Rose Greenway, to the entrenchment with their message. In return for surrender, Nana Sahib promised the safe passage of the British to the Satichaura Ghat, a landing on the Ganges from which they could depart for Allahabad. General Wheeler rejected the offer, because it had not been signed, and there was no guarantee that the offer was made by Nana Sahib himself.|$|E
25|$|On 8 August 1998 the Taliban massacred 4,000 Shias in {{the town}} of Mazar-i-Sharif, Afghanistan. It also {{attacked}} and killed 11 Iranian diplomats with an Iranian journalist among them. The rest of the diplomats were taken hostage. Ayatollah Khamanei ordered the amassing of troops near the Iran Afghanistan border to enter Afghanistan and fight the Taliban. Over 70,000 Iranian troops were placed along the borders of Afghanistan. Khatami halted the invasion and looked to the UN for help. Soon he was placed in talks. Later Iran entered negotiations with the Taliban, the diplomats were released. Khatami <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>advisers</b> had managed to keep Iran from entering war with the Taliban.|$|E
