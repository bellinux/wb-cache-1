When Charlie wakes from a blackout {{in the same room}} as a murdered starlet, he and Gil set out to bring her killer to justice. <b>As</b> <b>they</b> <b>learn</b> more about her troubled past, they find themselves up against powerful Hollywood elites who do not want to upset the status quo.|$|E
5|$|Cadets today {{live and}} work within the {{framework}} of the Cadet Leader Development System (CLDS), which specifies the roles that a cadet plays throughout their four years at the academy. Cadets begin their USMA careers as trainees (new cadets), then advance in rank, starting as CDT Privates (freshmen) and culminating as CDT Officers (seniors). Freshmen have no leadership responsibilities, but have a host of duties to perform <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>learn</b> how to follow orders and operate in an environment of rigid rank structure, while seniors have significant leadership responsibilities and significantly more privileges that correspond to their rank.|$|E

5|$|Male {{pinnipeds}} generally play little role {{in raising}} the young. Male walruses may help inexperienced young <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>learn</b> to swim, and {{have even been}} recorded caring for orphans. Male California sea lions have been observed to help shield swimming pups from predators. Males can also pose threats {{to the safety of}} pups. In terrestrially breeding species, pups may get crushed by fighting males. Subadult male South America sea lions sometimes abduct pups from their mothers and treat them like adult males treat females. This helps them gain experience in controlling females. Pups can get severely injured or killed during abductions.|$|E

500|$|English, besides forming {{new words}} from {{existing}} words and their roots, also borrows words from other languages. This process of adding words from other languages is commonplace in many world languages, but English is characterised as being especially open to borrowing of foreign words throughout the last 1,000 years. The {{most commonly used}} words in English are West Germanic. The words in English learned first by children <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>learn</b> to speak, particularly the grammatical words that dominate the word count of both spoken and written texts, are the Germanic words inherited from the earliest periods {{of the development of}} Old English.|$|E

500|$|Five recent {{law school}} {{graduates}} from different backgrounds begin working together as first-year associates at Sterling, Huddle, Oppenheim & Craft, a prestigious Los Angeles law firm; they are thrown in [...] and {{are forced to}} deal with court cases that conflict with their personal beliefs and ethics. The [...] "Prince of Darkness", Cliff Huddle, is initially their boss, but things start to change when firm partner Hart Sterling returns after a long hiatus spent {{taking care of his}} sick wife. Even though the firm's partners make things difficult for them, the five attorneys quickly bond under pressure <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>learn</b> to make tough ethical decisions.|$|E
500|$|In many of Shinkai's films, sad endings {{resulting}} from misunderstandings and unrequited feelings are common. According to Shinkai, his stories {{are intended to}} encourage teenagers <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>learn</b> to cope with these commonplace experiences. In an interview, {{he admitted that he}} had been accustomed to being turned down by women, and felt that his stories were encouraging because his characters continue to try, despite being unsuccessful at love. The Garden of Words also illustrated how people do not mature as linearly or elegantly as we often assume. Shinkai himself could relate with Yukari in not feeling as smart or mature at age 27, stating, [...] "We're all still just children at age 27," [...] a point that voice actress Kana Hanazawa also agreed with.|$|E
500|$|Publisher's Weekly said, [...] "It is a {{testament}} to the storytelling that the existence of this parallel world and the convergence of Peter and Thea's stories, told in separate chapters, are both credible and absorbing. Young readers will find this a journey worth taking." [...] Kirkus Reviews found the novel to be a [...] "Thoroughly enjoyable arctic adventure", praising how the adventure tests the main characters' courage <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>learn</b> the truth of both worlds. Vicky Smith from Horn Book Magazine found the two main characters well written and the city of Gracehope well structured. While, Smith found the city's origin unbelievable, she recognized that few people would care about that and compared the threat in First Light similar to the one in The City of Ember. Jenifer Hubert from Booklist also compared the novel to The City of Ember and to Neal Shusterman's Downsiders. Hubert criticized the slow beginning and flaws in the mythology and structure of the underground world, but still felt that [...] "the icy setting and global-warming theme are well realized".|$|E
40|$|In this chapter, preparation, {{practice}} and reflection of classroom teachers <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>learned</b> about literacy coaching are thoroughly described. First, the particular graduate courses {{in which these}} teachers discovered the definitions, models, and responsibilities of a literacy coach and literacy coaching are presented. Next, the varied manner in which these graduate students practiced literacy coaching is pointed out. Finally, the teachers’ thoughts <b>as</b> <b>they</b> became literacy coaches to other educators in their schools/school districts are depicted. Paramount to this entire coaching experience is the change in these educators’ attitudes <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>learned</b> <b>as</b> much about themselves <b>as</b> teachers <b>as</b> <b>they</b> discovered about the teaching styles, beliefs, and classrooms of the peers they coached...|$|R

500|$|The short {{focused on}} a boy named Pen and a dog named Jake <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>learn</b> from the Rainicorn that the Ice King has kidnapped Princess Bubblegum, {{in the hope of}} marrying her. Declaring that it's [...] "Adventure Time", Pen and Jake set off to the Ice King's {{mountain}} lair. Pen and the Ice King fight while Jake remains outside flirting with Lady Rainicorn, ignoring the battle. Just when Pen seems to be gaining the upper hand, the Ice King uses his [...] "frozen lightning bolts" [...] to freeze Pen in a block of ice. For unexplained reasons, this transports Pen's mind back in time, and to Mars, where he has a short motivational conversation with Abraham Lincoln. After being told to believe in himself, Pen's mind is returned to the present, where he breaks out of the ice, {{just in time to see}} the Ice King fly away with Princess Bubblegum. Chasing after him using Jake's extendable legs, Pen rescues the princess from the Ice King's grasp. Jake pushes the magical crown off the Ice King's head, thereby removing the King's source of power. The Ice King then plummets off screen, yelling a long list of complex threats of things he will do when he returns. The story closes with Princess Bubblegum giving Pen a kiss; he enjoys it, but is also greatly embarrassed by the act. He attempts to leave, but Jake claims that they have nowhere else to go and that there are no adventures that need them. However, some nearby ninjas are stealing an old man's diamonds, and they both run off in pursuit.|$|E
2500|$|In {{their second}} appearance, [...] "", they capture and {{assimilate}} Captain Jean-Luc Picard into the collective by surgically altering him, creating Locutus of Borg, meaning [...] "he who has spoken" [...] or [...] "he who speaks", in Latin, fitting {{as he speaks}} to Federation humans for them. After this, life-form assimilation becomes much more prominent in their overall behavior, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>learn</b> about the nuances in tactics, {{as well as what}} they consider diplomacy with the human race.|$|E
2500|$|Frith {{relocated}} to the United States in 1997 to become Composer-in-Residence at Mills College in Oakland, California. In 1999 {{he was appointed}} the Luther B. Marchant Professor of Composition in the Music Department at Mills, where he currently teaches composition, contemporary performance, and improvisation. While he had never studied music in college, Frith's credentials of over forty years of continuous practice and self-discovery got him the position. He has, however, maintained that [...] "most of my students are better qualified to teach composition than I am," [...] and that he learns as much from them <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>learn</b> from him.|$|E

2500|$|A triad of core symptoms, namely inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity {{characterize}} attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Individuals with ADHD often experience {{problems with}} organization, discipline, and setting priorities, and these difficulties often persist from childhood through adulthood. In {{both children and}} adults with ADHD, an underlying executive dysfunction involving the prefrontal regions and other interconnected subcortical structures has been found. As a result, people with ADHD commonly perform more poorly than matched controls on interference control, mental flexibility and semantic verbal fluency. [...] Also, a more central impairment in self-regulation is noted in cases of ADHD. However, some research has suggested {{the possibility that the}} severity of executive dysfunction in individuals with ADHD declines with age <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>learn</b> to compensate for the aforementioned deficits. Thus, a decrease in executive dysfunction in adults with ADHD as compared to children with ADHD is thought reflective of compensatory strategies employed on behalf of the adults (e.g. using schedules to organize tasks) rather than neurological differences.|$|E

Michael Weatherly disclosed, [...] "The way this season is ending, and what's gonna happen with Ziva and Tony and Rivkin, it's pretty massive and explosive, and it's gonna span four episodes." [...] De Pablo added, [...] "We could not be farther away from kissing. I'm telling you, it's not 'I hate you' [...] anger; it's 'I want to kill you' anger. Like, 'I want to shoot you in the head, but instead I'm gonna put my gun on your knee' anger….He does something to her that is almost unforgivable. However, the reason he does it is because he truly believes it's going to help her. Little does he know that he almost kills her." [...] When asked how the storyline would affect Tony and Ziva's interactions, Tadros replied, [...] "I think that love can hurt and heal. In this case, we'll have opportunity to see both of those things take place. I don't want to say too much, but... I think it will only make their connection stronger, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>learn</b> {{a lot more about}} each other." ...|$|E
