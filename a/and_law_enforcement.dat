5|$|Targeted Killing in International Law is a {{book about}} the {{legality}} of targeted killing, written by Nils Melzer. It was first published by Oxford University Press in May 2008.

Melzer argues that directly after the September 11 attacks in the United States, perceptions of the tactic became more positive.|$|E

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The {{free flow of information}} among federal, state, <b>and</b> local <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> agencies could prove vital to fighting the war on terrorism. State <b>and</b> local <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> officials are key stakeholders in the United States' efforts to combat terrorism, and as such, they may require access to classified national security information to help prevent or respond to terrorist attacks. In order to gain access to such information, state <b>and</b> local <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> officials generally need federal security clearances. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) grants security clearances and shares classified information with state <b>and</b> local <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> officials. Immediately following September 11, 2001, some state <b>and</b> local <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> officials expressed frustration with the complexity of the process for obtaining security clearances. Others expressed frustration with the length of time it took to obtain a security clearance. These frustrations exacerbated the general concern among <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> stakeholders that the lack of security clearances could impede the flow of critical information from the FBI to {{the state and local level}}, from the state and local level to the FBI, and laterally from one state or local agency to another. In turn, this potential lack of access to critical terrorism-related information might place local <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> officials at a disadvantage in their efforts to respond to or combat a terrorist threat. The Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, Senate Committee on the Judiciary asked us to examine several issues regarding the FBI's process for granting security clearances to state <b>and</b> local <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> officials. This report provides information on: (1) the FBI's process for granting security clearances to state <b>and</b> local <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> officials, (2) the extent to which the FBI has met its time frame goals for processing security clearance applications for state <b>and</b> local <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> officials <b>and</b> factors that could affect the timely processing of security clearance applications, and (3) efforts undertaken by the FBI to enhance its security clearance and information-sharing processes with state <b>and</b> local <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> officials. ...|$|R
5|$|The L191 (also {{formerly}} {{called the}} SS191) is a tracer cartridge designed for easier bullet spotting in dim light. Combustible chemicals packed {{in the rear}} of the L191 projectile create a light trail visible up to 200m (219yd). The L191 has been manufactured with red and red-on-black tips. The performance and trajectory of the L191 is identical to the SS190. For this reason, it is also classified by the ATF as armor-piercing handgun ammunition, and its sale is currently restricted by FN to military <b>and</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> customers.|$|E

While developed and initially marketed as a PDW, {{it can also be}} considered a submachine gun or compact assault rifle. The standard selective fire P90 is restricted to military <b>and</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> customers, but since 2005, a semi-automatic version has been offered to civilian shooters as the PS90.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the attacks, many governments across the world passed {{legislation}} to combat terrorism. In Germany, where several of the 9/11 terrorists had resided and taken advantage of that country's liberal asylum policies, two major anti-terrorism packages were enacted.

The second addressed the effectiveness and communication of intelligence <b>and</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement.</b> Canada passed the Canadian Anti-Terrorism Act, that nation's first anti-terrorism law. The United Kingdom passed the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 and the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005. New Zealand enacted the Terrorism Suppression Act 2002.|$|E

Behan tended to ignore the Earps' complaints about the McLaurys' and Clantons' horse thieving and cattle rustling. The Earps were known to bend the law in their favor when it affected their gambling and saloon interests, which earned them further enmity with the Cowboy faction.|$|E
5|$|The SS190 FMJ, a {{refinement}} of the SS90, {{was introduced in}} 1993. It offered superior performance over the prototype projectile as well as slightly reduced length. The latter change allowed it to be used more conveniently in the Five-seven pistol, also being developed at that time. Fired from the P90, the SS190 propels a 2.0-g (31grain) bullet at a muzzle velocity of roughly 715m/s (2,350 ft/s). It has a steel penetrator and an aluminum core. The SS190 has been manufactured with a plain, black, and a black-on-white tip color. It is classified by the ATF as armor-piercing (AP) handgun ammunition, and its sale is currently restricted by FN to military <b>and</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement</b> customers.|$|E

5|$|By the 14thcentury, Norwich {{was one of}} {{the largest}} and most prosperous cities in England, and Norwich Market was a major trading hub. Control of, and income from, the market was ceded by the monarchy to the city of Norwich in 1341, from which time it {{provided}} a significant source of income for the local council. Freed from royal control, the market was reorganised to benefit the city as much as possible. Norwich and the surrounding region were devastated by plague and famine in the latter half of the 14thcentury, with the population falling by over 50%. Following the plague years, Norwich came under the control of local merchants and the economy was rebuilt. In the early 15thcentury, a Guildhall was built next to the market to serve as a centre for local government <b>and</b> <b>law</b> <b>enforcement.</b> The largest surviving mediaeval civic building in Britain outside London, it remained the seat of local government until 1938 and in use as a law court until 1985.|$|E
