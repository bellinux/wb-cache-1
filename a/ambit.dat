5|$|Another problem {{encountered}} when {{applying the}} rational nexus test {{is that of}} over- and under-inclusiveness. Under-inclusiveness occurs when the legislative classification fails to embrace all persons within the <b>ambit</b> of the objective sought to be achieved by the law. On the other hand, over-inclusiveness occurs when the classification not only embraces persons within the <b>ambit</b> of the legislative objective, but also persons outside it. Both over- and under-inclusiveness are currently tolerated in Singapore under the rational nexus test, as a classification can still bear a rational relation to the legislative objective notwithstanding that it embraces more or less persons than its object requires.|$|E
5|$|In Taw Cheng Kong, the {{respondent}} challenged his conviction for corruption {{on the ground}} that section 37 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, which extends the effect of the Act to corrupt acts by Singapore citizens (but not non-citizens) occurring outside Singapore, discriminated against citizens and thus violated Article 12(1). The Court of Appeal held that the distinction drawn by the section 37 between citizens and non-citizens who are abroad is valid as it is a reasonable means of achieving the Act's object, which is to address acts of corruption taking place outside Singapore but affecting events within it. The exclusion of non-citizens from the <b>ambit</b> of section 37 observes international comity and the sovereignty of other nations.|$|E
5|$|In {{the absence}} of officially {{recognized}} diagnostic criteria, and beyond the <b>ambit</b> of the discourse on a broader set of criteria discussed above, the term attachment disorder has been increasingly used by some clinicians {{to refer to a}} broader set of children whose behavior may be affected by lack of a primary attachment figure, a seriously unhealthy attachment relationship with a primary caregiver, or a disrupted attachment relationship. Although there are no studies examining diagnostic accuracy, concern is expressed as to the potential for over-diagnosis based on broad checklists and 'snapshots'. This form of therapy, including diagnosis and accompanying parenting techniques, is scientifically unvalidated and is not considered to be part of mainstream psychology or, despite its name, to be based on attachment theory, with which it is considered incompatible. It has been described as potentially abusive and a pseudoscientific intervention, that has resulted in tragic outcomes for children.|$|E

5|$|The {{plaintiff}} in Lines International {{argued that the}} guidelines adopted by the multi-agency committee {{set up by the}} PSA, STPB and GSB were invalid as the committee had no existence at law. The High Court held that there was nothing unlawful or even intrinsically wrong with these government agencies setting up such a committee to discuss matters of relevance to their respective jurisdictions as long as each agency made its own decisions within the <b>ambit</b> of its own statutory powers. The notion that such a committee fettered PSA's discretion was dismissed by a further finding of fact that the ad-hoc committee had not acted as an entity in itself. Enforcement and appropriate action were left to the agencies. A meeting attended by the plaintiff's representatives at which the guidelines relating to cruises-to-nowhere were announced was facilitated by a moderator rather than a chairperson, and each of the agencies read out guidelines which they themselves would be adopting and implementing.|$|E

5000|$|The {{behavior}} of California sheephead {{is shaped by}} the daily cycle of light, twilight, and dark. [...] Diurnal fishes, like the sheephead, make a round trip between their refuges and foraging areas twice a day, and additional daily trips may be made by breeding fishes to spawning sites. This elaborate diel timing of movements {{is driven by the}} need to forage or mate while minimizing predation. [...] Patterns in the movement of California sheephead are mediated by fish sex and size; for example, large males will exhibit higher site fidelity than females. [...] However, males also show wider <b>ambits</b> than females, and the size of their <b>ambits</b> changes seasonally. [...] During spawning season, males show a daily increase in their <b>ambits</b> during a period of potential spawning, and also make daily journeys offshore into deeper water. [...] Females (which would be expected to move more frequently among male territories) do not expand their <b>ambits</b> significantly during this same period. [...] Each of the movements offshore by males is followed by a return to nearshore habitat prior to twilight, suggesting the occupation of a spawning territory at that time. [...] At twilight, continuing to about 10 to 15 minutes after sunset, the degree of activity above the reef rapidly decreases and sheephead seek shelter for the night; this ‘quiet’ period is a time of major activity for larger reef predators.|$|R
