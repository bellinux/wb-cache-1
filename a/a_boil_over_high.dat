The pepper {{is famous for its}} extreme spiciness and {{plays an important role in}} tasting the dish. Cellophane noodles are soaked in water. The cooked chicken is simmered with a sauce made from ganjang, mullyeot (물엿, syrup-like condiment), sugar, and pepper in the broth. Slices of shiitake, and diced carrots, potatoes, and other vegetables are added in the pot and <b>boiled</b> <b>over</b> <b>high</b> heat for ten minutes. Whilst the carrots and potatoes are almost getting cooked, a little amount of wheat flour and spinach, sliced cucumber, scallions and the noodles are added to the pot as well. After cooking, the dish is put on a plate and sesame seeds are spread over it.|$|R

40|$|Housework {{that women}} do has no lasting effects, {{produces}} nothing tangible, gives no sense of closure and, for this reason, it is perceived as trivial, mindlessly repetitive, and invisible. However, examining texts by two Latvian women writers Regīna Ezera and Inga Ābele, {{it can be argued}} that not only the social context of a woman’s situation is inscribed through her domesticity, but something important about female consciousness is also revealed. Employing various household items – <b>a</b> kettle <b>boiling</b> <b>over,</b> broken glass, <b>an</b> old washing machine, linen towels, etc. – writers mirror the internal emotions of their women characters through vignettes from everyday life. Seemingly insignificant female-driven domesticity serves as a setting where it is possible for women to unfold heavy memories and tell their stories, giving shape to relationships between women. And domesticity’s ability to bring not just physical order, but also link matter to spirit and tie connections with nature and the self is emphasized...|$|R

He was named the Dally M Fullback of the Year in the 2004 NRL season, where he scored a career best 18 tries for the season. He also won the Harry Sunderland Medal as the player's player of the year. Mini went on to play at fullback for the Roosters in their 16–13 loss to the Bulldogs in the 2004 NRL Grand Final. It was the Roosters third Grand Final loss in four games since 2000. Minichiello was selected in the Australian team to go and compete in the end of season 2004 Rugby League Tri-Nations tournament.

5000|$|Quality {{standards}} {{refer to}} a brake fluid's [...] "dry" [...] and [...] "wet" [...] boiling points.

This is several (single digit) percent, varying from formulation to formulation. Glycol-ether (DOT 3, 4, and 5.1) brake fluids are hygroscopic (water absorbing), which means they absorb moisture from the atmosphere under normal humidity levels.

Propaganda also publicised that pregnant women could get orange juice and vitamin pills by bringing their ration books and medical certificate to the Food Office.
