5|$|When we came {{to record}} it in the studio we {{struggled}} because there was something just not quite right about it and I wasn't happy about where we'd left it and where we were happy to leave it and we couldn't put our finger on what it was {{and so it was}} a really nice day one day, me and Chris were just trying, I was actually just trying to record bass at the time and me and Chris were just sitting down trying to brainstorm it and work out what was wrong and so I started trying to just do a few different bass lines and stuff. Between the two of us we came up with just this kind of groove, which stays on the same note as opposed to change, it's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll along in a much more fluid way. It was a bit mechanical before and it's just interesting how something small like that can really change the whole vibe of a song. It was just nice because from there on it was one of our favourite tracks <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>almost</b> didn't get on the record but it's now one of our favourite tracks.|$|E

No one does it like them <b>and,</b> <b>it</b> <b>almost</b> goes without saying, no one does it better." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{story of}} Adam causing Ashley's {{miscarriage}} was named [...] "editor's choice" [...] by the magazine. Engen {{was nominated for}} a SoapCentral Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in 2009. Some fans were upset that Adam and Rafe's [...] "sex scene" [...] was implied rather than shown onscreen; Branco spoke out about the issue, saying, [...] "ilming a sex scene between a straight and gay man could come off as offensive. Firstly, Adam would have to appear uncomfortable in the situation which could anger gay right groups, etc." [...] Muhney also approved of the decision not to show the sex scene, saying, [...] "or me, the way it was done was tasteful <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>almost</b> makes the audience wonder what exactly happened. You can create that in your head and try to interpret it by how the characters reacted afterwards." ...|$|E

500|$|Several of Miyazaki's films feature anti-war themes. Daisuke Akimoto of Animation Studies {{categorized}} Porco Rosso as [...] "anti-war propaganda"; he {{felt that}} the main character, Porco, transforms into a pig partly due to his extreme distate of militarism. Akimoto also argues that The Wind Rises reflects Miyazaki's [...] "antiwar pacifism", despite the latter stating that the film does not attempt to [...] "denounce" [...] war. Schellhase also identifies Princess Mononoke as a pacifist film due to the protagonist, Ashitaka; instead of joining the campaign of revenge against humankind, as his ethnic history would lead him to do, Ashitaka strives for peace. David Loy and Linda Goodhew argue that both Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind and Princess Mononoke do not depict traditional evil, but the Buddhist roots of evil: greed, ill will, and delusion; according to Buddhism, the roots of evil must transform into [...] "generosity, loving-kindness and wisdom" [...] in order to overcome suffering, and both Nausicaä and Ashitaka accomplish this. When characters in Miyazaki's films are forced to engage in violence, it is shown as being a difficult task; in Howl's Moving Castle, Howl is forced to fight an inescapable battle in defense of those he loves, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>almost</b> destroys him, though he is ultimately saved by Sophie's love and bravery.|$|E
500|$|Dipteran larvae have no jointed, [...] "true legs", {{but some}} {{dipteran}} larvae, such as species of Simuliidae, Tabanidae and Vermileonidae, have prolegs adapted {{to hold onto}} a substrate in flowing water, host tissues or prey. The majority of dipterans are oviparous and lay batches of eggs, but some species are ovoviviparous, where the larvae starting development inside the eggs before they hatch or viviparous, the larvae hatching and maturing {{in the body of}} the mother before being externally deposited. These are found especially in groups that have larvae dependent on food sources that are short-lived or are accessible for brief periods. This is widespread in some families such as the Sarcophagidae. In Hylemya strigosa (Anthomyiidae) the larva moults to the second instar before hatching, and in Termitoxenia (Phoridae) females have incubation pouches, and a full developed third instar larva is deposited by the adult <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>almost</b> immediately pupates with no freely feeding larval stage. The tsetse fly (as well as other Glossinidae, Hippoboscidae, Nycteribidae and Streblidae) exhibits adenotrophic viviparity; a single fertilised egg is retained in the oviduct and the developing larva feeds on glandular secretions. When fully grown, the female finds a spot with soft soil and the larva works its way out of the oviduct, buries itself and pupates. Some flies like Lundstroemia parthenogenetica (Chironomidae) reproduce by thelytokous parthenogenesis, and some gall midges have larvae that can produce eggs (paedogenesis).|$|E
2500|$|Houdini {{performed}} {{at least three}} variations on a buried alive stunt during his career. The first was near Santa Ana, California in 1915, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>almost</b> cost Houdini his life. Houdini was buried, without a casket, in a pit of earth six feet deep. He became exhausted and panicked while trying to dig {{his way to the}} surface and called for help. When his hand finally broke the surface, he fell unconscious and had to be pulled from the grave by his assistants. Houdini wrote in his diary that the escape was [...] "very dangerous" [...] and that [...] "the weight of the earth is killing." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sonically, [...] "Mercy" [...] blends Southern rap {{elements}} with dancehall vibes. [...] "Mercy" [...] {{starts with}} a vocal sampling from the late Fuzzy Jones. The island-laced intro gives way to an eerie-sounding bass track, sparse drums, piano keys and a Scarface film sample. The track features an undulating beat, [...] "threaded through the entire song <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>almost</b> mimics an eerie piano. There's also an omnipotent voiceover that shows up every , too." [...] Playing off a hook (sampled from YB's song [...] "Lambo") about a [...] "two-seat Lamborghini". West's posse references Sarah Palin, Rick James and Ms. Pac-Man. At about three minutes in, the song switches up and turns into an electronic dance music track. The beat then slows down, and [...] "despite the jarring difference in timing, it's like a song within a song." ...|$|E

5000|$|Margaret Pomeranz {{objected to}} the central sexual {{relationship}} of the film. [...] "I know I sound like a Victorian aunt, but I really hated that betrayal of that relationship between Alan and Steph. I mean, it's not the older man, younger woman thing, <b>it</b> isn't, <b>it's</b> <b>almost</b> like he's her father <b>and</b> <b>it's</b> <b>almost</b> like an incestuous relationship. A film takes a step like that <b>and</b> <b>it</b> takes me where I really don't want to go. I reacted against everybody, I felt alienated from those characters at that moment." ...|$|R
