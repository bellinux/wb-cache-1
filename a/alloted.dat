Rifkin speculates that the composition's short coda also [...] "seems like a farewell, {{as if he knew}} how brief and bleak was the time still <b>alloted</b> him." [...] In 1979 Alan Rich in the New York Magazine wrote that by giving artists like Rifkin the opportunity to put Joplin's music on record Nonesuch Records [...] "created, almost alone, the Scott Joplin revival." ...|$|E

6000|$|On this {{occasion}} the new bishop took his seat {{for the first}} time in the throne <b>alloted</b> to him. New scarlet cushions and drapery had been prepared, with new gilt binding and new fringe. The old carved oak-wood of the throne, ascending with its numerous grotesque pinnacles half-way up to the roof of the choir, had been washed, and dusted, and rubbed, and it all looked very smart. Ah! how often sitting there, in happy early days, on those lowly benches in front of the altar, have I whiled away the tedium of a sermon in considering how best I might thread my way up amidst those wooden towers and climb safely to the topmost pinnacle! ...|$|E

5000|$|Robert <b>Allot</b> {{became a}} [...] "freeman" [...] of the Stationers Company (a full {{member of the}} London guild of booksellers) on 9 November 1625. <b>Allot</b> was a younger son of an Edward <b>Allot</b> of Crigleston in Yorkshire, near Wakefield. Robert's brother, another Edward <b>Allot</b> (died 1636, age 33), was a surgeon and Bachelor of Medicine at the University of Cambridge. Nineteenth-century {{commentators}} sometimes confused Robert <b>Allot,</b> the publisher who died in 1635, with an earlier Robert <b>Allot,</b> a minor poet and fellow of St. John's College, Cambridge and Linacre Professor of Physic, who edited the verse anthology England's Parnassus (1600). In actuality, the two Robert <b>Allots</b> were uncle and nephew.|$|R
6000|$|The bishop {{returned}} {{on the eve}} of the Ullathorne party, and {{was received}} at home with radiant smiles by the partner of all his cares. On his arrival he crept up to his dressing-room with somewhat of a palpitating heart; he had overstayed his <b>alloted</b> time by three days, and was not without much fear of penalties. Nothing, however, could be more affectionately cordial than the greeting he received; the girls came out and kissed him in a manner that was quite soothing to his spirit; and Mrs. Proudie, [...] "albeit, unused to the melting mood," [...] squeezed him in her arms and almost in words called him her dear, darling, good, pet, little bishop. All this was a very pleasant surprise.|$|E

It {{was known in}} the Ashanti camp that the Fanti kings had been ordered to raise contingents, and that a white officer had been <b>alloted</b> to each to assist him in this work. The Ashantis, however, had no fear {{whatever}} on this score. The twenty thousand natives who occupied the country south of the Prah had all been driven from their homes by the invaders, and had scattered among the towns and villages on the seacoast, where vast numbers had died from the ravages of smallpox. The kings {{had little or no}} authority over them, and it was certain that no native force, capable in any way of competing with the army of the assailants, could be raised.|$|E

The heavy lives we see and know are only links in a golden chain that shall draw us safe to the haven of our rest; steep and painful steps are they whereby we climb to the <b>alloted</b> palace of our joy.

Of Holly also I desired to learn whether his wisdom could pierce through my disguise, and how near he stood to truth. It was for this reason that I suffered him to see me draw the lock from the satchel on thy breast and to hear me wail over thee yonder in the Rest-house.

60|$|This {{was indeed}} the case. The camp had been erected in a {{sheltered}} valley, through which ran a stream that supplied the needs of man and horses. The tents were placed in regular order, that of the duke in the centre, those of his chief nobles in order of rank on either side. Behind was a line {{for the use of}} the court officials, pages, and knights of less degree, while the soldiers would sleep in the open. As the party rode up a chamberlain with three or four assistants met them. Each was provided with lists containing the names of all the duke's following, and these were at once conducted to the tents <b>alloted</b> to them, so that in a few minutes all were housed without the slightest confusion or trouble. The squires of the knights and nobles and the attendants of the officers and pages at once took the horses and picketed them in lines behind the tents, rubbing them down and cleaning them with the greatest care, and then supplying them with forage from the piles that had that morning been brought in from the neighbouring farms. Fuel in abundance had also been stacked. A number of cooks had come on with the tent equipage, and supper was already prepared for the duke and his party, while animals had been slaughtered and cut up, and the men-at-arms soon had the joints hanging over their bivouac fires.|$|E
6000|$|To {{be quite}} honest, I do not entirely believe that Orator Bryan's tongue had {{anything}} to do with it. I have long been convinced that personal persuasion is a matter of animal magnetism--what in its more obvious manifestation we now call hypnotism. At the back of the words and the postures, and independent of them, is that secret, mysterious power, addressing, not the ear, not the eye, nor, through them, the understanding, but through its matching quality in the auditor, captivating the will and enslaving it That is how persuasion is effected; the spoken words merely supply a pretext for surrender. They enable us to yield without loss of our self-esteem, in the delusion that we are conceding to reason what is really extorted by charm. The words are necessary, too, to point out what the orator wishes us to think, if we are not already apprised of it. When the nature of his power is better understood and frankly recognized, he can spare himself the toil of talking. The parliamentary debate of the future will probably be conducted in silence, and with only such gestures as go by the name of [...] "passes." [...] The chairman will state the question before the House and the side, affirmative or negative, to be taken by the honorable member entitled to the floor. That gentleman will rise, train his compelling orbs upon the miscreants in opposition, execute a few passes and exhaust his <b>alloted</b> time in looking at them. He will then yield to an honorable member of dissenting views. The preponderance in magnetic power and hypnotic skill will be manifest in the voting. The advantages of the method are as plain as the nose on an elephant's face. The [...] "arena" [...] will no longer [...] "ring" [...] with anybody's [...] "rousing speech," [...] to the irritating abridgment of the inalienable right to pursuit of sleep. Honorable members will lack provocation to hurl allegations and cuspidors. Pitchforking statesmen and tosspot reformers will be unable to play at pitch-and-toss with reputations not submitted for the performance. In short, the congenial asperities of debate will be so mitigated that the honorable member from Hades will retire permanently from the hauls of legislation.|$|E
