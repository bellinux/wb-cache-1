Registered Number Student. 2813123114. 2016. “The Effectiveness {{of using}} Look <b>and</b> <b>Say</b> Method in Teaching reading to Increase Students’ Reading Achievement For The Fourth Grade The Students Of MI Baiturrahman Suwaluh Academic Year 2015 / 2016 ”. Sarjana Thesis. English Education Department. Faculty of Tarbiyah and Teacher Training. State Islamic Institute (IAIN) of Tulungagung. Advisor: Dr Erna Iftanti, M. Pd. Keywords: Effectiveness, Look <b>and</b> <b>Say,</b> Reading Skill Reading {{is one of}} {{language}} skill that most important between another language skill. By reading students can rich their knowledge as the input of the learning process because reading {{is a source of}} knowledge and also the important role in students’ achievement. One of the methods that used in teaching reading for young learner is Look <b>and</b> <b>Say.</b> Look <b>and</b> <b>Say</b> is method for reading to children learns to recognize whole words or sentences rather than individual sounds. In Look <b>and</b> <b>Say</b> method used flashcards with short sentences written on them and also can accompanied with related picture. In this method, the teacher <b>say</b> the sentence <b>and</b> ask the students to repeat it while pointing and looking at each sentence as he/she repeats what the teacher said. The teacher also can collaborate with any kind of game in this method. The formulation of the research problems were: 1) How is the students’ reading achievement before being taught by using “Look <b>and</b> <b>Say</b> Method”? 2) How is the students’ reading achievement after being taught by using “Look <b>and</b> <b>Say</b> Method”? 3) Is there any significant difference of the reading achievement of the students before and after being taught by using “Look <b>and</b> <b>Say</b> Method”? The purpose of this study were to: 1) find out the students’ achievement in reading before being thought by using “Look <b>and</b> <b>Say</b> Method”, 2) find out the students’ achievement in reading after being thought by using “Look <b>and</b> <b>Say</b> Method”, 3) find out whether the use of “Look <b>and</b> <b>Say</b> Method” gives significant different of the students’ reading achievement before and after being taught by using “Look <b>and</b> <b>Say</b> Method”. This study used quantitative approach with pre-experimental design. The participants of the study comprised 9 students from the fourth grade students of MI Baiturrahman Suwaluh. They were purposefully assigned as the sample of the study. The research instrument in this study is test, which consists of pretest and posttest. And the data collected through test was analyzed using T-test formula with IBM SPSS Statistic 22. The finding in the research showed that significant differences between the result of students achievement before and after they are taught using look <b>and</b> <b>say</b> method in pretest and posttest score. The mean of post-test scores (90. 4) was larger than the mean of pre-test scores (66. 7). From statistical calculation, it was confirmed that the value of tobtained (- 5. 667) was larger than ttable (- 2. 306). Also, the way to test wether the null hypothesis could be rejected was by comparing p-value with the standard level of significance, 0. 05. The convention to reject the null hypothesis is when the p-value of the obtained statistics is less than 0. 05 (Baalnaves & Calputi, 2001). The finding showed that p-value was less than 0. 05 (0. 000 < 0. 05). Thus, there was enough evidence indicating that the null hypothesis could be rejected, and it could be concluded that using Look <b>and</b> <b>Say</b> method was effective to increase students’ reading skill...|$|R
