After consultation with Baden-Powell, four separate Scouting organisations {{were created in}} 1936. These were The Boy Scouts <b>Association</b> (<b>for</b> whites), The African Boy Scouts <b>Association</b> (<b>for</b> blacks), The Coloured Boy Scouts <b>Association</b> (<b>for</b> coloureds) and The Indian Boy Scouts <b>Association</b> (<b>for</b> Indians).
