The dark subject matter, the dark master stuff. It's another way of writing, a fresh one to me." [...] He also summarizes the lyrics: [...] "It's a story about somebody who loses himself and end struggles with the darkness, symbolized by the Dark Master.

500|$|Madonna worked {{primarily}} with Orbit after Guy Oseary, Maverick Records's partner, phoned Orbit {{and suggested that}} he send some songs to the singer. He sent a 13-track digital audio tape (DAT) to Madonna, and [...] "Frozen" [...] was among these tracks. [...] "I was {{a huge fan of}} William's earlier records. [...] I also loved all the remixes he did for me and I was interested in fusing a kind of futuristic sound but also using lots of Indian and Moroccan influences <b>and</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> and I wanted it to sound old and new at the same time", Madonna said. The singer drew inspiration from Bernardo Bertolucci's 1990 British-Italian drama film, The Sheltering Sky, which dealt with a couple trying to save their marriage during a trip to Africa. She wanted to have the [...] "whole Moroccan/orchestral/super-romantic/man-carrying-the-woman-he-loves-across-the-desert vibe" [...] for the track. Still continuing work with Leonard on some of the tracks, Madonna asked him to give her a composition with [...] "tribal feel, something really lush and romantic". They composed the melody on the DAT and recorded the demo, which stretched to over 10 minutes due to Madonna continuing writing the track.|$|E

[...] Producer of Holby City, Simon Harper, also announced in an interview plans for a crossover event with sister show Holby City in celebration for Casualty's thirtieth anniversary.

[...] Nicole later told Marilyn Chambers (Emily Symons) about the baby and she offered to adopt it. James later revealed that when she joined Home and Away she told the writers that they can do anything with her character, except make her pregnant.

500|$|After {{abandoning the}} songs {{she had written}} with Babyface, Madonna turned to {{musician}} Rick Nowels, who had previously co-written songs with Stevie Nicks and Celine Dion. The collaboration produced seven songs in nine days, but those songs also did not display the album's future electronic musical direction. Three of the songs, [...] "The Power of Good-Bye", [...] "To Have and Not to Hold" [...] and [...] "Little Star", appear on the album. Madonna then began writing songs with Leonard, who had produced many songs for Madonna in the late 1980s. Unlike her previous albums, Leonard's song writing collaborations were accompanied by very little studio input. Madonna believed that Leonard's production [...] "would have lent the songs more of a Peter Gabriel vibe", a sound {{that she did not}} want for the album. Guy Oseary, chairman of Maverick Records, then phoned British electronic musician William Orbit, and suggested that he send some songs to Madonna. Orbit sent a 13-track digital audio tape to Madonna. [...] "I was a huge fan of William's earlier records, Strange Cargo 1 and 2 and all that.
