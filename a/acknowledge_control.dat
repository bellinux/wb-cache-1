50|$|As {{a part of}} the Scramble for Africa, France {{aimed to}} {{establish}} a continuous west-east axis across the continent, in contrast with the proposed British north-south axis. Tensions between Britain and France heightened in Africa. At several points war seemed possible, but no outbreak occurred. The most serious episode was the Fashoda Incident of 1898. French troops tried to claim an area in the Southern Sudan, and a British force purporting to act {{in the interests of the}} Khedive of Egypt arrived to confront them. Under heavy pressure the French withdrew, implicitly <b>acknowledging</b> Anglo-Egyptian <b>control</b> over the area.

A lengthy war ensued between the Yucateco forces in the north-west of the Yucatán and the independent Maya in the south-east.
