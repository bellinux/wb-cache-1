25|$|From {{the second}} verse, Rihanna {{and her boyfriend}} are seen happily running amok in a supermarket, pushing each other in <b>a</b> <b>shopping</b> <b>cart</b> and {{spraying}} canned drinks at each other. This scene is interrupted with Rihanna in a Pontiac Trans Am outside with her boyfriend who begins to recklessly drive in circles, resulting in Rihanna asking him to stop the car which ensues into an argument between the pair. The video then progressively shows the couple experiencing mounting difficulties in their relationship. Rihanna removes herself from the car and returns moments later where we see her boyfriend grab her chin to look at him, suggesting that he is domestically violent towards her. During the final chorus Rihanna can be seen vomiting {{what appears to be}} pink and white streamers; she is also seen passed out on the street while her boyfriend tries to revive her. In another scene, Rihanna is seen lying on a couch while her boyfriend tattoos the word 'MINE' on her backside.

The clip ends with Rihanna curled up in the corner of a room, crying.|$|E

500|$|Silent Hill 2 also {{incorporates}} some {{references to}} real-life events. In the original scenario, the developers designed Maria and James with dual personalities: Maria's other personality was [...] "Mary", {{a reference to}} Mary Jane Kelly, Jack the Ripper's last victim, while James' was [...] "Joseph", a reference {{to one of the}} Jack the Ripper suspects. Eddie Dombrowski's name was taken from actor Eddie Murphy during the beginning phases of production when Eddie was originally designed with a pleasantly optimistic personality. The name of Angela Orosco was derived from Angela Bennett, the name of the protagonist in the 1995 film The Net, and Laura's from the 1970 novel No Language But a Cry by Richard D'Ambrosio. The developers satirized guns in American society by allowing James to find a handgun in <b>a</b> <b>shopping</b> <b>cart.</b> There are also indications that the layout of Silent Hill was based to a certain extent on the town of San Bruno, California.|$|E

2500|$|The use of {{the generic}} term light rail avoids some serious {{incompatibilities}} between British and American English. The word [...] tram, for instance, is generally used in the UK and many former British colonies to refer to what is known in North America as a streetcar, but in North America tram can instead refer to an aerial tramway, or, {{in the case of}} the Disney amusement parks, even a land train. (The usual British term for an aerial tramway is [...] cable car, which in the US usually refers to a ground-level car pulled along by subterranean cables.) The word [...] trolley is often used as a synonym for streetcar in the United States, but is usually taken to mean a cart, particularly <b>a</b> <b>shopping</b> <b>cart,</b> in the UK and elsewhere. Many North American transportation planners reserve streetcar for traditional vehicles that operate exclusively in mixed traffic on city streets, while they use light rail to refer to more modern vehicles operating mostly in exclusive rights of way, since they may operate both side-by-side targeted at different passenger groups.|$|E
