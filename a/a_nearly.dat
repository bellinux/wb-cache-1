5|$|It is the co-existence of the long-known large ring-like {{feature in}} the gas of Messier 31, {{together}} with this newly discovered inner ring-like structure, offset from the barycenter, that suggested <b>a</b> <b>nearly</b> head-on collision with the satellite M32, a milder version of the Cartwheel encounter.|$|E

5|$|Next, the metamorphosed Precambrian {{basement}} rocks were uplifted and <b>a</b> <b>nearly</b> 500-million-year-long {{gap in the}} geologic record, a major unconformity, {{affected the}} region.

5|$|North American {{air space}} {{was closed for}} several days after the attacks and air travel {{decreased}} upon its reopening, leading to <b>a</b> <b>nearly</b> 20% cutback in air travel capacity, and exacerbating financial problems in the struggling U.S. airline industry.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium iodides {{result from}} the oxides and {{aluminium}} iodide or ammonium iodide heated to 600°C. Protactinium(III) iodide was obtained by heating protactinium(V) iodide in vacuum. As with oxides, protactinium forms mixed halides with alkali metals. Among those, most remarkable is Na3PaF8 where protactinium ion is symmetrically surrounded by 8 F− ions which form <b>a</b> <b>nearly</b> perfect cube.|$|E

5|$|A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is <b>a</b> <b>nearly</b> {{complete}} rewrite of {{the abandoned}} novel Stephen Hero. Joyce attempted to burn the original manuscript {{in a fit of}} rage during an argument with Nora, though to his subsequent relief it was rescued by his sister. A Künstlerroman, Portrait is a heavily autobiographical coming-of-age novel depicting the childhood and adolescence of protagonist Stephen Dedalus and his gradual growth into artistic self-consciousness. Some hints of the techniques Joyce frequently employed in later works, such as stream of consciousness, interior monologue, and references to a character's psychic reality rather than to his external surroundings are evident throughout this novel.|$|E
5|$|A mutant with <b>a</b> <b>nearly</b> indestructible {{layer of}} skin. In the film's early sequences, he is a {{formidable}} fighting man, but years later, due to a poor diet, has gained {{an enormous amount of}} weight. A fan of the X-Men movies, Durand contacted the producers for a role as soon as news of a new film came out. The suit went through six months of modifications, and had a tubing system inside to cool Durand down with ice water. David Harbour auditioned for the role, but was turned down for being too fat at the time.|$|E

The endocast features clarified the dissimilarity of the skull with those of Allosauroids and Coelurosaurs giving Cryolophosaurus a basal position in Theropoda.|$|E
