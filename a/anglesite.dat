5|$|Vanadinite {{occurs as}} a {{secondary}} mineral in the oxidized zone of lead-bearing deposits, the vanadium is leached from wall-rock silicates. Associated minerals include mimetite, pyromorphite, descloizite, mottramite, wulfenite, cerussite, <b>anglesite,</b> calcite, barite, and various iron oxide minerals.|$|E
5|$|The main lead-bearing mineral is galena (PbS), {{which is}} mostly found with zinc ores. Most other lead {{minerals}} {{are related to}} galena in some way; boulangerite, Pb5Sb4S11, is a mixed sulfide derived from galena; <b>anglesite,</b> PbSO4, {{is a product of}} galena oxidation; and cerussite or white lead ore, PbCO3, is a decomposition product of galena. Arsenic, tin, antimony, silver, gold, copper, and bismuth are common impurities in lead minerals.|$|E
25|$|The {{deposits}} include diverse secondary minerals such as arsenopyrite, <b>anglesite,</b> baryte, bournonite, cerussite, chalcopyrite, freibergite, galena, mimetite, pyrite, pyromorphite, quartz, semseyite, sphalerite, stannite, tetrahedrite and wulfenite.|$|E
25|$|The sulfate {{minerals}} all {{contain the}} sulfate anion, 2−. They {{tend to be}} transparent to translucent, soft, and many are fragile. Sulfate minerals commonly form as evaporites, where they precipitate out of evaporating saline waters; alternative, sulfates {{can also be found}} in hydrothermal vein systems associated with sulfides, or as oxidation products of sulfides. Sulfates can be subdivided into anhydrous and hydrous minerals. The most common hydrous sulfate by far is gypsum, CaSO4⋅2H2O. It forms as an evaporite, and is associated with other evaporites such as calcite and halite; if it incorporates sand grains as it crystallizes, gypsum can form desert roses. Gypsum has very low thermal conductivity and maintains a low temperature when heated as it loses that heat by dehydrating; as such, gypsum is used as an insulator in materials such as plaster and drywall. The anhydrous equivalent of gypsum is anhydrite; it can form directly from seawater in highly arid conditions. The barite group has the general formula XSO4, where the X is a large 12-coordinated cation. Examples include barite (BaSO4), celestine (SrSO4), and <b>anglesite</b> (PbSO4); anhydrite {{is not part of the}} barite group, as the smaller Ca2+ is only in eight-fold coordination.|$|E
50|$|Within the {{weathering}} or oxidation zone galena alters to <b>anglesite</b> (lead sulfate) or cerussite (lead carbonate). Galena {{exposed to}} acid mine drainage can be oxidized to <b>anglesite</b> by naturally occurring bacteria and archaea, {{in a process}} similar to bioleaching.|$|E

50|$|A {{variety of}} {{infiltration}} or substitution pseudomorphism is called alteration, {{in which only}} partial replacement occurs. This happens typically when a mineral of one composition changes by chemical reaction to another of similar composition, retaining the original crystalline shape. An example is a change from galena (lead sulfide) to <b>anglesite</b> (lead sulfate). The resulting pseudomorph may contain an unaltered core of galena surrounded by <b>anglesite</b> that has the cubic crystal shape of galena.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anglesite</b> is {{a mineral}} of {{secondary}} origin, having been {{formed by the}} oxidation of galena in the upper parts of mineral lodes where these {{have been affected by}} weathering processes. At Monteponi the crystals encrust cavities in glistening granular galena; and from Leadhills, in Scotland, pseudomorphs of <b>anglesite</b> after galena are known. At most localities it is found as isolated crystals in the lead-bearing lodes, but at some places, in Australia and Mexico, it occurs as large masses, and is then mined as an ore of lead.|$|E
