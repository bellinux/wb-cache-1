25|$|In 2008 Aston {{introduced}} an aftermarket dealer approved upgrade path {{for power and}} handling of the 4.3-litre variants that maintained the warranty with Aston. The power upgrade was The V8 Vantage Power Upgrade, creating a more potent version of the Aston Martin 4.3-litre engine {{with an increase in}} Peak power of 20bhp to 400bhp while peak torque is increased by 10Nm to 420Nm. This consists of the fitting of the following revised components; manifold assembly (painted Crackle Black), valved <b>air</b> <b>box,</b> right and left hand side vacuum hose assemblies, engine bay fuse box link lead (ECU to fuse box), throttle body to manifold gasket, intake manifold gasket, fuel injector to manifold seal, and a manifold badge.|$|E

50|$|This {{regularly}} scheduled program, which <b>aired</b> <b>boxing</b> matches from St. Nicholas Arena in New York City on Monday nights, is notable {{for being the}} final program to air on DuMont.

50|$|Boxing from Eastern Parkway is an American sports program {{broadcast}} by the DuMont Television Network from May 1952 to May 1954.

50|$|The Formula 1 {{technical}} regulations were {{changed for the}} 1976 season - from the Spanish Grand Prix in May, the tall <b>air</b> <b>boxes</b> which had become popular would be banned. The rules therefore allowed Ferrari to continue to use the 312T for the opening 3 races of the 1976 season (Lauda won the first two and Regazzoni the third), before the introduction of its successor, a revised version called the 312T2.|$|R
50|$|Major {{differences}} between models included Single / Dual front disc brakes, Suspension, <b>Air</b> <b>box,</b> Carburettor (BD34, BD36), Paint schemes and branding (the XZ550 is branded as Vision in the US). As {{well as the}} full fairing, a smaller sport fairing was available, and offered as a purchase incentive for unfaired variants.|$|E
50|$|Because {{the engine}} is 2-stroke, opposed-piston, the engine {{features}} no heads or valves. The two camshafts on the engine provide timing for two injection pumps per cylinder. Porting allows exhaust gases to be expelled and scavenge air {{to be taken in}} by a positive <b>air</b> <b>box</b> pressure. Intake air is provided by an engine driven Roots blower or turbo-supercharger.|$|E
50|$|Modern engines universally have tuned intake tract volumes and {{associated}} resonance frequencies, {{designed to provide}} higher than atmospheric intake air pressure while the intake valves are open - increasing {{the density of the}} trapped air in the combustion chamber (higher compression).Modified engines often have the original <b>air</b> <b>box</b> {{and associated}} ducting removed and velocity stacks are installed as accessories.|$|E
5000|$|Boxing From Jamaica Arena was a TV sports series {{broadcast}} by the DuMont Television Network from September 1948 to 1949. The program <b>aired</b> <b>boxing</b> from Jamaica Arena in Queens, New York. The program aired Tuesday nights at 9pm ET and was 90 to 120 minutes long. [...] An earlier {{program of the}} same name had aired on June 30, 1941 as part of W2XBS's (now WNBC's) experimental program lineup.|$|R
5000|$|In its heyday, the Sunnyside Garden {{played host to}} such boxing greats as Floyd Patterson, Anthony Pugliese, Tony Canzoneri, Al Singer, Ruby Goldstein, and Billy Petrolle. [...] For {{some years}} it was home to the Golden Gloves tournaments. Famous wrestlers battled there too, notably Haystacks Calhoun, Cowboy Bill, Jim Londos (the Golden Greek), Stan Zybysko, Strangler Lewis, and Bruno Sammartino. The DuMont Television Network <b>aired</b> <b>Boxing</b> From Sunnyside Gardens from September 1949 to 1950.|$|R

50|$|The 1.8 liter {{displacement}} cars may not run an aftermarket {{air intake}} and must run a throttle restrictor, while the 1.6 liter displacement cars {{do not require}} a restrictor and may run a modified <b>air</b> <b>box.</b> The full rules for the class {{may be found in}} the current Spec Miata Category Specifications of the SCCA rule book, called the GCR (General Competition Rules & Specifications).|$|E
5000|$|Power: The {{engine is}} a {{controlled}} 5.0L V8 (R302ci for the Ford Falcon and 304ci for the Holden Commodore). Most {{parts of the}} engine are controlled and unlike the Australian Touring Cars (Supercars Championship) which uses fuel injection, the series uses a controlled carburettor. The other control parts for the engine are manifolds, exhausts, cam-shafts, rockers, air-filter/cold <b>air</b> <b>box</b> and ignition. The engines are rev-limited to 6400rpm. Top speed is 240 km/h.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{parts in the}} {{throttle}} linkage are also unique to the TR7 Sprint, most obviously the link plate between the two carburettors (just visible in Figure 2, and partially obscuring the inlet manifold in Figure 3), which was not fitted to the Dolomite Sprint; and the throttle lever/link rod (visible just over the <b>air</b> <b>box</b> in Figure 3), which looks {{the same as the}} TR7 part, but is longer to allow for the carbs being further apart.|$|E
50|$|The {{proposed}} {{ground is}} to seat 30,000 fans, including two 450 seat function rooms, 100 open <b>air</b> corporate <b>boxes</b> and 25 enclosed boxes.|$|R
50|$|The engine {{has several}} {{differences}} {{from the original}} KV6 including fly-by-wire throttle, a redesigned <b>air</b> filter <b>box</b> and a painted acoustic engine cover.|$|R

50|$|The {{production}} Katana of 1981 differed {{only slightly}} from the prototype; changes included a small wind deflector screen, paired mufflers, and black accent paint on the front fender and <b>air</b> <b>box</b> covers. Target's design philosophy - keeping components compact and close-fitting - was applied to {{all areas of the}} bike's design to reduce production costs, weight, and number of components required. Examples include the overlapping dials on the instrument cluster, and the offset petrol filler which allowed for a clean continuous seam weld on the tank.|$|E
5000|$|In 1955, a {{high-performance}} 100M model was introduced, with larger carburettors, a cold <b>air</b> <b>box</b> to increase engine air flow, high-lift camshaft and 8.1:1 compression pistons. It produced [...] at 4500 rpm. The front suspension was stiffened and the bonnet gained louvres, {{along with a}} bonnet belt. Approximately 70% of 100Ms were finished with a two-tone paint scheme, including one White over Red and another in Black over Pink for display at the 1955 London Motor Show. In all, 640 100Ms were built by the factory.|$|E
5000|$|The F4i's new {{bodywork}} {{carries a}} more racy look {{and provides a}} 3% reduction in drag. It also houses a new dual headlight front cowl design which uses 40% brighter H7 bulbs compared to the old H4 bulbs. [...] The headlights are dual multi-reflector units covered by a one-piece flexiglass lens. The turn stalks are shorter and the mirrors are now positioned higher {{and closer to the}} rider. The elimination of carburetors allowed for a slightly larger <b>air</b> <b>box</b> and a larger [...] fuel tank. And a fuel consumption of 36.7 mpg.|$|E
50|$|CBS had {{a renewed}} {{interest}} in boxing after losing the National Football Conference package to Fox following the 1993 season. In 1994, they had a new series of fights on Saturday or Sundays under the Eye on Sports banner. Tim Ryan (blow-by-blow) and Gil Clancy (color) were the commentators during this period. CBS continued <b>airing</b> <b>boxing</b> on a somewhat regular basis until 1998, by which time they had the NFL (after acquiring the American Football Conference package from NBC) and college football back on their slate.|$|R
50|$|There is a scene, with an {{accompanying}} song lyrics in the made-for-TV film That Day We Sang by Victoria Wood, first <b>aired</b> on <b>Boxing</b> Day 2014, depicting a Berni Inn in 1969.|$|R
