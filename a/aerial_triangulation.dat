40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the precision of GPS-coordinates of projection centres obtained in photogrammetric production in Poland. The second aim of the work was to estimate the reliability of this group of measurements in <b>aerial</b> <b>triangulations</b> performed for three scales of aerial photographs. The study was based on repeated processing of data from production blocks, in comply with conditions of a correct adjustment. Adjustments were preceded by the pre-adjustment detection of gross errors and improper division of data into GPS profiles. Production results originated from various measurement systems and adjustment softwares; and they were characterized by numerous imperfections related to functional and statistical model and being generally the result of the applied technologies. A set of 25 blocks was selected for testing, including three scales of aerial photographs: 1 : 13 000, 1 : 19 000 and 1 : 26 000, most frequently used in Poland. Number of photographs in one block varied from 136 to 3402, and the total number of photographs in all blocks was about 30 000. The corrected a priori standard deviation of GPScoordinates obtained from 25 adjustments reached 10. 7 cm on average. The analysis of global internal reliability of GPS-coordinate for particular scales revealed that in blocks of photographs at scale 1 : 13 000 the average redundancy numbers reached 0. 50 for X, 0. 48 for Y and 0. 75 for Z coordinate. So, it can be concluded, the reliability of GPS-coordinates of projection centres in these <b>aerial</b> <b>triangulations</b> was good. For scales 1 : 19 000 and 1 : 26 000, in 9 blocks out of 15 the global redundancy numbers of horizontal GPScoordinates were lower than 0. 25. 1...|$|R

The main focus is on standardized calibration procedures and on photogrammetric workflows. The current prototype consists of an industrial grade frame imaging camera with 12 megapixel resolutions and a compact GNSS/IMU solution which are operated by an embedded computing unit (CPU). The camera was calibrated once pre-flight and several times post-flight {{over a period of}} 5 month using a three dimensional test field. The verification of the radiometric quality of the acquired images has been done under controlled static conditions and kinematic conditions testing different demosaicing methods. The validation of MACS-Micro is done by comparing a traditional photogrammetric evaluation with the workflows of Agisoft Photoscan and Pix 4 D Mapper.

40|$|The UltraCam-project {{created a}} novel Large Format Digital Aerial Camera. It was {{inspired}} by the ISPRS Congress 2000 in Amsterdam. The search for a promising imaging idea succeeded in May 2001, defining a tiling approach with multiple lenses and multiple area CCD arrays to assemble a seamless and geometrically stable monolithic photogrammetric aerial large format image. First resources were spent on the project in September 2011. The initial UltraCam-D was announced and demonstrated in May 2003. By now the imaging principle has resulted in a 4 th generation UltraCam Eagle, increasing the original swath width from 11, 500 pixels to beyond 20, 000. Inspired by the original imaging principle, alternatives have been investigated, and the UltraCam-G carries the swath width even further, namely to a frame image with nearly 30, 000 pixels, however, with a modified tiling concept and optimized for orthophoto production. We explain the advent of digital aerial large format imaging and how it benefits from improvements in computing technology to cope with data flows at a rate of 3 Gigabits per second and a need to deal with Terabytes of imagery within a single aerial sortie.

40|$|The 3 -OC {{is one of}} {{the newest}} digital three line {{scanners}} on the market. Unlike other three line scanners using a single optical system, the 3 -OC uses three different optical systems moving together. Therefore, this thesis aimed to develop a photogrammetric model for the 3 -OC. To precisely relate ground space and the corresponding image space, all the exterior orientation (E. O.) parameters of image lines need to be estimated using a bundle block adjustment. The biggest hurdle in this problem is the large number of exterior orientation parameters because one image strip of the 3 -OC usually contains tens of thousands of lines. To reduce the number of unknown E. O. parameters, the E. O. parameters of all the three cameras at an instant imaging time were represented by transformed parameters with respect to the gimbal rotation center. As a result, the unknown E. O. parameters were reduced to one third of original number of parameters. However, the number of E. O. parameters is still too big and estimating these E. O. parameters requires enough observations which are practically very difficult to obtain. To resolve this problem, there have been two kinds of approaches. One is reducing the number of unknown parameters and the other is providing fictitious observations using a stochastic model. As the title of this thesis implies, a stochastic trajectory model was implemented in this thesis. The stochastic relationships between two adjacent lines, as described in previous work, were expanded to the stochastic relationships between two adjacent image observations, so that the E. O. parameters of the lines between two adjacent observations can be recovered by interpolation. By providing enough pass points, it was possible to recover all the E. O. parameters accurately. In addition, the number of unknown E. O. parameters was drastically reduced as well. In this thesis, <b>aerial</b> <b>triangulations</b> of the suggested photogrammetric model were performed with self-calibrating some of the system parameters. As a result, the exterior orientation parameters were successfully estimated and the system parameters were calibrated as well. The RMSE of image misclosures on check points was less than 1. 2 pixel and the RMSE of ground misclosures at check points was less than 0. 6 ft (nominal GSD is 0. 5 ft). ...|$|R
