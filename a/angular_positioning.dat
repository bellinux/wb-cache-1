50|$|When precise <b>angular</b> <b>positioning</b> over {{only a small}} total {{angle is}} required, a linear {{actuator}} (either manual, or motorized) may be used. Typically, the range of motion possible is only 10° to 20° of rotation. The linear actuator presses against a contact surface fixed to the stage platform such that extension or retraction of the actuator causes the platform to rotate. The stage platform is sprung against the actuator tip so that the contact surface stays {{in contact with the}} actuator tip when the actuator retracts.|$|E
50|$|Servomotors {{are used}} for both {{high-end}} and low-end applications. On the high end are precision industrial components that use a rotary encoder. On the low end are inexpensive radio control servos (RC servos) used in radio-controlled models which use a free-running motor and a simple potentiometer position sensor with an embedded controller. The term servomotor generally refers to a high-end industrial component while the term servo is most often {{used to describe the}} inexpensive devices that employ a potentiometer. Stepper motors are not considered to be servomotors, although they too are used to construct larger servomechanisms. Stepper motors have inherent <b>angular</b> <b>positioning,</b> owing to their construction, and this is generally used in an open-loop manner without feedback. They are generally used for medium-precision applications.|$|E

40|$|A {{low cost}} semicircular type {{capacitive}} <b>angular</b> <b>position</b> sensor has been designed, developed and tested. It {{is made of}} two semicircular parallel plates where one plate is fixed and another plate is connected with the rotor whose <b>angular</b> <b>position</b> is to be measured. When the <b>angular</b> <b>position</b> of the rotor changes {{with respect to the}} fixed plate, the overlapping area between the two plates of the capacitor is varied causing a change in capacitance value. Capacitance variation obtained due to the change in <b>angular</b> <b>position</b> is in the nano farad range. For signal conditioning, series R-L-C resonating circuit instead of conventional bridge circuit has been used to convert the sensor capacitance variation in to voltage. Experimental result shows that the capacitance for change in <b>angular</b> <b>position</b> 0 º- 180 º increases linearly and for 180 º- 360 º it decreases linearly. To get a linearly increasing response of same slope for the full scale of 0 º- 360 º, a suitable linearising circuit has been designed, developed and tested.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedAn experimental investigation {{was conducted to}} develop a method of predicting cylinder indicated torques in a reciprocating engine by measurement of crankshaft angular velocity fluctuations. Cylinder indicated pressures were measured for all three cylinders of a two-stroke Diesel engine with pressure transducers. Time-resolved <b>angular</b> <b>position</b> was measured at the crankshaft front and at the flywheel. A six degree-of-freedom torsional crankshaft model was developed. Two solution methods are described to solve the equations of motion: a time-marching ODE solver, and a Finite Element solution in the time domain. Using these methods with the measured cylinder torques, the <b>angular</b> <b>positions</b> are predicted and compared to measured <b>angular</b> <b>positions</b> for model calibration. An inverse solution method was developed to determine the cylinder indicated torques from the measured <b>angular</b> <b>position</b> at the crankshaft endpoints.
