5|$|Another {{solution}} to the high-speed problem is the delta wing. The delta wing had {{many of the same}} advantages of the swept wing in terms of transonic and supersonic performance, but offered much more internal room and overall surface area. This provided more room for fuel, an important consideration given the inefficient early jet engines of the era, and the large wing area provided ample lift <b>at</b> <b>high</b> altitudes. The delta wing also enabled slower landings than swept wings in certain conditions. The disadvantages of the design were increased drag at lower speeds and altitudes, and especially higher drag while maneuvering. For the interceptor role these were minor concerns, as the aircraft would be spending most of its time flying in straight lines <b>at</b> <b>high</b> altitudes and speeds, mitigating these disadvantages.|$|E

30|$|The {{influence}} {{of time on}} specific surface was minimal at low pressures but increased <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> decomposition pressures. Vibrational energies of Mo-S bonds in FT-IR indicate that MoS 2 catalysts prepared <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> pressures exhibit weaker Mo-S bonds. Analysis of XRD patterns point towards an increase in stacking and crystallite size with increasing pressure; interlayer rotation about both the a- and c-axes of the stacks was also observed. Catalytic testing results show that conversion increases <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> values of decomposition time and pressure. Partially hydrogenated products were also observed <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> pressures, and the ratio of partially to fully hydrogenated DBT was calculated as an additional measure of catalytic efficiency.|$|R

30|$|For {{both the}} systems mentioned, the dynamic IFT {{decreases}} with pressure; however, {{the rate of}} reduction slightly decreases <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> pressure conditions. This {{could be due to}} the fact that the CO 2 solubility at low pressures significantly improves by pressure, whereas <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> pressures CO 2 solubility slightly increases with pressure. Asphaltene accumulation at the interface <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> pressure conditions could be another likely reason during which the interface becomes more rigid.|$|R
