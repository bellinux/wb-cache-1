25|$|Lodge: Well, {{you are a}} {{chief of}} state. I cannot give you advice, but personally, and as a friend, and as {{somebody}} who is concerned about your health, my suggestion would be you think seriously of getting away. Now, if I can be of any help on that, I'm prepared to send my driver with an officer of mine to escort you to safety. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> you on my jet aircraft, and I'm sure I can deliver on that. One of my officers will ride {{in the front seat}} of my limousine with the chauffeur.|$|E
25|$|Fractional Fourier {{transform}} {{can be used}} in {{time frequency}} analysis and DSP. It is useful to filter noise, but with the condition that it does not overlap with the desired signal in the time–frequency domain. Consider the following example. We cannot apply a filter directly to eliminate the noise, but {{with the help of the}} fractional Fourier transform, we can rotate the signal (including the desired signal and noise) first. We then apply a specific filter, which will allow only the desired signal to pass. Thus the noise will be removed completely. Then we use the fractional Fourier transform again to rotate the signal back <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> the desired signal.|$|E

"Devil Pray" [...] brings Madonna [...] "as {{a devoted}} disciple, {{drawn to a}} darker kind of prayer", as noted by The Quietus Amy Pettifer, and its story deals with sin, temptation and deliverance.

2500|$|A {{common thread}} in the {{argument}} against VSU {{is the notion}} of a campus culture, or the university experience. University has traditionally been a time of broadening horizons, socialising, and political activism. Opponents argue that VSU makes it more difficult for students to have high quality sports grounds, lively music and social venues, and the resources necessary to mount protests and political campaigns, leading to moribund campuses. This was a view expressed by Senator Barnaby Joyce who said the original VSU legislation could lead to [...] "unnecessary collateral damage against sporting facilities and other vital parts of university infrastructure, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> rid of compulsory student unionism without affecting you know, the sporting clubs and you know the childcare facilities" [...] Proponents counter that the free-market system rewards venues and establishments which students enjoy and value, and that it lets students choose their own level of contribution to a political cause.|$|E
