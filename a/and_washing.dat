Women engaged in occupations which were an extension of household jobs, such as textile work <b>and</b> <b>washing,</b> and those unrelated to household tasks: cobblers, gilders, net-weavers, potters, and grooms.|$|E
5|$|About 1.2billion {{people in}} {{developing}} nations lack clean, safe water because most household and industrial wastes are dumped directly into rivers and lakes without treatment. This contributes to the rapid increase in waterborne diseases in humans. Out of India's 3119 towns and cities, just 209 have partial treatment facilities, and only 8 have full wastewater treatment facilities (WHO 1992). 114 cities dump untreated sewage and partially cremated bodies directly into the Ganges River. Downstream, the untreated water is used for drinking, bathing, <b>and</b> <b>washing.</b> This situation is typical of many rivers in India {{as well as other}} developing countries.|$|E

5|$|Electricity in {{the island}} is {{supplied}} by a 0.326 MW diesel power plant of the Romblon Electric Cooperative (ROMELCO). However, electricity service is only available in early morning, from 4:00 to 6:00a.m. and at night, from 5:00 to 11:00p.m., due to limited fuel supplies. As for water supply, potable water for drinking <b>and</b> <b>washing</b> comes from water pumps, artesian wells, springs, and rainwater collection tanks in individual homes. The island has access to cellular phone and Internet service through Smart and Globe. Terrestrial and cable television service are also available.|$|E
5|$|The gorge is {{susceptible}} to flooding. In the Chew Stoke flood of 1968 {{the flow of water}} washed large boulders down the gorge, damaging the cafe and entrance to Gough's Cave <b>and</b> <b>washing</b> away cars. In the cave itself the flooding lasted for three days. In 2012 the B3135, the road through the gorge, was closed for several weeks following damage to the road surface during extensive flooding.|$|E
5|$|The mosques at Gedi {{contained}} wells <b>and</b> <b>washing</b> facilities, {{which would}} have been used for cleansing prior to worship. However, they were not constructed with minarets used for the call to prayer, which was more characteristic in other regions. Gedi's mosques were typically laid out with anterooms flanking the central room, which had a roof supported by wood beams resting on square stone pillars. The isles created by the pillars obstructed the view of the mihrab, which were situated on the north walls in the direction of Mecca.|$|E

5|$|A 19th-century ethnographic account {{from eastern}} Herzegovina {{describes}} a way through {{which a man}} who was not born as a zduhać could become one. Forty days after he ceased praying to God <b>and</b> <b>washing</b> his face, the man should go to some level ground, before he drew a circle on the ground and sat in its centre. Soon the Devil would come and ask the man whether he was willing to join his army, and what form he wanted to be transformed into. When the man stated the desired form, the Devil would turn him into that, making him a zduhać. In the region of Semberija, northeast Bosnia, а zduhać could pass his supernatural power on to his son.|$|E

5|$|A {{good match}} between {{generation}} and consumption is key for high self consumption, {{and should be}} considered when deciding where to install solar power and how to dimension the installation. The match can be improved with batteries or controllable electricity consumption. However, batteries are expensive and profitability may require provision of other services from them besides self consumption increase. Hot water storage tanks with electric heating with heat pumps or resistance heaters can provide low-cost storage for self consumption of solar power. Shiftable loads, such as dishwashers, tumble dryers <b>and</b> <b>washing</b> machines, can provide controllable consumption with only a limited effect on the users, but their effect on self consumption of solar power may be limited.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{the above}} sites, several {{domestic}} sites existed within Cheadle Hulme. These provided sleeping, eating <b>and</b> <b>washing</b> facilities for the Airmen and women stationed at RAF Handforth. Grove Lane park {{was the site of}} an Officers' mess, Cinema, NAAFI, Post Office, chapel and bath house among other buildings. The Grove, near the junction of Grove Lane and Pingate Lane, was Nissen hut accommodation, as were the flats on Gillbent Road opposite the shops and the large field at the junction of Longsight Lane and Stanley Road. The remains of the air raid shelters can still be seen at this location to this day. The wooded area to the rear of numbers 48–64 Hall Moss Lane also housed an officers' mess, NAAFI, post office, chapel and bath house.|$|E
5|$|During Last's tenure, Brasenose had a {{very high}} number of undergraduates: a peak of 104 in 1949, second in the University. Results, however, were poor: two firsts in 1950, placing the college 18th. It was only near the end that things picked up, perhaps a result of Last's stern manner; there were 13 firsts in 1955. However, until 1970, they {{remained}} poor, with only a small increase on the pre-War years. Brasenose sat twenty-first in the Norrington Table in 1968, twenty-sixth in 1975, and twenty-seventh in 1980. It was into this that Hart made his reforms, to bring students closer to the governing body and make them responsible for more of their own care– cleaning <b>and</b> <b>washing,</b> for example. By 2001, Brasenose had climbed the tables once again, coming in third place in the Norrington Table with 30 firsts.|$|E

5|$|For centuries, {{the people}} of Iceland have used their hot springs for bathing <b>and</b> <b>washing</b> clothes. The first use of {{geothermal}} energy for heating did not come until 1907 when a farmer ran a concrete pipe from a hot spring that led steam into his house. In 1930, the first pipeline was constructed in Reykjavík, and was used to heat two schools, 60 homes, and the main hospital. It was a 3km pipeline that ran {{from one of the}} hot springs outside the city. In 1943, the first district heating company was started with the use of geothermal power. An 18km pipeline ran through the city of Reykjavík and by 1945 it was connected to over 2,850 homes.|$|E
5|$|Government {{officials}} in Sri Lanka issued a last-minute evacuation order for potentially affected areas, though few received the evacuation order. The cyclone hit {{the eastern and}} western coastlines with powerful waves, wrecking 25fishing boats in eastern coastal towns <b>and</b> <b>washing</b> away 109 boats near Puttalam. Eight people were left missing and feared dead. The cyclone was accompanied with a storm surge as made landfall that flooded areas up to 330feet (100m) inland. While crossing the country, the cyclone dropped between 4 and 8inches (100 to 200mm) of precipitation, compounding the effects of severe monsoonal flooding from the previous month. Wind gusts from the cyclone reached 110mph (175km/h) near where it made landfall.|$|E
5|$|Reformed Christians believe baptism to {{be a sign}} of regeneration, or {{the making}} of one into a new creature, based on the {{connection}} found in the New Testament between regeneration <b>and</b> <b>washing</b> with water. Baptism also represents forgiveness or remission of sin by the sprinkling of the blood of Christ, similarly to the sprinkling of blood of sacrificial animals. Baptism is held by almost the entire Reformed tradition to effect regeneration, even in infants who are incapable of faith, by effecting faith which would come to fruition later. However, Reformed theologians do not teach that baptism is necessarily bound to the forgiveness of sins. Not everyone who participates in the outward rite of baptism can be said to has had their sins forgiven. Rather, it is necessary that the baptized person participate spiritually by faith in order to receive this benefit.|$|E

5|$|Some {{scholars}} have specifically compared baptism with the Isiac initiation described by Apuleius. Before the early fourth century CE, baptism was {{the culmination of}} a long process, in which the convert to Christianity fasted for the forty days of Lent before being immersed at Easter in a cistern or natural body of water. Like the mysteries of Isis, then, early Christian baptism involved a days-long fast and a washing ritual. Both fasting <b>and</b> <b>washing</b> were common types of ritual purification found in the religions of the Mediterranean, and Christian baptism was specifically derived from the baptism of Jesus and Jewish immersion rituals. Therefore, according to Hugh Bowden, these similarities come from the shared religious background of Christianity and the Isis cult, not from the influence of one tradition upon the other.|$|E
5|$|The {{old town}} {{comprises}} {{a large number}} of medieval and Renaissance buildings. The quai des Tanneurs ("tanners' quay") {{is one of the most}} picturesque streets in Alsace. A stream used to flow in the middle of the street until the beginning of the 20th century, the relic of a former noxious-smelling trade, since tanning required large amounts of flowing water for treating <b>and</b> <b>washing</b> animal skins. Most of the old tanner houses date back to the Middle Ages and have a tall attic to provide a ventilated space for drying leather. In the neighbouring streets, rue des Oies ("geese street") and rue des Veaux ("calf street"), many houses were covered with a coat of plaster in the 19th century in order to hide the timbering, which was considered too rustic.|$|E
5|$|As {{most of the}} livable land in West Virginia is in {{the flood}} plain, the high river {{flooding}} caused heavy damage, wrecking many small rural towns <b>and</b> <b>washing</b> out miles of roadways. A total of 43bridges were destroyed and another 80 were damaged. Near Moorefield, the bridge carrying U.S. Route 220 was closed, but was reopened after emergency repairs. In Paw Paw, a flooded river washed a swept up building into a bridge, washing it away. Much of Pendleton County became isolated after 18bridges were washed out and roads were covered by mudslides. The Cheat River destroyed 110 of the 132houses in Albright, and washed away a trailer park in Rowlesburg. The flooding downed thousands of trees, which were carried into houses and recreation areas to cause additional damage. Agriculture losses were heavy after the floods washed away the topsoil and left behind miles of debris. Many farm structures were washed away, {{and hundreds of thousands}} of chicken or turkeys were killed. Statewide, at least 8,968houses were damaged, and another 4,000 were destroyed, which left nearly 2,600people homeless. In addition, the floods damaged or destroyed 711businesses. Agriculture damage was estimated at $97million, and damage to the United States Forest Service in the state was estimated at $3.9million. Statewide damage totaled nearly $700million, and 38people were killed in West Virginia. This made it the most damaging flood in the state's history, according to then-Governor Arch A. Moore, Jr.|$|E
