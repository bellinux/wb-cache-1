40|$|AbstractBased on {{the analogy}} between {{bifurcation}} of equilibrium paths in structures and kinematic bifurcation of mechanisms, this paper proposes an analogous stiffness method to detect the singularity and kinematic bifurcation of mechanisms. The analogous stiffness in mechanisms is first defined as the derivative of the state variable {{with respect to the}} controlling variable. By investigating the value of analogous stiffness, the singularity can be classified into output singularity, input singularity and architectural singularity. And the kinematic characteristics of free joints at corresponding singularity configurations are expounded. The singular and kinematic bifurcation points of mechanisms can then be determined by solving analogous stiffness equations and compatibility equations simultaneously. Following that, the analytical criterion for finite motion of corresponding free joints at singularity configurations is derived from the second-order <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>compatibility</b> equations.

40|$|Being a {{composite}} {{part of a}} larger system, a crucial feature of a component is its interface, as it describes the compo-manner. It is now commonly accepted that simple, func-tional interfaces are not expressive enough for components, and the trend is towards behavioral interfaces. We propose to go a step further and enhance components with contracts, i. e., agreements between two or more com-ponents on what they are obliged, permitted and forbidden when interacting. This way, contracts are modelled after legal contracts from conventional business or judicial are-nas.

This difference is caused by the difference in the mean velocities of in-pipe flows. The authors demonstrate that the coincidence between the equations of hydraulic resistance of in-pipe and wide flows is attainable when the numerical exponent of the velocity profile inside pipes and channels is different. The quantitative correlation between the hydraulic resistance coefficient and the numerical exponent of the velocity profile for channel flows is identified.

40|$|Quantum gravity {{computations}} {{suggest the}} existence of an ultraviolet and an infrared fixed point where quantum scale invariance emerges as an exact symmetry. We discuss a particular variable gravity model for the crossover between these fixed points which can naturally account for inflation and dark energy, using a single scalar field. In the Einstein-frame formulation the potential can be expressed in terms of Lambert functions, interpolating between a power-law inflationary potential and a mixed-quintessence potential. For two natural heating scenarios, the transition between inflation and radiation domination proceeds through a "graceful reheating" stage. The radiation temperature significantly exceeds the temperature of big bang nucleosynthesis. For this type of model, the observable consequences of the heating process can be summarized in a single parameter, the heating efficiency.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that power {{generation}} efficiency improves when materials with appropriate properties are combined either in a cascaded or segmented fashion across a temperature gradient. Past methods for determining materials used in segmentation weremainly concerned with materials that have the highest figure of merit in the temperature range. However, the example of SiGe segmented with Bi 2 Te 3 and/or various skutterudites shows a marked decline in device efficiency even though SiGe has the highest figure of merit in the temperature range. The origin of the incompatibility of SiGe with other thermoelectric materials leads to a general definition of compatibility and intrinsic efficiency. The compatibility factor derived as = (Jl+zr - 1) a~ is a function of only intrinsic material properties and temperature, which is represented by a ratio of current to conduction heat. For maximum efficiency the compatibility factor should not change with temperature both within a single material, and in the segmented leg as a whole. This leads to a measure of compatibility not only between segments, but also within a segment. General temperature trends show that materials are more self compatible at higher temperatures, and segmentation is more difficult across a larger -T. The compatibility factor {{can be used as a}} quantitative guide for deciding whether a material is better suited for segmentation orcascading. <b>Analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>compatibility</b> factors and intrinsic efficiency for optimal segmentation are discussed, with intent to predict optimal material properties, temperature interfaces, and/or currentheat ratios...|$|E

To illustrate these techniques we describe their application to some cellular automata. Much attention is paid to study symmetries of the systems. In the case of deterministic systems, we reveale some important relations between symmetries and dynamics.

We develop algorithms and programs exploiting discrete symmetries to study microcanonical ensembles and search phase transitions in mesoscopic lattice models. We propose an approach to quantization of discrete systems based on introduction of gauge connection with values in unitary representations of finite groups [...] - the elements of the connection are interpreted as amplitudes of quantum transitions.

Heredity, 94 (3), 356 - 363. Sponsorship: BBSRCThe two-locus gametophytic {{incompatibility}} system in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) is not always fully effective: obligate selfing of plants sieves self-compatible pollen mutants, and self-fertility becomes fixed in subsequent generations. Self-compatibility (SC) was investigated in an F 2 family. In vitro self-pollinations were analysed and recorded and plants were classified as being either partially or fully compatible. Distorted segregation ratios of markers on linkage group (LG) 5 were found, which indicate the possible presence of a gametophytic SC locus. Interval linkage analysis of pollen compatibility after selfing confirmed that this distortion was due to a locus (T) analogous to the S 5 locus of rye. However, even though markers in this region were, on average, less than 1 cM apart, the minimum number of plants possessing the unfavoured allele was never less than 6 % for any marker locus. We proved that this {{was because of the}} presence of another SC locus, exhibiting gametophytic selection, segregating in this population and identified by interval mapping <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>compatibility</b> classes of in vitro self-pollinations. This locus was located on LG 1, and probably corresponds to the S locus. We show that the T locus, a relic of a multilocus system, functions through interaction with the S locus: F 2 segregation of incompatibility phenotypes and linked markers demonstrated that the S/t pollen genotype combination, expected to be compatible on selfing, was sometimes incompatible. Further evidence is presented to show that this interaction must be dependent on yet another locus located on LG 2. A prime candidate would be the Z incompatibility locus. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|A {{method of}} calculating (usually {{for the purpose}} of maximizing) the power-conversion {{efficiency}} of a segmented thermoelectric generator is based on equations derived from the fundamental equations of thermoelectricity. Because it is directly traceable to first principles, the method provides physical explanations in addition to predictions of phenomena involved in segmentation. In comparison with the finite-element method used heretofore to predict (without being able to explain) the behavior of a segmented thermoelectric generator, this method is much simpler to implement in practice: in particular, the efficiency of a segmented thermoelectric generator can be estimated by evaluating equations using only hand-held calculator with this method. In addition, the method provides for determination of cascading ratios. The concept of cascading is illustrated in the figure and the definition of the cascading ratio is defined in the figure caption. An important aspect of the method is its approach to the issue of compatibility among segments, in combination with introduction of the concept of compatibility within a segment. Prior approaches involved the use of only averaged material properties. Two materials in direct contact could be examined for compatibility with each other, but there was no general framework for <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>compatibility.</b> The present method establishes such a framework. The mathematical derivation of the method begins with the definition of reduced efficiency of a thermoelectric generator as the ratio between (1) its thermal-to-electric power-conversion efficiency and (2) its Carnot efficiency (the maximum efficiency theoretically attainable, given its hot- and cold-side temperatures). The derivation involves calculation of the reduced efficiency of a model thermoelectric generator for which the hot-side temperature is only infinitesimally greater than the cold-side temperature. The derivation includes consideration of the ratio (u) between the electric current and heat-conduction power and leads to the concept of compatibility factor (s) for a given thermoelectric material, defined as the value of u that maximizes the reduced efficiency of the aforementioned model thermoelectric generator...|$|E

Chapter 1 summarizes the methods and results of previous activities of SafetyNet WP 2 (first classification of the EU Member States with respect to risk exposure data availability and compatibility, based on a state-of-the-art survey) and outlines the further steps required for a full assessment of risk exposure data compatibility towards a common framework for accident risk analysis in Europe. Moreover, it is devoted to {{a description of the}} methodology used for the detailed assessment of risk exposure data (RED) availability and comparability in the EU, in terms of variables and values, collection methodologies and data structure. Chapter 2 concerns an analysis of the Risk Exposure Data (RED) needs in the EU, as stated by National Experts of many Member States. The analysis allows for the identification of the indicators, variables and values that are most important to road safety researchers in the EU. This analysis is used as a reference {{for the development of the}} common framework of Risk Exposure Data. The results of this analysis allow for the identification of comparable variables and values per collection method for each indicator. The synthesis is included in Chapter 3 of this document. More specifically, for each indicator and for each collection method of that indicator, variables, values and definitions are compared among EU countries. Within this framework, summary tables are presented and transformation rules are proposed, where possible, for the improvement of the comparability of Risk Exposure Data. From this process the current common RED framework is identified, for analyses using the CARE data, together with a set of comparable exposure data. These comparable sets of exposure data are summarized in Chapter 4 of this document.
