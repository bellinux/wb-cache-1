5|$|As his muscular frame developed, Henderson {{continued}} to improve as <b>a</b> <b>hitter.</b> His increasing power-hitting ability {{eventually led to}} a record for home runs to lead off a game. During his career, he hit over 20 home runs in four different seasons, with a high of 28 in 1986 and again in 1990.|$|E
5|$|In April 2012, Strasburg {{accumulated}} an NL-best 34 strikeouts and second-best 1.13 ERA. He totaled 6 {{walks and}} did not give up a home run. Consequently, he was named NL Pitcher of the Month. On May 20, Strasburg went 2-for-2 as <b>a</b> <b>hitter</b> {{in a game against}} the Baltimore Orioles and hit his first career home run, a solo shot off of Wei-Yin Chen.|$|E
5|$|The Phillies {{called him}} up to the major leagues and he became the team's {{starting}} third baseman in 2014. Many compare his playing style, particularly his demeanor and work ethic, to that of former Phillies' teammate Chase Utley. As <b>a</b> <b>hitter,</b> he is better as a contact hitter than a power hitter; defensively, he has improved, which has drawn accolades from former Phillies manager Ryne Sandberg.|$|E

5000|$|The second batter {{is usually}} <b>a</b> contact <b>hitter</b> {{with the ability}} to bunt or {{sacrifice}} a baserunner over or get a hit. [...] His main goal is to move the leadoff man into scoring position and to avoid grounding into double plays. Managers often like to have <b>a</b> left-handed <b>hitter</b> bat second because of the potential gap in the infield defense caused by the first baseman holding the leadoff batter. As early as 1892, it was recognized that <b>a</b> left-handed <b>hitter</b> in the second spot {{would make it easier for}} a man on base to steal second. [...] On a very good team this batter can have characteristics of both <b>a</b> leadoff <b>hitter</b> and <b>a</b> power <b>hitter</b> (Curt Flood, Joe Morgan, Robin Yount, Alan Trammell), in some such cases abandoning the advantage of having <b>a</b> left-hand <b>hitter</b> in favor of <b>a</b> good right-handed <b>hitter.</b>|$|R
5|$|During {{his years}} in Boston, Lowe {{developed}} a reputation both as <b>a</b> <b>hitter</b> and a fielder. Listed at 5ft 10 in (1.78 m), 150 pounds (68kg), he hit right-handed and {{was considered one of}} the best second baseman of the 19th century. He was one of only three (along with Kid Nichols and Herman Long) to play on all five of the Beaneaters teams that won pennants in the 1890s.|$|E
5|$|Several {{records were}} tied, extended, or broken during this World Series, {{including}} team championships (Yankees with 27), career postseason wins (Andy Pettitte with 18), career World Series saves (Mariano Rivera with 11), career World Series home runs (Chase Utley with seven), {{home runs in}} a postseason series (Chase Utley with five), strikeouts by <b>a</b> <b>hitter</b> in a World Series (Ryan Howard with 13), and runs batted in in a single World Series game (Hideki Matsui with six).|$|E
5|$|Marte {{recorded}} one out, a strikeout of Howard, {{in the top}} of {{the eighth}} inning. With it Howard set a new World Series record for most strikeouts by <b>a</b> <b>hitter</b> in a single series with a total of 13. After the out, Marte was relieved by the Yankees closer Mariano Rivera in a non-save situation. Rivera allowed a double to Ibáñez, but no runs, in the eighth. After retiring the first two batters in the eighth, Eyre gave way to Ryan Madson, who allowed a single to Jeter before ending the bottom of the eighth inning. Matt Stairs led off the ninth as a pinch hitter, but lined out. Ruiz worked a walk from Rivera, but successive outs by Rollins and Victorino ended the game 7–3 to clinch the World Series for the Yankees. Pettitte added to his own record for most playoff wins, bringing his career total to 18.|$|E

5|$|Richard {{finished}} {{the season with}} a 20–15 record, 14 complete games, threeshutouts, and 214 strikeouts in 291innings of work. At age 26, Richard became only the second pitcher in Astros' history (after Dierker in 1969) to record 20wins in a season, tying him for fourth in the NL that year. Richard also became the ninth member of the Black Aces, an organization founded by Mudcat Grant that consists of all African American pitchers who have won at least 20 major league games in a season. He was named the Most Valuable Player of the Astros by the Houston chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA). Richard finished 17th in MVP Award voting and seventh in the NL's Cy Young Award voting. His 2.75ERA was the seventh-best among the league's starting pitchers, and he held hitters to a 0.212 batting average. He led the league in lowest number of hits allowed per nine innings and in walks allowed; Richard also {{finished the}} season second in batters faced, innings pitched and games started. In addition, he led all NL pitchers with 14 hits, two home runs, and nine runs batted in as <b>a</b> <b>hitter.</b> However, during the year he committed ten errors and finished with an 0.853fielding percentage, nearly 0.100 lower than the league average.|$|E
25|$|Hyman was a {{right-handed}} middle order batsman who was renowned in club cricket as <b>a</b> <b>hitter.</b> He {{played for}} {{the first few years of}} his first-class cricket career as an occasional amateur player, but in the final years, from 1912 to 1914, he turned professional and played for Somerset much more frequently.|$|E
25|$|By then, the {{appearance}} of professional baseball in Venezuela attracted many ball players from the Caribbean and the United States to the country, showing a more integrated sport there {{than it was in}} the United States. This is evidenced in the hiring of stellar pitchers like Ramón Bragaña, Martín Dihigo, Bertrum Hunter, Satchel Paige, Roy Welmaker and the aforementioned Estrada among others, to whom the teenage López had to face more than one once, either as <b>a</b> <b>hitter</b> or pitcher.|$|E
5000|$|Pinch hitters: <b>a</b> {{substitute}} <b>hitter</b> for {{the scheduled}} batter in the lineup. A DH acts as <b>a</b> permanent pinch <b>hitter</b> for the pitcher. Once <b>a</b> pinch <b>hitter</b> bats, he {{will replace the}} previous batter in the lineup unless a substitution is made. The NL occasionally uses pinch hitters in place of pitchers when not playing in an AL ballpark.|$|R
50|$|Donald Hardy Castle is {{a former}} {{professional}} baseball player. He played in four games in Major League Baseball for the Texas Rangers in 1973, three as <b>a</b> designated <b>hitter</b> and one as <b>a</b> pinch <b>hitter.</b>|$|R
5000|$|When the cut fastball {{is working}} correctly, mainly against opposite-handed batters (e.g., a {{right-handed}} pitcher facing <b>a</b> left-handed <b>hitter),</b> the pitch can crack and split <b>a</b> <b>hitter's</b> bat hence the pitch's occasional nickname of [...] "the buzzsaw." [...] Ryan Klesko, {{then of the}} Atlanta Braves, broke three bats in a single plate appearance during the 1999 World Series while facing Mariano Rivera. <b>A</b> few switch <b>hitters</b> have even been known to bat right-handed against the right-handed Rivera (the [...] "wrong" [...] side; switch hitters generally bat {{from the side of}} home plate opposite to the pitcher's throwing hand).|$|R
25|$|Ankiel was {{a pitcher}} with the Cardinals from 1999 until 2001, {{when he lost}} his ability to throw strikes consistently. After trying to regain his {{pitching}} form {{in the minor leagues}} and briefly returning to the majors in 2004, he switched to the outfield in early 2005. For two and a half years, he honed his skills as <b>a</b> <b>hitter</b> and fielder in the Cardinals' minor-league system. He returned to the Cardinals on August 9, 2007. As a Cardinal until 2009, Ankiel hit 47 home runs as an outfielder and two as a pitcher. After the 2009 season, Ankiel became a free agent. Subsequently, he was signed by the Royals and later was traded to the Braves.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the 1949 season, South Bend, now {{managed by}} Dave Bancroft, waged an up-and-down battle with Rockford for first place. The Rockford team, managed by Bill Allington, was a {{perennial}} powerhouse populated with great players and winner of four league championships. First sacker Dorothy Kamenshek was a seven-time All-Star {{and won the}} league batting title twice; three-time All-Star outfielder Rose Gacioch set several season-records as both <b>a</b> <b>hitter</b> and a pitcher; strong-armed Ruth Richard made the All-Star team in six of her eight seasons and responded by gunning down more baserunners than any catcher in the league, while outfielder Eleanor Callow was a three-time All-Star who holds the all-time career record for home runs (55) and triples (60). Undoubtedly, this lineup {{would have been a}} challenge for any pitcher in the league.|$|E
25|$|Don {{signed a}} new {{contract}} with the Dodgers on February 16, 1959 for $8,500. At the Dodgers camp in Vero Beach, Florida, Demeter {{took the time to}} try to reinvent himself as <b>a</b> <b>hitter.</b> He was always going for the home run swing, which resulted in 32 strikeouts in just 106 at bats last season. Manager Walter Alston and new coach Pee Wee Reese would be his teachers. Reese stated that Don was upper-cutting at the ball with each swing, and Pee Wee had him cut down on his swing, which led to immediate results. Alston had Demeter stand outside the batting cage and hit ground balls to the infielders while waiting for his turn in the cage. Don and Alston agreed that the simple exercise helped level off Demeter's swing. While adapting his new batting style, Demeter injured himself on February 27 by pulling a muscle in his right leg. It was not serious, and Demeter returned to spring training play in less than a week. On March 12, he had a game-winning single with the bases loaded against the Cincinnati Reds in the 9th inning to give the Dodgers the 7-6 win.|$|E
50|$|Despite its {{cavernous}} interior, the Kingdome's field dimensions {{were relatively}} small. It {{had a reputation}} as <b>a</b> <b>hitter's</b> park, especially in the 1990s when Ken Griffey, Jr., Edgar Martínez, Jay Buhner, Alex Rodriguez and other sluggers played there.|$|R
5000|$|Benard had above-average {{power for}} <b>a</b> leadoff <b>hitter.</b> <b>A</b> notorious first-pitch <b>hitter</b> prone to {{striking}} out, Benard had good bat speed and could steal bases, {{though he was}} caught stealing 29% of the time {{over the course of}} his career. He played all three outfield positions, mostly as a center fielder. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> pinch <b>hitter,</b> he had <b>a</b> career [...]267 batting average. Benard hit the final Giants home run in the history of Candlestick Park, which came in the first inning of the Giants' eventual 9-4 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers.|$|R

500|$|Rogers Hornsby was so {{respected}} as <b>a</b> <b>hitter</b> that once, when {{a rookie}} pitcher complained to umpire Bill Klem {{that he thought}} he had thrown Rogers a strike, Klem replied, [...] "Son, when you pitch a strike, Mr. Hornsby will let you know." ...|$|E
500|$|By April 1925, he was {{starting}} to show promise as <b>a</b> <b>hitter</b> with the Reading Keystones of the International League.

500|$|Pundits {{and fans}} have {{consistently}} questioned Holliday's durability, and thus his effectiveness as <b>a</b> <b>hitter,</b> {{into the final}} guaranteed year of the contract he signed in 2010.

[...] In {{each of the first}} 11 seasons of his career, including his rookie year, he played at least 121 games.|$|E
5000|$|In an eight-season career, Dallessandro was <b>a</b> [...]267 <b>hitter</b> (520-for-1945) with 22 {{home runs}} and 303 RBI in 746 games, {{including}} 242 runs, 11 doubles, 23 triples, 16 stolen bases, and a [...]369 on-base percentage. <b>A</b> disciplined <b>hitter,</b> he compiled <b>a</b> 2.07 walk-to-strikeout ratio (310-to-150).|$|R
50|$|He {{made his}} major league debut with the Astros on September 25, 2006 {{striking}} out as <b>a</b> pinch <b>hitter</b> against the Philadelphia Phillies.

50|$|Tony Gwynn is {{the leading}} example of <b>a</b> modern contact <b>hitter.</b> Although he had 135 career home runs, Gwynn {{accurately}} described himself as <b>a</b> contact <b>hitter</b> who could hit to all fields. He rarely struck out (just 434 times, once every 21 at-bats) and {{his goal was to}} put the ball in play and move baserunners over. Gwynn's success as <b>a</b> contact <b>hitter</b> landed him in the National Baseball Hall of Fame.|$|R
500|$|The Cardinals drafted Craig as a shortstop in {{the eighth}} round of the 2006 draft (256th overall) and signed him for $15,000. [...] However, he played just three games at shortstop with the State College Spikes in 2006 before {{spending}} the most games playing third base. [...] As <b>a</b> <b>hitter,</b> Craig showed power {{at all levels of}} the Cardinal farm system, hitting 76 home runs in a three and one-half season span between 2006 and 2010 that comprised the bulk of his minor league playing time.|$|E
500|$|The 2012 {{season was}} one of Molina's {{crowning}} achievements as <b>a</b> <b>hitter,</b> especially considering early professional scouting reports did not forecast his bat being much of {{a factor in the}} major leagues.

[...] Lajoie said, [...] "He {{was one of the}} greatest fellows I ever knew, both as a baseball player and as a gentleman." [...] Former Boston teammate Duffy Lewis said, [...] "He was a team player. As great <b>a</b> <b>hitter</b> as he was, he wasn't looking out for his own average ...
