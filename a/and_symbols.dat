For example, the SI unit of force is the newton (N), the SI unit of pressure is the pascal (Pa)—and the pascal can be defined as one newton per square metre (N/m2).|$|E

In heraldry, birds, especially eagles, often appear in coats of arms.|$|E

5|$|Silver treasures, {{common in}} the Scandinavian countries, are found also in Slavic areas {{including}} Poland, especially northern Poland.

The process of hiding or depositing them, besides protecting them from danger, is believed by the researchers to represent a cult ritual.|$|E
5|$|Weather fronts are {{boundaries}} between two masses of air of different densities, or different temperature and moisture properties, which normally are convergence zones {{in the wind}} field and are the principal cause of significant weather.

Wind shear in the horizontal occurs near these boundaries.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{creation}} of the Canadian Heraldic Authority, Canadians wishing to obtain a legally granted coat of arms had to apply to one of the two heraldic offices in the United Kingdom: either the College of Arms in London or, if of Scottish descent, the Court of the Lord Lyon in Edinburgh.

5|$|IUPAC {{is governed}} by several {{committees}} that all have different responsibilities.

Each committee {{is made up of}} members of different National Adhering Organizations from different countries.|$|E
5|$|IUPAC was {{established}} in 1919 as the successor of the International Congress of Applied Chemistry {{for the advancement of}} chemistry. Its members, the National Adhering Organizations, can be national chemistry societies, national academies of sciences, or other bodies representing chemists. There are fifty-four National Adhering Organizations and three Associate National Adhering Organizations. IUPAC's Inter-divisional Committee on Nomenclature <b>and</b> <b>Symbols</b> (IUPAC nomenclature) is the recognized world authority in developing standards for the naming of the chemical elements and compounds. Since its creation, IUPAC has been run by many different committees with different responsibilities. These committees run different projects which include standardizing nomenclature, finding ways to bring chemistry to the world, and publishing works.|$|E

5|$|These Nishidhis {{detail the}} names, dates, the {{duration}} of the vow, and other austerities performed by the person who observed the vow. The earliest Nishidhis (6th to 8th century) mostly have an inscription on the rock without any symbols. This style continued until the 10th century when footprints were added alongside the inscription. After the 11th century, Nishidhis are inscribed on slabs or pillars with panels <b>and</b> <b>symbols.</b> These slabs or pillars were frequently erected in mandapas (pillared pavilions), near basadi (temples), or sometimes as an inscription on the door frame or pillars of the temple.|$|E
5|$|A European innovation, castles {{originated}} in the 9thand 10thcenturies, {{after the fall of}} the Carolingian Empire resulted in its territory being divided among individual lords and princes. These nobles built castles to control the area immediately surrounding them, and the castles were both offensive and defensive structures; they provided a base from which raids could be launched as well as protection from enemies. Although their military origins are often emphasised in castle studies, the structures also served as centres of administration <b>and</b> <b>symbols</b> of power. Urban castles were used to control the local populace and important travel routes, and rural castles were often situated near features that were integral to life in the community, such as mills, fertile land, or a water source.|$|E
