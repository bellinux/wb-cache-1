5|$|A {{year after}} his first novel was {{published}} Maugham began contributing to magazines and periodicals; initially these were short stories, but he also wrote opinion pieces, non-fictional and autobiographical work, and letters. Much of his non-fictional writing was published in book form, and covered a range of topics, including travel, current affairs, autobiography and belles lettres. Maugham was also editor {{on a number of}} works, which often included adding a preface or introductory chapter to the work of other writers. In 1903 his first play was performed, A Man of Honour at the Imperial Theatre, London. It was the first of many of his works that were produced for the stage, and with the later development of cinema, his novels <b>and</b> <b>stories</b> were also adapted for the big screen.|$|E

Her declining health and a falling off in readership among older children have been put forward as the principal reasons for this change in trend. Blyton published her last book in the Noddy series, Noddy and the Aeroplane, in February 1964. In May the following year she published Mixed Bag, a song book with music written by her nephew Carey, and in August she released her last full-length books, The Man Who Stopped to Help and The Boy Who Came Back.|$|E

5|$|Beliefs in {{the divine}} and in the afterlife were {{ingrained}} in ancient Egyptian civilization from its inception; pharaonic rule {{was based on the}} divine right of kings. The Egyptian pantheon was populated by gods who had supernatural powers and were called on for help or protection. However, the gods were not always viewed as benevolent, and Egyptians believed they had to be appeased with offerings and prayers. The structure of this pantheon changed continually as new deities were promoted in the hierarchy, but priests made no effort to organize the diverse and sometimes conflicting myths <b>and</b> <b>stories</b> into a coherent system. These various conceptions of divinity were not considered contradictory but rather layers in the multiple facets of reality.|$|E

Understanding ourselves requires an understanding of how and why we create history, narrative, <b>and</b> <b>story.</b> Two Holocaust narratives of cultural and literary importance are investigated – Primo Levi’s If This Is A Man and Art Spiegelman’s Maus. Two different ways of telling <b>and</b> preserving <b>stories</b> about the Holocaust have had great impact upon Cultural and Holocaust studies, these stories have raised lasting questions on morals and ethics. By framing these works within my own narrative, and narrative theory, I have attempted to personalize and understand the construction of narrative and the relationship between writer/artist, and memory, and the larger relationship to history, narrative, <b>and</b> <b>story...</b>|$|R
