5|$|Both teams {{entered the}} tiebreaker with long {{histories}} of frustration <b>and</b> <b>disappointment.</b> California {{had won the}} AL West division title on 3 occasions (1979, 1982, and 1986), but failed {{to advance to the}} World Series each time. In particular, the Angels blew a 2–0 series lead in the best-of-five 1982 ALCS to the Milwaukee Brewers, and were one strike away from defeating the Boston Red Sox in Game 5 of the 1986 ALCS but ended up losing that game and the next two to lose the best-of-seven series that they had led 3–1. They had not returned to the postseason since the 1986 loss.|$|E
5|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} {{and even as}} late as 1987, Solidarity was seen by many, {{including}} most of its activists, as likely {{a thing of the}} past. It persisted solely as a rather small underground organization, supported by various international institutions, from the Catholic Church to the Central Intelligence Agency. When most senior Solidarity figures were interned or otherwise neutralized by the authorities, Zbigniew Bujak, head of the Union's Warsaw branch, remained in hiding and was the leader of the clandestine organization until his arrest in 1986. But the post-martial law general public showed signs of tiredness <b>and</b> <b>disappointment,</b> as it had become apparent that Solidarity was not a united front.|$|E
5|$|On February 10 Matsui {{received}} a messenger from the Army General Staff who informed him, much to Matsui's chagrin <b>and</b> <b>disappointment,</b> {{that he would}} soon be relieved of command and replaced with Shunroku Hata. Ultimately, the Army General Staff did not punish Matsui but they did shake up the whole field command in China and Matsui {{was just one of}} eighty senior officers, including Asaka and Yanagawa, who were all recalled at the same time.|$|E

5|$|On February 13, it was {{announced}} that the Amaury Sport Organisation would not invite Astana to any of their races that season, which included the Tour de France, Paris–Nice, and numerous one-day races. The decision was made because of the doping perpetrated by Astana in its previous seasons; chief among these scandals was the blood doping perpetrated by Alexander Vinokourov in the 2007 Tour de France. The team reacted with surprise <b>and</b> <b>disappointment,</b> particularly since the ban seemed to punish a team that no longer existed, and as a result Contador {{would not be able to}} defend his Tour de France championship.|$|E
5|$|Although Evans {{had always}} {{suffered}} from bouts of depression, and bitterness towards those he felt did not appreciate his inventions, such sentiments seemed to peak {{in his later}} years. During {{one of his many}} legal battles in 1809, comments from the presiding judge sent Evans into a particular fury in which he dramatically incinerated many schematics and papers regarding his inventions, both prior and future. Evans declared at the time that inventing had led only to heartache, disappointment and under-appreciation; and committed himself to business and material acquisition {{for the sake of his}} family. Ultimately what was burned represents only a small proportion of what survives from Evans, and he did continue his interest in inventing, but the tone of Evans's later life was undoubtedly one of hostility <b>and</b> <b>disappointment.</b>|$|E
5|$|With {{help from}} Pyro, Lehnsherr {{recruits}} Callisto {{and several other}} mutants. They attack the mobile prison holding Mystique to free her, also freeing Juggernaut and Multiple Man. Mystique saves Lehnsherr by taking {{a shot of the}} mutant cure aimed at him, rendering Raven Darkhölme human. Hateful of humans, Lehnsherr abandons Darkhölme, much to her shock <b>and</b> <b>disappointment.</b> Meanwhile, Scott Summers, still distraught over the loss of his fiancée, Jean Grey, drives to her resting location at Alkali Lake. Jean appears to Summers but, as the two kiss, Jean kills him. Sensing trouble, Xavier sends Logan and Storm to investigate. When they arrive, they find only telekinetically floating rocks, Summers' glasses, and an unconscious Jean.|$|E

25|$|Critics of Hasidic Judaism {{expressed}} concern that Hasidism might become a messianic sect as had occurred among the followers of both Sabbatai Zevi and Jacob Frank.

25|$|The 2008 {{season was}} {{a mixture of}} success <b>and</b> <b>disappointment</b> for Williams. While Rosberg managed to obtain 2 podiums in Australia and Singapore, the team {{struggled}} at circuits with high-speed corners. The fact that the team {{was one of the first}} to switch development to their 2009 car (when new regulations came in) also hindered their season, and Williams finished a disappointing 8th in the Constructors' Championship. Rosberg stated that unless the team was more competitive in the near future, he would look to drive elsewhere. Williams retained Rosberg and Nakajima for the 2009 season.|$|E
25|$|Hasidic Judaism {{was founded}} by Israel ben Eliezer (1700–1760), {{also known as the}} Baal Shem Tov. His disciples {{attracted}} many followers among Ashkenazi Jews, and established numerous Hasidic groups across Europe. The Baal Shem Tov came {{at a time when the}} Jewish masses of Eastern Europe were reeling in bewilderment <b>and</b> <b>disappointment</b> engendered by the two notorious Jewish false messiahs, Sabbatai Zevi (1626–1676) and Jacob Frank (1726–1791), and their respective followers. Hasidic Judaism eventually became the way of life for many Jews in Eastern Europe.|$|E
25|$|Sabbatai's {{conversion}} to Islam was extremely disheartening for the world's Jewish communities. Among {{the masses of}} the people the greatest confusion reigned.

In spite of Sabbatai's apostasy, many of his adherents still tenaciously clung to him, claiming that his conversion {{was a part of}} the Messianic scheme. This belief was further upheld and strengthened by the likes of Nathan of Gaza and Samuel Primo, who were interested in maintaining the movement.|$|E
