40|$|Ship {{interaction}} {{in terms of}} anchor hooking on a subsea pipeline has been investigated in this thesis. An attempt {{has been made to}} predict the most probable anchor interaction loads on the Kvitebjørn gas pipeline in the North Sea if anchor hooking were to occur, and evaluate the structural consequences of an anchor hooking incident. By utilization of AIS ship data provided by the Norwegian Coastal Administration it has been found that 7160 cargo, tanker and tug ships passed the Kvitebjørn gas pipeline from March 2010 to March 2011. These ships have been evaluated with respect to <b>anchor</b> <b>equipment,</b> ship mass and velocity by use of a developed computer script in the computer code MATLAB. It has been found from geometrical evaluations of anchor hooking that anchors above 3780 kg will have large enough dimensions to hook pipeline. Anchor tow depth analyses predict that stabilization depth of a towed anchor arrangement is about 1 / 3 of the chain length for velocities around 15 knots. The geometrical evaluations and the tow depth analyses have been included in the computer script, and ships not able to hook pipeline have been separated out. Results predict that 237 of the total 7160 evaluated cargo ships, tankers and tugboats possess the necessary hooking parameters. These ships have large enough anchor for the pipeline to get stuck, and ship velocity low enough that the anchor will touch seabed if dropped. Ship traffic {{has been found to be}} largest over pipeline sections with a water depth of around 300 meters. Due to this large water depth only ships with large anchors sizes around 10 tons and above will be able to touch down on the seabed. The most frequently observed <b>anchor</b> <b>equipment</b> and velocities of the ships found to be able to hook the pipeline have been determined. In order to predict the structural consequences of anchor hooking a model in the computer code SIMLA has been developed. The most frequently observed <b>anchor</b> <b>equipment</b> and ship velocities from the AIS studies performed have been included in the SIMLA analyses. Results from the analysis predict that very large strain levels will be observed as a result of anchor hooking. Strains have been found to exceed design strains for interaction by the most frequently observed anchor systems and the pipeline would need extensive reparations due to utilization of the plastic capacity of the cross section beyond capacity corresponding to Specified Minimum Tensile Strength (SMTS) ...|$|E

40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore technologyThe world’s energy {{resources}} on land are getting depleted, and mush attention {{is given to}} the development of offshore fields. Over the past years, new reserves located offshore have been regularly discovered. Once the hydrocarbons have been extracted, it is necessary then to transport them to the storage places, refineries or gas processing plants, and to deliver to the consumers. There are several ways of hydrocarbon transportation. One of the most cost-effective and popular means of oil and gas transportation is pipelines. Construction and operation of subsea pipelines are known to be very hazardous and risky processes. In order to ensure reliable and safe operation of submarine lines, it is essential to design them according to the international standards and codes. However, observance of rules sometimes does not guarantee safe pipeline operation. Some undesirable events can occur from time to rime. One of such events is dragging anchor incident, which poses great threat to the subsea lines. The consequences of this incident may be huge, involving environmental pollution, asset losses and even fatality. The mitigation of these outcomes becomes problematic, expensive and impossible. That is why it is recommended to carry out relevant investigations before the mitigation measures are planned and implemented. This work is mainly focused on the anchor damage assessment of subsea pipelines. The comprehensive discussion on a PARLOC 2001 database is done in order to determine major pipeline incidents, their causes and consequences. The questions regarding pipe-anchor interaction scenario have been studied a lot. It has been found that the extent of pipeline damage is heavily dependent on its unique properties. In addition, not only the pipeline data, but also a combination of vessel characteristics and <b>anchoring</b> <b>equipment</b> parameters has been very useful for the analyses. Based on the results of AIS ship traffic data processing, main pipe damage criteria checks have been performed. The findings indicate that not all the anchors have potential of hooking and approaching the pipeline resting on the seafloor. Key parameters here are anchor class (size), chain length, ship speed and water depth. Moreover, the geometrical configuration of all the anchors has been taken into account as well. Not only a theoretical approach, but a model scale test has been carried out {{in order to understand the}} variation of anchor towing depth with different ship velocities. The comparison of analytical solution results with the experimental results is also included in this thesis. Anchor pulling consequences are established in accordance with the global scale analyses performed in the FE program SIMLA for a certain number of sensitivity cases for both small (16 -inch) and large (40 -inch) diameter pipelines. The pipelines responses have been determined, and their cross-sectional capacities have been checked. In addition, pipelines failure frequencies have been estimated. This work shows how critical it is to have detailed ship and equipment class data for doing pipeline integrity assessment. In accordance with the results obtained, the dragging anchor interference assessment methodology is developed...|$|R

40|$|Cable yarding {{systems are}} a common method for {{transporting}} materials in mountainous terrain where environmental, safety or economic considerations do not permit ground-based methods such as skidding, forwarding or shovel-logging. Although effective in steep terrain, cable yarding requires anchored support for skyline and operating line operation. Furthermore, mechanized steep slope harvesting, which often uses cable assistance, also necessitates sufficient anchoring for large cable loads. These systems rely on a fixed anchor, or tailhold, to provide adequate line restraint for operation. Anchored guylines and skylines usually depend on available stumps or trees (Peters and Biller 1985). Where these are not available, mobile anchors such as bulldozers or excavators can be used. Mobile <b>equipment</b> <b>anchors</b> have an advantage of predictable resisting capacity, as opposed to trees and stumps, and may present a means of relieving excessive cable tensions in skyline systems without a catastrophic failure. We present a design approach for skyline tension relief with a comparison to actual field data. The analysis demonstrates that exceedance of a mobile anchor sliding resistance results in movement, limiting maximum skyline tensions and subsequently reducing them after the anchor shifts forward. Other anchor types, like stumps, anchored deadmen and engineered anchors, {{do not have the}} tendency for gradual movement to relieve skyline tensions as failure is often catastrophic, resulting in higher and potentially dangerous cable tensions, and complete loss of cable tension at failure. For mobile anchors, a relationship between cable tension and length presents an efficient means of predicting the anchor movement to facilitate design of appropriate equipment setback. A comparison of an analytical approach based on cable tensions, cable lengths, and anchor capacity with instrumented field tests demonstrates that the use of equipment, as a primary or auxiliary anchoring system, can be effective and potentially safer when adhering to design constraints based on equipment, equipment placement and in-situ soil properties...|$|R
40|$|During an earthquake, {{reinforced}} concrete members {{in a building}} will suffer cracking that oscillates as the building dynamically deforms. Equipment that services the building, such as mechanical and electrical items, are anchored to these components, and therefore will be subjected to this dynamic environment. Despite understanding this practical loading situation, as well as recognizing that anchor load capacity is significantly reduced when an anchor is embedded in cracked concrete, there remains a gap in knowledge regarding the effect of anchorage behavior on nonstructural component response. In particular, the effect of dynamic cyclic cracking coupled with inertia-generated tension load cycling on the anchor and component response has not been studied to date. A new methodology involving experimental equipment and simulation tools is developed for investigating the seismic behavior of anchored nonstructural components and systems that accounts {{for the effects of}} simultaneous anchor tension load cycling and crack cycling on anchor behavior and anchored component response. To support the experimental ingredient of this work, a Cyclic Cracked Inertial Loading Rig (CCILR), Weighted <b>Anchor</b> Loading Laboratory <b>Equipment</b> (WALLE) system, and cracked concrete slabs, are designed and fabricated. Mounting the CCILR and WALLE onto a shake table results in a system that is able to simulate a concrete beam or slab from a building supporting an anchored nonstructural component. System-level shake table tests are conducted on floor mounted model nonstructural components anchored in cyclic cracks using epoxy, expansion, drop-in and undercut anchors to study the effect of a range of anchor types. A nonlinear, lumped hysteresis anchor model is implemented and used to simulate anchor load-displacement response for tension load cycling dominant applications. The anchor model is calibrated against single anchor tests and subsequently extended for use in a system model of the anchored nonstructural components for predicting maximum system response. It was determined that the load-displacement behavior of the anchorage, in particular, the ultimate displacement capacity of the anchor, {{plays an important role in}} the seismic response of tension load cycling dominated floor mounted nonstructural components. The experimental results also support the current code design philosophy for anchors, which specifies that either the anchor or the attachment should be ductile, or the anchor should be designed for a multiple of the expected load demand...|$|R
