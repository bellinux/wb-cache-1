5|$|Hancock was {{commissioned}} a brevet second {{lieutenant in the}} 6th U.S. Infantry regiment, and initially was stationed in Indian Territory in the Red River Valley. The region was quiet at the time, and Hancock's time there was uneventful. Upon the outbreak of war with Mexico in 1846, Hancock worked to secure himself <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> front. Initially assigned to recruiting duties in Kentucky, he proved so adept at signing up soldiers that his superiors were reluctant to release him from his post.

He spent the next two years at the Kaleb Ahltins school for painters. During this time he was, like most teenagers, torn between hope and despair, something that is reflected in his artwork.|$|E

5|$|Murray took a {{wildcard}} {{into the}} inaugural Shenzhen Open in China, entering {{as the number}} 2 seed. Victories over Somdev Devvarman, Lukáš Lacko and Juan Mónaco saw Murray reach his first final of the season, breaking a drought of 14 months following his title at Wimbledon. In the final he faced Tommy Robredo of Spain, the second final between the two. After saving five championship {{points in the second}} set tie break, Murray {{went on to win the}} title in three sets, Robredo's drop in fitness ultimately proving decisive. He then took his good form into Beijing, where he reached the semifinals before losing to Djokovic in straight sets, however he lost in the third round at the Shanghai Masters to David Ferrer despite being a set up. Following his early exit in Shanghai, Murray took a wildcard into the Vienna Open in an attempt to claim <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ATP World Tour Finals. He reached the final, where he once again faced Ferrer, and triumphed in three sets for his second title of the season, and the 30th of his career. Murray defeated Ferrer again in the semifinals of the Valencia Open to move into his third final in five weeks, and further strengthen his bid for <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> season finale in London. In a repeat of the Shenzhen Open final, Murray again saved five championship points as he overcame Tommy Robredo in three sets. Murray then went on to reach the quarterfinals of the Paris Masters, where he was eliminated by Djokovic in what was his 23rd match in the space of only 37 days. However, his win over Dimitrov in the third round had already guaranteed him a spot at the ATP World Tour Finals.|$|E

5|$|Returning to the United States in July 1920, Somervell {{was posted}} to the Office of the Chief of Engineers in Washington, D.C.

5|$|The {{award of}} the 2012 Summer Olympics to London {{has brought the}} {{question}} of British participation in the football tournaments to the fore, given that there is traditionally no single British national football team. The British Olympic Association initially refused {{to rule out the}} possibility of entry for 2008, but were unable to come to an agreement with the Scottish Football Association. The 2007 European Under-21 Championship, which served as the European qualifying tournament for the men's competition, saw the England U-21 team reach the semi-finals, which would have meant <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Olympics. Because at the Olympics the team is representative of the entire UK, England were thus prevented from taking this place, with instead a play-off taking place between Portugal and Italy. A similar situation occurred with the England Women's team who, by virtue of being one of the top three European sides at the 2007 World Cup, would have been granted <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Olympics. Instead, there was a play-off between Denmark and Sweden.|$|E
