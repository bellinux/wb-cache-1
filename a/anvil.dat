5|$|When first planned, the {{landings}} were to {{take place}} simultaneouslyOverlord in Normandy and <b>Anvil</b> {{in the south of}} France. It soon became clear that a dual landing was impossible to conduct with the available forces. The expansion of Overlord from a three- to a five-division front required many additional LSTs, which would have been needed for <b>Anvil.</b> At the same time, another Allied amphibious landing in Italy at Anzio had gone badly. All of these resulted in the postponing of <b>Anvil</b> by the Allies.|$|E

40|$|International audienceDeep {{convection}} in the Tropics is {{the source}} of large tropospheric extended clouds usually called <b>anvils.</b> These <b>anvils</b> may produce precipitation (stratiform region of deep convective storms), and also cirrus shields persisting from several hours to several days. <b>Anvils</b> impact the radiation budget, they induce a storage term in the whole water budget which is still relatively poorly quantified, and dynamical feedbacks may be induced in the upper troposphere. The AMMA field campaign which was held over West Africa during the 2006 wet season provided a unique opportunity to document the microphysics of these <b>anvils</b> from unprecedented airborne observations...|$|R
40|$|We have {{fabricated}} diamond <b>anvils</b> {{specially designed}} for use in ultra-high pressure electrical transport experiments. These <b>anvils,</b> which we refer to as ''designer anvils'', feature thin-film metal microprobes which are encased in a layer of high-quality, epitaxial, chemically vapor deposited (CVD) diamond. The synthetic diamond film ensures that the microprobes are survivable to Mbar pressures, and also serves to electrically insulate the microprobes from the high-pressure gasket. High-pressure resistivity experiments were performed on KI and FeO to pressures of approximately 1. 8 and 1. 7 Mbars, respectively. Future possible applications of designer <b>anvils</b> are also discussed. [electrical conductivity, synthetic diamond, band overlap, metallization, designer <b>anvils...</b>|$|R

5|$|PRSA members receive {{access to}} a suite of tools that fosters {{professional}} development and career growth. PRSA hosts an accreditation program called APR (accreditation in public relations) that evaluates a PR professional in four categories: research, planning, implementation and evaluation.

PRSA hosts the <b>Anvil</b> awards, which are issued based on four components: research, planning, execution and evaluation. The Gold <b>Anvil</b> is awarded to individuals. The Silver <b>Anvil</b> is awarded for strategy and the Bronze for tactics. It also issues awards such as Grand Gold Pick, Rookie of the Year, Lifetime Achievement and PR person of the year.|$|E

5|$|The {{second type}} of press design is the cubic press. A cubic press has six <b>anvils</b> which provide {{pressure}} simultaneously onto all faces of a cube-shaped volume. The first multi-anvil press design was a tetrahedral press, using four <b>anvils</b> to converge upon a tetrahedron-shaped volume. The cubic press was created shortly thereafter to increase the volume to which pressure could be applied. A cubic press is typically smaller than a belt press and can more rapidly achieve the pressure and temperature necessary to create synthetic diamond. However, cubic presses cannot be easily scaled up to larger volumes: the pressurized volume can be increased by using larger <b>anvils,</b> but this also increases the amount of force needed on the <b>anvils</b> {{to achieve the same}} pressure. An alternative is to decrease the surface area to volume ratio of the pressurized volume, by using more <b>anvils</b> to converge upon a higher-order platonic solid, such as a dodecahedron. However, such a press would be complex and difficult to manufacture.|$|R
40|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{dimensionless}} analysis there was shown that the squeezing process of different materials, partly, rocks, between flat Bridgman <b>anvils</b> turns out to have physical similarity to the squeezing process of a container in the HPA of the “anvil with recess” type.

5|$|A {{successful}} Allied {{offensive in}} May finally {{broke through the}} Gustav Line, and Rome fell to Clark's army on 4 June. On 13 June, Devers ordered Larkin to shift priority for supplies from Fifth Army in Italy to Seventh Army. Two days later, Wilson ordered VI Corps to be withdrawn from the front line in preparation for <b>Anvil.</b> Virtually all the material needed for the assault was on hand, on the way, or promised, thanks to Devers' efforts to preserve the stockpile of <b>Anvil</b> stores and supplies even when the operation was in doubt. To command the assault, he created a special headquarters on Corsica called Advanced Detachment AFHQ, with Devers in command.|$|E

5|$|Thunderstorms {{can form}} dense cirrus at their tops. As the {{cumulonimbus}} cloud in a thunderstorm grows vertically, the liquid water droplets freeze {{when the air}} temperature reaches the freezing point. The <b>anvil</b> cloud takes its shape because the temperature inversion at the tropopause prevents the warm, moist air forming the thunderstorm from rising any higher, thus creating the flat top. In the tropics, these thunderstorms occasionally produce copious amounts of cirrus from their anvils. High-altitude winds commonly push this dense mat out into an <b>anvil</b> shape that stretches downwind as much as several kilometers.|$|E

40|$|Early multi-anvil {{experiments}} using a tetrahedral configuration {{were carried}} out by Hall, 1958. Deduced from experiments with leakproof sealed split-sphere configurations driven by an oil pressure vessel Kawai, 1966 published the dependence of maximum pressure {{on the number of}} <b>anvils,</b> i. e. the more the sample approaches spherical shape the higher the pressure. Our first approach aimed to check, if this is also valid for single-stage multi-anvil devices. Six TC-anvils of 4 mm truncation got 1. 5 mm deep pyramidal cavities at the front face. The corresponding set-up containing a mixture of NaCl and BN as pressure standard had a tetrakis hexahedral shape, i. e. it was a body having 24 isosceles triangular plane surfaces of the same shape (Figure 1 a, b). The <b>anvils</b> were equipped with prefabricated gaskets (Mueller et al., 2005) for an increased lateral support. The pressure was measured by XRD using the Decker scale (Decker, 1971). However no essential increase of the peak pressure was observed (Figure 2 f). Contrary to the Kawai, 1966 experiment with 20 multi-pistons (<b>anvils)</b> the 24 planes of our experiment were not loaded with <b>anvils</b> acting independently, i. e. moving uniformly to the centre of the set-up.

40|$|Abstract. The design, operation, and {{pressure}} calibration of an opposed-movement multi-anvil device, OMMAD, are described. A finite-element {{analysis of the}} tungsten carbide <b>anvils</b> of this apparatus is made {{with the use of}} a Mohr ^ Coulomb derived criterion. The results are in excellent agreement with the experimental pressure calibration curve. Controlled support stress is applied on the flanks of the <b>anvils</b> to improve their mechanical capabilities, and the stress distributions in the <b>anvils</b> are presented. The OMMAD is able to produce pressures of 20 GPa using tungsten carbide <b>anvils.</b> It does not exhibit design-related limitations on the cell volume as a function of maximum pressure, in contrast to current high-pressure devices. Large-volume devices for pressures of 20 GPa can now be developed for high-temperature, high-pressure experiments. The pressure range for industrial production is therefore extended from 5 ^ 6 GPa to 20 GPa. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{continuing}} {{failure to}} advance in Italy prompted the Combined Chiefs of Staff to postpone Operation <b>Anvil,</b> the on-again-off-again proposal for Allied landings {{along the coast}} of southern France coinciding with Overlord. Clark told Devers that another attack on the Gustav Line could not be mounted until May, and VI Corps could not be withdrawn from Anzio until it succeeded. But planning for <b>Anvil,</b> begun in mid-January by AFHQ's Force 163 in Algiers continued. Initially Clark was to lead the assault, with Lucas taking over Fifth Army. Devers did not have much faith in either of them, even before Lucas' relief. Lyman Lemnitzer later recalled that Fifth Army staff feared that Devers would relieve Clark every time the two met.|$|E
