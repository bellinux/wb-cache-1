5|$|The {{best thing}} of all is that the Greeks should not {{go to war with}} each other at all, but give the gods hearty thanks if by all {{speaking}} with one voice, and joining hands like people crossing a stream, {{they may be able to}} repel the attacks of barbarians and save themselves and their cities. But if this is altogether impossible, in the present juncture at least we ought to be unanimous and on our guard, when we see the bloated armaments and the vast proportions assumed by the war in the west. For even now it is evident to any one who pays even a moderate attention to public affairs, that whether the Carthaginians conquer the Romans, or the Romans the Carthaginians, it is in every way improbable that the victors will remain contented with the empire of Sicily and Italy. They will move forward: and will extend their forces and their designs farther than we could wish. Wherefore, I beseech you all to be on your guard against the danger of the crisis, and above all you, O King. You will do this, if you abandon the policy of weakening the Greeks, and thus rendering them an easy prey to the invader; and consult on the contrary for their good as you would for your own person, and have a care for all parts of Greece alike, as part and parcel of your own domains. If you act in this spirit, the Greeks will be your warm friends and faithful coadjutors in all your undertakings; while foreigners will be less ready to form designs against you, seeing with dismay the firm loyalty of the Greeks. If you are eager for action, turn your eyes to the west, <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>your</b> thoughts dwell upon the wars in Italy. Wait with coolness the turn of events there, and seize the opportunity to strike for universal dominion. Nor is the present crisis unfavourable for such a hope. But I intreat of you to postpone your controversies and wars with the Greeks to a time of greater tranquillity; and make it your supreme aim to retain the power of making peace or war with them at your own will. For if once you allow the clouds now gathering in the west to settle upon Greece, I fear exceedingly that the power of making peace or war, and in a word all these games which we are now playing against each other, will be so completely knocked out of the hands of us all, that we shall be praying heaven to grant us only this power of making war or peace with each other at our own will and pleasure, and of settling our own disputes.|$|E

2500|$|In this work, one of {{his most}} {{emphatic}} statements on faith, he argued that every good work designed to attract God's favor is a sin. All humans are sinners by nature, he explained, and God's grace (which cannot be earned) alone can make them just. On 1 August 1521, Luther wrote to Melanchthon on the same theme: [...] "Be a sinner, <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>your</b> sins be strong, but let your trust in Christ be stronger, and rejoice in Christ who is the victor over sin, death, and the world. We will commit sins while we are here, for this life is not a place where justice resides." ...|$|E

In support of the first two, the Baraita cited God's injunction in [...] "Only be strong and very courageous to observe to do according to all the law that My servant Moses enjoined upon you." [...] The Rabbis deduced that one must [...] "be strong" [...] in Torah and [...] "be courageous" [...] in good deeds.

2500|$|Xinjiang {{has been}} {{experiencing}} an Islamic revival, manifest in decreased alcohol consumption and increased beard length in Hotan. Most visibly, since the July 2009 Ürümqi riots, many religious Hotan women {{of an older}} age began to wear a long face-concealing Islamic garment, which is more similar to the uniform of the female Chechen suicide bomber than to traditional Uyghur attire. Authorities became concerned with the fashion trend after a spate of murders and robberies outside Hotan where the perpetrators wore face-concealing veils, so they ineffectively campaigned to discourage women from wearing the veils, using slogans such as [...] "show off your pretty looks <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>your</b> beautiful long hair fly". Uyghur separatist attacks usually {{take the form of}} IEDs and vehicle-borne bombs in heavily-policed areas. Compared to the 1990s, such bombings from 2000 onward have tended to claim civilian as well as traditional police and bureaucrat targets.|$|E
2500|$|Arkansas seceded {{the next}} month and joined the Confederacy.

Woodruff's battery was first ordered back to Fort Smith, leaving Little Rock on May 23, 1861, on the steamer “Tahlequah.” [...] The men were presented with a flag from the young ladies of Little Rock before their departure, with Miss Juliet Langtree making the presentation, and Lieutenant James W. Finley accepting on behalf of the battery. Miss Langtree closed her presentation speech with these stirring words: [...] Take then this flag <b>and</b> <b>let</b> <b>your</b> determination be like that of the Spartan mother’s advice when she presented her son with his shield: ‘Come home with it or come home on it’. [...] Prophetic words indeed for Lieutenant Finley, who would be dead a month later.|$|E
