25|$|A 2008 {{article in}} the American Journal of Hospice and Palliative Care criticised the Liverpool Pathway for its {{traditional}} approach and not taking an explicit position on the artificial hydration for critically ill patients. A 2009 editorial in the Journal of Clinical Nursing welcomed the impetus towards providing improved care <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> and the more widespread use of integrated care pathways, but warned that much {{more research is needed}} to assess which of the several approaches that are in use is most effective.|$|E

25|$|Psychiatrists and {{clinical}} psychologists are often asked {{to evaluate a}} patient's capacity for making life-and-death decisions <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> Persons with a psychiatric condition such as delirium or clinical depression may lack capacity to make end-of-life decisions. For these persons, a request to refuse treatment may be taken {{in the context of}} their condition. Unless there is a clear advance directive to the contrary, persons lacking mental capacity are treated according to their best interests. This will involve an assessment involving people who know the person best to what decisions the person would have made had they not lost capacity. Persons with the mental capacity to make end-of-life decisions may refuse treatment with the understanding that it may shorten their life. Psychiatrists and psychologists may be involved to support decision making.|$|E

For individuals who have more advanced disease, hospice care may also be appropriate.|$|E
500|$|Advocate Suhrith Parthasarathy criticised the {{judgement}} of the High Court and wrote, [...] "Sallekhana is not {{an exercise}} in trying to achieve an unnatural death, but is rather a practice intrinsic to a person's ethical choice to live with dignity until death." [...] He {{also pointed out that}} the Supreme Court in the Gian Kaur case explicitly recognises the right to live with human dignity within the ambit of right to life. He further cited that the Supreme Court wrote in the said case, [...] " [...] may include the right of a dying man to also die with dignity when his life is ebbing out. But the right to die with dignity <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> is not to be confused or equated with the right to die an unnatural death curtailing the natural span of life." ...|$|E

He also had metastases in his peritoneal and retroperitoneal cavities. On June 26, 2008, Pausch indicated that he was considering stopping further chemotherapy because of the potential adverse side effects. He was, however, considering some immuno-therapy-based approaches. On July 24, on behalf of Pausch, a friend anonymously posted a message on Pausch's webpage stating that a biopsy had indicated that the cancer had progressed farther than had been indicated by recent PET scans and that Pausch had [...] "taken a step down" [...] and was [...] "much sicker than he had been".

2500|$|The page 425 {{legislation}} {{began as}} a separate bill that was co-sponsored by Republicans Charles Boustany, Patrick Tiberi and Geoff Davis. Boustany, a heart surgeon, said the end-of-life legislation was a [...] "good medical practice". 204 GOP House members and 42 GOP Senators voted for a 2003 Medicare prescription drug bill that included end-of-life counseling. The 2003 legislation only covered end-of-life counseling for terminally ill patients, which the Republican Charles Grassley supported. Grassley said that the 2009 end-of-life counseling would [...] "pull the plug on grandma" [...] and that [...] "You shouldn't have counseling <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> you should have done that 20 years before," [...] {{which is what the}} 2009 legislation would allow. Republican Newt Gingrich defended the death panel claim, but previously praised the Gundersen Lutheran Health System for encouraging the widespread use of Advance Directives.|$|E

2500|$|The {{rectal route}} is an {{effective}} route of administration for many medications, especially those used <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> The walls of the rectum absorb many medications quickly and effectively. Medications delivered to the distal one-third of the rectum at least partially avoid the [...] "first pass effect" [...] through the liver, which allows for greater bio-availability of many medications {{than that of the}} oral route. Rectal mucosa is highly vascularized tissue that allows for rapid and effective absorption of medications. A suppository is a solid dosage form that fits for rectal administration. In hospice care, a specialized rectal catheter, designed to provide comfortable and discreet administration of ongoing medications provides a practical way to deliver and retain liquid formulations in the distal rectum, giving health practitioners a way to leverage the established benefits of rectal administration.|$|E
