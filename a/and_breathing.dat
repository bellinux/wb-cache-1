5|$|Dive tables or {{decompression}} {{tables are}} tabulated data, {{often in the}} form of printed cards or booklets, that allow divers to determine a decompression schedule for a given dive profile <b>and</b> <b>breathing</b> gas.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of cervical injuries include low heart rate, low blood pressure, problems regulating body temperature, <b>and</b> <b>breathing</b> dysfunction. If the injury is high enough in the neck to impair the muscles involved in breathing, the person {{may not be able to}} breathe without the help of an endotracheal tube and mechanical ventilator.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle's {{account of}} {{temperature}} regulation sought {{to explain how}} an animal maintained a steady temperature and the continued oscillation of the thorax needed for breathing. The system of regulation of temperature <b>and</b> <b>breathing</b> described in Youth and Old Age, Life and Death 26 is sufficiently detailed to permit modelling as a negative feedback control system (one that maintains a desired property by opposing disturbances to it), with a few assumptions such as a desired temperature to compare the actual temperature against.|$|E

5|$|Decompression {{software}} {{can be used}} to generate tables or schedules matched to a diver's planned dive profile <b>and</b> <b>breathing</b> gas mixtures. The usual procedure is to generate schedules for the intended profile and for the most likely contingency profiles, such as slightly greater depth, delayed ascent and early ascent. Sometimes an emergency minimum decompression schedule and a more conservative schedule will be generated to allow the diver further options.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{software}} {{is available for}} personal computers to model the decompression requirements of user specified dive profiles with different gas mixtures using a choice of decompression algorithms. Schedules generated by decompression software represent a diver's specific dive plan <b>and</b> <b>breathing</b> gas mixtures. It is usual to generate a schedule for the planned profile {{and for the most}} likely contingency profiles.|$|E
5|$|Great mullein {{has been}} used since ancient times as a remedy for skin, throat <b>and</b> <b>breathing</b> ailments. It has long had a {{medicinal}} reputation, especially as an astringent and emollient, as it contains mucilage, several saponins, coumarin and glycosides. Dioscorides recommended it for diseases of the lung {{and it is now}} widely available in health and herbal stores. Non-medical uses have included dyeing and making torches.|$|E

5|$|Howe's health {{declined}} in 1934, {{and he was}} hospitalized for heart problems <b>and</b> <b>breathing</b> difficulties. He {{spent the last two}} years of his life in and out of Bethesda Naval Hospital. Though he experienced increasing periods of confusion, he continued to give orders to his staff by telephone; Roosevelt had instructed them to treat Howe's calls with courtesy, but to double-check his instructions with himself and other staff. Howe died on April 18, 1936. Roosevelt gave him a state funeral three days later in the White House East Room.|$|E
5|$|Immersion {{in water}} and {{exposure}} to cold water and high pressure have physiological effects on the diver which limit the depths and duration possible in ambient pressure diving. Breath-hold endurance is a severe limitation, <b>and</b> <b>breathing</b> at high ambient pressure adds further complications, both directly and indirectly. Technological solutions have been developed which can greatly extend depth and duration of human ambient pressure dives, and allow useful {{work to be done}} underwater.|$|E
5|$|Immersion of {{the human}} body in water affects the circulation, renal system, fluid balance, <b>and</b> <b>breathing,</b> because the {{external}} hydrostatic pressure of the water provides support against the internal hydrostatic pressure of the blood. This causes a blood shift from the extravascular tissues of the limbs into the chest cavity, and fluid losses known as immersion diuresis compensate for the blood shift in hydrated subjects soon after immersion. Hydrostatic pressure on the body from head-out immersion causes negative pressure breathing which contributes to the blood shift.|$|E

5|$|Mark Mangini {{served as}} The Final Frontiers sound designer; he had {{previously}} worked on The Voyage Home. Because Mangini was concerned about creating continuity within Star Treks sounds, he decided to reuse some effects rather than create new and different-sounding ones— as such, the Bird of Prey's cloak effect, beaming sounds, and the Enterprise engines sound similar to past movies. Mangini collaborated with Shatner to work out how the completely new effects would sound. For Sybok's mind melds, Shatner wanted the sounds of beating hearts <b>and</b> <b>breathing.</b>|$|E
5|$|One catechesis of Symeon's, On Faith, {{along with}} a {{composite}} work titled One Hundred and Fifty-Three Practical and Theological Texts, {{are included in the}} Philokalia, a collection of texts by early Christian mystics. Another text in the Philokalia, titled The Three Methods of Prayer is also attributed to Symeon—it describes a method of practicing the Jesus Prayer that includes direction on correct posture <b>and</b> <b>breathing</b> while reciting the prayer. It is extremely unlikely that he wrote that text—some scholars attribute it to Nikiphoros the Monk, while others believe it was written by disciples of Symeon.|$|E
5|$|Respiratory failure {{may require}} {{intubation}} of the trachea <b>and</b> <b>breathing</b> support through mechanical ventilation, generally on an intensive care unit. The need for ventilatory support can be anticipated by measurement of two spirometry-based breathing tests: the {{forced vital capacity}} (FVC) and the negative inspiratory force (NIF). An FVC of less than 15ml per kilogram body weight or an NIF of less than 60cmH2O are considered markers of severe respiratory failure.|$|E

5|$|When {{brain death}} is suspected, {{reversible}} differential diagnoses such as hypothermia-induced coma, electrolyte, neurological and drug-related cognitive suppression {{need to be}} excluded. Testing for reflexes can be of help in the decision, as can the absence of response <b>and</b> <b>breathing.</b> Clinical observations, including a total lack of responsiveness, a known diagnosis, and neural imaging evidence, may all {{play a role in}} the decision to pronounce brain death.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} to self-contained breathing systems is to supply breathing gases {{from the surface}} through a hose. When combined with a communication cable, a pneumofathometer hose and a safety line {{it is called the}} diver's umbilical, which may include a hot water hose for heating, video cable <b>and</b> <b>breathing</b> gas reclaim line. More basic equipment that uses only an air hose is called an airline or hookah system. This allows the diver to breathe using an air supply hose from a cylinder or compressor at the surface. Breathing gas is supplied through a mouth-held demand valve or light full-face mask. It is used for work such as hull cleaning and archaeological surveys, for shellfish harvesting, and as snuba, a shallow water activity typically practised by tourists and those who are not scuba-certified.|$|E
5|$|An attack often {{begins with}} muscle pain, cramping, and stiffness. This is {{followed}} by weakness or paralysis that tends to develop rapidly, usually in late evening or {{the early hours of}} the morning. The weakness is usually symmetrical; the limb muscles closer to the trunk (proximal) are predominantly affected, and weakness tends to start in the legs and spread to the arms. Muscles of the mouth and throat, eyes, <b>and</b> <b>breathing</b> are usually not affected, but occasionally weakness of the respiratory muscles can cause life-threatening respiratory failure. Attacks typically resolve within several hours to several days, even in the absence of treatment. On neurological examination during an attack, flaccid weakness of the limbs is noted; reflexes are usually diminished, but the sensory system is unaffected. Mental status is not affected.|$|E

5|$|Dive tables or {{decompression}} {{tables are}} tabulated data, {{often in the}} form of printed cards or booklets, that allow divers to determine a decompression schedule for a given dive profile <b>and</b> <b>breathing</b> gas. In some cases they may also specify an altitude range. The choice of tables for professional diving use is generally made by the organization employing the divers, and for recreational training it is usually prescribed by the certifying agency, but for recreational purposes the diver is generally free to make use of any of the range of published tables, and for that matter, to modify them to suit himself or herself.|$|E
5|$|He made {{a painful}} single in 25 minutes of batting {{before it became}} too much. The {{bruising}} severely restricted his mobility <b>and</b> <b>breathing,</b> and he turned down a single after being called through by Loxton, who had come in at the fall of Morris. Soon after, the pair took a single, and Barnes collapsed after completing the run. Barnes {{was taken from the}} ground with the assistance of Bradman among others, and sent back to hospital to recuperate for several days. He took no further part in the match, which ended in a rain-affected draw; Johnson again fell for single figures in the second innings. After the Test, Barnesstill injuredmissed the ten-wicket victory over Middlesex at Lord's. The match was Australia's only fixture between Tests.|$|E
5|$|OTU squadrons, {{according}} to GOC Bowhill, {{should have been}} prepared to deliver an output of three crews per month for torpedo and fighter squadrons and two for General Reconnaissance units. Only at this point did the Air Ministry revise its policy. They did so, however, in a manner which indicated it still did not appreciate {{the problems of the}} Command. Bomber Command had received several months of 'working up' <b>and</b> <b>breathing</b> space from the declaration of war to the German invasion of Western Europe, but Coastal Command had not. Furthermore, Bomber Command was given permission to merge several new squadrons into OTUs. It seemed as if Bomber Command was still receiving better treatment.|$|E

For example, a red dragon is evil <b>and</b> <b>breathes</b> fire while a silver dragon is good <b>and</b> <b>breathes</b> cold.|$|R
