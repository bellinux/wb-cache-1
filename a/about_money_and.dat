And I've spent the last 10 years with {{everyone}} expecting to hear how I spend the money, which I will not do.|$|E
25|$|Peggy Bundy (Katey Sagal)—Al's {{wife who}} is always on his case <b>about</b> <b>money</b> <b>and</b> refuses to clean or cook. She is a lazy, big-haired redhead who spends {{most of her time}} {{parked in front of the}} TV {{watching}} talk shows such as Oprah or robbing Al blind to go shopping; a famously inattentive mother and nagging wife who uses every opportunity to humiliate Al about his job, his meager earnings, and even sexual abilities. Her big taste for things like clothes and male strippers have run Al into debt on numerous occasions. A recurring joke in the series is Al's regret of having married Peggy in the first place; the union was forced on him at shotgun-point. Peggy's best friend is Marcy, with whom she occasionally conspires against Al. Her family is a stereotypical backwoods clan of degenerates whom she often forces the other Bundys to endure, especially her morbidly obese mother whom Al finds intolerable.|$|E

500|$|By 1762, Johnson {{had gained}} a {{reputation}} for being a slow worker. Contemporary poet Charles Churchill teased Johnson for the delay in producing his long-promised edition of Shakespeare: [...] "He for subscribers baits his hook / and takes your cash, but where's the book?" [...] The comments soon stung Johnson into renewed work. It was only in 20 July 1762, when he received the first payment on a government pension of 300 pounds a year, that he no longer had to worry <b>about</b> <b>money</b> <b>and</b> was finally able to dedicate most of his time to finishing the work.|$|E
500|$|During {{the period}} in which he wrote Cryptonomicon, Stephenson read George Dyson's Darwin Amongst the Machines, which led him to Gottfried Leibniz's {{interest}} in a computing machine, the Leibniz–Newton feud, and Newton's work at the Royal Treasury. He considered this [...] "striking when [...] was already working on a book <b>about</b> <b>money</b> <b>and</b> a book about computers," [...] and became inspired to write about the period. Originally intended to be included in Cryptonomicon, Stephenson instead used the material as the foundation for Quicksilver, the first volume of the Baroque Cycle. The research for the sprawling historical novel created what Stephenson called [...] "data management problems", and he resorted to a system of notebooks to record research, track characters, and find material during the writing process.|$|E
500|$|Jonathan Keefe from Slant Magazine was {{somewhat}} less impressed, deeming Kala less successful than Arular, {{which he said}} had more immediate hooks and clever pop sensibility. Pitchfork critic Mark Pytlik said because most of M.I.A.'s lyrics gave the impression they were written [...] "in {{the service of the}} rhythms", her allusions sounded more [...] "rewarding" [...] than what she literally had written. Andy Gill of The Independent found her lyrics unclear in their message <b>about</b> <b>money</b> <b>and</b> social concerns, while remarking that the gun references on [...] "World Town" [...] and [...] "Paper Planes" [...] blemished [...] "an otherwise fine album". In The Guardian, Alexis Petridis wrote that Kala was still a [...] "unique" [...] listen in spite of occasionally tuneless songs. Writing for NME, Alex Miller acknowledged that the record's music polarised opinion, claiming that some members of the magazine's staff had [...] "fed several copies [...] into the shredder claiming aural abuse", although others went on to praise the album for its innovation and referred to it as M.I.A.'s masterpiece.|$|E

500|$|At this time, Hemingway was {{constantly}} worried <b>about</b> <b>money</b> <b>and</b> his safety. He {{worried about his}} taxes {{and that he would}} never return to Cuba to retrieve the manuscripts he had left there in a bank vault. He became paranoid, thinking the FBI was actively monitoring his movements in Ketchum. The FBI had, in fact, opened a file on him during World War II, when he used the Pilar to patrol the waters off Cuba, and J. Edgar Hoover had an agent in Havana watch Hemingway during the 1950s. By the end of November, Mary was at her wits' end, and Saviers suggested Hemingway go to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, and Hemingway may have believed he was to be treated there for hypertension. [...] The FBI knew Hemingway was at the Mayo Clinic, as an agent later documented in a letter written in January 1961. In an attempt to maintain anonymity, Hemingway was checked in at the Mayo Clinic under Saviers's name. Meyers writes that [...] "an aura of secrecy surrounds Hemingway's treatment at the Mayo" [...] but confirms he was treated with electroconvulsive therapy as many as 15 times in December 1960 and was [...] "released in ruins" [...] in January 1961. Reynolds was able to access Hemingway's records at the Mayo, which indicated that the combination of medications given to Hemingway may have created the depressive state for which he was treated.|$|E
500|$|Although officially retired, Grimaldi still {{received}} half of {{his former}} small salary from Drury Lane until 1824. [...] Soon after the fee stopped, Grimaldi fell into poverty {{after a number of}} ill-conceived business ventures and because he had entrusted management of his provincial earnings to people who cheated him. Despite his disabilities, he offered his services as a cameo performer in Christmas pantomimes. [...] Along with Bologna, he re-appeared briefly at Sadler's Wells where he gave some acting instruction to the mime artist William Payne, the future father of the Payne Brothers. [...] He also started working for Richard Brinsley Peake, namesake of Richard Brinsley Sheridan, who was the dramaturge at the English Opera House. Peake hired Grimaldi to star in Monkey Island alongside his son JS. However, Grimaldi's health deteriorated further and he was forced to quit before the show opened; his scene was cut. [...] The early end to his career, worries <b>about</b> <b>money,</b> <b>and</b> the uncertainty over his son's future made him increasingly depressed. To make light of it, he would often joke about his condition: [...] "I make you laugh at night but am Grim-all-day". In 1828, two [...] "farewell" [...] benefit performances were held for him. [...] In the first, he appeared as Hock the German soldier and a drunken sailor in Thomas Dibdin's melodrama The Sixes; or, The Fiends at Sadler's Wells to an audience of 2,000 people. Unable to stand for long periods of time, he sang a duet with JS and finished the evening with a scene from Mother Goose. His last farewell benefit performance on 27 June 1828 was at Drury Lane. Between 1828 and 1836, Grimaldi relied on charity benefits to replace his lost income.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his book}} Three Nights in August, Buzz Bissinger {{compared}} the Cardinals–Cubs rivalry to another famous rivalry in American baseball: [...] "The Red Sox and Yankees is a tabloid-filled soap opera <b>about</b> <b>money</b> <b>and</b> ego and sound bites. But the Cubs and Cardinals are about... geography and territorial rights." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{completing}} his apprenticeship, {{he started a}} one-man business of his own, Third Man Upholstery. The slogan of his business was [...] "Your Furniture's Not Dead" [...] and the color scheme was yellow and black—including a yellow van, a yellow-and-black uniform, and a yellow clipboard. Although Third Man Upholstery never lacked business, he claims it was unprofitable due to his complacency <b>about</b> <b>money</b> <b>and</b> his business practices that were perceived as unprofessional, including making bills out in crayon and writing poetry inside the furniture.|$|E

They want the medals not to be tainted in their value of accomplishment by winning them, and it's all about ratings and commercial selling of time and <b>about</b> <b>money.</b> <b>And</b> an International Olympic Committee has got their hand in the pockets of the network television people, so there's a tremendous conflict of interest in what they should do and what they're doing." ...|$|E
