25|$|In 1981 Ebonite began {{manufacturing}} {{the very}} first urethane cover stock bowling balls and sold the rights to AMF. Ebonite produced AMF balls at that time. Ebonite {{did not believe that}} bowlers would pay the $80.00 price this new technology would demand. That ball became the AMF Angle <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> coverstock change allowed the ball to get a better grip on the urethane finishes used on natural wood lane surfaces, which changed the nature of the bowling game significantly. Then in 1991, Nu-Line Industries produced the X-Calibur, a reactive resin cover. Part-time professional Steve Cooper was the owner and president of the corporation. But production lagged in the early days, allowing firms like Storm, Brunswick and Columbia to enter the reactive market by the following summer. The race to create more and more dynamic balls was on.|$|E
25|$|Excavations at the Anglo-Saxon monastery of Repton in {{the heart}} of Mercia between 1974–1988 found a D-shaped {{earthwork}} on the river bank, incorporated into the stone church. Burials of Viking type were made at the east end of the church, and an existing building was cut down and converted into the chamber of a burial mound that revealed the disarticulated remains of at least 249 people, with their long bones pointing towards the centre of the burial. A large stone coffin was found {{in the middle of the}} mass grave; however, the remains of this individual did not survive. A study of the skeletal remains revealed that at least 80% of the individuals were male, and were between the ages of 15 and 45. Further investigation of the male skeletal remains revealed that they were dissimilar to the local population of Repton, and most likely of Scandinavian descent. In contrast, analysis of the female remains revealed that they were similar to the local population, suggesting an Anglo-Saxon lineage. It is possible that the people in the grave may have suffered some sort of epidemic when the army overwintered in Repton during 873–74, leading to the mass burial. The nearby cemetery at Heath Wood barrow cemetery contains about sixty cremations (rather than burials). Finds of cremation sites in the British Isles are very rare, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> probably was the war cemetery of the Great Heathen Army.|$|E
25|$|Intensive {{exploitation}} of lake resources and habitat destruction resulted in marked decrease in fish production so that commercial operations were halted and recreational fishing is presently limited {{to catch and}} release. Years of construction activity on the lake's limited watershed resulted in lowered water levels. Heavy metals (aluminium, chromium, arsenic, and copper) dissolved in the water {{as a result of}} coal burning were deemed to be at acceptable levels, but metals in sediment and mercury in larger pike were found to be excessive. TransAlta responded with measures to reduce metal and thermal pollution, and the Wabamun power plant was decommissioned and torn down. As a result of the Canadian National Railway oil spill, fish from the lake are not recommended for consumption. Walleye have not been seen in the lake since the early 1900s when they were fished out. Several attempts to restock walleye in the lake failed because the Wabamun power plant (built in the 1950s) discharged its heated cooling water into the lake, keeping that portion of the lake clear of ice. Walleye would spawn in the warm water weeks prior to their normal spawning time and the hatchlings did not survive when they could not find enough food in the still-cold portions of the lake. After closure of the Wabamun power plant in 2010, Alberta Fish and Wildlife attempted another stocking of walleye, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> appears to have been successful. Walleye are reproducing and so are their young. TransAlta no longer uses the lake for any of its operations.|$|E

He claimed that the episode has the puzzling and high points {{that are similar to}} [...] "That's Not My Penguin" [...] and [...] "Say Hello to My Little Friend". Again, Screen Crush's Kevin Fitzpatrick was also disappointed that there would not be a second season. Verne Gay of Newsday gave the episode a complimenting review. He called it [...] "promising". He noted that he could see [...] "why Awake was canceled". He blessed [...] "the show for at least trying". He called it [...] "challenging" [...] and [...] "original". Alan Sepinwall of HitFix called the episode [...] "fascinating", [...] "puzzling" [...] and [...] "moving". Carl Cortez of Assignment X, again, enjoyed the episode. In his [...] "B+" [...] grade review, he noted that [...] "you can view it as another missed opportunity". He claimed that parts of the episode were [...] "confusing". He stated that he would [...] "prefer to have more questions than answers". He argued that the episode felt more like a [...] "Series Finale, than Season Finale", which he called [...] "a good thing", [...] "Too many good shows go off into the sunset without a single resolution <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>one</b> at least strives for something more".
