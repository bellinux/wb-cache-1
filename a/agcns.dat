The influence of temperature and surface ion concentration on adsorption equilibria of europium and barium ions was also investigated. Values (z - z 2 ̆ 7) a or a {{from the equation}} for the Schulze-Hardy rule in Mirnik 2 ̆ 7 s ion exchange theory have been calculated from the measured adsorbed quantities of europium ion. Calculated values for (z - z 2 ̆ 7) a or a for the europium - other counterion couple show the valence effect. Less pronounced differences in (z - z 2 ̆ 7) a or a values obtained for counterions with equal valence depend on the counterion nature, analogously to the lyothropic series at coagulation. The results obtained are discussed considering the previously known values of a constant from the Schulze-Hardy rule for particular counterion couples, and the chemical behaviour of particular counterions in the adsorption systems followed.

40|$|Quantitative {{understanding}} of the fate of cyanide in the environment {{and its role in}} industrial processes requires quantitative characterisation of metal ion–cyanide complex formation and also the corresponding metal ion hydrolysis reactions that frequently compete with them. This thesis presents quantitative data for complex formation constants obtained using a range of techniques for a number of metal ion–hydroxide and metal ion–cyanide systems of environmental and hydrometallurgical importance that have been found difficult to study in the past. A specially–constructed combined spectrophotometric /potentiometric cell has enabled a variety of systems to be studied by UV–Visible spectroscopy at very low metal ion concentrations. This has circumvented problems associated with precipitation and/or polynuclear metal complex formation, which frequently predominate in these systems at higher concentrations. Using this approach it has been possible to determine the formation constants and spectra of the mononuclear hydroxide complexes of Pb(II), Cu(II), Fe(III), Ag(I) and for the cyanide complexes of Pb(II), Ag(I), Ni(II) and Fe(III). It has also been possible to estimate the solubility products of Pb(CN) 2 (s), AgOH(s), <b>AgCN(s)</b> and NaFeFe(CN) 6 (s). For some of these species (namely, Pb(OH) 42 –, the higher order hydroxo–complexes of Cu(II) and Fe(III), Pb(CN) +, and the lower cyano–complexes of Fe(III)), the present results are the first quantitative estimates of their formation constants. These complexes have long been assumed to exist on theoretical grounds but have proven difficult to quantify experimentally. The main reasons for this difficulty are the sparing solubility of the neutral hydroxides and /or cyanides and the tendency of CN– to form either very weak or extremely strong complexes. Where possible, attempts were made to confirm the spectrophotometric results using other techniques such as polarography, NMR spectroscopy (for Pb(II)), Raman spectroscopy and, for Cu(II), ESR spectroscopy. However, although these techniques were sometimes able to provide useful insights into the nature of the species formed, in general they were not sufficiently sensitive, or suffered from other constraints that meant that they yielded little quantitative information. The formation constants measured in this work were combined with literature data to model the chemical behaviour of hypothetical cyanide–infiltrated soil. This modelling indicates that under typical contaminated soil conditions (i. e. soil containing Fe(OH) 3 (s) and [CN–] = 0. 1 mM), cyanide will be present mainly as the various forms of Prussian blue. However, strong competition between cyanide and hydroxide ions for Fe(III), points to possible conditions for the chemical degradation of the Prussian blue...|$|E

Adsorption of Au(CN) 2 − and <b>Ag(CN)</b> 2 − on carbon degassed at 950 °C under 10 − 5 torr (1. 33 × 10 − 3 P) vacuum is decreased by 50 pct compared with the adsorption on normal activated carbon.

The effect of organic solvents and the variation in the potential of the two types of carbon upon adsorption of Au(CN) 2 − were also investigated. These results indicate that activated carbon behaves like an ion-exchange resin but is capable of oxidizing cyanide and cyanide complexes by chemisorbed oxygen. A dual mechanism for the adsorption of Au(CN) 2 − and <b>Ag(CN)</b> 2 − onto activated carbon is therefore proposed, in which cyanide complexes adsorb on carbon by anion exchange with OH− followed by partial oxidative decomposition of Au(CN) 2 − or <b>Ag(CN)</b> 2 − to insoluble AuCN or <b>AgCN...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Biological {{networks}} {{characterize the}} interactions of biomolecules at a systems-level. One important property of biological networks is the modular structure, in which nodes are densely connected with each other, but between which there are only sparse connections. In this report, we attempted to find {{the relationship between the}} network topology and formation of modular structure by comparing gene co-expression networks with random networks. The organization of gene functional modules was also investigated. Results We constructed a genome-wide Arabidopsis gene co-expression network (<b>AGCN)</b> by using 1094 microarrays. We then analyzed the topological properties of <b>AGCN</b> and partitioned the network into modules by using an efficient graph clustering algorithm. In the <b>AGCN,</b> 382 hub genes formed a clique, and they were densely connected only to a small subset of the network. At the module level, the network clustering results provide a systems-level understanding of the gene modules that coordinate multiple biological processes to carry out specific biological functions. For instance, the photosynthesis module in <b>AGCN</b> involves a very large number (> 1000) of genes which participate in various biological processes including photosynthesis, electron transport, pigment metabolism, chloroplast organization and biogenesis, cofactor metabolism, protein biosynthesis, and vitamin metabolism. The cell cycle module orchestrated the coordinated expression of hundreds of genes involved in cell cycle, DNA metabolism, and cytoskeleton organization and biogenesis. We also compared the <b>AGCN</b> constructed in this study with a graphical Gaussian model (GGM) based Arabidopsis gene network. The photosynthesis, protein biosynthesis, and cell cycle modules identified from the GGM network had much smaller module sizes compared with the modules found in the <b>AGCN,</b> respectively. Conclusion This study reveals new insight into the topological properties of biological networks. The preferential hub-hub connections might be necessary for the formation of modular structure in gene co-expression networks. The study also reveals new insight into the organization of gene functional modules. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{adsorption}} of Au(CN) 2 − and <b>Ag(CN)</b> 2 − onto {{activated carbon}} has been correlated with potential measurements of carbon. It is proposed that Au(CN) 2 −, <b>Ag(CN)</b> 2 −, and CN− are adsorbed on carbon by both an ion exchange mechanism and an oxidative reaction {{which leads to}} a decrease in carbon potential. The potential of carbon decreased according to the degree of anion adsorption in the order Au(CN) 2 − > <b>Ag(CN)</b> 2 − > CN− > I− > Cl−. Adsorption of anions is accompanied by release of OH− ion which raises the solution pH and decreases the carbon potential. The potential of carbon in contact with solutions containing KAu(CN) 2, KAg(CN) 2, or KCN is much more negative than that in contact with chloride solution at the same pH.

Deletions, defined as <b>AGCN</b> value of < 004, accompanied only erbB- 1 amplification and occurred in 26. 5 % of all cases. There was a polymorphic simple sequence repeat region of 12 – 20 CA detected in the first intron of erbB- 1. Homozygotes comprised 31 % of the examined group. The majority of homozygous pts revealed 14 / 14 CA repeat combination. LOH (most frequently affecting shorter allele) was determined in breast cancer heterozygotes and occurred in 50 % of cases. Correlations between these findings and clinical outcomes will be presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{electrodeposition}} {{of silver}} from thiourea and cyanide solutions {{has been investigated}} using cyclic voltammetry, potential step measurements and ac voltammetry {{as well as in}} situ surface Raman spectroscopy (SERS). In the case of thiourea containing solutions the adsorption of this compound was detected over the whole potential range. No evidence was found for the adsorption of solution free silver—thiourea complexes. Crystal growth takes place through this strongly adsorbed thiourea layer. By contrast to the case of the silver—thiourea system, SERS of cyanide containing solutions shows the adsorption of at least one silver—cyanide complex assigned to <b>Ag(CN)</b> &# 8722; 2. At negative potentials adsorption of CN&# 8722; is maintained, adsorption sites being coordinated to more than one CN&# 8722; species. This investigation shows that SERS can be used for the investigation of electrodeposition processes. Relatively intense signals can be obtained from surfaces which can only have atomic scale roughness features...|$|R
40|$|The {{enthalpy}} changes {{associated with}} the complexation of CuI, AgI, ZnII and CdII by cyanide to form Cu(CN) 43 –, <b>Ag(CN)</b> 2 –, Zn(CN) 42 – and Cd(CN) 42 – have been determined by titration calorimetry in (wherever possible) both aqueous NaCl and NaClO 4 media at an ionic strength of 1 mol 1 – 1 and 25 °C. The corresponding entropy changes were calculated by combining these data with stability constants from the literature. The H values show little dependence on the medium but the S values vary considerably. This is attributed to competitive complexation {{of some of the}} metal ions by Cl–. The great stability of the cyanide complexes in aqueous solution is shown to be due entirely to the favourable H term as S is negative. Possible reasons for these effects and their variation between metal ions are discussed in terms of the solvation characteristics of the species involved...|$|R
40|$|The {{extraction}} of silver(I) from argentocyanide aqueous cyanide solutions using LIX 79 has been studied. Different variables {{that could affect}} the extraction system were evaluated: equilibration time, aqueous pH, metal and extractant concentrations, and organic phase diluent. The {{extraction of}} the <b>Ag(CN)</b> 2 − complex with respect to other metal-cyano complexes has also been studied on both synthetic and real leach solutions. Experimental data relating to silver have been analysed numerically to determine the stoichiometry of the extracted species and its equilibrium constant. It was found that silver(I) was extracted into the organic phase by {{the formation of the}} species RHAg(CN) 2 (LIX 79 = R). The authors wish to thank Cognis Corp for its gift of a sample of LIX 79 extractant.

40|$|The first {{pyridine}} and picoline functionalised N-heterocyclic carbene complexes {{of nickel}} {{are described in}} this paper. The nature of the isolated complexes is critically dependent on the bite angle and the substituents of the ligand used and the synthetic method for {{the introduction of the}} ligand on the metal. From NiBr 2 (DME), DME= 1, 2 -dimethoxyethane, by transmetallation with one equivalent of <b>Ag(CN)</b> 2]Br 2 (3). Transmetallation with Ag(C-N) Cl, (C-N) = [3 -(2, 6 -Pr- 2 (i) C 6 H 3) 1 [1 -(2 -pyridyl) imidazol- 2 -ylidene] afforded the bimetallic species [(C-N) (2) Ni(mu-Br) (2) NiBr 2] (4), containing one octahedral and one tetrahedral nickel centre. Finally, from the reaction of NiBr 2 (DME) with free (C-N*), (C-N*) = 3 -(2, 6 -(Pr 2 C 6 H 3) -C-i) - 1 -[2 -(3 -picolyl) ]-imidazol- 2 -ylidene, good yields of Ni(C-N*) Br- 2, (6) were obtained.

40|$|Reaction of equimolar {{amounts of}} <b>AgCN</b> and PCy 3 gave the polymer [(Cy 3 P) Ag(NCAgCN) ]∞ (1), whereas {{employment}} of excess PCy 3 yielded the discrete compound [(Cy 3 P) 2 Ag(NCAgCN) ] (2). Reacting bis(dicyclohexylphosphino) -methane (dcpm) with <b>AgCN</b> in 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 molar ratios gave two crystalline forms, namely [Ag 2 (μ-dcpm) 2][Ag-(CN) 2] 2 · (CH 3 OH) 2 (3 a·(CH 3 OH) 2) and [Ag 2 (μ-dcpm) 2][Ag(CN) 2] 2 (3 b), respectively. The similar reaction of CuCN with PCy 3 afforded the polymeric compound [{(Cy 3 P) Cu(CN) } 3]∞ (4), whereas treatment of CuCN with dcpm gave [Cu 2 (μ-dcpm) 2 (CN) 2] (5). Employment of diphosphine ligands with longer -(CH 2) n- spacers, such as 1, 2 -bis-(dicyclohexylphosphino) ethane (dcpe, n = 2) and 1, 3 -bis(diphenylphosphino) propane (dppp, n = 3), in reactions with [Cu(CH 3 CN) 4]PF 6 and KCN afforded the macrocylic compounds [{Cu(dcpe) } 2 (CN) (μ-dcpe) ]PF 6 (6 (PF 6)) and [{Cu(dppp) } 3 (CN) 2 (μ-dppp) ] PF 6 (7 (PF 6)), respectively. The hexanuclear complex [Cu(CN) (PCy 3) ] 6 (8) {{was obtained by}} reacting CuCN with PCy 3 {{in the presence of}} sodium pyridine- 2 -thiolate. The UV-vis absorption spectrum of 1 in acetonitrile displays a weak shoulder at 245 nm (ε = 350 dm 3 mol - 1 cm - 1). For 3 a, 3 b, and 5, the intense absorption bands at λ max = 257 - 276 nm with ε values of (1. 73 - 1. 80) × 10 4 dm 3 mol - 1 cm - 1 are assigned to [ndσ* → (n + 1) pσ] transitions. Complexes 3 a and 3 b emit at λ max = 365 nm in CH 3 CN (quantum yield ∼ 6 × 10 - 3, lifetime ∼ 0. 2 μs). The solid-state emission of 5 (λ max = 470 and 488 nm at 298 and 77 K) is red-shifted in energy from that of 4 (λ max = 401 and 405 nm at 298 and 77 K, respectively). In 77 K MeOH/EtOH (1 : 4) glassy solution, complexes 4 - 8 display intense emission with λ max at 382 - 416 nm, which is assigned to the [3 d → (4 s, 4 p) ] triplet excited state. © 2005 American Chemical Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTo {{extensively}} {{explore the}} influence of anion structure on the physical properties of poly(ionic liquid) s (PILs) a series of PILs having main-chain 1, 2, 3 -triazolium cations was synthesized via copper(I) -catalyzed azide-alkyne 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition (CuAAC) followed by N-alkylation with iodomethane and anion metathesis with different metal salts, that is, Li(CF 3 SO 2) (2) N, Li(CF 3 CF 2 SO 2) (2) N, K(FSO 2) (2) N, K(CF 3 SO 2) N(CN), <b>Ag(CN)</b> (2) N, and sodium 4, 5 -dicyano- 1, 2, 3 -triazolate. To isolate the effect of anion on physical properties of PILs, a common iodide precursor was used to maintain constant the average degree of polymerization (DPn) and chain dispersity. Detailed structure/properties relationship analyses demonstrated a lack of correlation between anion chemical structure, ionic conductivity, and glass transition temperatures. Among synthesized series, the PIL derivative having bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide counter anion showed the best compromise in performance: low glass transition temperature (T-g=- 268 degrees C), high thermal stability (T-onset = 340 degrees C) and superior ionic conductivity (sigma(DC) = 8. 5 x 10 (- 6) S/cm at 30 degrees C), which makes it an interesting candidate for various key modern electrochemical applications...|$|R
