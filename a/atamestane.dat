50|$|<b>Atamestane</b> (developmental {{code name}} SH-489), {{also known as}} metandroden, as well as 1-methylandrosta-1,4-diene-3,17-dione, is a steroidal {{aromatase}} inhibitor that was studied {{in the treatment of}} cancer. It blocks the production of estrogen in the body. The drug is selective, competitive, and irreversible in its inhibition of aromatase.|$|E
50|$|Exemestane {{is known}} {{chemically}} as 6-methylideneandrosta-1,4-diene-3,17-dione. Like the aromatase inhibitors formestane and <b>atamestane,</b> exemestane is a steroid that is structurally similar to 4-androstenedione, the natural substrate of aromatase. It is {{distinguished from the}} natural substance only by the methylidene group in position 6 and an additional double bond in position 1.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{concept of}} {{estrogen}} withdrawal by an aromatase inhibitor {{in the treatment}} of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) was assessed in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter trial. METHODS: Two hundred and ninety-two patients with clinical symptoms of BPH were randomly allocated to one of the following treatments for 48 weeks: placebo or the selective aromatase inhibitor, <b>atamestane,</b> at a daily dose of 100 mg or 300 mg. Both doses of <b>atamestane</b> significantly reduced serum concentrations of estradiol and estrone, and produced a slight, dose-dependent, counter-regulatory increase in peripheral androgen concentration. RESULTS: Clinical symptoms improved during treatment in all three groups. Even after 48 weeks, the effect of active treatment did not exceed the effect seen with placebo. Overall tolerance of 100 mg <b>atamestane</b> was excellent, but 300 mg showed a slightly increased incidence of side effects compared with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: The conclusion from this study is that the reduction in estrogen concentration using the selective aromatase inhibitor <b>atamestane</b> has no effect on clinically established BPH...|$|E
40|$|We {{tested the}} {{theoretical}} concept that a selective decrease in estrogens has a beneficial therapeutic effect on established benign prostatic hyperplasia. In a double-blind study 160 patients from 14 centers were randomized between 2 groups to receive either placebo or the aromatase inhibitor <b>atamestane</b> (1 -methyl-androsin- 1, 4 diene- 3 17 -dione, 400 mg. daily for 48 weeks). The aromatase inhibitor decreased the mean estradiol level by approximately 40 % and estrone by 60 %. The testosterone concentration increased {{by more than}} 40 % and dihydrotestosterone increased to 30 %. Analysis of clinical parameters showed no difference between placebo and <b>atamestane.</b> The counter regulatory increase in androgens may counterbalance any positive effect of the decrease in estrogens to preserve intraprostatic homeostasi...|$|E
40|$|To compare time to {{progression}} (TTP) with a steroidal aromatase inhibitor (AI) <b>atamestane</b> (ATA) {{combined with}} toremifene (TOR; complete estrogen blockade) versus letrozole (LET) in receptor-positive advanced breast cancer (ABC). Patients and Methods Eligibility included postmenopausal receptor-positive ABC and adjuvant hormonal therapy com-pleted more than 12 {{months prior to}} study entry. Participants received daily ATA 500 mg with TOR 60 mg (ATA TOR), or letrozole 2. 5 mg (LET). The primary end point was TTP, whereas secondary objectives included objective response (OR), overall survival (OS), and time to treatment failure (TTF). The study had 80 % power to detect a 25 % increase in TTP assuming a TTP of 9. 4 months in the LET population...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Prostatic {{hyperplasia}} can {{be induced}} in both intact and castrated dogs and in intact cynomolgus monkeys {{by the administration}} of androgenic steroids. Estrogenic steroids potentiate this effect in dogs. These changes also can be induced by androstenedione, which increases androgen and estrogen levels. <b>Atamestane</b> (ATA; 1 -methyl- 3, 1 7 -dione-androsta- 1, 4 -diene), a potent aromatase inhibitor, inhibits some of the androstendione-induced effects; however, the nonsterokial aromatase inhibitor, CGS- 16949 A, {{has been reported to}} decrease serum estradiol levels in adult rats but to have no effect on androgen-dependent organ weights. To examine the mechanisms by which ATA affects the rat prostate, in vivo and in vitro studies were conducted using adult rat ventral prostate (VP). Intact Sprague-Dawley rats were injected daily for 14 days with sesame seed oil, ATA (70 mg/kg/day), finasteride (FIN; 5 mg/kg/day), a 5 a-reductase inhibitor, or the combination of FIN plu...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} two steroidal (4 -hydroxyandrostenedione and <b>atamestane)</b> and three non-steroidal (fadrozole, {{vorozole}} and pentrozole) aromatase inhibitors on {{the levels of}} aromatase mRNA and protein were examined using cultured JEG- 3 and HepG 2 cells. Immunocytochemical studies demonstrated increased quantities of immunoreactive aromatase in both cell types {{as a result of}} these treatments. To clarify this effect in detail, quantitation of aromatase protein in JEG- 3 cells was performed after various treatments using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Time-dependent increase was observed with all the aromatase inhibitors except 4 -hydroxyandrostenedione. The three non-steroidal agents caused an approximately fourfold elevation in the cells 24 h after the treatment compared with untreated controls. The inhibitors also appeared to block the rapid degradation observed in JEG- 3 cells after induction with forskolin. However, aromatase mRNA levels in JEG- 3 cells remained unchanged. Furthermore, the increase in aromatase protein in JEG- 3 cells due to the inhibitor action was not blocked by treatment with cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis. These results thus suggest that aromatase inhibitors increase aromatase protein through stabilization and reduced protein turnover as a side-effect of their binding...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} two steroidal (4 -hydroxyandrostenedione and <b>atamestane)</b> and three non-steroidal (fadrozole, vorozole, and pentrozole) {{aromatase}} inhibitors on {{the levels of}} aromatase mRNA and protein were examined in vitro and in vivo. Immunocytochemistry revealed increased quantities of immunoreactive aromatase in human choriocarcinoma-derived JEG- 3 cells in response to pretreatment with the non-steroidal inhibitors. To elucidate this effect in detail, aromatase protein in JEG- 3 cells after treatment with various inhibitors was quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A time-dependent increase in aromatase protein in the cells was observed with all the aromatase inhibitors except 4 -hydroxyandrostenedione, whereas aromatase mRNA levels in the cells remained unchanged during the inhibitor treatment. The three non-steroidal agents caused an approximately fourfold increase in aromatase protein in the cells 24 h after the treatment, as compared with untreated controls. The increase in aromatase protein in the cells was not blocked by treatment with cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis. The inhibitors also appeared to block the rapid degradation observed in JEG- 3 cells after induction by forskolin. In vivo, daily injection of the inhibitors into adult female mice caused increases in levels of both aromatase mRNA and protein in the ovary. The increase in aromatase mRNA in this in vivo study {{could be explained by}} an increase in gonadotropin concentrations in response to decreased plasma concentrations of estrogens. In conclusion, we suggest that aromatase inhibitors increase aromatase protein through stabilization and reduced protein turnover...|$|E
