5|$|After leaving {{government}} service, Matlock has occasionally {{joined with}} other experts to criticize U.S. government policy. On June 26, 1997, he signed an Open Letter to Bill Clinton criticizing plans for NATO expansion. His reason for opposition, as given {{in his testimony}} before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, {{is the belief that}} NATO expansion will preclude significant nuclear arms reduction with Russia, <b>and</b> <b>consequently</b> increase the risk of a terrorist nuclear attack.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 85% of {{individuals}} with this disorder have not been diagnosed <b>and</b> <b>consequently</b> are not receiving lipid-lowering treatments. Physical examination findings can help a physician make the diagnosis of FH. Tendon xanthomas are seen in 20-40% {{of individuals}} with FH and are pathognomonic for the condition. A xanthelasma or corneal arcus may also be seen. These common signs are supportive of the diagnosis, but are non-specific findings.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} 14 in 1904, Kilner {{reached the}} Mitchell Main first team. Although {{selected}} regularly from 1905, Kilner was not particularly successful with the bat. He displayed aggression but often attempted difficult shots <b>and</b> <b>consequently</b> lost his wicket. His bowling was more effective but used infrequently. By 1909 his batting improved; he scored his first century for the team and began to make consistently good scores, attracting the attention of Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{around the}} 2008–09 season, Henrik began {{to expand his}} {{skill-set}} by scoring more goals. His increased tendency to shoot was given an extra push when Daniel suffered the first major injury of his career early in the 2009–10 season, forcing Henrik to play without his brother <b>and</b> <b>consequently</b> pass less often. He recorded the first two 20-goal seasons {{of his career in}} 2008–09 and 2009–10, and increased his shot totals.|$|E

By this time, a total of £11,530,503, including £3,186,868 for the modernisation of the main armament, had been spent on producing Vanguard.|$|E
5|$|Congenital malformation, {{hereditary}} disorders, {{and acquired}} conditions can affect cerebellar structure <b>and,</b> <b>consequently,</b> cerebellar function.

The P.1150 proposal did not meet NATO Basic Military Requirement 3 <b>and,</b> <b>consequently,</b> the P.1154 was born. This Mach 2-capable aircraft retained plenum chamber burning previously designed for the P.1150. Although the technical winner of eleven submissions, follow-on testing and production for the P.1154 did not proceed as a result of political strife.|$|E

Similarly, DFP also reacts with the active site of acetylcholine esterase in the synapses of neurons, <b>and</b> <b>consequently</b> is a potent neurotoxin, with a lethal dose of less than 100mg.|$|E

5|$|During the 1980s {{very few}} {{specialized}} digital forensic tools existed, <b>and</b> <b>consequently</b> investigators often performed live analysis on media, examining computers {{from within the}} operating system using existing sysadmin tools to extract evidence. This practice carried the risk of modifying data on the disk, either inadvertently or otherwise, which led to claims of evidence tampering. A number of tools were created during the early 1990s to address the problem.|$|E
5|$|Early European explorers in North America, {{who were}} {{familiar}} with the smaller red deer of Europe, thought that the larger North American animal resembled a moose, <b>and</b> <b>consequently</b> gave it the name elk, which is the common European name for moose.

5|$|In skeletally {{immature}} individuals, {{the blood}} supply to the epiphyseal bone is good, supporting both osteogenesis and chondrogenesis. With disruption of the epiphyseal plate vessels, varying degrees and depth of necrosis occur, resulting in a cessation of growth to both osteocytes and chondrocytes. In turn, this pattern leads to disordered ossification of cartilage, resulting in subchondral avascular necrosis <b>and</b> <b>consequently</b> OCD.|$|E
