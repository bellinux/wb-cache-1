5|$|A dwarf, in the Dungeons & Dragons (D) fantasy roleplaying game, is a {{humanoid}} race, one of {{the primary}} races available for player characters. The idea for the D dwarf comes from European mythologies and J. R. R. Tolkien's novel The Lord of the Rings (1954-1955), and has been used in D and its predecessor Chainmail since the early 1970s. Variations from the standard dwarf archetype of a short and stout demihuman are commonly called subraces, of which {{there are more than a}} dozen across many different rule sets <b>and</b> <b>campaign</b> settings.|$|E

5|$|As Evolve is multiplayer-focused, {{the design}} team put less time and focus into {{developing}} Evolves narrative <b>and</b> <b>campaign.</b> Conversations between characters were reduced during the multiplayer mode as the design team {{thought that it}} would negatively impact on the conversations between players. However, the story and narrative became more significant in the single-player mode. Evolve does not adapt traditional storytelling methods, nor use a campaign mode, instead, players learn about the Hunters' backstory and the fictional world of Shear by slowly progressing through Evolve. Playing as different characters would also lead to different conversations and dialogues between characters.|$|E
5|$|As supervisor, Newsom had as his {{centerpiece}} a voter initiative called Care Not Cash (Measure N), {{which offered}} care, supportive housing, drug treatment, and help from behavioral health specialists {{for the homeless}} in lieu of direct cash aid from the state's general assistance program. Many homeless rights advocates protested against the initiative. The successfully passed ballot measure raised the political profile of Gavin Newsom and provided the volunteers, donors, <b>and</b> <b>campaign</b> staff that helped make him a leading contender for the mayorship in 2003.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s, {{prosperity}} {{became a}} primary focus in healing revivals. T. L. Osborn began emphasizing prosperity in the 1960s and became {{known for his}} often ostentatious displays of personal wealth. During that decade, Roberts and William Branham criticized other prosperity ministries, arguing that their fund-raising tactics unfairly pressured attendees. These tactics were prompted {{in part by the}} expense of developing nationwide radio networks <b>and</b> <b>campaign</b> schedules. At the same time, leaders of the Pentecostal Assemblies of God denomination often criticized the focus on prosperity taken by independent healing evangelists.|$|E

5|$|McCain had {{fundraising}} {{problems in}} the first half of 2007, due in part to his support for the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, which was unpopular among the Republican base electorate. Large-scale campaign staff downsizing took place in early July, but McCain said that he was not considering dropping out of the race. Later that month, the candidate's campaign manager <b>and</b> <b>campaign</b> chief strategist both departed. McCain slumped badly in national polls, often running third or fourth with 15percent or less support.|$|E

The movement suffered a setback in 1983 when the newly elected Labor Government failed to implement its stated policy of stopping uranium mining. But by the late 1980s, the price of uranium had fallen, the costs of nuclear power had risen, and the anti-nuclear movement seemed to have won its case; CANE was disbanded in 1988.|$|E
