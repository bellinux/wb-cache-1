5|$|With Kilmer's casting, Warner Bros. dropped Rene Russo as Chase Meridian. Robin Wright, Jeanne Tripplehorn and Linda Hamilton {{were all}} being {{considered}} the role was recast with Nicole Kidman. Billy Dee Williams {{took on the}} role of Harvey Dent in Batman on the possibility of portraying Two-Face in a sequel, but Schumacher cast Tommy Lee Jones in the role, after having worked with him on The Client. Jones was reluctant to accept the role, but did so after his son's insistence. Robin Williams was in discussions to be the Riddler at one point. In a 2003 interview, Schumacher stated Michael Jackson lobbied hard for the role, but was turned down before Jim Carrey was cast. Robin appeared in the shooting script of Batman Returns but was deleted due to too many characters. Marlon Wayans had been cast in the role, and signed for a potential sequel. It was decided to replace Wayans with a white actor. Leonardo DiCaprio was considered, but decided not to pursue the role after a meeting with Schumacher. Chris O'Donnell was cast and Mitchell Gaylord served as his stunt double. Schumacher attempted to create a cameo role for Bono as his MacPhisto character, but both came to <b>agree</b> <b>it</b> was not suitable for the film.|$|E
25|$|The precise dating of the Constitution of Medina remains debated but {{generally}} scholars <b>agree</b> <b>it</b> was written {{shortly after the}} hijra (622). It effectively established the first Islamic state. The Constitution established: {{the security of the}} community, religious freedoms, the role of Medina as a sacred place (barring all violence and weapons), the security of women, stable tribal relations within Medina, a tax system for supporting the community in time of conflict, parameters for exogenous political alliances, a system for granting protection of individuals, a judicial system for resolving disputes, and also regulated the paying of blood-wite (the payment between families or tribes for the slaying of an individual in lieu of lex talionis).|$|E
25|$|Satan's bolete is poisonous, {{especially}} when eaten raw, but also when cooked. The symptoms, which are predominantly gastrointestinal in nature, include violent vomiting, which can {{last up to}} six hours. However, English mycologist John Ramsbottom reported in 1953 that it is consumed in parts of Italy and the former Czechoslovakia. Furthermore, some in the San Francisco Bay Area report having eaten it regularly without ill effects. However, all <b>agree</b> <b>it</b> must always be cooked. Ramsbottom speculated {{that there may be}} a regional variation in the toxicity, and concedes it may not be as poisonous as widely reported. This has been echoed by some contemporary mycologists; Rubroboletus satanas is rarely sampled casually due to its putrid smell and blue bruising.|$|E

25|$|Circa 1504, Raphael {{executed}} {{a pen and}} ink sketch, today in the Louvre museum, in which the subject is flanked by large columns,. Experts universally <b>agree</b> <b>it</b> is based on Leonardo’s portrait of Mona Lisa. Other later copies of the Mona Lisa, such as that in the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design in Oslo, and The Walters Art Museum in Baltimore also display large flanking columns. As a result, it was originally thought that the Mona Lisa in the Louvre had side columns and had been cut. However, as early as 1993, Zöllner observed that the painting surface had never been trimmed. This was confirmed {{through a series of}} tests conducted in 2004. In view of this, Vincent Delieuvin, curator of 16th century Italian painting at the Louvre museum states that the sketch and these other copies must have been inspired by another version, while Frank Zöllner states that the sketch brings up the possibility that Leonardo {{executed a}}nother work on the subject of Mona Lisa.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of the rebellion, the {{weaknesses}} of the federal government as constituted under the Articles of Confederation were apparent to many. A vigorous debate was going on throughout the states on the need for a stronger central government, with Federalists arguing for the idea, and Anti-Federalists opposing them. [...] Historical opinion is divided on what sort of role the rebellion played in the formation and later ratification of the United States Constitution, although most scholars <b>agree</b> <b>it</b> played some role, at least temporarily drawing some anti-Federalists to the strong government side.|$|E
500|$|The {{timing of}} the arrival of {{smallpox}} in Europe and south-western Asia is less clear. Smallpox is not clearly described in either the Old or New Testaments of the Bible or {{in the literature of}} the Greeks or Romans. While some have identified the Plague of Athens—which was said to have originated in [...] "Ethiopia" [...] and Egypt—or the plague that lifted Carthage's 396 BC siege of Syracuse with smallpox, many scholars <b>agree</b> <b>it</b> is very unlikely such a serious disease as variola major would have escaped being described by Hippocrates if it had existed in the Mediterranean region during his lifetime. While the Antonine Plague that swept through the Roman Empire in AD 165180 may have been caused by smallpox, Saint Nicasius of Rheims became the patron saint of smallpox victims for having supposedly survived a bout in 450, and Saint Gregory of Tours recorded a similar outbreak in France and Italy in 580, the first use of the term variola; other historians speculate that Arab armies first carried smallpox from Africa into Southwestern Europe during the 7th and 8th centuries. In the 9th century the Persian physician, Rhazes, provided one of the most definitive descriptions [...] of smallpox and was the first to differentiate smallpox from measles and chickenpox in his Kitab fi al-jadari wa-al-hasbah (The Book of Smallpox and Measles). During the Middle Ages, smallpox made periodic incursions into Europe but did not become established there until the population increased and population movement became more active during the era of the Crusades. By the 16th century smallpox had become well established across most of Europe. With its introduction into populated areas in India, China and Europe, smallpox affected mainly children, with periodic epidemics that killed as many as 30 percent of those infected. The settled existence of smallpox in Europe was of particular historical importance, since successive waves of exploration and colonization by Europeans tended to spread the disease {{to other parts of the}} world. By the 16th century it had become an important cause of morbidity and mortality throughout much of the world.|$|E

2500|$|It is no overstatement to {{say that}} the opening of Lord’s and the {{foundation}} of (or reorganisation of the gentlemen's club as) MCC in 1787 ended what H T Waghorn called The Dawn of Cricket.

2500|$|Although the {{writings}} of prominent Theosophists lay out a variety of teachings, the Theosophical Society itself states {{that it has no}} official beliefs with which all members must <b>agree.</b> <b>It</b> therefore has doctrine but not dogma. Many of these teachings were set down in the work of Helena Blavatsky, although revisions and innovations have also been produced by subsequent Theosophists like Annie Besant and Charles Leadbeater. Blavatsky claimed that these Theosophical doctrines were not her own invention, but had been received from a brotherhood of secretive spiritual adepts whom she referred to as the [...] "Masters" [...] or [...] "Mahatmas".|$|E
2500|$|The {{impact of}} the Cross of Sacrifice on war memorialization is {{difficult}} to underestimate. The IWGC considered the artwork a [...] "mark of {{the symbolism of the}} present crusade".

[...] First World War historian Bruce Scates observes that its symbolism was effective throughout the Commonwealth, despite widely disparate cultural and religious norms.
