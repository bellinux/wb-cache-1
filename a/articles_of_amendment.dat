5|$|On June 8, 1789, Representative James Madison {{introduced}} nine {{amendments to}} the constitution in the House of Representatives. Among his recommendations Madison proposed opening up the Constitution and inserting specific rights limiting the power of Congress in Article One, Section 9. Seven of these limitations would {{become part of the}} ten ratified Bill of Rights amendments. Ultimately, on September 25, 1789, Congress approved twelve <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>amendment</b> to the Constitution, each consisting of one one-sentence paragraph, and submitted them to the states for ratification. Contrary to Madison's original proposal that the articles be incorporated into {{the main body of the}} Constitution, they were proposed as supplemental additions (codicils) to it. Articles Three through Twelve were ratified as additions to the Constitution on December 15, 1791, and became Amendments One through Ten of the Constitution. Article Two became part of the Constitution on May 5, 1992, as the Twenty-seventh Amendment. Article One is technically still pending before the states.|$|E
5|$|Three {{states did}} not {{complete}} action on the twelve <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>amendment</b> when they were initially put before the states. Georgia found a Bill of Rights unnecessary and so refused to ratify. Both chambers of the Massachusetts General Court ratified {{a number of the}} amendments (the Senate adopted 10 of 12 and the House 9 of 12), but failed to reconcile their two lists or to send official notice to the Secretary of State of the ones they did agree upon. Both houses of the Connecticut General Assembly voted to ratify Articles Three through Twelve but failed to reconcile their bills after disagreeing over whether to ratify Articles One and Two. All three later ratified the Constitutional amendments originally known as Articles Three through Twelve as part of the 1939 commemoration of the Bill of Rights' sesquicentennial: Massachusetts on March 2, Georgia on March 18, and Connecticut on April 19. Connecticut and Georgia would also later ratify Article Two, on May 13, 1987 and February 2, 1988 respectively.|$|E

50|$|An {{article of}} {{amendment}} may, however, explicitly express itself {{as having the}} effect of repealing a specific existing article.

50|$|On January 28, 1790, the Delaware General Assembly {{ratified}} {{eleven of}} the <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>amendment,</b> rejecting only this proposed amendment.

5000|$|This {{amendment}} {{was one of}} several proposed amendments to the Constitution introduced first in the House on June 8, 1789, by Representative James Madison of Virginia. Madison's original intent was that it be added {{to the end of the}} first sentence in Article I, Section 6, Clause 1 of the Constitution, [...] "The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States". This, along with Madison's other proposals were referred to a committee consisting of one representative from each state. After emerging from committee, the full House debated the issue and, on August 24, 1789, passed it and sixteen other <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>amendment.</b> The proposals went next to the Senate, which made 26 substantive alterations.

50|$|The Massachusetts Constitution {{was written}} {{last of the}} {{original}} states' first constitutions. Rather than taking {{the form of a}} list of provisions, it was organized into a structure of chapters, sections, and articles. It served {{as a model for the}} Constitution of the United States of America, drafted seven years later, which used a similar structure. It also influenced later revisions of many other state constitutions. The Massachusetts Constitution has four parts: a preamble, a declaration of rights, a description of the framework of government, and <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>amendment.</b>|$|E
50|$|Because George Washington lent his {{prestige}} to the Constitution {{and because}} of the ingenuity and organizational skills of its proponents, the Constitution was ratified by all the states. The outgoing Congress of the Confederation scheduled elections for the new government, and set March 4, 1789 as the date that the new government would take power. In 1789, Congress submitted twelve <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>amendment</b> to the states. Ten of these articles, written by congressional committees, achieved passage on December 15, 1791 and became the United States Bill of Rights. The Tenth Amendment set the guidelines for federalism in the United States.|$|E
50|$|The First United States Congress, {{consisting}} of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives, met from March 4, 1789, to March 4, 1791, {{during the first two}} years of George Washington's presidency, first at Federal Hall in New York City and later at Congress Hall in Philadelphia. With the initial meeting of the First Congress, the United States federal government officially began operations under the new (and current) frame of government established by the 1787 Constitution. The apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives was based on the provisions of Article I, Section 2, Clause 3 of the Constitution. Both chambers had a Pro-Administration majority. Twelve <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>amendment</b> to the Constitution were passed by this Congress and sent to the states for ratification; the ten ratified as additions to the Constitution on December 15, 1791, are collectively known as the Bill of Rights.|$|E
5000|$|The R Document {{occurs during}} a future {{time in the}} United States when crime, {{especially}} violent crime, has become so extreme a problem that FBI Director Vernon T. Tynan is promoting an especially drastic solution: a Thirty-Fifth <b>Article</b> <b>Of</b> <b>Amendment</b> to the Constitution of the United States {{that would allow the}} Bill of Rights to be suspended in favor of its provisions during a national domestic crisis. Tynan, who had joined the Bureau during J. Edgar Hoover's tenure as its Director, had resigned after Hoover had died (saying that [...] "once you had worked for the Old Man...you were spoiled for anyone else" [...] to Ishmael Young, whom he has extorted into ghost-writing his autobiography) rather than work under any of Hoover's successors. (Wallace, indeed, had initially modeled Tynan on Hoover.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Sections 42 and 43, Chapter IV of the NEA decree {{effectively}} repealed {{the power}} to grant [...] "electric system" [...] franchises from the Municipal, City and Provincial Governments {{in favor of the}} NEA.

5000|$|Section 1937bb {{directs the}} Attorney General [...] "to institute, {{in the name}} of the United States, such actions against States or {{political}} subdivisions, including actions for injunctive relief, as he may determine to be necessary to implement the twenty-sixth <b>article</b> <b>of</b> <b>amendment</b> to the Constitution of the United States." [...] 42 U. S. C. § 1973bb (a)(1) (emphasis added). Suits brought under the statute [...] "shall be heard and determined by a court of three judges [...] [...] [...] [...]" [...] § 1973bb (a)(2). The section unambiguously limits the Attorney General's authority to bringing actions against States and political subdivisions. Although the United States brought this suit against the State of Texas and Waller County as well as named individual officials, the District Court's injunction runs only against Symm personally. Indeed, the District Court specifically refused to grant relief [...] "with respect to [...] [...] [...] the State of Texas, and Waller County." ...|$|R

50|$|The {{manner in}} which {{constitutional}} amendments are finally recorded takes two main forms. In most jurisdictions, amendments to a constitution {{take the form of}} revisions to the previous text. Thus, once an amendment has become law, portions of the original text may be deleted or new articles may be inserted among existing ones. The second, less common method, is for amendments to be appended {{to the end of the}} main text in the form of special <b>articles</b> <b>of</b> <b>amendment,</b> leaving the body of the original text intact. Although the wording of the original text is not altered, the doctrine of implied repeal applies. In other words, in the event of conflict, an article of amendment will usually take precedence over the provisions of the original text, or of an earlier amendment. Nonetheless, there may still be ambiguity whether an amendment is intended to supersede or to supplement an existing article in the text.|$|E

5000|$|In 1868, {{under the}} 14th Amendment, all persons [...] "born or {{naturalized}} in the United States, {{and subject to}} the jurisdiction thereof" [...] were declared citizens. However, the jurisdiction requirement was interpreted to exclude most Native Americans, and in 1870, the Senate Judiciary committee further clarified the matter: [...] "the 14th amendment to the Constitution has no effect whatever upon {{the status of the}} Indian tribes within the limits of the United States." [...] About eight percent of the Native population at the time qualified for U.S. citizenship due to being [...] "taxed." [...] Others obtained citizenship by serving in the military, marrying whites or accepting land allotments, such as those granted under the Dawes Act. The exclusion of Native people from US citizenship was further established by Elk v. Wilkins, , when the Court held that a Native person born a citizen of a recognized tribal nation was not born an American citizen and did not become one simply by voluntarily leaving his tribe and settling among whites. The syllabus of the decision explained that a Native person [...] "who has not been naturalized, or taxed, or recognized as a citizen either by the United States or by the state, is not a citizen of the United States within the meaning of the first section <b>of</b> the Fourteenth <b>Article</b> <b>of</b> <b>Amendment</b> <b>of</b> the Constitution." ...|$|R
