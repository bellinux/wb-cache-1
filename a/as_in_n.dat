25|$|Race kallaura, Moore. Of {{this form}} I have seen {{only a few}} specimens. Judging by the types, which {{are now in the}} {{collection}} of the British Museum, it differs less from the typical form than do any of the other races. <b>As</b> <b>in</b> <b>N.</b> soma, the markings are small and narrow; the subbasal band of the hindwing is, however, attenuated at each end, and not of even width, underside: ground colour very much paler and somewhat ochraceous, the anterior and posterior sets of spots of the discal series closer together respectively; the postdiscal band on the hindwing equal in width to the subbasal band. Recorded only so far from Travancore.|$|E

2500|$|The {{mantis shrimp}} {{has one of}} the most {{elaborate}} visual systems ever discovered. Compared to the three types of colour-receptive cones that humans possess in their eyes, the eyes of a mantis shrimp carry 16 types of colour receptive cones. Furthermore, some of these shrimp can tune the sensitivity of their long-wavelength vision to adapt to their environment. This phenomenon, known as [...] "spectral tuning" [...] is species-specific. Cheroske et al. did not observe spectral tuning in [...] Neogonodactylus oerstedii, the species with the most monotonous natural photic environment. In N. bredini, a species with a variety of habitats ranging from 5–10m (although it can be found up to 20m), spectral tuning was observed, but the ability to alter wavelengths of maximum absorbance was not as pronounced <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>N.</b> wennerae: a species with much higher ecological/photic habitat diversity.|$|E

40|$|Complaints about {{difficulties}} in person perception and memory are very common among older adults, {{and the ability}} to learn and recognize faces and names is known to decline with increasing age. However, it is not clear at present to what degree these deficits result from less efficient processing at early perceptual, representational, or episodic memory-related stages. In this thesis five experiments are presented, which aimed at investigating this issue by analyzing event-related brain potential correlates of person perception and memory. Overall, the results indicate that early perceptual face processing (<b>as</b> reflected <b>in</b> the <b>N</b> 170) is relatively less affected by aging than later representational and memory-related stages (<b>as</b> reflected <b>in</b> <b>N</b> 250, N 400, and episodic old/new effects) ...|$|R
