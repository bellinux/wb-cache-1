5000|$|For {{goals with}} {{progress}} certainty, accomplishing a DPM may decrease total motivation to <b>achieve</b> <b>the</b> goal. [...] Amir and Ariely (2008) assert that while approaching a DPM during goal pursuit, motivation to <b>achieve</b> <b>the</b> DPM increases. However, after the DPM is accomplished, motivation declines leading to [...] "a state of complacency." [...] The net result on total motivation to <b>achieve</b> <b>the</b> goal may be negative. [...] Additionally, accomplishing a DPM for a goal with progress certainty, {{may serve as}} a distraction from the end goal. The perception of progress from <b>achieving</b> <b>the</b> DPM may lead to less focus on <b>achieving</b> <b>the</b> ultimate goal end state and more focus on competing goals. Hence, DPMs or subgoals may have overall negative effects on motivation during goal pursuit for goals with progress certainty.|$|R

Sales of plug-in electric vehicles <b>achieved</b> <b>the</b> one million milestone {{almost twice as}} fast as hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). While it took four years and 10 months to reach one-million PEV sales, it took more than around nine years and a few months for HEVs to reach its first million sales. The global ratio between all-electrics (BEVs) and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) has consistently been 60:40 between 2014 and the first half of 2016, mainly due to the large all-electric market in China. In the U.S. and Europe, the ratio is approaching a 50:50 split. All-electric cars have oversold plug-in hybrids, with pure electrics representing about 61% of the global stock of over 2million plug-ins on the world's roads by the end of 2016, up from 58.9% at the end of 2015. Cumulative global sales of highway-capable light-duty pure electric vehicles since 2010 <b>achieved</b> <b>the</b> one million unit milestone in September 2016.
