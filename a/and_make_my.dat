500|$|In 2004, OutKast's {{original}} {{record label}} Arista Records was restructured under the Jive label group. During their hiatus, Big Boi and André 3000 were pressured by Jive {{to produce an}} OutKast album {{instead of focusing on}} their solo work. In July 2009, Big Boi left Jive Records, following creative differences and the label's unwillingness to release and promote his solo album. According to Big Boi, Jive gave him an ultimatum to shop the album elsewhere. In an interview for GQ, he discussed his release from Jive and his discontent with the label for proposing he record a cover of rapper Lil Wayne's [...] "Lollipop", stating [...] "They told me to go in <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>my</b> version of Lil Wayne's Lollipop! I love that song... But how you gonna tell me to go bite another MCs style?... That's the highest form of disrespect ever. So that's when I wanted to get off Jive. And the only honorable thing they've done is allow me to do that". Big Boi expressed that Jive viewed its intended singles as not [...] "radio-friendly" [...] and the album as [...] "a piece of art, and they didn't {{know what to do with}} it".|$|E

2500|$|Line 13 of the couplet states: [...] "For I am shamed by {{that which}} I bring forth." [...] This {{refers to the}} Biblical verses in Mark: 7.20-23 [...] "That which cometh...and defile the man." [...] Line 14 [...] of the couplet states: [...] "And so should you, to love things nothing worth." [...] This alludes to the Biblical verse in Job 24.25 [...] "Who will make me a liar, <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>my</b> speech nothing worth?" [...] Here, The Poet is {{utilizing}} Biblical texts to reaffirm the baseless nature of both himself and his poetry.|$|E
2500|$|During the break, bass guitarist and {{producer}} Chris Taylor released a solo album, Dreams Come True (2011), under the pseudonym CANT, stating, [...] "I can't {{just take a}} break. For whatever reason, I'm {{the kind of person}} who needs to constantly to work on stuff. When we finished touring, I didn't want to take some time off, I just wanted to go into the studio. But, I really didn't want to book myself in with a band and go record them, so I decided I'd try <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>my</b> own record."

2500|$|I {{reviewed}} {{my whole}} work in collecting indemnity and they [...] fully approved and {{are prepared to}} defend the course taken. The correspondents who have written {{were all in the}} dark, and had made no proper inquiries. I have invited correspondents to come and see what was being done, but they did not come. I have been very unjustly treated by these writers, and my friends are coming to the front in defense, as all the missions have done the same things, and all believe they are right. So also does Mr. Conger, who is our good friend. Do not be disturbed by anything you see in the papers. The correspondents jump on to the missionaries when they are out of matter, and news has been very scarce this winter.

2500|$|In 1968 Corea read Dianetics, Hubbard's most {{well known}} {{self-help}} book, {{and in the}} early 1970s developed an interest in Hubbard's science fiction novels. [...] "I came into contact with L. Ron Hubbard's material in 1968 with Dianetics and it kind of opened my mind up and it got me into seeing that my potential for communication was a lot greater than I thought it was."The two exchanged letters until Hubbard's death in 1986, and Corea had three guest appearances on Hubbard's 1982 album Space Jazz: The Soundtrack of the Book Battlefield Earth, noting, [...] " [...] was a great composer and keyboard player as well. He did many, many things. He was a true Renaissance Man." [...] Corea said that Scientology became a profound influence on his musical direction in the early 1970s: [...] "I no longer wanted to satisfy myself. I really want to connect with the world <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>my</b> music mean something to people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding {{the idea}} of gaining a day, Verne said of its origin: [...] "I have {{a great number of}} {{scientific}} odds and ends in my head. It was thus that, when, one day in a Paris café, I read in the Siècle that a man could travel around the world in 80 days, it immediately struck me that I could profit by a difference of meridian <b>and</b> <b>make</b> <b>my</b> traveller gain or lose a day in his journey. There was a dénouement ready found. The story was not written until long after. I carry ideas about in my head for years – ten, or 15 years, sometimes – before giving them form." [...] In his April 1873 lecture, [...] "The Meridians and the Calendar", Verne responded to a question about where the change of day actually occurred, since the international date line had only become current in 1880 and the Greenwich prime meridian was not adopted internationally until 1884. Verne cited an 1872 article in Nature, and Edgar Allan Poe's short story [...] "Three Sundays in a Week" [...] (1841), which was also based on going around the world and the difference in a day linked to a marriage at the end. Verne even analysed Poe's story in his Edgar Poe and His Works (1864). Poe's story [...] "Three Sundays in a Week" [...] was clearly the inspiration for the lost day plot device.|$|E
