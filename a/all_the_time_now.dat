500|$|The {{title of}} [...] "Compass Point", a song Frankel wrote in 45 minutes, is a {{reference}} to Chris Blackwell's Compass Point Studios, where numerous popular musicians in the style mixture of funk, reggae and synthpop, that Crime Cutz pays a tribute to, recorded their music. Its working title was [...] "Back to Earth", {{and was the first}} song to be written for but was not included on their second studio album Dynamics. As Millhiser explains, [...] "There was always some indescribable thing about it that irked us, so we went back to that song with the intention of being like, 'Oh, you know, it’s just a matter of re-recording the vocals or the piano, and it’ll be done.' That of course was not the case, and we ended basically just keeping the drums and one line from the song, making a totally different song out of it, essentially remixing ourselves." [...] Frankel called the EP's closer, [...] "Footsteps", to be the least rhythmic of all the tracks. Its original title was [...] "Your Favorite Band/Footsteps". As Frankel described coming up with the name, [...] "I was going the other night to see our friends in Hot Chip. When I was there, I overheard some people saying, 'I thought they were playing, but they’re DJing,' and that’s something that happens <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>now.</b> People go to see their favorite band, and it turns out it’s a DJ set. I thought it was kind of funny, and also kind of sad — but in a funny way." [...] While the version of Crime Cutz that was officially released only consists of four tracks, Holy Ghost! said in their January 2016 announcement of the EP that a fifth track might be included; [...] "We’re still messing around, because {{we have a lot of}} demos from this last year and a half, and we’re sifting through, figuring out if there’s one more we want to finish." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I haven't. My first trip. But we've {{been all}} around--Paris and everywhere. I'm to enter Harvard next year.

6000|$|... "But I am," [...] he protested, with passion. [...] "I {{used to do}} things. But since--since I've met you I've lost my nerve. I'm {{crazy for}} you. You let the other men run after you.

6000|$|... "It was {{all very}} simple," [...] she said. [...] "The first Mrs. Harvey, who was alive then, was my {{greatest}} friend, and I {{was in and out}} of the place <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>Now,</b> perhaps, you can understand the significance of that marconigram from Hamilton Fynes asking me to lunch with him at the Carlton today." ...|$|E

60|$|At last, {{the bark}} came so near {{that we could}} see the people on board, but still she went past us. This was the hardest to bear of all, for she seemed so near.

60|$|When we {{were well}} past the shrubbery, she slackened a little in her urgency, and so we came along the slope under the beeches to the garden.

6000|$|Here I {{interrupted}} him. I {{was getting}} bewildered. He so crowded {{on my mind}} his list of nature's eccentricities and possible impossibilities that my imagination was getting fired.

6000|$|Blue Bob {{stood on}} the very point of the pier, where the strong stone-work divided the current, and held his hooked pole {{ready to make a}} clutch at the roof, {{whichever}} side it took.

6000|$|... "But," [...] replied Mary, [...] "you may dream {{several hours}} in the night, so as to {{remember}} good long dreams in the morning, and yet perhaps you might have been, for some time, perfectly sound asleep, {{so as not to}} have any dreams in your mind at all. Some persons think we dream all the time when we are asleep, and others think we don't dream <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>Now</b> we might contrive some experiments to decide the question." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Foolish!" [...] muttered Grandfather Frog. [...] "Foolish, {{foolish to}} be so afraid! Now, I'm not afraid until I see {{something}} to be afraid of. Time enough then.

6000|$|... "Then," [...] he continued, [...] "when {{he came to}} supper, I would say, 'He is bathing now; {{you must}} come some other time;' or else, 'He is going to sleep, and you will disturb him.'

6000|$|Well, {{pretty soon}} {{the whole town}} was there, squirming and scrouging and pushing and shoving {{to get at the}} window and have a look, but people that had the places wouldn't give them up, and folks behind them was saying <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> [...] "Say, <b>now,</b> you've looked enough, you fellows; 'tain't right and 'tain't fair for you to stay thar <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> and never give nobody a chance; other folks has their rights as well as you." ...|$|R
60|$|FALDER. It's no good deceiving you, Mr. Cokeson. The fact is, I {{seem to be}} {{struggling}} against a thing that's all round me.

6000|$|... 'You'll {{come back}} with so much to tell me, that it'll take {{at least a week}} to make me understand!' said Dora.

60|$|It was {{the only}} {{breath of fresh air}} which I had allowed myself <b>all</b> <b>the</b> morning, though the {{dazzling}} sunlight and the soft west wind had tempted me <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> And <b>now,</b> as ill luck would have it, I had walked straight into the presence of the one person in the world whom I wished most earnestly to avoid.

A dry twig snapped beneath my feet, and, turning quickly round, she had seen me. She came forward at once, and for some reason or other I knew that she was glad. She smiled upon me almost gaily.|$|R
