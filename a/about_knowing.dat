25|$|As a child, Steve Jr. {{had heard}} his late father's stories of adventures with Wonder Woman during World War II. It is {{essentially}} confirmed {{in the second}} season première that his father never introduced him to Wonder Woman {{and that he had}} never even seen her photographed. It is similarly implied that he and YN1 Diana Prince were unaware of each other. Diana is taken aback by the younger Steve's existence, implying that his father had never spoken of the boy to either Wonder Woman or YN1 Prince. This was particularly striking when she spoke to Steve Jr. <b>about</b> <b>knowing</b> his father well, from the j-shaped burn scar on his right shoulder, to the 20mm shell casing that he used as a paperweight.|$|E
25|$|The {{authors of}} the 2007 Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture cited poor {{governance}} as one reason for some forms of water scarcity. Water governance is the set of formal and informal processes through which decisions related to water management are made. Good water governance is primarily <b>about</b> <b>knowing</b> what processes work best in a particular physical and socioeconomic context. Mistakes have sometimes been made by trying to apply 'blueprints' that work {{in the developed world}} to developing world locations and contexts. The Mekong river is one example; a review by the International Water Management Institute of policies in six countries that rely on the Mekong river for water found that thorough and transparent cost-benefit analyses and environmental impact assessments were rarely undertaken. They also discovered that Cambodia's draft water law was much more complex than it needed to be.|$|E
25|$|Carl {{arrives at}} Bianca Butcher's (Patsy Palmer) house, after she {{telephones}} him thinking his number {{belonged to her}} father David Wicks (Michael French). Bianca assumes Carl is the plumber, but when the real plumber arrives, Carl says he is the friend of Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman) that Bianca called. He learns that Derek is dead, and claims to know his daughter Alice Branning (Jasmyn Banks), so Bianca gives him her address. He visits Alice, who gives him the box that contained the phone number, which Alice says was found by Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). Bianca's friend Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace) realises that Carl lied <b>about</b> <b>knowing</b> Alice and warns Alice and Bianca {{to be wary of}} him. Carl visits Ian, who denies knowing Derek. Carl realises Ian took £10,000 from the box that Derek owed him, and Ian is terrified of Carl. The next day, Carl sees his ex-girlfriend, Kirsty Branning (Kierston Wareing), who says she is now married and pregnant, and he has no reason to stay. At the restaurant, Carl makes Ian confess to taking his money, and tells Ian to pay him £500 a week for the foreseeable future. He then tells Kirsty he is not leaving. Ian soon realises the situation between Carl and Kirsty, so he threatens to tell Kirsty about Carl's blackmail. Carl responds by burning Ian's hand.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe study {{reasoning}} in Levesque's logic of only knowing. In particular, we first prove that extending a decidable subset of first-order logic {{with the ability}} of reasoning <b>about</b> only <b>knowing</b> preserves decidability of reasoning, as long as quantifying-in is not allowed in the language, and define a general method for reasoning <b>about</b> only <b>knowing</b> in such a case. Then, we show {{that the problem of}} reasoning <b>about</b> only <b>knowing</b> in the propositional case lies at the second level of the polynomial hierarchy. Thus, it is as hard as {{reasoning in}} the majority of propositional formalisms for nonmonotonic reasoning, like default logic, circumscription, and autoepistemic logic, and it is easier than reasoning in propositional formalisms based on the minimal knowledge paradigm, which is strictly related to the notion of only knowing. Finally, we identify a syntactic restriction in which reasoning <b>about</b> only <b>knowing</b> is easier than in the general propositional case, and provide a specialized deduction method for such a restricted setting...|$|R
500|$|Darren {{came in for}} casting {{and began}} talking <b>about</b> <b>knowing</b> where to source the {{appropriate}} tuxedos, {{and that he could}} wear a pair of Dean Martin's shoes that he owned. During the course of the meeting, Behr became convinced that Darren was performing the Fontaine piece, having moved into it seamlessly. Darren had deliberately avoiding simply reading the script, as he disliked doing cold reads; instead, he had intentionally improvising things that he felt that the character would say. After Darren left, Behr excitedly told the other writers how good he was, but that perhaps they should still see other actors. Producer Hans Beimler replied, [...] "Are you out of your mind? What are you talking about? Vic Fontaine was just in the room. There's no question, there's no question! He's the guy!" ...|$|E
500|$|Natasha's {{personality}} {{began to}} change and in October 2010, Novakovic said [...] "When she arrived she was full-on, {{and that was all}} a part of getting the attention she loves. It's all <b>about</b> <b>knowing</b> that she's liked. But she's more settled now". Novakovic also explained that it is [...] "quite challenging" [...] to play someone so different from herself, but it is fun. She also hoped that she is not as irritating as Natasha in real life and added [...] "I'm not a manipulative teenage girl who's forever wanting everything her own way." [...] In March 2011, Novakovic revealed that she would like to see Natasha become a nicer person, grow up and turn over a new leaf. She said [...] "There are glimpses of the nice girl in Tash." [...] She later said that as she has played the villain for over a year, she would like to show Natasha's [...] "softer, funnier side." [...] Novakovic also hoped that her future storylines could see Natasha's background and her relationship with her mother explored and developed.|$|E
500|$|The Grove Book of Hollywood {{wrote that}} the 1978 film, The Wiz was {{influenced}} by Werner Erhard's teachings and est because actress Diana Ross and writer Joel Schumacher were [...] "very enamored of Werner Erhard." [...] The film's producer Rob Cohen noted that: [...] "before I knew it, the movie was becoming an est-ian fable full of est buzzwords <b>about</b> <b>knowing</b> {{who you are and}} sharing and all that. [...] I hated the script a lot. But it was hard to argue with Diana because she was recognizing in this script all of this stuff that she had worked out in est seminars." [...] Schumacher spoke positively {{of the results of the}} est training, saying: [...] "I will be eternally grateful for learning that I was responsible for my life." [...] Of est and Erhard references in the film itself, The Grove Book of Hollywood notes that the speech delivered by the Good Witch, played by actress Lena Horne, at the end of the film was [...] "a litany of est-like platitudes," [...] and the book also makes est comparisons to the song [...] "Believe in Yourself." ...|$|E

500|$|The album {{opens with}} an orchestral intro that {{introduces}} the first track [...] "Honeymoon Avenue", a downtempo song composed {{in the key}} of F-sharp major and set in a [...] time signature at a moderate tempo of 63 beats per minute. The song explores the 1950s musical style mixing doo-wop with an urban-inspired sound. Lirically, [...] "Honeymoon Avenue" [...] uses several metaphors to speaks about someone in a car being driven by her (romantic) partner. The driver is stuck to the same old route and driving mode that may make them crash. In interview with MTV, Grande explained its lyrics saying that [...] "Honeymoon Avenue" [...] "is <b>about</b> <b>knowing</b> you are {{at the end of}} a relationship and wishing it could not be the end and go back to the beginning and start over." [...] The second track [...] "Baby I" [...] is drenched in a [...] "retro sound" [...] from 1990s R and pop sonority. Lyrically, [...] "Baby I" [...] is a confession on Grande's behalf admitting a special love for someone and how she can't formulate her strong feelings into words. The elements of [...] "Baby I" [...] are further illustrated by its use of finger snaps, a syncopated beat, horns and drums.|$|E
500|$|Joel Schumacher's {{script for}} The Wiz was {{influenced}} by Werner Erhard's teachings and his Erhard Seminars Training ("est") movement, as both Schumacher and Diana Ross were [...] "very enamored of Werner Erhard". [...] "Before I knew it," [...] said Rob Cohen, [...] "the movie was becoming an est-ian fable full of est buzzwords <b>about</b> <b>knowing</b> {{who you are and}} sharing and all that. I hated the script a lot. But it was hard to argue with [...] because she was recognizing in this script all of this stuff that she had worked out in est seminars." [...] Schumacher spoke positively {{of the results of the}} est training, stating that he was [...] "eternally grateful for learning that I was responsible for my life." [...] However, he also complained that [...] "everybody stayed exactly the way they were and went around spouting all this bull****." [...] Of est and Erhard references in the film itself, The Grove Book of Hollywood notes that the speech delivered by Glinda the Good Witch at the end of the film was [...] "a litany of est-like platitudes", and the book also makes est comparisons to the song [...] "Believe in Yourself". Although Joel Schumacher had seen the Broadway play before writing the script, none of the Broadway play's writing was incorporated into the film's.|$|E
2500|$|However, in [...] "Alive on Broadway," [...] they {{introduced}} {{the notion that}} the fictional backstory may be meta-fictional—Kiki spoke of the duo actually being thousands of years old, implying that some of her previous stories were, at least in part, lies told by the character.

I could say nothing on the road, for our women were in the coach with us. the posts were not to be so much relied on as they are at present, and we had to send relays of horses forward to await us at each stage in order to have no delay, and he, who had made the journey before, managed all this excellently for us.|$|E

60|$|She put {{her hand}} on his arm, as if to detain him while she {{considered}} what to do, and Walthew looked <b>about,</b> <b>knowing</b> that he could trust her knowledge of the town. The street was narrow and dark except where the light from the café shone across it. A few citizens sat round the small tables, and several shadowy figures loitered in the gloom outside. Walthew thought they had come with the girl, but there was nothing in their attitude to suggest that they had any particular business in the neighborhood, and his own followers had stopped at the corner.|$|E
60|$|His {{psychological}} eccentricity increased; if one {{can call}} that an eccentricity which was a wild worship of the ordinary. At last he grew so sensitive {{that he could not}} even bear any question answered correctly without grief. He felt there was a touch of disloyalty, of unfraternal individualism, even <b>about</b> <b>knowing</b> the right answer to a sum. If asked the date of the battle of Hastings, he considered it due to social tact and general good feeling to answer 1067. This chivalrous exaggeration led to bad feeling between him and the school authority, which ended in a rupture unexpectedly violent in the case of so good-humoured a creature. He fled from the school, and it was discovered upon inquiry that he had fled from his home also.|$|E
60|$|The only {{drawback}} {{of putting}} her under restraint {{was a very}} slight one. We merely turned her empty boast <b>about</b> <b>knowing</b> the Secret into a fixed delusion. Having first spoken in sheer crazy spitefulness against {{the man who had}} offended her, she was cunning enough to see that she had seriously frightened him, and sharp enough afterwards to discover that HE was concerned in shutting her up. The consequence was she flamed out into a perfect frenzy of passion against him, going to the Asylum, and the first words she said to the nurses, after they had quieted her, were, that she was put in confinement for knowing his Secret, and that she meant to open her lips and ruin him, when the right time came.|$|E

5000|$|Awareness remains low as seen {{in annual}} surveys. The 2013 survey, also {{prepared}} by Harris Interactive, found that only 44% of adult Americans had heard of sepsis. Among over 2,500 U.S. adults, younger Americans were {{significantly less likely to}} have heard the term [...] "sepsis," [...] with 57% of U.S. adults ages 18-34 indicating that they had never heard of it, (compared to 47% of those age 35-44, 39% of those age 45-54 and 36 percent of older Americans aged 55+). In addition, women {{were much more likely to}} have of sepsis, with 49 percent of women saying they have, compared to 38 percent of men confirming they had heard the term. The most recent survey, done in 2015, revealed similar findings. The survey found that American adults were more familiar with rarer illnesses than sepsis.
