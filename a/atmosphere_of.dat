5|$|In 1894, American {{astronomer}} William W. Campbell {{found that}} the spectrum of Mars was identical to the spectrum of the Moon, throwing doubt on the burgeoning theory that the <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> Mars {{is similar to that}} of the Earth. Previous detections of water in the <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> Mars were explained by unfavorable conditions, and Campbell determined that the water signature came entirely from the Earth's atmosphere. Although he agreed that the ice caps did indicate there was water in the atmosphere, he did not believe the caps were sufficiently large to allow the water vapor to be detected. At the time, Campbell's results were considered controversial and were criticized by members of the astronomical community, but they were confirmed by American astronomer Walter S. Adams in 1925.|$|E

40|$|Rayleigh {{scattering}} is {{a result}} of an interaction of photons with bound electrons. Rayleigh scattering is mostly neglected in calculations of hot star model <b>atmospheres</b> because most <b>of</b> the hydrogen atoms are ionized and the heavier elements have a lower abundance than hydrogen. In <b>atmospheres</b> <b>of</b> some chemically peculiar stars, helium overabundant regions containing singly ionized helium are present and Rayleigh scattering can be a significant opacity source. We evaluate the contribution of Rayleigh scattering by neutral hydrogen and singly ionized helium in the <b>atmospheres</b> <b>of</b> hot stars with solar composition and in the <b>atmospheres</b> <b>of</b> helium overabundant stars. We computed several series <b>of</b> model <b>atmospheres</b> using the TLUSTY code and emergent fluxes using the SYNSPEC code. These models describe <b>atmospheres</b> <b>of</b> main sequence B-type stars with different helium abundance. We used an existing grid <b>of</b> models for <b>atmospheres</b> with solar chemical composition and we calculated an additional grid for helium-rich stars with $N$(He) /$N$(H) = 10. Rayleigh scattering by neutral hydrogen can be neglected in <b>atmospheres</b> <b>of</b> hot stars, while Rayleigh scattering by singly ionized helium can be a non-negligible opacity source in some hot stars, especially in helium-rich stars.

5|$|The upper <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> Venus can be {{measured}} from Earth when the planet crosses the sun in a rare event known as a solar transit. The last solar transit of Venus occurred in 2012. Using quantitative astronomical spectroscopy, scientists were able to analyse sunlight that passed through the planet's atmosphere to reveal chemicals within it. As the technique to analyse light to discover information about a planet's atmosphere only first showed results in 2001, {{this was the first}} opportunity to gain conclusive results in this way on the <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> Venus since observation of solar transits began. This solar transit was a rare opportunity considering the lack of information on the atmosphere between 65 and 85km. The solar transit in 2004 enabled astronomers to gather a large amount of data useful not only in determining the composition of the upper <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> Venus, but also in refining techniques used in searching for extrasolar planets. The <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> mostly CO2, absorbs near-infrared radiation, making it easy to observe.
