[...] No woman had previously served in this post.

500|$|From 1964 to 1965, Biko {{studied at}} St. Francis College, a Catholic {{boarding}} school in Mariannhill, Natal. The college had a liberal political culture, and Biko developed his political consciousness there. He became {{particularly interested in the}} replacement of South Africa's white minority colonial government with <b>an</b> <b>administration</b> <b>that</b> represented the country's black majority. Among the anti-colonialist leaders who became Biko's heroes at this time were Algeria's Ahmed Ben Bella and Kenya's Jaramogi Oginga Odinga. He later said that most of the [...] "politicos" [...] in his family were sympathetic to the PAC, which had anti-communist and African racialist ideas. Biko admired what he described as the PAC's [...] "terribly good organisation" [...] and the courage of many of its members, but he remained unconvinced by its racially exclusionary approach, believing that members of all racial groups should unite against the government. In December 1964, he travelled to Zwelitsha for the ulwaluko circumcision ceremony, symbolically marking his transition from boyhood to manhood.|$|E
500|$|On September 23, 2009, the {{paramilitary}} EBP joined the political {{branch of the}} Macheteros, the Partido Revolucionario de los Trabajadores Puertorriqueños, in an event named Vigilia por la Dignidad held at Hormigueros, Puerto Rico, in honor of Ojeda Ríos. There both groups agreed that they would promote an agenda of unity with other sectors of society to confront what they perceived as [...] "a fascist repression" [...] being imposed {{by the government and}} manipulated by [...] " [...] that control large amounts of capital". The EPB and PRTP stated that Fortuño represented the [...] "lords of capital" [...] and that his administration was surrendering control of the government and justice system to these interests. The organizations argued that finality was economic gain {{at the expense of the}} public and that they employed open class warfare against it, approving laws without feedback and enforcing other measures. The EBP and PRTP concluded this communiqué by suggesting that public manifestations, armed resistance and independentist unity would be required to counteract the administration. In a different topic, the EPB provided an extended critique of the Puerto Rican statehood movement. In denoting what they believe is the [...] "true face of anexionism", referring to right-wing Republicans such as Fortuño, Rivera Schatz and Jennifer González, the group quoted Ojeda Ríos opinion of the newly elected governor. The EPB argued that those wealthy interests pushed Fortuño by exploiting modern propaganda methods, such as the internet and media, and that the federal government [...] "employed its creativity" [...] to ensure his election by indicting the former governor after the political campaign had begun. The organization interpreted this as a showcase of the [...] "power of transnational corporation to manipulate the economic and political" [...] system, and argued that the austerity measures were part of a plan to satisfy the bond-holders, multinationals, developers and businessmen and [...] "to present statehood as the only solution" [...] to an [...] "intentionally exacerbated crisis". The EBP also criticized unions for their perceived [...] "dispersion", [...] "lack of ideological definition" [...] and [...] "unwilliness to radicalize their struggle", asking them to seek coordinated efforts that entice [...] "the evolution of revolutionary postures within the middle class and the public in general". The organization then urged other independentist groups to cease cooperating with other entities that [...] "seek sovereignty but not independence", in particular with the free association movement, and to pursue unity to face the [...] "militaristic" [...] and [...] "repressive" [...] actions of <b>an</b> <b>administration</b> <b>that</b> [...] "leans towards dictatorship".|$|E

He felt the peaceful stillness of the evening after the strain of the day, for Harding had left him in sole charge for some months now, and {{the handling of the}} men who worked for him had taxed all his nerve and skill. By good‐humored patience and uncompromising grimness, when that appeared the more advisable, he had convinced his swarthy subordinates that they would gain little by trifling with him, though he had wondered once or twice when an open dispute appeared imminent why it was that certain peons had so staunchly supported him against their discontented comrades. It was not, however, his difficulties with the workmen which caused him most concern, but the task of keeping on good terms with <b>an</b> <b>administration</b> <b>that</b> regarded aliens, and especially Americans, with a jealous eye, and appeasing the rapacity of officials whose exactions would, if unduly yielded to, have absorbed most of Harding’s profits.

Mr. Gladstone, however (June 13), regarded the situation and the chain of facts that had led up to it, as being so definite, when coupled with the readiness of Lord Salisbury to undertake <b>an</b> <b>administration,</b> <b>that</b> it would be a mere waste of valuable time for him to consult his colleagues as to the resumption of office. Then Lord Salisbury sought assurances of Mr. Gladstone’s support, as to finance, parliamentary time, and other points in the working of executive government. These assurances neither Mr. Gladstone’s own temperament, nor the humour of his friends and his party—for the embers of the quarrel with the Lords upon the franchise bill were still hot—allowed him to give, and he founded himself on the precedent of the communications of December 1845 between Peel and Russell. In this default of assurances, Lord Salisbury thought that he should render the Queen no useful service by taking office. So concluded the first stage.|$|E
