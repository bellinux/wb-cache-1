5|$|The First Fleet {{brought the}} initial {{population}} of 70 sheep from the Cape of Good Hope to Australia in 1788. The next shipment was of 30 sheep from Calcutta and Ireland in 1793. All {{of the early}} sheep brought to Australia were exclusively used for the dietary needs of the penal colonies. The beginnings of the <b>Australian</b> <b>wool</b> industry were due {{to the efforts of}} Captain John Macarthur. At Macarthur's urging 16 Spanish merinos were imported in 1797, effectively beginning the Australian sheep industry. By 1801 Macarthur had 1,000 head of sheep, and in 1803 he exported 111 kilograms (245lb) of wool to England. Today, Macarthur is generally thought of as the father of the Australian sheep industry.|$|E

In October 2004, PETA launched a boycott against the <b>Australian</b> <b>wool</b> industry, leading some clothing retailers to ban products using <b>Australian</b> <b>wool</b> from their stores. In response, the <b>Australian</b> <b>wool</b> industry sued PETA, arguing among other things that mulesing prevents flystrike, a very painful disease that can affect sheep. A settlement was reached, and PETA agreed to stop the boycott, while the wool industry agreed to seek alternatives to mulesing.|$|E

An analysis of price-induced substitution between <b>Australian</b> <b>wools</b> of different fibre diameters was conducted.

25|$|The Second Fleet in 1790 {{brought to}} Sydney {{two men who}} were to play {{important}} roles in the colony's future. One was D'Arcy Wentworth, whose son, William Charles, went on to be an explorer, to found Australia's first newspaper and to become {{a leader of the}} movement to abolish convict transportation and establish representative government. The other was John Macarthur, a Scottish army officer and founder of the <b>Australian</b> <b>wool</b> industry, which laid the foundations of Australia's future prosperity. Macarthur was a turbulent element: in 1808 {{he was one of the}} leaders of the Rum Rebellion against the governor, William Bligh.|$|E
25|$|There {{were nearly}} 2 million sheep in Australia by 1830, and by 1836, Australia {{had won the}} wool trade war with Germany, mainly because of Germany's preoccupation with fineness. German {{manufacturers}} commenced importing <b>Australian</b> <b>wool</b> in 1845. In 1841, at Mount Crawford in South Australia, Murray established a flock of Camden-blood ewes mated to Tasmanian rams. To broaden the wool and give the animals some size, it is thought some English Leicester blood was introduced. The resultant sheep were the foundation of many South Australian strong wool studs. His brother Alexander Borthwick Murray was also a highly successful breeder of Merino sheep.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, sereval {{varieties}} of animal fibres including cashmere and <b>Australian</b> fine Merino <b>wool</b> have been analysed by Fourier transform infrared microscope and differential scanning calorimeter. The {{results showed that}} both Chinese and Australian cashmere fibres started absorbing heat at a relatively higher temperature but were thermally degraded quicker than other animal fibres tested. However, the mass changes (within the temperature range of 200 oC to 350 oC) and associated onset temperatures varied among fibre varieties. From the attenuated total reflectance spectra, the Chinese cashmere was clearly different from <b>Australian</b> cashmere and <b>wool</b> in a peak near 1040 cm- 1 wavelength for S-O stretching of cysteic acid residues. The Chinese cashmere presented a stronger absorption at 1019 cm- 1 wavelength, while <b>Australian</b> cashmere and <b>wool</b> peaked at 1079 cm- 1 wavelength and had a weaker absorption.

2500|$|The <b>Australian</b> <b>Wool</b> Innovation (AWI) {{has pledged}} to phase out {{mulesing}} by 2010, but PETA has accused the <b>Australian</b> <b>wool</b> industry of trying to extend this deadline. On 27 July 2009, the <b>Australian</b> <b>wool</b> industry dumped its long-standing pledge to phase out mulesing {{by the end of}} 2010, a move that was harshly criticized by animal welfare groups and led to criticism by some farmers. The AWI maintains that pursuing a deadline approach to eliminating mulesing was not based on [...] "sound health and welfare science" [...] and risked a serious deterioration in the welfare of sheep. Alternative methods of mulesing, such as using clips and intradermals, were [...] "not sufficiently developed to support a wholesale cessation of the procedure in 2010", AWI said.|$|E

2500|$|In October 2004, American fashion {{retailer}} Abercrombie & Fitch Co. {{responded to}} pressure from PETA to boycott Australian merino wool {{due in part to}} the use of mulesing in Australia. The National Farmers' Federation responded by stating [...] "Abercrombie and Fitch does not use Australian wool".

In June 2009, British department store chain John Lewis joined the wool boycott. The international fashion retailer New Look also refuses to stock products made from Australian Merino wool.
