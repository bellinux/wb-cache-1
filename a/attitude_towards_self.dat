40|$|The study {{investigated}} the relationships between psychiatric nurse aptitudes and outcomes of depressive patients in residential psychiatric care. Upon admission, it is common practise for one nurse to be assigned to a patient for the entire hospital stay. Nurses differ individually. Depending on their professional rank (novice, proficient, master), nurses rely on other components of aptitude {{to care for their}} patients. Depending on a nurse's professional rank, other relationships exists between specific nurse aptitudes and certain changes in a patient's depressive feelings. Novice nurses should be assigned to patients that suffer more from performance impairment than negative <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> <b>self,</b> whereas master nurses should be assigned to patients that suffer more from negative <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> <b>self</b> than performance impairment. As a patient recovers, depressive feelings can change (e. g. switching from performance impairment to negative <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> <b>self).</b> Our results suggest that nursing assignments should change in line with the dominant type of dysfunction displayed by the patient. This recommendation differs with current practises of assigning the same nurse to a patient for the entire hospital stay. Abstract In psychiatric units, head nurses face the daily challenge of assigning nurses to patients. The match between a patient and a nurse is not always optimal. This can hinder the therapeutic relationship. Aptitude is an important component of competence, especially for psychiatric nurses involved in therapeutic relationships. In this study, we undertook explorative research to investigate possible relationships between nurse aptitudes and outcomes in depressed patients. We found statistically significant relationships between specific nurse aptitudes, along professional rank, and particular patient outcomes. During the hospital stay, patients' depressive feelings change as they recover. Our results indicate that, as a patient's depressive feelings change, another type of nurse, one with an aptitude that supports the patient's current needs, should be assigned to care for that patient. This suggestion is at odds with current practises of assigning a patient to one nurse for the entire hospital stay...|$|R
40|$|The {{concepts}} of ”I” and ”me”, called by Mead ”the two phases of personality” {{have been subjected}} to different interpretations. My definition starts with the temporal dimension. The ”I” and the ”me” are seen as two corresponding functions arising in the human subject when taking the Other’s <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> <b>Self.</b> Thus both are social in origin. A frame of reference emerges where the ”I” is the subjective, active and present aspect, and the ”me” is the objective, passive aspect in past tense. Consciousness (especially of the Self) consists in the two functions being erected as one system, where the ”I” has the active capacity, always being partly guided by the ”me”. Dialectic functions of this Self concept are discussed, focusing social human construction of time as a consciously experienced phenomenon. Other aspects are (1) the conversational, stressed by Mead, (2) that the pair is conceptually interdependent and (3) that identity always contains non-identity and transcendence as well...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Adolescence is a {{transition}} period that involves physiological, psychological, and social changes. Emotional {{problems such as}} symptoms of anxiety and depression may develop due to these changes. Although many of these problems may not meet diagnostic thresholds, they may develop into more severe disorders and may impact on functioning. However, there are barriers that may {{make it difficult for}} adolescents to receive help from health professionals for such problems, one of which is the limited availability of formal psychological therapy. One way of increasing access to help for such problems is through self help technology (i. e. delivery of psychological help through information technology or paper based formats). Although there is a significant evidence base concerning self help in adults, the evidence base is much weaker in adolescents. This study aims to examine the effectiveness of self help technology for the treatment of emotional problems in adolescents by conducting a systematic review of randomized and quasi-experimental evidence. Methods Five major electronic databases were searched: Medline, PsycInfo, Embase, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and CINAHL. In addition, nine journals were handsearched and the reference lists of all studies were examined for any additional studies. Fourteen studies were identified. Effect sizes were calculated across 3 outcome measures: <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> <b>self</b> (e. g. self esteem); social cognition (e. g. self efficacy); and emotional symptoms (i. e. depression and anxiety symptoms). Results Meta analysis showed small, non-significant effect size for <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> <b>self</b> (ES = - 0. 14, 95 % CI = - 0. 72 to 0. 43), a medium, non-significant effect size for social cognition (ES = - 0. 49, 95 % CI = - 1. 23 to 0. 25) and a medium, non-significant effect size for emotional symptoms (ES = - 0. 47, 95 % CI = - 1. 00 to 0. 07). However, these findings must be considered preliminary, because of the small number of studies, their heterogeneity, and the relatively poor quality of the studies. Conclusion At present, the adoption of self help technology for adolescents with emotional problems in routine clinical practice cannot be recommended. There is a need to conduct high quality randomised trials in clearly defined populations to further develop the evidence base before implementation. </p...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn France, {{the justice}} system for minors, since the {{government}} edict of 2 nd February 1945, has been distinguished officially from others by the importance attached to applying an " educative " rather than " repressive " approach. This explicit stance {{on the part of}} the political and judicial authorities is reflected in the development of institutions whose policy is one of " educational " supervision. But what does this educational work consist of? In a context marked by the increasing bureaucratization of socio-judicial work, how do officials assess the impact and effectiveness of the policy? Using the results of an ethnography conducted in an open custody unit of the Youth Judicial Protection Service (Protection Judi-ciaire de la Jeunesse) and a children's court in the Paris region, this study shows that professionals attach particular importance to bringing about a change in <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> <b>self</b> and others. The understanding is that " successful support " of delinquent minors will encourage them to express a sense of responsibility and guilt for their behaviour, two feelings invested with redemptive, healing abilities. Expression of such sentiments, which are at the heart of the moral economy of juvenile delinquency, is understood to attest to a subjective transformation, which becomes the ultimate justification for the work done with these delinquents as well as a condition for their pardon. The importance attached to eliciting expressions of a sense of responsibility and guilt thus contributes to disciplining sentiments, where the aim is no longer to correct behaviour but persons...|$|E

40|$|Possible {{differences}} in attitude towards mathematics were studied between Year seven successful regular class children and Year seven {{children with learning}} problems in mathematics. A comparison was also made between the Year seven children with learning problems and a younger chronological age group (Year 5) who were performing at approximately the same level in mathematics. A sample of 180 students (30 Year 5 males, 30 Year 5 females, 30 Year 7 regular class males, 30 Year 7 regular class females, 30 Year 7 learning problems males and 30 Year 7 learning problems females) was selected from students in seven local Primary Schools. Student mathematical achievement {{was determined by the}} Progressive Achievement Tests in Mathematics (Level 2 a). Mean differences across the six groups of students were calculated on three attitude subscales. These scales measured school-related affect (attitude to school); subject-related affect (attitude to mathematics) and academic self-concept (<b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> <b>self</b> about mathematical ability). Stepdown F tests were used to determine the relative importance of each affect variable. The research study sought to determine if academic self-concept was the primary affect variable differentiating the groups. It was hypothesised that {{differences in}} subject-related affect and school-related affect would not be significant after academic self-concept was partialled from the relationship. Findings indicate that significant differences exist between groups in terms of academic self-concept, subject-related affect and school-related affect when these variables were assessed univariately: The significant finding was that when attempting to examine differences between groups in mathematics, all three affect variables should be considered. This is due to the the school-related affect variable being found to add significantly to the differences between groups even when student academic self-concept was partialled from the analysis. No significant difference was found between students in terms of gender on any affect measure...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} Russian {{religious}} philosopher Nikolai Berdiaev (1874 - 1948). The aim of the thesis is to re-examine the alleged gnostic subtext in Berdiaev’s thought by exploring a number of interrelated motifs in his world outlook, teaching on man and theory of knowledge. The method employed is a close reading of Berdiaev's philosophical and autobiographical writings. In order to establish which motifs should be examined, how they are to be understood {{and the manner in which}} they are interconnected, a scrutiny is made of Hans Jonas’s phenomenological elucidation of ancient Gnosticism. A synthetic conception labelled Jonasian Gnosticism is proposed as the interpretive framework, in order to provide a unitary and consistent heuristic tool with which to investigate the topic, and to distinguish the specific proposed representation of Gnosticism from other existing ones. A chapter is devoted to an analysis of the concept of gnosis as employed by Berdiaev. Another key notion taken from the Jonasian framework is that of demundanization, which denotes among other things a rejectionary attitude towards the world grounded in a negative experience of evil and suffering. Varieties of dualism as well as Berdiaev’s doctrine of the human spirit’s otherworldly origin and non-belonging in the world, constitute other issues that are examined. In addition, both Berdiaev’s assessment of historical Gnosticism and his view of a gnostic return in modern times are examined. The study demonstrates the complexity of Berdiaev’s attitude towards the classic Gnostics, and his attempt to denounce Gnosticism while at the same time making a case for a Christian gnosis. The results suggest both affinities and divergences in the relationship between Berdiaev’s thought and Jonasian Gnosticism. Even though the doctrinal standpoints diverge on crucial points, it is argued that a suggestive affinity nevertheless exists in the shared existential <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> <b>self</b> and world...|$|E

40|$|This explorative and {{descriptive}} study elicited {{the views of}} White British working class secondary school boys on achievement in school, in one Local Authority where the underachievement of these boys was a significant cause for concern. The research questions addressed focussed on identifying the participants' attitudes towards school, self and learning and the factors that appeared to cause the participants to underachieve within the local context. Their views on the barriers and facilitators to their learning were also elicited. This study utilised a mixed methods design involving both quantitative and qualitative methodologies. The views of fifteen boys were elicited using the Pupil Attitude to Self and School (PASS) computer based standardised questionnaire followed by semi-structured interviews. Percentile Factor Scores from the completed questionnaires and Thematic Analysis were used to analyse the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the data respectively. The findings suggested that the participants had a positive <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> <b>self</b> and learning. This included their capabilities and motivation as learners to potentially achieve their goals and aspirations, when provided with the appropriate support and optimal learning contexts conducive to their learning styles and needs. In addition, the participants presented themselves as having an ambivalent attitude towards school {{and were able to}} identify numerous facilitators and barriers to their learning. There was also a clear consensus amongst the participants about what worked for them in terms of the factors that supported their learning and academic achievement.

40|$|Our {{methods for}} educating Deaf {{adolescent}} Latino struggling readers {{need to change}} {{in order to maximize}} their learning. As with all students, this begins with identifying student strengths and building on these strengths to help students gain new and productive skills. We need to find out what motivates these Latino Deaf readers and what will engage them in reading. Understanding Deaf students' socio-cultural backgrounds and environments, interests, needs, and values through ethnographic research would enable such tailoring and could guide teachers and specialists in redesigning instruction for these students. The main research question guiding this study is: What can we learn about motivation to read from Deaf Latino adolescents who are struggling readers? There are four sub-questions guiding this study : 1) what are the students' backgrounds and language experiences and how do these affect their <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> <b>self,</b> community, and the target language?; 2) what are the students' self-concepts about their reading ability?; 3) what are their values with regard to reading?; and 4) what are the students' experiences, attitudes, and motivations about readers and reading? To answer these questions, I interviewed four participants who met five criteria. They are currently in grades 9 to 12, use ASL and are classified as Deaf in their Individual Education Plan (IEP), attended elementary school for two or more years in the US educational system, scored basic or below basic on the English proficiency exam of the California Standard Test, and their IQ scores are normal. This study informs us that unlike Deaf Anglo students, Deaf Latino students bring with them a pride of heritage, a positive attitude toward multiple languages, and an adaptable spirit that allows them to shift their language use according to their needs and context. Also, they are like Deaf Anglo students in their frustrations and in their narrow definition of reading as a school activity. Teachers can learn a great deal about students' perspectives on reading by simply asking them about reading. Their responses will add valuable knowledge to the research base as well as to teachers' practical knowledge...|$|E

Objective The aim of the study was to assess DM patients’ perception of knowledge for their medication and <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> <b>self</b> management and pharmacist’s role. Setting The study was conducted at the diabetes out-patient clinic at the Vienna General Hospital (AKH), Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Department of Internal Medicine III, Austria. The study was a cross sectional survey using patient data from a validated patient questionnaire and medical records. Medical records were evaluated by applying a medication assessment tool. Main outcome measure To assess the quality of diabetes self management the following outcome measures are considered: HbA 1 c levels, pre- and post-prandial blood glucose levels, prevention of acute episodes of hypo- and hyperglycaemia, reduction of macrovascular risk factors, short term quality of life, adverse effects and treatment tolerance. Results The present study comprised 225 patients with DM 1 and 201 patients with DM 2, respectively. In comparison to DM 2 patients, cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases were diagnosed very rarely in patients with DM 1. The risk for these diseases was higher in patients with other factors of the metabolic syndrome, in addition. Overall, 118 of these patients participated in the questionnaire. The level of positive response on diabetes self-care and knowledge with respect to medication for the prevention of diabetes complications, glycaemic control, and treatment goals in diabetes was 81. 8 %. The comparison of patients’ perceptions of diabetes self-care and knowledge showed differences among subgroups. Higher perceived knowledge and selfcare apparently was associated with DM 1. Additional ﬁndings of this study indicate that patients do not expect community pharmacists to be integrated in a multidisciplinary diabetes care team. Although the level of positive response was found to be high there is still a minority of patients whose level of comprehension appears to be insufﬁcient. Intense pharmaceutical care including patients’ education within a multidisciplinary team could contribute to improvements in those patients...|$|E

40|$|A {{distinction}} {{has often}} been drawn between "process" and "outcome" studies in psychotherapy research, but interest in outcome implicitly underlies virtually all research in psychotherapy, there being little point in studying what happens in treatment if these events do not, in some way, relate to outcome. In addition, since an integrative measurement of change appears to be promising in psychotherapy research (e. g. Bloch and Reibstein (1980), Cartwright et al (1963), Mintz et al (1979), Strupp and Hadley (1977), Truax and Carkhuff (1967), among others), the emphasis {{of the present study}} was on the perceptions of change by the main participants in therapy, namely the patients and therapists. Therefore, the present study was initiated in an attempt to integrate process and outcome measures of patients' and therapists' experiences of group psychotherapy into a longitudinal study, following the participants from the start of the therapeutic contact through to termination, and six months after termination. Bearing these considerations in mind, the aims of this research were to investigate: a) patients' and therapists' expectations and perceptions of themselves and each other before they commence therapy, and b) patients' and therapists' perceptions of themselves and each other throughout treatment, in relation to outcome. The research design employed was a repeated measures design using interviews, psychological tests (Rotter's Internal-External Control Scale, the Treatment Expectancies Questionnaire, and several semantic differentials), and observation of the participants in the group psychotherapy situation. The main findings of the current research can be summarized as follows: 1. patients' expectations of the role the therapist played in t. heir treatment and what they thought their impending therapy would consist of, influenced their perception of the initial stages of therapy and their participation in treatment. 2. therapists felt there was a lack of congruence between what they thought it was realistic to achieve with their group patients and what they would really like to achieve; their expectations of the patients' participation and gain from group therapy being modified considerably as a result of ongoing treatment. 3. prior to therapy, patients and therapists had differing expectations of what the process of therapy would involve; however, during therapy, patients who came to share similar perceptions of the group process as their therapists, successfully completed treatment. 4. patients became more Internal in the responses to Rotter's Internal-External Control Scale as a result of treatment (p<. OO 5), although there were no significant differences between terminators and non-terminators or between males and females. 5. responses to the Treatment Expectancies Questionnaire indicated that patients showed a preference for a more behaviourally oriented treatment regime at the end of group therapy, compared to pre-therapy (p<. 01). 6. the semantic differential data indicated that patients who successfully completed treatment viewed themselves more positively in terms of their <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> <b>self</b> and what they felt capable of achieving, attributing this, at termination to the "potency" of the group. 7. it is tentatively suggested that it may be possible to identify the potential terminator prior to commencing therapy, based on his expectations of therapy in general and his treatment in particular. It is suggested, given the numerous limitations of the current study, further research be initiated to validate the present results...|$|E
40|$|Depression and {{depressive}} symptoms are consistently reported {{as a problem}} for patients with daytime sleepiness in various studies. The present dissertation attempts to compare depression severity and daytime sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy and Idiopathic Hypersomnia. The main objective of this dissertation is {{to determine whether the}} {{depressive symptoms}} of narcoleptic patients are different from the depressive symptoms of depressed non-narcoleptics. Given the large discrepancy in previous results on this topic, this hypothesis was to be tested in steps, therefore this dissertation is divided into three studies. The first study assesses depressive symptoms in 86 narcoleptic patients with (NC+) and without (NC-) cataplexy (46 women, 40 men), idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) patients (three women, 12 men) and age- and sex- matched healthy controls. Seventy patients were under treatment with stimulants and/or anticataplectics. The second study compares depressive symptoms between 36 narcoleptics (26 women, 10 men) and 34 outpatients with mild to moderate depression (22 women, 12 men). The group of narcoleptics was selected from the sample of patients of the first study (n = 86) who had ≥ 10 points in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). All subjects completed the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), the Global Impression of Severity of Depression (GSD), the Profile of Mood States (POMS) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). The third study identifies the components of depressive symptoms of narcoleptic patients using BDI. The total number of patients had to be increased to meet the basic requirements of a factor analysis. The sample was made up of 114 Caucasian narcoleptic patients (62 women, 52 men). The results show that patients with narcolepsy were more depressed than controls (higher scores in BDI, GSD, SDS, and POMS [in the total score and in all sub scale scores]); however, between the NC+ and NC- patient groups, no differences were found. Women and the patients using antidepressants and stimulants (combination) have a higher probability for depressive symptoms independent of the presence of cataplexy. The daytime sleepiness measured by the ESS (mean score) for the narcoleptic group was higher than the mean scores for the depressive group (p<. 001). In the item analysis, differences between the narcoleptic group and depressive disorder group in BDI were found regarding anhedonia. Narcoleptic patients were more likely to continue to feel pleasure compared to patients with depression. Further differences were found in the items loss of appetite and health worries. In SDS, narcoleptics were less impaired in diurnal variation, loss of libido, appetite and weight than patients with depression. Narcoleptics and depressives were more impaired in POMS (total and all sub scales) compared to controls. The factor analysis of BDI revealed that the negative <b>attitude</b> <b>towards</b> <b>self</b> was the component that explained most of the symptoms of depression. Even though this is a component also found in patients with depression without narcolepsy, it is interesting because in patients with narcolepsy it is more manifest than in depressives without this sleep disorder. Taken together, the findings support the assumption that the major psychosocial burden in narcolepsy is associated with sleepiness and not with cataplexy. Female sex and the intake of antidepressants and stimulants together are two determinants connected with depressive symptoms in patients with narcolepsy. The prevention of depressive symptoms should have special focus in women with narcolepsy independent of the presence of cataplexy. Furthermore, with regards to prevention, the focal point should be the negative attitude toward self as the most relevant component. Future studies should concentrate on the impact of medication on depression in patients with narcolepsy. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to examine the influence of mentoring; the <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> science, and the occupational plans of adolescent females in Levels I, II and HI in an urban high school in Newfoundland and Labrador. [...] Individual questionnaires were administered to 121 students attending one urban high school. The data from 75 returned questionnaires were analyzed using the statistical program, SPSS. Descriptive statistics, including percentages and frequencies, along with chi-squared analysis were used to analyze the data. [...] The findings indicated that 75 % of the young women in the study could identify one or more mentors in their lives. There {{were no significant differences between}} those who identified mentors and those who did not on variables of <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> <b>self</b> in the present or future, self-esteem, occupational plans, <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> science, or beliefs regarding women in science occupations. Some of the findings on young women's self-esteem and <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> science and science-related occupations were not consistent with findings reported in earlier studies. [...] Most of the young women in the study believed that significant adults in their lives had influenced their career-related decisions and supported the notion that schools should encourage mentoring. The majority reported having good self-esteem and felt confident when voicing their opinions. Most of the women surveyed were confident in their abilities in the sciences and believed they would be successful in school. [...] It is recommended that parents become informed of the impact they and other significant adults have on the career decisions of their daughters. It is also recommended that schools attempt to promote mentoring for young women and to guide young women in their career planning, ensuring that occupations in science are presented as viable and possible options...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Low {{literacy}} {{is common in}} Hong Kong and China, especially among the females and the elderly. These are often the patients with the greatest health care needs. However {{little is known about}} how low literacy affects the ability of patients to obtain adequate medical care and comply with the recommendations of health professionals. Methods Qualitative study of subjects' opinions using semi-structured group and individual interviews. Thirty-six participants took part in 6 group and 9 individual interviews. Results Participants' opinions towards low literacy were explored in the interviews. They expressed diverse views on how they perceived low literacy. Some thought they were handicapped by it but others felt it was not a problem. Age, gender, chronic illnesses and their <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> <b>self</b> were found to be major factors affecting their perception. Despite their low literacy, some had their specific ways to overcome the difficulties, for example, drawing symbols to help with the timing of taking the medications. Most of them felt better explanation by the health care workers was most important. Conclusions It is highly relevant for health care workers {{to be aware of the}} low literacy status of their patients and to explain information so that patients understand it. </p...|$|R

The results of a large-scale survey based on face-to-face interviews are presneted in the volume. For the first time, political scientists, sociologists, and social psychologist have worked together to understand the psychological bases of the left-right ideological continuum. Are left-wing voters really different from right-wing voters? Is such difference rooted in a pre-political psychological dimension? what are the relations with emotions, identifications, prejudice, <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> leaders, <b>self</b> efficacy?

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to measure the attitudes, {{socio-economic}} status, and achievement of Inuit students and to determine the relationship among these three variables. [...] To obtain the necessary information utilized in the analysis of the questions posed in the study, a questionnaire was administered to sixty-seven Inuit students enrolled in the seventh, eighth, and ninth grades in two all-grade schools in the isolated, coastal region of Northern Labrador. The first section of the questionnaire elicited background information concerning the socio-economic indicators, parental education, parental occupation, family size, and family possessions. The final section of the questionnaire utilized an attitudinal scale, the semantic differential, to measure the students' <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> <b>self</b> (ME) and education (SCHOOL, BOOKS, ENGLISH, TEACHER, DISCIPLINE, EXAMINATION, READING, HOMEWORK, STUDYING, and LEARNING). <b>Attitude</b> <b>towards</b> education was also measured by a question directed at the students' expectation of the grade level to be achieved. A basic data sheet recorded from the students' report cards an indication of actual school achievement, the students' total grade average and subjects failed for first two school terms. [...] The main findings of the study indicate that, while socio-economic status and achievement of Inuit students are low, their attitudes are not negative. The findings also indicate that, of the variables investigated, only the indicators of socio-economic status are significantly related to the indicators of school achievement. Father's education, father's occupation, and mother's occupation are significantly related to the students' total grade average, and father's occupation is significantly related to subjects failed. [...] The study concludes that socio-economic status, not negative attitudes, is the major obstacle to educational achievement among the Inuit students in Labrador. It also concludes that the Inuit student appears to have made only tentative and weak commitments to the values of the educational system and the "White culture" it represents...|$|R

40|$|Growing {{attention}} {{is being paid}} to co-occurring mental health and substance use disorders or concurrent disorders (CDs) in relation to treatment services and supports. A related theme is the mental health self-advocate vision of recovery that includes respecting peoples' subjective self-determination (SD) in treatment. Client SD is an important social work concept but its meaning and purpose remains unclear and it is typically defined from the professional perspective. Understanding SD meanings of people with CDs in relation to recovery may help social workers better assist people with CDs to achieve their recovery goals. This study explored the meanings of SD in CDs treatment and recovery experiences among five female and three male participants. Interview transcripts were analyzed using a qualitative grounded theory approach. [...] SD meanings hinged on the subjective “sense of self” of participants within their ecosystem. Three interrelated SD meaning components were identified: key standpoint elements (beliefs and values, <b>attitudes</b> <b>towards</b> <b>self</b> and ecosystem, sense of control, and aspirations), a power or force (associated with being determined) and determining processes (knowledge building and decision making). A primary {{sense of self and}} a later more “nuanced” sense of self in CDs recovery were distinguishable within participants' descriptions and meanings. The more nuanced sense of self reflected more situationally relative, compatible, and discerning meanings of the self, SD, the ecosystem, mental health, addiction, and CDs recovery. Hermeneutic knowledge building is interpreted as facilitating the trend towards a more nuanced sense of self over time. One practice implication involves the role and importance of SD in relation to regulating the relative stability of the sense of self simultaneously with growth and change associated with CDs recovery...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Disturbed {{sleep is}} {{associated}} with mood disorders. Both depression and insomnia may {{increase the risk of}} disability retirement. The longitudinal links among insomnia, depression and work incapacity are poorly known. METHODS: We examined association of self-reported sleep quality with incident symptoms of depression and disability retirement due to depressive disorders in a longitudinal population-based sample of twins (n= 12, 063 individuals). These adults were categorized by their sleep quality in 1975 and 1981, excluding individuals with depressed mood in 1975 / 1981. The outcomes were the Beck Depression Inventory (BDItot) and its subscale Negative <b>Attitudes</b> <b>Towards</b> <b>Self</b> (BDINATS) in 1990 as dichotomized measures, and the incidence of disability retirement due to depressive disorder during 1991 - 2004. RESULTS: Onset of poor sleep between 1975 and 1981 predicted incident depression (BDItot OR= 4. 5, 95 % CI: 2. 7 - 7. 4, BDINATS OR= 2. 0, 95 % CI: 1. 4 - 2. 7), while persistent poor sleep showed somewhat weaker effects (BDItot; OR= 2. 5, 95 % CI: 1. 0 - 6. 0, BDINATS OR= 1. 9, 95 % CI: 1. 1 - 3. 3). Among those with few recent stressful life events, onset of poor sleep predicted strongly depression (BDINATS OR= 9. 5, 95 % CI: 3. 7 - 24. 2). Likewise onset of poor sleep by 1981 increased the risk of disability retirement due to depression (OR= 2. 9, 95 % CI: 1. 8 - 4. 9) with a similar risk among those with persistent poor sleep (OR= 2. 7, 95 % CI: 1. 3 - 5. 7). LIMITATIONS: Lack of baseline diagnostic interviews; sleep quality based on self-report. CONCLUSIONS: Poor sleep is of importance in etiology of depression and disability retirement due to depression.
