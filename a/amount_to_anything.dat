However, the boy's initial enthusiastic nature is crushed by an uncaring and bitter teacher {{who said that he}} would be a failure at life and never <b>amount</b> <b>to</b> <b>anything.</b> Deeply hurt by this comment, Bart then began the process of developing his path into the mischievous way of life.|$|E
5|$|Discharged {{from the}} army, Willkie {{returned}} to Elwood. He considered {{a run for}} Congress as a Democrat, but was advised that the district was so Republican he {{would be unlikely to}} keep the seat even if he could win it, and his chances might be better in a more urban area. Herman Willkie wanted Wendell and Robert to rejoin the family law firm, but Henrietta was opposed, feeling that opportunities in Elwood were too limited for her sons. She got her way, and in May 1919 Wendell Willkie successfully applied for a job with the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company in Akron, Ohio as head of the legal office that advised workers on wills and other personal matters. He was soon bored there, and on the advice of his wife, left for a law firm despite an offer from Harvey Firestone to double his salary. Firestone told the departing lawyer that he would never <b>amount</b> <b>to</b> <b>anything</b> because he was a Democrat.|$|E
25|$|Solon's {{laws were}} inscribed on large wooden slabs or {{cylinders}} {{attached to a}} series of axles that stood upright in the Prytaneion. These axones appear to have operated on the same principle as a Lazy Susan, allowing both convenient storage and ease of access. Originally the axones recorded laws enacted by Draco in the late 7th Century (traditionally 621 BC). Nothing of Draco's codification has survived except for a law relating to homicide, yet there is consensus among scholars that it did not <b>amount</b> <b>to</b> <b>anything</b> like a constitution. Solon repealed all Draco's laws except those relating to homicide. During his visit to Athens, Pausanias, the 2nd century AD geographer reported that the inscribed laws of Solon were still displayed by the Prytaneion. Fragments of the axones were still visible in Plutarch's time but today the only records we have of Solon's laws are fragmentary quotes and comments in literary sources such as those written by Plutarch himself. Moreover, the language of his laws was archaic even {{by the standards of the}} fifth century and this caused interpretation problems for ancient commentators. Modern scholars doubt the reliability of these sources and our knowledge of Solon's legislation is therefore actually very limited in its details.|$|E

500|$|New films shown {{publicly}} anywhere for {{the first}} time after January 1 themselves are ineligible for Oscars until the following year, by which time they will likely have been forgotten by critics, audiences and voters. The Silence of the Lambs, winner of the 1991 Academy Award for Best Picture, is a rare exception, as the only film in the post-studio era released in the first two months of its year to go on to win that Oscar. Burr calls it [...] "the grand exception to the January Movies Will Never <b>Amount</b> <b>to</b> <b>Anything</b> rule," [...] and finds that only one other classic of the late 20th century, Dr. Strangelove, was a January release.|$|E

Saeed al-Shehabi of the London-based Bahrain Freedom Movement said the Tamarod movement would [...] "renew Bahrain's forgotten revolution". [...] Mansoor al-Jamri, editor of Al-Wasat independent newspaper expressed pessimism about the situation, saying that [...] "it's a very volatile situation. We might be heading for a very harsh period." [...] Marc Jones was also pessimistic. [...] "It is unlikely that these 'Tamorrod' protests will <b>amount</b> <b>to</b> <b>anything,</b> especially as the Bahraini authorities have spent the past two years breaking the back of the opposition movement.

Ashley Lindsey of Stratfor global intelligence firm said the likelihood of protests reaching Manama was low due to the experience of security forces.|$|E
500|$|In the Battle of Long Island on August 27, 1776, British forces {{successfully}} occupied western Long Island (modern Brooklyn), compelling Washington {{to withdraw}} his army to Manhattan. [...] General Howe then paused to consolidate his gains, and the brothers {{decided to make}} a diplomatic overture. [...] During the battle they had captured several high-ranking Continental Army officers, including Major General John Sullivan. [...] The Howes managed to convince Sullivan that a conference with members of the Continental Congress might yield fruit, and released him on parole to deliver a message to the Congress in Philadelphia, proposing an informal meeting to discuss ending the armed conflict between Britain and its rebellious colonies. [...] After Sullivan's speech to Congress, John Adams cynically commented on this diplomatic attempt, calling Sullivan a [...] "decoy-duck" [...] and accusing the British of sending Sullivan [...] "to seduce us into a renunciation of our independence"; others noted that it appeared to be an attempt to blame Congress for prolonging the war. [...] The Congress did however agree to send three of its members – Adams, Benjamin Franklin and Edward Rutledge – to a conference with Lord Howe. [...] They were instructed [...] "to ask a few Questions and take [...] Answers", but had no further authority. [...] When Howe learned of the committee's limited authority, he briefly considered calling the meeting off, but decided to proceed after discussion with his brother. [...] None of the commissioners believed the conference would <b>amount</b> <b>to</b> <b>anything.</b>|$|E

During this period, a rebuild could <b>amount</b> <b>to</b> <b>anything</b> from stripping off planking to facilitate replacement of rotten timbers and adjustments to suit the required dimensions, or complete dismantlement and construction of what was, for all intents and purposes, a completely new ship making but the scantiest use of timber from the old ship.|$|E

When he returned to audition for the American Foundation for the Blind later in the year he was told that the company of actors was [...] "filled" [...] but that he might record a novel if he wished. [...] "That was the beginning of it," [...] he recalled years later, adding, [...] "The recordings for the blind are perhaps my greatest achievement.

2500|$|Malick's {{forthcoming}} arrival {{was announced}} by the BBC on 26 November 2010.

However, there is no doubt he excels at his job and what would overwhelm other medics is like nectar to Malick." [...] Akingbola deemed his character [...] "an alpha male who doesn't suffer fools gladly", someone who would cause ructions amongst staff and patients alike. Despite his abrasive personality, Malick is a talented doctor. Akingbola likened him to footballer Eric Cantona, in that he is [...] "highly skilled, but his temper, his attitude and his confidence get in the way." [...] As a result of his refusal to engage in hospital politics, he is introduced as a registrar who has not achieved his [...] "main ambition" [...] of being promoted to consultant level, although he is close to it, and feels he should be one already. Confident in his ability, Malick exudes arrogance. The actor suggested that Malick's drive stemmed from having been told he would never <b>amount</b> <b>to</b> <b>anything,</b> and a desire to prove his detractors wrong.|$|E
