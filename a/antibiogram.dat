30|$|<b>Antibiograms</b> {{created by}} {{aggregating}} hospital-wide susceptibility data from diverse patients can be misleading. To demonstrate {{the utility of}} age- and location-stratified <b>antibiograms,</b> we compared stratified <b>antibiograms</b> for three common bacterial pathogens, E. coli, S. aureus, and S. pneumoniae. We created stratified <b>antibiograms</b> based on patient age (< 18 years, 18 – 64 years, >/= 65 years), and inpatient or outpatient location using all 2009 E. coli and S. aureus, and all 2008 – 2009 S. pneumoniae isolates submitted to our clinical microbiology laboratory.

30|$|In conclusion, {{stratified}} <b>antibiograms</b> reveal age - associated {{differences in}} susceptibility of E. coli, S. aureus, and S. pneumoniae that are obscured by hospital-wide <b>antibiograms.</b> Further stratification of E. coli isolates by both age and IP or OP location {{may also be}} useful to clinicians who manage pediatric urinary tract infections. Although the proportion of institutions that create stratified vs. cumulative <b>antibiograms</b> is not clear, we believe that more facilities should create age - stratified <b>antibiograms</b> especially if they serve diverse patient groups (i.e. are not free-standing children’s hospitals or long-term care facilities).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Empirical {{antibacterial}} {{therapy in}} hospitals is usually guided by local epidemiologic features reflected by institutional cumulative <b>antibiograms.</b> We investigated additional information inferred by aggregating cumulative <b>antibiograms</b> {{by type of}} unit or according {{to the place of}} acquisition (i. e. community vs. hospital) of the bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility rates of selected pathogens were collected over a 4 -year period in an university-affiliated hospital. Hospital-wide <b>antibiograms</b> were compared with those selected by type of unit and sampling time ( 48 h after hospital admission). RESULTS: Strains isolated > 48 h after admission were less susceptible than those presumably arising from the community ( 48 h after admission. When compared to hospital-wide <b>antibiograms,</b> susceptibility rates were lower in the ICU and surgical units for Escherichia coli to amoxicillin-clavulanate, enterococci to penicillin, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to anti-pseudomonal beta-lactams, and in medical units for Staphylococcus aureus to oxacillin. In contrast, few differences were observed among strains isolated within 48 h of admission.

50|$|A {{recent review}} article {{suggested}} the following {{line of treatment}} for suspected breast abscess: initially, antibiotics treatment, ultrasound evaluation and, if fluid is present, ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration of the abscess with an 18 gauge needle, under saline lavage until clear. The exudate is then sent for microbiological analysis for identification of the pathogen and determination of its antibiotic sensitivity profile (<b>antibiogram),</b> which may in turn give an indication for changing the antibiotics prescription. At follow-up, a mammography is performed if the condition has resolved; otherwise the ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration with lavage and microbiological analysis is repeated. If three to five aspirations still do not resolve the condition, percutaneous drainage in combination with placement of an indwelling catheter is indicated, and only if several attempts at ultrasound-guided drainage fail, surgical resection of the inflamed lactiferous ducts (preferably performed after the acute episode is over) should be considered. It is noted, however, that even the excision of the affected ducts does not necessarily prevent recurrence.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTTwo {{phenotypic}} methods, quantitative <b>antibiogram</b> {{analysis and}} colony morphology, {{were compared to}} pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) for distinguishing the clonality of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CNS) species. The results of these three methods were correlated with the patients' clinical findings for 23 episodes in which CNS species were isolated from two blood culture bottles within a 24 -h period. Quantitative <b>antibiogram</b> and colony morphology at 24 h correlated with PFGE typing in 21 (91 %) and 20 (87 %) episodes, respectively. All episodes associated with CNS strains with identical PFGE patterns had quantitative <b>antibiogram</b> similarity coefficients < 10, whereas most episodes associated with strains with different PFGE patterns had quantitative <b>antibiogram</b> similarity coefficients ≥ 17. The CNS isolate pairs {{were less likely to}} be associated with infection if the strains had different PFGE types or a quantitative <b>antibiogram</b> similarity coefficient ≥ 17.

30|$|For elderly patients, {{availability}} of age-specific <b>antibiograms</b> {{that do not}} underestimate drug resistance {{is also likely to}} enhance appropriate antibiotic selection, which in turn, can optimize outcomes (Ibrahim et al. 2000). We recently determined that in our county, a quarter of elderly patients with fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli infections received ineffective empiric therapy with a fluoroquinolone and had persistent or recurrent infections, likely due to lack of awareness among providers about local resistance rates in this age group. Furthermore, because residents of long-term care facilities are at high risk for colonization or infection with multidrug-resistant organisms, some have advocated creation of <b>antibiograms</b> specific for long-term care facility residents (Philippe et al. 2011). However, because many long-term care facilities lack resources to create their own <b>antibiograms,</b> a more practical option may be for providers to rely on hospital-based age-stratified <b>antibiograms,</b> as we have created.|$|R

40|$|<b>Antibiogram</b> typing of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus with {{selected}} antibiotics {{was evaluated}} {{as a primary}} epidemiological typing tool and compared with ribotyping. Antibiograms were derived with the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method by using erythromycin, clindamycin, cotrimoxazole, gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin. For typing, <b>antibiogram</b> data were analyzed by similarity analysis of disk zone diameters (quantitative <b>antibiogram</b> typing). One hundred seventy-two isolates were typed. Reproducibility reached 98 % for the quantitative <b>antibiogram</b> and 100 % for ribotyping. With three selected restriction enzymes (EcoRV, HindIII, and KpnI), 40 epidemiologically unrelated isolates could be classified into 21 ribotypes, whereas quantitative <b>antibiogram</b> typing classified these isolates into 19 groups. To evaluate the discriminatory power of the methods, we calculated an index of discrimination from data obtained with these 40 isolates. This index takes into consideration both the number of types defined by the typing method and their relative frequencies. With both ribotyping and quantitative <b>antibiogram</b> typing, high discrimination indices (0. 972 and 0. 954, respectively) were obtained. When epidemiological links between patients (ward, period of hospitalization, and contacts between staff and patients) were compared {{with the results of}} ribotyping or the quantitative <b>antibiogram</b> typing method, it appeared that both methods were able to discriminate epidemiological clusters, with only a few discrepancies. In conclusion, quantitative <b>antibiogram</b> typing, although not necessarily based on genomic markers, is a simple method which enables a reliable workup of methicillin-resistant S. aureus epidemic when sophisticated molecular typing methods are not available...|$|E

MethodsDuring a period of 6 weeks, samples were taken from nose, external auditory canal, axilla, groin and umbilicus from consecutively admitted patients. Patients were sampled two {{times a week for}} up to 2 weeks. Isolates of S. epidermidis were characterized by <b>antibiogram,</b> plasmid pattern and biotype. ResultsFifteen patients were included. Each patient was sampled in one to four successive surveys, depending on the admission period. A total of 128 isolates of S. epidermidis were obtained and allocated to seven <b>antibiogram</b> types, 36 plasmid types and 14 biotypes. One plasmid type found in 58 isolates (six patients) corresponded with one multiresistant <b>antibiogram</b> type. The number of isolates with these characteristics increased per neonate from the first survey to the fourth. Nineteen isolates from four patients were allocated to a second plasmid type and were of a common <b>antibiogram</b> type. The remaining 34 plasmid types were sporadic.

40|$|Introduction: Antibiotics are bactericidal/bacteriostatic {{molecules}} that control bacterial infections, its misuse favors multidrug or therapeutic {{failure in the}} case of naturally resistant bacterial strains, thus generating a health risk. Objective: To analyze the use of antibiotics in urine <b>antibiograms</b> carried out by a clinical laboratory (central-western region, Colombia). Materials and methods: A descriptive-retrospective study was made. Urine and <b>antibiograms</b> data were collected from April 2014 to June 2015 by a clinical laboratory in the central-western region of Colombia. The obtained data was confronted with the protocols described by the National Institute of Health of Colombia. Results: 1815 reports of urine and <b>antibiograms</b> were analyzed, identifying 18 bacterial species. In the 22. 3 % (403) of cases, antibiotics were evaluated and reported on naturally resistant microorganisms. Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed greater resistance and the antibiotic with the highest resistance was nalidixic acid (66. 7 %). Conclusion: The study showed {{that there is a problem}} in managing, reporting and interpreting <b>antibiograms</b> against naturally resistant microorganisms, which could favor the development of multidrug in sensitive microorganisms of bacterial flora. A review of national and international bibliography showed similar reports; however, no author mentions intrinsic resistances, so the data of antibiotic resistance would be over evaluated...|$|R

Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA Abstract: Despite the {{enormous}} volume of antibiotics prescribed by pediatricians, resources to promote judicious antibiotic use are primarily limited to hospitals. The primary {{objective of this}} survey was to delineate the availability, characteristics, and perceptions of antibiograms among pediatricians. As a secondary objective, we sought to delineate the availability of other infectious diseases (ID) -related educational resources among pediatricians, the perceived need for additional resources, and their general educational preferences. We developed an anonymous electronic survey using the Research Electronic Data Capture tool, and it was sent via email to {{all members of the}} Illinois Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics (ICAAP). Participants were excluded if they had not completed pediatrics residency or if they had not prescribed antibiotics in the past month. Of the 1, 825 ICAAP members, 294 (16 %) responded; of these, 239 (81 %) were eligible and completed the survey. Of the 239 respondents, 139 (58 %) had access to an <b>antibiogram</b> and 60 (25 %) had access to a pediatric-specific <b>antibiogram.</b> Access to a pediatric-specific <b>antibiogram</b> was associated with subspecialty training (P= 0. 007) and practice location in Chicago (P< 0. 0001). <b>Antibiogram</b> access was associated with perceiving being informed about resistance patterns at the national (67 % vs 54 %, P= 0. 043) and local (76 % vs 45 %, P< 0. 0001) levels. Nearly all (95 %) respondents would probably or definitely use a single <b>antibiogram</b> that compiled antibiotic resistance data from children with common infections throughout the region. More than 75 % of respondents identified both the American Academy of Pediatrics Red Book and online medical resources among the top three most useful and most frequently accessed educational resources. In addition, 91 % of respondents utilized smartphones/tablets. These data suggest that there is an unmet need for additional educational resources to guide antibiotic prescribing among Illinois pediatricians. In addition, an electronic regional <b>antibiogram</b> would be well received and could potentially improve knowledge of antibiotic resistance and empiric antibiotic use.

40|$|Nosocomial infections occur {{worldwide}} and affect both developed and resource-poor countries. Infections acquired {{in health care}} settings are among the major causes of death and increased morbidity among hospitalized patients. Antibiograms are the aggregate percentages of organisms susceptible to various antibiotics on a hospital formulary and are usually presented on an annual basis. The main purpose of this information is to guide empiric antimicrobial therapy before specific patient culture results are available. The prevalence of nosocomial infection causing bacteria and their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern are reviewed in this study. Antibiograms are used to track the antibiotic resistance patterns of clinically important microorganisms detected by laboratories.

METHODS: We studied different approaches to analysing antimicrobial susceptibility rates (SRs) of all diagnostic bacterial isolates collected from patients hospitalized between July 2005 and June 2007 at the University Hospital in Zurich, Switzerland. We compared stratification for unit-specific, specimen type-specific (blood, urinary, respiratory versus all specimens) and isolate sequence-specific (first, follow-up versus all isolates) data with hospital-wide cumulative <b>antibiograms,</b> and studied changes of mean SR {{during the course of}} hospitalization. RESULTS: A total of 16 281 isolates (7965 first, 1201 follow-up and 7115 repeat isolates) were tested. We found relevant differences in SRs across different hospital departments. Mean SRs of Escherichia coli to ciprofloxacin ranged between 64. 5 % and 95. 1 % in various departments, and mean SRs of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to imipenem and meropenem ranged from 54. 2 % to 100 % and 80. 4 % to 100 %, respectively. Compared with hospital cumulative <b>antibiograms,</b> lower SRs were observed in intensive care unit specimens, follow-up isolates and isolates causing nosocomial infections (except for Staphylococcus aureus). Decreasing SRs were observed in first isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci with increasing interval between hospital admission and specimen collection.
