5|$|Although {{there is}} no known cure for {{multiple}} sclerosis, several therapies have proven helpful. The primary <b>aims</b> <b>of</b> therapy are returning function after an attack, preventing new attacks, and preventing disability. As with any medical treatment, medications used {{in the management of}} MS have several adverse effects. Alternative treatments are pursued by some people, despite the shortage of supporting evidence.|$|E

5|$|Arthur Blake Heinemann {{created the}} first breed {{standard}} and, in 1894, he founded the Devon and Somerset Badger Club, the <b>aims</b> <b>of</b> which were to promote badger digging rather than fox hunting, and the breeding of terriers suitable for this purpose. Terriers were acquired from Nicholas Snow of Oare, and they were likely descended from Russell's original dogs, as Russell would probably have hunted at some point with Snow's hunting club {{and is likely to}} have provided at least some of their original terriers. By the turn of the 20th century, Russell's name had become associated with this breed of dog.|$|E
5|$|At {{the federal}} level, Scientology lost a {{complaint}} against continued surveillance by the BfV in November 2004. The federal court based its opinion on its judgment that the <b>aims</b> <b>of</b> Scientology, as outlined by L. Ron Hubbard in his writings, were incompatible with the German constitution. Lawyers acting for the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution pointed out that Hubbard had written that civil rights, for example, should be restricted to Scientologists, and they asserted that the Scientology organization was taking systematic steps to infiltrate society and government institutions {{in order to prevent}} anti-Scientology legislation. Opposing counsel acting for the Church of Scientology had contended that Scientology was non-political, its aims were the liberation of the human being, and that Hubbard's instructions were valid only within the Church of Scientology and were subject to interpretation, and at any rate there was no effort to implement these instructions in Germany. The court disagreed and ruled that many sources, some of them not accessible to the general public, indicated that the <b>aims</b> <b>of</b> the Church of Scientology did include the abrogation of the principle of equality and other essential human rights.|$|E
5|$|Conjectures {{regarding}} extraterrestrial {{life have}} ensured a high-profile for Europa and {{have led to}} steady lobbying for future missions. The <b>aims</b> <b>of</b> these missions have ranged from examining Europa's chemical composition to searching for extraterrestrial life in its hypothesized subsurface oceans. Robotic missions to Europa need to endure the high-radiation environment around itself and Jupiter. Europa receives about 5.40 Sv of radiation per day.|$|E

5|$|During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, Kursura {{operated}} in the Arabian Sea. She {{was given the}} patrol duties at two designated areas before the war started, but was ordered to operate under two restrictions: she was not to cross demarcated shipping corridors and she could attack a target only after positive identification. The <b>aims</b> <b>of</b> her patrol were to sink any Pakistani naval warships, to sink merchant shipping when specifically ordered, and to conduct general patrol and surveillance.|$|E
5|$|Graffham was envisioned {{as a way}} {{to bolster}} the <b>aims</b> <b>of</b> Fortitude North, and overall this aspect of the plan was successful. German documents, {{captured}} after the war, showed that, although they did not believe Norway to be the main invasion target, the Fortitude North units were considered capable of a diversionary attack. As a result of the deceptions, German forces in Scandinavia were put on higher alert and were not transferred south to reinforce France.|$|E
5|$|Hermano Pule {{immediately}} sent {{a letter}} to Archbishop José Seguí in Manila rebuking the acts of the Tayabas friars, and accusing them of beatings and threatening the excommunication of cofradía members. He also challenged the friars' authority to do such acts because the <b>aims</b> <b>of</b> the cofradía were never against the Catholic faith. On January 29, 1841, Pule {{sent a letter}} to the Bishop of Nueva Cáceres restating that the cofradía was not against canon law. The letter was forwarded to the juez provisor of the bishopric, who then endorsed it to Fr. Antonio Mateo and Fr. Manuel Sancho, who rejected Pule's petition.|$|E

5|$|Heydrich was {{assigned}} to help organise the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. The games were used to promote the propaganda <b>aims</b> <b>of</b> the Nazi regime. Goodwill ambassadors were sent to countries that were considering a boycott. Anti-Jewish violence was forbidden for the duration, and news stands were required to stop displaying copies of Der Stürmer. For his part in the games' success, Heydrich was awarded the Deutsches Olympiaehrenzeichen or German Olympic Games Decoration (First Class).|$|E
5|$|In August 1932 {{there was}} an {{unsuccessful}} uprising by General José Sanjurjo, who had been particularly appalled by events in Castilblanco. The <b>aims</b> <b>of</b> the insurrection were vague, and it quickly turned into a fiasco. Among the generals tried and sent to Spanish colonies were four men who {{would go on to}} distinguish themselves fighting against the Republic in the civil war: the Duke of Seville, Martin Alonso, Ricardo Serrador Santés, and Heli Rolando de Tella y Cantos.|$|E
5|$|In November 2008, the Conservancy {{started the}} Rare Breed Swine Initiative, which, in {{cooperation}} with other organizations, assists in training breeders and cultivating the rare breed pig market. The three main foci of the initiative are marketing breeding stock and products, conserving bloodlines and supporting breed associations. As of 2010, proposals were {{in place for the}} funding of a study of porcine genetics, including variability and relationships among breeds, with the <b>aims</b> <b>of</b> maintaining genetic variability among rare pig breeds and releasing a definition of heritage pork.|$|E

5|$|It {{is unclear}} how much impact Zeppelin had on German {{response}} in the region, though the <b>aims</b> <b>of</b> the deception were achieved (tying up German defensive forces in the Mediterranean beyond D-Day). Post-war analysis of German intelligence documents indicated that they did overstate Allied forces in the way Zeppelin intended. However, the German high command {{did not come to}} expect a major invasion in the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|Like other Spanish liberals, Goya {{was left}} in a {{difficult}} position after the French invasion. He had supported the initial <b>aims</b> <b>of</b> the French Revolution, and hoped its ideals would help liberate Spain from feudalism to become a secular, democratic political system. There were two conflicts being fought in Spain: the resistance against the French threat, and a domestic struggle between the ideals of liberal modernisation and the pre-political incumbent ruling class. The latter divide became more pronounced—and the differences far more entrenched—following the eventual withdrawal of the French.|$|E
5|$|The Easter Rising was a {{rebellion}} staged in Ireland during Easter Week, 1916. It was mounted by Irish republicans with the <b>aims</b> <b>of</b> ending British rule in Ireland and establishing an Irish Republic. Organised by the Military Council of the Irish Republican Brotherhood, the rising lasted from 24–30 April 1916. Members of the Irish Volunteers, {{joined by the}} smaller Irish Citizen Army, along with 200 members of Cumann na mBan, seized key locations in Dublin and proclaimed an Irish Republic independent of Britain.|$|E

The <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> part two, ‘Interpretation of health-related quality of life scores’, was to facilitate the interpretation of Skindex- 29 scores and score differences. The <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> part three, ‘Health-related quality of life application in clinical practice’, was to support the application of HRQoL measurement in dermatological practice and to investigate the efficacy of a HRQoL intervention on patients’ HRQoL, doctor-patient communication, health status, and disease severity. The overall <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> the thesis was to contribute to the improvement of HRQoL of patients with a chronic skin disease...|$|R
40|$|The <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> Intercultural Information Ethics (IIE), as Ess aptly puts, is to “(a) address {{both local}} and global issues evoked by ICTs / CMC, etc., (b) in a ways that both sustain local traditions / values / preference, etc. and (c) provide shared, (quasi-) {{universal}} responses to central ethical problems” (Ess 2007 a, 102). This formulation <b>of</b> the <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> IIE, however, is not unambiguous. In this paper, I will discuss two different understandings <b>of</b> the <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> IIE, one of which advocates “shared norms, different interpretations” and another proposes “shared norms, different justifications”. I shall argue that the first understanding is untenable, and the second understanding is acceptable only with qualification. Finally, I shall briefly suggest an alternative way to understand the <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> IIE...|$|R

The band learned their studio output was not as easy to re-create live as it was with previous albums. An example was with the song 'Gloam' as the pedal changes were too rapid for live performances.|$|E
