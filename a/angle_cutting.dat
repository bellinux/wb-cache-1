In this paper, three-dimensional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are performed to investigate the effect of impacting direction on abrasive cutting process during abrasive flow polishing. The molecular dynamics simulation software Lammps was used to simulate the cutting of single crystal copper with SiC abrasive grains at different <b>cutting</b> <b>angles</b> (0 o– 45 o).

40|$|Introduction: Cutting is an {{important}} skill in team-sports, but unfortunately is also related to non-contact ACL injuries. The purpose was to examine knee kinetics and kinematics at different <b>cutting</b> <b>angles.</b> Material and methods:  13 males and 16 females performed cuts at different angles (45 °, 90 °, 135 ° and 180 °) at maximum speed. 3 D kinematics and kinetics were collected. To determine differences across <b>cutting</b> <b>angles</b> (45 °, 90 °, 135 ° and 180 °) and sex (female, male), a 4  ×  2 repeated measures ANOVA was conducted followed by post hoc comparisons (Bonferroni) with alpha level set at α ≤  0. 05  a priori. Results: At all <b>cutting</b> <b>angles,</b> males showed greater knee flexion angles than females (p <  0. 01). Also, where males performed all <b>cutting</b> <b>angles</b> with no differences {{in the amount of}} knee flexion − 42. 53 ° ±  8. 95 °, females decreased their knee flexion angle from − 40. 6 ° ±  7. 2 ° when cutting at 45 ° to − 36. 81 ° ±  9. 10 ° when cutting at 90 °, 135 ° and 180 ° (p <  0. 01). Knee flexion moment decreased for both sexes when <b>cutting</b> towards sharper <b>angles</b> (p <  0. 05). At 90 °, 135 ° and 180 °, males showed greater knee valgus moments than females. For both sexes, knee valgus moment increased towards the sharper <b>cutting</b> <b>angles</b> and then stabilized compared to the 45 ° <b>cutting</b> <b>angle</b> (p <  0. 01). Both females and males showed smaller vGRF when <b>cutting</b> to sharper <b>angles</b> (p <  0. 01). Conclusion: It can be concluded that different <b>cutting</b> <b>angles</b> demand different knee kinematics and kinetics. Sharper <b>cutting</b> <b>angles</b> place the knee more at risk. However, females and males handle this differently, which has implications for injury prevention...|$|R

The device is capable of force and velocity measurements of the shear <b>angle</b> <b>cutting</b> process with the abilities to vary cutting speed, knife preload, and blade geometry. The dimensions of the device are such that mobility to and from conditioning rooms in the laboratory environment are not limited. Assembly and disassembly ease as well as automatic versus manual operation options were incorporated for greater experimental flexibility. The device {{has the ability to}} evaluate products at a shear velocity of 200 inches per second, which equates to nearly 1000 feet per minute on a conventional slitter with 10 shear angle. The force measurement capability is 10 pounds, which is sufficient to handle the majority of Kodak films.
