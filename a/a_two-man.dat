5|$|In November 1994, <b>a</b> <b>two-man</b> British {{team was}} in Singapore to film the Changi Murals and Kranji War Memorial for a BBC documentary, for the Commonwealth War Graves Commission which marked the 50th Anniversary {{of the end}} of World War II.|$|E
5|$|Halkett's first {{design was}} a {{collapsible}} and inflatable boat made of rubber-impregnated cloth. When deflated, {{the hull of}} the boat could be worn as a cloak, the oar used as a walking stick, and the sail as an umbrella. This was followed by <b>a</b> <b>two-man</b> craft that was {{small enough to fit}} into a knapsack, and when deflated served as a waterproof blanket.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the Football League, the Premier League {{was set up}} with <b>a</b> <b>two-man</b> board: Rick Parry, {{the chief}} executive, and Sir John Quinton who was {{appointed}} as the league's chairman in December 1991. Decisions would be taken on by all members, through a one club-one vote motion. A clear majority needed two-thirds.|$|E
50|$|For 2002 to 2013, it {{consisted}} of three separate events: the Legends Division is <b>a</b> 54-hole <b>two-man</b> team better-ball event for men over 50, the Raphael Division is <b>a</b> 36-hole <b>two-man</b> team better-ball event for men age 50-69, and the Demaret Division is <b>a</b> 36-hole <b>two-man</b> team better-ball event for men over 70. Only the Legends Division event was an official money/official victory event.|$|R
50|$|The next variant, the Szpak-4A, was {{designed}} as an aerobatic aircraft. Only one prototype was built, flown on May 20, 1947. It had a steel fuselage frame rather than a wooden one, and <b>a</b> <b>two-men</b> side-by-side open cab. It was not certified as an aerobatic aircraft however, and {{was used by the}} factory as a utility plane in 1947-1948.|$|R
50|$|His {{first flight}} was on December 10, 1977 on Soyuz 26 {{to the space}} station Salyut 6. <b>A</b> <b>two-men</b> crew {{consisted}} of Romanenko as the flight commander and Georgi Grechko as engineer. They spent 96 days and 10 hours on the orbit, meeting Soyuz 27, Soyuz 28 and Progress 1. During the mission, Romanenko performed a one and a half hour long space walk.|$|R
5|$|Mohorič {{was passed}} by Alexey Tsatevich (Katusha) and Primož Roglič (LottoNL–Jumbo), {{who went on to}} contest <b>a</b> <b>two-man</b> sprint. Tsatevich won the sprint, despite an early celebration that nearly allowed Roglič to come past him. The peloton {{finished}} together, 14 seconds behind, with Jarlinson Pantano (IAM) winning the sprint for third place. Quintana therefore sealed his overall victory, with Contador second and Martin third.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{studies to}} grow the Mercury {{spacecraft}} capabilities to long-duration flights, developing space rendezvous techniques, and precision Earth landing, Project Gemini was started as <b>a</b> <b>two-man</b> program in 1962 to overcome the Soviets' lead and to support the Apollo manned lunar landing program, adding extravehicular activity (EVA) and rendezvous and docking to its objectives. The first manned Gemini flight, Gemini 3, was flown by Gus Grissom and John Young on March 23, 1965. Nine missions followed in 1965 and 1966, demonstrating an endurance mission of nearly fourteen days, rendezvous, docking, and practical EVA, and gathering medical data {{on the effects of}} weightlessness on humans.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1921 season, Barrow was {{appointed}} {{general manager of}} the New York Yankees and requested that Krichell join him as a full-time scout. At the time, the Yankees had <b>a</b> <b>two-man</b> scouting rotation, and Barrow believed the appointment of Krichell would improve the scouting staff. The first player signed by Krichell was Hinkey Haines, an outfielder from Penn State University. He signed catcher Benny Bengough from Buffalo of the International League, and Charlie Caldwell, a Princeton University graduate. Caldwell was used mainly as a batting practice pitcher, appearing in just three games in his major league career. During one practice, Caldwell fractured Wally Pipp's skull with a high fastball, allowing Lou Gehrig to assume Pipp's place in the starting lineup.|$|E

5000|$|In 1960, {{following}} {{the demise of}} a few short-lived Houston-based groups called The Swingsters and the Nite Hawks, Joe Sample (piano), Stix Hooper (drums), Wilton Felder (saxophone), and Wayne Henderson (trombone), relocated to Los Angeles. After changing their name to [...] "The Jazz Crusaders," [...] the group signed with Pacific Jazz Records, where they would remain throughout the 1960s. Employing <b>a</b> <b>two-manned</b> front-line horn section (trombone and tenor saxophone), the group's sound was rooted in hard bop, {{with an emphasis on}} R&B and soul.|$|R
50|$|BMP-2 (Ob'yekt 675) - An IFV with {{enhanced}} fighting qualities {{based on}} the BMP-1 and fitted with <b>a</b> new <b>two-man</b> turret armed with a 30 mm 2A42 autocannon.|$|R
5|$|Arsène Lupin III, the {{grandson}} of the fictional gentleman thief, Arsène Lupin, is considered the world's greatest thief, known for announcing his intentions to steal valuable objects by sending a calling card to the owners of his desired items. His right-hand man and closest ally is Daisuke Jigen, an expert marksman who can accurately shoot a target in 0.3 seconds. Although Lupin and Jigen frequently work as <b>a</b> <b>two-man</b> team, they are often joined by Goemon Ishikawa XIII, a master swordsman whose sword can cut anything, or Fujiko Mine, a femme fatale and Lupin's love interest. Although Fujiko usually works together with the others, she occasionally exploits Lupin's interest in her to steal the treasure for herself. Lupin and his gang are constantly chased by Inspector Koichi Zenigata of the ICPO, who has made it his life's work to arrest them, pursuing Lupin across the globe.|$|E
5|$|Born in Birmingham, Alabama, {{he moved}} {{with his family to}} Decatur, Illinois at age11. Prior to his senior year in high school, his family moved to Detroit. In 1945, {{following}} Fonville's lone track season at Detroit's Miller High School, he was named Michigan High School Track & Field Athlete of the Year for his first-place performance at the Detroit City League Meet. Fonville's winning effort in the shot put was five feet better than that of the state champion. Later that summer, Charlie Fonville and Jessie Nimmons competed in the Detroit YMCA Track Championship as <b>a</b> <b>two-man</b> team for the St. Antoine YMCA; Fonville won the 100m, 200m, high jump, and shot put. Fonville and Nimmons won the 440yard relay, with each of them running 220yard legs. They were later disqualified for not having four runners. They finished in second place at the meet; their disqualification in the 440 preventing them from winning.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} give its astronauts {{experience}} before these programs started, the Blue Gemini program was proposed, which would have seen USAF astronauts fly on NASA missions in order to practice various techniques required for their own missions. This would have first seen cooperative missions between NASA and the US Air Force, with two missions flying with crews composed of one astronaut from NASA, and one from the USAF, followed by two missions with all-USAF crews, but performing missions for NASA. After these flights, the US Air Force would have flown a number of missions of its own. Firstly, it would have flown <b>a</b> <b>two-man</b> Agena rendezvous and docking mission, followed by two one-man scientific or technology research missions. Other proposed missions included tests of the Astronaut Mobility Unit {{which was designed to}} assist with EVAs, inertial navigation systems, and flying a radar imaging system.|$|E
50|$|In 2013, he {{achieved}} a very prestigious placing, finishing {{third in the}} Tour of Flanders. In the 2015 Gent-Wevelgem, after being in a solo breakaway for 50 kilometers in difficult weather conditions, Roelandts got passed by the group of chasers with 20 kilometers to go but managed to resist to {{the return of the}} peloton, finishing seventh. In June 2015, Roelandts came in second place at the National Road Race Champion. He lost out after <b>a</b> <b>two-men</b> break with Preben Van Hecke. He was named in the start list for the 2016 Giro d'Italia.|$|R
5000|$|Mounting the gun {{required}} <b>a</b> new <b>two-man</b> turret to be developed. [...] The resulting {{vehicle was}} initially named FV4101 Cromwell Heavy AT Gun, but renamed [...] "Charioteer" [...] before entering service.|$|R
25|$|The T22 series {{reverted to}} the M4 {{transmission}} because {{of problems with}} the early Torqmatic transmission used in the T20. The T22E1 tested an autoloader for the main gun, and eliminated the loader's position with <b>a</b> small <b>two-man</b> turret.|$|R
5|$|On 27 February 2007 (Horne's centenary), BBC Radio 4 {{broadcast}} a half-hour documentary tribute entitled Sound the Horne, hosted by Jimmy Carr. The following year, on 18 September, another Radio 4 documentary was broadcast, Thoroughly Modest Mollie, {{which focused on}} Horne's frequent ghost-writer, Mollie Millest, and featured Jonathan Rigby again as Horne.. Rigby reprised the role yet again in a new stage show, devised by Barry Took's widow Lyn, called Round the Horne – Unseen and Uncut, which toured in 2008 and 2009. Also in 2009, an unbroadcast pilot script written by Horne and Millest in 1966 was produced by Radio 4. Called Twice Ken is Plenty and intended as <b>a</b> <b>two-man</b> showcase for Horne and Kenneth Williams, the 21st-century version, broadcast on 1 September 2009, was performed by Rigby and, as Williams, Robin Sebastian.|$|E
5|$|The {{intervention}} in May 2000 {{was the first}} major deployment of British forces to Sierra Leone during the civil war, but {{was not the first time}} British personnel had served there. In May 1997, <b>a</b> <b>two-man</b> training team from the British Army was sent to train SLA officers but discovered that the SLA's strength was much lower than it had reported. The government was overthrown in a coup before any training could take place. Following the restoration of the elected government by the Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) in February 1998, HMS Cornwall sailed to Freetown with food and medical supplies. Her crew assisted with infrastructure repairs and her helicopter was used to move people and supplies around Sierra Leone until she left in mid-April. As the security situation in Sierra Leone deteriorated later in the year, the Royal Air Force (RAF) conducted a non-combatant evacuation operation under the codename Operation Spartic over Christmas 1998. Approximately 80 people—predominantly British citizens, many of them staff or dependants from the British High Commission—were evacuated over two days.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>two-man</b> {{committee}} was created {{with the aim}} of working with the Eagle and Washington clubs to resolve the debate over how many players to field in official games. Duncan F. Curry and William F. Ladd were chosen as the committee members, but Ladd withdrew and Adams was named as a substitute. His partner on the committee, Curry, had led the opposition to nine-man teams. Adams and Curry also differed on another issue: the length of games. At the time, a baseball game lasted until one of the teams had 21 runs; that team was awarded the victory. A change in how games were won was deemed necessary after the suspended game in 1854. Adams favored nine-inning games, while Curry wanted contests to last seven innings. A convention was scheduled for early 1857, and Adams joined a three-man committee tasked with encouraging local clubs to send delegates. At the convention, which consisted of one session each in January and February, Adams was voted president. The Knickerbockers had voted among themselves to back seven-inning games, but the other teams backed a motion for nine-inning contests, which passed.|$|E
25|$|In 1961 Tom Simpson {{became the}} first British winner in <b>a</b> {{controversial}} <b>two-man</b> sprint against Italian Nino Defilippis. Defilippis was the faster sprinter, but stopped pedalling too early because a finishing banner had been blown away and was foiled by Simpson.|$|R
50|$|The {{baseline}} vehicle is {{armed with a}} 12.7 mm (.50 cal) heavy machine gun. Its modular design allows it to be fitted {{with a variety of}} weapon systems, including a 20 mm autocannon and <b>an</b> armored <b>two-man</b> 90 mm gun turret.|$|R

5|$|Mini Metro was {{developed}} by Dinosaur Polo Club, <b>a</b> <b>two-man</b> independent video game development studio based in New Zealand. It is the first game from the studio, {{which was founded in}} 2013 by brothers Peter and Robert Curry. They had previously worked at video game developer Sidhe, but left in 2006 to pursue a career in developing indie games. Following a series of abandoned projects, Peter Curry recognised {{that he would have to}} restrict the scope of his projects in order to complete them, and with hopes of releasing a finished product, the brothers set a number of constraints while proposing ideas for a prototype game. Minimising the amount of production art was a necessary restriction, as they had little experience in creating art assets. Likewise, they did not want the game's concept to rely on audio content, due to lack of skills in producing music. They also did not want to hand-build each level in the game. Imposing these constraints meant that they could discard most of their potential game ideas immediately, and led to them concentrating on concepts that involved procedurally generated levels and abstract visual styles.|$|E
25|$|The T-34 (German designation: T-34/76) was the {{original}} tank with a 76.2mm gun in <b>a</b> <b>two-man</b> turret.|$|E
25|$|During the Snowmobile Best Trick, the {{brothers}} Colten and Caleb Moore successfully landed <b>a</b> <b>two-man</b> backflip but were disqualified because judges ruled the event {{as an individual}} sport. Daniel Bodin later took gold for the event.|$|E
2500|$|The 2009–10 season saw Rangers {{reach their}} fifth {{consecutive}} domestic final: against St Mirren in the Scottish League Cup, the club overcame <b>a</b> <b>two-men</b> [...] from red cards, a late deciding goal from Kenny Miller securing a record 27th {{victory in the}} competition. The league championship title was retained, with three matches remaining, at Easter Road, defeating Hibernian 1–0 with a Kyle Lafferty goal. The 2010–11 season, Smith's final season in charge, saw Rangers retain the League Cup, defeating Celtic at Hampden with a Nikica Jelavić goal in extra time. A third consecutive title was won by beating Kilmarnock 5–1 {{on the last day}} of the season, Smith's final match in charge of the club.|$|R

50|$|The {{day before}} her final mission, PT-109s crew lashed a U.S. Army 37 mm antitank {{gun to the}} foredeck, {{replacing}} <b>a</b> small, <b>two-man</b> life raft. Timbers used to secure the weapon to the deck later helped save their lives when used as a float.|$|R
5000|$|He {{is later}} saved {{on the day}} of his {{execution}} by Allen the Alien, to whom he agrees to reveal the [...] "secret": Viltrumites are a near-extinct race, with fewer than fifty pure-blood able individuals left. Emboldened by the incredible strength shown by his new ally, he begins <b>a</b> <b>two-men</b> campaign to eradicate Viltrum's supremacy. Embarking on adventures across the galaxy, they gather weapons and allies which will give them an advantage over the Viltrumites, before returning to Earth to collect Mark and Oliver. They are briefly waylaid by the Viltrumite champion Conquest, an old enemy of Invincible who is killed in the ensuing battle, but not before Mark is critically injured. Nolan spends the subsequent months bonding with Oliver while Mark heals.|$|R
50|$|The {{vehicle was}} based on a Morris Commercial C9 4x2 15-cwt truck chassis. On this chassis a {{rivetted}} hull was mounted with <b>an</b> open-topped <b>two-man</b> turret.
