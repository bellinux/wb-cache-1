40|$|Chemical {{pollutants}} {{are one of}} {{the main}} threats against biodiversity and chemicals affecting non-target organisms are of great environmental concern. The herbicide triclopyr is commonly used to keep weeds under control and is believed to be weakly toxic to animals and only lethal in high doses. However, the knowledge of possible sub-lethal behavior effects in low doses is scarce. This study investigates whether the wood ant (family Formica) show behavioral changes when exposed to sub-lethal doses of triclopyr. The main hypotheses tested were; i) ants behaving normally show a preference for dark surfaces (i. e. scototaxis); and ii) triclopyr affect this behavior trait among ants. The hypotheses were tested by exposing ants to diets containing 1, 10 and 100 mg/L triclopyr for 24 hours (acute) and 7 days (chronic). To what extent ants preferred the white surface (proportion of frames with the ant visible), their <b>activity</b> (<b>proportion</b> of speed above 1 mm/s) their exploration (proportion area covered) and their average velocities was measured using a newly developed tracking software (ToxTrac). The results clearly show that ants have preference for dark surfaces and thus, that the first hypothesis is valid. However, the second hypothesis appear invalid as the different exposures to triclopyr did not affect the examined behaviors. Based on the results, triclopyr appear to not affect non-target organism such as ants, although possible behavioral effects in other organisms and other behavioral traits cannot be excluded. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{purposes}} of this study were to quantify the actual upright activity of inpatient stroke patients in order to investigate the influence of disability, physiotherapy contact time, and time since stroke on the amount of activity recorded. Forty-one inpatients from three Glasgow stroke units were monitored during one therapeutic day. Measurements were made using an instrumented recording device which quantified (i) the proportion of time spent upright, and (ii) the frequency of transitions to upright. The results were compared to a global measure of disability, the Barthel Index, a functional mobility scale, the Rivermead Mobility Index (RMI) and walking speed. Results were also compared to time spent in physiotherapy and the time since their stroke. The patients spent an average of 8. 3 % of the therapeutic day upright. They transitioned to upright an average of 2. 6 times/hour. There were significant correlations between upright <b>activity</b> (<b>proportion</b> of time) and Barthel Index score (r = 0. 79, p < 0. 01), RMI score (r = 0. 77, p < 0. 01), walking speed (r = 0. 48, p = 0. 02), and physiotherapy time (r = 0. 43, p = 0. 01). Physiotherapy contact time was independently related to activity, indicating that physiotherapy directly influences quantity of mobility activity during inpatient rehabilitation. The patients spent a small proportion of the therapeutic day upright despite being in dedicated stroke rehabilitation units, and each patient's activity level was dependent upon both their level of disability and the amount of physiotherapy input they received...|$|E

40|$|Cydia pomonella {{is a major}} pest in {{apples in}} Denmark. Trichogramma spp. are known {{biocontrol}} agents of C. pomonella eggs and two naturally occurring species in Denmark, which are also both commercially available, were chosen for mass-release trials. Trichogramma evanescens, T. cacoeciae or a mix of the two species were evaluated for mass-release to control C. pomonella in two commercial organic apple orchards, one in 2012 and one in 2013, using a complete randomized block design.

Trichogramma activity was assessed using bait cards with Sitotroga cerealella eggs. The percent C. pomonella damaged fruit was recorded and the fruit yield was estimated. In 2012 cool and wet weather conditions resulted in low Trichogramma activity ( 10 times more frequently found in bait cards than T. cacoeciae. There was a significant effect of the treatment and year (p = 0. 009) and of the sampling period (p = 0. 0008) on Trichogramma <b>activity</b> (<b>proportion</b> bait cards parasitized), with no significant difference between treatments in 2012.

40|$|Background: Obesity has {{significant}} health and NHS cost implications. Relatively small reductions in weight have clinically important benefits, but long-term weight loss maintenance (WLM) is challenging. Behaviour change interventions {{have been identified}} as key for WLM. Motivation is crucial to supporting behaviour change, and motivational interviewing (MI) has been identified as a successful approach to changing health behaviours. The study was designed as an adequately powered, pragmatic randomised controlled trial (RCT); however, owing to recruitment issues, the study became a feasibility trial. Objectives: To assess recruitment, retention, feasibility, acceptability, compliance and delivery of a 12 -month intervention to support WLM. Secondary objectives were {{to assess the impact of}} the intervention on body mass index (BMI) and other secondary outcomes. Design: Three-arm individually randomised controlled trial comprising an intensive arm, a less intensive arm and a control arm. Setting: Community setting in South Wales and the East Midlands. Participants: Individuals aged 18 – 70 years with a current or previous BMI of ≥[*] 30 kg/m 2 who could provide evidence of at least 5 % weight loss during the previous 12 months. Intervention: Participants received individually tailored MI, which included planning and self-monitoring. The intensive arm received six face-to-face sessions followed by nine telephone sessions. The less intensive arm received two face-to-face sessions followed by two telephone sessions. The control arm received a leaflet advising them on healthy lifestyle. Main outcome measures: Feasibility outcomes included numbers recruited, retention and adherence. The primary effectiveness outcome was BMI at 12 months post randomisation. Secondary outcomes included waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, physical <b>activity,</b> <b>proportion</b> maintaining weight loss, diet, quality of life, health service resource usage, binge eating and well-being. A process evaluation assessed intervention delivery, adherence, and participants’ and practitioners’ views. Economic analysis aimed to assess cost-effectiveness in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Results: A total of 170 participants were randomised. Retention was good (84 %) and adherence was excellent (intensive, 83 %; less intensive, 91 %). The between-group difference in mean BMI indicated the intensive arm had BMIs 1. 0 [*]kg/m 2 lower than the controls [95 % confidence interval (CI) – 2. 2 kg/m 2 to 0. 2 [*]kg/m 2]. Similarly, a potential difference was found in weight (average difference of 2. 8 [*]kg, 95 % CI – 6. 1 kg to 0. 5 [*]kg). The intensive arm had odds of maintaining on average 43 % [odds ratio(OR) 1. 4, 95 % CI 0. 6 to 3. 5] higher than controls. None of these findings were statistically significant. Further analyses controlling for level of adherence indicated that average BMI was 1. 2 [*]kg/m 2 lower in the intensive arm than the control arm (95 % CI – 2. 5 [*]kg/m 2 to 0. 0 [*]kg/m 2). The intensive intervention led to a statistically significant difference in weight (mean – 3. 7 [*]kg, 95 % CI – 7. 1 [*]kg to – 0. 3 [*]kg). The other secondary outcomes showed limited evidence of differences between groups. The intervention was delivered as planned, and both practitioners and participants were positive about the intervention and its impact. Although not powered to assess cost-effectiveness, results of this feasibility study suggest that neither intervention as currently delivered is likely to be cost-effective in routine practice. Conclusion: This is the first trial of an intervention for WLM in the UK, the intervention is feasible and acceptable, and retention and adherence were high. The main effectiveness outcome showed a promising mean difference in the intensive arm. Owing to the small sample size, we are limited in the conclusions we can draw. However, findings suggest that the intensive intervention may facilitate long-term weight maintenance and, therefore, further testing in an effectiveness trial may be indicated. Research examining WLM is in its infancy, further research is needed to develop our understanding of WLM and to expand theory to inform the development of interventions to be tested in rigorously designed RCTs with cost-effectiveness assessed...|$|E

GDM and HDP diagnoses were self-reported for each pregnancy and validated in a subset. A Mediterranean diet score was created by use of a baseline-validated food-frequency questionnaire and dichotomized to reflect low adherence (< 25 th percentile) and higher adherence (≥ 25 th percentile). A causal inference framework for mediation analysis was used to estimate total, natural direct, and natural indirect effects of the prepregnancy Mediterranean diet on incident GDM and HDP and proportions mediated through prepregnancy BMI. Results: In 3378 women without a history of diabetes, 240 (7. 1 %) developed GDM. HDP was reported in 273 (8. 6 %) of 3167 women with no history of hypertension. Low adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with higher risk of GDM (OR: 1. 35; 95 % CI: 1. 02, 1. 60) and HDP (OR: 1. 41; 95 % CI: 1. 18, 1. 56), after adjustment for education, parity, polycystic ovary syndrome, energy intake, and physical <b>activity.</b> <b>Proportions</b> mediated through prepregnancy BMI (per 1 -kg/m 2 increase) were 32 % and 22 % for GDM and HDP, respectively. Conclusion: These findings suggest that prepregnancy BMI as a single mediator contributes substantially to the total effects of the prepregnancy Mediterranean diet on GDM and HDP risk...|$|R

40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{the activities of}} acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase, and of the metabolic enzymes enolase and lactate dehydrogenase, in the superior cervical ganglion, ciliary ganglion, dorsal root ganglion, stellate ganglion, and caudate nucleus of the cat; we found that these tissues possess very different levels of enzymic <b>activities.</b> The <b>proportions</b> of the alpha alpha, alpha gamma, and gamma gamma enolase isozymes are also quite variable. We particularly studied the molecular forms of acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase, in normal tissues and in preganglionically denervated SCG, in comparison with earlier histochemical findings. The {{results are consistent with}} the premise that the G 1 (globular monomer) forms of both enzymes are located in the cytoplasm, the G 4 (globular tetramer) forms are at the plasma membranes, and the A 12 (collagen-tailed, asymmetric dodecamer) form of acetylcholinesterase is at synaptic sites...|$|R
