5|$|The {{human brain}} has many {{properties}} {{that are common}} to all vertebrate brains, and shares many features common to all mammalian brains, most notably a six-layered cerebral cortex {{and a set of}} associated structures, including the hippocampus and amygdala. The cortex is proportionally larger in greater mammals and humans than many other animals. Humans have more association cortex, sensory and motor parts than other mammals such as the rat <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>cat.</b>|$|E

5|$|Ellen Louise Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is {{the primary}} protagonist of the main Alien series. The mother of Amanda Ripley and a warrant officer on the Nostromo, she <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>cat</b> Jones are the sole {{survivors}} of the expedition. After putting herself <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>cat</b> in cryosleep, she is rescued fifty-seven years later and relieved of duty by Weyland-Yutani {{for the destruction of}} the Nostromo and her outlandish claims about the Alien. After communication is lost with LV-426, Ripley is sent with a unit of colonial marines on the Sulaco to investigate; the entire expedition, except Ripley, Corporal Hicks, the orphan Newt and the android Bishop, is lost. In cryosleep on the Sulaco, Ripley is impregnated with a queen by a facehugger Alien morph; this triggers a fire, which causes the ship to crash on the prison planet Fiorina 161, killing all aboard, save for Ripley. As the sole human survivor of the crash, Ripley helps the prisoners incarcerated on the planet to defeat an Alien created from an animal impregnated by a second facehugger. Weyland-Yutani arrives to claim the queen incubating in Ripley, prompting her to sacrifice herself by diving into the furnace.|$|E

Benjamin's father enters the garden looking for his son. He knocks the cat away from the basket and locks her in the greenhouse, then rescues Benjamin and Peter. But he also punishes them for going to Mr. McGregor's garden by whipping them with a switch he had brought. Once home, Peter gives the onions to his mother, who forgives his adventure because he has recovered his jacket and shoes. Following his return, Mr. McGregor is puzzled by the ridiculously small footprints and the scarecrow's missing clothes <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>cat</b> locked in the greenhouse.|$|E

The {{age at which}} a kitten becomes {{difficult}} to socialize is not agreed upon, but suggestions generally range from seven weeks to four months of age.

The Cat fought back, but Elix Skipper, who accompanied Storm, pulled The Cat out of the ring, and attacked him. Storm sent The Cat into the guard rail, and performed a missile dropkick. The Cat fought back briefly until Jim Duggan came down, and hit him. Storm forced The Cat to submit with the Canadian Maple Leaf, and won the match. After the match, Skipper and Storm beat down Duggan until The Cat fought them off.|$|E
25|$|The Cat Craig {{is located}} beside the lane {{running up to}} Cockston farm {{and is one of}} two {{drystone}} wall enclosed crags. The name 'Cat' is applied to many stones, such as the 'Cat Stone' on the Isle of Arran near the village of Corrie <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cat</b> Stane near Edinburgh Airport. 'Cat' is thought to come from 'Cath', a Celtic word, meaning a 'battle.' The Norwegian term, 'Bauta Stein', means the same thing. The first edition of the OS 6inch maps shows a 'Castle Hill' in line with Cockston Farm {{on the other side of}} the Maich Water and this may make the meaning of the name 'Cat Craig' more plausible. Cockston Farm and sheep fauld date from at least 1827.|$|E

25|$|Local radio {{stations}} in the county include Dee 106.3, Heart and Gold for Chester and West Cheshire, Silk FM for {{the east of the}} county, Signal 1 <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Cat</b> 107.9 for the south, Wire FM for Warrington and Wish FM, which covers Widnes. Cheshire is one of the only counties (along with County Durham, Dorset and Rutland) that does not have its own designated BBC Radio station. The majority of the county (south and east) are covered by BBC Radio Stoke, whilst BBC Radio Merseyside tends to cover the west. The BBC directs readers to Stoke and Staffordshire when Cheshire is selected on their website. The BBC covers the west with BBC Radio Merseyside, the north and east with BBC Radio Manchester and the south with BBC Radio Stoke. There were plans to launch BBC Radio Cheshire, but those were shelved in 2007 after a lower than expected BBC licence fee settlement.|$|E

500|$|The book led {{directly}} {{to the creation of}} Beginner Books, a publishing house centered on producing books like The Cat in the Hat for beginning readers. According to Judith and Neil Morgan, when the book caught the attention of Phyllis Cerf, the wife of Geisel's publisher, Bennett Cerf, she arranged for a meeting with Geisel, where the two agreed to create Beginner Books. Geisel became the president and editor, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cat</b> in the Hat served as their mascot. Geisel's wife, Helen, was made third partner. Random House served as distributor until 1960, when Random House purchased Beginner Books. Geisel wrote multiple books for the series, including The Cat in the Hat Comes Back (1958), Green Eggs and Ham (1960), Hop on Pop (1963), and Fox in Socks (1965). He initially used word lists of limited vocabularies to create these books, as he had with The Cat in the Hat, but moved away from the lists as he came to believe [...] "that a child could learn any amount of words if fed them slowly and if the books were amply illustrated". Other authors also contributed notable books to the series, including A Fly Went By (1958), Sam and the Firefly (1958), Go, Dog. Go! (1961), and The Big Honey Hunt (1962).|$|E

500|$|The video {{opens with}} the view of a city {{populated}} with skyscrapers, intermingling railway lines and aero-crafts. Steam blows out of the funnels of a factory as big machines are shown. Madonna, wearing black lingerie, appears {{on the back of}} a statue of an angry looking swan, and utters the line: [...] "Come on girls, do you believe in love?" [...] This is followed by the chorus, showing the interiors of the factory where the workers slave at the machines, as rain pour incessantly on them. Amidst the smoke filled environment, the chiseled torso of the male workers are shown, as they strip off their shirts, with water splashing all around. Madonna is then shown in a light-green gown, holding a black cat in her lap, looking across the factory from her sitting room of her penthouse office. As she sings the first verse, the workers perform choreographed dance routine inside the factory. Madonna lies down on a sofa <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>cat</b> escapes from her lap, as her singing reaches the owner of the factory, through a series of speakers.

After {{the birth}} and escape of the Alien, Jones is {{detected}} by the crew and risks interfering with the ship's motion sensors (which could mistake the cat's movements for those of the Alien). Brett finds Jones in the cargo room, where the Alien kills Brett as Jones watches. When the remaining crew members prepare to escape the ship, Ripley loads Jones into a pet carrier but must temporarily abandon him as the Alien approaches her. The Alien inspects Jones but leaves him alone, since the cat poses no threat. Ripley retrieves Jones and flees {{with him on a}} shuttle. She <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>cat</b> are in cryosleep for fifty-seven years, until they are rescued. Jones remains Ripley's pet for the duration of her new employment until she departs on the Sulaco, leaving him behind. Four cats were used in Alien, with each exhibiting specific feline behaviors such as scampering and hissing. According to Ridley Scott's audio commentary on the Alien DVD, to capture Jones' fearful reaction to the Alien a screen was placed between the cat and a German Shepherd; when the screen between the animals was removed, the cat immediately hissed.|$|E
500|$|The Cat {{brings in}} a big red box from outside, from which he {{releases}} two identical creatures with blue hair and red suits called Thing One and Thing Two. The Things cause more trouble, such as flying kites in the house, knocking pictures {{off the wall and}} picking up the children's mother's new polka-dotted gown. All this comes to an end when the fish spots the children's mother out the window. In response, Sally's brother catches the Things in a net, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cat,</b> apparently ashamed, stores them back in the big red box. He takes it out the front door as the fish and the children survey the mess he has made. But the Cat soon returns, riding a machine that picks everything up and cleans the house, delighting the fish and the children. The Cat then leaves just before their mother arrives, and the fish and the children are back where they started {{at the beginning of the}} story. As she steps in, the mother asks the children what they did while she was out, but the children are hesitant and do not answer. The story ends with the question, [...] "What would you do if your mother asked you?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Martel has {{mentioned}} that a book review he read of Brazilian author Moacyr Scliar's 1981 novella Max <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cats</b> accounts {{in part for}} his novel's premise. Scliar's story describes a Jewish-German refugee crossing the Atlantic Ocean with a jaguar in his boat. Scliar {{said that he was}} perplexed that Martel [...] "used the idea without consulting or even informing me," [...] and indicated that he was reviewing the situation before deciding whether to take any action in response. After talking with Martel, Scliar elected not to pursue the matter. A dedication to Scliar [...] "for the spark of life" [...] appears in the author's note of Life of Pi. Literary reviews have described the similarities between Life of Pi <b>and</b> Max <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cats</b> as superficial. Reviewer Peter Yan wrote: [...] "Reading the two books side-by-side, one realizes how inadequate bald plot summaries are in conveying the unique imaginative impact of each book," [...] and noted that Martel's distinctive narrative structure is not found in Scliar's novella. The themes of the books are also dissimilar, with Max <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cats</b> being an allegory for Nazism. In Life of Pi, 211 of 354 pages are devoted to Pi's experience in the lifeboat, compared to Max <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cats,</b> in which 17 of its 99 pages depict time spent in a lifeboat.|$|R
