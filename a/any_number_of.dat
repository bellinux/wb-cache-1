5|$|One {{consequence}} of this fact appears in the bit-reversed ordering of integer data types used by some computer algorithms, such as the Cooley–Tukey fast Fourier transform. This ordering has the property that the farther to the left the first 1 occurs in a number's binary expansion, or the more times it is divisible by 2, the sooner it appears. Zero's bit reversal is still zero; it can be divided by 2 <b>any</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> times, and its binary expansion does not contain any 1s, so it always comes first.|$|E

Examples include regional variations using a grass prairie scheme (in the American midwest) and California chaparral cottage gardens.|$|E

5|$|The {{spectacular}} play {{died out}} with the Restoration period, but spectacle would continue on the English stage as the splendours of Italian grand opera hit London in the early 18th century. The dangerous Restoration economic spiral of the ever-more-expensive machine plays would teach 18th- and 19th-century theatrical entrepreneurs to dispense with playwrighting altogether and minimise the cast, utilising <b>any</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> surprising effects and scenes in the dumbshow of pantomime and Harlequin, without attendant costs in music, dramatists, and cast.|$|E
5|$|This {{may have}} been for <b>any</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> reasons.

Carr's book, which stated results without proofs. Finally, it is possible that Ramanujan considered his workings to be for his personal interest alone and therefore recorded only the results.|$|E

5|$|Unlike C++, C# {{does not}} support {{multiple}} inheritance, although a class can implement <b>any</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> interfaces. This was a design decision by the language's lead architect to avoid complication and simplify architectural requirements throughout CLI. When implementing multiple interfaces that contain a method with the same signature, C# allows implementing each method depending on which interface that method is being called through, or, like Java, allows implementing the method once, and have that be the one invocation on a call through any of the class's interfaces.|$|E
5|$|Another key {{elements}} to Durkheim's theory {{of knowledge is}} his concept of représentations collectives (collective representations), which is outlined in The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life. Représentations collectives are the symbols and images that come to represent the ideas, beliefs, and values elaborated by a collectivity and are not reducible to individual constituents. They can include words, slogans, ideas, or <b>any</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> material items that {{can serve as a}} symbol, such as a cross, a rock, a temple, a feather etc. As Durkheim elaborates, représentations collectives are created through intense social interaction and are products of collective activity. As such these representations have the particular, and somewhat contradictory, aspect that they exist externally to the individual (since they are created and controlled not by the individual but by society as a whole), and yet simultaneously within each individual of the society (by virtue of that individual's participation within society).|$|E
5|$|Another legend narrated in the Arakanese chronicle {{relates to}} the nine {{phenomena}} that occurred when the image was consecrated in the temple and continued to occur after the Buddha had departed. These nine phenomena were: holy water used for washing the image would not overflow the collecting vessels; {{the water from the}} tank that was used for washing the Buddha's head would retain its quality throughout the year; six coloured rays appeared when the devotees worshipped the image in the evenings; the rays faded in the presence of non-believers; the space in the temple would automatically accommodate <b>any</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> devotees; the leaves of trees would tilt {{in the direction of the}} Buddha image; birds would not fly over the temple; and the stone guardians at the entrance would sense the presence of evil doers and prevent them from entering the temple.|$|E
