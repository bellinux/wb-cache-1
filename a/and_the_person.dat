5|$|Progressive {{deterioration}} eventually hinders independence, with subjects {{being unable}} to perform most common activities of daily living. Speech difficulties become evident due to an inability to recall vocabulary, which leads to frequent incorrect word substitutions (paraphasias). Reading and writing skills are also progressively lost. Complex motor sequences become less coordinated as time passes and AD progresses, so the risk of falling increases. During this phase, memory problems worsen, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> may fail to recognise close relatives. Long-term memory, which was previously intact, becomes impaired.|$|E
5|$|The {{first point}} regards two officially listed victims, Paul Hiatt and Dale Thayer. They were {{reported}} missing after the explosion. In the aftermath, investigators {{were able to}} locate individuals named Paul Hiatt and Dale Thayer who were alive and well. However, {{they were unable to}} determine who reported Hiatt missing, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> who was listed as reporting Thayer missing claimed she wasn't the one who had done so. Since the investigators could not thus verify that they were the same Hiatt and Thayer who were reported missing, the names remain listed among the presumed dead.|$|E

5|$|The intergiro {{classification}} {{was marked}} by a blue jersey.

Although no jersey was awarded, there was also one classification for the teams, in which the stage finish times of the best three cyclists per team were added; the leading team was the one with the lowest total time.|$|E

5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and {{her mother}} visit her brother Bill and his {{pregnant}} wife Tara around Christmas time. Scully answers the phone, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> on the other line, who sounds just like her dead sister Melissa, tells her that someone needs her help. Scully traces the call to a nearby home in San Diego {{where a group of}} cops are investigating the suicide of a woman, Roberta Sim. The lead detective, Kresge, tells Scully that it was impossible for Roberta to have dialed, as she died before the telephone call was made. That night after dinner Scully reveals to her mother that due to her abduction and cancer she is unable to bear children. Scully flashes back to when as a child, she hid her pet rabbit from her brother in a lunchbox, only for it to suffocate and die. Scully receives another telephone call from the same person on her cell phone, which was once again made from the Sim home. Roberta's husband, Marshall, is meeting with two dark-suited men inside his house and has no desire to listen to and help Scully figure out what is going on.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{negative}} effects of poison, which were so evident in these times, cures were being found in poison, even at such a time where it was hated by the most of the general public. An example {{can be found in the}} works of Iranian born Persian physician, philosopher, and scholar Rhazes, writer of Secret of Secrets, which was a long list of chemical compounds, minerals and appratus, the first man to distil alcohol and use it as an anti-septic, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> who suggested mercury be used as a laxative. He made discoveries relating to a mercury chloride called corrosive sublimate. An ointment derived from this sublimate was used to cure what Rhazes described as 'the itch', which is now referred to as scabies. This proved an effective treatment because of mercury's poisonous nature and ability to penetrate the skin, allowing it to eliminate the disease and the itch.|$|E
5|$|During {{his early}} years as a practising barrister, Garrow was {{particularly}} noted for his aggressive and confrontational style of cross-examination. When James Wingrove was charged with theft and violence {{in the course of}} a highway robbery in 1784, Garrow's cross-examination of William Grove (who acted as a witness <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> charging Wingrove) got him to admit that he was perjuring himself in an attempt to get a reward, and that Wingrove had not robbed the two injured parties. Garrow showed a dislike of most thief-takers, of which Grove was one, although he did not treat the Bow Street Runners and other professionals with contempt. His dislike of such men was highlighted in his defence of three men in 1788 for theft; they were charged with assaulting John Troughton, putting him in fear of his life, and stealing his hat. The issue was whether the assault put him in fear of his life, or whether he was exaggerating to claim a reward, which could not be claimed for simple theft. Garrow established that Troughton was uncertain about how he lost his hat, despite his attempts to claim that the defendants knocked it off him, and after four witnesses gave character evidence the defendants were found not guilty.|$|E
5|$|For {{the points}} classification, which awarded a purple (or cyclamen) jersey to its leader, cyclists were given points for {{finishing}} {{a stage in}} the top 15; additional points could also be won in intermediate sprints. The green jersey was awarded to the mountains classification leader. In this ranking, points were won by reaching the summit of a climb ahead of other cyclists. Each climb was ranked as either first, second or third category, with more points available for higher category climbs. The Cima Coppi, the race's highest point of elevation, awarded more points than the other first category climbs. The Cima Coppi for this Giro was the Col Agnel, {{but it was not}} climbed due to avalanches that prevented the riders from being able to pass on the roads. The intergiro classification was marked by a blue jersey. The calculation for the intergiro {{is similar to that of}} the general classification, in each stage there is a midway point that the riders pass through a point and where their time is stopped. As the race goes on, their times compiled <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> with the lowest time is the leader of the intergiro classification and wears the blue jersey.|$|E

5|$|Huntington's disease (HD), {{also known}} as Huntington's chorea, is an {{inherited}} disorder that results in death of brain cells. The earliest symptoms are often subtle problems with mood or mental abilities. A general lack of coordination and an unsteady gait often follow. As the disease advances, uncoordinated, jerky body movements become more apparent. Physical abilities gradually worsen until coordinated movement becomes difficult <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> is unable to talk. Mental abilities generally decline into dementia. The specific symptoms vary somewhat between people. Symptoms usually begin between 30 and 50 years of age, but can start at any age. The disease may develop earlier in life in each successive generation. About 8% of cases start {{before the age of}} 20 years and typically present with symptoms more similar to Parkinson's disease. People with HD often underestimate the degree of their problems.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} and excavation of the Hoxne Hoard improved {{the relationship between}} the archaeological profession and the community of metal detectorists. Archaeologists were pleased that Lawes reported the find promptly and largely undisturbed, allowing a professional excavation. Metal detectorists noted that Lawes' efforts were appreciated by the archaeological profession. The 1996 Treasure Act is thought to have contributed to more hoards being made available to archaeologists. The act changed the law so that the owner of the land <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> who finds the hoard have a strong stake {{in the value of the}} discovery. The manner of the finding of the Hoxne Hoard by metal detector, and its widespread publicity, contributed to changing the previous system of common law for dealing with treasure trove into a statutory legal framework that takes into account technology such as metal detectors, provides incentives for treasure hunters to report finds, and considers the needs of museums and scholars.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} procedure used {{to prevent}} smallpox was inoculation (known as variolation after the introduction of smallpox vaccine to avoid possible confusion), which likely occurred in India, Africa, and China well before the practice arrived in Europe. However, the idea that inoculation originated in India has been challenged, as few of the ancient Sanskrit medical texts described the process of inoculation. Accounts of inoculation against smallpox in China can be found {{as early as the}} late 10th century, and the procedure was widely practiced by the 16th century, during the Ming dynasty. If successful, inoculation produced lasting immunity to smallpox. However, because the person was infected with variola virus, a severe infection could result, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>person</b> could transmit smallpox to others. Variolation had a 0.5–2 percent mortality rate, considerably less than the 20–30 percent mortality rate of the disease. Two reports on the Chinese practice of inoculation were received by the Royal Society in London in 1700; one by Dr. Martin Lister who received a report by an employee of the East India Company stationed in China and another by Clopton Havers.|$|E
