25|$|Rifkin {{committed}} {{his first}} murder in 1989, killing {{a woman in}} his home in East Meadow, Nassau County, Long Island, New York. He then dismembered her body, removing her teeth and fingertips, putting her head in a paint can and then leaving the paint can in the woods of a southern New Jersey golf course <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> farther north in New Jersey and then dumping her remaining torso and arms into the East River around New York City.|$|E
25|$|Police {{officers}} found a {{fire extinguisher}} and squirted its foam into {{the wounds of}} an injured occupant. Other occupants were thrown down the stairs head-first. Eventually, they dragged all occupants into the ground-floor hall, where they had gathered dozens of prisoners {{from all over the}} building in a mess of blood and excrement. They threw her on top of two other people. They were not moving, and Lena Zuhlke drowsily asked them if they were alive. They did not reply, and she lay there on her back, unable to move her right arm, unable to stop her left arm <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> twitching, blood seeping out of her head wounds. A group of police officers walked by, and each one lifted the bandana which concealed his identity, leaned down and spat on her face. Many victims of the raid were taken to the San Martino hospital, where police officers walked up and down the corridors, slapping their clubs into the palms of their hands, ordering the injured not to move around or look out of the window, keeping handcuffs on many of them and then, often with injuries still untended, shipping them across the city to join scores of others, from the Diaz school and from the street demonstrations, detained at the detention centre in the city's Bolzaneto district.|$|E
500|$|Frederick M. Smith {{describes}} Kamadhenu as a [...] "popular {{and enduring}} image in Indian art". All the gods {{are believed to}} reside {{in the body of}} Kamadhenu—the generic cow. Her four legs are the scriptural Vedas; her horns are the triune gods Brahma (tip), Vishnu (middle) and Shiva (base); her eyes are the sun and moon gods, her shoulders the fire-god Agni and the wind-god Vayu <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> the Himalayas. Kamadhenu is often depicted in this form in poster art.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Rod Hardy, making it his first credit for the series. Hardy was offered the role after an unknown individual working at The X-Files saw his TBS remake of the film High Noon. The parasitic creature {{that was used in}} the episode was created using animatronics and was designed to look like a banana slug. During the scene where the creature is inserted into Scully's back, the production crew created a false fiberglass back for Gillian Anderson. To create the illusion that the creature was crawling up the body, the fiberglass was placed on top of Anderson, and then the animatronic slug was pressed against the fake back. Anderson later described the scene as [...] "fun to shoot", although she also called it [...] "exhausting" [...] because she had to struggle on the bed, all the while tied down, with her arms being attached to the headboard <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> to the footboard. Paul Rabwin later noted that he had several cameramen [...] "start to lose it" [...] during the scene.|$|E
500|$|In Mirror's Edge, {{the player}} {{controls}} the protagonist, Faith, from a first-person perspective {{as she is}} challenged to navigate across a gleaming city by jumping between rooftops, running across walls, and gaining access to buildings through ventilation shafts. This is accomplished by use of techniques and movements inspired by the discipline of parkour. According to senior producer Owen O'Brien, Mirror's Edge aims to [...] "convey [...] strain and physical contact with the environment", {{with the goal of}} allowing a freedom of movement previously unseen in the first-person genre. In order to achieve this, camera movement pays more attention to character movement. For example, as Faith's speed builds up while running, {{the rate at which the}} camera bobs up and down increases as well. When a roll is executed, the camera spins with the character. Faith's arms, legs, and torso are prominent and their visibility is used to convey movement and momentum. The character's arms pump and the length of her steps increase with her gait, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> cycle and arms flail during long jumps.|$|E

60|$|No further spur was needed. Miss Pritty {{scrambled}} {{up into the}} tree <b>and</b> crept towards <b>her</b> friend with such reckless haste {{that one of her}} feet slipped off the branch, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>leg</b> passing through the foliage, appeared in the regions below.

500|$|McConnell battled {{with health}} {{problems}} throughout her life, after contracting rheumatic fever {{at the age}} of 20 which subsequently progressed to rheumatic heart disease. In 1944 she contracted appendicitis which required an emergency appendectomy; she developed deep vein thrombosis in <b>her</b> right <b>leg</b> after the surgery <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>leg</b> was subsequently amputated above the knee. She was given a prosthetic leg which she named [...] "Matilda" [...] but later became wheelchair-bound.|$|R
60|$|Una {{suddenly}} {{thought that}} perhaps her father meant {{to tell them}} {{that he was going to}} marry Miss West. Her heart began to beat violently <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> trembled. Then she saw that Mr. Meredith looked very stern and sorrowful. No, it could not be that.|$|E
60|$|She {{was like}} a large orangutan, my mother, or like a chimpanzee, and yet, in sharp and {{definite}} ways, quite different. She was heavier of build than they, and had less hair. Her arms were not so long, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> were stouter. She wore no clothes--only her natural hair. And I can tell you she was a fury when she was excited.|$|E
60|$|But {{she seemed}} {{so young and}} so frail. She was indeed only a girl. As she stood by the fire washing herself--she was proud to wash herself at this time--and he looked at her, his heart was full of extreme {{tenderness}} for her. Such fine, fine limbs, her slim, round arms like chasing lights, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> so simple and childish, yet so very proud. Oh, she stood on proud legs, with a lovely reckless balance of her full belly, and the adorable little roundnesses, and the breasts becoming important. Above it all, her face was like a rosy cloud shining.|$|E

60|$|But Lenore heard heedlessly, {{and she ran}} on {{till she}} came to the uncut alfalfa, which impeded her progress. A {{wonderful}} space of green and purple stretched away before her, and into it she waded. It came up to her knees, rich, thick, soft, and redolent of blossom and ripeness. Hard tramping it soon got to be. She grew hot and breathless, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> ached from the force expended in making progress through the tangled hay. At last she was almost across the field, far from the cutters, and here she flung herself, to roll and lie flat and gaze up through the deep azure of sky, wonderingly, as if to penetrate its secret. And then she hid her face in the fragrant thickness that seemed to force a whisper from her.|$|E

50|$|At {{the start}} of the 1994 season she was runner-up at the Chiba Inter{{national}} Cross Country <b>and</b> won <b>her</b> <b>leg</b> of the Yokohama International Women's Ekiden. She won the only global medal of her career at the 1994 IAAF World Cup that September, taking the 10,000 m bronze behind Elana Meyer and Fernanda Ribeiro. In 1995 she came third in the 10,000 m at the national championships and came in second place at the Sanyo Women's Road Race <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>leg</b> of the Chiba International Ekiden. After taking second in the 5000 m and fourth in the 10,000 m at the 1996 Chinese Championships, she was selected for China at the 1996 Summer Olympics. Her compatriot Wang Junxia {{went on to win the}} title but Wei failed to reach the final round.|$|R

5000|$|The pose of Danaë remains {{unchanged}} in {{the various}} versions.

Kenneth Clark sees as Titian adopting the conventions for the nude prevailing outside Venice; [...] "in the rest of Italy bodies of an entirely different shape had long been fashionable".|$|E
5000|$|In some twists, {{the lady}} {{performs}} a split before rotating. This is credited as a difficult feature if each leg is [...] "at least 45° {{from the body}} axis <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>legs</b> are straight or almost straight." [...] Other variations which may increase the score include steps or other skating moves going into the twist, delayed rotation, or the lady holding {{her arms over her}} head.|$|E
