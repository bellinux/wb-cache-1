500|$|NMEs Louis Pattison {{described}} the track as a [...] "curdled take on silky ’70s rare groove legend Roy Ayers" [...] {{and stated that}} it was [...] "actually rather gorgeous". Tiny Mix Tapes commented however that Tyler's [...] "flow is painful to listen to on slower tracks such as [...] "She" [...] though [...] was saved by his ambition [...] production". Max Feldman of PopMatters noted that Tyler [...] "also does <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> {{through the medium of}} his own genitals, as evidenced on lusty R crooner [...] "She" [...] where he lets his perverse side free." ...|$|E
500|$|Nolan has {{described}} his filmmaking {{process as a}} combination of intuition and geometry. [...] "I draw a lot of diagrams when I work. I do <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> about etchings by Escher, for instance. That frees me, finding a mathematical model or a scientific model. I'll draw pictures and diagrams that illustrate the movement or the rhythm that I'm after." [...] Caltech physicist and Nobel Laureate Kip Thorne compared Nolan's [...] "deep" [...] intuition to scientists such as Albert Einstein, noting that the director intuitively grasped things non-scientists rarely understand. Upon his own decision-making {{of whether or not}} to start work on a project, the filmmaker has proclaimed a belief in the sincerity of his passion for something within the particular project in question as a basis for his selective thought.|$|E
5000|$|Pre-occupation. Do {{you spend}} <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> time <b>thinking</b> about games {{even when you}} are not playing, or {{planning}} when you can play next? ...|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: In an interview, Osborne {{noted that}} Cartoon Network {{provided}} the writers with [...] "an opportunity to spend <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> time <b>thinking</b> about the finale." ...|$|R

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Digital Spy, Gray said of her character's persona: I never {{wanted her to be}} boring. She was never boring before–she started out kind of boring, but I think that's the kiss of death because people will expect her to be interesting. By interesting, that doesn't mean she's drunk. I had to do <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> about what we would do with her. Where would she be now? I did a lot of homework finding out where she would be and what Texas women are like now. What has she gone through in her life? What has she come to grips with? What does she like about herself? What doesn't she like about herself? What kind of impact is she going to make on her life, on John Ross's life, on her future? Who is she? ...|$|E
500|$|Kneale {{also sought}} to make [...] "a comment on {{television}} {{and the idea of}} the passive audience", depicting a world where the media is controlled by an elite who feed the population with a diet of low-quality programmes and echoing the Orwellian concept of language reduction, where vocabulary has been eroded through exposure to advertising slogans, mediaspeak and predominantly visual media. He later recalled, [...] "I thought people in those conditions would have very, very, reduced language—they wouldn't be really a verbal society any more, and I think we're heading towards that. Television is mainly responsible for it, the fact that people are now conditioned to image. The pictures they see on television screens more and more dominate their thinking, as far as people do <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking,</b> and if you had a verbally reduced society, you would get the kind of language—possibly—that you did get in the play".|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, see here, old man," [...] Ross retorted, sharply, [...] "you {{want to do}} <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> {{before you}} comment on Miss Wetherford. I won't stand for any nasty clack." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The trouble is," [...] {{continued}} Billie, [...] "one {{does things}} and doesn't know how {{one is going}} to feel about it afterwards. You can do <b>an</b> awful <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> afterwards, father." ...|$|R

500|$|Writing {{retrospectively}} {{the amount}} of research put into the show, Black stated that he [...] "didn't spend <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> time <b>thinking</b> about it", {{as it would have}} spoiled [...] "some of the stupidity", joking that [...] "I'm nothing if not stupid".|$|R
6000|$|... "This matter needs <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> out, and {{it looks}} as if our lives {{depended}} on our thinking right. Allinson's instructions to the hog seem to have been pretty clear, and he wouldn't plant the cache too far from the gap. Then he'd have to arrange things so the boys would think they'd dumped the truck in a handy place for a party coming down from the north." ...|$|E
60|$|Paddy the Beaver {{was hard}} at work. He had just cut down a good- sized aspen tree {{and now he}} was gnawing it into short lengths to put in his food pile in the pond. As he worked, Paddy was doing <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> about the {{footprint}} of Old Man Coyote in a little patch of mud, for he knew that meant that Old Man Coyote had discovered his pond, and would be hanging around, hoping to catch Paddy off his guard. Paddy knew it just as well as if Old Man Coyote had told him so. That was why he was at work cutting his food supply in the daytime. Usually he works at night, and he knew that Old Man Coyote knew it.|$|E
60|$|Unc' Billy Possum did <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking.</b> He was a {{prisoner}}, {{just as much}} {{a prisoner}} {{as if he were}} in a cage. Now Unc' Billy Possum wouldn't have minded being a prisoner in the hen-house but for two things; he was dreadfully afraid that his old friend and partner, Jimmy Skunk, would get hungry for eggs and would get caught in the traps, and he was still more afraid that Farmer Brown's boy would think to put his hand down under the hay in the last nest of the top row in the darkest corner. So Unc' Billy {{spent most of his time}} studying and thinking of some way to get out, and if he couldn't do that, of some way to warn Jimmy Skunk to keep away from Farmer Brown's hen-house.|$|E
5000|$|Roger Ebert {{awarded the}} film 3 stars out of 4, noting that [...] "Equilibrium {{would be a}} mindless action picture, except {{that it has a}} mind. It doesn't do <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> deep <b>thinking,</b> but unlike many futuristic combos of sf and f/x, it does make a statement." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "There's not <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> deep <b>thinking</b> at this resort, {{just enough}} hanky panky {{to keep things}} from getting too slow. The danger {{of this type of}} drama is if you have to turn off your brain to watch it, you have to {{remember}} to turn it back on when it's over." [...] - The Salt Lake Tribune ...|$|R
5000|$|One World or None was {{critically}} {{reviewed in}} the New York Herald Tribune Book Review, March 17, 1946: [...] "An illuminating, powerful, threatening and hopeful statement which will clarify <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> confused <b>thinking</b> about atomic energy.” The original edition sold 100,000 copies. Quickly {{rising to the}} top of The New York Times bestsellers' list, the book spawned the short film of the same name.|$|R
60|$|I met {{his eyes}} {{squarely}} with mine and held them, which {{was perhaps the}} most sensible thing I could have done; though it was all unconscious on my part. In the brief moment that followed I did <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking.</b> There was no escape, up or down; I must go on or turn back. If I jumped forward with a yell, as I had done before under different circumstances, would he not rush at me savagely, as all wild creatures do when cornered? No, the time for that had passed with the first instant of our meeting. The bluff would now be too apparent; it must be done without hesitation, or not at all. On the other hand, if I turned back he would follow me {{to the end of the}} ledge, growing bolder as he came on; and beyond that it was dangerous walking, where he had all the advantage and all the knowledge of his ground. Besides, it was late, and I wanted a salmon for my supper.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I don't think that. Whether {{this man}} would have shrunk from it {{if there were no}} other way, I need not ask myself; but there could have been no {{occasion}} for it. Walter is so young that he will very soon forget the past; he might be handed over to a gypsy and grow up a little vagrant, and as there is no mark on him by which he might be identified, he would be lost to us forever. You see the man can afford to wait. He has doubtless means of his own--how large I do not know, but I have heard my uncle say that he had handsome chambers, and certainly he lived in good style. Now he will have this legacy of ten thousand pounds, and if the court keeps him waiting ten or fifteen years before pronouncing Walter dead, he can afford to wait. Anyhow, I shall have plenty of time in which to act, and it will require <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> over before I decide what I had best do." ...|$|E
5000|$|It was in {{this game}} that Kennedy made his famous [...] "Don't think, do" [...] speech. As he recalled, [...] "It {{was born out of}} desperation. We had some {{academics}} in the team who did <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking,</b> so I, more or less in exasperation, said 'Don't think, do!" ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{a speech}} on January 25, 2006, Bush said, [...] "I have the authority, both from the Constitution and the Congress, to {{undertake}} this vital program," [...] telling the House Republican Caucus at their February 10 conference in Maryland that [...] "I wake up every morning thinking about a future attack, and therefore, <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> my <b>thinking,</b> and <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> the decisions I make are based upon the attack that hurt us." ...|$|R
5000|$|Having {{worked as}} a {{personal}} trainer, Fischer-Rasmussen quit her job in 2011 so she could box full-time, saying [...] "When the sport was announced as being on the Olympic program I decided to really focus on it." [...] With Australia's other female boxer having been disqualified from the 2012 Summer Olympics because she consumed a banned substance, Fischer-Rasmussen spends <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> time <b>thinking</b> about what she eats to prevent a similar fate.|$|R
5000|$|Aside {{from the}} Frank King and Harold Gray {{influence}} on the drawing style, Brown had read the lengthy Chinese novel Dream of the Red Chamber when he started planning out Underwater, which [...] "guided <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> his <b>thinking</b> in regards to Underwater, especially the interplay between the dream world and the [...] "real" [...] world." [...] He also says Robert Bresson's [...] "restrained approach" [...] to film left an impression {{that can be seen}} on Underwater.|$|R
5000|$|Alexander Dubyanskiy, veteran Tamil scholar from Moscow State University stated “I am {{sure that}} Tolkappiyam is a work which demanded not only vast {{knowledge}} and <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> but a considerable creative skill from its composer.” Dr. Dubyanskiy {{also said that the}} authority of the text was undeniable. “It is a literary and cultural monument of great importance.” ...|$|E
5000|$|Before the 2012 Ryder Cup, Europe players Lee Westwood and Sergio García criticised the course, {{particularly}} for {{its lack of}} rough, trees and other hazards. García said: [...] "There's not <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> when {{you get on the}} tee. You can pretty much hit it nice and hard and, even if you miss, pretty much every time you'll have a shot." ...|$|E
50|$|Seeing all this, Leopold Brandmeyer {{decides that}} he has had enough and quits his job. Josepha has also done <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> in the meantime, reconsiders her head waiter's {{proposal}} of marriage, and can persuade him to stay - not just as an employee but also as boss. Love gets its way with the other two couples as well, and the play ends with the prospect of a triple marriage.|$|E
25|$|Narcissistic {{personality}} disorder (NPD) is a {{personality disorder}} {{in which there}} is a long-term pattern of abnormal behavior characterized by exaggerated feelings of self-importance, an excessive need for admiration, and a lack of understanding of others' feelings. People affected by it often spend <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> time <b>thinking</b> about achieving power or success, or about their appearance. They often take advantage of the people around them. The behavior typically begins by early adulthood, and occurs across a variety of situations.|$|R
60|$|Reddy Fox watched Blacky the Crow grow {{smaller and}} smaller until {{he was just a}} black speck in the distance. Finally he disappeared. Reddy looked very thoughtful. He looked that way because he was thoughtful. In fact, Reddy was doing <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> hard <b>{{thinking}}.</b> He was thinking about those chickens Blacky had told him of. The more he thought of them, the hungrier he grew. You see, Reddy had been having rather a hard time to get enough to eat.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I had sense {{enough to}} know that we hadn't a single second to spare in that neighborhood, and {{it was up to me}} to save the family, or go down into the stew with them. I don't like to boast, as do the Squirrels; but yet I must say that, except when we come face to face with Mr. Weasel, we Rabbits can do <b>a</b> {{powerful}} <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> in <b>a</b> short time when we are in a hole--or, perhaps I should say, when we want to get into our own particular hole.|$|R
50|$|Around 15 years old, Manolo {{has passed}} {{all of his}} exams, which leaves him free for the Christmas holidays. However, this gives him <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> time, and he finds himself {{increasingly}} uncomfortable with and detached from the society around him. Of particular interest in this story are his attitudes towards women, as he takes solitary walks and sees how women are treated in a machista society, and feels his impotence to protect them.|$|E

5000|$|... "I've {{already done}} <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> {{about this whole}} racial {{situation}} in our country. As {{a member of the}} Senate Military Affairs Committee, I got to know a lot about our casualties during the war. Plenty of Negro boys were willing to go out and fight and die for this country. Is it right when they came back to tell them they can't play the national pastime? You know, Branch, I'm going to have to meet my Maker some day. And if He asks me why I didn't let this boy play, and I say it's because he's black, that might not be a satisfactory answer.|$|E
3000|$|... [...] "impulsivity – reflectivity" [...] is {{measured}} by the method of J. Kagan. According to this method a test subject compares the contour image of the object with several similar images and finds the identical to the pattern image. Response time {{is measured}} and the number of the wrong decisions is counted during the test. A subject, who completed the task with a few mistakes, but spent <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> time <b>thinking</b> about the answers, belongs to the category of reflexive subjects. The opposite combination of signs is an indicator of impulsivity.|$|R
5000|$|Wilder Graves Penfield [...] (January 26, 1891April 5, 1976) was an American-Canadian {{pioneering}} neurosurgeon once dubbed [...] "the greatest living Canadian." [...] He expanded brain surgery's {{methods and}} techniques, including mapping {{the functions of}} various regions of the brain such as the cortical homunculus. His scientific contributions on neural stimulation expand {{across a variety of}} topics including hallucinations, illusions, and déjà vu. Penfield devoted <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> his <b>thinking</b> to mental processes, including contemplation of whether there was any scientific basis for the existence of the human soul.|$|R
60|$|Reddy {{began to}} feel afraid of that old stump. People usually are afraid of mysterious things, and it {{certainly}} was very mysterious that a fat hen with a broken neck should disappear without leaving any trace at all. Reddy sat down at a little distance and did <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> hard <b>thinking.</b> He looked every which way even up in the tree tops, but all his looking was in vain. It was so mysterious that if he hadn't known positively that he was awake he {{would have thought it}} was all a dream.|$|R
