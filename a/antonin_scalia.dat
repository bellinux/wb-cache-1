5|$|Justice <b>Antonin</b> <b>Scalia</b> {{was present}} during oral arguments. He {{passed away in}} February, voiding his vote in the initial vote on the case's outcome and precluding any draft opinion he may have written from being {{published}} by the Court. The Court's 6-2 opinion was delivered on April 20, 2016.|$|E
5|$|Tara K. Allen, {{arguing for}} Alvarado, {{claimed that the}} state court's {{decision}} was objectively unreasonable {{because they did not}} consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding the investigation as required by Thompson v. Keohane. Specifically, the considered circumstances of custody were not total because Alvarado's age was not considered. Associate Justice <b>Antonin</b> <b>Scalia</b> responded by saying that, according to Thompson v. Keohane, custody is an objective test and subjective factors like characteristics of the individual do not matter.|$|E
50|$|Rep. Hoekstra has cited <b>Antonin</b> <b>Scalia's</b> {{dissenting opinion}} in Troxel v. Granville, where {{he argued that}} the Constitution did not confer upon judges the power to {{recognize}} parental rights not explicitly enumerated, as a motivation for the Amendment.|$|R

50|$|Debates between judges. These debates, as well, {{will often}} occur {{face to face}} during {{judicial}} conferences, but they find their most prominent voice in written opinions. Splintered U.S. Supreme Court decisions present a prominent example. <b>Antonin</b> <b>Scalia's</b> dissents with the majority epitomize the nature of judicial legal debate—a debate that often centers around the proper means of interpreting federal statutes or the Constitution.|$|R
5|$|Prior to the 20th century, a few Roman Catholics were appointed, but {{concerns}} about {{diversity of the}} Court were mainly in terms of geographic diversity, to represent all geographic regions of the country, as opposed to ethnic, religious, or gender diversity. The 20th century saw the first appointment of justices who were Jewish (Louis Brandeis, 1916), African-American (Thurgood Marshall, 1967), female (Sandra Day O'Connor, 1981), and Italian-American (<b>Antonin</b> <b>Scalia,</b> 1986). The 21st century saw the first appointment of a Hispanic justice (Sonia Sotomayor, 2009), if justice Benjamin Cardozo, who was a Sephardi Jew of Portuguese descent and appointed in 1932, is excluded.|$|E
5|$|During oral argument, Justice <b>Antonin</b> <b>Scalia</b> {{responded to}} this by {{suggesting}} that some interests a person might express, such as recreational drugs, signified a willingness to violate social norms {{regardless of whether the}} conduct was illegal or not. Paul Larkin, who appeared for the government, had to admit to that there was no case law on entrapment where something that had previously been permitted was now prohibited. At one point, trying to argue that Jacobson did not have access to the defense of entrapment by estoppel (where the government persuades an actor that it is legal to do something, only to prosecute them for it), Scalia told Larkin he'd lost him.|$|E
5|$|On February 20, 2010, Noriega's lawyers filed a {{petition}} with the Supreme Court of the United States to block his extradition to France, after the court refused {{to hear his}} appeal the previous month. Noriega's attorneys had hoped the dissenting opinion in that ruling, written by Justices Clarence Thomas and <b>Antonin</b> <b>Scalia,</b> would convince the full court to take up his case, but on March 22, 2010, the Supreme Court refused to hear the petition. Two days after the refusal, the District Court for the Southern District of Florida in Miami lifted the stay that was blocking Noriega's extradition. Later that month Noriega's attorney stated that he would travel to France and try to arrange {{a deal with the}} French government.|$|E

5|$|In May 2009, President Barack Obama {{nominated}} a Catholic woman, Sonia Sotomayor, {{to replace}} retiring Justice David Souter. Her confirmation raised {{the number of}} Catholics on the Court to six, compared to three non-Catholics (all Jewish). With <b>Antonin</b> <b>Scalia's</b> death in February 2016, the number of Catholic Justices went back to five. Neil Gorsuch, appointed in 2017, was raised Catholic but attends an Episcopalian church; it is unclear if he considers himself a Catholic or a Protestant.|$|R
40|$|This report {{discusses}} Justice <b>Antonin</b> <b>Scalia's</b> last opinion for {{the court}} (Kansas v. Carr). There, the Court reversed two decisions of the Kansas Supreme Court and held that "the Eighth Amendment [does not] require [...] . capital-sentencing courts to instruct the jury that mitigating circumstances need not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. " It also held that the Eighth Amendment did not require separate trials {{for two of the}} defendants in one of the Kansas cases...|$|R
5|$|The {{case was}} argued {{before the court}} on March 28, 2006. Katyal argued on behalf of Hamdan, and Paul Clement, the Solicitor General of the United States, argued {{on behalf of the}} government. Chief Justice Roberts recused himself because he had {{previously}} ruled on this case as part of the three judge panel on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Critics called for Justice <b>Antonin</b> <b>Scalia</b> to recuse himself, since he had made allegedly improper comments about the decision of the case prior to hearing oral arguments ("I'm not about to give this man who was captured in a war a full jury trial. I mean it's crazy") but he chose not to do so.|$|E
5|$|During his 1980 campaign, Reagan pledged that, {{if given}} the {{opportunity}}, he would appoint the first female Supreme Court Justice. That opportunity came {{in his first year}} in office when he nominated Sandra Day O'Connor to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of Justice Potter Stewart. In his second term, Reagan elevated William Rehnquist to succeed Warren E. Burger as Chief Justice, and named <b>Antonin</b> <b>Scalia</b> to fill the vacant seat. Reagan nominated conservative jurist Robert Bork to the high court in 1987. Senator Ted Kennedy, a Democrat of Massachusetts, strongly condemned Bork, and great controversy ensued. Bork's nomination was rejected 58–42. Reagan then nominated Douglas Ginsburg, but Ginsburg withdrew his name from consideration after coming under fire for his cannabis use. Anthony Kennedy was eventually confirmed in his place. Along with his three Supreme Court appointments, Reagan appointed 83 judges to the United States courts of appeals, and 290 judges to the United States district courts.|$|E
5|$|Justice David Souter wrote a dissenting opinion, {{which was}} joined by Justice <b>Antonin</b> <b>Scalia.</b> Souter {{referenced}} prior cases dealing with sovereignty and jurisdiction, from the decision made in United States v. Kagama, to the opinion made in South Dakota v. Bourland. Souter stated that the decision in this case did not align with precedent established in previous cases. Since Duro held that the tribes had lost their inherent sovereignty, {{the only way for}} the tribes to regain jurisdiction over non-member Indians would be by the delegation of that jurisdiction by Congress. Bourland was even more specific as to that point. Souter believed that the only two ways that the tribes could regain their sovereignty would be for Congress to declare that they were independent of the United States, as it did with the Philippines, or for the Court to overturn the concept of a dependent domestic sovereign.|$|E

5000|$|Jesinoski v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., , was a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court held that the Truth in Lending Act does not require borrowers to file a lawsuit to rescind loans and that sending written notice is {{sufficient}} to effectuate rescission. Some commentators described Justice <b>Antonin</b> <b>Scalia's</b> unanimous majority opinion as [...] "terse" [...] and the [...] "shortest opinion of the year". Other analysts have described Jesinoski as a [...] "landmark case" [...] in Truth in Lending Act jurisprudence.|$|R
5000|$|Oral {{arguments}} were heard on March 23, 2016. Issues discussed included {{how and where}} {{to draw the line}} between exempt churches and other religious non-profits and whether the government was [...] "hijacking" [...] the insurance plans created by the non-profits to achieve the government's goals. Because of Justice <b>Antonin</b> <b>Scalia's</b> death in February, only eight justices heard the arguments, raising the possibility of an equally divided court, which would leave the appeals court rulings in force in their respective jurisdictions.|$|R

5000|$|Volokh's {{article about}} [...] "The Commonplace Second Amendment", was cited by Supreme Court Justice <b>Antonin</b> <b>Scalia's</b> {{majority}} {{opinion in the}} landmark Second Amendment case of District of Columbia v. Heller. Volokh advocates campus speech rights, religious freedom, and other First Amendment issues. He opposes affirmative action, having worked as a legal advisor to California's Proposition 209 campaign. Volokh is a critic of {{what he sees as}} the overly broad operation of American workplace harassment laws, including those relating to sexual harassment.|$|R
5000|$|Trump, for example, {{promoted}} the discredited belief that vaccines can cause autism unless administered {{according to a}} lengthened schedule. He also alluded to the unfounded notion that President Obama is secretly a Muslim, for example stating that Obama might have attended a particular funeral [...] "if it were held in a Mosque" [...] and saying that [...] "some people" [...] think a Muslim already had been elected president. Trump also speculated that Supreme Court Justice <b>Antonin</b> <b>Scalia's</b> death by natural causes, was in truth caused by murder.|$|R
5000|$|Justice <b>Antonin</b> <b>Scalia's</b> {{majority}} opinion, The People are {{the fourth}} branch via grand juries https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/90-1972.ZS.html. The {{grand jury is}} mentioned in the Bill of Rights, {{but not in the}} body of the Constitution. It has not been textually assigned, therefore, to any of the branches described in the first three Articles”. It [...] "is a constitutional fixture in its own right". In fact the whole theory of its function is that it belongs to no branch of the institutional government, serving as a kind of buffer or referee between the Government and the people (United States v. Williams, 1992).|$|R
25|$|Justice <b>Antonin</b> <b>Scalia</b> reiterated {{his view}} that {{substantive}} reasonableness review was {{incompatible with the}} Sixth Amendment, but concurred out of concerns for stare decisis.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to this, a different strain of originalism, articulated by (among others) <b>Antonin</b> <b>Scalia,</b> Robert Bork, and Randy Barnett, {{came to the}} fore. This is dubbed original meaning.|$|E
25|$|Justice <b>Antonin</b> <b>Scalia's</b> dissent, {{joined by}} Justice John Paul Stevens, went the furthest in restricting the {{executive}} power of detention. Scalia asserted {{that based on}} historical precedent, the government had only two options to detain Hamdi: either Congress must suspend the right to habeas corpus, or Hamdi must be tried under normal criminal law. Scalia wrote that the plurality, though well-meaning, had no basis in law for trying to establish new procedures that would be applicable in a challenge to Hamdi's detention - {{it was only the}} job of the Court to declare it unconstitutional and order his release or proper arrest, rather than to invent an acceptable process for detention.|$|R
50|$|Roberts {{has been}} {{compared}} and contrasted to other court members by commentators. Although Roberts is identified as having a conservative judicial philosophy, his vote in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius to uphold the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) caused the press to contrast him with the Rehnquist court. Roberts is seen as having a more moderate conservative orientation, particularly when Bush v. Gore is compared to Roberts' vote for the ACA. Roberts' judicial philosophy is seen as more moderate and conciliatory than <b>Antonin</b> <b>Scalia's</b> and Clarence Thomas'. He wishes more consensus from the Court. Roberts' voting pattern is most closely aligned to Samuel Alito's.|$|R
5000|$|A 2016 paper {{written by}} Jeremy Kidd of the Mercer University Walter F. George School of Law and others {{attempted}} {{to measure the}} [...] "Scalia-ness" [...] of various potential nominees to the Supreme Court to fill the seat left vacant by Justice <b>Antonin</b> <b>Scalia's</b> death. The study created a [...] "Scalia Index Score" [...] combining the various measures of [...] "Scalia-ness," [...] and Lee scored highest. The study found that Lee was {{the most likely to}} endorse or engage in originalism in judicial opinions, was second most likely to cite Scalia's non-judicial writings in opinions, and the third most likely to write separately when not writing the majority opinion.|$|R
