2500|$|Born on Rottnest Island, Back {{played for}} Fremantle in the WACA grade cricket competition, {{and led the}} league's batting averages during the 1887–88 season, scoring 267 runs from ten innings {{at an average of}} 53.50. His only state-level matches played during Western Australia's tour of the eastern colonies in early 1893. He opened the batting for the side in both of its two {{first-class}} matches on the tour, against South Australia and Victoria, variously partnering with Percival Hussey, Harry Bennett, and Ernest Randell. In the first match, Back scored four and seven runs, and in the second match, a duck and one run, with Western Australia following on in both matches. He also played in two other matches on tour, against the Melbourne Cricket Club and a [...] "juniors" [...] representative team from Victoria. Little else is known of his life. Having apparently worked as <b>a</b> <b>forwarding</b> <b>agent</b> on the Fremantle wharves, Back died in Fremantle on 15 February 1911, and was buried in the Anglican section of Fremantle Cemetery the following day. He {{had been a member of}} a local fraternal organisation, the Oddfellows, before his death, as well as a founding member of the Fremantle District Cricket Club, who wore black armbands in their next match.|$|E
2500|$|The {{principal}} transfer {{points for}} mail arriving from or destined to Europe and other locations were Nassau in the Bahamas, Bermuda, and Cuba. Ships carrying letters that were addressed to {{points in the}} Confederacy would deposit their cargo of mail {{at one of these}} transfer points. Here the inbound mail was handled by <b>a</b> <b>forwarding</b> <b>agent</b> who would remove the mail or inner cover and prepare it for transfer on a blockade runner. [...] Often the forwarding agents would apply their own markings to the cover of mail. Mail placed aboard a blockade runner would then, perhaps with some luck, make its way to the ports of New Orleans, Charleston or Wilmington, where it was received by Confederate postal operators who would then include it in with the regular Confederate mail for delivery. [...] The captain of the blockade runner would typically get two cents for every letter he delivered to port, which was a nominal sum, as his main source of revenue was from delivering his cargo. The average number of successful runs by a blockade runner was only about four, many of them meeting a fateful ending on their first run. Various ports along the coastline of the Confederacy saw the most traffic from blockade runners. Charleston in South Carolina was particularly well situated as a port for blockade runners with their shallow drafts, as was the Port in Wilmington in North Carolina which saw the most traffic. Because the lower Mississippi River was being blockaded effectively dividing the Western Confederate states from those east, New Orleans became one of the busiest of ports. Consequently, many blockade covers have postmarks from these locations.|$|E

An exemption clause in the contract for the car provided that the implied conditions about fitness for purpose were excluded. R&B argued that this was contrary to UCTA 1977 section 6, and United Dominions contended that R&B could not avail themselves of the Act because as a business they could not count as a consumer.|$|R
40|$|Real time {{multicast}} {{applications in}} mobile adhoc network brings forward added advantages in wireless network. The fragile and mobile environment of adhoc network produces {{the need of}} bandwidth allocation for real time applications. Reliability {{is also an important}} factor in multicasting in mobile adhoc networks (MANETs), as it confirms eventual delivery of all the data to all the group members, without enforcing any particular delivery order in EEMCCP. In the first phase of this paper, we design an "ant agent-resource allocation‟ technique for reserving bandwidth for real-time multicast applications. In the forward phase, the source sends <b>a</b> <b>forward</b> ant <b>agent</b> which collects the bandwidth information of intermediate nodes and reserves a bandwidth for real-time flow for each multicast receiver. In the backward phase, the backward ant confirms the allocation and feeds the bandwidth information to the source...|$|R

40|$|In today’s {{world of}} {{telecommunications}} {{there is an}} increasing problem with reaching people one wishes to speak to.

40|$|V diplomski nalogi z naslovom Špediter v vlogi managerja v mednarodnem poslovanju sem s pomočjo domačih in tujih virov raziskoval področje špedicije in {{management}}a v širšem smislu. To temo sem si izbral, ker imamo doma podjetje in velik del naših proizvodov tudi izvažamo. Zato se velikokrat zatečemo k špediciji, ki nas velikokrat razočara, saj mnogokrat ne vemo, kje se blago med potjo nahaja, velikokrat pa tudi pride do poškodb blaga. Namen diplomskega dela je bil približati ali olajšati delo tistim podjetjem, ki so v fazi ustanovitve in še nimajo dovolj znanja, kako naj bi izdelek iz njihovih rok prišel v tuje, brez večjih stroškov in katera zanimajo predvsem razmere v mednarodnem poslovanju. V diplomskem delu sem najprej predstavil teoretična izhodišča o vlogi in pomenu mednarodne špedicije (vlogo špediterja ter managerja, osnovne špediterske storitve, prednosti, zavarovanje blaga), management mednarodnega poslovanja (primerjavo Slovenije z mednarodnim poslovanjem, vrsto sodobnih podjetij in nagibe), managerske strategije za vstop na tuje trge, management v povezavi s špediterstvom ter nazadnje vlogo managerjev. Špediter se lahko pojavlja v različnih vlogah, jaz sem navedel tri: -	špediter v vlogi ustvarjalnega managerja, -	špediter v vlogi managerja inovatorja, -	špediter v vlogi managerja razvijalca. Za uspešno organizacijo mora špediter nastopati v vseh treh vlogah. Najprej mora raziskati področje strategije, poiskati neko novost na tem področju in nato to novost nadaljnje razvijati. Tako po postal konkurenčen in si na trgu ustvaril neko »ime«, za katero bodo vsi vedeli, da je vredno zaupanja. The {{theme of}} my paper {{is the work}} of <b>a</b> <b>forwarding</b> <b>agent,</b> performing the role of a manager in international operations. In order to get a deeper insight into forwarding and management in a broader sense I used the Slovene, as well as foreing resources. I have chosen the this subject as we have a company at home. As most of our products are exported we are often forced to use the services of forwarding. These services are often below our expectations, for example, in some cases we often do not know where the good are during the transport, in addition, the goods are often damaged when they reach the their destination. The main purpose of my paper is to help those companies which have been founded recetnly, so as to make their work easier. These companies do not have the knowledge of how to get the product to its buyer without too many expanses. Such companies are interested in international operations as well. The first part of my paper deals with the role and the importance of international forwarding from the theoretical point of view (the role of <b>a</b> <b>forwarding</b> <b>agent</b> and a manager, basic forwarding services, the advantages of having the good insured, a forwarding condtract), the management of international operations (Slovenia in comparison to interantional operations), management strategies to eneter foreign markets, management and its links to forwarding and the role of managers. The roles of <b>a</b> <b>forwarding</b> <b>agent</b> are many, I have chosen to present the followin ones: - <b>a</b> <b>forwarding</b> <b>agent</b> in the role of a creative manager, - a forwarding managers {{in the role of the}} innovator, - a forwarding manager in the role of developer(promoter). <b>A</b> <b>forwarding</b> <b>agent</b> needs to be good in all these roles in order to maintain a successful organisation. First of all, he needs to research new strategies and find something new in this field, afterwards he has to develop a new approach. It is only in this way that he can become cometitive. That is how he can build his reputation and trust in the market...|$|E
