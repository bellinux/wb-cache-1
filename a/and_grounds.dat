40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} the experimental results of grinding chatter <b>and</b> <b>ground</b> surface waviness on the precise surface grinding machine. Based on a dynamic model of surface grinding processes, the generation {{and development of}} surface grinding chatter are analyzed. The influences on grinding chatter <b>and</b> <b>ground</b> surface waviness under the diverse grinding conditions are investigated. The relationship between grinding chatter <b>and</b> <b>ground</b> surface waviness is presented. The results show that cutting depth is the leading factor in grinding chatter <b>and</b> <b>ground</b> surface waviness in surface grinding process...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Higher {{operating}} {{frequencies and}} greater power demands {{have increased the}} requirements on the power <b>and</b> <b>ground</b> network. Simultaneously, due to the larger current loads, current densities are increasing, making electromigration an important design issue. The optimal wire width for an interdigitated power <b>and</b> <b>ground</b> network {{is based on the}} resistive and inductive (both self- and mutual) impedance. In this paper, a methodology for optimizing a multi-layer interdigitated power <b>and</b> <b>ground</b> network is presented, reducing the current density and impedance of a network. Based on 65 nm, 45 nm, and 32 nm CMOS technologies, the optimal width as a function of metal layer is determined for different frequencies, suggesting important trends for interdigitated power <b>and</b> <b>ground</b> networks.
