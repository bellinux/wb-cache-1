5|$|Amid rising {{concerns}} over {{the threat of a}} French invasion, Sir Thomas Page surveyed the blockhouse in 1778 and concluded that its guns were too closely packed together <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not easily fire down-river, proposing that a larger fort be built along the Thames to the east to rectify this problem. New Tavern Fort was constructed shortly afterwards and the eastern Gravesend Blockhouse gun platform was redesigned and extended as part of the work. Two volunteer militia companies were established in 1794 and 1797 to support the blockhouse and in 1805 it was equipped with 19 32 lb guns.|$|E
5|$|The ancient Peruvian Moche people worshipped {{the sea and}} its animals. Their art often depicts manta rays. Historically, mantas were {{feared for}} their size and power. Sailors {{believed}} that they ate fish and could sink boats by pulling on the anchors. This attitude changed around 1978 when divers around the Gulf of California {{found them to be}} placid <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> interact with the animals. Several divers photographed themselves with mantas, including Jaws author Peter Benchley.|$|E
5|$|A re-think was required. Cook had the unenviable task of {{explaining}} {{the failure to}} the government. Henceforth, he would take a tighter grip on the hydrogen bomb programme, gradually superseding Penney. The scientists and politicians considered abandoning Green Granite. The Minister of Defence, Duncan Sandys, queried Cook on the imperative to persist with thermonuclear designs, given that Orange Herald satisfied most military requirements, and the tests were very expensive. Cook replied that megaton-range fission bombs represented an uneconomical use of expensive fissile material; {{that they could not}} be built to produce yields of more than a megaton; <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not be made small enough to be carried by aircraft smaller than the V-bombers, or on missiles. Sandys was not convinced, but he authorised further tests, as did the Prime Minister, now Harold Macmillan following Eden's resignation {{in the wake of the}} Suez crisis. The earliest possible date was November 1957 unless the Operation Antler tests were cancelled; but the Foreign Office warned that a moratorium on nuclear testing might come into effect in late October.|$|E

5|$|Although the British were victorious {{over the}} French in the war, King George III's {{government}} {{felt that the}} North American colonies were not paying their way, since little direct tax revenue from the colonies was received. The Sugar Act of 1764 had its greatest effect in New England and did not cause widespread objection. The Stamp Act the following year affected all 13 colonies, as it required revenue stamps to be used on papers required in trade and in the law. When word of passage of the Stamp Act reached Williamsburg, the House of Burgesses passed the Virginia Resolves, asserting that Virginians had {{the same rights as}} if they resided in Britain, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> only be taxed by themselves or their elected representatives. The Resolves were mostly written by a fiery-spoken new member for Louisa County, Patrick Henry.|$|E
5|$|Augustus' brother, Otto, {{devised the}} scheme to corner United Copper, {{believing that the}} Heinze family already {{controlled}} {{a majority of the}} company. He also believed that a significant number of the Heinze's shares had been borrowed, and sold short, by speculators betting that the stock price would drop, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> thus repurchase the borrowed shares cheaply, pocketing the difference. Otto proposed a short squeeze, whereby the Heinzes would aggressively purchase as many remaining shares as possible, and then force the short sellers to pay for their borrowed shares. The aggressive purchasing would drive up the share price, and, being unable to find shares elsewhere, the short sellers would have no option but to turn to the Heinzes, who could then name their price.|$|E
5|$|Lethbridge's {{next book}} was ESP – Beyond Time and Distance, {{published}} in 1965. It {{dealt with the}} theme of extra-sensory perception and articulated Lethbridge's argument that rays of energy were transmitted from every object, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be detected using pendulum dowsing. In 1966 he published A Step in the Dark, which repeated many of his theories regarding pendulum dowsing present in earlier works. Early that year, Lethbridge first began struggling against heart disease, an affliction that had resulted from his obesity. In both his books and private letters from this period he regularly ranted against modern life and society, while in other correspondences with individuals in the United States he championed {{the authenticity of the}} Kensington Runestone and Westford Knight.|$|E

5|$|On the Israeli side, several {{leaders of}} the Jewish city sent {{emergency}} telegrams to David Ben-Gurion where they described the situation as desperate <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not hold out more than two weeks. Fearing that without a supply the city would collapse, Ben-Gurion ordered the taking of Latrun. This decision seemed strategically necessary but was politically delicate, because Latrun was in the area allocated to the Arab State according {{to the terms of}} the Partition Plan and this attack was contrary to the non-aggression agreements, concluded with King Abdullah This decision was also opposed by the Chief of Operations, Yigael Yadin who considered that there were other military priorities at that moment, in particular on the southern front, where the Egyptian army was threatening Tel Aviv if Yad Mordechai fell. But Ben-Gurion set Israeli military policy. This difference in strategy influenced the outcome of the battle, and has been debated in Israel for many years.|$|E

5|$|Irreducible {{complexity}} is {{the idea}} that certain biological systems cannot be broken down into their constituent parts and remain functional, <b>and</b> therefore <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not have evolved naturally from less complex or complete systems. Whereas past arguments of this nature generally relied on macroscopic organs, Behe's primary examples of irreducible complexity have been cellular and biochemical in nature. He has argued that the components of systems such as the blood clotting cascade, the immune system, and the bacterial flagellum are so complex <b>and</b> interdependent <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not have evolved from simpler systems.|$|R

25|$|A {{committee}} was established {{with representatives from}} the municipalities of Oslo, Aker, and Ekebergbanen. It saw the benefits of both lines, but recommended that the light rail be prioritized. Negotiations started between the municipalities and the company. Ekebergbanen stated {{that it was not}} possible to operate the branch line profitably, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not raise sufficient capital to build the branch. In April 1922, the three made an agreement about the branch. However, at the time the plateau was being considered as one of the possible locations for the new airport to serve Oslo, and this delayed the planning. In 1927, concession was granted by royal resolution, after it had been decided to build the new airport at Fornebu.|$|E
25|$|Word {{was sent}} around to Sikhs passing their days in distant jungles and deserts that peace {{had been made}} with the {{government}} <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> return to their homes. Nawab Kapur Singh undertook the task of consolidating the disintegrated fabric of the Sikh Jathas. They were merged into a single central fighting force (The Dal) divided into two sections - The Budha Dal, {{the army of the}} veterans, and the Taruna Dal, the army of the young, Sardar Hari Singh Dhillon was elected its leader. The former was entrusted with the task of looking after the holy places, preaching the word of the Gurus and inducting converts into the Khalsa Panth by holding baptismal ceremonies. The Taruna Dal was the more active division and its function was to fight in times of emergencies.|$|E

As soon as news of Cheoljong's death reached Yi Ha-eung through his intricate network of spies in the palace, he and the Pungyang Jo clan took the hereditary royal seal (considered necessary for a legitimate reign to take place and aristocratic recognition to be received), effectively giving Queen Sinjeong absolute power to select the successor to the throne. By the time Cheoljong's death became a known fact, the Andong Kim clan was powerless to act according to law because the seal already lay in the hands of Grand Royal Dowager Queen Sinjeong.|$|E

25|$|Around the {{beginning}} of January 2013, word managed to get out that the Mumbai Tigers (then Dodsal FC) had failed to register on time for the upcoming 2013 I-League 2nd Division campaign <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> instead get direct-entry into the I-League, India's top-tier football league, through a cash payment to the All India Football Federation, the main football association for the sport in India, and a promise to create a stadium within Mumbai, Maharashtra by 2017. Later that month on 12 January {{it was announced that}} the All India Football Federation had called for an executive meeting on the 15th to discuss the proposal of handing select companies direct spots into the 2013–14 I-League.

25|$|In 2014 NASA's Eagleworks Laboratories {{announced}} that they had successfully validated {{the use of a}} Quantum Vacuum Plasma Thruster which makes use of the Casimir effect for propulsion. In 2016 a scientific paper by the team of NASA scientists passed peer review for the first time. The paper suggests that the zero-point field acts as pilot-wave and that the thrust may be due to particles pushing off the quantum vacuum. While peer review doesn’t guarantee that a finding or observation is valid, it does indicate that independent scientists looked over the experimental setup, results, and interpretation <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not find any obvious errors in the methodology and that they found the results reasonable. In the paper, the authors identify and discuss nine potential sources of experimental errors, including rogue air currents, leaky electromagnetic radiation, and magnetic interactions. Not all of them could be completely ruled out, and further peer reviewed experimentation is needed in order to rule these potential errors out.|$|E

Rowan later {{realised}} his mistake and apologised in the lunch break. Even John Snow applauded when he and Tom Brooks refused to start play at Melbourne in the abandoned Third Test. Ian Johnson and the Melbourne authorities were desperate to get the game going, but the umpires refused to be pressured as the field was quite unfit for play. Snow found Max O'Connell 'a very reasonable and fair man, even if I {{did not agree with}} him' <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> talk problems through. Brooks {{was the only one of}} the umpires who had played First Class Cricket – he had been a lively fast-medium bowler – and as a result was more able to connect with the Test players, and was more forgiving of short-pitched deliveries which he saw as a natural part of the game.|$|E

25|$|In {{the months}} prior to the July 1940 Democratic National Convention, there was much {{speculation}} as to whether Roosevelt would break with longstanding tradition and run for an unprecedented third term. The two-term tradition, although not yet enshrined in the Constitution, had been established by George Washington when he refused to run for a third term in the 1796 presidential election. Roosevelt refused to give a definitive statement as to his willingness to be a candidate again, and he even indicated to some ambitious Democrats, such as James Farley, that he would not run for a third term <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> seek the Democratic nomination. However, as Germany swept through Western Europe and menaced the Britain in mid-1940, Roosevelt decided that only he had the necessary experience and skills to see the nation safely through the Nazi threat. He was aided by the party's political bosses, who feared that no Democrat except Roosevelt could defeat Wendell Willkie, the popular Republican nominee.|$|E
25|$|In {{the year}} leading up the finals in Nigeria, several European title holders lobbied their {{governments and the}} EU {{parliament}} to support Amina Lawal's cause. A number of contestants followed the lead of Kathrine Sørland of Norway in boycotting the contest (despite the controversy Sørland {{would go on to}} become a semi-finalist in both the Miss World and Miss Universe contest), while others such as Costa Rica were instructed by their national governments and parliaments not to attend the contest. Among the other boycotting nations were Denmark, Spain, Switzerland, Panama, Belgium and Kenya. There was further controversy over the possibly suspended participation of France and South Africa, {{which may or may not}} have been due to the boycott. For her part, Lawal asked that contestants not suspend their participation in the contest, saying that it was for the good of her country <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could,</b> as the representative of Sweden had earlier remarked, make a much stronger case for her on the ground in Nigeria.|$|E

Jackson was later told by his baseball coach at Auburn that the trip was considered to be a violation of NCAA rules and that he was immediately ruled ineligible to play the remainder of the baseball season. Jackson, upset that Culverhouse lied to him, insisted that he would never play for the Buccaneers <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> draft him if he wanted to, but he would not sign if he was drafted. It was said that Jackson, who was having what he called his best year playing baseball in school, made the Buccaneers nervous and that by getting him somehow ruled ineligible to play baseball, he would be forced to focus on football.|$|E
