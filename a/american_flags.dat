5|$|A {{radical change}} of tactics, which {{involved}} {{the introduction of}} a bill to ban British subjects from aiding or participating in the slave trade to the French colonies, was suggested by maritime lawyer James Stephen. It was a shrewd move, since the majority of British ships were now flying <b>American</b> <b>flags</b> and supplying slaves to foreign colonies with whom Britain was at war. A bill was introduced and approved by the cabinet, and Wilberforce and other abolitionists maintained a self-imposed silence, so as not to draw any attention to the effect of the bill. The approach proved successful, and the new Foreign Slave Trade Bill was quickly passed, and received royal assent on 23 May 1806.|$|E
5|$|By October 1918, Austria {{prepared}} to transfer her entire fleet to Yugoslavia {{in order to}} keep it out of Italian hands. On November 10, 1918, one day before the armistice, Yugoslav officers with scratch crews sailed Radetzky and Zrínyi out of Pola. As they cleared the breakwater at Pola, they sighted the approaching Italian fleet. The two battleships hoisted <b>American</b> <b>flags</b> and sailed south along the Adriatic coast to Castelli Bay near Spolato. They appealed for American naval forces to meet them and accept their surrender, which a squadron of USN submarine chasers in the area did. However, under the subsequent peace treaty, the Allied powers ignored the transfer of the Austro-Hungarian ships to the Yugoslav navy; instead, the ships were to be ceded to Italy. Radetzky and Zrínyi were broken up in Italy between 1920–21; Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand survived until 1926, when she too was scrapped in Italy.|$|E

40|$|The most universally {{recognizable}} {{symbol of}} American government ” is the <b>American</b> <b>flag</b> (Hopkins, 1991, p. 817). The <b>American</b> <b>flag</b> {{is vital to}} our nation and to its citizens, particularly as the flag remains a major symbol during the country’s times of peace and war. This paper explores the connections between the <b>American</b> <b>flag</b> and the corporeal body. A historical review {{of the creation of}} the <b>American</b> <b>flag</b> ignites the discussion of how Americans use their physical bodies to offer meanings of the <b>American</b> <b>flag.</b> From the presented taxonomy of meanings, an interpretation of the effect of the flag on the body and the effect of the body on the flag is offered. The <b>American</b> <b>flag</b> gives meaning to the American body as a collective whole, whereas the American body’s utilization of the flag allows for individual interpretation and negotiation of the meanings assigned by the flag. A thoughtful mind when it sees a nation’s flag, sees not the flag, but the nation itself. And whatever may be its symbols, its insignia, he reads chiefly in the flag, the government, the principles, the truths, the history that belongs to the nation that sets it forth. The <b>American</b> <b>flag</b> has been a symbol of Liberty and men rejoiced in it...|$|R
5|$|During a June 2007 {{visit to}} the {{predominantly}} Muslim Albania, Bush was greeted enthusiastically. Albania {{has a population of}} 2.8million, has troops in both Iraq and Afghanistan, and the country's government is highly supportive of American foreign policy. A huge image of the President was hung {{in the middle of the}} capital city of Tirana flanked by Albanian and <b>American</b> <b>flags</b> while a local street was named after him. A shirt-sleeved statue of Bush was unveiled in Fushë-Krujë, a few kilometers northwest of Tirana. The Bush administration's support for the independence of Albanian-majority Kosovo, while endearing him to the Albanians, has troubled U.S. relations with Serbia, leading to the February 2008 torching of the U.S. embassy in Belgrade.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{military}} in Anbar Province {{had a series}} of reorganizations in late 2009 and early 2010. The last non-American foreign forces left Iraq on 31 July 2009 and Multi-National Forces West became United States Force– West. On 23 January 2010, the Marines formally left both Anbar Province and Iraq, transferring American military commitments over to the United States Army's 1st Armored Division. The Army promptly merged United States Division West with United States Division– Baghdad, creating United States Division– Center to advise Iraqi forces in both Anbar and Baghdad. In December 2010, the 25th Infantry Division assumed responsibility for Anbar Province. On 7 December, the United States transferred its last base in Anbar Province, Al Asad, to the Iraqi Government. One week later, hundreds of Fallujah residents celebrated the pullout by burning <b>American</b> <b>flags</b> in the city.|$|E
5|$|By October 1918, Austria {{prepared}} to transfer her entire fleet {{to the newly}} created State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs (later to become the Kingdom of Yugoslavia) {{in order to keep}} it out of Italian hands. On 10 November 1918, one day before the Allied Armistice with Germany, and six days after the Austrians and Italians agreed to the Armistice of Villa Giusti, Yugoslav officers with scratch crews sailed Radetzky and Zrínyi out of Pola. Once outside Pola, the ships spotted heavy units of the Italian fleet; the two battleships hoisted <b>American</b> <b>flags</b> and sailed south to escape. A squadron of US Navy submarine chasers operating off the city of Spalato accepted the surrender of Radetzky and Zrínyi. However, under the subsequent peace treaty, the Allied powers ignored the transfer of the Austro-Hungarian ships to the Yugoslav navy which had already taken place; instead, the ships were ceded to Italy. Radetzky was broken up in Italy between 1920 and 1921.|$|E

5|$|On 20 February, Kroonland, {{continuing}} to sail for the American Line, returned to New York – Liverpool service after {{an absence of}} 18 months. As a ship of the still-neutral United States sailing in a war zone, Kroonland had her name painted in large letters {{on each side of}} her hull. The name was flanked on either side by large <b>American</b> <b>flags</b> and kept illuminated at night. In June, she carried US$1,500,000 of Argentine gold from London for deposit with the Guaranty Trust Company of New York. On late 1916, a cook aboard Kroonland was arrested for smuggling feathers, wings, and heads of birds of paradise and crowned pigeons. The man, who was paid $300 for each load of feathers, smuggled in at least three loads of the avian contraband before his arrest. In January 1917, a jumble sale held in the saloon on Kroonland raised £73 15s 11d for The Times Fund, {{for the benefit of the}} British Red Cross and the Order of St. John.|$|E
5|$|After the Austro-Hungarian Empire {{collapsed}} in 1918, the Austrians {{wanted to turn}} the fleet over to the newly created State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs (later {{to become a part}} of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia) in order to prevent the Italians from claiming the ships as spoils of war. However, the victorious Allies refused to acknowledge the conversations between the Austrians and the south Slavs and, in due course, reallocated the ships. The ship had been boarded by a scratch Yugoslav crew on 10 November 1918, one day before the Armistice, and had left Pola along with her sister ship, Radetzky. They were soon spotted by heavy Italian ships, so the two battleships hoisted <b>American</b> <b>flags</b> and sailed south along the Adriatic coast to Castelli Bay near Spalato (also known as Split). They appealed for American naval forces to meet them and accept their surrender, which a squadron of United States Navy (USN) submarine chasers in the area did. She had apparently been turned over to the fledgling south Slav state, as it was a Croat naval officer, Korvettenkapitän Marijan Polić, who presented the ship as a prize of war to representatives of the United States Navy on the afternoon of 22 November 1919 at Spalato (Split) in Dalmatia. Simultaneously she was commissioned as USS Zrínyi and Lieutenant E.E. Hazlett, USN, assumed command. The initial American complement consisted of four officers and 174 enlisted men—the latter entirely composed of United States Navy Reserve Force personnel. The ship remained at anchor at Spalato for nearly a year while the negotiations that would determine her ultimate fate dragged on. Only once did she apparently turn her engines over, and that occurred during a severe gale that struck Spalato on 9 February 1920.|$|E

2500|$|The most logical {{explanation}} for {{the colors of the}} <b>American</b> <b>flag</b> is that it was modeled after the first unofficial <b>American</b> <b>flag,</b> the Grand Union Flag. In turn the Grand Union Flag was probably designed using the colors of Great Britain's Union Jack. The colors of the Great Seal are the same as the colors in the <b>American</b> <b>flag.</b> To attribute meaning to these colors, Charles Thomson, who helped design the Great Seal, reported to Congress that [...] "White signifies purity and innocence. Red hardiness and valor and Blue... signifies vigilance, perseverance and justice." ...|$|R
