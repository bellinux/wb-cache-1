5|$|The Marcellus Shale {{was formed}} {{from the very}} first {{deposits}} in a relatively deep, sediment- and oxygen-starved (<b>anoxic),</b> trough that formed parallel to the mountain chain.|$|E
5|$|Fossil {{tracks are}} rare and no burrows under the sea-floor {{have so far}} {{been found in the}} Burgess Shale. These {{absences}} have been used to support the idea that the water near the sea-floor was <b>anoxic.</b> However {{it is possible that the}} water just above the sea-floor was oxygenated while the water in the sediment below it was <b>anoxic,</b> and also possible that there simply were no deep-burrowing animals in the Burgess Shale. Some fossils, such as Marrella, are almost always the right way up, which suggests they were not transported far if at all. Others, such as Wiwaxia, are often at odd angles, and some fossils of animals with shelly or toughened components very rarely contain remains of soft tissues. This suggests that the distances over which corpses were transported may have varied between genera, although most were buried where they had lived.|$|E
5|$|Oil and gas form on {{the bottom}} of shallow seas when {{micro-organisms}} decompose under <b>anoxic</b> conditions and later become covered with sediment. Many deserts were at one time the sites of shallow seas and others have had underlying hydrocarbon deposits transported to them by the movement of tectonic plates.|$|E
5|$|These fossils {{have been}} {{preserved}} in a distinctive style known as Burgess shale type preservation, which preserves fairly tough tissues such as cuticle as thin films, and soft tissues as solid shapes, quickly enough that decay has not destroyed them. Moderately soft tissues, such as muscles, are lost. Scientists are still unsure about {{the processes that}} created these fossils. While {{there is little doubt}} that the animals were buried under catastrophic flows of sediment, it is uncertain whether they were transported by the flows from other locations, or lived in the area where they were buried, or were a mixture of local and transported specimens. This issue is closely related to whether conditions around the burial sites were <b>anoxic</b> or had a moderate supply of oxygen. <b>Anoxic</b> conditions are generally thought the most favourable for fossilization, but imply that the animals could not have lived where they were buried.|$|E
5|$|The oceans {{may have}} become more hospitable to life over the last 500million years and less {{vulnerable}} to mass extinctions: dissolved oxygen became more widespread and penetrated to greater depths; the development of life on land reduced the run-off of nutrients and hence the risk of eutrophication and <b>anoxic</b> events; marine ecosystems became more diversified so that food chains {{were less likely to}} be disrupted.|$|E
5|$|A diatom floristic {{study of}} the lagoon {{revealed}} that it contains 41 species and is a rich storehouse of psychrophilic photosynthetic bacteria. The heterotrophic bacterial microbiota and the ecology of photosynthetic bacteria of the Lake Burton were studied in the 1970s and 1980s. Some of the findings indicate that salinity levels increase from below the ice level towards the lake bottom resulting in dense waters and that the environmental conditions, presence of light in summer, darkness during winter, and oxic and <b>anoxic</b> water status of the lake waters dictated the growth of bacterial phototrophs.|$|E
5|$|The {{processes}} {{responsible for}} the exceptional preservational quality of the Burgess Shale fossils are far from clear. The interpretation of what is preserved depends partly on two issues that are interlinked: whether the animals were buried where they lived, or washed long distances by sediment flows; and whether the water at the burial sites was <b>anoxic</b> or provided enough oxygen to sustain animals. The traditional view is that soft bodies and organs could only be preserved in <b>anoxic</b> conditions, otherwise oxygen-breathing bacteria would have made decomposition too rapid for fossilization. This would imply that the sea-floor organisms could not have lived there. However, in 2006 Caron and Jackson concluded that the sea-floor animals were buried where they lived. One of their main reasons was that many fossils represented partially decayed soft-bodied animals such as polychaetes, which had already died shortly before the burial event, {{and would have been}} fragmented if they had been transported any significant distance by a storm of swirling sediment. Other evidence for burial where the animals had lived includes the presence of tubes and burrows, and of assemblies of animals preserved while they fed – such as a group of carnivorous priapulids clustered round a freshly moulted arthropod whose new cuticle would not yet have hardened. Fossilized swimming organisms were also buried immediately below where they lived.|$|E
5|$|They are {{relatively}} abundant from the poles to the equator and {{are found in}} all the oceans. They inhabit the Mediterranean Sea, but not the Black Sea, while {{their presence in the}} Red Sea is uncertain. The shallow entrances to both the Black Sea and the Red Sea may account for their absence. The Black Sea's lower layers are also <b>anoxic</b> and contain high concentrations of sulphur compounds such as hydrogen sulphide. First ever sighting in Pakistan was made in 2017. First ever record on west coast of Korean Peninsula (Yellow Sea) was made in 2005. followed by one on Ganghwa Island in 2009.|$|E
5|$|A {{blood vessel}} leads {{up the middle}} of the body from the stomach to a {{circular}} vessel {{at the base of the}} lophophore, and from there a single blind vessel runs up each tentacle. A pair of blood vessels near the body wall lead downward from the lophophore ring to the stomach and also to blind branches throughout the body. There is no heart, but the major vessels can contract in waves to move the blood. Phoronids do not ventilate their trunks with oxygenated water, but rely on respiration through the lophophore. The blood contains hemoglobin, which is unusual in such small animals and seems to be an adaptation to <b>anoxic</b> and hypoxic environments. The blood of Phoronis architecta carries twice as much oxygen as a human of the same weight. Two metanephridia filter the body fluid, returning any useful products and dumping the remaining soluble wastes through a pair of pores beside the anus.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{the problem}} of ammonia levels in the final {{effluent}} was addressed by {{the construction of a}} system using <b>anoxic</b> zones and diffuse air activated sludge treatment. This dramatically reduced ammonia levels, and was the most significant factor in the re-establishment of fish stocks in the lower River Don. In 1990, the outdated filter presshouse and incineration plant were replaced by a new sludge-dewatering plant and a fluidized-bed incinerator. The new plant made the old sludge beds, situated to the east of the River Don and on the island formed by the Don and the Holmes Cut, redundant, and these have now become a nature reserve. Further improvements to the process were completed by 2005. These included an upgrade to the wet scrubbing system, in order to remove heavy metals and acid gases such as sulphur dioxide, hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride from the flue gases produced by the incinerator, and the addition of a tertiary adsorption filter, which removes mercury and dioxins. The improvements were designed to ensure that the plant met the standards set out in the Waste Incineration Directive.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{indication}} of feathering on the upper neck and head. While these conceivably may have been nude, this may still be an artefact of preservation. It appears that most Archaeopteryx specimens became embedded in <b>anoxic</b> sediment after drifting some time on their backs in the sea—the head, neck and the tail are generally bent downward, {{which suggests that the}} specimens had just started to rot when they were embedded, with tendons and muscle relaxing so that the characteristic shape (death pose) of the fossil specimens was achieved. This would mean that the skin already was softened and loose, which is bolstered by the fact that in some specimens the flight feathers were starting to detach at the point of embedding in the sediment. So it is hypothesized that the pertinent specimens moved along the sea bed in shallow water for some time before burial, the head and upper neck feathers sloughing off, while the more firmly attached tail feathers remained.|$|E
5|$|Diffusion {{of carbon}} dioxide and oxygen is {{approximately}} 10,000 times slower in water than in air. When soils are flooded, they quickly lose oxygen, becoming hypoxic (an environment with O2 concentration below 2mg/liter) and eventually completely <b>anoxic</b> where anaerobic bacteria thrive among the roots. Water also influences the intensity and spectral composition of light as it reflects off the water surface and submerged particles. Aquatic plants exhibit a wide variety of morphological and physiological adaptations that allow them to survive, compete, and diversify in these environments. For example, their roots and stems contain large air spaces (aerenchyma) that regulate the efficient transportation of gases (for example, CO2 and O2) used in respiration and photosynthesis. Salt water plants (halophytes) have additional specialized adaptations, such as the development of special organs for shedding salt and osmoregulating their internal salt (NaCl) concentrations, to live in estuarine, brackish, or oceanic environments. Anaerobic soil microorganisms in aquatic environments use nitrate, manganese ions, ferric ions, sulfate, carbon dioxide, and some organic compounds; other microorganisms are facultative anaerobes and use oxygen during respiration when the soil becomes drier. The activity of soil microorganisms and the chemistry of the water reduces the oxidation-reduction potentials of the water. Carbon dioxide, for example, is reduced to methane (CH4) by methanogenic bacteria. The physiology of fish is also specially adapted to compensate for environmental salt levels through osmoregulation. Their gills form electrochemical gradients that mediate salt excretion in salt water and uptake in fresh water.|$|E
25|$|In <b>anoxic</b> sediments {{uncontaminated}} {{by heavy}} metals, the associated metal (M in equation 2) is usually iron (Fe) or manganese (Mn). Iron (II) is abundant in <b>anoxic</b> sediment, and the Ksp for iron (II) sulfide is 10−22.39 (with a comparable value for manganese (II) sulfide), so effectively all the sulfide in an uncontaminated sediment will be bound to Fe or Mn.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that <b>anoxic</b> events caused or contributed to the Ordovician–Silurian, late Devonian, Permian–Triassic and Triassic–Jurassic extinctions, {{as well as a number}} of lesser extinctions (such as the Ireviken, Mulde, Lau, Toarcian and Cenomanian–Turonian events). On the other hand, there are widespread black shale beds from the mid-Cretaceous which indicate <b>anoxic</b> events but are not associated with mass extinctions.|$|E
25|$|A severe <b>anoxic</b> {{event at}} the end of the Permian would have allowed sulfate-reducing {{bacteria}} to thrive, causing the production of large amounts of hydrogen sulfide in the <b>anoxic</b> ocean. Upwelling of this water may have released massive hydrogen sulfide emissions into the atmosphere and would poison terrestrial plants and animals and severely weaken the ozone layer, exposing much of the life that remained to fatal levels of UV radiation.|$|E
25|$|Banded iron {{formations}} {{have been}} taken as unavoidable evidence for global ice cover, since they require dissolved iron ions and <b>anoxic</b> waters to form; however, the limited extent of the Neoproterozoic banded iron deposits means {{that they may not}} have formed in frozen oceans, but instead in inland seas. Such seas can experience a wide range of chemistries; high rates of evaporation could concentrate iron ions, and a periodic lack of circulation could allow <b>anoxic</b> bottom water to form.|$|E
25|$|Treatment of {{nitrogenous}} matter or phosphate involves additional steps {{where the}} mixed liquor {{is left in}} <b>anoxic</b> condition (meaning {{that there is no}} residual dissolved oxygen).|$|E
25|$|Oceanic {{overturn}} is {{a disruption}} of thermo-haline circulation which lets surface water (which is more saline than deep water because of evaporation) sink straight down, bringing <b>anoxic</b> deep water {{to the surface and}} therefore killing most of the oxygen-breathing organisms which inhabit the surface and middle depths. It may occur either at the beginning or the end of a glaciation, although an overturn {{at the start of a}} glaciation is more dangerous because the preceding warm period will have created a larger volume of <b>anoxic</b> water.|$|E
25|$|The sulfide ion {{produced}} by {{this process is}} sensitive to biological or chemical oxidation {{in the presence of}} oxygen, so it only persists in sediments that are continuously <b>anoxic.</b>|$|E
25|$|Possible causes {{supported}} by strong evidence appear {{to describe a}} sequence of catastrophes, each worse than the last: the Siberian Traps eruptions were bad enough alone, but because they occurred near coal beds and the continental shelf, they also triggered very large releases {{of carbon dioxide and}} methane. The resultant global warming may have caused perhaps the most severe <b>anoxic</b> event in the oceans' history: according to this theory, the oceans became so <b>anoxic,</b> anaerobic sulfur-reducing organisms dominated the chemistry of the oceans and caused massive emissions of toxic hydrogen sulfide.|$|E
25|$|The <b>anoxic</b> layer {{that begins}} at about 15 meters {{contains}} {{high concentrations of}} hydrogen sulfide which can be absorbed through {{the skin of a}} diver which can lead to death.|$|E
25|$|Biological Aerated (or <b>Anoxic)</b> Filter (BAF) or Biofilters combine {{filtration}} with biological carbon reduction, nitrification or denitrification. BAF usually {{includes a}} reactor {{filled with a}} filter media. The media is either in suspension or supported by a gravel layer {{at the foot of}} the filter. The dual purpose of this media is to support highly active biomass that is attached to it and to filter suspended solids. Carbon reduction and ammonia conversion occurs in aerobic mode and sometime achieved in a single reactor while nitrate conversion occurs in <b>anoxic</b> mode. BAF is operated either in upflow or downflow configuration depending on design specified by manufacturer.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, Willard Bascom {{suggested}} that the deep, <b>anoxic</b> waters of the Black Sea might have preserved ships from antiquity because typical wood-devouring organisms could not survive there. At a depth of 150 m, it contains insufficient oxygen to support most familiar biological life forms.|$|E
25|$|With {{lower river}} levels in mid-summer, algal blooms {{have contributed to}} making slow-flowing areas <b>anoxic.</b> The algal blooms have been {{attributed}} {{as the cause of}} death of a small number of dogs swimming in the river, as well as of skin reactions in the case of swimmers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Anoxic</b> {{events are}} {{situations}} in which the middle and even the upper layers of the ocean become deficient or totally lacking in oxygen. Their causes are complex and controversial, but all known instances are associated with severe and sustained global warming, mostly caused by sustained massive volcanism.|$|E
25|$|Physical, chemical, and {{biological}} {{methods have been}} used to remediate arsenic contaminated water. Bioremediation is said to be cost effective and environmentally friendly Bioremediation of ground water contaminated with arsenic aims to convert arsenite, the toxic form of arsenic to humans, to arsenate. Arsenate (+5 oxidation state) is the dominant form of arsenic in surface water, while arsenite (+3 oxidation state) is the dominant form in hypoxic to <b>anoxic</b> environments. Arsenite is more soluble and mobile than arsenate. Many species of bacteria can transform arsenite to arsenate in <b>anoxic</b> conditions by using arsenite as an electron donor. This is a useful method in ground water remediation. Another bioremediation strategy is to use plants that accumulate arsenic in their tissues via phytoremediation but the disposal of contaminated plant material needs to be considered.|$|E
25|$|The sulfide ion (S2−) {{is present}} in some <b>anoxic</b> sediments {{as a result of}} {{bacterial}} activity. In environments containing little or no oxygen gas (O2) but large amounts of sulfate ion (SO42−), sulfate-reducing bacteria use sulfate in their metabolism as an electron acceptor. This process creates sulfide as a product according to Equation 1.|$|E
25|$|The Monte San Giorgio lagerstätte, {{now in the}} Lake Lugano {{region of}} {{northern}} Italy and Switzerland, was in Triassic times a lagoon behind reefs with an <b>anoxic</b> bottom layer, so there were no scavengers and little turbulence to disturb fossilization, a situation that {{can be compared to}} the better-known Jurassic Solnhofen limestone lagerstätte.|$|E
25|$|The {{free radical}} {{mechanism}} to treat {{certain types of}} cancers extends beyond enediynes. Tirapazamine generates a free radical under <b>anoxic</b> conditions instead of the trigger mechanism of an enediyne. The free radical then continues on to cleave DNA {{in a similar manner}} to 1,4-didehydrobenzene in order to treat cancerous cells. It is currently in Phase III trials.|$|E
25|$|TNT is a {{reactive}} molecule and {{is particularly}} prone to react with reduced components of sediments or photodegradation {{in the presence}} of sunlight. TNT is thermodynamically and kinetically capable of reacting with a wide number of components of many environmental systems. This includes wholly abiotic reactants, like photons, hydrogen sulfide, Fe2+, or microbial communities, both oxic and <b>anoxic.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sediment {{samples to}} be {{analyzed}} are first purged with argon or nitrogen gas to ensure they are <b>anoxic.</b> The sample is placed in a flask connected to an apparatus for trapping hydrogen sulfide gas (H2S). Oxygen-free water and hydrochloric acid (HCl) are added, and the sediment is stirred for one hour while argon or nitrogen gas is bubbled through.|$|E
25|$|Because sulfide {{is quickly}} {{degraded}} {{in the presence}} of oxygen, sediment samples for SEM/AVS analysis must be kept under rigorously <b>anoxic</b> conditions from the moment they are sampled. In addition, samples should be kept at 4°C to keep bacterial metabolism from altering sediment composition. The State of Ohio Environmental Protection Agency recommends storing samples for no longer than 14 days before analyzing them.|$|E
25|$|The Institute for Exploration Black Sea expeditions {{relied on}} remote sensing with side-scan sonar in shallow and deep water to {{identify}} potential archaeological sites examined by ROVs. The {{hypothesis that the}} <b>anoxic</b> waters of the Black Sea would allow extraordinary organic preservation is {{borne out by the}} discovery of Sinop D, the 1,500-year-old shipwreck with excellent preservation of features above the sediment layer.|$|E
25|$|Larval {{stages of}} the Chironomidae {{can be found in}} almost any aquatic or semiaquatic habitat, {{including}} treeholes, bromeliads, rotting vegetation, soil, and in sewage and artificial containers. They form an important fraction of the macrozoobenthos of most freshwater ecosystems. They are often associated with degraded or low-biodiversity ecosystems because some species have adapted to virtually <b>anoxic</b> conditions and are dominant in polluted waters.|$|E
25|$|The bands were {{produced}} at {{the tipping point}} between an <b>anoxic</b> and an oxygenated ocean. Since today's atmosphere is oxygen-rich (nearly 21% by volume) and {{in contact with the}} oceans, {{it is not possible to}} accumulate enough iron oxide to deposit a banded formation. The only extensive iron formations that were deposited after the Palaeoproterozoic (after 1.8 billion years ago) are associated with Cryogenian glacial deposits.|$|E
25|$|DMSO {{disposed}} into sewers {{can also}} cause odor problems in municipal effluents: waste water bacteria transform DMSO under hypoxic (<b>anoxic)</b> conditions into dimethyl sulfide (DMS) that has a strong disagreeable odor, similar to rotten cabbage. However, chemically pure DMSO is odorless {{because of the lack}} of C-S-C (sulfide) and C-S-H (mercaptan) linkages. Deodorization of DMSO is achieved by removing the odorous impurities it contains.|$|E
