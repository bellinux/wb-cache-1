There appear two remarkable tendencies in the field; increase of software development cost and decrease of hardware development cycle. Rapid cycle of hardware development forces to make long-life software indispensable. As a result, automatic performance tuning (<b>auto-tuning,</b> in short) is in the spotlight, which leads to keep numerical software long-life by automatically adjusting its performance to various computing environments. Performance tuning in high-performance computing generally needs professional knowledge on target applications, libraries and computing systems to obtain the maximum performance. Here, performance means speed, accuracy and stabilization of computation. <b>Auto-tuning</b> {{makes it possible to}} automatically tune performance to multiple computing systems. In this paper, <b>auto-tuning</b> technology for numerical software is overviewed.

40|$|<b>Auto-tuning</b> has {{recently}} received {{its fair share}} of attention from the High Performance Computing community. Most <b>auto-tuning</b> approaches are specialized to work either on specific domains- dense/sparse linear algebra, stencil computations etc.; or only at certain stages of program execution- compile-time, launch-time or run-time.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This work {{introduces}} a generalized framework for automatically tuning stencil computations to achieve superior {{performance on a}} broad range of multicore architectures. Stencil (nearest-neighbor) based kernels constitute the core of many important scientific applications involving block-structured grids. <b>Auto-tuning</b> systems search over optimization strategies to find the combination of tunable parameters that maximizes computational efficiency for a given algorithmic kernel. Although the <b>auto-tuning</b> strategy has been successfully applied to libraries, generalized stencil kernels are not amenable to packaging as libraries. Studied kernels in this work include both memory-bound kernels as well as a computation-bound bilateral filtering kernel. We introduce a generalized stencil <b>auto-tuning</b> framework that takes a straightforward Fortran expression of a stencil kernel and automatically generates tuned implementations of the kernel in C or Fortran to achieve performance portability across diverse computer architectures.

40|$|The rapidly {{evolving}} {{landscape of}} multicore architectures makes {{the construction of}} efficient libraries a daunting task. A family of methods known collectively as “auto-tuning ” has emerged to address this challenge. Two major approaches to <b>auto-tuning</b> are empirical and model-based: empirical autotuning is a generic but slow approach that works by measuring runtimes of candidate implementations, model-based <b>auto-tuning</b> predicts those runtimes using simplified abstractions designed by hand. We show that machine learning methods for non-linear regression {{can be used to}} estimate timing models from data, capturing the best of both approaches. A statistically-derived model offers the speed of a model-based approach, with the generality and simplicity of empirical <b>auto-tuning.</b> We validate our approach using the filterbank correlation kernel described in Pinto and Cox [2012], where we find that 0. 1 seconds of hill climbing on the regression model (“predictive auto-tuning”) can achieve almost the same speed-up as is brought by minutes of empirical <b>auto-tuning.</b> Our approach is not specific to filterbank correlation, nor even to GPU kernel <b>auto-tuning,</b> and can be applied to almost any templated-code optimization problem, spanning a wide variety of problem types, kernel types, and platforms. 1...|$|R
