6000|$|This it {{was that}} caused such sudden indignation at Fanny's dreadful speech, and this {{it was that}} made quick-tempered Polly try to calm her wrath before she used toward Fanny's mother the disrespectful tone she so resented toward her own. As the swing came down after some dozen quick {{journeys}} to and fro, Polly seemed {{to have found a}} smile somewhere up aloft, for she looked toward Fan, saying pleasantly, as she paused a little in her airy exercise, [...] "I 'm not mad now, shall I come <b>and</b> <b>toss</b> <b>with</b> you?" ...|$|E

50|$|The dish {{is made by}} lightly sauteeing minced or pressed {{garlic in}} olive oil, {{sometimes}} {{with the addition of}} dried red chili flakes, <b>and</b> <b>tossing</b> <b>with</b> spaghetti. Finely chopped parsley can also be added as a garnish, along with grated parmesan or pecorino cheese, although according to some traditional recipes, cheese should not be added.|$|R
5000|$|Various cabbage-based salads that {{resemble}} coleslaw are commonly {{served as a}} side dish with the second course at dinner, next to meat and potatoes. There is no fixed recipe, but typical ingredients include shredded white cabbage (red and Chinese cabbage are also not uncommon), finely chopped onions, shredded carrots, and parsley or dill leaves, with many possible additions. These are seasoned with salt, black pepper and a pinch of sugar, <b>and</b> <b>tossed</b> <b>with</b> a dash of oil (typically sunflower or rapeseed) and vinegar, while mayonnaise-based dressings are uncommon. An alternative, usually served with fried fish, is made with sauerkraut, squeezed to get rid of excess salty brine <b>and</b> similarly <b>tossed</b> <b>with</b> carrots, onions, black pepper, sugar and oil.|$|R

"Dear child," [...] he said, [...] "if I could {{roll back}} the years, if from all my deeds of sin, as the world knows sin, I could cancel one, {{there is nothing in}} the world would make me happier than to ask you to come with me as my {{cherished}} companion to just whatever part of the world you cared for.

60|$|By now the canons had unrobed, {{and several}} strolled about {{the court in}} the sun, smoking cigarettes. The acolytes with the removal of their scarlet cassocks, were become {{somewhat}} ragged urchins playing pitch <b>and</b> <b>toss</b> <b>with</b> much gesture and vociferation. Two of them quarrelled fiercely because one player would not yield the halfpenny he had certainly lost, and the altercation must have ended in blows if a corpulent, elderly cleric had not indignantly reproved them, and boxed their ears. A row of tattered beggars, very well contented in the sunshine, were seated on a step, likewise smoking cigarettes, and obviously they did not consider their walk of life unduly hard.|$|E
6000|$|It {{happened}} thus: On {{the night}} of the 5th a vessel named the Charming Sally, about 130 tons burden, and hailing from Biddeford, came sailing over the main. A bright lookout was kept on board of her, of course, for the wind was moderately high, and the fog immoderately thick. The Sally progressed charmingly till midnight, when the look-out observed [...] "something" [...] right ahead. He thought the something looked like fishing-boats, and, being an unusually bright fellow, he resolved to wait until he should be quite sure before reporting what he saw. With a jovial swirl the waves bore the Charming Sally to her doom. [...] "Rocks ahead!" [...] roared the bright look-out, rather suddenly. [...] "Rocks under her bottom," [...] thought the crew of seven hands, as they leaped on deck, and felt the out-lying reefs of the Eddystone playing pitch <b>and</b> <b>toss</b> <b>with</b> their keel. Dire was the confusion on board, and cruel were the blows dealt with ungallant and unceasing violence at the hull of the Charming Sally; and black, black as the night would have been the fate of the hapless seamen on that occasion if the builders of the Eddystone had not kept a brighter look-out on board their sheltering Buss. John Bowden had observed the vessel bearing down on the rocks, and gave a startling alarm. Without delay a boat was launched and pulled to the rescue. Meanwhile the vessel filled so fast that their boat floated on the deck before the crew could get into it, and the whole affair had occurred so suddenly that some of the men, when taken off, were only in their shirts. That night the rescued men were hospitably entertained in the Buss by the builders of the new lighthouse, and, soon after, the ribs of the Charming Sally were torn to pieces by the far-famed teeth of the Eddystone--another added to the countless thousands of wrecks which had been demonstrating the urgent need there was for a lighthouse there, since the earliest days of navigation.|$|E

60|$|But {{everybody}} {{takes an}} embryo human being with some plan of one's own what it shall do or be. The child's future shall shape out some darling purpose or plan, and fulfill some long unfulfilled expectation of the parent. And thus, though {{the wind of}} every generation sweeps its hopes and plans like forest-leaves, none are whirled <b>and</b> <b>tossed</b> <b>with</b> more piteous moans than those which come out green and fresh to shade the happy spring-time of the cradle. For the temperaments of children are often as oddly unsuited to parents as if capricious fairies had been filling cradles with changelings.|$|R
60|$|He blenched, and {{partially}} rose, unable {{to conceal his}} dismay. She, resolved not to be cast off, seized him and clung to him. This was the movement that excited the derision of Wickens's boy in the adjacent gravel pit. Trefusis was glad of the interruption; and, when he gave the boy twopence and bade him begone, half hoped that he would insist on remaining. But though an obdurate boy on most occasions, he proved complaisant on this, and withdrew to the high road, where he made over one of his pennies to a phantom gambler, <b>and</b> <b>tossed</b> <b>with</b> him until recalled from his dual state {{by the appearance of}} Fairholme's party.|$|R
50|$|Kati kababs are {{chicken or}} mutton (lamb) chunks marinated in spices and cooked on skewers (the “kati”) over coals in a sigri. When the roll is being prepared, these are {{taken off the}} skewers <b>and</b> <b>tossed</b> <b>with</b> onions, {{chillies}} <b>and</b> sauces on the tawa, before being laid in a thin strip on {{the centre of the}} paratha (egg side up, when applicable). At this stage, most roll vendors will add various kinds of sauces, a dash of vinegar, a squeeze of lime, sometimes a shake of chaat masala and maybe some julienned carrots. The whole thing is then rolled up in paper. In Kolkata, the paper usually covers only half the roll; elsewhere the paper will cover more or even all of the roll.|$|R

Enough that my life has been ungodly and sinful, and that my only hope of absolution lies in my imparting to thee a secret which is of vast importance to the holy Church, and affects greatly her power, wealth, and dominion on these shores. But the terms of this secret and the conditions of my absolution are peculiar. I have but five minutes to live. In that time I must receive the extreme unction of the Church." ...|$|R

60|$|The {{house of}} the Huguenot {{merchant}} was a tall, narrow building standing {{at the corner of}} the Rue St. Martin and the Rue de Biron. It was four stories in height, grim and grave like its owner, with high peaked roof, long diamond-paned windows, a frame-work of black wood, with gray plaster filling the interstices, and five stone steps which led up to the narrow and sombre door. The upper story was but a warehouse in which the trader kept his stock, but the second and third were furnished with balconies edged with stout wooden balustrades. As the uncle and the nephew sprang out of the caleche, they found themselves upon the outskirts of a dense crowd of people, who were swaying <b>and</b> <b>tossing</b> <b>with</b> excitement, their chins all thrown forwards and their gaze directed upwards. Following their eyes, the young officer saw a sight which left him standing bereft of every sensation save amazement.|$|R
