[...] The Fame is not <b>about</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are—it's about how {{everybody}} wants to know who you are! Buy it and listen to it before you go out or in the car. [...] I think you've really got to allow artists' creativity to marinate. It took me a while but really delving into myself I finally got it. I couldn't be more proud of it. It's not just a record it's a whole pop art movement It's not just about one song." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Ike's Wee Wee" [...] {{raises the}} {{question}} of who really can be considered one's family. At first, Kyle's implicit idea is that family consists of [...] "those for whom we care that are related by blood". Based on this viewing of family, he no longer feels the need to help Ike when he learns that they are not related by blood. As the story progresses, Kyle questions his initial beliefs, and forms the episode's central moral by saying that [...] "Family isn't about whose blood you have. It's <b>about</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> care about." [...] Thus, Kyle's reformed view of family not only includes his adopted brother, but his friends as well. Kyle's questioning of his own morals has been likened to engaging in the dialectical Socratic method of inquiry.|$|E
500|$|John Colonnello, a youth pastor from Athens, Alabama, criticized Rihanna's {{failure as}} a role model for young girls and women who look up to her. Colonello said that Rihanna is {{promoting}} the importance of one's physical appearance, and unhealthy sex: [...] "the message should be that it's <b>about</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are on the inside and your character. That you should be honest, trustworthy, faithful, kind, loving, compassionate and more." [...] The video is the third by Rihanna in 2011 to receive a negative reaction from organizations; [...] "S" [...] was banned from eleven countries due to its explicit sexual content, while [...] "Man Down" [...] attracted media attention when the Parents Television Council (PTC) criticized Rihanna for depicting a [...] "cold, calculated execution of murder" [...] in the video and for portraying a scenario of rape. On November 23, 2011, the music video for [...] "We Found Love" [...] was banned from broadcast before 10pm in France, owing to its violent, dangerous, and sexually suggestive nature. Ulster Cancer Foundation, an anti-smoking organization, condemned Rihanna for smoking in the music video. Doreen Reegan, a spokesperson for the organization, commented on the singer's decision to include smoking as part of her promotional image, saying: ...|$|E

Quesada stated in July 2016 that [...] "there's a lot going on" [...] in the season, with Buck and the season's writers weaving {{together}} [...] "some great legends from Marvel present and past" [...] including what Quesada {{believed to be the}} most antagonists in a single season of a Marvel/Netflix series. Buck likened Iron Fist to a mystery, saying, [...] "It’s very much about how do <b>you</b> go <b>about</b> proving <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are when there's no way to do that, and that's not just the story, that's also the theme of it, which is 'How do <b>you</b> go <b>about</b> proving <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are when no one knows, including yourself, what's happened to you?'" ...|$|R

6000|$|The {{owner of}} the nearest farm joined us while we were thus engaged--a tall, red-bearded man of grave and {{intelligent}} mien. 'They've had heavy fighting this morning,' he said. 'Not since Monday week' (the Black Monday of the war) 'has there been such firing. But they are nearly finished now for the day.' Absorbed by the distant drama, all the more thrilling since its meaning was doubtful and mysterious, we had shown ourselves against the sky-line, and our conversation was now suddenly interrupted. Over {{the crest of the}} hill to the rear, two horsemen trotted swiftly into view. A hundred yards away to the left three or four more were dismounting among the rocks. Three other figures appeared on the other side. We were surrounded--but by the Natal Carabineers. 'Got you, I think,' said the sergeant, who now arrived. 'Will you kindly tell us all <b>about</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are?' We introduced ourselves as President Kruger and General Joubert, and presented the farmer as Mr. Schreiner, who had come to a secret conference, and having produced our passes, satisfied the patrol that we were not eligible for capture. The sergeant looked disappointed. 'It took us half an hour to stalk you, but if you had only been Dutchmen we'd have had you fixed up properly.' Indeed, the whole manoeuvre had been neatly and cleverly executed, and showed the smartness and efficiency of these irregular forces in all matters of scouting and reconnaissance. The patrol was then appeased by being photographed 'for the London papers,' and we hastened to accept the farmer's invitation to lunch. 'Only plain fare,' said he, 'but perhaps you are used to roughing it.' ...|$|E

I'm making sure I'm happy {{with all of the}} songs, because if I am not happy with them, I can't expect anyone else to be, you know?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Welcome to Wherever You Are" [...] {{is a song}} of affirmation, <b>about</b> {{accepting}} <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are {{and being}} comfortable in your own skin. Jon Bon Jovi claims the song is greatly influenced by events during the 2004 Presidential Election. Jon campaigned for John Kerry during that time. The song is also notable for {{being one of the}} few Bon Jovi songs lacking a guitar solo.|$|R
5000|$|... "Enjoy the Ride" [...] is {{the first}} single from the album. It was {{produced}} by Paul Godfrey and features vocals from Judie Tzuke who also co-wrote the song.

5000|$|Robert Bianco of USA Today {{said the}} third season was {{compelling}} because [...] "we {{all know the}} late-stage Camelot universe the characters occupy is about to shatter" [...] and that the series was filled with [...] "madness and passion". Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times described Mad Men as [...] "essentially one long flashback, an artfully imagined historic re-enactment of an era when America was a soaring superpower feeling its first shivers of mortality." [...] Robert Lloyd of the Los Angeles Times said the series was [...] "a moral drama, a show <b>about</b> deciding <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are and <b>who</b> <b>you</b> want to be, of character as the sum of small choices. There are no heroes or villains here, only people working out or being carried toward their individual destinies. And in who we root for and in what we root for them to choose, we also define ourselves." ...|$|R
2500|$|During an {{interview}} of The Album Network, Jared Leto {{explained that the}} song is [...] "less about reinventing yourself and more <b>about</b> finding out <b>who</b> <b>you</b> really are, your true self. That's a pretty important thing. That feeling of {{if you could just}} go back, knowing what you know now." [...] Leto said: [...] "In a general sense, it is about a desire for renewal. But I'd rather let people take their own understanding and meaning from the song. I think {{that is one of the}} exciting things about music, the interpretation, from individual to individual and how it can change so much." ...|$|R

5000|$|Shortly {{after joining}} [...] "Ernie Calhoun and the Soul Brothers", Al {{started his own}} band [...] "The Allstars", which {{consisted}} of {{a wide array of}} musical talents of different ages, musical backgrounds, and race, but with a common interest in jazz. For Al, it wasn't <b>about</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> were, what color you were, or what religion you were; it was about what instrument you played. This lack of racial boundaries in Al's musical world helped bridge a few gaps in the musical community, ultimately adding to the promotion of integration.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to Pinterest (which {{launched}} in March 2010), Silbermann worked at Google {{in the online}} advertising group. However, after a short time with the company he left and started designing his own iPhone apps with a college friend, Paul Sciarra. After their initial application, Tote, failed to gain significant traction, the cofounders teamed up with Evan Sharp to create a pinboard product that would eventually be named Pinterest. Silbermann says that the genesis of Pinterest really came from his love of collecting as a kid. “Collecting tells a lot <b>about</b> <b>who</b> <b>you</b> are,” he said, and when {{they looked at the}} web “there wasn’t a place to share that side of who you were.” ...|$|E
