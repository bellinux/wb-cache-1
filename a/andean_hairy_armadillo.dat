5000|$|The <b>Andean</b> <b>Hairy</b> <b>Armadillo</b> averages a {{tail length}} {{of three to}} seven inches and a body length of eight to sixteen inches. This {{armadillo}} is found to have eighteen dorsal bands, in which eight are considered movable. The <b>Andean</b> <b>Hairy</b> <b>Armadillo</b> gets its name genuinely because this armadillo has hair covering all of its ventral side and its legs as well. [...] This species comes {{in a variety of}} colors ranging from light brown to yellow/beige. Their teeth are unique because they are continuously growing and do not contain enamel. Their average weight tends to be four in a half to five pounds. They maintain an internal temperature and use limb Countercurrent exchange as well.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Andean</b> <b>Hairy</b> <b>Armadillo</b> {{has been}} given a bad {{reputation}} of that with its nine-banded cousin Dasypus novemcinctus and thought to carry Leprosy. [...] The main threat to this species is being hunted and having its shell sold for musical instrument making, body parts for medical remedies, and for food. Others, simply are killed because they are seen as a pest in that they cause agriculture destruction with their burrow making. Another threat is {{the fact that they are}} losing much of their habitat to road construction, farming, and Deforestation. [...] However, there are a few aids out there to try to help this species of armadillo survive. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild (CITES) has banned all trading of the <b>Andean</b> <b>Hairy</b> <b>Armadillo</b> and the capture of it. Yet, the demand for this armadillo's products still remain and many are killed regardless.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Andean</b> <b>Hairy</b> <b>Armadillos</b> are {{considered}} Omnivores because they eat {{a variety of}} foods. Their diet can consist of grains, roots, fruits and even small vertebrates. These armadillos have even been found to eat rotting flesh and the maggots found within the corpse. [...] These mammals find their food by digging through leaves and substrates while using their nose to detect possible meals. They prefer open high-altitude grasslands to live in.|$|R
5000|$|Male <b>Andean</b> <b>Hairy</b> <b>Armadillos</b> only pair up with {{a female}} during mating season. They are a Polygynandrous species and each adult lives a solitary life. The male {{armadillo}} {{is known to have}} the longest penises, in proportion to the body size, of any mammal. [...] Males are called lister and females are called zed. [...] Mating season begins in the fall and young are usually born in the summertime with a total of only two offspring. Females are pregnant for only two months though. [...] This two months pregnancy, but births in the summer is because the family Dasypodidae is known for their ability to have Delayed implantationd and all the embryos produced are from a single zygote. Embryos within the mother still produce their own placenta. [...] Armadillo's offspring are referred to as pups and are born helpless. [...] They remain with their mother fully dependent for fifty days and are sexually mature by twelve months.|$|R

50|$|The {{screaming}} <b>hairy</b> <b>armadillo</b> is a burrowing armadillo of arid {{areas from}} low to high altitudes.

50|$|The genus Chaetophractus {{consists}} {{of two or three}} species, C. vellerosus (the screaming hairy armadillo), C. nationi (the <b>Andean</b> <b>hairy</b> <b>armadillo,</b> which may actually be a population of C. vellerosus), and C. villosus. These species are recognized by the large amount of hair that extends all over their bodies, but especially on their undersides. The skulls follow the same patterns as other dasypodids, but females exhibit longer bones in the rostrocaudal plane, {{which is one of the}} key characteristics that shows the sexual dimorphism of these species. Not much is known about the cranial morphology of these species, especially bone descriptions. More research is being done to better describe these species and the skeletal differences between them. For now, body size, habitat, and behaviors are the best way to discern the differences.|$|E

50|$|The big <b>hairy</b> <b>armadillo</b> {{or large}} <b>hairy</b> <b>armadillo</b> (Chaetophractus villosus) {{is one of}} the largest and most {{numerous}} armadillos in South America. It lives from sea level to altitudes of up to 1,300 meters across the southern portion of South America, and can be found in grasslands, forests, and savannahs, and has even started claiming agricultural areas as its home. It is an accomplished digger and spends most of its time below ground. It makes both temporary and long-term burrows, depending on its food source. The armadillo can use specially evolved membranes in its nose to obtain oxygen from the surrounding soil particles without inhaling any of the soil itself. Armadillos are protected from predators by a series of thin, bony plates along the head and back. They reach sexual maturity at around 9 months and have been known to live over 30 years in captivity. Though this animal is routinely harvested for its meat and its shell, or simply killed for pestering farmers, it has shown amazing resiliency, and populations seem to be handling this exploitation well. Currently, no protective practices are in place for this armadillo, but it does live in many protected areas. This species of armadillo is a preferred research animal due to its adaptability to laboratory settings, and relative hardiness in situations of stress.|$|R

60|$|The <b>hairy</b> <b>armadillo</b> will, doubtless, long survive all {{the other}} armadillos, and on this account alone it will have an {{ever-increasing}} interest for the naturalist. I have elsewhere described how it captures mice; when preying on snakes it proceeds in another manner. A friend of mine, a careful observer, who was engaged in cattle-breeding amongst the stony sierras near Cape Corrientes, described to me an encounter he witnessed between an armadillo and a poisonous snake. While seated on the hillside one day he observed a snake, about twenty inches in length, lying coiled up on a stoue five or six yards beneath him. By-and-by, a <b>hairy</b> <b>armadillo</b> appeared trotting directly towards it. Apparently the snake perceived and feared its approach, for it quickly uncoiled itself and began gliding away. Instantly the armadillo rushed on to it, and, squatting close down, began swaying its body backward and forward with a regular sawing motion, thus lacerating its victim with the sharp, deep-cut edges of its bony covering. The snake struggled to free itself, biting savagely at its aggressor, for its head and neck were disengaged. Its bites made no impression, and very soon it dropped its head, and when its enemy drew off, it was dead and very much mangled. The armadillo at once began its meal, taking the tail in its mouth and slowly progressing towards the head; but when {{about a third of}} the snake still remained it seemed satisfied, and, leaving that portion, trotted away.|$|R
50|$|The C. villosus {{home range}} {{encompasses}} the Pampas and Patagonia {{as far south}} as Santa Cruz, Argentina and Magallanes, Chile. It is found in the Gran Chaco Province of Bolivia, Paraguay, and Argentina, and is starting to migrate south into the Tierra del Fuego province of Argentina, as well. It {{can be found in the}} Bio-Bio province and south to Aisén Province province, both in eastern Chile. Climate change and the opportunistic tendencies of this armadillo are allowing them to live in more areas. Unlike some other <b>armadillos,</b> the big <b>hairy</b> <b>armadillo</b> has not experienced s drastic change in its territory. It has not migrated as far north as some other species.|$|R
50|$|Like {{the other}} euphractines and the pink fairy {{armadillo}}, the six-banded armadillo has a tympanic bulla; the ears are 32 to 47 cm long. There are 9 pairs of teeth {{on the upper}} jaw and 10 pairs on the lower jaw; the teeth are large and strong and are assisted by strong muscles for chewing. A row of scutes, each 13 - 19 cm wide, extends {{along the back of}} the neck. The tail, 12 - 24 cm long, is covered by two to four bands of plates on the underside. Some of these plates have holes for scent gland secretions, a feature seen in no other armadillo except a few big <b>hairy</b> <b>armadillos.</b>|$|R

5000|$|He {{was born}} in Buenos Aires, {{and worked as a}} school teacher before {{entering}} politics. In 1882 he became a Freemason. In 1891 he co-founded the Radical Civic Union (Unión Cívica Radical), together with his uncle, Leandro Alem. Yrigoyen (he signed that way to distinguish himself from Bernardo de Irigoyen's political ideas) was popularly known as [...] "el peludo" [...] (the <b>hairy</b> <b>armadillo)</b> due to his introverted character and aversion to being seen in public. Following Alem's suicide in 1896, Hipólito Yrigoyen assumed sole leadership of the Radical Civic Union.

50|$|The six-banded {{armadillo}} is {{the largest}} in Euphractinae, which also contains the pichi and hairy armadillos; in fact, it is the third largest armadillo after the giant armadillo and the greater long-nosed armadillo. This armadillo is typically between 40 and 50 cm in head-and-body length, and weighs 3.2 to 6.5 kg. The carapace is pale yellow to reddish brown (though not a dark shade of brown or black), marked by scales of equal length, and scantily covered by buff to white bristle-like hairs - unlike the <b>hairy</b> <b>armadillos,</b> that are covered by dense hairs. The shell narrows to 70 to 80 percent of its original width towards {{the top of the}} head, which is covered by plates arranged in a definite pattern.

50|$|When {{trying to}} {{determine}} the differences between these species, a few noticeable traits stand out. The first difference is size; C. villosus is the larger species.

Both species are covered with much more hair than any other armadillos, mostly sprouting from its underside or between the bony plates along its back. When C. villosus is sexually aroused with an erect penis, species determination is easier. Its penis can be as long as 35 mm, and usually remains completely withdrawn inside a skin receptacle. The lesser <b>hairy</b> <b>armadillo</b> can usually be found in higher altitudes because its smaller size and slower metabolic rate helps it survive in areas with less food.|$|R
6000|$|It is not, therefore, {{strange that}} at all seasons, and even when other animals are starving, the <b>hairy</b> <b>armadillo</b> is always fat and vigorous.

Yet when a district becomes thickly settled it increases in numbers; so readily does it adapt itself to new conditions. It is not to be wondered at that the gauchos, keen observers of nature as they are, should make this species the hero of many of their fables of the [...] "Uncle Remus" [...] type, representing it as a versatile creature, exceedingly fertile in expedients, and duping its sworn friend the fox in various ways, just as [...] "Brer Rabbit" [...] serves the fox in the North American fables.|$|R
