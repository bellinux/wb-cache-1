40|$|Equivalence {{scales are}} a {{prerequisite}} for any economic well-being comparison with measures on income distribution, inequality and poverty. This paper provides equivalence scales based on revealed preference consumption microdata for West Germany 1983. It {{is a part of}} a joint US and German research project comparing equivalence scales with consistent methods and similar microdata bases, recent income and consumption surveys of both countries. We concentrate on a single equation expenditure method with different Engel approaches as well as on a complete demand system approach. The complete demand system approach provides true, constant utility based equivalence scales and is specified by an extended linear expenditure system (ELES). While the Engel methods traditionally focus on food expenditures, the multiple equation expenditure system takes into account a full market basket with all its interdependencies and relative prices. Our equivalence scale study for West Germany based on <b>actual</b> available <b>individual</b> <b>consumption</b> expenditure data shows a variety of interesting results with regard to different goods and services baskets as well as to different household composition effects including the situation of the elderly, of the families with married couples and single mothers, and the cost of children. Our consumption results finally are compared to further consumption, expert, and subjective based equivalence scales. ...|$|R

40|$|Following the {{conclusions}} of the IEG Indicator Expert Group on Education Expenditure the main recommended indicator to compare expenditure on education across countries {{is based on the}} expenditure per capita (students in full time equivalent –FTE) and corrected using purchasing power parities (PPP) as convertor unit. The election of PPP is based on its two main characteristics: a) it is a currency convertor able to transform different currencies to a common currency; and b) it is a spatial price deflator, that is, it equalizes purchasing power eliminating differences in price levels. However, different approaches could be used to calculate PPP in order to standardized expenditure values (Eurostat-OECD, 2012) : PPP in GDP, PPP in <b>actual</b> <b>individual</b> <b>consumption</b> (AIC) and PPP in <b>actual</b> <b>individual</b> <b>consumption</b> of education (AICE). This report focueses on a) the comparison of the basket elements of goods and services of the three deflators, b) the analysis of the evolution of education expenditures per student in purchasing power standards (PPS) across Member States (MS) at different levels; and c) the assessment of the quality adjustment factor included in the PPP Education based on PISA scores. Results suggests that the selection of the deflator matters when purchasing power parities are used in international expenditure comparison. In particular, while PPP in GDP is the traditional deflator used, PPP in AIC provides a better measure of economic activity for comparisons of material well-being of household. However the application of PPP Education needs additional investigation because its application significantly changes the expenditure distribution picture of EU MS. On the other hand, the inclusion or exclusion of the quality-adjustment (measure through PISA scores) to calculate PPP Education does not change the relative position of the EU MS in the expenditure distribution, but it is a recommended approximation to control for the different qualities of education outputs.

The main objective {{of this paper is}} to analyse the variation of price levels in Romania, during the {{economic crisis}} until the end of 2015, compared with the Member States of the European Union and the countries of the European Free Trade Association. For this research, information provided by EUROSTAT was used, such as price level indices for <b>actual</b> <b>individual</b> <b>consumption</b> per capita, and for different goods and services, calculated based on purchasing power parity.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{evidence that}} habit persistence {{is an important}} determinant of household consumption choices in a setting that allows for individual heterogeneity and credit constraints. By using <b>actual</b> <b>individual</b> <b>consumption</b> data, I find that {{the strength of the}} external habit, captured by the consumption of the reference group, is 0. 290; while the strength of internal habit, represented by household past consumption, is 0. 503. These findings provide empirical support to the theories that explain the equity premium puzzle by introducing habit persistence in the utility function. The results are robust to the inclusion of income growth rate and other measures of economic activity in the regression, changes in specification and in the instrument set. I also show that my specification subsumes the isoelastic specification used in Constantinides (1990), Abel (1990) and Campbell and Cochrane (1999) and that the strength of habit, the curvature of the utility function and the coefficient of relative risk aversion are similar to theirs. Finally, I show how incorrect aggregation and neglecting heterogeneity can explain why empirical studies of habit persistence based on aggregate consumption data and a representative agent reach mixed or negative findings...|$|E

40|$|In 2015, Greece, an EU state member since 1981 with a {{population}} of 10, 846, 979 people, recorded the highest level of GGD (General Government Gross Debt to GDP ratio) in the EU- 28, at 176. 9 %. Concerning the volume index of GDP (Gross Domestic Product) per capita in PPS (Purchasing Parity Standards) we find Greece’s GDP per capita dropped from 4 % lower than the EU- 28 average in 2004 to 29 % lower in 2015. However, GDP is a measure of a country’s economic activity, and therefore it should not be considered a measure of a country’s well-being. If we take the AIC (<b>Actual</b> <b>Individual</b> <b>Consumption)</b> per capita in PPS (Purchasing Power Standard) as a better indicator to describe the material welfare of households, Greece showed an AIC index per capitalower by some 19 % than the EU- 28 average in 2015. Labour productivity per hour worked expressed in US $ (which means GDP per hour worked expressed in US $) was estimated among the lowest in the EU- 28, at $ 32 in 2015. Curiously, Greece has the highest average hours worked per year in the EU- 28, at 2, 042 hours, its average hourly labour cost is among the lowest in the EU- 28, at € 14. 5, its average annual wages at US $ 25, 211 and unemployment rate of 24. 90 %. 43 % of pensioners live on € 660 /month on average, and many Greek pensioners are also supporting unemployed children and grandchildren...|$|E

40|$|To {{assess the}} impact of {{taxation}} on the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB), most studies consider the average consumer. <b>Individual</b> <b>consumption</b> is, however, very heterogeneous. In this paper, we propose a three-step methodology to {{assess the impact}} of SSB taxation on <b>individual</b> <b>consumption.</b> First, we use a disaggregation method to recover <b>individual</b> <b>consumption</b> from observed household consumption. Second, we estimate a matrix of price elasticities of demand. Third, we simulate the impact on <b>individual</b> <b>consumption</b> of a tax policy. We find that adults, both men and women, consume a larger quantity of regular soft drinks than children. We find large heterogeneity in consumption. Moreover, the average consumption of a beverage, at a given age category, increases with body mass index. We find price elasticities of demand in the range of - 1. 1 to - 3. 5 depending on the beverages. Finally, we show that a 0. 07 e tax on SSB might decrease the consumption of 5 % of the adult population by more than 1. 3 kg; the decrease being larger for an obese adult than a normal weight adult. For children, the decrease in sugar consumption is larger than 1 kg per year for about 5 % of children...|$|R
