2500|$|After its {{introduction}} to the public, the Edsel did {{not live up to}} its preproduction publicity, even though it did offer many new features, such as self-adjusting rear brakes and <b>automatic</b> <b>lubrication.</b> [...] While Ford's market research had indicated that these and other features would make the [...] "E" [...] car attractive to them as car buyers, the Edsel's selling prices exceeded what buyers were willing to pay. Upon seeing the price for a base model, many potential buyers simply left the dealerships. [...] Other customers were frightened by the price for a fully equipped top-of-the-line model.|$|E

The <b>automatic</b> {{stuffing}} <b>lubrication</b> {{system can}} appropriately provide {{a fixed amount}} of high-voltage grease for each lubrication point according to {{the conditions under which}} a vehicle is operated, thus stuffing and lubricating vehicles while they are on the move and automatically monitoring the lubrication conditions during the entire process. The essay focus on not only the analysis of the working condition of chassis centralized stuffing lubrication system, the functions and proper use of controller,sub-oil device,lubrication pump, but also the analysis of the installation and testing methods of centralized grease lubrication system...|$|R
5000|$|A 14/60 four-door four-light saloon was road {{tested by}} The Times. Head {{clearance}} {{was described as}} moderate but it was felt there was good width and leg room for two persons {{in the back seat}} and the doorways gave [...] "reasonable entrance". Interior fittings included three electric lights, two-way visors, a sliding roof, three ashtrays, an instrument board with large dial clock and speedometer, a telescopic spring steering wheel, wholly <b>automatic</b> chassis <b>lubrication,</b> a jacking system and a windscreen which could be wound out to give a direct view.|$|R

5000|$|A typical system {{consists}} of controller/timer, pump w/reservoir, supply line, metering valves, and feed lines. Regardless of the manufacturer or type of system, all <b>automatic</b> <b>lubrication</b> systems share these 5 main components: ...|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} {{application}} of <b>automatic</b> <b>lubrication</b> system is Suzuki AX100 motorcycle. The motorcycle has a separate oil reservoir on its right side which supplies the cylinder with two-stroke oil proportional to engine speed.|$|E
50|$|The {{water-cooled}} {{engine was}} a four-cylinder motor with a displacement of 3768 cm³ (bore × stroke = 100 × 120 mm) which produced 24 PS (17.6 kW). The engine had dual ignition (magneto and battery), <b>automatic</b> central <b>lubrication</b> and overhead valves. The engine power was {{transmitted to the}} rear wheels via a leather cone clutch, a four-speed gearbox with a right-hand shift mechanism and a chain. The cars had a wheelbase of 3000-3200 mm, the track was 1450 mm and the weight {{in the case of}} the double phaeton was 1650 kg. The top speed was about 70 km / h.|$|R
50|$|The {{water-cooled}} {{engine was}} a six-cylinder motor with a displacement of 6494 cm³ (bore × stroke = 105 × 125 mm), which produced 40 PS (29 kW) at 1100 rpm. The engine had magneto ignition, <b>automatic</b> central <b>lubrication</b> and overhead valves. The power was {{transmitted to the}} rear wheels via a leather cone clutch, a three-speed gearbox with a right-hand shift mechanism and a chain. The wheelbase of the car was 3280 mm, the track was 1457 mm {{and the weight of}} the chassis was 1100 kg. The top speed was about 100 km / h.|$|R
50|$|A new {{designed}} chassis {{with straight}} box section sidemembers having six tubular cross-members is particularly stiff so the {{independent front suspension}} can work properly. Steering is carried out by worm and nut. <b>Automatic</b> chassis <b>lubrication</b> {{is controlled by the}} clutch pedal. The car is fitted with a Smiths hydraulic jacking system. The independent front suspension to Alviss own design is by transverse leaf springs. The semi-elliptic rear springs are underslung. Luvax hydraulic shock absorbers control the springing. A fully floating rear axle is fitted. Wire wheels with bolt-on hubs are supplied fitted with extra low-pressure tyres. Four-wheel, self-energising Girling brakes have large diameter drums which are ribbed for cooling.|$|R
50|$|This {{system is}} {{commonly}} used for motorcycles as it eliminates the need of pre-mixing fuel and two-stroke oil. Vespa Sprint is an example where pre-mixing of two-stroke oil is required. <b>Automatic</b> <b>lubrication</b> was introduced for motorcycles by Velocette in 1913.|$|E
5000|$|After {{only one}} year's {{production}} of the TLA, the new FEA engine appeared, featuring the SELMIX <b>automatic</b> <b>lubrication</b> system, improved fuel economy and eliminated the need for pre-mixed gasoline for the two-stroke engine. Power was down somewhat, to [...] This was counteracted by the installation of a new, all-synchronized four-speed gearbox.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>{{lubrication}}</b> (also called autolube or auto-lube) {{refers to}} a lubrication system on a two-stroke engine, in which the oil is automatically mixed with fuel and manual oil-fuel pre-mixing is not necessary. The oil is contained in a reservoir that connects to a small oil pump in the engine, which needs to be periodically refilled.|$|E
5000|$|The revised chassis {{was again}} made of {{box section steel}} and was {{cruciform}} braced. The side members rose over the rear axle and were not underslung like the Consort. The suspension was independent at the front using coil springs but retained traditional leaf springs and live axle at the rear. <b>Automatic</b> chassis <b>lubrication</b> continued to be fitted, operating [...] "thermostatically every time the engine warm(ed) up", and the propeller-shaft centre bearing was [...] "prepacked with grease" [...] so did not require lubrication. [...] However, the propeller shaft itself was not served by the system and four grease points required [...] "attention every 1,000 miles". Worm and double roller steering was used. The Regency's hybrid Girling hydro-mechanical brakes were upgraded to fully hydraulic during production of the Regency II.|$|R
50|$|The August 1935 {{announcement}} from Daimler {{was that}} the coachwork of the standard saloons was redesigned. The swept tail of the new six-light saloon now covered the spare wheel. The new bodies were appreciably wider. The special independent assembly of the radiator and front wings {{was applied to the}} Fifteen as previously applied to the new Daimler Light Twenty announced on the 12 July 1935.A number of important improvements were made to the front part of the chassis though it retained the same dimensions. Suspension and steering were changed. To reduce fore and aft movement as much as possible the front springs were lengthened and made more supple in order to bring their periodicity nearer that of the rear springs. Steering was changed to the worm and nut system. The steering column was made adjustable for reach. Centralised <b>automatic</b> chassis <b>lubrication</b> and easy jacking facilities were now installed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{frame was}} {{slightly}} wider {{than that of}} the longest MR7L Claymore but the wheelbase was identical and the radiator was mounted in an inclined position above the front axle, to obviate intrusion into the passenger gangway. Wider and longer springs were fitted and the axles were of wider tack, suitable for 8 ft wide bodies. Like the MR 5 and 7 Claymore the 3.83-litre EN219 developing [...] at 2200 rpm drove through an Albion single-plate hydraulically assisted clutch and Albion four-speed constant-mesh gearbox, with synchromesh on third and top, to an Albion overhead worm rear axle, the Nimbus rear axle was heavier-duty {{than that of the}} heaviest Claymore and had larger brakes. Braking was provided by two-leading-shoe drum brakes all round, hydraulically actuated with vacuum assistance from an Albion-patented engine bypass valve. The engine had an oil-bath air-cleaner and a centrifugal oil filter. <b>Automatic</b> chassis <b>lubrication</b> was standard.|$|R
50|$|The {{hot-bulb}} engine is much simpler {{to construct and}} operate than the steam engine. Boilers require {{at least one person}} to add water and fuel as needed and monitor pressure to prevent overpressure and a resulting explosion. If fitted with <b>automatic</b> <b>lubrication</b> systems and a governor to control engine speed, a {{hot-bulb engine}} could be left running unattended for hours at a time.|$|E
50|$|Suzuki {{began using}} <b>automatic</b> <b>lubrication</b> in 1966 to {{eliminate}} premixing {{of oil and}} fuel as had been the norm for all two strokes up until then. This system was launched to eliminate mixtures with far too much oil due to the operator's unnecessary effort to preclude engine seizures. The 550 had {{the latest version of}} this multipoint oil injection called Crankcase Cylinder Injection (CCI).|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Oil {{injection}} pump on a Yamaha DX100- {{just behind the}} carburettor (visible on the left) It is the primary component of two-stroke <b>Automatic</b> <b>Lubrication</b> System. Amount of two-stroke oil injected by the pump depends on the throttle position. A cable from the throttle {{is connected to the}} oil pump indicating throttle's position. A tube ensures flow of oil from the reservoir to the oil pump.|$|E
5000|$|Nash's slogan {{from the}} late 1920s and 1930s was [...] "Give the {{customer}} more than he has paid for" [...] and the cars lived up to it. Innovations included a straight-eight engine with overhead valves, twin spark plugs, and nine crankshaft bearings in 1930. The 1932 Ambassador Eight had synchromesh transmissions and free wheeling, <b>automatic</b> centralized chassis <b>lubrication,</b> a worm-drive rear end, and its suspension was adjustable inside the car. A long-time proponent of automotive safety, Nash was among the early mid- and low-priced cars to offer four-wheel brakes.|$|R
50|$|By 1913 over 1,000 inventions were {{patented}} by black Americans. Among {{the most notable}} inventors were Jan Matzeliger, who developed the first machine to mass-produce shoes, and Elijah McCoy, who invented <b>automatic</b> <b>lubrication</b> devices for steam engines. Granville Woods had 35 patents to improve electric railway systems, including the first system to allow moving trains to communicate. Garrett A. Morgan developed the first automatic traffic signal and gas mask.|$|E
5000|$|A CCCA Classic is a [...] "fine" [...] or [...] "distinctive" [...] automobile, either American {{or foreign}} built, {{produced}} between 1915 and 1948. Generally, a Classic was high-priced when new and {{was built in}} limited quantities. Other factors, including engine displacement, custom coachwork and luxury accessories, such as power brakes, power clutch, and [...] "one-shot" [...] or <b>automatic</b> <b>lubrication</b> systems, help determine whether a car {{is considered to be}} a Classic.|$|E
