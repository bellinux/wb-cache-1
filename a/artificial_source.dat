5000|$|The phrase [...] "civil religion" [...] {{was first}} {{discussed}} extensively by Jean-Jacques Rousseau in his 1762 treatise The Social Contract. Rousseau defined [...] "civil religion" [...] {{as a group}} of religious beliefs he believed to be universal, and which he believed governments had a right to uphold and maintain: belief in a deity; belief in an afterlife in which virtue is rewarded and vice punished; and belief in religious tolerance. He said the dogmas of civil religion should be simple, few in number, and stated in precise words without interpretations or commentaries. [...] Beyond that, Rousseau affirmed that individuals' religious opinions should be beyond the reach of governments. For Rousseau civil religion was to be constructed and imposed from the top down as an <b>artificial</b> <b>source</b> of civic virtue.|$|E
5000|$|The {{passengers}} and crew of Farallon took to the lifeboats, but not without difficulty. All on board, 38 men, eventually evacuated to the shore of Iliamna Bay, but the extremely high surf and {{a large amount of}} ice made landing on the coast dangerous. [...] Once ashore, the men faced relentless cold, snow, and a lack of adequate food supplies. They lived off the few provisions and supplies that they had been able to save from the wreck, including sails, tarpaulins, passenger baggage, and mattresses. They had no <b>artificial</b> <b>source</b> of light, and had to acquired water by melting snow. A typical meal included raw bacon and frozen bread. Throughout their ordeal, the men travelled back to the shipwreck to scavenge any useful materials they could find. Consequently, they haphazardly constructed several convenience items, including makeshift stoves. As temperatures plummeted to , they built fires using driftwood found along the shore. The steamer SS Victoria finally rescued them on 3 February 1910, 29 days after they were stranded.|$|E
5000|$|When high-energy {{particles}} are in acceleration, including electrons forced {{to travel in}} a curved path by a magnetic field, synchrotron radiation is produced.

The radiated power is given by the relativistic Larmor formula while the force on the emitting electron is given by the Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac force.The radiation pattern can be distorted from an isotropic dipole pattern into an extremely forward-pointing cone of radiation.

5000|$|Artificially {{produced}} element 43 was definitively {{isolated in}} 1937 by Emilio Segrè and Carlo Perrier from a discarded piece of molybdenum foil from a cyclotron which had undergone beta decay. It was eventually named technetium {{due to its}} <b>artificial</b> <b>source.</b> No isotope of technetium has a half-life longer than 4.2 million years and was presumed to have disappeared on Earth as a naturally occurring element. In 1961 minute amounts of technetium in pitchblende produced from spontaneous 238U fission were discovered by B. T. Kenna and Paul K. Kuroda.Based on this discovery, Belgian physicist Pieter van Assche constructed an analysis of their data {{to show that the}} detection limit of Noddacks' analytical method could have been 1000 times lower than the 10−9 value reported in their paper, in order to show the Noddacks could have been the first to find measurable amounts of element 43, as the ores they had analyzed contained uranium.Using Van Assche's estimates of the Noddacks' residue compositions, NIST scientist John T. Armstrong, simulated the original X-ray spectrum with a computer, and claimed that the results were [...] "surprisingly close to their published spectrum!"Gunter Herrmann from the University of Mainz examined van Assche's arguments, and concluded they were developed ad hoc, and forced to a predetermined result.According to Kenna and Kuroda 99technetium content expected in a typical pitchblende (50% uranium) is about 10 −10 g/kg of ore.F. Habashi pointed out that uranium was never more than about 5% in Noddacks' columbite samples, and the amount of element 43 could not exceed 3 × 10 −11 µg/kg of ore. Such a low quantity could not be weighed, nor give X-ray lines of element 43 clearly distinguishable from the background noise. The only way to detect its presence is to carry out radioactive measurements, a technique the Noddacks did not use, but Segrè and Perrier did.|$|E
