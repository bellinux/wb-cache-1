5|$|Gleason's theorem {{implies the}} nonexistence of {{certain types of}} hidden {{variable}} theories for quantum mechanics, strengthening a previous argument of John von Neumann. Von Neumann had claimed to show that hidden variable theories were impossible, but (as Grete Hermann pointed out) his demonstration made an <b>assumption</b> that quantum systems obeyed a form of additivity of expectation for noncommuting operators that might not hold a priori. In 1966, John Stewart Bell showed that Gleason's theorem {{could be used to}} remove this extra <b>assumption</b> from von Neumann's argument.|$|E

The syntax of modelling <b>assumptions</b> enables us to represent modelling <b>assumptions</b> as transformations acting {{on the set of}} model equations. The notion of syntactical correctness and semantical consistency of sets of modelling <b>assumptions</b> is defined and methods for checking them are described.

5|$|The {{best fit}} for the shape of HAT-P-33b's orbit {{suggests}} that the orbit is slightly elliptical, as the planet's orbital eccentricity is fit to 0.148. However, because the star HAT-P-33 has such {{a high level of}} jitter, it is difficult to constrain the planet's eccentricity with accuracy. Most of the planet's defined characteristics are based on the <b>assumption</b> that HAT-P-33b has an elliptical orbit, although the planet's discoverers have also derived HAT-P-33b's characteristics on the <b>assumption</b> that the planet has a circular orbit. The elliptical model has been chosen because it is considered to be the most likely scenario.|$|E
40|$|Economics {{has been}} {{persistently}} criticized for its {{heavy reliance on}} unrealistic <b>assumptions.</b> Some people reply to this criticism {{by saying that the}} unrealistic <b>assumptions</b> of economics result from abstraction from unimportant details, and abstraction is necessary for knowledge of a complex real world. So, far from unrealistic <b>assumptions</b> detracting from the epistemic worth of economics, such <b>assumptions</b> are essential for economic knowledge. I call this line of argument 'the Abstractionist Defense'. After clarifying abstraction, unrealistic <b>assumptions</b> and kindred notions, I show that the Abstractionist Defense does not successfully rebut the position of those who criticize economics for its unrealistic <b>assumptions.</b> abstraction, idealizations, unrealistic <b>assumptions,</b> the Direct Method of testing, the Indirect Method of testing, the Abstractionist Defense,...|$|R
