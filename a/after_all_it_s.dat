60|$|A single lightning-like {{flash in}} Mr. Sabin's {{eyes for a}} moment disconcerted his host. But, <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> <b>it</b> was gone with such amazing suddenness that it left behind it a sense of unreality. Mr. Brott decided that <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> must have been fancy.|$|R
60|$|Perhaps <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> was {{not simply}} {{indigestion}} that troubled him.|$|R
60|$|He hesitated. <b>After</b> <b>all,</b> <b>it</b> was {{scarcely}} worth while concealing anything now.|$|R
60|$|But to you <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> is not needful. You {{understand}} and have understood.|$|R
60|$|He felt {{a sudden}} chill. Yet, <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> <b>it</b> was what he had expected.|$|R
60|$|A slight plaintiveness in {{her tone}} dispelled his first disappointment. <b>After</b> <b>all,</b> <b>it</b> was Louise's decision.|$|R
60|$|And <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> <b>it</b> {{is better}} to be princess in Beldover than a vulgar nobody in the country.|$|R
60|$|She {{knew better}} than to make the mistake of denial. <b>After</b> <b>all,</b> <b>it</b> was an absurdly unequal contest.|$|R
60|$|ERNEST. Certainly not. And, <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> <b>it</b> is {{only once}} a month that he is affable to you.|$|R
60|$|LUCREZIA. But {{have you}} tried knocking? Perhaps, <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> <b>it</b> might be opened again, if only a crack.|$|R
60|$|He was {{a little}} taken aback, but, <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> <b>it</b> was perhaps the {{simplest}} way out of his difficulties.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, the {{indifferent}} and the selfish; but, <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> <b>it</b> is {{the same}} thing: indifference is the perfection of selfishness." ...|$|R
60|$|Von Behrling drew himself up. <b>After</b> <b>all,</b> <b>it</b> {{was he who}} was noble; Streuss {{was little}} more than a policeman.|$|R
60|$|<b>After</b> <b>all,</b> <b>it</b> {{might be}} that I should get an {{opportunity}} of giving him the slip. London is a large city.|$|R
60|$|Anna {{measured}} out the coffee. Her eyes were lit with a gleam of humour. <b>After</b> <b>all,</b> <b>it</b> was really rather funny.|$|R
60|$|Arthur looks upon me as a child. <b>After</b> <b>all,</b> <b>it's</b> not {{my fault}} that I'm twenty years younger than he is.|$|R
6000|$|He related what Payne {{had told}} him and concluded: [...] "I'm puzzled about Oliva's motive. <b>After</b> <b>all,</b> <b>it</b> could hardly be revenge." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're hanging men without trial? Faith, then, it's mistaken I am. We're in Tangiers, <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> <b>it</b> seems, {{where your}} {{regiment}} belongs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, well,' said I, 'those Belgian girls! You {{never know}} where their letters will end. And, <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> <b>it's</b> his affair--you needn't bother.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That may deprive it of the {{brilliance}} of a voluntary sacrifice; but, <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> <b>it</b> is what makes your course safe and plain.' ...|$|R
60|$|But <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> was not {{necessary}} that I should see her face. I had seen it, and I could never forget it.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Never mind, dear. You {{look very}} nice in <b>it.</b> <b>After</b> <b>all,</b> <b>it</b> was only thirty shillings. Can {{you show me}} any extravagance of mine?' ...|$|R
60|$|And yet <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> {{was this}} instrument, the same twisted wire and little quivering tympanum, {{that had brought}} back Marjorie into his life.|$|R
60|$|Perhaps, <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> <b>it</b> is as well {{those old}} fashions have gone out. A week in that suit might have {{impaired}} my natural modesty.|$|R
60|$|But, <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> <b>it</b> {{was only}} Nicholas of Reist who entered. He {{closed the door}} behind him carefully, and {{approached}} them. Brand stepped forward.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh well," [...] said I, [...] "those Belgian girls! You {{never know}} where their letters will end.--And <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> <b>it's</b> his affair--you needn't bother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And so, Mr Gresham, I am to be told, that <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> means nothing," [...] said Patience, {{putting her}} {{handkerchief}} {{up to her}} eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "He can't do {{him much}} harm; and, <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> <b>it</b> {{does not look}} as if Dick would marry Elsie, as we once thought was possible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see it's {{his only}} hobby," [...] {{observed}} Harker, apologetically, [...] "and, <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> <b>it's</b> his own house; and he's very hospitable in other ways." ...|$|R
60|$|The crystal cage {{appeared}} and settled slowly down. Conger sighed. It {{was good to}} see <b>it</b> again. <b>After</b> <b>all,</b> <b>it</b> was his only way back.|$|R
60|$|Elsie hurried {{away after}} thanking Miss Ticklebaum for her timely warning and advice. <b>After</b> <b>all,</b> <b>it</b> seemed {{that she must}} try to find Mr. Otter.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think he's {{tired of}} me," [...] said Nick; [...] "he hasn't been near me either. But <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>it's</b> natural--he has seen me through." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, Jeeves. I {{accept your}} ruling. <b>After</b> <b>all,</b> <b>it</b> would be {{unpleasant}} for Mrs. Travers {{to find a}} swollen body floating in her pond." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We know you, Marquis," [...] {{said the}} leader in a cowed voice. [...] "Sheath your swords, comrades; <b>after</b> <b>all,</b> <b>it</b> is no affair of ours." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no! Not on any account! I'd rather {{think it}} out for myself. You couldn't help me. <b>After</b> <b>all,</b> <b>it</b> hasn't done me any harm--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{believe he}} expects {{you to be}} even with Sydney Calcott <b>after</b> <b>all.</b> <b>It</b> is really very clever. Where did you get all those funny stories?' ...|$|R
