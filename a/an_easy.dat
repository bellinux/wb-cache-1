5|$|In 1871, journalists, {{eager to}} sensationalize {{the events of}} the Great Fire, were quick to find in Mrs. Kate O'Leary <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> {{scapegoat}} for the calamitous inferno. As a working-class immigrant and a woman, Kate O'Leary was <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> target for those publications who always found it comfortable to vilify Irish Catholics who had not yet assimilated into the dominant American middle-class culture.|$|E

Sport fishing became a draw for many wealthy northerners.|$|R

5|$|Although highly decorated, honoured {{and well}} {{respected}} for his work, Muller was not <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> person. This shows through in a consistently bad press he received {{during his lifetime}} and after, which highlights his eccentricities and his at times volatile character.|$|E

Opteron gained rapid acceptance in the enterprise server space because it provided <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> upgrade from x86. Under influence by Microsoft, Intel responded by implementing AMD's x86-64 instruction set architecture instead of IA-64 in its Xeon microprocessors in 2004, {{resulting in a}} new industry-wide de facto standard.|$|E
5|$|The 6th Airborne Division, {{now with}} the commandos of the 1st Special Service Brigade under command, had to defend the Orne bridgehead.

5|$|A {{pneumothorax}} (collapsed lung) is {{an abnormal}} collection of {{air in the}} pleural space that causes an uncoupling of the lung from the chest wall. The lung cannot expand against the air pressure inside the pleural space. <b>An</b> <b>easy</b> to understand example is a traumatic pneumothorax, where air enters the pleural space from outside the body, as occurs with puncture to the chest wall. Similarly, a scuba diver ascending while holding their breath with their lungs fully inflated can cause air sacs (alveoli) to burst and leak high pressure air into the pleural space.|$|E

5|$|Auxois {{horses are}} usually bay or bay roan in color, {{although}} {{they can also}} be chestnut or red roan, similar to the Ardennais. gray and seal brown (the latter called black pangaré by the breed registry, although these horses are genetically brown, not black with pangaré markings) are also accepted for registration; all other colors are excluded. The Auxois is known for its power and docility, having a calm and gentle temperament.

5|$|Despite their film careers, Orci and Kurtzman {{continued}} to create television series. These included Sleepy Hollow, which they developed alongside Phillip Iscove. They pitched the series {{to a number}} of networks, and it was picked up by Fox. Orci took five years to bring the series Matador to television, with it originating from a conversation with his cousin Andrew. It was created for Robert Rodriguez's El Rey Network, and Rodriguez's one demand of the show was that he could direct the pilot episode. Orci later explained in an interview that it was <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> decision, and he needed to pretend to consider it.|$|E

Will refuses, stating that Spears is a bad role model.

5|$|In the gubernatorial {{election}} of 1911, Republicans were divided {{as to whether}} they should celebrate Willson's administration or downplay it. His actions to quell the violence in the Black Patch Wars and his pardons to Taylor and Powers were both unpopular with many voters. The eventual candidate, Edward C. O'Rear, was lukewarm at best to Willson's administration. Willson was upset by this hesitancy and lent O'Rear only modest support on the campaign trail. Former governor Bradley also disagreed with O'Rear's selection and engaged in minimal campaigning. The failure of the party to unite behind their candidate gave Democrat James B. McCreary <b>an</b> <b>easy</b> victory.|$|E
