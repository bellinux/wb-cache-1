The film {{is set in the}} future, when Earth is at war with the Kaiju, colossal monsters which have emerged from an interdimensional portal {{on the bottom of the}} Pacific Ocean. To combat the monsters, humanity unites to create the Jaegers, gigantic humanoid mechas each controlled by at least two pilots, whose minds are joined by a mental link. Focusing on the war's later days, the story follows Raleigh Becket, a washed-up Jaeger pilot called out of retirement and teamed with rookie pilot Mako Mori as part of <b>a</b> <b>last-ditch</b> <b>effort</b> to defeat the Kaiju.|$|E

5|$|German forces {{continued}} their counterattacks on Übach, suffering heavy casualties to American artillery and infantry fire. Although {{the inability to}} retake Übach persuaded German commanders that they had insufficient forces to properly defend the approaches to Aachen, the counterattacks did tie down American troops which could have otherwise continued the advance. On 4 October, the Allied advance was limited, with only the towns of Hoverdor and Beggendorf taken, the Americans having lost roughly 1,800 soldiers {{in the past three}} days of combat. Better progress was made on 5 October, as the 119th Regiment of the 30th Infantry Division captured Merkstein-Herbach. The following day the Germans launched another counterattack against Übach, again failing to dislodge the Americans. German armor was unable to cope with the overwhelming numerical superiority of the American tanks, and as <b>a</b> <b>last-ditch</b> <b>effort</b> to halt the advance the Germans began concentrated attacks on American positions with what artillery and aircraft they could muster. They found themselves severely hamstrung by lack of reserves, although General Koechling was able to deploy a Tiger detachment to the town of Alsdorf in an attempt to plug the American penetration of Aachen's northern defenses.|$|E
5|$|New mixes will {{be added}} {{regularly}} to DJ Hero through downloadable content that can be purchased on the console's respective online stores; content was made available {{on the day of}} the game's release. Unlike Guitar Hero games' downloadable content, which costs approximately US$2 per track, each mix costs approximately $3 to download because of the additional effort needed to create the mixes. Furthermore, mixes are provided only as bundles for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 users; the Wii's storefront prevents the selling of bundled packages; instead, each track is offered individually. Critics viewed the lack of individual song selection on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms as a way of limiting consumers' choice, as previous downloadable songs for games such as Guitar Hero allow players on these systems to select individual tracks to purchase from a bundle. The long time between the second downloadable pack (in November 2009) and the third pack (in March 2010) was also believed to be the result of <b>a</b> <b>last-ditch</b> <b>effort</b> by Activision to support the game, and that the few packs released did not meet expectations for the game.|$|E

50|$|The Beach Boys {{third and}} final album release of 1968, coming after Friends and {{released}} {{the same day as}} the quickly gathered material for The Best of The Beach Boys Vol. 3, Stack-o-Tracks was seen by many at the time as <b>a</b> desperate <b>last-ditch</b> <b>effort</b> by Capitol Records to try anything to sell Beach Boys material. The strategy backfired, however; issued at one of their lowest commercial ebbs in the U.S., Stack-o-Tracks became the first Beach Boys album to fail to reach the U.S. or UK charts. Until 1992's much-maligned Summer in Paradise, it would remain their only official release to have this distinction.|$|R

In the end, the superior firepower of the British guns and missiles won out. On 1 December, Gen. Campbell, with 2500 European and 1500 Indian sepoys, supported by a flotilla of gun boats, attacked the main Burmese position outside Prome.

However, it received condemnation from human rights organizations for its restrictions on freedom of speech and organization, potentially placing Nigeria at odds with several international agreements to which the country is signatory; it was also seen in Nigeria as being <b>a</b> <b>last-ditch</b> election-year <b>effort</b> of the Obasanjo administration to appeal to public sentiment, since the second reading of the bill was being pushed after the Senate's defeat of a bill to amend the Constitution's limit on the number of presidential terms.

5000|$|Guns defense maneuvering, or [...] "guns-D", is {{the last}} resort for a defender that fails to outmaneuver the attacker. Guns-D {{is a series of}} random changes in the {{defenders}} flight path, intended to spoil the attacker's aim by presenting a constantly shifting target, and, hopefully, to maneuver out of the bullet stream (hose). It consists of arbitrary speed changes, yaws, skids, slips, pitch-ups, and rolls, and {{is often referred to as}} [...] "jinking." [...] Because the attacker must aim ahead of the opponent, the primary goal in guns-D is to disorient the attacker's aim by keeping the nose pointed in a different direction than the velocity vector (the direction of travel), and is very effective at preventing the attacker from achieving a suitable guns solution. However, guns-D maneuvering still leaves the defender susceptible to stray bullets and [...] "lucky shot" [...] hits, and does little to improve the relative positional situation. Thus, it is only employed as <b>a</b> <b>last-ditch</b> defensive <b>effort</b> when nothing else works.|$|R
25|$|Hasek roll: The Hasek roll is a desperation {{maneuver}} {{named after}} Czech goaltender Dominik Hašek.

The rank of the Guardians has weakened as well; while there were originally twelve of them as Head Guardians, there are now six of them, after Ganthet and Sayd left Oa, and one Guardian died after a battle with Superman-Prime -this Guardian willfully [...] "detonated" [...] himself in <b>an</b> unsuccessful, <b>last-ditch</b> <b>effort</b> to destroy the insane Kryptonian (who wished to destroy the Universe in his own right).

Her fellow Guardians were unaware of the changes within her, either physical or behavioral (she is far more militant than is normal for the Guardians). In the Origins and Omens backup stories running through several DC releases in February 2009, she is given the official name of Scar. Scar killed one of her fellow guardians in the beginning of the Blackest Night, and is later revealed that she has since died after the Anti-Monitor's attack, and functions as an undead instead of an immortal.

50|$|As {{it turned}} out, Rochester was more {{interested}} in its thriving sandlot football circuit than in professional football. The Jeffersons had attempted to recruit some of the country's best college players, but the fans would rather see local boys play, and, by 1922, the Jeffersons' on-field product was enough to annihilate local teams (thus discouraging fans from coming out as blowouts were assured) but, after some initial modest success, not good enough to compete {{with the rest of the}} NFL (thus also discouraging fans from coming out as the Jeffersons were almost assured to lose). As a result, the teams attendance suffered badly, with the local semi-pro teams drawing much better. Without a consistent draw at the gate, the team's finances, play on the field and ability to draw star talent likewise suffered, and the team finished its last four seasons without a single league win. (This was not to say that the team went totally winless in this span; in a 1924 contest, the Jeffersons defeated the Pottsville Maroons of the Anthracite League; the Maroons, the class of their league, moved to the NFL in 1925, when it contended for the NFL title.) After <b>an</b> unsuccessful <b>last-ditch</b> <b>effort</b> to lure Red Grange to Rochester (he instead signed with the Chicago Bears), the team suspended operations after the 1925 NFL season; by this point, the team had been losing money (to the point where Lyons' house had been foreclosed upon because of his dumping of virtually all his assets into the team) and had been a traveling team for two seasons (1924 and 1925). The team remained technically suspended for 1926 and 1927, but allowed its franchise to expire in 1928. Lyons stayed on with the NFL as an unofficial historian after the Jeffersons' folding.|$|R
