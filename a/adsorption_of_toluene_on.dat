This paper {{discusses}} {{the effectiveness of}} a less expensive adsorbent, a discarded rubber tyre (DRT) in removing toluene from aqueous phase. <b>Adsorption</b> <b>of</b> <b>toluene</b> <b>on</b> a DRT has been studied by using batch system at 25 and 30 °C. It was found that up to 70 % of toluene was removed for the range of toluene initial concentrations studied between 50 - 300 mg/l. Using linearized forms of equilibrium models, namely Langmuir and Freundlich models, the maximum adsorptive capacities were determined. It was evident from the experimental data that, although both Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models could describe the isotherm data, the <b>adsorption</b> <b>of</b> <b>toluene</b> <b>on</b> a DRT was described well by the Freundlich isotherm. For Freundlich K values, sorption capacities were 6. 6374 and 7. 7535 mg/l at 25 and 30 °C, respectively. The values of Freundlich exponent n were greater than one for both temperatures...|$|E

40|$|Carbonaceous {{adsorbents}} {{produced from}} mixtures of novolac resin and olive stone biomass in various proportions were investigated {{with respect to}} their ability to adsorb toluene and cyclohexane from the vapour phase. The <b>adsorption</b> <b>of</b> <b>toluene</b> <b>on</b> all adsorbents was found to be higher than that of cyclohexane. The overall diffusion coefficient, D, of the adsorption process, the specific surface area and the pore volume of the adsorbents have been calculated. The results are discussed in terms of {{the size and shape of}} the pores, the polarity of the adsorbate and the dispersion forces between adsorbent and adsorbate. It is concluded that slit-shaped pores are also present in the adsorbents which are characteristic of carbon molecular sieves. Toluene can enter more pores than cyclohexane for the adsorbents used. The adsorbent derived from the mixture of novolac/biomass = 20 / 80 shows the highest adsorption (i. e. equilibrium uptake, diffusion coefficient, specific surface area and pore volume) of toluene and cyclohexane. © 1996 Chapman & Hall...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{increase}} water pollution by organic compound derived from hydrocarbons such as toluene, several alternative technologies for remediation of polluted water have been originated. In this work natural bentonites were modified with cetyltrimethylammonium (CTMA+) for obtaining organophilic bentonites. The obtained CTMA-bentonites would {{be suitable for}} use as adsorbents <b>of</b> <b>toluene</b> present in water. The influence of structural characteristics of CTMA-bentonites on their adsorption capacity was studied. It was shown that <b>adsorption</b> <b>of</b> <b>toluene</b> depended <b>on</b> homogeneous interlayer space associated with arrangements of CTMA+ paraffin-monolayer and bilayer models, accompanied by a high degree ordering of the carbon chain of organic cation in both arrangements. However, packing density would not have an evident influence on the retention capacity of these materials. The solids obtained were characterized by chemical analysis, X-ray diffractions and infrared spectroscopy. Toluene adsorption was measured by UV-visible spectrophotometer. Adsorption capacity was studied by determining adsorption isotherms and adsorption coefficient calculation. The adsorption isotherms were straight-line indicating a partition phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>toluene</b> between the aqueous and organic phase present in organophilic bentonites...|$|R

40|$|The total {{oxidation}} of toluene was studied over a Co 3 O 4 /La-CeO 2 catalyst in a Temporal Analysis of Products (TAP) set-up in {{the temperature}} range 713 K to 873 K {{in the presence}} and absence of dioxygen. It has been demonstrated that the reaction proceeds via a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. The reaction rate increased 8. 4 times if both toluene and dioxygen {{were present in the}} feed. The partial reaction order with respect to O- 2 diminished from 0. 9 to 0. 6 with an increase in temperature from 763 to 873 K. Adsorbed oxygen species with a lifetime of similar to 8 s have been found on a catalyst fully oxidized by dioxygen. Catalysis of isotopically labeled O- 18 (2) /(C 6 H 5 CH 3) -C- 12 -C- 13 results in the formation of products containing O- 18, which indicates that both lattice and adsorbed oxygen are involved in the total oxidation of toluene. The role of adsorbed oxygen is activation of the C-H bond in toluene. The reaction network of the catalytic total oxidation of toluene consists of the following sequence: <b>adsorption</b> <b>of</b> <b>toluene</b> <b>on</b> the catalyst surface; activation of toluene by dehydrogenation with adsorbed oxygen; oxidation of activated toluene mainly by the lattice oxygen and re-oxidation of the reduced catalyst by dioxygen...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAlthough biogases mainly {{consist of}} a mixture {{of carbon dioxide and}} methane, traces of {{volatile}} organic compounds are present and these undesirable compounds must be removed during the purification process. Adsorption onto activated carbon fiber cloth was investigated and, in particular, the feasibility of electrothermal desorption. Five compounds were chosen and their desorption was assessed by monitoring the electric resistance of the material as a function of temperature. The results were confirmed by thermogravimetric analysis. Toluene, dichloromethane, and isopropanol were entirely desorbed at 420 K whereas siloxane D 4 and ethyl mercaptan (ethanethiol) were partially removed. These conclusions were confirmed by dynamic adsorption measurements. Cycles of adsorption followed by electrothermal desorption were first carried out for a single component (toluene). Although there was a loss of adsorption capacity {{between the first and second}} cycles, a steady performance was reached, shedding light on the complete reversibility of the <b>adsorption</b> <b>of</b> <b>toluene.</b> <b>On</b> the contrary, for the mixture of five organic compounds, a constant loss of adsorption capacity was measured after three cycles, which was attributed to the incomplete regeneration at 420 K of two organic compounds (ethanethiol and siloxane D 4) from the ACFC from one cycle to another. The electrical consumption for the electrothermal desorption was highest at the beginning of the desorption and rapidly decreased as the temperature within the filter reached its setpoint.

40|$|In this work, the <b>adsorption</b> <b>of</b> <b>toluene</b> <b>on</b> pure-silica MEL zeolite is {{investigated}} using {{a variety}} of experimental and simulation methods. First, we measured the volumetric and calorimetric isotherms at 301 K and at 315 K. The volumetric adsorption isotherm presents a substep at a loading of roughly 4 molecules per unit cell that shifts to higher pressures at higher temperatures and that coincides with a sudden increase in the isosteric heat of adsorption. Grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the substep at half load is caused by the adsorption of toluene molecules at different energetic sites within the porous network. According to this, toluene molecules occupy first the intersections, and once all intersections are filled, additional toluene molecules place themselves within the channels. The structure of the adsorbate/adsorbent system was further investigated by performing X-ray powder diffraction experiments of the zeolite at three different loads: empty, at half load (before the substep), and at high load (after the substep). Numerous new low intensity peaks and splittings of existing peaks at the empty and half-loaded diffractograms appear in the diffraction pattern of the high load sample. Atomic structural models compatible with the experimental spectra were obtained by performing N-reverse Monte Carlo simulations. Whereas at half load a good fit of the experimental diffraction pattern can be obtained using the rigid zeolite approximation, at high load, this is only possible when the flexibility of the zeolite is incorporated. In this structural model, the channel cross sections are deformed from a nearly circular shape in the empty zeolite to a more elliptical shape {{in the case of the}} high load zeolite.

40|$|International audienceThis article {{reports the}} use of {{innovative}} diagnostics to monitor toluene adsorption and oxidation on CeO 2 surface under non-thermal plasma (NTP) exposure. Two plasma-catalytic configurations are explored, namely: post-plasma catalysis (PPC) and in-plasma catalysis (IPC). Since heterogeneous processes are pointed out as key steps of the plasma-catalyst coupling, the catalyst surface has been monitored by two complementary in situ diagnostics: (i) diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and (ii) transmission {{fourier transform infrared spectroscopy}} using Sorbent track (ST) device. Dielectric barrier discharges (DBD) are used in both PPC and IPC configurations to induce adsorbed toluene oxidation. Toluene in dry air is first adsorbed on the selected catalytic surface: ceria (CeO 2). Subsequently, the plasma is switched on. During the experiment, the ceria surface is monitored by infrared to study toluene adsorption and oxidation mechanisms. The <b>adsorption</b> capacity <b>of</b> <b>toluene</b> <b>on</b> ceria is, respectively, measured in the configurations of PPC and IPC by DRIFTS and ST. The oxidation <b>of</b> <b>toluene</b> by plasma follows a first-order reaction regardless of plasma configuration and injected power and IPC is more effective for the toluene removal than PPC. Intermediates <b>of</b> <b>toluene</b> (benzyl alcohol, benzaldehyde and benzoic acid) are also identified on the surface and their respective temporal evolutions {{as a function of the}} plasma exposure are studied. ppap 201600114 -gra- 000...|$|R

In this work, the <b>adsorption</b> <b>of</b> <b>toluene</b> and naphthalene <b>on</b> GAC is investigated. Sorption equilibrium and kinetic experiments were performed at laboratory scale using low contaminant concentrations. The experimental conditions were chosen so as to simultaneously explore the different ranges of concentrations typically encountered in industrial wastewaters. The sorption behaviour was then explained through modelling {{taking into account the}} main equilibrium and transport phenomena and three adsorption compartments: the GAC particle surface, the macro- and meso-pores, and the micropores. The pore diffusion and solid diffusion were both considered to be coupled with a linear adsorption isotherm.

The carbon samples were obtained by modification of F- 400 by means of chemical treatment with HNO 3 and thermal treatment under nitrogen flow. The treatment with nitric acid caused {{the introduction of a}} significant number of oxygenated acidic surface groups onto the carbon surface, while the heat treatment increases the basicity of carbon. The pore characteristics were not significantly changed after these modifications. The dispersive interactions are {{the most important factor in}} this adsorption process.

40|$|The {{ability of}} NaY, KY, BaY, BaX and NaX zeolites to adsorb {{m-xylene}} and toluene was studied experimentally. Thus, the adsorption isotherms of two volatile organic compounds, toluene and m-xylene, on NaY, KY, BaY, BaX and NaX were measured at 298, 308, 318, and 333 K using a vacuum microbalance system. The toluene and the m-xylene were chosen because {{they belong to}} the same chemical family. The experimental data obtained were correlated with different existing adsorption isotherm models such as the Langmuir model, the Freundlich model, the Fowler-Guggenheim model, the Hill-De Boer model and the Sips model. The Langmuir model is well adapted to the description of m-xylene and toluene adsorption on NaY, KY, BaY, BaX and NaX zeolites at all four temperature. The Sips model is also found to be well adapted to describe the <b>adsorption</b> <b>of</b> <b>toluene</b> <b>on</b> to NaY, KY, BaY, BaX and NaX zeolites at all four temperature. The Freundlich model, the Fowler-Guggenheim model, and the Hill-De Boer model were not satisfactory. The adsorption affinity of m-xylene on NaY, KY, BaY, BaX and NaX zeolites is sufficiently greater than the affinity of toluene. The adsorption affinity of m-xylene and toluene decreased in the following order NaY>NaX>BaX>KY>BaY. These results demonstrate the high capacity of NaY, KY, BaY, BaX and NaX zeolites to remove vapors of m-xylene and toluene at very low concentrations. However, in the volumetric method, the accuracy of the data depends on the precision with which the equilibrium pressure is measured. Besides, the existence of dead volume, the value of which is never known with high precision, is a source of error. That is why, the gravimetric method remains the most accurate method for measuring gas-solid equilibrium data for pure gases...|$|E
40|$|The {{adsorption}} {{of simple}} organic bases on high-silica zeolites was studied using simultaneous temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) {{in order to}} understand more {{about the nature of the}} acid-sites in these materials. Specifically, the effect of the adsorbate type and the zeolite structure and composition on the interaction between adsorbate and the acid-site was examined. ^ The <b>adsorption</b> <b>of</b> <b>toluene</b> <b>on</b> H-ZSM- 5 was examined using TPD-TGA, infrared spectroscopy, and proton NMR. The isotope exchange between toluene and D-ZSM- 5 was found to occur through arenium-ion-like intermediates which were formed on H-ZSM- 5 at a stoichiometry of one per Al-site at temperatures as low as 273 K. ^ To examine the effect of Al concentration on the acid sites, the adsorption of methanol, 2 -propanol, and 2 -methyl- 2 -propanol was investigated on H-ZSM- 5 samples with silica-alumina ratios of 38, 70, and 520. Adsorption complexes of one molecule/Al were identified on each of the samples. Furthermore, the unimolecular reactivities of this 1 : 1 state were unaffected by the Al concentration, implying that the acid-sites are identical and are formed one per Al. Adsorption complexes were also observed for 2 -propanamine and 2 -propanone on H-ZSM- 5 samples. ^ To examine the effect of zeolite structure on the acid-sites, the adsorption of 2 -propanol and 2 -propanamine of H-ZSM- 12 and H-mordenite was examined. The 1 : 1 adsorption complexes which were formed were identical in reactivity to those formed in H-ZSM- 5, implying that the acid-sites formed by isolated Al atoms in a zeolite lattice are chemically equivalent, independent of the structure of the lattice. ^ The adsorption of ammonia, 2 -propanamine, and 2 -propanol on H-(B) -ZSM- 5, H-(Fe) -ZSM- 5, and H-(Ga) -ZSM- 5 was examined to investigate the effect of the incorporation of trivalent ions into the zeolite framework. Adsorption complexes corresponding to one molecule per substituent atom were identified. The reactivity of the complexes on H-(B) -ZSM- 5 indicates that the acid-sites formed by B-incorporation are much weaker than those associated with Fe, Ga, or Al. TPD-TGA techniques were found to be valuable in characterizing the materials created by the incorporation of trivalent cations into the zeolite framework. ^ To investigate the oligomerization chemistry which can occur in H-ZSM- 5, TPD-TGA experiments examining the low-temperature reaction of ethene, propene, and 2 -methyl- 2 -propanol were carried out using gas chromatographic analysis of the products. The similarity in the temperature range of desorption and in the products obtained for these adsorbates indicates a similarity in the intermediates formed in the zeolite following adsorption. ...|$|E
40|$|Microporous zeolites and {{mesoporous}} periodically silicious materials offer interesting features, like porosity in general, host-guest {{interactions and}} among others, sorption phenomena. The application of addressable individual material pixels, pin-printed onto adequate pre-treated supporting surfaces for gas-sensor systems was evaluated. The contact pin-printing technique, {{well known in}} bio-science, was adopted and optimized. The successful deposition of colloidal suspensions of zeolite materials on Au-covered glass slides with chemically attached intermediate anchoring molecules was demonstrated on a 100 μm scale (chapter 3). In a collaboration with the physical department of the LMU Munich (Prof. Kotthaus) a gas sensor system, based on surface acoustic wave devices was developed. Thin layers of porous material in the sub-microgram range were applied, in order to record adsorption isotherms and to determine the released heat of adsorption of specific analyte gases. Related to very small sample amounts and short diffusion times the necessary experimental measurement time could be reduced down to several minutes (chapter 9). An existing rudimentary quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) was enhanced and an automated intelligent equilibrium system was developed. Furthermore, the system was equipped with liquid mass controllers {{in order to measure}} the sorption properties together with vaporized liquid solvents (chapter 4). The developed QCM measurement setup was applied as advanced research tool in order to investigate sorption properties of various porous samples and to obtain the thermodynamic parameter, the isosteric heat of adsorption. The incorporation of organic moieties into siliceous frameworks leads {{to a wide variety of}} adsorbate–adsorbent interactions including weak Van-der-Waals attractions as well as strong interactions such as Coulomb forces. Depending on the desired properties of such substituted highly porous matrix materials, optimized synthesis routes can be established to enhance the desired internal pore surface–affinity towards certain volatile compounds. Based on a fundamental knowledge of the host–guest system, sorption related applications may benefit from individually fine-tuned and modified sample materials. The sorption isotherms and isosteric heat of adsorption for non-modified, phenyl- Summary IIIIIIIII modified, cyano-modified, vinyl-modified and mercapto-functionalized mesoporous material for ethanol and 1 -butanol sorption were determined. Additionally, nanosized zeolites, like ZSM- 5, Sil- 1 and zeolite beta were investigated (chapter 6). Furthermore, sorption isotherms of vaporized toluene on non-modified and phenyl-functionalized mesoporous silica samples were determined using the gravimetric QCM technique at different temperatures. The mesoporous silica was modified by in situ via co-condensation and via post-synthesis grafting approaches, respectively. All samples were thoroughly characterized by several standard techniques and additionally with toluene sorption experiments on the automated QCM setup. The different heats of <b>adsorption</b> <b>of</b> <b>toluene</b> <b>on</b> the various modified silica surfaces obtained by the sorption data made it possible to gain additional information about the degree and type of surface functionalization. It is thus demonstrated that QCM studies can be a powerful and convenient tool for efficient investigations of functionalized mesoporous silica particles that yield valuable quantitative information on molecule-surface interactions (chapter 8) ...|$|E

Ethanol deprives the surface oxygen, thereby generating oxygen defects whose concentration was evaluated by FTIR, Photoluminescence (PL) and Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) studies. FTIR analysis reveal that concentration of oxygen vacancies/defects (Vo) decreases as the nitrogen concentration increases leading to {{the reduction in the}} Ti-O bond length. This results in a shift of the IR absorption peak towards a low wave number as predicted by simple physical harmonic oscillator model. The Ti 2 p 3 / 2 XPS spectra of TiO 2 -xNx shifts to lower binding energies due to the increase in the electron densities around the Ti atoms indicating the formation of Ti 3 + in the doped samples.

The statistical-mechanical 3 D-RISM-KH molecular theory of solvation predicts the adsorption configuration and thermodynamics from the 3 D site density distribution functions and total solvation free energy, respectively, for <b>adsorption</b> <b>of</b> HAC and <b>toluene</b> <b>on</b> kaolinite. Spectrophotometric measurements show that, among the HAC studied, only acridine and phenanthridine adsorb quantitatively on kaolinite. For these pyridinic HAC, the adsorption results fitted to the Langmuir isotherm in the monolayer domain suggest a uniform monolayer of HAC molecules. The 3 D-RISM-KH studies predict that the aluminum hydroxide surface of kaolinite is preferred for HAC adsorption due to strong hydrogen bonding with the pyridinic N atoms, {{while the rest of the}} HAC adsorb weaker. Adsorption on the silicon oxide side is weak and delocalized, as evident from the 3 D solvation free energy density.

Therefore, it is suggested that benzyl species are the active intermediates from toluene to carbon oxides during the gasification gas cleaning over ZrO 2 -based catalysts...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{microdialysis}} {{technique was}} applied to detect {{the changes in the}} activity of acetylcholine (ACh) neurons in the rat brain. The effects of intraperitoneal (i. p.) injection <b>of</b> <b>toluene</b> <b>on</b> the amount <b>of</b> ACh release from the nerve terminals of the brain cholinergic neurons were investigated in freely moving rats. In the striatum, injection <b>of</b> <b>toluene</b> decreased the extracellular concentration of ACh in a dose dependent manner in the range 200 to 2, 000 mg/kg. Similar effects <b>of</b> <b>toluene</b> <b>on</b> ACh release were observed in the hippocampus after i. p. administration. The increases in ACh content in brain homogenate after i. p. injection <b>of</b> <b>toluene</b> seemed to be caused by the decreased release of ACh from cholinergic nerve endings. Injection <b>of</b> <b>toluene</b> at doses higher than 200 mg/kg decreased ACh release and a similar decrease was suggested to occur in 8 -h inhalation exposure to toluene at 1, 000 ppm or higher concentrations.

40|$|Low-cost {{materials}} of natural origin such as chitin and chitosan {{were found to}} effectively remove toluene from aqueous solutions. Batch adsorption experiments for the removal <b>of</b> <b>toluene</b> (5 – 200 mg/L) were conducted to obtain the isotherm profile. The effects of various parameters such as initial concentrations, adsorbent dose, and contact time on the removal performance <b>of</b> <b>toluene</b> were evaluated. Chitosan shows better removal efficiency, compared to chitin, {{both in terms of}} the level <b>of</b> <b>toluene</b> adsorbed per unit mass of adsorbent and in terms <b>of</b> the <b>adsorption</b> kinetics. Adsorption capacity in the range of 33 %– 58 % efficiency was obtained when the chitosan materials were used. The adsorption data <b>on</b> <b>toluene</b> were found to best fit the Langmuir and Redlich–Peterson isotherm models. The kinetic studies revealed that the <b>adsorption</b> <b>of</b> <b>toluene</b> followed the pseudo-second-order rate model. Overall, the study demonstrated that chitosan is a potential adsorbent for the removal <b>of</b> <b>toluene</b> at concentrations as high as 200 mg/L...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the removal <b>of</b> <b>toluene</b> from gaseous solution through Glycyrrhiza glabra root (GGR) as a waste material. The batch adsorption experiments were conducted at various conditions including contact time, adsorbate concentration, humidity, and temperature. The adsorption capacity was increased by raising the sorbent humidity up to 50 percent. The <b>adsorption</b> <b>of</b> <b>toluene</b> was also increased over contact time by 12 [*]h when the sorbent was saturated. The pseudo-second-order kinetic model and Freundlich model fitted the adsorption data better than other kinetic and isotherm models, respectively. The Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) isotherm also showed that the sorption by GGR was physical in nature. The results of the thermodynamic analysis illustrated that the adsorption process is exothermic.

40|$|<b>Adsorption</b> <b>of</b> some organic guest {{molecules}} in tetra-phosphorylated calix[4]-resorcinolarene LB films was studied by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) techniques. Two methods of registration have been used: {{measurement of the}} whole SPR curve at steady state <b>of</b> <b>adsorption</b> and in situ registration of SPR signal at fixed angle during adsorption. Fast and reversible <b>adsorption</b> <b>of</b> <b>toluene</b> and different hydrocarbon vapours was observed. Increasing both him thickness and refractive index implied the swelling behaviour of the LB film during adsorption and {{can be explained by}} the capturing and subsequent condensation of guest {{molecules in}} the calixarene matrix. Selectivity of SPR response to various hydrocarbons can be attributed to the difference of their condensation temperatures rather than to molecular dimensions. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science S. A...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{cellular}} response of the solvent-tolerant Pseudomonas putida S 12 to toluene as the single effector. Proteomic analysis (two-dimensional difference-in-gel-electrophoresis) was used to assess the response of P. putida S 12 cultured in chemostats. This approach ensures constant growth conditions, both in the presence and absence <b>of</b> <b>toluene.</b> A considerable negative effect <b>of</b> <b>toluene</b> <b>on</b> the cell yield was found. The need for energy in the defence against toluene was reflected by differentially expressed proteins for cell energy management. In toluene-stressed cells the balance between proton motive force (PMF) enforcing and dissipating systems was shifted. NAD(P) H generating systems were upregulated whereas the major proton-driven system, ATP synthase, was downregulated. Other differentially expressed proteins were identified: outer membrane proteins, transport proteins, stress-related proteins and translation-related proteins. In addition, a protein with no assigned function was found. This study yielded a more detailed view of the effect <b>of</b> <b>toluene</b> <b>on</b> the intracellular energy management of P. putida S 12 and several novel leads have been obtained for further targeted investigations. © 2006 The Authors...|$|R
40|$|Volatile organic {{solvents}} such as toluene are voluntarily inhaled {{for their}} intoxicating effects. Solvent use is especially prevalent among adolescents, and {{is associated with}} deficits {{in a wide range}} of cognitive tasks including attention, behavioral control, and risk assessment. Despite these findings, little is known about the effects <b>of</b> <b>toluene</b> <b>on</b> brain areas mediating these behaviors. In this study, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were used to determine the effect <b>toluene</b> <b>on</b> neurons within the medial PFC, a region critically involved in cognitive function. Toluene had no effect on measures of intrinsic excitability, but enhanced stimulus-evoked γ-amino butyric acid A-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs). In the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX) to block action potentials, toluene increased the frequency and amplitude of miniature IPSCs. In contrast, toluene induced a delayed but persistent decrease in evoked or spontaneous AMPA-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs). This effect was prevented by an intracellular calcium chelator or by the ryanodine receptor and SERCA inhibitors, dantrolene or thapsigargin, respectively, suggesting that toluene may mobilize intracellular calcium pools. The toluene-induced reduction in AMPA EPSCs was also prevented by a cannabinoid receptor (CB 1 R) antagonist, and was occluded by the CB 1 agonist WIN 55, 212 - 2 that itself induced a profound decrease in AMPA-mediated EPSCs. Toluene had no effect on the frequency or amplitude of miniature EPSCs recorded in the presence <b>of</b> TTX. Finally, <b>toluene</b> dose-dependently inhibited N-methyl [...] aspartate (NMDA) -mediated EPSCs and the magnitude and reversibility of this effect was CB 1 R sensitive indicating both direct and indirect actions <b>of</b> <b>toluene</b> <b>on</b> NMDA-mediated responses. Together, these results suggest that the effect <b>of</b> <b>toluene</b> <b>on</b> cognitive behaviors may result from its action on inhibitory and excitatory synaptic transmission of PFC neurons...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) {{released}} into indoor air of confined spaces {{increase the risk}} of pulmonary diseases for numerous people. This study is a first approach to determine the <b>adsorption</b> <b>of</b> hardened cement pastes exposed to VOCs and aims to enhance this phenomenon by using activated carbon as cement additive. The entrapment of acetaldehyde by the cement-based hydrates is quantified and is confirmed by testing hardened cement paste. However, the abatement of acetaldehyde tends to decrease due to carbonation or in presence of a significant relative humidity. The <b>adsorption</b> <b>of</b> <b>toluene</b> by reference cement pastes is negligible but is significantly improved by the addition of a small fraction of activated carbon powder into the mix. The desorption <b>of</b> <b>toluene</b> is not detected after the heating of the hardened cement pastes until 50 degrees C, justifying the study of a new range of construction materials limiting the VOCs-based air-pollution in confined spaces...|$|R

40|$|Toluene is {{ubiquitous}} solvent commonly inhaled recreationally. Despite its {{frequency of}} misuse, {{there is little}} understanding <b>of</b> how <b>toluene</b> acts within the brain. To examine this, this master 2 ̆ 7 s thesis examined the impact <b>of</b> acutely inhaled <b>toluene</b> <b>on</b> dopamine (DA) release in the mouse CPu in vivo using microdialysis techniques. Toluene inhalation produced dose-dependent increases in DA levels as well as changes in locomotor activity.

Pore filling by water, however, is less complete. When water and toluene vapor are simultaneously present, they coexist in the pores, toluene being the dominant component and water accounting for about 12 % of the total adsorbate.
