50|$|The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>whitefish</b> has {{a typical}} salmonid body shape and is silvery {{on the sides}} and {{underside}} with a dark blue to dark green back. The landlocked populations feed on insects and small fish. The reproduction of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>whitefish</b> in nature has not been observed.|$|E
50|$|The {{narrowly}} endemic <b>Atlantic</b> <b>whitefish</b> is genetically {{distinct from}} the lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) and the cisco (Coregonus artedi), which both are widespread across much of continental North America.|$|E
50|$|Three of {{the lakes}} on Petite Rivière (Hebb, Millipisigate and Minamkeak) {{are the only}} known habitat of the <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Whitefish.</b> Through damming of the lakes, some of the water that once fed the Medway River now flows through the Petite Rivière system. There was a water aerodrome at Fancy Lake.|$|E
50|$|Fish {{found within}} this lake include smallmouth bass, lake <b>whitefish,</b> <b>atlantic</b> salmon, white sucker, rainbow trout, rock bass, {{landlocked}} salmon, chain pickerel, brown bullhead, yellow perch, pumpkinseed sunfish, and splake. Anglers {{have the opportunity}} to fish for warm water species and trout because of the unique contour of lake. Rainbow trout have also been known to enter into West Caroga Lake through the channel from East Caroga Lake.|$|R
5000|$|Angling for Yellowstone {{cutthroat}} trout in Yellowstone Lake {{has been a}} popular pastime for both subsistence and recreation since the first explorers, surveyors and tourists visited the park. During {{the early days of}} fish stocking in Yellowstone (1890-1910), <b>Atlantic</b> Salmon, Mountain <b>whitefish</b> and Rainbow trout were stocked in the lake. None of these introduced species survived. [...] Today only native cutthroat and non-native Lake trout exist in the lake. [...] Today, Yellowstone Lake is open for angling from June 15 to the first Sunday in November. All Cutthroat trout caught must be released.|$|R
50|$|Dating {{back to the}} 1600s, Onondaga Lake {{has always}} shown reports of a cold-water system {{supporting}} certain types of fish. Around the late 1800s, degradation occurred and the fish that once thrived in the lake, such as the American eel, <b>Atlantic</b> Salmon and <b>Whitefish</b> declined. The decrease in population was resulting from the increase in temperatures because of severe pollution and human activities taking place. Even though the species are starting to gain popularity in this lake once again, the evidence shows that pollution had {{a direct impact on}} the fish that once inhabited this environment.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Atlantic</b> <b>whitefish</b> (Coregonus huntsmani) is a coregonine fish inhabiting some {{freshwater}} lakes within Nova Scotia, Canada. It {{is known}} to survive only in the Petite Rivière watershed as landlocked populations. Earlier it was {{also found in the}} Tusket and Annis rivers of Nova Scotia. Those populations were anadromous, migrating to the estuary to feed while breeding in freshwater.|$|E
50|$|C. huntsmani was {{originally}} designated Coregonus canadensis, but the species name was changed in 1987. Other common names that C. huntsmani is known by are Acadian whitefish and sault whitefish. The species was designated as {{an endangered species}} by the World Conservation Union in 1986 and vulnerable in 1996. Nova Scotia prohibited the taking of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>whitefish</b> under the Canadian Fisheries Act.|$|E
5000|$|The round {{whitefish}} (Prosopium cylindraceum) is a freshwater {{species of}} fish that is found in lakes from Alaska to New England, including the Great Lakes. It has an olive-brown back with light silvery sides and underside and its length is generally between 9 and 19 in. They are bottom feeders, feeding mostly on invertebrates, such as crustaceans, insect larvae, and fish eggs. Some other fish species, like white sucker in turn eat their eggs. Lake trout, northern pike and burbot are natural predators. Other common names of the round whitefish are menominee, pilot fish, frost fish, round-fish, and menominee whitefish. The common name [...] "round whitefish" [...] is also sometimes used to describe Coregonus huntsmani, a salmonid more {{commonly known as the}} <b>Atlantic</b> <b>whitefish.</b>|$|E
5000|$|First Roach Pond is {{the largest}} of the Roach Ponds and extends across the north part of Frenchtown Township. Roach River enters {{the north side of the}} pond 2 mi {{downstream}} of Second Roach Pond, and overflows a dam at the west end of First Roach Pond 6 mi upstream of Moosehead Lake. Spawning tributaries Inlet Brook enters the east end of the pond, and Lagoon Brook enters the south shore of the pond near the dam. The pond offers good habitat for lake trout and land-locked <b>Atlantic</b> salmon. Lake <b>whitefish</b> disappeared from the pond in the 1970s, and brook trout populations have been declining since yellow perch became established in the 1990s. The outlet dam is intended to provide a barrier against migration of white perch and smallmouth bass from Moosehead Lake.|$|R
5000|$|Torch Lake at 19 mi long is Michigan's longest inland {{lake and}} at {{approximately}} 18,770 acres (76 km²) is Michigan's second largest inland lake. Surrounding it are several townships including Torch Lake Township, Central Lake Township, Forest Home Township, Helena Township, and Milton Township in Antrim County and Clearwater Township in Kalkaska County, Michigan. Several villages and hamlets lie along its shore, including Alden, Eastport, Clam River, and Torch Lake. The lake is about 17 miles (27 km) northeast of Traverse City and is separated by narrow strips of land from both Grand Traverse Bay {{on the northwest}} and Elk Lake at the southwest end. The lake is about two miles (3.2 km) wide and is centered at [...] It has a maximum depth of 285 ft just off {{the east end of}} Campbell Rd. (Milton Twp.) and an average depth of 111 ft, making it Michigan's deepest inland lake. It is a popular lake for fishing, featuring lake trout, rock bass, yellow perch, smallmouth bass, muskellunge, Pike, ciscoes, brown trout, steelhead, rainbow trout, <b>atlantic</b> salmon and <b>whitefish.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to office and research space, BIO has extensive laboratories, particularly for performing research into aquatic species. Tours of BIO are offered for visitors {{during the summer}} months and a popular tour destination are some of the large aquariums and tanks used for research. There are also [...] "touch tanks" [...] in a facility called the Sea Pavilion where visitors are permitted to handle North Atlantic Lobster, Snow Crabs, Rock Crabs, Clams (also known as Pea Clams), Sea Urchins, Sea Cucumbers, and other species. Some tanks are transparent and allow visitors to view giant mackerel and sturgeon as well as other rare and interesting specimens such as a lobster that is half male and half female. The Sea Pavilion contains information concerning Leatherback Sea Turtles, <b>Atlantic</b> <b>Whitefish,</b> Northern Right Whales, sharks, Lake Whitefish, Largemouth Bass, Brook Trout, Atlantic Wolffish, and Atlantic Pickerel. There are also displays featuring protected areas such as Sable Island and The Gully and special interest areas such as Halifax Harbour and the Bay of Fundy.|$|E
50|$|Other dishes {{came about}} {{during the early}} 20th century and {{have much to do}} with {{delicatessen}} fare, set up largely by Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe who came to America incredibly poor and most often unable to partake in the outdoor food markets that the general population utilized. The influence of European Jewry on modern mid-Atlantic cooking remains extremely strong and reinforced by their many descendants in the region. American-style pickles were brought by Polish Jews, now a common addition to hamburgers and sandwiches, and Hungarian Jews brought a recipe for almond horns that now is a common regional cookie, diverting from the original recipe in dipping the ends in dark chocolate. New York-style cheesecake has copious amounts of cream and eggs because animal rennet is not kosher and thus could not be sold to a large number of the deli's clientele. New York inherited its bagels and bialys from Jews, as well as Challah bread, the bread today most favored for making french toast in New York, New Jersey, and eastern Pennsylvania. Pastrami first entered the country via Romanian Jews, and is a feature of many sandwiches, often eaten on marble rye, a bread that was born in the mid <b>Atlantic.</b> <b>Whitefish</b> salad, lox, and matzoh ball soup are now standard fare made to order at local diners and delicatessens, but started their life as foods that made up a strict dietary code.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. —The {{scope of}} {{phenetic}} variation exhibited by populations of lake whitefish Coregonus clupeaformis in the Canadian Maritime Provinces is not known, which complicates {{the task of}} accurately identifying specimens of the endangered <b>Atlantic</b> <b>whitefish</b> C. huntsmani. We developed criteria for accurate (95 % correct classification) species discrimination using morphological data acquired from archival and recent coregonid collections from the Maritime Provinces. We used discriminant function analyses to assess (1) the usefulness of <b>Atlantic</b> <b>whitefish</b> external typological characters in accurately identifying species, (2) the temporal stability of reportedly diagnostic characters, and (3) which morphological characters {{could be used to}} accurately identify these coregonids to species. Not all external typological characters were robust in the discrimination of recent <b>Atlantic</b> <b>whitefish</b> and lake whitefish collections. Several previously identified diagnostic characters exhibited significant temporal variation but remained robust in species discrimination. Species-specific differences for the number of lateral line scales, mouth position, and proportional pectoral fin length could be used concomitantly for accurate (95 % correct classification) identification of coregonid species in the Canadian Maritime Provinces. <b>Atlantic</b> <b>whitefish</b> possessed a significantly (P, 0. 001) greater number of lateral line scales (range 90 – 102; mean 6 SD 93. 79 6 2. 70) than lake whitefish (range 66 – 91; mean 77. 18 6 4. 21), a significantly (P, 0. 01) shorter pectoral fin than lake whitefish (11 % and 16...|$|E
