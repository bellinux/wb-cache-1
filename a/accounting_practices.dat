5|$|Enron's {{aggressive}} <b>accounting</b> <b>practices</b> {{were not}} {{hidden from the}} board of directors, as later learned by a Senate subcommittee. The board was informed of the rationale for using the Whitewing, LJM, and Raptor transactions, and after approving them, received status updates on the entities' operations. Although not all of Enron's widespread improper <b>accounting</b> <b>practices</b> were revealed to the board, the practices were dependent on board decisions. Even though Enron extensively relied on derivatives for its business, the company's Finance Committee and board {{did not have enough}} experience with derivatives to understand what they were being told. The Senate subcommittee argued that had there been a detailed understanding of how the derivatives were organized, the board would have prevented their use.|$|E

The bank claims a loan recovery rate of 96.67%, up from the 95% recovery rate claimed in 1998. David Roodman has critiqued the <b>accounting</b> <b>practices</b> that Grameen used to determine this rate.|$|E
5|$|Enron {{was formed}} in 1985 by Kenneth Lay after merging Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth. Several years later, when Jeffrey Skilling was hired, he {{developed}} a staff of executives that – {{by the use of}} accounting loopholes, special purpose entities, and poor financial reporting – were able to hide billions of dollars in debt from failed deals and projects. Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and other executives not only misled Enron's board of directors and audit committee on high-risk <b>accounting</b> <b>practices,</b> but also pressured Arthur Andersen to ignore the issues.|$|E

40|$|Although {{institutions}} play significant {{roles in}} ensuring {{a high quality}} of <b>accounting</b> <b>practice,</b> their impact is not well understood {{in the context of}} Nigeria. Drawing on the perception of users and compliers of accounting information, this study empirically investigates the impact of state institutions on the quality of <b>accounting</b> <b>practice</b> in Nigeria. The results of this study, using multiple regression analysis, indicate the impact of state institutions on the quality of <b>accounting</b> <b>practice</b> in Nigeria is fairly significant. Though joint significance was observed, however, the level of impact differs among the institutions. This implies that regulations are not adequate in ensuring a high level quality of <b>accounting</b> <b>practice</b> in Nigeria. These findings provide support for the need to streamline, strengthen and harmonize existing regulatory arrangements in Nigeria with a view to codifying as separate laws to enhance their effectiveness. Thus, inconsistencies in the provisions of the institutions and differences in the assessment of the quality of <b>accounting</b> <b>practice</b> by the relevant bodies would be minimised and monitoring and enforcement of regulations enhance...|$|R
5|$|Enron's auditor firm, Arthur Andersen, {{was accused}} of {{applying}} reckless standards in its audits because of {{a conflict of interest}} over the significant consulting fees generated by Enron. During 2000, Arthur Andersen earned $25 million in audit fees and $27 million in consulting fees (this amount accounted for roughly 27% of the audit fees of public clients for Arthur Andersen's Houston office). The auditor's methods were questioned as either being completed solely to receive its annual fees or for its lack of expertise in properly reviewing Enron's revenue recognition, special entities, derivatives, and other <b>accounting</b> <b>practices.</b>|$|E
5|$|Enron's audit {{committee}} was later criticized for its brief meetings that would cover {{large amounts of}} material. In one meeting on February 12, 2001, the committee met {{for an hour and}} a half. Enron's {{audit committee}} did not have the technical knowledge to question the auditors properly on accounting issues related to the company's special purpose entities. The committee was also unable to question the company's management due to pressures on the committee. The United States Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Committee on Governmental Affairs' report accused the board members of allowing conflicts of interest to impede their duties as monitoring the company's <b>accounting</b> <b>practices.</b> When Enron's scandal became public, the audit committee's conflicts of interest were regarded with suspicion.|$|E
5|$|Explicit {{goals of}} {{financial}} regulation include countries' pursuits of financial stability and the safeguarding of unsophisticated market players from fraudulent activity, while implicit goals include offering viable and competitive financial environments to world investors. A single nation with functioning governance, financial regulations, deposit insurance, emergency financing through discount windows, standard <b>accounting</b> <b>practices,</b> and established legal and disclosure procedures, can itself develop and grow a healthy domestic financial system. In a global context however, no central political authority exists which can extend these arrangements globally. Rather, governments have cooperated {{to establish a}} host of institutions and practices that have evolved over time and are referred to collectively as the international financial architecture. Within this architecture, regulatory authorities such as national governments and intergovernmental organizations {{have the capacity to}} influence international financial markets. National governments may employ their finance ministries, treasuries, and regulatory agencies to impose tariffs and foreign capital controls or may use their central banks to execute a desired intervention in the open markets.|$|E

40|$|Most sale {{proceeds}} from <b>accounting</b> <b>practice</b> transfers are allocable to goodwill {{despite the fact}} that neither sellers nor buyers generate significant profit from ordinary operations. Widely held valuation models hold that goodwill value is driven exclusively by profit and that <b>accounting</b> <b>practice</b> investors ought to demand returns higher than those realized by publicly traded equity investors. The existence of transferable goodwill without operating profit thus seems anomalous. This paper demonstrates that risk reducing sales terms explain these anomalies. As these sales terms are not necessarily unique to <b>accounting</b> <b>practice</b> transfers, the implications for valuation theory are quite significant. ...|$|R
