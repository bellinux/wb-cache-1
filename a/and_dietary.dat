The {{objective}} of the research was to examine employees’ perceived barriers and facilitators of physical activity <b>and</b> healthy <b>dietary</b> choices, <b>and</b> managers’ perceptions of how to facilitate physical activity <b>and</b> healthy <b>dietary</b> choices among their team members. Design. A cross-sectional and qualitative design was used. Setting. Participants were employees from a large public sector organisation (N= 121), who were asked about the barriers to and facilitators of maintaining regular exercise <b>and</b> healthy <b>dietary</b> choices. Managers were additionally asked about methods for facilitating physical activity <b>and</b> healthy <b>dietary</b> choices among their team members. Methods. The research used both quantitative and qualitative methodology, with categorical and open ended survey questions. Results. Thematic analysis revealed similar themes for both physical activity <b>and</b> healthy <b>dietary</b> choices, with participants citing working patterns, commuting times, family commitments, job characteristics, and lack of motivation as barriers to exercise <b>and</b> healthy <b>dietary</b> choices. Both employees and managers identified similar facilitators of exercise <b>and</b> healthy <b>dietary</b> choices, such as improved information, facilities, and working routines. Conclusion. The results provide an insight into the perceived barriers and facilitators to adopting a healthy lifestyle among a sample of employees with differing shift patterns and job roles. The results are discussed in relation to suggested methods for promoting physical activity <b>and</b> healthy <b>dietary</b> choices at work...|$|R

5|$|Four {{other species}} of hammerhead sharks overlap in range with the smalleye hammerhead: the small-sized scoophead and bonnethead, and the large-sized {{scalloped}} hammerhead and great hammerhead. Little competition occurs between these species because of their differing habitats <b>and</b> <b>dietary</b> preferences. The smalleye hammerhead is the dominant hammerhead in shallow, muddy areas, where high turbidity limits the utility of vision (hence its smaller eyes).

40|$|Background: Various diet- and activity-related {{parenting}} {{practices are}} positive determinants of child <b>dietary</b> <b>and</b> activity behaviour, including home availability, parental modelling and parental policies. There {{is evidence that}} parenting practices cluster within the <b>dietary</b> domain <b>and</b> within the activity domain. This study explores whether diet- and activity-related parenting practices cluster across the <b>dietary</b> <b>and</b> activity domain. Also examined is whether the clusters are related to child and parental background characteristics. Finally, to indicate {{the relevance of the}} clusters in influencing child <b>dietary</b> <b>and</b> activity behaviour, we examined whether clusters of parenting practices are related to these behaviours. Methods: Data were used from 1480 parent-child dyads participating in the Dutch IVO Nutrition and Physical Activity Child cohorT (INPACT). Parents of children aged 8 - 11 years completed questionnaires at home assessing their diet- and activity-related parenting practices, child and parental background characteristics, <b>and</b> child <b>dietary</b> <b>and</b> activity behaviours. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to identify clusters of parenting practices. Backward regression analysis was used {{to examine the relationship between}} child and parental background characteristics with cluster scores, and partial correlations to examine associations between cluster scores <b>and</b> child <b>dietary</b> <b>and</b> activity behaviours. Results: PCA revealed five clusters of parenting practices: 1) high visibility and accessibility of screens and unhealthy food, 2) diet- and activity-related rules, 3) low availability of unhealthy food, 4) diet- and activity-related positive modelling, and 5) positive modelling on sports and fruit. Low parental education was associated with unhealthy cluster 1, while high(er) education was associated with healthy clusters 2, 3 and 5. Separate clusters were related to both child <b>dietary</b> <b>and</b> activity behaviour in the hypothesized directions: healthy clusters were positively related to obesity-reducing behaviours and negatively to obesity-inducing behaviours. Conclusion: Parenting practices cluster across the <b>dietary</b> <b>and</b> activity domain. Parental education can be seen as an indicator of a broader parental context in which clusters of parenting practices operate. Separate clusters are related to both child <b>dietary</b> <b>and</b> activity behaviour. Interventions that focus on clusters of parenting practices to assist parents (especially low-educated parents) in changing their child's <b>dietary</b> <b>and</b> activity behaviour seems justified...|$|R
5|$|Dysphagia and dysarthria: {{dysphagia}} is {{a difficulty}} with eating and swallowing which may cause choking and aspiration of food or liquid into the lungs, while dysarthria is a neurological motor speech disorder characterized by poor {{control over the}} subsystems and muscles responsible for speech ("articulation"). A {{speech and language therapist}} may give advice on specific swallowing techniques, on adapting food consistencies <b>and</b> <b>dietary</b> intake, on techniques to improve and maintain speech production and clarity, and on alternative communication approaches. In the case of advanced dysphagia, food can be supplied by a nasogastric tube, which is a tube that goes through the nose directly to the stomach; or a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), which is a procedure for placing a tube into the stomach and therefore administering food directly to it. This second system, although more invasive, has better results in the long term than nasogastric intake.|$|E
5|$|Other sources include {{fortified}} food <b>and</b> <b>dietary</b> supplements in various forms. A 1998 review concluded that zinc oxide, {{one of the}} most common supplements in the United States, and zinc carbonate are nearly insoluble and poorly absorbed in the body. This review cited studies that found lower plasma zinc concentrations in the subjects who consumed zinc oxide and zinc carbonate than in those who took zinc acetate and sulfate salts. For fortification, however, a 2003 review recommended cereals (containing zinc oxide) as a cheap, stable source that is as easily absorbed as the more expensive forms. A 2005 study found that various compounds of zinc, including oxide and sulfate, did not show statistically significant differences in absorption when added as fortificants to maize tortillas.|$|E
5|$|Prized as an {{ingredient}} in various foods, B.edulis is an edible mushroom held in high regard in many cuisines, and is commonly prepared and eaten in soups, pasta, or risotto. The mushroom {{is low in}} fat and digestible carbohydrates, and high in protein, vitamins, minerals <b>and</b> <b>dietary</b> fibre. Although it is sold commercially, {{it is very difficult}} to cultivate. Available fresh in autumn in Central, Southern and Northern Europe, it is most often dried, packaged and distributed worldwide. It keeps its flavour after drying, and it is then reconstituted and used in cooking. B.edulis is one of the few fungi sold pickled. The fungus also produces a variety of organic compounds with a diverse spectrum of biological activity, including the steroid derivative ergosterol, a sugar binding protein, antiviral compounds, antioxidants, and phytochelatins, which give the organism resistance to toxic heavy metals.|$|E

SETTING: The studies eligible for review were from five countries/regions: USA (n 6), Europe (n 4), Australia (n 1), Middle East (n 1) and South Africa (n 1). SUBJECTS: Adolescents aged 10 to 19 years. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were eligible for inclusion. None of the studies investigated all aspects of food literacy. Eight studies reported a positive association between food literacy <b>and</b> adolescents' <b>dietary</b> intake. For example, adolescents with greater food knowledge and frequent food preparation behaviours were shown to have healthier dietary practices. Three studies found a mixed association of food literacy <b>and</b> adolescents' <b>dietary</b> intake. For example, adolescents who frequently helped to prepare dinner had healthier dietary intake, but food shopping tasks were associated with less healthy food choices. Two studies found no association between measures of food literacy <b>and</b> adolescents' <b>dietary</b> intake.
