At another place we had seen before, we dug and found some more corn, two or three baskets full, {{and a bag of}} beans....In <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> about ten bushels, which will be enough for seed. It is with God's help that we found this corn, for how else could we have done it, without meeting some Indians who might trouble us.|$|E

He really became involved, more so than in county games. He even made a marked difference to our one day performances when he returned for a season of Sunday League games in the early 1970s.|$|E

25|$|We {{did some}} rather audacious things. We shot {{on top of}} a train in Train Town in Griffith Park without a permit, while one of us was given one of the guards money and another of us was talking to another guard, just so we could get the shots finished. We knew we couldn't be there long. <b>All</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to do was do our legerdemain for five or ten minutes and be out of there. And we {{certainly}} couldn't pay for it.|$|E
500|$|... {{was a fun}} song to do. Mariah {{brought me}} 'Genius of Love' and I laid some strings on {{it and put it}} into a groove I felt really fit and {{highlighted}} her voice. And that song didn't take us but a minute to do, because she really busted that out within two days. We did a rough copy and let Tommy Mottola hear it and he loved it, so <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to do was bring it back in and mix it.|$|E
500|$|Cavallo {{was chosen}} as the main {{producer}} of the album, with Jerry Finn as the mixer. Green Day originally gave the first demo tape to Cavallo, and after listening to it during the car ride home he sensed that [...] " [...] had stumbled on something big." [...] The band's recording session lasted three weeks and the album was remixed twice. Armstrong claimed that the band wanted to create a dry sound, [...] "similar to the Sex Pistols' album or first Black Sabbath albums." [...] The band felt the original mix to be unsatisfactory. Cavallo agreed, and it was remixed at Fantasy Studios in Berkeley, California. Armstrong later said of their studio experience, [...] "Everything was already written, <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to do was play it." ...|$|E

500|$|Rimsky-Korsakov felt talented {{students}} needed little formal dictated instruction. His teaching method included distinct steps: show the students everything needed in harmony and counterpoint; direct them {{in understanding the}} forms of composition; give them {{a year or two}} of systematic study in the development of technique, exercises in free composition and orchestration; instill a good knowledge of the piano. Once these were properly completed, studies would be over. He carried this attitude into his conservatory classes. Conductor Nikolai Malko remembered that Rimsky-Korsakov began the first class of the term by saying, [...] "I will speak, and you will listen. Then I will speak less, and you will start to work. And finally I will not speak at all, and you will work." [...] Malko added that his class followed exactly this pattern. [...] "Rimsky-Korsakov explained everything so clearly and simply that <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to do was to do our work well." ...|$|E
500|$|On 8 December, the Austro-Hungarians {{fell back}} against Užice and Valjevo. The Serbs {{anticipated}} that their opponents would entrench themselves {{and attempt to}} block the Serbian Army's advance, but the Austro-Hungarians had failed to construct any defensive networks and, as such, were {{in no position to}} block the Serbian offensive. The Austro-Hungarians had ensured that Valjevo's defenses were fortified and had laid down artillery plans for the town's defense, but their lack of prior preparation meant that the hills surrounding the town were devoid of any significant defensive positions. The Serbs exploited this weakness by manoeuvring around the hills and encircling the Austro-Hungarians, suffering minimal casualties. The Serbian 3rd Army then broke through the defenses of the 6th Army at Mount Suvobor and stormed Valjevo. In Niš, the Bulgarian ambassador to Serbia reported: [...] "The most improbable news from the battleground, sweet to the Serb ear, has been going around since this morning." [...] He wrote that, in the last three to four days, the Serbian Army had captured one Austro-Hungarian General, 49 officers and more than 20,000 troops, as well as 40 cannon and [...] "huge quantities of war matériel". By 9 December, the Austro-Hungarian counter-offensive around Belgrade lost its momentum and the Austro-Hungarians began to retreat back towards the city centre. One Austro-Hungarian soldier wrote: [...] "We could not have imagined that the Serbs were on our heels, after <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> recently been victorious." [...] On 10 December, the Serbian Army captured the lower reaches of the Drina, forcing the majority of surviving Austro-Hungarian troops to flee across the river. They did not stop until they had crossed the Sava and the Danube and entered the Banat. Very few Austro-Hungarian soldiers made it back into Bosnia.|$|E

Sometimes when you listen back bits of it sound quite punk. I liked Gary Glitter, Hello, Slade; they were all laying the roots to punk. Some of Bowie and Lou Reed were very good and [...] Bolan of course. I suppose it {{had a bit of}} influence, but not a lot."– Knox from the Vibrators citing glam rock acts, {{including}} Glitter, as an influence on punk.|$|E

2500|$|After {{arriving}} in Britain, the three couples lived in separate accommodation across London and struggled financially. They met {{to perform their}} missionary activities – which included kirtans (public chanting), attending notable public events, the distribution of promotional leaflets in busy areas such as Oxford Street, and the cultivation of new members. Having previously relied on the generosity of the local Indian community, they eventually settled in a warehouse complex in Covent Garden, which also served as their temporary temple. Malati later recalled of this early period in England: [...] " [...] hardly any possessions, no money, no protection. It often got very cold … <b>All</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> was love for Srila Prabhupada." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1945 {{she fell}} in love with {{director}} Roberto Rossellini while working on Roma, Città Aperta aka Rome, Open City (1945). [...] "I thought at last I had found the ideal man... had lost a son of his own and I felt we understood each other. Above <b>all,</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> the same artistic conceptions." [...] Rossellini had become violent, volatile and possessive, and they argued constantly about films or out of jealousy. [...] "In fits of rage they threw crockery at each other." [...] As artists, however, they complemented each other well while working on neorealist films. The two finally split apart when Rossellini fell in love with and married, Ingrid Bergman.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2000, Morales {{defeated}} Marco Antonio Barrera {{to win the}} WBO Super Bantamweight title, in a {{fight that}} {{is considered one of}} boxing's classics. Morales won the fight by a controversial split decision. It was an intense battle in which both fighters were cut and battered. Many people thought Barrera had won the fight on a knockdown that he scored in the twelfth and final round. After the fight, Morales said, [...] "He was a brave fighter, and we both gave it <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>had.</b> We were both hurt during the fight. He was the biggest puncher I ever faced in the ring." [...] The Ring named it the Fight of the Year.|$|E

He periodically writes editorials on cricket and Pakistani politics in several leading Pakistani and British newspapers. It was revealed in 2008 that Khan's second book, Indus Journey: A Personal View of Pakistan, had required heavy editing from the publisher. [...] The publisher Jeremy Lewis revealed in a memoir {{that when he}} asked Khan to show his writing for publication, [...] "he handed me a leatherbound notebook or diary containing a few jottings and autobiographical snippets.
