5|$|Second in {{importance}} <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>supreme</b> deity, were over sixty ancestral gods of the Palmyrene clans. Palmyra had unique deities, {{such as the}} god of justice and Efqa's guardian Yarhibol, the sun god Malakbel, and the moon god Aglibol. Palmyrenes worshiped regional deities, including the greater Levantine gods Astarte, Baal-hamon, Baalshamin and Atargatis; the Babylonian gods Nabu and Nergal, and the Arab Azizos, Arsu, Šams and Al-lāt.|$|E

5|$|In October 2016, the U.S. {{state of}} Ohio {{announced}} that it would resume executions in January 2017, using a cocktail of midazolam, vecuronium bromide and potassium chloride but this was blocked by a Federal judge. On 25 July 2017, Ronald Phillips was executed with a three-drug cocktail including midazolam <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court refused to grant a stay. Prior to this, the last execution in Ohio had been that of Dennis McGuire. Murderer Gary Otte's lawyers unsuccessfully challenged his Ohio execution, arguing that midazolam might not protect him from serious pain when the other drugs are administered. He died without incident in about 14 minutes on September 13, 2017.|$|E
5|$|Three vice-presidents succeeded to the {{presidency}} due {{to the death of}} presidents - Sergio Osmeña (1944), Elpidio Quirino (1948) and Carlos P. Garcia (1957). They did not nominate a new vice-president, since the 1935 constitution was silent on the matter; a new vice-president would sit after the results of following elections were known. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo became president <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court ruled that President Joseph Estrada resigned. Arroyo appointed Teofisto Guingona days after she ascended to power. The 1987 constitution mandated the President to nominate a vice-president from a member of the Congress of the Philippines, in which both houses vote separately for confirmation via a majority vote.|$|E

5|$|Harlan's {{nomination}} came shortly <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court {{handed down}} its landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education, declaring segregation {{in public schools}} unconstitutional. James Eastland (the chairman of the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary) and several other southern senators delayed his confirmation, because they (correctly) believed that he would support desegregation of the schools and civil rights. Unlike almost all previous Supreme Court nominees, Harlan appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee to answer questions relating to his judicial views. Every Supreme Court nominee since Harlan has been questioned by the Judiciary Committee before confirmation. The Senate finally confirmed him on March 17, 1955 {{by a vote of}} 71–11. He took seat on March 28, 1955. Of the eleven senators who voted against his appointment, nine were from the South. He was replaced on the Second Circuit by Joseph Edward Lumbard.|$|E
5|$|In March 2000, Zimbabwe's High Court {{ruled that}} the land invasions were illegal; they {{nevertheless}} continued, and Mugabe began vilifying Zimbabwe's judiciary. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court also backed this decision, the government called on its judges to resign, successfully pressuring chief justice Anthony Gubbay to do so. ZANU-PF member Godfrey Chidyausiku was appointed to replace him, {{while the number of}} Supreme Court judges was expanded from five to eight; the three additional seats went to pro-Mugabe figures. The first act of the new Supreme Court was to reverse the previous declaration that the land seizures were illegal. In November 2001, Mugabe issued a presidential decree permitting the expropriation of virtually all white-owned farms in Zimbabwe without compensation.|$|E
5|$|The 1982 {{amendment}} to the bailout eligibility standard went into effect on August 5, 1984. Between that date and 2013, 196 jurisdictions bailed out of coverage through 38 bailout actions; in each instance, the Attorney General consented to the bailout request. Between that date and 2009, all jurisdictions that bailed out were located in Virginia. In 2009, a municipal utility jurisdiction in Texas bailed out <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court's opinion in Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District No. 1 v. Holder (2009), which held that local governments that do not register voters {{have the ability to}} bail out. After this ruling, jurisdictions succeeded in at least 20 bailout actions before the Supreme Court held in Shelby County v. Holder (2013) that the coverage formula was unconstitutional.|$|E
