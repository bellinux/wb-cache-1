5|$|Along {{with other}} family members, Virginia Clemm and Edgar Allan Poe lived {{together}} off <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> {{several years before}} their marriage. The couple often moved to accommodate Poe's employment, living intermittently in Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York. A few years after their wedding, Poe {{was involved in a}} substantial scandal involving Frances Sargent Osgood and Elizabeth F. Ellet. Rumors about amorous improprieties on her husband's part affected Virginia Poe so much that on her deathbed she claimed that Ellet had murdered her. After her death, her body was eventually placed under the same memorial marker as her husband's in Westminster Hall and Burying Ground in Baltimore, Maryland. Only one image of Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe has been authenticated: a watercolor portrait painted several hours after her death.|$|E

25|$|The Orient Express {{kicked off}} a {{prolonged}} feud with The Rockers that started at WrestleMania VI, where Sato and Tanaka were victorious via countout. and continued off <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> {{well over a}} year. The Orient Express got involved in the Legion of Doom / Demolition feud as Mr. Fuji managed Demolition as well.

25|$|In April 1990, The Rockers faced new {{competition}} {{in the form of}} Pat Tanaka and Akio Sato, the newly signed team known as The Orient Express.

When Sato decided leave the American wrestling scene in December 1990, the WWF decided team Tanaka up with his former partner Paul Diamond under a mask. Tanaka and Diamond had previously teamed as Badd Company and won the AWA Tag Team Championship from The Rockers. The Rockers and The Orient Express had a high profile, high flying match at the Royal Rumble.|$|E
25|$|Twain {{initially}} {{conceived of}} the work as a sequel to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer that would follow Huckleberry Finn through adulthood. Beginning with a few pages he had removed from the earlier novel, Twain began work on a manuscript he originally titled Huckleberry Finn's Autobiography. Twain worked on the manuscript off <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> the next several years, ultimately abandoning his original plan of following Huck's development into adulthood. He appeared to have lost interest in the manuscript while it was in progress, and set it aside for several years. After making a trip down the Hudson River, Twain returned to {{his work on the}} novel. Upon completion, the novel's title closely paralleled its predecessor's: Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Tom Sawyer's Comrade).|$|E

25|$|In late September 1886, Thomas Carnegie {{fell ill}} {{with what he}} {{believed}} to be a cold. He was sick off <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> the next several weeks. On October 16, he left work thinking he was suffering from yet another cold, but died of pneumonia just three days later. His wife and all of his children except Margaret (who was attending a boarding school in New York) were at his bedside when he died. For most of his life, Thomas {{had been a member of}} the Swedenborgian Church. His funeral, however, was conducted by an Episcopalian, and Carnegie was buried on October 21, 1886, in Allegheny Cemetery in Pittsburgh. His mother, also quite ill for some time, died on November 10 (never learning of her younger son's death).|$|E
25|$|The DSMA {{was founded}} in 1992 as the Defence Services Institute of Medicine (DSIM) to develop {{physicians}} {{to serve in the}} Tatmadaw Myanmar Armed Forces. Prior to the founding of the academy, the Tatmadaw had recruited its medical and dental officers from civilian medical school graduates, who had to undergo a month-long basic military training program at the Medical Corps Center. While the medical corps of the Tatmadaw had always been short of physicians, by the early 1990s, the shortage became more pronounced as the military government, fearing student unrest, had shut down most civilian universities, following the 8888 Uprising in 1988. Most civilian universities were closed off <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> much of the 1990s. The military run universities essentially became the only venue for those who wished to continue university education inside the country.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} common breeds used in Russia is the German Shepherd. This is mainly because these dogs are adapted to the climate of the country. Attack dogs have been used for a long time, off <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> foot patrolling. These dogs are kept on a leash at all times and are {{required}} to wear a muzzle unless the dog is needed to pursue and detain a suspect. These dogs must remain calm, docile, and unfazed by crowds or noise. Russian Police Dogs may react to any and all stimuli only if they are ordered to do so by their handler. They are a common sight in the public and are often unnerving to the public. German shepherds are also used for tasks such as seeking dangerous fugitives, tracking, and were ultimately chosen as the all-purpose police and army breed. This has remained common in most Soviet Union Successor States.|$|E
25|$|Patric dated Danielle Schreiber off <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> {{approximately}} 10 years. During {{the relationship}} they conceived a son through in vitro fertilization. Patric and Schreiber separated in May 2012. Schreiber's attorneys argued that, under California law, Patric was a sperm donor as Schreiber and Patric had not married and {{the conception of}} the child was by artificial means, and therefore Patric has no custody rights to the son. Patric is currently pursuing changes to the law that bars his parental rights. He then sued for parental rights over the child, but lost the case at the trial court level. The Court of Appeal of California, however, also ruled that the CA Family Code did not preclude him from establishing that he was presumed a parent based on his post birth conduct. The case was sent {{back down to the}} trial court level, and in late 2014 he was recognized legally as the father of his son with the court granting him parental rights. Following his initial loss in trial court, he lobbied the California legislature to give parental rights to sperm donors.|$|E

500|$|Grant {{lived with}} actor Randolph Scott off <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> 12 years, which several authors have claimed was a gay relationship. The two had first met {{early on in}} Grant's career in 1932 at the Paramount studio when Scott was filming Sky Bride {{at the same time}} as Grant was {{shooting}} Sinners in the Sun, and moved in together soon afterwards. Scott's biographer Robert Nott states that there is no evidence that Grant and Scott were homosexual, and blames rumors on material written about them in other books, which was assumed true by historians. Grant's daughter, Jennifer, denied the claims. When Chevy Chase joked on television in 1980 that Grant was a [...] "homo. What a gal!", Grant sued him for slander, and Chase was forced to retract his words. Grant became a fan of Morecambe and Wise in the 1960s, and remained friends with Eric Morecambe until his death in 1984.|$|E
500|$|He {{also built}} a roughly semi-circular, terraced amphitheater at the {{foundation}} of the Pyramid which he called the [...] "foyer". He intended to rent this out and use the revenue for the pyramid project. The land for the amphitheater was first dug in late 1923, and construction continued off <b>and</b> <b>on</b> <b>for</b> the next five years whenever financing, building materials, and labor were available. Unlike other Monte Ne building projects designed by architect A. O. Clark, the amphitheater apparently had no architectural input and was not built according to blueprints or a single design. Those who worked with Harvey noted that he seemed to just [...] "work it out in his mind from day to day". The result was a unique structure, irregular in formation, with seating capacity for anywhere from 500 to 1,000. The amphitheater averaged [...] high and [...] long. In the middle of the amphitheater was a small island with two concrete chairs and a concrete couch, intended for an orchestra to play or a speaker to make a presentation. Harvey dedicated the amphitheater before 500 people in 1928.|$|E
