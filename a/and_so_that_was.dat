500|$|Actor John Noble {{called the}} {{beginning}} scene with Olivia and Walter naked [...] "the funniest thing" [...] yet, explaining [...] "The writers keep throwing challenges at me, because I never say no. They said, 'Okay, John, you’ll do a scene naked.' I said 'Okay.' <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> a big surprise. So I do this scene, this strange scene with Anna Torv, without any clothes on. Anna’s {{staying at the}} Bishop house with Walter running around with no clothes on except {{for a pair of}} slippers, getting breakfast. She comes round the corner and catches him in the full monty, going, 'Oh no!' Didn’t know where to look. That {{was probably one of the}} most fun things we ever did. Anna’s reaction was priceless to that. I haven’t seen the scene yet, but it was hilarious to do it." ...|$|E
60|$|She said to {{him ever}} so many times, graciously waving her tail, 'My son, when you find a Hedgehog you must drop him {{into the water and}} then he will uncoil, and when you catch a Tortoise you must scoop him out of his shell with your paw.' <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> all right, Best Beloved.|$|E
6000|$|THIS, O Best Beloved, {{is another}} story of the High and Far-Off Times. In the very middle of those times was a Stickly-Prickly Hedgehog, and he lived {{on the banks of}} the turbid Amazon, eating shelly snails and things. And he had a friend, a Slow-Solid Tortoise, who lived {{on the banks of the}} turbid Amazon, eating green {{lettuces}} and things. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> all right, Best Beloved. Do you see? ...|$|E

6000|$|One {{beautiful}} {{night on}} the banks of the turbid Amazon, Painted Jaguar found Stickly-Prickly Hedgehog and Slow-Solid Tortoise sitting under the trunk of a fallen tree. They could not run away, and so Stickly-Prickly curled himself up into a ball, because he was a Hedgehog, and Slow-Solid Tortoise drew in his head and feet into his shell as far as they would go, because he was a Tortoise; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> all right, Best Beloved. Do you see? ...|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> settled. As it happened, though Dick Shand {{had always}} been Dick to his friend, Caldigate had never, as yet, been either John or Jack to Dick Shand. There are men who fall into the way of being called by their Christian names, and others who never hear them except from their own family. But before the day was out, Caldigate had become John to both his companions. 'It don't sound as it ought to do;--not yet,' said Mick, after he had tried it about a dozen times in five minutes.|$|E
6000|$|He {{had come}} for the girl. His cousin had asked him in a note {{delivered}} by a messenger to go to Brighton at once and take [...] "his girl" [...] over from a gentleman named Fyne and give her house-room {{for a time in}} his family. And there he was. His business had not allowed him to some sooner. His business was the manufacture on a large scale of cardboard boxes. He had two grown-up girls of his own. He had consulted his wife <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> all right. The girl would get a welcome in his home. His home most likely was not what she had been used to but, etcetera, etcetera.|$|E
5000|$|According to legend the Danish king Valdemar II {{was hunting}} for deer in Toompea {{when he spotted}} a {{beautiful}} stag. The king liked the animal much <b>and</b> <b>so</b> he ordered it to be caught alive. Unfortunately, the deer escaped, fell from a high limestone bank and broke its neck. In German, Reh-fall means [...] "fall of a deer", <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> where the name Reval was derived from.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{reference}} works spell the epithet [...] "rachodes" [...] rather than [...] "rhacodes". The spelling [...] "rachodes" [...] {{was used by}} Vittadini when he first published the species in 1835, but was erroneous as the Greek word rhakos 'piece of cloth' should be transcribed as rhacos. However Index Fungorum keeps to the original author's spelling [...] "rachodes" [...] <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the form which {{should be regarded as}} correct.|$|R

The packing-case came; that's sure enough, {{because it}} was about the biggest packing-case ever I clapped eyes on. And this Pitman he seemed a good deal cut up, and he had the superintendent out, and they got hold of the vanman--him as took the packing-case. Well, sir," [...] continued Bill, with a smile, [...] "I never see a man in such a state. Everybody about that van was mortal, bar the horses. Some gen'leman (as well as I could make out) had given the vanman a sov.; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> where the trouble come in, you see." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{wondered}} if she ought {{to appear before the}} board in uniform. Her nurse's dresses were packed in her trunk at Mrs. Slaney's, in Woodhouse. It was now May. The whole business at Woodhouse was finished. Manchester House and all the furniture was sold to some boot-and-shoe people: at least the boot-and-shoe people had the house. They had given four thousand pounds for it--which was above the lawyer's estimate. On the other hand, the theatre was sold for almost nothing. It all worked out that some thirty-three pounds, which the creditors made up to fifty pounds, remained for Alvina. She insisted on Miss Pinnegar's having half of this. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> all over. Miss Pinnegar was already in Tamworth, and her little shop would be opened next week. She wrote happily and excitedly about it.|$|E
60|$|At first I {{hated the}} school, {{but by and}} by I got so I could stand it. Whenever I got {{uncommon}} tired I played hookey, and the hiding I got next day done me good and cheered me up. So the longer I went to school the easier it got to be. I was getting sort of used to the widow's ways, too, and they warn't so raspy on me. Living in a house and sleeping in a bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly, but before the cold weather I used to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> a rest to me. I liked the old ways best, but I was getting so I liked the new ones, too, a little bit. The widow said I was coming along slow but sure, and doing very satisfactory. She said she warn't ashamed of me.|$|E
2500|$|The last gold 5-franc {{pieces were}} minted in 1869, and silver 5-franc coins were last minted in 1878.

60|$|So I said it wouldn't be {{no use to}} try to play it any longer, and I {{would just}} make a clean breast and tell her everything, but she musn't go back on her promise. Then I told her {{my father and mother}} was dead, and the law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country thirty mile back from the river, and he treated me so bad I couldn't stand it no longer; he went away to be gone a couple of days, and so I took my chance and stole some of his daughter's old clothes and cleared out, and I had been three nights coming the thirty miles. I {{traveled}} nights, and hid daytimes and slept, and the bag of bread and meat I carried from home lasted me all the way, and I had a-plenty. I said I believed my uncle Abner Moore would take care of me, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> why I struck out for this town of Goshen.|$|E
6000|$|It is {{wonderful}} indeed that when once Edward {{had begun to}} attract anybody's attention at all, he and his exhibition should ever {{have been allowed to}} pass so unnoticed in a great, rich, learned city like Aberdeen. But it only shows how very hard it is for unassuming merit to push its way; for the Aberdeen people still went unheeding past the shop in Union Street, till Edward at last began to fear and tremble as to how he should ever meet the expenses of the exhibition. After the show had been open four weeks, one black Friday came when Edward never took a penny the whole day. As he sat there alone and despondent in the empty room, the postman brought him a letter. It was from his master at Banff. [...] "Return immediately," [...] it said, [...] "or you will be discharged." [...] What on earth could he do? He couldn't remove his collection; he couldn't pay his debt. A few more days passed, and he saw no way out of it. At last, in blank despair, he offered the whole collection for sale. A gentleman proposed to pay him the paltry sum of 20 pounds 10s. for the entire lot, the slow accumulations of ten long years. It was a miserable and totally inadequate price, but Edward could get no more. In the depths of his misery, he accepted it. The gentleman took the collection home, gave it to his boy, and finally allowed it all, for want of care and attention, to go to rack and ruin. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the end of ten years of poor Thomas Edward's unremitting original work in natural history. A sadder tale of unrequited labour in the cause of science has seldom been written.|$|E

"Wal, Abner Ginger, Polly's boy, he {{that was}} footman and waiter {{then at the}} Gineral's, he told me, that, about eight o'clock that evening he went up with hot water and lemons and sperits and sich, and he see the gret green table in the library all strewed and covered with piles o' papers; and there was tin boxes a standin' round; and the Gineral a packin' a trunk, and young Master Jeff, as lively and helpful as a rat that smells cheese. And then the Gineral he says, 'Abner,' says he, 'can you write your name?'--'I should hope so, Gineral.' says Abner.--'Wal, then, Abner,' says he, 'this is my last will; and I want you to witness it,' and so Abner he put down his name {{opposite}} to a place with a wafer and a seal; and then the Gineral, he says, 'Abner, you tell Ginger to come here.' That, you see, was his housekeeper, my Aunt Polly's sister, and a likely woman as ever was. And so they had her up, and she put down her name to the will; and then Aunt Polly she was had up (she was drinking tea there that night), and she put down her name. And all of 'em did it with good heart, 'cause it had got about among 'em that the will was to provide for Miss Ruth; for everybody loved Ruth, ye see, and there was consid'ble many stories kind o' goin' the rounds about Master Jeff and his doin's. And they did say he sort o' kep' up the strife atween the Gineral and my lady, and so they didn't think none too well o' him; and, as he was next o' kin, and Miss Ruth wa'n't none o' the Gineral's blood (ye see, she was Mis' Sullivan's sister's child), of course there wouldn't nothin' go to Miss Ruth in way o' law, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> why the signin' o' that 'are will was so much talked about among 'em." ...|$|E
