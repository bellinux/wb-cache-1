25|$|It {{seems to}} be one of the {{fundamental}} features of nature that fundamental physical laws are described in terms of a mathematical theory of great beauty and power, needing quite a high standard of mathematics for one to understand it. You may wonder: Why is nature constructed along these lines? One can only answer that our present knowledge seems to show that nature is so constructed. We simply have to accept it. One could perhaps describe the situation by saying that God is a mathematician of a very high order, and He used very advanced mathematics in constructing the universe. Our feeble attempts at mathematics enable us to understand <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> universe, and as we proceed to develop higher and higher mathematics we can hope to understand the universe better.|$|E
25|$|In 1825, he {{left for}} his second Canadian and third Arctic expedition. The goal this time was {{the mouth of the}} Mackenzie River from which he would follow the coast westward and {{possibly}} meet Frederick William Beechey who would try to sail northeast from the Bering Strait. With him was John Richardson who would follow the coast east from the Mackenzie to the mouth of the Coppermine River. At the same time, William Edward Parry would try to sail west from the Atlantic. (Beechey reached Point Barrow and Parry became frozen in 900 miles east. At this time, the only known points on the north coast were a hundred or so miles east from the Bering Strait, the mouth of the Mackenzie, Franklin's stretch east of the Coppermine, and <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gulf of Boothia which had been seen briefly from land.) Supplies were better organized this time, in part because they were managed by Peter Warren Dease of the Hudson's Bay Company.|$|E
25|$|In the 17th and 18th century, {{the style}} of {{winemaking}} in France was for heartier wines that could age and survive long transport voyages over seas. Winemaking text such as the 1803 annotated and updated edition of de Serres' Théâtre d'Agriculture began recommending that all fine producers employ {{the use of a}} wine press and that sometimes blending in <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vin de presse to enhance color and body was essential to create a wine that could last. Even in Bordeaux, which was still using lagars long after Burgundy, Champagne and other French wine regions had adopted the basket press, saw the use of a wine press become more popular after darker, more full bodied wines of Ho-Bryan produced by Lord Arnaud III de Pontac began receive wide acclaim from English writers such as Jonathan Swift, John Locke and Samuel Pepys. By the end of the 18th century, nearly all prestigious Bordeaux wine estates were following de Pontac's method of giving the grapes more time to ferment in the vat and then using a basket press on the darker vin vermeilh and pressing it into new oak barrels.|$|E

25|$|The Egyptian protests {{became the}} most {{critical}} foreign policy crisis so far for the Obama administration, and Obama came to increasingly rely upon Clinton for advice and connections. Clinton had known Mubarak for some twenty years, and had formed {{a close relationship with}} Egyptian First Lady Suzanne Mubarak by supporting the latter's human rights work. Clinton originated the idea of sending Frank G. Wisner as an emissary to Cairo, to tell Mubarak not to seek another term as the country's leader. As Mubarak's response to the protests became violent in early February, Clinton strongly condemned the actions taking place, especially those against journalists covering the events, and urged new Egyptian Vice President Omar Suleiman to conduct an official investigation to hold those responsible for the violence accountable. When Wisner baldly stated that Mubarak's departure should be delayed to accommodate an orderly transition to another government, Clinton rebuked him, but shared <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same sentiment. Mubarak did finally step down on February 11 as the protests became the 2011 Egyptian revolution. Clinton said that the U.S. realized that Egypt still had much work and some difficult times ahead of it. In mid-March, Clinton visited Egypt and indicated support for an Egyptian move towards democracy, but she avoided specific issues of U.S. aid and when elections should take place.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, Samhain {{was a time}} to {{take stock}} of the herds and food supplies. Cattle were brought down to the winter {{pastures}} after six months in the higher summer pastures. It was also the time to choose which animals would need to be slaughtered for the winter. This custom is still observed by many who farm and raise livestock because it is when meat will keep since the freeze has come and also since summer grass is gone and free foraging is no longer possible. It is thought that some of the rituals associated with the slaughter have been transferred to other winter holidays. On St. Martin's Day (11 November) in Ireland, an animal – usually a rooster, goose or sheep – would be slaughtered and some of its blood sprinkled on the threshold of the house. It was offered to Saint Martin, who may have taken the place of a god or gods, and it was then eaten as part of a feast. This custom was common in parts of Ireland until the 19th century, and was found in some other parts of Europe. At New Year in the Hebrides, a man dressed in a cowhide would circle the township sunwise. <b>A</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hide would be burnt and everyone would breathe in the smoke. These customs were meant to keep away bad luck, and similar customs were found in other Celtic regions.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} lab {{techniques}} {{are used to}} determine the properties of polymers. Techniques such as wide angle X-ray scattering, small angle X-ray scattering, and small angle neutron scattering are {{used to determine the}} crystalline structure of polymers. Gel permeation chromatography is used to determine the number average molecular weight, weight average molecular weight, and polydispersity. FTIR, Raman and NMR can be used to determine composition. Thermal properties such as the glass transition temperature and melting point can be determined by differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic mechanical analysis. Pyrolysis followed by analysis of the fragments is one more technique for determining the possible structure of the polymer. Thermogravimetry is a useful technique to evaluate the thermal stability of the polymer. Detailed analysis of TG curves also allow us to know <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> phase segregation in polymers. Rheological properties are also commonly used to help determine molecular architecture (molecular weight, molecular weight distribution and branching) as well as to understand how the polymer will process, through measurements of the polymer in the melt phase. Another polymer characterization technique is Automatic Continuous Online Monitoring of Polymerization Reactions (ACOMP) which provides real-time characterization of polymerization reactions. It can be used as an analytical method in R, as a tool for reaction optimization at the bench and pilot plant level and, eventually, for feedback control of full-scale reactors. ACOMP measures in a model-independent fashion the evolution of average molar mass and intrinsic viscosity, monomer conversion kinetics and, in the case of copolymers, also the average composition drift and distribution. It is applicable in the areas of free radical and controlled radical homo- and copolymerization, polyelectrolyte synthesis, heterogeneous phase reactions, including emulsion polymerization, adaptation to batch and continuous reactors, and modifications of polymers.|$|E

500|$|Their fourth album Suck It and See {{sees the}} band {{exploring}} styles, mixing them with newfound maturity. Turner said: [...] "I think {{the new album}} is a balance between our first three. There's nothing about taxi ranks or anything like that, but there's <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> standpoint I had on those early songs {{and the sense of}} humour, but also there's <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 'Humbug' stuff which is kind of off in the corners." [...] Critics noted an influence from British rock bands from the 1960s, as well as The Smiths, and slower, love-themed ballads featured more heavily on the album than the fast-paced, rockier songs that typifies the band's sound. Turner wrote much of the album in his apartment on an acoustic guitar, further influencing the ballad-style prevalent on the album.|$|E
500|$|The {{second part}} begins with Moon's {{simultaneous}} drum break and scream and launches in different, hard rock direction.

[...] It's like <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Who, <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Yardbirds {{and a bit of}} me". The amply-distorted guitar provides [...] "a thick-toned, descending riff", according to Power. [...] He also describes the break, inspired by the Yardbirds' rave-up technique, as [...] "eerily presag the coming era of hard rock and heavy metal". [...] The third part returns to the main motif with added guitar fills. [...] The melody line is abandoned in the second section and replaced with multiple interwoven takes of guitar effects, including phasing, echo, and controlled feedback. [...] It concludes with a few bars of hard blues rock-style lead guitar and an abrupt ending.|$|E
