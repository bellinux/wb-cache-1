It is loosely based on Jones' 2006 film, AJ Goes to France. Both the film and the pilot star AJ Thompson as the eponymous character. Jones additionally sought inspiration from his hometown of Fargo, North Dakota, and the comics he drew featuring Thompson <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>other</b> friends. The pilot was released on the official website of Cartoon Network on May 16, 2014.|$|E
5|$|After Resaca de la Palma, Mexican {{forces were}} cleared from the Texan {{side of the}} Rio Grande, but {{additional}} operations were required to force Mexico {{to agree to the}} border. The Mexican commander, General Mariano Arista, withdrew his forces to Linares, with Taylor in pursuit for sixty miles before returning to Fort Brown for reinforcements. He then marched against Monterrey. The heavily fortified city had a 10,000-man garrison under Arista's replacement, General Pedro de Ampudia, but its supply line running south to Saltillo was vulnerable. Lacking the heavy artillery needed for a siege, Taylor planned a double envelopment, with one division executing a turning movement to cut the supply line and attack from the west and south, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>other</b> two divisions assaulting {{the north side of the}} city.|$|E

Ransom and Mahone) were still too far north of the scene. Despite the mishaps and disunity, Malvern Hill would be the first time during the Seven Days Battles that Lee managed to concentrate his force.|$|E

5|$|Born in Dublin, Ireland, on 13 December 1899, Bellew {{was the son}} of the Hon. Richard Eustace Bellew by {{his second}} wife Gwendoline Marie Josephine, elder {{daughter}} of William Reginald Joseph Fitzherbert Herbert Huddleston of Clytha. His father was the younger son of the second Baron Bellew. Bellew's elder brother, Edward Henry, inherited the barony; because their father had died before inheriting the title, Bellew <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>other</b> siblings took the style of the son of a baron by a Royal Warrant of Precedence in 1935. The same year, he married Ursula Kennard Cull (died 1994), eldest daughter of Anders Eric Knös Cull (died 1968), a merchant banker and founder of Cull & Co., of Warfield House, Berkshire, and had one son, Richard George Bellew (born 1936); through her mother, Ursula Bellew was a descendant of James Robinson Planché, sometime Somerset Herald.|$|E
5|$|Carte {{left the}} theatre, opera company, hotels <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>other</b> {{business}} interests to Helen. Her London and touring companies continued {{to present the}} Savoy Operas in Britain and overseas. In 1901 she leased the Savoy Theatre to William Greet, overseeing his management of a revival of Iolanthe and several new comic operas. Rupert became chairman of the Savoy Hotel by 1903, which Helen continued to own. In late 1906, Helen staged a Gilbert and Sullivan repertory season at the Savoy Theatre. The season, and the following one, which were both directed by Gilbert, earned excellent reviews and sold well, revitalising the company. After the second repertory season concluded in 1909, however, the company did not perform in London again until 1919, only touring throughout Britain during that time.|$|E
5|$|In 1959–60, the Test team {{toured the}} Indian subcontinent during the Australian summer, opening up more {{vacancies}} in the Sheffield Shield. Harvey {{was given a}} recall in December 1959. However, he was not successful and failed to convert his starts into substantial scores, making 8, 36, 12, 25, 22 and 20 in three matches. In the last of these matches, he took his career-best bowling figures of 3/26, in the first innings against South Australia. He dismissed the top-scorer John Lill for 176 <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>other</b> victims were Michael Clingly and Peter Trethewey. This allowed Victoria to take first innings points and eventually complete a six-wicket win. This meant that all of Harvey's five wickets as first-class level came against South Australia. Harvey's first-class career ended with the following match against New South Wales. He made 1 and 9, and conceded 26 runs from three wicketless overs, and was dropped, having made only 133 runs at 16.62 for the season.|$|E

5|$|Jones had {{previously}} codirected AJ Goes to France, a 2006 live-action independent film that also has Thompson {{as the leading}} actor. It was produced as an assignment for Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota, where Jones majored in film. Jones had moved from his hometown of Fargo, North Dakota, to Minneapolis in 2005, after he graduated from Fargo South High School. For AJ's Infinite Summer, Jones was inspired by his hometown, {{as well as the}} comics he drew that featured AJ <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>other</b> friends, Danny Davy and Morgan. Additionally, the character of Peter is based on Greg Carlson, Jones' professor from Concordia and also a film director and a critic for the High Plains Reader. Secret Cities, a Fargo-based band in which Jones' friends play, provided the score for the pilot. Jones found it excellent that both his friends and his friend's band were allowed by the network to do work for the pilot.|$|E
