40|$|Regenerative Braking Systems (RBS) {{provide an}} {{efficient}} method to assist hybrid electric buses achieve better fuel economy while lowering exhaust emissions. This paper describes {{the design and}} testing of three regenerative braking systems, {{one of which is}} a series regenerative braking system and two of which are parallel regenerative braking systems. The existing friction based <b>Adjustable</b> <b>Braking</b> System (ABS) on the bus is integrated with each of the new braking systems in order to ensure bus safety and stability. The design of the RBS is facilitated by Simulink [1] which is used to build an interactive, multi-domain simulator that is allows parametric variation of vehicle speed, State of Charge (SOC) for the batteries, and the maximum current to be allowed to the batteries from the RBS. The required braking forces as a function of wheel speed are modeled using dSpace[2]. A Hardwire-in-the-Loop (HIL) experimental setup is used for component testing, followed by road testing using the Chinese Urban Bus Driving Cycle. Results indicate that all three braking systems provide some energy recovery, with the serial RBS providing the best combination of energy recovery with acceptable drivability, safety and stability. Overall results confirm that regenerative braking systems can recover significant braking energy while operating in a safe and predictable manner...|$|E

50|$|Most reels are {{designed}} to be held in the left hand, particularly for recovering line. Line should be kept under tension at all times to avoid slack which is more likely to snag on divers' equipment. An <b>adjustable</b> <b>brake</b> may be used to provide resistance to rotation, or this can be done by pressing a thumb or finger against the spool as it rotates, which is quick and controllable, but requires some attention, and fails if the reel is dropped. The line should be kept clear of the divers body during the laying to reduce risk of snagging on the diver's equipment. This can be achieved by holding the reel away from the body in clear water.|$|R

40|$|In recent years, a {{great deal}} of {{research}} in North America has been directed toward refining methods of assessing the load-carrying capability of skyline systems. Little effort has been directed, however, toward field measurement of cable tensions for skyline logging systems to facilitate initial tensioning of unloaded skylines or to provide means of field checking to see whether skyline systems are overloaded. The two surest methods of preventing overloads are to have continuous-reading tension meters on the line or to have self-regulating mechanisms, such as <b>adjustable</b> skyline <b>brakes</b> or tensioning devices. Often these devices, however, are not available. This paper describes two alternative methods of measuring skyline tension and their application...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} and compare interactions between the abdominal musculature and intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) during controlled dynamic and static trunk muscle loading. Myoelectric activity was recorded in six subjects from the rectus abdominis, obliquus externus, obliquus internus, transversus abdominis and erector spinae muscles using surface and intra-muscular fine-wire electrodes. The IAP was recorded intra-gastrically. Trunk flexions and extensions were performed lying on one side on a swivel table. An <b>adjustable</b> <b>brake</b> provided different friction loading conditions, while adding weights to an unbraked swivel table afforded various levels of inertial loading. During trunk extensions at all friction loads, IAP was elevated (1. 8 - 7. 2 kPa) with concomitant activity in transversus abdominis and obliquus internus muscles-little or no activity was seen from rectus abdominis and obliquus externus muscles. For inertia loading during trunk extension, IAP levels were somewhat lower (1. 8 - 5. 6 kPa) and displayed a second peak when abdominal muscle activity occurred in the course of decelerating the movement. For single trunk flexions with friction loading, IAP was higher than that seen in extension conditions and increased with added resistance. For inertial loading during trunk flexion, IAP showed two peaks, the larger first peak matched peak forward acceleration and general abdominal muscle activation, while the second corresponded to peak deceleration and was accompanied by activity in transversus abdominis and erector spinae muscles. It was apparent that different loading strategies produced markedly different patterns of response in both trunk musculature and intra-abdominal pressure...|$|R

50|$|The GT3 R {{has adopted}} {{the concept of}} the central {{radiator}} from its 911 RSR big brother. By eliminating the side radiators, the position of the centre of gravity is improved, the radiator is better protected against collision damage, and the venting of hot air through louvres in the front cover is enhanced. The two-metre wide rear wing lends aerodynamic balance and distinctive wheel arch air vents on the front fairings increase downforce at the front axle. The GT3 R's front McPherson strut suspension and multi-link rear suspension are adjustable in height, camber and toe, and there are adjustable anti-roll bar blades at both ends. All wheel hubs come with centre-lock wheel nuts. There are two separate brake circuits for the front and rear axles; driver <b>adjustable</b> via a <b>brake</b> balance bar system. The front brakes consist of six-piston aluminium monobloc calipers gripping 380 mm discs; the rears are four-piston items with 372 mm discs.|$|R
50|$|The Arrinera Hussarya is a GT3-compliant racing car.

The car has been designed not only for ergonomic use towards the driver, but also for the ease of maintenance and low running costs. The long wheelbase and cabin space allow for a passenger seat inside the cockpit. The Hussarya is powered by an LS7 V8 engine pushing out 500bhp and is mated to a six-speed Hewland sequential racing gearbox operated by paddle shifters. It features a modular steel spaceframe chassis, bespoke pushrod suspension with Öhlins four-way <b>adjustable</b> dampers, Alcon <b>brakes</b> with 380mm discs and six-pot mono bloc calipers all round. Bosch racing ABS and traction control are standard equipment. The car is built to FIA GT3 specifications.|$|R
50|$|Following {{two years}} of {{production}} improvements were introduced in September 1927 for that year's motor show. The wheelbase was lengthened by 2 in but not the car's overall length. The steering was improved for a smoother and lighter action and the column rake was now <b>adjustable.</b> The front <b>brake</b> cables were replaced with rods. The engine received larger crankshaft and connecting rod bearings and an anti-detonating ("anti-knock") design adopted for the cylinder head. A Weymann fabric bodied 4-light 4-door sports saloon (as chosen for personal use by Henry Segrave) with safety glass option and a 6-light Safety saloon (fitted with Triplex safety glass) joined the range. The artillery wheel option was dropped. Dipping headlights were a new feature. Separate seats replaced the front bench seat and both back and front seats were widened. There were also changes to the mudguards and running boards. The export car was widened to 67 in inches and its track to 56 in inches. A water-impeller and a large top radiator tank were also fitted to export cars.|$|R
