5|$|Somerset {{was part}} of the Roman Empire from 47AD to about 409AD. However, the end was not <b>abrupt</b> and {{elements}} of Romanitas lingered on for perhaps a century.|$|E
5|$|The {{intonation}} {{pattern of}} a typical Khmer declarative phrase is a steady rise throughout followed by an <b>abrupt</b> drop on the last syllable.|$|E
5|$|The most {{frequent}} symptoms of withdrawal from benzodiazepines are insomnia, gastric problems, tremors, agitation, fearfulness, and muscle spasms. The less frequent effects are irritability, sweating, depersonalization, derealization, hypersensitivity to stimuli, depression, suicidal behavior, psychosis, seizures, and delirium tremens. Severe symptoms usually {{occur as a}} result of <b>abrupt</b> or over-rapid withdrawal. <b>Abrupt</b> withdrawal can be dangerous, therefore a gradual reduction regimen is recommended.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{alprazolam}} {{during pregnancy}} {{is associated with}} congenital abnormalities, and use in the last trimester may cause fetal drug dependence and withdrawal symptoms in the post-natal period as well as neonatal flaccidity and respiratory problems. However, in long-term users of benzodiazepines, <b>abrupt</b> discontinuation due to concerns of teratogenesis has {{a high risk of}} causing extreme withdrawal symptoms and a severe rebound effect of the underlying mental health disorder. Spontaneous abortions may also result from <b>abrupt</b> withdrawal of psychotropic medications, including benzodiazepines.|$|E
5|$|A common {{feature of}} the core syndromes is chorea: {{involuntary}} dance-like movements. In neuroacanthocytosis, this is particularly prominent {{in the face and}} mouth which can cause difficulties with speech and eating. These movements are usually <b>abrupt</b> and irregular and present during both rest and sleep.|$|E
5|$|Because Titus {{effectively}} {{acted as}} co-emperor with his father, no <b>abrupt</b> change in Flavian policy occurred when Vespasian died on 23 June 79. Titus assured Domitian that full partnership {{in the government}} would soon be his, but neither tribunician power nor imperium of any kind was conferred upon him during Titus' brief reign.|$|E
5|$|Dedicated to Suzanne Alfred-Bruneau, {{the eighth}} barcarolle opens {{in with a}} cheerful theme, which soon gives way to melancholy. The second episode, in C minor, marked cantabile, is succeeded by an <b>abrupt</b> ending with a fortissimo chord.|$|E
5|$|Newton {{did have}} a close {{friendship}} with the Swiss mathematician Nicolas Fatio de Duillier, whom he met in London around 1689. Their intense relationship came to an <b>abrupt</b> and unexplained end in 1693, {{and at the same}} time Newton suffered a nervous breakdown. Some of their correspondence has survived.|$|E
5|$|On 28 May 1916, in an <b>abrupt</b> {{change of}} command, Lieutenant-General Edwin Alderson was {{appointed}} to the largely ceremonial post of Inspector General of Canadian Forces in England and was succeeded by Lieutenant-General Julian Byng as commander of the Canadian Corps.|$|E
5|$|Several rock {{prominences}} {{exist on}} the lower flanks of Adams. The Spearhead is an <b>abrupt</b> rocky prominence {{near the bottom of}} Battlement Ridge. Burnt Rock, The Hump, and The Bumper are three smaller rocky prominences at or below the tree line on the west side.|$|E
5|$|The <b>abrupt</b> {{cutting off}} of God's voice before he reveals {{the meaning of}} life was {{intended}} to be cut off by a voiceover promotion for whatever Fox program aired after The Simpsons. However, Fox did not pick up on this and so God's voice was instead cut off by the show's credits.|$|E
5|$|The {{red-headed}} myzomela has a {{range of}} contact calls and songs that are primarily metallic or scratchy. Its song is an <b>abrupt</b> tchwip-tchwip-tchwip-tchwip with a slightly softer swip-swip-swip-swip contact call and a scolding charrk-charrk.|$|E
5|$|Although {{individuals}} with Asperger syndrome acquire language skills without significant general delay and their speech typically lacks significant abnormalities, language acquisition and use is often atypical. Abnormalities include verbosity, <b>abrupt</b> transitions, literal interpretations and miscomprehension of nuance, use of metaphor meaningful {{only to the}} speaker, auditory perception deficits, unusually pedantic, formal or idiosyncratic speech, and oddities in loudness, pitch, intonation, prosody, and rhythm. Echolalia has also been observed in {{individuals with}} AS.|$|E
5|$|As well as this, {{an entire}} {{sequence}} involving Tremble {{going to the}} front for the underground James Bond training school (which {{turns out to be}} under Harrods, of which the training area was the lowest level) was never shot, thus creating an <b>abrupt</b> cut from Vesper announcing that Tremble will be James Bond to Tremble exiting the lift into the training school.|$|E
5|$|Bo Xilai's {{political}} fortunes {{came to an}} <b>abrupt</b> {{end when}} his police chief, Wang Lijun, fled to the American consulate in Chengdu hoping to gain political asylum. Wang reportedly provided the consulate with information on Bo's alleged misconduct, including his role obstructing investigations into the homicide of British citizen and Bo family associate Neil Heywood. In the fallout, Bo was removed as Chongqing party chief in March 2012 and suspended from the politburo in April 2012.|$|E
5|$|Bo was {{considered}} a likely candidate for promotion to the elite Politburo Standing Committee in 18th Party Congress in 2012. His political fortunes came to an <b>abrupt</b> end following the Wang Lijun incident, in which his top lieutenant and police chief sought asylum at the American consulate in Chengdu. Wang claimed to have information about the involvement of Bo Xilai and his wife Gu Kailai {{in the murder of}} British businessman Neil Heywood, who allegedly had close financial ties to the two.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion {{lowers the}} {{threshold}} for epileptic seizures, {{and therefore can}} potentially interact with other medications that also lower it, such as carbapenems, cholinergic agents, fluoroquinolones, interferons, chloroquine, mefloquine, lindane, theophylline, systemic corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone), and some tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., clomipramine). The prescribing information recommends minimizing the use of alcohol, since in rare cases bupropion reduces alcohol tolerance, and because the excessive use of alcohol may lower the seizure threshold. Also, bupropion {{should not be taken}} by individuals undergoing <b>abrupt</b> cessation of alcohol or benzodiazepine use.|$|E
5|$|Chinese, Indian and Comorian {{minorities}} {{are present in}} Madagascar, {{as well as a}} small European (primarily French) populace. Emigration in the late 20th century has reduced these minority populations, occasionally in <b>abrupt</b> waves, such as the exodus of Comorans in 1976, following anti-Comoran riots in Mahajanga. By comparison, there has been no significant emigration of Malagasy peoples. The number of Europeans has declined since independence, reduced from 68,430 in 1958 to 17,000 three decades later. There were an estimated 25,000Comorans, 18,000Indians, and 9,000Chinese living in Madagascar in the mid-1980s.|$|E
5|$|Discontinuation of benzodiazepines or <b>abrupt</b> {{reduction}} of the dose, even after a relatively short course of treatment (three to four weeks), may result in two groups of symptoms—rebound and withdrawal. Rebound symptoms are {{the return of the}} symptoms for which the patient was treated but worse than before. Withdrawal symptoms are the new symptoms that occur when the benzodiazepine is stopped. They are the main sign of physical dependence.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s, {{many local}} {{businesses}} collapsed, several railroads went bankrupt, and numerous small rural banks folded. Manufacturing {{came to an}} <b>abrupt</b> halt or was severely cut back due the dwindling demand for products. The Depression continued to negatively affect Indiana until the buildup for World War II. The effects continued to be felt for many years thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Further {{analysis}} shows that several processes were in {{progress in the}} late Cretaceous seas and partially overlapped in time, then ended with the <b>abrupt</b> mass extinction. The diversity of marine life decreased when the climate near the K-T boundary increased in temperature. The temperature increased about three to four degrees very rapidly between 65.4 and 65.2 million years ago, which is {{around the time of}} the extinction event. Not only did the climate temperature increase, but the water temperature decreased causing a drastic decrease in marine diversity.|$|E
5|$|Griswold married Caroline on August 12, 1837, and {{the couple}} had two daughters. Following {{the birth of their}} second daughter, Griswold left his family behind in New York and moved to Philadelphia. His {{departure}} on November 27, 1840, was by all accounts <b>abrupt,</b> leaving his job with Horace Greeley's New York Tribune, and his library of several thousand volumes. He joined the staff of Philadelphia's Daily Standard and began to build his reputation as a literary critic, becoming known for his savagery and vindictiveness.|$|E
5|$|Henry was {{allegedly}} buried in Nousiainen, from where his bones—or at least {{something that was}} thought to be his bones—were transported to Turku in 1300. In addition to traditions, the only source connecting Nousiainen to early bishops is a letter signed by Bishop Thomas in Nousiainen in 1234. Archaeological excavations of pre-Catholic cemeteries in Nousiainen and surrounding parishes show a clear discontinuation of traditions in the early 13th century, but no <b>abrupt</b> changes are apparent in the religious environment among the 12th century finds.|$|E
5|$|In 1244, Alexander {{made the}} first of several {{attempts}} by Scottish monarchs to purchase the Hebrides from the Kingdom of Norway. It was following this unsuccessful bid that Hákon sent Eóghan into the Isles in 1249, which in turn led to Eóghan's expulsion from the Scottish-mainland when Alexander launched a full-scale summer invasion into Argyll. Alexander's sudden death in the Hebrides brought an <b>abrupt</b> end to his westward invasion, and {{it was not until the}} 1260s that a Scottish king again attempted to impose his authority into the Isles.|$|E
5|$|Recent work in {{developmental}} biology has identified dynamical and physical mechanisms of tissue morphogenesis that may underlie <b>abrupt</b> morphological transitions during evolution. Consequently, consideration of mechanisms of phylogenetic change {{that have been}} found in reality to be non-gradual is increasingly common in the field of evolutionary developmental biology, particularly in studies of the origin of morphological novelty. A description of such mechanisms {{can be found in the}} multi-authored volume Origination of Organismal Form (MIT Press; 2003).|$|E
5|$|Ruffed lemurs use alarm {{calls that}} {{differentiate}} between ground and aerial predators. For instance an <b>abrupt</b> roar or huff alerts {{the group to}} an avian predator, and a pulsed squawk or growl-snort communicates {{the existence of a}} mammalian ground predator. When sounding these calls, such as the pulsed squawk, adults direct them at the predator after moving to a safe position. Once the alarm call is sounded by one individual, the resulting chorus can even reach the furthest ranging community members.|$|E
5|$|Sviatoslav's {{campaign}} {{brought the}} prosperity and independence of Khazaria to an <b>abrupt</b> end. The destruction of Khazar imperial power {{paved the way}} for Kievan Rus' to dominate north-south trade routes through the steppe and across the Black Sea, routes that formerly had been a major source of revenue for the Khazars. Moreover, Sviatoslav's campaigns led to increased Slavic settlement in the region of the Saltovo-Mayaki culture, greatly changing the demographics and culture of the transitional area between the forest and the steppe.|$|E
5|$|The <b>abrupt</b> {{abolition}} of slavery which Rio Branco had warned against eventually occurred eight years later. This {{resulted in the}} alienation of the second Viscount of Uruguai's ultraconservative faction and powerful political interests. These formed a subversive alliance with republicans and discontented military officers {{which led to the}} overthrow of the Empire on 15 November 1889.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{is located}} on the top of an {{irregular}} plateau, whose southern, eastern and northern slopes are <b>abrupt,</b> with the softer western slope, towards the modern village of Kastro, offering the easiest access. The heart of the fortress consists of a large hexagonal keep, complemented towards the west, where the terrain is more accessible, by an additional outer wall, likewise of irregular polygonal outline, enclosing a second, much wider courtyard (the outer ward).|$|E
5|$|The film's visual style {{includes}} <b>abrupt</b> cuts, rapid camera movement, extensive superimposition, dim lighting, {{and shapes}} and forms in twisted and disoriented angles. Filmed {{with a budget}} of only $97 ($ in today's dollars), it includes a combination of close-ups of live actors and long shots of miniature sets, which were made from such items as cardboard, paper cubes, tin cans, cigar boxes, and toy trains. With no access to Hollywood studios or equipment, most of the filming {{took place in the}} filmmakers' residences, with walls painted black for use as a background.|$|E
5|$|The {{idealization}} of Tamar {{was further}} accentuated {{by the events}} that took place under her immediate successors; within two decades of Tamar's death, the Khwarezmian and Mongol invasions brought Georgian ascendancy to an <b>abrupt</b> end. Later periods of national revival were too ephemeral to match the achievements of Tamar's reign. All of these contributed to the cult of Tamar which blurred {{the distinction between the}} idealized queen and the real personality.|$|E
5|$|The mass {{extinction}} of marine plankton {{appears to have}} been <b>abrupt</b> and right at the K–Pg boundary. Ammonite genera became extinct at or near the K–Pg boundary; however, there was a smaller and slower extinction of ammonite genera prior to the boundary that was associated with a late Cretaceous marine regression. The gradual extinction of most inoceramid bivalves began well before the K–Pg boundary, and a small, gradual reduction in ammonite diversity occurred throughout the very late Cretaceous.|$|E
5|$|The most {{distinctive}} {{voice of the}} curve-billed is an <b>abrupt</b> and brash whit-wheet, which sounds akin to a person whistling to get one's attention. It is usually uttered from high perches. The songs are {{similar to that of}} the northern mockingbird but notes do not end as abruptly; its voice is regarded as more pleasant. The curve-billed can utter songs consecutively two or three times, the length spanning from 2 to 15 seconds. Some phrases are nasal and buzzy; its large vocabulary enables it to conjure successive songs that are usually different from one another.|$|E
5|$|Thigmonastic movements, {{those that}} occur in {{response}} to touch, are used as a defense in some plants. The leaves of the sensitive plant, Mimosa pudica, close up rapidly in response to direct touch, vibration, or even electrical and thermal stimuli. The proximate cause of this mechanical response is an <b>abrupt</b> change in the turgor pressure in the pulvini {{at the base of}} leaves resulting from osmotic phenomena. This is then spread via both electrical and chemical means through the plant; only a single leaflet need be disturbed.|$|E
5|$|Third dance {{movement}} (Scherzo or minuet) in the tonic, {{in overall}} A–B–A ternary form, with a trio in either ternary or binary form, {{and in a}} conventionally related key (relative major, subdominant, and parallel minor respectively). They are based on their sonata's first movements, with a similar tonal scheme and/or motivic reference. The B section of each piece features tonalities serving important dramatic functions in previous movements. Each features animated, playful figurations for the right hand and <b>abrupt</b> changes in register.|$|E
5|$|Those {{taking more}} than 4mg per day have an {{increased}} potential for dependence. This medication may cause withdrawal symptoms upon <b>abrupt</b> withdrawal or rapid tapering, which in some cases {{have been known to}} cause seizures, as well as marked delirium similar to that produced by the anticholinergic tropane alkaloids of Datura (scopolamine and atropine). The discontinuation of this medication may also cause a reaction called rebound anxiety.|$|E
