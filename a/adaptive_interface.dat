40|$|Adaptive personalization, {{where the}} system adapts the {{interface}} to a user’s needs, {{has the potential}} for significant performance benefits on small screen devices. However, research on <b>adaptive</b> <b>interfaces</b> has almost exclusively focused on desktop displays. To explore how well previous findings generalize to small screen devices, we conducted a study with 36 subjects to compare <b>adaptive</b> <b>interfaces</b> for small and desktop-sized screens. Results show that high accuracy adaptive menus have an even larger positive impact on performance and satisfaction when screen real estate is constrained. The drawback of the high accuracy menus, however, is that they reduce the user’s awareness of the full set of items in the interface, potentially making it more difficult for users to learn about new features.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to model and design a skill <b>adaptive</b> <b>interface</b> for human-computer interaction. The adaptation applies to the changing skill levels as users become familiar with an interface. Commands and menus, which require different human memory abilities (recall vs. recognition) and allow different operating speeds, are the most frequently used interface modes. A three-dimensional model is presented to predict the relations among interface style, users 2 ̆ 7 skill levels at using an interface, and users 2 ̆ 7 domain conceptual knowledge (CK). Based on this model, a skill <b>adaptive</b> <b>interface,</b> which is a dynamic combination of menus and commands, was designed and implemented. An experiment was conducted to test five hypotheses concerning the validity of the model and the usability of the adaptive mechanism. Eighty subjects participated in the experiment. The dependent variables were the time to complete the assigned tasks, the number of steps that were used to complete the tasks, the proportion of steps used in the menu mode, the perceived memory load, and the satisfaction ratings. The independent variables were the interface style (Adaptive, Menu Only, Command Only and static Hybrid), the user 2 ̆ 7 s skill level at using an interface, and the user 2 ̆ 7 s CK level of the operating systems. A between-subject design was used for the interface style. It was confirmed that (1) high CK users with low skills performed faster by using the Menu Only interface than the Command Only interface, (2) the Command Only interface was the best for high-skill users, (3) the <b>Adaptive</b> <b>interface</b> could integrate the advantages of both command and menu modes for the high CK users and (4) the <b>Adaptive</b> <b>interface</b> yielded significantly faster performance than the Hybrid interface for the high CK users. It was demonstrated that if the proposed <b>adaptive</b> <b>interface</b> mechanism was applied properly, users could improve their performance time significantly. However, the experimental results did not support the hypothesis that domain conceptual knowledge was a more significant contributor to user performance than the use of different interface styles. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{interactive}} project {{uses the}} metaphor of human sleep and dreaming to present a novel paradigm that helps address problems in <b>adaptive</b> user <b>interface</b> design. Two significant problems in <b>adaptive</b> <b>interfaces</b> are: interfaces that adapt when a user does not {{want them to do}} so, and interfaces where it is hard to understand how it changed during the process of adaptation. In the project described here, the system only adapts when the user allows it to go to sleep long enough to have a dream. In addition, the dream itself is a visualization of the transformation of the interface, so that a person may see what changes have occurred. This project presents an interim stage of this system, in which an autonomous agent collects knowledge about its environment, falls asleep, has dreams, and reconfigures its internal representation of the world while it dreams. People may alter the agent’s environment, may prevent it from sleeping by making noise into a microphone, and may observe the dream process that ensues when it is allowed to fall asleep. By drawing on the universal human experience of sleep and dreaming, this project seeks to make <b>adaptive</b> <b>interfaces</b> more effective and comprehensible...|$|R

40|$|Utilising <b>adaptive</b> <b>interface</b> {{techniques}} {{in the design}} of systems introduces certain risks. An <b>adaptive</b> <b>interface</b> is not static, but will actively adapt to the perceived needs of the user.

Therefore the design of adaptive interfaces must ensure that users can inspect the adaptivity mechanisms, and control their results. One {{way to do this is}} to rely on the user's understanding of the application and the domain, and relate the adaptivity mechanisms to domainspecific concepts.

40|$|We {{introduce}} ephemeral adaptation, a new adaptive GUI {{technique that}} improves performance by reducing visual search time while maintaining spatial consistency. Ephemeral <b>adaptive</b> <b>interfaces</b> employ gradual onset {{to draw the}} user’s attention to predicted items: adaptively predicted items appear abruptly when the menu is opened, but non-predicted items fade in gradually. To demonstrate the benefit of ephemeral adaptation we conducted two experiments {{with a total of}} 48 users to show: (1) that ephemeral adaptive menus are faster than static menus when accuracy is high, and are not significantly slower when it is low and (2) that ephemeral adaptive menus are also faster than adaptive highlighting. While we focused on user-adaptive GUIs, ephemeral adaptation should be applicable to a broad range of visually complex tasks.

40|$|In {{the last}} 2 decades, {{major changes in}} {{information}} technology have taken place. In process control, the ongoing automation {{and the application of}} new technologies caused a radical change in the position of the operator. Combined with manning constraints, and the ever increasing pressure to maximize the operational capability, navies stand for a huge challenge. Because of this new situation, operators need personalized support which can differ in time: the system should accommodate the user with the right task support at the right time. This paper presents the design and first user evaluation of an <b>adaptive</b> <b>interface.</b> A method for cognitive task analysis and 4 support concepts, which were validated for static function allocation and interface design, were taken as starting point. Specific instances of the resulting <b>adaptive</b> <b>interface</b> are the possibility to redirect the alarm (system or operator initiated), and the changing functional layout (e. g. buttons, alarm categories). A first user evaluation of the interface with 64 navy students shows promising results. The method for cognitive task analysis and the 4 support concepts prove to be useable for adaptive support as well. Evaluation shows very positive results on the support system, specifically on the task allocation functions.

There are several proven paradigms for increasing the efficacy of human-robot interaction: 1) multimodal interfaces in which the user controls the robots using voice and gesture; 2) configurable interfaces which allow the user to create new commands by demonstrating them; 3) <b>adaptive</b> <b>interfaces</b> which reduce the operator’s workload as necessary through increasing robot autonomy. Here we study the relative benefits of configurable vs. <b>adaptive</b> <b>interfaces</b> for multi-robot manipulation.
