5|$|Traditionally, the <b>arrest</b> <b>of</b> {{the bishops}} {{has been seen}} as a turning point in Stephen's reign, and the event that turned the ecclesiastical {{hierarchy}} against him. Recent historians have held a lively debate on the issue; a few still hold to the traditional interpretation, but most have decided that reactions in the English church were more ambivalent. One modern historian, David Crouch, believes that the <b>arrest</b> <b>of</b> the bishops signalled the beginnings of the Anarchy, not because of any alienation of the church, but through court politics, where Stephen showed himself incapable of manipulating the factions of his court. The ascendency of the Beaumonts was marked by the placement of one of their protégés, Philip de Harcourt, as Chancellor.|$|E

While charges against Daniloff were dropped, a diplomatic row ensued, leading by the end of October, to the expulsion of 100 Soviets, including 80 suspected intelligence officers. The U.S. lost 10 diplomats from Embassy Moscow, along with all 260 of the Russian support staff.|$|E

Police records <b>of</b> <b>arrests</b> <b>of</b> women in Wichita, Kansas for driving under the {{influence}} (DUI) of alcohol for a 5 -year period (1980 - 1984) were studied. The proportion <b>of</b> <b>arrests</b> <b>of</b> women increased from 10. 6 to 14. 5 % <b>of</b> total <b>arrested.</b> Women in their 20 s comprised the largest age group; single women were greatly overrepresented. More than one-half <b>of</b> the <b>arrested</b> women were employed outside the home; a substantial proportion (30. 8 %) were unemployed at the time <b>of</b> <b>arrest.</b> The average blood alcohol level of those tested was 183 mg/dl. Characteristics of arrestees are discussed in terms of changes in the social roles and expectations of women. Although time <b>of</b> <b>arrest</b> was similar to that of men (i. e., night), <b>arrests</b> <b>of</b> women were more evenly spread across the days of the week. Within the 5 -year period, the rate of recidivism for DUI was 7. 43 %. The implications <b>of</b> <b>arrest</b> and recidivism patterns are discussed. A change in legal and arrest procedures was found to have the same effect on <b>arrests</b> <b>of</b> women as it had on those of men, suggesting that the changes did not produce differential treatment by police. peer reviewe...|$|R
