5|$|Apart from habitat {{destruction}} and deliberate, targeted persecution, pelicans {{are vulnerable to}} disturbance at their breeding colonies by birdwatchers, photographers and other curious visitors.

With winter approaching and provisions running dangerously low, the passengers decided to return north to Cape Cod Bay and <b>abandon</b> <b>their</b> original landing plans.|$|E
50|$|The disorganized {{and slow}} {{response}} also created another {{disaster for the}} national defenders inside the city wall: unaware of the newly changed battle plans that were hastily put together, the soldiers of the remaining battalion began to flee, <b>abandoning</b> <b>their</b> posts, because they thought the other battalion deployed to reinforce the already-destroyed battalion in the suburb were in fact escaping. The battalion on its way outside the city wall, in turn, seeing the remaining defenders starting <b>abandoning</b> <b>their</b> posts to flee and hearing the greatly exaggerated enemy from the survivors from the already destroyed battalion, also panicked and fled back into the city, <b>abandoning</b> <b>their</b> assigned mission.|$|R

5|$|Although Alabama officially did not {{participate}} {{as part of the}} 1943 college football season, a team composed of 17-year old and draft deferred students was organized as the Alabama Informals in October 1943. Not officially sanctioned by the University, the Informals were allowed to utilize both equipment and the facilities of the Crimson Tide. The team was led by head coach Mitchell Olenski, and John Gresham and Al Alois served as assistant coaches. At the time of its creation, the Alabama Informals squad was the second created by a SEC school forced to <b>abandon</b> <b>their</b> football team for the year after Vanderbilt.|$|E
5|$|In September 1785, the Barbaulds left Palgrave {{for a tour}} of France; Rochemont's {{mental health}} had been deteriorating and {{he was no longer}} able to carry out his {{teaching}} duties. In 1787, they moved to Hampstead, where Rochemont was asked to serve as the minister at what later became Rosslyn Hill Unitarian Chapel. It was here that Barbauld became close friends with Joanna Baillie, the playwright. Although no longer in charge of a school, the Barbaulds did not <b>abandon</b> <b>their</b> commitment to education; they often had one or two pupils living with them, who had been recommended by personal friends.|$|E
5|$|In early 1860, Ross {{enlisted in}} Captain J. M. Smith's Waco company of Texas Rangers, which formed {{to fight the}} renegade Native Americans. Smith {{appointed}} Ross his second lieutenant. When Smith was promoted, the other men in the company unanimously voted to make Ross the new captain. In conjunction with several other Ranger companies, Ross led his men to retaliate against a Kickapoo tribe which had murdered two white families. The tribe had been warned of the Rangers' approach and set the prairie ablaze. The Rangers were forced to <b>abandon</b> <b>their</b> mission when confronted with the massive wildfire.|$|E

5|$|Local {{television}} stations ran all-night {{coverage of the}} deluge from June 8 through the next day, including KHOU-TV 11, which was forced to transmit its broadcast to a satellite truck when floodwaters entered its production studio on the Allen Parkway near Studemont/Montrose, near downtown {{along the banks of}} Buffalo Bayou. By midnight on June 9 nearly every freeway and major road in the city was under several feet of water, forcing hundreds of motorists to <b>abandon</b> <b>their</b> vehicles for higher ground. Eighteen-wheeled trucks were filmed floating down major freeways and highways, swept along by floodwaters.|$|E
5|$|Mature plasmodia {{can produce}} fruit bodies under {{appropriate}} circumstances, the exact triggers for this process are unknown.

UNICEF prepared 4emergency health kits and 1,000water containers and Copa Airlines agreed to fly the supplies to Jamaica on its scheduled August 22 flight, if possible. The World Food Program prepared food stock in nearby Haiti, ready to move them to Jamaica if they were needed, although damage to their airport ultimately prevented their distribution.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 13 June, two Argentine Dagger {{aircraft}} attacked Cardiffs Lynx helicopter, no.335 of 829NAS, while it was searching in the Falkland Sound area. Poor weather had forced the Argentine craft to <b>abandon</b> <b>their</b> original mission of bombing Mount Longdon, and the third Dagger of their formation had suffered a mechanical failure and returned to base. The Lynx began evasive manoeuvres and dodged the attacks; the pilot, Lieutenant Christopher Clayton, was mentioned in despatches for his efforts.|$|E
5|$|Strikebreakers {{made another}} attempt to move the streetcars into their carhouses {{to protect them from}} being vandalized.

The rioters fled, and the police resumed their attempt to move the cars only to have the rioters renew the attack. Strikebreakers opened fire on the crowd; four rioters were killed. Numerous injuries were reported, including among the policemen. The rioters eventually overpowered the police and strikebreakers and forced them to <b>abandon</b> <b>their</b> efforts.|$|E
5|$|The American Crocodile (Crocodylus acutus) is also {{native to}} the region and has been {{designated}} as endangered since 1975. Unlike their relatives the alligators, crocodiles tend to thrive in brackish or salt-water habitats such as estuarine or marine coasts. Their most significant threat is disturbance by people. Too much contact with humans causes females to <b>abandon</b> <b>their</b> nests, and males in particular are often victims of vehicle collisions while roaming over large territories and attempting to cross U.S. 1 and Card Sound Road in the Florida Keys. There are an estimated 500 to 1,000crocodiles in southern Florida.|$|E

5|$|The coastal column shelled the Israeli {{positions}} and inflicted enormous damage; the Israelis were either dug in within shallow trenches made for infantry warfare with no head cover, or in Samakh's clay houses that were vulnerable to heavy weapons.

The deputy commander of the Golani Brigade, Tzvika Levkov, also arrived at the station, and called reinforcements from Sha'ar HaGolan and Tiberias, which did not manage to arrive on time.|$|E
5|$|The convoy {{stopped for}} a few hours at Buna on 3 September, where men on the LCIs were allowed to disembark. At around 12:15, nine Japanese Betty bombers {{attacked}} the landing craft at Morobe, but inflicted no damage or casualties. On the night of 3/4 September, the final voyage to the landing beaches began. The landing was preceded by a short naval bombardment from five US destroyers. It was unopposed by Japanese land forces, with the small number of Japanese that were guarding the shore choosing to <b>abandon</b> <b>their</b> posts rather than fight.|$|E
5|$|The {{opposing}} armies met at {{the village}} of Albuera. Both sides suffered heavily in the ensuing struggle and the French finally withdrew on 18 May.
