First, a new architecture composed of licensed <b>authentication</b> <b>centers</b> (LACs) for inter-domain authentication is introduced, in which security associations (SAs) are created and modified on demand, thus {{reducing the number of}} SAs and dynam-ically adjusting the lifetime of an SA. Then, a dynamic SA (DSA) control scheme is developed to determine an optimal threshold time for DSAs by using a utility function for maximizing the bandwidth efficiency.

To address these problems, the architecture of ID/locator separation {{is the focus of}} future Internet development. However, the relevant authentication mechanism has not been proposed under this architecture. In this paper, we advance a new authentication mechanism called AuMID under ID/locator separation architecture, and describe the detailed procedures of access authentication and handoff authentication, and simultaneously give the deployment of <b>authentication</b> <b>centers.</b> Besides, AuMID uniquely introduces the Identity Tag which represents the terminal’s identity information to implement the sustainable authentication forthe terminal. This mechanism adopts the challenge-response approach and achieves the double-way authentication between the terminal and access network. At the same time, by the use of Identify Tag AuMID successfully guarantees the authenticity of the source under ID/locator separation architecture. In conclusion, this paper gives a qualitative analysis for the scalability and security of this AuMID and an evaluation of handoff authentication delay...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to review the chemical and genetic methods used in authentication of ginseng, especially the recent advances in microsatellite genotyping and its application to the authentication of other traditional Chinese medicines (TCM). The standardization and modernization of TCM hinge on the authentication of their botanical identities. Analysis of well-characterized marker compounds is now the most popular method for identifying the herbal materials and quality control of TCM, eg, ginsenoside profiling for authentication of Panax species. However, in many herbal species the chemical composition of the plant changes with the external environment and processing conditions, which lowers the reliability of these authentication methods. In the light of the advances in molecular biotechnology in the past few decades, genetic tools are now considered to provide more standardized and reliable methods for authentication of herbal materials at the DNA level. These genetic tools include random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), DNA fingerprinting using multi-loci probes, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), and microsatellite marker technology. The practicality of these methods varies in terms of their sensitivity, reliability, reproducibility, and running cost. Using ginseng as an example, we reviewed the advantages and limitations of these molecular techniques in TCM authentication. We have developed a set of microsatellite markers from American ginseng that are able to differentiate Panax ginseng and Panax quinquetolius with the resolution down to farm level, ie, confirmation of its botanical identity and origin. Compared with other molecular techniques, microsatellite marker technology is more robust, accurate, reproducible, reliable, and sensitive.

40|$|Abstract — In network security, key {{distribution}} {{is responsible for}} delivering a key to two parties who wish {{to communicate with each}} other in a secure manner. The strength of any secure communication system relies on {{key distribution}} and as a result it is really important to have a secure key distribution protocol because if an eavesdropper succeeds to obtain the secure key, the entire system is compromised. The existing classical key distribution systems can be defeated with a possession of high-speed computers. On the other hand, quantum key distribution is much more secure than any other classical key distribution systems due to the laws of quantum mechanics that helps to detect eavesdroppers on a communication channel. Therefore, in this paper a new quantum key distribution based on <b>Authentication</b> And Bases <b>Center</b> (AABC) is introduced to be used in a wireless environment. The proposed protocol utilizes a new approach by involving a third party called <b>Authentication</b> And Bases <b>Center</b> (AABC).

The Fovea center and the Optic disc are used as reference points for compensating the unwanted rotational and translational effects. The maximum principal curvature of the Hessian matrix of the intensity image is used along with some image filtering to segment the blood vessel structure. Then the skeleton of the binary image and corresponding blood vessel intersection points are extracted using two proposed algorithms.

However, at this stage, there is no standard technique for access control in M-services.

The access control architecture involves a Trusted Credential Center (TCC), a Trusted <b>Authentication</b> and Registration <b>Center</b> (TARC) and a secure ticket based mechanism for service access.

In [17], Chen et al. proposed a game theoretical anti-jamming scheme and modeled the jamming and anti-jamming process as a Markov decision process. With this approach, secondary users are able to avoid the jamming attack launched by external attackers. In [18], Jo et al. proposed a selfish attack detection technique, COOPON (called cooperative neighboring cognitive radio nodes). However, this approach needs to detect and decide the secondary users as legitimate SU (LSU) or selfish SU (SSU) through comparing the reported data one by one while selecting a reliable user as the comparison object. In this case, it is bound to bring a large consumption of calculation when lots of secondary users are in this scheme. In order to improve the cooperative detection performance, Ding et al. in [19] designed a joint spatio-temporal spectrum sensing algorithm, which based on three phases (i.e., a global cooperation phase, a local cooperation phase, and a joint decision phase).

40|$|Abstract—In {{universal}} {{mobile telecommunication}} system (UMTS), authentication functions are utilized {{to identify and}} authenticate a mobile station (MS) and validate the service request type {{to ensure that the}} user is authorized to use the particular network services. The authenticating parties are the <b>authentication</b> <b>center</b> (AuC) in the home network and the MS. In UMTS, the serving general packet radio service support node (SGSN) accesses the AuC to obtain the authentication data, and delegates the AuC to perform mutual authentication with the MS. Since the cost for accessing AuC is expensive, the SGSN may obtain an array of authentication vectors (AVs) at a time so that the number of accesses can be reduced. On the other hand, if the size of the AV array is large, the AV array transmission from the AuC to the SGSN may be expensive. Thus, it is desirable to select an appropriate value to minimize the authentication network signaling cost. We propose an analytic model to investigate the impact of on the network signaling traffic, which is validated by simulation experiments. Then, we propose an automatic-selection mechanism that dynamically selects the size of the AV array to reduce the network signaling cost. Our study indicates that the automatic-selection mechanism effectively identifies appropriate size of the authentication vector array.
