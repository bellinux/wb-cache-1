40|$|Rivers in the Kruger National Park, eastern South Africa, are characterised by bedrock-influenced "macrochannels" {{containing}} variable alluvial thicknesses and {{riparian vegetation}} assemblages. Evidence from the Sabie and Olifants rivers suggests that flows up to moderate floods (3 s − 1) tend {{to result in}} net <b>alluviation,</b> with sediments gradually covering the underlying bedrock. More extreme floods strip alluvium and erode bedrock, effectively exerting the primary control over long-term river morphologic development. On the Olifants River, post-flood aerial LIDAR imagery reveals that the 2012 extreme flood (~ 14000 m 3 s − 1) resulted in extensive stripping of stored alluvial sediment, exposing and eroding the underlying weathered bedrock. On the Sabie River, preliminary optically stimulated luminescence ages for remnant alluvium are all less than 1000 years, highlighting typical timescales of sediment storage.

40|$|Although {{the effects}} of {{sedimentation}} in caves have been recognised for many years, its role in speleogenesis is frequently overlooked. Influxes of sediment into a cave system fundamentally alter the way cave passages develop, either by <b>alluviation</b> in a vadose environment, forcing lateral corrosion {{and the development of}} notches, or by upwards dissolution in a phreatic environment through a process known as paragenesis. Sediment influxes affect the hydrological functioning of a karst aquifer by changing the way conduits behave and subsequently develop both in plan and long section. Here we give an overview of the mechanisms of cave sedimentation and describe how the process of <b>alluviation</b> and paragenesis affect speleogenesis. A characteristic suite of meso- and micro-scale dissolutional features can be used to recognise paragenetic development, which is reviewed here. In a vadose environment these include alluvial notches, whilst in a phreatic environment, half tubes, anastomoses and pendants, bedrock fins and paragenetic dissolution ramps result. Using these to identify phases of sedimentation and paragenesis is crucial for reconstructing denudation chronologies from cave deposits. We suggest that sedimentation and paragenesis are most likely to occur in certain geomorphological situations, such as ice marginal and periglacial environments, beneath thick residual soils and where rivers can transport fluvial sediment into a cave, either via stream sinks or back-flooding. ...|$|E

40|$|Summary: In the 1950 s, {{increased}} erosion, {{flooding and}} sedimentation was widely observed in New Zealand. The ruling opinion then {{was that the}} forests prevented erosion and floods, and browsing mammals were primarily responsible for the increased erosion of mountain lands. It followed that effective control of browsing mammal populations was necessary to prevent erosion and alleviate lowland flooding and <b>alluviation.</b> In the 19608 evidence was found for much severe erosion on the Ruahines in the 1840 s-long before browsing mammals were there. Furthermore, four severe periods of erosion had affected the Ruahines, Ureweras and elsewhere, since the 13 th century and each had ended regardless of humans, and without their assistance. By 1985 I was {{able to show that}} there have been at least seven other periods of accelerated erosion since 180 AD, similar to, but greater than, the current one. These were long before even Polynesians and their animals had arrived in New Zealand. The present period of increased erosion and <b>alluviation</b> is primarily the consequence of atmospheric warming and the bigger rainstorms and floods it brings. Browsing mammals have not contributed significantly but they do reduce the density of the vegetation which minimises normal soil erosion and hence the concentrations of fine sediments in streams. The primary objectives in managing browsing mammals should be to: (a) protect the indigenous vegetation for itself and as habitats of native animals, and (b) enhance the beneficial effects of vegetation on the stability of surface soil and on water quality...|$|E

40|$|An {{exceptionally}} clear {{record of}} climatic changes has been {{preserved in the}} Quaternary and Tertiary soils and loess deposits of {{the central part of}} the United States. Major extinctions of mammals also coincide with regional breaks in sedimentation, perhaps at glacial maxima. The Quaternary stratigraphy is now well known in this region, with initial Quaternary glaciation succeeding end-Tertiary (Ogallala) <b>alluviation</b> and soil development. The Quaternary (2 ̆ 2 Ice Age 2 ̆ 2) succession of cutting-and-filling cycles that record episodes of glaciation and inter-glaciation begins just after the completion of the main calichecomplex of the end. Ogallala or end-Pliocene (circa 3. 2 m. y. ago). The soils, such as the Sangamon soil-complex, unquestionably document times of equable temperature and abundant rainfall favorable for the growth of plains grasses and other vegetation, as well as for mammals. Unconformities cutting the soils record the onset of drought, followed by dominant colluviation, <b>alluviation,</b> and loess deposition. Since the outwash deposits rest on surfaces of major disconformity, the glacialmaximum is believed to be represented by this widespread erosion of the denuded plains. The retreating ice is represented by outwash and by widespread loess deposition transitional to the next period of interglaciation and significant soil development. Thus, a terrace-cycle is easily recognizable, with the major soils and most-important erosional breaks being of greatest importance. Six couplet-episodes seem to represent progressively diminishing and weaker glaciations through the Quaternary to the present, and there are six valley-fills forming terraces (T- 5 to T- 1, plus the T-O or modern floodplain). The earlier valley-fills, represented in cuts through the terraces, are more complex than the later ones. Similar climatic changes (associated with major extinctions), also with soils, unconformities, and loess deposits, characterize the Medial and Late Tertiary (Oligocene-Pliocene) of the Great Plains.

(2) Eolian deposition from ca. 17 ka to 12 ka, interrupted by periods of pedogenesis, coinciding with late Pleistocene <b>alluviation</b> as local climate became warmer and wetter. (3) A wetter period from 12 to 8. 5 ka corresponding to the peak of summer monsoon influence, during which soils formed relatively quickly by infiltration of eolian silt and clay, and trees and grasses were more abundant. (4) A drier period between ca. 8. 5 and 6 ka during which sheetwash deposits accumulated and more desertlike vegetation was dominant; some dunes were reactivated at ca. 8 ka.

40|$|Mediterranean river {{systems are}} {{particularly}} sensitive to environmental change and often provide good archives to reconstruct fluvial histories. This study investigates river response to environmental change in two steep land river catchments in Corsica. Late Pleistocene <b>alluviation</b> and pedogenic weathering is explored within the Tavignano River basin (- 775 km 2) and river response to Late Holocene (including Little Ice Age) environmental change is {{examined in the}} Figarella catchment (- 132 km 2). A range of geochronological controls has been employed including optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating, a profile development index (POI) determined from pedogenic properties, and lichenometry. This study also examines the potential of a relatively new absolute dating teclmique, terrestrial insitu cosmogenic nuclide dating, for establishing the timing of recent glacial activity in Corsica. Two cosmogenic lOBe nuclide exposure ages of 14. 09 ± 1. 04 k and 12. 70 ± 0. 96 k cal. years suggest that Corsica was glaciated during the Lateglacial period. Although more samples are required to confirm these ages, support for this interpretation is evident from other palaeoenvironmental data in the western Mediterranean and a simple snowpack model simulating Younger Dryas conditions in Corsica. Analysis of the Tavignano alluvial units indicates that Pleistocene glaciation {{is likely to have}} had a strong impact on the river regime and sedimentation style. The timing of the major <b>alluviation</b> phases has been estimated using an age model derived from OSL ages and the POI. Deposition is broadly coeval with the Late Pleistocene cold stages and climate change is therefore considered to be the dominant control on river behaviour during the Late Pleistocene. Lichenometric dating of coarse flood deposits on the Figarella valley floor has established the timing of flood periods since ca. AD 1570. At least ten distinct periods of enhanced flooding are evident over the last five centuries. Flooding was particularly prominent during the 1500 s, mid-late 1700 s and throughout the 1800 s in the Figarella, corresponding to particularly cold and wet periods. The apparent synchrony of flood events across the Mediterranean region during the Little Ice Age suggests that climate variability over the past 500 years has been the overriding control on flood frequency in Corsica.

A simulation model is presented to gain insight into the threedimensional subsurface distribution, visibility, and preservation potential of the archaeological record in a meander-floodplain system as a function of geomorphic history. Simulation results indicate that fluvial cut-fill cycles can strongly influence the density of archaeological material in the subsurface. Thus, interpretation of floodplain habitation based solely upon features visible in the shallow subsurface (through traditional techniques such as aerial photography and geophysical prospection) can be misleading. In the examples, the loss of archaeological record by channel migration ranges between 45 % and 90 % over 12, 000 years for channel belt-dominated systems, decreasing to 10 to 30 % for rivers where the floodplain width is a multiple of channel belt width.

This assumption is not valid in general, and thus can give rise to unphysical consequences. Here we present a unified morphodynamic formulation of both channel incision and <b>alluviation</b> that specifically tracks the spatiotemporal variation in both bedload transport and alluvial thickness. It does so by relating the bedrock cover fraction to the ratio of alluvium thickness to bedrock macro-roughness, rather than to the ratio of bedload supply rate to capacity bedload transport. The new formulation (MRSAA) predicts waves of <b>alluviation</b> and rarification, in addition to bedrock erosion. Embedded in it are three physical processes: alluvial diffusion, fast downstream advection of alluvial disturbances, and slow upstream migration of incisional disturbances. Solutions of this formulation over a fixed bed are used to demonstrate the stripping of an initial alluvial cover, the emplacement of alluvial cover over an initially bare bed and the advection–diffusion of a sediment pulse over an alluvial bed. A solution for alluvial–incisional interaction in a channel with a basement undergoing net rock uplift shows how an impulsive increase in sediment supply can quickly and completely bury the bedrock under thick alluvium, thus blocking bedrock erosion. As the river responds to rock uplift or base level fall, the transition point separating an alluvial reach upstream from an alluvial–bedrock reach downstream migrates upstream {{in the form of a}} "hidden knickpoint". A tectonically more complex case of rock uplift subject to a localized zone of subsidence (graben) yields a steady-state solution that is not attainable with the original saltation–abrasion model. A solution for the case of bedrock–alluvial coevolution upstream of an alluviated river mouth illustrates how the bedrock surface can be progressively buried not far below the alluvium. Because the model tracks the spatiotemporal variation in both bedload transport and alluvial thickness, it is applicable to the study of the incisional response of a river subject to temporally varying sediment supply. It thus has the potential to capture the response of an alluvial–bedrock river to massive impulsive sediment inputs associated with landslides or debris flows...|$|E
40|$|Oxbow lakes are of high {{ecological}} importance due to {{the number}} and the diversity of habitats they provide. They are created after the abandonment of meanders and subsequent sediment infilling leads to their progressive terrestrialisation, taking from a few months up to several centuries. Nonetheless, {{little is known about}} oxbow lake terrestrialisation processes, sediment composition, or why such a disparity exists in lakes’ longevity. To understand the controls on oxbow lakes <b>alluviation,</b> field observations, remotely sensed data and GIS analyses were combined. Sediment transfers in oxbow lakes were documented by topographic and sampling surveys of sites in France and Wales. Aerial photographs and maps were used to date cutoff events, analyse oxbow lakes geometry, and understand the controls on oxbow lake terrestrialisation for eight rivers of different characteristics. Findings from this study illustrate that the specific mechanism by which an oxbow lake is formed is critical to its persistence as a lake and to the sedimentary processes experienced. Chute cutoff oxbow lakes filled in 10 times faster than neck cutoffs and showed significantly different sediment deposits. Results also highlighted that oxbow lakes are not only fine-grained sediment stores, as often referred to, but can be significant bed material sinks since a site on the Ain River sequestered up to 34...|$|E
40|$|New Zealand {{provides}} a useful environment to test {{the notion that the}} Anthropocene is a new geological epoch. There are two well-dated anthropogenic impact ?events?: Polynesian settlement c. AD 1280, and European colonisation c. AD 1800. Little attention, however, has been given to regional catchment response to these, although it has been assumed that both Polynesian and European farming and land use management practices significantly increased erosion rates across most of New Zealand. This paper addresses the nature and timing of human impacts on river systems using meta-analysis of a recently compiled nationwide database of radiocarbon-dated fluvial deposits. This shows highly variable human impacts on erosion and sedimentation in river systems, which are often difficult to separate from naturally driven river activity. Catchment-scale data with high resolution dating control record clearer evidence of human disturbance. In Northland, anthropogenic <b>alluviation</b> is recorded from c. AD 1300 linked to early Polynesian settlement, enhanced further in the late 19 th and 20 th centuries by European land clearance, when sedimentation rates exceeded 25 ?mm?year? 1. This study demonstrates significant geographical variability in the timing of human impact on river dynamics in New Zealand, despite two synchronous phases of human settlement, and highlights the difficulty of formally designating a simple and single ?Anthropocene Epoch/Age?.

40|$|Many river systems, within New Zealand and globally, have {{experienced}} rapid acceleration in floodplain sedimentation {{in response to}} anthropogenic catchment disturbance, creating significant issues (i. e., flooding and water quality). Reconstruction of past river responses to environmental- and anthropogenic-driven changes in sedimentation and erosion can provide valuable insights into these river dynamics. This research uses LiDAR data, sedimentology, radiocarbon chronology, XRF analysis and GPR to examine pre- and post-settlement <b>alluviation</b> of the Kaeo River, and floodplain sedimentation in Northland, New Zealand. In Kaeo, rapid rates of post-settlement floodplain aggradation, equating to over 4 m of interbedded sand and silt alluvium in a partly-confined valley setting, have created considerable contemporary flooding issues. Radiocarbon dates indicate that terrestrially sourced sedimentation commenced at 7680 ? 7570 cal. yr BP, and continued at an average rate of < 1 mm yr? 1. Under conditions of limited accommodation space, the Holocene floodplain has accumulated at a faster average rate (8 ? 13. 5 mm yr? 1) {{in the last several}} hundred years in response to anthropogenic catchment disturbance following M?ori and European settlement. This response mirrors the general trend for Northland floodplains, where there has been rapid accumulation of floodplains (3 ? 10 mm yr? 1) in the last 1000 yrPeer reviewe...|$|E
