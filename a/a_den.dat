5|$|Octopuses inhabit various {{regions of}} the ocean, {{including}} coral reefs, pelagic waters, and the seabed; some live in the intertidal zone and others at abyssal depths. Most species grow fast, mature early and are short-lived. During breeding, the male uses a specially adapted arm to deliver a bundle of sperm directly into the female's mantle cavity, after which he becomes senescent and dies. The female deposits fertilised eggs in <b>a</b> <b>den</b> and cares for them until they hatch, after which she also dies.|$|E
5|$|Like wolves, coyotes use <b>a</b> <b>den</b> (usually {{the deserted}} holes of other species) when gestating and rearing young, {{though they may}} {{occasionally}} give birth under sagebrushes in the open. Coyote dens can be located in canyons, washouts, coulees, banks, rock bluffs, or level ground. Some dens have been found under abandoned homestead shacks, grain bins, drainage pipes, railroad tracks, hollow logs, thickets, and thistles. The den is continuously dug and cleaned out by the female until the pups are born. Should the den be disturbed or infested with fleas, the pups are moved into another den. A coyote den can have several entrances and passages branching out from the main chamber. A single den can be used year after year.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species are}} solitary when not mating, {{though a few}} are known to occur in high densities and with {{frequent}} interactions, signaling, mate defending and eviction of individuals from dens. This is likely the result of abundant food supplies combined with limited den sites. Octopuses hide in dens, which are typically crevices in rocky outcrops or other hard structures, though some species burrow into sand or mud. Octopuses are not territorial but generally remain in a home range; they may leave the area in search of food. They can use navigation skills to return to <b>a</b> <b>den</b> without having to retrace their outward route. They are not known to be migratory.|$|E

5|$|Series 4 {{began on}} 21 September 1996 with the {{introduction}} of new presenters Zoe Ball and Jamie Theakston and with them came an array of new features. One such item was called Cloud 9 which replaced the former Famous For Five Minutes. Sitting in <b>a</b> <b>den</b> surrounded by sparkles, pink feather boas and harps, 'Zoe would ring up an unsuspecting viewer who had been nominated by their friend or family and make their lifelong dream or ambition come true.

Cloud 9 also used an edited version of Dreams (The Developed Arrested Mix) by Gabrielle as its theme tune.|$|E
5|$|There {{are other}} youth {{positions}} of responsibility in a troop; {{the use of}} these positions is dependent {{on the size of the}} troop and the program. The junior assistant Scoutmaster (JASM) is a 16- or 17-year-old Scout who performs the same duties as an assistant Scoutmaster; the scribe takes minutes at patrol leaders council meetings and troop meetings and is often responsible for taking attendance and collecting money or dues; the quartermaster maintains the troop's equipment; the librarian maintains the troop library; the chaplain aide works with the troop chaplain and promotes the religious program in the troop; the troop historian maintains photos and records of troop functions, meetings and outings; <b>a</b> <b>den</b> chief works with <b>a</b> <b>den</b> of Cub Scouts, assisting the den leaders and helps retain Cub Scouts when they cross over into Boy Scouts; the troop guide is a senior Scout who provides guidance to new Scout patrols; the Leave No Trace Coordinator ensures the Scouts are trained in and follow Leave No Trace Guidelines; the Order of the Arrow representative provides a line of communication between the Order of the Arrow and the troop; the bugler provides music as needed; the instructor teaches Scout skills. These troop positions are appointed by the senior patrol leader with the advice and counsel of the Scoutmaster, except for the Junior Assistant Scoutmaster, who is appointed by the Scoutmaster.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a young {{traveller}} named Bartz, {{resting in}} the woods near Tycoon, witnesses a meteorite plunge to the planet's surface just outside the castle. Bartz promptly investigates, discovering Lenna lying unconscious from attack. After rescuing her, they discover {{an old man in}} the debris with partial amnesia named Galuf. Lenna explains that she had been {{on her way to the}} Wind Shrine after her father. Galuf suddenly recalls that it was his original destination as well, opting to accompany her. Though the trio part ways, Bartz soon encounters Lenna and Galuf again assaulted by monsters in a quaking valley. The three travel together, finding all land routes blockaded by the upheavals caused by the meteorite's fall. Exploring an underground cavern, they encounter <b>a</b> <b>den</b> of pirates and their leader, Faris. With the help of the pirate captain, the group makes its way to the Wind Shrine to discover the shattered Crystal, but no sign of the missing king. The shards react to their presence, however, and an image of Tycoon appears, explaining to them that they must protect those Crystals that yet remain.|$|E

5|$|The age {{of first}} {{breeding}} in gray wolves {{depends largely on}} environmental factors: when food is plentiful, or when wolf populations are heavily managed, wolves can rear pups at younger ages {{in order to better}} exploit abundant resources. This is further demonstrated by the fact that captive wolves have been known to breed as soon as they reach 9–10 months, while the youngest recorded breeding wolves in the wild were 2 years old. Females are capable of producing pups every year, with one litter annually being the average. Unlike the coyote, the gray wolf never reaches reproductive senescence. Estrus typically occurs in late winter, with older, multiparous females entering estrus 2–3 weeks earlier than younger females. During pregnancy, female wolves remain in <b>a</b> <b>den</b> located away from the peripheral zone of their territories, where violent encounters with other packs are more likely. Old females usually whelp in the den of their previous litter, while younger females typically den near their birthplace. The gestation period lasts 62–75 days, with pups usually being born in the summer period.|$|E

25|$|Female wolverines burrow into snow in February {{to create}} <b>a</b> <b>den,</b> {{which is used}} until weaning in mid-May. Areas {{inhabited}} nonseasonally by wolverines are thus restricted to zones with late-spring snowmelts. This fact has led to concern that global warming will shrink the ranges of wolverine populations.|$|E
25|$|The {{striped hyena}} is monogamous, with the male helping the female to {{establish}} <b>a</b> <b>den,</b> raise young and feed her when cubs are born. The mating season {{varies according to}} location; in Transcaucasia, hyenas breed in January–February, while those in southeast Turkmenia breed in October–November. In captivity, breeding is non-seasonal. Mating can occur {{at any time of}} the day, during which the male grips the skin of the female's neck.|$|E

25|$|The {{north end}} of the park became the center of a local {{controversy}} in the late 1990s. It is home to <b>a</b> <b>den</b> of Eastern timber rattlesnakes, a New York State threatened species. The state's Department of Environmental Conservation brought suit to stop the snake-proof fences a local quarry operator had put up while it was applying for permission to mine stone from the operation. In 1999 then-Attorney General Eliot Spitzer persuaded a court to order the fence be torn down. It survived appeal, and became a legal precedent establishing New York's right to enforce the state's Endangered Species Act on private property.|$|E
25|$|Grizzly bears {{hibernate}} for 5–7 months {{each year}} except where {{the climate is}} warm, as the California grizzly did not hibernate. During this time, female grizzly bears give birth to their offspring, who then consume milk from their mother and gain strength {{for the remainder of}} the hibernation period. To prepare for hibernation, grizzlies must prepare <b>a</b> <b>den,</b> and consume an immense amount of food as they do not eat during hibernation. Grizzly bears do not defecate or urinate throughout the entire hibernation period. The male grizzly bear's hibernation ends in early to mid-March, while females emerge in April or early May.|$|E
25|$|The council {{shoulder}} patch (known as the CSP) is an arc-shaped patch worn {{at the top}} of {{the sleeve}} that identifies the local council. Below this, Scouts at the unit level wear a unit number and units with veteran status may wear a veteran unit bar above the numbers. Lone Cub Scouts and Lone Scouts wear the Lone Scout emblem in place of the unit numeral. On the new (2008) style official shirt, the badge of office is centered on the pocket, but on the older official uniform shirts, the badge of office is centered and touching the bottom of the unit numeral, or centered 4inches below the shoulder seam. When earned for the current position, the green lettering Trained leader strip is centered {{at the top of}} the pocket flap on the new style official shirt, but on the older official uniform shirts, the red lettering Trained leader strip is centered immediately below and touching the badge of office. Qualified commissioners may wear the Commissioner Arrowhead Honor in the bottom-most position (or if wearing the first version of the Centennial shirt, immediately below the Council Shoulder Strip in the location where a unit number would be worn). Youth who are serving as <b>a</b> <b>Den</b> Chief may wear <b>a</b> <b>Den</b> Chief cord around the left shoulder and under the shoulder strap instead of the emblem. Den Chiefs who earn the Den Chief Service Award may wear the service award cord in addition to the den chief cord, and may continue to wear it for as long as they are a youth.|$|E
