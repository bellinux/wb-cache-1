[...] UV-vis spectroscopy is a very useful tool for the determination of the changes of electronic states due to the SCO.

The energy difference between successive J terms in any of these triplets is about 2 cm−1 (60 GHz), with the single exception of J = 1←0 difference which is about 4 cm−1. Selection rules for magnetic dipole transitions allow transitions between successive members of the triplet (ΔJ = ±1) so that for each value of the rotational angular momentum quantum number K there are two <b>allowed</b> <b>transitions.</b> The 16O nucleus has zero nuclear spin angular momentum, so that symmetry considerations demand that K have only odd values.|$|E

50|$|TPA is a {{nonlinear}} optical process. In particular, {{the imaginary}} {{part of the}} third-order nonlinear susceptibility {{is related to the}} extent of TPA in a given molecule.

In quantum mechanical terms, this difference results from the need to conserve angular momentum. Since photons have spin of ±1, one-photon absorption requires excitation to involve an electron changing its molecular orbital to one with an angular momentum different by ±1.

50|$|It {{has been}} found that, when the bonds are {{considered}} vibrating simple-harmonically, the transition dipole moment is non-zero only for the transition where ∆v=±1. Hence; for the ideal, non-existent, simple-harmonically vibrating bond; there can never be any overtone observed in the vibrational spectrum.But, real molecules do not vibrate simple-harmonically. The potential function vibration is not parabolic, simple-harmonic potential, but is better approximated by the Morse potential. When Schrödinger equation is solved for the molecule under consideration with Morse potential as the potential function, one gets the functional forms of the vibrational energy eigenstates with the interesting property that when one calculates transition dipole moment corresponding to transitions from various energy levels to various other energy levels, the transition dipole moment does not become zero for the transitions where ∆v=±2,±3,±4, etc. Thus, for real molecules, the <b>allowed</b> <b>transitions</b> are those for which ∆v=±1,±2,±3,±4, etc. The overtone band observed in the IR spectrum is one such transition with ∆v=2, from v=0 to v=2 energy state.|$|E
