25|$|Perisho's partially-clothed {{body was}} found on July 16, 1989, near the North Pine Channel Bridge at Big Pine Key, where Perisho, who was homeless, lived on a dinghy. Perisho's throat had been slashed and her head had been nearly severed; like Jones, her body was {{extensively}} mutilated <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> was removed. Perisho was found less than 1,000 feet from where Brandt lived, and Brandt's appearance matched a composite sketch of a man seen crossing U.S. Route 1 near where Perisho was discovered on the night she was murdered. Based on this evidence, Monroe County investigators determined that Brandt killed Perisho and officially closed the case on May 6, 2006.|$|E

60|$|Up she sprung, eyes clear now, nerves steady, faith strong. Leaning {{forward so}} utterly forgetful of herself, {{she would have}} fallen into the green water {{tumbling}} there below, had not her father held her fast.

500|$|... "Telephone"'s lyrics {{relate to}} the singer preferring the dance floor to {{answering}} someone's call. She further tells her lover that she left her head <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> on the dance floor. [...] The verses are sung in a rapid-fire way, accompanied by double beats. According to Gaga, the phone addressed in the lyrics of the song {{is not just a}} physical phone, but also a person in her head telling her to keep working harder and harder. Gaga explained, [...] "That's my fear—that the phone's ringing and my head's ringing,... Whether it's a telephone or it's just the thoughts in your head, that's another fear." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Glassheart" [...] is an up-tempo dance {{song that}} {{incorporates}} elements of dubstep, grime and house music. Lyrically, {{it is about}} a woman's fear that her boyfriend will leave her and thus she protects her emotions <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> from breaking. The song received positive reviews from music critics, many of whom praised the musical direction and its grimy, dubstep breakdown. Upon the release of Glassheart, the song debuted at number 27 on the UK Dance Chart due to strong digital download sales {{during the first week}} of Glasshearts release. It debuted at number 167 on the UK Singles Chart. Lewis has performed the song at London nightclub G-A-Y and an acoustic version for UK newspaper The Suns Biz Sessions.|$|E
500|$|How the García Girls Lost Their Accents is {{rife with}} the {{constant}} presence of fear which manifests itself in a seemingly endless variety of outlets. Alvarez depicts quite vividly the fear evoked in the girls' mother, Laura, near the chronological beginning of the book, as she [...] "sees the black V.W. , <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> plummets right down to her toes". Even after the García family has spent several years in the United States, safe {{from the threat of}} Trujillo's retribution, a relentless paranoia continues to plague Carlos, their father, [...] "who still lives in fear of the SIM and who is afraid to speak of 'revolt' out loud". This initial fear of Carlos' punishment {{for his role in the}} attempted assassination of Trujillo is what originally prompted the García family’s flight from the island and spawned the myriad other fears that would later plague their lives. The conflicted life the daughters would come to lead in the sexually liberated United States would be haunted by the fear of pregnancy and eternal damnation should they allow themselves to be seduced.|$|E

500|$|Ritvo {{developed}} cardiomyopathy, {{which had}} killed her brother Louis {{at the age}} of 38, as well as her father at age 73. [...] She had been plagued by unusual fatigue since 1998, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> condition was formally diagnosed in January, 2001. She began taking medication and trained on a limited basis from 2003 to 2005, starting about 100 horses in that period, with 15 wins. However, her condition deteriorated. She started only one horse in 2005 and had no starters from 2006 until 2009. In 2008, {{at the age of}} 39, she was placed on a waiting list for a heart transplant. After a seven-month wait, an organ became available on November 13, 2008, and Ritvo received her new heart that day in an operation that lasted 17 hours. [...] She had been hospitalized for most of the previous six months, and {{at the time of her}} surgery her doctors assessed her as having only about two weeks to live. She was discharged from the hospital seven days after her surgery. She later gave a letter to the hospital to pass on to the organ donor's family, but has never heard from them. Ritvo has stated that she wants the donor's family to know she is thankful for her new heart, but respects their privacy.|$|E
500|$|The Loogaroo is {{an example}} of how a vampire belief can result from a {{combination}} of beliefs, here a mixture of French and African Vodu or voodoo. The term Loogaroo possibly comes from the French loup-garou (meaning 'werewolf') and is common in the culture of Mauritius. However, the stories of the Loogaroo are widespread through the Caribbean Islands and Louisiana in the United States. During the late 18th and 19th centuries, there was a widespread belief in vampires in parts of New England, particularly in Rhode Island and Eastern Connecticut. There are many documented cases of families disinterring loved ones and removing their hearts in the belief that the deceased was a vampire who was responsible for sickness and death in the family, although the term [...] "vampire" [...] was never actually used to describe the deceased. The deadly disease tuberculosis, or [...] "consumption" [...] as it was known at the time, was believed to be caused by nightly visitations on the part of a dead family member who had died of consumption themselves. The most famous, and most recently recorded, case of suspected vampirism is that of nineteen-year-old Mercy Brown, who died in Exeter, Rhode Island in 1892. Her father, assisted by the family physician, removed her from her tomb two months after her death <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> was cut out and burnt to ashes.|$|E
2500|$|On 7 December 1893 Josephine Bakhita {{entered the}} novitiate of the Canossian Sisters and on 8 December 1896 {{she took her}} vows, welcomed by Cardinal Sarto. In 1902 she was {{assigned}} to the Canossian convent at Schio, in the northern Italian province of Vicenza, where she spent the rest of her life. Her only extended time away was between 1935 and 1939, when she stayed at the Missionary Novitiate in Vimercate (Milan); mostly visiting other Canossian communities in Italy, talking about her experiences and helping to prepare young sisters for work in Africa. A strong missionary drive animated her throughout her entire life - [...] "her mind was always on God, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> in Africa".|$|E

2500|$|Unfortunately for Waddingham, the man {{in charge}} of cremations was Dr Cyril Banks, who was also the Medical Officer for Health in Nottingham. Banks had never thought highly of Waddingham's {{establishment}} as a so-called [...] "nursing home", and knew there was no State Registered Nurse on the staff (as there should have been). He became suspicious at the note from Ada Baguley that authorised cremation and ordered a post-mortem. The post-mortem found no traces of anything connected to Ada's physical conditions that could have immediately caused death. This led to an analysis of the organs of the deceased by Dr W. W. Taylor, Senior Assistant to the Nottingham Analyst. He found considerable traces of morphine (over three grains) in her stomach, liver, kidneys <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>heart.</b>|$|E
2500|$|She {{rang the}} wall-crank phone two times before being shot {{twice in the}} face from the same window. One bullet entered her right cheek and exited behind her left ear. The other went in her lower jaw just below the lip, {{breaking}} it and splintering out several teeth before lodging under her tongue. She dropped to her knees but soon managed to get on her feet. She ran to get a pistol from the living room, but she was blinded by her own blood. She heard the killer tearing loose the rusted screen wire on the back porch. She {{thought she was going}} to be killed, so she stumbled toward her bedroom near the front of the house to leave a note. Meanwhile, the killer ran to the back of the house and made his way up the steps and into the side-screened porch through the back screen door. She heard the killer coming through the kitchen window, so she turned around and ran through the dining room, through the bedroom, down a hallway, through another bedroom, and then into the living room and out the front door, leaving behind a [...] "virtual river of blood" [...] and teeth throughout the house and across the street. Barefooted and still in her blood-soaked nightgown, she ran across the street to her sister and brother-in-law's house. Since no one was home, she ran 50yards more to A. V. Prater's house. Prater answered her call for help. She gasped, [...] "Virgil's dead", then collapsed. Prater shot a rifle in the air to summon another neighbor, Elmer Taylor. Prater called to Taylor to bring his car because Mr. and Mrs. Starks had been shot. Taylor, along with Mr. and Mrs. Prater and their baby, rode with Mrs. Starks to Michael Meagher Hospital (now Miller County Health Unit) at 503 Walnut Street. Mrs. Starks gave Mr. Taylor, the driver, one of her teeth with a gold filling. She was in a semi-conscious state, slumping forward on the front seat. Although she lost a considerable amount of blood, she showed no signs of going into shock <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>heart</b> rate remained normal. Miller County Sheriff W. E. Davis, who became head of the investigation, questioned Mrs. Starks in the operating room at Michael Meagher Hospital. The news was printed on the front page the next morning, on Saturday May 4, reading [...] "MURDER ROCKS CITY AGAIN; FARMER SLAIN, WIFE WOUNDED". Four days later, Sheriff Davis talked with Mrs. Starks again at the hospital. Mrs. Starks discounted a rumor that was circulating about Virgil hearing a car outside his home several nights in a row, fearing of being killed.|$|E
