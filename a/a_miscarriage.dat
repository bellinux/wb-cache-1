40|$|Inherited {{paternal}} HLA antigens {{from the}} semi-allogeneic fetus may trigger maternal immune responses during pregnancy, {{leading to the}} production of child-specific HLA antibodies. The prevalence of these HLA antibodies increases with the number of successful pregnancies. In the present study we investigated the effect of <b>a</b> single prior <b>miscarriage</b> on HLA antibody formation during a subsequent successful pregnancy. Women with a successful pregnancy with one or more prior miscarriages (n= 229) and women with a successful pregnancy without <b>a</b> prior <b>miscarriage</b> (n= 58) and their children were HLA typed. HLA-antibody analyses were performed in these women to identify whether HLA antibodies were formed against mismatched HLA class-I antigens of the last child. The percentage of immunogenic antigens was significantly lower after a single successful pregnancy that was preceded by <b>a</b> single <b>miscarriage</b> (n= 18 women) compared to a successful pregnancy that was preceded by a first successful pregnancy (n= 62 women). Thus, our data suggest that <b>a</b> previous <b>miscarriage</b> has <b>a</b> different impact on child-specific HLA antibody formation during a subsequent successful pregnancy than a previous successful pregnancy. The lower immunogenicity in these women cannot be explained by reduced numbers of immunogenic B-cell and T-cell epitopes. In conclusion, our observations indicate that increasing gravidity is not related to an increased prevalence of HLA antibodies in a single successful pregnancy that was preceded by <b>a</b> single prior <b>miscarriage...</b>|$|R

5|$|In his High Court appeal Dietrich was {{represented}} by David Grace, QC.

Alternatively, he argued that the judge should have stayed or adjourned the trial until he was able to obtain counsel himself. His argument was based on the common law tradition that an accused is entitled to a fair trial.|$|E
