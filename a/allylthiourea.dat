Although the recombinant strain produced bioluminescence {{due to the}} expression of the luxAB genes under normal growing conditions, the intensity of the light emission decreased immediately, in a time-and dose-dependent manner, with the addition of ammonia monooxygenase inhibitors, such as <b>allylthiourea,</b> phenol, and nitrapyrin. When whole cells were challenged with several nitrification inhibitors and toxic compounds, a close relationship was found between the change in the intensity of the light emission and the level of ammonia-oxidizing activity. The response of bioluminescence to the addition of <b>allylthiourea</b> was considerably faster than the change in the ammonia-oxidizing rate, measured as both the O 2 uptake and NO 2 − production rates. The bioluminescence of cells inactivated by ammonia monooxygenase inhibitor was recovered rapidly by the addition of certain substrates for hydroxylamine oxidoreductase. These results suggested that the inhibition of bioluminescence was caused by the immediate decrease of reducing power in the cell due to the inactivation of ammonia monooxygenase, {{as well as by the}} destruction of other cellular metabolic pathways.

40|$|Organic sulfur {{compounds}} are well-known nitrification inhibitors. The inhibitory {{effects of}} dimethylsulfide, dimethyldisulfide, and ethanethiol on ammonia oxidation by Nitrosomonas europaea were examined. Both dimethylsulfide and dimethyldisulfide were weak inhibitors of ammonia oxidation and exhibited inhibitory characteristics typical of substrates for ammonia monooxygenase (AMO). Depletion of dimethylsulfide required O 2 and was prevented with either acetylene or <b>allylthiourea,</b> two inhibitors of AMO. The inhibition of ammonia oxidation by dimethylsulfide was examined in detail. Cell suspensions incubated {{in the presence}} of ammonia oxidized dimethylsulfide to dimethyl sulfoxide. Depletion of six other thioethers was also prevented by treating cell suspensions with either <b>allylthiourea</b> or acetylene. The oxidative products of three thioethers were identified as the corresponding sulfoxides. The amount of sulfoxide formed accounted for a majority of the amount of sulfide depleted. By using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, allylmethylsulfide was shown to be oxidized to allylmethylsulfoxide by N. europaea with the incorporation of a single atom of 18 O derived from 18 O 2 into the sulfide. This result supported our conclusion that a monooxygenase was involved in the oxidation of allylmethylsulfide. The thioethers are concluded to be a new class of substrates for AMO. This is the first report of the oxidation of the sulfur atom by AMO in whole cells of N. europaea.

Inactivation was not observed {{in the presence of}} <b>allylthiourea,</b> a specific inhibitor of the enzyme ammonia monooxygenase, or under anaerobic conditions, indicating that the TCE-mediated inactivation required ammonia monooxygenase activity. When N. europaea cells were incubated with [14 C]TCE under conditions which allowed turnover of ammonia monooxygenase, a number of cellular proteins were covalently labeled with 14 C. Treatment of cells with <b>allylthiourea</b> or acetylene prior to incubation with [14 C]TCE prevented incorporation of 14 C into proteins. The ammonia-oxidizing activity of cells inactivated in the presence of TCE could be recovered through a process requiring de novo protein synthesis. In addition to TCE, a series of chlorinated methanes, ethanes, and other ethylenes were screened as substrates for ammonia monooxygenase and for their ability to inactivate the ammonia-oxidizing system of N. europaea. The chlorocarbons could be divided into three classes depending on their biodegradability and inactivating potential: (i) compounds which were not biodegradable by N. europaea and which had no toxic effect on the cells; (ii) compounds which were cooxidized by N. europaea and had little or no toxic effect on the cells; and (iii) compounds which were cooxidized and produced a turnover-dependent inactivation of ammonia oxidation by N. europaea...|$|E

The hydroxylamine oxidoreductase activity (hydrazine-dependent O 2 uptake) of cells was unaffected by allylsulfide. Anaerobic conditions or {{the presence of}} <b>allylthiourea,</b> a reversible noncompetitive AMO inhibitor, protected AMO from inactivation by allylsulfide. Ammonia did not protect AMO from inactivation by allylsulfide but instead increased the rate of inactivation. The inactivation of AMO followed pseudo-first-order kinetics, but the observed rates did not saturate with increasing allylsulfide concentrations. The time course of recovery of AMO-dependent nitrite production after complete inactivation by allylsulfide required de novo protein synthesis. Incubation of cells with allylsulfide prevented the 14 C label from 14 C 2 H 2 (a suicide mechanism-based inactivator of AMO) from being incorporated into the 27 -kDa polypeptide of AMO.

40|$|Photoinactivation {{of ammonia}} {{oxidation}} in cells of Nitrosomonas {{was shown to}} follow first-order kinetics with a rate constant proportional to incident light intensity. The action spectrum for photoinactivation consisted of a broad peak in the ultraviolet range, where both hydroxylamine and ammonia oxidation were affected, and a shoulder at approximately 410 nm where only ammonia oxidation was affected. In photoinactivated cells, hydroxylamine but not ammonia was oxidized to nitrite and hydroxylamine but not ammonia caused reduction of cytochromes in vivo. The amount per cell of the following constituents was not measurably altered by photoinactivation: cytochromes b, c, a, and P 460; ubiquinone; phospholipid; free amino acids; hydroxylamine-dependent nitrite synthetase; nitrite reductase; p-phenylenediamine oxidase; and cytochrome c oxidase. Malonaldehyde or lipid peroxides were not detected in photoinactivated cells. Photoinactivation was prevented (i) under anaerobic conditions, (ii) {{in the presence of}} methanol, <b>allylthiourea,</b> thiosemicarbazide, hydroxylamine, ethylxanthate, or CO at concentrations wich caused 100 % inhibition of ammonia oxidation, and (iii) at concentrations of ammonia or hydroxylamine which gave a rapid rate of nitrite production. Recovery of ammonia oxidation activity in 90 % inactivated cells took place in 6 h, required an energy and/or nitrogen source, and was inhibited by 400 μg of chloramphenicol per ml...|$|E
40|$|Sulfanilic acid (SA) is a toxic {{sulfonated}} {{aromatic amine}} {{commonly found in}} anaerobically treated azo dye contaminated effluents. Aerobic acclimatization of SA-degrading mixed microbial culture could lead to co-enrichment of ammonium-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) because of the concomitant release of ammonium from SA oxidation. To what extent the co-enriched AOB would affect SA oxidation at various ammonium concentrations was unclear. Here, a series of batch kinetic experiments were conducted to evaluate the effect of AOB on aerobic SA degradation in an acclimatized activated sludge culture capable of oxidizing SA and ammonium simultaneously. To account for the effect of AOB on SA degradation, <b>allylthiourea</b> was used to inhibit AOB activity in the culture. The results indicated that specific SA degradation rate of the mixed culture was negatively correlated with the initial ammonium concentration (0 - 93 mM, R²= 0. 99). The presence of AOB accelerated SA degradation by reducing the inhibitory effect of ammonium (≥ 10 mM). The Haldane substrate inhibition model was used to correlate substrate concentration (SA and ammonium) and oxygen uptake rate. This study revealed, for the first time, that AOB could facilitate SA degradation at high concentration of ammonium (≥ 10 mM) in an enriched activated sludge culture...|$|E
40|$|Suspensions of Nitrosomonas europaea catalyzed the reductive {{dehalogenation}} of {{the commercial}} nitrification inhibitor nitrapyrin (2 -chloro- 6 -trichloromethylpyridine). The product of the reaction was identified as 2 -chloro- 6 -dichloromethylpyridine by its mass fragmentation and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. A small amount of 2 -chloro- 6 -dichloromethylpyridine accumulated during the conversion of nitrapyrin to 6 -chloropicolinic acid in an aerated solution {{in the presence of}} ammonia (T. Vannelli and A. B. Hooper, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 58 : 2321 - 2325, 1992). Nearly stoichiometric conversion of nitrapyrin to 2 -chloro- 6 -dichloromethylpyridine occurred at very low oxygen concentrations and in the presence of hydrazine as a source of electrons. Under these conditions the turnover rate was 0. 37 nmol of nitrapyrin per min per mg of protein. Two specific inhibitors of ammonia oxidation, acetylene and <b>allylthiourea,</b> inhibited the rate of the dehalogenation reaction by 80 and 84 %, respectively. In the presence of D 2 O, all 2 -chloro- 6 -dichloromethylpyridine produced in the reaction was deuterated at the methyl position. In an oxygenated solution and in the presence of ammonia or hydrazine, cells did not catalyze the oxidation of exogenously added 2 -chloro- 6 -dichloromethylpyridine to 6 -chloropicolinic acid. Thus, 2 -chloro- 6 -dichloromethylpyridine is apparently not an intermediate in the aerobic production of 6 -chloropicolinic acid from nitrapyrin...|$|E
40|$|The {{first step}} of {{nitrification}} is carried out by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA). It is largely unknown, by which mechanisms these microbes are capable of coexistence and how their respective contribution to ammonia oxidation may differ with varying soil characteristics. To determine how different levels of ammonium availability influence the extent of archaeal and bacterial contributions to ammonia oxidation, microcosm incubations with controlled ammonium levels were conducted. Net nitrification was monitored and ammonia oxidizer communities were quantified. Additionally, the nitrification inhibitor <b>allylthiourea</b> (ATU) was applied to discriminate between archaeal and bacterial contributions to soil ammonia oxidation. Thaumarchaeota, which were the only ammonia oxidizers detectable {{at the start of}} the incubation, grew in all microcosms, but AOB later became detectable and grew as well. Low and high additions of ammonium increasingly stimulated AOB growth, while AOA were only stimulated by the low addition. Treatment with ATU had no effect on net nitrification and sizes of ammonia-oxidizing communities suggesting that the effective concentration of ATU to discriminate between archaeal and bacterial ammonia oxidation is not the same in different soils. Our results support the niche differentiating potential of ammonium concentration for AOA and AOB and we conclude that ammonium limitation can be a major reason for absence of detectable AOB in soil.
