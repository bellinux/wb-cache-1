40|$|In {{a recent}} paper, we noticed that, in the {{s-channel}} scattering mediated by a graviton in the linearized Einstein theory, angular momentum {{seems not to}} be conserved in the graviton coupling to massive matter fields, due {{to the presence of}} a scalar component in the partial-wave expansion of the relevant amplitudes. The present Letter answers to some criticism by Han and Willenbrock, claiming that there is no problem in propagating a scalar component through a graviton exchange. We show explicitly that the partial-wave decomposition of the scattering <b>amplitude</b> <b>contrasts</b> with the rotation-group representations propagating through the graviton exchange in the considered processes. This phenomenon is crucially connected to the critical dependence of the trace of the graviton propagator on the "effective" dimension of the problem...|$|R

On the atomic scale propagating surface acoustic waves lead to oscillations of atoms on elliptical trajectories, with the axes being determined by the material parameters of the surface.

40|$|A {{method for}} 3 D {{tracking}} {{has been developed}} exploiting Digital Holography features in Microscopy (DHM). In the framework of self-consistent platform for manipulation and measurement of biological specimen we use DHM for quantitative and completely label free analysis of samples with low <b>amplitude</b> <b>contrast.</b> Tracking capability extend the potentiality of DHM allowing to monitor the motion of appropriate probes and correlate it with sample properties. Complete 3 D tracking has been obtained for the probes avoiding the amplitude refocusing in traditional tracking processes. Moreover, in biology and biomedical research fields {{one of the main}} topic is the understanding of morphology and mechanics of cells and microorganisms. Biological samples present low <b>amplitude</b> <b>contrast</b> that limits the information that can be retrieved through optical bright-field microscope measurements. The main effect on light propagating in such objects is in phase. This is known as phase-retardation or phase-shift. DHM is an innovative and alternative approach in microscopy, it's a good candidate for no-invasive and complete specimen analysis because its main characteristic is the possibility to discern between intensity and phase information performing quantitative mapping of the Optical Path Length. In this paper, the flexibility of DH is employed to analyze cell mechanics of unstained cells subjected to appropriate stimuli. DHM is used to measure all the parameters useful to understand the deformations induced by external and controlled stresses on in-vitro cells. Our configuration allows 3 D tracking of micro-particles and, simultaneously, furnish quantitative phase-contrast maps. Experimental results are presented and discussed for in vitro cells...|$|E

40|$|For a weak phase/weak {{amplitude}} object {{the information}} transfer in the imaging process of TEM {{is described by}} the common formalism of the contrast transfer function (CTF). So far the effects of inelastic scattering were not accounted for in this formalism. In conventional imaging they were simply neglected. In energy filtering TEM (EFTEM), where removal of inelastic electrons leads to higher specimen contrast, they were modelled by a global increase of the elastic <b>amplitude</b> <b>contrast.</b> Thus, the description of inelastic and elastic scattering was mixed. Here a new ansatz is proposed which treats elastic and inelastic contrast transfer separately by adding an inelastic contribution to the scattering potentials. In EFTEM this {{has the effect of}} adding a filter contrast which depends on the characteristics of the inelastic scattering. For samples with dominant plasmon loss the additional filter contrast is restricted to low resolution. Because of its strong dependence {{on the nature of the}} inelastic scattering process, the filter contrast cannot in general be unified with the conventional elastic <b>amplitude</b> <b>contrast.</b> The modified CTF theory for EFTEM was tested experimentally on a variety of samples. Images of amorphous layers of copper, aluminium, and carbon films, as well as zero-loss images of proteins embedded in amorphous ice were evaluated.

40|$|Amblyopia is a neurodevelopmental {{disorder}} of vision {{that occurs when}} the visual cortex receives decorrelated inputs from the two eyes during an early critical period of development. Amblyopic eyes are subject to suppression from the fellow eye, generate weaker visual evoked potentials (VEPs) than fellow eyes and have multiple visual deficits including impairments in visual acuity and contrast sensitivity. Primate models and human psychophysics indicate that stronger suppression is associated with greater deficits in amblyopic eye contrast sensitivity and visual acuity. We tested whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the visual cortex would modulate VEP <b>amplitude</b> and <b>contrast</b> sensitivity in adults with amblyopia. tDCS can transiently alter cortical excitability and may influence suppressive neural interactions. Twenty-one patients with amblyopia and twenty-seven controls completed separate sessions of anodal (a-), cathodal (c-) and sham (s-) visual cortex tDCS. A-tDCS transiently and significantly increased VEP amplitudes for amblyopic, fellow and control eyes and contrast sensitivity for amblyopic and control eyes.

Numerical investigations show that the statistical properties of a cloud of bubbles: mean refractive index, mean and standard deviation of the size distribution, have a strong influence on the global angular position, the angular spreading and the <b>amplitude</b> <b>contrast</b> of the near-critical-scattering pattern respectively.
