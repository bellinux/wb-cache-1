5|$|Tropical Cyclone Emma was a weak but {{unusually large}} {{tropical}} cyclone that affected <b>a</b> <b>substantial</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> Western Australia during the 2005–06 Australian region cyclone season. Forming {{out of an}} {{area of low pressure}} on 25 February, the precursor to Emma slowly tracked southward. Although classified tropical, the structure of the system represented that of a monsoonal storm. However, low wind shear and well-developed outflow gradually allowed convection to develop near the centre of circulation. As the system approached the Pilbara coastline of Western Australia on 27 February, it intensified into a Category 1 cyclone and attained peak 10-minute sustained winds of 75km/h (45mph). After moving inland near Mardie, Emma weakened to a tropical low but became exceedingly large; its cloud cover obscured most of Western Australia. The remnants of the weak storm persisted until 1 March, at which time they dissipated over the Great Australian Bight.|$|E

By 1924 the business had annual revenues of $100,000 ($1.36 million in 2013 dollars) and a staff of 100 employees. John Fluor delegated most of the company's operations to his sons, Peter and Simon Fluor. A $100,000 capital investment was made that year and it was incorporated. John's eldest son Peter served as head of sales and grew the company to $1.5 million ($20.4 million in 2013 dollars) in revenues by 1929. In 1929 the company re-incorporated as Fluor Corporation.

5|$|The Ottoman Empire {{demanded a}} total {{liquidation}} of the Cossack power.

This solution was being rejected by the magnates and szlachta for political, economic and cultural reasons when there was still time for reform, before disasters struck. The Polish–Lithuanian establishment had instead shifted unsteadily between compromising with the Cossacks, allowing limited varying numbers, the so-called Cossack register (500 in 1582, 8000 in the 1630s), to serve with the Commonwealth army (the rest were to be converted into serfdom, to help the magnates in colonizing the Dnieper area), and brutally using military force {{in an attempt to}} subdue them.|$|E

In August 1896, Britain and Zanzibar fought a 38-minute war, the shortest in recorded history, after Khalid bin Barghash had taken power after Hamid bin Thuwaini's death. The British had wanted Hamoud bin Mohammed to become Sultan, believing that he would be much easier to work with. The British gave Khalid an hour to vacate the Sultan's palace in Stone Town. Khalid failed to do so, and instead assembled an army of 2,800 men to fight the British. The British launched an attack on the palace and other locations around the city. Khalid retreated and later went into exile. Hamoud was then installed as Sultan.|$|E

Increasingly, the differential treatment of transitional economies under the WTO regime is causing both generalized conflict and specific WTO disputes. This article argues that designations such as ‘transitional economy’ and ‘non-market economy’ are flawed in the binary approach that they establish in relation to the notion of the market. While they serve useful political objectives for some WTO members, they are unsatisfactory from a legal and theoretical perspective. In the longer term, this is an untenable position and one that should be reconsidered for the sake of transparency within the WTO framework.
