40|$|Bacteria {{from the}} genus Acidithiobacillus are often {{associated}} with biominingand acid mine drainage. Biomining utilises acidophilic, sulphur and ironoxidising microorganisms for recovery of metals from sulphidic low grade oresand concentrates. Acid mine drainage results in acidification and contaminationwith metals of soil and water emanating from the dissolution of metal sulphidesfrom deposits and mine waste storage. Acidophilic microorganisms play acentral role in these processes by catalysing aerobic oxidation of sulphides. Acceleration of mineral solubilisation is a positive aspect in biomining whereas,in acid mine drainage it is undesirable and accordingly, microbial iron andsulphur oxidation is promoted {{in the first case}} and measures are taken to inhibitit in the second case. In this thesis, several approaches were taken in order tounderstand and increase oxidation efficiency in biomining and to gain an insightinto the biochemical reactions taking place in these environments. A laboratoryscale bioreactor was designed and tested allowing simulation of bioleaching inheaps of mine tailings at different <b>aeration,</b> <b>irrigation</b> and particle size conditions(Paper I). A new psychrotolerant strain of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans wascharacterised that has an application in boreal heap bioleaching. Iron, reducedinorganic sulphur compound oxidation and bioleaching of various ores by thisstrain was studied as well as gene expression during oxidation of tetrathionateand/or ferrous iron (Papers III & IV). Expression and regulation of atetrathionate hydrolase from Acidithiobacillus caldus, a key enzyme in reducedinorganic sulphur compound metabolism of this bacterium was investigated andthe presence of this enzyme in a bioleaching mixed culture was shown. The genecluster that harbours the gene coding for tetrathionate hydrolase (tetH) wasdescribed for the first time (Paper II) ...|$|E

40|$|Soil {{aeration}} {{is one of}} {{the critical}} determinants of plant production. This research investigated the potential of oxygation, the aeration of subsurface drip irrigation (SDI), to alleviate the consequences of episodic flooding associated with SDI in vertisols (the predominant soil type in cotton production) with a view to achieve improved yields and water use efficiencies. Cotton performance, as affected by <b>aeration</b> and <b>irrigation</b> application rate, was evaluated over two consecutive seasons, with a particular focus on root characteristics and physiological processes. Aerated cotton (2005 results) significantly outperformed non-aerated cotton in terms of both yield (27 % more lint) and crop water use efficiency (26 % more lint per megalitre water used). The more extensive root development of aerated plants suggests that the temporal hypoxic/anoxic events associated with SDI in clay soils is indeed mitigated by <b>aeration</b> of the <b>irrigation</b> water. Data from the 2006 experiment (recently harvested) are not included in this paper...|$|R

40|$|Subsurface drip {{irrigation}} (SDI) {{is known as}} one of the most effective irrigation methods capable of improving water use efficiency through providing small amounts of water at short irrigation intervals and causing little or no water loss in terms of deep percolation, runoff and soil evaporation. However, temporal waterlogging within the root zone during and after irrigation events adversely affects root respiration, water and nutrient uptake and consequently plant growth. Therefore, irrigation of plants with hyper-aerated, or oxygenated, water could alleviate the impacts of waterlogging in the rhizosphere. Recent studies reportedly showed that <b>aeration</b> of <b>irrigation</b> water by means of venturi air injector in SDI systems (known as oxygation) enhanced crop performance in hypoxic soils. However, there was evidence of non-uniform improvement in crop yield along lateral pipes which might be ascribed to non-uniform distribution of air flow along irrigation pipes. Moreover, under pipe inclinations ranging from 5 º to 15 º, preferential flow of air was reportedly observed in branching pipe systems (containing no emitters) for ratio of water to air flow in the range of 0. 1 – 0. 3. In the current study, preliminary investigation on preferential flow of air into branching horizontal pipe layouts suggested that delivery of air bubbles from the first emitter on the lateral pipe closest to the junction of main pipe and manifold might have formed a zone of relative low pressure. It was speculated that the low pressure zone was responsible for occurrence of preferential air flow in the branching pipe systems...|$|R
40|$|Climatic variability, {{typified by}} erratic heavy-rainfall events, causes {{waterlogging}} in intensively irrigated crops and is exacerbated under warm temperature regimes on soils with poor internal drainage. Irrigated cotton is often grown in precisely these conditions, exposing it to waterlogging-induced yield losses after substantial summer rainfall. This {{calls for a}} deeper understanding of mechanisms of waterlogging tolerance and its relevance to cotton. Hence this review suggests possible causes of waterlogging-induced yield loss in cotton and approaches to improvement of waterlogging tolerance, drawing upon the slight body of published data in cotton and principles from other species. The yield penalty depends on soil type, phenological stage and cumulative period of root exposure to air-filled porosities below 10 %. Events in the soil include O 2 deficiency in the root zone that changes the redox state of nutrients, making them unavailable (e. g. nitrogen) or potentially toxic for plants. Furthermore, root-derived hormones that are transported in the xylem have long been associated with oxygen deficits. These belowground effects (impaired root growth, nutrient uptake and transport, hormonal signalling) affect the shoots, interfering with canopy development, photosynthesis and radiation-use efficiency. Compared with the more waterlogging-tolerant cereals, cotton does not have identified adaptations to waterlogging in the root zone, forming no conspicuous root aerenchyma and having low fermentative activity. We speculate that these factors contribute substantially to the sensitivity of cotton to sustained periods of waterlogging. We discuss the impact of these belowground factors on shoot performance, photosynthesis and yield components. Management practices, i. e. soil <b>aeration,</b> scheduling <b>irrigation</b> and fertilizer application, can reduce waterlogging-induced damage. Limiting ethylene biosynthesis using anti-ethylene agents and down-regulating expression of genes controlling ethylene biosynthesis are strong candidates to minimize yield losses in waterlogged cotton crops. Other key pathways of anoxia tolerance are also cited as potential tools towards waterlogging-tolerant cotton genotypes. 17 page(s...|$|R
40|$|To achieve {{self-sufficiency}} in rice once {{a surplus}} of 10 million tons in 2014, one way could be reached by the application of technology. This review describes the rice cultivation technologies that have been and are being developed in West Sumatra by different institutions. Integrated Crop Management (ICM) is a technology recommendation of the Ministry of Agriculture. ICM in West Sumatra began in 2001. ICM technology is the integration of technological components, such as: young seedlings, seed quality, planting less than 3 plants per hill, new high yielding varieties, improved soil <b>aeration</b> with intermittent <b>irrigation,</b> the use of organic fertilizer, site-specific nutrient management through fertilizer N efficiency use LCC, {{as well as the}} use of P and K fertilizers based on soil nutrient status. Rice result achievement by ICM technology of various locations in West Sumatra is 5. 30 to 7. 25 t/ha. ICM has been implemented in the form of ICM-Field School in accelerating the deployment of technological innovation. SRI (The System of Rice Intensification) technology in pioneered by the Faculty of Agriculture, Andalas University since 2004. Four main components in the SRI are: the use of young seedlings, one seedling per planting point, plant spacing rare, and no stagnant water throughout the season. Increased productivity by SRI technolgy is mainly due to the increased number of productive tillers significantly, ie 40 - 80 plants per hill. Rice productivity achieved about 7. 8 t/ha versus conventional farming productivity about 4. 5 t/ha. Padi Tanam Sabatang/PTS (One-stem Planting Rice), is a rice-planting movement are programmed by the Agricultural Service of West Sumatra Province with District/City Agricultural Service all of West Sumatra. PTS that recommended since 2006 is actually a modification of the SRI technology. Component technologies that are emphasized include: the use of organic fertilizer, planting young seedlings one plant per hill, plant spacing of 30 x 30 cm or more, and the setting limited puddle during growth. Result achievement of rice with PTS technology about 7. 0 t/ha. PTS has been applied to the level of Farmers Group or farmers through PTS-Field School.

40|$|Increasing {{competition}} on supply {{of fresh water}} for irrigation by agricultural, domestic, sports and industrial users demands water use efficient irrigation methods and compliance with environmental regulations. Drip irrigation (DI) and subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) are advocated for improvements in water use efficiency (WUE) and are increasingly being adopted by horticultural industries in Australia and overseas. Greater flexibility for automation and versatility of application of drip irrigation technology encourage wider-scale adoption by these industries. However, the higher initial investment for installation and lack of significant yield gains due to drip irrigation compared to conventional irrigation methods are somehow deterrents for broad-scale adoption. Ways to optimise the use of DI and SDI will have multiplier effects on water savings for irrigation in agricultural and other industries and minimize environmental impacts associated with traditional irrigation methods. One of the significant areas where greater optimization of DI and SDI is realized is {{through the use of}} aerated water for irrigation (oxygation). Sustained wetting fronts around emitters associated with DI/SSDI impose hypoxia in the rhizosphere. This impedes root respiration leading to sub-optimal plant performance. As irrigation water exits an emitter, it purges soil pores of soil air (containing up to 20 % by volume of oxygen) with water that contains less than 10 ppm oxygen, a quantity we have shown is used up quickly by roots and soil microbes. Rising soil temperatures, salinity, and soil compaction will exacerbate this effect, as may disease such as Phytophthora of pineapple. Plant roots and soil microbes require oxygen for respiration. In soils with inadequate aeration the lack of oxygen results in reduced plant growth and diminished productivity for many reasons, including: reduced root growth and root size; reduced root ability to absorb minerals and water; reduced photosynthesis and plant growth due to stomatal closure; loss of soil N due to the in-activity of microbes; adverse changes in soil chemistry; increased susceptibility to disease, and an alteration of the balance and supply of plant growth regulators. <b>Aeration</b> of the <b>irrigation</b> stream, a process termed ‘oxygation’, overcomes this constraint. Oxygation is a new innovation in irrigation technologies. Aerated DI and SDI by different methods, such as venturi for air injection, allows for the simultaneous application of water, air and other agro-chemicals directly to the crop root zone. Therefore, it can potentially improve crop yield and water use efficiency. Conventional irrigation methods such as flood irrigation have large inefficiencies due to run-off, drainage and evaporative loss. SDI can significantly improve the WUE over that of flood irrigation, and oxygation can significantly improve WUE of SDI. Oxygation involves mixing air with water using a venturi and delivering via a surface or subsurface drip irrigation system. An oxygation system can be installed as part of a new SDI system or may be retrospectively fitted to any existing SDI system. A venturi air injector is installed within the pipeline and draws air directly into the water stream. A single venturi can be installed immediately after the pump outlet and the air distributed through the main line to sub mains and lateral drip lines, or a single injector may be fitted to the beginning of each drip line. The amount of air ingress depends on the pressure differential across the venturi and the motive flow through the venturi...|$|R
40|$|The {{socio-economic}} {{pressure for}} improvements in irrigation efficiencies is increasing due to intense competition for water between agricultural, domestic and industrial users {{as well as}} demands for compliance with environmental regulations. Precision irrigation technology involving less irrigation water and uniform application across the field is therefore important. In the context of declining water allocation for irrigation and the variations in weather and drought patterns attributed to global climate change, efficient and precise applications are necessity. Traditional irrigation methods such as furrow, flood and sprinkler are neither efficient nor environmentally benign. Precision irrigation methods such as drip and subsurface drip irrigation are advocated {{because they are more}} water use efficient and because they offer a possible approach to meet projected food demand, a doubling by the 2050. In spite of greater water use efficiency afforded by minimal soil surface evaporation and deep drainage, and ease of automation, wide scale adoption of surface and subsurface drip irrigation technology is limited. This is due to their high investment cost for installation. They often lack a significant yield benefit when compared to conventional irrigation practice. Reasons are probably linked to a sustained wetting front around emitters. These emitters impose a condition of low oxygen content in the root-dense rhizosphere surrounding emitters that impede root respiration, and negatively impact on plant uptake of water and nutrients, leading to constrained yield performance. Here we review aspects of soil oxygen dynamics during irrigation and present evidence for sustained hypoxia in the wetting fronts associated with drip and subsurface drip irrigation. This condition of low oxygen content in the rhizosphere conditioned by the drip irrigation we term as the irrigation paradox. At dissolved oxygen concentrations one half of that at saturation root respiration and function start to decline. The pros and cons of different approaches to maintain aeration of the crop root zone are reviewed and we suggest that the best approach to overcome hypoxia is through <b>aeration</b> of the <b>irrigation</b> water stream, a practice known as oxygation. This conclusion is based on the evidence derived from a number of controlled environment experiments and field trials on crops where consistent increases of 10 – 30 % in yield and water use efficiency were reported with aerated irrigation water. Aerated drip delivery of irrigation also allows for the simultaneous application of agro-chemicals directly into the crop root zone. We define this approach of delivering multiple agro-chemicals with aerated drip irrigation as multigation. Delivering nutrients and other chemicals with irrigation water according to the crop requirements reduces the cost ofapplication and improves input use efficiencies and becomes increasingly practical with adoption of automation using dosing equipment. The dynamics and fate of agrochemicals in the soil with aerated water irrigation differs from those of non-aerated water irrigation, e. g. oxygen provided greater salt exclusion by roots compared to non-aerated treatments. Opportunities also exists for improving the use of treated effluent water for irrigation with multigation as treated effluent water has high biological oxygen demand and often record poor dissolved oxygen concentration causing hypoxia upon crop irrigation. Review of previous research and modelling suggests that the behaviour of multiphase components in aerated irrigation water streams, and subsequently in the soil, and their interaction with plant roots influences the dynamics of salt, nutrients and pesticides and therefore provides opportunity for the sustainable management of these inputs for irrigated agriculture...|$|R
