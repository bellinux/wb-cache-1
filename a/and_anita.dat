5|$|In 1953, editor Hugh Hefner began {{publishing}} Playboy and {{the magazine}} became popular {{because of its}} early Playmates, such as Mansfield, Marilyn Monroe, Bettie Page, <b>and</b> <b>Anita</b> Ekberg.

This increased the magazine's circulation and helped launch Mansfield's career. Beginning in February 1955, she formed a long-standing relationship with Playboy. Shortly afterward, she posed for the Playboy calendar, covering her breasts with her hands. Playboy featured Mansfield every February from 1955 to 1958, and again in 1960.|$|E

The Berliawskys had to stay behind, as Isaac, the youngest brother, had to care for his parents. While still in Europe, Minna gave birth to two of Nevelson's siblings: Nathan (born 1898) <b>and</b> <b>Anita</b> (1902). On his mother's death, Isaac moved to the United States in 1902.

5|$|On October 9, one {{day prior}} to Nicole forming, the Bermuda Weather Service issued a gale warning for the island. The agency also issued a Tropical Storm Watch {{shortly after the}} storm developed. All {{warnings}} were canceled after the storm passed the island. Winds on Bermuda peaked at 44mph (71km/h) in association with Nicole, while gusts peaked at 60mph (97km/h) prior to the storm developing. Nicole and the precursor extratropical storm dropped heavy precipitation, amounting to 5.86inches (148mm) over a three-day period at the Bermuda International Airport. Thunderstorms were also reported on the island. Poor weather conditions from Nicole forced the cancellation of several events at the tourist-driven Bermuda Music Festival, including acts by Isaac Hayes, Gerald Albright, <b>and</b> <b>Anita</b> Baker. Strong winds knocked down power lines, leaving over 1,800 homes and businesses without power. Unsettled conditions also resulted in airport delays. High winds delayed or altered the courses of four cruise ships. High waves of 10 to 12-foot (3 to 3.6 m) in height left several cruise ship passengers seasick; one sick person was rushed to a local hospital on Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|Ark Royal was recommissioned in 1930 {{to serve}} as a {{training}} ship, for seaplane pilots and to evaluate aircraft catapult operations and techniques. She was renamed HMS Pegasus in 1934, freeing the name for the aircraft carrier ordered that year, and continued {{to serve as}} a training ship until the beginning of the Second World War in September 1939. Assigned to the Home Fleet {{at the beginning of the}} war, she took on tasks as an aircraft transport, in addition to her training duties, until she was modified to serve as the prototype fighter catapult ship in late 1940. This type of ship was intended to defend convoys against attacks by German long-range maritime patrol bombers by launching fighters via their catapult to provide air cover for the convoy. Pegasus served in this role until mid-1941 when she reverted to her previous duties as a training ship. This lasted until early 1944 when she became a barracks ship. The ship was sold in late 1946 and her conversion into a merchant ship began the following year. However, the owner ran out of money during the process <b>and</b> <b>Anita</b> I, as she had been renamed, was seized by her creditors in 1949 and sold for scrap. She was not broken up until late 1950.|$|E
