500|$|Balzac mined his {{own life}} for details in the first parts of La Peau de Chagrin, and he likely modeled the protagonist Raphaël de Valentin on himself. Details recounted by Valentin of his impoverished living {{quarters}} are autobiographical allusions to Balzac's earliest days as an author: [...] "Nothing could be uglier than this garret, awaiting its scholar, with its dingy yellow walls and odor of poverty. The roofing fell in a steep slope, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>was</b> visible through chinks in the tiles. There was room for a bed, a table, and a few chairs, and beneath the highest point of the roof my piano could stand." [...] Although they allow for a degree of embellishment, biographers and critics agree that Balzac was drawing from his own experience.|$|E
500|$|During filming, David Duchovny {{decided to}} act out the reunion scene in a manner {{contrary}} to what the script called for. Manners later noted, [...] "In the script, it called for his sister to run up and hug him, and Mulder was to start crying. David didn't want to cry. I said, 'David, you're finally realizing your sister is, in fact, dead. [...] He said, 'Just watch what I do; trust me.' And, he held that little girl actress—there was a beatific {{smile on his face}} that was absolutely astounding." [...] Manners was very happy with the change and included it in the final cut of the episode. To create the scene featuring the ghosts of the dead children interacting with the characters, various layers of film had to be overlaid onto each other. Many passes of the shot were taken, which took hours to complete. After the shots had been secured, the film of the ghosts had to be made transparent. The scenes wherein Mulder is interacting with the walk-ins was actually shot in daylight. However, specialized [...] "day for night" [...] photography was used to make the finished scene look {{as if it had been}} filmed at night. To achieve this, the subjects were illuminated with bright lights <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>was</b> completely avoided. The entire scene was shot at 48 frames a second, twice that of normal speed. Rebecca Toolan was flown down from Vancouver specifically for this episode, and [...] "Sein Und Zeit". To create her ghostly apparition, the production staff had to shoot multiple frames, which were then spliced into footage of Duchovny. Manners played the part of the hypnotist in the video which Scully watches of Mulder under hypnosis. Manners later noted that [...] "I only act when you can't actually see my face". Manners was critical of Duchovny's wig—which had been added to make the footage seem older. He sardonically noted that [...] "this is [...] one of the episodes that Cheri Medcalf [...] won an Emmy for." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{begins with}} a gentle piano-and-glockenspiel {{instrumental}} before segueing into [...] "Lawn of Dawns", which introduces Nico's harmonium [...] "of undulating motion weaving against her voice". The song is engulfed in [...] "weird clattering and tintinnabulating", while a [...] "dark twangy guitar... stumbles to a subdued halt in [...] final seconds". It features what may be Nico's first lyrics, inspired by her peyote visions with Jim Morrison: [...] "He blesses you, he blesses me/The day the night caresses,/Caresses you, caresses me,/Can you follow me?/I cannot understand the way I feel/Until I rest on lawns of dawns—/Can you follow me?" [...] Nico explained the peyote-induced experience which inspired the lyrics: [...] "The light of the dawn was a very deep green and I believed I was upside down <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>was</b> the desert which had become a garden and then the ocean. I do not swim and I was frightened when it was water and more resolved when it was land. I felt embraced by the sky-garden." [...] The lyrics of the next song, [...] "No One Is There", {{have been described as}} [...] "in all probability influenced by Jim Morrison" [...] ("Some are calling/Some are sad/Some are calling mad") and are sung over Cale's classical quartet of violas darting in and out of her unusual vocal tempo. [...] "Ari's Song" [...] was dedicated to Nico's young son, Christian Aaron [...] "Ari" [...] Boulogne, her only child with French actor Alain Delon, and has been called [...] "the least-comforting lullaby ever recorded". It begins with the harmonium's clipped, whistling tones as she sings softly, [...] "Sail away/Sail away my little boy". [...] "Facing the Wind" [...] is supported by [...] "Cale-banged piano clusters, scraping of percussion or walls and off-beat tympani"; Nico's voice sounds filtered (possibly through a Leslie speaker), with the [...] "somnambulistic toiling" [...] of her pipe organ accompanied by viola and strident piano.|$|E

2500|$|The {{aircraft}} was a modified Stinson Model A registered VH-UYY {{and operated by}} Australian National Airways (ANA) as the Tokana. On 31 January 1945 the Tokana departed from Melbourne's Essendon Airport at 7:55 am local time for a flight to Broken Hill, stopping at Kerang and Mildura. On board were two pilots and eight passengers.

Hale also participated in time-to-height and acceleration trials against Lockheed F-104 Starfighters from Aalborg. He reports that the Lightnings won all races easily {{with the exception of}} the low-level supersonic acceleration, which was a [...] "dead heat".

2500|$|With Geoff Pullar {{unable to}} play Colin Cowdrey opened for England again, a role {{he did not}} relish and after making two runs he was out, mis-hitting a ball from Alan Davidson to Neil Harvey at {{backward}} short-leg, who darted forward to take it at grass height. David Sheppard became Neil Hawke's first Test wicket, catching a full blooded cover drive off his own bowling. This made England 39/2 after 108 minutes and with Ken Barrington entrenched at one end the crowd were looked to Ted Dexter to produce some excitement. The wicket was dead <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>was</b> clear, {{so there was no}} chance of the ball swinging and the famous Sydney Hill was becoming restless, Barrington raising his cap when he was jeered and a slow hand clap started around the ground as Dexter played himself in. This was briefly curtailed when Barrington glanced a full toss from Garth McKenzie for four and Dexter hit three fours off Bobby Simpson. Norm O'Neill caught Barrington on the pads and appealed, but no else joined in and the Englishman stayed put. Australia were running through 14-15 overs an hour, the fastest so far in the series, but with such defensive play the effort was wasted. Dexter was out after lunch edging O'Neill (1/38) to Simpson at first slip for 47 and Tom Graveney almost went the same way to Benaud. At 5:15 pm the batsmen appealed for light, but were turned down and five minutes later he glanced McKenzie (1/57) off his legs, but [...] "Harvey, anticipating, shot out his left hand; he somersaulted and momentarily stood on his head, then he rolled over and sat up, still clutching the ball." [...] Barrington usually woke up when his century was in sight, and a sweep of Simpson was dropped by Brian Booth, but a drive found its way to the boundary and a single brought up his hundred and a surprisingly generous round of applause from the stadium. He drove Benaud straight to Harvey in the covers, who bruised a finger taking his third catch, out for 101 after 320 minutes. Ray Illingworth and Fred Titmus lasted until stumps, with England 195/5 after a full day's play. The second day continued in the same dull way, or perhaps worse as only three boundaries were hit between the two sides. Illingworth (27) and Titmus (34) produced, long, slow innings occasionally interrupted by drizzle before they were both caught by Wally Grout, one off Davidson and the other off Hawke (2/57). Even Fred Trueman played a subdued innings before he was caught by Harvey off Benaud for 30. Alan Smith was bowled by Simpson (1/51) and David Allen and Brian Statham finally livened things up with a last wicket stand of 28 in 35 minutes until Benaud caught Allen off Davidson (3/43). England's 321 had taken them nine and a half hours, an innings more akin to saving a lost cause than trying to win a match.|$|E
