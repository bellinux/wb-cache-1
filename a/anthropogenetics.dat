The citation of this Trieste-based TWAS Award noted not only his [...] "outstanding contributions to haemoglobinopathy" [...] but also his [...] "first description of some 5 new physical signs in Clinical Medicine, invention of the 'Male Procreative Superiority Index' (MPSI) which {{shed some light on}} aspects of African <b>Anthropogenetics,</b> and for his insistence on an ethical dimension to genetic programmes, and highlighting public health measures as the best tool for long-term sickle-cell patient management." ...|$|E
50|$|He {{was awarded}} several medals and fellowships during his {{lifetime}} {{and was a member}} of several professional bodies. He was awarded the Fellowship of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland. He was appointed as the Assistant Curator of the Archaeology section of the Indian Museum. He was the Honorary Magistrate of Kolkata from 1922 to 1924 and later served as a councillor in the Municipal corporation of the city till 1927. He presided over the Anthropology proceedings in the Indian Science Congress in 1933 and the <b>anthropogenetics</b> sessions of the Indian Population Congress, Lucknow in 1936. He was also an associate member at the American Museum of Natural History. The Asiatic Society awards an annual ‘Panchanan Mitra Memorial Lectureship’ for outstanding contributions to the field of anthropology in his name.|$|E
40|$|The adult man in Africa, {{unlike the}} average European man, {{can have a}} {{biological}} fitness exceeding that of this wife. Sociocultural factors allow, and indeed encourage, this state of affairs, which may have far-reaching genetic consequences. The male procreative superiority index (MPSI) of any man is easily worked out by dividing {{the total number of}} a man's children by the average number of children born to each wife. The country-wide mean MPSI for 3095 fathers contacted throughout Ghana was 2. 03, indicating that the Ghanaian father on the average has twice as many children as the mother. The genetic consequences of this phenomenon are discussed, bringing out effects on such diverse genes as those for abnormal haemoglobins, twins, and extra digits. African <b>anthropogenetics</b> needs rethinking more on factual lines than on theoretical evolutionary concepts...|$|E
40|$|The {{life and}} work in the field of {{clinical}} genetics {{of one of the most}} outstanding Dutch pediatricians of the first half of the twentieth century, Cornelia C. de Lange (1871 - 1950), is described against the background of the development of pediatrics, <b>anthropogenetics,</b> and clinical genetics in the Netherlands. Cornelia de Lange specialized in and worked on all aspects of the broad field of pediatrics. During her 50 years of practice she collected an immense series of observations on pediatric disorders. As theories on human genetics developed during the 1920 s and 1930 s, her interest in congential disorders and heredity increased as she saw the implications for the pediatric clinic. She benefitted from her vast experience and her knowledge of the national and international literature when she recognised and described new entities, one of which is named after her: the Brachmann-De Lange syndrom...|$|E
40|$|We call ‘languaging’ (Fell and Russell, 1994) the complex-ecological, dynamic core-interaction of {{multiple}} semiotic resources to embody (Streeck, Goodwin and LeBaron, 2011) meaning in communication. We discuss the physiological emergence of intentionality and consciousness through bio-semiotic markers {{of meaning in}} the form of facial kinetics (Birdwhistell, 1970), with a specific focus on eyebrow movements. We adopt a discursive-interactional approach to a set of ‘semi-interactional’ data, in order to investigate semantic, syntactic and pragmatic aspects of self-organization, bio-communication and <b>anthropogenetics.</b> A series of thirty-six short, -quasi-monologic- interviews (1. 30 minutes each on average) was run on a mixed group of multilingual speakers at University of Luxembourg. Four sets can here be distinguished: twenty participants with different L 1 s spoke either English or French as L 2 (ten and ten respectively). Eight English L 1 speakers and eight French L 1 speakers spoke English as L 1 and French as L 1 respectively. Data analysis reveals that, regardless of whether speakers use their L 1 or an L 2, there is consistency and systematics across languages, as for the placement of eyebrow movements on self-repair (Schegloff, 1977), material following hesitation and discourse markers (Schiffrin, 1986). In line with biogenetic structuralism (Laughlin and d'Aquili 1974), these results suggest that, although each living organism develops own ‘cognized’ Umwelt (von Uexkull, 1973), there are universal operational structures characterizing human language (Wierzbicka, 1992), and cognition. Aspects in the sequential organization of talk (Sacks, Schegloff, Jefferson) and linguistic-kinesic interdependence (Birdwhistell, 1970) may result from complex socio-genetic evolution of interactants’ nervous systems...|$|E
40|$|Apolipoprotein D (APO D) is a {{constituent}} of plasma high-density lipoproteins. Its precise role in lipid metabolism {{is not well}} established, {{though it may be}} involved in cholesterol esterification and cholester ester transport to the liver for catabolism. No genetic polymorphism has been reported in the APO D gene product. To investigate the extent of genetic variation at the APO D structural locus, we have developed an isoelectric focusing-immunoblotting technique and have screened a large number of plasma samples from U. S. whites, U. S. blacks, Nigerian blacks, the Aleuts of the Pribilof Islands, Eskimo groups from Kodiak Island and St. Lawrence Island, and Amerindian populations from Mexico and Canada. Except for the U. S. blacks and Nigerian blacks, the APO D locus is monomorphic in all other population groups tested. In populations with black ancestry, the products of two alleles, APO D* 1 and APO D* 2, have been observed at respective allele frequencies. 987 and. 013 in U. S. blacks and. 978 and. 022 in Nigerian blacks. The detection of a unique protein polymorphism in blacks makes APO D a useful black marker of significance in <b>anthropogenetics</b> and racial admixture studies. In addition to the interindividual variation observed, APO D reveals extensive intraindividual molecular variation with a multiple banding pattern. The basis of this molecular variation is explained, in part, by variation in the number of terminal sialic acid residues. We have investigated the effect of the APO D polymorphism on triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL-, VLDL-, HDL-, and HDL 3 cholesterol in 352 Nigerian blacks (190 males and 162 females).

40|$|The {{ethical aspects}} {{of the use of}} stored tissue samples {{collected}} from minors are of topical interest. However, the views of professionals working in the field of genetics have not been investigated in depth anywhere. We conducted a survey among 194 such professionals in Belgium. This list was composed {{of the members of the}} High Council for <b>Anthropogenetics,</b> supplemented with all professionals working in the field of genetics that we found on the websites of the eight Belgian centers of human genetics and of the associated university registries. We achieved a response rate of 35. 5 %. The vast majority (92 %) think that research on stored tissue samples is useful. Most respondents stated that parental consent is valid (82. 5 %), and 76. 5 % thought that children should also be given the right to assent when they are able to comprehend the implications of the storage of biological samples and of genetic research. Slightly more than half put the age at which young people can understand storage or research rather high: 16 - 18 years (51 and 53. 1 %, respectively). Although there is some consensus in the literature that donors should be allowed to give broad consent for future research on their biological samples, only 47. 6 % in our survey thought that parents should be allowed to consent to any future research on their children’s samples. The aim of our study was to give some basis for future ethical reflections and policies on the subject of stored tissue samples from minors for genetic research. We concluded that a large majority of Belgian researchers and clinicians in the field of genetic research think research on stored tissue samples from minors is useful. They also think that parental consent for such research is valid, but that children should be allowed to assent as they grow older. status: publishe...|$|E
