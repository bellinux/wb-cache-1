40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE - The {{widespread}} {{preference of}} anticoagulants over <b>antiplatelets</b> {{in patients with}} cervical artery dissection (CAD) is empirical rather than evidence-based. SUMMARY OF REVIEW - This article summarizes pathophysiological considerations, clinical experiences, and {{the findings of a}} systematic metaanalysis about antithrombotic agents in CAD patients. As a result, there are several putative arguments in favor as well as against immediate anticoagulation in CAD patients. CONCLUSIONS - A randomized controlled trial comparing <b>antiplatelets</b> with anticoagulation is needed and ethically justified. However, attributable to the large sample size which is required to gather meaningful results, such a trial represents a huge venture. This comprehensive overview may be helpful for the design and the promotion of such a trial. In addition, it could be used to encourage both participation of centers and randomization of CAD patients. Alternatively, antithrombotic treatment decisions can be customized based on clinical and paraclinical characteristics of individual CAD patients. Stroke severity with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score ≥ 15, accompanying intracranial dissection, local compression syndromes without ischemic events, or concomitant diseases with increased bleeding risk are features in which <b>antiplatelets</b> seem preferable. In turn, in CAD patients with (pseudo) occlusion of the dissected artery, high intensity transient signals in transcranial ultrasound studies despite (dual) <b>antiplatelets,</b> multiple ischemic events in the same circulation, or with free-floating thrombus immediate anticoagulation is favored. © 2007 American Heart Association, Inc.

5|$|Treatment {{is focused}} on {{reducing}} stroke episodes and damage from a distending artery. Four treatment modalities {{have been reported in}} the treatment of vertebral artery dissection. The two main treatments involve medication: anticoagulation (using heparin and warfarin) and <b>antiplatelet</b> drugs (usually aspirin). More rarely, thrombolysis (medication that dissolves blood clots) may be administered, and occasionally obstruction may be treated with angioplasty and stenting. No randomized controlled trials have been performed to compare the different treatment modalities. Surgery is only used in exceptional cases.|$|E
5|$|After {{percutaneous}} coronary interventions (PCIs), such as {{the placement}} of a coronary artery stent, a U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality guideline recommends that aspirin be taken indefinitely. Frequently, aspirin is combined with an ADP receptor inhibitor, such as clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor to prevent blood clots. This is called dual <b>antiplatelet</b> therapy (DAPT). United States and European Union guidelines disagree somewhat about how long, and for what indications this combined therapy should be continued after surgery. U.S. guidelines recommend DAPT for at least 12 months, while EU guidelines recommend DAPT for 6–12 months after a drug-eluting stent placement. However, they agree that aspirin be continued indefinitely after DAPT is complete.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{is known}} to {{interact}} with other drugs. For example, acetazolamide and ammonium chloride are known to enhance the intoxicating effect of salicylates, and alcohol also increases the gastrointestinal bleeding associated with these types of drugs. Aspirin {{is known to}} displace a number of drugs from protein-binding sites in the blood, including the antidiabetic drugs tolbutamide and chlorpropamide, warfarin, methotrexate, phenytoin, probenecid, valproic acid (as well as interfering with beta oxidation, {{an important part of}} valproate metabolism), and other NSAIDs. Corticosteroids may also reduce the concentration of aspirin. Ibuprofen can negate the <b>antiplatelet</b> effect of aspirin used for cardioprotection and stroke prevention. The pharmacological activity of spironolactone may be reduced by taking aspirin, and it is known to compete with penicillin G for renal tubular secretion. Aspirin may also inhibit the absorption of vitamin C.|$|E
40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) is {{the most}} common cardiac arrhythmia, occurring in 1 - 2 % of overall population, involving more than 6 millions of European people. It is associated to a reduced quality of life and an increased morbidity and mortality. The Framingham study showed the link between angina and AF. The same risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity promote both AF and coronary artery disease (CAD). About 1 / 4 of AF patients develop a CAD and, in this setting, about 1 / 5 undergoes a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In patients with both AF and CAD, the optimal medical strategy is challenging and it is still debated in cardiological community, since patients treated by dual (two <b>antiplatelets</b> drugs ore one <b>antiplatelets</b> drug and an oral anticoagulant drug) or triple therapy (two <b>antiplatelets</b> drugs and an oral anticoagulant drug) are exposed to divergent risk of bleeding or thromboembolic and ischemic complications.

5|$|Warfarin is {{best suited}} for anticoagulation (clot {{formation}} inhibition) in areas of slowly running blood (such as in veins and the pooled blood behind artificial and natural valves) and in blood pooled in dysfunctional cardiac atria. Thus, common clinical indications for warfarin use are atrial fibrillation, the presence of artificial heart valves, deep venous thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism (where the embolized clots first form in veins). Warfarin is also used in antiphospholipid syndrome. It has been used occasionally after heart attacks (myocardial infarctions), but is far less effective at preventing new thromboses in coronary arteries. Prevention of clotting in arteries is usually undertaken with <b>antiplatelet</b> drugs, which act by a different mechanism from warfarin (which normally {{has no effect on}} platelet function).|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} risk scores exist to predict {{bleeding}} in people using warfarin and similar anticoagulants. A commonly used score (HAS-BLED) includes known predictors of warfarin-related bleeding: uncontrolled {{high blood pressure}} (H), abnormal kidney function (A), previous stroke (S), known previous bleeding condition (B), previous labile INR when on anticoagulation (L), elderly as defined by age over 65 (E), and drugs associated with bleeding (e.g. aspirin) or alcohol misuse (D). While their use is recommended in clinical practice guidelines, they are only moderately effective in predicting bleeding risk and do not perform well in predicting hemorrhagic stroke. Bleeding risk may be increased in people on hemodialysis. Another score used to assess bleeding risk on anticoagulation, specifically Warfarin or Coumadin, is the ATRIA score, which uses a weighted additive scale of clinical findings to determine bleeding risk stratification. The risks of bleeding are increased further when warfarin is combined with <b>antiplatelet</b> drugs such as clopidogrel, aspirin, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.|$|E
5|$|From {{analysis}} of the existing small treatment trials of cervical artery dissection (carotid and vertebral) it appears that aspirin and anticoagulation (heparin followed by warfarin) are equally effective in {{reducing the risk of}} further stroke or death. Anticoagulation is regarded as more powerful than <b>antiplatelet</b> therapy, but anticoagulants may increase the size of the hematoma and worsen obstruction of the affected artery. Anticoagulation may be relatively unsafe if a large stroke has already occurred, as hemorrhagic transformation is relatively common, and if the dissection extends into V4 (carrying a risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage). Anticoagulation may be appropriate if there is rapid blood flow (through a severely narrowed vessel) on transcranial doppler despite the use of aspirin, if there is a completely occluded vessel, if there are recurrent stroke-like episodes, or if free-floating blood clot is visible on scans. Warfarin is typically continued for 3–6 months, as during this time the flow through the artery usually improves, and most strokes happen within the first 6 months after the development of the dissection. Some regard 3 months as sufficient.|$|E
40|$|Intracranial {{atherosclerosis}} (ICAS) is a {{major cause}} ofstroke worldwide, especially in Asia. In patients with symptomatic ICAS, the risk of recurrent stroke is fairly high. 1 Although stenting/angioplasty is occasionally performed, a recent randomized trial failed to find the benefit of stenting in patients with symptomatic ICAS. 2 Moreover, trials using <b>antiplatelets</b> or anticoagulants have been rare, and results are confusing. Therefore, {{we still do not}} have well-proven, effective treatment strategies for ICAS.

40|$|Aims To study {{mortality}} rates among patients with diabetes and concomitant atrial fibrillation (AF), prescribed different cardiovascular drugs in primary health care. Methods Study population consisted of men (n = 1319) and women (n = 1094) aged = >= 45 years from a database including 75 primary care centres in Sweden. Cox regression analysis, with hazard ratios (HRs), 95 % confidence interval (95 % CIs) and mortality (years to death) as outcome, and Laplace regression, with difference {{in time to}} first 10 % mortality (with 95 % CI), were performed. Independent variables were prescribed cardiovascular drugs. Regression models were adjusted for a propensity score calculated separately for each prescribed drug class (comprising age, cardiovascular co-morbidities, education, marital status and pharmacotherapy). Results Overall mortality was lower in the whole sample for anticoagulants vs no treatment (HR 0. 45; 95 % CI 0. 26 - 0. 77); and among patients = 80 years, <b>antiplatelets</b> (HR 0. 47; 95 % CI 0. 26 - 0. 87) and anticoagulants (HR 0. 49; 95 % CI 0. 24 - 1. 00) vs. no treatment were equally effective.

5|$|The idea {{of using}} aspirin to prevent {{clotting}} diseases (such as heart attacks and strokes) was revived in the 1960s, when medical researcher Harvey Weiss found that aspirin had an anti-adhesive effect on blood platelets (and unlike other potential <b>antiplatelet</b> drugs, aspirin had low toxicity). Medical Research Council haematologist John O'Brien picked up on Weiss's finding and, in 1963, began working with epidemiologist Peter Elwood on aspirin's anti-thrombosis drug potential. Elwood began a large-scale trial of aspirin as a preventive drug for heart attacks. Nicholas Laboratories agreed to provide aspirin tablets, and Elwood enlisted heart attack survivors in a double-blind controlled study—heart attack survivors were statistically {{more likely to suffer}} a second attack, greatly reducing the number of patients necessary to reliably detect whether aspirin had an effect on heart attacks. The study began in February 1971, though the researchers soon had to break the double-blinding when a study by American epidemiologist Hershel Jick suggested that aspirin prevented heart attacks but suggested that the heart attacks were more deadly. Jick had found that fewer aspirin-takers were admitted to his hospital for heart attacks than non-aspirin-takers, and one possible explanation was that aspirin caused heart attack sufferers to die before reaching the hospital; Elwood's initial results ruled out that explanation. When the Elwood trial ended in 1973, it showed a modest but not statistically significant reduction in heart attacks among the group taking aspirin.|$|E
