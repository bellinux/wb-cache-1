5|$|The Japanese attack came in {{the night}} of 8/9 February, after a heavy {{artillery}} and aerial bombardment that had lasted throughout the day. 'D' Company, positioned in various locations {{in support of the}} Australian 22nd Brigade in the north-western area, found themselves {{in the thick of the}} fighting as the Japanese concentrated their landing on the Australian 8th Division front. Understrength <b>and</b> <b>stretched</b> <b>out</b> across a large frontage over ground that was unsuited to defence, the Australians were almost immediately under pressure. Shortly after 8:00pm, 13 Platoon, supporting the 2/20th Infantry Battalion around the head of the Lim Chu Kang Road, was confronted by a large number of landing barges filled with Japanese assault troops. For almost six hours, the platoon, under Lieutenant Eric Wankey, fought a desperate action to repel the invaders. With four machine guns, as well as personal small arms and grenades, the platoon inflicted heavy casualties on the Japanese and sank several barges. Despite heavy casualties from Japanese mortar and machine gun fire, they kept fighting until early in the morning on 9 February when, threatened with being outflanked and low on ammunition—each gun had fired over 10,000 rounds—and having had one gun knocked out, the platoon was forced to withdraw. Destroying their equipment as they went to prevent it from being captured, the platoon was forced to withdraw in contact, taking their wounded with them; the action was later rewarded with a Military Cross for the platoon commander, who was badly wounded after taking over one of the machine guns after its crew had been wounded.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of Germany, there also were 16 billion marks of debts from the 1920s which had {{defaulted}} in the 1930s, but which Germany decided to repay to restore its reputation. This money was owed to government and private banks in the US, France and Britain. Another 16 billion marks represented postwar loans by the US. Under the London Debts Agreement of 1953, the repayable amount was reduced by 50% to about 15 billion marks <b>and</b> <b>stretched</b> <b>out</b> over 30 years, and compared to the fast-growing German economy were of minor impact.|$|E
25|$|The {{hearing on}} Vallejos' case began on 22 August 2011, <b>and</b> <b>stretched</b> <b>out</b> until the 24th. David Pannick {{represented}} the respondent, the Commissioner of Registration. During the hearing, the courtroom was packed to overflowing with lawyers, journalists, {{and other members}} of the public, who took up not just the seats in the public gallery, but also those for defendants and jury members (the latter being unoccupied as the case at hand was not a jury trial but a judicial review). Another hundred people watched the proceedings on a large-screen television in the lobby, while protestors both supporting and opposing Vallejos' case faced off outside the building without incident.|$|E

25|$|Lucero was {{connected}} to the Mk. VIII transmitter, and triggered its own 5µs signal every fifth transmission of the radar. The IFF Mk. III in the remote aircraft contained a receiver circuit fed into a transmitter, causing any received signal to be amplified <b>and</b> <b>stretched</b> <b>out</b> in time. This signal was received by the responder side of Lucero, which mixed it in with the signal from the Mk. VIII's own receiver. Since the Lucero antenna was omni-directional, the returns were continuous around the entire face of the display and unrelated to the position of the main dish. The result was a series of line segments, spaced every 10 degrees around the display.|$|E
25|$|Daoxin {{eventually}} {{settled at}} East Mountain Temple on Shuangfeng ("Twin Peaks") where he taught Chan Buddhism {{for thirty years}} and attracted large numbers of practitioners, some records say five hundred laypeople and monks. In 643 the emperor Tai Zong invited Daoxin to the capital city but Daoxin refused to appear. Three times the emperor sent emissaries and three times Daoxin refused the invitation. The third time the emperor instructed to either bring back Daoxin or his head. When the emissary related this instruction to Daoxin, Daoxin exposed <b>and</b> <b>stretched</b> <b>out</b> his neck to allow the emissary to chop off his head. The envoy was so shocked he reported this event to the emperor, who then honored Daoxin as an exemplary Buddhist monk.|$|E
25|$|Just as I {{was pushing}} {{one of our}} men back into the ranks I saw him fall at my feet from a sabre slash. I turned round instantly– to see English cavalry forcing their way into our midst and hacking us to pieces. Just as it is difficult, if not impossible, for the best cavalry to break into {{infantry}} who are formed into squares and who defend themselves with coolness and daring, so {{it is true that}} once the ranks have been penetrated, then resistance is useless and nothing remains for the cavalry to do but to slaughter at almost no risk to themselves. This what happened, in vain our poor fellows stood up <b>and</b> <b>stretched</b> <b>out</b> their arms; they could not reach far enough to bayonet these cavalrymen mounted on powerful horses, and the few shots fired in chaotic melee were just as fatal to our own men as to the English. And so we found ourselves defenceless against a relentless enemy who, in the intoxication of battle, sabred even our drummers and fifers without mercy.|$|E

500|$|... "Girl Gone Wild" [...] is as a mid-tempo party track, drawing {{influence}} from four-on-the-floor {{and has a}} similar sound to tracks from the singer's tenth studio album, Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005). Kerri Mason of Billboard described it as mostly a dance track with more of electro influence in it rather than house. Jason Lipshutz from the same publication relegated it in the electropop genre, adding {{that it has a}} [...] "driving beat" [...] and [...] "propulsive hook" [...] reminiscent of Madonna's 2005 single, [...] "Hung Up". The song opens with a prayer, and Madonna uttering [...] "Oh my God, I'm heartily sorry", which was a spoken rendition of the last track, [...] "Act of Contrition", from Madonna's fourth studio album, Like a Prayer (1989). During the middle eight, Madonna talks about how [...] "good girls" [...] should not misbehave. NME contributor Ailbhe Malone noted that the composition featured elements from the singer's previous singles, [...] "Music" [...] (2000) and [...] "Jump" [...] (2006).

[...] "I Miss You" [...] begins with Beyoncé performing while seated, only to later be brought to her feet while altering the song's ending with additional vocals and instrumentation. [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] follows afterwards, with a slight alteration in its melody. Beyoncé then sang [...] "Party" [...] as the crowd swayed their arms back and forth <b>and</b> <b>stretched</b> <b>out</b> the [...] "y" [...] to every other verse.

500|$|At Fotheringhay on {{the evening}} of 7 February 1587, Mary was told that she was to be {{executed}} the next morning. She spent the last hours of her life in prayer, distributing her belongings to her household, and writing her will and a letter to the King of France. The scaffold that was erected in the Great Hall was two feet high and draped in black. It was reached by two or three steps and furnished with the block, a cushion for her to kneel on and three stools, for her and the earls of Shrewsbury and Kent, who were there to witness the execution. The executioners (one named Bull and his assistant) knelt before her and asked forgiveness, as it was typical for the executioner to ask the pardon of the one being put to death. She replied, [...] "I forgive you with all my heart, for now, I hope, you shall make an end of all my troubles." [...] Her servants, Jane Kennedy and Elizabeth Curle, and the executioners helped Mary to remove her outer garments, revealing a velvet petticoat and a pair of sleeves in crimson-brown, the liturgical colour of martyrdom in the Catholic Church, with a black satin bodice and black trimmings. As she disrobed she smiled and said that she [...] "never had such grooms before... nor ever put off her clothes before such a company". She was blindfolded by Kennedy with a white veil embroidered in gold, knelt down on the cushion in front of the block, on which she positioned her head, <b>and</b> <b>stretched</b> <b>out</b> her arms. Her last words were, [...] "In manus tuas, Domine, commendo spiritum meum" [...] ("Into thy hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit").|$|E
