40|$|A {{high bit}} rate {{acoustic}} link for underwater video transmission is examined. Currently, encoding standards support video transmission at bit rates as low as 64 kbps.

5000|$|A direct-connect {{version of}} the {{original}} 300 bit/s external modem was later released as the D-CAT. The [...] "D" [...] stood for [...] "direct": the modem was directly connected into the handset jack of the telephone instead of requiring acoustic coupling. To operate the D-CAT, a number was dialed on the telephone and the user waited for a carrier signal from the modem being called, just as with an <b>acoustic</b> <b>modem.</b> When a carrier signal was received, however, a button was pressed on the D-CAT which made it produce a carrier signal and establish a connection with the modem being called, then the handset would be left off-hook. A further improvement was the Auto-CAT, which allowed dialing the phone by entering the number when the modem was first started. Once the connection was made, the modem switched to [...] "data mode", {{and from then on}} had to be operated manually.|$|E
50|$|The Weitbrecht Modem {{inspired}} other {{engineers to}} develop other modems {{to work with}} 8-bit ASCII terminals at a faster rate. Such modems or couplers were developed around 1966 by John van Geen at the Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International), that mimicked handset operations. An early commercial model was built by Livermore Data Systems in 1968. One would dial the computer system (which would have telephone company datasets) on one's phone, and when the connection was established, place the handset into the <b>acoustic</b> <b>modem.</b> Since the handsets were all supplied by the telephone company, most had the same shape, simplifying the physical interface. A microphone and a speaker inside the modem box would pick up and transmit the signaling tones, and circuitry would convert those audio shift-key encoded frequency binary signals for an RS232 output socket. With luck one could get 300 baud (~bits/second) transmission rates, but 150 baud was more typical. That speed was sufficient for typewriter-based terminals, as the IBM 2741, running at 134.5 baud, or a teleprinter, running at 110 baud.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — <b>Acoustic</b> <b>modems</b> {{typically}} {{operate in}} half-duplex, which limits {{the choice of}} a data link control protocol to the Stop and Wait (S&W) type. Unfortunately, on channels with poor quality and long propagation delay–such as the majority of acoustic channels–S&W protocol has low throughput efficiency. The basic S&W can be improved by using a modification in which packets are transmitted in groups and acknowledged selectively. Throughput efficiency can now be maximized by selecting the optimal packet size, which is a function of range, rate, and error probability. Quantitative analysis for typical acoustic links shows that modified S&W protocols offer good performance, provided that packet size is chosen close to optimal. In addition, as the group size increases, sensitivity to packet size selection is reduced. To ensure best ARQ performance in mobile acoustic systems where link conditions vary with time, future generation of <b>acoustic</b> <b>modems</b> must focus on adaptive selection of protocol parameters.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} multi-hop reliable data transfer for underwater acoustic networks. Due {{to the unique}} features of underwater acoustic channels (such as long propagation delays and high channel error rates), conventional reliable data transfer approaches (such as simple transmission-upon-failure and coding) cannot be directly applied underwater. In addition, the strong property of half-duplex transmission of current <b>acoustic</b> <b>modems</b> requires joint optimization for a multi-hop network scenario {{in order to reduce}} end-to-end delay. Strongly motivated, we propose a new protocol, called FOuntain Code based Adaptive multi-hop Reliable data transfer (FOCAR). FOCAR is essentially a hybrid ARQ scheme which integrates coding with hop-by-hop retransmission-upon-failure. Fountain codes are used here due to the strong error correction capability and rateless property,which greatly simplifies the selective repeat procedure for reducing end-to-end delay and improving energy efficiency. Further, FOCAR considers the half duplex nature of underwater <b>acoustic</b> <b>modems,</b> adapting the block size of each hop to optimize the endto-end delay for the multi-hop network scenario. Extensive simulation results show that FOCAR can achieve high reliability with low end-to-end delay and high energy efficiency. I...|$|R
