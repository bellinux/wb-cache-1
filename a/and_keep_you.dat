500|$|The song {{itself was}} {{recorded}} at Chalice Recording Studios in Los Angeles. In {{an interview with}} Noisey, Oh Land spoke with Kim Taylor Bennett who asked her for further clarification on the lyrics. Bennett interpreted the lyrics as a [...] "girl who is perhaps incapable of love and commitment" [...] {{but by the end}} of the song, it is revealed that [...] "it's the guy who is the asshole", to which Oh Land confirmed and said, [...] "Yeah, so it's like, 'fuck you!'". She also described it as a song that [...] "fast-forwards a bit" [...] and inspires her because she believes that she [...] "will do everything better when [...] get older". Oh Land discusses loving someone to a deeper extent as she ages: [...] "I will wrap my arms around you <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>you</b> from the cold / I will love you better when I'm old". Several music critics described [...] "Love You Better" [...] as a ballad. The Guardians Paul MacInnes called the song an [...] "acoustic ballad", while Leonie Cooper from NME felt it was a [...] "folk ballad".|$|E
500|$|Bradner's job at Berkeley {{required}} him to do a number of underwater dives. He had previously talked to United States Navy frogmen during World War II concerning the problems of staying in cold water {{for long periods of}} time, which causes the diver to lose large amounts of body heat quickly. He worked on developing a new suit that would counter this in the basement of his family's home on Scenic Avenue in Berkeley, California, and researched the new wetsuit at a conference in Coronado, California, in December 1951. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, the wetsuit was invented in 1952. Bradner and other engineers founded the Engineering Development Company (EDCO) in order to develop it. He and his colleagues tested several versions and prototypes of the wetsuit at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California. Scripps scientist and engineer Willard Bascom advised Bradner to use neoprene for the suit material, which proved successful. He found that it [...] "would trap the water between the body and the neoprene, and the water would heat up to body temperature <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>you</b> warm".|$|E

2500|$|Anthony {{was born}} in the Red Hook {{projects}} in Brooklyn, New York City. He was born to a Black Puerto Rican father and an African-American mother, Mary Anthony. His father (after whom he is named) died of cancer when Anthony was two years old. When Anthony turned eight, his family moved to Baltimore, where he honed not only his athletic skills, but his survival skills. Kenny Minor, one of Anthony's childhood friends, said, [...] "from drugs, to killings, to anything you can name that goes on in the roughest parts of town, we've seen and witnessed hands on. Those are the things that teach you toughness <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>you</b> mentally focused on your goals." [...] Sports would serve as an important diversion from the violence and drug dealing that were pervasive in the housing projects {{a few blocks from the}} homes of Anthony and his friends.|$|E
2500|$|Jeff Haynes from IGN {{compared}} {{the game to}} the original, finding it fell short of the standard that game set; [...] "Manhunt 2 isn't the tour de force title that will grab your attention <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>you</b> there like the first one did." [...] The review went on to state that [...] "the AI doesn't feel {{as good as the}} first game, the setting and environments don't feel as menacing, and the story is definitely weaker. That isn't to say that Manhunt 2 isn't a good game, because it is." [...] 1UP.com stated that [...] "really, the game warrants a 4 [...] because it's technically playable and, despite its best efforts, probably won't plunge the industry into a period of navel-gazing and political sanction. Everything else about it is largely forgettable." [...] Jonathan Hunt from X-Play suggested that without the controversy concerning the rating, the game would be [...] "nothing more than an obscure footnote in Rockstar's history." [...] Because of its controversy the game is listed at #8 in IGN's [...] "Top 10 Gaming Controversies" [...] and is also listed in UGO's [...] "The Most Controversial Video Games".|$|E

2500|$|Den of Geek {{affirmed that}} [...] "Doctor Who hits top form with 'Kill the Moon'. [...] And Jenna Coleman {{has never been}} better". They also praised Harness' script as [...] "impressive" [...] and said that Wilmshurst [...] "fully understands that slowing things down and making little moments count {{is the key to}} {{crawling}} under people's skins". [...] They closed their review by saying [...] "The best Doctor Who episodes have something to say, get under your skin, <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> <b>you</b> pretty much gripped until the end credits roll. 'Kill the Moon' certainly did that, with us heading for a rewatch {{as soon as it was}} done. It has a good science fiction story underneath it, a strong dilemma, and real consequences". The A.V. Club also reacted very positively to the episode, awarding it an A score praising almost every aspect of the episode, but particularly the focus on character development. They said [...] "'Kill the Moon' is the second time this season that Doctor Who has genuinely surprised me. That fact, above all else, is why tonight’s episode rates as an instant classic" [...] and went on to praise the episode's final scene, saying that [...] "Maybe the whole Moffat era is going to be defined by that final scene in the TARDIS, in which Clara delivers the most blistering rebuke we have ever seen any companion give the Doctor". They ended their review by claiming that [...] "This season is already a return to form, but 'Kill the Moon' could help turn it into something truly special".|$|E
