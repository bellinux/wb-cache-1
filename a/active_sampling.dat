Whisking and sniffing are tightly correlated in their occurrence, with sniff inhalations occurring during whisker protraction. Due to the metabolic need to coordinate breathing and swallowing, small animals (rats and mice) often lick at similar frequencies of sniffing (4 to 8 Hz) and swallow in between inhalations or during brief periods of apnea (cessation of breathing).|$|E

50|$|The use of quality-controlled, commercially {{available}} receiving phases allow high reproducibility {{as compared to}} some other passive sampling devices. The bound receiving phase also ensures that the <b>active</b> <b>sampling</b> area of the device remains constant during laboratory or field calibration uptake experiments and in field deployments. By altering the combination of receiving phase and diffusion-limiting membrane (low-density polyethylene, polyethersulphone or cellulose acetate), you can monitor potable, surface , coastal and marine environment. The sampler can be deployed {{in the field for}} extended periods of time ranging from days to weeks. The specific pollutants of interest are sequestered by the samplers and these are retained on the receiving phase disk. After retrieval from the environment the pollutants are eluted from the disk and analysed in the laboratory using conventional instrumental methods. In order to obtain TWA concentrations the sampler must first be calibrated in the laboratory so as to ascertain the uptake rate (usually measured as the volume of water cleared per unit time i.e. L/h for the analyte) of the pollutant of interest. The Chemcatcher® has been used in a range of aquatic environments; however, most work to date has been in monitoring the TWA concentrations of priority and emerging pollutants surface waters.|$|E

This behavior, displayed by all terrestrial vertebrates, is typically identified based upon changes in respiratory frequency and/or amplitude, [...] and is often studied in the context of odor guided behaviors and olfactory perceptual tasks. Sniffing is quantified by measuring intra-nasal pressure or flow or air [...] or, while less accurate, through a strain gauge on the chest to measure total respiratory volume. Strategies for sniffing behavior vary depending upon the animal, with small animals (rats, mice, hamsters) displaying sniffing frequencies ranging from 4 to 12 Hz but larger animals (humans) sniffing at much lower frequencies, usually less than 2 Hz. Subserving sniffing behaviors, evidence for an [...] "olfactomotor" [...] circuit in the brain exists, [...] wherein perception or expectation of an odor can trigger brain respiratory center to allow for the modulation of sniffing frequency and amplitude and thus acquisition of odor information. Sniffing is analogous to other stimulus sampling behaviors, including visual saccades, active touch, and whisker movements in small animals (viz., whisking). [...] Atypical sniffing has been reported in cases of neurological disorders, especially those disorders characterized by impaired motor function and olfactory perception.|$|E

Moreover, body composition is divided into fat and fat free mass components. Research shows that physical activity {{is an important factor}} that affects body composition. This research aimed at estimating and comparing the body composition components of physically active and inactive male student of Shahroud University of technologyMethods: Participants of this study were 70 inactive male students with average age of (20. 86 ± 1. 72) years and 65 physically active male students with average age of (20. 86 ± 1. 72 years). The participants were randomly selected through stratified sampling procedure from various faculties and different admission years. Body composition was estimated with Body composition analyzer system that measured body composition components using bioelectrical impedance method. Results: Data analysis with SPSS- 15 software revealed that: average of BF% in physically <b>active</b> <b>sample</b> was (13. 43 ± 3. 15) and average of inactive samples was (16. 73 ± 6. 16) which statistically showed significant difference (P< 0. 001); the LBM in physically <b>active</b> <b>samples</b> was (60. 27 ± 8. 05 Kg) and average of inactive samples was (56. 43 ± 7. 6 Kg) which statistically showed significant difference (P< 0. 005); the average of BMI in physically <b>active</b> <b>sample</b> was (22. 62 ± 2. 8 kgm) and average of inactive samples was (22. 25 ± 3. 84 kgm) which statistically did not show significant difference (P= 0. 519); the WHR average of physically <b>active</b> <b>samples</b> was (0. 798 ±. 03 m) and average of inactive samples was (0. 81 ±. 06 m) and there was not {{a significant difference between the}} two groups.

In one pathology and one histology laboratories, exposure measurements were collected with sets of active air samplers (Supelco LpDNPH tubes) and passive badges (ChemDisk Aldehyde Monitor 571). Sixty-six sample pairs (49 personal and 17 area) were collected and analyzed by NIOSH NMAM 2016 for <b>active</b> <b>samples</b> and OSHA Method 1007 (using the manufacturer's updated uptake rate) for passive <b>samples.</b> All <b>active</b> and passive 8 -hr time-weighted average (TWA) measurements showed compliance with the OSHA permissible exposure limit (PEL- 0. 75 ppm) except for one passive measurement, whereas 78 % for the active and 88 % for the passive samples exceeded the NIOSH recommended exposure limit (REL- 0. 016 ppm). Overall, 73 % of the passive samples showed higher concentrations than the <b>active</b> <b>samples</b> and a statistical test indicated disagreement between two methods for all data and for data without outliers. The OSHA Method cautions that passive samplers should not be used for sampling situations involving formalin solutions because of low concentration estimates in the presence of reaction products of formaldehyde and methanol (a formalin additive). However, this situation was not observed, perhaps because the formalin solutions used in these laboratories included much less methanol (3 %) than those tested in the OSHA Method (up to 15 %). The passive samplers in general overestimated concentrations compared to the active method, which is prudent for demonstrating compliance with an occupational exposure limit, but occasional large differences may be a result of collecting aerosolized droplets or splashes {{on the face of the}} samplers. In the situations examined in this study the passive sampler generally produces higher results than the <b>active</b> <b>sampler</b> so that a body of results from passive samplers demonstrating compliance with the OSHA PEL would be a valid conclusion. However, individual passive samples can show lower results than a paired <b>active</b> <b>sampler</b> so that a single result should be treated with caution.

In this paper, we suggest an <b>active</b> <b>sampling</b> method based on the recently proposed Maximum-Margin Matrix Factorization (MMMF) [7], a linear factor model that was shown to outperform state-of-art collaborative prediction techniques. MMMF is formulated as a semidefinite program (SDP) that finds a low-norm (rather than traditional low-rank) matrix factorization, and is also closely related to learning max-margin linear discriminants (SVMs). This relation to SVMs inspires several margin-based <b>active</b> <b>sampling</b> heuristics that augment MMMF and demonstrate promising results in a variety of practical domains, including both traditional recommender systems and novel systems-management applications such as predicting latency and bandwidth in computer networks.

This great generality comes naturally {{with a lack}} of specificity when focusing on a particular task or a set of classes. Metric learning approaches have been proposed to tailor general purpose representations to the needs of more specific tasks and have shown strong improvements on visual matching and recognition benchmarks. However, the performance of metric learning depends strongly on the labels that are used for learning. Therefore, we propose to combine metric learning with an <b>active</b> <b>sample</b> selection strategy in order to find labels that are representative for each class as well as improve the class separation of the learnt metric.
