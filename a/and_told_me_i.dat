It was announced on February 28, 2015 that Burrell will be inducted onto the Phillies Wall of Fame. He was subsequently inducted on Friday, July 31.

In 2000, he was inducted in Don Garlits' International Drag Racing Hall of Fame. Hill {{was inducted into}} the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2002. After he was notified of his nomination, he said [...] "It's so much more satisfying to get this award now than posthumously. This way I'll be able to enjoy it. Honestly, it was a sobering moment when they called <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> was being inducted along with some of the people I admired most growing up. It gives you reason to pause for a moment and reflect that maybe some good was accomplished along the way." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lisa Goldstein portrays Millicent Huxtable, Brooke's {{assistant}} at her shop Clothes Over Bros. [...] "I was constantly auditioning for TV and film while performing in professional theatre", said Goldstein. [...] "My agent in Orlando called {{and told me}} there was an audition for One Tree Hill, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> could either audition for the receptionist or the quirky fashion assistant, 'Millicent.'

6000|$|... 'Yes. I found I'd a {{few hours}} between the trains, so I ran down to look you up. I met Harry at the house, <b>and</b> he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> should find Jane {{qualifying}} for the female parliament.' ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1869, Dr. Dio Lewis {{gave the}} lecture in Dover {{that he gave}} three years later in Hillsboro, Ohio, where it {{inspired}} the woman's temperance crusade {{and led to the}} organization of the W. C. T. U. In Dover, a committee of women was appointed, meetings held and saloons visited. Burlingame was a member of this committee, presided at the great mass meetings held, and was offered the leadership of the movement, which she declined. “In June, 1873,” said Burlingame, “Mrs. M. M. H. Hills came to my house <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> had been elected president of the Free Baptist W.M.S., just organized at the New Hampshire Yearly Meeting. I at once decided that if president in name, I would be in fact. It had been the custom for women's societies in the denomination to ask a minister to preside, read reports and conduct all public business. I arranged at the first meeting after my election for the women to do their own work. I well remember the first time I presided at the Anniversaries in 1873 at Farmington, N. H." [...] The prominent men, Dr. O. B. Cheney, Rev. Ebenezer Knowlton, who had formerly conducted the exercises for the women, sat in the front pew, ready to grasp the helm should anything go wrong. Ascending the steps to the platform, Burlingame was too abashed to stand behind the pulpit, so she stood beside it. Other officers sustained their parts well. At the close of the exercises Rev. Knowlton came and congratulated her and said, [...] "The brethren will have to look out for their laurels after this.” ...|$|E
60|$|The gentlemen laughed, the Abbe the loudest, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> {{was quite}} welcome; such {{victories}} were esteemed honourable.|$|E
60|$|Well, {{they let}} me in, then, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> was safe forever and wouldn't have any more trouble.|$|E
5000|$|... "After they (the US military) {{gave me a}} blood {{transfusion}} after my suicide attempt, I have been suffering from a strange condition,:"They carried out an examination of my blood <b>and</b> they <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> have blood diseases and problems.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very little--nothing in fact {{but what}} {{she and her sister}} showed me in the morning paper. I know they're in great {{distress}} about him; I just met Miss Suzette and your sister, <b>and</b> they <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> should find you at the station." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] {{said her}} husband, with a confirmatory nod. [...] "Wonderful is no name for it. I 'ad my fortune told once when I was a boy, <b>and</b> she <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> should marry the prettiest, and the nicest, and the sweetest-tempered gal in Poplar." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{clung to}} him and begged and pleaded, {{but he was not}} moved. He made me sit down again, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> must hear him out.|$|E
6000|$|... "The captain see me {{standing}} around, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> better {{have something to}} eat before I went ashore; so he took me in the texas to the officers' lunch, and give me all I wanted." ...|$|E
60|$|But when I was expressing my self thus, my Philosopher {{interrupted}} me, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> {{should see}} {{they were already}} furnisht for that purpose, when I came to examine the publick Libraries, of which by it self.|$|E
60|$|This amazed him, <b>and</b> he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> {{was pleased}} to be mysterious, {{but that he was}} sure it was in nobody's power to hinder him going, if he {{resolved}} upon it, except me, who had influence enough upon him to make him do anything.|$|R
6000|$|... “Yes, a most {{beautiful}} little lamb. When {{he was very}} little indeed, he was weak and sick, and father thought he would not live; <b>and</b> he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> might have him if I wanted him. I made a bed {{for him in the}} corner of the kitchen.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, and I {{never saw}} my mother more exulting. When Rosamond ran down to tell her, {{she put her}} arms round her neck and cried. She who never had a tear through all last year. I met your father and mother half-way, <b>and</b> they <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> might come on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Rose went to work. She {{had a hard}} time. I {{never heard}} from her for weeks. But she's a {{telephone}} operator at the Exchange now. She called me up one day lately <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>me.</b> <b>I</b> hope to see her soon." ...|$|E
60|$|Her bright calm face lighted up with {{pleasure}} {{as she went}} to meet him, and as they came in, hand in hand. He greeted me cordially; <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> should certainly be happy under Doctor Strong, {{who was one of}} the gentlest of men.|$|E
6000|$|... "She laughed, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> {{need not}} give myself any uneasiness; {{there would be}} no {{unreasonable}} opposition. She knew my family and all about me. The only obstacle was that I had no means of supporting a wife, and she had nothing to give with her daughter.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{look as if}} you had {{a corner}} in time, Curt," [...] said Will. [...] "I call that luck, for I want you to go chestnutting up to Grier's Hill with <b>me.</b> <b>I</b> met old Tom Grier on the road yesterday, <b>and</b> he <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> might go any day. Nice old man, Tom Grier." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>told</b> <b>me</b> to live rightly, and be regular in {{attendance}} upon {{the services of}} the Church. <b>And</b> it <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>I</b> must go to France." ...|$|R
6000|$|Ha! Goneril!--with a white beard!--They flattered {{me like a}} dog; <b>and</b> [...] <b>told</b> <b>me,</b> <b>I</b> had white hairs in my beard, ere {{the black}} ones were there.

6000|$|... "I don't understand," [...] he said wearily. [...] "You always set him on me <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> was {{a coward}} when I blubbed. Will {{you leave me}} alone until Aunty Rosa comes in? She'll beat me if you tell her I ought to be beaten; so it's all right." ...|$|E

60|$|Kate again laughed, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> {{might make}} my own {{observations}} on that point, and judge for myself. As for the visit, I had only accidentally favored a project of others. The conversation now changed, and for several miles we rode along, conversing of the scenes of the war, without adverting to the Bayards or to marriages.|$|E
6000|$|... "You stopped, {{and spoke}} to me, sir," [...] {{proceeded}} Mr. Bashwood, advancing more and more eagerly to his end. [...] "You said you suspected me of feeling some curiosity about Miss Gwilt, <b>and</b> you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> (<b>I</b> remember the exact words, sir)--you <b>told</b> <b>me</b> to gratify my curiosity by all means, for you didn't object to it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Laughed till {{he cried}} again, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> if <b>I</b> {{did not like}} it I might leave it; which is just what I intend to do. Only mind, if we go, we must needs take Jack Brimblecombe with us, or he will surely heave himself over Harty Point, and his ghost will haunt us to our dying day." ...|$|R
60|$|So {{he withdrew}} from me, {{and then came}} several of the justice's {{servants}} to <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> that <b>I</b> stood so much upon a nicety. Their master, they said, was willing to let me go; and if I would but say I would call the people no more together, I might have my liberty, &c.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Fox, himself, for one. He {{thought it}} so good,--or so bad,--that {{he took me}} aside last night at Lady Tankerville's, asked me why I had let you out of Castle Yard, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> must manage to curb your tongue.

6000|$|Ada {{laughed and}} put her arm about my neck as I stood looking at the fire, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> was a quiet, dear, good {{creature}} and had won her heart. [...] "You are so thoughtful, Esther," [...] she said, [...] "and yet so cheerful! And you do so much, so unpretendingly! You would make a home out of even this house." ...|$|E
6000|$|Harding’s eyes twinkled. “If you {{had gone}} {{there every day}} it wouldn’t have worried me. Your head is tolerably level, and Nettie has rather more sense than most young women, {{but that is not}} the point, anyway. When she was leaving England she wrote to me, <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> might let you know there were people over there, and one, I believe in particular, who had heard the truth about you.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Feinstein told an interviewer: [...] "The New York {{art world}} is very {{protective}} of itself...They don't {{like it when}} something is not in an art magazine. Dealers <b>and</b> collectors <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> shouldn't have been in Vogue. They {{feel that they have}} to defend you because you were photographed at some party, so it means you are not a great artist." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Maybe so. But I'M {{not going}} home through the Bailey garden any more. Here's Jerry {{with a big}} string of trout and it's my turn to cook them. Jem and Jerry both say I'm the best cook in the Glen. <b>And</b> Cornelia <b>told</b> <b>me</b> <b>I</b> could bring up this batch of cookies. I all but dropped them when I saw Henry's ghost." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Milly. [...] "Jim {{had nothing}} until an uncle died {{and left him}} three or four hundred pounds. When he came <b>and</b> <b>told</b> <b>me</b> of it <b>I</b> made him go." ...|$|R
