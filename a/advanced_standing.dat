2500|$|Both {{private and}} public colleges exist side by side, public {{institutions}} called general and professional education colleges (Official French only name: Collège d'enseignement général et professionnel or CÉGEP) and private independent college institutions in Quebec straddle the definitions of both secondary and post-secondary education. [...] In Quebec, these institutions are readily considered post-secondary, but Quebec is the only province that requires 11 (rather than 12) years of study {{in order to obtain}} the high school diploma. [...] While standard admission to college is based on the secondary school diploma of Quebec (representing completion of grade 11), completion of the two-year college program does not give students the equivalent of a university Diploma (university diplomas throughout Canada are awarded following completion of at least a two-year post-secondary program of study). [...] Rather, holders of the two-year college diploma still must complete a minimum of three years of university education in order to obtain a bachelor's degree. [...] Under Canadian law, Bachelor's degrees from government-accredited universities in Canada are considered equal, whether from Quebec or other provinces. [...] Those unfamiliar with Quebec may wonder if three-year university programs there are therefore equal to four-year university programs in other provinces, or in other countries where four-year first university degree programs are the norm. [...] However, given that college diploma holders are granted up to one year of <b>advanced</b> <b>standing</b> credit at any university, it is clear {{that this is not the}} case. [...] What exists in Quebec is simply a different structure of education than in other provinces, which ultimately yields exactly the same total duration of study when years of secondary and post-secondary study are combined.|$|E
