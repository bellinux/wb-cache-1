A product configurator is a tool which supports the product configuration process so that all the design and configuration rules which are expressed in a product configuration model are guaranteed to be satisfied. The configurator simplifies the manufacturing process by assuring that all orders received are possible to [...] ...|$|R

Four types of <b>family</b> <b>benefits</b> including eight distinctive categories are analysed: child-benefit, child care allowances, child-raising allowances, and other benefits (birth and adoption grants, allowance for single parents, special allowances for children with disabilities, advance payments for maintenance and other allowances). The paper is based on primary and secondary analysis of 28 sets of national data provided through the European Union's Mutual Information System on Social Protection (MISSOC). Three categories of member states are considered: founder member states of the EU, other “old” member states, and the new Central and Eastern ones. Chronological development of national regulations with impact on <b>family</b> <b>benefits</b> is analysed in connection with the moment of becoming a member state. Various forms of <b>family</b> <b>benefits</b> legislation and their main subjects of interest are further researched. The last part of the article looks at the coverage of <b>family</b> <b>benefits.</b> Seven member states operate in this respect based on regulations adopted before EU accession. Belgium, Finland, and Lithuania have the “most preserved” family regulations per category of member states. The first three topics of family regulations are: child, family, and allowance / benefit.

40|$|The Italian {{system of}} {{economic}} support {{for those on}} low incomes and for families is among the least effective in Europe. Its incoherent nature is shown by very large jumps in implicit marginal tax rates (taxation + <b>family</b> <b>benefits).</b> Italy needs a comprehensive reform of the treatment of income for tax and social welfare purposes. This paper proposes {{a new system of}} benefits and taxation for Italy based on a discussion of the theoretical properties of different schemes for integrating taxation and <b>family</b> <b>benefits.</b> The proposal combines tax allowance for work, designed to provide incentives to work, a flat rate <b>family</b> <b>benefit</b> and changes in the structure of tax rates which would incorporate the progressivity that is implicit in the current system of <b>family</b> <b>benefits.</b> The proposed system exhibits some of the characteristics of social dividend and negative income tax schemes. A micro-simulation exercise shows that the scheme would produce redistributive effects in favour of middle and low incomes and would lead to significant improvements in poverty and inequality indicators. personal taxation, <b>family</b> <b>benefits,</b> social dividend and negative income tax...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Many OECD {{countries}} have replied to economic recessions with an adaption in public spending on social <b>benefits</b> for <b>families</b> {{and young people}} in need. So far, no study has examined the impact of public social spending during the recent economic recession on health, and social inequalities in health among young people. This study investigates whether an increase in public spending relates to a lower prevalence in health complaints and buffers health inequalities among adolescents. Methods Data {{were obtained from the}} 2009 / 2010 “Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) ” study comprising 11 – 15 -year-old adolescents from 27 European countries (N[*]=[*] 144, 754). Socioeconomic position was measured by the Family Affluence Scale (FAS). Logistic multilevel models were conducted for the association between the absolute rate of public spending on <b>family</b> <b>benefits</b> per capita in 2010 and the relative change rate in <b>family</b> <b>benefits</b> (2006 – 2010) in relation to adolescent psychological health complaints in 2009 / 2010. Results The absolute rate of public spending on <b>family</b> <b>benefits</b> in 2010 did not show a significant association with adolescents’ psychological health complaints. Relative change rates of public spending on <b>family</b> <b>benefits</b> (2006 – 2010) were related to better health. Greater socioeconomic inequalities in psychological health complaints were found for countries with higher change rates in public spending on <b>family</b> <b>benefits</b> (2006 – 2010). Conclusions The results partially support our hypothesis and highlight that policy initiatives in terms of an increase in <b>family</b> <b>benefits</b> might partially benefit adolescent health, but tend to widen social inequalities in adolescent health during the recent recession...|$|R
