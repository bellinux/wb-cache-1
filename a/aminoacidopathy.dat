40|$|<b>Aminoacidopathies</b> are a {{group of}} rare and diverse disorders, caused by the {{deficiency}} of an enzyme or transporter involved in amino acid metabolism. For most <b>aminoacidopathies,</b> dietary management is the mainstay of treatment.

For some <b>aminoacidopathies,</b> supplementation {{of one or two}} amino acids, that have not become essential by the enzymatic defect, has been suggested. This so-called single amino acid supplementation can serve different treatment objectives, but evidence is limited.

Aim: This research {{is part of a larger}} study of inherited metabolic disorders to characterize and measure the prevalence of <b>aminoacidopathies.</b> Settings and Design: Cross-sectional study in the population aged 0 - 17 years old in Isfahan province of Iran, 2007 - 2015. Subjects and Methods: Demographic characteristics, history of disease, development of clinical condition and socioeconomic status were obtained from interviews as well as patient records of pediatric tertiary referral hospitals and metabolic disorders centers.

40|$|Abstract__ Disorders of {{amino acid}} {{metabolism}} or transport are most clearly expressed in urine. Nevertheless {{the interpretation of}} abnormalities in urinary amino acid excretion remains difficult. An increase or decrease of almost every amino acid in urine can be due to various etiology. To differentiate between primary and secondary aminoacido-pathies systematic laboratory investigation is necessary. Early diagnosis of disorders of amino acid metabolism or transport is very important, because most {{of them can be}} treated, leading to the prevention of (further) clinical abnormalities. In those disorders, which cannot be treated, early diagnosis in an index-patient may prevent the birth of other siblings by means of genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis. Primary <b>aminoacidopathies</b> can be due to genetically determined transport disorders and enzyme deficiencies in amino acid metabolism or degradation. Secondary <b>aminoacidopathies</b> are the result of abnormal or deficient nutrition, intestinal dysfunction, organ pathology or other metabolic diseases like organic acidurias. A survey of amino acid metabolism and transport abnormalities will be given, illustrated with metabolic pathways and characteristic abnormal amino acid chromatograms...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY The {{concentration}} of 27 amino acids in the vitreous humour was analysed in 120 cot deaths. Baseline data for age and postmortem interval are presented and the concentrations {{compared with the}} normal reference range for plasma. The results do not indicate that a specific <b>aminoacidopathy</b> {{is a factor in}} cot deaths. Since 1979 cot deaths have been investigated as part of an overall survey of postperinatal infant mortality in Glasgow and latterly (1981 - 2) in a national study for the whole of Scotland. ' In an attempt to exclude a specific <b>aminoacidopathy</b> as a cause of cot death the free amino acid content of the vitreous humour was analysed in a number of the Glasgow cases. To our knowledge this has not been previously documented, although there are two reports of vitreous amino acid studies in adults. 2 3 Methods Vitreous humour was aspirated before postmortem examination at the lateral angle of the eye from infants in an unselected series of 120 cot deaths in the Glasgow area (1979 - 84) representing 54 % {{of the total number of}} cases in that period. The series included 72 boys and 48 girls and reflected the 3 : 2 male preponderance of cot deaths in our area and in other series. 4 The cases were all infants under 1 year of age who had died suddenly and unexpectedly at home without a preceding illness or significant symptoms and as such all did not fit the standard definition of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The postmortem examinations were carried out in accordance with the instructions of the Procurator Fiscal and followed a standard protocol which included histology of the major organs and selective microbiology. A specific cause of death was estab-lished in 13 cases (11 '%o) and nine had other incidental conditions. One ml of vitreous humour was deproteinised by adding 50 mg of salicylsulphonic acid and mixing the resultant solution. After centrifugation at 2000 g for 10 minutes the protein free supernatant was stored at- 25 °C before analysis. 100 [tl samples were applied to both columns of a Technicon TSM aminoacid analyser with norleucine being used as an internal standard.

40|$|Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is an {{autosomal}} recessive <b>aminoacidopathy</b> secondary to an enzyme {{defect in the}} catabolic pathway of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs: leucine, isoleucine, and valine). Accumulation of their corresponding keto-acids leads to encephalopathy if not treated in time. A newborn male patient was suspected to have MSUD after tandem mass study when he presented symptoms and signs suggestive neonatal sepsis, anemia, and diarrhea. Food restriction of BCAAs was started; however, acrodermatitis enteropathica-like skin eruptions occurred at age 2 months. The skin rashes resolved after adding BCAAs and adjusting the infant formula. At age 7 months, he suffered from recurrent skin lesions, zinc deficiency, osteoporosis, and kyphosis of the thoracic spine with acute angulation over the T 11 -T 12 level associated with spinal compression and myelopathy. After supplementation of zinc products and pamidronate, skin lesions and osteopenia improved gradually. Direct sequencing of the DBT gene showed a compound heterozygous mutation [4. 7  kb deletion and c. 650 - 651 insT (L 217 F or L 217 fsX 223) ]. It is unusual that neurodegeneration still developed in this patient despite diet restriction.

40|$|High-voltage paper {{electrophoresis}} {{of small}} samples of serum and urine at pH 6. 0 resolves basic and acidic amino acids and separates {{them from the}} neutral amino acids. For separation and identification of the neutral amino acids, the appropriate area of the electrophore-togram is cut out, sewn onto a second sheet of paper, and rerun at pH 1. 9.

40|$|International audienceInborn {{errors of}} {{metabolism}} (IEMs) that present with abnormal imaging {{findings in the}} second half of pregnancy are mainly lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs), cholesterol synthesis disorders (CSDs), glycogen storage disorder type IV (GSD IV), peroxisomal disorders, mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation defects (FAODs), organic acidurias, <b>aminoacidopathies,</b> congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs), and transaldolase deficiency. Their biological investigation requires fetal material. The supernatant of amniotic fluid (AF) is useful for the analysis of mucopolysaccharides, oligosaccharides, sialic acid, lysosphingolipids and some enzyme activities for LSDs, 7 - and 8 -dehydrocholesterol, desmosterol and lathosterol for CSDs, acylcarnitines for FAODs, organic acids for organic acidurias, and polyols for transaldolase deficiency. Cultured AF or fetal cells allow the measurement of enzyme activities for most IEMs, whole-cell assays, or metabolite measurements. The cultured cells or tissue samples taken after fetal death can be used for metabolic profiling, enzyme activities, and DNA extraction. Fetal blood can also be helpful. The identification of vacuolated cells orients toward an LSD, and plasma is useful for diagnosing peroxisomal disorders, FAODs, CSDs, some LSDs, and possibly CDGs and <b>aminoacidopathies.</b> We investigated AF of 1700 pregnancies after exclusion of frequent etiologies of nonimmune hydrops fetalis and identified 108 fetuses affected with LSDs (6. 3 %), 29 of them with mucopolysaccharidosis type VII (MPS VII), and six with GSD IV (0. 3 %).

MethodsThis retrospective study was conducted between January 2010 and December 2011 at Saad Specialist Hospital (Al Khobar, Saudi Arabia). All patients younger than 2 years {{at the onset of}} epilepsy caused by metabolic disorders were reviewed. The International League Against Epilepsy definition was used, and febrile convulsion was excluded. ResultsOf 221 children diagnosed with epilepsy in the first 2 years of life at our hospital, 24 had metabolic diseases.

Objective To examine the demographic and neurological profile in a case of MSUD. Patients and Methods A descriptive cross sectional study from 1 February 2014 to 1 February 2016, at Neurological ward and clinic of the Children Welfare teaching Hospital, in Baghdad, Iraq. Plasma specimens of 600 patients, with clinical suspicion of inborn error of metabolism (IEM) because of unexplained neurological deficits, unexplained developmental delay, recurrent coma and/or neuro-degeneration, MSUD were confirmed in 29 patients then clinical data of patients were reported and analyzed statistically. Results Out of 600 patients visiting the neurological outpatient and ward, clinical and neurological findings were recorded as well as the family history and/or other symptoms suggestive of <b>aminoacidopathy,</b> 35 patients were confirmed their diagnosis as MSUD, 6 patients were excluded because they lost the follow up, therefore only 29 patients were enrolled, most of them (28 patients) were affected by classical MSUD, where only one patient had intermittent type.

D.), College of Pharmacy, Washington State UniversityThe body of this {{dissertation}} {{is focused}} on understanding the pathomechanisms and {{paving the way for}} new treatment paradigms in human metabolic disease, particularly phenylketonuria (PKU), maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), and succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency. Phenylketonuria and MSUD are heritable <b>aminoacidopathies</b> displaying aberrant cerebral transport of large neutral aminoacids. This work presents evidence that non-physiological amino acids (NPAAs) have pharmacodynamic efficacy in selective exclusion of phenylalanine from the brain of phenylketonuric mice. Data is presented for feeding and intraperitoneal injection studies of various NPAA's including methyl-aminoisobutyric acid (MAIB), and some selected MAIB-related alkanoic acid analogues. My data indicates that MAIB is the most selective phenylalanine transport inhibitor identified thus far. Regional brain amino acid studies in intermediate MSUD mice fed low (6 %) and high (19 %) protein chow suggest that despite varying improvements in the pathophysiological branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine) in serum, glutamine, aspartate, glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), asparagine, citrulline, and serine levels remained unchanged in the brain, demonstrating that dietary correction of MSUD monitored in blood does not accurately reveal corrections in brain biochemistry, providing important insights for human patients. Moreover, I have documented similar findings in PKU mice. The final chapters of this work contain a review of the treatment prospects for SSADH disorder (a defect in GABA metabolism), and our collaborative work with the University of California focused on hyperphysiological GABA's on mTOR-driven selective autophagy. SSADH-deficient mouse studies utilizing electron microscopy to quantify mitochondria in liver and brain tissues suggest mitophagic inhibition may play a causal role in the findings of oxidative stress in patients and mice. The impact of these findings are discussed from a pharmacological viewpoint including the scope of treatment of hyperGABAergic disorders. Lastly, I have included my literature characterization of hepatocyte transplantation (HTx) for inborn errors of metabolism which suggests that we can attempt therapeutic HTx in a murine model of a new disease, transaldolase deficiency, with a goal of gaining almost complete hepatic repopulation with gene-replete (wild-type) cells. My final article is a preclude to future postdoctoral work in the area of liver repopulation and novel therapeutic approaches. College of Pharmacy, Washington State Universit...|$|R
40|$|METABOLOMICS AND MASS SPECTROMETRY The {{research}} project {{take place in}} the branch of metabolomics, which involves the systematic study of the metabolites present in a cell and in this area MS, thanks to its potential to carry out controlled experiments of fragmentation, plays a role as a key methodology for identification of various metabolites. The work of thesis project is focused on the analytical methods development for the diagnosis of metabolic diseases and is divided as follows: 	Newborn screening of inborn error of metabolism; 	Therapeutic drug monitoring in CML patients. NEWBORN SCREENING OF INBORN ERROR OF METABOLISM Newborn screening is the process by which infants are screened shortly after birth for a list of disorders that are treatable, but difficult or impossible to detect clinically. The history of neonatal screening of inherited metabolic disease has seen a continuous and positive change limits screening to duplicate the examinative confirmation, through the introduction of new analytical technologies, such as tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), which allow testing not only qualitative but also quantitative. It has allowed to move from single test to multiple screening tests for other diseases such as metabolic <b>aminoacidopathies</b> a lower incidence, organic acidurias and defects of fatty acid oxidation. Disorders detected by most MS/MS newborn screening programs can be divided in three major categories: 	Amino acid disorders including urea cycle defects 	Organic acid disorders 	Fatty acid oxidation defects Fatty acid oxidation disorders are a group of inherited metabolic conditions that lead to an accumulation of fatty acids, and a decrease in cell energy metabolism. Each fatty acid oxidation disorder is associated with a specific enzyme defect in the fatty acid metabolic pathway and affects utilization of dietary and stored fat. Newborn screening includes testing for a panel of acylcarnitines. In some cases, an elevated level of a particular acylcarnitine may indicate the possibility of one of several different fatty acid oxidation disorders; the specific disorder cannot be determined without diagnostic further testing. It has been demonstrated that the following fatty acid oxidation disorders may be detected in newborn dried blood spot samples using a testing panel. Fatty acids with carbon chain lengths of primarily 18 carbons or less are metabolized in the mitochondria by a process known as β-oxidation. Several disorders in mitochondrial β-oxidation have been characterized and include very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency, medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCADD) deficiency, short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD) deficiency, multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MADD) etc. A pilot expanded newborn screening programme to detect inherited metabolic disorders, by means of liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), began in the Campania region, southern Italy, in 2007. By October 2011, > 23. 753 dried blood samples on filter paper from 14 hospitals in the region had been screened in our laboratory. Within this programme, we detected two cases of Medium Chain acyl CoA Dehydrogenase (MCADD) deficiency, one case of β-ketothiolase Deficiency, one case of Short Branched Chain Amino acid Deficiency, two cases of maternal vitamin B 12 deficiency, one case of Propionic aciduria, one case of Isovaleric aciduria, one case of Methymlonic aciduria and one case of Isobutirryl CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency. In the elaborate, it is reported a clinical case describing the situation of a newborn to whom is diagnosed a Medium-Chain Acyl CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency at birth. Immediately after the diagnosis, the patient underwent emergency therapy with glucose, after which the carnitine concentration decreased significantly as described in the Figure 9 where is shown the profile of acylcarnitine during therapy. The results of therapy are evident: LC-MS/MS analysis shows that C 0 decreases from 0. 62 µmol/L to 0. 2 µmol/L, the C 8 decreases from 6. 14 µmol/L to 0. 98 µmol/L, the C 10 decreases from 0. 60 µmol/L to 0, 11 µmol/L and C 10 : 1 decreases from 0. 51 µmol/L to 0. 25 µmol/L. The biochemical and molecular analysis are extended to family members, and in this way, the early detection allows not only to discover that the relatives of affected child were healthy carriers of the disease, heterozygous for the mutation, but also to discover that her brother, one year and three months old, was affected with the same pathology, thereby allowing to save the baby treating him with proper medical care. THERAPEUTIC DRUG MONITORING IN CML PATIENTS The second line of research has focused on the development of analytical methods for qualitative and quantitative assessments of drugs in biological fluids, especially on the assay of imatinib, a drug used to treat patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) is a malignant neoplasia caused by an acquired alteration of the totipotent stem cell of the bone marrow. The genetic abnormality of CML is the translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, which causes the shaping of a shorter chromosome 22 (Philadelphia chromosome) and creates an hybrid gene, the BCR/ABL gene, which encodes an oncoprotein (Bcr/Abl) with tyrosine-kinase activity deregulated. In 1998, when imatinib was distributed in the marked, a great improvement in the treatment of CML was made. Imatinib is the first of a new category of chemotherapeutic agents that act by inhibiting enzymes with tyrosine-kinase activity rather than inhibiting the rapid cells division; imatinib acts as an allosteric inhibitor: it inhibits the substrate phosphorylation by ATP, blocking the enzymatic protein in a conformation that prevents ATP access to the active site. Imatinib plasma monitoring is important for treatment because patients being treated can acquire resistance to the drug after 4 - 5 years of treatment; in case of failure of the therapy and occurrence of severe adverse events it is important to intervene promptly by adjusting the dose of imatinib or making other therapeutic choices based on the administration of II generation drugs such as nilotinib and dasatinib. The doctorate was conducted in a laboratory included in the project EUTOS imatinib BLT (Blood Level Testing) as reference center in central and southern Italy and islands to evaluate plasma imatinib concentrations. To evaluate plasma imatinib concentrations, an analytical procedure was developed that uses LC-MS/MS. The spectrometer on which the method has been developed is a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, it consists of three quadrupoles in series, in which the first and third, Q 1 and Q 3, work as mass filters while the second acts as a collision cell. The possibility to set individually the quadrupoles on specifics mass range allows a highly selective and specific analysis. We make scans of the first mass analyzer to obtain the maximum sensitivity on the mass/charge ratio of the precursor ions through the optimization of a series of instrumental parameters. Once the precursor ion was optimized in terms of sensitivity and selectivity, we proceed to its fragmentation in the collision cell (Q 2), in order to establish its characteristic product ions. The choice of product ions is very important because, under certain conditions, a molecule fragment in the same way and they will be always the same fragments, so the product ions selected at this stage will be those that will characterize the molecule and will allow the identification in very complex matrices. Once optimized the parameters for the characteristics fragmentation, chromatographic conditions are optimized too. Once developed and optimized the method, imatinib plasma concentrations for patients enrolled in the EUTOS project were dosed. Imatinib blood-level testing data are processed through a digital platform, the "Labnet" that acts as a direct connection between hematology centers associated and reference centers for imatinib dose monitoring. A further objective of the project was to evaluate the correlation of two methods for the assay of imatinib plasma concentration: LC-MS/MS e HPLC-UV/VIS. So, were dosed imatinib plasma concentrations of 162 patients classified in five groups according to the daily dose of imatinib: 9 patients with a 200 mg daily dose, 29 with 300 mg, 91 with 400 mg, 24 with 600 mg and 9 with 800 mg dose. The samples were analyzed in triplicate applying both methods: the correlation coefficient between the two methods is calculated using the total set of data for each group of data corresponding to the five groups of patients. The results showed {{no significant differences between the}} data obtained applying both methods. The Bland-Altman method is used to compare the data obtained by HPLC-UV and LC-MS/MS. The Bland and Altman plot is a statistical method to compare two measurements techniques in clinical chemistry. The plot represents a graphical method in which the differences (or alternatively the ratios) between the two techniques are plotted against the average of the difference of the two techniques. If the differences between measurements using the two assay methods lie within the limits of agreement of the Bland–Altman test 95 % of the time, this indicated that the two methods were not producing different results. Applying the method of differences to the dose results of the 162 samples analyzed by LC-MS/MS HPLC-UV/VIS it was shown that the measurements lie within the limits of agreement and the two methods were, therefore, interchangeable. Over the time, six patients were monitored detecting the plasma imatinib concentration using LC-MS/MS and molecular response (MR) to assess the relationship between the two analysis. This comparison showed that the LC-MS/MS analysis confirmed molecular response data: in case of major molecular response, there was a plasma concentration of imatinib of about 1000 ng/mL (optimal concentration), instead, in absence of good response to therapy, there was an imatinib plasma concentration lower or higher than the optimal one. During the PhD course, experiments have been undertaken for the identification and quantification of metabolites resulting from biotransformation of imatinib, through LC-MS/MS analysis. For this reason, a method was developed for determining simultaneously the imatinib parent drug and some its metabolites that may have relevance if bioactive. The monitoring of new biomarkers could allow the use of imatinib calibrated on individual metabolism, in order to maximize effectiveness and minimize adverse effects. 		 The laboratory, where PhD project was performed, is included in the international protocol GINEMA (Italian Group for Haematological Diseases) CML 0408. The Protocol GINEMA CML 0408 is an experimental study of phase II, for the first-line treatment of CML, BCR-ABL positive, with two tyrosine-kinase inhibitors: imatinib and nilotinib. 		 Nilotinib and imatinib don’t were given together, but according to a schedule rotation, 3 months nilotinib, 3 months imatinib, for 24 months (core study), and for other 36 months (study extension) if the patient was interested to continue. 	 The nilotinib was administered orally twice a day, for a total daily dose of 800 mg. Imatinib was given orally once daily with a dose of 400 mg. The primary objective of this project was to evaluate the correlation between drug response and the plasma level of drugs. 	 For this purpose, in addition to developing a method for determination of imatinib, it was also developed a LC-MS/MS method for the dosage of nilotinib. To date, 123 patients enrolled in the study, excluding 23 dropouts, all patients have reached 12 months of treatment. After 30 days of treatment with nilotinib, patients had a plasma mean concentration of 2438 ng/Ml; at day 90 they had a mean concentration of 2625 ng/mL. At days 120 and 180, patients had a mean concentration of imatinib, respectively 1265 and 1220 ng/mL. At 270 day, after 3 months of treatment with nilotinib, mean concentration was 2958 ng/mL and at day 360, mean concentration of imatinib was 1180 ng/mL. Optimal concentrations of nilotinib were not reported in the literature, while recent studies showed that imatinib plasma concentrations slightly higher than 1000 ng/mL were associated with cytogenetic and molecular responses optimal. The dosages of imatinib for the GIMEMA 0408 protocol, confirmed that, after a year of treatment with rotating doses of imatinib and nilotinib, imatinib mean concentration was 1180 ng/mL. This information was very encouraging because it has given strength to the best perspective of the nilotinib use: to use this next generation drug not when imatinib has failed, but using it before, in order to avoid treatment failures with imatinib and achieve long-term results better than using a single type of drug...|$|R
