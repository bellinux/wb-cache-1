25|$|Critics {{argued that}} some {{politicians}} supporting the War on Terror {{are motivated by}} reasons other than those they publicly state. Others accuse those politicians of cynically misleading the public to achieve their own ends. For instance, {{in the months leading}} up to the invasion of Iraq, President Bush and members of his administration indicated that they possessed information which demonstrated a link between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda. Published reports of the links began in late December 1998. In January 1999, Newsweek magazine published a story <b>about</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein and al-Qaeda joining forces to attack U.S. interests in the Gulf Region. ABC News broadcast a story of this link soon after. Polls suggested that a majority of Americans believed that Saddam Hussein was linked to the attacks of September 11, 2001. However, despite shifting public opinion, the Bush Administration believed that there was the possibility of a potential collaboration between al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath regime following the U.S. led invasion of Afghanistan.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{influenced}} by the 1963 novel The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, written by John le Carré. Both the book and author are favorites of Shiban. Because the Cold War had been over, he used the opportunity to introduce a new [...] "bogeyman", in this case domestic terrorism. The writing staff used then-recent fears <b>about</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein's alleged production of biological weapons to craft the basic premise of the script. The title is also a reference to the Pine Bluff Arsenal, a real military base with stockpiles of chemical weapons. Shiban also recalled that the 1995 action film Heat was an inspiration.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Postwar Findings" [...] report had the {{following}} conclusions <b>about</b> <b>Saddam's</b> alleged links to al-Qaeda: ...|$|R
5000|$|He asserts about Bush {{administration}} {{reports of}} weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, [...] "Powell was not duped or misled by anybody, nor did he lie <b>about</b> <b>Saddam's</b> suspected WMD stockpiles. The President did not lie. The Vice President did not lie... the far less dramatic truth is that we were wrong." ...|$|R
50|$|News {{outlets in}} mid-2000-2002 carried {{articles}} <b>about</b> <b>Saddam's</b> efforts to sell oil on markets exclusively in Euros. This {{may have been}} viewed as a push to influence other OPEC states to challenge the reserve currency status in oil trading of the USD. This {{may have been an}} unacceptable outcome in the global economy with respect to the flow of petrodollars throughout the region.|$|R
2500|$|On September 30, 2002, Ward {{appeared}} on CNN with Wolf Blitzer and discussed possible {{military action against}} Iraq. He commented <b>about</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein: [...] "Hussein has not shown any threat to anyone" [...] and that the [...] "Kurds were prospering {{very well in the}} north even as al-Qaeda has used some of their connections with the Kurds." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "And, of course, {{sophisticated}} {{delivery systems}} aren't {{required for a}} chemical or biological attack; all that might be required are a small container and one terrorist or Iraqi intelligence operative to deliver it. And that {{is the source of}} our urgent concern <b>about</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein's links to international terrorist groups. Over the years, Iraq has provided safe haven to terrorists such as Abu Nidal, whose terror organization carried out more than 90 terrorist attacks in 20 countries that killed or injured nearly 900 people, including 12 Americans. Iraq has also provided safe haven to Abu Abbas, who was responsible for seizing the Achille Lauro and killing an American passenger. And we know that Iraq is continuing to finance terror and gives assistance to groups that use terrorism to undermine Middle East peace." ...|$|E
5000|$|This {{claim is}} however disputed. Dr Ala Bashir, Saddam Hussein's former {{personal}} physician, stated, [...] "The stories <b>about</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein having body doubles, {{to foster the}} impression that the Iraqi dictator was everywhere, are nonsense." ...|$|E
2500|$|As one U.S. Muslim {{observer}} noted: [...] "People forgot <b>about</b> <b>Saddam's</b> {{record and}} concentrated on America... Saddam Hussein might be wrong, {{but it is not}} America who should correct him." [...] A shift was, therefore, clearly visible among many Islamic movements in the post war period [...] "from an initial Islamic ideological rejection of Saddam Hussein, the secular persecutor of Islamic movements, and his invasion of Kuwait to a more populist Arab nationalist, anti-imperialist support for Saddam (or more precisely those issues he represented or championed) and the condemnation of foreign intervention and occupation." ...|$|R
50|$|There {{were reports}} of copycat deaths {{influenced}} by the media coverage. Scott Buras, a 10-year-old boy in Webster, Texas, United States, hanged himself in his bedroom. His mother stated that the boy had previously watched a news report <b>about</b> <b>Saddam's</b> execution and decided to hang himself {{as a form of}} experimentation. In Multan, Pakistan, a 9-year-old boy also died apparently copying the televised execution; his 10-year-old sister assisted with the hanging. A 15-year-old girl from Kolkata, India was reported to have hanged herself after becoming extremely depressed by watching the execution. Copycat hangings are blamed for the deaths of seven people worldwide.|$|R
50|$|Another {{argument}} against the Afghanistan invasion was that war would bring unnecessary suffering {{on the people of}} Afghanistan and that it was not {{the most effective way to}} dislodge or isolate al-Qaida: that in fact it would inflate their importance and gain them recruits. Similarly, in the case of the later invasion of Iraq, many felt that Iraq was not a threat to the United States and that a preemptive attack was morally wrong though Saddaam Hussein was widely seen as a violent dictator. Many people condemned the latter war because they doubted U.S. and other claims <b>about</b> <b>Saddam's</b> relation to al-Qaida, about his possession of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs), and about the effectiveness of war as a means of containing WMDs, or because of the lack of United Nations support for war.|$|R

50|$|Although Smith {{was opposed}} to the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, disputing the false claims <b>about</b> the <b>Saddam</b> Hussein regimes {{possession}} of Weapon of mass destruction, she has taken a different view during the Syrian civil war. As {{a consequence of the}} Syrian refugee crisis, and the 2013 Ghouta attacks using chemical weapons, she has called for military invention.|$|R
2500|$|Rumsfeld {{wrote in}} Known and Unknown, [...] "Much {{has been written}} about the Bush administration's focus on Iraq after 9/11. Commentators have {{suggested}} that it was strange or obsessive for the President and his advisers to have raised questions <b>about</b> whether <b>Saddam</b> Hussein was somehow behind the attack. I have never understood the controversy. I had no idea if Iraq was or was not involved, but it would have been irresponsible for any administration not to have asked the question." ...|$|R
25|$|His mother remarried, and Saddam gained three half-brothers {{through this}} marriage. His stepfather, Ibrahim al-Hassan, treated Saddam harshly after his return. At <b>about</b> age 10, <b>Saddam</b> fled {{the family and}} {{returned}} to live in Baghdad with his uncle Kharaillah Talfah. Talfah, the father of Saddam's future wife, was a devout Sunni Muslim and {{a veteran of the}} 1941 Anglo-Iraqi War between Iraqi nationalists and the United Kingdom, which remained a major colonial power in the region.|$|R
50|$|The spokesman, Major Michael Shavers, said Saddam, {{captured}} by US troops in December, {{was entitled to}} all the rights under the Geneva Conventions.

5000|$|During the Baathist Iraq era, {{students}} {{were required to}} take courses on Saddam Hussein. The classes <b>about</b> <b>Saddam</b> ended after the 2003 invasion of Iraq. As of 2005 the school still accepted the top students in Baghdad. Dexter Filkins of The New York Times stated [...] "Today, Baghdad College is becoming more its old self."

40|$|Given earlier polling reports, it was {{predicted}} that (a) a majority of Canadian subjects would support the U. S. military intervention in the Gulf crisis and (b), following Tetlock's (1983) accountability-to-skeptical-audience hypothesis, these subjects would display lower levels of integrative complexity in reasoning about the causes of the Gulf War than subjects who indicated opposition to the U. S action. As expected, a significantly greater proportion of subjects (70 %) indicated support for the U. S. action, and these subjects did in fact have significantly lower integrative complexity levels than subjects who indicated opposition to the U. S. action. Relations between attitudes toward U. S. military involvement, confidence in attributions about the primary cause of the war, and internality-externality of attributions <b>about</b> either <b>Saddam</b> Hussein, George Bush, Iraq, or the U. S. were also explored. Implications for theory and for future research are discussed...|$|R
2500|$|In 2002, Goldberg's [...] "The Great Terror" [...] {{published}} in The New Yorker {{argued that the}} threat posed to America by Saddam Hussein was significant, discussing the possible connection between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda {{as well as the}} Iraqi nuclear program, averring that there was [...] "some debate among arms-control experts <b>about</b> exactly when <b>Saddam</b> will have nuclear capabilities. But there is no disagreement that Iraq, if unchecked, will have them soon... There is little doubt what Saddam might do with an atomic bomb or with his stocks of biological and chemical weapons." ...|$|R
50|$|Saddam's new {{marriage}} to Samira leaves Uday fearful that the couple's presumptive children will jeopardize {{his status as}} Saddam's heir. Uday confronts Kamel Hana at a late-night party and beats him to death to the horror of witnesses. After having Uday arrested, Saddam ponders on killing his first-born son in his cell. Adnan questions Uday's abilities as Iraq's future leader, but is not supported by Hussein Kamel, who continues to gain Saddam's trust. Not long after, Adnan is killed in a suspicious helicopter explosion. Sajida confronts <b>Saddam</b> <b>about</b> her brother's death, but he dismisses her with claims that it was merely an accident.|$|R
5000|$|Ba'athist Iraq under Saddam Hussein pursued ethnic {{cleansing}} or the liquidation of minorities, pursued expansionist wars against Iran and Kuwait, and gradually replaced pan-Arabism with an Iraqi nationalism that emphasized Iraq's {{connection to the}} glories of ancient Mesopotamian empires, including Babylonia. Historian on fascism Stanley Payne has said <b>about</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein's regime: [...] "There will probably never again be a reproduction of the Third Reich, but Saddam Hussein has come closer than any other dictator since 1945".|$|E

500|$|The episode {{begins with}} an {{announcement}} that viewers have waited for weeks for {{the answer to the}} mystery [...] "Who Is Cartman's Father", but then points out that the answer will not be revealed in this episode; instead, there is a presentation of Not Without My Anus starring Terrance and Phillip. A caption wishes the viewers a happy April Fools' Day. The drama itself opens in a courtroom in Canada, with Terrance on trial for the murder of a local doctor; Phillip is his lawyer while Terrance and Phillip's sworn nemesis, Scott, who has had a long hatred of the duo's toilet humour, is acting as the prosecutor. Scott uses a group of seemingly airtight exhibits to prove Terrance's guilt, while Terrance's defense consists of nothing but a long string of fart jokes. Ultimately, the jury returns a verdict of not guilty. Angered, Scott promises vengeance. He is ultimately approached by Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, proposing a deal: Saddam would assist in getting Terrance and Phillip out of Canada, in exchange for Scott assisting Saddam and his Iraqi associates into Canada. Scott is apprehensive <b>about</b> trusting <b>Saddam,</b> but agrees to the deal. The pair then conspires to kidnap Sally, daughter of Terrance and Celine Dion, and hold her hostage, as bait to lure Terrance and Phillip to Tehran; Saddam's soldiers would then murder Terrance and Phillip on arrival.|$|R
5000|$|In August, the CIA {{finished}} another {{assessment of}} the question of Saddam's links to al-Qaeda. This assessment had been requested by the office of the Vice President, who asked specifically that the CIA take another look at the possibility that Jordanian terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi constituted a link between Saddam and al-Qaeda, as Colin Powell had claimed in his speech to the United Nations Security Council. The assessment concluded that {{there was no evidence that}} Saddam Hussein's regime harbored Jordanian terrorist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. A U.S. official familiar with the new CIA assessment said intelligence analysts were unable to determine conclusively the nature of the relationship between al-Zarqawi and Saddam. [...] "It's still being worked," [...] he said. [...] "It (the assessment) ... doesn't make clear-cut, bottom-line judgments" [...] <b>about</b> whether <b>Saddam's</b> regime was aiding al-Zarqawi. The official told Knight Ridder [...] "What is indisputable is that Zarqawi was operating out of Baghdad and was involved in a lot of bad activities," [...] but that the report didn't conclude that Saddam's regime had provided [...] "aid, comfort and succor" [...] to al-Zarqawi. According to Knight Ridder, [...] "Some officials believe that Saddam's secular regime kept an eye on al-Zarqawi, but didn't actively assist him." [...] Knight Ridder reporters called the CIA study [...] "the latest assessment that calls into question one of President Bush's key justifications for last year's U.S.-led invasion of Iraq." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2000, Thompson {{was living}} with then-boyfriend French documentarian Joel Soler in Hollywood. Soler had smuggled footage out of Iraq to make an E! News-style satiric {{political}} documentary comedy, Uncle <b>Saddam,</b> <b>about</b> the strange eccentricities in the home life of Saddam Hussein and his family which bubbled behind Hussein’s dictatorial façade. Thompson wrote the narration for the movie, which was read by actor Wallace Langham. Following the movie, Thompson and Soler’s home was under surveillance by a terrorist group in West Hollywood, who eventually firebombed the couple on November 1, 2000. Thompson has discussed this incident in interviews with Jesse Brown of CANADALAND and fellow Canadian comic Elvira Kurt as being inspiration for his future show The Lowest Show on Earth. In the interview with Kurt, {{he says of the}} attack, “We were sleeping and a group came to our home. They filled our giant garbage cans with gasoline and set them on fire on our front lawn. They had buckets of red paint. They covered the house with it so it dripped off like blood. They put a note in the front hall that said, “In the name of Allah, the merciful and compassionate, burn this Satanic film or you will be dead.” They underlined “dead” just in case we weren’t freaked out enough.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Gerald and Linda Polley {{created a}} body of work {{including}} songs, drawings and short animations, some of which they claimed was made while channelling the spirits of dead artists. Some of this work is political in nature: [...] "Hussein's Butt Song", allegedly written by the spirit of John Lennon <b>about</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein, has lyrics such as [...] "we kicked his butt before and we kicked his butt again, we got him in the heine, he knew he could not win". Another song, attacking Hillary Clinton and cross-dressing, contains the lyrics [...] "if you want your sons wearing skirts and panty hose, with lipstick on their faces and shiny nail polish that glows, then vote for Hillary".|$|E

In addition to his art he has given lectures <b>about</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein's regime and was interviewed by the History Channel. Wafaa's brother was killed by a U.S. missile strike at a checkpoint in 2004, something which deepened his condemnation of the Iraqi War.

The duo return Sally to her home, where Saddam has now taken control. Celine, Terrance's now ex-wife, is dating, and has become pregnant by a friend of the duo named Ugly Bob. While the couple discuss their relationship, Saddam interrupts and takes them hostage, with Celine having planned to sing at a Canadian football game. Scott has also become worried about the presence of the Iraqi soldiers in Canada, but becomes infuriated when he finds that Terrance and Phillip have returned to Canada safely. He confronts <b>Saddam</b> <b>about</b> the double-cross, but Saddam's armed guards scare him into backing away. It is revealed that Saddam is trying to take over Canada as {{the first step in a}} plan for world domination. Terrance and Phillip arrive at the game. Instead of following a plan set up by Scott to commit suicide by using a bomb, they come up with a new plan and put on gas masks. With brute force, everyone farts a huge gas cloud which kills Saddam and his soldiers. Scott arrives, and is annoyed to find that Terrance and Phillip are still alive. Terrance, Phillip, Celine, and everyone else (excluding Scott) celebrate their freedom with a rendition of [...] "O Canada".
