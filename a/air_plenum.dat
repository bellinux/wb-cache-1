In order to design such ships, hydrodynamics computations are needed. We have extended our boundary element method code, 3 DYNAFS Â©, {{to the study}} of multi-hulls with air plenums and to predict wave resistance {{in the presence of the}} <b>air</b> <b>plenum</b> free surface. We also utilized an Unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (UnRANS) equation solver to study the viscous effects around the hull with an <b>air</b> <b>plenum.</b> We conducted parametric studies on the <b>air</b> <b>plenum</b> and hull form parameters. Through these systematic variations of design parameters, we have established trends of the total resistance, which presented very distinct characteristics depending on the Froude numbers.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this program was the {{characterization}} of the soils beneath the main air ducts connecting the exhaust plenums with the Fan House. The <b>air</b> <b>plenums</b> experienced water intrusion during BGRR operations and after shutdown. The water intrusions were attributed to rainwater leaks into degraded parts {{of the system and}} to internal cooling water system leaks. As part of the overall characterization efforts, a state-of-the-art gaseous perfluorocarbon tracer technology was utilized to characterize leak pathways from the ducts. This in turn suggests what soil regions under or adjacent to the ductwork should be emphasized in the characterization process. Knowledge of where gaseous tracers leak from the ducts yields a conservative picture of where water transport, out of or into, the ducts might have occurred...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} {{interaction}} between the fluidized-bed dynamics and the pressure and flow pulsations from the air-supply system. The interaction has been identified as a key process to understand in order to correctly formulate inlet boundary conditions in numerical modelling of fluidized beds, operated under industrial conditions. The interaction between pressure waves, resulting from bubble activities in the bed, with pressure and flow pulsations from the air-supply system is recognized as a main mechanism that gives rise to formation of a coupled system, consisting of fluidized bed, <b>air</b> <b>plenum,</b> pipe(s), flow control devices and fan. The interaction between the bed and its air-supply system is studied experimentally, analytically and numerically. The experiments have been performed in a 1 / 9 th scale model of the 12 MW Chalmers research boiler and in a larger cold circulating fluidized bed unit. Simultaneous measurements have been carried out of pressure fluctuations in the bed and in the <b>air</b> <b>plenum</b> and of flow fluctuations in the air-supply ducts. In the scale model, bubble dynamics have been measured by an optical probe. The interaction is shown to depend on the configuration of the air-supply system, such as lengths of pipes, characteristics of fluidizing fan and location of flow control devices. A general model of the response of the fluidized bed to disturbances has been formulated, and the information provided by the model with respect to the dynamics of the bed, the bed plus the <b>air</b> <b>plenum,</b> and the bed plus the entire air-supply system, has been investigated. Different modes of bubble flow, responsible for the creation of pressure waves in the bed, have been studied in the time-frequency plane (wavelet analysis), aiming at localizing the phenomena of interest in time. A robust time series analysis method for evaluating and quantifying the bed dynamics (from measurements of fluctuations of pressure in the bed and of local solids concentration) has been obtained. The method is shown to be applicable in cases where, for various reasons, long data records may not be available. A model of the air-supply system has been coupled with three-dimensional numerical simulations of the flow field in the bed and the <b>air</b> <b>plenum.</b> It is shown that the assumption of a spatially uniform inlet condition of the gas flow over the air distributor, assumed in most previous fluidized-bed studies, is not appropriate...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, the NOx {{emissions}} of heavy duty gas turbines have been significantly reduced by introducing lean premixed combustion. However, these flames {{are known to}} be prone to combustion instabilities, which became the key issue of modern gas turbine combustion research. In this paper, investigations of a single model gas turbine burner are presented with special focus on thermo-acoustic eigenmodes of the combustor and the resulting interaction between periodic flow field oscillations and flame front fluctuations. A numerical analysis of the eigenmodes of the combustor rig was preformed and compared to pressure probe measurements. By the numerical analysis Helmholtz mode pressure oscillations were predicted to be present in the <b>air</b> <b>plenum</b> upstream the burner {{as well as in the}} combustion chamber. These oscillation modes could well be confirmed by the analysis of the pressure signals taken at different position within the combustor rig. By these pressure oscillations thermo-acoustic flame instabilities are triggered. Due to a phase lag between the pressure oscillations in the <b>air</b> <b>plenum</b> and those in the combustion chamber, fluctuations of air flow through the burner are induced, which in turn cause fluctuations of the equivalence ratio at the burner exit plane. As result, fluctuations of the heat release rate within the flame are established, which interfere with the acoustics of the rig and, thus, unstable combustion is maintained. The dynamics of the flow field and of the flame was studie...|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of a gas turbine {{is strongly dependent on}} the flow field inside the combustion system. In the primary zone, the air jets can improve the recirculation of hot products promoted by the break-down of the rotating fuel/air mixture exiting from the swirler. This recirculation stabilizes the flame and completes the fuel oxidation. Moreover, the mixing process in the dilution zone allows to obtain the outlet temperature profile maximizing turbine durability. This paper presents an experimental and computational fluid dynamics analysis of both the isothermal and the reactive flow field inside a heavy-duty gas turbine combustor designed to be fed with a mixture of hydrogen and natural gas (up to 100 % of either one). The whole combustor domain comprising the <b>air</b> <b>plenum,</b> the annulus and the hot flow discharge is considered. The study aims at evaluating the capability of a coarse grid CFD model, already validated in previous full-load thermal calculations, in predicting the flow field. An experimental campaign was performed on an isothermal flow test rig to investigate combustion air splitting and the penetration of both primary and dilution air jets. The experimental data are compared with the results of the isothermal flow calculations to complete model validation. Then, reactive numerical simulations are carried out to evaluate the impact of combustion on the flow field and to discuss the influence of the <b>air</b> <b>plenum</b> on the features of the air jets...|$|E

A spectacle blind valve or a circular sliding gate valve is located at the inlet to each of the wind tunnel segments. To conduct a test with one such segment, the associated inlet valve is open, whereas valves at the inlets of the other segments are closed. The research test section, which is employed for the present study, is used as one of the wind tunnel segments. This segment includes a spectacle blind valve, which is followed by a straight inlet duct, a converging/diverging supersonic nozzle, the test section, an exhaust diffuser and plenum, and an exhaust piping system with three independent noise baffles.

Specific concerns regarding exposed LAN cables installed in above-ceiling return <b>air</b> <b>plenums</b> resulted in ASHRAE initiating a research project with the National Research Council Canada to investigate the issue. The project on cable fires in plenums (RP- 1108) includes surveys in North American buildings to determine the type and quantities of cable in return air plenumsand fire scenarios that could potentially ignite the cables. It also includes fire tests performed at three scales: small, medium, and full. This paper provides preliminary results from the project including the building surveys.

The bench-scale tests, which were conducted using a cone calorimeter combined with FTIR gas analysis equipment to measure combustion by-products, are discussed.

Another technique, the convection method, was introduced to domestic dwellings at this time. A metal furnace in the basement, using wood or coal as fuel, would heat <b>air</b> in a <b>plenum</b> which would rise by convection through a series of metal ducts into the rooms of the house above.
