500|$|The flag of Kosovo has a blue background, {{charged with}} a map of Kosovo and six stars. The stars are officially meant to symbolise Kosovo's six major ethnic groups: Albanians, Serbs, Turks, Gorani, Romani (often grouped with the <b>Ashkali</b> and Egyptians) and Bosniaks. Unofficially, the stars are {{sometimes}} said to represent the six regions, which according to Albanian ultra nationalist ideology, make up Greater Albania: Albania, Kosovo, western parts of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, parts of northern Greece, parts of Montenegro and Preševo Valley in southern Serbia. The flag of Kosovo resembles that of Bosnia and Herzegovina in terms of colors and shapes used (white stars and yellow shape of the country on a blue field). The flag is unusual among national flags in using a map as a design element; the Flag of Cyprus is the only other to do so. The ratio of the flag was announced during the contest as 2:3, however {{with the passage of}} a diplomatic protocol law in Kosovo in April 2009, the ratio was set as 1:1.4 (5:7 when put in whole numbers). The colors and construction of the Kosovo flag have not yet been defined; however, an official government document does give the colors of the flag using CMYK. The unofficial RGB values of the flag have been manually extracted since 2009. The use of the Kosovo flag is regulated by the law: [...] "Law on the Use of Kosovo State Symbols". However, the Serbian Government objects {{to the use of the}} Kosovo flag at international meetings and gatherings.|$|E
2500|$|Despite their planned {{integration}} into the Kosovar society and their recognition in the Kosovar constitution, the Romani, <b>Ashkali,</b> and Egyptian communities continue to face many difficulties, such as segregation and discrimination, in housing, education, health, employment and social welfare. Many camps around Kosovo continue to house thousands of Internally Displaced People, {{all of whom are}} from minority groups and communities. Because many of the Roma are believed to have sided with the Serbs during the conflict, taking part in the widespread looting and destruction of Albanian property, Minority Rights Group International report that Romani people encounter hostility by Albanians outside their local areas.|$|E

5000|$|In 1990, an [...] "Egyptian association" [...] {{was formed}} in Ohrid, Macedonia. During the Kosovo War, Albanized Roma were {{displaced}} as refugees in Albania and the Republic of Macedonia. Many <b>Ashkali</b> fought in the Kosovo Liberation Army. Albanized Roma formed the ethnic group <b>Ashkali</b> {{after the end of}} the war in 1999, to show their pro-Albanian stance and distinguish themselves from the Roma, who had been negatively viewed as pro-Serbian during the war. Many Albanized Roma were also sent to refugee camps with other Roma, with whom they did not share the same language and customs. As the majority of Kosovo (or Albanized) Roma, many <b>Ashkali</b> refugees settled in Serbia and Montenegro. The first <b>Ashkali</b> party (Democratic Party of the <b>Ashkali</b> Albanians of Kosovo) {{was formed in}} 2000 under Sabit Rrahmani, who supported Kosovo independence in the name of all <b>Ashkali.</b>|$|E

50|$|After {{the war and}} {{encouraged}} by the international community, the label Romani, <b>Ashkali</b> and Kosovo Egyptians and its abbreviation RAE became more common. Whereas the <b>Ashkali</b> and Kosovo Egyptians assert their distinct origin, this is sometimes contested by Kosovo Romani who claim that all three groups are actually Romani subgroups.|$|E
