5|$|In the 2006 census, {{over five}} million Canadians {{identified}} themselves {{as a member of}} <b>a</b> <b>visible</b> minority. Together, they make up 16.2% of the total population: most numerous among these are South Asian (4.0%), Black (2.5%), and Filipino (1.1%). Indigenous peoples are not considered <b>a</b> <b>visible</b> minority under the Employment Equity Act, and this is the definition that Statistics Canada also uses.|$|E

50|$|A nation {{may have}} <b>a</b> <b>visibles</b> balance surplus but {{this can be}} offset by a larger deficit in the {{invisibles}} balance (creating a Balance of Trade deficit overall) - if, for example, there are large payments made to foreign businesses for invisibles such as shipping or tourism. On the other hand, <b>a</b> <b>Visibles</b> Balance deficit can be offset by a strong surplus on the invisibles balance if, for example, foreign aid is being provided.|$|R
40|$|In {{low light}} environment, {{photographs}} {{taken with a}} high ISO setting suffer from significant noise. In this paper, we propose to use a near infrared (NIR) flash image, instead of <b>a</b> normal <b>visible</b> flash image, to enhance its corresponding noisy visible image. We build a hybrid camera system to take <b>an</b> <b>visible</b> image and its NIR counterpart simultaneously. We introduce a new method to denoise <b>an</b> <b>visible</b> image and enhance its details using its corresponding NIR flash image. Experimental results show the superiority of our method compared with previous image denoising and detail enhancement methods.

5|$|A tornado is not {{necessarily}} visible; however, the intense low pressure caused by the high wind speeds (as described by Bernoulli's principle) and rapid rotation (due to cyclostrophic balance) usually cause water vapor {{in the air to}} condense into cloud droplets due to adiabatic cooling. This results in the formation of <b>a</b> <b>visible</b> funnel cloud or condensation funnel.|$|E
5|$|Also defined herewith: orbital ring. <b>A</b> <b>visible</b> ring of {{feathers}} around a bird's eye; the eye-ring is often paler than the surrounding feathers. By contrast, an orbital ring is bare skin ringing the eye. In some species, such as little ringed plover, the orbital ring {{may be quite}} conspicuous.|$|E
5|$|An ultra diffuse galaxy (UDG) is an extremely-low-density galaxy. The galaxy may be {{the same}} size as the Milky Way but has <b>a</b> <b>visible</b> star count of only 1% of the Milky Way. The lack of {{luminosity}} is because there is a lack of star-forming gas in the galaxy which results in old stellar populations.|$|E

30|$|It {{is worth}} noting that the above method does not require <b>a</b> {{complete}} <b>visible</b> circle and <b>a</b> partial circle works too. For example, in Fig.  2, one can see that only a partial landmark of <b>a</b> circle is <b>visible</b> in the image and this allows camera calibration using the proposed method in [24]. However, one should note that <b>a</b> complete <b>visible</b> circle (if available) may have better accuracy for camera calibration [24].|$|R
5|$|Anthropologists {{speculate}} that the functional significance of long head hair may be adornment, a by-product of secondary natural selection once other androgenic/somatic hair (body hair) had largely been lost. Another possibility is that long head hair {{is a result of}} Fisherian runaway sexual selection, where long lustrous hair is <b>a</b> <b>visible</b> marker for a healthy individual. For some groups or individuals, however, short hair is the selected trait.|$|E
5|$|Arranging a sleep {{environment}} that is quiet, very dark, and cool is recommended. Noises, light, and uncomfortable temperatures {{have been shown to}} disrupt continuous sleep. Other recommendations that are frequently made, though less studied, include selecting comfortable mattresses, bedding, and pillows, and eliminating <b>a</b> <b>visible</b> bedroom clock, to prevent focusing on time passing when trying to fall asleep.|$|E
5|$|Beyond {{the main}} bailey walls lies the stable block, now ruined but with <b>a</b> <b>visible</b> cobble floor. The stables {{and the north}} and west sides of the castle were {{protected}} by another, smaller curtain wall, but this is now largely ruined. Accounts suggest that the original stables could hold around 60horses, although by the 17th century they had been expanded to accommodate more.|$|E

5|$|The bulk {{properties}} of astatine {{are not known}} with any certainty. Research is limited by its short half-life, which prevents the creation of weighable quantities. <b>A</b> <b>visible</b> piece of astatine would immediately vaporize itself because of the heat generated by its intense radioactivity. It {{remains to be seen}} if, with sufficient cooling, a macroscopic quantity of astatine could be deposited as a thin film. Astatine is usually classified as either a nonmetal or a metalloid; metal formation has also been predicted.|$|E

However, despite the personal unification of the territory, the division between Kalisz and Gniezno persisted almost {{to the end of the}} 18th century. Later, in times of Casimir III the Great, there was also <b>a</b> <b>visible</b> division between the old voivodeships of Poznań and Kalisz.|$|E

5|$|A comet is an icy small Solar System body that, when passing {{close to}} the Sun, warms and begins to release gases, a process called outgassing. This {{produces}} <b>a</b> <b>visible</b> atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a tail. These phenomena are due {{to the effects of}} solar radiation and the solar wind acting upon the nucleus of the comet. Comet nuclei range from a few hundred metres to tens of kilometres across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. The coma may be up to 15 times the Earth's diameter, while the tail may stretch one astronomical unit. If sufficiently bright, a comet may be seen from the Earth without the aid of a telescope and may subtend an arc of 30° (60 Moons) across the sky. Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many cultures.|$|E
5|$|As the mesocyclone lowers {{below the}} cloud base, {{it begins to}} take in cool, moist air from the {{downdraft}} region of the storm. The convergence of warm air in the updraft and cool air causes a rotating wall cloud to form. The RFD also focuses the mesocyclone's base, causing it to draw air from a smaller and smaller area on the ground. As the updraft intensifies, it creates an {{area of low pressure}} at the surface. This pulls the focused mesocyclone down, in the form of <b>a</b> <b>visible</b> condensation funnel. As the funnel descends, the RFD also reaches the ground, fanning outward and creating a gust front that can cause severe damage a considerable distance from the tornado. Usually, the funnel cloud begins causing damage on the ground (becoming a tornado) within a few minutes of the RFD reaching the ground.|$|E
5|$|Avoiding {{stereotypes}} and labeling {{based on personal}} dress, the program uses polo shirts, t-shirts, and other articles of clothing like neckerchiefs as uniforms. Participants uniforms display the White Stag logo, which is <b>a</b> <b>visible</b> reminder of the program's founding vision articulated by Baden-Powell {{at the conclusion of}} the 1933 World Jamboree. The uniform reminds the individual wearing it of their commitment to the program's values. It instills self-esteem in the person and pride in the program. It eliminates class and socio-economic distinctions. Wearing a uniform improves member's behavior and lessens the impact on a person's personal wardrobe.|$|E
