In Veracruz, best known “African” dances include Los Negritos, along with various huapangos and sons. In the Costa Chica, the best known of these dances include Los Diablos, Las Tortugas and Toro de Petate.|$|E

25|$|Claims are {{sometimes}} made that Leonardo da Vinci was an alchemist. He was {{trained in the}} workshop of Verrocchio, who according to Vasari, was an able alchemist. Leonardo was a chemist in so much as that he experimented with different media for suspending paint pigment. In the painting of murals, his experiments resulted in notorious failures with the Last Supper deteriorating within a century, and the Battle of Anghiari running off the wall.

25|$|By {{the end of}} the 1970s, General Hospital {{was facing}} dire ratings when {{executive}} producer Gloria Monty was brought in to turn the show around. Monty is credited with creation of the first supercouple, Luke Spencer and Laura Webber, played by Anthony Geary and Genie Francis. The end of their hour wedding on November 17, 1981, was the most-watched event in daytime serial history. During the 1980s, the series featured several high-profile action, adventure, and some science fiction-based storylines. Location shooting at sites including Mount Rushmore in South Dakota; Niagara Falls; Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, Tennessee; Atlantic City, New Jersey; Big Bear and Avalon (Catalina Island), California; and San Antonio, Texas <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>that</b> propelled the story.|$|E
25|$|Breeds as we {{know them}} today did not exist before Victorian times, but local {{variations}} of the ancestors of current breeds came into America along with their owners and livestock. Included <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>that</b> are now extinct or that have merged into other breeds. These may have included some British herding dogs, native dogs from North America (originating in Asia/Siberia), as well as dogs from Germany and Spain including the Carea Leonés. For many centuries, shepherds were more interested in dogs' working abilities than their appearance. As a result, over time, shepherds interbred dogs that they believed would produce better workers for the given climate and landscape. In the eastern U.S., terrain and weather conditions were similar to that of Europe, so the existing imported breeds and their offspring worked well there.|$|E

500|$|The most {{commonly}} accepted definition of international emergency medicine {{is that it}} is [...] "the area of emergency medicine concerned with the development of emergency medicine in other countries." [...] In that definition, [...] "other countries" [...] refers to nations that do not have a mature emergency care system (exemplified by board-certified emergency physicians and academic emergency medicine, among other things). Included in those nations <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>that</b> are otherwise quite developed but lack a complete emergency medical system, such as Armenia, China, Israel, Nicaragua, and the Philippines. Work in international emergency medicine can be broken down into two main categories: 1) the promotion of emergency medicine as a recognized and established specialty in other countries, and 2) the provision of humanitarian assistance.|$|E
500|$|Marvel Studios co-president Louis D’Esposito later {{stated that}} Marvel was {{considering}} {{the idea of}} introducing established characters who may not yet be ready to carry their own feature films in future One-Shots, stating, [...] "There’s always a potential to introduce a character.

[...] When asked whether a Marvel superhero would ever appear in a One-Shot, D'Esposito replied that [...] "We would love to, but it’s difficult because there’s a cost to that.

Bevin also called {{for the elimination of}} many of Kentucky's $10 billion in [...] "tax expenditures", which he called [...] "Frankfort-speak for loopholes". Asked to specify which expenditures he would eliminate, Bevin said, [...] "I'm {{not going to give you}} specifics at this point in time.

500|$|In August 2011, Marvel {{announced}} {{a series of}} direct-to-video short films called Marvel One-Shots, the name derived from the label used by Marvel Comics for their one-shot comics. Co-producer Brad Winderbaum said [...] "It's a fun way to experiment with new characters and ideas, but more importantly it's a {{way for us to}} expand the Marvel Cinematic Universe and tell stories that live outside the plot of our features." [...] Each short film is designed to be a self-contained story that provides more backstory for characters or events introduced in the films. In July 2012, D'Esposito stated that Marvel was considering the idea of introducing established characters who may not yet be ready to carry their own feature films in future One-Shots, stating, [...] "There's always a potential to introduce a character.

2500|$|In September, Opposition and Commonwealth Liberal Party leader Joseph Cook {{addressed}} {{parliament in}} support of conscription: [...] "There <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>that</b> {{do not believe in}} the compulsion of men, who say that Australia has done enough ... I hope there are few men in the parliament who believe that ... We are proud of what the Empire has done, and our contribution must be adequate, and in every way worthy of that effort ... To [...] now would be a national sin, a national calamity. As opposition leader, Cook had opposed almost no government measures throughout 1916, and Hughes and his faction were becoming increasingly distant from the bulk of the ALP and aligning much more with the conservative opposition. When the second reading of the Military Service Referendum bill was moved, it carried 46 to 10 in the House and 19 to 9 in the Senate. In neither house did any member of the opposition vote against the bill [...] the against vote came entirely from Labor detractors. [...] Upon the second moving of the Referendum Bill, Frank Tudor resigned from Hughes' cabinet. A group of 15 representatives and 12 senators, led by Frank Brennan and Myles Ferricks, opposed the bill at every stage {{on the grounds that it}} was a question of conscience on which no majority, no matter how large, had a right to impose its will on the minority. Hughes stared down his enemies within the party and committed himself fully to the campaign: [...] "For myself, I say that I am going into this referendum campaign as if it were the only thing for which I lived." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{three main}} {{vegetation}} classifications are low-height rainforest, medium-height rainforest (as per {{the size of}} the trees), pine-oak forest and meadows. Medium-height deciduous rainforest is mostly located {{on either side of the}} canyon, in the north and east of the part towards San Fernando and in the Cañada Muñiz at altitudes of between 150 and 1250 masl. It is mostly found in areas with basalt or granite rock and where there are lime deposits, covering an area of [...] in total. While many plants here loose leaves in the dry season, there <b>are</b> <b>some</b> <b>that</b> retain them year-round. Maximum height of trees varies between 25 and 30 meters. The density of the tree cover in these areas is enough to lower temperatures on the ground in the summer rainy season due to the maximum foliage which occurs at this time. The tree cover is composed of the following species: breadnut (Brosimum alicastrum), guanacaste (Enterolobium cyclocarpum), totoposte (Licania arbórea), jocotillo (Astronium graveolens), cedar (Cedrela odorata), cuaulote blanco (Luehea candida), hormiguillo (Platymiscium dimorphandrum), chicozapote (Manilkara zapota), tempisque (Mastichodendron capiri) and various types of amate fig trees (Ficus spp.). Under the tree cover, there is significant plant diversity, including palms and araceas. Epiphytes (air plants) are abundant as well, along with orchids, Bromeliaceae and cactus. Cactus are primarily found on the vertical walls of the canyon and belong to the Acanthocereus family. In the 1970s, tree area in a good state of conservation amounted to , or 17.72% of the total land area. From 1988 to 1993, this amount was reduced to , or 5.35%. From 1990 to 2000, it is estimated that eight percent of the remaining forests and 38% of the rainforests were damaged. Many of the areas in good condition are broken up by disturbed areas. Most of the damage is due to illegal logging and the clearing of land for pasture or agriculture. Medium-height perennial rainforest (also known as evergreen cloud forest) exists only in small dispersed patches, mostly on the sides of the canyon in contact with the Grijalva River. Many of these patches are less than one hectare in size, as they are located on small areas of flat land at altitudes between 1000 and 2,500 masl. The soils are rich in undecomposed plant matter which holds in moisture.|$|E
