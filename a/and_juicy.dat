25|$|Many {{hectares}} {{are grown}} organically {{and have been}} certified as organic for decades. The Maule Valley produces good value everyday wines of quality that has been improving over the years. There are also old-bush, dry-farmed vineyards that produce naturally balanced field blends of Carignan, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, and other yet to be identified varieties. Newer plantations include Merlot, Cabernet Franc, and Carmenere with bright acidity <b>and</b> <b>juicy</b> fruit notes.|$|E
25|$|The Malbec grape is a thin-skinned grape {{and needs}} more sun and heat than either Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot to mature. It ripens mid-season and can bring very deep color, ample tannin, and a {{particular}} plum-like flavor component to add complexity to claret blends. Sometimes, especially in its traditional growing regions, {{it is not}} trellised and cultivated as bush vines (the goblet system). Here it is sometimes kept to a relatively low yield of about 6tons per hectare. The wines are rich, dark <b>and</b> <b>juicy.</b>|$|E

25|$|The golden {{trevally}} is commonly targeted by both anglers and spearfishermen, {{and is considered}} to be a gamefish. Golden trevally will take a variety of baits and lures and may be caught from both the shore and boats, making it a highly accessible species. Baits commonly employed for {{golden trevally}} include prawns and a variety of small fish or cut baits. The fish are known to follow a burley stream right up to the back of a boat, allowing for easy capture on unweighted baits. A variety of lures may be employed when targeting the species, including jigs, poppers, spoons, slices, and minnows, with large minnows trolled around reefs often accounting for larger specimens. The use of saltwater fly fishing to specifically target golden trevally has developed in recent years, especially over shallow, sandy flats. In these cases, a sinking line and leader is employed to not spook the fish in these shallow waters. Once hooked, golden trevally are known for fast runs and hard fights, especially when reef or other structures are present. Golden trevally are considered one of the best members of the trevally family for eating, with bleeding recommended. The fish has slightly translucent, dark-pink flesh while fresh, becoming white <b>and</b> <b>juicy</b> during cooking, although has a tendency to become dry, flaky, and fibrous. A rich, tangy fish flavour is noted.|$|E
