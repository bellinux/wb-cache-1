5|$|In addition, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the GRC scheme merely provides <b>an</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> a united, multiracial Parliament. In fact, minority representatives are required to vote according to their party line; they are not allowed to vote specifically in the interests of their racial groups. The multiracial element in Parliament has been artificially imposed by way of a racial quota to ensure that the minorities are represented.|$|E
5|$|In the Introduction, Off {{explains}} the animal metaphors. Roméo Dallaire is the 'lion' because he acted courageously with <b>an</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> control and confidence. Lewis MacKenzie {{compared to a}} 'fox' because while he made a brave and dramatic defense of the airport, and was trusted by outside observers, his actions in recommending against intervention {{were based on the}} cunning logic that all sides were, at least, partly responsible for the conflict. Louise Arbour is portrayed as the 'eagle' for her pursuit of justice and her use of surprise SWAT-like arrests.|$|E
5|$|The sculpture's roughly cubical {{arrangement}} cleverly {{ensures that}} the overall composition retains a harmonious equilibrium. It is lightened by the artist dispensing with a back slab and incorporating negative space into the piece. By putting {{the children in the}} place of Seneb's legs, the artist adds to the sense of symmetry. He creates the same impression that would have been made by an ordinary seated figure, preserving <b>an</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> normality without disguising Seneb's unusual physique. The family's names and titles are given in inscriptions placed {{on either side of the}} children and on the horizontal face of the base.|$|E

5|$|In October 1886 Britain {{declared}} the Line {{to be the}} provisional frontier of British Guiana, and in February 1887 Venezuela severed diplomatic relations. Proposals for a renewal of relations and settlement of the dispute failed repeatedly, and by summer 1894, diplomatic relations had been severed for seven years, the dispute having dragged on for half a century. In addition, both sides had established police or military stations at key points in the area, partly to defend claims to the Caratal goldfield of the region's Yuruari basin, which was within Venezuelan territory but claimed by the British. The mine at El Callao, started in 1871, was for a time {{one of the richest}} in the world, and the goldfields as a whole saw over a million ounces exported between 1860 and 1883. The gold mining was dominated by immigrants from the British Isles and the British West Indies, giving <b>an</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> almost creating an English colony on Venezuelan territory.|$|E
5|$|It {{was found}} that Choor Singh had two private {{contacts}} with a material witness {{in the course of}} the disciplinary proceedings, even though it is a well-established rule that a decision-maker should not have contact with any party to the proceedings or any of his witnesses in the absence of the other party or his counsel. The High Court found that there was no actual bias, but there was evidence on which reasonable people might believe that Choor Singh might or could not bring an unprejudiced mind to the disciplinary inquiry. The key finding was that the two private contacts with the material witness gave <b>an</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> a real likelihood of bias. On this basis, the High Court gave the order and quashed the finding of the disciplinary committee. The case was reported as Re Singh Kalpanath (1992).|$|E
5|$|Unwilling {{to let the}} Dutch {{take his}} son, Notokusumo, then laying siege to Semarang, made a fake attack against the Chinese, in which the sick or injured were sacrificed while the healthy were allowed to escape, {{in order to give}} <b>an</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> loyalty. He then went to Kartosuro to attempt to rescue his son, but was told to clear a path to Demak by the Dutch {{officials}} there. After stalling, Notokusumo agreed to do so, first travelling to Semarang. However, upon his arrival in Semarang he was arrested by the new chief of the army, Hugo Verijsel, with 's blessing. Verijsel then took 300 Dutch soldiers and 500 natives to clear the area around Kartosuro, but was stopped in Salatiga when he and his troops came under attack from the armies of three temenggung; Verijsel retreated to Ampel.|$|E

5|$|At ambient conditions, {{americium}} {{is present}} in its most stable α form which has a hexagonal crystal symmetry, and a space group P63/mmc with lattice parameters a= 346.8pm and c= 1124pm, and four atoms per unit cell. The crystal consists of a double-hexagonal close packing with the layer sequence ABAC and so is isotypic with α-lanthanum and several actinides such as α-curium. The crystal structure of americium changes with pressure and temperature. When compressed at room temperature to 5 GPa, α-Am transforms to the β modification, which has a face-centered cubic (fcc) symmetry, space group Fmm and lattice constant a= 489pm. This fcc structure {{is equivalent to the}} closest packing with the sequence ABC. Upon further compression to 23 GPa, americium transforms to an orthorhombic γ-Am structure similar to that of α-uranium. There are no further transitions observed up to 52 GPa, except for <b>an</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> a monoclinic phase at pressures between 10 and 15 GPa. There is no consistency on the status of this phase in the literature, which also sometimes lists the α, β and γ phases as I, II and III. The β-γ transition is accompanied by a 6% decrease in the crystal volume; although theory also predicts a significant volume change for the α-β transition, it is not observed experimentally. The pressure of the α-β transition decreases with increasing temperature, and when α-americium is heated at ambient pressure, at 770°C it changes into an fcc phase which is different from β-Am, and at 1075°C it converts to a body-centered cubic structure. The pressure-temperature phase diagram of americium is thus rather similar to those of lanthanum, praseodymium and neodymium.|$|E

25|$|During {{the later}} 1930s, Stalin placed {{limits on the}} {{personality}} cult developing around him, and sought to portray himself with humility, for instance {{through the use of}} self-deprecating humour. This was perhaps for pragmatic reasons, recognising that <b>an</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> modesty would make him more appealing.|$|E

25|$|The Book of Mormon has {{a number}} of {{original}} and distinctive doctrinal discussions on subjects such as the fall of Adam and Eve, the nature of the Atonement, eschatology, redemption from physical and spiritual death, and the organization of the latter-day church. The pivotal event of the book is <b>an</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> Jesus Christ in the Americas shortly after his resurrection.|$|E
25|$|The towers {{stand outside}} {{the width of}} the aisles, but screen two chapels located {{immediately}} behind them. The lower parts of the towers continue the theme of the outer walls, but are differentiated from them in order to create <b>an</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> strength. The windows of the lower storey are smaller than those of the side walls and are deeply recessed, a visual indication of the thickness of the wall. The paired pilasters at each corner project boldly.|$|E
25|$|Some colored {{contact lenses}} {{completely}} cover the iris, thus dramatically changing eye colour. Other colored contact lenses merely tint the iris, highlighting and beautifying its natural colour. A new trend in Japan, South Korea and China is the circle contact lens, which extend {{the appearance of}} the iris onto the sclera by having a dark tinted area all around. The result is <b>an</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> a bigger, wider iris, a look reminiscent of dolls' eyes.|$|E

25|$|It is {{the grain}} of Yule Marble that gives <b>an</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> smooth texture, a {{homogeneous}} look, and a luminous surface that polishes well. These qualities are why it has been chosen {{for a number of}} major national and state landmarks, most notably the Lincoln Memorial. Because of its aesthetic value, architect Henry Bacon successfully urged that it be used to clad the whole exterior of the Memorial, even though it was the most expensive material.|$|E
25|$|Stratigraphic {{sections}} of rock {{from this period}} reveal numerous other changes. Fossil records for many organisms show major turnovers. For example, in the marine realm, a mass extinction of benthic foraminifera, a global expansion of subtropical dinoflagellates, and <b>an</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> excursion, planktic foraminifera and calcareous nanofossils all occurred during the beginning stages of PETM. On land, modern mammal orders (including primates) suddenly appear in Europe and in North America. Sediment deposition changed significantly at many outcrops and in many drill cores spanning this time interval.|$|E
25|$|The main {{internal}} {{space of the}} cathedral is that under the central dome which extends the full width of the nave and aisles. The dome is supported on pendentives rising between eight arches spanning the nave, choir, transepts, and aisles. The eight piers that carry them are not evenly spaced. Wren has maintained <b>an</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> eight equal spans by inserting segmental arches to carry galleries across {{the ends of the}} aisles, and has extended the mouldings of the upper arch to appear equal to the wider arches.|$|E

25|$|The 1870s {{was a time}} of rich {{ornamentation}} and eclecticism in the arts. The {{treatment of}} Gothic canopies which were a feature of so many windows began to change from the brightly coloured, two-dimensional, playful appearance of the 1850s and 60s to <b>an</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> having been carved from fine white limestone. Tudor and Renaissance architectural details made an appearance and were often used without reference {{to the nature of the}} real architecture that enclosed the window. The art of painting canopies in this manner was diligently maintained until after World War I.|$|E
25|$|Stained {{glass windows}} {{are created by}} cutting pieces of {{coloured}} glass to match a drawn template and setting them into place in a mesh of lead cames and supporting the whole with rigid metal bars. Details such as facial features can be painted {{on the surface of}} the glass, and stains of bright yellow applied to enliven white areas. The effect is to add <b>an</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> brilliance and richness to a church interior, while the media lends itself to narratives. If the lead is properly maintained, stained glass is extremely durable and many windows have been in place for centuries.|$|E
25|$|Brown {{increased}} the city's special assistants payroll from US$15.6 to US$45.6million between 1995 and 2001. Between April 29, 2001 and May 3, 2001, San Francisco Chronicle reporters Lance Williams and Chuck Finnie released a five-part story concerning Brown and {{his relations with}} city contractors, lobbyists, and city appointments and hires he had made during his tenure as Mayor. The report {{concluded that there was}} <b>an</b> <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> favoritism and conflicts of interest in the awarding of city contracts and development deals, a perception that large contracts had an undue influence on city hall, and patronage with the hiring of campaign workers, contributors, legislative colleagues, and friends to government positions.|$|E
