40|$|As a {{potential}} building block {{for the next}} generation of devices or multifunctional materials that are spreading almost every technology sector, one-dimensional (1 D) carbon nanomaterial has received intensive research interests. Recently, a new ultra-thin diamond nanothread (DNT) has joined this palette, which is a 1 D structure with poly-benzene sections connected by Stone-Wales (SW) transformation defects. Using large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, we found that this sp 3 bonded DNT can transit from a brittle to a ductile characteristic by varying the length of the poly-benzene sections, suggesting that DNT possesses entirely different mechanical responses than other 1 D carbon <b>allotropies.</b> Analogously, the SW defects behave like a grain boundary that interrupts the consistency of the poly-benzene sections. For a DNT with a fixed length, the yield strength fluctuates in the vicinity of a certain value and is independent of the "grain size". On the other hand, both yield strength and yield strain show a clear dependence on the total length of DNT, which is due to the fact that the failure of the DNT is dominated by the SW defects. Its highly tunable ductility together with its ultra-light density and high Young's modulus makes diamond nanothread ideal for creation of extremely strong three-dimensional nano-architectures.

The time span ranging from the mid- 15 th to {{the early decades of}} the 16 th century is the crucial period in which there is the wide-range spread of the Hodegetria cult between East and West, and during which occurs an iconographic and worship transfer that produces <b>allotropies</b> and variants. It is only after the fall of Constantinople that in the Italian Peninsula and in Sicily appeared, along with the Holy Icon replicas, new ways of representing the Hodegetria: the depiction which set as a standard is the one with two old men (Calogeri) carrying on their shoulders the chest with the Hodegetria, sometimes as an Icon, sometimes as a real body. Because of her specialization as protector against the enemy the Virgin Hodegetria was invoked by all professionals related to the sea and so, during the 16 th century, occurred two transfer phenomena: her identification with Our Lady of Good Way; her specialization as deliverer from the Barbary slavery. It is through these new operational functions that the cult spread beyond the traditional «Byzantine» Southern Italy regions, such as Liguria, Sardinia, the Balearic Islands and the Iberian Peninsula. These new functions entailed new iconographic standards depending on the geographical location and the action of Mendicant Orders (Augustinians, Franciscans, Mercedarians) and confraternities...|$|R

Soft chemical methods such as sol-gel methods and conventional solid state methods were applied for the synthesis of these materials. Aluminum phosphate obtained by a solution method is single phase and belongs to one of the Al(H₂PO₄) ₃ <b>allotropies</b> with hexagonal symmetry. The material is stable up to 200 °C and decomposes into Al(PO₃) ₃ at a higher temperature. The electrical conductivity of pure Al(H₂PO₄) ₃ is on the order of 10 ⁻⁶- 10 ⁻⁷ S/cm, very close to the value for the known proton conductors AlH₃(PO₄) ₂• 3 H₂O and AlH₂P₃O₁₀• 2 H₂O. Much higher conductivity is observed for samples containing even a trace amount of excess H₃PO₄. It is likely that the conduction path gradually changes from grain interior to the surface as the acid content increases. The conductivity of Al(H₂PO₄) ₃- 0. 5 H₃PO₄ exhibited a good stability over the measured 110 hours. Although tin pyrophosphate (SnP₂O₇) has been reported to show a significantly high conductivity (10 ⁻² S/cm) at 250 °C in various atmospheres, we observed large discrepancies in the electrical properties of SnP₂O₇ prepared by different methods. Using an excess amount of phosphorous in the synthetic procedure generally produces SnP₂O₇ with much higher conductivity (several orders of magnitude higher) than samples with stoichiometric Sn:P ratios in their synthetic procedure. Solid state ³¹P NMR confirmed the presence of residual phosphoric acid for samples with excess starting phosphorous. Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) confirmed an amorphous layer covered the SnP₂O₇ granules which was probably phosphoric acid or condensed phases. Thereby, it is quite likely that the high conductivity of SnP₂O₇ results mainly from the contribution of the residual acid. The conductivity of these samples exhibited a good stability over the measured 80 hours. Based on the observations for SnP₂O₇, we developed a nano core-shell structure based on BPO₄ and P₂O₅ synthesised by solid state methods. The particle size of BPO₄ using this method varied between 10 - 20 nm depending on the content of P₂O₅. TEM confirmed the existence of an amorphous layer that is homogeneously distributed.

60|$|NOTE I. For {{the belief}} that the {{so-called}} elements are compound there are both special reasons and general reasons. Among the special may be named the parallelism between <b>allotropy</b> and isomerism; the numerous lines in the spectrum of each element; and the cyclical law of Newlands and Mendeljeff. Of the more general reasons, which, as distinguished from these chemical or chemico-physical ones, may fitly be called cosmical, the following are the chief.|$|E
60|$|And this {{hypothesis}} is entirely {{in harmony with the}} phenomena of <b>allotropy.</b> Various substances, conventionally distinguished as simple, have several forms under which they present quite different properties. The semi-transparent, colourless, extremely active substance called phosphorus may be so changed as to become opaque, dark red, and inert. Like changes are known to occur in some gaseous, non-metallic elements, as oxygen; and also in metallic elements, as antimony. These total changes of properties, brought about without any changes to be called chemical, are interpretable only as due to molecular rearrangements; and, by showing that difference of property is producible by difference of arrangement, they support the inference otherwise to be drawn, that the properties of different elements result from differences of arrangement arising by the compounding and recompounding of ultimate homogeneous units.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Allotropy</b> or allotropism (...) is the {{property}} of some chemical elements to exist in two or more different forms, in the same physical state, known as allotropes of these elements. Allotropes are different structural modifications of an element; the atoms of the element are bonded together in a different manner. For example, the allotropes of carbon include diamond (where the carbon atoms are bonded together in a tetrahedral lattice arrangement), graphite (where the carbon atoms are bonded together in sheets of a hexagonal lattice), graphene (single sheets of graphite), and fullerenes (where the carbon atoms are bonded together in spherical, tubular, or ellipsoidal formations). The term <b>allotropy</b> is used for elements only, not for compounds. The more general term, used for any crystalline material, is polymorphism. <b>Allotropy</b> refers only to different forms of an element within the same phase (i.e. different solid, liquid or gas forms); these different states are not, themselves, considered to be examples of <b>allotropy.</b>|$|E
50|$|The crystal {{structure}} consists of atoms that are grouped {{in a very}} specific arrangement, called a lattice.

50|$|The {{base metal}} iron of the iron-carbon alloy known as steel, {{undergoes}} {{a change in}} the arrangement (<b>allotropy)</b> of the atoms of its crystal matrix at a certain temperature (usually between 1500 F and 1600 F, depending on carbon content). This allows the smaller carbon atoms to enter the interstices of the iron crystal. When this diffusion happens, the carbon atoms are said to be in solution in the iron, forming a particular single, homogeneous, crystalline phase called austenite. If the steel is cooled slowly, the carbon can diffuse out of the iron and it will gradually revert to its low temperature allotrope. During slow cooling, the carbon atoms will no longer be as soluble with the iron, and will be forced to precipitate out of solution, nucleating into a more concentrated form of iron carbide (Fe3C) in the spaces between the pure iron crystals. The steel then becomes heterogeneous, as it is formed of two phases, the iron-carbon phase called cementite (or carbide), and pure iron ferrite. Such a heat treatment produces a steel that is rather soft. If the steel is cooled quickly, however, the carbon atoms will not have time to diffuse and precipitate out as carbide, but will be trapped within the iron crystals. When rapidly cooled, a diffusionless (martensite) transformation occurs, in which the carbon atoms become trapped in solution. This causes the iron crystals to deform as the crystal structure tries to change to its low temperature state, leaving those crystals very hard but much less ductile (more brittle).|$|E
5000|$|Iron {{represents}} {{an example of}} <b>allotropy</b> in a metal. There are at least four allotropic forms of iron, known as α, γ, δ, and ε; at very high pressures and temperatures, some controversial experimental evidence exists for a stable β phase.As molten iron cools past its freezing point of 1538 °C, it crystallizes into its δ allotrope, which has a body-centered cubic (bcc) crystal structure. As it cools further to 1394 °C, it changes to its γ-iron allotrope, a face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal structure, or austenite. At 912 °C and below, the crystal structure again becomes the bcc α-iron allotrope, or ferrite. Finally, at 770 °C (the Curie point, Tc) iron's magnetic ordering changes from paramagnetic to ferromagnetic. As the iron passes through the Curie temperature there is no change in crystalline structure, {{but there is a}} change in [...] "domain structure", where each domain contains iron atoms with a particular electronic spin. In unmagnetized iron, all the electronic spins of the atoms within one domain have the same axis orientation; however, the electrons of neighboring domains have other orientations with the result of mutual cancellation and no magnetic field. In magnetized iron, the electronic spins of the domains are aligned and the magnetic effects are reinforced. Although each domain contains billions of atoms, they are very small, about 10 micrometres across. This happens because the two unpaired electrons on each iron atom are in the dz2 and dx2 − y2 orbitals, which do not point directly at the nearest neighbors in the body-centered cubic lattice and therefore do not participate in metallic bonding; thus, they can interact magnetically with each other so that their spins align.|$|E

Polymorphism is well known in inorganic chemistry, it is relative to the variation of temperature and pressure. In organic chemistry the subject is more delicate because it does not depend only on these two functions, but also the way of preparation of the substance, the nature of the solvent of crystallisation, its rate of evaporation, and for melted compounds, the rate of cooling is also an important factor. In these conditions the study of polymorphism cannot be dissociated of the study of solvates. General knowledge will be presented in this paper, but also some particular cases in which equilibrium is difficult to reach.
