5|$|Siddiqui's first {{breakthrough}} in research {{came when he}} successfully isolated an <b>antiarrhythmic</b> <b>agent</b> in 1931 from the roots of Rauwolfia serpentina. He named the newly discovered chemical compound as Ajmaline, after his mentor Hakim Ajmal Khan {{who was one of}} the illustrious practitioners of Unani system of medicine in South Asia. Later on, Siddiqui also extracted other alkaloids from Rauwolfia serpentina that included Ajmalinine, Ajmalicine (C21H24N2O3), Isoajmaline, Neoajmaline, Serpentine and Serpentinine. Many of these are still used worldwide for treatment of mental disorders and cardiovascular ailments, especially as antiarrhythmic agents in Brugada syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Overdoses with {{lidocaine}} can be {{a result}} of excessive administration by topical or parenteral routes, accidental oral ingestion of topical preparations by children who are more susceptible to overdose, accidental intravenous (rather than subcutaneous, intrathecal, or paracervical) injection, or prolonged use of subcutaneous infiltration anesthesia during cosmetic surgical procedures. These occurrences have often led to severe toxicity or death in both children and adults. Lidocaine and its two major metabolites may be quantified in blood, plasma, or serum to confirm the diagnosis in potential poisoning victims or to assist in the forensic investigation in a case of fatal overdose. It is important in the interpretation of analytical results to recognize that lidocaine is often routinely administered intravenously as an <b>antiarrhythmic</b> <b>agent</b> in critical cardiac-care situations. Treatment with intravenous lipid emulsions (used for parental feeding) to reverse the effects of local anaesthetic toxicity is becoming more commonplace {{than it was in the}} past.|$|E
2500|$|Amiodarone is {{categorized}} {{as a class}} III <b>antiarrhythmic</b> <b>agent,</b> and prolongs phase 3 of the cardiac action potential, the repolarization phase where there is normally decreased calcium permeability and increased potassium permeability. [...] It has numerous other effects, however, including actions {{that are similar to}} those of antiarrhythmic classes Ia, II, and IV.|$|E
50|$|Class Ic <b>antiarrhythmic</b> <b>agents</b> {{markedly}} depress {{the phase}} 0 depolarization (decreasing Vmax). They decrease conductivity, {{but have a}} minimal effect on the action potential duration.

25|$|Many {{attempts}} have been made to classify <b>antiarrhythmic</b> <b>agents.</b> The problem arises from the fact that many of the <b>antiarrhythmic</b> <b>agents</b> have multiple modes of action, making any classification imprecise.|$|R
2500|$|Flecainide acetate ( [...] ) is a class Ic <b>antiarrhythmic</b> <b>agent</b> used {{to prevent}} and treat tachyarrhythmias (abnormal fast rhythms of the heart). [...] It is used to treat a variety of cardiac arrhythmias {{including}} paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (episodic irregular heartbeat originating in the upper chamber of the heart), paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (episodic rapid but regular heartbeat originating in the atrium), and ventricular tachycardia (rapid rhythms of the lower chambers of the heart). [...] Flecainide works by regulating the flow of sodium in the heart, causing prolongation of the cardiac action potential.|$|E
2500|$|In general, {{atrial flutter}} should be managed {{the same as}} atrial fibrillation. [...] Because both rhythms {{can lead to the}} {{formation}} of a blood clot in the atrium, individuals with atrial flutter usually require some form of anticoagulation or antiplatelet agent. [...] Both rhythms can be associated with dangerously fast heart rates and thus require medication to control the heart rate (such as beta blockers or calcium channel blockers) and/or rhythm control (such as ibutilide or dofetilide). However, atrial flutter is more resistant to correction with such medications than atrial fibrillation. For example, although the class III <b>antiarrhythmic</b> <b>agent</b> ibutilide is an effective treatment for atrial flutter, rates of recurrence after treatment are quite high (70-90%). [...] Additionally, there are some specific considerations particular to treatment of atrial flutter.|$|E

50|$|Class III <b>antiarrhythmic</b> <b>agents</b> exhibit reverse use-dependent {{prolongation}} of {{the action}} potential duration (Reverse use-dependence). This means that the refractoriness of the ventricular myocyte increases at lower heart rates. This increases the susceptibility of the myocardium to Early Afterdepolarizations (EADs) at low heart rates. <b>Antiarrhythmic</b> <b>agents</b> that exhibit reverse use-dependence are more efficacious at preventing a tachyarrhythmia than converting someone into normal sinus rhythm. Because of the reverse use-dependence of class III agents, at low heart rates class III <b>antiarrhythmic</b> <b>agents</b> may paradoxically be more arrhythmogenic.|$|R

40|$|Background. Elevated {{levels of}} {{cholesterol}} and apoprotein B (apo B), the essential carrier protein for low density lipoprotein, are major lipid {{risk factors for}} premature coronary disease. <b>Antiarrhythmic</b> <b>agents</b> are frequently prescribed to patients with coronary heart disease and associated cardiac arrhythmias. As part of another study, we retrospectively investigated the effect of <b>antiarrhythmic</b> <b>agents</b> on blood lipids. Methods and Results. The study population consisted of 1, 567 postinfarction patients on whom we prospectively collected serial blood samples for lipid and apoprotein determinations and recorded the concomitant medications the patients were receiving at three follow-up time periods. The lipids, analyzed at a central core laboratory, included total cholesterol, triglycerides, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL C), and apoproteins A-I (apo A-I), A-II (apo A-lI), and apo B. The difference in the group mean lipid values for patients receiving and not receiving type Ia <b>antiarrhythmic</b> <b>agents</b> (quinidine, procain-amide, and disopyramide) was evaluated by the two-sample t test, and multiple linear regression analyses were performed to adjust for relevant covariates.
