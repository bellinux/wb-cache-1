5|$|In 1827, Mary Shelley was {{party to}} a scheme that enabled her friend Isabel Robinson and Isabel's lover, Mary Diana Dods, who wrote {{under the name}} David Lyndsay, {{to embark on a}} life {{together}} in France as man and wife. With the help of Payne, whom she kept in the dark <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>details,</b> Mary Shelley obtained false passports for the couple. In 1828, she fell ill with smallpox while visiting them in Paris. Weeks later she recovered, unscarred but without her youthful beauty.|$|E

Fearing for Sivaji's life, she hands over Sivaji's laptop to the CBI and Income Tax officers hired by Adiseshan with all the information regarding the illegal money transactions. With presentable evidence, Sivaji is arrested.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, {{probably}} in 1213, he took Dyrrhachium from Venice, followed in 1214 by Corfu. Very {{little is known}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> of these successes, as the generally hostile stance of the pro-Nicaean Byzantine historians towards Michael means that his achievements were often ignored. According to local Corfiot tradition, the castle of Angelokastro was built by Michael. Michael continued to push northward into Albania and Macedonia, taking Kruja and ending {{the independence of the}} principality of Arbanon and its ruler, Dimitri Progoni, but his attempt to seize Zeta was stopped by the Serbs at Skadar.|$|E

5|$|The series {{depicts the}} adventures of Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) as she deals with life {{as a high school}} student while {{moonlighting}} as a private detective. In this episode, Veronica resolves the mystery of her sexual assault a year earlier by talking to previous acquaintances and learning <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> of what happened at Shelly Pomroy's party a year earlier while she was under the influence of GHB. Meanwhile, Duncan (Teddy Dunn) returns from running away earlier, and Veronica and Logan's relationship matures as she reacts to the news that he had roofies the night of the party.|$|E
5|$|As Anderson {{remained}} {{throughout her}} life evasive <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> {{of her life}} as a commercial writer, it is not known when she began writing commercially under pseudonyms, what those pseudonyms were, or, indeed, how much she wrote. She revealed only that she began writing for magazines and newspapers out of commercial necessity, and rarely under her own name. Although she achieved success later in this field, she sometimes stated that, as her writing improved, her pieces were more frequently turned down for publication. In her thirties, she began to write for commercial radio. Beginning with half-hour slots, Anderson gradually became interested in the technique of crafting radio plays, and began submitting some of her better work to the ABC under her own name. She later ascribed her fondness for writing the expansive dialogue in her novels to her early experience writing radio plays.|$|E
5|$|One {{day before}} senior year, Veronica is working {{a job at}} a {{restaurant}}. Soon, a boy named Kelvin (Charles Duckworth) comes into the restaurant and says that he failed his drug test, even though he has been clean for ten months. Veronica sees an interview with her father, Keith (Enrico Colantoni), on TV, and it is revealed that he wrote a book about the Lilly Kane case. The episode then flashes back to the romantic cliffhanger at the end of season one, and it is revealed that Logan was at the door. Logan reveals that the biker gang beat him up after he kicked Weevil (Francis Capra) in the face. Although he woke up with a knife and found one of the gang members was stabbed, Logan tells Veronica that he did not stab the gang member, and Veronica believes him. However, Leo (Max Greenfield) comes and arrests Logan. Wallace (Percy Daggs III) says that he and Meg (Alona Tal) also failed their drug test. Wallace informs Veronica <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> of the drug test, and the episode flashes back to show the details of Veronica and Logan starting to date over the summer. Veronica talks to all the students who were framed in the drug test, and they all say some people might want to harm them. Veronica has become estranged from Meg, and Veronica reveals that Logan was released from prison soon after he was arrested.|$|E

25|$|The most general {{interpretation}} of entropy is {{as a measure}} of our uncertainty about a system. The equilibrium state of a system maximizes the entropy because we have lost all information about the initial conditions except for the conserved variables; maximizing the entropy maximizes our ignorance <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> of the system. This uncertainty is not of the everyday subjective kind, but rather the uncertainty inherent to the experimental method and interpretative model.|$|E

Both brothers eventually converted to Presbyterianism. Gibbs impressed the Presbyterian assembly such that the Assembly provided financial backing for him to attend Kimball Union Academy in Meriden, New Hampshire.|$|E

25|$|When Germany invaded Norway on April 9, 1940, many of Norway’s {{commanding}} {{officers of}} both the Army and the Navy were uncertain {{of what to do}} since they did not receive any orders. This led to many giving up without mounting a defence. Although the highest levels of government ordered an immediate mobilization, the ministers of the Norwegian government knew nothing <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> of mobilization, which were left totally to the Ministry of Defence. Since the Minister of Defence was new to his duties, he deferred this action to his Commander-in Chief, General Kristian Laake.|$|E
25|$|As noted, {{not much}} is known <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> of the structure. The church was built with five domes: the central dome was {{dedicated}} to Christ while the four smaller ones housed chapels of the four other saints to whom the church was dedicated. The exact arrangement of the domes {{and the type of}} the church are disputed. Most scholars consider it to have been a cross-in-square structure, similar to the later Myrelaion and Lips Monastery churches. Indeed, the widespread use of this type throughout the Orthodox world, from the Balkans to Russia, is commonly ascribed to the prestige of this imperial building.|$|E
25|$|Bakhtin's {{works and}} ideas gained {{popularity}} after his death, and he endured difficult conditions {{for much of}} his professional life, a time in which information was often seen as dangerous and therefore often hidden. As a result, the details provided now are often of uncertain accuracy. Also contributing to the imprecision of these details is the limited access to Russian archival information during Bakhtin’s life. It is only after the archives became public that scholars realized that much of what they thought they knew <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> of Bakhtin’s life was false or skewed largely by Bakhtin himself.|$|E

25|$|Since {{conscious}} awareness {{has to be}} {{coupled with}} local physical systems, the observer’s physical environment has to interact and can influence the brain.

Speculation <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> of this awareness-local physical system coupling on a purely theoretical basis could occur, however experimentally searching for them through neurological and psychological studies would be ideal.|$|E

After that incident in 2006, Kelly says that Ailes did not sexually harass her again. Then, in 2016, when Gretchen Carlson first made her sexual abuse allegations, Fox pressured Kelly to defend Ailes, which she refused to do.|$|E
