5|$|There are {{two types}} of slope posture, a pre-copulatory one and an {{ordinary}} one. The pre-copulatory behavior of scaly-breasted munia includes a sequence of actions. The first involves either the male or female playing with nest-material. As soon as a bird has arranged the nest material in its bill, it begins to fly around in a zig-zag path. Once a bird lands close to its partner, the male bends towards the female <b>and</b> <b>wipes</b> its bill. The male then sings with movements of the body. The female invites mounting with tail quivering.|$|E

Realizing Pikachu's condition is critical, Ash pleads him to go inside his Poké Ball so that Ash can protect him from the approaching Spearow. Pikachu, after seeing how much Ash cares for it, performs a powerful Thunder attack which drives the Spearow away, but also destroys Misty's bike. As the rain-clouds part, a mysterious golden bird flies over a rainbow and Ash's Pokédex informs him {{that there is no}} current data on this Pokémon and that there are several yet to be identified. Ash carries Pikachu into Viridian City, and Pikachu licks Ash's cheek.|$|E

Jesus is beaten and pressed by the guards until the unwilling Simon of Cyrene is forced into {{carrying}} the cross with him. At {{the end of their}} travel, with his mother Mary, Mary Magdalene, and others witnessing, Jesus is crucified. The very act seems to affect the weather conditions of the earth itself.|$|E
25|$|As {{his career}} progressed, Tanaka's films became {{known for their}} imaginative, {{sometimes}} surreal, use of color and poetic imagery within the setting of a harsh, brutal world. In 1973, Tanaka directed the second entry in the Secret Chronicle trilogy, Secret Chronicle: Torture Hell. In contrast to the first entry in the trilogy, a satirical depiction of a 19th-century brothel, Tanaka's film was a serious look at religious-sexual ceremonies at a temple. For this effort, Tanaka won the Directors Guild of Japan New Directors Citation in 1973. The last film of this trilogy, Secret Chronicle: She Beast Market (1974) returned to the satirical style of the first film. The cast included the popular poet Sakumi Hagiwara playing the memorable role {{of a man who}} simultaneously commits suicide <b>and</b> <b>wipes</b> out a gang of yakuza when he explodes a gas-filled inflatable sex-doll.|$|E

25|$|After Apophis's {{defeat in}} the Season 5 premiere ("Enemies"), the half-Ascended Goa'uld System Lord Anubis (David Palffy) assumes {{the role of the}} primary {{antagonist}} of the show. This new villain possesses much of the knowledge of the Ancients and their technology. While Earth builds its first interstellar spaceship (the Prometheus) in seasons Season 6 and Season7, Anubis creates an army of almost invincible Kull Warriors <b>and</b> <b>wipes</b> out or subordinates most of his adversaries amongst the System Lords. In the Season 7 finale ("Lost City"), SG-1 discovers a powerful weapon in an Ancient outpost in Antarctica that annihilates Anubis's entire fleet and also sets the stage for the spin-off series Stargate Atlantis. Ba'al subsumes much of Anubis's power in Season 8, while Anubis, who survived the destruction of his fleet in a disembodied form, quietly begins to re-assert his influence. Human-form Replicators begin to conquer the System Lords, but SG-1 finds and adjusts an Ancient weapon to destroy all Replicators throughout the galaxy. Near the end of Season 8 ("Threads"), it is revealed that the benevolent Ascended being Oma Desala (Mel Harris) is responsible for Anubis's original ascension. When she engages Anubis in an eternal stalemated battle on the Ascended plane to prevent his acting on the mortal plane, the Replicators and most System Lords have already been annihilated and the Jaffa win their freedom from Goa'uld rule.|$|E

Peter lies to Tina, telling {{her that he had}} leave Carla and move away with her to Portsmouth when he was actually committing to Carla after they discovered she was pregnant. The affair causes Peter to relapse and start drinking again. Carla's brother Rob Donovan discovers the affair and threatens them both that he will tell Carla if they do not. Tina books a taxi for her and Peter but cannot find Peter so she heads to the Rovers Return to find him and Carla celebrating Carla's pregnancy. Feeling crushed, Tina heads back to her flat and is pursued by Peter. They argue and Tina threatens Peter that she's going to reveal all about their affair to Carla, causing Peter to leave her flat and tell a heartbroken Carla about the affair before she does. Peter accidentally leaves Tina's flat door open whilst leaving and Rob notices and enters Tina's flat to confront her about her affair. Rob and Tina argue about her telling Carla about the affair, forcing them both onto her balcony outside. But when Tina threatens Rob about reporting his dodgy dealing at his pawn shop to the police, Rob pushes Tina from the balcony and she plummets to the ground. Rob frantically destroys Tina's flat in an attempt {{to make it look like}} a burglary <b>and</b> <b>wipes</b> his fingerprints off of everything he has touched. He heads outside to see a motionless Tina lying on the cobbles, he starts to call for an ambulance when Tina manages to get back to her feet. Rob tries backtracking his actions and tells Tina that she slipped but Tina goads Rob by saying she will report him for attempted murder as well as him selling illegal goods. Rob takes desperate measures to shut Tina up so he grabs a lead pipe from a van outside the builder's yard and bludgeons Tina to death. After Peter's confession, a furious Carla heads on the war path and goes in search of Tina. She notices Tina's door to her flat is open and heads inside to have it out with her. She enters the ransacked flat but does not find Tina anywhere, she heads out onto the balcony and looks over to discover Tina's body on the floor below. Tina dies a week later from her injuries.|$|E
500|$|Alibabavum 40 Thirudargalum {{was shot}} entirely on indoor sets, with the {{exception}} of a few horse riding sequences. For changes of scenes, irises <b>and</b> <b>wipes</b> were used which, according to Encyclopaedia of Indian Cinema by Ashish Rajadhyaksha and Paul Willemen, added a [...] "sense of anachronism" [...] to the film. It was also the first full-length Tamil colour film, shot in Gevacolor. Rajadhyaksha and Willemen claim it to be the first South Indian film in Gevacolor, despite the fact that the 1955 Tamil film Kanavaney Kankanda Deivam had a few sequences in Gevacolor. The scenes involving horses, which belonged to the Mysore Reserve Police, were shot at Mysore over ten days. The thieves' cave, designed by Dominic, was created at two locations— the exterior cave scenes with the horses were shot at Mysore, while the interior scenes were shot at Yercaud near Salem. Sundaram brought twenty horses from Mysore for the shoot at Yercaud. The jewels and gold coins featured in the film were actually clay painted in gold.|$|E

The motion condemned the proposal, describing humans as [...] "obscene, perverted, cruel, uncivilised and lethal", and proposed that the House [...] "looks {{forward to the day}} when the inevitable asteroid slams into the Earth <b>and</b> <b>wipes</b> them out thus giving nature the opportunity to start again". It was signed by only two other MPs, Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell, both left-wingers, and future Leader of the Opposition and Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, respectively.|$|E

2500|$|Jean-Claude Homawoo, an {{opposition}} representative on CENI, said that opposition supporters were totally disillusioned with the electoral process: [...] "So {{many times we}} went and voted in elections {{we knew we had}} won, only for the opposite result to be declared. So people have become tired. They don't believe their vote counts anymore." [...] Esso, the RPT Secretary-General, described the result as [...] "great victory that gives us a lot of satisfaction <b>and</b> <b>wipes</b> off any doubts about the process", while Bodjona dismissed the opposition as [...] "bad losers". For its part, the EU observer mission released a report that noted the accusations of vote-buying by the RPT, but also suggested there was no evidence to support opposition claims of outright fraud.|$|E
