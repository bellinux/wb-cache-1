40|$|Use of S-wave {{attenuation}} from perforation {{shots to}} map {{the growth of the}} stimulated reservoir volume in the Marcellus gas shale Water-filled fractures stimulated by hydraulic fracturing will severely attenuate S-waves. By comparing the P- and S-wave amplitudes generated from perforation shots in the Mar-cellus gas shale, one can infer the existence and constrain the location of stimulated hydraulic fractures. The waveforms of the perforation shots in unstimulated gas shale are first analyzed to define the prestimulation radiation pattern. Then the change of perforation-shot S-wave waveform is examined for information about the development of hydraulic fractures. S-wave attenua-tion validates the existence of offstage hydraulic fractures and the invasion of treatment fluid from another neighbor stage. This method might have potential use in designing an <b>active</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>survey</b> to more effectively monitor hydraulic-fracture stimula-tion beyond the current microseismic mapping techniques...|$|E

The magnetic lineation across the entire survey region in this study is oriented NE-SW (normal to the direction of line A–A′) (Nakanishi 2011). If the fractures and cracks formed at the spreading center during oceanic plate formation were preserved, the fast polarization would be estimated in the NE-SW direction. The present results, which contradict this expectation, thus indicate other mechanisms for creating anisotropic structure are present within the sediment across all surveyed regions and crust in spatially sporadic regions. An <b>active</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>survey</b> shows no significant P wave velocity difference in the crust around the intersection between line A–A′ and the northeastern segment of line E–E′ (Kodaira et al. 2014).

According to stratigraphic and sonic log data from deep boreholes and tomographic P velocities, the rim is likely formed by solidified lavas and/or tuffs with interbedded lava.

The obtained seismic section is comparable to classical upgoing/downgoing wavefield decomposition and deconvolution applied on a common receiver gather. Seismic interferometry does not require precise knowledge of source geometry or shooting times, but more accurate results are obtained when including this information for segmenting the signals before the crosscorrelations, especially when signals from distant surveys {{are present in the}} data.

The dispersive characteristics of Rayleigh type surface waves were utilized for imaging the shallow subsurface layers by estimating the 1 D (depth) and 2 D (depth and surface location) shear wave velocities. The reliability of the Multi-channel Analysis of Surface Waves (MASW) depends on the accurate determination of phase velocities for horizontally traveling fundamental mode Rayleigh waves. Consequently, the elastic properties are evaluated empirically. The Vs 30 (average shear wave velocity down to 30 m depth), which is obtained from the MASW technique, plays a critical role in evaluating the site response of the upper 30 m depth.

40|$|The ever-growing size of {{data sets}} for active and passive seismic imaging makes the {{availability}} of automatic procedures for rapid analysis more and more valuable. Such procedures are especially important for time-critical applications like emergency decisions or re-orienting of ongoing seismic surveys. In this paper a new, iterative scheme for 3 D traveltime tomography is presented. The technique, based on a tool originally developed for earthquake data, uses cross-correlation to examine waveform similarity and to adjust arrival times on seismic sections. A preliminary set of reference arrival times is first corrected by the cross-correlation lag and then used to build an initial 3 D tomographic velocity model through a standard inversion code; traveltimes calculated from this model are then taken as new reference arrivals {{and the process of}} pick adjustment is repeated. The result is a tomographic image, upgraded and refined at each iteration of the procedure. The test performed on the waveform data set recorded during the 2001 SERAPIS <b>active</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>survey</b> in the gulfs of Naples and Pozzuoli (Southern Italy) shows that the 3 D iterative tomography scheme produces a velocity image {{of the structure of the}} Campi Flegrei caldera which is consistent with the results from previous studies, employing just a fraction of the time needed by a human analyst to identify first breaks.

In total, 6 nights and 3 daytime series of ambient noise data were recorded. First, we applied autocorrelation to the passive data records to reconstruct the reflection response. The results show good structural correlation with a stacked section from the active data. Then we used passive seismic interferometry to reconstruct common shot gathers for each receiver location. Surface waves were observed in some retrieved gathers from Line 1. However, for Line 2 we also observed refracted and reflected waves in some retrieved shot gathers.

Microtremors measurements were carried out at 459 sites using short-period sensors. This extensive survey allowed the fundamental resonance frequency of the soft soil to be mapped and areas prone to site amplification to be identified. The results indicate a progressive decrease in the fundamental resonance frequencies from the southern and eastern parts, where the bedrock outcrops, toward the northern coast where a thickness of sedimentary cover is present. Shear wave velocity (Vs) was evaluated using the 2 -D MASW at carefully selected 99 representative sites in Muscat. These 99 sites were investigated with survey lines of 52 m length. 1 -D and interpolated 2 -D profiles were generated up to a depth range 20 – 40 m. The vertical Vs soundings {{were used in the}} SHAKE 91 software in combination with suitable seismic input strong motion records to obtain the soil effect. Most of the study area has amplification values less than 2. 0 for all the considered spectral periods.

40|$|Seismic {{interferometry}} is {{a technique}} by which the Green’s function or impulse response between two receivers is recovered through the cross-correlation of the transmission responses recorded by those receivers. This technique has found several applications, including the generation of virtual shot gathers from ambient seismic noise for use in seismic reflection processing. In March of 2013, 336 receivers were deployed over the volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) deposit found at the Lalor mine in Manitoba, Canada. Approximately 300 hours of ambient seismic noise was recorded {{for the purpose of}} testing the effectiveness of seismic interferometry in imaging a crystalline rock environment. A time-domain beamforming algorithm was implemented to determine the locations of the sources present during recording. The results indicate {{that the vast majority of}} the recorded noise originated from mine and ventilation shafts located at the Lalor mine. Synthetic experiments were conducted to determine the effects such a source distribution would have on the application of seismic interferometry in the presence of dipping reflectors. The experiments show that if sources are located only on one side of a receiver line, the dip and lateral extents of reflectors will not be imaged properly. A technique involving beamforming and F-K filtering was developed to remove surface wave noise originating from near-field sources. Using this technique, the raw data was processed into virtual shot gathers free of surface wave noise. Virtual shot gathers were generated along 4 of the receiver lines and processed as separate 2 -D reflection datasets. The resulting reflection profiles are compared against coincident DMO-stacked data from a larger 3 -D <b>active</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>survey</b> conducted over the Lalor mine.

40|$|Seismic interferometry, also {{referred}} to as Green's function retrieval by crosscorrelation, is a technique with many applications, such as for the reconstruction of surface seismic, VSP, to Ocean-Bottom data using active or passive data. Due to the impurity of the Green's function retrieved in the presence of one-sided illumination or intrinsic losses, multidimensional deconvolution emerged as an alternative. Multidivisional deconvolution addresses the limitations by deconvolving the point-spread function from the crosscorrelation result, which removes the source signature, surface related multiples and takes intrinsic losses into account. The similarity of the inverse problems of interferometry by multidimensional deconvolution applied to active and transient passive data makes it an attractive framework to merge the two datasets and retrieve a broadband Green's function (reflection response). The actual merging is done in the frequency-space domain using simple weighting functions. Numerical validations were carried out to merge active and passive body waves using interferometry by multidimensional deconvolution in a simplified exploration-style environment. The results indicate that sufficient source illumination is need as well as sufficient spatial receiver sampling to ensure that wavefields are properly recorded. Also adequate length of the receiver line must be ensured to properly record the low-frequency wavefields and meet first-Fresnel-zone criterion. The retrieved broadband response is desired for imaging and reservoir characterization purposes. The <b>active</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>survey</b> conducted in the northern Netherlands accompanied by the passive recordings of induced seismicity in the area was an inspiration for the merging idea. Given that the conditions from the numerical models are met in the field, passive and active data can be merged.

Petit spots are submarine volcanos formed on the oceanic plate, providing an outlet for alkali magma ascending from the asthenosphere (Hirano et al. 2006, 2010; Machida et al. 2015). The formation of these volcanoes, alongside their conduits and magma chambers, induces fractures in the oceanic lithosphere. In the case of high volcanic activities, the basement and oceanic Moho could also be highly deformed or broken: Hence, converted Pos 1 and Pos 2 amplitudes would be weakened as in the case of fault-induced deformations of the basement and Moho.

I have applied a new method using a passive array to study Rayleigh waves from microtremors, waves originating from building appliances, cars, pedestrians walking, etc. Instead of using sines and cosines to estimate the signal, as in traditional Fourier transform analysis, I have developed a technique using a wavelet transform process to analyze the signal. The array was located in Rio Bosque Park east of El Paso, TX to image river sediments deposited by the Rio Grande River. By using everyday noises as the source, site-specific analysis can be performed in urban areas without worrying about noise interference or disturbing the public with explosions or other loud active sources.

40|$|The Passo della Morte block-slide {{covers a}} {{relative}} large {{area in the}} Carnic Alps, along {{the left side of}} the Taglia- mento River, between Forni di Sotto and Ampezzo (N-E of Italy). The high seismicity and the presence of the landslide increase the risk associated to the interest area. Moreover the large volume of material involved in the landslide (a few million of cubic meters), the presence of important infrastructure such as the road and two tunnels which cross the landslide, as well as the presence of the Tagliamento River that flow at the foot of the landslide, make the area very vulnerable. This study concerns with the western part of the Deep Seated Gravitational Slope Deformation (DSGSD). It fo- cuses on the potential instability of a rock slope (crossed by road tunnels) and its connection with the DSGSD activity. The main objectives of this study are: monitoring the rock mass movement, studying the seismic site ef- fect and defining the stratigraphic and geological characteristics of involved materials. Two vibration sensors have been installed inside the potential landslide: a short-period seismometer and a piezo- electric transducer. The microseismic activity recorded by the sensors has been analyzed, with particular regard to periods characterized by rapid changes in recorded seismic signals, and then correlated with the precipitation trend to evaluate the existence of a possible correlation between these phenomena. The microseismic activity study has highlighted the existence of a close link between microseisms and acoustic emissions recorded respectively by the seismometer and by the piezoelectric transducer. In addition, the comparison with the rainfall pattern has shown a direct relationship between different rainfall events and the sharp increase of microseismic activity detected by the two instruments. The correlation is good, even if acoustic emissions appear to be more sensitive than microseisms to short duration and low intensity rainfall events. The seismic site effects and the directivity in seismic site response of the rock mass have been investigated through the use of Nakamura (1989) method. In particular have been estimated the resonance frequencies and the polariza- tion directions of seismic energy in three selected sites. All sites have shown a clear evidence of polarization in the direction of N/NW-S/SE and E/NE-W/SW, compatible with the maximum slope inclination and with the limestone stratification direction outcropping in this area.

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{methodology}} {{to obtain a}} consistent velocity model from calibration shots or microseismicity observed on a buried array. Using a layered 1 D isotropic model derived from checkshots as an initial velocity model, we invert P‐wave arrival times to obtain effective anisotropic parameters with a vertical axis of symmetry (VTI). The nonlinear inversion uses iteration between linearized inversion for anisotropic parameters and origin times or depths, which is specific to microseismic monitoring. We apply this technique to multiple microseismic events from several treatments within a buried array. The joint inversion of selected events shows a largely reduced RMS error indicating that we can obtain robust estimates of anisotropic parameters, however we do not show improved source locations. For joint inversion of multiple microseismic events we obtained Thomsen anisotropic parameters ε of 0. 15 and δ of 0. 05, which are consistent with values observed in <b>active</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>surveys.</b> These values allow us to locate microseismic events from multiple hydraulic fracture treatments separated across thousands of metres with a single velocity model.

30|$|Structural changes {{occurred}} between the outer-rise and trench regions because many normal faults develop at the uppermost oceanic plate {{due to the}} horizontal extension along the trench-normal direction associated with plate bending (Ranero et al. 2003; Ranero and Sallarès, 2004; Grevemeyer et al. 2007; Fujie et al. 2013). This {{has the potential to}} induce seafloor, basement, and oceanic Moho deformations. If Po waves enter such undulated interfaces, converted Pos 1 and Pos 2 amplitudes would be weakened by ineffective conversion or/and ray-path bending. As their travel times also vary at each OBS as a function of BAZ, the coherence of Pos waves may be reduced in the aligned time-domain RCFs. Additionally, seismic velocity reductions at shallower parts of oceanic plates have been revealed by <b>active</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>surveys</b> (Ranero et al. 2003; Ranero and Sallarès 2004; Grevemeyer et al. 2007; Fujie et al. 2013; Shillington et al. 2015). These can be explained by hydration at the crust and mantle through fractures due to the plate bending. If the seismic velocity contrast at the basement and Moho in this region was decreased by velocity reduction degrees at the sediment, igneous crust, and mantle, converted Pos amplitudes would be weakened. These structural factors may alter the appearance of the Pos waves along the A–A′ and B–B′ lines as well as across {{the northern part of the}} passive survey area (Figs.  6, 8).|$|R

40|$|One {{application}} of seismic interferometry is {{to retrieve the}} impulse response (Green's function) from crosscorrelation of ambient seismic noise. Various researchers show results for retrieving the surface-wave part of the Green's function. However, reflection retrieval has proven more challenging. We crosscorrelate ambient seismic noise, recorded along eight parallel lines in the Sirte basin east of Ajdabeya, Libya, to obtain shot gathers that contain reflections. We take advantage of geophone groups to suppress part of the undesired surface-wave noise and apply frequency-wavenumber filtering before crosscorrelation to suppress surface waves further. After comparing the retrieved results with data from an <b>active</b> <b>seismic</b> exploration <b>survey</b> along the same lines, we use the retrieved reflection data to obtain a migrated reflection image of the subsurface.

40|$|Noise {{measurements}} {{have been}} done in the urban area of Napoli (Italy), a densely and crowded populated city of southern Italy, with historical architectonic heritage often damaged by tectonic earthquakes. Noise has been recorded by Kinemetrics Q 330 station with a 3 component Episensor broadband accelerometer. The H/V ratio between the mean of the Fourier spectra of the horizontal components and the spectrum of the vertical component has been computed for 20 s windows and averaged on about 150 windows of noise data. Noise has been measured at sites with detailed shear wave velocity profiles obtained from the non-linear inversion (hedgehog method) of the group velocity dispersion curve of Rayleigh fundamental mode, extracted with FTAN method from <b>active</b> <b>seismic</b> <b>surveys.</b> Ellipticities of all modes, Rayleigh waves and spectral amplifications, both with sophisticated algorithms like mode summation and finite difference techniques and simplified 1 -D techniques, have been computed. It turns out that the fundamental and, at times, also higher modes Rayleigh waves are present at the resonance frequency of the soil cover. where the maximum spectral value of noise H/V shows resemblance to the main peak of computed spectral amplifications. Although the match at the resonance frequency, realistic computed amplifications must be assumed for seismic rnicrozonation. Hence a novel use of noise measurements is proposed which consists of a rapid, detailed mapping of the computed spectral amplifications and average physical properties, starting from the fit of the main peak frequency...|$|R
3000|$|We {{determined}} the seismic attenuation {{structure of the}} Kumano Basin, a forearc basin in {{the central part of}} the Nankai subduction zone. Despite its importance for understanding the physical condition of the Earth's interior and seismic wave propagation processes, the attenuation factor Q has been poorly estimated in the crustal layers of the offshore areas of Nankai because severe attenuation occurring in the seafloor sediments prevents the reliable estimation of Q from conventional <b>active</b> source <b>seismic</b> <b>surveys.</b> In the present study, we derive Q values from the diminishing rate of the high-frequency contents of seismic energy during propagation through sub-seafloor layers. The records of vertical seismic profiling acquired at approximately 1, 000  m below the seafloor, which have fewer effects from shallow attenuation, enabled us to elucidate depth variation of Q of P waves (Q [...]...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA 3 D <b>active</b> {{and passive}} <b>seismic</b> <b>survey</b> was carried over an aquifer in Italy. We used 1 -component {{vertical}} receivers {{in a fine}} areal grid of 100 x 100 m. Furthermore, two orthogonal linear profiles were acquired with 3 -component receivers, recording the signal of a directional vibrator in the x, y and z direction, so getting a 9 -component wave field. The data allow studying the elastic propagation effects of seismic waves in the aquifer, getting independent measurements of direct P, SH and SV arrivals. The elastic parameters they provide allow exploiting the Rayleigh wave velocities obtained by passive seismic for aquifer monitoring...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a series of self-potential {{measurements}} at Somma-Vesuvius volcanic area acquired in conjunction with an <b>active</b> <b>seismic</b> tomography <b>survey.</b> The aim of our study is both to provide further confirmation to the occurrence of seismo-electric coupling and to identify sites suitable for self-potential signal monitoring at Somma-Vesuvius district. The data, which were collected along two perpendicular dipoles, show significant changes on the natural electric field pattern. These variations, attributable to electrokinetic processes triggered by the artificial seismic waves, were observed after explosions occurred at a distance less than 5 km from the SP dipole arrays. In particular, {{we found that the}} NW-SE component of the natural electric field was more sensible to the shots than the NE-SW one, and the major effects did not correspond to the nearest shots. Such evidences were interpreted considering the underground electrical properties as deduced by previous detailed resistivity and self-potential surveys performed in the study area. </p...|$|R
40|$|In 1994, the United States Geological Survey, {{together}} with several academic institutions, conducted an <b>active</b> source <b>seismic</b> <b>survey</b> through the Los Angeles basin, {{known as the}} Los Angeles Region Seismic Experiment (LARSE). This study {{presents the results of}} a three-dimensional tomographic velocity model produced by inverting LARSE first arrival times using First Arrival Seismic Tomography Code (FAST) (Zelt and Barton, 1998). Three-dimensional inversion was chosen in order to obtain a velocity model for portions of the experiment that had three-dimensional ray coverage. These occur primarily on {{the western edge of the}} Los Angeles Basin and the adjacent offshore areas. In general, lack of reversing ray coverage throughout much of the model volume leads to questions about the reliability of the model for geologic interpretation. However, there are a number of places where the correlation with geology is strong. In the region of 3 D coverage, the San Pedro Basin and Palos Verdes uplift are imaged. The rest of the model consists of three 2 D images of the study area along the source/receiver transects. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) ...|$|R
40|$|Cetaceans use {{sound in}} many contexts, {{such as in}} social interactions, {{as well as to}} forage and to react in {{dangerous}} situations. Little information exists to describe how they respond physically and behaviorally to intense and long-term noise levels. Effects on cetaceans from <b>seismic</b> <b>survey</b> activities need to be understood in order to determine detailed acoustic exposure guidelines and to apply appropriated mitigation measures. This study examines direct behavioral responses of cetaceans in the southern Mediterranean Sea during <b>seismic</b> <b>surveys</b> with large airgun arrays (volume up to 5200 ci) used in the TOMO-ETNA <b>active</b> <b>seismic</b> experiment of summer 2014. Wide Angle Seismic and Multi-Channel <b>Seismic</b> <b>surveys</b> had carried out with refraction and reflection seismic methods, producing about 25, 800 air-gun shots. Visual monitoring undertaken in the 26 daylights of seismic exploration adopted the protocol of the Joint Nature Conservation Committee. Data recorded were analyzed to examine effects on cetaceans. Sighting rates, distance and orientation from the airguns were compared for different volume categories of the airgun arrays. Results show that cetaceans can be disturbed by <b>seismic</b> <b>survey</b> activities, especially during particularly events. Here we propose many integrated actions to further mitigate this exposure and implications for management...|$|R
40|$|Data {{collected}} during <b>active</b> and passive <b>seismic</b> <b>surveys</b> {{can be stored}} in many different, more or less standard, formats. One of the most popular is the SEG-Y format, developed since 1975 to store single-line seismic digital data on tapes, and now evolved to store them into hard-disk and other media as well. Unfortunately, sometimes, files that are claimed to be recorded in the SEG-Y format cannot be processed using available free or industrial packages. Aiming to solve this impasse we present segy-change, a pre-processing software program to view, analyze, change and fix errors present in SEG-Y data files. It is written in C language and it can be used also as a software library and is compatible with most operating systems. Segy-change allows the user to display and optionally change the values inside all parts of a SEG-Y file: the file header, the trace headers and the data blocks. In addition, it allows to do a quality check on the data by plotting the traces. We provide instructions and examples on how to use the software...|$|R
