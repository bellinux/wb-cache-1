We {{have found}} that the AC {{electro-optic}} response of a hybrid aligned nematic cell at the frequency (f) of an electric field applied normal to the plates can be conveniently used to compare the anchoring energies at the two surfaces. The f signal arises from the flexoelectric contribution to the surface torques when the anchoring energies are weak. For CCH- 7, we have found by measurement of the optical path difference that the homeotropic alignment produced by a silane treatment has a weak anchoring energy. In this case, the f signal produced by an applied AC field exhibits a maximum and then a minimum {{as a function of the}} field. The reduction in the signal level after the maximum is caused by a lowering of the tilt angle at the surface treated for homeotropic alignment at high fields. The subsequent increase is caused by an effective weakening of the anchoring energy at the homogeneously <b>aligned</b> <b>surface</b> because of a sharp curvature distortion close to that surface.

The aligning quality and azimuthal and zenithal anchoring energy were measured and the drift of the easy orientation axis (gliding effect) on the PVCN-F surface, depending on UV exposure, was studied. Special {{attention is paid to}} unraveling the contribution of the adsorption liquid-crystal molecules onto the <b>aligning</b> <b>surface</b> to the anchoring {{properties of}} PVCN-F and measuring the drift of the easy orientation axis over the PVCN-F surface. It is shown that a relatively weak azimuthal anchoring energy (Waz ≈ 10 – 7 – 10 – 5 J/m 2) leads to strong drift of the easy axis in the azimuthal plane that was observed in a moderate (~ 0. 1 – 0. 3 T) magnetic field.

40|$|The {{discovery}} of the giant electrorheological (GER) effect poses {{a challenge to the}} theorists for an explanation of its physical underpinnings. This is particularly the case as the GER effect breaks the yield stress upper bound predicted on the basis of induced polarization mechanism. The GER effect was observed in suspensions of coated nanoparticles, each consisting of a core particle of barium titanyl oxalate (20 - 50 nm), coated with a 5 - 7 am layer of urea. The suspending oil is also very important, as the "wrong" oil can mean no electrorheological effect at all. Our prior work has shown the GER data, on the field dependence of yield stress, to be quantitatively accountable by the formation of aligned molecular dipolar layers in the region of particle-particle contact. Here we justify this picture through microscopic statistical mechanic considerations. We present a model of hydrogen bonding which can give rise to both electrowetting between the particles and the oil, as well as inducing the formation of <b>aligned</b> <b>surface</b> molecular dipolar layers.

40|$|The {{friction}} of surfaces moving {{relative to}} each other must derive from the atomic interaction at interfaces. However, recent experiments bring into question the fundamental understanding of this phenomenon. The analytic theories predict that most perfect clean incommensurate interfaces would produce no static friction, whereas commensurate <b>aligned</b> <b>surfaces</b> would have very high friction. In contrast recent experiments show that the static friction coefficient between clean but 45 ° misoriented Ni(001) surfaces is only a factor of 4 smaller than for the <b>aligned</b> <b>surfaces</b> (θ∼ 0 °) and clearly does not vanish (θ {{is defined as the}} rotation angle between the relative crystallographic orientations of two parallel surfaces). To understand this friction anisotropy and the difference between analytic theory and experiment, we carried out a series of nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations at 300 K for sliding of Ni(001) /Ni(001) interfaces under a constant shear force. Our molecular dynamics calculations on interfaces with the top layer roughed (and rms roughness of 0. 8 Å) lead to the static frictional coefficients in good agreement with the corresponding experimental data. On the other hand, perfect smooth surfaces (rms roughness of 0 Å) lead to a factor of 34 – 330 decreasing of static friction coefficients for misaligned surfaces, a result more consistent with the analytic theories. This shows that the major source of the discrepancy is that small amounts of roughness dramatically increase the friction on incommensurate surfaces, so that misaligned directions are comparable to aligned directions...|$|R
