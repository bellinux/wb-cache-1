5|$|Immediately after Warne and Waugh had met John in Colombo, Australia {{defeated}} Pakistan in <b>a</b> <b>one-day</b> match, scoring 7/179 and restricting Pakistan to 9/151 in reply.

Warne and May had alleged that Malik offered them money to bowl badly {{on the final day of}} the First Test in Karachi. Australia then reduced Pakistan from 3/157 to 9/258, and appeared set for victory, but a last-wicket partnership took them to the target of 314. The win was registered when wicket-keeper Ian Healy missed a stumping chance from Warne and the ball went for four byes.
