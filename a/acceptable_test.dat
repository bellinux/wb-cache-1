Convinced that this was not an <b>acceptable</b> <b>test</b> for a Salvage Drum, on January 1, 1998, the 'T' Salvage Drum (1A2T) became the UN recommended salvage packaging for international shipments. The US-DOT, per 49 CFR 173.3, also recognizes the 'T' Salvage Drum for shipments within the US. Unlike the original 49 CFR Salvage Drum requirement, the 'T' Salvage Drum is most commonly an 85 US gallon capacity steel drum that, meets UN Model Regulations test requirement 6.1.5.1.11, which specifies that when filled with water, the drum can qualify for Packing Group II and be dropped 1.2 meters (4 feet) on its most critical orientation, and not leak. In addition, the drum must successfully pass a 30 kPa Leakproofness Test. Both tests are very severe for an open-head steel container. This testing illustrates the extreme capabilities of the 'T' Salvage Drum when used for the safe recovery of hazardous materials in transportation.|$|E

Mutation testing {{has been shown to be}} one of the strongest testing criteria for the evaluation of both programs and test suites. Comprehensive sets of mutants require strong test sets to achieve <b>acceptable</b> <b>testing</b> coverage. Moreover, mutation operators are valuable for the evaluation of other testing approaches. The effectiveness of mutation testing depends on finding fault types and designing of mutation operators on the basis of faults identified. Therefore the effectiveness of testing depends upon the quality of these mutation operators. We already have the mutation operators for procedural and object oriented languages, but for aspect oriented language only a few researchers have contributed. In this paper we will study in detail about the fault types and related mutation operators for AspectJ language.
