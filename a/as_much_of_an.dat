5|$|For {{the part}} of bordello-keeper Fauna, the duo fixed on the famous diva, Helen Traubel. There was {{precedent}} for such casting—former opera star Ezio Pinza had starred as suave Frenchman Emile de Becque in South Pacific, and had received rave reviews for his performance. Traubel, {{in addition to being}} well known for her Wagnerian roles, was also noted for her nightclub singing. In 1953, the new Metropolitan Opera impresario, Rudolf Bing, feeling that she was lowering the tone of the house, declined to renew her contract. Hammerstein had seen Traubel at her first appearance at the Copacabana nightclub in New York, and afterwards had gone backstage to predict to Traubel that she would be coming straight to Broadway. He saw her show again in Las Vegas several months later, and offered her the part. When offered the role, Traubel eagerly accepted, though she later noted that she had never represented herself <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> actress.|$|E

25|$|Because games do {{not need}} to mimic actual physics, {{stability}} is not <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> issue. Almost all games use a posteriori collision detection, and collisions are often resolved using very simple rules. For instance, if a character becomes embedded in a wall, they might be simply moved back to their last known good location. Some games will calculate the distance the character can move before getting embedded into a wall, and only allow him to move that far.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{experimental}} {{findings that}} suggest {{a role for}} dendritic spine dynamics in mediating learning and memory, the degree of structural plasticity’s importance remains debatable. For instance, studies estimate {{that only a small}} portion of spines formed during training actually contribute to lifelong learning. In addition, the formation of new spines may not significantly contribute to the connectivity of the brain, and spine formation may not bear <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> influence on memory retention as other properties of structural plasticity, such as the increase in size of spine heads.|$|E
25|$|Lubbock {{had been}} <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ethnologist as an archaeologist.

Lubbock created such concepts as savages and barbarians based on the customs of then modern tribesmen and made the presumption that the terms can be applied without serious inaccuracy to {{the men of the}} Paleolithic and the Neolithic. Childe broke with this view:The assumption that any savage tribe today is primitive, in the sense that its culture faithfully reflects that of much more ancient men is gratuitous.|$|E

The Goldfeder financial empire had almost completely collapsed, and there was barely enough money to support the widowed Countess Stefania. Krystyna, not wishing to be a burden to her mother, worked at a Fiat car dealership, but soon became ill from automobile fumes and had to give up the job. At first she was thought, on the basis of shadows on her chest x-rays, to be suffering from tuberculosis, which had killed her father. She received compensation from her employer's insurance company and took her physicians' advice to lead <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> open-air life as she could.

25|$|In making The Settlers II, Blue Byte {{wanted to}} improve upon the first Settlers title to <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> extent and {{in as many}} ways as they could. To this end, they sought fan {{feedback}} from the first game, and hired Thomas Häuser, who had worked on quality assurance for The Settlers, as the lead designer. In light of their design principal of improving upon the original, although the core supply and demand-based gameplay is broadly the same, many {{other aspects of the}} game have been altered. For example, the sound effects and graphics have been enhanced, with more on-screen movements and more animations for the settlers themselves, and with four aesthetically distinct races; the economic system is more complex; the battle system is more strategic, with the player able to use scouts and stationary offensive weaponry; and a story-driven single-player campaign has been included.|$|E

500|$|Although [...] "tax inversions" [...] (in which {{a company}} {{decreases}} {{the amount of}} taxes it pays by moving its headquarters to a country with lower rates, but maintains {{the majority of their}} operations in their previous location) have been a recent financial trend, it will not have <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> impact on Burger King's reincorporation in Canada: the corporate tax rate in the United States is 39.1%, Canada's corporate tax rate is only 26%, but Burger King had used various sheltering techniques to reduce its tax rate to 27.5%. As a high-profile instance of tax inversion, news of the merger was criticized by U.S. politicians, who felt that the move would result in a loss of tax revenue to foreign interests, and could result in further government pressure against inversions (which had, until the Burger King merger, been primarily invoked by pharmaceutical firms).|$|E

500|$|The episode has {{received}} mixed to positive responses from critics. Zack Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club, rated the episode an A, calling it [...] "utterly bad-ass". Handlen {{felt that the}} episode effectively toyed with the series' usual narrative structure, making lead character Fox Mulder seem [...] "nearly <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> antagonist" [...] as The Smoking Man; Handlen also felt that [...] "Zero Sum" [...] gave significant insight into the character of Walter Skinner. Paula Vitaris, writing for Cinefantastique, rated [...] "Zero Sum" [...] one-and-a-half stars out of four, noting that its [...] "pacing and tone are off". Vitaris felt that [...] "Duchovny and Pileggi give good performances", despite Pileggi seeming [...] "unintentionally comic" [...] at times; though she noted that [...] "an episode without Scully feels pretty empty". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five, noting that [...] "Pileggi looks much more comfortable here than he did in last year's showcase [...] ". Shearman and Pearson felt that the episode's attempts to tie into the wider storylines—the appearance of Marita Covarrubias in particular—are where it [...] "really stumbles"; noting that its success lies [...] "in the shock value of seeing a deliberately familiar story through the fractured view of another character".|$|E

Film4 Productions and Tessa Ross financed the development of the film and kept it alive throughout the years, as it [...] "underwent a decade-plus of revision under various directors and investors" [...] − including Hettie MacDonald, Kenneth Branagh, Kimberly Peirce, John Maybury, and Stephen Frears − until the project completely stalled. The long trek was a result of the struggles and roadblocks experienced with funding, rights, and trepidations about a film with a gay theme and two female leads. [...] "During its development, there was a very different kind of lesbian or gay movie that got financed", Nagy said. [...] "They were very agenda or issue driven, and this was not. In fact it insists on not being that in order to make the point. I would talk about that with financiers, and I could see them glaze over." ...|$|E
