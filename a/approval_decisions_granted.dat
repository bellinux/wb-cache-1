40|$|A {{binomial}} logistic {{framework is}} used to determine important linkages between the FSA's decision on each loan application and the applicants financial and demographic attributes. Using data on both rejected and accepted FSA loan applications, empirical results indicate loan <b>approval</b> <b>decisions</b> were not significantly influenced by the borrowers' racial class and that, {{in contrast to the}} credit risk assessment standards employed by commercial lenders, the collective influence of more stringent and objective credit scoring measures on FSA loan <b>approval</b> <b>decisions</b> is insignificant.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a theoretical framework}} to analyze the variability in Food and Drug Administration (FDA) <b>approval</b> <b>decisions</b> among competing industries including those that produce new brand-name drugs, generic drugs, and medical devices. The theory provides a framework to empirically test for the determinants of FDA <b>approval</b> <b>decisions.</b> These determinants include the agency’s budget, congressional preferences and several proxies for both industry interests and consumer interests. Results from the analysis suggest that the agency’s response to these determinants varies among the three different industry approval activities. The pattern of variation implies that bureaucratic discretion is the highest for products with the greatest regulatory stringency. This variation in agency responsiveness further suggests that no single theory of regulation can explain the agency’s <b>approval</b> <b>decisions</b> among the three industries. Instead, different theories of regulation, such as public interest, capture or congressional control, are needed to explain different industry approval activities...|$|R
25|$|Due to the Transport Route Planning Acceleration Act (Verkehrswegeplanungsbeschleunigungsgesetz) adopted {{specifically}} for the new transport routes in the new federal states, {{it was possible to}} put the first planning <b>approval</b> <b>decision</b> for the Erfurt–Arnstadt section into effect at the end of 1994.

The approvals were finalised in 1998 apart from the Erfurtstadt and Bad Staffelstein sections. In the middle of 2007, the approvals were finalised for all sections.

5000|$|The investigation, {{which took}} {{three years to}} complete, {{compared}} judgments made by 50 randomly selected animal care and use committees drawn from U.S. colleges and universities. To assess the consistency of <b>approval</b> <b>decisions,</b> 150 recent research proposals from these institutions were each independently evaluated by two different animal care and use committees.The results showed that <b>approval</b> <b>decisions</b> were statistically unrelated. In most cases, proposals that were disapproved by one committee were approved by the second committee.The study also explored whether reviews were more reliable when the experiment involved certain types of animals or procedures. For example, reliability was assessed for proposals that involved dogs, cats, and primates, or for experiments involving drugs, surgery, animal pain, or death. Even in these cases, independent reviews did not agree beyond chance levels.|$|R
