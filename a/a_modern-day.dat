5|$|A {{storm of}} {{potentially}} Cape Verde origin was {{detected in the}} Virgin Islands at 1800UTC on August5. Initially moving westward, the tropical storm gradually gained in intensity before making a sharp curve towards the north on August8. The storm continued in a northerly motion before a second curvature brought it in a generally westward direction on August9. Shortly after, the tropical storm reached hurricane intensity as <b>a</b> <b>modern-day</b> Category1hurricane. The hurricane eventually made landfall at peak intensity on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina at 2030UTC on September21. At the time, the storm had maximum sustained winds of 100mph (155km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 972mbar (hPa; 28.71inHg), equivalent to <b>a</b> <b>modern-day</b> Category2hurricane. Once inland, the tropical cyclone gradually weakened, and recurved northeastward before dissipating over the Appalachian Mountains on August14.|$|E

50|$|The {{opening of}} the North Atlantic Ocean is a {{geological}} event that occurred over millions of years, during which the supercontinent Pangea broke up. <b>As</b> <b>modern-day</b> Europe (Eurasian plate) and North America (North American Plate) separated during the final breakup of Pangea in the early Cenozoic Era, they formed the North Atlantic Ocean. Geologists believe the breakup occurred either due to primary processes of the Iceland plume or secondary processes of lithospheric extension from plate tectonics.|$|R
5|$|Ahmadiyya, a modern-era movement, {{consider}} Krishna as one {{of their}} ancient prophets.

5|$|In 2012, it was {{announced}} that MGM Television was producing <b>a</b> <b>modern-day</b> television series inspired by the film, with Nigel Lythgoe acting as an executive producer. The project resurfaced in June 2015, when The Hollywood Reporter announced that MGM Television would be co-producing the series with A Networks for Lifetime, with Josh Safran attached as the show's writer and executive producer.|$|E
5|$|Although {{scientists}} began observing reduced {{populations of}} several European amphibian species {{already in the}} 1950s, awareness of the phenomenon as a global problem and its subsequent classification as <b>a</b> <b>modern-day</b> mass extinction only dates from the 1980s. By 1993, more than 500 species of frogs and salamanders present on all five continents were in decline. Today, the phenomenon of declining amphibian populations affects thousands of species in all types of ecosystems and is thus {{recognized as one of}} the most severe examples of the Holocene extinction, with severe implications for global biodiversity.|$|E

5|$|Months later, on 20 January 1818, Marques de Sousa was enlisted {{into the}} army as a cadet in the 1st Regiment of Light Cavalry in the Division of Royal Volunteers.

5|$|Open world, 3D action-adventure games {{existed for}} {{years prior to}} the release of any similar game from the Scottish {{developer}} DMA Design. Mercenary (1985) {{has been described as a}} major ancestor to the Grand Theft Auto series, because it featured an open world which the player could explore freely. The Terminator, released in 1990, was a free-form, open world game that set its action in <b>a</b> <b>modern-day</b> city that extended for miles, and included the ability to fire at civilians and steal cars. This game was also among the first American-developed games to feature these elements.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the above list of characteristics that set Kajkavian apart from Shtokavian, research suggests possible a closer relation with Kajkavian and the Slovak language, especially with the Central Slovak dialects upon which standard Slovak is based on. <b>As</b> <b>modern-day</b> Hungary used to be populated by Slavic-speaking peoples prior {{to the arrival of}} Hungarians, there have been hypotheses on possible common innovations of future West and South Slavic speakers of that area. Kajkavian is the most prominent of the South Slavic speeches in sharing the most features that could potentially be common Pannonian innovations.|$|R

5|$|Production of {{the film}} began in January 2006. Several visual effect {{companies}} were used to provide CGI for the numerous animals and the climactic flood scene. The main plot is <b>a</b> <b>modern-day</b> retelling of Noah's Ark. By the time the film had completed production, it had become the most expensive comedy film ever at the time; it was later overtaken by Men in Black 3. In October 2007, the film was released on DVD and HD DVD.|$|E
5|$|Shin Megami Tensei II {{is one of}} {{the notable}} early {{exceptions}} to the series' common setting, as it is set in a science fiction-styled future despite still including fantasy elements. The Last Bible series also shifted to a full fantasy setting. Two more recent notable departures were Strange Journey, which shifted the focus to Antarctica to portray the threat on a global scale, and Shin Megami Tensei IV, which included a medieval-stage society existing separately from <b>a</b> <b>modern-day</b> Tokyo. The Devil Summoner games take the form of modern-day detective stories as opposed to post-apocalyptic settings.|$|E
5|$|The 1900 Galveston hurricane, {{the deadliest}} natural {{disaster}} {{to hit the}} United States, peaked at an intensity that corresponds to <b>a</b> <b>modern-day</b> Category4 storm.

5|$|The higher-level {{phylogeny}} of the arthropods {{continues to}} be a matter of debate and research. In 2008, researchers at Tufts University uncovered what they believe is the world's oldest known full-body impression of a primitive flying insect, a 300-million-year-old specimen from the Carboniferous period. The oldest definitive insect fossil is the Devonian Rhyniognatha hirsti, from the 396-million-year-old Rhynie chert. It may have superficially resembled <b>a</b> <b>modern-day</b> silverfish insect. This species already possessed dicondylic mandibles (two articulations in the mandible), a feature associated with winged insects, suggesting that wings may already have evolved at this time. Thus, the first insects probably appeared earlier, in the Silurian period.|$|E
5|$|The {{series is}} {{described}} by its creators as a sequel to the novella Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, rather than an adaptation of it, with the Robert Louis Stevenson tale serving as a backstory within the series. It stars James Nesbitt as Tom Jackman, <b>a</b> <b>modern-day</b> descendant of Dr. Jekyll, who has recently begun transforming into a version of Mr. Hyde (also played by Nesbitt). Jackman is aided by psychiatric nurse Katherine Reimer, played by Michelle Ryan. Gina Bellman also appears as Claire, Tom's wife.|$|E

5|$|The {{status of}} the {{treaties}} was questioned by the United Nations Secretariat in 1950, but <b>a</b> <b>modern-day</b> Chairman-Rapporteur of the UN Working Group on Minorities subsequently advised that no competent UN organ had made any decision which that extinguish the obligations under those instruments.

5|$|A {{tropical}} depression was first detected {{east of the}} Lesser Antilles on September 7, though at the time weather observations in the area were sparse. The disturbance gradually intensified throughout much of its early formative stages, attaining tropical storm strength on September 10; further strengthening into a hurricane north of Puerto Rico occurred two days later. Shortly thereafter, the hurricane recurved northward, and reached peak intensity the following day as <b>a</b> <b>modern-day</b> Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (160 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of at least 988 mbar (hPa; 29.18 inHg). The cyclone steadily weakened thereafter before making landfall on Nova Scotia on September 17 with winds of 85 mph (135 km/h). Moving into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence later that day, the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. The remnant system curved eastward and passed over Newfoundland before dissipating over the Atlantic on September19.|$|E
