50|$|The {{body was}} aerodynamically shaped, with , while still seating four people. The bonnet, <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>arms</b> and wheel rims {{were made from}} SMC (Sheet Moulding Compound), the roof was made from resin between steel sheets and the windows were made from {{polycarbonate}} resin.|$|R
50|$|The {{cars in the}} Biturbo {{family were}} of unibody steel construction, with a {{conventional}} layout of front-longitudinally mounted engine and gearbox. Suspension was of the MacPherson strut type upfront and semi-trailing arms at the rear, with coil springs, double-acting dampers and anti-roll bars on both axles. The differential and <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>arms</b> were supported by a subframe.|$|R

50|$|Like the Biturbos, the Ghibli had unibody steel construction, with a {{conventional}} layout of longitudinally mounted engine, rear-wheel drive. Suspension {{was of the}} MacPherson strut type at the front and semi-trailing arms at the rear, with coil springs, double-acting dampers and anti-roll bars on both axles. The differential and <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>arms</b> were supported by a bushing-insulated subframe. Brakes were vented discs on all four wheels, and steering was servo-assisted rack and pinion.|$|R
50|$|The Traxxas Bandit {{was first}} {{introduced}} in 1995 and is Traxxas' 1/10 scale two-wheel drive buggy. It shares most of its parts with the Rustler, including the central chassis, motor, speed controls, transmission (albeit with a different gear ratio), rear shocks and shock tower, and radio system. The differences include shorter front and <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>arms,</b> camber and steering links, buggy style smaller diameter and narrower wheels and tires, and a buggy style body with rear wing.|$|R
5000|$|... {{independent}} {{coil spring}} <b>suspension</b> front and <b>rear.</b> Unlike the Ace and Aceca the <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> used semi-trailing <b>arms.</b>|$|R
50|$|Team Losi's first vehicle, the JR-X2, was a 1/10 Scale 2wd Off-Road racing buggy. When it was {{released}} to the public in 1988, the JRx-2 featured many innovations that were unheard of at the time, from its unique 5-link <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>arms,</b> carbon-graphite chassis, and all-natural rubber racing tires, the JRx-2 set the stage for technological advancement and innovation. The car, while winning some large races, never lived up to its billing. Some said that the car's innovative <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> system was too difficult to tune and resulted in delays for Team Losi to release the vehicle. These delays allowed Team Associated additional time to release its second version of the RC-10, which again gave two wheel drive electric dominance back to Team Associated.|$|R
50|$|The {{passenger}} cell of the 7 Series {{is made of}} carbon-fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP), tensile steel and aluminium, resulting in a lower kerb weight, lower center of gravity and maintaining a 50/50 axle load distribution. The usage of CFRP allows for weight reduction due to being lighter than steel and aluminium. CFRP also increases structural strength in areas exposed to high steering forces, as {{it is capable of}} diverting impact forces to prevent deformations of the material, resulting in higher torsional rigidity. Aluminium has been applied to the doors, bootlid, brake system, wheel hubs and <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>arms,</b> further reducing weight and unsprung masses. The G11 body weighs overall 40 kg less than that of its predecessor.|$|R
50|$|The {{suspension}} was redesigned using {{coil springs}} instead of torsion bars, {{the first major}} engineering changes since the original 911. The front suspension used MacPherson struts, {{a system that has}} continued for all subsequent versions, but the <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> retained semi-trailing <b>arms.</b>|$|R
40|$|This report {{examines}} the mechanical {{design of the}} University of Canterbury Mark II Electric Town Car. An interconnected suspension system is proposed and analysed in some detail. The selection of suspension geometry to incorporate anti-dive and to restrict body roll is discussed and the <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> trailing <b>arms</b> are analysed. The general layout features a backbone chassis with batteries between the front wheels and beneath the front passengers, with the electric motors and <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> beneath the rearward facing rear passengers. Two alternative methods of construction are proposed and discussed, including the adaption of the A 40 Farina bodywork...|$|R
50|$|A widened {{version of}} the E30 front {{suspension}} and the drivetrain from the E30 325i {{were used in the}} BMW Z1 roadster. The BMW Z3 (E36/4) and BMW Compact (E36/5) <b>rear</b> <b>suspensions</b> are also very similar to the E30, but utilizing five-lug hubs. The BMW M Coupe uses a widened {{version of the}} same <b>rear</b> semi-trailing <b>arm</b> <b>suspension.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The 1960 Corvair 569 [...] and 769 series four-door sedans were {{conceived}} as economy cars offering few amenities {{to keep the}} price competitive, with the 500 (standard model) selling for under $2,000. Powered by the Turbo Air 6 engine [...] and three-speed manual or optional extra cost two-speed Powerglide automatic transmission, the Corvair was designed to have comparable acceleration to the six-cylinder full-size Chevrolet Biscayne. The Corvair's unique design included the [...] "Quadri-Flex" [...] independent suspension and [...] "Unipack Power Team" [...] of engine, transmission and rear axle combined into a single unit. Similar to designs of European cars such as Porsche, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and others, [...] "Quadri-Flex" [...] used coil springs at all four wheels with independent <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>arms</b> incorporated at the rear. [...] Specially designed 6.5 in by 13 in. 4-ply tires mounted on 13inch wheels with 5.5 in. width were standard equipment. [...] Available options included RPO 360, the Powerglide two-speed automatic transmission ($146), RPO 118, a Gasoline Heater ($74), RPO 119, an AM tube radio ($54), and by February 1960 the rear folding seat (formerly $32) was standard. Chevrolet produced 47,683 of the 569 model and 139,208 769 model deluxe sedans in 1960.|$|R
50|$|Motorcycle {{production}} {{continued into}} World War II and {{was extended to}} generators. In 1948, {{not long after the}} war, Douglas was in difficulty again and reduced its output to the 350 cc flat twin models. The first of these models designated the T35 {{was one of the first}} production motorcycles to be fitted with <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> (swinging <b>arm)</b> unique in that the spinging medium was a longitudinal torsion bar. The 1955 350 cc Douglas Dragonfly was the last model produced. The Westinghouse Brake and Signal Company Ltd bought Douglas out and production of Douglas Motorcycles ended in 1957.|$|R
5000|$|The 2005 RL car {{structure}} made {{extensive use}} of somewhat [...] "exotic" [...] materials for a car at this price point. These included aluminum alloy in the hood, front fenders, trunk lid and frame, front and <b>rear</b> subframes, <b>suspension</b> <b>arms,</b> front knuckles and bumper beams. Magnesium {{was used in the}} intake manifold, and the two-piece center drive shaft was made of a carbon reinforced composite. The new RL featured extensive aerodynamic design treatment including details such as industry-first flush side glass, plus underbody covers and diffusers to reduce lift, resulting in a very low drag coefficient of 0.29.|$|R

50|$|Bill Porterfield, {{a former}} Oldsmobile engineer, was {{responsible}} for the record breaking car. Later, he was the design engineer at GM for the Pontiac Fiero. He used a custom tubular frame built by his company Mid-Engineering. This special chassis utilized the Oldsmobile Toronado Turbo-Hydamatic 425 transaxle behind a 700 hp Chevrolet ZL-1, 454 big-block motor. The Mid-Engineering chassis used Chevrolet Corvette <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>arms</b> and custom half shafts to allow wide performance tires. To put this accomplishment into perspective one should consider that it took Ferrari until March 1987 to come out with a 200 mph street legal sports car, the Ferrari F40. The F40 was a low production volume special which was not a mainstream Ferrari. Just a few months later Road and Track tested several specialty sports cars. The Ruf CTR Porsche 911 Yellow Bird and the Koenig RS Porsche 911; which, broke 200 mph. These two ran at 211 and 201 mph, respectively. Again, these were low volume custom sports cars. In these same tests, which were completed by Road and Track, with Le Mans winning Paul Frere and F1 champ Phil Hill driving, the Ferrari Testarossa, Lamborghini Countach 5000S and AMG Hammer Mercedes-Benz 300E all failed to break 200 mph.|$|R
5000|$|The {{team was}} forced to {{withdraw}} from the second pre-season test in Barcelona when Romain Grosjean complained about a [...] "strange" [...] feeling in the chassis while driving on the opening morning of the test. The team gave no official diagnosis of the problem at the time, but speculation within the media suggested the problem was related to the front suspension and that the problem presented itself at the Circuit de Catalunya because of the higher lateral loads placed on the chassis at the circuit than those experienced at Jerez. James Allison, the team's technical director, later confirmed that the team had identified the problem as being the mounting of the upper front wishbone on the <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>arm.</b> Grosjean had been testing the chassis designated E20-02 at the time; the chassis E20-01 was returned to the team's Enstone facility following completion of testing at Jerez. Upon discovering the problem, Lotus initially prepared chassis E20-01 to be transported to Barcelona to complete the test, but simulations revealed that the problem was also present on E20-01, and so the team decided {{to withdraw from the}} remainder of the test with immediate effect. The problem was then corrected in time for the team to start the season.|$|R
50|$|For better handling, it had MacPherson struts {{up front}} with {{multi-link}} <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> (with parallel <b>arms).</b> This independent setup combined with the longer wheelbase gave good comfort on the highway, and a pretty good grip for aggressive cornering. For many Preseas, the car was endowed with a ventilated front disc brakes with a single large piston. The rear brakes were either a solid disc brake or a semi-trailing drum brakes with self-adjusting shoes.|$|R
50|$|Designed in 1984, the R129 {{was based}} on the {{shortened}} floorpan of the Mercedes-Benz W124 and featured many innovative details for the time, for instance electronically controlled damping (Adaptive Damping System ADS, optional) and a hidden, automatically extending roll-over bar. The R107's somewhat dated <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> with semi-trailing <b>arms</b> gave way to a modern multi-link axle. The number of standard features was high, with electric action for the windows, mirrors, seats and hydraulic convertible top.|$|R
50|$|MAC {{production}} restarted {{after the}} war. In 1948 the MAC's girder forks were replaced with innovative air-sprung Dowty Oleomatic forks. In 1951 these were upgraded to Veloce 'tele forks' which were {{developed for the}} Velocette LE. These had coil springs with damping. In the same year the engine was upgraded to an alloy barrel and head with wider fins to improve cooling. For the 1953 the MAC was updated with fully adjustable <b>rear</b> <b>suspension,</b> swinging <b>arm</b> and a tube frame. The clutch and gearbox were also greatly improved. From 1954 the MAC was sold as a sidecar machine to try to broaden the appeal but production was halted by 1960. The company had invested Â£50,000 developing the Velocette Viceroy scooter and, despite continued sales of the singles, Velocette became insolvent.|$|R
50|$|Although still {{produced}} in Japan by Subaru, Saab appointed Michael Mauer to commission the redesign of the front- and rear styling to better integrate the contrived Saab with the brand's own design language. This totally restyled front fascia included new fenders and hood, with the rear gaining a redesigned tailgate and bumper. The interior received extra acoustic insulation over the Subaru, with particular {{attention paid to}} the firewall, carpeting, roof, and rear window seals. The majority of {{the interior of the}} 9-2x is identical to the Impreza wagon with just a few changes. Saab opted to offer a 2-tone seat design based on the earlier second gen Impreza wagon, as well as use the less flashy instrument cluster from the earlier second gen Impreza. Saab also specified their own front seats incorporate active head restraints, unlike the fixed headrest seats in the equivalent Impreza WRX. The <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> <b>arms</b> are in aluminum, with further reduction of unsprung weight achieved by using plastic in place of heavier components, bushings unique to the Saab, and the dampers recalibrated. The steering had been made more responsive and exact in the Aero by using the steering rack shared by the STI version of the WRX, which features a faster 15.0:1 steering ratio, more rigidly mounted steering hardware and stiffer chassis bushings. The 9-2X is not particularly popular with Saab brand loyalists {{for the fact that the}} changes from the Subaru are mostly cosmetic. The 9-2X also won the highest IIHS safety awards.|$|R
50|$|Despite being {{a modest}} car, the Civic is popular as a {{platform}} for modification and customization by the enthusiast community. Starting with the fourth generation and continuing through the 2000 model year, Civics had front double wishbone <b>suspension</b> and <b>rear</b> semi-trailing <b>arm</b> <b>suspension.</b> Ready parts interchangeability allows easy engine swaps (primarily with more powerful B16A (Civic SI), B18C (Acura Integra GSR), and various K20 Civic motors) and many other upgrades.|$|R
50|$|The front {{suspension}} initially had outboard {{springs and}} shock absorbers, but with later versions, this was moved inboard with a rocker <b>arm</b> upper <b>suspension</b> <b>arm.</b> There were {{two types of}} <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> offered: one with a live axle, located by trailing arms, leading arms and a panhard rod. The other had independent <b>rear</b> <b>suspension.</b>|$|R

Chevrolet produced 47,683 of the 569 model and 139,208 769 model deluxe sedans in 1960.In January 1960, two two-door coupe models were introduced designated as the 527 and 727 models. Following {{the success of the}} upmarket [...] "Mr. and Mrs. Monza" [...] styling concept cars at the 1960 Chicago Auto Show, management approved the neatly appointed bucket-seat DeLuxe trim of the 900 series Monza as a two door club coupe only. This model began arriving at showroom floors in April 1960. Despite their late January introduction of the coupe, these cars sold well; about 14,628 base model 527 coupes, 36,562 727 deluxe coupes and 11,926 927 Monza club coupes, making the coupe {{one of the most popular}} Corvairs.|$|R
5000|$|All E36 saloons, coupes, and estates {{employed}} the [...] "Z-axle" [...] multilink <b>suspension</b> in the <b>rear</b> {{which had been}} proven in the Z1. The hatchback body style (known as the [...] "E36/5" [...] or [...] "BMW Compact") used a <b>rear</b> semi-trailing <b>arm</b> <b>suspension</b> based on the older E30 (also found in the Z3 and M Coupe), instead of the [...] "Z-Axle" [...] Multilink employed in all other E36's. This was done {{in order to save}} space due to its truncated rear end.|$|R
50|$|Suspension was {{the major}} cause of concern in this car. The soft <b>rear</b> <b>suspension,</b> while giving a good ride, had a problem of {{bottoming}} out on sharp bumps. The multi-link set up was highly prone for misalignment and changing the <b>suspension</b> <b>arms</b> is still a headache for mechanics.|$|R
50|$|The Chapman strut {{used the}} driveshafts as <b>suspension</b> <b>arms,</b> thus {{requiring}} only {{the weight of}} one component rather than two. Jaguar's patented independent <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> (IRS) similarly reduced unsprung mass by replacing the upper wishbone <b>arms</b> of the <b>suspension</b> with the drive shafts, as well as mounting the brakes inboard in some versions.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{the first}} two {{examples}} of Lotus 12 had De Dion <b>rear</b> <b>suspension,</b> it also introduced a new suspension configuration with {{what came to be}} called [...] "Chapman struts" [...] in the rear, essentially a MacPherson strut with a fixed length halfshaft with universal joints on the ends utilised as a <b>suspension</b> <b>arm.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Exeo also {{features}} the same multi link fully independent front and <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> as {{used on the}} Audi A4, again with light weight cast aluminium alloy front <b>suspension</b> <b>arms</b> and virtual steering axis uprights. [...] All models are equipped with ZF-supplied power steering, with some models having speed-sensitive 'servotronic' variable assistance.|$|R
40|$|Combining {{substructure}} {{and power}} flow theory, {{in this paper}} an external program is written to control MSC. Nastran solution process and the substructure frequency response are also formulated accordingly. Based on a simple vehicle model, characteristics of vibration, noise, and power flow are studied, respectively. After being compared with the result of conventional FEM (finite element method), the new method is confirmed to be feasible. When {{it comes to a}} vehicle with the problem of low-frequency noise, finite element models of substructures for vehicle body and chassis are established, respectively. In addition, substructure power flow method is also employed to examine the transfer characteristics of multidimensional vibration energy for the whole vehicle system. By virtue of the adjustment stiffness of drive shaft support and bushes at <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> lower <b>arm,</b> the vehicle interior noise is decreased by about 3 [*]dB when the engine speed is near 1050 [*]rpm and 1650 [*]rpm in experiment. At the same time, this method can increase the computation efficiency by 78 %, 38 %, and 98 % {{when it comes to the}} optimization of chassis structure, body structure, and vibration isolation components, respectively...|$|R
5000|$|One of the {{features}} that added to the roominess of the E30 was the suspension. The front MacPherson struts and <b>rear</b> semi-trailing <b>arm</b> <b>suspension</b> were a compact arrangement that left a lot of cabin and boot space for the car's overall size. The semi-trailing arms {{have been criticized for}} the dynamic toe & camber changes inherent to the suspension geometry, causing bump steer in hard cornering situations (such as racing and autocross). This has contributed to the E30 as having a reputation for [...] "tail happy" [...] handling, where rear grip is reduced in certain situations, leading to oversteer.|$|R
50|$|The AC Cobra is {{an example}} of a transverse, multi-leaf steel spring {{suspension}} that uses the leaf spring as the upper <b>suspension</b> <b>arm.</b> Alternatively, the 1963 Corvette's <b>rear</b> <b>suspension</b> {{is an example}} where the transverse leaf spring is used only as a ride spring. In both examples the leaf spring is centrally mounted, preventing displacement of the wheel on one side from affecting the wheel on the other side.|$|R
50|$|Based, as they were, on the Fiat Group's Tipo Due (Type Two) platform, the 145 and 146 had a unibody structure, front MacPherson strut and <b>rear</b> {{trailing}} <b>arm</b> <b>suspensions.</b> A peculiarity {{of these}} cars {{is that they}} were designed to be fitted with both longitudinal engines (the older Boxers) and with transverse engines (the diesels and the Twin Spark). The former were mounted in the same configuration as on the 33 or Alfasud, that is longitudinally overhanging the front axle with the gearbox towards the cabin; the latter in the conventional transverse position with the gearbox to the left side. All engines were coupled to 5-speed manual transmissions.Steering was rack and pinion, with standard hydraulic power assistance.|$|R
