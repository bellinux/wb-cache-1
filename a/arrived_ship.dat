Bok angrily shouts that ship in question was Ferengi. The ship is identified as the U.S.S. Stargazer, Picard's former command. Bok explains that he found the ship as a derelict and offers it to Picard for free. Picard explains that at Maxia, the Stargazer was heavily damaged before Picard executed an action which would {{come to be known as}} the [...] "Picard Maneuver". Using the warp drive, Picard ordered a short warp jump directly resulting in the enemy vessel's light speed based sensors briefly detecting the ship in two places at once and allowing Picard to win the battle. Due to the damage, the crew of the Stargazer abandoned ship after the battle.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Contemporary {{maritime}} piracy around the Horn of Africa presents {{a serious threat}} to the global shipping industry. A number of countermeasures were deployed to minimize the probability of a successful hijack, one of them being the establishment of the International Recommended Transit Corridor (IRTC). Currently, all ships transiting the Gulf of Aden are strongly recommended to follow the IRTC and take part in group transit schemes—prescribed schedules stating time of arrival {{to the beginning of the}} corridor and speed at which to sail through the corridor. These schedules are fixed in advance and do not take into account speeds and constraints of <b>arriving</b> <b>ships.</b> We propose dynamic grouping schemes, customized schedules for a group of <b>arriving</b> <b>ships,</b> which take into account speeds as well as positions of <b>arriving</b> <b>ships.</b> The problem of finding optimum grouping scheme for a group of <b>arriving</b> <b>ships</b> is formulated as a bi-objective mixed integer program, weighting the delay caused by the grouping scheme and the risk taken when sailing alone. We look for a set of Pareto optimal solutions and compare the dynamic grouping scheme with currently deployed fixed scheme. Results show an improvement over current grouping scheme with respect to the number of ships grouped as well as time saved.

50|$|On May 16, Boston {{with the}} Swedish frigate Fröja managed to chase down a Tripolitan corsair (a ship owned and staffed by Muslim Slave Traders), {{disabling}} it by forcing it to beach itself. Six other corsairs then sortied from the harbor {{in an attempt}} to screen the first one. The American and Swedish frigates managed to deter their attempts until another ship arrived in the harbor. The Swedish frigate began bombarding the harbor fortifications while Boston left to meet the new vessel. This gave the corsairs an opportunity to make another attempt at assisting the beached vessel. Shortly thereafter Boston realized that the newly <b>arrived</b> <b>ship</b> was merely another Swedish frigate. Realizing his mistake, Captain McNeil turned his ship around and engaged the Tripolitan ships once more firing several broadsides into them and damaging several. The action then concluded with the three frigates resuming their blockade stations having taken no damage while inflicting several losses on the enemy.|$|E

5000|$|The {{most famous}} of those edicts was the {{so-called}} Sakoku Edict of 1635. It contained the main restrictions introduced by Iemitsu. With it, he forbade every Japanese ship and person to travel to another country, or to return to Japanese shores. The punishment for violation was death. The edict offered lavish gifts and awards for anyone who could provide information about priests and their followers who secretly practiced and spread their religion across the country. Furthermore, every newly <b>arrived</b> <b>ship</b> was required to be thoroughly examined for Catholic priests and followers. The document pays extremely close attention to every detail regarding incoming foreign ships. For example, merchants coming from abroad had to submit {{a list of the}} goods they were bringing with them before being granted permission to trade. Additional provisions specified details of the timing and logistics of trade. For example, one clause declares that the [...] "date of departure homeward for foreign ships shall not be later than the twentieth day of the ninth month". In addition to this, Iemitsu forbade alterations of the set price for raw silk and thus made sure that competition between trading cities was brought to a minimum.|$|E
50|$|These {{archives}} {{studied by}} Aroles himself {{suggest that the}} only feral child to have survived in the forests {{for as long as}} ten years without irreversible deterioration of body or mind was possibly an Amerindian of the 'Renards' or 'Fox' people. She was brought to France from Canada most likely as a servant or a slave by a lady who unfortunately <b>arrived</b> <b>ship</b> in Marseille during the bubonic plague epidemic in Provence in 1720.Having escaped the plague that should have killed her, Aroles speculates that Marie-Angélique walked thousands of kilometers through the forests of the kingdom of France before being captured in 1731 in the province of Champagne in a state of savagery. During these ten years, he imagines that she did not live with wolves, but survived them by resisting their attacks with a wooden club and another weapon long stick with a sharp metal tip that she either found or stole. When she was captured, this black-skinned, hairy and clawed huntress was showing some characteristics of regression (she knelt down to drink water and had regular sideways eye movements, similar to nystagmus, the result of a life lived in a state of permanent alertness). However, this girl overcame an extreme challenge harder than the cold, wolves, or hunger: she recovered the faculty of human speech after ten years of mutism.Despite Aroles' speculation that she was 19 years old when she was captured, a printed text Histoire d’une jeune fille sauvage claimed that she was ten. Her intellectual rebirth was important: she learned to read and write, became a nun for a time in a royal abbey, became destitute, was rescued financially by the Queen of France (spouse of Louis XV), maintained her dignity in the face of her long battle with an illness, and died relatively wealthy, as the inventory of her goods shows.The Scottish philosopher Monboddo, who interviewed Marie-Angélique in 1765, considered her to be the most extraordinary person of his time. However, this woman was forgotten; she disappears, for more than two centuries, behind all the heroines of fiction.|$|E

40|$|When {{it comes}} to {{inspections}} in invasive species management, the literature has shown that there is frequently a tension between economic cost reduction and inspection stringency.
