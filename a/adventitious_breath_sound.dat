40|$|To analyse the {{sensitivity}} and specificity of clinical indicators of ineffective airway clearance in children with congenital heart disease and to identify the indicators that have high predictive power. The precise establishment of nursing diagnoses {{has been found to}} be one of the factors contributing to higher quality of care and cost reduction in healthcare institutions. The use of indicators to diagnose ineffective airway clearance could improve care of children with congenital heart disease. Longitudinal study. Participants consisted of 45 children, <= 1 year of age, with congenital heart disease, who had not had definitive or palliative surgical correction. Six assessments were made at 2 -day intervals. Each clinical indicator was defined based on previously established operational criteria. Sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values of each indicator were calculated based on a model for the longitudinal data. A nursing diagnosis of ineffective airway clearance was made in 31 % of patients on the first assessment, rising to 71 % on the last assessment, for a 40 % increase. Sensitivity was highest for Changes in Respiratory Rates/Rhythms (0. 99), followed by <b>Adventitious</b> <b>Breath</b> <b>Sounds</b> (0. 97), Sputum Production (0. 85) and Restlessness (0. 53). Specificity was higher for Sputum Production (0. 92), followed by Restlessness (0. 73), <b>Adventitious</b> <b>Breath</b> <b>Sounds</b> (0. 70) and Changes in Respiratory Rates/Rhythms (0. 17). The best positive predictive values occurred for Sputum Production (0. 93) and <b>Adventitious</b> <b>Breath</b> <b>Sounds</b> (0. 80). <b>Adventitious</b> <b>Breath</b> <b>Sounds</b> followed by Sputum Production were the indicators that had the best overall {{sensitivity and specificity}} as well as the highest positive predictive values. The use of simple indicators in nursing diagnoses can improve identification of ineffective airway clearance in children with congenital heart disease, thus leading to early treatment of the problem and better care for these children...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{identify}} {{the prevalence of}} nursing diagnoses: ineffective breathing pattern (IBP) (00032), ineffective airway clearance (IAC) (00031), impaired gas exchange (IGE) (00030) and impaired spontaneous ventilation (ISP) (00033), their defining characteristics and related factors, in children with acute respiratory infection. Methods: A quantitative, transversal approach with 151 children. Data were collected by means of interviews and pulmonary evaluation. For data analysis, we used descriptive and inferential statistics. Results: The most prevalent diagnosis was IBP. <b>Adventitious</b> <b>breath</b> <b>sounds</b> and ineffective cough were the most prevalent defining characteristics. <b>Adventitious</b> <b>breath</b> <b>sounds</b> increased by 80 % the chance for IAC. Among the related factors, the highlights were: secretions in the bronchi and retained secretions. Secretions in the bronchi favored in 80 % the occurrence of IBP and in 60 % of IAC.

In this pediatric case series we characterized CMV lung infection in 15 non-HIV infected children (median age 3 years; IQR 0. 2 – 4. 9 years), using current molecular and imaging diagnostic modalities, in combination with respiratory signs and symptoms. The most prominent clinical and laboratory findings included cough (100 %), hypoxemia (100 %), diffuse <b>adventitious</b> <b>breath</b> <b>sounds</b> (100 %) and increased respiratory effort (93 %). All patients had abnormal lung images characterized by ground glass opacity/consolidation in 80 % of cases.

CMV caused respiratory failure in 47 % of children infected and the overall mortality rate was 13. 3 %. Conclusion: CMV pneumonia is a potential lethal disease in non-HIV infected children that requires a high-index of suspicion. Common clinical and radiological patterns such as hypoxemia, diffuse adventitious lung sounds and ground-glass pulmonary opacities may allow early identification of CMV lung infection in the pediatric population, which may lead to prompt initiation of antiviral therapy and better clinical outcomes...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Spectral {{characteristics}} of <b>breath</b> <b>sounds</b> in asthma and {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) have not previously been compared, although the structural differences in these disorders might {{be reflected in}} <b>breath</b> <b>sounds.</b> METHODS [...] Flow standardised inspiratory <b>breath</b> <b>sounds</b> in patients with COPD (n = 17) and stable asthma (n = 10) with significant airways obstruction and in control patients without any respiratory disorders (n = 11) were compared in terms of estimates of the power spectrum. <b>Breath</b> <b>sounds</b> were recorded simultaneously at the chest and at the trachea. RESULTS [...] The median frequency (F 50) of the mean (SD) <b>breath</b> <b>sound</b> spectra recorded at the chest was higher in asthmatics (239 (19) Hz) than in both the control patients (206 (14) Hz) and the patients with COPD (201 (21) Hz). The total spectral power of <b>breath</b> <b>sounds</b> recorded at the chest in terms of root mean square (RMS) was higher in asthmatics than in patients with COPD. In patients with COPD the spectral parameters were not statistically different from those of control patients. The F 50 recorded at the trachea in the asthmatics was significantly related to forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) (r = - 0. 77), but this was not seen in the other groups. CONCLUSIONS [...] The observed differences in frequency content of <b>breath</b> <b>sounds</b> in patients with asthma and COPD may reflect altered sound generation or transmission due to structural changes of the bronchi and the surrounding lung tissue in these diseases.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether <b>breath</b> <b>sound</b> distribution maps can differentiate between patients with pneumonia or pleural effusion versus healthy controls. METHODS: We recorded <b>breath</b> <b>sounds</b> from 20 patients conventionally {{diagnosed as having}} pleural effusion, 20 patients conventionally diagnosed as having pneumonia, and 60 healthy controls, of whom 20 served as a learning sample. All subjects were examined with a computer-based multi-sensor <b>breath</b> <b>sound</b> mapping device that records, analyzes, and displays a dynamic map of <b>breath</b> <b>sound</b> distribution. The physicians who interpreted the <b>breath</b> <b>sound</b> images were first trained in identifying common characteristics of the images from the learning sample of normals. Then the images from the 40 patients and the 40 controls were interpreted as either normal or abnormal. RESULTS: In the normal images, {{the left and right}} lung images developed synchronously and had similar size, shape, and intensity. The sensitivity and specificity of blinded differentiation between normal and abnor-mal images when the physician interpreter did not know the patient’s workup were 82. 5 % and 80 %, respectively.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a dual {{approach to the}} study of <b>breath</b> <b>sounds</b> in singing, consisting of an acoustic analysis of <b>breath</b> <b>sounds,</b> and develop-ment of an automatic breath detection system. Previouswork on automatic breath detection were based on relatively simple features that were postu-lated to be relevant to the detection. In contrast, this study starts with a detailed acoustic analysis of <b>breath</b> <b>sounds,</b> with the aim to explore novel characteristics. The obtained results can be used to enhance the capability of automatic breath detection. The acoustic analysis used singing voice recordings of 18 singers with a total length of 128 mins (1488 breath events).

We developed new technology for analyzing <b>breath</b> <b>sounds</b> and assessed its clinical usefulness for monitoring asthmatic children. Methods: Eighty asthmatic children and 59 non-asthmatic children underwent <b>breath</b> <b>sound</b> analysis in an asymptomatic state. Their asthma control was assessed by the Asthma Control TestTM or Childhood ACTTM scores and divided into two groups, namely, well-controlled (perfect) (n = 19) and not well-controlled (not perfect) (n = 61). <b>Breath</b> <b>sounds</b> were recorded using two sensors, located on the right anterior chest and trachea. We calculated the acoustic transfer characteristics between the two points, which indicated the relationship between frequencies and attenuation during <b>breath</b> <b>sound</b> propagation. Two indices of sound parameters, the chest wall sound index (CWI) and the tracheal sound index (TRI), were calculated from the transfer characteristics and tracheal sounds. We also developed a new parameter, the <b>breath</b> <b>sound</b> index (BSI), on a 2 -dimensional diagram of CWI and TRI and tried to determine whether BSI may clarify asthma control better than CWI or TRI alone. Results: There {{was a significant difference}} in TRI and BSI between asthmatic and non-asthmatic children (p = 0. 007, p < 0. 001). There was a significant difference in CWI and TRI between the well-controlled and not-wellcontrolled groups (p < 0. 001). BSI discriminated between the two groups accurately (p < 0. 001). The sensitivity and specificity of BSI for asthma control were 83. 6 % and 84. 2 %, respectively.

40|$|The author {{studied the}} {{intensity}} and frequency content of <b>breath</b> <b>sounds</b> in sixteen patients with pulmonary emphysema as compared with those in normal controls. The patients were clinically diagnosed with pulmonary emphysema with moderate to severe obstructive ventilatory impairment (FEV 1 /FVC 50. 7 ± 10. 5 %) on pulmonary function test and with low attenuation area suggestive of emphysema on CT. Control subjects were eight non-smoking healthy men with normal pulmonary function test. Recording of <b>breath</b> <b>sounds</b> {{was done with the}} subjects in a sitting position for thirty seconds with various flow rates. Flow rate was measured by pneumotachometer via mouth. ECG was recorded simultaneously to eliminate contamination by heart sounds. The signals of <b>breath</b> <b>sounds</b> at six sites on the chest wall were through an amplifier and a band-pass filter (0. 1 to 2000 Hz), and digitized to be recorded on a personal computer with signal of flow rate and ECG. Power spectra of the <b>breath</b> <b>sounds</b> for inspiratory blocks of 102. 4 msec when the flow rate was 350 ml/sec (low flow rate) or 700 ml/sec (high flow rate) were obtained using fast Fourier transform. The segments which were contaminated by heart sounds and various noise were excluded by inspection of sound-spectrogram. Total power was calculated by the sum of power spectra within bandwidth of 100 - 2000 Hz. Parameters of F 25, F 50, F 75, F 95, and H/M power ratio (H : 400 ～ 800 Hz, M: 200 ～ 400 Hz) were calculated to quantify distribution of frequency spectra of <b>breath</b> <b>sounds.</b> Total power of <b>breath</b> <b>sounds</b> was increased･on upper lung fields at both flow rates and on lower lung fields at low flow rate as compared with those in normal controls. H/M ratio was increased on upper lung fields at both flow rates and on lower lung fields at high flow rate. F 95 was increased on both lung fields at high flow rate. In conclusion, at a given flow rate the <b>breath</b> <b>sounds</b> in a patient with emphysema do not decrease in intensity but may increase in frequency. This fact suggests that decreased <b>breath</b> <b>sounds</b> in patients with pulmonary emphysema is due to decreased flow rate...|$|R

Two new methods of <b>breath</b> <b>sounds</b> measurement have been studied: laser Doppler vibrometer and mobile phones. It has been shown that these two methods can find applications in <b>breath</b> <b>sounds</b> measurement, however there are some restrictions. A reliable automatic wheeze detection algorithm based on auditory modelling has been developed. That is the human’s auditory system is modelled as a bank of band pass filters, in which the bandwidths are frequency dependent. Wheezes are treated as signals additive to normal <b>breath</b> <b>sounds</b> (masker). Thus wheeze is detectable when it is above the masking threshold. This new algorithm has been validated using simulated and real data. It is superior to previous algorithms, being more reliable to detect wheezes and less prone to mistakes. Simulation of cardiorespiratory sounds and wheeze audibility tests have been developed. Simulated <b>breath</b> <b>sounds</b> {{can be used as a}} training tool, as well as an evaluation method. These simulations have shown that, under certain circumstance, there are wheezes but they are inaudible. It is postulated that this could also happen in real measurements. It has been shown that simulated sounds with predefined characteristics can be used as an objective method to evaluate automatic algorithms. Finally, the efficiency and necessity of heart sounds reduction procedures has been investigated. Based on wavelet decomposition and selective synthesis, heart sounds can be reduced with a cost of unnatural <b>breath</b> <b>sounds.</b> Heart sound reduction is shown not to be necessary if a time-frequency representation is used, as heart sounds have a fixed pattern in the time-frequency plane.
