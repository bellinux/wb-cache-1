5|$|Calling <b>a</b> <b>correct</b> letter earns {{the value}} before the {{corresponding}} flipper, {{multiplied by the}} number of times that the letter appears in the puzzle. Calling <b>a</b> <b>correct</b> letter keeps the wheel in the contestant's control, allowing the contestant to spin again, buy a vowel for a flat rate of $250, or attempt to solve the puzzle. Contestants may continue to buy vowels so long as they have enough money to keep doing so, until all of the vowels in the puzzle have been revealed. Control passes to the next contestant clockwise if the wheel lands on Lose a Turn or Bankrupt, if the contestant calls a letter that is not in the puzzle, calls a letter that has already been called in that round, fails to call a letter within five seconds of the wheel stopping, or attempts unsuccessfully to solve the puzzle. The only exception is the Free Play wedge, on which the contestant may call a consonant for $500 per occurrence, call a free vowel, or solve the puzzle, with no penalty for an incorrect letter or answer.|$|E

5|$|Partly {{because of}} {{theoretical}} and mathematical difficulties {{and partly because}} of the extremely high energies (beyond what is technologically possible for the foreseeable future) needed to test these theories experimentally, there is so far no experimental evidence that would unambiguously point to any of these models being <b>a</b> <b>correct</b> fundamental description of nature.

Stefanski (1989) showed there does not exist <b>a</b> <b>corrected</b> likelihood score for the logistic model with normal additive measurement error. To circumvent this result, an approximate likelihood score is defined for the logistic model that is conceptually and computationally straightforward and that is nearly efficient {{in the absence of}} measurement error. It is shown that the approximate likelihood score admits <b>a</b> <b>corrected</b> score. The results are extended to the Probit regression model. ...|$|R

5|$|Contestants' {{responses}} are revealed {{in order of}} their pre-Final Jeopardy! scores from lowest to highest. <b>A</b> <b>correct</b> response adds {{the amount of the}} contestant's wager to his/her score, while a miss, failure to respond, or failure to phrase the response as a question (even if correct) deducts it. The contestant with the highest score {{at the end of the}} round is that day's winner. If there is a tie for second place, consolation prizes are awarded based on the scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round. If all three contestants finish with $0, no one returns as champion for the next show, and based on scores going into the Final Jeopardy! round, the two contestants who were first and second will receive the second-place prize, and the contestant in third will receive the third-place prize.|$|E
5|$|In 1895 and 1897, Cantor {{published}} a two-part paper in Mathematische Annalen under Felix Klein's editorship; these were his last significant papers on set theory. The first paper begins by defining set, subset, etc., {{in ways that}} would be largely acceptable now. The cardinal and ordinal arithmetic are reviewed. Cantor wanted the second paper to include a proof of the continuum hypothesis, but had to settle for expositing his theory of well-ordered sets and ordinal numbers. Cantor attempts to prove that if A and B are sets with A equivalent to a subset of B and B equivalent to a subset of A, then A and B are equivalent. Ernst Schröder had stated this theorem a bit earlier, but his proof, as well as Cantor's, was flawed. Felix Bernstein supplied <b>a</b> <b>correct</b> proof in his 1898 PhD thesis; hence the name Cantor–Bernstein–Schröder theorem.|$|E

5|$|One {{important}} {{example of}} a matrix model is the BFSS matrix model proposed by Tom Banks, Willy Fischler, Stephen Shenker, and Leonard Susskind in 1997. This theory describes {{the behavior of a}} set of nine large matrices. In their original paper, these authors showed, among other things, that the low energy limit of this matrix model is described by eleven-dimensional supergravity. These calculations led them to propose that the BFSS matrix model is exactly equivalent to M-theory. The BFSS matrix model can therefore be used as a prototype for <b>a</b> <b>correct</b> formulation of M-theory and a tool for investigating the properties of M-theory in a relatively simple setting.|$|E
5|$|Regardless {{of whether}} Calabi–Yau compactifications of string theory provide <b>a</b> <b>correct</b> {{description}} of nature, {{the existence of}} the mirror duality between different string theories has significant mathematical consequences. The Calabi–Yau manifolds used in string theory are of interest in pure mathematics, and mirror symmetry allows mathematicians to solve problems in enumerative algebraic geometry, a branch of mathematics concerned with counting the numbers of solutions to geometric questions. A classical problem of enumerative geometry is to enumerate the rational curves on a Calabi–Yau manifold such as the one illustrated above. By applying mirror symmetry, mathematicians have translated this problem into an equivalent problem for the mirror Calabi–Yau, which turns out to be easier to solve.|$|E

5|$|The Court {{supported}} this interpretation by {{recognizing that the}} First Amendment sought to prevent government actions from discouraging protected activity. Citing Branti v.

Because employees thinking of engaging in protected activity will be equally dissuaded by an incorrect dismissal as by <b>a</b> <b>correct</b> dismissal, both reasonings {{should be considered in}} violation of the First Amendment.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} {{philosophy}} of science trace back to Plato and Aristotle who distinguished {{the forms of}} approximate and exact reasoning, set out the threefold scheme of abductive, deductive, and inductive inference, and also analyzed reasoning by analogy. The eleventh century Arab polymath Ibn al-Haytham (known in Latin as Alhazen) conducted his research in optics by way of controlled experimental testing and applied geometry, especially in his investigations into the images resulting from the reflection and refraction of light. Roger Bacon (1214–1294), an English thinker and experimenter heavily influenced by al-Haytham, is recognized {{by many to be}} the father of modern scientific method. His view that mathematics was essential to <b>a</b> <b>correct</b> understanding of natural philosophy was considered to be 400 years ahead of its time.|$|E

If the chaser answers incorrectly or passes, the clock is stopped briefly and the team is given a chance to answer the question, which they may confirm among themselves before answering. <b>A</b> <b>correct</b> answer pushes the chaser back one space, or moves the team ahead by one if he has not moved on to the gameboard. An incorrect answer provides no movement for the chaser at all. Regardless of the outcome, the clock begins running again and the chaser continues to answer questions.

During celebrity episodes, if the chaser catches the team before time runs out, the team leaves with $15,000 divided equally.|$|E
