5|$|In order, therefore, to {{establish}} <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>point</b> of theory, {{and at the}} same time to prevent American chessplayers from being misled and deceived by the superficial analysis of incompetent British chess editors, whose object in condemning the Steinitz Gambit has obviously been mainly to depreciate the originality of its illustrious inventor, whom they invariably try to drag down to their own miserable level of shallow incompetency and self-conceit, I submit the following variations which at any rate possess the undeniable merit of exposing the hollow analytical twaddle continually published in the two London journals above named.|$|E
5|$|In the end {{the fines}} were never paid, and the lands were soon restored. Edward had {{nevertheless}} demonstrated <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>point.</b> After the conquest of Wales, the strategic position of the Marcher lordships was less vital to the English crown, and the liberty awarded to the Marcher lords could be curtailed. For Edward this was therefore {{a good opportunity to}} assert the royal prerogative, and to demonstrate that it extended also into the Marches of Wales.|$|E
5|$|Pontecorvo's {{solution}} to the solar neutrino problem involved an idea that he had first considered in 1957, and developed over the following decade. This {{was the idea that}} neutrinos may convert into other types of neutrinos, a phenomenon known as neutrino oscillation. Somewhere between the Sun and the Earth, electron neutrinos might transform into muon neutrinos. <b>An</b> <b>important</b> <b>point</b> was that for this to happen, neutrinos could not have zero mass, and therefore could not travel at the speed of light. The existence of the oscillations was finally established by the Super-Kamiokande experiment in 1998 and later confirmed by other experiments.|$|E

5|$|The {{required}} causation may {{be quite}} oblique. As well as weaponry held in the hand, weaponry thrown is included, as is causing people to touch each other by creating a sense of panic. The general law on liability for omissions also applies to batteries, for example those of the continuing act (as in Fagan v MPC) and of a duty of care. However, in R v Ireland the court ruled out psychological injury {{by means of a}} telephone as a form of battery, although it was not <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>point</b> in the case as other charges were brought. Poisoning is not a battery where there is no accompanying violence.|$|E
5|$|The growing {{importance}} of royal {{art can be}} seen in the post of Painter and Limner, created in 1702 for George Ogilvie. The duties included drawing pictures of the Monarch's person, his successors and members of the royal family, for the decoation of royal houses and palaces. However, from 1723 to 1823 the office was a sinecure held by members of the Abercrombie family, not necessarily connected with artistic ability. Many painters of the early part of the eighteenth century remained largely artisans, like the members of the Norie family, James (1684–1757) and his sons, Robert and the younger James, who painted the houses of the peerage with Scottish landscapes that were capriccios or pastiches of Italian and Dutch landscapes. They tutored artists and have been credited with the inception of the tradition of Scottish landscape painting that would come to fruition from the late eighteenth century. Italy became <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>point</b> of reference for Scottish artists, with many taking the Grand Tour there to paint, sample the art and learn from Italian masters.|$|E

25|$|Port Royal {{is one of}} the area's more {{historic}} towns. It {{was first}} established in 1652 as a port on a navigable portion of the Rappahannock River during an era when waterways were the major method of transportation of people and property in the British Colony of Virginia.

25|$|The writing {{style of}} the lyrics is {{deliberately}} obscure; Oakey says this is because he wanted the band's lyrics to provoke thought and get people talking about their songs. Often the meanings behind the songs have only been disclosed by Oakey in various interviews given since the album's release. <b>An</b> <b>important</b> <b>point</b> is that the album essentially evolved during 1981 and wasn't written from a single conceptual starting point.|$|E
25|$|Fair {{trade in}} cocoa is <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>point</b> in the cocoa industry. Customers are more {{interested}} in fairly traded goods. Many will investigate in fair trade now to improve the conditions of farmers on cocoa plants. In 2016 it was reported that the chocolate producer Ferrero will further invest in fair trade; the plan is to double the amount of cocoa originating from fair trade in the upcoming 3 years. Ferrero wants to invest in 40.000 MT of fair trade cocoa till 2020.|$|E

He stopped at Mauritius, and on his own {{initiative}} picked up a battalion of soldiers stationed there. Knowing that the British forces at Ladysmith urgently needed more powerful guns, Captain Percy Scott from the Powerful's sister ship, the cruiser HMS Terrible, devised carriages to transport naval cannon, and Lambton then led a naval brigade to the rescue with four 12-pounders and two other guns.|$|E

25|$|In {{an attempt}} to expand the borders of colonial Brazil and profit from the silver mines of Potosí, the Portuguese Overseas Council (the Conselho Ultramarino) ordered colonial {{governor}} Manuel Lobo to establish a settlement {{on the shore of}} the River Plate, in a region that legally belonged to Spain. In 1679, Manuel Lobo founded Colonia de Sacramento on the margin opposite to Buenos Aires. The fortified settlement quickly became <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>point</b> of illegal commerce between the Spanish and Portuguese colonies. Spain and Portugal fought over the enclave on several occasions (1681, 1704, 1735).|$|E
25|$|In the US, the homeownership rate {{is created}} through the Housing Vacancy Survey by the US Census Bureau. It {{is created by}} {{dividing}} the owner occupied units {{by the total number}} of occupied units. This is <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>point</b> to understand changes in the homeownership rate over time. The bust of the housing bubble resulted in many houses becoming foreclosed. However, the decrease in the homeownership rate from 3Q2007 to 4Q2007 was mostly a result of an increase in the renter's population and less due to a decrease in the homeowner population.|$|E
25|$|There is an {{important}} evolution of coin shape (round to square) and material (from gold to silver to brass) across the territories and the periods, and from Greek type to Indian type {{over a period of}} nearly 3 centuries. Also, the quality of coinage illustration decreases down to the 1st century CE. Coinage evolution is <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>point</b> of Indo-Greek history, and actually {{one of the most important}} since most of these kings are only known by their coins, and their chronology is mainly established by the evolution of the coin types.|$|E

25|$|Sigmund Freud {{put forward}} {{the idea that}} {{symbolic}} communication {{does not depend on}} cultural history alone but also on the workings of the psyche. Thus Freud introduced a transhistorical and biological conception of man and a view of myth as an expression of repressed ideas. Dream interpretation is the basis of Freudian myth interpretation and Freud's concept of dreamwork recognizes the importance of contextual relationships for the interpretation of any individual element in a dream. This suggestion would find <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>point</b> of rapprochment between the structuralist and psychoanalytic approaches to myth in Freud's thought.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{political}} unit {{of ancient}} Ireland was the tuath. All “freemen” who owned land, all professionals, and all craftsmen, {{were entitled to}} become members of a tuath. Each tuath’s members formed an annual assembly which decided all common policies, declared war or peace on other tuatha, and elected or deposed their “kings.” <b>An</b> <b>important</b> <b>point</b> is that, in contrast to primitive tribes, no one was stuck or bound to a given tuath, either because of kingship or of geographical location. Individual members were free to, and often did, secede from a tuath and join a competing tuath.|$|E

Under Soviet rule, it was once a major junction on the Moscow-Tehran railway line {{as well as the}} Baku-Yerevan railway. It also served as an important strategic area during the Cold War, sharing borders with both Turkey (a NATO member state) and Iran (a close ally of the West until the Iranian Revolution of 1979).|$|E
