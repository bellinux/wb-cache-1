40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 91 - 94) This research presents three novel adaptive noise cancellation {{techniques for}} reducing periodic interferences, such as engines, blowers, compressors, and fans. (1) The sub-band two-model adaptive HR noise cancellation scheme structure enables {{the cancellation of}} multiple sinusoidal interferences in a received speech signal. Compared with the classical LMS adaptive noise cancellation method of B. Widrow et al., this new structure has two major differences. First, the quadrature mirror filter (QMF) banks {{have been used to}} decompose signals into sub-bands. Second, a new constrained time-varying HR notch filter and adaptive HR bandpass filter were developed to form a two-model adaptive HR noise canceller to remove the multi-rate noise from a received signal. Computer simulations were performed using a set of actual speech signals corrupted by car engine noise. Experiments demonstrated that more than 20 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvements have been achieved. (2) In the case that the reference signal is not available, a new noise control structure using a single-pulse excitation generator, the synchronous <b>adaptive</b> <b>noise</b> <b>control</b> with LPC noise synthesizer, was developed. The linear predictive coding (LPC) technique is employed along with the adaptive noise-cancelling technique to form this new structure. The comparison result shows that the proposed structure converges faster and has a better mean-squared error compared with Elliott and Darlington’s method, {{in which there is no}} LPC noise synthesizer involved. (3) An alternative structure, the synchronous <b>adaptive</b> <b>noise</b> <b>control</b> with multi-pulse excitation, using a multi-pulse generator is also presented. Because of the better exciting signal generated by the multi-pulse excitation generator, the LPC synthesizer can be removed to reduce the complexity. Due to the engine noise’s periodic and harmonic properties, the weighting process has been omitted to further reduce computation cost. A faster convergence rate and a more than 10 dB mean-squared error (MSE) improvement have been achieved by using the new structure, as compared with that of Elliott and Darlington. M. S.

Recently, a multichannel fast affine projection algorithm was introduced for active noise control, using a sliding window recursive leastsquares algorithm inside the affine projection algorithm.

The proposed method uses three <b>adaptive</b> filters; a <b>noise</b> <b>control</b> filter, a feedback path modeling (FBPM) filter, and a third filter. The third filter works on the principle of <b>adaptive</b> <b>noise</b> cancelation (ADNC) and its objective is to remove disturbance from the desired response of FBPM filter.

40|$|In {{arriving}} at the ideal filter transfer function for an active noise control system in a duct, {{the effect of the}} auxiliary sources (generally loudspeakers) on the waves generated by the primary source has invariably been neglected in the existing literature, implying a rigid wall or infinite impedance. The present paper presents a fairly general analysis of a linear one-dimensional noise control system by means of block diagrams and transfer functions. It takes into account the passive as well as active role of a terminal primary source, wall-mounted auxiliary source, open duct radiation impedance, and the effects of mean flow and damping. It is proved that the pressure generated by a source against a load impedance can be looked upon as a sum of two pressure waves, one generated by the source against an anechoic termination and the other by reflecting the rearward wave (incident on the source) off the passive source impedance. Application of this concept is illustrated for both the types of sources. A concise closed-form expression for the ideal filter transfer function is thus derived and discussed. Finally, the dynamics of an <b>adaptive</b> <b>noise</b> <b>control</b> system is discussed briefly, relating its standing-wave variables and transfer functions with those of the progressive-wave model presented here...|$|E
40|$|Noise {{control has}} {{generated}} increasing interest {{in recent years}} with increased concerns for environmental protection and industrial safety. The traditional method of noise reduction using absorbing materials and erected barriers works effectively only at middle and high frequencies. Thus, active method {{which is based on}} the principle of destructive interference between the primary noise source and the actively generated acoustic waves is introduced. This approach works best at low frequencies when the wavelength of noise is long compared to the dimensions of its surroundings. In many existing active control methods, noise is reduced in very limited locations or along a single direction. For example, in active noise control inside passenger cars, the system is designed to reduce road noise level at passengers' seat locations; in noise reduction inside a duct, noise is reduced along the path of the duct. However, in most applications, it is desirable to reduce noise in a specific 3 -D region. In view of this, a new model-based <b>adaptive</b> <b>noise</b> <b>control</b> system using loudspeaker array and error sensor array is developed in this thesis. First, open loop system transfer functions are designed using a theoretical propagation model. The transfer functions thus found are regarded as the nominal values for the complete system.

In addition, a linear predictor is introduced into the system for feedback control, thus input signal driving the secondary sources is obtained from the error signals. In this study, we concentrated on reduction of broadband noise with a maximum frequency of 1000 Hz. Theoretical and simulation results show that our approach is effective for noise reduction in three dimensional space.

40|$|Bearing fault {{detection}} {{is critical in}} preventing machine failure and ensuring machine is operating in optimal condition. However, the monitored bearing vibration signal is often corrupted by interference signals from other sources in the machine. <b>Adaptive</b> <b>noise</b> canceller {{can be used to}} extract the bearing signal from the corrupting interference signals, thus enable bearing {{fault detection}}. <b>Adaptive</b> <b>noise</b> canceller utilizing least mean square algorithm is also suitable for on-line monitoring because of its computational efficiency. The effectiveness of the <b>adaptive</b> <b>noise</b> canceller is <b>controlled</b> by its operating parameters: the transversal filter length and the step-size parameter. This thesis establishes the criteria in determining the proper operating parameters. The Akaike information criterion is used to obtain the transversal filter length because of the <b>adaptive</b> <b>noise</b> canceller's autoregressive structure. The adaptive filter weight fluctuations affect the performance of the <b>adaptive</b> <b>noise</b> canceller. The misadjustment positively correlates to the filter weight fluctuations. A small misadjustment value can be used to obtain the required step-size parameter to ensure the satisfactory performance of the <b>adaptive</b> <b>noise</b> canceller. A procedure to achieve zero settling time in on-line monitoring under the stationary environment is also illustrated in this thesis. Simulation and experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the <b>adaptive</b> <b>noise</b> canceller in bearing signal extraction. Inductive oil debris monitoring sensor is used to detect metal particles in the lubricating oil. However, the sensor is affected by the interfering vibration signal and the metal particle signatures can no longer be correctly detected from the resulting mixed signal. In order to obtain reliable metal particle counts and sizes, it is critical that the interfering vibration signal is removed. The metal particle signal in the oil debris monitoring signal is non-periodic and can be considered a broadband signal. Thus a special form of the <b>adaptive</b> <b>noise</b> canceller which does not require a separate reference input source can be used. A delay is incorporated to the collected signal to derive the reference input. A delay value longer than the length of the characteristic output signal sampling units is needed to achieve the decorrelation between the metal particle signal in the primary input and the metal particle signal in the reference input. The criteria to determine the operating parameters established in bearing fault detection application can also be implemented in oil debris monitoring application. Simulation and experiments are performed to verify that the <b>adaptive</b> <b>noise</b> canceller can effectively remove the interfering periodic signals and reveal the metal particle signal from the corrupted signal...|$|R

In our implementation, we achieve between 20 and 25 dB of cancellation of the 60 Hz noise component.
