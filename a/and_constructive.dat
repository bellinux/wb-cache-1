25|$|The Bs, irrational {{beliefs that}} are most {{important}} in the A-B-C model are explicit and implicit philosophical meanings and assumptions about events, personal desires, and preferences. The Bs, beliefs {{that are most}} significant are highly evaluative and consist of interrelated and integrated cognitive, emotional and behavioral aspects and dimensions. According to REBT, if a person's evaluative B, belief about the A, activating event is rigid, absolutistic, fictional and dysfunctional, the C, the emotional and behavioral consequence, {{is likely to be}} self-defeating and destructive. Alternatively, if a person's belief is preferential, flexible <b>and</b> <b>constructive,</b> the C, the emotional and behavioral consequence is likely to be self-helping <b>and</b> <b>constructive.</b>|$|E

25|$|Trusts may {{be created}} by the {{expressed}} intentions of the settlor (express trusts) or they may {{be created by}} operation of law known as implied trusts. An implied trust is one created by a court of equity because of acts or situations of the parties. Implied trusts are divided into two categories: resulting <b>and</b> <b>constructive.</b> A resulting trust is implied by the law to work out the presumed intentions of the parties, but it does not take into consideration their expressed intent. A constructive trust is a trust implied by law to work out justice between the parties, regardless of their intentions.|$|E

25|$|By then, France had {{established}} a field hospital at the area of Lake Kivu {{in an attempt to}} help the large numbers of refugees. Some of these refugees were Interahamwe leaders and members of the government who fled the country fearing retaliation from the RPF. To aid the ground forces, Israel conducted the largest medical mission in its history, and, although their supplies were not as abundant as those of the other forces, their all-volunteer force of military surgeons was composed both of specialists and sub-specialists, including well-known surgeons. The two units established a unique <b>and</b> <b>constructive</b> method of operation which relied on France's abundant medical supplies and Israel's medical expertise.|$|E
25|$|The REBT {{framework}} {{assumes that}} humans have both innate rational (meaning self-helping, socially helping, <b>and</b> <b>constructive)</b> and irrational (meaning self-defeating, socially defeating, and unhelpful) tendencies and leanings. REBT claims that {{people to a}} large degree consciously and unconsciously construct emotional difficulties such as self-blame, self-pity, clinical anger, hurt, guilt, shame, depression and anxiety, and behaviors and behavior tendencies like procrastination, compulsiveness, avoidance, addiction and withdrawal by the means of their irrational and self-defeating thinking, emoting and behaving. REBT is then applied as an educational process in which the therapist often active-directively teaches the client how to identify irrational and self-defeating beliefs and philosophies which in nature are rigid, extreme, unrealistic, illogical and absolutist, and then to forcefully and actively question and dispute them and replace them with more rational and self-helping ones. By using different cognitive, emotive and behavioral methods and activities, the client, together with help from the therapist and in homework exercises, can gain a more rational, self-helping <b>and</b> <b>constructive</b> rational way of thinking, emoting and behaving. One of the main objectives in REBT is to show the client that whenever unpleasant and unfortunate activating events occur in people's lives, they have a choice of making themselves feel healthily and self-helpingly sorry, disappointed, frustrated, and annoyed, or making themselves feel unhealthily and self-defeatingly horrified, terrified, panicked, depressed, self-hating and self-pitying. By attaining and ingraining a more rational and self-constructive philosophy of themselves, others and the world, people often are more likely to behave and emote in more life-serving and adaptive ways.|$|E
25|$|In that spirit, Nearing {{moved through}} a series of secessions—from Christianity, from politics, and finally from American society itself. He voyaged to the {{wilderness}} as if on a pilgrimage to a sacred place. His experience, along with a deeper understanding of American culture, led to the inescapable consciousness that capitalist cultural dominance was too strong to eliminate and therefore too powerful to control or mold to liberal purposes. The secessions in his life were progressive repudiations of American canons of moral conduct as well as indications of Nearing's perception of the fragmented, segmented, discontinuous nature of American society. Only in the isolated private sphere provided by homesteading could a radical resistance <b>and</b> <b>constructive</b> challenge to capitalist culture be nurtured.|$|E

25|$|Individual deists {{varied in}} the {{critical}} <b>and</b> <b>constructive</b> elements they argued for. Some rejected miracles and prophecies, but still considered themselves Christians because they believed in what they felt was the pure, original form of Christianitythat is, Christianity as it supposedly existed before it was corrupted by additions of such superstitions as miracles, prophecies, and {{the doctrine of the}} Trinity. Some deists rejected the claim of Jesus' divinity but continued to hold him in high regard as a moral teacher, a position known as Christian deism, exemplified by Thomas Jefferson's famous Jefferson Bible and Matthew Tindal's Christianity as Old as the Creation. Other, more radical deists rejected Christianity altogether and expressed hostility toward Christianity, which they regarded as pure superstition. In return, Christian writers often charged radical deists with atheism.|$|E

40|$|In this dissertation, I {{integrate}} management {{research on}} deviance, test theory relating to both <b>constructive</b> <b>and</b> destructive deviance, and examine {{forms of social}} influence affecting deviance in business organizations. ^ In Study 1, I examined the independent and joint contributions of social risk-taking <b>and</b> compensation-at-risk on <b>constructive</b> <b>and</b> destructive deviance among floor traders (N = 42). The {{results of this study}} provide important contributions to research on deviance by establishing that (1) social risk-taking, a dispositional factor, influences both <b>constructive</b> <b>and</b> destructive deviance, (2) compensation-at-risk, a situational factor, influences destructive deviance, (3) <b>constructive</b> <b>and</b> destructive deviance relate positively to work performance, <b>and</b> (4) <b>constructive</b> deviance relates positively to destructive deviance. ^ In Study 2, I examined the factors at the group level that hinder the influence of ethics initiatives on organization members. I studied 152 traders in 6 trading crowds on multiple financial exchanges and closely followed one trading crowd as it experienced an educational session on deviance from hypernorms. By observing a work group before, during, and after an educational session, I uncovered some of the hurdles associated with formal social control in a complex workplace where multiple groups exert social influence over the organization members. Using these data I propose a model and provide recommendations for future research and practice. ...|$|R
