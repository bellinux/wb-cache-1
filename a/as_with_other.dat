5|$|<b>As</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> {{passerine}} birds, parasites are common. 88% {{of common}} blackbirds {{were found to}} have intestinal parasites, most frequently Isospora and Capillaria species. and more than 80% had haematozoan parasites (Leucocytozoon, Plasmodium, Haemoproteus and Trypanosoma species).|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> ratites, emus have a {{relatively}} low basal metabolic rate compared to other types of birds. At , the metabolic rate of an emu sitting down is about 60% of that when standing, partly because the lack of feathers under the stomach leads to {{a higher rate of}} heat loss when standing from the exposed underbelly.|$|E

5|$|Adult birds may {{be killed}} by cats, little owls and sparrowhawks, and eggs and nestlings are taken by magpies, jays, and, where present, grey squirrels. <b>As</b> <b>with</b> <b>other</b> {{passerine}} birds, parasites are common, and include endoparasites, such as the nematode Splendidofilaria (Avifilaria) mavis whose specific name mavis derives from this thrush. A Russian study of blood parasites showed that all the fieldfares, redwings and song thrushes sampled carried haematozoans, particularly Haemoproteus and Trypanosoma. Ixodes ticks are also common, and can carry pathogens, including tick-borne encephalitis in forested areas {{of central and eastern}} Europe and Russia, and, more widely, Borrelia bacteria. Some species of Borrelia cause Lyme disease, and ground-feeding birds like the song thrush may act as a reservoir for the disease.|$|E
