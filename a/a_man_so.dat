5|$|In 2006 Shearer {{appeared}} with Brian Hayes in four episodes of the BBC Radio 4 sitcom Not Today, Thank You, playing Nostrils, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>so</b> ugly he cannot {{stand to be}} in his own presence. He was originally scheduled to appear in all six episodes but had to withdraw from recording two due to a problem with his work permit. On June 19, 2008, it was announced that Shearer would receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the radio category. The date of the ceremony where his star will be put in place has yet to be announced.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most of his}} noble relatives, John {{opposed the}} tyrannical regime of Andronikos I Komnenos (r. 1182–85), and {{had been forced to}} sign written pledge of loyalty to the emperor. Nevertheless, on 11 September 1185, when his nephew Isaac Angelos killed Andronikos I's chief henchman, Stephen Hagiochristophorites, and sought {{sanctuary}} in the Hagia Sophia cathedral, John and his eldest son Isaac rushed to his side, fearing the Emperor's retribution. By the next day, a popular uprising provoked by Isaac Angelos' act of defiance had brought down the regime of Andronikos I, but Isaac Angelos hesitated to be crowned emperor. According to Niketas Choniates and Theodore Skoutariotes, John then bared his own head and offered his own bald head to be crowned, but the assembled people violently opposed this, refusing to be ruled by <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>so</b> old after the equally elderly Andronikos I, and Isaac Angelos was crowned.|$|E

Taking her father's old armor, she disguises herself as <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> <b>so</b> that she can enlist instead of her parent. The anxious family quickly learn of her {{departure}} and Grandmother Fa prays to the family ancestors for Mulan's safety.

500|$|Ímar {{may have}} been the father, uncle, or {{possibly}} even the brother of Gofraid Crobán, King of Dublin and the Isles (died 1095). In 1091, the Annals of Tigernach reveals that Gofraid possessed the kingship of Dublin in an annal-entry recording his patronym as [...] "... mac Maic Arailt". The thirteenth–fourteenth-century Chronicle of Mann, on the other hand, gives Gofraid's patronym as [...] "... filius Haraldi nigri de Ysland". Whilst the former source identifies Gofraid as the son of a man named Aralt (Old Norse Haraldr), the latter identifies Gofraid as the paternal grandson of <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>so</b> named.|$|E
500|$|The {{family of}} Brandon Teena criticized Swank for her {{repeated}} {{use of the}} male gender pronoun [...] "he" [...] in her Oscar acceptance speech. Teena's mother JoAnn Brandon said her child's transgenderism was a defense mechanism that was developed in response to childhood sexual abuse, rather than being an expression of Teena's gendered sense of self. She said, [...] "She pretended she was <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>so</b> no other man could touch her". Despite the criticism, Kevin Okeefe, writing for Out, defended Swank's acceptance speech; he said, [...] "Swank deserves {{a place in the}} great acceptance speech canon for being bold, not only as an actress, but as an award winner".|$|E
500|$|J.R. Ewing is {{a fictional}} {{character}} that William K. Stevens of The New York Times described as [...] "the nastiest man on television, the Iago of Texas oilmen, the smiling snake {{of a star}} of Friday night TV's Dallas, <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>so</b> venal, so low, so mean, so diabolical that he has become an absolute delight to an estimated quarter of a billion viewers around the globe." [...] His New York Times colleague John J. O'Connor described him as [...] "the eldest son of the oil-rich Ewing family..." [...] who is [...] "...a sadistic bully and a swindler" [...] that [...] "captured the public's imagination". Season 3 left the viewer with numerous people to suspect for the murder.|$|E

500|$|Chrysippus wrote much on {{the subject}} of logic and created a system of propositional logic. Aristotle's term logic had been {{concerned}} with the interrelations of terms such as [...] "Socrates" [...] or [...] "man" [...] ("all men are mortal, Socrates is <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> <b>so</b> Socrates is mortal"). Stoic logic, on the other hand, was concerned with the interrelations of propositions such as [...] "it is day" [...] ("if it is day, it is light: but it is day: so it is light"). Though the earlier Megarian dialecticians –Diodorus Cronus and Philo– had worked in this field and the pupils of Aristotle –Theophrastus and Eudemus– had investigated hypothetical syllogisms, it was Chrysippus who developed these principles into a coherent system of propositional logic.|$|E
500|$|The [...] {{substance}} of Shaw's political legacy is uncertain. In 1921 Shaw's erstwhile collaborator William Archer, {{in a letter}} to the playwright, wrote: [...] "I doubt if there is any case of <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>so</b> widely read, heard, seen, and known as yourself, who has produced so little effect on his generation." [...] Margaret Cole, who considered Shaw the greatest writer of his age, professed never to have understood him. She thought he worked [...] "immensely hard" [...] at politics, but essentially, she surmises, it was for fun—"the fun of a brilliant artist". After Shaw's death, Pearson wrote: [...] "No one since the time of Tom Paine has had so definite an influence on the social and political life of his time and country as Bernard Shaw." ...|$|E

[...] He was later influential in ensuring the chimney was made a listed building. [...] As a notable raconteur he also became an after-dinner speaker and would wear his trademark flat cap with his dinner jacket. [...] He made an appearance in a 1996 television advertisement for Kelloggs, but the strain of living with <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>so</b> dedicated to his hobbies began to take its toll on his wife: [...] "Sometimes he'll have busted his thumb because he's hit it with a hammer; you couldn't really expect him then {{to come in and}} start doing things in the house. [...] I just don't think it's fair though, I think you've got to strike a balance and I think ours is about 90/10. [...] Me for 90 per cent of the housework and Fred for 10."

500|$|The {{performances}} of several cast members {{was a frequent}} topic in the critiques. In particular, Mark Ruffalo's portrayal of Dr. Bruce Banner/the Hulk was well received by commentators. Joe Neumaier opined that his performance was superior {{to the rest of}} the cast; [...] "Ruffalo is the revelation, turning Banner into a wry reservoir of calm ready to become a volcano." [...] Similarly, The New Yorker Anthony Lane proclaimed Ruffalo's acting to be one of the film's highlights—alongside Downey. The Village Voice Karina Longworth concluded: [...] "Ruffalo successfully refreshes the Hulk myth, playing Banner as an adorably bashful nerd-genius who, in contrast to the preening hunks on the team, knows better than to draw attention to himself." [...] Travers asserted that the actor resonated a [...] "scruffy warmth and humor" [...] vibe, while Turan felt that he surpassed predecessors Edward Norton and Eric Bana in playing the character. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote that [...] "the smartest thing the filmmakers did was to get Mark Ruffalo to play Bruce Banner as <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>so</b> sensitive that he's at war, every moment, with himself. (The film finally solves the Hulk problem: He's a lot more fun in small doses.)" ...|$|E
500|$|First season regular {{cast member}} Malcolm David Kelley {{returned}} in an uncredited cameo {{for a single}} scene as Michael's ten-year-old son Walt without dialogue and from a distance. Fifteen-year-old Kelley claimed that make-up was applied to him in an effort for him to look younger; however, Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse clarified that visual effects supervisor Mitch Suskin had actually composited into the shot some footage of Kelley from production on the first season. Because Kelley was so obscured and his name did {{not appear in the}} cast list, television critics were convinced that Walt had been recast. Steve Heisler of Time Out stated that [...] "You gotta hand it to the Lost writers: For weeks, people have speculated about how they were going to treat Walt's inevitable pubescence. See, the show's set in 2004, and only a few months have passed since the plane crash. Yet … it's been years, and … Kelley has become <b>a</b> <b>man.</b> <b>So</b> what did they do? … They just didn't show him. Clever." [...] TMZ's Daniel thought that [...] "Not showing Walt is a clever way to cover up the fact that he [...] a foot taller than he should be … I understand that they pretty much can't show Walt ever again". Wizards Nikki Stafford {{went so far as to}} remark that [...] "That kid standing in the window was definitely not Malcolm David Kelley … I don't think Kelley will be back to reprise the role." ...|$|E
500|$|After World War I {{began in}} 1914, it was Borah's {{view that the}} U.S. should keep {{completely}} {{out of it and}} he voted for legislation requested by Wilson barring armament shipments to the belligerents. Borah was disquieted when Wilson permitted credits to Great Britain and France after refusing them loans, as the credits served the same purpose, furthering the war. He was vigilant in support of the neutral rights of the United States, and was outraged both by the 1915 sinking of the Lusitania by the Germans and by infringements against Americans by British forces. Borah was spoken of as a possible candidate for president in 1916, but gained little support: the Old Guard disliked him almost as much as they did Roosevelt, while others questioned whether <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>so</b> free from the discipline of the party could lead its ranks. Borah stated he lacked the money to run. [...] He did work behind the scenes to find a candidate that would reunite the Republicans and holdout Progressives: a member of a joint committee of the two parties' conventions to seek re-unification, Borah achieved a friendly reception when he addressed the Progressive convention. [...] The Republicans nominated Charles Evans Hughes, and Progressive leaders reluctantly backed him, but some former Roosevelt supporters refused to support Hughes. Borah campaigned for the Republican presidential candidate (something he would do only once more, for Hoover in 1928), but Wilson narrowly won re-election.|$|E

500|$|The game's {{characters}} {{were designed by}} Kimihiko Fujisaka, who had previously worked on the main Drakengard series. Two character designs for the protagonist were created for Nier. The developers believed that the Japanese audience would respond more strongly to a younger protagonist, while non-Japanese audiences would prefer an adult Nier character. Other than changing Nier's appearance and modifying a few lines of dialogue to fit with Nier being a father rather than a brother to Yonah, the developers made no changes between the two versions; while it was initially believed that the older Nier was the character's original design, an interview with Yoko clarified that the young Nier was the original vision. Many characters underwent changes during development, and some needed to be cut: there were originally thirteen Grimoires, with all but three being cut: those that remained were Weiss, Noir and Rubrum. Emil's character was derived from a female character named Halua, while Kainé was originally a far more feminine type who hid her violent nature. Yonah's original Japanese name {{was derived from the}} Biblical name Jonah: this could not be taken verbatim into its localized form due to the name being associated with <b>a</b> <b>man,</b> <b>so</b> the name was changed to [...] "Yonah". Kainé's character was made intersexual, since the team felt it fitted in with many other aspects of her gritty backstory. Kainé's status as an intersexual caused some commotion in western territories, which is something the team did not actively intend. Yoko attributed the original suggestion to female staff members working on the game.|$|E
