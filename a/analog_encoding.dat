50|$|An {{innovator}} and entrepreneur, Sidney Topol was {{a contributor}} to several key developments in the telecommunications industries {{in the latter half}} of the twentieth century. A graduate of the University of Massachusetts Amherst (1947) and an engineer and executive at Raytheon and later Scientific-Atlanta. Topol's expertise in microwave systems led to the development of the first effective portable television relay links, allowing broadcasts from even remote areas. His foray into satellite technologies in the 1960s provided the foundation for building the emerging cable television industry, permitting the transmission of transoceanic television broadcasts. Topol also played a pivotal role in the development of international telecommunications trade policies and the promotion of high definition television (HDTV), a technology that enhances video images by using digital, instead of <b>analog,</b> <b>encoding</b> techniques. retiring in the early 1990s, Topol has been engaged in philanthropic work, contributing to the educational and cultural life in Boston and Atlanta.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a distributed sensor network {{in which the}} sin-gle antenna sensor nodes observe a deterministic unknown parameter and after encoding the observed signal with a phase parameter, the sensor nodes transmit it simultaneously to a multi-antenna fusion center (FC). The FC optimizes the phase encoding parameter and feeds {{it back to the}} sensor nodes such that the variance of estimation error can be minimized. We re-lax the phase optimization problem to a semidefinite program-ming (SDP) problem and the numerical results show that the performance of the proposedmethod is close to the theoretical bound. Also, asymptotic results show that when the number of sensors is very large and the variance of the distance be-tween the sensor nodes and FC is small, multiple antennas do not provide a benefit compared with a single antenna system; when the number of antennasM is large and themeasurement noise at the sensor nodes is small compared with the additive noise at the FC, the estimation error variance can be reduced by a factor of M.

The representation is aimed at the evolutionary synthesis and reverse engineering of cir-cuits and networks such as analog electronic circuits, neural net-works, and genetic regulatory networks. AGE permits the simul-taneous evolution of the topology and sizing of the networks. The establishment of the links between the devices that form the net-work is based on an implicit definition of the interaction between different parts of the genome. This reduces the amount of infor-mation that must be carried by the genome, relatively to a direct encoding of the links. The application of AGE is illustrated with ex-amples of analog electronic circuit and neural network synthesis.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a method of}} {{structured}} construction of the optimal measurement matrix for noiseless compressed sensing (CS), which achieves the minimum number of measurements which only needs to be {{as large as the}} sparsity of the signal itself to be recovered to guarantee almost error-free recovery, for sufficiently large dimension. To arrive at the results, we employ a duality between noiseless CS and analog coding across sparse additive noisy channel (SANC). Extending Renyi Information Dimension to Mutual Information Dimension (MID), we show the operational meaning of MID to be the fundamental limit of asymptotically error-free analog transmission across SANC under linear <b>analog</b> <b>encoding</b> constraint. We prove that MID polarizes after analog polar transformation and obeys the same recursive relationship as BEC. We further prove that analog polar encoding can achieve the fundamental limit of achievable dimension rate with vanishing Pe across SANC. From the duality, a structured construction scheme is proposed for the linear measurement matrix which achieves the minimum measurement requirement for noiseless CS. Comment: 26 pages.

40|$|In {{studies of}} {{long-term}} memory of multi-digit numbers the leading digit {{tends to be}} recalled correctly more often than less significant digits, which has been interpreted as evidence for an analog magnitude encoding of the numbers. However, upon closer examination of data from one of these studies {{we found that the}} distribution of recall errors does not fit a model based on <b>analog</b> <b>encoding.</b> Rather, the data suggested an alternative hypothesis that each digit of a number is encoded separately in long-term memory, and that encoding of one or more digits sometimes fails due to insufficient attention in which case they are simply guessed when recall is requested, with no regard for the presented value. To test this hypothesis of nominal encoding with value-independent mistakes, we conducted two studies with a total of 1, 080 adults who were asked to recall a single piece of numerical information that had been presented in a story they had read earlier. The information was a three-digit number, manipulated between subjects with respect to its value (between 193 and 975), format (Arabic digits or words), and what it counted (baseball caps or grains of sand). Results were consistent with our hypothesis. Further, the leading digit was recalled correctly more often than less significant digits when the number was presented in Arabic digits but not when the number was presented in words; our interpretation of this finding is that the latter format does not focus readers’ attention on the leading digit...|$|E

The VMA intein, which encodes the PI-SceI endonuclease in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, {{is present in}} several different yeast strains. Surprisingly, a wild wine yeast (DH 1 - 1 A) contains not only the intein+ allele, but also an inteinless allele that has not undergone {{gene conversion}}. To elucidate how these two alleles co-exist, we characterized the endonuclease encoded by the DH 1 - 1 A intein+ allele and the target site in the intein– allele. Sequence analysis reveals seven mutations in the 31  bp recognition sequence, none of which occurs at positions that are individually critical for activity. However, binding and cleavage of the sequence by PI-SceI is reduced 10 -fold compared to the S. cerevisiae target. The PI-SceI <b>analog</b> <b>encoded</b> by the DH 1 - 1 A intein+ allele contains 11 mutations at residues in the endonuclease and protein splicing domains. None affects protein splicing, but one, a R 417 Q substitution, accounts {{for most of the}} decrease in DNA cleavage and DNA binding activity of the DH 1 - 1 A protein.
