For example, in a poll conducted in 2000, only 22% of Quebecers <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>statement,</b> “We have gone too far in pushing bilingualism,” while positive response rates in English Canada ranged from a low of 50% in the Atlantic to a high of 65% in the Prairies.|$|E
25|$|Support for reunification {{among the}} younger generations in South Korea {{has been seen}} by some as faltering, with the percent of people in {{government}} polls who regarded reunification as essential dropping from more than eighty percent in the 1990s to fifty-six percent. Among Koreans in their twenties, forty-one percent <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> (and only about twenty percent of teenagers). Many suspect that younger generations, not sharing previous generations' perception of Korea's unnatural division, {{are more concerned with}} South Korea's economic development and hesitant to singlehandedly take on North Korean integration and the associated costs (which some estimates put as high as $1 trillion).|$|E

Jared Lee Loughner, the perpetrator of the 2011 Tucson shooting, followed 2012-related predictions.

Due to the album's release in October 2001, it was not eligible for any other nomination from the 2002 Grammy Awards.
