40|$|<b>Aerial</b> <b>lifts</b> {{are used}} to elevate people and {{material}} to high heights. There are {{many different types of}} <b>aerial</b> <b>lifts</b> which have vastly different dynamics characteristics. Thus, a new categorization for <b>aerial</b> <b>lifts</b> was created and organizes them by their kinematics. Many accidents occur while using <b>aerial</b> <b>lifts.</b> Hazards of <b>aerial</b> <b>lifts</b> and current solutions to those hazards were reviewed to understand the causes of the accidents. Some major accidents are due to the complex dynamics and flexibility of <b>aerial</b> <b>lifts,</b> such as oscillations and tip-overs. Oscillations of full-size <b>aerial</b> <b>lifts</b> were experimentally tested to determine frequencies in different configurations. Machine-motion induced oscillations of an articulating <b>aerial</b> <b>lift</b> were simulated and analyzed for both non-overcenter and overcenter configurations. Input shaping was used to achieve reduction in machine-motion induced oscillations. Tip-over stability margin was used to simulate and analyze the stability of both non-overcenter and overcenter configurations. The effect of increased platform mass on tip-over stability margin was also analyzed. The results in this thesis are a categorization of <b>aerial</b> <b>lifts</b> including their hazards and methods of reducing those hazards, an experimental verification of the dynamic response of full-size <b>aerial</b> <b>lifts,</b> a fully dynamic tip-over prediction model of double-boom articulating <b>aerial</b> <b>lift</b> by applying flexibility in the joints and realistic velocity profiles, and a detailed study of the dynamics of a double-boom articulating <b>aerial</b> <b>lift.</b> MSCommittee Chair: Singhose, William; Committee Member: Ferri, Aldo; Committee Member: Vaughan, Joshu...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Aerial</b> <b>lifts</b> {{transport}} skiers while suspended off the ground. <b>Aerial</b> <b>lifts</b> {{are often}} bicable ropeways, the [...] "bi-" [...] prefix {{meaning that the}} cables have two different functions (carrying and pulling).|$|R
5000|$|An <b>aerial</b> <b>lift</b> is a {{means of}} cable {{transport}} in which cabins, cars, gondolas or open chairs are hauled above the ground by means of one or more cables. <b>Aerial</b> <b>lift</b> systems are frequently employed in mountainous territory where roads are relatively difficult to build and use, and have seen extensive use in mining. <b>Aerial</b> <b>lift</b> systems are relatively easy to move, and are and have been used to cross rivers and ravines. In more recent times, the cost-effectiveness and flexibility of <b>aerial</b> <b>lifts</b> has seen an increase of gondola lift being integrated into urban public transport systems.|$|R

50|$|The Awashima Kaijō Ropeway (Awashima Kaijō Rōpuwei) is Japanese <b>aerial</b> <b>lift</b> line in Numazu, Shizuoka, {{operated}} by Awashima Marine Park (Awashima Marinpāku). On Awashima Island (淡島), the former deserted {{island off the}} shore of Numazu, the Awashima Marine Park developed a resort with the same name, which includes a hotel and a public aquarium. The <b>aerial</b> <b>lift</b> line links Honshū and the island, across the short strait. Opened in 1964, {{it was the first}} <b>aerial</b> <b>lift</b> in Japan to go over the sea, and still is the only line to do so. The line mainly functions as a gateway attraction of the park. Riders have to pay the park admission to ride the <b>aerial</b> <b>lift.</b>|$|R

40|$|Falls are {{the leading}} cause of death for {{construction}} workers, killing more than 200 U. S. workers each year. <b>Aerial</b> <b>lifts,</b> commonly used on construction sites, expose workers to falls. To prevent these falls and other aerial lift-related injuries and deaths, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) developed the <b>Aerial</b> <b>Lift</b> Hazard Recognition Simulator. This flyer gives employers, trainers, safety professionals, and <b>aerial</b> <b>lift</b> operators information on the Simulator and how to access it. To use the NIOSH <b>Aerial</b> <b>Lift</b> Hazard Recognition Simulator visit: [URL] Key points about the Simulator: 1. The Simulator provides a realistic workplace with multiple, dangerous hazard types (e. g., potholes, ramps) that users have to navigate, but from a safe and controlled environment. 2. Users are notified when they have encountered a hazard so they can identify and avoid such hazards on an actual worksite. 3. The Simulator is available at no cost on the NIOSH website, and offers experienced <b>aerial</b> <b>lift</b> operators the opportunity to refresh their knowledge about hazards, and creates awareness of such hazards among new operators. Note: Using the Simulator is not a substitute for required training to operate an <b>aerial</b> <b>lift.</b> Suggested citation: NIOSH [2017]. <b>Aerial</b> <b>Lift</b> Hazard Recognition Simulator.
