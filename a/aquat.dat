40|$|The {{cost and}} {{complexity}} of traditional methods {{for the detection of}} faecal indicator bacteria, including E. coli, hinder widespread monitoring of drinking water quality, especially in low-income countries and outside controlled laboratory settings. In these settings the problem is exacerbated by the lack of inexpensive media for the detection of E. coli in drinking water. We developed a new low-cost growth medium, <b>aquatest</b> (AT), and validated its use for the direct detection of E. coli in temperate and sub-tropical drinking waters using IDEXX Quanti-Tray 1. AT was compared with IDEXX Colilert- 181 and either EC-MUG or MLSB for detect-ing low levels of E. coli from water samples from temperate (n = 140; Bristol, UK) and sub-tropical regions (n = 50, Pretoria/Tshwane, South Africa). Confirmatory testing (n = 418 and 588, respectively) and the comparison of quantitative results were used to assess perfor-mance. Sensitivity of AT was higher than Colilert- 181 for water samples in the UK [98. 0 % vs. 86. 9 %; p 95 % in both settings). Quanti-tative results were comparable and within expected limits.

40|$|Drinking water quality, {{especially}} {{in many parts}} of South Africa, is far below acceptable standards. With an annual estimate of 43, 000 deaths from diarrheal diseases, 3 million cases of illness and treatment costs of over half a billion US dollars, the impact is critical (Mackintosh 2 ̆ 6 Colvin, 2003). To address this issue the <b>Aquatest</b> project seeks to develop a simplified low-cost water quality test kit and information management solution. This would allow Water Service Providers, {{especially in}} rural areas, to monitor water quality and distribute test data to the necessary parties - Water Service Authorities and consumers. This research addresses the challenge of reporting complex and critical water quality information {{in a way that is}} accessible to all South Africans as law requires. In a country with high illiteracy rates, 11 official languages and limited-to-no access to technology in many areas, this is no easy feat. We propose that the use of appropriate information and communication technologies (ICT), coupled with culturally appropriate ways of presenting scientific data, would allow water quality information to be accessible to South Africans.

40|$|Surveys of benthic {{invertebrates}} in subarctic Southern Indian Lake, Manitoba, {{before and after}} manipulation of the lake for hydroelectric development, revealed that Hexagenia (Insecta: Ephemeroptera) populations collapsed following the diversion phase. Initial conclusions attributed the collapse to lake manipulation, but intensive life-history studies indicated that the cause {{was a series of}} cold years immediately following diversion. A simple model relating air temperature during the open-water season to Hexagenia abundance was successful in predicting burrowing mayfly abundance in the lake. This indicated the significance of temperature in regulating these populations, which are near their northern limits of distribution in Manitoba. The difficulty in discriminating between natural ecosystem variability and anthropogenic effects during the course of an environmental monitoring program is illustrated by this study.

40|$|Life {{histories}} {{and distribution of}} mayflies (Insecta:Ephemeroptera) were investigated in 11 streams in south central Ontario that ranged from highly acidic to circumneutral. At least 29 mayfly species were recorded from the streams, with 16 common enough for life history analysis. Mayfly distribution and diversity were correlated with pH regime and stream size. No mayflies {{were found in the}} smallest, most acid stream, and numbers of mayfly species and their relative abundances generally increased with both increasing stream size and stream pH. Incorporation of life cycle information with distributional data enabled us to determine the precise stream-water pH range encountered by different mayfly life stages in the study streams. Generally, during the period of greatest acid stress in the streams (pH depressions associated with spring snowmelt) the mayflies were present in large or dormant stages, which are believed to be more tolerant of lowered pH.

40|$|A model {{describing}} fish abundance {{resulting from}} fish migration and mortality in an upper estuary is presented. This {{model can be}} used to estimate biomass transports by fish migrations between estuary and sea and to assess production assimilated in the estuary. It was applied to herring Clupea harengus L., a marine species with 0 + juveniles that migrate during winter to temperate European estuaries. It was shown that different mortality regimes greatly affected the number of fish that eventually emigrated and, hence, the biomass that was exported during the seaward migration. The difference between imported and exported biomass was assessed under different growth conditions and varied from positive to negative as mortality rates increased. The discrepancy between export of biomass and in situ produced biomass showed that fish production was not necessarily transported to the sea when emigrating. It was tentatively concluded that export of biomass out of the estuary only occurs if populations move seaward before winter. See also: Maes, J.; Ollevier, F.

Can. J. Fish. <b>Aquat.</b> Sci. 66 : 167 - 176). They note that for the sampled populations, spatial genetic variance should far exceed temporal variance components based on previously published work and suggest that limited sample sizes biased our results by confounding sampling error with temporal variation. Here, we perform a rarefaction analysis by randomly removing up to 50 % of the individuals from sample sites, yet the pattern of temporal versus spatial variation is similar to that reported in our original paper. We reiterate that caution should be applied to the interpretation of migration rates estimated from assignment tests, yet the absolute magnitude of our migration estimates was not central to the goals of the original paper. Although Beacham and Withler raise important points on the validation of genetic stock identification analyses, our analyses of temporal variation in genetic population structure in the Upper Fraser River population likely differ due to demographic differences between the timing of sampling of their earlier work versus our analyses...|$|E

40|$|Epidemic mortalities of {{chinook salmon}} alevins (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) have {{occurred}} annually at a freshwater hatchery at the Chehalis River, British Columbia, Canada, since 1982. Previous work has identified branchial epithelial hyperplasia as the predominant pathological change. Our initial work {{lead us to}} test the hypothesis that Chehalis River disease (CRD) was actually a novel form of bacterial gill disease (BGD). Histological and ultrastructural observations indicated that CRD-affected gills harboured a bacterial biofilm apparently complexed with particulate iron prior to and during clinical CRD. In one instance, extracellular viruslike particles were observed. Large numbers of a mixed bacterial population were recovered from diseased gills. Flavobacterium sp. and Pseudomonas fluorescens were considered the predominant isolates from the 1990 - 91 outbreak. However, indirect immunofluorescence of gills with anti-Flavobacterium branchophila serum failed to detect antigenically similar bacteria on the gills of CRD-affected fish. Chemotherapeutic treatment of both naturally and experimentally infected fish was successful, thereby confirming the infectious nature of the disease. We conclude that CRD is a form of BGD, but the significance of the branchial viruslike particles and the presence of particulate iron has not yet been established.

40|$|The role of {{predation}} in structuring soft-sediment communities varies as {{a function}} of the number and composition of predators that co-occur in a given habitat. In Bonne Bay, Newfoundland, contrasting abundances or predators in different areas of the bay may contribute to different regulatory roles of predators on infauna. To test this hypothesis, results from a field exclusion experiment were compared with 5 laboratory experiments that measured the individual effects of the main crustacean predators of the bay: snow crab, rock crab, and toad crab. In the field experiment, the exclusion of predators generated clear differences in infaunal composition, and 2 species (the polychaete Pholoe tecta and the clam Macoma calcarea) dominated exclusion treatments. Predator exclusion also resulted in a significant increase in density, but only a modest increase in infaunal diversity. In the laboratory, fresh, undisturbed sediment cores were paired with similar cores, protected by mesh and exposed to each crab species in order to test for their potential effects on infaunal communities. Results indicate that snow crab and rock crab have clear effects on species composition and, as was the case with the field experiment, the infaunal species P. tecta and M calcarea dominated exclusion treatments for both predatory crabs. These predators also reduced total infaunal density, but only rock crab significantly reduced species richness. In contrast, toad crab effects were not significant. Given that snow crab and rock crab are both targeted by commercial fisheries in Atlantic Canada, our results suggest that crab fishery removal may have multiple indirect effects on infaunal communities.
