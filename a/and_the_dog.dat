5|$|Clumber Spaniels shed at {{a medium}} pace. Clumbers tend to drool {{because of their}} very droopy flews. Clumbers have minds of their own. Puppies are {{especially}} curious and playful. The breed has a trophy mentality <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> has an incessant need to carry something most of the time; unfortunately {{this can lead to}} health issues as they may ingest the items.|$|E
5|$|The {{progenitors}} of the Labrador retriever {{were actually}} from Newfoundland and Labrador exceptionally, the breed {{known as the}} Newfoundland was created near {{the same time in}} Labrador. The two breeds' names and origins were mixed once moved into England and the Americas. The dog from Labrador became the large, long-furred dog we see and know today, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> from Newfoundland became the Labrador.|$|E
5|$|Because Clumber Spaniels {{are large}} boned and fast growing, they can suffer from {{temporary}} lameness from between six and twelve months of age, with this lameness subsiding when bone growth is complete. Another common condition that the breed suffers from are impacted anal sacs <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> may {{require them to}} be emptied by a veterinarian. The final common condition that the breed has is heat sensitivity: if Clumber Spaniels are left without shade, they can become uncomfortably hot and dehydrated.|$|E

5|$|Scottie cramp is an {{autosomal}} recessive hereditary disorder which inhibits the dog's ability to walk. It {{is caused by}} a defect in the pathways in the brain that control muscle contraction due to a low level of serotonin in the body. Typically symptoms only show when the particular dog is under some degree of stress. The front legs are pushed out to the side, the back arches and the rear legs overflex, causing the dog to fall should they be moving at speed. The condition is not seizure related, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> remains conscious throughout the event, with symptoms abating once the cause of the stress has been removed.|$|E
5|$|Narrow/closed angle {{glaucoma}} is an {{autosomal dominant}} inheritable trait in the breed. It {{is a leading}} cause of blindness in dogs, and is where there is increased fluid pressure within the eye. If the fluid is not reduced, the pressure causes permanent damage to the retina and optic nerve. Loss of eyesight can happen as quickly as within 24 hours if the pressure if elevated enough, or slowly over time if it is only a mild elevation. The sudden, rapid elevation of pressure is more common with narrow/closed angle glaucoma which is more common to the breed than the slower open angle glaucoma. Symptoms can include redness in the eye, the eye itself looking cloudy, sensitivity to light <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> may rub at their eye, or even rub it along other objects and carpet as the condition is moderate to extremely painful. Treatment can vary depending on the severity of the condition but if inherited glaucoma appears in one eye then it usually occurs in the other eye eventually.|$|E
5|$|Shortly thereafter, {{however, the}} Owsla of Efrafa, led by Woundwort himself arrives {{to attack the}} newly formed warren at Watership Down. Through Bigwig's bravery and loyalty, and Hazel's ingenuity, the Watership Down rabbits seal {{the fate of the}} Efrafan general by unleashing the Nuthanger Farm watchdog. As the Efrafans flee in terror, Woundwort, a {{formidable}} fighter by rabbit standards, fearlessly stands his ground as he <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> simultaneously lunge at each other. Woundwort's body is never found, and at least one of his former followers continues to believe in his survival. Hazel is nearly killed by a cat, but he is saved by the farm girl Lucy, the owner of the escaped hutch rabbits.|$|E

5|$|The craft was {{equipped}} with a life-support system consisting of an oxygen generator and devices to avoid oxygen poisoning and to absorb carbon dioxide. A fan, designed to activate whenever the cabin temperature exceeded , was added to keep the dog cool. Enough food (in a gelatinous form) was provided for a seven-day flight, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> was fitted with a bag to collect waste. A harness {{was designed to be}} fitted to the dog, and there were chains to restrict her movements to standing, sitting, or lying down; there was no room to turn around in the cabin. An electrocardiogram monitored heart rate and further instrumentation tracked respiration rate, maximum arterial pressure, and the dog's movements.|$|E
5|$|The {{penalty of}} the sack, {{with the animals}} included, {{experienced}} a revival in parts of late medieval, and early modern Germany (particularly in Saxony). The 14th century commentator on the 13th century compilation of laws/customs Sachsenspiegel, Johann von Buch, for example, states that the poena cullei is the appropriate punishment for parricides. Some differences evolved within the German ritual, relative to the original Roman ritual, though. Apparently, the rooster was not included, and the serpent might be replaced with {{a painting of a}} serpent {{on a piece of paper}} and the monkey could be replaced with a cat. Furthermore, the cat <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> were sometimes physically separated from the person, and the sack itself (with its two partitions) was made of linen, rather than of leather.|$|E
5|$|When Atkinson {{arrived back}} at Cape Evans from the Beardmore Glacier {{at the end}} of January, he was the senior officer present and thus in command of the base camp, a role to which he was not accustomed. Terra Nova arrived from her winter mooring in New Zealand on 9 February, and instead of setting off for Scott, Atkinson used the shore party for the arduous task of {{unloading}} the ship – a mistake, Cherry-Garrard thought, since these men might be required to sledge again. Belatedly, on 13 February, Atkinson set out with Dimitri Gerov <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> teams for the scheduled meeting with Scott on the Barrier, arriving and pausing at Hut Point on 19 February.|$|E
