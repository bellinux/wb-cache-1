5|$|By the 18th century, the Royal Audiencia of Quito {{began to}} have {{economic}} problems; a lack of roads led to limited communications. Obrajes—a type of textile factory—had provided jobs, but now found themselves in decline, mainly due to <b>a</b> <b>crackdown</b> on smuggled European cloths {{and a series of}} natural disasters. Obrajes were replaced by haciendas, and the dominant groups continued to exploit the indigenous population.|$|E
5|$|General Adib Shishakli {{seized power}} in 1951, {{establishing}} a military-backed autocracy. Atrash participated in anti-Shishakli activity, including throwing explosives at Shishakli's residence in 1952, an action {{which resulted in}} Atrash's arrest. In 1953 Shishakli launched <b>a</b> <b>crackdown</b> on the Druze community, claiming they were being funded by Hashemite-ruled Jordan and Iraq to establish a Hashemite government in Syria. Jabal al-Druze was bombarded by government forces and Atrash's father Sultan was put under house arrest for his vocal criticism of Shishakli.|$|E

5|$|Indiana's {{political}} polarity {{continued to}} worsen after the Emancipation Proclamation (1863) made freeing the slaves a war goal. Many of the formerly pro-war Democrats moved to openly oppose the war, and Governor Morton began <b>a</b> <b>crackdown</b> on dissidents. During one notorious incident in May 1863, the governor had soldiers disrupt a Democratic state convention in Indianapolis, causing what would latter {{be referred to}} as the Battle of Pogue's Run. No regular session of the Indiana General Assembly was convened until June 1865.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by the {{regional}} Arab Spring, Bahrain's Shia majority started large protests against its Sunni rulers in early 2011. The government initially allowed protests following a pre-dawn raid on protesters camped in Pearl Roundabout. A month later it requested security assistance from Saudi Arabia and other GCC countries and declared a three-month state of emergency. The government then launched <b>a</b> <b>crackdown</b> on the opposition that included conducting thousands of arrests and systematic torture. Almost daily clashes between protesters {{and security forces}} led to dozens of deaths. Protests, sometimes staged by opposition parties, were ongoing. More than 80 civilians and 13 policemen have been killed as of March 2014.|$|E
5|$|The Modi {{government}} launched <b>a</b> <b>crackdown</b> {{against a}} number of civil society organisations. Several {{tens of thousands of}} organisations were investigated by the Intelligence Bureau {{in the first year of}} the administration, on the grounds that they were slowing economic growth. International humanitarian aid organisation Medecins Sans Frontieres was among the groups that were put under pressure. Other organisations affected included the Sierra Club and Avaaz. Cases of sedition were filed against individuals criticising the government. This led to discontent within the BJP regarding Modi's style of functioning and drew comparisons to the governing style of Indira Gandhi.|$|E

5|$|The {{immediate}} effect of Peterloo was <b>a</b> <b>crackdown</b> on reform. The government instructed {{the police and}} courts {{to go after the}} journalists, presses and publication of the Manchester Observer. Wroe {{was arrested and charged with}} producing a seditious publication. Found guilty he was sentenced to twelve months in prison and fined £100. Outstanding court cases against the Manchester Observer were rushed through the courts and a continual change of sub-editors was not sufficient defence against a series of police raids, often on the suspicion that someone was writing a radical article. The Manchester Observer closed in February 1820.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, a labour strike {{erupted in}} the Buckingham and Carnatic Mills in Madras. This strike was led by V. Kalyanasundara Mudaliar, {{a leader of the}} Indian National Congress. The strike lasted for over six months during which around 10,000 workers struck work. <b>A</b> <b>crackdown</b> was ordered. Eventually, two factions emerged; one group of workers desired to return to work while another wished to {{continue}} the strike. Violent riots broke out when striking workers prevented the others from returning to work. The riots began to assume communal colours as the workers who wished to continue the strike were mostly caste Hindus while those who desired to end it were largely untouchables or Dalits.|$|E
5|$|In June 1947, Castro {{learned of}} a planned {{expedition}} to overthrow the right-wing government of Rafael Trujillo, a U.S. ally, in the Dominican Republic. Being President of the University Committee for Democracy in the Dominican Republic, Castro joined the expedition. The military force consisted of around 1,200 troops, mostly Cubans and exiled Dominicans, and they intended to sail from Cuba in July 1947. Grau's government stopped the invasion under U.S. pressure, although Castro {{and many of his}} comrades evaded arrest. Returning to Havana, Castro took a leading role in student protests against the killing of a high school pupil by government bodyguards. The protests, accompanied by <b>a</b> <b>crackdown</b> on those considered communists, led to violent clashes between activists and police in February 1948, in which Castro was badly beaten. At this point, his public speeches took on a distinctly leftist slant by condemning social and economic inequality in Cuba. In contrast, his former public criticisms had centered on condemning corruption and U.S. imperialism.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the police}} camp incidents, the Myanmar {{military}} began <b>a</b> major <b>crackdown</b> {{in the villages}} of northern Rakhine state.

Arbitrary arrest, extrajudicial killings, gang rapes, brutalities against civilians, and looting were carried out. According to media reports, hundreds of Rohingya people had been killed by December 2016, and many had fled Myanmar as refugees to take shelter in the nearby areas of Bangladesh.|$|R

5|$|Soon afterward, Nigerian Major Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu {{seized control}} of the {{northern}} {{region of the country}} {{as part of a larger}} coup attempt. Commanders in other areas failed, and the plot was answered by <b>a</b> military <b>crackdown.</b> <b>A</b> massacre of three thousand people from the eastern region living in the north occurred soon afterwards, and stories of other attacks on Igbo Nigerians began to filter into Lagos.|$|R
5|$|In the {{following}} days protests intensified, {{moving to the}} Royal Court in Riffa, a royal palace in Safiriyya and finally blocking roads leading to the financial district in Manama. Security forces clashed with protesters using tear gas and rubber bullets, but police were overwhelmed by protesters. The government then requested help from neighbor countries, which sent about 1,500 security forces to assist the government. A state of emergency was declared and the government launched <b>a</b> <b>crackdown</b> campaign to put down protests by force. The Pearl Roundabout, now cleared of protesters, was torn down by government and protesters found themselves pushed back into their villages. The government arrested over 1,000 protesters including leading opposition and rights activists (known as the Bahrain Thirteen) as well as sportsmen, academics, businessmen, doctors, engineers, journalists and teachers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, protest against South Africa's {{apartheid}} regime reached {{the stage of}} seeking to exclude the nation from international sport. In 1956, government rules requiring separate events for whites and non-whites in South Africa were issued; non-whites received poorer facilities. Brundage initially opposed taking any action. The run-up to the 1960 Rome Olympics had seen tumult in South Africa, including the Sharpeville massacre and <b>a</b> <b>crackdown</b> on the African National Congress. Activists attempted to persuade Brundage that South Africa should be excluded from the Games. Brundage initially took the word of South African sport leaders that all citizens were able to compete for {{a place on the}} Olympic team, and that non-white South Africans simply were not good enough.|$|E
5|$|The {{assassination}} of Hanoi-based French labour recruiter Hervé Bazin on February 9, 1929, {{was a turning}} point that {{marked the beginning of the}} VNQDD's decline. A graduate of the École Coloniale in Paris, Bazin directed the recruitment of Vietnamese labourers to work on colonial plantations. Recruiting techniques often included beating or coercion, because the foremen who did the recruiting received a commission for each enlisted worker. On the plantations, living conditions were poor and the remuneration was low, leading to widespread indignation. In response, Vietnamese hatred of Bazin led to thoughts of an assassination. A group of workers approached the VNQDD with a proposal to kill Bazin. Học felt that assassinations were pointless because they would only prompt <b>a</b> <b>crackdown</b> by the French Sûreté, thereby weakening the party. He felt that it was better to strengthen the party until the time was ripe to overthrow the French, viewing Bazin as a mere twig on the tree of the colonial apparatus.|$|E

5|$|The first anti-Hindi {{imposition}} agitation {{was launched}} in 1937, {{in opposition to the}} introduction of compulsory teaching of Hindi in the schools of Madras Presidency by the first Indian National Congress government led by C. Rajagopalachari (Rajaji). This move was immediately opposed by E. V. Ramasamy (Periyar) and the opposition Justice Party (later Dravidar Kazhagam). The agitation, which lasted three years, was multifaceted and involved fasts, conferences, marches, picketing and protests. The government responded with <b>a</b> <b>crackdown</b> resulting in the death of two protesters and the arrest of 1,198 persons including women and children. Mandatory Hindi education was later withdrawn by the British Governor of Madras Lord Erskine in February 1940 after the resignation of the Congress Government in 1939.|$|E
5|$|The new Chief Minister, Lim Yew Hock, {{launched}} <b>a</b> <b>crackdown</b> on communist and leftist groups, imprisoning many {{trade union}} leaders and several pro-communist {{members of the}} PAP under the Internal Security Act. The British government approved of Lim's tough stance against communist agitators, and when {{a new round of}} talks was held beginning in March 1957, they agreed to grant complete internal self-government. A State of Singapore would be created, with its own citizenship. The Legislative Assembly would be expanded to fifty-one members, entirely chosen by popular election, and the Prime Minister and cabinet would control all aspects of government except defense and foreign affairs. The governorship was replaced by a Yang di-Pertuan Negara or head of state. In August 1958, the State of Singapore Act was passed in the United Kingdom Parliament providing for the establishment of the State of Singapore.|$|E
5|$|Under the new constitution, Zimbabwe's Presidency was a {{ceremonial}} role with no governmental power; the first President was Canaan Banana. Mugabe had previously offered {{the position to}} Nkomo, who had turned it down in favour of becoming Minister of Home Affairs. Although working together, there remained an aura of resentment and suspicion between Mugabe and Nkomo. Mugabe gave ZAPU four cabinet seats, but Nkomo demanded more. In contrast, some ZANU-PF figures argued that ZAPU should not have any seats in government, suggesting that Zimbabwe be converted into a one-party state. Tekere and Enos Nkala were particularly adamant {{that there should be}} <b>a</b> <b>crackdown</b> on ZAPU. After Nkala called for ZAPU to be violently crushed during a rally in Entumbane, street clashes between the two parties broke out in the city.|$|E
