5|$|Avicenna {{distinguishes between}} <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> needs an {{external}} cause {{in order to}} exista contingent thingand <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> is guaranteed to exist by its essence or intrinsic naturea necessary existent. The argument, or proof, tries to prove that there is indeed a necessary existent. It does this by first considering whether the opposite could be true: that everything that exists is contingent. Each contingent thing will need something other than itself to bring it into existence, which will in turn need another cause to bring it into existence, and so on. Because this seemed to lead to an infinite regress, cosmological arguments before Avicenna concluded that some necessary cause (such as God) is needed to end the infinite chain. However, Avicenna's argument does not preclude {{the possibility of an}} infinite regress.|$|E

5|$|To this dreadful monster the effluvium of {{the weasel}} is fatal, <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> {{has been tried}} with success, for kings have often desired to see its body when killed; so true is it that it has pleased Nature {{that there should be}} nothing without its antidote. The animal is thrown into the hole of the basilisk, which is easily known from the soil around it being infected. The weasel destroys the basilisk by its odour, but dies itself in this {{struggle}} of nature against its own self.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, endocentric {{adjectives}} are also frequently formed, using the suffixal morphemes -ing or -er/or. A people-carrier {{is a clear}} endocentric determinative compound: it is <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> is a carrier of people. The related adjective, car-carrying, is also endocentric: it refers to an object, which is a carrying-thing (or equivalent, which does carry).|$|E
25|$|The Udmurt native {{religion}} {{became the}} basis of the national movement, and in 1994 a group of Izhevsk intellectuals, artists, writers, scholars and entrepreneurs founded the Udmurt Vos as an institution and mass association. Genuine high priests were sought, and Vasili Maksimov, a simple peasant from an Udmurt village in Tatarstan, became the head of the new church. National worship services were organised (<b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> never happened before), and since then they are held yearly in different regions of the republic.|$|E

25|$|Descartes {{explains}} how {{he made a}} mention of the two questions, the existence of God, and the soul, in his Discourse on Method. Following this, he received objections, {{and two of them}} he considers are of importance. The first is how he concludes that the essence of the soul is <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> thinks, excluding all other nature. To this he says that he has a clear perception that he is a thinking thing, and has no other clear perception, and from this he concludes that there is nothing else in the essence of the self.|$|E
25|$|I {{put before}} the whole House my own views with an appalling frankness. From 1933, I {{and my friends}} were all very worried about what was {{happening}} in Europe. You will remember at that time the Disarmament Conference was sitting in Geneva. You will remember at that time there was probably a stronger pacifist feeling running through the country {{than at any time since}} the War. I am speaking of 1933 and 1934. You will remember the election at Fulham in the autumn of 1933...That was the feeling of the country in 1933. My position as a leader of a great party was not altogether a comfortable one. I asked myself what chance was there...within the next year or two of that feeling being so changed that the country would give a mandate for rearmament? Supposing I had gone to the country and said that Germany was rearming and we must rearm, does anybody think that this pacific democracy would have rallied to that cry at that moment! I cannot think of anything that would have made the loss of the election from my point of view more certain...We got from the country – with a large majority – a mandate for doing <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> no one, twelve months before, would have believed possible.|$|E

25|$|Act One {{told the}} story of DNA as <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> makes human {{different}} and understand each other, Act two {{told the story}} of how children use their dream to imagine, Act three {{told the story of}} how Youths use dream to express themselves, Act four told the story of how family support become an inspiration for athletes and coaches to achieve success in sports. While Act 5, the conclusion told the story of how Singaporean athletes welcome, make friends and unite with the athletes other country of Southeast Asia regardless of language, race and belief. Soon after the last act, the torch of the Games was carried into the stadium from a dragon boat across the Kallang basin by several Singapore’s former and current generation of sportsmen and sportswomen. The current sportsmen are Clement Teo of Dragon Boat, Liang Xiaoyu of Badminton, Muhammad Naqib Asmin of Athletics, Gabriel Yang of Judo, Dinah Chan of Cycling, Enrico Marican of Hockey, Shanti Pereira of Athletics, Derek Wong Zi Liang of Badminton, while the former sportsmen are Annabel Pennefather of Hockey, Prema Govindran of Athletics and Wong Shoon Keat of Badminton. The cauldron was lit by former football sportsman, Fandi Ahmad and his son and current football sportsman, Irfan Fandi. The cauldron’s design was inspired by the DNA which represents the unity of nations, communities and individuals of Southeast Asia. It is made of stainless steel, 19.2-metre-high and has a LED screen on it that displays information such as the time and weather during the Games. It also has a burner that able to project a 1.5m- to 4m-high flame and 11 bars within the structure that represent the different countries participating at the Games. A colourful fireworks display then erupted over the skyline surrounding the National Stadium, signalling the official commencement of the Games. The ceremony concludes with the President leaving the stadium.|$|E

500|$|The show's Internet success {{became an}} issue in the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. Daniels and many of the cast members who double as writers posted a video to YouTube shortly after the strike began, {{pointing}} out how little, if any, they received in residuals from online and DVD viewing. [...] "You're watching this on the Internet, <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> pays us zero dollars," [...] Schur said. [...] "We're supposed to get 11 cents for every two trillion downloads." [...] The writers were particularly upset that they weren't compensated for the Daytime Emmy Award-winning summer webisodes [...] "The Accountants", which NBC considered promotional material despite the embedded commercials.|$|E

Monitor was now a premier tourist attraction and the crowd was soon allowed on board to tour the vessel.

When Stodder and others came to close up the dock and ship one evening Stodder noted, When we came up to clean that night there was not a key, doorknob, escutcheon – there wasn't <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> hadn't been carried away.|$|E
500|$|Brownlee was the campaign's {{dominant}} figure, {{and gave}} 67 speeches around the province. [...] He stressed the UFA government's experience and contrasted {{it with the}} Liberals' and Conservatives' lack thereof. [...] Having signed the resource agreement, {{he asked for a}} mandate to administer its implementation. [...] In response to claims that a strong opposition was needed to exercise a check on his certain-to-be-re-elected government, he restated his view of government as [...] "the administration of business" [...] by saying [...] "an opposition is <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> is no more needed in the public business of this Province...than in the management of the affairs of any of our large corporations."

500|$|In 2017, Getzlaf {{was named}} {{a finalist for the}} Mark Messier Leadership Award along with Calgary Flames defencemen Mark Giordano and Columbus Blue Jackets forward Nick Foligno. In the 2017 playoffs, Getzlaf surpassed former {{teammate}} Teemu Selänne's franchise record of 35 playoff goals against the Edmonton Oilers in Game 4 of the best of seven series. During the Western Conference finals, Getzlaf was fined $10,000 for using a homophobic slur to insult an on-ice official. He later said, [...] "That's my responsibility to understand that there are eyes and ears on us all the time. Fortunately enough, nobody heard it.

500|$|Written in spare language, [...] "A slumber did {{my spirit}} seal" [...] {{consists}} of two stanzas, each four lines long. The first stanza is built upon even, soporific movement in which figurative language conveys the nebulous image of a girl who [...] "seemed <b>a</b> <b>thing</b> <b>that</b> could not feel / The touch of earthly years". The second maintains the quiet and even tone of the first but serves to undermine its sense of the eternal by revealing that Lucy has died and that the calmness of the first stanza represents death. The narrator's response to her death lacks bitterness or emptiness; instead he takes consolation {{from the fact that}} she is now beyond life's trials, and [...] "at last...in inanimate community with the earth's natural fixtures". The lifeless rocks and stones depicted in the concluding line convey the finality of Lucy's death.|$|E

[...] Lineberger wrote in his review of [...] "Eye For An Eye", [...] "This one caused an uproar— one I feel is justified. [...] gave a defense (in my opinion a weak one) (...) I have a high tolerance for insensitive guy stuff, but this got to me. When Duncan rolled into Annie's arms, part of me smirked in appreciation of Duncan's magnetic charm. But the rest of me found his actions cruel to the viewers." [...] Abramowitz confirmed that [...] "...the fans hated it. And the women wanted to string me up. I was a 'cad' and a 'card'..."
