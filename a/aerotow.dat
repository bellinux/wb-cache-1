5|$|Winch {{launches}} {{are much}} cheaper than aerotows and permit a higher launch frequency. A winch {{may also be}} used at sites where an <b>aerotow</b> could not operate, because of {{the shape of the}} field or because of noise restrictions. The height gained from a winch is usually less than from an <b>aerotow</b> so pilots need to find a source of lift soon after releasing from the cable, otherwise the flight will be short. A break in the cable or the weak link during a winch launch is a possibility for which pilots are trained.|$|E
5|$|Gliders {{are often}} {{launched}} using a stationary ground-based winch {{mounted on a}} heavy vehicle. This method is widely used at many European clubs, often {{in addition to an}} <b>aerotow</b> service. The engine is usually powered by LPG, petrol or diesel, though hydraulic fluid engines and electrical motors are also used. The winch pulls in a 1,000 to 2,500-metre (3,000 to 7,500ft) cable, made of high-tensile steel wire or a synthetic fiber, attached to the glider. The cable is released at a height of about 35% of the cable length after a short, steep ride. A strong headwind will result in higher launches.|$|E
5|$|In an <b>aerotow</b> a powered {{aircraft}} {{is attached}} to a glider with a tow rope. Single-engined light aircraft or motor gliders are commonly used. The tow-plane takes the glider to the height and location requested by the pilot where the glider pilot releases the tow-rope. A weak link is often fitted to the rope to ensure that any sudden loads do not damage the airframe of the tow-plane or the glider. Under extreme loads the weak link will fail before any part of the glider or plane fails. There is a remote chance that the weak link might break at low altitude, and so pilots plan for this eventuality before launching.|$|E

25|$|The K-W {{was being}} flown by a 27-year-old private pilot with 56 hours total time and four hours on type, on 10 August 1975 from the Fowler Airport located near Fowler, Kansas. The glider was being {{launched}} by <b>aerotow</b> {{and when the}} glider attempted to release the tow rope the righthand wing struts separated from the fuselage at the attachment fitting due to an overload failure. The aircraft crashed and the pilot was killed. The US National Transportation Safety Board identified the likely cause factors as that the pilot in command mishandled the flight controls and exceeded the stress limits of the aircraft. The NTSB also cited the pilot's lack of familiarity with the aircraft type. No further aircraft of the type were constructed.|$|E

In Australia the convention is to fly in low tow, whereas in the United States and Europe the high tow prevails. One rare <b>aerotow</b> variation is attaching two gliders to one tow-plane, using a short rope for the high-towed glider and a long rope for the low tow. The current record is nine gliders in the same <b>aerotow.</b>|$|E

50|$|Privately, Cartland took an {{interest}} in the early gliding movement. Although <b>aerotowing</b> for launching gliders first occurred in Germany, she thought of long-distance tows in 1931 and did a 200-mile (360 km) tow in a two-seater glider. The idea led to troop-carrying gliders. In 1984, she was awarded the Bishop Wright Air Industry Award for this contribution.|$|R
