5|$|After his selection, Hextall {{remained}} with Brandon for two further seasons. He played 44games in 1982–83, recording a GAA of 5.77 during {{a season in}} which the Wheat Kings did not qualify for the playoffs. The following year was his most successful in the WHL: a GAA of 4.29 across his 46regular season games, which included 29wins – {{more than in the}} previous two seasons combined. He played in ten of the twelve playoff games, recording five wins and five losses, with a GAA of 3.75. During the 1983–84 season, Hextall set a record for the most penalty minutes accumulated by a goaltender, being <b>assessed</b> <b>for</b> 117 minutes during the regular season.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Noel Wild was Dudley Clarke's deputy in Cairo from April 1942.

In December of that year Wild was sent to London, he believed on leave, where he was <b>assessed</b> <b>for</b> suitability and then appointed to the role.|$|E

50|$|The CAPS1 was {{intended}} to monitor changes over a one-month period, whereas the CAPS-2 was developed to monitor changes over a week period. The CAPS-1 and CAPS-2 were later changed to the CAPS-DX and CAPS-SX respectively to avoid confusion over future versions. The CAPS-5 has two versions - one that can <b>assess</b> <b>for</b> one-week changes and one that can <b>assess</b> <b>for</b> one-month changes. The one-week changes may be more helpful for treatment providers to see change in symptom scores over time, whereas the one-month changes may be more helpful to <b>assess</b> <b>for</b> baseline PTSD.|$|R

5|$|In 2011, the American College of Physicians (ACP) {{issued a}} {{clinical}} practice guideline making three strong recommendations based on moderate-quality evidence: that hospitalized patients be <b>assessed</b> <b>for</b> {{their risk of}} thromboembolism and bleeding before prophylaxis is started; that heparin or a related drug be used if potential benefits are thought to outweigh potential harms; and that graduated compression stockings not be used. The ACP also drew attention {{to a lack of}} support for any performance measures encouraging physicians to apply universal prophylaxis without regard to the risks.|$|E
5|$|On {{the third}} restart {{after the initial}} fight, the crowd booed when a fight did not {{immediately}} ensue, but in less than 30 seconds, two more fights had broken out. The final fight occurred directly after the fourth face-off, involving Jason Spezza and Patrick Sharp. Spezza and Brashear were <b>assessed</b> <b>for</b> the most penalty minutes in the game, receiving 35 and 34, respectively. At {{the start of the}} 2005–06 season, the NHL introduced a rule that punished anyone instigating a fight in the final five minutes of a game with a one-game suspension, in order to prevent similar incidents occurring in the future.|$|E
5|$|The 2004–05 NHL {{season was}} {{cancelled}} {{because of a}} labor dispute, but upon the League's return for the 2005–06 season, a rule was added which meant that any player being <b>assessed</b> <b>for</b> an instigator penalty {{in the last five}} minutes of a match would receive an automatic one-game ban, and the player's head coach could also be fined. This was designed to avoid situations such as happened in game between the Flyers and Senators, and addressed the fact that physical play tended to increase towards the end of a game, particularly when the result was not in question.|$|E

A {{series of reports}} of south polar skua, from 1982 to 1993, were all eventually rejected after being <b>assessed</b> <b>for</b> several years. Two other birds (from the Isles of Scilly in 2001, and Glamorgan in 2002 have been accepted (by the BOURC) as belonging to one or other of these two species, while a bird from Dorset in 1996 remains under consideration.|$|E
5|$|The russet sparrow {{appears to}} be {{abundant}} in most habitats across most of its very large range, and in the some areas it {{is among the most}} common birds. In Southeast Asia, its range has contracted at lower elevations due to global warming, but it has also moved higher at high elevations and it remains common. Although its global population has not been quantified, it is <b>assessed</b> <b>for</b> the IUCN Red List as least concern for global extinction.|$|E
5|$|After Copia's closure, the {{building}} had been used for a few meetings and events, including the Napa Valley Film Festival and BottleRock Napa Valley. Triad Development arranged to buy the entire site in 2015 and planned mixed use with housing and retail. The company planned to build up to 187 housing units, 30,000 square feet of retail space, and underground parking for 500 cars. The plan had later altered to only include purchase of the southern portion of the property. In 2015, the Culinary Institute of America (CIA) put in motion plans to acquire a separate portion of Copia. The college opened a campus, the Culinary Institute of America at Copia, which houses the CIA's new Food Business School. The school, which was outgrowing its St. Helena campus, acquired the northern portion of the property for $12.5 million in October 2015 (it was <b>assessed</b> <b>for</b> $21.3 million around 2013). Among the CIA's first events there was 2016's Flavor! Napa Valley, a food and wine festival sponsored by local organizations. The campus opened in late 2016, with its Chuck Williams Culinary Arts Museum opening in 2017. The museum will house about 4,000 items of Chuck Williams, including cookbooks, cookware, and appliances.|$|E

5|$|People {{receiving}} dimercaprol {{need to be}} <b>assessed</b> <b>for</b> peanut allergies {{since the}} commercial formulation contains peanut oil. Calcium EDTA is also effective if administered four hours after the administration of dimercaprol. Administering dimercaprol, DMSA (Succimer), or DMPS prior to calcium EDTA is necessary to prevent the redistribution of lead into the central nervous system. Dimercaprol used alone may also redistribute lead to the brain and testes. An adverse side effect of calcium EDTA is renal toxicity. Succimer (DMSA) is the preferred agent in mild to moderate lead poisoning cases. This {{may be the case}} in instances where children have a blood lead level >25μg/dL. The most reported adverse side effect for succimer is gastrointestinal disturbances. It is also important to note that chelation therapy only lowers blood lead levels and may not prevent the lead-induced cognitive problems associated with lower lead levels in tissue. This may be because of the inability of these agents to remove sufficient amounts of lead from tissue or inability to reverse preexisting damage.|$|E
5|$|The Yukon Quest's rules allow race {{officials}} latitude {{on whether}} to assess a time penalty or monetary fine on mushers who violate one or more regulations. The most serious penalties can be <b>assessed</b> <b>for</b> mistreating dogs. Racers have been forcibly removed from the race for inadequate dog care; the most recent instance of this took place in 2008, when Donald Smidt was removed. More common are minor time and monetary penalties. For example, Dan Kaduce was fined $500 of his eventual $9,000 winnings for missing roll call at a mandatory meeting in 2007. Fines of $500 also have been levied for not attending the finish banquet, littering, not wearing start and finish bibs, or losing veterinary records. These minor penalties can {{have an effect on}} the race. In 2009, Hugh Neff, then in second place, was penalized two hours for mushing on the Circle Hot Springs road. As a result, he finished four minutes behind Sebastian Schnuelle, the winner.|$|E

Non-economic damages are <b>assessed</b> <b>for</b> the injury itself: physical and psychological harm, such as loss of vision, loss of a limb or organ, the reduced enjoyment of life due to a disability or loss of a loved one, severe pain and emotional distress. Punitive damages are not available in all states and, when allowed, are usually only awarded {{in the event of}} wanton and reckless conduct.|$|E
