5|$|Drainage of the Colorado Plateau was {{significantly}} altered by {{the opening of}} the Gulf of California. Rifting tore Baja California Peninsula northwestward from the Mexican mainland starting some 10 to 5mya. The ancestral Colorado River responded to the regional downwarping by taking a shortcut to the sea by flowing into the new gulf. This significantly decreased the distance from the river's headwaters and its delta at the sea. Water in the Colorado and its tributaries moved faster as a result <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>down</b> deeper, creating the canyonland topography.|$|E
5|$|In 1793, cattle {{were brought}} by George Vancouver {{as a tribute}} to King Kamehameha I. By the early 19th century, they had escaped {{confinement}} and roamed the island freely, greatly damaging its ecosystem. In 1809 John Palmer Parker arrived and befriended KamehamehaI, who put him in charge of cattle management on the island. With an additional land grant in 1845, Parker established Parker Ranch on the northern slope of Mauna Kea, a large cattle ranch that is still in operation today. Settlers to the island burned <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>down</b> much of the native forest for the construction of sugarcane plantations and houses.|$|E

5|$|Re-rated as a 42-gun frigate in February 1817, Aigle {{underwent}} {{repairs and}} alterations at Woolwich from March 1817. In accordance with Surveyor of the Navy, Robert Seppings' designs, in January 1820, Aigle had her square transom removed and a circular stern fitted. This gave her improved {{protection in the}} rear and allowed a better field of fire. She was subsequently laid up then repaired <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>down</b> to a 24-gun corvette between March and July 1831. Recommissioned in August 1841 under Lord Clarence Paget, she {{was sent to the}} Mediterranean.|$|E

5|$|The {{relationship}} between Link and Zelda {{was quite different}} from earlier incarnations, in particular the fact that Zelda was {{not a member of}} royalty. According to Aonuma, a recurring difficulty was how contrived the necessity for Link to rescue Zelda became with each passing installment, as their contact may only have been fleeting beforehand. In response to this, the team considered how to make the player care about Zelda and want to rescue her. Having the two characters as childhood friends both served this purpose <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>down</b> on extraneous plot elements. They continued to encourage the player by having Link only just miss her on her early travels across the Surface. Mischievous elements were also added to Zelda's personality by her pushing Link over an ledge: initially intended as a rule of three-style gag, it was cut down to two during development. The figure of Hylia was a new addition to the world's lore, although her existence was linked to Zelda, with the two being essentially the same character known under different names in subsequent ages. Groose, who acted as Link's rival, was introduced to make the story more interesting within the school setting. Groose's maturation {{during the course of the}} story was intended to help convey Link's parallel growth as a character as he was otherwise mute and static.|$|E

25|$|With growing {{support from}} the country's inhabitants, the Kandyans {{prevented}} Portuguese supply caravans from reaching Kandy. Desperate for food, the Portuguese soon began to scour the countryside. Kandyans frequently ambushed these foraging parties <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>down</b> the stragglers. So Pedro Lopes de Sousa decided to organize a large raiding party instead of small foraging groups, and Jayavira Bandara persuaded him to send out Luís Moro Mudali, with a force of 3000 men, to the Principality of Uva.|$|E

Ballesteros claimed to have killed Maransin <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>down</b> 1,200 of his men. In fact, Maransin was wounded and his troops suffered about 150 casualties. The Spanish force retreated when Rey appeared with 2,500 foot and 200 horse and aimed an attack at Ballesteros' flank.|$|E
25|$|The setback of Miajadas forced Lasalle {{to release}} the pursuit, giving time to la Cuesta to receive reinforcements. Made {{confident}} {{by the success of}} his rearguard, the Spanish general positioned his army on the heights of Medellín where the French arrived on 23 March at the morning. The ensuing battle was at first favourable to the Spanish but soon turned into disaster. On the left, Lasalle's cavalry butchered his Spanish counterpart <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>down</b> vigorously the fleeing defenders, avenging the chasseurs of the 10th Regiment who died at Miajadas.|$|E

About 70 Scots escaped to the Russian forces in Wesenberg, the last historical record {{of them is that}} they were subsequently brought to Moscow.|$|E
25|$|The {{first half}} of the story {{discusses}} Gilgamesh, king of Uruk, and Enkidu, a wild man created by the gods to stop Gilgamesh from oppressing the people of Uruk. After Enkidu becomes civilized through sexual initiation with a harlot, he travels to Uruk, where he challenges Gilgamesh to a test of strength. Gilgamesh wins and the two become friends. Together, they make a six-day journey to the legendary Cedar Forest, where they plan to slay the Guardian, Humbaba the Terrible, <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>down</b> the sacred Cedar. Later they kill the Bull of Heaven, which the goddess Ishtar sends to punish Gilgamesh for spurning her advances. As a punishment for these actions, the gods sentence Enkidu to death.|$|E

To improve capacity utilisation on its Berlin services <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>down</b> on aircraft parking as well as crew accommodation costs, from 1 April 1974, Air France routed both of its daily Orly–Tegel services via Cologne, with aircraft and crew returning to their base at Paris Orly the same day.

25|$|Late-season {{coaching}} adjustments {{improved the}} effectiveness of the offense <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> <b>down</b> on opposing teams' ability to control the ball against the defense.

The regular season culminated in a season-finale matchup between the Buccaneers and the Detroit Lions, two 8–7 teams vying for the division lead in the Pontiac Silverdome, where the Lions had gone undefeated all season. The Buccaneers won and entered the playoffs as the number three seed in the NFC, where they lost to the Dallas Cowboys in a 38–0 rout which tied the NFL record for largest margin of victory in a playoff game.|$|E
25|$|Vedel set {{out with}} 6,000 men, 700 horse, and 12 guns, joined during the march by small {{detachments}} under Generals Roize and Ligier-Belair.
