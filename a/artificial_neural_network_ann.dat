5000|$|The {{concept of}} <b>artificial</b> <b>neural</b> <b>network</b> (<b>ANN)</b> was {{introduced}} by McColloch, W. S. & Pitts, W. (1943) for models based on behavior of biological neurons. Norbert Wiener (1961) [...] gave this new field the popular name of cybernetics, whose principle is the interdisciplinary relationship among engineering, biology, control systems, brain functions, and computer science. With the computer science field advancing, the von Neumann-type computer was introduced early in the neuroscience study. But it was not suitable for symbolic processing, nondeterministic computations, dynamic executions, parallel distributed processing, and management of extensive knowledge bases, which are needed for biological neural network applications; and the direction of mind-like machine development changed to a learning machine. Computing technology has since advanced extensively and computational neuroscience is now able to handle mathematical models developed for biological neural network. Research and development are progressing in both artificial and biological neural networks including efforts to merge the two.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Artificial</b> <b>Neural</b> <b>Network</b> (<b>ANN)</b> was {{initially}} trained with 64 images, but was eventually pushed outside the training boundary. In a training session the facial recognition was performing at 100%. When the ANN performed facial recognition testing outside of training, {{the network was}} still performing at 100%. Even when one-fifth of the face {{was covered with a}} black strip the face was still 100% effective as long as the strip did not cover the forehead. The ANN proves another way in which a small number of cells can seem to do a big number of tasks. Previously, grandmother cells supposedly have a unique ability to complete these tasks. The input layer is variously activated by 80 holistic features which vector codes for the second layer. This vector code is an activation which allows the third layer to identify a known individual correctly. This is also the case in parallel distributed processing (PDP). PDP highlights the parallels between connectionist models and neural coding in the brain, while also dismissing localism.|$|E
