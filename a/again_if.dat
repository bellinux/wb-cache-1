5|$|Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, Hogwarts' Headmaster {{and one of}} {{the most}} famous and {{powerful}} wizards of all time. Harris initially rejected the role, only to reverse his decision after his granddaughter stated she would never speak to him <b>again</b> <b>if</b> he did not take it.|$|E
5|$|Jack Rozinsky, 9th dan (Jidokwan), {{founded the}} Shuto Karate Club in 1963; it {{later became the}} Melbourne Taekwondo Centre. As Rozinsky taught tang soo do there, he might be {{considered}} the first taekwondo school founder in Australia (<b>again,</b> <b>if</b> tang soo do were recognised as taekwondo retrospectively), and so might lay claim to the title. Rozinsky did not introduce taekwondo outside Victoria.|$|E
5|$|Assemblies and councils {{operated}} {{according to}} established procedures {{overseen by the}} augurs. They could only be convened by magistrates, and citizens only voted on matters proposed by the presiding magistrate. Over the years, laws were passed which mandated a written ballot, attempted to reduce voter intimidation, and established procedures to watch over voting and prevent voter fraud. For elections, {{it was not a}} matter of who received the most votes, but rather who could first be approved by a majority of the voting blocs. All votes had to be completed within a single day and had to be done <b>again</b> <b>if</b> interrupted or abandoned.|$|E

5|$|Like {{many plants}} in Australia's southwest, Banksia sceptrum {{is adapted to}} an {{environment}} in which bushfire events are relatively frequent. Most Banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: reseeders are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their canopy seed bank, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. Banksia sceptrum is a reseeder—killed by bushfire and regenerating by seed. The follicles on the old flower spikes remain closed until burnt by fire, after which they open and release the seed. New plants take three to five years to flower <b>again.</b> <b>If</b> bushfires are too frequent—occurring less than four years apart—they risk eradicating local populations of reseeders.|$|E
5|$|Murphy {{was born}} in Harlow {{and grew up in}} Irthlingborough. He was home-schooled from age 13 after being bullied at school, and his parents split up when he was 14. He lived with his father Tony, a former {{professional}} golfer, and did not see his mother again until he was 19. During the 2007 World Championship, it was reported that he had developed a rift with his father, {{who was a member of}} the World Snooker board. He said that they had not spoken in over a year, but that he would willingly speak to his father <b>again</b> <b>if</b> the other called him.|$|E
5|$|Scattered {{around each}} level are gold rings. Collecting 100 rings rewards the player {{with an extra}} life. Rings act as a layer of {{protection}} against hazards: if Sonic holds at least one ring when he collides with an enemy or dangerous obstacle, he will survive. However, all rings in his possession will be scattered; they flicker and disappear {{in a few seconds}} if not picked up <b>again.</b> <b>If</b> he is hit without holding any rings, he loses a life. Shields and temporary invincibility can be collected to provide additional layers of protection, but certain hazards, such as drowning, being crushed, falling down a bottomless pit or running out of time, will cause Sonic to lose a life regardless of rings or other protection.|$|E

5|$|Two {{years after}} his draft, Bertuzzi and the Islanders {{had not yet been}} agreed to a contract. With Bertuzzi {{eligible}} to re-enter the draft if the Islanders did not sign him by July 7, 1995, general manager Don Maloney made it apparent that he would use the team's second overall pick in the 1995 NHL Entry Draft to select him <b>again</b> <b>if</b> a contract could not be agreed upon by the required date. Moments before the midnight deadline, the Islanders were able to sign Bertuzzi to a four-year, US$4.6 million contract. His agent, Pat Morris, had reportedly wanted a similar deal to that of fellow Islanders prospect Brett Lindros – a five-year, $6.7 million contract signed the previous summer.|$|E
5|$|Banai is {{believed}} to the daughter of Indra, {{the king of the}} gods. Banai was found by Dhangar shepherd, when she was abandoned on earth by an angry Indra. When Banai grew up, it was predicted that she would get her match at Jejuri. There, she felt in love with God Khandoba. Khandoba also fell in her love. Khandoba accepted a self-exile for 12 years by intentionally losing a game of chess(Saripat) to his wife Mhalsa. He took disguise of shepherd and started serving Banai's father. One day, Khandoba killed all the sheep and goats of Banai' father and promised to make them alive <b>again</b> <b>if</b> he was married to Banai. The reluctant Banai was married to Khandoba, the shepherd in disguise at Naldurg. Khandoba revealed his real form to Banai on their way back to Jejuri.|$|E
5|$|The Queen had {{to mediate}} between her {{brothers}} in 1555, when Charles decided to abdicate as emperor {{and leave the}} government of the Netherlands to his son Philip, despite Ferdinand's objections. When Mary learned of Charles's decision, she informed him that she too would resign. Both Charles and Philip urged her to remain in the post, but she refused. She chronicled the difficulties she had faced due to her gender, the fact that she could not act as she thought she should have because of disagreements with Charles, and her age. Furthermore, she did not wish to accommodate to the ways of her nephew after years of getting used to Charles's demands. The actual reason for Mary's resignation was her numerous disagreements with her nephew. She asked for Charles's permission to leave the Netherlands upon her resignation, fearing that she would be drawn into politics <b>again</b> <b>if</b> she remained.|$|E

5|$|The {{years after}} the Black Death left many women widows; in the wider economy labour was in short supply and land was {{suddenly}} readily available. In rural areas peasant women could enjoy a better standard of living than ever before, but {{the amount of work}} being done by women may have increased. Many other women travelled to the towns and cities, {{to the point where they}} outnumbered men in some settlements. There they worked with their husbands, or in a limited number of occupations, including spinning, making clothes, victualling and as servants. Some women became full-time ale brewers, until they were pushed out of business by the male-dominated beer industry in the 15th century. Higher status jobs and apprenticeships, however, remained closed to women. As in earlier times, noblewomen exercised power on their estates in their husbands' absence and <b>again,</b> <b>if</b> necessary, defended them in sieges and skirmishes. Wealthy widows who could successfully claim their rightful share of their late husband's property could live as powerful members of the community in their own right.|$|E
5|$|With the {{accuracy}} of the timing systems, ties are rare. Ties between different athletes are resolved as follows: In determining whether there has been a tie in any round for a qualifying position for the next round based on time, a judge (called the chief photo finish judge) must consider the actual time recorded by the athletes to one thousandth of a second. If the judge decides {{that there has been a}} tie, the tying athletes must be placed in the next round or, if that is not practicable, lots must be drawn to determine who must be placed in the next round. In the case of a tie for first place in any final, the referee decides whether it is practicable to arrange for the athletes so tying to compete <b>again.</b> <b>If</b> he decides it is not, the result stands. Ties in other placings remain.|$|E

25|$|Duty {{was sentenced}} to death for {{strangling}} a fellow inmate at Oklahoma State Penitentiary in December 2001. At the time, Duty had been serving a life sentence for a 1978 conviction of rape, robbery and shooting with intent to kill. He did not contest the murder charge and vowed that he would kill <b>again</b> <b>if</b> he was not executed.|$|E
25|$|Since it {{is usually}} {{required}} that the suspects be asked if they understand their rights, courts have also ruled that any subsequent waiver of Miranda rights must be knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. Many American police departments have pre-printed Miranda waiver forms which a suspect must sign and date (after hearing and reading the warnings <b>again)</b> <b>if</b> an interrogation is to occur.|$|E

However, he also warned that the pro-government demonstrators remain fully prepared to hit the streets once <b>again</b> <b>if</b> the need arises.|$|E
