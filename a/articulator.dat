40|$|Certain speech modifications, such as {{changes in}} foreign/regional accents or articulatory styles, are {{performed}} more {{effectively in the}} articulatory domain than in the acoustic domain. Though measuring <b>articulators</b> is cumbersome, articulatory parameters may be estimated from acoustics through inversion. In this paper, we study the impact on synthesis quality when <b>articulators</b> predicted from acoustics are used in articulatory synthesis. For this purpose, we trained a GMM articulatory synthesizer and drove it with <b>articulators</b> predicted with an RBF-based inversion model. Using inverted instead of measured <b>articulators</b> degraded synthesis quality, as measured through Mel cepstral distortion and subjective tests. However, retraining the synthesizer with predicted <b>articulators</b> not only reversed the effect of errors introduced during inversion but also improved synthesis quality relative to using measured <b>articulators.</b> These results suggest that inverted <b>articulators</b> do not compromise synthesis quality, and open up the possibility of performing speech modification in the articulatory domain through inversion.

40|$|AbstractThis study investigates how {{speakers}} of American English use multimodal articulation when quoting characters in personal narratives. We use {{the concept of}} role shift, adapted from signed languages, where it refers to a device used to represent one or more characters {{with one or more}} bodily <b>articulators,</b> to describe multimodal role shift practices. In a regression analysis, four bodily <b>articulators</b> were found to predict the impression of a role shift: character intonation, character facial expressions, character viewpoint gestures, and changes in body orientation; gaze was not a significant predictor. Most of the 704 quotes in our data are accompanied by activation of two or three <b>articulators</b> (55. 3 %) and very few (2. 6 %) occur without any of the <b>articulators</b> we have annotated. The extent of multimodal articulation depends on the type of quoted utterance: quotations of actual, witnessed speech events tend to garner fewer <b>articulators</b> than constructed (‘fictive interaction’) quotations. These findings demonstrate that speakers, like signers, use a range of bodily <b>articulators</b> when they take on another's role in quotation and thus underpin the importance of investigating the systematic use of the visual modality in quotation and, more generally, in ordinary interaction...|$|R

25|$|The McGurk {{effect can}} be {{observed}} when the listener is also the speaker or <b>articulator.</b> While looking at oneself {{in the mirror and}} articulating visual stimuli while listening to another auditory stimulus, a strong McGurk {{effect can be}} observed. In the other condition, where the listener speaks auditory stimuli softly while watching another person articulate the conflicting visual gestures, a McGurk effect can still be seen, although it is weaker.|$|E
25|$|The {{activation}} pattern {{within the}} motor map determines the movement pattern of all model articulators (lips, tongue, velum, glottis) for a speech item. In {{order not to}} overload the model, no detailed modeling of the neuromuscular system is done. The Maeda articulatory speech synthesizer is used in order to generate <b>articulator</b> movements, which allows the generation of a time-varying vocal tract form and the generation of the acoustic speech signal for each particular speech item.|$|E
25|$|The large {{focus on}} the {{possibility}} of simultaneity in sign languages in contrast to spoken languages is sometimes exaggerated, though. The use of two manual articulators is subject to motor constraints, resulting in a large extent of symmetry or signing with one <b>articulator</b> only. Further, sign languages, just like spoken languages, depend on linear sequencing of signs to form sentences; the greater use of simultaneity is mostly seen in the morphology (internal structure of individual signs).|$|E

40|$|American Sign Language {{shares with}} spoken {{languages}} derivational and inflectional morphological processes, including compounding, reduplication, incorporation, and, arguably, templates. Like spoken languages, ASL {{also has an}} extensive nonderivational, noninflectional morphology involving phonological alternation although this is typically more limited. Additionally, ASL frequently associates meaning with individual phonological parameters. This association is atypical of spoken languages. We account for these phenomena by positing “ion-morphs,” which are phonologically incomplete lexical items that bond with other compatible ion-morphs. These ion-morphs draw lexical items into “families” of related signs. In contrast, ASL makes little, if any, use of concatenative affixation, a morphological mechanism common among spoken languages. We propose that this difference {{is the result of}} the comparative slowness of movement of the manual <b>articulators</b> as compared to the speech <b>articulators,</b> as well as the perceptual robustness of the manual <b>articulators</b> to the visual system. The slowness of the manual <b>articulators</b> disfavors concatenative affixation. The perceptual robustness of the manual <b>articulators</b> allows ASL to exploit morphological potential that spoken language can use only at considerable cost...|$|R
25|$|The larynx or {{voice box}} is an organ {{in the neck}} housing the vocal folds, which are {{responsible}} for phonation. In humans, the larynx is descended. Our species is not unique in this respect: goats, dogs, pigs and tamarins lower the larynx temporarily, to emit loud calls. Several deer species have a permanently lowered larynx, which may be lowered still further by males during their roaring displays. Lions, jaguars, cheetahs and domestic cats also do this. However, laryngeal descent in nonhumans (according to Philip Lieberman) is not accompanied by descent of the hyoid; hence the tongue remains horizontal in the oral cavity, preventing it from acting as a pharyngeal <b>articulator.</b>|$|E
25|$|Flaps also {{contrast}} with trills, where the airstream causes the <b>articulator</b> to vibrate. Trills may be realized {{as a single}} contact, like a flap, but are variable, whereas a flap {{is limited to a}} single contact. When a trill is brief and made with a single contact it is sometimes erroneously described as an (allophonic) flap, but a true flap is an active articulation whereas a trill is a passive articulation. That is, for a tap or flap the tongue makes an active gesture to contact the target place of articulation, whereas with a trill the contact is due to the vibration caused by the airstream rather than any active movement.|$|E
25|$|Most bite mark {{analysis}} studies use porcine skin (pigskin), {{because it}} {{is comparable to the}} skin of a human, and it is considered unethical to bite a human for study in the United States. Limitations to the bite mark studies include differences in properties of pigskin compared to human skin and the technique of using simulated pressures to create bite marks. Although similar histologically, pigskin and human skin behave in dynamically different ways due to differences in elasticity. Furthermore, postmortem bites on nonhuman skin, such as those used in the experiments of Martin-de-las Heras et al., display different patterns to those seen in antemortem bite injuries. In recognition of the limitations of their study, Kouble and Craig suggest using a G-clamp on an <b>articulator</b> in future studies to standardize the amount of pressure used to produce experimental bite marks instead of applying manual pressure to models on pigskin. Future research and technological developments may help reduce the occurrence of such limitations.|$|E

40|$|This paper explores whether articulatory {{features}} predicted from speech acoustics through inversion {{may be used}} to boost the recognition of context-dependent units when combined with acoustic features. For this purpose, we performed articulatory inversion on a corpus containing acoustic and electromagnetic articulography recordings from a single speaker.

To make good use of the limited corpus, we used a factorized representation that first classified diphones into broad overlapping categories and then combined them using a maximum-a-posteriori criterion. When comparing the individual feature sets, our results show no degradation in classification performance when predicted <b>articulators</b> are used instead of ground-truth <b>articulators.</b> Further, performance on the acoustic feature set improved by 10 % when adding ground-truth <b>articulators</b> and by 5 % when adding predicted <b>articulators.</b> Index Terms: Articulatory inversion, boosting speech recognition, Maeda parameter...|$|R

2500|$|Many {{linguists}} use {{the terms}} tap and flap indiscriminately. Peter Ladefoged proposed {{for a while}} {{that it might be}} useful to distinguish between them. However, his usage was inconsistent, contradicting itself even between different editions of the same text. One proposed version of the distinction was that a tap strikes its point of contact directly, as a very brief stop, whereas a flap strikes the point of contact tangentially: [...] "Flaps are most typically made by retracting the tongue tip behind the alveolar ridge and moving it forward so that it strikes the ridge in passing." [...] Later, however, he used the term flap in all cases. Subsequent work on the labiodental flap has clarified the issue: flaps involve retraction of the active <b>articulator,</b> and a forward-striking movement. For linguists that do make the distinction, the alveolar tap is transcribed as a fish-hook ar, , while the flap can be transcribed as a small capital dee, , which is not recognized by the IPA. [...] In IPA terms the retroflex flap [...] symbol captures the initial retraction and subsequent forward movement of the tongue tip involved. Otherwise alveolars are typically called taps, and other articulations flaps. No language has been confirmed to contrast a tap and a flap at the same place of articulation. However, such a distinction has been claimed for Norwegian, where the alveolar apical tap [...] and the post-alveolar/retroflex apical flap [...] do not differ in place for all speakers.|$|E

The traveller in Arabia will always be told that some remote clan still produces mighty bards, and uses in conversation the terminal vowels of the classic tongue, but he will not believe these assertions till personally convinced of their truth. The Badawi dialect, however, though debased, is still, as of yore, purer than {{the language of the}} citizens. During the days when philology was a passion in the East, those Stephens and Johnsons of Semitic lore, Firuzabadi and Al-Zamakhshari, wandered from tribe to tribe and from tent to tent, collecting words and elucidating disputed significations. Their grammatical expeditions are still remembered, and are favourite stories with scholars. [FN#33] I say “skilful in reading,” because the Arabs, like the Spaniards, hate to hear their language mangled by mispronunciation. When Burckhardt, who spoke badly, began to read verse to the Badawin, they could not refrain from a movement of impatience, and used to snatch the book out of his hands. [FN#34] The civilized poets of the Arab cities throw the charm of the Desert over their verse, by images borrowed from its scenery—the dromedary, the mirage, and the well—as naturally as certain of our songsters, confessedly haters of the country, babble of lowing kine, shady groves, spring showers, and purling rills. [FN#35] Some will object to this expression; Arabic being a harsh and guttural tongue. But the sound of language, in the first place, depends chiefly upon the <b>articulator.</b> Who thinks German rough in the mouth of a woman, with a suspicion of a lisp, or that English is the dialect of birds, when spoken by an Italian? Secondly, there is a music far more spirit-stirring in harshness than in softness: the languages of Castile and of Tuscany are equally beautiful, yet who does not prefer the sound of the former? The gutturality of Arabia is less offensive than that of the highlands of Barbary. Professor Willis, of Cambridge, attributes the broad sounds and the guttural consonants of mountaineers and the people of elevated plains to the physical action of cold. Conceding this to be a partial cause, I would rather refer the phenomenon to the habit of loud speaking, acquired by the dwellers in tents, and by those who live much in the open air. The Todas of the Neilgherry Hills have given the soft Tamil all the harshness of Arabic, and he who hears them calling to each other from the neighbouring peaks, can remark the process of broadening vowel and gutturalising consonant. On the other hand, the Gallas and the Persians, also a mountain-people, but inhabiting houses, speak comparatively soft tongues. The Cairenes actually omit some of the harshest sounds of Arabia, turning Makass into Ma’as, and Sakka into Sa’a. It is impossible to help remarking the bellowing of the Badawi when he first enters a dwelling-place, and the softening of the sound when he has become accustomed to speak within walls. Moreover, it is to be observed there is a great difference of articulation, not pronunciation, among the several Badawi clans. The Benu Auf are recognised by their sharp, loud, and sudden speech, which the citizens compare to the barking of dogs. The Benu Amr, on the contrary, speak with a soft and drawling sound. The Hutaym, in addition to other peculiarities, add a pleonastic “ah,” to soften the termination of words, as A’atini hawajiyah, (for hawaiji), “Give me my clothes.” [FN#36] The Germans have returned for inspiration to the old Eastern source. Ruckert was guided by Jalal al-Din to the fountains of Sufyism. And even the French have of late made an inroad into Teutonic mysticism successfully enough to have astonished Racine and horrified La Harpe. [FN#37] This, however, does not prevent the language becoming optionally most precise in meaning; hence its high philosophical character. The word “farz,” for instance, means, radically “cutting,” secondarily “ordering,” or “paying a debt,” after which come numerous meanings foreign to the primal sense, such as a shield, part of a tinder-box, an unfeathered arrow, and a particular kind of date. In theology it is limited to a single signification, namely, a divine command revealed in the Koran. Under these circumstances the Arabic becomes, in grammar, logic, rhetoric, and mathematics, as perfect and precise as Greek. I have heard Europeans complain that it is unfit for mercantile transactions.—Perhaps! [FN#38] As a general rule there is a rhyme {{at the end of every}} second line, and the unison is a mere fringe—a long a, for instance, throughout the poem sufficing for the delicate ear of the Arab. In this they were imitated by the old Spaniards, who, neglecting the consonants, merely required the terminating vowels to be alike. We speak of the “sort of harmonious simple flow which atones for the imperfect nature of the rhyme.” But the fine organs of some races would be hurt by that ponderous unison which a people of blunter senses find necessary to produce an impression. The reader will feel this after perusing in “Percy’s Reliques” Rio Verde! Rio Verde! and its translation. [FN#39] In our knightly ages the mare was ridden only by jugglers and charlatans. Did this custom arise from the hatred of, and contempt for, the habits of the Arabs, imported into Europe by the Crusaders? Certainly the popular Eastern idea of a Frank was formed in those days, and survives to these. [FN#40] Baron Von Hammer-Purgstall, in the “Falkner-Klee,” calls this bird the “Saker-falke.” Hence the French and English names sacre and saker. The learned John Beckmann (History of Inventions, Discoveries, and Origins: sub voce) derives falconry from India, where, “as early as the time of Ctesias, hares and foxes were hunted by means of rapacious birds.” I believe, however, that no trace of this sport is found in the writings of the Hindus. Beckmann agrees with Giraldus, against other literati, that the ancient Greeks knew the art of hawking, and proves from Aristotle, that in Thrace men trained falcons. But Aristotle alludes to the use of the bird, as an owl is employed in Italy: the falcon is described as frightening, not catching the birds. Œlian corroborates Aristotle’s testimony. Pliny, however, distinctly asserts that the hawks strike their prey down. “In Italy it was very common,” says the learned Beckmann, “for Martial and Apuleius speak of it as a thing everywhere known. Hence the science spread over Europe, and reached perfection at the principal courts in the twelfth century.” The Emperor Frederic II. wrote “De Arte Venandi cum Avibus,” and the royal author was followed by a host of imitators in the vulgar tongue. Though I am not aware that the Hindus ever cultivated the art, Œlian, it must be confessed, describes their style of training falcons exactly similar to that in use among the modern Persians, Sindians, and Arabs. The Emperor Frederic owes the “capella,” or hood to the Badawi, and talks of the “most expert falconers” sent to him with various kinds of birds by some of the kings of Arabia. The origin of falconry is ascribed by Al-Mas’udi, on the authority of Adham bin Muhriz, to the king Al-Haris bin Mu’awiyah, and in Dr. Sprenger’s admirable translation the reader will find (pp. 426, 428), much information upon the subject. The Persians claim the invention for their just King, Anushirawan, contemporary with Mohammed. Thence the sport passed into Turkey, where it is said the Sultans maintained a body of 6000 falconers. And Frederic Barbarossa, in the twelfth century, brought falcons to Italy. We may fairly give the honour of the invention to Central Asia. [FN#41] Here called “bandukiyah bi ruhayn,” or the two-mouthed gun. The leathern cover is termed “gushat”; it is a bag with a long-ringed tassel at the top of the barrel, and a strap by which it is slung to the owner’s back. [FN#42] I described elsewhere the Mirzak, or javelin. [FN#43] Ostriches are found in Al-Hijaz, where the Badawin shoot after coursing them. The young ones are caught and tamed, and the eggs may be bought in the Madinah bazar. Throughout Arabia there is a belief that the ostrich throws stones at the hunter. The superstition may have arisen from the pebbles being flung up behind by the bird’s large feet in his rapid flight, or it may be a mere “foolery of fancy.” Even in lands which have long given up animal-worship, wherever a beast is conspicuous or terrible, it becomes the subject of some marvellous tale. So the bear in Persia imitates a moolah’s dress; the wolf in France is a human being transformed, and the beaver of North America, also a metamorphosis, belts trees so as to fell them in the direction most suitable to his after purpose. [FN#44] Not that the “Agrebi” of Bir Hamid and other parts have much to learn of us in vice. The land of Al-Yaman is, I believe, the most demoralised country, and Sana’a the most depraved city in Arabia. The fair sex distinguishes itself by a peculiar laxity of conduct, which is looked upon with an indulgent eye. And the men drink and gamble, to say nothing of other peccadilloes, with perfect impunity. [FN#45] In Al-Yaman, it is believed, that if a man eat three heads of garlic in good mountain-samn (or clarified butter) for forty days, his blood will kill the snake that draws it. [FN#46] Circumcisionis causa apud Arabos manifestissima, ulceratio enim endemica, abrasionem glandis aut praeputii, maxima cum facilitate insequitur.

Capit tunc pugionem tonsor et præputio abscisso detrahit pellem [Greek] ab umbilico incipiens aut parum infra, ventremque usque ad femora nudat. Juvenis autem dextra pugionem super tergum tonsoris vibrans magna clamat voce [Arabic] i.e. caede sine timore. Vae si haesitet tonsor aut si tremeat manus!

[FN#47] The Spanish dollar is most prized in Al-Hijaz; in Al-Yaman the Maria Theresa. The Spanish Government has refused to perpetuate its Pillar-dollar, which at one time was so great a favourite in the East. The traveller wonders how “Maria Theresas” still supply both shores of the Red Sea. The marvel is easily explained: the Austrians receive silver at Milan, and stamp it for a certain percentage. This coin was doubtless preferred by the Badawin for its superiority to the currency of the day: they make from it ornaments for their women and decorations for their weapons. The generic term for dollars is “Riyal Fransah.” [FN#48] Torale, sicut est mos Judaicus et Persicus, non inspiciunt. Novae nuptae tamen maritus mappam manu capit: mane autem puellae mater virginitatis signa viris mulieribusque domi ostendit eosque jubilare jubet quod calamitas domestica, sc. filia, intacta abiit. Si non ostendeant mappam, maeret domus, “prima enim Venus” in Arabia, “debet esse cruenta.” Maritus autem humanior, etiamsi absit sanguis, cruore palumbino mappam tingit et gaudium fingens cognatis parentibusque ostendit; paululum postea puellae nonnulla causa dat divortium. Hic urbis et ruris mos idem est. [FN#49] An explanation of this term will be found below. [FN#50] It is the plural of “Kaum,” which means “rising up in rebellion or enmity against,” as well as the popular signification, a “people.” In some parts of Arabia it is used for a “plundering party.” [FN#51] Bayt (in the plural Buyut) is used in this sense to denote the tents of the nomades. “Bayt” radically means a “nighting-place”; thence a tent, a house, a lair, &c., &c. [FN#52] Some tribes will not sell their sheep, keeping them for guests or feasts. [FN#53] So the word is pronounced at Meccah. The dictionaries give “Aakal,” which in Eastern Arabia is corrupted to “Igal.” [FN#54] Called “Tatarif,” plural of Tatrifah, a cartridge. [FN#55] The liver and the spleen are both supposed to be “congealed blood.” Niebuhr has exhausted the names and the description of the locust. In Al-Hijaz they have many local and fantastic terms: the smallest kind, for instance, is called Jarad Iblis, Satan’s locust. [FN#56] This is the Kurut of Sind and the Kashk of Persia. The butter-milk, separated from the butter by a little water, is simmered over a slow fire, thickened with wheaten flour, about a handful to a gallon, well-mixed, so that no knots remain in it, and allowed to cool. The mixture is then put into a bag and strained, after which salt is sprinkled over it. The mass begins to harden after a few hours, when it is made up into balls and dried in the sun. [FN#57] The North American trappers adopted this natural prejudice: the “free trapper” called his more civilized confrere, “mangeur de lard.” [FN#58] Burckhardt shrank from the intricate pedigree of the Meccan Sharifs. I have seen a work upon the subject in four folio volumes in point of matter equivalent to treble the number in Europe. The best known genealogical works are Al-Kalkashandi (originally in seventy-five books, extended to one hundred); the Umdat al-Tullab by Ibn Khaldun; the “Tohfat al-Arab fi Ansar al-Arab,” a well-known volume by Al-Siyuti; and, lastly, the Sirat al-Halabi, in six volumes 8vo. Of the latter work there is an abridgment by Mohammed al-Banna al-Dimyati in two volumes 8vo.; but both are rare, and consequently expensive. [FN#59] I give the following details of the Harb upon the authority of my friend Omar Effendi, who is great in matters of genealogy. [FN#60]The first word is the plural, the second the singular form of the word. [FN#61] In the singular Aufi and Amri. [FN#62] To these Mr. Cole adds seven other sub-divisions, viz.:— 1. Ahali al-Kura (“the people of Kura?”), 5000. 2. Radadah, 800. 3. Hijlah, 600. 4. Dubayah, 1500. 5. Benu Kalb, 2000. 6. Bayzanah, 800. 7. Benu Yahya, 800. And he makes the total of the Benu Harb about Al-Jadaydah amount to 35,000 men. I had no means of personally ascertaining the correctness of this information. [FN#63] The reader will remember that nothing like exactitude in numbers can be expected from an Arab. Some rate the Benu Harb at 6000; others, equally well informed, at 15,000; others again at 80,000. The reason of this is that, whilst one is speaking of the whole race, another may be limiting it to his own tribe and its immediate allies. [FN#64] “Sham” which, properly speaking, means Damascus or Syria, in Southern Arabia and Eastern Africa is universally applied to Al-Hijaz.|$|E

40|$|Several {{studies in}} the past have shown that the {{features}} based on the kinematics of speech <b>articulators</b> improve the phonetic recognition accuracy when combined with the acoustic features.

On the other hand, the speech <b>articulators</b> are recorded using electromagnetic articulography (EMA), which requires highly specialized equipment. Thus, the latter is not directly available in practice and hence usually estimated from speech using acoustic-to-articulatory inversion. In this work, we compare the information provided by the visible and the estimated <b>articulators</b> about different phonetic classes when used with and without acoustic features. The information provided by different visible, articulatory, acoustic and combined features is quantified by the mutual information (MI). For this study, we have created a large phonetically rich audio-visual (PRAV) dataset comprising of 9000 TIMIT sentences spoken by four subjects. Experiments using PRAV corpus reveal that the articulatory features estimated by inversion are more informative than the visible features but less informative than the acoustic features. This suggests that the advantage of visible articulatory features in recognition could be achieved by recovering them from the acoustic signal itself...|$|R
40|$|Fingerspelling is a {{category}} of American Sign Language (ASL) signs that are signed sequentially as an alphabetic representation. The present study proposes to examine the coarticulation and feature-spreading characteristics of fingerspelling. A preliminary study identified feature categories to be examined. In keeping with these results and feature categories, three hypotheses were constructed: (1) anticipatory effects are more common than perseverative effects, (2) coarticulation is most prevalent word medially, rather than word initially or word finally, and (3) larger <b>articulators</b> show spreading more often than smaller <b>articulators</b> and spread across multiple handshapes. To test these hypotheses, five fluent ASL fingerspellers were recorded and the data was examined in reference to these three hypotheses. After analysis of this data, the first hypothesis {{was found to be}} supported. The second hypothesis was strengthened by this data. The third hypothesis developed from a simple division of large <b>articulators</b> versus small <b>articulators</b> into a complex hierarchy of features.

These models are assembled into an audiovisual talking head that can produce augmented audiovisual speech, i. e. can display usually non visible <b>articulators</b> such as tongue or velum. The talking head is then animated by recovering its control parameters by inversion from the coordinates of a small number of points of the <b>articulators</b> of the same speaker tracked by Electro-Magnetic Articulography. The augmented speech produced points the way to promising applications in the domain of speech therapy for speech retarded children, perception and production rehabilitation of hearing impaired children, and pronunciation training for second language learners...|$|R
5000|$|An {{obstruction}} {{is necessarily}} formed when two articulators come close together. Generally, one is moving (the active <b>articulator),</b> {{and the other}} is stationary (the passive <b>articulator).</b> As a result, what is normally termed the [...] "place of articulation" [...] is actually a combination of a place of active articulation and a place of passive articulation. For example, the English f sound is —a shorthand way of saying that the active <b>articulator</b> is the lower lip, which moves up (along with the jaw in general) to contact the upper teeth. The lower lip can also be the active <b>articulator</b> for other places of articulation (e.g. , where it contacts the upper lip, as in English p). Likewise, the upper teeth can be the passive <b>articulator</b> for other places of articulation (e.g. , where the tongue contacts the upper teeth, as in the English th sound).|$|E
5000|$|In 1920, Dr. Rupert E. Hall {{worked with}} Hanau on the {{creation}} of an <b>articulator.</b> Hanau attended the Boston meeting of the National Society of Denture Prosthetists, where he learned more about articulators. Upon returning from the meeting, Hanau started working with articulators. He then developed the Model A <b>articulator,</b> for which he filed a patient in 1921. He revealed his C Prototype <b>articulator</b> at the Milwaukee meeting of the National Society of Denture Prosthetists in 1921.|$|E

40|$|We present here a {{three-dimensional}} {{finite element model}} of the vocal tract that is derived from a physiologically based model of the speech <b>articulators.</b> The model is constructed {{in such a way}} as to allow its shape to vary as the <b>articulators</b> move. The motivation is to simulate the dynamics of the human vocal tract shape in response to the movements of surrounding <b>articulators</b> in speech. For the short English sentences tested in this model, the time-varying area functions obtained via the model simulation are compared with area functions computed from the speech audio by LPC analysis in order to validate the model. These results show that the model is able to provide a realistic representation of the timevarying vocal tract, even with the simplifications that were made. 1...|$|R
