5|$|In September 1913, the United Mine Workers {{called a}} strike against coal-mining {{companies}} in Ludlow, Colorado. The largest mining company was the Rockefeller family-owned Colorado Fuel & Iron Company. On April20, 1914, the Colorado National Guard attacked <b>a</b> <b>tent</b> colony of striking miners {{and their families}} and, during a day-long fight, 26 people were killed.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) {{finalized}} {{plans to}} overhaul the station completely. In 1999, the MTA requested $125 million in federal funding for the renovation. As part of renovation, a group of satellite dishes was proposed for the station. By this point, the New York City Transit Police were operating from <b>a</b> <b>tent</b> adjacent to the station, and there were vestiges of a carousel within the station.|$|E
5|$|Heaphy's {{contract}} with the company was for three years, primarily to create art {{that could be used}} as advertising for the company. In doing so he travelled extensively around the country and occasionally participated in overland treks, living out of <b>a</b> <b>tent</b> or staying with local Māori. He also sailed around parts of the country aboard the Tory and learned surveying from its captain. Another employee of the company travelling on the Tory was Ernst Dieffenbach, who taught Heaphy basic geology.|$|E

5|$|On 20 August 1944, Derrick {{was posted}} to an officer cadet {{training}} unit in Victoria. He requested {{that he be}} allowed to rejoin the 2/48th Battalion {{at the end of}} the course; contrary to normal Army policy that prevented officers commissioned from the ranks from returning to their previous units. An exemption was granted to Derrick only after much lobbying. While at this unit, Derrick shared <b>a</b> <b>tent</b> with Reg Saunders, who later became the Army's first Indigenous Australian officer.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 13 December Mawson and Mertz rearranged the sledges. The rear-most sledge, which had carried the most weight, was well-worn, {{and they decided to}} abandon it. The {{remaining}} supplies were re-distributed between the remaining two sledges. Most of the important supplies—the tent and most of the food—were stored on the new rear sledge; if they were to lose a sledge down a crevasse, they reasoned, it would be the front, less-vital sledge. As the rear sledge was heavier, the strongest of remaining dogs were assigned to pull it. At the camp they left a small amount of supplies, including the abandoned sledge and <b>a</b> <b>tent</b> cover, without the floor or poles.|$|E
5|$|Since {{much of the}} {{criticism}} {{is the result of}} photos and videos taken during the hunt and slaughter, it is now common for the final capture and slaughter to take place on site inside <b>a</b> <b>tent</b> or under a plastic cover, out of sight from the public. The most circulated footage is probably that of the drive and subsequent capture and slaughter process taken in Futo in October 1999 (a still of which can be seen on the right), shot by the Japanese animal welfare organization Elsa Nature Conservancy. Part of this footage was, amongst others, shown on CNN.|$|E

5|$|Swamikannu Vincent, who {{had built}} the first cinema of south India in Coimbatore, {{introduced}} the concept of Tent Cinema in which <b>a</b> <b>tent</b> was erected on an open land to screen the films. Central Studios {{was set up in}} 1935 while S. M. Sriramulu Naidu established Pakshiraja Studios in 1945. The city conducts its own music festival every year. Art, dance and music concerts are held annually during the months of September and December (Tamil calendar month – Margazhi). Coimbatore also houses a number of museums and art galleries like G.D. Naidu Museum & Industrial Exhibition, H A Gass Forest Museum, Government Museum, Kadhi Gandhi Gallery and Kasthuri Srinivasan Art Gallery and Textile Museum.|$|E
5|$|The 4th Light Horse Brigade {{casualties}} were one other rank killed, one officer and nine other ranks wounded. These wounded soldiers were probably {{treated by the}} 4th Light Horse Field Ambulance {{which was in the}} field a couple of miles past Al-Faluja. The ambulance had itself suffered two casualties when subjected to artillery fire from the hills. But they halted and put up <b>a</b> <b>tent</b> and after dark took in eight more patients all hit by high-explosive shells from the 4th Light Horse Regiment. They were busy until midnight; two seriously wounded soldiers being evacuated to a Casualty Clearing Station and the rest were kept till morning.|$|E
5|$|A {{category}} of ticket packages {{was created to}} be sold by an auction process at prices estimated at up to $1,000. All proceeds were donated to Music for Relief, a non-profit organization founded by Linkin Park to support disaster relief and programs to protect and restore the environment. Additionally, one dollar per concert ticket sold was contributed to the charity. <b>A</b> <b>tent</b> of Music for Relief was staffed by local volunteers at each concert. The tent featured a photo booth which enabled fans to document their concert experience and express their support to take action on climate change, {{leading up to the}} United Nations Climate Summit that took place on September 23, 2014 in New York City. Various clean energy tools were also showcased.|$|E
50|$|Arbor Daze is {{a celebration}} of trees. It is usually held on the last weekend of April from Saturday to Sunday. The {{location}} of Arbor Daze is in the municipal complex. During Arbor Daze there is <b>a</b> business <b>tent,</b> <b>an</b> art <b>tent</b> and two concert stages. There is also <b>a</b> kids <b>tent</b> called Kidz Zone.

5|$|All {{that changed}} with the {{assassination}} of Tsar Alexander II. The mourning for the tsar meant {{there would be no}} performances in the capital; in addition the political climate of Russia turned sharply against the Jews. Goldfaden's troupe soldiered on for a time—to Minsk, to Bobruisk where they played mainly to Russian soldiers, and to Vitebsk, where he and Sonya ended up having to sue Goldfaden for their pay, and left to rejoin Rosenberg, who was playing in <b>a</b> <b>tent</b> theater in Nezhin. However, matters there proved even worse: Nezhin soon fell prey to a pogrom. The troupe managed to avoid bodily harm, partly by convincing the rioters that they were a French theater troupe and partly by making judicious use of the money the Adlers had won in court from Goldfaden.|$|E
5|$|Contemplating {{advocacy}} {{work and}} a run for city council in Newark after graduation from law school, Booker {{lived in the city}} during his final year at Yale. After graduation, he served as staff attorney for the Urban Justice Center in New York and program coordinator of the Newark Youth Project. In 1998, Booker won an upset victory for a seat on the Newark City Council, defeating four-term incumbent George Branch. To draw attention to the problems of open-air drug dealing and associated violence, he went on a 10-day hunger strike and lived in <b>a</b> <b>tent</b> and later in a motor home near drug-dealing areas of the city. Booker proposed council initiatives that impacted housing, young people, law and order, and the efficiency and transparency of city hall, but was regularly outvoted by all of his fellow councilors.|$|E

As Rachel is about to be wed, Tim, Mr. Will, and Clyde pull {{up in front of the}} church in the red Mustang and rescue her. Mr. Will returns to the community and is accepted back with a confession that Rachel has recorded on the blue cassette, although she still firmly believes that God has fathered her child. Some months later, Clyde and a visibly pregnant Rachel are living in <b>a</b> <b>tent</b> by the beach and hold hands as they walk through the waves.|$|E

5|$|In {{the last}} years of his life Constantine made plans for a {{campaign}} against Persia. In a letter written to the king of Persia, Shapur, Constantine had asserted his patronage over Persia's Christian subjects and urged Shapur to treat them well. The letter is undatable. In response to border raids, Constantine sent Constantius to guard the eastern frontier in 335. In 336, prince Narseh invaded Armenia (a Christian kingdom since 301) and installed a Persian client on the throne. Constantine then resolved to campaign against Persia himself. He treated the war as a Christian crusade, calling for bishops to accompany the army and commissioning <b>a</b> <b>tent</b> {{in the shape of a}} church to follow him everywhere. Constantine planned to be baptized in the Jordan River before crossing into Persia. Persian diplomats came to Constantinople over the winter of 336–337, seeking peace, but Constantine turned them away. The campaign was called off, however, when Constantine became sick in the spring of 337.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Andy {{shows up}} at Ann's house wearing a fancy suit. He tells her he has matured, gotten an office job {{and would like to}} get back together, but Ann declines. The camera follows Andy as he leaves, {{revealing}} he is actually living in <b>a</b> <b>tent</b> inside the pit. During the Pawnee Today show, Leslie and Marcia argue fiercely. Leslie insists she has not taken a political position, even after Marcia brings up the recent party at the Bulge. They take several callers, all of whom agree that Leslie should resign. Fed up, Leslie adamantly insists she will not resign, nor will she annul the penguin wedding. Later, she visits Ann and insists that Ann go on a date with Mark. The episode ends with Leslie driving the penguins from the Pawnee Zoo to a zoo in Iowa, where same-sex marriage is legal.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people who}} stay at Glastonbury Festival camp in <b>a</b> <b>tent.</b> There are {{different}} camping areas, {{each with its}} own atmosphere. Limekilns and Hitchin Hill Ground are quieter camping areas, whereas Pennard Hill Ground is a lively campsite. Cockmill Meadow is a family campsite and Wicket Ground was introduced in 2011 as a second family-only campsite. A disabled campsite is also available in Spring Ground. Campsite accommodation is provided in the cost of a standard entry ticket but festival-goers must bring their own tents. Tipis have been at the festival for many years. A limited number of fixed tipis are available for hire at the tipi field near the stone circle. Up to six adults can stay in each tipi and each one comes with a groundsheet and raincatcher. Internal bedding and camping equipment is not provided. Tipi Park also offers solar showers and a log-fired yurt sauna to cap off the experience.|$|E

5|$|Nobody except Leslie {{really cares}} about the trip: Ron (Nick Offerman) just wants to fish, Ben (Adam Scott) failed to bring <b>a</b> <b>tent,</b> and Tom (Aziz Ansari) just wants to relax in his huge tent filled with luxury {{electronic}} items. Tom expresses confusion as to why Ben, a state auditor who had been helping with Pawnee's financial problems, has not returned to his old job at Indianapolis; Ben does not explain his reasons, but it is hinted he harbors romantic feelings for Leslie. Meanwhile, Andy (Chris Pratt) sets up a romantic tent for April (Aubrey Plaza) in the wrong campsite miles away, forcing him to trek through the wilderness to find everyone and leaving April miserable on the campsite without Andy. During brainstorming sessions, nobody produces any good ideas because they assume Leslie will think of one. However, she worriedly confides to Ann and Ben she cannot think of anything {{on the same level}} of the harvest festival.|$|E
5|$|The Pandurs {{took part}} in War of the Austrian Succession, {{including}} the First Silesian War. They {{took part in}} capturing Zobten am Berge and Strehlen in Lower Silesia from the Prussians, and defending a bridgehead near Vienna after the Battle of Mollwitz. In 1742, the Pandurs took part in capture of Klaus Castle in Styria as well as Linz and Deggendorf, where they defeated French troops before taking part in Austrian recapture of Munich. By {{the end of that}} year, the Pandurs had captured Diessenstein Castle and Cham from Bavarian defenders, completely destroying Cham to secure access for Habsburg troops led by Ludwig Andreas von Khevenhüller to Bohemia. In 1743, the Pandurs led by Trenck captured Cosel fortress. In 1745, during the Second Silesian War, the Pandurs took part in the Battle of Soor, where they looted a Prussian war chest containing 80,000ducats, as well as weapons, horses and <b>a</b> <b>tent</b> belonging to Frederick the Great.|$|E
5|$|The main march southward {{from the}} Bluff depot began on 1 January 1916. Within a few days, one team of three {{was forced to}} return to base, {{following}} the failure of their Primus stove. The other six carried on: Mackintosh, Joyce, Ernest Wild, Dick Richards, Arnold Spencer-Smith and Victor Hayward. The 80° depot laid the previous season was reinforced, and new depots were built at 81° and 82°. As the party moved on towards the vicinity of Mount Hope, both Mackintosh and Spencer-Smith, the expedition's photographer, were hobbling. Shortly after the 83° mark was passed, Spencer-Smith collapsed and was left in <b>a</b> <b>tent</b> while the others struggled on the remaining few miles. Mackintosh rejected the suggestion that he should remain with the invalid, insisting {{that it was his}} duty to ensure that every depot was laid. On 26 January, Mount Hope was attained and the final depot put in place.|$|E
