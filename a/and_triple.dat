5|$|On July 23, 2012, McMahon made an {{appearance}} on the 1000th episode of Raw where she confronted and then slapped Paul Heyman to convince him to accept a match between Brock Lesnar <b>and</b> <b>Triple</b> H at SummerSlam. On April 6, 2013, McMahon inducted former on-screen rival Trish Stratus into the WWE Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|On the October 27 {{episode of}} Raw, after John Cena, the #1 {{contender}} for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, rejected an offer to join the Authority, Triple H announced a Traditional Survivor Series tag team elimination match, with a team representing the Authority facing a team captained by Cena. On the November 3 episode of Raw, Vince McMahon announced that if Team Authority loses at Survivor Series, the Authority will be ousted from power. During the match, Triple H {{tried to get the}} last member of Team Cena, Dolph Ziggler, eliminated by attacking two referees and placing Seth Rollins (who was also the final member of Team Authority) on top of Ziggler and calling crooked referee Scott Armstrong into the ring to make the count, however the debuting Sting came out and attacked Armstrong <b>and</b> <b>Triple</b> H, giving Team Cena the win and thus disbanding The Authority. Stephanie <b>and</b> <b>Triple</b> H appeared on the episode of Raw after Survivor Series stating that without them the company would be driven to the ground. They were then escorted out of the arena by the returning Daniel Bryan and only to be insulted by Mr.McMahon for letting him down and the McMahon family before exiting the arena. On the December 29 episode of Raw, The Authority was brought back in power by John Cena, and she and her husband entered and stepped on the entrance ramp celebrating their return with a glass of champagne and a kiss. Stephanie <b>and</b> <b>Triple</b> H then proceeded to fire Erick Rowan, Ryback and Dolph Ziggler.|$|E
5|$|The Division Bell reached {{number one}} in the UK and the US but {{received}} mixed reviews. It was followed by a tour of the US and Europe.

5|$|The {{main event}} was a Triple Threat {{match for the}} World Heavyweight Championship between Chris Benoit, Shawn Michaels <b>and</b> <b>Triple</b> H. One spot in the match saw Michaels miss a flying bodypress and crash through a {{broadcast}} table. Another included Triple H assaulting Michaels with a sledgehammer. The last moments in the match saw Benoit force Michaels submit to the sharpshooter to retain the title.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was the Triple Threat {{match for the}} WWE Championship between {{champion}} John Cena, Edge, <b>and</b> <b>Triple</b> H. As the match began, Edge chose to stand outside the ring, hoping that Cena <b>and</b> <b>Triple</b> H would simply fight the match themselves. Cena <b>and</b> <b>Triple</b> H, however, teamed up and turned against Edge. One spot in the match saw Edge catapult Triple H into the steel ringpost, which made Triple H bleed. Afterwards, Edge executed an Edgecution onto an announce table on Triple H and then focused on Cena. Cena, however, locked Edge in the STFU, but was broken when Triple H hit Cena {{in the head with}} a microphone. Triple H then went after Edge and hit him with a chair, sending him over the security wall and into the audience. Lita, who accompanied Edge, entered the ring with a chair to hit Triple H, but Triple H reversed it into a Spinebuster, a move where the wrestler lifts the opponent, turning 180°, and then tosses her forward onto her back. Near the end of the match, Cena attempted an FU on Edge but Triple H delivered a low blow to Cena, which made Cena drop Edge out of the ring and attempted to execute a Pedigree. Cena, however, countered it into a jackknife roll-up. Cena won the match and successfully retained the WWE Championship. After the match, Triple H hit Cena, Edge, and the referee with a sledgehammer, and performed his signature taunt until performing his signature DX cross chops, receiving a standing ovation from the audience, closing the show.|$|E
5|$|The {{seventh and}} final match was between Randy Orton <b>and</b> <b>Triple</b> H for the World Heavyweight Championship. Both Orton <b>and</b> <b>Triple</b> H {{managed to get}} the upper hand in the match. During the match, Ric Flair and Batista {{interfered}} on behalf of Triple H, as they attacked Orton while the referee was knocked out. Jonathan Coachman also took part in the match as he ran down with a referee shirt and tried to act as a guest referee. Orton {{managed to get the}} upper hand over Flair, Batista and Coachman as he delivered an RKO on all of them. Triple H, however, managed to hit Orton with a steel chair, which proceeded with a Pedigree onto the same chair. Batista then rolled the referee into the ring, as Triple H covered Orton for the win via pinfall.|$|E

The long <b>and</b> <b>triple</b> jump areas run {{alongside}} the central 60m track and are mostly identical in form to their outdoor counterparts. The pole vault track and landing area are also alongside the central running track. Shot put (or weight throw) is the only throwing event held indoors due to size restrictions. The throwing area {{is similar to the}} outdoor event, but the landing sector is a rectangular section surrounded by netting or a stop barrier.|$|E

5|$|Eleven {{male athletes}} competed {{in track and}} field events on behalf of the Bahamas. Of those athletes, three participated in the 4×400 meters relay only (Williams, Moncur, Miller); five participated only in events other than the 4×400 meters relay (Atkins, Rolle, L. Sands, S. Sands, and Thomas), and three participated in both an {{individual}} event and the 4×400 meters relay. Of the individual events, Bahamian athletes were involved in six distinct events (100 meters, 40 meters, 200 meters, triple jump, 110 meters hurdles, and high jump). The two Bahamian medals won at Beijing were won by men {{in track and field}} events (4×400 meters relay <b>and</b> <b>triple</b> jump).|$|E
5|$|In 2001, The Hardyz began feuding with Stone Cold Steve Austin <b>and</b> <b>Triple</b> H (known as The Power Trip), {{which also}} led to a singles push for both Matt and Jeff. Hardy helped Jeff defeat Triple H for the Intercontinental Championship, and shortly after Hardy {{defeated}} Eddie Guerrero to win the European Championship on SmackDown! four days before Backlash. At Backlash he retained the title against Guerrero and Christian in a triple threat, and against Edge the following night on RAW. Hardy held the championship for 125 days, making him the second-longest reigning European Champion in history and the longest-reigning American-born European Champion.|$|E

5|$|In May, McMahon signed another {{handicap}} match, with The Spirit Squad facing Michaels. The Spirit Squad instead attacked Michaels {{before the}} match started, <b>and</b> <b>Triple</b> H {{came out to}} help The Spirit Squad. Triple H felt disrespected by The Spirit Squad however, and as a result, helped Michaels instead. This led to Triple H and Michaels reforming D-Generation X (DX) and they began a feud with The Spirit Squad. DX played various sophomoric jokes on The Spirit Squad and the McMahons, as well as defeating The Spirit Squad in handicap tag team matches at Vengeance and a clean sweep in an elimination handicap match at Saturday Night's Main Event.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} weeks, The Rock continued his feud with Triple H and eventually won his fourth WWF Championship, which he won on April 30 at Backlash after Stone Cold Steve Austin intervened on his behalf. On May 21 at Judgment Day, The Rock <b>and</b> <b>Triple</b> H faced in an Iron Man match with Shawn Michaels as the special guest referee. With the score tied at five falls each and with seconds {{left on the}} time limit The Rock was disqualified when The Undertaker attacked Triple H, thus giving Triple H the 6–5 win and the title. The next night on Raw Is War, The Rock got his revenge by taking out the entire McMahon-Helmsley Faction with The Undertaker's help. The Rock won the WWF Championship for a fifth time at King of the Ring on June 25 by scoring the winning pin in a six-man tag team match, teaming with Kane and The Undertaker against Shane McMahon, Triple H and Vince McMahon, whom he pinned. The Rock successfully defended the championship against Chris Benoit at Fully Loaded on July 23, Kurt Angle <b>and</b> <b>Triple</b> H at SummerSlam on August 27 and Benoit, Kane and The Undertaker at Unforgiven on September 24.|$|E
