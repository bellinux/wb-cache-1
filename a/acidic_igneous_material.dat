It is {{well known}} that basic and <b>acidic</b> <b>igneous</b> bodies are distributed widely within the Shimanto belt, and these igneous rocks have been dated as middle Miocene (approximately 15  Ma; e.g., Underwood et al. 1993). On Muroto Peninsula, such igneous rocks (pillow lava, volcanic breccia, dolerite, and gabbro) are not found in the Eocene-Oligocene Murotohanto subbelt but occur only within the late Oligocene to early Miocene Nabae subbelt. Based on plate reconstructions (Underwood et al. 1993), it is considered that such magmatic activities were related to the subduction of a young oceanic plate (Shikoku basin back-arc spreading ridge) in the middle Miocene.|$|R

This study used a combination of traditional geological techniques, near-surface geophysical surveys and remote sensing to detect and map a buried dolerite sheet intrusion.

50|$|A Peperite is a {{sedimentary}} rock that contains fragments of <b>igneous</b> <b>material</b> and is formed when magma comes {{into contact with}} wet sediments.

50|$|The {{material}} forming LaBarge Rock was injected in {{the form}} of a stock. Over geologic time crustal movement brought these injected igneous rocks to the surface of the earth. The darker, denser <b>igneous</b> <b>material</b> of the injected rock is more resistant to erosion and weathering than the surrounding softer white sandstone and shale, so the harder igneous rock weathered out into distinctive land forms. The LaBarge Rock stock weathered out into the pillar shaped land form seen today.|$|R
5000|$|The current outcrop {{pattern of}} the various units of the Lizard Complex is mainly {{controlled}} by Carboniferous age normal faulting. The earliest structures seen in the ophiolitic rocks are steeply-dipping foliations thought to represent deformation in lithosphere scale shear zones, associated with continental break-up in the early Devonian. Locally thrust contacts can be seen showing evidence of northwestward movement between parts of the ophiolite and between the ophiolitic rocks and the metamorphic basement. It {{has been suggested that}} the Kennack Gneiss (a mixture of basic and <b>acidic</b> <b>igneous</b> rocks) was formed by partial melting during the obduction of the ophiolite onto the continental crust. Although an earlier stage of 'hot' emplacement is not ruled out, it is now generally accepted [...] that in the final stage of emplacement, during the Variscan orogeny, the ophiolite was relatively 'cold'.|$|R
25|$|During recent glaciations, a {{large amount}} of the basalt and sandstone, which erode much more easily than granite, was removed by the glaciers.

50|$|Although {{commonly}} referred to as a plateau, the Millevaches Massif is actually more like a shallow dome, deeply dissected by streams and rivers, and slightly tilted, with the south-eastern edge elevated and more exposed.

40|$|The Alto Tunuyan Foreland Basin {{in western}} Argentina is located {{immediately}} {{south of the}} flat-slab segment of the Central Andes and its evolution {{is directly related to}} the propagation of structures to the east. Petrographic and geochronologic studies have been performed to determine the provenance of syntectonic sediments in the basin in order to establish their relationship to the Andean orogenic activity. The analysed detrital and igneous zircons in contrast with previous data, allow us to restrict the basin age between ca. 15 and 6 Ma. Sandstones record two main contributions, one from andesitic volcanic rocks and the other from an <b>acidic</b> <b>igneous</b> source, the first probably corresponding to Miocene volcanic rocks from the Principal Cordillera (Farellones Formation) and the second to Permo-Triassic, <b>acidic,</b> <b>igneous</b> rocks from the Frontal Cordillera (Choiyoi Magmatic Province, CMP). Two secondary sources have been recorded, sedimentary and metamorphic; the first one is represented by Mesozoic rocks in the Principal Cordillera and the second by the Proterozoic/early Carboniferous Guarguaraz Complex (GC) in the Frontal Cordillera, respectively. Sandstones from the lower basin deposits (15 - 11 Ma) register supply pulses from the Farellones Formation reflecting the unroofing of the Principal Cordillera by uplift pulses during the middle Miocene. Sandstones from the upper basin deposits (ca. 11 - 9 Ma) record an increase in material derived from the CMP, reflecting important uplift of the Frontal Cordillera. A thick, ca. 9 Ma old ignimbrite within the basin indicates an eruption in the Frontal Cordillera. Detrital zircons from the CMP have been detected also in the lower basin deposits, suggesting either recycling of Mesozoic deposits containing CMP zircons or an early paleorelief of the Frontal Cordillera. The good correlation between the age of the detrital zircons of the CMP and the GC in the lower basin deposits supports recycling of Mesozoic sedimentary deposits.

40|$|Abstract: The {{emplacement}} of <b>igneous</b> <b>material</b> into upper crustal {{rocks of}} sedimentary basins {{is likely to}} be strongly controlled by the geometry of the pre-existing basin structures. These controls are investigated using examples from the Tertiary igneous complexes of Skye, part of the Sea of Hebrides basin of NW Scotland. The basin consists of an array of half-graben related to SE-dipping normal faults. These pre-volcanic, Mesozoic structures are traced near the igneous complexes using geological relationships preserved unconformably beneath the widespread basaltic lava fields. The unconformity represents a period of Cretaceous uplift and denudation of the basin and its flanks, entirely pre-dating the Tertiary volcanism of NW Scotland. This unconformity seals stratigraphically the major basin faults, preserving field relationships that permit the tracing of these faults in the country rocks to the Tertiary intrusions. The major Camasunary fault is separated from the Raasay fault via a series of minor graben, linked by a series of steep, NW-SE-trending faults that transfered Mesozoic displace-ments between the principal fault strands. A broad range of <b>igneous</b> <b>material</b> of various compositions was intruded into part of the Mesozoic Sea of Hebrides basins and their flanks during Palaeocene times. Different emplacement styles and different structural controls are found. The major gabbroic centres {{do not appear to be}} controlled b...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} first {{measurements}} of vanadium (V) stable isotopes for six reference materials - USGS PCC- 1, BHVO- 2, BCR- 2, BIR- 1 a, GSP- 2 and AGV- 2 - plus the widely available carbonaceous chondrite Allende. We present standard addition and matrix spiking tests {{to assess the}} robustness and reproducibility of our data. Standard addition utilised an enriched 50 V solution designated VISSOX (Vanadium Isotope Standard Solution OXford). We further assessed the veracity of the method by spiking collected sample matrices with {{the same amount of}} a V standard solution, whose isotopic composition was defined as 0 ‰. Standard addition and matrix spiking tests recorded no appreciable artificial isotope fractionation. We estimate that the best currently attainable long-term reproducibility of stable 51 V/ 50 V isotope measurements in complex matrices is 0. 15 ‰, which is in the same order as the reproducibility achievable with standard solutions. Finally, a large range of ∼ 1. 2 ‰ in stable V isotopic composition was documented, with ∼ 0. 5 ‰ of that variation in high temperature <b>igneous</b> <b>materials</b> alone. The range and resolving power of V stable isotopes, with respect to <b>igneous</b> <b>material,</b> compared favourably with the magnitude of fractionation reported for other non-traditional stable isotope systems, which bodes well for the utility of this new system. © 2011 The Authors.

50|$|One key {{question}} {{about the nature of}} Tharsis has been whether the bulge is mainly the product of active crustal uplifting from buoyancy provided by the underlying mantle plume or whether it is merely a large, static mass of <b>igneous</b> <b>material</b> supported by the underlying lithosphere.

This created rotational seismic wrench systems across the basin profile. These wrench systems allowed for intrusions of continental igneous deposits: sills and dikes, along with pegmatites from metasomatized country rock.
