500|$|Straczynski {{surprised}} many when he publicly revealed: [...] "There's a {{lot that}} I don't agree with, and I made this very clear to everybody within shouting distance at Marvel, especially Joe Quesada... {{there was a point}} where I made the decision, and told Joe, that I was going to take my name off the last two issues of the OMD arc. Eventually, Joe talked me out of that decision because {{at the end of the}} day, I don't want to sabotage Joe or Marvel, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of respect for both of those." [...] Quesada explained this disagreement with Straczynski, stating that their rift was primarily over the [...] "methodology" [...] of how to erase Peter and Mary Jane's marriage, but Straczynski was on board with the editorial mandate of undoing the Parkers' marriage.|$|E

2500|$|Gower {{continued}} his long-running feud against Tommy Rich in GASW, helped by manager Dave Prazak, {{where the two}} had several wild brawls. Prazak later claimed that during one of their encounters, in which Tommy Rich put Prazak in a piledriver, [...] "both he and Steve Lawler were roaring drunk for that match". They would eventually meet in a “lights out” match at Douglasville, Georgia with the loser being forced to retire. Gower himself later said the greatest matches he ever had were against Rich calling them [...] "some of the bloodiest, they {{were some of the}} hardest, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of respect Rich to this day".|$|E

2500|$|When {{discussion}} regarding {{her second}} album began, Duff {{said she wanted}} to work with the same team of producers and songwriters with whom she worked on Metamorphosis. [...] " [...] made me feel so comfortable and so secure with myself. I loved working with them. I have a great relationship with them. I talk to them ... They {{knew what was going on}} in my life, what I was going through ... and how I feel inside", Duff said. For songs she did not co-write, Duff discussed her experiences and feelings with the writers and ask them to write songs about them. Members of the creative team behind Metamorphosis who returned for Hilary Duff include Charlie Midnight, John Shanks and Kara DioGuardi (who collaborated on the commercially released singles), Andre Recke, Marc Swersky and Duff's sister Haylie. Hilary said, [...] "I do have a lot to say, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> going on inside that sometimes is buried and hidden because I'm working so hard, and I don't have time to think about it. But if we sit down and we talk about it and I tell her how I feel and she writes, it'll be good." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following her divorce, Jackson {{decided to}} record an uptempo, optimistic album rather than songs about sadness or anger. Producer Jimmy Jam said, [...] "You {{go through all}} these {{emotions}} and then {{you come out of}} it {{on the other side and}} say, [...] "I'm going to be okay <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of things to be thankful for,' and that was the overriding feeling in her life when we were making this album." [...] Its concept focuses largely on the demise of her marriage to René Elizondo, Jr. and subsequent embrace of the single life, experiencing dating for the first time. It also contains themes of sensuality, deceit, and betrayal. Jackson said, [...] "It’s a different thing for me. Growing up, I never dated. I’m doing that now, experiencing that whole life." [...] Its upbeat tempo intended to reflect Jackson's self-esteem, described as [...] "a work in progress." [...] Jam commented, [...] "She doesn't see herself the way other people see her. You know...gorgeous and sexy and all that. That isn't the kind of person she is. Although she is closer to feeling like that person now than she was 15 years ago. Or even three of four years ago." [...] Jackson commented, [...] "I look back at pictures of myself from four years ago and I see the unhappiness in my eyes. But I'm in the greatest space now... I believe we have choices and paths, and it's about choosing the right path, the promising path." [...] While recording, Jackson listened to artists such as St. Germain, Buena Vista Social Club, Thievery Corporation, Basement Jaxx, Outkast and Papa Roach.|$|E

It was awful luck my coming out in the Naval Brigade here; it was just a fluke. The man who was going was chucked off a horse and broke his arm the day before the brigade sailed from Suakim, and I was sent up in his place. Well, what is the last news, Clinton?
