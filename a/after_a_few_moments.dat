25|$|Visitations {{from members}} of other colonies occur {{frequently}} in P. alternata. A few known reasons for visitations can include becoming a new, often non-related helper, sharing of food, stealing eggs or abdominal substance, and feeding on drops of fluid on patches. When there are already a lot of female residents, the reaction of rejection increases. P. alternata females utilize different nest defense tactics against intruders such as Liostenogaster flavolineata. If the wasps suddenly land, the nest residents may leave and return <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> and fight who ever remains. Although some Steronigastrinae wasps partake in antennal combat, P. alternata rarely use this fighting method and instead initiate falling fights. By nesting in clusters, P. alternata improves the collective defense against predation or social parasitism.|$|E
25|$|Lozada and {{her partner}} split up while chasing the suspect. She chased him to a nearby {{abandoned}} lot located {{at the intersection of}} Central Avenue and Chauncey Street and waited at the lot which was heavily weeded and was loaded with junk. When confronted by the suspect she pretended to be looking for a lost dog with the intention that the suspect would not suspect her real motives. The suspect then turned around to look for the dog and Lozada pulled out her service gun. As Lozada attempted to handcuff the suspect, he turned and took her gun. According to Jeter, Lozada pleaded for her life to no avail. The suspect then shot her twice in the face. The first time Jeter fired, the bullet passed through her cheek. He then walked a short distance only to return <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> to shoot her in the face, killing her. Lozada's body was found three hours later in the lot; she was the first female officer to be killed {{in the line of duty}} in New York City.|$|E

Zach tries to {{convince}} her to change her mind, saying that she is acting childish, but Kendall explains that he and Bianca betrayed her. Bianca receives word that Kendall will not be coming to her wedding and immediately rushes to Kendall's home to insist she attend. Kendall says that she will only come to the wedding as long as Bianca promises to leave for Paris soon afterward and take Reese and baby Gabrielle with her. Bianca reluctantly agrees. Later that night, Reese and Bianca have a wedding rehearsal. Kendall picks up a wine glass and makes a snarky toast to Reese and Bianca but particularly to Reese. Reese becomes upset; she grabs a bottle of wine, a glass, and walks off. Bianca follows her, but Reese wants to be alone. Zach later finds Reese and consoles her. He pulls her into a hug and then kisses her passionately; Reese kisses back. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments,</b> with Ryan having witnessed their kiss, unknown to them, they agree that the kiss never happened and that they already have people they are deeply in love with. Ryan later confronts Zach about the kiss, but Zach says it was nothing and nonchalantly walks away from Ryan.|$|E

The first part of the advance went well and they reached a small wood {{at the foot of the}} hill where they found some shelter but beyond the wood there was a wall with a small gap and then open ground. Some of the Dublins were pinned down in a ditch ahead and the Fusiliers were lining the wall to the left. Shortly after 9am Symons rode up to the wood being followed by an aide-de-camp holding up a red pennant, to find out why the attack had stalled. He ordered the men to proceed, rode through the wood and dismounted, then walked through the gap in the wall still being followed by his pennant. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> he returned and was helped to remount his horse.

2500|$|The {{main event}} match between the Mexican {{team and the}} Japanese La Fiebre Amarilla started out with the tecnico side showing a bit of unity as Stuka Jr. wore a mask that was a {{combination}} of his own and the mask style Rey Cometa had worn until September, 2012. Namajague also wore a mask created specifically for the occasion, featuring long, bright red hair attached to his mask. Okumura and Namajague sought to get an easy advantage by jumping their opponents before the bell, but based on the two teams previous history Stuka Jr. and Rey Cometa were prepared for it and took control of the match for the early parts of the match. After several minutes of being on the defensive La Fievre Amarilla double teamed their way into control of the match and won the first fall of the match. The rudo duo continued to dominate throughout most of the second fall, but this time the Mexican team was able to overcome this and even the match with one fall to each team. Initially the crowd was quiet for the match, {{but by the end of}} the second fall the Mexico City fans were solidly cheering [...] "Mexico" [...] to support the home team. At one point a mistake between Stuka Jr. and Rey Cometa saw the team almost fight each other, each thinking the other one intentionally knocked them down. <b>After</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>moments</b> cooler heads prevailed and Stuka Jr. and Rey Cometa turned their attention back towards their Japanese rivals for the third and final fall.

This left Namajague and Rey Cometa in the ring, with the next elimination deciding which side lost the match. After several moments of high flying, fast paced wrestling Rey Cometa was able to execute a 450 degree splash off the top rope to Namajague for the final elimination.
