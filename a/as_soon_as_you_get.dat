They are needed on the Polish border because in these areas Hebrews alone perform trade. <b>As</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> away from the frontier, the Jews become a disadvantage, they form cliques, they deal in {{contraband}} and get up to all manner of rascally tricks which are detrimental to Christian burghers and merchants. I have never persecuted anyone from {{this or any other}} sect; I think, however, it would be prudent to pay attention, so that their numbers do not increase.|$|E

2500|$|Huhne {{was an avid}} {{supporter}} of Professor David Nutt after he was dismissed by Home Secretary Alan Johnson {{as chairman of the}} Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) in November 2009. Nutt had criticised the government's decision to reclassify cannabis as a Class B drug rather than keeping it as a class C. Huhne said the decision to sack Nutt was [...] "disgraceful" [...] and commented: [...] "what is the point of having independent scientific advice if <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>get</b> some advice that you don't like, you sack the person who has given it to you?".

Cannabis had been re-classified as a class C drug in 2004 by then Home Secretary David Blunkett, only for Jacqui Smith to reverse the ruling in 2008, a decision taken despite official advisers recommending against it.|$|E
