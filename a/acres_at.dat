5|$|In 1869, Waller {{purchased}} 330 {{acres of}} land along Fishing Creek from the Bloomsburg Iron Company and for $3000 and later sold it for $19,037. He sold some land in Mount Pleasant Township {{for a place to}} house poor people. He also made a number of a number of purchases of land {{near the end of his}} life, including 93 <b>acres</b> <b>at</b> the confluence of Fishing Creek and Raven Creek in 1890 and 22.5 acres along the Susquehanna River in Scott Township and Bloomsburg in May 1893.|$|E
5|$|Shiloh's {{importance}} as a Civil War battle, {{coupled with the}} lack of widespread agricultural or industrial development in the battle area after the war, led to its development {{as one of the first}} five battlefields restored by the federal government in the 1890s. Government involvement eventually proved insufficient to preserve the land on which the battle took place. (The federal government had saved just over 2,000 <b>acres</b> <b>at</b> Shiloh by 1897, and consolidated those gains by adding another 1,700 acres by 1954.) Preservation eventually slowed. Since 1954, only 300 additional acres of the saved land had been preserved. Private preservation organizations stepped in to fill the void. The Civil War Trust became the primary agent of these efforts, preserving 1,158 <b>acres</b> <b>at</b> Shiloh since its inception. The land preserved by the Trust at Shiloh included tracts over which Confederate divisions passed as they fought Grant's men on the battle's first day and their retreat during the Union counteroffensive on day two. A 2012 campaign focused in particular on a section of land which was part of the Confederate right flank on day one and on several tracts which were part of the Battle of Fallen Timbers.|$|E
50|$|The Crown {{initially}} {{bought two}} blocks of land: 279000 <b>acre</b> <b>at</b> Waipukurau, and 265000 <b>acre</b> <b>at</b> Ahuriri. By 1856, 30 sheep stations existed in Hawke's Bay, located mainly {{on those two}} blocks of land. Donald McLean organised further land purchases.|$|R

5|$|Some {{preservation}} successes {{have emerged}} in recent years. Two proposals to open a casino at Gettysburg were defeated in 2006 and most recently in 2011, when public pressure forced the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board to reject the proposed gambling hub {{at the intersection of}} Routes 15 and 30, near East Cavalry Field. The Civil War Trust also successfully purchased and transferred 95 <b>acres</b> <b>at</b> the former site of the Gettysburg Country Club to the control of the U.S. Department of the Interior in 2011.|$|E
5|$|The remains visible {{today are}} those of the stone bath house and mansio, built in {{approximately}} 130CE after Letocetum ceased to have a military function and became a civilian settlement. The settlement reached its peak during the 2nd and 3rd centuries and at this time occupied 8.1–12 hectares (20–30 <b>acres).</b> <b>At</b> the end of the 3rd century, the town relocated within high defensive walls astride Watling Street. After the Romans left early in the 5th century the settlement went into decline. The modern village of Wall emerged in the land once occupied by Letocetum.|$|E
5|$|As {{the glaciers}} of the Wisconsin {{glaciation}} began to recede from the Hudson Valley area, a glacial lake {{known today as}} Lake Albany extended across the mid and upper Hudson Valley and a large delta formed west of Albany where the predecessor of the Mohawk River flowed into the lake. Along the shoreline of the lake, lacustrine sands were deposited between the present-day cities of Hudson and Glens Falls; this became the Hudson Valley sandplain. Relieved from {{the weight of the}} glacier, the land began to rebound, and the lake receded by draining into the Hudson River. The deposits of sand in the delta area were gradually sculpted by wind into sand dunes. Plants later colonized the land and stabilized the dunes. The Pine Bush originally occupied , or 60,000 <b>acres,</b> <b>at</b> which point it was the largest inland pine barrens in North America.|$|E

25|$|After {{just two}} days of {{hearings}} Wakefield offered to pay £800 compensation to local Maori who had received no payment from Te Rauparaha and Te Rangihaeata in 1839. The money was paid and distributed at a final court session on 24 August and a deed of conveyance signed by the main chiefs of each district.

5000|$|In {{the early}} 17th century plans {{were made to}} drain and enclose much of Sedgemoor. Further {{reclamation}} {{was carried out in}} stages between about 1620 and 1740, with the [...] "new Cutts" [...] (or Decoy Rhyne) being built about 1660. The rivers Sheppey and Hartlake were canalised into the River James Wear and Division Rhyne sometime in the late 1730s. In 1795, John Billingsley advocated enclosure and the digging of rhynes (a local name for drainage channels, pronounced [...] "reens" [...] in the east and rhyne to the west) between plots, and wrote in his Agriculture of the County of Somerset that 4400 acre had been enclosed in the last 20 years in Wedmore and Meare, 350 <b>acre</b> <b>at</b> Nyland, 900 <b>acre</b> <b>at</b> Blackford, 2000 <b>acre</b> <b>at</b> Mark, 100 <b>acre</b> in Shapwick, and 1700 <b>acre</b> <b>at</b> Westhay.|$|R
