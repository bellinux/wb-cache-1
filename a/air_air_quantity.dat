It is difficult to adjust the air-coal parameter of each combustor to a reasonable value according to the static value for no certain relationship between the static value and the <b>air</b> speed is available to calculate the <b>air</b> speed and <b>air</b> <b>quantity.</b> The on-line monitoring system of boiler air-powder computer for real-time monitoring is adopted to keep the boiler {{in a state of}} balanced and steady combustion. The steady and accurate monitoring system and the automatic input rate of boiler (100 %), which could detect the load distribution, pipe blockage, powder interruption and spontaneous combustion accurately, shows considerable value in energy conservation and great practical value in regard to combustion adjustment and reasonable distribution of <b>air</b> and powder. System Overview It is well known that the combustion condition and efficiency of boiler is directly influenced by the primary and secondary <b>air</b> speed, <b>air</b> <b>quantity,</b> coal-powder flow and air-powder ratio of each combustor. During the operation of boiler, the following conditions are frequent: a high content of combustibles in fly ash, coking in the hearth, burnout of combustor and instable combustion. I...|$|R

There are many advantages of using such a system when compared to other methods. It has been shown that for headings longer than 30 m, auxiliary fans are the only practicable means of delivering the required <b>air</b> <b>quantities.</b> Besides <b>air</b> <b>quantities,</b> <b>air</b> quality is another critical issue for evaluating the ventilation efficiency in underground mines. Forcing and exhausting ducts used in the push-pull system are closely associated with the ventilation efficiency. This paper focuses on the efficiency evaluation for a push-pull ventilation system by using two methods, the dead zone and the mean age of <b>air.</b> By using the CFD technology, the <b>air</b> velocity and <b>air</b> quality are calculated and compared in four different cases. The results of evaluation will be identical by using these two methods. It is concluded that in the push-pull ventilation system, the position of the forcing duct plays a major role on the ventilation efficiency. Also, when the forcing duct position is determined, there must be a particular position of the exhausting duct to provide best ventilation efficiency...|$|R

This work does not only study the effect of mine ventilation network topology changes on the power consumed but also sustaining the <b>air</b> <b>quantity</b> in the fixed quantity branch unchanged regardless the location {{and the size of}} failure.

It helps operators pinpoint vehicles that are high DPM contributors. In addition, it allows the user to make what if scenarios by varying the input parameters to achieve the most efficient and practical ventilation system. The AQE is a stand-alone software program that does not require any type of spreadsheet software. Engine data must be known or estimated with some accuracy and assumptions must be made in order to limit the variability of the program output.
