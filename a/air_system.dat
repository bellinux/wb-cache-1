5|$|The pulley {{system was}} {{eventually}} deemed unsafe due to instances of sagging and delayed reaction. As a result, it was replaced on 36engines by a safer compressed <b>air</b> <b>system</b> between 1930 and 1937. This system had seen previous successful {{use on the}} LBSCR. Because the air compressor required extra space for installation, these conversions were confined to the long-framed members of the class.|$|E

5|$|JAL was {{established}} in 1951 and became the national airline of Japan in 1953. After over three decades of service and expansion, the airline was fully privatised in 1987. In 2002, the airline merged with Japan <b>Air</b> <b>System,</b> Japan's third-largest airline and became the sixth largest airline {{in the world by}} passengers carried. Japan Airlines is currently an official sponsor of Japan Football Association, Japan national football team, Shimizu S-Pulse and Consadole Sapporo. All Nippon Airways, the largest airline in Japan, is JAL's main competitor.|$|E

5|$|Japan began {{considering}} airline deregulation in {{the late}} 1970s, with the government announcing the abandoning of the 45/47 system in 1985. In 1987 Japan Airlines was completely privatised, {{and the other two}} airlines in Japan, All Nippon Airways (ANA) and Japan <b>Air</b> <b>System</b> (JAS), were permitted to compete with JAL on domestic and international routes. Increased competition resulted in changes to the airline's corporate structure, and it was reorganised into three divisions: international passenger service, domestic passenger service, and cargo (including mail) service.|$|E
5|$|On 16 November 2010, an F-22 from Elmendorf Air Force Base crashed, {{killing the}} pilot, Captain Jeffrey Haney. F-22s were {{restricted}} to flying below 25,000 feet, then grounded during the investigation. The crash {{was attributed to}} a bleed <b>air</b> <b>system</b> malfunction after an engine overheat condition was detected, shutting down the Environmental Control System (ECS) and OBOGS. The accident review board ruled Haney was to blame, as he did not react properly and did not engage the emergency oxygen system. Haney's widow sued Lockheed Martin, claiming equipment defects. She later reached a settlement. After the ruling, the engagement handle of the emergency oxygen system was redesigned; the system should engage automatically if OBOGS shuts down due to engine failure. On 11 February 2013, the DoD's Inspector General released a report stating that the USAF had erred in blaming Haney, and that facts did not sufficiently support conclusions; the USAF stated that it stood by the ruling.|$|E
25|$|The three-level <b>air</b> <b>system</b> was a {{significant}} improvement, but better results were required. Use of CFD models offered a new insight of <b>air</b> <b>system</b> workings. The first {{to develop a new}} <b>air</b> <b>system</b> was Kvaerner (Tampella) with their 1990 multilevel secondary air in Kemi, Finland, which was later adapted to a string of large recovery boilers. Kvaerner also patented the four level <b>air</b> <b>system,</b> where additional air level is added above the tertiary air level. This enables significant NOx reduction.|$|E

25|$|To achieve solid {{operation}} and low emissions the recovery boiler <b>air</b> <b>system</b> {{needs to be}} properly designed. <b>Air</b> <b>system</b> development continues and has been continuing as long as recovery boilers have existed. As soon as the target set for the <b>air</b> <b>system</b> has been met new targets are given. Currently the new air systems have achieved low NOx, but are still working on lowering fouling. Table 1 visualizes the development of air systems.|$|E
25|$|The second {{generation}} <b>air</b> <b>system</b> targeted high reduction. In 1954 CE moved their secondary air from about 1 m below the liquor guns to about 2 m above them. The air ratios and temperatures remained the same, but to increase mixing 50m/s secondary air velocities were used. CE changed their frontwall/backwall secondary to tangential firing at that time. In tangential <b>air</b> <b>system</b> the air nozzles {{are in the}} furnace corners. The preferred method {{is to create a}} swirl of almost the total furnace width. In large units the swirl caused left and right imbalances. This kind of <b>air</b> <b>system</b> with increased dry solids managed to increase lower furnace temperatures and achieve reasonable reduction. B had already adopted the three-level air feeding by then.|$|E

It is concluded that quiet <b>air</b> <b>systems</b> are necessary for obtaining community approval, and is recommended that extremely high priority be assigned {{to the development of}} quiet aircraft for future short haul <b>air</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

40|$|Compressed <b>air</b> <b>systems</b> {{are among}} the major {{consumers}} of electrical energy in industry. As the importance of energy-efficiency grows in general, so does the need for valid and reliable metrics for discussing efficiency. Today, energy flow diagrams are a common tool to illustrate energy efficiency in compressed <b>air</b> <b>systems.</b> They are however subject to various shortcomings which are mainly related to their lack of transparency and reproducibility. Therefore, a novel approach {{for the assessment of}} efficiency is presented which is based on the exergy concept. This approach allows for a transparent calculation of flow diagrams for compressed <b>air</b> <b>systems,</b> including the possibility to illustrate the effects of a heat recovery system. The concept is illustrated at the example of an industrial set-up starting at the compressor inlet and ending at the application. The resulting diagram allows a more transparent and objective view on efficiency evaluations and thus contributes {{to a better understanding of}} energy-efficiency in compressed <b>air</b> <b>systems</b> and related applications...|$|R

40|$|Compressed <b>air</b> <b>systems</b> {{are widely}} used in {{industry}} and craft for diverse purposes. Although this special energy form {{has a lot of}} technical advantages, it has {{to be taken into account}} that the energy comsumpiton of compressed <b>air</b> <b>systems</b> is considerably high. In Germany, these systems consume as much electricity as the Deutsche Bahn (German railways) for traction or as 1. 3 nuclear power plants. Nevertheless, according to an EU study published in 2001 (Radgen, 2001), approx, one third of this energy could be saved profitably. The "efficient compressed air" campaign addresses sthes huge saving potentials by porviding information about energy and cost efficient compressed <b>air</b> <b>systems</b> for all industrial users, mostly via interne, expert press artivles, seminars, conferences, and networks. The results show that the information and the instruments offerde by the campaigne are appreciated by the target groups. Above this, companies are invited to have their compressed <b>air</b> <b>systems</b> (the whole range from the compressor to the end use device) analyzed by compressed air experts, in order to detect weak-points and subsequently to show solutions for improvement of both the compressed air quality and the energy efficiency. Due to public and private funding, this analysis can be provided free of charge for about 100 companies until the end of 2002. The results will be worked out as branch-spedifid case studies which wil be distributed among the industrial users. Further instruments of the campaign are a benschmarking which compares compressed <b>air</b> <b>systems</b> of different companies, a competition for the best compressed <b>air</b> <b>systems</b> supply and a demonstration plant...|$|R
