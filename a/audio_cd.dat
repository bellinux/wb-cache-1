The use of retrospective data provided self reported perceived satisfaction measures and total score representing objective performance in an online course. Data represented employees of a large multinational, publicly traded healthcare company (N = 2401) during the 2012 calendar year. The independent variables were: (a) learner perceived satisfaction with the use of graphics, (b) learner perceived satisfaction with the use of <b>audio,</b> (<b>c)</b> learner perceived satisfaction with the use of narration properly synchronized with text animation, (d) learner perceived satisfaction with the use of video, and (e) reason for enrolling in the online course. The dependent variable was leamer 2 ̆ 7 s objective performance score. Correlations and hierarchical logistic regression were performed on the data. Major findings include (a) a low relation between learners 2 ̆ 7 perceived satisfaction with the use of graphics and objective performance, (b) a relation between combined learners 2 ̆ 7 perceived satisfaction with the use of audio, learners 2 ̆ 7 perceived satisfaction with the use of narration properly synchronized with text animation, and learners 2 ̆ 7 perceived satisfaction with the use of video and learners 2 ̆ 7 objective performance (r 2 =. 001,p 3 ̆c. 05), and (c) reason for enrolling in the online course did not predict learners 2 ̆ 7 objective performance.

5|$|As {{with nearly}} every Dragon Quest game, Koichi Sugiyama {{composed}} the musical score. As {{was done for}} Dragon Quest VI, the original sound version was bundled with the symphonic suite in a two-disc set called Dragon Quest VII: Eden no Senshitachi Symphonic Suite + OST. The entire first disc and the opening track of the second disc consists of the symphonic suite, {{while the rest of}} the second disc is the original sound version. The Symphonic Suite was released alone on Super <b>Audio</b> <b>CD</b> later that year, and re-released in 2009. A disc titled Dragon Quest VII: Eden no Senshitachi on Piano was also released, and contained 27 piano-arranged tracks. The Symphonic Suite was later re-recorded in 2006 along with the rest of the music from the series. An original soundtrack for the 3DS remake was released on March 19, 2014, and features the original recordings by the Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra from the remake.|$|E
