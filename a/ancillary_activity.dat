30|$|As {{teachers}} frame conjecturing {{tasks as}} primarily about {{the resources that}} students use, {{we see that the}} operations that students use to make conjectures and the conjectures that students arrive at could be underspecified and undervalued in classrooms. As a result, ‘making conjectures’ could be seen as an <b>ancillary</b> <b>activity.</b> One way to increase the specificity and value of students’ work on conjecturing tasks would be to increase and broaden the role that conjecturing plays in complying with the didactical contract in geometry. This might begin with policy changes, such as the inclusion of Standards for Mathematical Practice in the Common Core State Standards for mathematics. Further, conjecturing, including the specific operations that students engage in and the conjectures that they produce, would need to appear prominently in artifacts that shape teachers’ vision of the curriculum, including textbooks and local and national assessments. This study speaks to the interplay between what students know and are able to do mathematically in classrooms and the impact that teachers’ perceptions of students’ work have on the mathematical opportunities that students have in classrooms.|$|E
40|$|Six {{years of}} quasi-meridional {{crossings}} of the Antarctic Ocean from Antarctica to southern Africa between 4 °W and 16 °E longitude are analyzed, {{with emphasis on}} temperature and salinity distributions. Data are sparse, but (particularly in the south-ern part of the sections) adequate to show significant variations in the latitude/depth distributions and T-S characteristics of the principal water masses. In particular, the cross-sectional area occupied by Warm Deep Water (Weddell Deep Water) dropped by about one third in 1968. Positions of major features associated with the Antarctic Divergence varied by up to 5 degrees of latitude. The surface temperature gradient often observed at the Antarctic Divergence {{appears to be the}} surface expression of a shallow (possibly seasonal) thermocline which sometimes slopes upward to intersect the sea surface.

In this new context, the translator acts on the receptor system as such, but also as an intellectual and activist.

40|$|Inverter driven, inertia-less {{interface}} {{of a large}} photovoltaic (PV) source {{with power}} grid raises challenging penetration issues such as bus voltage fluctuation, active power variation, reactive power flow and poor system dynamics. Extensive efforts are underway to overcome these issues, which tend to put a limit on the maximum PV power injection capability for a given local area electric power system. This paper proposes a new control scheme that enables a centralized PV-grid system to damp out the low frequency power swings on the local area network as an <b>ancillary</b> <b>activity</b> apart from its regular function. The proposed scheme enhances the power system stability without incorporating any additional devices or systems (e. g., PSS). The analytical basis of the control law used in this scheme {{is derived from the}} structure preserving energy function (SPEF) model. A notable feature of the scheme that makes it highly feasible is that it requires only locally measurable signals. Further, it does not affect the MPPT control of the PV system in any manner. All these features make it highly relevant and suitable for smart grid applications. Relevant simulation results as well as key experimental results for a laboratory level hardware model are included...|$|E
40|$|To date, the radial {{velocity}} (RV) method {{has been one}} of the most productive techniques for detecting and confirming extrasolar planetary candidates. Unfortunately, stellar activity can induce RV variations which can drown out or even mimic planetary signals - and it is notoriously difficult to model and thus mitigate the effects of these activity-induced nuisance signals. This is expected to be a major obstacle to using next-generation spectrographs to detect lower mass planets, planets with longer periods, and planets around more active stars. Enter Gaussian processes (GPs) which, we note, have a number of attractive features that make them very well suited to disentangling stellar activity signals from planetary signals. We present here a GP framework we developed to model RV time series jointly with <b>ancillary</b> <b>activity</b> indicators (e. g. bisector velocity spans, line widths, chromospheric activity indices), allowing the activity component of RV time series to be constrained and disentangled from e. g. planetary components.

40|$|The {{interest}} in telecommuting {{stems from the}} potential benefits in alleviating traffic congestion, decreasing vehicle miles traveled (VMT), and improving air quality by reducing the necessity for travel between home and the workplace. Despite the potential economic, environmental, and social benefits, telecommuting has not been widely adopted, {{and there is little}} consensus on the actual impacts of telecommuting. One of the major hurdles is lack of a sound instrument to quantify the impacts of telecommuting on individuals’ travel behavior. As a result, the telecommuting phenomenon has not received proper attention in most transportation planning and investment decisions, if not completely ignored. ^ This dissertation addresses the knowledge gap in telecommuting studies by examining several factors. First, it proposes a comprehensive outline to reveal and represent the complexity in telecommuting patterns. There are various types of telecommuting engagement, with different impacts on travel outcomes. It is necessary to identify and distinguish between those people for whom telecommuting involves a substitution of work travel and those for whom telecommuting is an <b>ancillary</b> <b>activity.</b> Secondly, it enhances the current modeling framework by supplementing the choice/frequency approach with daily telework dimensions, since the traditional approach fails to recognize the randomness of telecommuting engagement in a daily context. ^ A multi-stage modeling structure is developed, which incorporates choice, frequency, engagement, and commute, as the fundamental dimensions of telecommuting activity. One pioneering perspective of this methodology is that it identifies non-regular telecommuters, who represent a significant share of daily telecommuters. Lastly, advanced statistical modeling techniques are employed to measure the actual impacts of each telecommuting arrangement on travelers’ daily activity-travel behavior, focusing on time-use analysis and work trip departure times. This research provides a systematic and sound instrument that advances the understanding of the benefits and potentials of telecommuting and impacts on travel outcomes. It is expected to facilitate policy and decision makers with higher accuracy and contribute to the better design and analysis of transportation investment decisions. ...|$|E
40|$|While the {{cultural}} policy adopted by Ghana on her attainment of political independence aims {{to offer the}} Ghanaian people opportunities to revive, preserve, and develop their indigenous culture, not much {{has been done in}} terms of documenting the Ghanaian cultural arts for both cultural record and educational purposes. This is because most of the experts of indigenous Ghanaian cultural matters are illiterates. These cultural experts depend mainly on an oral tradition for transmitting information about their culture. Communal beliefs and values, and ideas about cultural behaviours and actions, cultural symbols and images are passed on to the younger generations through stories, proverbs, and folk songs, among others. The people of Ghana have a characteristic of thinking about the world in which they live in symbolic terms. Thus, they use a wide range of symbol systems in accordance with various aspects of their social and cultural life, including the practice of their arts. Indeed, Ghanaian artistic expression is mostly symbolically oriented, serving to represent communal beliefs that are deeply rooted in historical, philosophical, social, religious, economic, and political values which form the basis of all major areas of Ghanaian cultural knowledge that gave birth to their arts. The national call for cultural revival, as well as a new urge for cultural identity among Ghanaians, today, has resulted in an urgent need for a research to document various aspects of the Ghanaian culture for use as educational and reference material to augment the oral tradition which is becoming increasingly inadequate in meeting the educational needs of the people. This study identifies and interprets the meanings of some symbolic key expressions as they are found in particular examples of the indigenous cultural arts of Ghana, namely: the visual, performing, and verbal art forms. The documentation includes the social and cultural significance (relevance) and aesthetic attributions of these symbolic artistic expressions and art forms to the people of Ghana. The documentation is done {{in a way that makes}} it applicable for arts education in Ghanaian schools. The Ghanaian cultural arts have been incorporated as an interdisciplinary study under a curriculum enrichment programme [...] a supporting content of the general education programme [...] rendering instruction in them to become an <b>ancillary</b> <b>activity.</b> This disparity between the goals of general education and arts education has resulted in the latter being relegated to the peripheries of the general school curriculum. The study, therefore proposes teaching and learning strategies for using the documented materials in the Primary, Junior Secondary, and Senior Secondary School levels of education in Ghana, using a discipline-based art education (D. B. A. E.) approach which integrates studio practice (art-making) with the historical, aesthetics, and critical domains of the arts. The resulting body of literature on the Ghanaian arts together with the suggested approaches to teaching and learning result in an arts education programme that is appropriate for Ghanaian schools. By studying the arts in relation to their own cultural context students will understand the arts they have been living with as part of their lifestyle. Their artistic skills and practices, imaginations, knowledge, and judgement will be grounded in their own cultural assumptions. In this way, students will understand and acquire the relevant literacy for effective participation in, and appreciation of their own culture...|$|E
