Minor amounts of ulvospinel, armalcolite, zirkelite, baddeleyite and an unidentified TiO 2 -rich phase were also found. Spinel grains are predominantly spinel-hercynite solid solutions, commonly with very minor chromite. The Fe/(Fe + Mg) ratio is generally lower than in spinel from Apollo 14 rocks. Chromites in non-mare rocks {{are similar to those}} from mare rocks. Ilmenite of mare origin is Mg-poor and Zr-rich compared to non-mare ilmenite; these elements may therefore be useful in determining the origin of ilmenite grains. Phase equilibria considerations suggest that spinel troctolite crystallized from a melt high in alumina; a likely candidate is the high-alumina basalt of Prinz et al. (1973) ...|$|R

The company bought land off Honeywell Lane, Oldham and erected Belgrave Mill which subsequently became known as 'Belgrave Number 1 Mill' as a further three mills were erected on the site in the early part of the 20th century. Yarn produced at the Belgrave Number 1 Mill was bleached or dyed in an on-site facility. Belgrave #1 was designed by the architects Potts, Pickup and Dixon a leading firm of mill architects in Lancashire. No expense was spared, including the fitting of a steam engine built by Woolstenhulmes & Rye.|$|E

Between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2011, plates were made of plastic, which made them slightly thicker than the older aluminium ones (requiring thicker plate holders). These plates were much less expensive. They had a transparent plastic layer {{on top of the}} layer with the writing, which was especially prone to breaking on impact during cold weather (such as being hit by another car's trailer hitch). This, in addition to the higher recycling costs of plastic compared to aluminum led to the cessation of plastic plates in favour of aluminum ones as of 1 January 2012, although with the same price as the plastic plates.|$|E

We describe an algorithm which computes a set of rational functions attached to a finite Coxeter group W. Conjecturally, these rational functions should be polynomials, and in the case where W is the Weyl group of a Chevalley group G defined over F_q, the values of our polynomials at q should give the number of F_q-rational points of Lusztig's special pieces in the unipotent variety of G.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of a multitype Bienaymé [...] Galton [...] Watson (BGW) process, the event that the daughter's type differs from the mother's type {{can be viewed as a}} mutation event. Assuming that mutations are rare, we study a situation where <b>all</b> <b>types</b> <b>except</b> one produce on average less than one offspring. We establish a neat asymptotic structure for the BGW process escaping extinction due to a sequence of mutations toward the supercritical type. Our asymptotic analysis is performed by letting mutation probabilities tend to 0. The limit process, conditional on escaping extinction, is another BGW process with an enriched set of types, allowing us to delineate a stem lineage of particles that leads toward the escape event. The stem lineage can be described by a simple Markov chain on the set of particle types. The total time to escape becomes a sum of a random number of independent, geometrically distributed times spent at intermediate types...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{competition in}} a telecommunications industry, where heterogeneous consumers have private {{information about their}} preferences for telephone service and firms are allowed to use nonlinear tariffs.

Un- der certain conditions, however, the resulting per-firm profit is independent of the access charge, and so the networks have no incentive to collude by choosing an access charge higher (or lower) than its cost. In this case, {{there is no need}} for regulatory intervention regarding access charges other than to provide a 'focal point' by recommending that the networks set access charges equal to the actual call-termination cost. This policy induces the efficient consumption of calls...|$|E

Method: Patient with unusual breast malignancies (<b>all</b> <b>types</b> <b>except</b> invasive ductal and lobular) treated under the care of a single surgeon were identified during the breast multi-disciplinary discussion from 2011 to 2015.

40|$|Background. Immunosuppressive {{therapy for}} antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated {{vasculitis}} {{has been associated}} with increased malignancy risk. Objectives. To quantify the cancer risk associated with contemporary cyclophosphamide-sparing protocols. Methods. Patients from the Norwegian Kidney Biopsy Registry between 1988 and 2012 who had biopsy-verified pauci-immune glomerulonephritis and positive antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) serology were included. Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated to compare the study cohort with the general population. Results. The study cohort included 419 patients. During 3010 person-years, cancer developed in 41 patients (9. 79 %); the expected number of cancer cases was 37. 5 (8. 95 %). The cohort had SIRs as follows: 1. 09, all cancer types (95 % CI, 0. 81 to 1. 49); 0. 96, <b>all</b> <b>types</b> <b>except</b> nonmelanoma skin cancer (95 % CI, 0. 69 to 1. 34); 3. 40, nonmelanoma skin cancer (95 % CI, 1. 62 to 7. 14); 3. 52, hematologic cancer (95 % CI, 1. 32 to 9. 37); 2. 12, posttransplant cancer (95 % CI, 1. 01 to 4. 44); and 1. 53, during the 1 – 5 -year follow-up after diagnosis (95 % CI, 1. 01 to 2. 32). Conclusions. Cancer risk did not increase significantly in this cohort with ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis.

40|$|Abstract: A {{suite of}} {{intrusive}} carbonate rocks, some containing xenoliths of nepheline syenite and Durness Group dolomite, {{has been discovered}} near the shore of Loch Urigill, Assynt, Scotland, c. 400 m outside the contact of the strongly alkaline Loch Borralan intrusion. Four varieties occur: porphyritic white sovite, phlogopite sovite, sovite breccia and foliated silicocarbonatite. Initially only the white sovite was found in situ, intrusive into Durness dolomites, but excavation has revealed <b>all</b> <b>types,</b> <b>except</b> the silicocarbonatite, in place. The rocks are largely Sr-rich calcite, often enclosing phlogopite poikilitically, together with fluorapatite rosettes. Fluorite, titanite, pyrrhotite, pyrite, chalcopyrite and ilmenite also occur. Diopside, potassic richterite and chondrodite {{are found in the}} silicocarbonatite and in the vicinity of xenoliths of silicate-rock and dolomite in the other carbonatite types. The carbonate rocks have the high Sr. Rb and Ba, rare earth element patterns, and carbon and oxygen isotopic ratios characteristic of carbonatites from a mantle source region and are chemically distinct from the Durness dolomites, even when the latter are sampled as xenoliths in nepheline syenite. Although the absence of Nb and the lack of significant fenitization of accompanying silicate rocks are somewhat uncharacteristic, we conclude that the rocks at Loch Urigill are true carbonatites related to the Loch Borralan complex.
