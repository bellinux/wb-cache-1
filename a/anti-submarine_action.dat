On 16 May, she sailed from Florida Island, in the Solomons, in a hunter-killer group with [...] and [...] on {{what was to become}} one of the most successful <b>anti-submarine</b> <b>actions</b> in the Pacific war. During this patrol from 19 to 31 May, the three-ship team sank six Japanese submarines ( [...] , , , , , and [...] ) in waters north of the Bismarck Archipelago.|$|R

In 1957, Admiral Cabanier intervened so that the Rubis (along with {{corvette}} Aconit, the only two Compagnon de la Libération naval warships of the French Navy), would not get disposed of. Accordingly, a sonar target use was assigned which resulted in drowning the boat indefinitely in the Mediterranean Sea. On June 1958, he was assigned as chef d'État-major de la Défense nationale (chef d'État-major de la Défense nationale) of the cabinet of général de Gaulle.|$|E

The convoy and the other escorts, including the PC-1264 continued on course with the USS Natchez remaining to deal with U-548. Later that night the convoy encountered Task Group 02.10, a Hunter-Killer Group, which passed down the port side of the convoy on its way assist the USS Natchez. Two of the destroyer escorts in this group participated {{in the destruction of}} U-548, one of the last <b>anti-submarine</b> <b>actions</b> of the war in the Atlantic.|$|R
5000|$|After {{shakedown}} off Bermuda, George sailed from Boston, Massachusetts on 11 January 1944 {{to escort}} a merchantman from Norfolk, Virginia to Nouméa, New Caledonia, where she arrived on 19 February. Until {{the spring of}} 1944, George escorted transports to the Admiralties, the New Hebrides, and the Solomons during consolidation operations in the Solomons.

50|$|Brough, under {{constant}} and intensive training {{throughout the war}} expended 4,050 rounds of 3 in 50 cal., 15,180 rounds of 40 mm, and 25,093 rounds of 20 mm - all for practice. During <b>anti-submarine</b> <b>actions,</b> 200 depth charges and 372 projectiles were fired. When Brough was commissioned her armament included torpedo tubes, eight 20mm guns, a twin 40 mm and three 3"/5O cal. guns. But as the pattern of warfare shifted from surface to air actions, repeated alterations resulted in {{the removal of the}} torpedoes, and the addition of another twin and a quad 40 mm, along with two more 20 mm.|$|R
50|$|In the Baltic Sea, after Tallinn's capture, surface {{ships were}} {{blockaded}} in Leningrad and Kronstadt by minefields, where they participated with the anti-aircraft {{defense of the}} city and bombarded German positions. One example of Soviet resourcefulness was the battleship Marat, an aging pre-World War I ship sunk at anchor in Kronstadt's harbor by German Stukas in 1941. For the rest of the war, the non-submerged part of the ship remained in use as a grounded battery. Submarines, although suffering great losses due to German and Finnish <b>anti-submarine</b> <b>actions,</b> had {{a major role in the}} war at sea by disrupting Axis navigation in the Baltic Sea.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In anti-submarine war {{systems of}} system (ASW-SOS), each {{operational}} node has a varie-ty of combat capabilities, which play different roles in <b>anti-submarine</b> <b>actions,</b> and these abilities {{have their own}} range. Therefore, after definition and description of ability of operational node, cal-culation of comprehensive ability index, and built of weighted voronoi diagram (WVD), the analy-sis approach of operational ability of ASW-SOS is formed. After generating various capabilities WVD, this paper analyzes impact of change brought by global dynamic deployment, and puts for-ward adaptive optimization solution. The simulation results show that, by using the technology of WVD, the ability of static distribution and dynamic change process can be demonstrated clearly and precisely, and this method has strong practicalit...|$|R
50|$|The Battle of the St. Lawrence {{involved}} {{marine and}} <b>anti-submarine</b> <b>actions</b> throughout the lower St. Lawrence River {{and the entire}} Gulf of Saint Lawrence, Strait of Belle Isle, Anticosti Island and Cabot Strait from May-October 1942, September 1943, and again in October-November 1944. During this time, German U-boats sank several merchant ships and four Canadian warships. There were several near shore actions involving the drop of German spies, or the attempted pick up of escaping prisoners of war. Despite the 23 ships lost, this battle marked a strategic victory for Canadian forces as ultimately they managed to disrupt U-boat activity, protect Canadian and Allied convoys, and intercept all attempted shore operations. This {{marked the first time}} that a foreign power had inflicted casualties in Canadian inland waters since the US incursions in the War of 1812.|$|R
500|$|During the attack, {{there were}} several delays between events and {{responses}} to them. Over two hours passed between the observation of M-14 in the boom net and Muirhead-Gould's first order for ships to commence <b>anti-submarine</b> <b>actions.</b> [...] It took another two hours to mobilise the auxiliary patrol boats, which did not leave their anchorage for a further hour. [...] Part of these delays was {{due to a lack}} of effective communications. [...] None of the auxiliary patrol craft in the harbour had radio communications, so all instructions and reports came from signal lights via the Port War Signal Station or Garden Island, or by physical communication via launches. [...] In Muirhead-Gould's preliminary report on the attack, he stated that the Port War Signal Station was not designed for the volume of communications traffic the attack caused. Telephone communications with Garden Island were unreliable during the early part of the attack, and then the first torpedo explosion disabled them completely.|$|R
5000|$|Novorossiysk was a {{conventionally}} powered heavy aircraft carrying cruiser or {{aircraft carrier}} that served the Soviet Navy, {{and later the}} Russian Navy, from 1982 to 1993. She was the third [...] vessel to be built. She was designed to engage in offensive actions as a guided missile cruiser mostly using her deck mounted missiles as well as support <b>anti-submarine</b> and surface <b>actions</b> with her embarked air group.|$|R
40|$|The British {{occupation}} of the Diego Suarez area in Madagascar {{did not lead to}} the capitulation of the whole of the Island which had been hoped for. It was found necessary, therefore, to plan operations against the harbours Majunga and Tamatave with the object of advancing from there on the capital Tananarive. Japanese defeats in the Pacific, however, had diminished the danger of an Axis amphibious attack on the Island considerably. The need for immediate action against Tamatave and Majunga was thus lessened and attempts were made instead to come to a modusvivendi with the French in Tananarive. No progress in that direction was made during the periodMay to August 1942. While policy matters were being discussed, three flights of light bombers arrived in Madagascarfrom South Africa. These aircraft were withdrawn from the Union coastal defence system forreconnaissance work on the island. It was originally intended to have them relieved by British aircraftafter a few weeks, but as {{only a few of the}} latter were available, the South Africans remained for months. Operationally the South African aircraft were under command of Colonel Melville, who received his instructions directly from the British officer in command of the Madagascan operations. Operations were launched the day after the arrival of the first aircraft. Most of the time was spent on routine sea patrols, a task considerably hampered by difficulties encountered with the engines ofthe Beaufort aircraft, which made sea-patrols an unpleasant undertaking. On at least four occasionsSouth African pilots were forced to make crashlandings due to engine failure and one aircraftwas damaged by anti-aircraft fire. No fatalities were suffered in action. The South African Air Force was involved in both highpoints of the period May to August 1942, namely the <b>anti-submarine</b> <b>actions</b> after the torpedoing of the Ramillies and the {{occupation of}} the Mayotte-group of the Comoro Islands. </p...|$|R
