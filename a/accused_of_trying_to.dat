5|$|Culverhouse was {{described}} as late as 1982 as a rare owner who was popular with players, coaches, and fans. He was commended for allowing his staff to handle football operations without interference, and for having the patience to allow John McKay {{to follow through with}} his building plan despite the franchise's 0–26 start. This changed after events surrounding the 1982 players' strike. A report issued by the National Football League Players Association {{prior to the start of}} negotiations revealed that the Buccaneers had the fifth-highest gross income of all NFL teams, while their average salary was only the 21st-highest. This directly contradicted statements made by Culverhouse in 1980, in which he told players that they were on one of the three highest-paid teams. The NFLPA figures showed that the Buccaneers were actually the third lowest-paying team, based on total salaries as a percentage of gross income. Culverhouse was then <b>accused</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> divide the players during the strike, when some of the team's assistant coaches contacted players to ask whether they would be willing to return to the team should training facilities be reopened.|$|E

25|$|After {{appearing}} {{in a series}} of box office flops during 2003–2006, Patel's career prospects began to improve in 2007. Her first release in that year was the ensemble comedy drama Honeymoon Travels Pvt. Ltd.. The low-budget film achieved moderate success at the box office. Patel played the role of Karan Khanna's talkative wife who tries to overcome her husband's gay leanings. Her comic timing in the film was well received. Later in 2007, she co-starred opposite Akshay Kumar in Priyadarshan's hit Bhool Bhulaiyaa as a rejected adopted girl who is <b>accused</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> disrupt the marriage of her childhood crush.|$|E

25|$|In {{its early}} years Israel sought to {{maintain}} a non-aligned position between the super-powers. However, in 1952, an antisemitic public trial was staged in Moscow in which a group of Jewish doctors were <b>accused</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> poison Stalin (the Doctors' plot), followed by a similar trial in Czechoslovakia (Slánský trial). This, {{and the failure of}} Israel {{to be included in the}} Bandung Conference (of non-aligned states), effectively ended Israel's pursuit of non-alignment. On 19 May 1950, Egypt announced that the Suez Canal was closed to Israeli ships and commerce. In 1952 a military coup in Egypt brought Abdel Nasser to power. The United States pursued close relations with the new Arab states, particularly the Nasser-led Egyptian Free Officers Movement and Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia. Israel's solution to diplomatic isolation was to establish good relations with newly independent states in Africa and with France, which was engaged in the Algerian War.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{launching}} of balloons has provoked North Korea to threaten activists by warning that it would shell the areas with balloon launches. In October 2014, the North Korean border guards' attempt to shoot {{down some of the}} balloons led to a firefight due to North Korean shots landing near a South Korean military base and a residential area. A North Korean spy was arrested in 2011 and <b>accused</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> assassinate balloon campaign activist Park Sang-hak. In 2014, a North Korean agent posing as a defector was arrested for reportedly attempting to assassinate Choi Jung-hoon, another activist involved in the balloon drops and the commander of the North Korean People's Liberation Front. Jin-Heon Jung points out that the DMZ has become more militarized in recent years. The balloons may contribute to a decay of the remaining cooperation between the Korean governments; activists have been blamed of eagerly trying to destroy any cooperation between the governments.|$|E
25|$|Hanson {{was widely}} <b>accused</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> take Australia {{back to the}} days of the White Australia Policy, {{particularly}} through reference to Arthur Calwell, one of the policy's strongest supporters. In her maiden address to the Australian Parliament following the 1996 election, Hanson said:I and most Australians want our immigration policy radically reviewed and that of multiculturalism abolished. I believe we are in danger of being swamped by Asians. Between 1984 and 1995, 40 per cent of all migrants coming into this country were of Asian origin. They have their own culture and religion, form ghettos and do not assimilate.Hanson's remarks generated wide interest in the media both nationally and internationally, but she herself did not retain her seat in Parliament at the 1998 election or subsequent 2001 and 2004 federal elections. Hanson also failed to win election in the 2003 and 2011 New South Wales state elections. In May 2007, Hanson, with her new Pauline's United Australia Party, continued her call for a freeze on immigration, arguing that African migrants carried disease into Australia.|$|E

25|$|Two {{important}} papyri {{date from}} the reign of Seti II. The first {{of these is the}} Tale of Two Brothers, a fabulous story of troubles within a family on the death of their father, which may have been intended in part as political satire on the situation of the two half brothers. The second is the records of the trial of Paneb. Neferhotep, one of the two chief workmen of the Deir el Medina necropolis, had been replaced by Paneb, his troublesome son-in-law. Many crimes were alleged by Neferhotep's brother—Amennakhte—against Paneb in a violently worded indictment preserved in papyrus now in the British Museum. If Amennakhte's testimony can be trusted, Paneb had allegedly stolen stone from the tomb of Seti II while still working on its completion—for the embellishment of his own tomb—besides purloining or damaging other property belonging to that monarch. Paneb was also <b>accused</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> kill Neferhotep, his adopted father-in-law, despite being educated by the latter and after the murder of Neferhotep by 'the enemy,' Paneb had reportedly bribed the Vizier Pra'emhab in order to usurp his father's office. Whatever the truth of these accusations, it is clear that Thebes was going through very troubled times. There are references elsewhere to a 'war' that had occurred during these years, but it is obscure to what this word alludes--perhaps to no more than internal disturbances and discontent. Neferhotep had complained of Paneb's attacks on himself to the vizier Amenmose, presumably a predecessor of Pra'emhab, whereupon Amenmose had punished Paneb. This trouble-maker had then brought a complaint before 'Mose' (i.e., 'Msy'), who then acted to remove Pra'emhab from his office. Evidently this 'Mose' must have been a person of the highest importance, perhaps the king Amenmesse himself or a senior ally of the king.|$|E

500|$|Many in {{the crowd}} {{disagreed}} with the decision and took exception to it being made by an umpire employed by the Englishmen. That Coulthard was a Victorian added to the emotions of the crowd, who thought along intercolonial lines. The Sydney Evening News propagated rumours that Coulthard had placed a large bet on an English victory, something that the umpire and Lord Harris later denied. Loud hooting came from the pavilion, especially the section where the gamblers, who had overwhelmingly backed a New South Wales victory, were situated. [...] It was reported that well-known gamblers were prominent in inciting {{the other members of}} the crowd, [...] amid loud chants of [...] "not out" [...] and [...] "Go back , Murdoch". Gregory was later <b>accused</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> fan the dispute and encourage the crowd to gain an advantage for his team.

500|$|In 1989, with Hughes under public attack, {{a battle}} raged {{in the letters}} pages of The Guardian and The Independent.

But I learned my lesson early. [...] If I tried too hard to tell them exactly how something happened, {{in the hope of}} correcting some fantasy, I was quite likely to be <b>accused</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> suppress Free Speech.

Where that leaves respect for the truth of her life (and of mine), or for her memory, or for the literary tradition, I do not know." [...] Hughes died in 1998.|$|E
500|$|In January 2017 the Hallmark Channel {{announced}} {{the release of}} a TV movie, Love on Ice, about the relationship between a female figure skater in a career slump and her new male coach. It was seen by some fans of Yuri on Ice as plagiarism due to plot similarities, and Hallmark was <b>accused</b> <b>of</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> [...] "straightwash" [...] the relationship between Yuri Katsuki and Victor Nikiforov. Fans of Yuri on Ice responded to Love on Ice by posting a Change.org petition demanding an explanation of the similarities between the two stories and hijacking Love on Ice IMDb page to contain the plot summary of Yuri on Ice. The similarity between the stories is apparently coincidental, since Love on Ice began filming in early November 2016 (about a month after Yuri on Ice began broadcasting). According to Hallmark, no one involved in the making of Love on Ice had heard of Yuri on Ice. Mitsurō Kubo posted on Twitter that she believed the similarities to be a coincidence, and the creator of the Change.org petition acknowledged that Love on Ice was not plagiarism.|$|E
