5|$|Residential {{development}} {{had been}} gradually spreading westward from Belgravia since the 1840s, but {{the area around}} the station site was mainly in horticultural use as market gardens when the new line was constructed. The planning of the line encouraged the local land owners, including Lord Kensington, to extend Cromwell Road westwards <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> Gloucester Road station, stimulated rapid residential development in the surrounding area.|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} the fire could not be {{determined}} with certainty. One possibility is that a fire smouldered in the furniture store Inden under the hotel, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> the elevator shaft in the morning provided an inflow of oxygen, causing the fire to spread. There is also a theory that the fire was set by burglars who tried to cover their tracks; however, {{there was no evidence}} of a burglary.|$|E

5|$|Buchanan County brought ASL to Grundy {{in order}} to revitalize a town {{that had been in}} a steady {{economic}} decline since the town's Flood of 1977. ASL has brought a positive economic impact on its home town, including spurring construction of rental homes <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> additional businesses in the area. ASL has become a success story for the concept of higher education as an economic development tool. The school has brought in $12 million per year to the local economy. ASL's economic success spurred the conception and implementation of the Appalachian College of Pharmacy (formerly University of Appalachia College of Pharmacy), which was founded in 2003 and opened its doors in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Fakih {{was made}} the Minister of Religious Affairs in the Wilopo Cabinet and sworn in on 3 April 1952, {{which led to}} him and his family moving to the capital at Jakarta. He began to work on {{reforming}} the ministry, including formalising its mission statement: to provide religious teachers, promote interfaith relations, and to establish the dates of religious holidays. He worked on internal structure, including formalising the ministry's leadership hierarchy <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> the provincial and regional branches. The ministry also continued its promotion of religious education and was tasked with handling the numerous Indonesian pilgrims who went on the hajj. The Wilopo Cabinet collapsed on 30 July 1953, following an immigration and land dispute in Medan. Fakih was replaced by Masjkur.|$|E

5|$|From 1800 to 1847, Banagher {{enjoyed a}} period of {{prosperity}} unequalled in its history. Corn growing had long {{been one of the}} chief agricultural activities of the district <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> the Grand Canal {{at the end of the}} 18th century gave easy access to Dublin and Limerick and brought cheap and efficient water transport to the district. Banagher became the outlet for the grain raised in a wide area round the town, and the Banagher corn market on Fridays was one of the largest of its kind in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, {{the celebration}} of 200 years since {{the arrival of the}} First Fleet was {{organised}} on a large scale, with many significant events taking place in all major cities. Over 2.5million people attended the event in Sydney. These included street parties, concerts, including performances on the steps and forecourt of the Sydney Opera House and at many other public venues, art and literary competitions, historic re-enactments, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> the Powerhouse Museum at its new location. A re-enactment of the arrival of the First Fleet took place in Sydney Harbour, with ships that had sailed from Portsmouth a year earlier taking part.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, {{the station}} had 27,004 entries, making the station among the system's least-used. This {{amounted}} to only 52 boardings per weekday in 2009, representing a 71.6 percent decrease from the station's 1990 ridership. In 2010, there were 29,644 recorded entries, and in 2011, there were 54,183 entries. Since {{the station was}} closed through 2012, there were no boardings, but after full-time service was restored to the station in 2013, there was a significantly higher ridership, with 213,601 recorded entries in 2013 and 630,644 entries in 2014. The increase in ridership at the station and the nearby Aqueduct–North Conduit Avenue station since 2010 {{has been attributed to}} the end of off-track betting at the racetrack in 2010, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> the casino in 2011.|$|E

5|$|Just as {{the concept}} of the First World came about as a result of World War II, so did the European Union. In 1951 the {{beginnings}} of the EU were founded with the creation of European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). From the beginning of its inception, countries in the EU were judged by many standards, including economic ones. This is where the relation between globalization, the EU, and First World countries arises. Especially during the 1990s when the EU focused on economic policies such as the creation and circulation of the Euro, the creation of the European Monetary Institute, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> the European Central Bank.|$|E
5|$|Located at the {{junction}} of two earlier tube railway schemes, the station was opened in 1906 by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP). The station entrances and below ground circulation were largely reconstructed for the introduction of escalators <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> Central line platforms in 1933, making the station the only interchange between the lines. Before 1994, Holborn was the northern terminus of the short and little-frequented Piccadilly line branch to Aldwych and two platforms originally used for this service are disused. One of the disused platforms {{has been used for}} location filming when a London Underground station platform is needed.|$|E
5|$|Other {{prominent}} artworks on {{the grounds}} include a Marc Chagall stained glass window memorializing the death of Dag Hammarskjöld, the Japanese Peace Bell which is rung on the vernal equinox <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> each General Assembly session, a Chinese ivory carving made in 1974 (before the ivory trade was largely banned in 1989), and a Venetian mosaic depicting Norman Rockwell's painting The Golden Rule. A full-size tapestry copy of Pablo Picasso's Guernica, by , {{on the wall of}} the United Nations building at the entrance to the Security Council room. In 1952, two Léger murals were installed in the General Assembly Hall. The works are meant to merely be decorative with no symbolism. One is said to resemble cartoon character Bugs Bunny and U.S. President Harry S. Truman dubbed the other work Scrambled Eggs.|$|E

5|$|The Daruvar Agreement (Croatian, Serbian: Daruvarski sporazum) was a {{document}} negotiated by Croatian and Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) local {{authorities in the}} United Nations Protected Area (UNPA) for the SAO Western Slavonia, also known as Sector West on 18 February 1993, during the Croatian War of Independence. The agreement provided {{for the improvement of}} water and electrical power supply, the return of refugees to their homes <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> transport routes spanning Sector West and connecting Croatian Army-controlled areas near towns of Nova Gradiška and Novska. It also provided a framework for the further improvement of living conditions of the population both in the Croatian- and RSK-controlled portions of Sector West. The agreement was named after Daruvar, the site of its signing.|$|E
5|$|The first streetcars {{appeared}} in 1889 and {{were instrumental in}} the creation of a relatively well-defined downtown and strong neighborhoods at the end of their lines. The advent of the automobile sounded the death knell for rail in Seattle. Tacoma–Seattle railway service ended in 1929 and the Everett–Seattle service came to an end in 1939, replaced by inexpensive automobiles running on the recently developed highway system. Rails on city streets were paved over or removed, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> the Seattle trolleybus system brought the end of streetcars in Seattle in 1941. This left an extensive network of privately owned buses (later public) as the only mass transit within the city and throughout the region.|$|E
5|$|While the {{district}} includes {{all of the}} cities and communities in its jurisdiction, some of these cities do not have stations on the BART system. This has caused tensions among property owners in cities like Livermore who pay BART taxes but must travel outside the city to receive BART service. In areas like Fremont, the majority of commuters do not commute in the direction that BART would take them (many Fremonters commute to San Jose, where there is currently no BART service). This would be alleviated with {{the completion of a}} BART-to-San Jose extension project <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> the Berryessa Station in San Jose.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s the Royal Mail built a mail {{conveyor}} {{at the northern}} end of the station, with significant aesthetic impact. This was out of use for many years following the transfer of Royal Mail's activities to the West of England Mail Centre at Filton <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> the short-lived Railnet Hub next to Bristol Parkway station in May 2000. It was finally dismantled in stages and removed between October and December 2014. In 1990/91, £2 million was spent by InterCity on a renovation of the main train shed and another £7 million on restoring some of the older areas of the station, including the refurbishment of the subway and construction of new retail outlets. The shorter of the two 1935 platform islands had been used only for parcels traffic since the 1960s but was temporarily brought back into passenger use during this work. It was fully restored for passenger use in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Other {{formations}} {{were also}} formed but were mostly eroded following uplift from the Laramide orogeny which started around 70million years ago (mya). This event created the Rocky Mountains {{far to the}} east and helped to close the sea that covered the area. A large part of western North America started to stretch itself into the nearby Basin and Range topography around 15mya. While not part of this region, the greater Bryce area was stretched into the High Plateaus by the same forces. Uplift of the Colorado Plateaus <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> the Gulf of California by 5mya changed the drainage of the Colorado River and its tributaries, including the Paria River, which is eroding headward in between two plateaus adjacent to the park. The uplift caused the formation of vertical joints which were later preferentially eroded to form the free-standing pinnacles called hoodoos, badlands, and monoliths we see today.|$|E
5|$|The East River Bridge is a {{multi-span}} {{bridge in}} Sheet Harbour, Nova Scotia that carries Trunk7 over the Northeast Arm of Sheet Harbour. It replaced a {{bridge of the}} same name that was built in 1956 and demolished in 2016. Construction began on the current bridge in September 2014 and was finished on 17December 2015, with a bridge walk commemorating the closing of the old East River Bridge <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> the new bridge. The old structure was a green arch bridge with a half-through, two-hinge type arch that was built in 1956, but was nearing the end of its lifespan leading to plans for construction of a new bridge funded by the federal and provincial governments. Nova Scotia had considered repairs to the old bridge in an effort to extend its lifespan, but ultimately elected to construct a new bridge.|$|E
50|$|The labia {{are part}} of the female genitalia; they are the major {{externally}} visible portions of the vulva. In humans, there are two pairs of labia: the labia majora (or the outer labia) are larger <b>and</b> fattier, while <b>the</b> labia minora are folds of skin between the outer labia. <b>The</b> labia surround <b>and</b> protect <b>the</b> clitoris <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>openings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vagina <b>and</b> <b>the</b> urethra.|$|R
60|$|She {{was partly}} roused {{by the various}} sounds in the house, but not startled--the light nights of summer always diminished her alarms; <b>and</b> she heard <b>the</b> clocks strike, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> bell ring for prayers, <b>the</b> doors open <b>and</b> shut, all mixed in with her hazy fancies.
