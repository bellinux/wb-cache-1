5|$|According to {{historian}} L. T. C. Rolt, {{the original}} installation was of machines for wire-braiding crinoline frames, and Charles simultaneously imported metal cutting machine tools to aid his friend Hiram Maxim who was developing a machine gun. This is <b>a</b> <b>moot</b> point: the Maxim gun was not developed {{for a further}} 20 years, and {{it is unlikely that}} Maxim was in England during the 1860s; however, the Gatling gun was patented in 1862. Rolt claimed that Charles Churchill & Co began trading in 1865 as importers of engineering tools and is thought to have imported the first examples of Morse tapered twist drills, self-centring drill chucks (manufactured by Cushman) and hand-held micrometers into the UK. According to Floud, he imported agricultural implements and other non-engineering items at this time. In its early years the company traded from 28 Wilson Street, Finsbury: sales catalogues were published certainly between 1876 and 1882 stating this address.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1949 Higginbotham entered Yale Law School. As he had in grade school, he worked, this time as a butcher, to help support himself while at Yale. He {{was a member of}} the moot court team and the Barrister's Union (a mock trial organization). Higginbotham {{advanced}} to the finals of the first year moot court competition. He argued before a panel that included Justice Clark of the Supreme Court of the United States, and renowned appellate advocate John W. Davis, who would later argue against Thurgood Marshall on behalf of the State of Kansas in Brown v. Board of Education. In 1951, Higginbotham competed on <b>a</b> <b>moot</b> court team with Richard N. Gardner, who would later serve as United States Ambassador to Spain and the United States Ambassador to Italy. Higginbotham's team argued against a team from Temple University Law School, which included his future law partner and judicial colleague, Clifford Scott Green.|$|E
5|$|The Allies {{initially}} {{adopted a}} strategy of blocking land and sea approaches to southern Greece. Thus, in August 480BC, after hearing of Xerxes' approach, a small Allied army led by Spartan King Leonidas I blocked the Pass of Thermopylae, while an Athenian-dominated navy sailed to the Straits of Artemisium. Famously, the massively outnumbered Greek army held Thermopylae for three days before being outflanked by the Persians, who used a little-known mountain path. Although much of the Greek army retreated, the rearguard, formed of the Spartan and Thespian contingents, was surrounded and annihilated. The simultaneous Battle of Artemisium, consisting {{of a series of}} naval encounters, was up to that point a stalemate; however, when news of Thermopylae reached them, the Greeks also retreated, since holding the straits was now <b>a</b> <b>moot</b> point.|$|E

40|$|<b>Mooting</b> is <b>a</b> {{common form}} of {{assessment}} in law schools. This paper examines the validity of using <b>mooting</b> as <b>a</b> form of assessment in any undergraduate tax program. The ji 2 ̆ 7 rst part of the paper examines the skills required by tax professionals and whether <b>mooting</b> is <b>a</b> valid way to learn those skills. It also examines the educational validity of <b>mooting</b> as <b>a</b> form of instruction in an undergraduate tax program. The {{second part of the}} paper looks at the practical implementation of <b>a</b> <b>mooting</b> program. Mooting can be used as part of a skills program or can equally easily be adapted for use as a stand alone form of assessment. It can be formal or informal. One model of <b>a</b> <b>mooting</b> program is examined {{in the light of the}} underlying theory, from the writing of the moot problem through to assessment and feedback. The paper concludes by looking at the resource implications of <b>a</b> <b>mooting</b> program for tax students and problems that may arise...|$|R

5|$|The next Scottish Parliament {{election}} {{is due to}} be held on Thursday 6 May 2021. Under the Scotland Act 1998, an ordinary general election to the Scottish Parliament would normally have been held on the first Thursday in May {{four years after the}} 2016 election, i.e. in May 2020. This would have clashed with the proposed date of the 2020 United Kingdom general election, but later became <b>a</b> <b>moot</b> point after the latter was brought forward to 2017. In November 2015, the Scottish Government published a Scottish Elections (Dates) Bill, which proposed to extend the term of the Parliament to five years. That Bill was passed by the Scottish Parliament on 25 February 2016 and received Royal Assent on 30 March 2016, setting the new date for the election as 6 May 2021, with subsequent elections every four years after that.|$|E
