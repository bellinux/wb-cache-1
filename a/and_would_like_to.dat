25|$|Newspaper reports {{mention that}} Chang dealt {{exclusively}} with young women. One of his methods {{was to have}} a waiter pass a note to pretty girls in his restaurants saying that he admired them <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> have a quiet dinner with them sometime. Many then went on to become his customers, and some his lovers. His easy manners, charisma and exotic appeal meant {{that he was able to}} build up a large female clientele that was close to a fan club. In order to distance himself from the actual transaction, the goods and money were exchanged over a high wall so that the parties were invisible to each other.|$|E
25|$|Reverse money {{laundering}} {{is a process}} that disguises a legitimate source of funds that are to be used for illegal purposes.

Unaccounted cash received via disguising financial transactions is not included in official financial reporting and could be used to evade taxes, hand in bribes and pay “under-the-table” salaries. For example, in an affidavit filed 24 March 2014 in United States District Court, Northern California, San Francisco Division, FBI special agent Emmanuel V.

Having no first round pick in the draft, the Tigers used their 18th pick to acquire a point guard that would strengthen their backcourt. On Draft Day, Powerade selected Jai Reyes of the Ateneo de Manila University as their 18th pick in the 2010 Draft. On the same day, Powerade acquired Air21's 6th pick, Sean Michael Anthony, and Ren-Ren Ritualo in exchange for future draft picks.

25|$|As the Railway minister, he has {{advocated}} instituting a rail regulator to fix rail fares, {{a policy}} that is diametrically opposite to the one by earlier railway ministers. He has also advocated de-politicizing the Railways <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> restructure the Indian Railway Board, which lacked synergy before he joined. Trivedi believes that the Indian Railways can add 2% to India's GDP {{and is willing to}} go against his party's line of not hiking the fares. However, he believes the government must modernize the railways, for which a fare hike {{would not be able to}} generate adequate funds, and has publicly criticized the Prime Minister for not providing funds.. Trivedi is pushing for a national policy on railways, that would continue irrespective of political changes in the government. He has also said that the ministry is also open to the idea of privatization, which would allow more funds to be allocated to help the system cope with capacity. He stepped down as the Railway Minister on 18 March 2012, a couple of days after presenting his first ever Railway Budget in which he increased passenger fare. This did not go down well with his political party, Trinamool Congress and in particular its head West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.|$|E

500|$|Following {{his strong}} {{performances}} for Somerset, Kieswetter {{was part of}} the England Performance Programme squad that spent eight weeks of the English winter training in Loughborough and Pretoria. The South African national cricket captain, Graeme Smith, said that he wanted Kieswetter to return to play cricket in South Africa; rather than directly inviting him to play for the South Africa national cricket team, he stated that [...] "the challenge is to get him back into our franchise system first, but he is certainly someone we have seen <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> get back into the system". Kieswetter repeated his desire to play international cricket for England.|$|E

500|$|Ryan Fleming of Digital Trends {{wrote that}} the {{collection}} [...] "is perhaps the best value buy for any console available", and that for fans of the series, [...] "this collection is not for you" [...] as all games (with the exception of God of War III) are available for download, and it will [...] "likely be redundant." [...] However, new or inexperienced players should buy it. Fleming added that it was odd that the PSP games were included as downloads, <b>and</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> have seen content migrate over to the PlayStation Vita. Jeffrey L. Wilson of PC Magazine gave the collection a 4 out of 5 and called it [...] "an excellent purchase for anyone looking for cinematic, blood-drenched action–especially newcomers who get five titles {{for the price of}} one", but added that long time fans may not find much value in the collection.|$|E
