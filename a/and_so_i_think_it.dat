2500|$|The {{collaboration}} with SpaceX had ended by 2012. In a 2015 interview, former president Chuck Beames (2014–2016) explained, [...] "SpaceX was a partner, {{and like a}} lot of partnerships, it was just determined that it was best we went our separate ways – different ambitions. We were interested in their engines, but Elon and his team, they’re about going to Mars, and we’re just in a different place, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was a parting of the ways that was amicable".|$|E
2500|$|In an April 2011 {{interview}} with George Stephanopoulos, Obama said, [...] "I think {{that over the}} last {{two and a half years}} there's been an effort to go at me in a way that is politically expedient in the short-term for Republicans, but creates, I think a problem for them when they want to actually run in a general election where most people feel pretty confident the President was born where he says he was, in Hawaii. He doesn't have horns. We may disagree with him on some issues and we may wish that you know, the unemployment rate was coming down faster and we want him to know his plan on gas prices. But we're not really worrying about conspiracy theories or ... birth certificates. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> ... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> presents a problem for them." ...|$|E
60|$|Yes, I think I {{love him}} merely {{because he is}} MINE and is MASCULINE. There is no other reason, I suppose. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is as I first said: {{that this kind of}} love is not a product of reasonings and statistics. It just COMES--none knows whence--and cannot explain itself. And doesn't need to.|$|E
2500|$|<b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> {{have this}} one thing above all {{more than anyone}} else, ...|$|R
60|$|Before we sailed I {{wrote to}} Sir Alexander telling him exactly how things stood, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> did his son, {{though he never}} showed me the letter.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know it, my honest friend; the sweeter {{the more}} dangerous. Arsenic is sweeter than sugar. I {{know you are}} a very {{sensible}} young man, not to be taken in by an artful Ammonite, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> had better convey your message to the girl forthwith." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the reign}} of Stephen {{there was a certain}} Roger de Newburg, second Earl of Warwick, who appears to have been an {{exceedingly}} active and public-spirited character; and, besides conquering part of Wales, founded in this neighborhood various priories and hospitals, among which was the house of the Templars, and a hospital for lepers. He made several pilgrimages to Holy Land; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> as likely as most theories that he ought to have the credit of these cedars.|$|E
6000|$|Clive and {{his father}} had found not only a model friend in the lady above mentioned, but a perfect prize landlady in their happy lodgings. In her house, besides those apartments which Mr. Newcome had {{originally}} engaged, were rooms just sufficient to accommodate his wife, child, and servant, when they should come to him, with a very snug little upper chamber for the Colonel, close by Boy's nursery, where he liked best to be. [...] "And if there is not room for the Campaigner, as you call her," [...] says Mrs. Laura, with a shrug of her shoulders, [...] "why, I am very sorry, but Clive must try and bear her absence as well as possible. After all, my dear Pen, you know he is married to Rosa and not to her mamma; and so, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> will be quite best that they shall have their menage as before." ...|$|E
6000|$|I think I {{ought to}} be allowed to talk as long as I want to, for the reason that I have {{cancelled}} all my winter's engagements of every kind, for good and sufficient reasons, and am making no new engagements for this winter, and, therefore, this is the only chance I shall have to disembowel my skull for a year--close the mouth in that portrait for a year. I want to offer thanks and homage to the chairman for this innovation which he has introduced here, which is an improvement, as I consider it, on the old-fashioned style of conducting occasions like this. That was bad that was a bad, bad, bad arrangement. Under that old custom the chairman got up and made a speech, he introduced the prisoner at the bar, and covered him all over with compliments, nothing but compliments, not a thing but compliments, never a slur, and sat down and left that man to get up and talk without a text. You cannot talk on compliments; that is not a text. No modest person, and I was born one, can talk on compliments. A man gets up and is filled to the eyes with happy emotions, but his tongue is tied; he has nothing to say; he is in the condition of Doctor Rice's friend who came home drunk and explained it to his wife, and his wife said to him, [...] "John, when you have drunk all the whiskey you want, you ought to ask for sarsaparilla." [...] He said, [...] "Yes, but when I have drunk all the whiskey I want I can't say sarsaparilla." [...] <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is much better to leave a man unmolested until the testimony and pleadings are all in. Otherwise he is dumb--he is at the sarsaparilla stage.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't deny it, 'Tilda,' said Miss Squeers, impressively, 'because you have, and it's {{no use to}} go {{attempting}} to say you haven't. You mightn't have known it in your sleep, 'Tilda, but I haven't closed my eyes for a single wink, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>THINK</b> <b>I</b> am to be believed.' ...|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} {{reference is}} from the newspaper The Australasian of 17 July 1869 (page 17): “Cornstalk and gumsucker are both of colonial growth, <b>and</b> <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> is… bullocky (a teamster)”.|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear Paul,' {{returned}} Mrs Chick, 'with {{your usual}} happy discrimination, which I am weak enough to envy you, every time I am in your company; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> is Miss Tox.' ...|$|R
60|$|The {{argument}} is, I think, very good; but {{it proves}} {{not that we}} are relieved from the necessity of assisting our colonies with payments made out of British taxes, but {{that we are still}} bound to give such assistance, and that we shall continue to be so bound as long as we allow these colonies to adhere to us or as they allow us to adhere to them. In fact, the young bird is not yet fully fledged. That illustration of the father and the child is a just one, but {{in order to make it}} just it should be followed throughout. When the son is in fact established on his own bottom, then the father expects that he will live without assistance. But when the son does so live, he is freed from all paternal control. The father, while he expects to be obeyed, continues to fill the paternal office of paymaster--of paymaster, at any rate, to some extent. <b>And</b> <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>it</b> must be with our colonies. The Canadas at present are not independent, and have not political power of their own apart from the political power of Great Britain. England has declared herself neutral as regards the Northern and Southern States, and by that neutrality the Canadas are bound; and yet the Canadas were not consulted in the matter. Should England go to war with France, Canada must close her ports against French vessels. If England chooses to send her troops to Canadian barracks, Canada cannot refuse to accept them. If England should send to Canada an unpopular governor, Canada has no power to reject his services. As long as Canada is a colony so called, she cannot be independent, and should not be expected to walk alone. It is exactly the same with the colonies of Australia, with New Zealand, with the Cape of Good Hope, and with Jamaica. While England enjoys the prestige of her colonies, while she boasts that such large and now populous territories are her dependencies, she must and should be content to pay some portion of the bill. Surely it is absurd on our part to quarrel with Caffre warfare, with New Zealand fighting, and the rest of it. Such complaints remind one of an ancient pater familias who insists on having his children and his grandchildren under the old paternal roof, and then grumbles because the butcher's bill is high. Those who will keep large households and bountiful tables should not be afraid of facing the butcher's bill or unhappy at the tonnage of the coal. It is a grand thing, that power of keeping a large table; but it ceases to be grand when the items heaped upon it cause inward groans and outward moodiness.|$|E

5000|$|Albert James Williams Myers, {{professor}} of Black Studies at the State University of New York at New Paltz remarks, [...] "I think that political officials in Albany and elsewhere within New York felt that since Pinkster was a gathering for Africans {{that perhaps it}} could lead to a revolt <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was really fear of the possibility that something like this could happen that we have to bring it to an end. So {{for all intents and purposes}} Pinkster is a memory, at least the way it was celebrated along the Hudson before 1811." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we {{had better}} not," [...] said Lady Montfort to Myra. [...] "After all, {{there is nothing like}} 'my crust of bread <b>and</b> liberty,' <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> {{we had better}} stay at the Bristol." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of myself, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of {{all other}} human beings, as circles of thought and experience, each a little {{different}} from the others.

6000|$|... "Let Pharaoh pardon me, but {{the counsel}} that I gave I still give; the assent that I refused I still refuse, because my heart {{tells me that}} so it is right to do, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> will Egypt be saved from many troubles." ...|$|R

60|$|Quest. But is {{not this}} the way to make Christ to loath us? You know when {{children}} fall down in the dirt, they do usually before they go home make their clothes as clean as they can, for fear their parents should chide them; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> should we.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{would be}} just as good a son as Augustus, only that he has turned out uncommonly badly. I have not the {{slightest}} feeling in the world as to his birth, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> showed pretty plainly. But nothing could stop him in his course, and therefore I told the truth, that's all." [...] In answer to this, Harry found it quite impossible to say a word, but got away to his bedroom and dressed for dinner as quickly as possible.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, that is odd, Maud. Both {{mother and}} myself were struck with the resemblance, this evening, {{and we were}} both delighted to see it. Papa is quite {{handsome}}, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> is Bob. Mother {{says he is not}} quite as handsome as father was, at his age, but so like him, it is surprising!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I keep {{thinking}} about it. I {{want to do}} what Sue thinks is right, and to see it just in the light she does; and I've told her I would do exactly as she said about it; but now she won't say; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we've got to wait and hear from father. Don't you?" ...|$|R
5000|$|In another {{interview}} with Terrorizer magazine, drummer Paul Mazurkiewicz stated {{his thoughts on}} the album saying: [...] "I think working with Erik again has definitely brought things up a little for us. I mean all the band {{were involved in the}} writing process of this album along with Rutan <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> this one's a tad more individual than Kill." ...|$|R
6000|$|I humbly {{told you}} many moons ago [...] For high preferment {{you were all}} unfit. A clumsy bear makes but a sorry show [...] Climbing a pole.

6000|$|... "'I {{knew you}} would be,' {{continued}} Anita. 'But of course neither of us will want very much done for us if we live a cotter's life with these simple surroundings, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> one man will be quite enough to do for you all you will want done.

6000|$|... "Paris is {{no place}} for me. I will but {{continue}} to stumble into more and more serious pitfalls. The man-made restrictions are irksome. I feel always that I am a prisoner. I cannot endure it, my friend, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>I</b> shall go back to my own jungle, and lead the life that God intended that I should lead when He put me there." ...|$|R
5000|$|However, {{in another}} interview, Adams did clarify {{that he did}} not dislike Williams, stating [...] "I think Robin himself is compassion, {{generosity}} and funny. <b>I</b> like to <b>think</b> that that's who <b>I</b> am, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he was the only actor I wanted to play me, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> he did a fabulous job." [...] Williams also had actively supported St. Jude Children's Research Hospital for several years.|$|R
6000|$|He {{examined}} it with much care, turning {{it up and}} down, {{and looking at the}} seal very attentively. 'All's right, I see; it has the private mark for haste and speed. I bless my Maker that I am no great man, or great man's fellow; <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> no more of these passages than just to help them forward in the way of business. You are an utter stranger in these parts, I warrant?' ...|$|R
60|$|I said {{it without}} anger, without heat of any sort: a calm, cold {{statement}} of {{a step that}} it was necessary to take. It was a just measure, the only measure that could mend an unjust situation. <b>And</b> <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> she too viewed it. For she did not start, or cry out in horror, or manifest the slightest surprise at my proposal. But she shook her head, and smiled very wistfully.|$|R
5000|$|In a December 2012 AfterElton.com interview, {{director}} Fall {{stated that}} he was very proud of the film, noting that [...] "it was kind of subversive, because it really was an entertaining comedy. But the politics are clear in the movie <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> a lot of people watched it as sheer entertainment but there’s an explicit political agenda going on. It was a very clever way, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> Kind of a spoonful of sugar thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As to revenue," [...] said Rectus, {{just before}} we reached the hotel, [...] "I don't believe these people have much money to give {{for the support of}} a queen, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> they ought to bring in provisions. The whole thing might be portioned out. She ought to have so many conchs a week, so many sticks of sugar-cane, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> many yams <b>and</b> other stuff. This might be fixed so that it wouldn't come hard on anybody." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You have, I hope, {{received}} full satisfaction by {{the last}} post {{in the matter of}} Marsillac [Marsilly], for my Ld. Arlington has sent to Mr. Montague [English ambassador at Paris] his history all the time he was here, by which you will see how little credit he had here, and that particularly my Lord Arlington was not in his good graces, because he did not receive that satisfaction, in his negotiation, he expected, and that was only in relation to the Swissers, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> have said enough of this matter.' ...|$|R
30|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> we’re {{gradually}} getting most faculty {{on board}} with the way that these things should be done, and the current chair of the department certainly likes our teaching <b>and</b> <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the atmosphere <b>and</b> the dynamic within the department is to continue these things. Exactly who will do them is not exactly obvious… I’m not exactly sure how it would work out, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that the atmosphere and philosophy of the department has gone beyond some barrier, which <b>I</b> <b>think</b> could sustain this even in our absence.|$|R
30|$|It {{amazes me}} sometimes, when I sit in our {{collaboration}} {{meetings at the}} ideas that people come up with. And how they can gear their subject towards how other subjects are doing something. Like the migration project. You know how the science teacher was able to tie in the migration of things with the humanities part, and the social studies. And even Spanish. The ideas that come to the table. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> as the year has progressed {{and we got to}} know each other better, the planning has gotten better also.|$|R
6000|$|... 'That will do. You can go,' {{said the}} Emperor, abruptly. Then, when the {{secretary}} {{had left the}} room, he strode across with {{his hands behind his}} back, and he looked me up and down without a word. Though he was a small man himself, he was very fond of having fine-looking fellows about him, <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that my appearance gave him pleasure. For my own part, I raised one hand to the salute and held the other upon the hilt of my sabre, looking straight ahead of me, as a soldier should.|$|R
