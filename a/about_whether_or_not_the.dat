5|$|The {{sea mink}} (Neovison macrodon) is a {{recently}} extinct species of mink {{from the eastern}} coast of North America in the family Mustelidae, the largest family in the order Carnivora. It was most {{closely related to the}} American mink (Neovison vison), with debate <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> sea mink should be considered a subspecies of the American mink (making it Neovison vison macrodon) or a species of its own. The main justification for a separate species designation is the size difference between the two minks, but other distinctions have been made, such as its redder fur. The only known remains are fragments unearthed in Native American shell middens. Its actual size is speculative, based largely on tooth remains.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} much fan debate <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> Zelda titles for the Satellaview (collectively known as the BS Zelda games) should be {{considered}} enhanced remakes or spin-off titles, {{whether or not their}} plots (different plots from the prior titles in 3 of the 4 Satellaview games) should be regarded as canonical or not, and if so where they should fit into the timeline of Zelda events.|$|E

25|$|From 12 to 15 March {{the people}} of Namie were {{evacuated}} by the local officials to {{a place in the}} north of the town. This may have been in an area directly affected by a cloud of radioactive materials from the plants. There are conflicting reports <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> government knew at the time the extent of the danger, or even how much danger there was.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a debate}} within the medical and {{bioethics}} literature <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> non-voluntary (and by extension, involuntary) killing of patients {{can be regarded as}} euthanasia, irrespective of intent or the patient's circumstances. In the definitions offered by Beauchamp and Davidson and, later, by Wreen, consent {{on the part of the}} patient was not considered as one of their criteria, although it may have been required to justify euthanasia. However, others see consent as essential.|$|E
25|$|The Great Depression stymied {{construction}} on many campuses, including Harvard's. Subsequently, World War II caused difficulty for many colleges, although {{immediately after the}} war {{there was a large}} {{increase in the number of}} students attending college due to the G.I. Bill. The bill featured the provision of tuition to returning soldiers. This led to a boom in {{construction on}} campuses across the country, despite uncertainty <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> increased population would be sustained after the post-war frenzy.|$|E

25|$|In the Talmud, {{there is}} fierce dispute <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> term mamzer {{included}} {{a child who}} had a Jewish mother, and a father who is either non-Jewish or a slave (or both); although the Talmud eventually concludes {{that this is not}} the case, a number of scholars now suspect that this was actually the original definition of mamzer. Abraham Geiger, a prominent Jewish scholar and rabbi of the mid 19th century, suggested that the etymological origin of mamzer might be ma'am zar, which means belonging to a foreign people.|$|E
25|$|The Hyde Amendment prohibits {{federal funding}} for abortions in {{government}} related health programs unless they are performed in cases of rape, incest, or {{to save the life}} of the mother. A political controversy has broken out <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> 'public plan' in HR 3200 will cover abortions, which, if done, would be funded by premiums paid by individuals to that agency and not by outside payments. After rejecting Democratic Rep. Lois Capps's amendment to segregate abortion funding, the House or Representatives voted for tighter restrictions on {{federal funding for}} elective abortions via the Stupak Amendment.|$|E
25|$|The 2001 season saw the {{emergence}} of JUCO transfer Seneca Wallace and star wide receiver Lane Danielson. The dynamic duo led the Cyclones to a last second win over Iowa, a 7–5 overall record, and {{an invitation to the}} Independence Bowl against Alabama, their second consecutive bowl game. The Cyclones just missed a 47-yard field goal attempt with 0:46 remaining in the fourth, which would have given State the lead and potential victory. Subsequent to the game there was some question <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> field goal was actually good, as it sailed directly over one of the uprights. The Cyclones lost 13–14.|$|E

25|$|Early {{on in the}} {{development}} of its nuclear weapons, the United States relied in part on information-sharing with both the United Kingdom and Canada, as codified in the Quebec Agreement of 1943. These three parties agreed not to share nuclear weapons information with other countries without the consent of the others, an early attempt at nonproliferation. After {{the development}} of the first nuclear weapons during World War II, though, there was much debate within the political circles and public sphere of the United States <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> country should attempt to maintain a monopoly on nuclear technology, or whether it should undertake a program of information sharing with other nations (especially its former ally and likely competitor, the Soviet Union), or submit control of its weapons to some sort of international organization (such as the United Nations) who would use them to attempt to maintain world peace. Though fear of a nuclear arms race spurred many politicians and scientists to advocate some degree of international control or sharing of nuclear weapons and information, many politicians and members of the military believed that it was better in the short term to maintain high standards of nuclear secrecy and to forestall a Soviet bomb as long as possible (and they did not believe the USSR would actually submit to international controls in good faith).|$|E
25|$|A second mostly {{complete}} skeleton (AMNH5886) {{was found}} in 1904 in Hell Creek Formation rocks at Crooked Creek in central Montana by Oscar Hunter, a rancher. Upon finding the partially exposed specimen, he and a companion argued <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> remains were recent or fossil. Hunter demonstrated that they were brittle and thus stone by kicking the tops off the vertebrae, an act later lamented by the eventual collector Barnum Brown. Another cowboy, Alfred Sensiba, bought the specimen from Hunter for a pistol, and later sold it to Brown, who excavated it for the American Museum of Natural History in 1906. This specimen had a nearly complete vertebral column, permitting the restoration of Cope's specimen. In 1907, these two specimens were mounted side-by-side in the American Museum of Natural History, under the name Trachodon mirabilis. Cope's specimen is positioned on all fours with its head down, as if feeding, because it has the better skull, while Brown's specimen, with a less perfect skull, is posed bipedally with the head less accessible. Henry Fairfield Osborn described the tableau as representing the two animals feeding along a marsh, the standing individual having been startled by the approach of a Tyrannosaurus. Impressions of appropriate plant remains and shells based on associated fossils were included {{on the base of}} the group, including ginkgo leaves, Sequoia cones, and horsetail rushes.|$|E
500|$|Clinton gave {{testimony}} to two congressional foreign affairs committees on January 23, 2013, regarding the Benghazi attack. She defended her actions {{in response to}} the incident and, while still accepting formal responsibility, said she had had no direct role in specific discussions beforehand regarding consulate security. Congressional Republicans challenged her on several points, to which she responded. In particular, after persistent questioning <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> administration had issued inaccurate [...] "talking points" [...] after the attack, Clinton responded with the much-quoted rejoinder, [...] "With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they'd they go kill some Americans? What difference at this point does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and {{do everything we can to}} prevent it from ever happening again, Senator." ...|$|E

500|$|The gopher {{spends most}} of its time {{excavating}} tunnels in search of food, and the hard clay soils of the Willamette Valley pose a challenge. Although the gopher's front claws are too weak to dig through the clay (particularly during dry seasons), its large incisors and strongly protuberant orientation are well-adapted for this purpose. Tunnel systems constructed by the camas pocket gopher can be complex, with some tunnels exceeding [...] in length. About [...] in diameter, the tunnels are up to [...] deep. When soils are damp the gopher constructs ventilation ducts or chimney mounds (possibly unique to the species), to increase ventilation. The chimney mounds rise vertically , are open {{at the top and}} are thought to ventilate the burrows in accordance with Bernoulli's principle. It is not known if adjacent gopher burrowing systems interconnect. Reports differ <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> ranges of the camas pocket gopher and the Mazama pocket gopher overlap; if so, this refutes the previous belief that Oregon gopher ranges do not overlap.|$|E
500|$|Justin Chang, {{writing for}} Variety magazine, gave the film a {{positive}} review {{and called it}} [...] "the most grueling and sustained American combat picture since Black Hawk Down, {{as well as a}} prime example of how impressive physical filmmaking can overcome even fundamental deficiencies in script and characterization." [...] Alonso Duralde, writing for The Wrap, stated, [...] "The film never makes a grand statement <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> war in Afghanistan is, per se, a mistake, but it does portray war itself as a disgusting folly. Berg sets up the cathartic moments we’re used to in movies like this, but then he pulls out the rug, reminding us that the cavalry doesn’t always miraculously show up in time to save the day." [...] Todd McCarthy, writing for The Hollywood Reporter, described the film as being [...] "rugged, skilled, relentless, determined, narrow-minded and focused, everything that a soldier must be when his life is on the line," [...] while Scott Bowles of USA Today called Lone Survivor [...] "brutal, unrelenting and ultimately moving." [...] Leonard Maltin described the film as [...] "visceral", while praising Berg, the main actors, and the stunt performers for successfully reenacting the events of Operation Red Wings. Maltin concluded that the film [...] "is a tough movie but a rewarding one. It's humbling to watch this dramatization of the sacrifices these men make, without hesitation. Peter Berg was determined to do justice to them, and he has succeeded." [...] Betsy Sharkey, writing for The Los Angeles Times, praised the overall look of the film: [...] "The production and costume designers have paid {{a great deal of attention}} to the details, from the uniforms and tribal robes, to the bullet wounds and blood. It certainly adds to the film's verisimilitude." ...|$|E
