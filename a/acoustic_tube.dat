40|$|This work proposes an {{experimental}} method for direct measurement of transfer functions of <b>acoustic</b> <b>tubes.</b> The method obtains a pressure-to-velocity transfer function from measurement of input volume velocity and output pressures {{of a target}} tube. Steady sinusoidal waves from 100 Hz to 5 kHz with a 10 -Hz increment were used as a source signal. Experimental results compared with transmission line simu-lations indicate the following: (1) transfer functions obtained from the measurements agree well with those from transmis-sion line simulations; (2) differences between the resonant frequencies obtained from the measurements and simulations with a uniform tube are less than 2. 6 %.

The cavity between inner lining and outer casing was tightly packed with an acoustic absorbent material known as rock (mineral) wool.|$|E
5000|$|Gnuspeech was {{originally}} commercial software {{produced by the}} now-defunct Trillium Sound Research for the NeXT computer as various grades of [...] "TextToSpeech" [...] kit. Trillium Sound Research was a technology transfer spin-off company formed at the University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, based on long-standing research in the computer science department on computer-human interaction using speech, where papers and manuals relevant to the system are maintained. The initial version in 1992 used a formant-based speech synthesiser. When NeXT ceased manufacturing hardware, the synthesizer software was completely re-written and also ported to NSFIP (NextStep For Intel Processors) using the waveguide approach to <b>acoustic</b> <b>tube</b> modeling based on the research at the Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA) at Stanford University, especially the Music Kit. The synthesis approach is explained in more detail in a paper presented to the American Voice I/O Society in 1995. [...] The system used the onboard 56001 Digital Signal Processor (DSP) on the NeXT computer and a Turtle Beach add-on board with the same DSP on the NSFIP version to run the waveguide (also known as the tube model). Speed limitations meant that the shortest vocal tract length {{that could be used}} for speech in real time (that is, generated at the same or faster rate than it was [...] "spoken") was around 15 centimeters, because the sample rate for the waveguide computations increases with decreasing vocal tract length. Faster processor speeds are progressively removing this restriction, an important advance for producing children's speech in real time.|$|E

It is found {{that the effect of}} the distensibility of the tube is small and that longitudinal waves are essentially <b>acoustic</b> <b>tube</b> waves. Due to the tube geometry there is considerable difference between longitudinal waves or <b>acoustic</b> <b>tube</b> waves and ordinary acoustic waves.

50|$|Waveguides such as <b>acoustic</b> <b>tubes</b> are three-dimensional, {{but because}} their lengths are often {{much greater than}} their {{cross-sectional}} area, it is reasonable and computationally efficient to model them as one-dimensional waveguides. Membranes, as used in drums, may be modeled using two-dimensional waveguide meshes, and reverberation in three-dimensional spaces may be modeled using three-dimensional meshes. Vibraphone bars, bells, singing bowls and other sounding solids (also called idiophones) can be modeled by a related method called banded waveguides where multiple band-limited digital waveguide elements are used to model the strongly dispersive behavior of waves in solids.|$|R

The vocal organ of the songbird, the syrinx, has a unique topography of <b>acoustic</b> <b>tubes</b> (a trachea with a bifurcation at its base) making it a rather unique subject for waveguide synthesis. In the upper region of the two bifid bronchi lies a nonlinear vibrating membrane – the primary resonator in sound production. Unlike most reed musical instruments, the more significant displacement of the membrane is perpendicular to the directions of airflow, due to the Bernoulli effect. The model of the membrane displacement, and the resulting pressure through the constriction created by the membrane motion, is therefore derived beginning with the Bernoulli equation. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Earphones and headphones, {{which are}} compact electro-{{acoustic}} transducers, {{tend to have}} a lot of acoustic absorption materials and porous materials known as dampers, which often have a large number of extremely small holes and narrow slits to inhibit the resonance of the vibrating system, because the air viscosity significantly affects the acoustic characteristics in such acoustic paths. In order to perform simulations using the finite element method (FEM), it is necessary to be aware of material characteristics such as the impedance and propagation constants of sound absorbing materials and porous materials. The transfer function is widely known as a measurement method for an <b>acoustic</b> <b>tube</b> with such physical properties, but literature describing the measurements at the upper limits of the audible range is yet to be found. The <b>acoustic</b> <b>tube,</b> which is a measurement instrument, must be made narrow, and the distance between the two sets of microphones must be shortened in order to take measurements of acoustic characteristics at higher frequencies. When such a tube is made narrow, however, the characteristic impedance has been observed to become lower than the impedance of air. This paper considers the cause of this phenomenon to be the effect of the air viscosity and describes an FEM analysis of an <b>acoustic</b> <b>tube</b> considering air viscosity to compare to the theoretical formula by including the effect of air viscosity in the theoretical formula for an <b>acoustic</b> <b>tube.</b> Keywords—Acoustic tube, air viscosity, earphones, FEM, porou...|$|E
40|$|An <b>acoustic</b> <b>tube</b> was {{designed}} and implemented in turbulent backward-facing step (BFS) flow at a Reynolds number of Reh = 2. 0 × 104 {{with respect to the}} step height. As an active flow control device the <b>acoustic</b> <b>tube</b> generated periodic actuations at a frequency of fa = 100 Hz which was close to the frequency of the most naturally amplied disturbance of the respective turbulent shear layer. Therefore the <b>acoustic</b> <b>tube</b> educed series of coherent structures in the turbulent shear layer. High resolution 2 D- 2 C- particle image velocimetry (PIV) was used to measure these vortical structures and the reattachment area downstream of the BFS. The flow control result shows that the <b>acoustic</b> <b>tube</b> can suppress recirculation regions behind the step and reduce the reattachment length by 43. 0 %. Phase-averaged flow fields present eduction of the coherent structures in the linear stage of the turbulent shear layer instabilities and the development of the nonlinear stage further downstream. Entrainments of the coherent structures result in higher Reynolds shear stress and more turbulent kinetic energy and therefore convey kinetic energy from mean flow to random fluctuations. The coherent structures are extracted by Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and represented by two pairs of modes as 'PODi+i•PODj', of which the coherence are analyzed by corresponding coefficients. Both first and second harmonic series of vortices are reconstructed as travelling waves in the turbulent shear layer, with the fundamental frequency fa and the overtone frequency 2 •fa respectively...|$|E

40|$|Gerbert of Aurillac {{wrote to}} Constantine of Fleury in 978 {{a letter to}} {{describe}} in detail the procedure to point the star nearest to the North celestial pole. This was made to align a sphere equipped with tubes to observe the celestial pole, the polar circles, the solstices and equinoxes. The use of tubes in astronomical observation is later reported by Alhazen in his treatise on optics (1011 - 1021). The description of pointing to the celestial pole indicates that the instrument must be accurately aligned with the true pole, materialized at that epoch by a star of fifth magnitude, at the limit of naked eye visibility, and then the instrument must remain fixed. Solstices and Equinoxes are points of the orbit of the Sun, so the sphere {{could be used as}} a tool for observing the Sun and probably determine the duration of the tropical year. This sphere was much more than a didactic tool, given the long procedure for the accurate alignement. Moreover "Rogatus a pluribus" (asked by his many students), Gerbert wrote a treatise on <b>acoustic</b> <b>tubes</b> (fistulae) in 980 : Mensura Fistularum. He knew the difference in behavior of the fistulae compared with the acoustic strings, already studied by the Pythagoreans, and the treaty is intended to present the law that governs the length of the organ pipes in two octaves, compared to the corresponding acoustic strings. In terms of modern physics we know that <b>acoustic</b> <b>tubes</b> require an "end correction" to be tuned, which is proportional to the diameter of the tube. This proportionality is the same for every note. The mathematical law is simple, but Gerbert preferred to create a law in which the proportions of pipes and strings should be calculated through a series of fractions linked to the number 12 and its multiples.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} experimental investigation of coherent structures which were generated by active and passive separation control devices in a turbulent backward-facing step (BFS) flow. The Reynolds number was Reh = 2. 0 × 104, {{based on the}} free-stream velocity and the backward-facing step height. Three types of flow control devices, which {{are referred to as}} <b>acoustic</b> <b>tube</b> (AT), oscillating flap (OF) and vortex generators (VGs), were implemented independently on the backward-facing step in order to control the turbulent flow separation downstream of the step. For each implementation of the devices, 2 D- 2 C planar particle image velocimetry was used to measure the separated shear layer, recirculation region and reattachment area downstream. Moreover, 3 D- 3 C(t) timeresolved tomographic particle image velocimetry was employed, within a threedimensional volume at a high sampling frequency, to measure the three-dimensional fluid motions in the separated shear layer downstream of the vortex generators. The first flow control device under investigation in the present work was the <b>acoustic</b> <b>tube.</b> As an active flow control device, the <b>acoustic</b> <b>tube</b> generated periodic pressure perturbations influencing the flow through a spanwise thin slot close to the separation edge at an actuation frequency of fa = 100 Hz, which was close to the most-amplified frequency of the shedding instability of the turbulent shear layer.

40|$|By {{performing}} Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) {{analysis on}} the speech waveform, {{it is possible to}} determine the cross sectional areas, or area function, of a discrete section <b>acoustic</b> <b>tube</b> model of the vocal tract. It is a matter of controversy, however, as to whether the areas of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>tube</b> model accurately estimate the areas of the actual vocal tract. There are several sources of error which cause the estimated areas to differ from the true areas. A procedure for estimating the spectrum of the vocal tract response in terms of LPC derived formant frequencies and bandwidths is discussed; the areas of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>tube</b> model can be calculated from these frequency and bandwidth values. The accuracy with which formant frequencies and bandwidths can be estimated is evaluated by experiments where the frequency and bandwidth of a one resonator vocal tract model are estimated.

40|$|The open-end {{correction}} of an <b>acoustic</b> <b>tube</b> {{has been widely}} investigated in a free-field condition (cf. Hall, 1987). However, no experimental data give accurate open-end corrections for side branches within an <b>acoustic</b> <b>tube,</b> although some proposals have been made [see Fant (1960) ]. To incorporate side branches such as the paranasal sinuses and piriform fossa in an acoustic model of the vocal tract, an end correction coefficient is definitely needed. Thus this study estimated the end correction coefficient of side branches experimentally and computationally. A number of acoustic tubes were used to examine effects of (1) the angle from the branch to the main tube, (2) {{the distance between the}} open end and the opposite tube wall, and (3) the geometric shape around the open end of the branch. The results indicate that the end correction coefficient depends on the dimension in front of the open end, and is independent of the angle of the branch to the main tube. The open-end correction coefficient (Ce) of a branch can be described by the diameter (D) of its open end and the distance (L) from the end to the opposite tube wall as shown: Ce = 0. 414 + 0. 517 × log (L/D 2), for 0. 158 < (L/D 2) < 6. 24.
