5|$|According to the Gallup Organization, Obama {{began his}} {{presidency}} with a 68% approval rating before gradually declining {{for the rest}} of the year, and eventually bottoming out at 41% in August 2010, a trend similar to Ronald Reagan's and Bill Clinton's first years in office. He experienced a small poll bounce shortly after the death of Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011. This bounce lasted until around June 2011, when his <b>approval</b> <b>numbers</b> dropped back to where they were previously. His approval ratings rebounded around the same time as his reelection in 2012, with polls showing an average job approval of 52% shortly after his second inauguration. Despite approval ratings dropping to 39% in late-2013 due to the ACA roll-out, they climbed to 50% in January 2015 according to Gallup.|$|E
500|$|After {{taking office}} in January 2006, Corzine's <b>approval</b> <b>numbers</b> were very low. Many polls seemed to {{indicate}} that much of this negative polling {{was a result of}} the 2006 New Jersey State Government shutdown. An April 26, 2006, polls from Quinnipiac University Polling Institute showed Corzine at a 15% approval with a 72% disapproval. A February 28, 2007, poll from Quinnipiac University showed Corzine at 50% approval with 34% disapproval. When Corzine released a controversial plan to monetize the New Jersey Turnpike and the Garden State Parkway, his approval rating fell to 30% in January 2008.|$|E

50|$|The {{show was}} openly pro-President George W. Bush and it debuted {{at the same}} time that John Kerry had become the Democratic front-runner. The {{inability}} to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, a budget that was seen as out of control, and a resentment over the Presidents tough-talking cowboy image had all caused a major decline in President Bushs <b>approval</b> <b>numbers.</b> While Millers rating started out well with his first episode interviewing his friend Schwarzenegger (the NY Times put the figure at 746,000 people which was a big number in the eyes of CNBC), by March 2004 his numbers had slipped to 300,000.

5000|$|The Conservatives {{started off}} {{the first month of}} the {{campaign}} by making a series of policy-per-day announcements, which included a Goods and Services Tax reduction and a child-care allowance. This strategy was a surprise to many in the news media, as they believed the party would focus on the sponsorship scandal; instead, the Conservative strategy was to let that issue ruminate with voters. The Liberals opted to hold their major announcements after the Christmas holidays; as a result, Harper dominated media coverage for the first few weeks of the campaign and was able [...] "to define himself, rather than to let the Liberals define him". The Conservatives' announcements played to Harper's strengths as a policy wonk, as opposed to the 2004 election and summer 2005 where he tried to overcome the perception that he was cool and aloof. Though his party showed only modest movement in the polls, Harper's personal <b>approval</b> <b>numbers,</b> which had always trailed his party's significantly, began to rise relatively rapidly.|$|E

50|$|At {{the time}} of the 2016 election, polls by Gallup found Trump had a {{favorable}} rating around 35% and an unfavorable rating around 60%, while Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton held a favorable rating of 40% and an unfavorable rating of 57%. 2016 was the first election cycle in modern presidential polling in which both major-party candidates were viewed so unfavorably. By January 20, 2017, Inauguration Day, Trump's approval rating average was 42%, the lowest rating average for an incoming president in the history of modern polling. After one week in office, RealClearPolitics gave Trump a polling average of 44 percent approval and 45 percent disapproval, with a Quinnipiac poll registering a low of 36 percent approval and a Rasmussen poll registering a high of 55 percent approval. On March 27, Donald Trump's approval rating fell to an all-time low of 36%, two points lower than the all-time low of Barack Obama.President Donald Trump's approval rating has also dropped in key swing states that helped him defeat his opponent, Hillary Clinton, in the 2016 election. At the six-month mark in his presidency, an ABC News/Washington Post poll showed that Trump had the lowest <b>approval</b> <b>numbers</b> of any president during their first six months in office in 70 years. Bloomberg polling showed the President's approval rating was at 41 percent on July 18, 2017.|$|E
5000|$|Blunt {{opened his}} speech listing the oft voiced {{explanations}} of his party's defeat which included {{that the results}} were in part “a referendum {{on the war in}} Iraq”. He dismissed the notion that any one single reason explained the loss, saying “Different candidates lost for different reasons.” He saw a bright side in events saying “The good news is that even with these shortcomings, low presidential <b>approval</b> <b>numbers,</b> and uncertainty about Iraq, our candidates saw, even with all those things happening, their ideas taking hold {{in the final days of}} their campaigns. A shift of 78,000 votes in the entire country would have changed the outcome. Our ideas didn’t get beat; in fact, we did.” He applauded the Constitutional system saying the defeat proves “that no one party has a permanent claim to power…This means any viable political movement, such as ours, can never afford to become stagnant or complacent. We must constantly refresh our ideas, assess our performance, and make corrections when necessary. This is a great moment to do all three of those things. For a generation Reagan conservatives have consistently demonstrated an ability to do just that. Nowhere has this been more evident than in our response to the threats of Islamic totalitarianism and the fight with our terrorist enemies.” He said “While the threats of Islamic totalitarianism at times require different tactics, we are approaching those challenges with the same resolve that allowed us to defeat communism. I am convinced that in this fight we will also prevail because the American people understand the need to win. We must continue to lead the fight against Islamic totalitarianism and sustain the will to win the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. …the war and on domestic issues Our plan must avoid the mistakes of the past several years. …I am confident that we will successfully move forward.” ...|$|E
