50|$|Prewar US Battleship {{construction}} was {{limited by the}} Washington Naval Treaty. The US response to the treaty which limited tonnage, and hence battleship numbers and speed, was {{to develop and implement}} high pressure boilers and stabilized guns, which permitted higher speeds, and greater <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> their <b>fire</b> from shorter, lighter battleships. Later US cruisers and battleships had their guns directed using information gathered from the ship's radar.|$|R
50|$|Many of the {{alterations}} {{found in}} the Fabryka Broni Radom P99 RAD variant were also applied in the Walther P99Q pistol. The P99Q is a designated police pistol, which has been certified according to the Technical Specifications (TR) of the German Police (Technische Richtlinie Pistolen im Kaliber 9mm x 19, Revision January 2008). The P99Q is exclusively manufactured for German and foreign police departments and is not available on the civilian market. The P99Q has a partially pre-loaded internal striker trigger mechanism that conforms to the Technical Specifications (TR) of the German Police. When the trigger is pulled, the striker is fully cocked and released, firing the pistol. Trigger travel is approximately 13 mm with a trigger reset of 6 mm and a trigger pull of approximately 32 N. The trigger pull is consistent in length and force from the first shot to the last. The Technical Specifications (TR 2008) of the German Police also demand an <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> for a 10-shot group with German Police certified 9×19mm Parabellum ammunition at 25 m (R100) of ≤ 16 cm. This equals an <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> of ≤ 22 minute of angle (MOA) or ≤ 6.4 mrad. The grip frame has an integrated mounting MIL-STD-1913 (Picatinny) rail for attaching tactical lights and laser sighting devices.|$|E
5000|$|The radar-guided ZSU-23-4 [...] "Shilka" [...] SPAAG, {{with its}} four 23 mm (0.90") autocannons, was a revolutionary SPAAG, {{proving to be}} an {{extremely}} effective weapon against enemy attack aircraft and helicopters under every weather and light condition. The ZSU-23-4 has a very high density, rate and <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire,</b> {{as well as the}} capability {{for each of the four}} autocannons to fire its own type of projectile from separate belts. While it is technically possible that each cannon shoots different type of ammunition, there were two types commonly used in late 1970s: OFZT incendiary fragmentation and BZT armour-piercing tracer, which were to be loaded in 3:1 ratio—three OFZT, then one BZT, every 10th BZT round equipped with so-called [...] "copper remover" [...] and marked. Operators were strongly discouraged from shooting from a single barrel.|$|E
50|$|The barrel {{profile is}} {{relatively}} thin to save weight and is {{ended with a}} slotted flash suppressor. The barrel’s bore is chrome-lined for increased corrosion resistance, and features 4 right-hand grooves. It is not rifled over its full length but partly over a length of 547 mm. In the 1960s, the twist rate was 320 mm (1:12.6 in). During the 1970s, the twist rate was tightened to 240 mm (1:9.4 in), which reduced the <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> with sniper cartridges by 19%. This adaptation was done {{in order to facilitate}} the use of tracer and armor-piercing incendiary ammunition, since these bullet types required a shorter twist rate for adequate stabilization. The muzzle is threaded for the installation of various muzzle devices such as a flash hider. The muzzle is normally equipped with a long slotted flash suppressor.|$|E

5000|$|Constitutions <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> and {{the greater}} weight of her {{broadside}} put the much smaller Java at a large disadvantage. Within one hour, after several close encounters involving the rigging of each ship getting entangled with the other's, Javas masts collapsed. During this encounter a sharpshooter aloft in Constitution mortally wounded Lambert. Lieutenant Henry Ducie Chads now took over command, assisted by the captain in transit to his ship. Bainbridge used this opportunity to distance Constitution {{so as to make}} immediately needed repairs, taking approximately an hour. However clearing the masts and fallen rigging aboard Java had hardly begun when Constitution returned from repairing her damage and immediately took a raking position from which Java could not defend herself. This left Lieutenant Chads no choice but to surrender Java. Constitution hoisted out a boat and sent First Lieutenant Parker to take possession of the prize.|$|E

50|$|The tripod mount, {{designed}} by L. V. Stepanov for the PKM machine gun entered service in 1969 and weighs 4.5 kg. It is a lighter mount for the PK(M) general-purpose machine gun without affecting the <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire.</b> Besides, the Stepanov mount has 20 fewer components than the preceding Samozhenkov tripod and is 40% less labour-intensive.The Stepanov mount {{is based on}} a principle of multi-functional components: the elevation mechanism frame is also used as a pole for kneeled shooting or anti-aircraft fire; the base sleeve also serves as the axis for attaching rear legs of the tripod: the machine gun attachment is combined with the elevation mechanism frame lock for anti-aircraft fire; the fine elevation adjustment mechanism is integrated with the elevation mechanism axis. The ammunition belt box can be secured to the right rear tripod leg. This enables one crew member to carry and operate the gun in combat without having to unload the gun before repositioning the gun.|$|E
50|$|As muskets {{became the}} default weapon of armies, the slow {{reloading}} time became an increasing problem. The difficulty of reloading—and thus {{the time needed}} to do it—was diminished by making the musket ball much smaller than the internal diameter of the barrel, so as the interior of the barrel became dirty from soot from previously fired rounds, the musket ball from the next shot could still be easily rammed. In order to keep the ball in place once the weapon was loaded, it would be partially wrapped in a small piece of cloth. However, the smaller ball could move within the barrel as the musket was fired, decreasing the accuracy of musket fire (it was complained that it took a man's weight in lead musket balls to kill him). The only way to make musket fire effective was to mass large numbers of musketmen and have them fire at the same time. The tradeoff between reloading speed and <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> continued until the invention of the Minié ball.|$|E

Up to date map and topographic information were key ingredients to {{military operations in}} Vietnam, especially the placement of artillery fire.

Surveys enabled the artillery to ensure the <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire,</b> but as artillery units moved to more remote areas it became more difficult to support friendly units because surveys were lacking. In early 1967, Lt. Col. Arthur L. Benton, the former chief of the Mapping and Intelligence Section of the Engineer Sections, United States Army Vietnam, who had returned to Vietnam on temporary duty from the Army Map Service in Washington, DC, developed a system known as photogrammetric positioning. By tying aerial photographs to base maps, artillery surveyors could readily obtain azimuth and location of firing positions. Working with the photographs and overprint of a map, aerial observers could give accurate references to targets. Tests proved favorable, and a system was in place after Operation Cedar Falls." ...|$|E

40|$|Forest {{fires are}} {{frequent}} natural disasters. It {{is necessary to}} explore advanced means to monitor, recognize and locate forest fires so as to establish a scientific system for the early detection, real-time positioning and quick fighting <b>of</b> forest <b>fires.</b> This paper mainly expounds methods and algorithms for improving accuracy and removing uncertainty in image-based forest fire recognition and spatial positioning. Firstly, we discuss a method <b>of</b> forest <b>fire</b> recognition in visible-light imagery. There are four aspects to improve accuracy and remove uncertainty in fire recognition: (1) eliminating factors of interference such as road and sky with high brightness, red leaves, other colored objects and objects that are lit up at night, (2) excluding imaging for specific periods and azimuth angles for which interference phenomena repeatedly occur, (3) improving the thresholding method for determining the flame border in image processing by adjusting the threshold to the season, weather and region, and (4) integrating the visible-light image method with infrared image technology. Secondly, we examine infrared-image-based methods and approaches <b>of</b> improving the <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> forest <b>fire</b> recognition by combining the spectrum threshold with an object feature value such as the normalized difference vegetation index and excluding factors of disturbance such as interference signals, extreme weather and high-temperature animals. Thirdly, a method of visible analysis to enhance the <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> forest <b>fire</b> positioning is examined and realized; the method includes decreasing the visual angle, selecting central points, selecting the largest spots, and judging the selection <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> spots according to the central distance.
