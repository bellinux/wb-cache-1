At 1200 OC, the behaviour of these alloys is improved as the yttrium content rises. However, for temperatures higher or equal to 1300 "C, the presence of yttrium seems to be detrimental. In particular, the distribution of this element in YFe 9 or Y 2 FeI 7 intermetallic particles allows yttrium to diffuse towards {{the surface of the}} product. The high kinetic of this diffusion leads to the formation of oxidized cavities by Kirkendall effect.

In this work, high <b>alumina</b> <b>refractory</b> castables based on the alumina-rich zone of the Al 2 O 3 -MgO-CaO ternary phase equilibrium diagram were prepared by adding synthetic spinel, periclase and dolomite via three processing routes. Bending strength studies at room temperature under several thermal treatments and {{the analysis of the}} elastic modulus of the refractories and their matrices point to two different mechanical behaviours. From room temperature to 1000 °C the refractory castables present a pronounced non-linear stress-strain behaviour both in the uniaxial tensile and compressive modes, as a result of damage to the microcrack network. Above 1000 °C the refractory castables begin to sinter owing to a transitory liquid phase, the crystallization of calcium aluminate cement phases (such as CA 2 and CA 6, for example) and the self-forming spinel phase (refractory castables with periclase or dolomite additions).

40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the efficiency of advanced coal-fired power systems, higher working fluid temperatures must be reached. Some system surfaces will have to be protected by covering them with corrosion-resistant refractories. Corrosion is the degradation of the material surfaces or grain boundaries by chemical reactions with melts, liquids, or gases causing loss of material and consequently a decrease in strength of the structure. In order to develop methods of reducing corrosion, the microstructure that is attacked must be identified along with the mechanism and rates of attack. Once these are identified, methods for reducing corrosion rates can be developed. In order to determine the reactivity of a refractory to the slag or glass in most industrial applications, various slag tests have been developed. The most common are the cup slag test, drip slag test (ASTM C 768), gradient slag test, rotary slag test (ASTM C 874), and the dip-and-spin test.
