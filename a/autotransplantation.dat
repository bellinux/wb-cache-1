In 2004, Donnez of Louvain in Belgium reported the first successful ovarian birth from frozen ovarian tissue. In 1997, samples of ovarian cortex were taken from a woman with Hodgkin’s lymphoma and cryopreserved in a (Planer, UK) controlled-rate freezer and then stored in liquid nitrogen.

In 2003, after freeze-thawing, orthotopic <b>autotransplantation</b> of ovarian cortical tissue was done by laparoscopy and after five months, reimplantation signs indicated recovery of regular ovulatory cycles. Eleven months after reimplantation, a viable intrauterine pregnancy was confirmed, which resulted in the first such live birth – a girl named Tamara.|$|E

50|$|Treatment of loin pain-hematuria {{syndrome}} (LPHS) typically {{consists of}} pain management. Narcotics or oral opioids may be prescribed to help control pain.

Other treatments may include denervation, <b>autotransplantation,</b> renal neurectomy, or nephrectomy. Unfortunately symptoms often recur following these procedures. Limited evidence suggests that drugs that inhibit angiotensin may reduce the frequency and severity of episodes of loin pain and gross hematuria.|$|E
50|$|Golden {{standard}} {{therapy for}} transected nerves is an end-to-end repair of the nerve, {{also known as}} primary nerve repair.

The gap between the nerve ends could then, for example be bridged by a nerve that is harvested from a less critical area from the same patient. The piece of nerve used in this case is called an autograft <b>autotransplantation.</b>|$|E

50|$|A {{commonly}} used nerve for <b>autotransplantation</b> is the sural nerve {{in the upper}} leg. Unfortunately, this treatment does have some disadvantages. First, {{there is a risk}} of donor site morbidity and functional loss. Secondly, patients have an increased risk of symptomatic neuroma formation. Thirdly, a longer anaesthesia time is needed because of the additional surgical site for the donor nerve. Lastly, higher costs also due to the extra surgical site. Despite these downsides, reducing the function of the affected area is beyond the risks committed with harvest of the donor nerve.In case of insufficient amount of autologous nerve tissue or the inability to attach both nerve ends securely and tension free, these two options are not possible.|$|E

40|$|<b>Autotransplantation</b> is a {{valuable}} technique offering a physiological type of tooth replacement to patients with missing teeth. Teeth with open apices (50 - 75 % apical closure) will regenerate with vitality following <b>autotransplantation.</b> The success rate following an <b>autotransplantation</b> is 82 %. The remaining 18 % can usually still be treated successfully with a simple additional treatment. The tooth survival rate 10 years after <b>autotransplantation</b> is higher than 90 %. The use of 3 D techniques {{makes it possible to}} create a pre-operative replica of the donor tooth. With this, a new alveolus can be prepared at the transplant site even before extraction. This technique reduces the extra-alveolar time for the donor tooth and minimises the possibility of iatrogenic damage.
