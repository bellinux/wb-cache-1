25|$|According to a {{majority}} of the interviewed witnesses, the airplane suddenly rolled to the left until the wings were perpendicular to the ground. The aircraft then descended in a nose-down attitude and disappeared from sight behind trees near the airport. One witness told investigators that they saw <b>a</b> <b>puff</b> <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> emanate from the aircraft prior to or subsequent to the airplane rolling to the left. Others reported loud engine noises described as a squeal, whine, or an overspeeding or accelerating engine during the last moments of the flight, although they said that these noises seemed to have stopped, or at least faded before the aircraft impacted with flat ground two miles short of the runway.|$|E
500|$|News {{coverage}} of the battle produced television footage of ZNG air defence artillery at Zečevo firing at a Yugoslav Air Force Soko J-21 Jastreb and scoring a hit on another J-21 using a guided missile. The footage, ending in shouts claiming that both of the planes were downed, {{became one of the}} most significant pieces of material in terms of propaganda and morale in Croatia. Nonetheless, the footage proved controversial, since the first plane is not shown falling to the ground or into the sea, but diving towards the horizon after giving away <b>a</b> <b>puff</b> <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> [...] variously interpreted as smoke caused by the plane's cannon fire or anti-aircraft fire damage. While the first J-21 downing remains unconfirmed, the second J-21, piloted by Croat Valter Juršić of the 240th Fighter-Bomber Aviation Squadron, was shot down by Neven Livajić using a 9K38 Igla and wreckage of the plane was retrieved.|$|E

500|$|Beyoncé first {{performed}} [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] with Jay Z [...] at the 2003 BET Awards. They {{also performed}} the song during the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. She sang {{the song in}} a medley, with the pre-recorded vocals of Sean Paul on [...] "Baby Boy" [...] (2003). [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] was included on the set list for most of Beyoncé's concert tours. The song was the closing track of her Dangerously in Love World Tour that began in late 2003. Beyoncé performed [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] live at the 2004 BRIT Awards February 17, 2004. Monique Jessen And Todd Peterson wrote that she, [...] "...lit up the stage with her performance of [...] "Crazy in Love", wearing a white Roberto Cavalli dress and {{nearly half a million}} dollars worth of diamonds.

500|$|The protagonist is also {{challenged}} {{in his or}} her quest by 20types of creatures. [...] By moving the joystick while pressing its button or by performing the equivalent keyboard commands, the player defends the protagonist with four styles of attacks: a low slash, a high chop, a kick, and a spinning neck chop. [...] The life of the combatants are represented by gauges at the top corners of the screen. [...] Successful attacks on a character reduce its gauge and the character is killed when its life is reduced to zero. [...] A well-timed neck chop (or the bites of certain monsters) decapitates the opponent, killing it instantly. [...] Monsters disappear in <b>a</b> <b>puff</b> <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> when killed, reappearing with a full life gauge in the same room some time later. [...] Although the player character likewise reappears fully rejuvenated in the room after being killed, he or she can only do so for a limited number of times. [...] This limit (number of lives) is represented in the form of globes at the top centre of the screen. [...] The protagonist increases his or her number of lives by collecting skulls that are scattered throughout the game world.|$|E
500|$|The [...] {{is one of}} Naruto Uzumaki's {{signature}} techniques, {{invented by}} Tobirama Senju with the instructions placed in a forbidden scroll that Naruto was tricked into stealing by a ninja named Mizuki. Unlike regular clone jutsus, the Shadow Clones are physical clones of the user capable of cohabiting with their surroundings, performing jutsu, and engaging in battle before dispersing in <b>a</b> <b>puff</b> <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> when sufficiently damaged or at the user's discretion. When clones are created, the user's chakra is evenly distributed among them, making it easy for the user to quickly expend their chakra. While most ninja limit themselves to only making a few clones because of this, Naruto can create thousands of clones due to his large amount of chakra. He can also combine it with his [...] "Sexy Jutsu" [...] to produce the [...] "Harem Jutsu". During Part II, having been unaware of this fact until Kakashi explains it, Naruto learns that any knowledge his clone possesses will be transferred {{to him at the}} moment that the jutsu is canceled. This fact enables Naruto {{to make use of the}} Jutsu in training to gain years of experience in days, and to cover more ground by using his Shadow Clones as scouts.|$|E

60|$|As the day {{advanced}} {{it became}} very sultry. Towards the afternoon I stopped and gazed thoughtfully at the placid Danube, which, flowing round the gentle curve of Slobosia, reflected in its glittering waters the white domes and minarets of the opposite town of Rustchuk. A low, rumbling sound startled me just then from a reverie. On looking up I perceived <b>a</b> small <b>puff</b> <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> roll out {{in the direction of}} the Turkish shore. Another and another succeeded, and after each shot <b>a</b> smaller <b>puff</b> <b>of</b> <b>smoke</b> was seen to hang over the Turkish batteries opposite.|$|R
