5|$|I {{feel that}} {{talking about it}} trivializes it. I've been {{studying}} the Cabala , which is the mystical interpretation of the Torah. I've studied Buddhism and Hinduism and I've been practising yoga and obviously I {{know a lot about}} Catholicism. There are indisputable truths that connect all of them, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> very comforting and kind. My spiritual journey is to be open to everything. Pay attention to what makes sense, be absorbed. For me, yoga is the closest thing to our real nature.|$|E
500|$|In an October 2012 interview, Hawke {{said that}} he prefers great art over politics, {{explaining}} that his preference shows [...] "how little" [...] he cares about the latter; [...] "I think about the first people of our generation to do great art. I see Michael Chabon write a great book; when I see Philip Seymour Hoffman do Death of a Salesman last year—I see people of my generation being fully realized in their work, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> really kind of exciting. But politics? I don't know. Paul Ryan is certainly not my man." ...|$|E
2500|$|..[...] I {{have read}} some history, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> several {{countries}} have {{from time to}} time been afflicted with the same land disease as that under which Ireland is now labouring, and although the political doctors applied many remedies, the one that proved effectual was the tearing out, root and branch, of the class that caused the disease. All right-thinking men would deplore the necessity of having recourse in this country to scenes such as have been enacted in other lands, although I for one will not hold up my hands in holy horror at a movement that gave liberty not only to France but to Europe. If excesses were at that time committed, they must be measured by the depth of slavery and ignorance in which the people had been kept, and I trust Irish landlords will in time recognise {{the fact that it is}} better for them at least to have this land question settled after the manner of a Stein or a Hardenberg than wait for the excesses of a Marat or a Robespierre.|$|E

2500|$|In 1979, Teresa {{received}} the Nobel Peace Prize [...] "for work {{undertaken in the}} struggle to overcome poverty and distress, which also constitutes a threat to peace". She refused the conventional ceremonial banquet for laureates, asking that its $192,000 cost be given to the poor in India and saying that earthly rewards were important only if they helped her to help the world's needy. When Teresa {{received the}} prize she was asked, [...] "What can we do to promote world peace?" [...] She answered, [...] "Go home and love your family." [...] Building on this theme in her Nobel lecture, she said: [...] "Around the world, not only in the poor countries, but I found the poverty of the West so much more difficult to remove. When I pick up a person from the street, hungry, I give him a plate of rice, a piece of bread, I have satisfied. I have removed that hunger. But a person that is shut out, that feels unwanted, unloved, terrified, the person that has been thrown out from society—that poverty is so hurtable [...] and so much, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> very difficult." [...] Teresa singled out abortion as [...] "the greatest destroyer of peace today. Because if a mother can kill her own child—what is left for me to kill you and you kill me—there is nothing between." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{performance}} of US SRI Funds, over the time period January 2011 to April 2016. The paper focuses on heterogeneity of screening methodologies by using panel data analysis, which extends the research about SRI funds’ performance. Using different measures of performance, the study examines the effect of ethical screening on financial performance <b>and</b> financial risk. <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> screening intensity has a curvilinear effect on financial performance, and on risk as well, what makes the choice of screens really sensitive. Therefore, I also analyse the impact of screening areas <b>and</b> approaches. <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> Governance screening has {{a positive impact on}} fund’s performance, whereas restricted screening and avoiding industries badly impact financial performance...|$|R
