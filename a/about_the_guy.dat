5000|$|By {{the time}} I {{was out of}} college a year I had a hundred {{thousand}} words of it, and {{it was evident that}} it could never be finished, because the plot funneled outward for {{the entire length of the}} book. A few years later a guy in Long Beach (up the coast) tied a bunch of helium balloons to an armchair and flew into the stratosphere (seriously) and the event was so inspirational that it seemed to me to suggest a focus for my long-abandoned book.

I remember hearing the Donovan song [...] "There Is a Mountain" [...] in college, where the bridge goes, 'Oh, Juanita.' I was like, 'Who is Juanita? Where did we get to her?' I love those moments in songs." ...|$|E

Describing {{the genesis of the}} album's title, Greenspan explained: All <b>the</b> songs were <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> that I saw down town who were just lonely and walking around. I wanted to give them a voice and all <b>the</b> songs are <b>about</b> <b>guys</b> who are frustrated with their emotional lives, frustrated by women, frustrated by everything. So the coat became a metaphor and an analogy of a way to insulate yourself away from the harshness of a Canadian winter. It’s pretty bleak." ...|$|R
