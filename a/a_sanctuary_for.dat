5|$|Felipe, {{being an}} exile himself, {{received}} any Filipino {{who came into}} their house. Thereafter, the place became <b>a</b> <b>sanctuary</b> <b>for</b> other Filipino revolutionary exiles. They initiated meetings in the Agoncillos' residence, especially during the critical months of March and April 1898. Among these folks were Gen. Antonio Luna and Gen. Aguinaldo. Also, Josephine Bracken, Jose Rizal's fiancée, sought refuge in their house when the Spanish authorities threatened to torture her.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} writing mentioning this site is from William Worcester in about 1480 when {{he referred to}} it as Myghell-borough. A medieval church dedicated to St Michael, belonging to the Athelney Abbey, dates from at least the mid-15th century. This formed <b>a</b> <b>sanctuary</b> <b>for</b> royalist troops in 1642 and 1645 during the English Civil War, and a detachment of the king's army occupied it in 1685 {{during the course of the}} Monmouth Rebellion.|$|E
5|$|Although the Palmyrenes worshiped their deities as individuals, {{some were}} {{associated}} with other gods. Bel had Astarte-Belti as his consort, and formed a triple deity with Aglibol and Yarhibol (who became a sun god in his association with Bel). Malakbel was part of many associations, pairing with Gad Taimi and Aglibol, and forming a triple deity with Baalshamin and Aglibol. Palmyra hosted an Akitu (spring festival) each Nisan. Each of the city's four-quarters had <b>a</b> <b>sanctuary</b> <b>for</b> a deity considered ancestral to the resident tribe; Malakbel and Aglibol's sanctuary was in the Komare quarter. The Baalshamin sanctuary was in the Ma'zin quarter, the Arsu sanctuary in the Mattabol quarter, and the Atargatis sanctuary in the fourth tribe's quarter.|$|E

5|$|During the 19th Dynasty, prince Khaemwaset, {{a son of}} Ramesses II, {{undertook}} restoration works throughout Egypt on pyramids and temples {{which had}} fallen into ruin. Inscriptions on the stone cladding of the pyramid of Sahure show that it was restored at this time. This is possibly because, from the mid 18th Dynasty onwards, the mortuary temple of Sahure served as <b>a</b> <b>sanctuary</b> <b>for</b> the goddess Sekhmet. In {{the second part of}} the 18th Dynasty and during the 19th Dynasty numerous visitors left inscriptions, stelae and statues in the temple. Activities seemed to have continued on-site for a long time, as shown by graffiti dating from the 26th Dynasty (664525 BC) until the Ptolemaic period (33230 BC).|$|E
5|$|The boardwalk {{is within}} the barker inlet aquatic reserve, where the taking of crabs {{shellfish}} and plants is prohibited and pets are not allowed. The mangroves, saltmarsh and adjacent lagoons form a habitat for over 200 bird species with the mangroves {{being part of a}} nursery area for most of the commercial and recreational fish species of Gulf St Vincent. The 2005 Adelaide Dolphin Sanctuary Act established <b>a</b> <b>sanctuary</b> <b>for</b> the Bottlenose dolphins that live in the inlet and adjacent Port River. The sanctuary's northern extent is the boat channel and dolphins can sometimes be seen at high tide in the tidal creeks passing under the boardwalk.|$|E
5|$|Moses Fleetwood Walker {{was born}} in 1856 in Mount Pleasant, a working-class town in Eastern Ohio that had served as <b>a</b> <b>sanctuary</b> <b>for</b> runaway slaves since 1815. Its {{population}} included a large Quaker community and a unique collective of former Virginian slaves. Walker's parents, Moses W. Walker and Caroline O' Harra, were both mulattos. According to Walker's biographer David W. Zang, his father came to Ohio from Pennsylvania, likely a beneficiary of Quaker patronage, and married O' Harra, who was a native to the state, on June 11, 1843. When Walker was three years old, the family moved 20 miles northeast to Steubenville where Moses W. {{became one of the}} first black physicians of Ohio and later a minister of the Methodist Episcopal Church. There, Walker's fifth or sixth sibling, his younger brother Weldy, was born the same year. Walker and Weldy attended Steubenville High School in the early 1870s, just as the community passed legislation for racial integration.|$|E

5|$|Siglinda Scarpa {{says she}} had issues with {{communication}} as a child, stating that “people were not seeing me, that they were talking, but never to me.” It was not until her father brought a stray kitten home and placed it under her sheets that Scarpa felt she could communicate with someone. The kitten was a year old when he became very ill and died. After his death, Scarpa decided to take in as many cats as possible, with the hopes of eventually creating {{a safe haven for}} cats. Scarpa created the Goathouse Refuge in 2007, naming it after an old goat who came with the dilapidated plantation house and the 16 acre property. Originally, the land was just intended for her pottery studio. After the house and studio burned down Scarpa rebuilt it with plans that included <b>a</b> <b>sanctuary</b> <b>for</b> cats, using personal resources and proceeds from her pottery sales to make it possible.|$|E
