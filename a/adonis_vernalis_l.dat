The paper is an attempt to indicate the possible factors which influence the decrease of <b>Adonis</b> <b>vernalis</b> populations. Detailed studies were carried out in six sites differing habitat conditions, land use and the size of <b>Adonis</b> <b>vernalis</b> populations. Observations were made of the abundance of blooming and the number of anthers per flower. The ability for reproduction was estimated indirectly by the mass of pollen delivered and its biological value. The populations of <b>Adonis</b> <b>vernalis</b> differ in number of anthers per flower (94. 4 - 131. 5, on average), the mass of pollen delivered (0. 83 mg - 3. 18 mg per 100 anthers, on average), the biological value of pollen and the size of pollen grains. Generally, stronger populations were characterized by better quality and a higher quantity of pollen. Potential energy of pollen in flowers from Pliszczyn and Łabunie was 69 - 72 %, compared to 36 %- 47 % in the remaining populations.

40|$|The family Ranunculaceae {{consists}} of numerous widespread species occuring from lowlands to subalpine or alpine zones. In Poland, the species grow {{in different types}} of habitats, including xerothermic swards (Adonido-Brachypodietum, Brachypodio- Teucrietum, Thalictro-Salvietum, Seslerio- Scorzoneretum) and decidous forests (Tilio- Carpinetum). Many species are popular ornamentals cultivated fro their esthetic value. Ranunculaceans vary remarkably in the phenology of blooming. Among them, there are early spring blooming species like Eranthis hyemalis, Ficaria verna, Isopyrum thalictroides, Anemone nemorosa, A. ranunculoides, and those that start to bloom in autumn, e. g. Aconitum carmichaelli. The overall flowering duration may differ significantly between years – for example, in Anemone sylvestris the disparities reached more than three weeks. The occurrence {{and the length of}} each blooming phase may vary considerably between sites, e. g. in <b>Adonis</b> <b>vernalis</b> 10 - 15 -day dissimilarities in the occurrence of blooming stages were recorded. Additionally, the duration of the full blooming stage varied from 10 to 30 days. The diurnal pattern of blooming among Ranunculaceae members was proved to be highly species-specific. Flowers of Aquilegia vulgaris started opening at approx. 5. 00 (GMT+ 2), which was 2 - 3 hours earlier than those of <b>Adonis</b> <b>vernalis.</b> Significant differences in the diurnal flowering dynamics can be found even in the same genus: flowers of Aconitum lycoctonum began opening at 5. 00 (with the peak between 6. 00 - 9. 00), while flowers of Aconitum carmichaelii started opening at 8. 00 and peaked between 11. 00 - 13. 00. The flowering abundance may differ among populations of the same species. The management type was found {{to have an impact on}} the individuals’ density of <b>Adonis</b> <b>vernalis</b> occurring in xerothermic grasslands. The control of shrub encashment has already been designated as the factor determining the flowering abundance of <b>Adonis</b> <b>vernalis</b> in Lublin Upland.

For example, Helleborus foetidus and Anemone sylvestris are known to be protogynous, while many of the Aconitum representatives are protandrous. There may be evident difference in duration of each floral sexual phases, like in protandrous Aconitum carmichaelii (the length of male phase vs. female phase = 7. 6 vs. 1. 9 days, on average) or the time spent in stigma and pollen presentation can be similar, like in protogynous <b>Adonis</b> <b>vernalis</b> (7. 5 and 8. 4 days on average, respectively).

D. III. 22.; Fig. 2. D. III. 22 12 - 13 and 22 - 23). At this point, on a restricted territory of about 1000 m 2, a small population of A. volgensis can be found, which presents complex microevolutive phenomena {{as a result of}} introgresiv hybridization with a vastly out numbering population of A. <b>vernalis</b> <b>L.</b> The habitat of the species is steadily endangerd by herborizers and by rapid extansion of the city of Cluj.

40|$|Adonis {{has been}} the subject of {{occasional}} experiment in this laboratory during more than twenty years (Hatcher and Brody, 1910; Eggleston and Hatcher, 1913 (9, 7)). The interest of one of us in this subject was aroused anew by Plutarch’s (17) state-ment that Alexander the Great warned Pausanias against adminis-tering too much hellebore to Craterus, the connection being that the hellebore of the ancients was probably often confused with adonis, which is stifi known as false hellebore, and it is improbable that a useless drug would be used constantly or intermittently for more than twenty centuries. Bubnoff (or Bubnow), 1883 (3), supposed adonis to be the true hellebore of Hippocrates, but later he came to hold a different view. He states that Hierony-mus Tragus first found <b>Adonis</b> <b>vernalis</b> near Mainz in the year 1544; and that Mathiolus was the first to describe adonis as pseudo-hellebore. Mayet, 1922 (15), also suggested that adonis was the hellebore of Hippocrates. Whether adonis was, in fact, used two thousand years ago, it is of su. fficient interest to justify an attempt to explain why it is often prescribed, though it has failed to achieve popularity except in Russia, and adonis is certainly capable of exerting the digitalis action on frogs, on mammals and on man. Bubnoff used infusions representing from 2. 5 to 10 per cent of the drug, and tinctures made with 80 per cent alcohol. This paper of Bubnoff’s presents in condensed form the results of his dissertation which appeared under the same title in 1880 in the clinic of Professor Botkin in St. Petersburg; it deserves the attention of those who are interested in this subject, and many o...|$|R
40|$|Floral {{reward is}} {{important}} in ecological and evolutionary perspectives and essential in pollination biology. For example, floral traits, nectar and pollen features are essential for understanding the functional ecology, the dynamics of pollen transport, competition for pollinator services, and patterns of specialization and generalization in plant–pollinator interactions. We believe to present a synthetic description {{in the field of}} floral reward in Ranunculaceae family important in pollination biology and indicating connections between ecological and evolutionary approaches. The links between insect visitors’ behaviour and floral reward type and characteristics exist. Ranunculaceae is a family of aboot 1700 species (aboot 60 genera), distributed worldwide, however the most abundant representatives are in temperate and cool regions of the northern and southern hemispheres. The flowers are usually radially symmetric (zygomorphic) and bisexual, but in Aconitum, Aquilegia are bilaterally symmetric (zygomorphic). Most Ranunculaceae flowers offer no nectar, only pollen (e. g., Ranunculus, <b>Adonis</b> <b>vernalis,</b> Thalictrum), but numerous species create trophic niches for different wild pollinators (e. g. Osmia, Megachile, Bombus, Andrena) (Denisow et al. 2008). Pollen is a source of protein, vitamins, mineral salts, organic acids and hormones, but the nutritional value varies greatly between different plant species. The pollen production can differ significantly between Ranunculacea species. The mass of pollen produced in anthers differ due to variations in the number of developed anthers. For example, inter-species differences are considerable, 49 anthers are noted in Aquilegia vulgaris, 70 anthers in Ranunculus lanuginosus, 120 in <b>Adonis</b> <b>vernalis.</b> A significant intra-species differences’ in the number of anthers are also noted (e. g. 41 to 61 in Aquilegia vulgaris, 23 - 45 in Ranunculus cassubicus. Pollen production can be up to 62 kg per ha for Ranunculus acer on meadows. Nectaries are secretory structures that synthesize and release nectar, a multi-component carbohydrate-rich aqueous solution. The relative location of nectaries within a flower is under pressure to maximize relations with pollinators, and hence to ensure the deposition of pollen on the stigma by pollinators. Nectaries are common in Ranunculaceae. Location, morphology and structure of the floral nectaries differ among Ranunculaceae representatives. Nectaries are tubular in Helleborus spp. or situated in nectary spurs (Aconitum, Aquilegia). Nectaries consist of an external epidermis, a photosynthesizing parenchyma, large branches of vascular tissue, a nectar-producing parenchyma, and an internal epidermis (Vesprini et al. 2008). Nectar production is generally associated with mutualistic relations with animals that rely on sugar secretions in their nutrition. Inter-species differences in the amount of nectar produced and nectar chemistry are noted among Ranunculaceae species. Significant variations in nectar carbohydrate composition between male and female sexual phases occur both in the protandrous and protogynous flowers. In Aconitum carmichaelii, male-phase flowers produced 2. 4 -fold more nectar than female-phase flowers. Nectar sugar composition can differ between species within genera. The nectar can be sucrose-dominant, e. g. in Aconitum carmichaelii or sucrose-rich and lacking glucose in A. lycoctonum (Antoń & Denisow 2014). Variability in nectar production and/or carbohydrate composition in an individual plant may be considered to be evolutionarily significant. It can modify insect movements between flowers and plants, impact on visitation rates, reduce geitonogamy and thus increase plant fitness by cross-pollination. The floral morphology and the type of the floral attractant in Anemone sylvestris {{is an example of the}} in-between form from entomophily to anemophily (lack of nectar, papillous stigma, dense hairs situated between single carpels, small pollen grains – 10 - 25 µm, lack of balsam on the exine surface, starch accumulation in pollen). In conclusion, the flower morphology and type of floral reward in Ranunculaceae species indicate the patterns for generalized insect visitors/pollinators (Apoidea bees, Coleoptera, Diptera) in actinomorphic species, for specialization towards bumblebees or show in-between form from entomophily to anemophily...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the relationships between}} the species composition of flower visitors and plants in the semi-natural xerothermic grasslands in southern and central Poland. Thirty 10 × 10 m permanent plots were laid out in total, mainly in nature reserves. The vegetation units studied were classified according to the Braun-Blanquet system; these were phytocoenoses of the Festuco-Brometea classes Inuletum ensifoliae, Adonido-Brachypodietum pinnati and the transitional plant community. Entomological research was performed using the Pollard method within the same plots. A particular site was visited only once and different sites were studied between April and August 2008. We applied, among others, co-correspondence-analysis Co-CA, detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and redundancy analysis (RDA) to investigate the co-occurrence patterns of plants and flower visitors and their biotopic requirements. We found that the species composition of flower visitors cannot be predicted by floristic composition when the duration of the study is restricted to one day (but under similar weather conditions); however, there is a positive relationship between the species richness of insects and plants and a positive relationship between the number of plant species and the abundance of flower visitors. The Ellenberg moisture index and the cover of meadow species significantly explained the species composition of insects. The three various vegetation units and five dominant xerothermic species, i. e. <b>Adonis</b> <b>vernalis,</b> Anemone sylvestris, Inula ensifolia, Linum hirsutum and Carlina onopordifolia that were studied across time differed in the species richness of insects. Our results demonstrate that possible patterns in the species composition and the assembly rules of flower visitors are not apparent when the Pollard method is applied. Based on the data obtained using this method, the flower visiting assemblages seem not to be driven by competition and they primarily show a tendency to co-occur which can be an artifact. A plant-focused method that included a rarefaction analysis yielded more insightful results and shed more light on the differences between the dominant plants that shape the physiognomy of plant communities in a possible pollination specialization. </p...|$|R
