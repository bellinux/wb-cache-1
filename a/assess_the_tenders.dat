The government advertised for requests for proposal to build the network on 11 April 2008 and the tendering period finished on 26 November after being extended from 25 July. The expert panel selected to <b>assess</b> <b>the</b> <b>tenders</b> found that none of them met the Government's requirements. As a result, the Government announced on 7 April 2009 that it was establishing a joint public-private company to build the NBN. Construction of the first stage of the network was planned to begin in July with the project being estimated to take 13 years to complete and cost A$43 Billion.|$|E

40|$|Objectives To {{explore the}} current status (2010) of {{tendering}} programs for outpatient pharmaceuticals in the European countries and how these programs operate. Methods A survey was designed to <b>assess</b> <b>the</b> features of <b>tendering</b> programs in European countries. All 27 countries of the European Union plus Norway {{were included in the}} study. The survey was sent to national representatives of authorities and organizations and to academic researchers with expertise in the domain. Results Nineteen of the 28 countries have responded to the questionnaire (68 %). Seven countries have adopted tendering programs for pharmaceuticals in ambulatory care. Tendering was more popular in countries with a mature generic medicines market (54 %) than in countries with a developing generic medicines market (12. 5 %). A legal basis, criteria to grant <b>the</b> <b>tender,</b> <b>the</b> number of winners and the duration of <b>the</b> <b>tender</b> were amongst <b>the</b> features for the program to work. Conclusions Tendering programs can achieve savings in the short term. There are however some problems allied with the policy and the effects in the long term are still unclear. It can be concluded that the policy can work, but the features of the programs have to be well-thought-out. Pharmaceutical Generics Tendering Europe Public procurement...|$|R
40|$|This audit {{found that}} Victoria {{has not yet}} secured full value for money from the Melbourne Metropolitan Bus Franchise arrangements, despite {{achieving}} almost 33  million in cost savings in 2013 – 14. Overview In 2013, the Melbourne Metropolitan Bus Franchise (MMBF) was established to service around 30  per cent of Melbourne’s metropolitan bus network. The contract is worth approximately 1. 7  billion over 10 years. This audit examined whether the state has effectively secured value for money from <b>the</b> MMBF by <b>assessing</b> <b>the</b> MMBF <b>tender</b> and Public Transport Victoria’s (PTV) management of the resulting contract. The state’s progress in reforming future metropolitan bus contracts was also examined. The audit found {{that the state has}} not yet secured full value for money from the MMBF arrangements, despite achieving almost 33  million in cost savings in 2013 – 14. <b>The</b> MMBF <b>tender</b> was soundly planned and run in accordance with Victorian Government Purchasing Board requirements. However, the contract 2 ̆ 7 s potential is not yet being realised primarily due to unreliable performance data. This is compromising PTV 2 ̆ 7 s capacity to effectively manage the contract. Of particular concern is the Department of Economic Development, Jobs, Transport & Resources 2 ̆ 7 (DEDJTR) and PTV 2 ̆ 7 s slow progress toward reforming the balance of metropolitan bus contracts expiring in 2018. Urgent and sustained action is required to avoid limiting the state 2 ̆ 7 s procurement options in 2018, and compromising any opportunity to leverage better value from these services through increased competition...|$|R
40|$|This study {{compares the}} neo-classical {{micro-economic}} theory with <b>tendering</b> theory in <b>the</b> context of price {{formation in the}} building industry. It examines the two theories and determins that while {{there are problems with}} the application of both theories, there are no a priori reasons why either theory should be inapplicable. After discussing the appropriate criteria for selecting between competing theories, the theories were compared on how well they explain and predict the impacts of changes in the level of activity in the market/industry, <b>the</b> distribution of <b>tenders,</b> <b>the</b> strategy for maximising profit, the winner's curse, the accuracy of estimates, the socially accepted price and adjustments to productive capacity. On all criteria the neo-classical model performed better than did <b>the</b> <b>tendering</b> theory. However, both theories have a non-falsifiable motivational core assumption. In addition, neo-classical micro-economics has a set of ceteris paribus conditions and tendering theory has a probabilistic outcome which in practice means that neither theory is falsifiable. Although it is therefore not possible to verify or falsify either theory, the assumptions used in the neo-classical theory are more realistic and clearly identify the domain of the theory, while <b>the</b> assumptions of <b>tendering</b> theory are such that the building industry {{is not likely to be}} part of its domain, and it is therefore not applicable to the industry. It is, however, possible to synthesise neo-classical micro-economics with elements of tendering theory into a neo-classical tendering theory that predicts the winning price, the probability of success with a given bid and the potential profit probability density function. This theory has distinctly neo-classical characteristics. The units of analysis are the firm and the market, not <b>the</b> individual <b>tender</b> or <b>the</b> industry. The profit maximising price is determined by market conditions. Tendering decisions are made in two stages. The objective in stage 1 is to <b>assess</b> if <b>the</b> winning <b>tender</b> will be sufficiently high to satisfy the aims of <b>the</b> <b>tenderer.</b> In stage 2 the objective is to establish a bid with a desired probability of being successful or the desired risk/reward ratio...|$|R

The successfulness of a construction project depends on the "right" contractor being selected. During the 'Lembaga Perolehan' 33 rd meeting on the 4 th August 2009, the Assistant Vice Chancellor requested for a study to be conducted with the main objective is to evaluate and <b>assess</b> <b>the</b> existing rules and regulation related to tender and quotation procedure in UiTM tender process for works and services projects. The main scope of this research is to identify and <b>assess</b> <b>the</b> existing procedure that has been implemented in UiTM and comparing it with the procedure of other agencies in Malaysia and to propose recommendations to UiTM for improvement of <b>the</b> <b>tender</b> process and evaluation. The data gathered for this project were mainly from the Pejabat Pembangunan, Pejabat Pengurusan Fasiliti of UiTM and from interview sessions with personnel from other agencies. The agencies involved were Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB), Telekom Malaysia (TM), Public Work Department (PWD) and Department of Irrigation and Drainage (DID). The interviews conducted were to evaluate processes, as well as looking into the standard guidelines used by them. The first objective is to investigate the actual implementation of existing assessment of <b>the</b> <b>tender</b> and quotation of works and services for UiTM projects. Findings indicate that there were two (2) methods being used, which are the cut-off method and department estimation. The cut-off method provides a certain degree of transparency to <b>the</b> <b>tender</b> evaluation process as <b>the</b> optimum <b>tender</b> price will be governed only by <b>the</b> <b>tenders</b> received and not by other parties involved in <b>the</b> <b>tender</b> process.

40|$|URL] Body schema (BS) is the {{capacity}} to recognize the parts and dimensions of the body blindfolded. Over and underestimation are alterations of this awareness. The presence and intensity of a chronic pain can interfere in the BS and also change moods. We <b>assessed</b> <b>the</b> BS of high competitive athletes (men and women), with chronic pain, so as to identify {{the effects of the}} pain on the motor agility and on their moods. Thirty-six individuals were divided into two groups: 1) active, without pain (n= 20) and 2) athletes with chronic pain (n= 16). We used the Image Marking Procedure (IMP) and the Kinaesthetic Size Estimating Apparatus (KSEA) to <b>assess</b> <b>the</b> BS. <b>Tender</b> point examination was performed, the motor agility through the Grooved Pegboard test and the moods through the POMS test. The BS of the groups showed underestimation for the height and underestimation for the width of the other segments, mainly the waist. The group with pain presented a signifi cant difference between the genders: the men presented more awareness of the width between the shoulders and the waist; the women between the trochanters. The KSEA showed overestimation in all the body parts in the group without pain, and the group with pain underestimation (except for the width of the waist). The number of painful points was no different between the groups. The motor agility was greater in the women with pain. With regard to the mental health, the men with pain presented predominance of fatigue and confusion whereas the women showed anger. We concluded that chronic pain did not interfere in the body schema, in their moods, nor did it reduce the motor performance of the high competitive athletes of this study...|$|R

Hence, {{the aim of the}} present study was to <b>assess</b> <b>the</b> effects of Pilates on pain, quality of life, depression and anxiety in women with fibromyalgia syndrome. METHODS: Twenty female volunteers diagnosed with fibromyalgia took part on this study. Thirteen women were assigned for the treatment group and seven, for the control group. All 20 patients were evaluated before and immediately after 8 weeks. Along with the anamnesis, volunteers were <b>assessed</b> for <b>the</b> 18 <b>tender</b> points described by the American College of Rheumatology, for number of painful regions, pain intensity with the visual analogue scale, quality of life with the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, for depression with the Beck Depression Inventory and for anxiety with the Beck Anxiety Inventory. The treated group underwent a 1 -hour Pilates session twice a week for 8 weeks. The control group remained with prior treatment interventions and therapies unchanged. RESULTS: Statistically significant improvement was observed in pain intensity and number of painful regions (p 0. 05) or for the control group (p> 0. 05). Strong correlations were found mostly between number of active tender points and Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (r> 0. 8, p< 0. 05). CONCLUSION: The results support Pilates as a safe physical therapy resource in improving pain for fibromyalgia patients...|$|R
