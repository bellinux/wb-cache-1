5|$|In 1956 film enthusiasts Jean Gabarit <b>and</b> <b>Jacques</b> Marechal {{founded the}} Societe des Grands Films, a film {{restoration}} company focused on neglected films. The Rules of the Game {{was one of}} the company's first restorations; they persuaded Camille Francois to sell them the rights to the film. With Francois' help they discovered records that led to 224 boxes that had been found at the bombed G.M. Film Lab site. These boxes included negative prints, duplicated prints and sound mixes of the film. With the help and advice of Renoir <b>and</b> <b>Jacques</b> Durand, Gabarit and Marechal restored most of the cut footage from Renoir's original version and assembled a new 106-minute version of the film.|$|E

5|$|Antoine Gardano {{became the}} primary Italian {{publisher}} for Arcadelt, although the competing Venetian publishing house of Scotto brought {{out one of}} his madrigal books as well. Arcadelt's Il bianco e dolce cigno opened one of Gardano's books; as the piece had already achieved immense fame, it was the main selling point. In Paris, some of Arcadelt's chansons appeared as early as 1540 in the publications of Pierre Attaingnant <b>and</b> <b>Jacques</b> Moderne, so must have been written in Italy. After Arcadelt returned to France, his chansons, masses, and motets appeared in the editions of the printing firm of Le Roy and Ballard throughout the 1550s and 1560s, while his music was still being printed in distant Venice.|$|E

Led by established Walloon illustrator Jean Dratz, a young team was gathered, with artists like Edgar P. Jacobs <b>and</b> <b>Jacques</b> Laudy. Vandersteen joined in 1943, and here his comics career really took off. First he created Tori, a reprise of the prehistoric Tor, and {{a few weeks later}} his new comic Simbat de Zeerover (Simbat the Sailor) was published on the cover and in colour, a first for Vandersteen.|$|E

5|$|Competing {{with the}} {{arboreal}} hypothesis {{is the idea}} that birds evolved from running bird ancestors, known as the cursorial (or ground up) hypothesis. This scenario may have involved ancient birds jumping or running along the ground and briefly becoming airborne, perhaps to avoid obstacles or catch insects. As these animals strove to overcome the force of gravity, powered flight may have appeared early on. They may also have used their ground speed to run up trees or other steep slopes, developing increasingly sophisticated flapping mechanism to assist with this. This model requires a highly cursorial and feathered ancestor. Proponents of the cursorial hypothesis cite the legs, feet and hands of Archaeopteryx as inheritance from a cursorial maniraptoran ancestor. This model has also had many adherents over the years, including John Ostrom <b>and</b> <b>Jacques</b> Gauthier.|$|E
5|$|Developed in part {{through the}} {{suggestions}} of Hergé's friends Bernard Heuvelmans <b>and</b> <b>Jacques</b> Van Melkebeke, Destination Moon was produced following Hergé's extensive research into the possibility of human space travel – a feat that {{had yet to be}} achieved – with the cartoonist seeking for the work to be as realistic as possible. During the story's serialisation, Hergé established Studios Hergé, a Brussels-based team of cartoonists to aid him on the project. Hergé concluded the story arc begun in this volume with Explorers on the Moon, while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. Critics have praised the illustrative detail of the book, but have expressed mixed views of the narrative.|$|E

5|$|Electricity {{is not a}} human invention, and may be {{observed}} in several forms in nature, a prominent manifestation of which is lightning. Many interactions familiar at the macroscopic level, such as touch, friction or chemical bonding, are due to interactions between electric fields on the atomic scale. The Earth's magnetic field is thought to arise from a natural dynamo of circulating currents in the planet's core. Certain crystals, such as quartz, or even sugar, generate a potential difference across their faces when subjected to external pressure. This phenomenon is known as piezoelectricity, from the Greek piezein (πιέζειν), meaning to press, and was discovered in 1880 by Pierre <b>and</b> <b>Jacques</b> Curie. The effect is reciprocal, and when a piezoelectric material is subjected to an electric field, a small change in physical dimensions takes place.|$|E
