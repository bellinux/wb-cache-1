40|$|AbstractSteganography is a {{data hiding}} {{technique}} that {{is widely used}} in various information securing <b>applications.</b> Steganography <b>transmits</b> data <b>by</b> hiding {{the existence of the}} message so that a viewer cannot identify the transmission of message and hence not able to decrypt it. This work proposes a data securing technique that is used for hiding multiple color images into a single color image using the Discrete Wavelet Transform. The cover image is split up into R, G and B planes. Secret images are embedded into these planes. An N-level decomposition of the cover image and the secret images are done and some frequency components of the same are combined. Secret images are then extracted from the stego image. Here, the stego image obtained has a less perceptible changes compared to the original image with high overall security...|$|R
30|$|According to data {{reporting}} mode, M 2 M applications are classified into five categories [9, 26, 27]: time-driven, query-driven, event-driven, continuous-based, and hybrid-driven. Time-driven M 2 M applications refer to those applications where machines periodically turn on their sensors and transmitters to transmit the collected data. Query-driven applications reply to certain instructions from MTC <b>application</b> servers <b>by</b> <b>transmitting</b> data. This type of applications allows packet omissions, as adjacent data reports usually contain redundant information. Event-driven applications react to certain critical query or event. Normally, applications {{fall into this}} category when they use priority alarm messages (PAM). Continuous-based M 2 M applications make the devices send their data continuously to the remote server at a pre-specified rate. Hybrid-driven {{is a combination of}} the aforementioned three types.|$|R
