5|$|Refurbishment and {{improvement}} works completed in 2007 included new and reconstructed cross bridges between platforms and {{the installation of}} lifts for mobility impaired passengers. Cosmetic improvements carried {{out at the same}} time included the reinstatement of pole-mounted roundels {{on the sides of the}} entrance vestibule. Other work in the 2000s at the station includes the construction of a substantial <b>air</b> <b>rights</b> building spanning across the cutting.|$|E
5|$|Stations were {{provided}} with surface buildings designed by architect Leslie Green in the UERL house-style. This consisted of two-storey steel-framed buildings faced with red glazed terracotta blocks, with wide semi-circular windows on the upper floor. They were designed with flat roofs to enable additional storeys to be constructed for commercial occupants, maximising the <b>air</b> <b>rights</b> of the property. Except for Embankment, which had a sloping passageway down to the platforms, each station was provided with between two and four lifts and an emergency spiral staircase in a separate shaft. At platform level, the wall tiling featured the station name and an individual geometric pattern and colour scheme designed by Green.|$|E
5|$|Proposals to {{establish}} a joint British airline, combining {{the assets of the}} British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) and British European Airways (BEA) were first raised in 1953 as a result of difficulties in attempts by BOAC and BEA to negotiate <b>air</b> <b>rights</b> through the British colony of Cyprus. Increasingly BOAC was protesting that BEA was using its subsidiary Cyprus Airways to circumvent an agreement that BEA would not fly routes further east than Cyprus, particularly to the increasingly important oil regions in the Middle East. The Chairman of BOAC, Miles Thomas, was in favour of merger as a potential solution to this disagreement and had backing for the idea from the Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time, Rab Butler. However, opposition from the Treasury blocked the proposal.|$|E

5|$|Site {{preparation}} for L'Enfant promenade and plaza began in November 1965. <b>Air</b> <b>rights</b> over 9th Street SW were granted for a rent of $500 {{per year for}} 99 years on November 23, 1965. The actual groundbreaking for L'Enfant Plaza occurred on December 9 but the project was still hindered by delays. The federal government was building the James V. Forrestal Building at {{the northern end of}} L'Enfant promenade, and the whole northern end of the promenade and the associated roadway was a year behind its construction schedule by June 1967. Meanwhile, over-optimistic construction schedules and labor shortages meant L'Enfant Plaza Corp's building of the North and South buildings were six months behind projected schedules. The $23 million complex neared completion in January 1968, and the office buildings, plaza, and promenade opened to the public and businesses in June 1968. The plaza was formally dedicated on Saturday, November 16, 1968.|$|E
25|$|The Pennsylvania Railroad optioned the <b>air</b> <b>rights</b> of Penn Station in the 1950s. The option {{called for}} the {{demolition}} of the head house and train shed, {{to be replaced by}} an office complex and a new sports complex. The tracks of the station, perhaps 50 feet below street level, would remain untouched. Plans for the new Penn Plaza and Madison Square Garden were announced in 1962. In exchange for the <b>air</b> <b>rights</b> to Penn Station, the Pennsylvania Railroad would get a brand-new, air-conditioned, smaller station completely below street level at no cost, and a 25 percent stake in the new Madison Square Garden Complex.|$|E

25|$|However, {{just two}} months later, the deal broke down due to the late-2000s {{financial}} crisis. Not much later, the MTA chose the Related Companies and Goldman Sachs to develop Hudson Yards under the same conditions. In December 2009, the New York City Council approved Related Companies' revised plan for Hudson Yards, and the western portion of the West Side Yard was rezoned. Following the rail yards' successful rezoning, the MTA signed another 99-year lease to the <b>air</b> <b>rights</b> over the rail yard in May 2010. The <b>air</b> <b>rights</b> were signed over to a joint venture of Related Companies and Oxford Properties Group, which invested $400 million to build a platform above both the eastern and western portions of the yard on which to construct the buildings. Groundbreaking for 10 Hudson Yards, the first building, occurred on December 4, 2012.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, Harry B. Macklowe, the {{developer}} of the Metropolitan Tower, planned a large office tower {{that would have}} included not only his own site at the Metropolitan Tower, but also the restaurant's and the lot on which Carnegie Hall Tower was erected. There was an agreement with Carnegie Hall about their lot, but Stewart-Gordon, who owned the lot dividing the project, refused to sell. Macklowe also offered to buy the <b>air</b> <b>rights</b> only and to give room for her restaurant inside the new tower building, but Stewart-Gordon declined. No matter what she was offered, Stewart-Gordon refused to sell the lot. During the planning of the Carnegie Hall Tower at 152 W. 57th St., {{on the other side}} of the Russian Tea Room, again Stewart-Gordon declined to sell its site or its <b>air</b> <b>rights.</b> The result is the narrow twenty-foot gap, separating the Metropolitan and Carnegie Hall towers.|$|E
25|$|UAL Corp. {{passed to}} its {{successor}} major operations at Chicago-O'Hare, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington-Dulles International Airport.

25|$|Midtown TDR Ventures, LLC, an {{investment}} group controlled by Argent Ventures, purchased the station from American Financial in December 2006. As {{part of the}} transaction the lease with the MTA was renegotiated through February 28, 2274. The MTA pays $2.24 million in rent and has an option to buy the station and tracks in 2017, although Argent could extend the date another 15 years to 2032. The transferable <b>air</b> <b>rights</b> remain the property of Midtown TDR Ventures.|$|E
25|$|The {{rezoning}} {{was done}} in response to concerns about the character and scale {{of some of the}} new buildings in the neighborhood. The previous zoning limited the area of floor space that a building could have, but there were no limits on building heights or on setbacks from the street. The new zoning established height limits for new development throughout the affected area, decreased allowable density in much of the midblock residential areas but increased it along wider thoroughfares, capped <b>air</b> <b>rights</b> transfers, eliminated the current zoning bonus for dorms and hotels, and created incentives for the creation and retention of affordable housing.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, after exchanging {{divergent}} {{values for}} several weeks, both parties agreed to mediation, {{and with the}} November court date fast approaching, the final agreement was reached on October 12, 2007, with a negotiated price of $29 million.

In exchange, they received the right to develop several acres near the ballpark. Land Partners II received property and <b>air</b> <b>rights</b> over Dock Street, which was to be created for access to the ballpark from the north.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} Pennsylvania Station in New York {{was completed}} in 1910. The station's <b>air</b> <b>rights</b> were optioned in the 1950s and called for the razing of the head-house and train shed, while the tracks, well below street level, would remain. Demolition began in October 1963. The current Penn Station, part of the Pennsylvania Plaza complex which includes Madison Square Garden (MSG), {{was completed in}} 1968. On July 24, 2013, the New York City Council voted to extend the MSG lease just ten years, {{in an effort to}} have the arena move to a different location so that a new station structure can be built in its place.|$|E
25|$|The station's {{terminal}} layout has posed some unique problems {{ever since}} the late 20th century, since all trains have to change directions and reverse {{out of the station}} to continue on to their destination. This causes long turn-around times and places the passengers in the opposite direction of where they had been sitting. There have been several attempts to change this. The last project, called Frankfurt 21, was to put the whole station underground, connect it with tunnels also to the east, and so avoid the disadvantages of the terminal layout. This would be financed by selling the <b>air</b> <b>rights</b> over the area now used for tracks as building ground for skyscraper, but this soon proved unrealistic, and the project was abandoned.|$|E
25|$|With the {{cultural}} center set for Foggy Bottom, plans began moving ahead again on L'Enfant Plaza. In November 1958, the RLA and Zeckendorff began negotiating over {{the price of}} land and {{the composition of the}} buildings to be built at L'Enfant Plaza. In December 1959, Zeckendorf won approval to build a 1,000-room hotel and five privately owned office buildings on L'Enfant Plaza. The Redevelopment Land Agency also approved the condemnation and razing of 14 city blocks for construction of the plaza, hotel, and office buildings. Construction was scheduled to begin on January 1, 1961, but was delayed due to unresolved design issues with L'Enfant Promenade, the short time-frame to prepare detailed construction plans, and because Congress had not granted <b>air</b> <b>rights</b> above 9th Street SW to the developers.|$|E

25|$|In the United States Supreme Court, Penn Central changed theories. Instead {{of arguing}} {{that it was not}} {{receiving}} a reasonable return on its property because of the city regulations, it argued that the regulation took its <b>air</b> <b>rights</b> above Grand Central Terminal which had been designed to accommodate a twenty-story building on top of it. The Supreme Court disagreed and held that under a new taking test that it formulated in this opinion, the economic impact on Penn Central was not severe enough to constitute a taking because Penn Central conceded that it could still continue with its present use whose return was reasonable. Thus, the regulation did not interfere with its reasonable investment-backed expectations. The court therefore found that the city's restrictions on Grand Central Terminal did not amount to a taking.|$|E
25|$|Construction of L'Enfant Plaza and {{promenade}} quickly moved forward.

The $23 million complex neared completion in January 1968, and the office buildings, plaza, and promenade opened to the public and for business in June 1968. The plaza was formally dedicated on Saturday, November 16, 1968.|$|E
25|$|Between 1960 and 1970, {{development}} of the Georgetown waterfront was studied five times. But none of the recommendations made by these studies were acted upon. Many D.C. residents, including those in Georgetown, strongly opposed {{plans to build a}} series of superhighways throughout the city — including along the Potomac River on the Georgetown waterfront. Each of the five different studies proposed the construction of superhighways in and around the area, and each time the controversy surrounding the recommendation made the study politically unpalatable. A sixth study was made in 1970. Commissioned by the National Capitol Planning Commission (NCPC) and the Georgetown Citizens' Association (GCA), the report made no recommendation to build a superhighway. Instead, it called for the demolition of the existing Whitehurst Freeway. The study's authors said the freeway blocked vistas, inhibited {{development of}} the waterfront, was poorly engineered, and caused traffic back-ups at both of its ends. The report urged the city to bury the freeway in an enclosed trench and sell the <b>air</b> <b>rights</b> above it to developers or use it as parkland.|$|E
