40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{multimodal}} convolutional neural networks (m-CNNs) for matching image <b>and</b> <b>sentence.</b> Our m-CNN provides an end-to-end framework with convolutional architectures to exploit image representation, word composition, and the matching {{relations between the}} two modalities. More specifically, it consists of one image CNN encoding the image content, and one matching CNN learning the joint representation of image <b>and</b> <b>sentence.</b> The matching CNN composes words to different semantic fragments and learns the inter-modal relations between image and the composed fragments at different levels, thus fully exploit the matching relations between image <b>and</b> <b>sentence.</b> Experimental results on benchmark databases of bidirectional image <b>and</b> <b>sentence</b> retrieval demonstrate that the proposed m-CNNs can effectively capture the information necessary for image <b>and</b> <b>sentence</b> matching. Specifically, our proposed m-CNNs for bidirectional image <b>and</b> <b>sentence</b> retrieval on Flickr 30 K and Microsoft COCO databases achieve the state-of-the-art performances.

40|$|This article {{describes}} Arabic phrase <b>and</b> <b>sentence</b> adopted from Bahasa Indonesia to answer three main questions on language absorption, mainly:  how many Arabic phrase <b>and</b> <b>sentences</b> adopted in Bahasa Indonesia? What kind of Arabic phrases <b>and</b> <b>sentences</b> adopted in  Bahasa Indonesia? What are {{the changes in}} the Arabic phrases <b>and</b> <b>sentences</b> adopted in Bahasa Indonesia? This is a library research by collecting all the Arabic phrases and sentences  found in Bahasa Indonesia compiled in the main resources, “Kamus Bahasa Indonesia Kontemporer” by Drs. Peter Salim and Yenny Salim, books on religion, literature, magazine, newspaper, speech in Bahasa Indonesia and conversation among speaker of  Bahasa Indonesia as the secondary resource. The finding of research says that the number of Arabic phrase <b>and</b> <b>sentences</b> adopted in Bahasa Indonesia is 505 phrases or idiomatic sentences.   The phrases <b>and</b> <b>sentences</b> have been adjusted in three aspects, mainly: phonetic, syntactical  and semantic.

40|$|Effective image <b>and</b> <b>sentence</b> {{matching}} {{depends on}} how to well measure their global visual-semantic similarity. Based on the observation that such a global similarity arises from a complex aggregation of multiple local similarities between pairwise instances of image (objects) <b>and</b> <b>sentence</b> (words), we propose a selective multimodal Long Short-Term Memory network (sm-LSTM) for instance-aware image <b>and</b> <b>sentence</b> matching. The sm-LSTM includes a multimodal context-modulated attention scheme at each timestep that can selectively attend {{to a pair of}} instances of image <b>and</b> <b>sentence,</b> by predicting pairwise instance-aware saliency maps for image <b>and</b> <b>sentence.</b> For selected pairwise instances, their representations are obtained based on the predicted saliency maps, and then compared to measure their local similarity. By similarly measuring multiple local similarities within a few timesteps, the sm-LSTM sequentially aggregates them with hidden states to obtain a final matching score as the desired global similarity. Extensive experiments show that our model can well match image <b>and</b> <b>sentence</b> with complex content, and achieve the state-of-the-art results on two public benchmark datasets...|$|R

The result of the study {{has shown that the}} level of girls’ and boys’ use of syllables, words <b>and</b> <b>sentences</b> are the same. When the syllables, words <b>and</b> <b>sentences</b> in the stories are examined in terms of age variable, it is seen that 7 -year-old children use more syllables than 6 -year-olds.
