5000|$|A weight-distributing hitch is a [...] "load leveling" [...] hitch. It is a hitch setup {{mounted on}} the <b>tow</b> <b>vehicle</b> that uses spring bars and chains under tension to {{distribute}} part of the trailer's hitch weight from the <b>towing</b> <b>vehicle's</b> rear axle to the <b>towing</b> <b>vehicle's</b> front axle and to the trailer's axle(s). It can help reduce trailer sway and hop. Trailer hop can jerk the <b>tow</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Trailer sway is sometimes called [...] "fish tailing". At high speeds, trailer sway can become dangerous. Most vehicle manufacturers will only allow a maximum trailer capacity of 5000 lb and 500 lb of tongue weight without using a weight-distributing hitch. <b>Tow</b> <b>vehicles</b> often have square receiver sockets to accept weight distributing hitches.|$|R

50|$|An {{important}} factor in towing safety is tongue weight, the weight with which the trailer presses down on the <b>tow</b> <b>vehicle's</b> hitch. Insufficient tongue weight can cause the trailer to sway back and forth when towed. Too much tongue weight can cause problems with the <b>tow</b> <b>vehicle.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{problem can}} be {{eliminated}} by minimising slack spring travel, and by {{reducing the amount of}} trailer braking force applied for a given drawbar force. However this results in the <b>towing</b> <b>vehicle</b> bearing some of the trailer braking load, something the <b>towing</b> <b>vehicle</b> is often not designed to do. The result is compromised braking.|$|R

5000|$|The {{clearance}} {{between the}} lunette and pintle allows for more relative motion between the trailer and <b>tow</b> <b>vehicle</b> than a ball coupling does.

This becomes a tradeoff between a more secure coupling and a more comfortable towing experience.|$|R
5000|$|... {{since the}} <b>towing</b> <b>vehicle</b> is still slowing down, the whole cycle repeats itself. The result {{is not only}} severe vibration, {{but the lack of}} {{effectiveness}} of the trailer brakes leaves the <b>towing</b> <b>vehicle</b> to do nearly all the braking. The front vehicle thus also fails to brake effectively, and lateral stability is also compromised, risking a jackknife situation.|$|R

Some technical clauses of standards on connection between semi-trailer <b>towing</b> <b>vehicle</b> and semi-trailers are not suitable requirements for drop and pull transport, and application status is not optimistic. This paper puts forward some suggestions based on analysis of articulated vehicle dimensions, interchangeability between semi-trailer <b>towing</b> <b>vehicle</b> and semi-trailers, electrical and pneumatic connector, fifth wheel kingpin, trailer landing gears, and so on, that would provide a reference to revise the relevant standards.

5000|$|A trailer coupler is used {{to secure}} the trailer to the <b>towing</b> <b>vehicle.</b> The trailer coupler {{attaches}} to the trailer ball. This forms a {{ball and socket connection}} to allow for relative movement between the <b>towing</b> <b>vehicle</b> and trailer while towing over uneven road surfaces. The trailer ball is mounted to the rear bumper or to a draw bar, which may be removable. The draw bar is secured to the trailer hitch by inserting it into the hitch receiver and pinning it. The three most common types of couplers are straight couplers, A-frame couplers, and adjustable couplers. Bumper-pull hitches and draw bars can exert tremendous leverage on the <b>tow</b> <b>vehicle</b> making it harder to recover from a swerving situation.|$|R
