25|$|The {{center of}} the nebula, not having much angular momentum, {{collapsed}} rapidly, the compression heating it until nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium began. After more contraction, a T Tauri star ignited and evolved into the Sun. Meanwhile, in the outer part of the nebula gravity caused matter to condense around density perturbations and dust particles, {{and the rest of}} the protoplanetary disk began separating into rings. In a process known as runaway accretion, successively larger fragments of dust and debris clumped together to form planets. Earth formed in this manner about 4.54billion years ago (with an uncertainty of 1%) and was largely completed within 10–20millionyears.

40|$|Different {{types of}} amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) -containing plaques occur in brains of Alzheimerrsquos disease (AD) patients. Diffuse plaques seen during {{early stages of}} AD differ from neuritic plaques in later stages both {{with respect to the}} length of the Abeta {{peptides}} and the presence of other proteins, e. g., apolipoprotein-E (apoE). Since apoE is involved in Abeta transport and clearance, and the epsi 4 -allele of the apolipoprotein-E gene (APOE) is a major risk factor for sporadic AD, it is plausible to speculate that apoE plays a pathophysiological role in the initiation of Abeta deposition. To address the issue of whether binding of apoE to Abeta is involved in initial Abeta deposition, we studied the human medial temporal lobe of 60 autopsy cases encompassing the full spectrum of AD-related pathology. In temporal lobe regions, which become involved {{for the first time at}} a given stage of beta-amyloidosis, <b>all</b> plaques represent <b>newly</b> <b>formed</b> plaques, and these were studied with immunohistochemical methods. ApoE was present in 36 cases, and was frequently co-localized with <b>newly</b> <b>formed</b> Abeta deposits detectable with anti-Abeta 42 but not with antibodies raised against N-terminal epitopes of Abeta. In 10 additional cases, immunoreactivity against apoE was completely lacking in <b>newly</b> <b>formed</b> plaques, which, at the same time, displayed immunoreactivity against N-terminal epitopes of Abeta. The failure of N-terminal epitopes of Abeta to co-localize with apoE in <b>newly</b> <b>formed</b> plaques indicates that these deposits presumably contain apoE-Abeta complexes, in which the N-terminal epitopes of Abeta are often concealed after complexing with apoE, thus preventing subsequent binding of antibodies. Moreover, apoE-positive <b>newly</b> <b>formed</b> plaques were seen more frequently in APOE epsi 4 / 4 cases than in non-APOE epsi 4 / 4 individuals, thereby underlining the potentially crucial role of apoE for the development of Abeta deposits...|$|R

40|$|Picornaviruses {{constitute}} {{a large group}} of viruses comprising medically and economically important pathogens such as poliovirus, coxsackievirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus 71 and foot-and-mouth disease virus. A unique characteristic of these viruses is the use of a viral peptide (VPg) as primer for viral RNA synthesis. As a consequence, <b>all</b> <b>newly</b> <b>formed</b> viral RNA molecules possess a covalently linked VPg peptide. It is known that VPg is enzymatically released from the incoming viral RNA by a host protein, called TDP 2, but it is still unclear whether the release of VPg is necessary to initiate RNA translation. To study the possible requirement of VPg release for RNA translation, we developed a novel method to modify the genomic viral RNA with VPg linked via a 'non-cleavable' bond. We coupled an azide-modified VPg peptide to an RNA primer harboring a cyclooctyne [bicyclo[6. 1. 0]nonyne (BCN) ] by a copper-free 'click' reaction, leading to a VPg-triazole-RNA construct that was 'non-cleavable' by TDP 2. We successfully ligated the VPg-RNA complex to the viral genomic RNA, directed by base pairing. We show that the lack of VPg unlinkase does not influence RNA translation or replication. Thus, the release of the VPg from the incoming viral RNA is not a prerequisite for RNA translation or replication. © 2013 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press...|$|E

Intensive hydrographic field work initiated by the international DOVETAIL project revealed that the northwestern Weddell Sea is subject to changes on time scales still to be determined. Recent observations {{as part of the}} ISPOL experiment showed that the observed variability is caused (as previously hypothesized) by intermittent formation of water masses which contribute to different types of Weddell Sea Bottom Water located high enough in the water column to cross the South Scotia Ridge. We have evidence that the western Weddell continental shelf produces at various sites a shelf water type beyond Gills salt threshold (34. 515) for the formation of deep and bottom waters which contribute significantly to the renewal of Antarctic Bottom Water. Ice shelf decay along the Antarctic Peninsula exposes larger continental shelf areas which accumulate saltier shelf water enhancing deep water formation. This might cause an increased on-shelf transport of warmer open ocean waters with the feedback of enhanced ice shelf melting and a fresher, more stable shelf water column but, in case of ice shelf decay, additional continental shelf exposure to the atmosphere and increased brine release due to sea ice formation...|$|E

A peak of chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations {{was followed by a}} rise of bacterial cell numbers and leucine assimilation rates, of the proportions of cells incorporating 5 -bromo- 2 -deoxyuridine (BrdU), and of community net growth rates in dilution cultures. Incorporation of BrdU was low in Betaproteobacteria (2 % ± 1), and pronounced growth of these bacteria in the enrichments was only observed after the decline of the phytoplankton bloom. An initial peak in the proportions of BrdU positive Actinobacteria (30 %) preceded a distinct rise of their cell numbers during the period of the Chl a maximum. Cytophaga-Flavobacteria (CF) changed little in numbers, but featured high proportions of BrdU positive cells (28 % ± 12). Moreover, CF represented > 90 % of <b>all</b> <b>newly</b> <b>formed</b> cells in dilution cultures before and during the phytoplankton bloom. One phylogenetic lineage of cultivable Flavobacteria (FLAV 2) represented a small (0. 5 - 1 %) but highly active population in lake plankton.

Here we compare remating opportunities and courtship behaviour between three shorebird species: the Kentish plover, Charadrius alexandrinus, the Kittlitz's plover, Charadrius pecuarius, and the white-fronted plover, Charadrius marginatus, using data and an experimental approach from a previous study of the Kentish plover. By experimentally creating unmated males and females, we found that remating opportunities differed between these closely related plover species: remating times were shorter for females than males in a Kentish plover population that had a male-biased adult sex ratio, and in which most brood care after hatching {{was carried out by}} males. In contrast, remating times were male-biased in the uniparental Kittlitz's plover and unbiased in the biparental white-fronted plover. Male Kentish plovers spent significantly more time on courtship than females, whereas courtship behaviour was not sex biased in the other two plover species. The mate removal experiments also provided insights into pair bond stability. In the Kittlitz's plover, <b>all</b> 16 <b>newly</b> <b>formed</b> pairs remained together after the release of their former mates from captivity, whereas newly established pairs were replaced by their former mates upon release in all 12 white-fronted plover pairs.

These variations, in turn, may influence mating systems and parental care...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPrion {{diseases}} are characterised by {{the conversion of}} a cellular prion protein (PrPC) by its misfolded, hence pathogenic, isoform (PrPSc). The efficiency of this transition depends on the molecular similarities between both interaction partners and on the intrinsic convertibility of PrPC. Transgenic mice expressing chimeric murine/ovine PrPC (Tgmushp mice) are susceptible to BSE and/or scrapie prions of bovine or ovine origin while transgenic mice expressing similar murine/bovine PrPC chimera (Tgmubo mice) are essentially resistant. We have studied this phenomenon by cell-free conversion on procaryotically expressed chimeric PrPC. Mouse passaged scrapie or BSE PrPSc {{was used as a}} seed and the conversion reaction was carried out under semi-native conditions. The results obtained in this assay were similar to those of our in vivo experiments. Since mubo- and mushp-PrPC differ only at four amino acid positions (S 96 G, N 142 S, Y 154 H and Q 185 E), single or double point mutations of mushp-PrPC were examined in the cell-free conversion assay. While the scrapie Me 7 prion induced conversion was largely reduced by the N 142 S and Q 185 E but not by the S 96 G and Y 154 H mutation, the BSE induced conversion was retained in <b>all</b> mutants. <b>Newly</b> <b>formed</b> PrPres exhibited strain specific characteristics, such as the localisation of the proteinase K cleavage site, even in the chimeric PrPC mutants.

This lake, connected with the Senegal River, is economically very important as it is the city of Dakar's major drinking water supply and also provides irrigation water for vast agricultural areas. Cutting, performed at 20 cm and 50 cm below the water surface, was very effective in removing Typha stands. However, due to the excessively thick stems of the Typha plants, cutting took much more time compared to similar operations in Europe. It was estimated that approximately 35 h were required to clear one ha of dense Typha stands. Directly after cutting re-growth was observed during a relatively brief period (approximately three months), however, subsequently <b>all</b> <b>newly</b> <b>formed</b> growth tips in the plots had suddenly disappeared. It was concluded that this sudden collapse was linked to a destruction of the root zone due to anoxic conditions. Eventual re-growth was relatively slow as after one year the plots were still largely free from Typha plants. Efficiency of mowing was not related significantly to depth of cutting...|$|E
40|$|We tested new {{strategies}} for the isolation of abundant bacteria from coastal North Sea surface waters, which included reducing by several orders of magnitude the concentrations of inorganic N and P compounds in a synthetic seawater medium. Agar plates were resampled over 37 days, and slowly growing colonies were allowed to develop by repeatedly removing <b>all</b> <b>newly</b> <b>formed</b> colonies. A fivefold increase of colonies was observed on plates with reduced nutrient levels, and the phylogenetic composition of the culture collection changed over time, towards members of the Roseobacter lineage and other alpha-proteobacteria. Novel gamma-proteobacteria from a previously uncultured but cosmopolitan lineage (NOR 5) formed colonies only after 12 days of plate incubation. A time series of German Bight surface waters (January to December 1998) was screened by {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) with isolate-specific and general probes. During spring and early summer, a prominent fraction of FISH-detectable bacteria (mean, 51 %) were affiliated with the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium group (CF) of the Bacteroidetes. One Cytophaga sp. lineage with cultured representatives formed almost 20 % of the CF group. Members of the Roseobacter cluster constituted approximately 50 % of alpha-proteobacteria, but none of the Roseobacter-related isolates formed populations of > 1 % in the environment. Thus, the readily culturable members of this clade are probably not representative of Roseobacter species that are common in the water column. In contrast, members of NOR 5 were found at high abundances (> 105 cells ml− 1) in the summer plankton. Some abundant pelagic bacteria are apparently able to form colonies on solid media, but appropriate isolation techniques for different species need to be developed...|$|E

40|$|To study {{mechanical}} control of tissue differentiation, we designed {{a new version}} of the previously described bone conduction chamber. The bone conduction chamber consists of a cylindrical titanium chamber for implantation in the rat tibia. It has tissue ingrowth openings at one end, located subcortically, and the other end protrudes into the subcutis. The newly developed load chamber has a mobile piston so that an external compressive load can be transferred to the tissue within the chamber. Sprague-Dawley rats had a regular bone conduction chamber implanted in one tibia and a load chamber implanted in the other. Mesenchymal tissue was allowed to grow into the chamber for 3 weeks before the mechanical loading was started. Thereafter, twice a day, 20 cycles of compressive load were applied with a frequency of 0. 17 Hz to the load chamber. This was estimated to produce a compressive hydrostatic stress of 2 MPa. The chambers, harvested after 7 weeks of loading, <b>all</b> contained <b>newly</b> <b>formed</b> bone. The bone ingrowth distance into the chamber was decreased in the loaded specimens compared with the contralateral unloaded controls (p = 0. 01). Instead, cartilage was found in the loaded chambers next to the piston. Beneath the cartilage was a dense bone plate under which a marrow cavity had formed. No cartilage was found in the unloaded controls, but the architecture of the bone and marrow cavity was similar to that of the loaded specimens. We conclude that this model allows load to be transmitted onto the ingrowing tissue and that the load parameters used cause this tissue to differentiate into cartilage close to the piston...|$|R
40|$|The {{ontogeny}} of osmoregulation {{was examined}} in the branchial cavity of embryonic and early post-embryonic stages of the crayfish Astacus leptodactylus maintained in freshwater, at the sub-cellular level through the detection of the sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na(+),K(+) -ATPase). The embryonic rate of development was calculated according to the eye index (EI) which was 430 - 450 microm at hatching. The distribution of the enzyme was identified by immunofluorescence microscopy using a monoclonal antibody IgGalpha 5 raised against the avian alpha-subunit of the Na(+),K(+) -ATPase. Immunoreactivity staining, indicating the presence of Na(+), K(+) -ATPase appeared in the gills of late embryos (EI>/= 400 microm), i. e. {{a few days before}} hatching time, and steadily increased throughout the late embryonic and early post-embryonic development. The appearance of the enzyme correlates with the ability to osmoregulate which also occurs late in the embryonic development at EI 410 - 420 microm and with tissue differentiation within the gill filaments. These observations indicate that the physiological shift from osmoconforming embryos to hyper-regulating late embryos and post-hatching stages in freshwater must originate partly from the differentiation in the gill epithelia of ionocytes which are the site of ion pumping, as suggested by the location of Na(+),K(+) -ATPase. Only the gills were immunostained and a lack of specific staining was noted in the lamina and the branchiostegites. Therefore, osmoregulation through Na(+) active uptake is likely achieved in embryos at the gill level; <b>all</b> the <b>newly</b> <b>formed</b> gills in embryos function in ion regulation; other parts of the branchial chamber such as the branchiostegites and lamina {{do not appear to be}} involved in osmoregulation...|$|R
