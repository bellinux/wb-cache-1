5|$|Although {{the stories}} and {{characters}} were fictional, a number of elements had a real life background, taken from people whom Fleming knew or events he was <b>aware</b> <b>of.</b> <b>These</b> included the spy's name, which Fleming took from the American ornithologist James Bond, and the code number—007—which referred to the breaking of a World War I German diplomatic code. Some aspects of Bond's character and tastes replicate those of Fleming himself.|$|E
5|$|Hitler's {{motivation}} for authorising Himmler's speeches was {{to ensure that}} all party leaders were made <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> plans and actions. Thus, it would be impossible for them to later deny knowledge of the killings. Because the Allies had indicated {{that they were going to}} pursue criminal charges for German war crimes, Hitler tried to gain the loyalty and silence of his subordinates by making them all parties to the planned genocide.|$|E
5|$|As General Building Inspector, Speer was {{responsible}} for the Central Department for Resettlement. From 1939 onward, the Department used the Nuremberg Laws to evict Jewish tenants of non-Jewish landlords in Berlin, to make way for non-Jewish tenants displaced by redevelopment or bombing. Eventually, 75,000 Jews were displaced by these measures. Speer was <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> activities, and inquired as to their progress. At least one original memo from Speer so inquiring still exists, as does the Chronicle of the Department's activities, kept by Wolters.|$|E

5|$|The F-FDTL has {{suffered}} from serious morale and disciplinary problems since its establishment. These problems have been driven by uncertainty over the F-FDTL's role, poor conditions of service due to limited resources, tensions arising from FALINTIL's transition from a guerrilla organisation to a regular military and political and regional rivalries. The F-FDTL's morale and disciplinary problems have resulted in large numbers of soldiers being disciplined or dismissed. The East Timorese Government was <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> problems before the 2006 crisis but did not rectify the factors that were contributing to low morale.|$|E
5|$|The US {{government}} was <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> activities in Cambodia, but refrained from taking overt military action within Cambodia {{in hopes of}} convincing the mercurial Sihanouk to alter his position. To accomplish this, President Lyndon B. Johnson authorized covert cross-border reconnaissance operations conducted by the secret Studies and Observations Group in order to gather intelligence on PAVN/NLF activities in the border regions (Project Vesuvius). This intelligence data would then {{be presented to the}} prince in an effort to change his mind.|$|E
5|$|In early 1321, Lancaster mobilised a {{coalition}} of the Despensers' enemies across the Marcher territories. Edward and Hugh the Younger became <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> plans in March and headed west, hoping that negotiations led by the moderate Earl of Pembroke would defuse the crisis. This time, Pembroke made his excuses and declined to intervene, and war broke out in May. The Despensers' lands were quickly seized by {{a coalition}} of the Marcher Lords and the local gentry, and Lancaster held a high-level gathering of the barons and clergy in June which condemned the Despensers for having broken the Ordinances. Edward attempted reconciliation, but in July the opposition occupied London and called for the permanent removal of the Despensers. Fearing that he might be deposed if he refused, Edward agreed to exile the Despensers and pardoned the Marcher Lords for their actions.|$|E

5|$|Rosebery's {{frequent}} absences {{from his}} wife fuelled gossip {{that he was a}} secret homosexual. It has been claimed that the inscrutable air that Rosebery wore was a mask to disguise his secret homosexual life. The worry of this illegal secret, it was claimed, and fear of exposure, caused his insomnia and bouts of depression. It was even whispered that his Barnbougle Castle retreat was really a venue for clandestine assignations with young men. Rosebery's possible homosexuality has been much discussed in recent times. Nothing conclusive has ever been found one way or the other, but it is possible that he had homosexual experiences while in the care of a paedophile housemaster at Eton in his youth. No evidence exists that his wife was <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> rumours against her husband, or even that she would have understood them, bearing in mind her sheltered upbringing and limited education. Sex education was not part of a 19th-century upper-class girl's schooling. The more public and precise accusations of Rosebery's homosexuality by the Marquess of Queensberry did not occur until three years after Lady Rosebery's death.|$|E

25|$|Parts {{designed}} specifically for R-410A must be used as R-410A operates at higher pressures than other refrigerants. Thus R-410A systems require service personnel to use different tools, equipment, safety standards and techniques.

In addition the AC Safety Coalition has been created to help educate professionals about R-410-A system.|$|E
25|$|Jackson, who was pro-Confederate, was {{disappointed}} with the outcome. He called up the state militia to their districts for annual training. Jackson had designs on the St. Louis Arsenal, and had been in secret correspondence with Confederate President Jefferson Davis to obtain artillery for the militia in St. Louis. <b>Aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> developments, Union Captain Nathaniel Lyon struck first, encircling the camp, and forcing the state militia to surrender. While his troops were marching the prisoners to the arsenal, a deadly riot erupted (the Camp Jackson Affair).|$|E

25|$|By 1976, these {{programs}} progressed to where a long-range strategic stealth bomber appeared viable. President Carter was <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> developments during 1977, {{and it appears}} to {{have been one of the}} major reasons the B-1 was canceled. Further studies were ordered in early 1978, by which point the Have Blue platform had flown and proven the concepts. During the 1980 presidential election campaign in 1979, Ronald Reagan repeatedly stated that Carter was weak on defense, and used the B-1 as a prime example. In return, on 22 August 1980, the Carter administration publicly disclosed that the United States Department of Defense was working to develop stealth aircraft, including a bomber.|$|E
25|$|In general, we {{absolutely}} condemn {{acts of violence}} and human rights violations committed against individuals in Iraq because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. This {{is an issue that}} we've been following very closely since we have been made <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> allegations, and we are aware of the allegations. Our training for Iraqi security forces includes instruction on the proper observance of human rights. Human rights training is also {{a very important part of}} our and other international donors' civilian capacity-building efforts in Iraq. And the US embassy in Baghdad has raised, and will continue to raise, the issue with senior officials from the government of Iraq, and has urged them to respond appropriately to all credible reports of violence against gay and lesbian Iraqis.|$|E
25|$|The provincial {{government}} was <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> issues {{as early as}} 1972, when a Ministry of Highways report recommended developing a new ferry route between Iona Island south of Vancouver and Gabriola Island south of Nanaimo. Another report recommending the same solution was produced in 1988. This proposed route is 22 kilometres shorter than the current route and would have also eliminated the problems with ferry terminal traffic. Ultimately, the government did build a new ferry terminal for Nanaimo: Duke Point, which opened in 1997 and which serves as terminus for the ferry route from Tsawwassen. Duke Point was intended to divert truck traffic away from the Horsesehoe Bay-Departure Bay route. This situation was the starting point from which the fast ferry project developed.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the adoption of}} strategic human resource management (HRM) by for-profit and non-profit knowledge-intensive health services (HS) organisations in Australia. Survey data collected from senior executives is {{used to test the}} relationships between a strategic HRM model and firm performance. Path analysis found that, irrespective of whether for-profit or non-profit, adopting strategic HRM could increase organisational performance. Strategic HRM could be achieved through the cultivation of an external orientation to customers’ demands and an internal orientation highlighting commitment to employees. Public and non-profit organisations in the HS industry facing or undergoing health sector reform need to be <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> both <b>of</b> <b>these</b> orientations in order to adopt strategic HRM and improve their performance. <br /...|$|R
25|$|Stapp's {{research}} on the decelerator had profound implications for both civilian and military aviation. For instance, the backward-facing seat concept, which was known before, was given great impetus by the officer's crash research program. It proved beyond a doubt that this position was the safest for aircraft passengers and required little harness support. Also, that a human can withstand much greater deceleration than in the forward position. As a result, many Military Air Transport Service (MATS) aircraft in USAF and carrier on-board delivery aircraft in USN were equipped or retrofitted {{with this type of}} seat. Commercial airlines were made <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> findings, but still use forward-facing seats. The British Royal Air Force also installed it on many of their military transport aircraft.|$|E
25|$|After {{the breakup}} of the Soviet Union, the Karelian {{question}} re-surfaced. According to an article by the Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat in August 2007, the Russian president Boris Yeltsin unofficially offered to sell ceded Karelia to Finland in 1991 but was declined. However, according to many Finnish political leaders and the Russian vice Prime Minister of the time, there were no such offers, only unofficial probing of the idea. Andrei Fyodorov, an advisor of Boris Yeltsin, told the Helsingin Sanomat that he was part of a group that was tasked by the government of Russia in 1991–1992 with calculating the price of returning Karelia to Finland. This price was set at 15 billion US dollars. According to Fyodorov, Finnish president Mauno Koivisto and Finnish foreign minister Paavo Väyrynen were <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> unofficial discussions.|$|E
25|$|On January 27, 1908 {{the plan}} to remove the {{dictator}} was approved by Afonso Costa and Francisco Correia Herédia (Viscount of Ribeira Brava) for both groups of dissidents. Meanwhile, other conspirators were not only interested in removing João Franco, but also eliminating the King. This change in plans is harder to pinpoint, but a recent study points {{to the end of}} 1907. José Maria Alpoim, who associated with members of the Carbonária, was responsible for a plan to acquire arms, promulgate a revolution, and two plans to execute the Prime Minister and the monarch. Whether republican leaders were <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> plans is unclear; the relationships that existed between the conspirators and instigators of the coupe were later suppressed. But, these competing motivations likely played a part in the disorganization {{on the eve of the}} coupe, which was planned for either January 31 or February 1.|$|E
50|$|On {{the rhythmic}} front, 'Kelly Ground' {{is derived from}} the polyrhythmic {{superimposition}} of pulses in simple ratios, an image evoking the tolling of bells, which also comes into clearest focus in the final sections of the work. Whether or not the listener is <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> any <b>of</b> <b>these</b> technical concerns, the work makes a startlingly direct and expressive impact in performance. The piano writing is resourcefully varied, from the lyrically evocative 'aria for Kelly' (section 4) to the ferociously rebarbative 'aubade' which precedes it. The haunting final section is daringly simple and affecting in its naked harmonic focus, being perhaps equalled only by the similarly bold conclusion of Copland's Piano Sonata in this regard.|$|R
