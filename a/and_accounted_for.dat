5|$|Clark’s direct {{superior}} {{while working}} at SAC was the Governor of Hokkaido (and future Prime Minister of Japan) Kuroda Kiyotaka. The two men greatly respected one another and shared a bond in that they both had past military experience. Their positive relationship facilitated Clark’s many accomplishments while in Sapporo <b>and</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> the wide latitude Clark was given in implementing not just SAC programs, but also his influence on the colonial development of Hokkaido.|$|E

Neither the Soviet Union nor communist China overtly objected to Diệm's actions in creating a new state in the southern half of Vietnam. Nevertheless, {{by the time of}} Diệm's deposal and assassination in 1963, France bought 46.3% of South Vietnam's exports <b>and</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> most of the foreign investment in the country. French cultural influences and the language remained prevalent.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the largest}} crowd to ever witness {{a game in}} Vaught–Hemingway Stadium, Alabama {{defeated}} their long-time rival, the Ole Miss Rebels, 22–3. Alabama struggled to put {{the ball in the}} end zone all afternoon with drives stalled at the Mississippi 8, 4, 4, 4, and 13. Each of those drives resulted in a field goal by Leigh Tiffin, who was 5 for 5 on the day. Other special teams contributions included a blocked punt in the second quarter and a recovered Dexter McCluster fumble on a punt return in the third quarter, both by Cory Reamer. McElroy struggled, completing only 15 of 34 passes for 147 yards, but Mark Ingram ran for a then career-high 172 yards <b>and</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> Alabama's only touchdown on a 36-yard run in the second quarter.|$|E

5|$|In {{its first}} year of operation, Anacostia tied with the Capitol Heights station for the most auto thefts (17) at any Metro station, <b>and</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> 11.3 percent of all auto thefts at Metrorail stations. By 2005, large crowds of {{middle and high school}} {{students}} began congregating at the Anacostia Station, brawling and robbing Metro riders and creating a public safety issue. Metro Transit Police officers, some accompanied by dogs, began patrolling Anacostia, Gallery Place–Chinatown, L'Enfant Plaza, and three other Metro stations to increase awareness of police presence in the stations and deter crime.|$|E
5|$|Moving up from Chambois, the Polish 1st Armoured Division's {{reconnaissance}} regiment made {{an attempt}} to reach their comrades on Point 262N but was mistakenly fired upon by the ridge's defenders. The regiment withdrew after losing two Cromwell tanks. At 12:00 a Polish forward patrol from the ridge encountered the Canadian vanguard near Point 239. The Canadian Grenadier Guards reached the ridge just over an hour later, having fought {{for more than five}} hours <b>and</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> two Panthers, a Panzer IV, and two self-propelled guns along their route. By 14:00, {{with the arrival of the}} first supply convoy, the position was relieved.|$|E
5|$|Production of the fissile {{isotopes}} uranium-235 and plutonium-239 were enormous undertakings {{given the}} technology of the 1940s, <b>and</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> 80% of the total costs of the project. Uranium enrichment was carried out at the Clinton Engineer Works near Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Theoretically, enriching uranium was feasible through pre-existing techniques, but it proved difficult to scale to industrial levels and was extremely costly. Only 0.71 percent of natural uranium was uranium-235, and {{it was estimated that}} it would take 27,000 years to produce a gram of uranium with mass spectrometers, but kilogram amounts were required.|$|E

5|$|The 1951–52 {{season was}} less productive, with the West Indies touring Australia. Playing in all five Tests, Harvey scored 261 runs at 26.10 with one half century as Australia won 4–1. Harvey had {{difficulties}} {{in dealing with}} the dual spin bowling combination of Alf Valentine and Sonny Ramadhin, who bowled left arm orthodox and leg spin respectively <b>and</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> him six times in the Tests. His only fifty was an 83 in the first innings of the Fourth Test in Melbourne. Australia went on to complete a dramatic one-wicket victory. Harvey had a poor season overall, scoring only 551 first-class runs at 32.41 without managing a single century.|$|E
5|$|The city of Nagasaki {{had been}} one of the largest {{seaports}} in southern Japan, and was of great wartime importance because of its wide-ranging industrial activity, including the production of , ships, military equipment, and other war materials. The four largest companies in the city were Mitsubishi Shipyards, Electrical Shipyards, Arms Plant, and Steel and Arms Works, which employed about 90% of the city's labor force, <b>and</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> 90% of the city's industry. Although an important industrial city, Nagasaki had been spared from firebombing because its geography made it difficult to locate at night with AN/APQ-13 radar.|$|E
5|$|The top 10 selling {{states during}} the first quarter of 2012 were California, Michigan, Florida, Illinois, Texas, New York, Minnesota, Ohio, North Carolina and Maryland. California is the leading market <b>and</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> almost 23% of Volt sales during this quarter, {{followed}} by Michigan with 6.3% of national sales. In California the leading regional markets are San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego, all metropolitan areas notorious for their high congestion levels and where free access to high-occupancy lanes for solo drivers has been a strong incentive to boost Volt sales in the state.|$|E

The foreshock was not felt at Borusliqalan (the westernmost village that was destroyed) and the losses were high. The foreshock was also not strongly felt to the east of Lake Urmia (and to the southwest of Tabriz) where the village of Mamaqan was completely destroyed and 85 people were killed. Other nearby villages went almost unscathed, with the differing amounts of damage being attributed to soil type.|$|E
5|$|When the Iowa-class battleships were {{commissioned}} in 1943 and 1944, they carried twenty quad 40mm AA gun mounts, which they used for defense against enemy aircraft. These heavy guns were also {{employed in the}} protection of allied aircraft carriers operating in the Pacific Theater of World War II, <b>and</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> roughly half of all Japanese aircraft shot down between 1 October 1944 and 1 February 1945. Although successful in this role, the guns were stripped from the battleships—initially from New Jersey when reactivated in 1968 and later from Iowa, Missouri, and Wisconsin when they were reactivated for service in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|In 1197, Hubert Walter, who was Archbishop of Canterbury and Justiciar, {{appointed}} William to {{the administration}} of the royal stannaries, or tin mines, and in 1198 William was placed in charge of tin production, an office later known as the Lord Warden of the Stannaries. Under his control the mines became much more lucrative for the king, <b>and</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> a total of £1100 in William's first year of administration. As part of his administrative work he became the first warden of Lydford Castle after it was constructed in the 1190s. In 1199 he was involved in a dispute over the stannaries with another official, Hugh Bardulf, temporarily losing control of them– along with his office as sheriff– in 1200. The reason for the loss of these offices is uncertain. After restoration to office, he remained as Lord Warden of the Stannaries until 1215.|$|E

5|$|In 1959, the Pieds-Noirs {{numbered}} 1,025,000, <b>and</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> 10.4% of {{the total}} population of Algeria, a percentage gradually diminishing since the peak of 15.2% in 1926. However, some areas of Algeria had high concentrations of Pieds-Noirs, such as the regions of Bône (now Annaba), Algiers, and above all the area from Oran to Sidi-Bel-Abbès. Oran had been under European rule since the 17th century, and the population in the Oran metropolitan area was 49.3% European and Jewish in 1959. In the Algiers metropolitan area, Europeans and Jewish people accounted for 35.7% of the population. In the metropolitan area of Bône they accounted for 40.5% of the population. The département of Oran, a rich European-developed agricultural land of 16,520km² (6,378 sq. miles) stretching between the cities of Oran and Sidi-Bel-Abbès, and including them, was the area of highest Pied-Noir density outside of the cities, with the Pieds-Noirs accounting for 33.6% {{of the population of the}} département in 1959.|$|E
5|$|Roughly a {{month after}} the storm, a benefit concert was held in St. John's. The concert raised about $400,000 (2010CAD) toward storm relief in one night. In late October, the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador {{allocated}} $275,000 in funds for 200workers who lost their jobs after two fish processing plants were damaged in Marystown and Port Union. However, union leaders claimed that the assistance was insufficient <b>and</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> just 420 of 600work hours. Following {{more than a year of}} discussions, the plant's parent company, Ocean Choice International, decided to permanently shut down operations on December2, 2011. Numerous insurance claims, reaching $65million by early November, were made following Hurricane Igor's landfall Over the course of the recovery phase, several complaints, including concerns lodged by church ministers, that relief funds for victims of the storm were not being distributed fast enough and the overall process was taking too long. Roughly ten months after the hurricane, work on permanent reconstruction of roadways began in several areas across the Burin Peninsula. By January 24, 2011, The Salvation Army received about $1.6million worth of donations for residents affected by Hurricane Igor, roughly half of which had been distributed at that point. An additional $200,000 had been pledged by donors.|$|E
