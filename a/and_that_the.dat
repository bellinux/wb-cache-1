5|$|There are {{two major}} but {{divergent}} scientific articles about jet stream power. Archer & Caldeira claim that the Earth's jet streams could generate a total power of 1700 terawatts (TW) <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> climatic impact of harnessing this amount would be negligible. However, Miller, Gans, & Kleidon claim that the jet streams could generate a total power of only 7.5 TW <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> climatic impact would be catastrophic.|$|E
5|$|A road up Stjørdalen {{was built}} during the 1850s, {{connecting}} at Stjørdalshalsen to a steam ship service to Trondheim. A concern in Sweden was that Bottenviken could freeze up <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Trondheimsfjord offered an ice-free alternative for export of timber.|$|E
5|$|After Brokeback Mountain {{lost the}} Academy Award for Best Picture to Crash, many accused the Academy of {{homophobia}} and {{for making a}} non-groundbreaking choice, and commentators including Kenneth Turan and Nikki Finke derided the Academy's decision.

5|$|After {{completing}} Lady Spencer's commission, by most accounts, Pistrucci {{suggested to}} Pole that an appropriate subject for the sovereign, a new gold coin equal to one pound {{that was to}} be struck, would be Saint George. Until the early 20th century, gold coins were struck for circulation, rather than as bullion pieces. Kevin Clancy, in his volume {{on the history of the}} sovereign coin, doubted whether the Spencer commission was truly the inspiration for the George and Dragon design which that coin has long featured, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> idea might not even have come from Pistrucci. Clancy argued that such motifs were common at the time <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> story originated with Pistrucci, whom he deemed an unreliable witness on his own past.|$|E
5|$|After the trial, doubts {{were raised}} {{about both the}} story of the {{stepmother}}'s dreams and the fate of Maria and William's child. The stepmother was only a year older than Maria, and it was suggested that she and Corder had been having an affair <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two had planned the murder to dispose of Maria so that it could continue without hindrance. Her dreams had started only a few days after Corder married Moore, and it was suggested that jealousy was the motive for revealing the body's resting place <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dreams were a simple subterfuge.|$|E

5|$|Around 877, Æthelred {{wrote to}} Pope John VIII to {{complain}} about King Alfred's conduct towards Canterbury. The exact nature of the dispute is not clear, but the reply from the pope to the archbishop still exists. The pope told the archbishop that Canterbury had papal support <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> pope had written to the king urging the king to respect {{the rights of the}} archbishop. The writer Justin Pollard sees this letter as evidence of papal support for the deposition of Alfred, which Pollard alleges occurred at Christmas 878 <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> deposition was supported by Æthelred. Other historians, however, do not agree that there was a deposition of the king supported by the archbishop at this time.|$|E

5|$|By January 1944 the Soviets {{were aware}} of {{successful}} British and American jet aircraft projects <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Germans were about to deploy jet and rocket-propelled aircraft of their own. The GKO ordered on 18 February that the NKAP (People's Commissariat for Aviation Industry) centralize jet research under its control <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> NKAP was to present proposals to alleviate the situation within a month. As {{a result of this}} meeting the NKAP ordered the Lavochkin, Sukhoi, Yakovlev and Mikoyan-Gurevich design bureaux (OKBs) to develop and build jet aircraft with the utmost dispatch. Aware of earlier problems encountered with other novel propulsion systems such as ramjets both Sukhoi and Mikoyan-Gurevich chose to use the VRDK booster engine that had been under development since 1942.|$|E
