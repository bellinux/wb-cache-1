An additional reason could be Mieszko's desire to remove from power the influential pagan priest class, who may have been blocking his efforts to establish a more centralized rule.|$|E
25|$|With minor rearrangements {{over the}} years, the 1935 reforms have ruled the Texas Rangers' {{organization}} until present day. Hiring new members, {{which had been}} largely <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>decision,</b> was achieved {{through a series of}} examinations and merit evaluations. Promotion relied on seniority and performance in the line of duty. More sophisticated means of crime fighting were put at their disposal, like automobiles, advanced weaponry and forensics. By the late 1930s, the Rangers had one of the best crime labs in the United States at the Headquarters Division in Austin. The appointment of Colonel Homer Garrison in September 1938 as director of the DPS proved decisive as well. Under his leadership, many respected captains such as Manuel T. Gonzaullas worked extensively to restore the good name of the force that had been compromised in the previous decades, keeping it in line with its traditions within a modern and civilized society and regaining its high status. The number of commissioned officers grew and the Rangers developed a clear detective function, while the Highway Patrol took charge of direct law enforcement duties.|$|E
25|$|It was <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>decision</b> {{to deprive}} local {{authorities}} {{of the resources}} needed to provide an adequate service. Local authority budgets have been cut by 40% {{as a result of}} the 2010 austerity budget of the Conservative Coalition Government, and the fire service cuts have resulted in 11,000 fewer firefighters. The building inspection regime is under pressure as mandatory competition between Local Authority Building Control and private approved inspectors was introduced to drive down costs. This impacts on quality. Local authority budget cuts have led to fewer building control inspectors and fewer planning inspectors and also the recommendations of a coroner’s report into the Lakanal House tower block fire in Southwark in 2009 has not been acted on nor have building regulations been overhauled. The responsibility for fire safety checks had been switched from the fire brigade onto building owners for similar cost cutting reasons, by the previous Blair government. Southwark council was fined £570,000 for fire safety offences following the 2009 Lakanal House fire, where six people died. Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn brought this to the attention of the House. He said these “terrible consequences of deregulation and cutting corners” stemmed from a “disregard for working-class communities”.|$|E

25|$|Football {{has been}} played in Magdeburg {{since the end}} of the 19th century. On 15 June 1896 SV Victoria 96 Magdeburg was founded, a club that had its best days before World War II, when it participated in the German {{championship}} finals on several occasions. Later the club participated in the Gauliga Mitte. After World War II, all sports clubs in the Soviet Occupation Zone were dissolved and a number of smaller clubs were created, which at first competed at a local and regional level. In 1945 players from the disbanded clubs Magdeburger SC Prussia 1899 and Cricket Viktoria Magdeburg formed Sportgruppe (SG) Sudenburg. This club and SG Lemsdorf came together as the sports club BSG Eintracht Sudenburg, which in turn merged with SAG Krupp Gruson in 1950. The next year the club was renamed BSG Stahl Magdeburg, and then in 1952, became BSG Motor Mitte Magdeburg in 1952. In 1957 the football department of Motor Mitte was moved to SC Aufbau Magdeburg, <b>a</b> <b>political</b> <b>decision</b> with the goal of achieving higher standards of performance. In 1965, the football department was again broken out of SC Aufbau and a football-only club was created, 1. FC Magdeburg. This was part of a general– again politically motivated– movement in East Germany towards football-only clubs with the goal of achieving higher standards. 1. FC Magdeburg is the oldest of the football clubs created in this period.|$|E
