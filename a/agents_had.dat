5|$|The CIA {{finished}} processing {{documents on}} September 28, 1954. By this point, the <b>agents</b> <b>had</b> parsed {{through more than}} 500,000 unique documents. 750 photographs of this material were published {{for the use of}} the media, 50,000 documents were microfilmed, and photostatic copies were taken of 2095 important documents. Copies of a handful of important documents were distributed to the varies agencies that had been a part of PBHistory, as well as the US Federal Bureau of Investigation.|$|E
5|$|By September 1954, the PBHistory <b>agents</b> <b>had</b> only {{managed to}} find {{a small number of}} top secret {{documents}}. Some of the documents gathered showed that government officials and communist party leaders had been able to dispose of most of the sensitive material before they left. In the period of uncertain leadership that followed Árbenz's overthrow and preceded Castillo Armas' taking power, a member of one of the ruling juntas had prevented the Comité from searching the homes of private citizens, and from arresting them, which potentially reduced the number of sensitive documents the CIA had access to. Additionally, Castillo Armas stated after taking power that the intelligence information of the army had been completely destroyed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the meeting}} Tecumseh warned Harrison {{that he would}} seek an {{alliance}} with the British if hostilities broke out. Tensions between the United States and Britain had been high for several months {{as a result of}} British interference in U.S. commerce with France. As early as 1810, British <b>agents</b> <b>had</b> sought to secure an alliance with Native Americans to assist in the defense of Canada should hostilities break out, but the Natives had been reluctant to accept their offer, fearing they had little to benefit from such an arrangement.|$|E
5000|$|Intentions: Intentions {{represent}} the deliberative {{state of the}} agent - what the <b>agent</b> <b>has</b> chosen to do.

40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} a multi-agent scenario with K ≥ 2 <b>agents</b> that <b>have</b> partial information about some random nature state, and that take actions in a repeated manner. Each <b>agent</b> also <b>has</b> imperfect {{observations of the}} other agents' past actions and the nature state realization. Our goal is to characterize the set of asymptotically implementable distributions on the agents' actions and the nature state. We solve this problem for general K when all <b>agents</b> <b>have</b> only causal nature state information (NSI) and for K = 2 when: one <b>agent</b> <b>has</b> causal NSI and the other <b>agent</b> <b>has</b> non-causal NSI; or in some special cases when both <b>agents</b> <b>have</b> non-causal NSI...|$|R

5|$|According to Brackman, {{several days}} after the robbery the Okhrana agent Mukhtarov {{questioned}} Stalin in a secret apartment. The <b>agents</b> <b>had</b> heard rumors that Stalin had been seen watching passively during the robbery. Mukhtarov asked Stalin why he had not informed them about it, and Stalin stated that he had provided adequate information to the authorities to prevent the theft. The questioning escalated into a heated argument; Mukhtarov hit Stalin {{in the face and}} had to be restrained by other Okhrana officers. After this incident, Mukhtarov was suspended from the Okhrana, and Stalin was ordered to leave Tiflis and go to Baku to await a decision in the case. Stalin left Baku with 20,000rubles in stolen money in July 1907. While Brackman claims to have found evidence of this incident, whether Stalin cooperated with the Okhrana during his early life has been a subject of debate among historians for many decades and has yet to be resolved.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Diệm regime in a coup on 1 November 1963, Đặng Sỹ faced a trial held under a {{government}} led by Nguyễn Khánh. Some of the accusations were that Sy's men had fired on the crowd and crushed the victims with armoured cars, or that the grenades had been launched at his orders and caused the deaths. Sy later reportedly revealed that Archbishop Thục had personally given him the order to shoot the Buddhists but refused to testify against Thục, who was by that time living in exile in Rome. Sy was sentenced to life imprisonment and ordered to compensate the victims' families. His lawyer contended that the court had been unable to establish the nature and source of the lethal explosions. The Defense Minister, General Trần Thiện Khiêm, a Catholic who had helped Khánh in his January 1964 coup, later claimed Khánh had rigged the trial to gain Quang's support, and released Sy from prison; Sy later emigrated to the United States. In 1970, the Saigon-based Catholic newspaper, Hòa Bình ran a story claiming that CIA <b>agents</b> <b>had</b> used a secret new explosive to foment trouble for Diệm's regime whose relations with the United States were deteriorating.|$|E
5|$|Many of Oppenheimer's {{associates}} in {{the years}} before World War II were Communist Party USA members. They included his wife Kitty, whose first husband Joe Dallet had been killed fighting with the Lincoln Battalion in the Spanish Civil War; his brother Frank Oppenheimer and Frank's wife Jackie; and his girlfriend Jean Tatlock. One of his Communist associates was a colleague at the University of California, an assistant professor of French literature named Haakon Chevalier. The two had met during a rally for Spanish Loyalists, and had co-founded a branch of the American Federation of Teachers at Berkeley known as Local 349. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had opened a file on Oppenheimer in March 1941, after he had attended a December 1940 meeting at Chevalier's home that was also attended by the Communist Party's California state secretary William Schneiderman and its treasurer Isaac Folkoff, both of whom were targets of FBI surveillance and wiretaps. <b>Agents</b> <b>had</b> recorded the license plate of Oppenheimer's car. The FBI noted that Oppenheimer was on the Executive Committee of the American Civil Liberties Union, which it considered a Communist front. Shortly thereafter, the FBI added Oppenheimer to its Custodial Detention Index, for arrest in case of national emergency.|$|E
30|$|It can be {{observed}} from the comparison that, with an increasing quantity of neighbors, {{the ability of the}} uninformed agents to identify information improves. The more neighbors that one uninformed <b>agent</b> <b>has,</b> the earlier that agent will reach an equilibrium. Figure  2 shows that when one uninformed <b>agent</b> <b>has</b> only 2 neighbors, it takes him 1000 periods or even longer to achieve an equilibrium to identify honest informed agents from the dishonest agents, while when an uninformed <b>agent</b> <b>has</b> 6 or more neighbors, he can quickly reach equilibrium. If an uninformed <b>agent</b> <b>has</b> more information sources, he can identify the honest sources more efficiently and precisely through the confidence parameter.|$|R

5|$|The loyalists {{reached the}} home of Ma Tuyen in the Chinese {{business}} district of Cholon. Ma Tuyen was a Chinese merchant and friend who {{was reported to be}} Nhu's main contact with the Chinese syndicates which controlled the opium trade. The brothers sought asylum from the embassy of the Republic of China, but were turned down and stayed in Ma Tuyen's house as they appealed to ARVN loyalists and attempted to negotiate with the coup leaders. Nhu's secret <b>agents</b> <b>had</b> fitted the home with a direct phone line to the palace, so the insurgent generals believed that the brothers were still besieged inside Gia Long. Neither the rebels nor the loyalist Presidential Guard had any idea that at 21:00 they were about to fight for an empty building. Minh was reported to be mortified when he realised that Diệm and Nhu had escaped during the night.|$|E
5|$|This crisis had {{its roots}} in the Great Powers' {{competition}} for colonies in the last decades of the 19th century. The German Empire, invigorated by its victory over France in the Franco-Prussian War and by its unification under the Prussian monarchy, had newfound imperial ambitions that stretched beyond Europe. It had shared in the division of Africa, and in the 1880s looked to the Pacific as well. Ships of its Imperial Navy were sent to Apia in Samoa, where German <b>agents</b> <b>had</b> fomented rebellion against the indigenous government. They were countered there by the Asiatic Squadron of the United States Navy. The United States had nearly completed establishing control over its territories on the North American continent, leading American ambitions to stretch beyond its shores. The squadron was at Samoa to assert US interests in the Pacific and to watch the Germans.|$|E
