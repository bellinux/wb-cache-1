5|$|Film {{director}} Barry Levinson {{sought to}} create a police drama television series based on , a 1991 non-fiction book by David Simon based on one year he spent with Baltimore Police Department homicide detectives. In addition to the book's being set in Levinson's home city of Baltimore, the director was attracted to the realistic way Simon portrayed police work and the detectives. The book contradicted many popular myths that had been built into past police dramas: it portrayed the detectives as not <b>always</b> <b>getting</b> along {{with each other and}} told stories of criminals who were not always caught or punished. It also portrayed detectives as solving cases primarily through physical evidence, witnesses and confessions, not by investigating motives like on many other police shows. Simon also sought to dispel the popular television perception that all detectives take their cases very personally and identify with their victims: in Simon's experience, homicide cases were primarily a job to the detectives, not personal. Levinson and Tom Fontana, who had past television experience as executive producer on the drama series St. Elsewhere, hired screenwriter Paul Attanasio to adapt elements of the book into the teleplay for the first episode. It was the first television script Attanasio ever wrote.|$|E

25|$|It {{was very}} slow and {{therefore}} a most impressive assault with steel. At times the tanks almost 'stood on their heads', twisting to avoid mounds of rock and to get {{at right angles to}} the huge cracks and shell holes, but <b>always</b> <b>getting</b> nearer and nearer. Like beetles trying to climb an inverted ice-cream cone, they slipped a little, hung suspended and then went onwards towards the top. The behaviour of these tanks upset the Germans. Such tactics were untanklike, and no answer was contained in their military textbooks. Too late now to shift the anti-tank guns from their positions, too late to make alternative arrangements to deal with the new menace. There was only one answer – retreat, and that's what the Germans did – leaving the British tanks and infantry in possession of the first slope up the heights of Longstop. So ended 23 April.|$|E
500|$|During {{her early}} {{appearances}} on the show, Billie Jenkins {{is identified as}} the Charmed Ones' protégée. Cuoco viewed Billie as a [...] "little sister" [...] to the Halliwell sisters, and attributed her as [...] "very naive and <b>always</b> <b>getting</b> in trouble". She described the character's wardrobe as [...] "cute and fun", and felt that it matched her own personal style. When discussing the casting process, Cuoco stated that Billie's initial characterization was based solely on her physical appearance, explained, [...] "I think they just wanted a blonde on the show". Co-executive producer James L. Conway believed Billie's identity as a novice witch added a new dynamic to the show, while Pam Shae called the character [...] "demanding", [...] "spunky", and [...] "very, very confident" [...] despite her inexperience with magic. Keri Blakinger of New York Daily News felt that Billie developed into a [...] "powerful witch in her own right" [...] {{over the course of}} the season.|$|E
500|$|Maine Representative Nelson Dingley Jr. was McKinley's {{choice for}} Secretary of the Treasury; he {{declined}} it, preferring {{to remain as}} chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Charles Dawes, who had been Hanna's lieutenant in Chicago during the campaign, was considered for the Treasury post but by some accounts Dawes considered himself too young. Dawes eventually became Comptroller of the Currency; he recorded in his published diary that he had strongly urged McKinley to appoint as secretary the successful candidate, Lyman J. Gage, president of the First National Bank of Chicago and a Gold Democrat. The Navy Department was offered to former Massachusetts Congressman John Davis Long, an old friend from the House, on January 30, 1897. Although McKinley was initially inclined to allow Long to choose his own assistant, there was considerable pressure on the President-elect to appoint Theodore Roosevelt, head of the New York City Police Commission and a published naval historian. McKinley was reluctant, stating to one Roosevelt booster, [...] "I want peace and I am told that your friend Theodore is <b>always</b> <b>getting</b> into rows with everybody." [...] Nevertheless, he made the appointment.|$|E

500|$|In {{the first}} month of 2015–16, Donaldson {{provided}} four assists for teammates but did not score himself. At home to Bristol City on 12 September 2015, he completed a first-half hat-trick; the match ended 4–2. His fifth goal of the season came in a 5–2 away win against Fulham on 7 November 2015, the last match before he made his international debut for Jamaica. He returned with a groin injury that was predicted to keep him out for six weeks. Rowett suggested the damage could have been less serious had Donaldson not played the whole match despite being obviously unfit, but Jamaica coach Winfried Schäfer denied the accusations, stating that he had wanted to substitute Donaldson but the player insisted on continuing. He returned to first-team action on 26 December 2015, as a late substitute with Birmingham already 3–0 down at Sheffield Wednesday, and remained in the starting eleven thereafter, although it took some time for his rhythm and form to return. Donaldson was also used on the left wing in support of loan striker Kyle Lafferty. He said he enjoyed that position [...] "because strikers are <b>always</b> <b>getting</b> battered and from there you can sneak in unopposed", although it had not gone as well for him this season as he had hoped. By the end of the season, which he finished as the club's top scorer with 11 goals from 40 league appearances as well as contributing 7 assists, he claimed to be [...] "back to [...] normal self".|$|E
500|$|The {{end of the}} war {{marked the}} start of the 1945 cricket season. Miller {{returned}} to Lord's and top-scored with 50 for the RAAF against a British Empire XI, as his team opened the season with a six-wicket win. Warner had organised a series of matches between England and Australian servicemen, known as the Victory Tests, to celebrate the end of hostilities. However, Australian cricket administrators would not accredit the three-day matches as official Test matches, arguing that there were not enough Test-level players in the armed services. England were close to full strength, so the AIF and the RAAF teams merged to strengthen their quality. As a result, the Australian Services cricket team was formed under the leadership of Warrant Officer Lindsay Hassett to compete in the Victory Tests. Hassett was the only capped Test player, but six others had first-class experience in Australia. The First Victory Test was at Lord's and was expected to usher in a new post-war era, which it hoped would be more aggressive and attractive. The last Anglo-Australian Test series before the war had featured a large number of draws due to defensive play. England batted first and Miller came on as the fifth bowler. He bowled his Great Massingham pilot colleague Bill Edrich for 45 to end with 1/11, precipitating an English collapse from 4/200 to 267. In reply to England's 267, Miller came to the crease at 3/136 and joined Hassett. Miller gradually progressed, and once Australia had taken the lead, he cut loose. After spending 40 minutes in the 90s, he finished with 105 in 210 minutes, with a straight six. The Times opined that his innings was [...] "as good a century as has been seen at Lord's in many a long day". Wisden said that he [...] "was <b>always</b> <b>getting</b> runs with the soundness characteristic of most Australians". Harry Altham declared that [...] "a brilliant new star had joined the cluster of the Southern Cross". Australia took a 188-run lead, and reached their second innings target with two balls to spare to win by six wickets despite Miller being run out for only one. He then took 2/2 and made a duck as the RAAF lost to the RAF by 16 runs in a one-day match.|$|E

As such, the book feels at times like a movie, and sometimes more specifically, a snuff film. New technology such as photo manipulation software (e.g. [...] "PhotoSoap for Windows 95") are featured in the novel. This creates an ironic situation in which Victor, the character obsessed by appearances, is haunted by fake images that appear real which implicate him in a murder; it becomes {{hard to tell what}} is real in the 'modern' world.

2500|$|Jimmy Durante {{is known}} to most modern audiences as the {{character}} who narrated and sang the 1969 animated special Frosty the Snowman. He also performed the Ron Goodwin title song to the 1968 comedy-adventure Monte Carlo or Bust (titled Those Daring Young Men in Their Jaunty Jalopies in the U.S.) sung over the film's animated opening credits. There are numerous Durante depictions and allusions in animation. Pumbaa does a brief Durante impression while singing [...] "Hakuna Matata" [...] in The Lion King. A character in M-G-M cartoons, a bulldog named Spike, whose puppy son was <b>always</b> <b>getting</b> caught by accident {{in the middle of}} Tom and Jerry's activities, referenced Durante with a raspy voice and an affectionate [...] "Dat's my boy!" [...] In another Tom and Jerry short, a starfish lands on Tom's head, giving him a big nose. He then proceeds with Durante's famous [...] "Ha-cha-cha-cha" [...] call. The 1943 Tex Avery cartoon [...] "What's Buzzin' Buzzard" [...] featured a vulture with a voice that sounded like Jimmy Durante. A Durante-like voice (originally by Doug Young) was also given to the father beagle, Doggie Daddy, in Hanna-Barbera's Augie Doggie and Doggie Daddy cartoons, Doggie Daddy invariably addressing the junior beagle with a Durante-like [...] "Augie, my son, my son", and with frequent citations of, [...] "That's my boy who said that!" [...] The 1945 MGM cartoon Jerky Turkey featured a turkey which was a caricature of Durante.|$|E

2500|$|One of Gabriel's early ideas was for Pocahontas's {{mother to}} be {{embodied}} {{in a certain}} star in the sky {{that by the end}} of the film, she would help Pocahontas find her path to Smith. However, The Lion King had concurrently carried a similar idea of the ancestors giving wisdom and guidance to the protagonist so the idea was discarded. Michael Eisner pushed for Pocahontas to have a mother, lamenting that [...] "We're <b>always</b> <b>getting</b> fried for having no mothers." [...] The writers countered that Powhatan was polygamous and formed dynastic alliances among other neighboring tribes by impregnating a local squaw and giving away the child, so it was believed that Pocahontas herself probably didn't see her mother that much. [...] "Well", Eisner conceded, [...] "I guess that means we're toasted." [...] Ultimately, her mother's spirit would become the swirling wind that occurs throughout the film. For the villain, they chose John Ratcliffe, whose portrayal was based on actual English captains, including John Martin, Christopher Newport and Edward Maria Wingfield. In reality, it was Wingfield who despised John Smith, but the filmmakers preferred the sinister sound of [...] "Ratcliffe". The writers would continue to adapt actual events into the film such as Pocahontas warning Smith that the Indians were after him so he could escape in the middle of the night, Powhatan ordering the captured Smith to make bead necklaces to humiliate him, and Pocahontas being captured by Ratcliffe (instead of Samuel Argall), though none of them worked with the story.|$|E
2500|$|George {{was named}} after his mother's elder brother, King George I of Greece. As an infant, he was {{stronger}} and healthier than his brother Nicholas. He {{could be described as}} a typical Romanov. George was tall, unlike his elder brother Nicholas, handsome and full of fun. He was <b>always</b> <b>getting</b> into mischief and, because his mother had a great weakness for him, getting away with it. Like his siblings, he was brought up in a spartan fashion in the English manner. They slept on camp beds, rose at six and took a cold bath, although occasionally they were allowed to take a warm bath in their mother's bathroom. Breakfast was usually porridge and black bread; mutton cutlets or roast beef with peas and baked potatoes were served for lunch; bread, butter and jam at tea-time. Cake was a special treat. Nicholas and George had a sitting-room, dining-room, play-room and bedroom, all simply furnished. The only trace of ostentation was an icon surrounded by pearls and precious stones. George's mother taught him that family life was important. Because of his parents' happy marriage, he was brought up in an atmosphere of love and security missing in many royal households. On 27 May 1883, George's parents were crowned in a magnificent ceremony in the Uspensky Cathedral in the Kremlin in Moscow. The Emperor and Empress received the homage of the Imperial Family, including their sons, Nicholas and George, both in uniform. It was a major occasion {{in the life of the}} young Grand Duke. The family lived mostly in the security of the palace at Gatchina.|$|E
2500|$|On August 7, 2001, the APEC {{report was}} issued by Judge Ted Hughes, which cleared Chrétien of wrongdoing, but stated that Jean Carle of the PMO had {{improperly}} pressured the RCMP {{to attack the}} protesters. Hughes concluded that the RCMP had used excessive force that was {{in violation of the}} Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Hughes ruled that the use of force by the RCMP had gone beyond the legitimate security need to protect the visiting leaders at the APEC summit, and was intended to silence the protests altogether, which thus violated the right to freedom of expression guaranteed to all Canadians by the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Judge Hughes accused Carle of [...] "throwing his weight around" [...] and attempting to interfere with security arrangements. Lawrence Martin expressed some skepticism about Judge Hughes's report, asking if were really possible for Carle, who was Chrétien's chief of operations at the PMO in 1997 and was someone who was especially close to Chrétien, to be directing the RCMP to attack protesters without the Prime Minister knowing. One Liberal later recalled about the Carle-Chrétien relationship that: [...] "I don't know why Chrétien kept a guy like him around. He was <b>always</b> <b>getting</b> him in trouble". Shortly after the Hughes report was issued, Carle became chief of operations at the Just for Laughs comedy festival in Montreal, which promptly received a doubling of federal sponsorship money by the Public Works ministry headed by Alfonso Gagliano, and then a rare retroactive grant of $100,000. Chrétien and Gagliano both denied that Carle's presence {{had anything to do with}} the increased grants. In December 2001, the RMCP raided the home of François Beaudoin to investigate alleged wrongdoing that Beaudoin was said to have committed during his time as president of the Business Development Bank of Canada, which the opposition charged was part of an attempt to intimidate Beaudoin for suing for wrongful dismissal. The Solicitor General Lawrence MacAulay rejected claims that government was pursuing a vendetta against Beaudoin, and accused opposition members of trying to smear the RCMP.|$|E

2500|$|Margaret Wade — a freckled, red-haired, bespectacled know-it-all whose cloying and self-important {{demeanor}} is <b>always</b> <b>getting</b> on Dennis' nerves. She is {{attracted to}} Dennis and is stubbornly {{confident in the}} belief that she will marry him when they are adults, but he clearly has no interest in her. She always tries to improve Dennis and his manners, but only succeeds in annoying him. She has a certain amount of dislike for Gina, whom she sees as her competition. Gina gains Dennis' respect and admiration by just being herself, and Margaret's pretensions fail to make a mark on him. Margaret, who is two years older than Dennis, is very ambitious: when she was five she decided to join the Camp Fire Girls when she reaches the age of seven; and in one comic sells Girl Scout Cookies to the Mitchells {Especially Dennis!} she likes taking ballet, singing Christmas carols, and taking piano lessons; she is a devout—if conventional—religious believer, and has a pet of her own—a white Persian cat named Snowflake (which does tricks on command). Besides hoping to marry Dennis, she also has decided to be the first female President of the United States. A running gag is that whenever Margaret tries to be genuinely nice to Dennis—such as inviting him over to her house to help decorate a Christmas tree, or to be a guest at her birthday party, or when Dennis tries to have Margaret give him too much candy-Dennis [...] "helpfulness" [...] results in him being sent home! One weakness of Dennis is that no matter how much he dislikes Margaret, he can't resist eating food at the Wades'. Margaret and Dennis are not always adversaries: one time Dennis sprayed both Margaret and Gina with his mother's perfume with a water pistol-which resulted in both girls playing with him and Dennis' mother becoming very angry with him! During one April Fool comic Dennis decided to trick Margaret with compliments instead of pranks; to Dennis' horror, Margaret accepted the joke as real and dragged poor Dennis to hear her piano playing.|$|E
