25|$|These are diodes that {{conduct in}} the reverse {{direction}} when the reverse bias voltage exceeds the breakdown voltage. These are electrically {{very similar to}} Zener diodes (and are often mistakenly called Zener diodes), but break down by a different mechanism: the avalanche effect. This occurs when the reverse electric field applied across the p–n junction causes a wave of ionization, reminiscent of an avalanche, leading to a large current. Avalanche diodes are designed to break down at a well-defined reverse voltage without being destroyed. The difference between the <b>avalanche</b> <b>diode</b> (which has a reverse breakdown above about 6.2V) and the Zener is that the channel length of the former exceeds the mean free path of the electrons, resulting in many collisions between them on {{the way through the}} channel. The only practical difference between the two types is they have temperature coefficients of opposite polarities.|$|E
2500|$|For smaller photon fluxes, the {{photomultiplier}} can {{be operated}} in photon-counting, or Geiger, mode (see also Single-photon <b>avalanche</b> <b>diode).</b> In Geiger mode the photomultiplier gain is set so high (using high voltage) {{that a single}} photo-electron resulting from a single photon incident on the primary surface generates a very large current at the output circuit. However, owing to the avalanche of current, a reset of the photomultiplier is required. In either case, the photomultiplier can detect individual photons. The drawback, however, is that not every photon incident on the primary surface is counted either because of less-than-perfect efficiency of the photomultiplier, or because a second photon can arrive at the photomultiplier during the [...] "dead time" [...] associated with a first photon and never be noticed.|$|E
2500|$|At {{very large}} reverse bias, beyond the {{peak inverse voltage}} or PIV, a process called reverse {{breakdown}} occurs that causes a large increase in current (i.e., {{a large number of}} electrons and holes are created at, and move away from the p–n junction) that usually damages the device permanently. The <b>avalanche</b> <b>diode</b> is deliberately designed for use in that manner. In the Zener diode, the concept of PIV is not applicable. A Zener diode contains a heavily doped p–n junction allowing electrons to tunnel from the valence band of the p-type material to the conduction band of the n-type material, such that the reverse voltage is [...] "clamped" [...] to a known value (called the Zener voltage), and avalanche does not occur. Both devices, however, do have a limit to the maximum current and power they can withstand in the clamped reverse-voltage region. Also, following the end of forward conduction in any diode, there is reverse current for a short time. The device does not attain its full blocking capability until the reverse current ceases.|$|E

50|$|In electronics, an <b>avalanche</b> <b>diode</b> is a diode (made from silicon {{or other}} semiconductor) that is {{designed}} to experience avalanche breakdown at a specified reverse bias voltage. The junction of an <b>avalanche</b> <b>diode</b> is designed to prevent current concentration and resulting hot spots, so that the diode is undamaged by the breakdown. The avalanche breakdown is due to minority carriers accelerated enough to create ionization in the crystal lattice, producing more carriers which in turn create more ionization. Because the avalanche breakdown is uniform across the whole junction, the breakdown voltage is nearly constant with changing current when compared to a non-avalanche diode.|$|E
50|$|The Zener diode {{exhibits}} {{an apparently}} similar effect {{in addition to}} Zener breakdown. Both effects are actually present in any such diode, but one usually dominates the other. <b>Avalanche</b> <b>diodes</b> are optimized for avalanche effect so they exhibit small but significant voltage drop under breakdown conditions, unlike Zener diodes that always maintain a voltage higher than breakdown. This feature provides better surge protection than simple Zener diode and acts more like a gas discharge tube replacement. <b>Avalanche</b> <b>diodes</b> have a small positive temperature coefficient of voltage, where diodes relying on the Zener effect have a negative temperature coefficient.|$|R
25|$|These are <b>avalanche</b> <b>diodes</b> {{designed}} specifically to protect other semiconductor devices from high-voltage transients.

50|$|<b>Avalanche</b> <b>diodes</b> {{can replace}} a spark gap for stage {{voltages}} less than 500 volts. The charge carriers easily leave the electrodes, so no extra ionisation is needed and jitter is low. The diodes {{also have a}} longer lifetime than spark gaps.|$|R

50|$|A single-photon <b>avalanche</b> <b>diode</b> (SPAD)(also {{known as}} a Geiger-mode APD or G-APD) is a {{solid-state}} photodetector in which a photon-generated carrier can trigger an avalanche current due to the impact ionization mechanism. This device is able to detect low-intensity signals (down to the single photon) and to signal the arrival times of the photons with a jitter of a few tens of picoseconds.|$|E
50|$|For {{sensitive}} electronics, excessive current can flow if this voltage spike exceeds a material's breakdown voltage, or if {{it causes}} avalanche breakdown. In semiconductor junctions, excessive electric current may destroy or severely weaken that device. An <b>avalanche</b> <b>diode,</b> transient voltage suppression diode, transil, varistor, overvoltage crowbar, or a range of other overvoltage protective devices can divert (shunt) this transient current thereby minimizing voltage.|$|E
50|$|A TVS diode {{is a type}} of Zener diode, {{also called}} an <b>avalanche</b> <b>diode</b> or silicon <b>avalanche</b> <b>diode</b> (SAD), which can limit voltage spikes. These {{components}} provide the fastest limiting action of protective components (theoretically in picoseconds), but have a relatively low energy absorbing capability. Voltages can be clamped to less than twice the normal operation voltage. If current impulses remain within the device ratings, life expectancy is exceptionally long. If component ratings are exceeded, the diode may fail as a permanent short circuit; in such cases, protection may remain but normal circuit operation is terminated in the case of low-power signal lines. Due to their relatively limited current capacity, TVS diodes are often restricted to circuits with smaller current spikes. TVS diodes are also used where spikes occur significantly more often than once a year, since this component will not degrade when used within its ratings. A unique type of TVS diode (trade names Transzorb or Transil) contains reversed paired series avalanche diodes for bi-polar operation.|$|E

50|$|The {{intensity}} of the signal is obtained by counting (photon counting) the number of output pulses within a measurement time slot, while the time-dependent waveform of the signal is obtained by measuring the time distribution of the output pulses (photon timing).

The term Zener diode is colloquially applied to several types of breakdown diodes, but strictly speaking Zener diodes have a breakdown voltage of below 5 volts, whilst <b>avalanche</b> <b>diodes</b> are used for breakdown voltages above that value. In practical voltage reference circuits, Zener and switching diodes are connected in series and opposite directions to balance the temperature coefficient response of the diodes to near-zero.
