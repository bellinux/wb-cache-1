(some col.) <b>Anti-arrhythmic</b> <b>agents</b> {{are known for}} their narrow therapeutic window and common side effects. Delivery of <b>anti-arrhythmic</b> <b>agents</b> into the pericardium has shown to increase their efficacy and minimize their side effects. My work has focused on evaluating the clinical potential of intrapericardial (IP) anti-arrhythmic delivery. This has included working with physicians to identify appropriate clinical applications, developing devices to aid in pericardial drug delivery, and carrying out several large animal studies to test efficacy. In swine models of sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and ischemia-induced ventricular tachycardias, we have shown the pharmacodynamic benefits of IP-delivered metoprolol, amiodarone, and docosahexaenoic acid. Pharmacokinetic data show that minimal amounts of drug reach the systemic circulation.

50|$|Depending on {{the type}} of {{cardiogenic}} shock, treatment involves infusion of fluids, or in shock refractory to fluids, inotropic medications. In case of an abnormal heart rhythm several <b>anti-arrhythmic</b> <b>agents</b> may be administered, e.g. adenosine.|$|R
50|$|Procainamide {{works as}} an <b>anti-arrhythmic</b> <b>agent</b> and is used to treat cardiac arrhythmia. It induces rapid block of the batrachotoxin (BTX)-activated sodium {{channels}} of the heart muscle and acts as antagonist to long-gating closures. The block is voltage-dependent and can occur from both sides; either from the intracellular or the extracellular side. Blocking from the extracellular side is weaker than from the intracellular side because it occurs via the hydrophobic pathway. Procainamide is present in charged form and probably requires a direct hydrophobic access to the binding site for blocking of the channel. Furthermore, blocking of the channel shows a decreased voltage sensitivity, which may result {{from the loss of}} voltage dependence of the blocking rate. Due to its charged and hydrophilic form, procainamide has its effect from the internal side, where it causes blockage of voltage-dependent, open channels. With increasing concentration of procainamide, the frequency of long blockage becomes less without the duration of blockage being affected. The rate of fast blocking is determined by the membrane depolarization. Membrane depolarization leads to increased blocking and decreased unblocking of the channels. Procainamide slows the conduction velocity and increases the refractory period, such that the maximal rate of depolarization is reduced.|$|E

Simultaneously, AZD1305 suppresses AF in a safe and efficacious manner, which could potentially be an ideal first-line treatment option in the future.|$|R

We studied the effects of propafenone, another class Ic <b>anti-arrhythmic</b> <b>agent,</b> on K currents in human atrial myocytes using a whole-cell voltage-clamp method. Propafenone inhibited both Ito and the sustained or ultra-rapid delayed rectifier K current (Isus or Ikur) evoked by depolarization pulses. The concentration for half-maximal inhibition (IC 50) was 4. 9 [*]μM for Ito and 8. 6 [*]μM for Isus. Propafenone blocked Ito and Isus in a voltage- and use-independent fashion and accelerated the inactivation time constant of Ito [from 28. 3 to 6. 7 [*]ms at 10 [*]μM propafenone]. The steady-state inactivation curve for Ito was unaffected by propafenone. Propafenone {{did not affect the}} initial current at depolarizing potentials, but it did produce a block that increased as a function of time after depolarization (time constant of 3. 4 [*]ms). This suggests that propafenone preferentially blocked Ito in the open state. Propafenone had no significant effect on the rate at which Ito recovered from inactivation at − 80 [*]mV suggesting that propafenone dissociates rapidly from the channel. The steady-state activation curve for Isus was not affected by propafenone. Propafenone slowed the time course of the onset of the Isus tail current. This suggests that propafenone blocked Isus in the open state. The present results suggest that, unlike flecainide, propafenone blocks both Ito and Isus in human atrial myocytes in the open state at clinically relevant concentrations...|$|E

40|$|Although {{amiodarone}} {{is regarded}} as a highly effective <b>anti-arrhythmic</b> <b>agent,</b> its use may lead to alterations in thyroid gland function and/or thyroid hormone metabolism, partly because of its rich iodine content. Patients treated with amiodarone may manifest altered thyroid hormone profile without thyroid dysfunction, or they may present with clinically significant amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism or amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis. The former results from the inability of the thyroid to escape from the Wolff-Chaikoff effect. It prevails in areas with high dietary iodine intake, and it is readily managed by discontinuation of amiodarone or thyroid hormone replacement. Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis occurs more frequently in areas with low iodine intake; it may arise from iodine-induced excessive thyroid hormone synthesis (type I) or destructive thyroiditis with release of preformed hormones (type II). Type I should be treated with thionamides alone or in combination with potassium perchlorate, whereas type II benefits from treatment with glucocorticoids.

40|$|AbstractOne {{day after}} {{ligation}} of the canine anterior descending coronary artery, clofilium, a long-acting class III <b>anti-arrhythmic</b> <b>agent,</b> was studied for {{its effects on}} normal and ischemic Purkinje fibers. In normal Tyrode's solution (4 mMpotassium, 2. 7 mMcalcium) clofilium (10 − 7 to 10 − 5 M) increased action potential duration. Although only 2 of 10 normal Purkinje fibers developed early afterdepolarizations and early afterdepolarization-initiated triggered activity, 10 of 11 ischemic Purkinje fibers developed these features. Consequently, action potentials in ischemic fibers were prolonged to durations > 10 s. The triggered activity in the ischemic Purkinje fibers produced repetitive activity in adjacent normal ventricular muscle. In vivo, 3 days after ligation, the administration of 3 to 10 mg/kg clofilium induced grouped beating. Action potentials recorded subsequently from these same hearts in vitro showed early afterdepolarizations, triggered activity and a similar grouping of responses. Therefore, clofilium differentially produced early afterdepolarizations in ischemic Purkinje fibers. This is a mechanism by which clofilium could be arrhythmogenic in an ischemic heart...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe QT {{interval}} on {{the human}} electrocardiogram is normally {{in the order of}} 450 ms, and reflects the summated durations of action potential (AP) depolarization and repolarization of ventricular myocytes.

Convulsions were induced by phentylenetetrazole (PTZ) (100 mg/kg) or caffeine (300 mg/kg) in mice. In both models, amiodarone prolonged both latency period and time to death, and acted as an anticonvulsant drug.

In a subsequent study, they also observed 20  % cFPD prolongation in hESC-CMs at sotalol concentration of 10  µM (Braam et al. 2013). Our study resulted in similar data. At concentrations of 6 – 10  µM, we observed a cFPD prolongation of 12 – 18  % in the hESC-CMs, increasing to 21  % at 19  µM. We observed that sotalol increased cFPD {{in all the}} CMs at the therapeutical concentration range (1.6 – 9.7  µM). In line with our data, Mehta et al.

Furthermore, according to our data sotalol significantly increased cFPD at earlier concentrations in LQT-CMs than in WTa or WTb. This may suggest that LQT-CMs may be more vulnerable to the cFPD-prolonging effect of sotalol than hiPSC-derived control cells.|$|E

50|$|In electrocardiography, {{during a}} cardiac cycle, once an action {{potential}} is initiated, {{there is a}} period of time that a new action potential cannot be initiated. This is termed the effective refractory period (ERP) of the tissue. This period is approximately equal to the absolute refractory period (ARP), it occurs because the fast sodium channels remain closed until the cell fully repolarizes.During this period, depolarization on adjacent cardiac muscles does not produce a new depolarization in the current cell as it has to refract back to phase 4 of the action potential before a new action potential can activate it. ERP acts as a protective mechanism and keeps the heart rate in check and prevents arrhythmias, and it helps coordinates muscle contraction. <b>Anti-arrhythmic</b> <b>agents</b> used for arrhythmias usually prolong the ERP. For the treatment of atrial fibrillation, it is a problem that the prolongation of the ERP by these agents also affects the ventricles, which can induce other types of arrhythmias.|$|R
