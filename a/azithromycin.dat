5|$|X-ray {{diffraction}} {{was used}} for the identification of antibiotic drugs such as: eight β-lactam (ampicillin sodium, penicillin G procaine, cefalexin, ampicillin trihydrate, benzathine penicillin, benzylpenicillin sodium, cefotaxime sodium, Ceftriaxone sodium), three tetracycline (doxycycline hydrochloride, oxytetracycline dehydrate, tetracycline hydrochloride) and two macrolide (<b>azithromycin,</b> erythromycin estolate) antibiotic drugs. Each of these drugs has a unique XRD pattern that makes their identification possible.|$|E
5|$|Antibiotics are {{not usually}} used for gastroenteritis, {{although}} they are sometimes recommended if symptoms are particularly severe or if a susceptible bacterial cause is isolated or suspected. If antibiotics are to be employed, a macrolide (such as <b>azithromycin)</b> is preferred over a fluoroquinolone due to higher rates {{of resistance to the}} latter. Pseudomembranous colitis, usually caused by antibiotic use, is managed by discontinuing the causative agent and treating it with either metronidazole or vancomycin. Bacteria and protozoans that are amenable to treatment include Shigella Salmonella typhi, and Giardia species. In those with Giardia species or Entamoeba histolytica, tinidazole treatment is recommended and superior to metronidazole. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of antibiotics in young children who have both bloody diarrhea and fever.|$|E
5|$|Topical {{antibiotics}} deemed safe {{during pregnancy}} include clindamycin, erythromycin, and metronidazole (all category B), due to negligible systemic absorption. Nadifloxacin and dapsone (category C) are other topical antibiotics {{that may be}} used to treat acne in pregnant women, but have received less study. No adverse fetal events have been reported from the topical use of dapsone. If retinoids are used there is a high risk of abnormalities occurring in the developing fetus; women of childbearing age are therefore required to use effective birth control if retinoids are used to treat acne. Oral antibiotics deemed safe for pregnancy (all category B) include <b>azithromycin,</b> cephalosporins, and penicillins. Tetracyclines (category D) are contraindicated during pregnancy as they are known to deposit in developing fetal teeth, resulting in yellow discoloration and thinned tooth enamel. Their use during pregnancy has been associated with development of acute fatty liver of pregnancy and is further avoided for this reason.|$|E
25|$|A team of {{researchers}} at the pharmaceutical company Pliva—Gabrijela Kobrehel, Gorjana Radobolja-Lazarevski, and Zrinka Tamburašev, led by Dr. Slobodan Đokić—discovered <b>azithromycin</b> in 1980. It was patented in 1981. In 1986, Pliva and Pfizer signed a licensing agreement, which gave Pfizer exclusive rights {{for the sale of}} <b>azithromycin</b> in Western Europe and the United States. Pliva put its <b>azithromycin</b> on the market in Central and Eastern Europe under the brand name Sumamed in 1988. Pfizer launched <b>azithromycin</b> under Pliva's license in other markets under the brand name Zithromax in 1991.|$|E
25|$|A {{strain of}} gonorrhea {{reported}} to be highly resistant to <b>azithromycin</b> {{was found in the}} population in 2015. Neisseria gonorrhoeae is normally susceptible to <b>azithromycin,</b> but the drug is not widely used as monotherapy due to a low barrier to resistance development.|$|E
25|$|In {{combination}} with ceftriaxone, <b>azithromycin</b> {{is part of}} the United States Centers for Disease Control-recommended regimen for the treatment of gonorrhea. <b>Azithromycin</b> is active as monotherapy in most cases, but the {{combination with}} ceftriaxone is recommended based on the relatively low barrier to resistance development in gonococci.|$|E
25|$|Some {{authorities}} {{recommend the}} use of <b>azithromycin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Following {{a single}} dose of 500mg, the {{apparent}} terminal elimination half-life of <b>azithromycin</b> is 68 hours. Biliary excretion of <b>azithromycin,</b> predominantly unchanged, {{is a major}} route of elimination. Over {{the course of a}} week, about 6% of the administered dose appears as unchanged drug in urine.|$|E
25|$|As of 2010, {{injectable}} ceftriaxone {{is one of}} the few effective antibiotics. This {{is typically}} given in combination with either <b>azithromycin</b> or doxycycline. As of 2015 and 2016 the CDC and WHO only recommends both ceftriaxone and <b>azithromycin.</b> Because of increasing rates of antibiotic resistance local susceptibility patterns must be taken into account when deciding on treatment.|$|E
25|$|<b>Azithromycin</b> is an acid-stable antibiotic, {{so it can}} {{be taken}} orally with no need of {{protection}} from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed, but absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration (Tmax) in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to its high concentration in phagocytes, <b>azithromycin</b> is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations are released. The concentration of <b>azithromycin</b> in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma due to ion trapping and its high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days.|$|E
25|$|Antibiotics improve {{outcomes}} {{in those who}} are both severely and not severely dehydrated. <b>Azithromycin</b> and tetracycline may work better than doxycycline or ciprofloxacin.|$|E
25|$|High-risk {{exposure}} such as {{that which}} occurs in rape cases may be treated preventatively using antibiotic combinations such as <b>azithromycin,</b> cefixime, and metronidazole.|$|E
25|$|Zithromax (<b>azithromycin),</b> a {{macrolide}} antibiotic that {{is recommended}} by the Infectious Disease Society of America as a first line treatment for certain cases of community-acquired pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|There is no vaccine. Prevention {{depends on}} good {{maintenance}} of water systems. Treatment of Legionnaires' disease is with antibiotics. Recommended agents include fluoroquinolones, <b>azithromycin,</b> or doxycycline.|$|E
25|$|Bartonella spp. are {{commonly}} treated with antibiotics including <b>azithromycin,</b> {{based on a}} single small randomized clinical trial. Treatment may take up to one year to completely eliminate the disease.|$|E
25|$|Acute {{otitis media}} caused by H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis or S. pneumoniae. <b>Azithromycin</b> is not, however, a {{first-line}} agent for this condition. Amoxicillin or another beta lactam antibiotic is generally preferred.|$|E
25|$|Occasionally, {{patients}} have developed cholestatic hepatitis or delirium. Accidental intravenous overdose in an infant caused severe heart block, resulting in residual encephalopathy. Clostridium difficile {{has been reported}} with use of <b>azithromycin.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2010, <b>azithromycin</b> was {{the most}} {{prescribed}} antibiotic for outpatients in the US, whereas in Sweden where outpatient antibiotic use is a third as prevalent, macrolides are only on 3% of prescriptions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Azithromycin</b> {{prevents}} bacteria {{from growing}} by interfering with their protein synthesis. It binds to the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, thus inhibiting translation of mRNA. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected.|$|E
25|$|Common {{antibiotic}} treatments include: tetracycline (doxycycline) (all tetracyclines, including doxycycline, are contraindicated {{during pregnancy}} and in children due to effects on bone development and tooth discoloration), and erythromycin. <b>Azithromycin</b> {{is also a}} drug of choice in LGV.|$|E
25|$|The {{antibiotics}} erythromycin, clarithromycin, or <b>azithromycin</b> {{are typically}} the recommended treatment. Newer macrolides are frequently recommended due to {{lower rates of}} side effects. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) {{may be used in}} those with allergies to first-line agents or in infants who have a risk of pyloric stenosis from macrolides.|$|E
25|$|Hospitalized {{patients}} {{without risk}} for pseudomonas: This group requires intravenous antibiotics, with a quinolone active against streptococcus pneumoniae (such as levofloxacin), a β-lactam antibiotic (such as cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ampicillin/sulbactam or high-dose ampicillin plus a macrolide antibiotic (such as <b>azithromycin</b> or clarithromycin) for seven to ten days.|$|E
25|$|While not curable, {{treatment}} usually improves symptoms. Treatment {{is typically}} with metronidazole, doxycycline, or tetracycline. When {{the eyes are}} affected <b>azithromycin</b> eye drops may help. Other treatments with tentative benefit include brimonidine cream, ivermectin cream, and isotretinoin. Dermabrasion or laser surgery may also be used. The use of sunscreen is typically recommended.|$|E
25|$|Therapy {{for older}} {{children}} and adults generally includes treatment for atypical bacteria: typically a macrolide antibiotic (such as <b>azithromycin</b> or clarithromycin) or a quinolone, such as levofloxacin. Doxycycline is the antibiotic of choice in the UK for atypical bacteria, due to increased clostridium difficile colitis in hospital patients linked to {{the increased use of}} clarithromycin.|$|E
25|$|Healthy outpatients {{without risk}} factors: This group (the largest) is {{composed}} of otherwise-healthy patients without risk factors for DRSP, enteric gram-negative bacteria, pseudomonas or other, less-common, causes of CAP. Primary microoganisms are viruses, atypical bacteria, penicillin-sensitive streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae. Recommended drugs are macrolide antibiotics, such as <b>azithromycin</b> or clarithromycin, for seven to ten days.|$|E
25|$|The company {{develops}} {{and produces}} medicines and vaccines {{for a wide}} range of medical disciplines, including immunology, oncology, cardiology, diabetology/endocrinology, and neurology. Its products include the blockbuster drug Lipitor (atorvastatin), used to lower LDL blood cholesterol; Lyrica (pregabalin) for neuropathic pain/fibromyalgia; Diflucan (fluconazole), an oral antifungal medication; Zithromax (<b>azithromycin),</b> an antibiotic; Viagra (sildenafil) for erectile dysfunction; and Celebrex/Celebra (celecoxib), an anti-inflammatory drug.|$|E
25|$|Antibiotics by mouth such as {{ciprofloxacin}} or <b>azithromycin</b> {{are given}} to help prevent infection or to control ongoing infection. The aminoglycoside antibiotics (e.g. tobramycin) used can cause hearing loss, damage to the balance system in the inner ear or kidney failure with long-term use. To prevent these side-effects, the amount of antibiotics in the blood is routinely measured and adjusted accordingly.|$|E
25|$|Common {{side effects}} include nausea, vomiting, {{diarrhea}} and upset stomach. An allergic reaction or {{a type of}} diarrhea caused by Clostridium difficile is possible. No harm has been found with its use during pregnancy. Its safety during breastfeeding is not confirmed, but it is likely safe. <b>Azithromycin</b> is an azalide, a type of macrolide antibiotic. It works by decreasing the production of protein, thus stopping bacterial growth.|$|E
25|$|<b>Azithromycin</b> is an {{antibiotic}} {{useful for the}} treatment of a number of bacterial infections. This includes middle ear infections, strep throat, pneumonia, traveler's diarrhea, and certain other intestinal infections. It may also be used for a number of sexually transmitted infections including chlamydia and gonorrhea infections. Along with other medications, it may also be used for malaria. It can be taken by mouth or intravenously with doses once per day.|$|E
25|$|Gonorrhea can be {{prevented}} {{with the use of}} condoms, having sex with only one person who is uninfected, and by not having sex. Treatment is usually with ceftriaxone by injection and <b>azithromycin</b> by mouth. Resistance has developed to many previously used antibiotics and higher doses of ceftriaxone are occasionally required. Retesting is recommended three months after treatment. Sexual partners from the last 2 months should also be treated.|$|E
25|$|Intensive-care {{patients}} {{at risk for}} pseudomonas aeruginosa: These patients require antibiotics targeting this difficult-to-eradicate bacterium. One regimen is an intravenous antipseudomonal beta-lactam such as cefepime, imipenem, meropenem or piperacillin/tazobactam, plus an IV antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone such as levofloxacin. Another is an IV antipseudomonal beta-lactam such as cefepime, imipenem, meropenem or piperacillin/tazobactam, plus an aminoglycoside such as gentamicin or tobramycin, plus a macrolide (such as <b>azithromycin)</b> or a nonpseudomonal fluoroquinolone such as ciprofloxacin.|$|E
25|$|<b>Azithromycin</b> {{was first}} made in 1980. It {{is on the}} World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most {{effective}} and safe medicines needed in a health system. It is available as a generic medication and is sold under many trade names worldwide. The wholesale cost in the developing world is about 0.18 to 2.98 USD per dose. In the United States it is about 33 USD for a course of treatment.|$|E
25|$|Outpatients with {{underlying}} {{illness or}} risk factors: Although this group {{does not require}} hospitalization, patients have underlying health problems (such as emphysema or heart failure) or {{are at risk for}} DRSP or enteric gram-negative bacteria. They are treated with a quinolone active against streptococcus pneumoniae (such as levofloxacin) or a β-lactam antibiotic (such as cefpodoxime, cefuroxime, amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) and a macrolide antibiotic, such as <b>azithromycin</b> or clarithromycin, for seven to ten days.|$|E
25|$|The best {{treatment}} {{approach is}} to improve the immune status in immunodeficient individuals using highly active antiretroviral therapy that includes an HIV protease inhibitor along with continued use of antiparasitic medication. Antiparasitic drug treatment for immunocompromised individuals usually involves the combination of nitazoxanide, paromomycin, and <b>azithromycin</b> together; these drugs are only partially active in HIV/AIDS patients compared to their effect in immunocompetent persons. A Cochrane Collaboration review recommended that nitazoxanide be considered for use in treatment despite its reduced effectiveness in immunocompromised individuals.|$|E
25|$|A {{reasonable}} guideline is {{to treat}} people age >1 year within 3 weeks of cough onset and infants age <1 year and pregnant women within 6 weeks of cough onset. If the person is diagnosed late, antibiotics will not alter {{the course of the}} illness, and even without antibiotics, they should no longer be spreading pertussis. Antibiotics when used early decrease the duration of infectiousness, and thus prevent spread. Short-term antibiotics (<b>azithromycin</b> for 3–5 days) are as effective as long-term treatment (erythromycin 10–14 days) in eliminating B. pertussis with fewer and less severe side effects.|$|E
25|$|Supportive {{care must}} be {{provided}} to animals that have clinical signs. Subcutaneous or intravenous fluids are given to dehydrated animals, and severely anemic dogs may require a blood transfusion. Treatment for ehrlichiosis {{involves the use of}} antibiotics such as tetracycline or doxycycline for a period of at least six to eight weeks; response to the drugs may take one month. Treatment with macrolide antibiotics like clarithromycin and <b>azithromycin</b> is being studied. In addition, steroids may be indicated in severe cases in which the level of platelets is so low that the condition is life-threatening.|$|E
