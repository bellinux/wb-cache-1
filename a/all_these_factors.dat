5|$|Many {{distinct}} factors {{influence the}} strength of welds and the material around them, including the welding method, the amount and concentration of energy input, the weldability of the base material, filler material, and flux material, {{the design of the}} joint, and the interactions between <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>factors.</b> To test the quality of a weld, either destructive or nondestructive testing methods are commonly used to verify that welds are free of defects, have acceptable levels of residual stresses and distortion, and have acceptable heat-affected zone (HAZ) properties. Types of welding defects include cracks, distortion, gas inclusions (porosity), non-metallic inclusions, lack of fusion, incomplete penetration, lamellar tearing, and undercutting.|$|E
5|$|Quest left South Georgia on 18 January, heading {{south-east}} {{towards the}} South Sandwich Islands. There {{was a heavy}} swell, such that the overladen ship frequently dipped its gunwales below the waves, filling the waist with water. As they proceeded, Wild wrote that Quest rolled like a log, leaked and required regular pumping, was heavy on coal consumption, and was slow. <b>All</b> <b>these</b> <b>factors</b> led him to change his plan {{at the end of}} January. Bouvet Island was abandoned in favour of a more southerly course that brought them {{to the edge of the}} pack ice on 4 February.|$|E
5|$|Various biographers have {{proposed}} that Darwin avoided or delayed making his ideas public for personal reasons. Reasons suggested have included fear of religious persecution or social disgrace if his views were revealed, and concern about upsetting his clergymen naturalist friends or his pious wife Emma. Charles Darwin's illness caused repeated delays. His paper on Glen Roy had proved embarrassingly wrong, {{and he may have}} wanted to be sure he was correct. David Quammen has suggested <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>factors</b> may have contributed, and notes Darwin's large output of books and busy family life during that time.|$|E

5|$|A weary Emperor who {{no longer}} cared for the throne, an heir who {{had no desire to}} assume the crown, an {{increasingly}} discontented ruling class who were dismissive of the Imperial role in national affairs: <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>factors</b> presaged the monarchy's impending doom. The means to achieve the overthrow of the Imperial system would soon appear within the Army ranks. Republicanism had never flourished in Brazil outside of certain elitist circles, and had little support in the provinces. A growing combination of republican and Positivist ideals among the army's junior and mid-level officer ranks, however, began to form a serious threat to the monarchy. These officers favored a republican dictatorship, which they believed would be superior to the liberal democratic monarchy. Beginning with small acts of insubordination {{at the beginning of the}} 1880s, discontent in the army grew in scope and audacity during the decade, as the Emperor was uninterested and the politicians proved incapable of re-establishing the government's authority over the military.|$|E
5|$|Substantial {{structural}} changes {{took place on}} January12: frontal boundaries separated from {{the core of the}} cyclone; convection developed atop the circulation; and it acquired a weak warm-core. <b>All</b> <b>these</b> <b>factors,</b> alongside the system being co-located with an upper-level low, indicated its transition into a subtropical cyclone by 18:00UTC. Upon doing so, the system received the name Alex. Though relatively shallow, owing to the seasonally low level of the tropopause, convection was deemed deep enough for classification. At this time, the subtropical storm was situated 1,150mi (1,850km) west-southwest of the Canary Islands. The trough that previously enabled the sharp southward turn later steered Alex to the east-northeast and later north-northeast. Operationally, Alex was not classified as a subtropical storm until late on January13.|$|E

25|$|The {{layout of}} the {{intersection}} is very poor for trucks making this turn, and the congestion <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>factors</b> create has been forcing more drivers to resort to side streets, the village believes, since traffic counts have been going up on 52 and 208 but down on the concurrency.

25|$|By {{the time}} <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>factors</b> had had {{their effect on}} the {{valuation}} of the confiscated assets, very little was left. In total, NOK 7.8 million was awarded to principals and heirs of Jewish property confiscated by the Nazis. This was less than the administrative fees charged by governmental agencies for probate. It did not include assets seized by the government that belonged to non-Norwegian citizens, and that of citizens that left no legal heirs. This last category was formidable, as 230 entire Jewish households were killed {{during the course of}} the Shoah.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to traditional methods, advanced demand modeling methods sense the expected impact of different decisions, understand {{the distinction between}} sales channels, anticipate {{the impact of the}} decisions, and create a unified view of the demand. For example, if the demand for a certain product is expected to increase by 5% due to a line extension, decrease by 2% due to a reduction in selling space and increase by 1% due to pricing decisions, the demand modeling engine takes <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>factors</b> into account in calculating the demand.|$|E

5000|$|In 1960, Wilson and Osborne {{outlined}} six {{factors that}} could affect compensatory growth in a review article. The importance of each, some, or <b>all</b> of <b>these</b> <b>factors</b> is not well understood. <b>These</b> <b>factors</b> are as follows: ...|$|R
25|$|<b>All</b> <b>these</b> <b>factors</b> {{have contributed}} to low crop yields and poverty in rural areas. Further, after the 1979 {{revolution}} many agricultural workers claimed ownership rights and forcibly occupied large, privately owned farms {{where they had been}} employed. The legal disputes that arose from this situation remained unresolved through the 1980s, and many owners put off making large capital investments that would have improved farm productivity, further deteriorating production. Progressive government efforts and incentives during the 1990s, however, improved agricultural productivity marginally, helping Iran toward its goal of reestablishing national self-sufficiency in food production.|$|E
25|$|Since 1991 the {{situation}} changed radically, in concern of studying it at secondary {{and high school}} as a general subject. In practice, almost at all educational institutions the process of teaching was performed in Armenian, even at Russian departments of colleges and universities. Thus, the Russian language lost its statute of a second mother tongue and was classified as a foreign language. <b>All</b> <b>these</b> <b>factors</b> brought forth changes of the language functioning structure in real time conditions. The absolute number of students of the Russian language was significantly decreased.|$|E
25|$|The Indian {{soldiers}} {{considered the}} fortification, and the artillery being primed, as a threat. On {{the night of}} 2 June 1857, a British officer named Lieutenant Cox fired on his Indian guard while drunk. Cox missed his target, and was thrown into the jail for a night. The very next day, a hastily convened court acquitted him, which led to discontent among the Indian soldiers. There were also rumours that the Indian troops were to be summoned to a parade, where {{they were to be}} massacred. <b>All</b> <b>these</b> <b>factors</b> influenced them to rebel against the East India Company rule.|$|E

25|$|In the 6th century Byzantine Emperor Justinian {{attempted}} to reassert imperial {{authority in the}} territories of the Western Roman Empire. In the resulting Gothic War (535‚Äì554) waged against the Ostrogothic Kingdom, Byzantine hopes of an early and easy triumph evolved into a long war of attrition that resulted in mass dislocation of population and destruction of property. Problems were further exacerbated by widespread famine (538‚Äì542) and a devastating plague pandemic (541‚Äì542). Although the Byzantine Empire eventually prevailed, the triumph {{proved to be a}} pyrrhic victory, as <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>factors</b> caused the population of the Italian Peninsula to crash, leaving the conquered territories severely underpopulated and impoverished.|$|E
25|$|Structural {{walls were}} lowered {{dramatically}} during the war, especially informal policies against hiring women, minorities, and workers over 45 or under 18. (See FEPC) Strikes (except in coal mining) were sharply reduced as unions pushed their members to work harder. Tens {{of thousands of}} new factories and shipyards were built, with new bus services and nursery care for children making them more accessible. Wages soared for workers, making it quite expensive to sit at home. Employers retooled so that unskilled new workers could handle jobs that previously required skills that were now in short supply. The combination of <b>all</b> <b>these</b> <b>factors</b> drove unemployment below 2% in 1943.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{the problem}} of the commons is also glaringly visible in this matter. Open access to {{resources}} leads to no incentive to conserve stocks, and actors which try to conserve lose out compared to the others when it comes to maximizing economic output. Therefore, there appeared to be a lack of concern by tribes of the First Nations about the sustainability of the fur trade. The problem of over-exploitation is not helped {{by the fact that the}} efforts by the French to remove the middlemen such as the Huron who increasingly resented their influence meant that stocks were put under more pressure. <b>All</b> <b>these</b> <b>factors</b> contributed to an unsustainable trade pattern in furs which depleted beaver stocks very fast.|$|E
