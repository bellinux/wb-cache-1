5|$|Ueshiba's senior {{students}} have {{different approaches to}} aikido, depending partly on when they studied with him. Today aikido is found {{all over the world}} in a number of styles, with broad ranges of interpretation and emphasis. However, they all share techniques formulated by Ueshiba <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>have</b> concern for the well-being of the attacker.|$|E
5|$|Complementary therapies {{have been}} {{investigated}} for treating people with acne. Low-quality evidence suggests topical application of tea tree oil or bee venom may reduce {{the total number of}} skin lesions in those with acne. Tea tree oil is thought to be approximately as effective as benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid, but has been associated with allergic contact dermatitis. Proposed mechanisms for tea tree oil's anti-acne effects include antibacterial action against P. acnes, and anti-inflammatory properties. Numerous other plant-derived therapies have been observed to have positive effects against acne (e.g., basil oil and oligosaccharides from seaweed); however, few studies have been performed, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>have</b> been of lower methodological quality. There is a lack of high-quality evidence for the use of acupuncture, herbal medicine, or cupping therapy for acne.|$|E
5|$|Each {{building}} at MIT {{has a number}} (possibly preceded by a W, N, E, or NW) designation <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>have</b> a name as well. Typically, academic and office buildings are referred to primarily by number while residence halls are referred to by name. The organization of building numbers roughly corresponds to {{the order in which}} the buildings were built and their location relative (north, west, and east) to the original center cluster of Maclaurin buildings. Many of the buildings are connected above ground as well as through an extensive network of underground tunnels, providing protection from the Cambridge weather as well as a venue for roof and tunnel hacking.|$|E

5|$|Each {{chemical}} element {{has a unique}} atomic number (Z) representing the number of protons in its nucleus. Most elements have differing numbers of neutrons among different atoms, with these variants being referred to as isotopes. For example, carbon has three naturally occurring isotopes: all of its atoms have six protons <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>have</b> six neutrons as well, but about one per cent have seven neutrons, and a very small fraction have eight neutrons. Isotopes are never separated in the periodic table; they are always grouped together under a single element. Elements with no stable isotopes have the atomic masses of their most stable isotopes, where such masses are shown, listed in parentheses.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{buildings}} on Mackinac Island are built of wood, a few are of stone, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>have</b> clapboard siding. The architectural styles on the island span 300 years, from the earliest Native American structures to the styles of the 19th century. The earliest structures were built by the Anishinaabe and Ojibwe (Chippewa) tribes before European exploration. At least two buildings still exist from the original French settlement in the late 18th century. Mackinac Island has the only example of northern French rustic architecture in the United States, and one of few survivors in North America.|$|E
5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} lanthanum {{is made up}} of two isotopes, {{the stable}} 139La and the primordial long-lived radioisotope 138La. 139La {{is by far the most}} abundant, making up 99.910% of natural lanthanum: it is produced in the s-process (slow neutron capture, which occurs in low- to medium-mass stars) and the r-process (rapid neutron capture, which occurs in core-collapse supernovae). The very rare isotope 138La is one of the few primordial odd-odd nuclei, with a long half-life of 1.05×1011years: it is one of the proton-rich p-nuclei which cannot be produced in the s- or r-processes. 138La, along with the even rarer 180mTa, is produced in the ν-process, where neutrinos interact with stable nuclei. All other lanthanum isotopes are synthetic: with the exception of 137La with a half-life of about 60,000years, all of them have half-lives less than a day, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>have</b> half-lives less than a minute. The isotopes 139La and 140La occur as fission products of uranium.|$|E

50|$|All FX range {{trucks were}} fitted with MAN's modular {{military}} cab <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>had</b> a conventionally positioned engine. The cooling pack, and for certain applications (heavy tractor trucks for example) the engine, was located behind the cab.|$|R
5|$|No multituberculates {{are known}} to have had hypsodont teeth, none has more than two molariform (molar-like) teeth in a single toothrow, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>have</b> large, blade-like teeth. However, the form of the remains of TNM02067's third cheektooth {{suggests}} it was not such a blade-like tooth and that at least the last three cheekteeth were likely molariform. In these respects, TNM02067 does resemble gondwanatheres in the family Sudamericidae, and Krause and colleagues tentatively identified it as representing that family, primarily {{on the basis of its}} hypsodont teeth. Krause and colleagues compared the dentary in detail to that of Sudamerica, the only other gondwanathere for which a substantial fragment of the jaw was known. Sudamerica has only four, not five, cheekteeth (all of which are molariform), a higher, narrower incisor with a root that extends further through the dentary, and a shorter diastema; in all these respects, TNM02067 is more primitive. In addition, the mental foramen of the TNM02067 is located lower and the cheekteeth vary more in size.|$|E
5|$|Since the country's {{reconstitution}} and recognised independence as Zimbabwe in 1980, Robert Mugabe's {{administration has}} pulled down many monuments and plaques making {{reference to the}} fallen of the First and Second World Wars, perceiving them as reminders of white minority rule and colonialism that go against what the modern state stands for. This view is partly rooted in the association of these memorials with those commemorating the British South Africa Company's dead of the Matabele Wars, {{as well as those}} memorialising members of the Rhodesian Security Forces killed during the Bush War of the 1970s. Many Zimbabweans today see their nation's involvement in the World Wars as a consequence of colonial rule that {{had more to do with}} the white community than the indigenous black majority, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>have</b> little interest in its contributions to those conflicts.|$|E
5|$|The Kuiper belt {{is a great}} ring {{of debris}} similar to the {{asteroid}} belt, but consisting mainly of objects composed primarily of ice. It extends between 30 and 50AU from the Sun. Though it is estimated to contain anything from dozens to thousands of dwarf planets, it is composed mainly of small Solar System bodies. Many of the larger Kuiper belt objects, such as Quaoar, Varuna, and Orcus, {{may prove to be}} dwarf planets with further data. There are estimated to be over 100,000 Kuiper belt objects with a diameter greater than 50km, but the total mass of the Kuiper belt is thought to be only a tenth or even a hundredth the mass of Earth. Many Kuiper belt objects have multiple satellites, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>have</b> orbits that take them outside the plane of the ecliptic.|$|E

2500|$|The Series IIA FC {{launched}} in 1962 {{was based on}} the Series IIA 2.25-litre petrol engine and [...] chassis, with the cab positioned over the engine to give more load space. Export vehicles were the first Land-Rovers to get the 2.6-litre petrol engine. <b>Most</b> examples <b>had</b> an ENV (heavy duty) rear axle, a matching front axle came later. Tyres were large 900×16 types on deep-dish wheel rims to spread the ground weight of this heavy vehicle.

5|$|The tablets {{were written}} in Akkadian, and they give {{information}} about the kingdom, its customs, {{and the names of}} people who lived during that time. More than 3000 are letters, the remainder includes administrative, economic, and judicial texts. Almost all the tablets found were dated to the last 50years of Mari's independence (c. 1800 – 1750BC), <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>have</b> now been published. The language of the texts is official Akkadian but proper names and hints in syntax show that the common language of Mari's inhabitants was Northwest Semitic.|$|E
5|$|The {{water pipit}} has a {{complete}} moult between July and September, {{although there is}} considerable individual variation in timing. There is a partial pre-breeding moult, mainly between January and March, but with much variability in timing. This moult typically involves replacing the head, body and some wing feathers, but the extent is again variable. Very occasionally, females may moult into what looks like non-breeding plumage, rather than the expected brighter garb. The chicks start to gain juvenile plumage {{as soon as a}} month after hatching, <b>and</b> <b>most</b> <b>have</b> completed the transition to near-adult appearance by September. The first pre-breeding moult {{is similar to that of}} the adult, but may be less complete or even absent.|$|E
