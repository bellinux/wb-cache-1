40|$|A novel {{miniaturized}} <b>amperometric</b> <b>analyzer</b> with {{enhanced performance}} {{was developed to}} meet the need of field-portable, wide adaptable, user friendly, and cost effective electrochemical detection in various application fields. Based on the new MSP 430 FG 479 microcontroller, the embedded system was designed to either operate as a stand-alone unit with an on-board fool-proof user interface, or run on the user's PC for advanced data analysis. Amperometric detection is a powerful experimental approach for the study of electro-active compounds with clinical, industrial, environmental and agricultural importance. Inside the <b>amperometric</b> <b>analyzer,</b> a mini-potentiostat is designed to interface with a wide spectrum of electrochemical sensors. Implemented with grounded-auxillary electrode configuration, the mini-potentiostat controls oxidationreduction reactions of target analytes at the working electrode surface by accurately maintaining a preset potential between the working (WE) and the reference electrode (RE), while measuring the redox current response at the auxillary electrode (AE) using a low-side resistive sensing mechanism. In an unstirred solution, at steady state, the rate of electron transfer is directly proportional to the concentration of the reactant. Therefore, the steady state current is used as an accurate measure of the analyte concentration in the sample. Constructed using off-the-shelf IC chips and powered by a single 3 V lithium coin cell battery, the potentiostat circuitry inside the <b>amperometric</b> <b>analyzer</b> is designed to meet potential control and current detection requirements for most existing electrochemical sensors. Featured with sub-picoampere sensitive, wide span and high accuracy current sensing, the specially designed current sensing block not only covers general application requirements, but it can also serve as a powerful tool in research efforts toward the next generation of ultra-sensitive detection systems in biomolecular sensing. In addition to the superior electrochemical related specifications, various lowpower design techniques have been applied to ensure a prolonged battery life, therefore making the system an ideal platform for amperometric monitoring in field appropriate applications. Confirmed with a systematic evaluation of the device prototype, the system features a 4 -month battery life with a single 3 V lithium battery (220 mAh), accurate bidirectional redox potential control from - 1. 2 V to + 1. 2 V, high resolution current detection from ± 5 pA to ± 1 mA covered by 4 software selectable detection levels, improved stability unaffected by electrochemical sensor impedance, and high EMI immunity without external shielding. Finally, electrochemical analyses were also conducted using the device prototype. For a constant potential amperometric experiment, the experimental results of the system were compared with a standard bench top electrochemical workstation (the BAS Epsilon). Excellent agreement was attained over the whole detection range, which demonstrates the excellent potential control and current sensing abilities of the <b>amperometric</b> <b>analyzer...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{prototype of}} a microcomputer-based analyzer {{was developed for}} quantitative determination of formaldehyde in liquid samples, based on catalytic chemosensing elements. It was shown that selectivity for the target analyte could be increased by modulating the working electrode potential. Analytical parameters of three variants of the <b>amperometric</b> <b>analyzer</b> that differed in the chemical structure/configuration of the working electrode were studied. The constructed analyzer was tested on wastewater solutions that contained formaldehyde. A simple low-cost biosensor was developed for semi-quantitative detection of airborne formaldehyde in concentrations exceeding the threshold level. This biosensor {{is based on a}} change in the color of a solution that contains a mixture of alcohol oxidase from the yeast Hansenula polymorpha, horseradish peroxidase and a chromogen, following exposure to airborne formaldehyde. The solution is enclosed within a membrane device, which is permeable to formaldehyde vapors. The most efficient and sensitive biosensor for detecting formaldehyde was the one that contained alcohol oxidase with an activity of 1. 2 U·mL− 1. The biosensor requires no special instrumentation and enables rapid visual detection of airborne formaldehyde at concentrations, which are hazardous to human health...|$|E
40|$|In this research, we {{developed}} a portable, three-electrode electrochemical <b>amperometric</b> <b>analyzer</b> that can transmit data to a PC or a tablet via Bluetooth communication. We performed experiments using an indium tin oxide (ITO) glass electrode to confirm the performance and reliability of the analyzer. The proposed analyzer uses a current-to-voltage (I/V) converter to convert the current generated by the reduction-oxidation (redox) reaction of the buffer solution to a voltage signal. This signal is then digitized by the processor. The configuration of the power and ground of the printed circuit board (PCB) layer is divided into digital and analog parts to minimize the noise interference of each part. The proposed analyzer occupies an area of 5. 9 × 3. 25 cm 2 with a current resolution of 0. 4 nA. A potential of 0 ~ 2. 1 V can be applied between the working and the counter electrodes. The {{results of this study}} showed the accuracy of the proposed analyzer by measuring the Ruthenium(III) chloride (Ru III) concentration in 10 mM phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution with a pH of 7. 4. The measured data can be transmitted to a PC or a mobile such as a smartphone or a tablet PC using the included Bluetooth module. The proposed analyzer uses a 3. 7 V, 120 mAh lithium polymer battery and can be operated for 60 min when fully charged, including data processing and wireless communication...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{development}} and use of analysis tools to monitor brain injury patients. For this purpose, an online <b>amperometric</b> <b>analyzer</b> of cerebral microdialysis samples for glucose and lactate has been developed and optimized within the Boutelle group. The initial aim of this thesis was to significantly improve the signal-to-noise ratio and limit of detection of the assay to allow reliable quantification of the analytical data. The first approach was to re-design the electronic instrumentation of the assay. Printed-circuit boards were fabricated and proved very low noise, stable and much smaller than the previous potentiostats. The second approach was to develop generic data processing algorithms to remove three complex types of noise that commonly contaminate analytical signals: spikes, non-stationary ripples and baseline drift. The general strategy consisted in identifying the types of noise, characterising them, and subsequently subtracting them from the otherwise unprocessed data set. Spikes were effectively removed with 96. 8 % success and ripples were removed with minimal distortion of the signal resulting in an increased signal-to-noise ratio by up to 250 %. This allowed reliable quantification of traces from ten patients monitored with the online microdialysis assay. Ninety-six spontaneous metabolic events in response to spreading depolarizations were resolved. These were characterized by a fall in glucose by - 32. 0 μM and a rise in lactate by + 23. 1 μM (median values) for over a 20 -minute time-period. With frequently repeating events, this led to a progressive depletion of brain glucose. Finally, to improve the temporal coupling between the metabolic data and the electro-cortical signals, a flow-cell was engineered to integrate a potassium selective electrode into the microdialysate flow stream. With good stability over hours of continuous use and a 90 % response time of 65 seconds, this flow cell was used for preliminary in vivo experiments the Max Planck Institute in Cologne.
