The US Navy sent its control system and diffused lighting fittings to Canada's NRC, which installed it on the corvettes HMCS Edmundston and HMCS Rimouski in 1943 and carried out further prototyping.|$|E
5|$|Much {{criticism}} {{focused on}} the role of human error in the collision; once the engineer had forgotten (or missed) the approach signal there was no <b>automatic</b> <b>system</b> to prevent the collision. The NTSB noted that had a positive train control system been in place on the Metropolitan Subdivision the collision would have been less likely: the system would have detected MARC #286's unauthorized speed and stopped the train. The NTSB also strongly criticized CSX and the Federal Transit Administration for the removal of a signal between Kensington and Georgetown Junction as part of capacity improvements on the Metropolitan Subdivision. The NTSB argued that having this signal after Kensington would have reduced the likelihood of the sort of human error which caused the crash, and in the NTSB's view CSX and the FTA did not properly assess the effects of removing the signal.|$|E
5|$|Today, the Alaska Volcano Observatory {{monitors}} {{activity at}} Mount Cleveland using satellite imagery. Cloud cover often obscures the volcano, which makes many events difficult to follow. In addition, the low {{resolution of the}} satellite imagery allows minor events, which do not make an impression on the satellite picture, to pass unnoticed. There are no seismic or geophysical instruments on the mountain (the nearest are in Nikolski), and some eruptions are first observed by pilots flying over the volcano. A field {{study was conducted in}} late 2001, and an <b>automatic</b> <b>system</b> based on thermal anomalies was implemented following eruptive events in 2005. In recent years the Alaska Volcano Observatory has made an effort to expand volcanic coverage westward along the Aleutian Arc.|$|E

25|$|The {{essential}} element of this <b>automatic</b> <b>system</b> is a lever arm attached to a mass in the centre-fuselage, which is connected with the pitch controls. The moment generated by the mass is arranged to reach an equilibrium condition with the pitch control forces at each flight condition, with the flaps moving to a high lift coefficient position at low speeds or {{when there is a}} high pitch control load, and vice versa, maintaining the optimum angle of attack for the aerofoil. The <b>automatic</b> <b>system</b> on the Mü28 is identical in operation with the aircraft inverted, due to the use of a symmetrical section aerofoil set at zero degrees incidence, with the <b>automatic</b> <b>system</b> only turned off for takeoff and landing, and over-ridden manually as desired by the pilot.|$|E

25|$|In France, many {{telephone}} exchanges were closed at night {{but it was}} still possible to make emergency calls. An operator had to connect the emergency calls only.

25|$|In {{a further}} near-accident, a Trident 2E, G-AVFH, {{climbing}} away from London Heathrow for Naples in May 1970 experienced what was claimed by its flight crew {{to have been}} a spontaneous uncommanded retraction of the leading-edge slats which was initially unnoticed by any of them. The aircraft's automatic systems sensed the loss of airspeed and lift and issued two stall warnings. Since the crew did not initially detect anything amiss, they disabled the <b>automatic</b> <b>system.</b> While doing so, the first officer noted and immediately remedied the problem by re-extending the retracted slats, and the flight continued normally.|$|E

There were a total of ten antennas on the course that once an electronic marker in a canoer's bib approaches an antenna, it triggered video camera and timing controls. These course antennas were located at the start line, the finish line, and eight points in between. This system was used as video feed for the championships.

25|$|The SM-liiga {{formerly}} had {{a system}} of automatic promotion and relegation in place between itself and the Mestis, the second highest level of competition in Finland, but the <b>automatic</b> <b>system</b> was ended in 2000. The league was opened in 2005 and allowed KalPa to get a promotion. In 2009 a new system was introduced and it includes the last placed SM-liiga team facing the Mestis champion in a best of seven playout series. In 2013, the relegation system was abandoned again and replaced by a procedure in which successful clubs of Mestis may apply for a promotion if they fulfill definite financial criteria. Since 2013, Jokerit joined the KHL and Espoo Blues went bankrupt, but Sport, KooKoo and Jukurit were promoted. Therefore Liiga is a competition of 15 teams in the 2016-17 and 2017-18 seasons.|$|E
25|$|In 2009 Super League was {{expanded}} to 14 teams, with two additional teams being promoted from National League One.

National Leagues One and Two were then rebranded as the Championship and Championship 1 respectively, with the change being implemented in time for the 2009 season. Championship 1 was later rebranded to League 1. During this period, a system of licensing was put in place which meant there was no <b>automatic</b> <b>system</b> of promotion and relegation between the Championship and Super League, although promotion and relegation continued between the Championship and League 1. Widnes Vikings were promoted to Super League from the Championship via the licensing system in 2011.|$|E
