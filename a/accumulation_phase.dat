Most CML cells are sensitive to IFN-α; however, its biological effects on leukaemic cells are incompletely characterized. Here, we provide evidence that IFN-α induces {{a significant increase in the}} S phase population in human CML leukaemic cell line, K 562, and that the S <b>phase</b> <b>accumulation</b> was augmented by sodium butyrate. In contrast, neither sodium butyrate alone, nor sodium butyrate plus IFN-γ, affected the cell cycle in K 562 cells. These data suggest that the effect of sodium butyrate depended upon IFN-α-mediated signalling. The ability of leukaemic cells to exhibit the S <b>phase</b> <b>accumulation</b> after stimulation by IFN-α plus sodium butyrate correlated well with persistent tyrosine phosphorylation of cdc 2, whereas treatment with IFN-γ plus sodium butyrate did not affect its phosphorylation levels. Considering that dephosphorylation of cdc 2 leads to entry to the M phase, the persistent tyrosine phosphorylation of cdc 2 may be associated with the S <b>phase</b> <b>accumulation</b> induced by IFN-α and sodium butyrate. In addition, another human CML leukaemic cell line, MEG- 01, also showed the S <b>phase</b> <b>accumulation</b> after stimulation with IFN-α plus sodium butyrate. Taken together, our studies reveal a novel effect of sodium butyrate on the S <b>phase</b> <b>accumulation</b> and suggest its clinical application for a combination therapy with IFN-α, leading to a great improvement of clinical effects of IFN-α against CML cells. © 1999 Cancer Research Campaig...|$|R

Eventually, the market catches on to these astute investors and a rapid price change occurs (phase 2). This occurs when trend followers and other technically oriented investors participate. This phase continues until rampant speculation occurs. At this point, the astute investors begin to distribute their holdings to the market (phase 3).|$|E

50|$|In the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, {{the growth}} of the annuity value during the <b>accumulation</b> <b>phase</b> is tax-{{deferred}}, that is, not subject to current income tax, for annuities owned by individuals. The tax deferred status of deferred annuities has led to their common usage in the United States. Under the U.S. tax code, the benefits from annuity contracts do not always have to be taken {{in the form of a}} fixed stream of payments (annuitization), and many annuity contracts are bought primarily for the tax benefits rather than to receive a fixed stream of income. If an annuity is used in a qualified pension plan or an IRA funding vehicle, then 100% of the annuity payment is taxable as current income upon distribution (because the taxpayer has no tax basis in any of the money in the annuity). It should be noted this is the same tax treatment of direct participation in a qualified pension plan (such as a 401K), again, due to the fact the taxpayer has no tax basis in any of the money in the plan. If the annuity contract is purchased with after-tax dollars, then the contract holder upon annuitization recovers his basis pro-rata in the ratio of basis divided by the expected value, according to the tax regulation Section 1.72-5. (This is commonly referred to as the exclusion ratio.) After the taxpayer has recovered all of his basis, then 100% of the payments thereafter are subject to ordinary income tax.|$|E

Therefore, the financial risk can be split into two parts: investment risk, during the <b>accumulation</b> <b>phase,</b> and annuity risk, focused at retirement. In order to limit the annuity risk — which is the risk that high annuity prices (driven by low bond yields) at retirement can lead to a lower than expected pension income — in many schemes the member has the possibility of deferring the annuitization of the accumulated fund. This possibility consists of leaving the fund invested in financial assets as in the <b>accumulation</b> <b>phase,</b> and allows for periodic withdrawals by the pensioner, until annuitization occurs (if ever).

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, which {{presents}} a simplified behavioral finance model, we incorporate regret into {{the decision-making process}} of a pension fund and derive the optimal asset allocation of a final-wealth-maximizing pension fund in the <b>accumulation</b> and decumulation <b>phases.</b> We find that the optimal allocation must be congruent in both phases {{if and only if}} the pension fund is upside regret averse. In particular, our results suggest that allocation to risky assets must increase through time in the <b>accumulation</b> and decumulation <b>phases</b> so that the pension fund can realize gains from any upsides in the risky asset market, thereby maximizing final wealth and limiting the feeling of regret ex-post. Although decisions in both phases are congruent, we find that the optimal asset allocation generally depends on wealth levels. This evidence implies that separate management of the <b>accumulation</b> and decumulation <b>phases</b> of a pension fund decreases available wealth levels and is not an optimal strategy. Keywords.

During that phase, the slope of the Amazon valley must have increased, resulting in an increase in bed load transport capacity. The subsequent sea level rise caused a backwater effect far upstream, with silting up of the Amazon valley and the tributary inflows. Former river systems changed into Ria lakes.
