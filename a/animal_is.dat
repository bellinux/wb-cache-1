5|$|As a {{side effect}} of the {{electrochemical}} processes used by neurons for signaling, brain tissue generates electric fields when it is active. When large numbers of neurons show synchronized activity, the electric fields that they generate can be large enough to detect outside the skull, using electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG). EEG recordings, along with recordings made from electrodes implanted inside the brains of animals such as rats, show that the brain of a living <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> constantly active, even during sleep. Each part of the brain shows a mixture of rhythmic and nonrhythmic activity, which may vary according to behavioral state. In mammals, the cerebral cortex tends to show large slow delta waves during sleep, faster alpha waves when the <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> awake but inattentive, and chaotic-looking irregular activity when the <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> actively engaged in a task. During an epileptic seizure, the brain's inhibitory control mechanisms fail to function and electrical activity rises to pathological levels, producing EEG traces that show large wave and spike patterns not seen in a healthy brain. Relating these population-level patterns to the computational functions of individual neurons is a major focus of current research in neurophysiology.|$|E
5|$|In {{southern}} Italy and southwestern Spain, the {{snakelocks anemone}} (Anemonia viridis) is consumed as a delicacy. The whole <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> marinated in vinegar, then coated in a batter {{similar to that}} used to make calamari and deep-fried in olive oil.|$|E
5|$|The Korean zodiac is {{identical}} to the Chinese one. The Vietnamese zodiac is almost identical to Chinese zodiac except the second <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> the Water Buffalo instead of the Ox, and the fourth <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> the Cat instead of the Rabbit. The Japanese have since 1873 celebrated the beginning of the new year on 1 January as per the Gregorian Calendar. The Thai zodiac begins, not at Chinese New Year, but either {{on the first day of}} fifth month in the Thai lunar calendar, or during the Songkran festival (now celebrated every 13–15 April), depending on the purpose of the use.|$|E

50|$|Some <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> {{more likely}} to be {{targeted}} than others by human users of repellents.

5|$|Theodoxus fluviatilis is gonochoristic, {{which means}} that each {{individual}} <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> distinctly male or female, and cross-fertilization can occur. The sex ratio is 1:1.

5|$|A host of {{different}} animals, including snapping turtles, snake {{species such as}} Nerodia sipedon and Thamnophis sirtalis, muskrats, striped skunks, foxes, dogs, and raccoons prey upon the bog turtle. In addition, leeches (Placobdella multilineata and P. parasitica) and parasitic flies (Cistudinomyia cistudinis) plague some individuals, causing blood loss and weakness. Their shells offer little protection from predators. The bog turtle's main defense when threatened by an <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> to bury itself in soft mud. It rarely defends its territory or bites when approached.|$|E
5|$|Although Cuban iguanas {{typically}} remain {{still for}} long periods of time and have a slow lumbering gait due to their body mass, they are capable of quick bursts of speed for short distances. Younger animals are more arboreal and will seek refuge in trees, which they can climb with great agility. The <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> a capable swimmer and will take to nearby water if threatened. When cornered they can bite and lash their tails in defense.|$|E

30|$|Twenty-four intact male {{yearling}} Washera sheep {{with similar}} body condition and initial body weight of 18.14 [*]± 1.07  kg (mean[*]±[*]SD) were bought {{from a local}} market of Genet Abo town.

5|$|Breath-hold diving by an {{air-breathing}} <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> {{limited to}} the physiological capacity to perform the dive on the oxygen available until it returns to a source of fresh breathing gas, usually the air at the surface. As this internal oxygen supply reduces, the animal experiences an increasing urge to breathe caused by buildup {{of carbon dioxide and}} lactate in the blood, followed by loss of consciousness due to central nervous system hypoxia. If this occurs underwater, it will drown.|$|E
5|$|Campbell's dwarf hamster {{is prone}} to genetic {{abnormalities}} in the metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids. They can develop tumours of the mammary glands, lungs, uterus, and ovaries. Tumours can also develop if the <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> exposed to chemical carcinogens. Due to having slow locomotion and an insignificant response to bright lights and humans, as well as having a low population density, field studies allow scientists to study entire populations in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the name}} fisher, the <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> {{not known to}} eat fish. The name is instead related to the word fitch, meaning a European polecat (Mustela putorius) or pelt thereof, due to the {{resemblance}} to that animal. The name comes from colonial Dutch equivalent fisse or visse. In the French language, the pelt of a polecat is also called fiche or fichet.|$|E

5|$|In Bengal, animal {{sacrifice}} {{follows the}} guidelines in texts such as Mahanirvana Tantra are followed in selecting the animal, then a priest offers a prayer to the animal, then recites the Gayatri Mantra in its ear before killing it.

5|$|Most {{species have}} 12 ovules and 36 seeds, {{although}} some {{species such as}} N. bulbocodium have more, up {{to a maximum of}} 60. Seeds take five to six weeks to mature. The seeds of sections Jonquilla and Bulbocodium are wedge-shaped and matte black, while those of other sections are ovate and glossy black. A gust of wind or contact with a passing <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> sufficient to disperse the mature seeds.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses have {{a closed}} circulatory system, where the blood remains inside blood vessels. Octopuses have three hearts; a {{systemic}} heart that circulates blood round {{the body and}} two branchial hearts that pump it through {{each of the two}} gills. The systemic heart is inactive when the <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> swimming and thus it tires quickly and prefers to crawl.|$|E

5|$|The drop bear is an {{imaginary}} creature in contemporary Australian folklore featuring a predatory, carnivorous {{version of the}} koala. This hoax <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> commonly spoken about in tall tales designed to scare tourists. While koalas are typically docile herbivores, drop bears are described as unusually large and vicious marsupials that inhabit treetops and attack unsuspecting people (or other prey) that walk beneath them by dropping onto their heads from above.|$|E
5|$|The {{heart of}} a Whippet is large and slow beating, often being arrhythmic or even {{intermittent}} when the <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> at rest. This sometimes causes concern to the owner, or to the vet not experienced with the breed. Whippets will, however, demonstrate a regular heartbeat during exercise. In a health survey conducted by The Kennel Club cardiac problems were shown to be the second leading cause of mortality in Whippets.|$|E
5000|$|Germ-free <b>animals</b> <b>are</b> <b>animals</b> {{that have}} no {{microorganisms}} living in or on them.

Parasites, such as the larvae of flies and a variety of intestinal worms, also afflict the giant otter. Other causes of death include accidents, gastroenteritis, infanticide, and epileptic seizures.|$|E
5|$|The ratings also do {{not reflect}} state-specific {{population}} conditions. For instance, for the Texas horned lizard, much of eastern Texas has lost the animal. Nevertheless, based on healthy populations {{in other parts of}} the West, especially New Mexico, the IUCN rates the animal Least Concern. For the timber rattlesnake (West Virginia), the IUCN notes the animal as losing range in many parts of the northeastern U.S., but because the <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> numerous in the southern Appalachians, it is also Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The right whales' two known predators are {{humans and}} orcas. When danger lurks, {{a group of}} right whales may cluster into a circle, and thrash their outwards-pointing tails. They may also head for shallow water, which {{sometimes}} proves to be an ineffective defense. Aside from the strongly-build tails and massive heads equipping with callosities, {{the sheer size of}} this <b>animal</b> <b>is</b> its best defense, although young calves are the most vulnerable to orca and shark attacks.|$|E
