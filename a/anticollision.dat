40|$|Abstract—Tag {{identification}} {{is an important}} tool in RFID systems with applications for monitoring and tracking. A RFID reader recognizes tags through communication over a shared wireless channel. When multiple tags transmit their IDs simultaneously, the tag-to-reader signals collide and this collision disturbs a reader’s identification process. Therefore, tag collision arbitration for passive tags is a significant issue for fast identification. This paper presents two adaptive tag <b>anticollision</b> protocols: an Adaptive Query Splitting protocol (AQS), which is an improvement on the query tree protocol, and an Adaptive Binary Splitting protocol (ABS), {{which is based on}} the binary tree protocol and is a de facto standard for RFID <b>anticollision</b> protocols. To reduce collisions and identify tags efficiently, adaptive tag <b>anticollision</b> protocols use information obtained from the last process of tag identification.

40|$|Abstract—Automatic {{identification}} {{based on}} {{radio frequency identification}} (RFID) is progressively being introduced into industrial environments, enabling new applications and processes. In the context of communications, RFID rely mostly on Frame Slotted Aloha (FSA) <b>anticollision</b> protocols. Their goal {{is to reduce the}} time required to detect all the tags within range (identification time). Using FSA, the maximum identification rate is achieved when the number of contending tags equals the number of contention slots available in the frame. Therefore, the reader must estimate the number of contenders and allocate that number of slots for the next frame. This paper introduces the new MFML-DFSA <b>anticollision</b> protocol. It estimates the number of contenders by means of a maximum-likelihood estimator, which uses the statistical information from several frames (multiframe estimation) to improve the accuracy of the estimate. Based on this expected number of tags, the algorithm determines the best frame length for the next reading frame, taking into account the constraints of the EPCglobal Class- 1 Gen- 2 standard. The MFML-DFSA algorithm is compared with previous proposals and found to outperform these in terms of (lower) average identification time and computational cost, which makes it suitable for implementation in commercial RFID readers.

Different from traditional hash, image hash does not suffer from the sensitivity to minor degradations of original data because of its perceptual robustness. Such a property requires two images that are perceptually identical in human visual system (HVS) and are mapped to similar hash values. Obviously, the more robust a hash is, the less sensitive it is to large distortions upon the original images, which in turn inevitably incurs another problem that distinct images may be misclassified to the same group. Hence, tradeoff between robustness and <b>anticollision</b> of distinct images is of great concern. Additionally, by incorporating the pseudorandomization techniques, a hash is hardly obtained by unauthorized adversaries without the secret key.
