5|$|Along {{with his}} {{colleague}} Wei Pu in the Bureau of Astronomy, Shen Kuo planned to plot out the exact coordinates of planetary and lunar movements by recording their astronomical observations three times <b>a</b> <b>night</b> <b>for</b> {{a continuum of}} five years. The Song astronomers of Shen's day still retained the lunar theory and coordinates of the earlier Yi Xing, which after 350 years had devolved {{into a state of}} considerable error. Shen criticized earlier Chinese astronomers for failing to describe celestial movement in spatial terms, yet he did not attempt to provide any reasoning for the motive power of the planets or other celestial movements. Shen and Wei began astronomical observations for the Moon and planets by plotting their locations three times <b>a</b> <b>night</b> <b>for</b> what should have been five successive years. The officials and astronomers at court were deeply opposed Wei and Shen's work, offended by their insistence that the coordinates of the renowned Yi Xing were inaccurate. They also slandered Wei Pu, out of resentment that a commoner had expertise exceeding theirs. When Wei and Shen made a public demonstration using the gnomon to prove the doubtful wrong, the other ministers reluctantly agreed to correct the lunar and solar errors. Despite this success, they eventually dismissed Wei and Shen's tables of planetary motions. Therefore, only the worst and most obvious planetary errors were corrected, and many inaccuracies remained.|$|E

25|$|Ziegler spent from 1945 to 1954 {{with the}} Grand Rapids Chicks. Although {{originally}} nicknamed Gabby by her teammates, she eventually was called Ziggy by the Grand Rapids crowds. Her leadership was indisputable since other Chicks players considered her playing style somewhat inspirational, which {{led her to}} be named captain of the team. In 1945 the Chicks finished in third place (60–50) and lost {{the first round of}} the playoff to Rockford, three to one games. The Chicks improved to second in 1946 (71–41), but were defeated again by Rockford in the first round, this time in five games.

500|$|In 1998, {{one of the}} {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts at}} the ballooning record ended with a five-mile (8km) plummet into the Coral Sea {{off the coast of}} Australia that nearly killed Fossett; he waited 72 hours to be rescued, at a cost of $500,000. The first attempt began in the Black Hills of South Dakota and ended outside Hampton, New Brunswick [...] later. The second attempt, launched from Busch Stadium, cost $300,000 and lasted [...] before being downed halfway in a tree in India; the trip set records at the time for duration and distance of flight (with Fossett doubling his own previous record) and was called Solo Spirit after Lindbergh's Spirit of St. Louis. Fossett slept an average of two hours <b>a</b> <b>night</b> <b>for</b> the six-day journey, conducted in below-zero temperatures. After taking too much fuel to cross the Atlantic Ocean and circling Libya for 12 hours while officials decided whether or not to allow him into their airspace, Fossett did not have enough fuel to finish the flight. That year, Fossett flew farther for less money than better-financed expeditions (including one supported by Richard Branson) in part due to his ability to fly in an unpressurized capsule, a result of his heavy physical training at high altitudes. The Solo Spirit capsule was put on display at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum across from the Apollo 11 command module.|$|E

2500|$|A risky {{decision}} of Barnum's established {{him as a}} legitimate impresario. During his Tom Thumb tour of England, Barnum had {{become aware of the}} popularity of Jenny Lind, the [...] "Swedish Nightingale". Lind's career was at its height in Europe. She was unpretentious, shy and devout, and possessed a crystal-clear soprano voice projected with a wistful quality and earnestness that audiences found touching. Barnum had never heard her and conceded to being unmusical himself. He approached her to sing in America at $1,000 <b>a</b> <b>night</b> <b>for</b> 150 nights, all expenses paid by him. He knew that his risk was great, noting: [...] "'The public' is a very strange animal, and although a good knowledge of human nature will generally lead a caterer of amusement to hit the people right, they are fickle and ofttimes perverse." [...] But Barnum was confident that her reputation for morality and philanthropy could be turned to good use in his publicity.|$|E
2500|$|Born in Bethel, Connecticut, Barnum {{became a}} small-business owner {{in his early}} twenties, and founded a weekly newspaper, before moving to New York City in 1834. He {{embarked}} on an entertainment career, first with a variety troupe called [...] "Barnum's Grand Scientific and Musical Theater", and soon after by purchasing Scudder's American Museum, which he renamed after himself. Barnum used the museum as a platform to promote hoaxes and human curiosities such as the Feejee mermaid and General Tom Thumb. In 1850 he promoted the American tour of singer Jenny Lind, paying her an unprecedented $1,000 <b>a</b> <b>night</b> <b>for</b> 150 nights. After economic reversals due to bad investments in the 1850s, and years of litigation and public humiliation, he used a lecture tour, mostly as a temperance speaker, to emerge from debt. His museum added America's first aquarium and expanded the wax-figure department. While in New York, he converted to Universalism {{and was a member}} of the Church of the Divine Paternity, now the Fourth Universalist Society in the City of New York.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Jim Kaat earned {{rave reviews}} {{for his role}} as CBS' backup analyst (which flashed a {{considerable}} [...] "good-guy air"). Ron Bergman wrote of Kaat's performance during the 1990 ALCS, [...] "This was <b>a</b> <b>night</b> <b>for</b> pitchers to excel. Dave Stewart. Roger Clemens. Jim Kaat [...]" [...] Despite the rave reviews, Jim Kaat admitted that he was frustrated. He felt that at that point and time, the idea of figuring out what to talk about during a three-hour broadcast had become intimidating. As a result, Kaat would bring notes into the booth, but in the process, found himself providing too much detail. He ultimately confided in his broadcasting partner, Dick Stockton, that he wanted to work without notes. So Stockton hooked Kaat up with then-lead NFL on CBS color commentator, John Madden for a telephone seminar. Madden said if he brought notes into the booth he felt compelled to use them and would [...] "force" [...] something into a telecast. On his seminar with John Madden, Jim Kaat said [...] "Then John told me if he did his homework it would be stored in his memory bank. And if it is important it will come out. If it doesn't, it probably wasn't that important." ...|$|E
