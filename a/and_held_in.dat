5|$|During {{the early}} hours of 11 September 1867, police arrested two men found {{loitering}} in Oak Street, Shudehill, suspecting them of planning to rob a shop. Both were charged under the Vagrancy Act <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>in</b> custody. The Manchester police were initially unaware of their identities, until their colleagues in the Irish police identified them as Kelly and Deasy.|$|E

5|$|Public {{entertainments}} {{varied from}} combat between just two gladiators, to large-scale events with potentially thousands of deaths. The naumachia (also called navalia proelia by the Romans) {{was one of}} the latter, a large-scale and bloody spectacular combative event taking place on many ships <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>in</b> large lakes or flooded arenas. Prisoners of war and criminals condemned to die were tasked with enacting naval battles to the death for public entertainment. Those selected were known as naumachiarii.|$|E

Wattle and daub or lath and plaster are used to fill the spaces between the timbers. The black and white appearance from the timber framing construction dates from the Tudor period, though some parts have been repaired in later years.|$|E
5|$|After the {{proclamation}} of the People's Republic of Romania on 30 December 1947, {{the existence of}} all parties other than the PCR had become purely formal, and, after the elections of 28 March the one-party state was confirmed by legislation. He was arrested on 5 May 1950, <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>in</b> the notorious Sighet prison (alongside three of his brothers — Ștefan Tătărescu included — and his former collaborator Bejan). His son Tudor, who was living in Paris, suffered from schizophrenia after 1950, {{and had to be}} committed to an institution (where he died in 1955). Sandra Tătărescu Negropontes was also imprisoned in 1950, and released three years later, upon the death of Joseph Stalin.|$|E
5|$|As a hadrosaurid, Prosaurolophus {{would have}} been a large herbivore, eating plants with a {{sophisticated}} skull that permitted a grinding motion analogous to chewing. Its teeth were continually replaced and packed into dental batteries that contained hundreds of teeth, only a relative handful of which were in use at any time. Plant material {{would have been}} cropped by its broad beak, <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>in</b> the jaws by a cheek-like structure. Feeding would have been from the ground up to around 4meters (13ft) above. Like other hadrosaurs, it could have moved both bipedally and quadrupedally. Comparisons between the scleral rings of Prosaurolophus and modern birds and reptiles suggest that it may have been cathemeral, active throughout the day at short intervals.|$|E

5|$|As {{tensions}} rose {{between the}} colonists and Britain {{in the early}} 1770s, Philipse remained loyal to the crown. He was arrested in August 1776 <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>in</b> Connecticut until a parole grant {{at the end of}} the year allowed him to return home as long as he did nothing to support the British war effort. He broke that promise the next spring: he attempted, perhaps at the behest of his wife, to inform the British that a passing column of Continental Army troops was headed south to attack a British camp at Morrisania, now in the Bronx. Shortly afterwards he fled to British-occupied New York; he would never return to his home along the Saw Mill.|$|E
5|$|During the evening, {{elements}} of Morgan's army had advanced to within five miles (8km) of Corydon. The four Legion {{companies that had}} attempted to prevent the crossing had been reinforced by four additional companies from Corydon, one from Elizabeth, and one from New Amsterdam, making the force about four-hundred strong. They lured a company of unsuspecting Confederates into an ambush where they were surrounded; sixteen were captured and taken to the Corydon jail. The invaders also successfully captured about thirty defenders in several skirmishes. They were rounded up <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>in</b> a school house near Laconia. After Morgan crossed the river he addressed the prisoners {{and told them that}} if they would promise to go home and not return to arms, he would allow them to leave and keep their guns. They all agreed and were released.|$|E
5|$|He {{was dressed}} in a strange way. A šajkača was pulled to the front of his head and almost {{completely}} covered his forehead. His eyebrows were hardly visible. Under its weight, the ears seemed to have collapsed. He wore a kind of long, black coat, covered in mud <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>in</b> place by a string. He used another piece of string for a belt, and from it hung a pot for boiling water, a tea strainer, a canteen, and other useful things. He walked slightly bent forward, followed everywhere by the noise of the things clashing at his waist.|$|E

5|$|In 1864, when Lilly's term of {{enlistment}} ended, {{he resigned}} his commission {{and left the}} 18th Indiana. Lilly joined the 9th Indiana Cavalry (121st Regiment Indiana Volunteers) and was promoted to major. At the Battle of Sulphur Creek Trestle in Alabama in September 1864, he was captured by Confederate troops {{under the command of}} Major General Nathan B. Forrest <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>in</b> a prisoner-of-war camp at Enterprise, Mississippi until his release in a prisoner exchange in January 1865. Lilly was promoted to colonel on June 4, 1865, and was stationed at Vicksburg, Mississippi, in the spring of 1865 when the war ended. In recognition of his service, he was brevetted to the rank of lieutenant colonel and mustered out of service with the 9th Indiana Cavalry on August 25, 1865.|$|E
5|$|In response, {{and hoping}} to win wider support for his government, Montfort summoned a new {{parliament}} for 20 January 1265 which continued until mid March that year. It was held at short notice, with the summons being issued on 14 December, leaving little time for attendees to respond. He summoned not only the barons, senior churchmen and two knights from each county, but also two burgesses {{from each of the}} major towns such as York, Lincoln, Sandwich, and the Cinque Ports, the first time this had been done. Due to the lack of support for Montfort among the barons, only 23 of them were summoned to parliament, in comparison to the summons issued to 120 churchmen, who largely supported the new government; it is unknown how many burgesses were called. The event was overseen by King Henry, <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>in</b> the Palace of Westminster, London, which was the largest city in England, and whose continuing loyalty was essential to Montfort's cause.|$|E
5|$|In some North Indian images, {{the male}} half may be nude and also be ithyphallic (urdhavlinga or urdhavreta: with an erect phallus), {{or with a}} full or half phallus and one testicle. However, such imagery is never found in South Indian images; the loins are usually covered in a garment (sometimes a dhoti) of silk or cotton, or {{the skin of a}} tiger or deer), {{typically}} down to the knee, <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>in</b> place by a sarpa-mekhala, serpent girdle or jewellery. The right leg may be somewhat bent or straight and often rests on a lotus pedestal (padma-pitha). The whole right half is described as smeared with ashes and as terrible and red-coloured or gold or coral in appearance; however, these features are rarely depicted.|$|E

5|$|Information about Wallenberg {{after his}} {{detention}} is mostly speculative; {{there were many}} witnesses who claim to have met him during his imprisonment. Wallenberg was transported by train from Debrecen, through Romania, to Moscow. The Soviet authorities may have moved him to Moscow {{in the hope of}} exchanging him for defectors in Sweden. Vladimir Dekanozov notified the Swedish government on 16 January 1945 that Wallenberg was under the protection of Soviet authorities. On 21 January 1945, Wallenberg was transferred to Lubyanka prison <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>in</b> cell 123 with fellow prisoner Gustav Richter, who had been a police attaché at the German embassy in Romania. Richter testified in Sweden in 1955 that Wallenberg was interrogated once for {{about an hour and a}} half, in early February 1945. On 1 March 1945, Richter was moved from his cell and never saw Wallenberg again.|$|E
5|$|On 14 May 1943, {{a forward}} {{detachment}} of the German 1st Mountain Division entered Kolašin and seized Đurišić by deceiving the Italian troops who were guarding his headquarters. Đurišić and the Chetniks did not resist their capture {{and there were}} no casualties. The Italians vigorously protested Đurišić's capture but the Germans overruled them. With the capture of Đurišić's Chetniks and another Chetnik group west of Kolašin a few days later, Case Black became an almost entirely anti-Partisan operation. Đurišić was driven away in a vehicle carrying Red Cross markings; he was then flown from Berane to a prisoner-of-war camp at Stryi in the Lviv region of Galicia which formed part of the German occupation area of the General Government. He escaped three months later and was recaptured by the authorities of the Serbian puppet government in October 1943 while attempting to cross the Danube near Pančevo in southern Banat. He was handed over to the Germans <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>in</b> the Gestapo prison in Belgrade.|$|E
5|$|On {{the death}} in office of Governor Sir James Harrison in 1971, Dunstan finally {{had the chance}} to appoint the {{governor}} of his choosing: Sir Mark Oliphant, a physicist who had worked on the Manhattan Project. Dunstan had never been happy that governors were usually British ex-servicemen; it was a personal goal of his to see an active and notable South Australian take on the role. Although the post was ceremonial, Oliphant brought energy to the role, and he used his stature to decry damage to the environment caused by deforestation, excessive open-cut mining and pollution. Oliphant's tenure was successful <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>in</b> high regard, although he did come into conflict with the premier at times as both men were outspoken and strong-willed.|$|E
