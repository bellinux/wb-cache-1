5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>tracked</b> loader is <b>an</b> {{engineering}} vehicle {{consisting of}} <b>a</b> <b>tracked</b> chassis with <b>a</b> loader for digging and loading material. The history of tracked loaders {{can be defined}} by three evolutions of their design. Each of these evolutions made the <b>tracked</b> loader <b>a</b> more viable and versatile tool in the excavation industry. These machines are capable in nearly every task, but master of none. A dozer, excavator, or wheel loader will out perform <b>a</b> <b>tracked</b> loader under <b>a</b> set of conditions, but the ability of <b>a</b> <b>tracked</b> loader to perform almost every task on a job site is why it remains a part of many companies' fleets.|$|R

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>tracking</b> matte {{is similar}} in concept to a garbage matte used in {{traveling}} matte compositing. However, the purpose of <b>a</b> <b>tracking</b> matte is to prevent tracking algorithms from using unreliable, irrelevant, or non-rigid tracking points. For example, in a scene where an actor walks in front of <b>a</b> background, the <b>tracking</b> artist will want to use only the background to track the camera through the scene, knowing that motion of the actor will throw off the calculations. In this case, the artist will construct <b>a</b> <b>tracking</b> matte to follow the actor through the scene, blocking that information from the tracking process.|$|R

50|$|The {{technique}} {{is often used}} to follow a subject that would otherwise leave the frame (ergo, it is often called a following shot), such as an actor or vehicle in motion.
