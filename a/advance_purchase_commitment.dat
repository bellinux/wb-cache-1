40|$|New {{drugs and}} {{vaccines}} {{are needed for}} tackling diseases of poverty in low- and middle-income countries. The lack of effective demand or market for these products translates into insufficient investment being made {{in research and development}} to meet the need for them. Many have advocated cost-reducing (push) and market-enhancing (pull) incentives to tackle this problem. <b>Advance</b> price or <b>purchase</b> <b>commitments</b> (APPCs) funded by international agencies and governments offer one way forward. This paper looks at design issues for APPCs for drugs and vaccines for diseases of poverty drawing on experience and lessons from three case studies: the introduction of the meningitis C vaccine in the United Kingdom; the Orphan Drug Act (ODA) in the United States of America (US); and the newly legislated US Project BioShield for bioterrorist interventions. Our key conclusion is that that APPCs have {{the potential to be a}} powerful tool and should be tried. The correct structure and design may only be determined through the process of taking action to set one up...|$|R

In practice, since most <b>advance</b> <b>purchase</b> customers may expect to purchase items at discount prices, the purchasing behavior of these customers may differ from the regular purchase customers.

Applying the model to an online DVD rental history data, we examine how consumption uncertainty may drive <b>advance</b> <b>purchase</b> decisions. Consumers tend to overpurchase to cover the unexpected volatility of future consumption needs, avoid stockouts and switching costs. Over time, consumers learn to reduce uncertainty but only those with lower switching costs adjust their overpurchases to adapt to their reduced uncertainty. Bucket pricing could lead to greater profits if higher-level plans were more attractive, which would induce consumers to overpurchase more.

40|$|A {{manufacturer}} writes {{supply contracts}} with N buyers. Then, the buyers invest in innovation, and the manufacturer builds capacity. Finally, demand is realized, and the firms renegotiate the supply contracts {{to achieve an}} efficient allocation of capacity among the buyers. The court remedy for breach of contract (specific performance versus expectation damages) affects how the firms share the gain from renegotiation, and hence how the firms make investments ex ante. The objective is to design supply contracts that will induce the buyers and manufacturer {{to make the first}} best investments. When the manufacturer is dominant and the breach remedy is expectation damages, the first best is achieved with simple <b>advance</b> <b>purchase</b> contracts. In contrast, with a dominant manufacturer and specific performance, the first best may not be achieved. A "tradable options" clause is needed to increase the buyers' incentive for investment. When the buyers have significant bargaining power and the breach remedy is expectation damages, simple <b>advance</b> <b>purchase</b> contracts will always result in underinvestment in capacity and overinvestment in innovation by the buyers. However, if the separability condition proposed in Edlin and Reichelstein (1996) holds and the breach remedy is specific performance, then the first best is achieved with simple <b>advance</b> <b>purchase</b> contracts. Finally, building on Maskin and Moore (1999) we describe more complex contracts that induce the first best where simple <b>advance</b> <b>purchase</b> contracts fail. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{important}} {{problem of how}} to assure credible forecast information sharing between a supplier and a manufacturer. The supplier is responsible for acquiring the necessary capacity before receiving an order from the manufacturer who possesses private forecast information for her end product. We address how different contracts affect the supplier's capacity decision and, hence, the profitability of the supplier and the manufacturer. We fully develop two contracts (and provide explicit formulae) to enable credible forecast information sharing. The first is a nonlinear capacity reservation contract under which the manufacturer agrees to pay a fee to reserve capacity. The second is an <b>advance</b> <b>purchase</b> contract under which the manufacturer is induced to place a firm order before the supplier secures the component capacity used to build the end product. These contracts serve a strategic role in information sharing. The capacity reservation contract enables the supplier to detect the manufacturer's private forecast information, while the <b>advance</b> <b>purchase</b> contract enables the manufacturer to signal her forecast information. We show that channel coordination is possible even under asymmetric forecast information by combining the <b>advance</b> <b>purchase</b> contract with an appropriate payback agreement. Through our structural and numerical results we also show that the degree of forecast information asymmetry and the risk-adjusted profit margin are two important drivers that determine supply chain efficiency and which contract to adopt. game theory, screening, signaling, coordination, supply contracts, capacity reservation, <b>advance</b> <b>purchase,</b> payback, asymmetric information, forecast...|$|R

40|$|In {{the first}} essay, {{we present a}} unified {{treatment}} of postponement strategies in combination of <b>advance</b> <b>purchase</b> contract, option contract, and recourse contract. Specifically, we consider an uncapacitated manufacturer who before uncertainty is resolved offers a monopolistic price-setting newsvendor opportunities to <b>purchase</b> in <b>advance</b> at a given price (<b>advance</b> <b>purchase),</b> and/or to pay to reserve capacity upfront for execution if needed (option); after market uncertainty is resolved, it further offers an expediting alternative for purchase (recourse). To address the linkage between these long and short term contracts, we endogenize the spot market price in the newsvendor model. We show {{that for the most}} general case that includes all three contracts with up to ten decision variables, it can be effectively solved by studying the functional form of a reduced optimization problem in one variable. Therefore, our technique could be adapted to analyze any subsumed postponement models with considerably sharper results. We further show how channel coordination and arbitrary profit allocation can be achieved through non-linear price scheme in the context of <b>advance</b> <b>purchase,</b> options, and recourse contracts. In addition, through numerical analysis, we measure the incremental gains from additional procurement alternatives, and classify the cases in which simpler procurement contracts perform well. ^ The second essay investigates how a manufacturer can influence to its advantage the nature of retailer-competition by carefully selecting contracting elements when selling to retailers who compete in a consumer market: multiple ordering opportunities and the relative market power of retailers. Under a similar modeling framework as depicted in Essay I but with no option contract, we consider two retailers both sourcing from the same manufacturer and when both retailers order in advance, they may order sequentially or simultaneously. Upon receiving orders, the manufacturer produces and delivers them. After uncertainty is resolved, the retailers may trade stock with each other. In addition, they can purchase more from the manufacturer who has the quick-response production capability. We identify sufficient conditions for the existence of pure-strategy equilibria for all settings and obtain sufficient conditions for the <b>advance</b> <b>purchase</b> stage or recourse stage trading to occur. Moreover, through numerical studies, we find that the manufacturer prefers offering <b>advance</b> <b>purchase</b> opportunities to both retailers simultaneously if its production technology is more flexible in the sense that delayed production is not too costly. Otherwise, the manufacturer prefers letting the retailers order sequentially in advance. Offering only one retailer the <b>advance</b> <b>purchase</b> opportunity is always dominated by one of the other two cases. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} real options model of R&D valuation, which {{takes into account}} the {{uncertainty}} in the quality of the research output, the time and cost to completion, and the market demand for the R&D output. The model is then applied to study the problem of pharmaceutical under-investment in R&D for vaccines to treat diseases affecting the developing regions of the world. To address this issue, world organizations and private foundations are willing to sponsor vaccine R&D, but there is no consensus on how to administer the sponsorship effectively. Different research incentive contracts are examined using our valuation model. Their effectiveness is measured in the following four dimensions: cost to the sponsor, the probability of development success, the consumer surplus generated and the expected cost per person successfully vaccinated. We find that, in general, <b>purchase</b> <b>commitment</b> plans (pull subsidies) are more effective than cost subsidy plans (push subsidies), while extending patent protection is completely ineffective. Specifically, we find that a hybrid subsidy constructed from a <b>purchase</b> <b>commitment</b> combined with a sponsor co-payment feature produces the best results in all four dimensions of the effectiveness measure. ________________________________________________________________________ *We thank seminar participants at Rochester and NYU for helpful comments and discussions.
