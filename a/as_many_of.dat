Miller scored 163 in 250minutes, hitting 20fours and three sixes in another innings win. Soon after, Rawtenstall dropped the contract dispute with Miller after being offered compensation.|$|E
5|$|The {{experience}} reinforced Drake's {{decision to}} retreat from live appearances; the few concerts he did play around this time were usually brief, awkward, and poorly attended. Drake seemed reluctant to perform and rarely addressed his audience. <b>As</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> his songs were played in different tunings, he frequently paused to retune between numbers.|$|E

5|$|A Han kingdom {{was much}} like a commandery in size and administration, except it was officially, and after 145 BC, nominally, the fief of a {{relative}} to the emperor, including brothers, uncles, nephews, and sons—excluding the heir apparent. The policy of awarding kingdoms only to imperial relatives was gradually adopted by the founder Emperor Gaozu of Han (r. 202–195 BC), <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the early kings were non-relatives who were leading officers during the Chu-Han contention (206–202 BC). Kingdoms were usually inherited by the king's eldest son born to his queen.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 57 genera of {{flowering}} plants contain at least 500 species, {{according to a}} 2004 analysis by the botanical taxonomist David Frodin. The actual numbers of species are imprecisely known, <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the genera have not {{been the subject of}} recent monographs. For instance, {{estimates of the number of}} species in the orchid genus Pleurothallis range from 1,120 to 2,500. Genera from other groups of vascular plants, but which have similarly large numbers of species, include Selaginella, Asplenium and Cyathea.|$|E
5|$|Approximately half of {{all known}} {{antibiotics}} interfere with the workings of a bacteria's ribosome, a large and complex biochemical machine that performs protein biosynthesis by translating messenger RNA into proteins. Macrolide antibiotics clog the ribosome's exit tunnel, preventing synthesis of essential bacterial proteins. In 2007, the Pande lab received a grant to study and design new antibiotics. In 2008, they used Folding@home to study the interior of this tunnel and how specific molecules may affect it. The full structure of the ribosome was determined only as of 2011, and Folding@home has also simulated ribosomal proteins, <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> their functions remain largely unknown.|$|E

5|$|As in Britain, some Southern Rhodesian women {{during the}} war {{presented}} men not wearing military uniform with white feathers (symbolising cowardice). This campaign often went awry, <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the men presented with the feathers were not in fact shirking from service. In 1916, hoping to save them further harassment, the Rhodesia Herald and other newspapers began publishing lists of men who had volunteered only to be deemed medically unfit by the army doctors.|$|E
5|$|Baseball was a {{reasonably}} popular sport in Australia {{in the early}} 20th century and Ponsford alternated between cricket and baseball throughout his sporting life. At the time, baseball was generally played in Australia during the winter months, <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the leading players were enthusiastic cricketers who viewed the sport {{as a means of}} improving their fielding skills. As with cricket, Ponsford started his baseball career at Alfred Crescent School, where his coach was the former Victorian player Charles Landsdown. As a junior Ponsford played shortstop, later as a senior for the Fitzroy Baseball Club he converted to catching.|$|E
5|$|Besides the {{internal}} references {{that they often}} make to earlier passages within them, Schubert's last sonatas contain distinct allusions and resemblances {{to some of his}} previous works, mostly earlier piano works, as well <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> his songs. Important similarities also exist between certain passages in the sonatas and works from other genres that were composed in parallel, during the same months in 1828.|$|E
50|$|Often, {{behavioral}} and neuropsychologic disturbances accompany {{the progression of}} LKS. Behavioral issues are seen in <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>as</b> 78% <b>of</b> all cases.

5|$|British {{immersive}} theatre company Punchdrunk {{took inspiration}} from the Paisley witch trials for their ongoing New York City production, Sleep No More. Gallow Green, {{the name of the}} fictitious Scottish town that serves as the show's setting, as well <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the characters (including Fulton, Bargarran, Reid, Agnes Naismith, Catherine Campbell, James Lindsey, and Nurse Christian Shaw) were all taken from the witch trials and interwoven with the elements of William Shakespeare's Macbeth found throughout the immersive production.|$|E
5|$|Cumberland's {{neighbour}} club Western Suburbs {{had used}} {{black and white}} as their colours, which {{had been taken from}} Ashfield rugby club, a second grade rugby union team which supplied many of Western Suburbs players. Unlike other clubs, Western Suburbs did not take their colours from their district rugby union team, due to Ashfield's influence at the club. Cumberland thought of using the bottle green of the Western Suburbs Rugby Union Club, <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> their team members were from there. However, the club believed that some would be unable to distinguish Western Suburbs and Cumberland if this approach was taken.|$|E
5|$|Dawson City {{was founded}} in 1896 {{in the early days}} of the Klondike Gold Rush, {{alongside}} the Yukon River in north-western Canada. Swelled by would-be gold-miners and adventurers, Dawson's population soared to 30,000 at the height of the rush in 1898. Dawson declined in size again <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the immigrants left, but it was appointed the Territorial Capital of the new Yukon Territory in 1900, and by the following year it had a stable population of around 10,000.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, San Francisco {{became a}} major debarkation point for {{servicemen}} stationed in the Pacific Theater. The U.S. military, which was concerned about male homosexuality, had a policy of dismissing servicemen caught in known gay establishments with blue discharges. <b>As</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> these men faced ostracism from their communities and families, they chose {{to remain in the}} city. The number of men that remained was a significant factor {{in the creation of a}} homosexual community in San Francisco.|$|E
5|$|During the {{engagement}} the Japanese {{had opened up}} with the artillery that they had brought up {{in support of the}} main defensive position on Tsimba Ridge, firing {{for the first time in}} the sector. This barrage was largely ineffective, inflicting only one casualty, <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the shells proved to be faulty and did not detonate. The Australians also came across a large camp, including a field hospital, which they captured intact. Another group of huts was also discovered, from where they gained intelligence identifying the Japanese troops in the area as belonging to the 81st Infantry Regiment. They also managed to capture two 70mm guns, and ammunition for them.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the brief}} April War, the Germans had {{captured}} over 300 ex-VVKJ aircraft. They considered {{them to be}} of little use for the Luftwaffe, so {{it was decided to}} equip the ZNDH with an appropriate number of these aircraft. These aircraft, scattered in every corner of Yugoslavia, were then collected, minor damage repaired and stocks of fuel and spare parts stored at airfield workshops. Naturally, the majority of the aircraft were more or less damaged and action was undertaken to repair <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> them as possible. Former VVKJ pilots of Croatian background and other personnel of aeronautical specialty were approached and offered instant rehabilitation (most of them were in German POW camps), jobs and safety for their families.|$|E
5|$|For choreographer, Bergstein chose Kenny Ortega, who {{had been}} trained by Gene Kelly.

5|$|Genera with closed fruitbodies {{within the}} family are form taxa instead of natural groups: Arcangeliella, Gastrolactarius, and Zelleromyces are phylogenetically part of Lactarius, while Cystangium, Elasmomyces, Gymnomyces, Macowanites, and Martellia belong to Russula. Nevertheless, some of these genus names are still in use, <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> the {{concerned}} species have not yet formally been synonymised with Lactarius or Russula.|$|E
