40|$|Abstract — SiGe bipolar {{technology}} has matured {{to provide a}} less expensive alternative to III-V, {{while at the same}} time ensuring superior performance compared to silicon. SiGe bipolar transistors, due to the lower band gap of SiGe (compared to Silicon), combine high-drift velocities with lower recombination in the base to provide higher forward current gain. This material system is very much perfect for high-power RF applications. SiGe HBTs offer important potential advantages over HFETs in terms of high transconductance, controlled linearity, freedom from surface trapping effects and controllable tradeoff of between unity current gain cut-off frequency (ft) and breakdown voltage. For high power applications, higher breakdown voltage and ft is necessary. Thus SiGe material system will have superior performance over other material systems. In this paper, we analyze the performance of SiGe HBTs for analog/RF applications. Improvements in terms of early voltage, intrinsic gain and junction breakdown voltage are noticed. Moreover ft and fmax for these devices show significant improvement making these devices an <b>able</b> <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> future RF applications.

40|$|This chapter {{demonstrates}} {{a new approach}} to manipulate and classify the graphene flake by choosing an optimal frequency of the applied electric field. In recent years, graphene {{has been the subject of}} increasing attention because it has a great potential for use in nano optoelectronics. Graphene is another novel nanomaterial and researchers have found a strong photoresponse near the graphene-metal interfaces. In addition graphene-based photodetectors can potentially be used for high-speed optical communications. The most common fabrication technique used for graphene-based nanostructures can be divided into two steps-first, electron beam lithography (EBL) is employed to pattern metal electrodes on a graphene. Then the resulting structures are etched by an oxygen plasma. However, plasma etching induces localization of charge carriers in graphene and changes its electronic properties. The disadvantages of EBL include its high cost and its low throughput. EBL machines are expensive and they also require substantial maintenance. Moreover, the patterning process takes a long time to complete because the electron beam is required to scan samples pixel by pixel. Discussion correlated the conductivity of the graphene flake with the frequency of the applied electric field. The theoretical prediction agrees well with the experimental results. With the ability to select high-conductivity graphene, the experimental result shows that graphene is a promising <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> <b>IR</b> detection. The present study provides a systematic and reproducible method of selecting and separating high-conductivity graphene, which can also be used to manufacture novel IR nano sensors. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

With this implementation, candidates are required to take the MEdSI test that measures their personality as teachers before they are shortlisted for an interview. Such screening procedures are adopted in line with the MOE's plan to have more quality teachers. Indeed, improving the quality of teachers through rigid selection procedures that will result in the selection of only the best and the most <b>able</b> <b>candidates</b> <b>for</b> the teaching profession will enhance the teaching profession. The focus in MEdSI is on future teachers’ personality as this aspect was not previously emphasized. Since MEdSI screening procedure is still new, its evaluations and implications in selecting teachers is needed and to verify its effectiveness. The process of recruiting and screening applicants in the teaching line is a time-consuming procedure. Research proves that a systematic process needs to be utilized in selecting the best applicant. Personality factors are widely considered in selection practices and research concerning intrinsic qualities of the student teachers is needed for the better selection procedures. To summarize, a study that analyzed the perspective of the MEdSI certified interviewers will provide some light on the most useful way to screen or select quality teachers-to-be...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that for {{spatially}} flat FRW cosmologies, the holographic dark energy disfavours the Hubble parameter as a <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> the <b>IR</b> cutoff. <b>For</b> overcoming this problem, we explore the use of this cutoff in holographic ellipsoidal cosmological models, and derive the general ellipsoidal metric induced by a such holographic energy density. Despite the drawbacks that this cutoff presents in homogeneous and isotropic universes, based on this general metric, we developed a suitable ellipsoidal holographic cosmological model, filled with a dark matter and a dark energy components. At late time stages, the cosmic evolution is dominated by a holographic anisotropic dark energy with barotropic equations of state. The cosmologies expand in all directions in accelerated manner. Since the ellipsoidal cosmologies given here are not asymptotically FRW, the deviation from homogeneity and isotropy of the universe on large cosmological scales remains constant during all cosmic evolution. This feature allows studied holographic ellipsoidal cosmologies to be ruled by an equation of state ω=p/ρ, whose range belongs to quintessence or even phantom matter.

40|$|We {{consider}} a holographic dark energy model, {{in which both}} the CC energy density rho_Lambda and the Newton constant G_N are varying quantities, to study the problem of setting an effective field-theory IR cutoff. Assuming that ordinary matter scales canonically, we show that the continuity equation univocally fixes the IR cutoff, provided a law of variation for either rho_Lambda or G_N is known. Previous considerations on holographic dark energy disfavor the Hubble parameter as a <b>candidate</b> <b>for</b> the <b>IR</b> cutoff (<b>for</b> spatially flat universes), since {{in this case the}} ratio of dark energy to dark matter is not allowed to vary, thus hindering a deceleration era of the universe for the redshifts z>= 0. 5. On the other hand, the future event horizon as a choice <b>for</b> the <b>IR</b> cutoff is being favored in the literature, although the `coincidence problem' usually cannot be addressed in that case. We extend considerations to spatially curved universes, and show that with the Hubble parameter as a choice <b>for</b> the <b>IR</b> cutoff one always obtains a universe that never accelerates or a universe that accelerates all the time, thus making the transition from deceleration to acceleration impossible. Next, we apply the IR cutoff consistency procedure to a RG running CC model, in which the low-energy variation of the CC is due to quantum effects of particle fields having masses near the Planck scale. We show that bringing such a model in full accordance with holography amounts to having such an IR cutoff which scales as a square root of the Hubble parameter. We find that such a setup, in which the only undetermined input represents the true ground state of the vacuum, can give early deceleration as well as late time acceleration. The possibility of further improvement of the model is also briefly indicated. Comment: 13 pages, 1 figure, revised, to appear in Phys. Rev. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} in {{response}} to an invitation from the Victorian Department of Education and Training to undertake a targeted review of effective teaching recruitment strategies. The paper provides a ‘snapshot’ of what is happening in other States and Territories and in selected countries overseas. The review is based mainly on information supplied by a small group of stakeholders (See Appendix 1) and derived from relevant printed and online resources. The main focus of the review is on the kinds of strategies that different educational jurisdictions have used to overcome teacher supply problems. The original intention of the review was to focus only on those strategies that were seen to be effective but this was broadened to include unproven and pilot strategies. This is because the majority of initiatives have only been operating for a short time, in some cases for less than twelve months, in other cases for only one or two years. This has not been long enough for an evaluation to have been carried out. A second problem relates to measuring ‘effectiveness’. Often the success of strategies is measured in quantitative terms, such as the number of applicants for teaching scholarships, the proportion of schools that report recruitment difficulties or the length of service in a remote school. The teacher supply problem is not simply one of increasing teacher numbers however. Before developing further strategies or refining the ones that already exist in Victoria, it would be worthwhile clarifying the criteria for ‘effectiveness’. Is the initiative able to attract the most <b>able</b> <b>candidates,</b> <b>for</b> example? Is it sustainable? Does it enhance the status of teaching? Does it encourage a long-term commitment from teachers? The problem of teacher demand and supply is both cyclical and complex with a range of interconnecting variables. It is usually most evident when ‘an underlying weakness in the supply pool is coincident with demographic or policy change which places additional strain on the supply pool’. 1 This review looks briefly at practices in other Australian States and Territories, the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States and New Zealand...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{problem of}} {{determining}} the physical conformation of a protein dimer, given the structures of the two interacting proteins in their unbound state, is a difficult one. The location of the docking interface is determined largely by geometric complementarity, but finding complementary geometry {{is complicated by the}} flexibility of the backbone and side-chains of both proteins. We seek to generate <b>candidates</b> <b>for</b> docking that approximate the bound state well, even in cases where there is backbone and/or side-chain difference from unbound to bound states. Results We divide the surfaces of each protein into local patches and describe the effect of side-chain flexibility on each patch by sampling the space of conformations of its side-chains. Likely positions of individual side-chains are given by a rotamer library; this library is used to derive a sample of possible mutual conformations within the patch. We enforce broad coverage of torsion space. We control the size of the sample by using energy criteria to eliminate unlikely configurations, and by clustering similar configurations, resulting in 50 <b>candidates</b> <b>for</b> a patch, a manageable number for docking. Conclusions Using a database of protein dimers for which the bound and unbound structures of the monomers are known, we show that from the unbound patch we are <b>able</b> to generate <b>candidates</b> <b>for</b> docking that approximate the bound structure. In patches where backbone change is small (within 1 &# 197; RMSD of bound), we are able to account for flexibility and generate candidates that are good approximations of the bound state (82 % are within 1 &# 197; and 98 % are within 1. 4 &# 197; RMSD of the bound conformation). We also find that even in cases of moderate backbone flexibility our <b>candidates</b> are <b>able</b> to capture some of the overall shape change.
