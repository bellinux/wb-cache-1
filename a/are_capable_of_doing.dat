25|$|Animal aerial {{locomotion}} can {{be divided}} into two categories—powered and unpowered. In unpowered modes of locomotion, the animal uses aerodynamics forces exerted on the body due to wind or falling through the air. In powered flight, the animal uses muscular power to generate aerodynamic forces. Animals using unpowered aerial locomotion cannot maintain altitude and speed due to unopposed drag, while animals using powered flight can maintain steady, level flight as long as their muscles <b>are</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> so.|$|E

25|$|Males {{have been}} {{experimentally}} {{shown to be}} capable of deliberately delivering food to larvae when females are absent and food surplus is available. Males feed the larvae with the same proportion of individuals as females. They are, however much less efficient than females at feeding. They spend over 90% of feeding bouts masticating and end up feeding far fewer larvae. The males also preferentially feed the largest larvae, resulting in the death of many smaller and younger larvae. It was only possible to observe this behavior by removing all females from a nest and hand feeding the males, as the males cannot forage on their own and have no opportunity to care for larvae if females occupy this role. While males are typically not responsible for feeding larvae in naturally occurring populations, they <b>are</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> so.|$|E
500|$|The {{context of}} [...] "Part of Your World" [...] {{and the fact}} that it occurs before Ariel meets and falls in love with Eric is often used to defend Ariel against critics who accuse her of sacrificing her talents for a man. Boing Boings Caroline Siede {{explained}} that Ariel [...] "just happens to end up with a prince in the process of achieving her larger dream" [...] to become human. Similarly, Sophie Katz of The Odyssey Online wrote that the song proves that Ariel [...] "doesn’t give up her voice only for a guy. She already wanted to be 'part of that world.' The prince was a bonus." [...] Writing for Yahoo! Movies, Gwynne Watkins penned [...] "There’s little doubt that Ariel’s crush on Prince Eric strengthens her resolve to be part of the human world. But crucially, her love of 'the world above' is established long before she sets eyes on the prince" [...] during [...] "Part of Your World". Laura Stampler, writing for Time, agreed that the character [...] " [...] in love with the human world before she even knew who Eric was" [...] because [...] "she has always dreamed of being a 'part of your world'". Ariel sings [...] "Bright young women, sick of swimmin’, ready to stand" [...] to indicate that she fantasizes about [...] "living in a feminist-friendly society where she can speak her mind freely and grow intellectually", demonstrating envy towards women who <b>are</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> this on land. However, Times Laura Stampler joked that Ariel will find the human world disappointing [...] "considering my dad definitely still reprimanded me (even though I had legs)." [...] In the reprise, the lyrics [...] "Part of that world" [...] are replaced with [...] "part of your world" [...] to distinguish that the character is now referring to her feelings for Eric, whom Ariel had not yet met when she sang the original song.|$|E

2500|$|Hired {{guns and}} sellswords, mercenaries perform two roles within the Warmachine game. First, {{mercenary}} warcasters, solos, and units {{are able to}} be included in certain factions, defined by the individual unit's special rules. Second, mercenaries may be played as a separate faction generally, as well as through the use of theme forces. [...] Themes represent [...] "minor factions" [...] and each theme has special rules to increase the effectiveness of the mercenary armies. There are currently a number of mercenary themes available: Llaelese Resistance, the Kingmaker's Army, Hammer Strike, the Irregulars, and Operating Theatre. While a few of the Iron Kingdoms' nations produce warjacks for mercenaries (specifically the nations of Ord, Rhul, and [...] Llael), many mercenaries make do with scavenging surplus military warjacks, building their own custom warjacks, or converting laborjacks into machines of war, refitting them until they <b>are</b> <b>capable</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> battle on par with the nations of the Iron Kingdoms.
