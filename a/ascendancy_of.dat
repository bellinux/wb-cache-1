5|$|Governor Breathitt died of {{tuberculosis}} on February 21, 1834, and Morehead {{was sworn in}} as governor the following day. The replacement of a Democratic governor with one from the rival National Republican party caused a great deal of angst among Democrats, but the <b>ascendancy</b> <b>of</b> Democrat James Guthrie to president of the state senate and Morehead's willingness to retain Breathitt's secretary of state, Lewis Saunders, did much to allay their fears.|$|E

5|$|The Siege of Patras in 805 or 807 was {{undertaken}} by the local Slavic tribes of the Peloponnese, reportedly with aid from an Arab fleet.

5|$|The <b>ascendancy</b> <b>of</b> Li Yuanhong to Chinese Presidency in 1916, {{led to the}} {{negotiations}} reopening through his former private secretary who resided in the United States at the time. In exchange for allowing arms shipments to India via China's borders, China was offered German military assistance and the rights to 10% of any material shipped to India via China.

5|$|Warwick {{had been}} such an {{influential}} figure in 15th-century English politics that, on his death, no one matched him in terms of power and popularity.

5|$|Herodotus recounts that, on the {{afternoon}} of the Battle of Plataea, a rumour of their victory at that battle reached the Allies' navy, at that time off the coast of Mount Mycale in Ionia. Their morale boosted, the Allied marines fought and won a decisive victory at the Battle of Mycale that same day, destroying the remnants of the Persian fleet, crippling Xerxes's sea power, and marking the <b>ascendancy</b> <b>of</b> the Greek fleet. Whilst many modern historians doubt that Mycale took place on the same day as Plataea, the battle may well only have occurred once the Allies received news of the events unfolding in Greece.|$|E
5|$|The Ordinances {{were never}} again reissued, and {{therefore}} hold no permanent {{position in the}} legal history of England {{in the way that}} Magna Carta, for instance, does. The criticism has been against the conservative focus of the barons' role in national politics, ignoring the <b>ascendancy</b> <b>of</b> the commons. Yet the document, and the movement behind it, reflected new political developments in its emphasis on how assent was to be obtained by the barons in parliament. It {{was only a matter of}} time before it was generally acknowledged that the Commons were an integral part of that institution.|$|E

5|$|This {{rendition}} {{is fraught}} with many errors but the basic story line seems to fit the modern consensus. Father Queroz’s time line is also anachronistic.

5|$|Vijayanagara {{literature}} in Kannada {{is the body}} of literature composed in the Kannada language of South India during the <b>ascendancy</b> <b>of</b> the Vijayanagara Empire which lasted from the 14th through the 16th century.

Although it lasted until 1664, its power declined after a major military defeat by the Shahi Sultanates {{in the battle of}} Talikota in 1565. The empire is named after its capital city Vijayanagara, whose ruins surround modern Hampi, now a World Heritage Site in Karnataka.|$|E
5|$|While the Persians proved largely {{successful}} {{during the}} first stage of the war from 602 to 622, conquering much of the Levant, Egypt, several islands in the Aegean Sea and parts of Anatolia, the <b>ascendancy</b> <b>of</b> emperor Heraclius in 610 led, despite initial setbacks, to a Status quo ante bellum. Heraclius' campaigns in Persian lands from 622 to 626 forced the Persians onto the defensive, allowing his forces to regain momentum. Allied with the Avars and Slavs, the Persians made a final attempt to take Constantinople in 626, but were defeated there. In 627 Heraclius invaded the heartland of the Persians and forced them to sue for peace.|$|E

5|$|A Greek fleet {{under the}} Spartan king Leotychides had sailed to Samos to {{challenge}} {{the remnants of the}} Persian fleet. The Persians, whose ships were in a poor state of repair, had decided not to risk fighting and instead drew their ships up on the beach at the feet of Mount Mycale in Ionia. An army of 60,000 men had been left there by Xerxes and the fleet joined with them, building a palisade around the camp to protect the ships. However, Leotychides decided to attack the camp with the Allied fleet's marines. Seeing the small size of the Greek force, the Persians emerged from the camp but the Greek hoplites again proved superior and destroyed much of the Persian force. The ships were abandoned to the Greeks, who burned them, crippling Xerxes' sea power and marking the <b>ascendancy</b> <b>of</b> the Greek fleet.|$|E
5|$|Banagher was {{extensively}} {{planted by}} the English, {{particularly during the}} periods 1621–1642 and 1650–1690. The plantations {{had a profound impact}} on Ireland in several ways. The first was the destruction of the native ruling classes and their replacement with the Protestant <b>Ascendancy,</b> <b>of</b> British-origin (mostly English) Protestant landowners. Their position was buttressed by the Penal Laws, which denied political and land-owning rights to Roman Catholics. The dominance of this class in Irish life persisted until the late 18th century, and it voted for the Act of Union with Britain in 1800. As a result, by the early 20th century, Banagher had a mix of Irish of native descent and Irish of English descent and supported two churches, one Catholic and one Protestant, both of which still exist.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{unsuccessful}} ventures against Philip and Alexander, the Athenians still respected Demosthenes. In 336BC, the orator Ctesiphon {{proposed that}} Athens honour Demosthenes {{for his services}} to the city by presenting him, according to custom, with a golden crown. This proposal became a political issue and, in 330BC, Aeschines prosecuted Ctesiphon on charges of legal irregularities. In his most brilliant speech, On the Crown, Demosthenes effectively defended Ctesiphon and vehemently attacked those who would have preferred peace with Macedon. He was unrepentant about his past actions and policies and insisted that, when in power, the constant aim of his policies was the honour and the <b>ascendancy</b> <b>of</b> his country; and on every occasion and in all business he preserved his loyalty to Athens. He finally defeated Aeschines, although his enemy's objections to the crowning were arguably valid from a legal point of view.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 12th-century <b>ascendancy</b> <b>of</b> the Hoysalas, {{the kings of}} the dynasty entertained {{imperial}} ambitions. King Vishnuvardhana wanted to perform Vedic sacrifices befitting an emperor, and surpass his overlords, the Western Chalukyas, in military and architectural achievements. This led to his conversion from Jainism to Vaishnavism. Around the same time, the well-known philosopher Ramanujacharya sought refuge from the Cholas in Hoysala territory and popularised the Sri Vaishnava faith, a sect of Hindu Vaishnavism. Although Jains continued to dominate culturally {{in what is now}} the southern Karnataka region for a while, these social changes would later contribute to the decline of Jain literary output. The growing political clout of the Hoysalas attracted many bards and scholars to their court, who in turn wrote panegyrics on their patrons.|$|E
5|$|When Philip {{began his}} attack in 349 BC, the Olynthians appealed to Athens for aid. In response, Demosthenes gave {{a series of}} speeches, {{now known as the}} Olynthiacs, {{encouraging}} the Athenians to resist Philip. The period from 351 BC to 346 BC marks the gradual <b>ascendancy</b> <b>of</b> Demosthenes in Athenian politics, as he became leader of the Athenian resistance to Philip. However, exactly when Demosthenes became important is disputed; Cawkwell points out that the chance preservation of a good proportion of Demosthenes's speeches may make him seem more important than he was. In the end, the Athenians decided to send a force of 2000 lightly armed mercenaries (referred to in the sources as peltasts, even if strictly speaking, they were not), and 38 triremes to aid the Olynthians. Of these triremes, 30 were already in service under Chares, possibly operating in the north Aegean; the other 8 were to be crewed by Athenians citizens. However, {{it is not clear whether}} this force achieved anything.|$|E

As soon as the Peloponnesians had marched north of the isthmus, the Athenian fleet under Xanthippus had joined up {{with the rest of the}} Allied fleet. The fleet, now able to match the Persians, had first sailed to Samos, where the Persian fleet was based. The Persians, whose ships were in a poor state of repair, had decided not to risk fighting, and instead drew their ships up on the beach under Mycale.
