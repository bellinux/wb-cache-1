2500|$|MRI {{scanners}} {{have become}} significant sources of revenue for healthcare providers in the US. This {{is because of}} favorable reimbursement rates from insurers and federal government programs. Insurance reimbursement is provided in two components, an equipment charge for the actual performance and operation of the MRI scan and a professional charge for the radiologist's review of the images and/or data. [...] In the US Northeast, an equipment charge might be $3,500/€2.600 and a professional charge might be $350/€260, although the actual fees received by the equipment owner and interpreting physician are often significantly less and depend on the rates negotiated with insurance companies or determined by the Medicare fee schedule. For example, an orthopedic surgery group in Illinois billed a charge of $1,116/€825 for a knee MRI in 2007, but the Medicare reimbursement in 2007 was only $470.91/€350.

They also feel as if the wages that people are being paid should be increased, another factor of the continued completion of the pipeline that the administration feels would be beneficial. The fast change of pace is what led to the clashes and resulting arrests of those who were residing on the land in order to continue the protesting of a pipeline. The actual purpose of the orders signed by Trump was to counteract the denial by the USACE to continue the pipeline being built, which was originally issued in November 2015.|$|E

40|$|The {{need for}} fast drug {{innovation}} {{and the public}} demand for risk-free drugs creates a dilemma for regulatory authorities: less restrictive procedures involve uncertainties about benefit/risk profiles of new drugs. The European Union has introduced two instruments that regulate early market access: conditional approvals (CAs) and approvals under exceptional circumstances (ECs). We have studied whether these instruments compromise the safety of new drugs and whether they lead to earlier access to innovative drugs. Our study shows that neither of these regulatory pathways accelerates the approval process for innovative drugs. However, the CA pathway shortens the clinical development period. Approvals under ECs are associated with longer clinical development periods, but this regulatory pathway may open up opportunities for specific drugs to be admitted into the market because less comprehensive data are required. Despite {{the fact that these}} <b>advanced</b> <b>approvals</b> are based on limited safety databases, there are no special safety issues associated with using these pathways...|$|R

40|$|Study Objectives - To {{evaluate}} {{the implementation of}} a Patient Admission Prediction Tool (PAPT) in terms of patient flow outcomes and decision-making strategies. Methods - Setting: The PAPT was implemented in 2 Australian public teaching hospitals during October-December 2010 (hospital A) and October-December 2011 (hospital B). Design: A multisite prospective, comparative (before and after) design was used. Patient flow outcomes measured included access block and hospital occupancy. Daily and weekly data were collected from patient flow reports and routinely collected emergency department information by the site champion and researchers. Results - Daily decision-making strategies ranged from business as usual to use of overcensus beds. Weekly strategies included <b>advanced</b> <b>approval</b> to use of overcensus beds and prebooking nursing staff. These strategies resulted in improved weekend discharges to manage incoming demand for the following week. Following the introduction of the PAPT and workflow guidelines, patient access and hospital occupancy levels could be maintained despite increases in patient presentations (hospital A). Conclusions - The use of a PAPT, embedded in patient flow management processes and championed by a manager, can benefit bed and staff management. Further research that incorporates wider evaluation of the use of the tool at other sites is warranted...|$|R
40|$|COURSE OBJECTIVES: To {{frame and}} analyze the most {{critical}} issues facing higher education in major research universities in the United States today, to understand their historical evolution and to project how these issues may affect universities of the future. The course begins with {{a consideration of the}} university's external environment: its sources of revenue and its relationships with state and federal government as well as the private sector. Then we shift focus to several key internal issues: the changing nature of the academy, pedagogy, the student body, information technology and governance. We also look closely at two important domains: intercollegiate athletics and the health system. Finally, we conclude by considering various perspectives on restructuring the research university. COURSE REQUIREMENTS: The requirements for this course include weekly readings, active class participation (50 % of course grade), and a significant research paper on a critical issue facing higher education (50 % of course grade). Brief research proposals are due on October 5, although earlier discussions with the faculty are also welcome. Research papers are due on December 10. Collaborative research projects are acceptable, with <b>advanced</b> <b>approval</b> by the instructors. READINGS: A coursepack is available for purchase at DollarBill.
