Elucidating the three-dimensional structure of G-quadruplex with 9 -amino <b>acridines</b> and the specific interactions involved in binding selectivity are the key to understanding their mechanism of action. Fluorescence titration assays, competitive dialysis and NMR studies have been used to study the binding specificity of 9 -amino <b>acridines</b> to DNA. Structural models of the complexes with the telomeric DNA G-quadruplex based on NMR measurements were developed and further examined by molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations. Selective binding of 9 -amino <b>acridines</b> for G-quadruplex sequences were observed. These compounds bind between A and G-tetrads, involving significant p-p interactions and several strong hydrogen bonds. The specific interactions between different moieties of the 9 -amino <b>acridines</b> to the DNA were examined and shown to {{play a significant role in}} governing the overall stabilities of DNA G-quadruplex complexes. Both 9 -amino <b>acridines,</b> with similar binding affinities to the G-quadruplex, were shown to induce different level of structural stabilization through intercalation.

40|$|Under the {{framework}} of this PhD project, a study on chromatographic behaviour of selected azaarenes on octadecylsilica stationary phases during their separation by reversed phase liquid chromatography was developed. The main goal was aimed at an application of the basic RPLC principles on the retention behaviour of azaarenes including the effects such as peak tailing, peak broadening, irreproducible retention or strong retention on a stationary phase. This study was particularly focused on basic azaarenes, also called <b>acridines,</b> which belong {{to a group of}} persistent organic pollutants providing mutagenic and/or carcinogenic activity. The retention patterns were studied on a group of eight <b>acridines</b> that are often present in environmental samples polluted with polycyclic aromatic compounds. The mixture of <b>acridines</b> was separated under isocratic elution conditions on three octadecylsilica stationary phases using two different binary mixtures as a mobile phase. Evaluation of the surface properties of the selected stationary phases was firstly performed, followed by the separation experiments. The structure of the experiments was designed to evaluate the effect of three different factors on the retention behaviour of acridines: properties of a stationary phase, composition of a mobile phase and physical-chemical properties of <b>acridines.</b> The treatment of the results was based on the capacity factor values providing the best fitting and repeatability of data, but other parameters that evaluate thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of the separation process were also given. Simple correlations between the three factors and a character of retention mechanism of <b>acridines</b> on the given separation system were found. Application of this knowledge simplifies an optimisation process and helps to solve common separation problems for <b>acridines,</b> but also for other basic analytes displaying similar physical-chemical properties (Mr and pKa) ...|$|R

[...] Nucleobases are Watson-Crick base paired through hydrogen bonding, and these pairs are stacked {{through the center of}} the double helix through π-π interactions of their aromatic systems. [...] The possibility for extended planar aromatic systems such as <b>acridine</b> (dibenzopyridine) to insert between base pairs was recognised by Lerman in a process now known as intercalation. [...] Intercalating agents have applications in biochemical research as stains (ethidium bromide) and in medicine as chemotherapeutic agents (doxorubicin). [...] Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons like benzopyrenes and dibenzanthracene are some of the 43 known carcinogens in tobacco smoke (the Environment Protection Agency classes tobacco smoke as a class A carcinogen). Benzopyrene has been shown to form preferentially in lung cancer hotspots and is known to be transformed into a metabolite, (+)-Benzopyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide, which forms mutagenic adduct with DNA. [...] The epoxide and group on the metabolite alkylate the N2 of guanine bases while the pyrene system intercalates between base pairs, disrupting the structure. [...] Intercalation interferes with DNA replication which can inhibit tumour growth but can also cause changes in the base pair sequence which explains its potential for carcinogeneity.|$|E

40|$|The {{mutagenic}} {{properties of}} <b>acridines</b> on pneumococcus are described. All seven <b>acridines</b> tested were mutagenic at the amiA locus conferring a resistance to 10 - 5 m aminopterin. The effects of quinacrine were more specifically investigated. It was observed that: mutants {{can be obtained}} only by treatment of exponentially growing cells; a sharp maximum mutagenic effect occurs at a concentration slightly lower than the bacteriostatic value; {{and the amount of}} quinacrine required to yield the maximum mutagenic effect decreases with the pH of the medium. Moreover, the number of mutants detected after quinacrine treatment varies from locus to locus. The majority of quinacrine-induced mutants are readily reverted by quinacrine, but not by nitrosoguanidine treatment. This suggests that in pneumococcus quinacrine induces mainly frameshift mutations. A further study of the revertants obtained by quinacrine treatment of quinacrine-induced mutants strengthens this interpretation: most of the revertants result from a mutation at the same site; some partial revertants exhibiting an intermediate resistance to aminopterin were found to contain two very closely linked mutated sites, each mutation conferring the maximum level of resistance to aminopterin. Thus, the majority of quinacrine-induced mutants at the amiA locus of pneumococcus consists of frameshift mutations. Nearly all of the isolated mutants induced by quinacrine as well as other <b>acridines</b> belong to the low efficiency class of transformation. It was concluded that the mismatch resulting from the pairing between the wild type and the frameshift-containing sequence is recognized by the excision-repair system involved in the discrimination function in a way similar to that in which it recognizes mismatched base pairs between a transition mutation and the wild-type sequence...|$|R
