40|$|Cryo-electron {{microscopy}} (EM) {{and image}} processing {{have proven to}} be powerful tools for determining the three-dimensional (3 D) architecture of ryanodine receptors (RyRs). Over the past few years, 3 D models of RyRs have become available <b>at</b> <b>resolutions</b> <b>in</b> the range 25 - 35 Å for all the three isoforms that have been identified in mammals. The information available from 3 D reconstruction reveals the four-fold symmetric architecture of RyRs: an overall mushroom-shaped structure with a large cytoplasmic portion containing domainlike features, and a distinctive transmembrane assembly. Binding sites of various protein ligands (e. g., calmodulin, FK 506 -binding protein) that interact in vivo with RyR have been mapped onto the surface of RyRs using cryo-EM. Conformational changes in RyRs associated with calcium transport have also been characterized, by employing buffer conditions that favor the two different functional states, ’open ’ and ‘closed’. This review will discuss these results, and will demonstrate the utility of cryo-EM and 3 D image processing reconstruction in striving towards our ultimate goal of obtaining sufficient structural detail to elucidate the mechanism of excitation-contraction coupling in muscle...|$|E

The MEGARA focal plane subsystems are located {{at one of the}} GTC focal stations, while the MEGARA refractive VPH based spectrograph is located at one of the Nasmyth platforms. The fiber bundles conduct the light from the focal plane subsystems to the pseudo-slits at the entrance of the spectrograph. The project is an initiative led by Universidad Complutense de Madrid (Spain) in collaboration with INAOE (Mexico), IAA-CSIC (Spain) and Universidad Politecnica de Madrid (Spain) and is developed under contract with GRANTECAN. The project is carried out by a multidisciplinary and geographically distributed team, which includes the in-kind contributions of the project partners and personnel from several private companies. The MEGARA system-engineering plan has been tailored to the project and is being applied to ensure the technical control of the project in order to finally meet the science high-level requirements and GTC constrains...|$|E
40|$|High-resolution X-ray {{computed}} tomography (HRXCT) is a 3 D-imaging and analysis technique frequently {{used for the}} investigation of internal structures of a large variety of objects, including building materials. The 3 D information {{is important for the}} characterisation of internal dynamic processes (e. g., water and salt migration, the influence of temperature and/or relative humidity changes) in natural stone, mortars, bricks and concrete. One of the main advantages of HRXCT {{is the fact that it}} is a non-destructive characterization technique, which allows 3 D monitoring of internal structural changes <b>at</b> <b>resolutions</b> <b>in</b> the (sub) micrometre scale. Because of its non-destructive nature, it is possible to measure changes in porosity, evolution of micro-cracks, crystallization of salts and migration paths of liquids in the same rock sample over a specific time period. Driven by the technological and computational progress, the technique is continuously growing as an analysis tool in the Geosciences and is becoming an important method in the field of Cultural Heritage. In this manuscript, a short summary of the principle, the advantages and limitations of X-ray {{computed tomography}} are presented. In addition, an overview of some current applications of imaging dynamic processes (such as liquid migration, artificial stone weathering and treatment) is provided by means of HRXCT. This is demonstrated in studies related to conservation of Cultural Heritage...|$|E

40|$|Numerical weather {{prediction}} model forecasts at horizontal grid lengths {{in the range}} of 100  to 1  km are now possible. This range of scales is the "grey zone of turbulence". Previous studies, based on large-eddy simulation (LES) analysis from the MésoNH model, showed that some assumptions of some turbulence schemes on boundary-layer structures are not valid. Indeed, boundary-layer thermals are now partly resolved, and the subgrid remaining part of the thermals is possibly largely or completely absent from the model columns. First, some modifications of the equations of the shallow convection scheme have been tested in the MésoNH model and in an idealized version of the operational AROME model at resolutions coarser than 500  m. Secondly, although the turbulence is mainly vertical at mesoscale (>[*]  2  km resolution), it is isotropic in LES (<[*]  100  m resolution). It has been proved by LES analysis that, in convective boundary layers, the horizontal production of turbulence cannot be neglected at resolutions finer than half of the boundary-layer height. Thus, in the grey zone, fully unidirectional turbulence scheme should become tridirectional around 500  m resolution. At Météo-France, the dynamical turbulence is modelled by a K-gradient in LES as well as at mesoscale in both MésoNH and AROME, which needs mixing lengths in the formulation. Vertical and horizontal mixing lengths have been calculated from LES of neutral and convective cases <b>at</b> <b>resolutions</b> <b>in</b> the grey zone...|$|E
40|$|The project {{management}} of complex instruments for ground-based large telescopes {{is a challenge}} itself. A good management is a clue for project success in terms of performance, schedule and budget. Being on time has become a strict requirement for two reasons: to assure the arrival at the telescope due to the pressure on demanding new instrumentation for this first world-class telescopes and to not fall in over-costs. The budget and cash-flow {{is not always the}} expected one and has to be properly handled from different administrative departments at the funding centers worldwide distributed. The complexity of the organizations, the technological and scientific return to the Consortium partners and the participation in the project of all kind of professional centers working in astronomical instrumentation: universities, research centers, small and large private companies, workshops and providers, etc. make the {{project management}} strategy, and the tools and procedures tuned to the project needs, crucial for success.
