5|$|Shiva (Karthi) is a young, carefree, {{unemployed}} man {{staying in}} Bangalore. He has a loyal {{group of friends}} including his best friend, a young woman named Priya (Sonia Deepti) with whom he shares his feelings. His friends are determined to get him a job. One day he sees a young, beautiful woman named Charulatha (Tamannaah), who is <b>also</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> a job. Shiva is immediately attracted to her. He subsequently spots Charulatha on various occasions and follows her, but loses sight of her each time. He even misses a job interview Priya has arranged for him.|$|E
5|$|Like Sweden, John II Casimir was <b>also</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> {{allies to}} break the {{deadlock}} of the war. On 1 December 1656, he signed an alliance with Ferdinand III of Habsburg in Vienna, essentially a declaration of Ferdinand III's intend to mediate a peace rather than provide military aid, which did not come into effect until Ferdinand's death on 2 April 1657. The treaty was however renewed and amended on 27 May by Ferdinand's successor Leopold I of Habsburg, who agreed in Vienna to provide John II Casimir with 12,000 troops maintained at Polish expense; in return, Leopold received Kraków and Posen in pawn. Receiving the news, Frederick III of Denmark promptly declared war on Sweden, and by June the Austrian army entered the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth from the south, immediately stabilizing the situation in southern Poland, while Denmark attacked Swedish Bremen-Verden and turned to Jämtland and Västergötland in July.|$|E
5|$|Amy has non-playable {{roles in}} a number of other game plots. Her {{attraction}} to Sonic is useful to Cream and Blaze the Cat in Sonic Rush, since they are <b>also</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> him. In Shadow the Hedgehog, Amy appears at Cryptic Castle to ask him to help her find Cream, who has not returned. In the game's final story, unlocked after the player reaches the rest of the endings, Amy admiringly cheers Shadow on. In the 2006 Sonic the Hedgehog game, she mistakes Silver the Hedgehog for Sonic; when he tells her he is looking for someone, she insists on helping him. When Silver attacks Sonic, Amy finds them and blocks Silver's way (saving Sonic's life); he escapes, and Amy yells at Silver. She rescues Elise (who also likes Sonic, although Amy does not know this at the time) from confinement. In Sonic Lost World, Amy and Knuckles care for forest animals while Sonic and Tails rescue the animals' friends. The Deadly Six (the game's antagonists) control one of Eggman's machines to drain life from the world; Amy and Knuckles die, but are brought back to life when Sonic and Tails replenish it.|$|E

5|$|Both teams {{went into}} the match as the champions of their {{respective}} countries – {{the first time that}} the final had been contested by domestic champions since 1999, when Manchester United beat Bayern Munich 2–1 at Barcelona's home, the Camp Nou – both winning with games to spare. Manchester United won their 11th Premier League title with a 0–0 draw at home to Arsenal on 16 May, while Barcelona were confirmed as La Liga champions for the first time in three years when Real Madrid lost to Villarreal on the same day. Both Manchester United and Barcelona were <b>also</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> another Champions League title to cap a season in which they had won multiple trophies: Manchester United had already won four out of a possible seven trophies in 2008–09 and were playing for the possibility of becoming the third team to retain the European Double (the domestic league and the European Cup), while Barcelona were aiming to become the first Spanish club to win a Treble of La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the UEFA Champions League.|$|E
5|$|Seven matches {{remained}} on Bradman's quest {{to go through}} a tour of England without defeat. Johnson returned and made 15 of 361 as Australia batted first against Kent. Johnson was not asked to bowl as the first four bowlers used cut down the hosts' first innings for 51 in just 23 overs. It was a similar tale in the second innings after Australia enforced the follow on. The pacemen did the early damage and Johnson bowled only briefly, sending down 4.5 overs and removing the last two batsmen to end with 2/15 as the hosts fell for 124 in 32.5 overs to seal another Australian victory by an innings in two days. In the next match against the Gentlemen of England, Johnson did not bat before Australia declared at 5/610 against a team featuring eight Test players. When the tourists bowled, Johnson took three consecutive wickets to reduce the hosts from 1/76 to 4/121. He ended with 4/60 from 23 overs as the Gentlemen made 245. Johnson's victims included Donnelly, future England opener Reg Simpson and former England captain Walter Robins. Bradman enforced the follow on, and Johnson took the last three wickets to end with 3/69 from 28.5 overs, including the scalps of Robins and Test player Freddie Brown. This completed another innings victory for the tourists. Johnson broke through for his first century of the tour in the next match against Somerset. Australia batted first and Johnson came in at No. 6 with the score at 4/306 to join Ron Hamence, who was <b>also</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> his first ton of the season. The pair put on 195 runs, before Hamence fell at the closest possible point to his century, stumped for 99. Miller came out and helped Johnson add another 59 before Australia declared at 5/560, with the latter undefeated on 113. Following his innings, Johnson only bowled 10 overs in taking 1/19 for the match. The hosts were bowled out twice for a combined total of 186 from a sum of just 81.3 overs as Australia enforced the follow on and won by an innings and 374 runs. Johnson was rested for the fixture against the South of England. Australia declared at 7/522 and bowled out the hosts for 298 when rain ended the match.|$|E

25|$|In 1882 an Art School {{was founded}} in Port Elizabeth. The number of its members grew {{exponentially}} so new premises were sought after. In 1891 Dr Hewitt, {{the founder of the}} Young Men's Institute, was <b>also</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> premises for his society. In that very year the Photographic Society and Naturalist Society were founded and also sought premises in which to operate. The four societies thus came together to reinvigorate the Athenaeum.|$|E

25|$|As {{early as}} the late 1970s, the Bruins {{were looking for a}} new arena.

The team nearly moved to Salem, New Hampshire around where Rockingham Park is today. That fell through and the Bruins continued to reside in Boston Garden.

The next year Hunte was contracted by Enfield Cricket Club in the Lancashire League. The relationship between Hunte and Enfield was a happy one; unlike most professionals who tended to wander, Hunte stayed at the club for six seasons. In 1959, Hunte set a club record for the most runs scored in a season.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, the Royal Australian Air Force were <b>also</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> a Canberra replacement, and {{were looking at}} a number of options, {{including}} both TSR-2 and the General Dynamics F-111 then being developed for the USAF's TFX programme. The uncertainty over TSR-2 led to the Australians selecting an adapted version of the F-111 in 1963. The RAF were asked to evaluate the F-111 as a cheaper option for the strike aircraft requirement, although the incoming Labour government denied it planned to cancel the British aircraft. This denial was reversed in April 1965, when TSR-2 was cancelled and a decision taken to look into the option of acquiring up to 110 F-111s instead.|$|E
25|$|The Ninth Avenue branch—the main {{thoroughfare}} into Reading Terminal—was also improved. Between 1907-1914 the old double track and street level route {{was replaced by}} an elevated quadruple track route that offered greater capacity and safety. In 1901, the Reading gained a controlling interest in the Central Railroad of New Jersey, allowing the Reading to offer seamless, one-seat rides from Reading Terminal in Philadelphia to the CNJ's Jersey City Communipaw Terminal by way of Bound Brook onto the CNJ mainline. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was <b>also</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> access to the New York market, and in 1903 the B gained control over the Reading and thus ensured its trains track rights over the Reading and CNJ to Jersey City.|$|E

25|$|The {{ultimate}} {{result was}} that the Northern Pacific was left without a direct connection to Chicago, the primary interchange point {{for most of the}} large U.S. railroads. Fortunately, the Northern Pacific was not alone. James J. Hill, controller of the Great Northern, which was completed between the Twin Cities and Puget Sound in 1893, also lacked a direct connection to Chicago. Hill went looking for a road with an existing route between the Twin Cities and Chicago which could be rolled into his holdings and give him a stable path to that important interchange. At the same time, Edward Henry Harriman, head of the Union Pacific Railroad, was <b>also</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> a road which could connect his company to Chicago.|$|E
25|$|The game is {{regarded}} as one of the biggest upsets in the history of professional sports, as well as one of the finest Super Bowl games. The Patriots entered the game as 12-point favorites after becoming the first team to complete a perfect regular season since the 1972 Miami Dolphins, and the only one since the league expanded to a 16-game regular season schedule in 1978. The Giants, who finished the regular season with a 10–6 record, were seeking to become the first NFC wild card team to win a Super Bowl, and were <b>also</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> their third Super Bowl victory and first since they won Super Bowl XXV seventeen years earlier. This Super Bowl was also a rematch of the final game of the regular season, in which New England won, 38–35.|$|E
