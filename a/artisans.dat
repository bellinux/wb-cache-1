5|$|<b>Artisans</b> and {{craftsmen}} {{during the}} Han had a socio-economic status between that of farmers and merchants. Yet some {{were able to}} obtain a valuable income, such as one craftsman who made knives and swords {{and was able to}} eat food fit for nobles and officials. <b>Artisans</b> and craftsmen also enjoyed a legal status that was superior to merchants. Unlike lowly merchants, <b>artisans</b> were allowed by law to wear fancy silks, ride on horseback, and ride in carriages. There were also no laws which barred <b>artisans</b> from becoming officials. An artisan painter who worked at the Imperial Academy turned down many offers to become nominated for public office. In contrast, a bureaucrat who appointed a merchant as an official could suffer impeachment from office, while some even avoided nominations by claiming they were merchants.|$|E
5|$|All the inhabitants, {{including}} {{the young and}} elderly, were subject to a schedule of alternating work, religious practice, and rest. According to d'Orbigny, {{the inhabitants of the}} Chiquitos missions enjoyed considerably more freedom than those in the Mojos missions. There was also less time spent practicing religion. The catechumens were instructed by the Jesuits in various arts. They learned very quickly and soon became proficient carpenters, painters, weavers, sculptors and <b>artisans.</b> Each settlement had its own set of craftsmen; as a result, in addition to the caciques, a new social class of craftsmen and <b>artisans</b> emerged. This group {{and the rest of the}} population, who worked primarily in agriculture or cattle raising, were each represented by two alcaldes. Initially the main commercial products included honey, yerba maté, salt, tamarind, cotton, shoes, and leather. Later, <b>artisans</b> exported musical instruments, liturgical items, rosaries, and silverware.|$|E
5|$|Artists were {{classified}} as <b>artisans</b> since they were nonagricultural laborers who manufactured and decorated objects. The philosopher Wang Fu argued that urban society exploited the contributions of food-producing farmers while able-bodied men in the cities wasted their time (among other listed pursuits) crafting miniature plaster carts, earthenware statues of dogs, horses, and human figures of singers and actors, and children's toys. However, during Eastern Han some scholar-officials began engaging in crafts originally reserved for <b>artisans,</b> such as mechanical engineering. Emperor Ling commissioned the official Cai Yong (132192 CE) to paint portraits and produce eulogies for five generations of the prominent Yang clan of officials and military officers. This is the first recorded instance in China where a scholar-official was commissioned to write eulogies and paint portraits in conjunction, instead of relying on skilled <b>artisans</b> to do the painting.|$|E

40|$|Although {{the history}} of {{cheesemaking}} in the United States tells largely a tale of industrialization, there is a submerged yet continuous history of small-batch, hands-on, <b>artisan</b> cheese manufacture. This tradition, carried on in <b>artisan</b> cheese factories across the country, although concentrated in Wisconsin, is often overlooked by {{a new generation of}} <b>artisan</b> cheesemakers. Continuities in fabrication methods shared by preindustrial and post-industrial <b>artisan</b> creameries have been obscured by changes in the organization and significance of <b>artisan</b> production over the last one hundred years. Making cheese by hand has morphed from chore to occupation to vocation; from economic trade to expressive endeavor; from a craft to an art. American <b>artisan</b> cheesemaking tradition was invented and reinvented as a tradition of innovation. Indeed, ideological commitment to innovation as modern, progressive, American—and thus a marketable value—further obscures continuities between past and present, <b>artisan</b> factories, and new farmstead production. The social disconnect between the current <b>artisan</b> movement and American's enduring cheesemaking tradition reproduces class hierarchies even as it reflects growing equity in gendered occupational opportunities...|$|R
5|$|Although female life {{expectancy}} in Byzantium {{was lower than}} that of men, due to death in childbirth, wars and the fact that men married younger, female widowhood was still fairly common.

5|$|Cantonese people, {{like the}} Hakka, were well known {{throughout}} Southeast Asia as mineworkers. Their migration in the 19th century was largely {{directed toward the}} tin mines of Bangka, off {{the east coast of}} Sumatra. Notable traditionally as skilled <b>artisans,</b> the Cantonese benefited from close contact with Europeans in Guangdong and Hong Kong by learning about machinery and industrial success. They migrated to Java {{about the same time as}} the Hakka, but for different reasons. In Indonesia's cities they became <b>artisans,</b> machine workers, and owners of small businesses such as restaurants and hotel-keeping services. The Cantonese are evenly dispersed throughout the archipelago, and number far less than the Hokkien or the Hakka. Consequently, their roles are of secondary importance in the Chinese communities.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{their legal}} {{privileges}} over that of merchants, {{the work of}} <b>artisans</b> was considered by Han Confucian scholars to be of secondary importance to that of farmers. This is perhaps largely because scholars and officials could not survive without the farmer's product and taxes paid in grain. The government relied on taxed grain to fund its military campaigns and stored surplus grain to mitigate widespread famine during times of poor harvest. Despite the prominence given to farmers, Confucian scholars did accept that <b>artisans</b> performed a vital economic role. This view was only rejected by {{a small minority of}} Legalists, who advocated a society of only soldiers and farmers, and certain Daoists who wanted everyone to live in self-sufficient villages and without commercial interests.|$|E
5|$|Missouri was {{admitted}} {{as a slave}} state. During the 1840s, the number of slaves increased but their percentage relative to the population declined; during the 1850s, both the number and percentage declined.

5|$|Royal <b>artisans</b> were {{sometimes}} responsible for sculpting stelae; {{in some cases}} these sculptors were actually the sons of kings. In other cases {{it is likely that}} captive <b>artisans</b> from defeated cities were put to work raising stelae for the victors, as evidenced by the sculptural style of one city appearing upon monuments of its conqueror soon after its defeat. This appears to have been the case in Piedras Negras where Stela12 depicting war captives submitting to the victorious king is carved in the style of Pomoná, the defeated city. Archaeologists believe that this may also have been the case with Quiriguá after its surprise defeat of its overlord Copán.|$|E

5|$|While medieval Indian <b>artisans</b> {{preferred}} to remain anonymous, Hoysala <b>artisans</b> signed their works, which has given researchers details about their lives, families, guilds, etc. Apart from the architects and sculptors, {{people of other}} guilds such as goldsmiths, ivory carvers, carpenters, and silversmiths {{also contributed to the}} completion of temples. The <b>artisans</b> were from diverse geographical backgrounds and included famous locals. Prolific architects included Amarashilpi Jakanachari, a native of Kaidala in Tumkur district, who also built temples for the Western Chalukyas. Ruvari Malithamma built the Kesava Temple at Somanathapura and worked on forty other monuments, including the Amruteshwara temple at Amruthapura. Malithamma specialised in ornamentation, and his works span six decades. His sculptures were typically signed in shorthand as Malli or simply Ma. Dasoja and his son Chavana from Balligavi were the architects of Chennakesava Temple at Belur; Kedaroja was the chief architect of the Hoysaleswara Temple at Halebidu. Their influence is seen in other temples built by the Hoysalas as well. Names of other locals found in inscriptions are Maridamma, Baicoja, Caudaya, Nanjaya and Bama, Malloja, Nadoja, Siddoja, Masanithamma, Chameya and Rameya. Artists from Tamil country included Pallavachari and Cholavachari.|$|E
