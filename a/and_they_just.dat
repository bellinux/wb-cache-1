25|$|When the {{publisher}} PlayFirst's blog staff interviewed with the game's producer Ryan Sindledecker, he gave players an in depth look at Dream Chronicles: The Book of Air. Taking about {{coming up with}} the new features, Ryan shared that the developer, Kat Games came up with all the new features, including using Dream Jewels as powers. With each Dream Chronicles game, Dream Jewels were used differently. In The Book of Air there was a need to add these powers and a need to have a new use for the Jewels <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> fit together perfectly. After the Standard Edition of the game was released, Sindledecker uploaded a special walkthrough for The Book of Air on PlayFirst's blog.|$|E

I wrote it years ago, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> keep rolling it over on IMDb. Paramount—what can I say?" [...] When asked about the sequel that June, Green said [...] "The Brazilian Job doesn't exist actually" [...] and called it a [...] "wonderful myth of IMDb." [...] However, the next month, Mark Wahlberg said that sequel production was [...] "active" [...] again.|$|E
500|$|Dylan has cited [...] "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)" [...] {{as one of}} {{his songs}} that means the most to him. In 1980 he stated that [...] "I don't think I could sit down now and write 'It's Alright, Ma' again. [...] I wouldn't even know where to begin, but I can still sing it." [...] In 1997, Dylan told The New York Times, [...] "I've written some songs that I look at, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> give me a sense of awe. Stuff like, 'It's Alright, Ma,' just the alliteration in that blows me away." ...|$|E

500|$|Disney, {{which had}} no {{intention}} of producing a sequel, rejected Tribune's claim and gave Beatty back most of the rights in May 2005. That same month, Beatty filed a lawsuit in the Los Angeles, California Superior Court seeking $30 million in damages against the Tribune and a declaration over the rights. Bertram Fields, Beatty's lawyer, said the original 1985 agreement with the Tribune was negotiated specifically to allow Beatty a chance to make another Dick Tracy film. [...] "It was very carefully done <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> ignored it," [...] he stated. [...] "The Tribune is a big, powerful company and they think they can just run roughshod over people. They picked the wrong guy." ...|$|E
500|$|Ariana Richards said, [...] "I {{was called}} into a casting office, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> {{wanted me to}} scream. I heard later on that Steven had watched a few girls on tape that day, and I {{was the only one}} who ended up waking his {{sleeping}} wife off the couch, and she came running through the hallway to see if the kids were all right." [...] Joseph Mazzello had initially screen-tested for a role in Hook, but was deemed too young. Spielberg promised Mazzello that they would work together on a future film. Robin Wright turned down a role in the film. Christina Ricci auditioned for a role, but did not receive it.|$|E
500|$|Not knowing at {{the time}} that he would be {{referring}} to deleted scenes, Andrew Lincoln told Entertainment Weekly, [...] "I remember going on set for the season premiere and seeing a couple of the prop guys, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> looked at me as they gave me my gun and they went, 'You know, in this episode we kill more zombies than in the whole of Season 1.' They actually counted the kills! And when it came time for the taking-of-the-courtyard scene, that was just carnage." [...] He added, [...] "It really wasn't that well plotted. We just got sent zombies towards us and we had to improvise stabbing, so it was a bit touch-and-go from time to time." ...|$|E

500|$|During production, the film's English {{title was}} changed from The Snow Queen to Frozen, a {{decision}} that drew comparisons to another Disney film, Tangled. Peter Del Vecho explained that [...] "the title Frozen came up independently of the title Tangled. It's because, to us, it represents the movie. Frozen plays {{on the level of}} ice and snow but also the frozen relationship, the frozen heart that has to be thawed. We don't think of comparisons between Tangled and Frozen, though." [...] He also mentioned that the film will still retain its original title, The Snow Queen, in some countries: [...] "because that just resonated stronger in some countries than Frozen. Maybe there's a richness to The Snow Queen in the country's heritage <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> wanted to emphasize that." ...|$|E
500|$|In a November 2003 {{interview}} with Mike Wallace {{on the television}} news magazine 60 Minutes, Taylor claimed he hired and sent prostitutes to opponents' hotel rooms the night before a game {{in an attempt to}} tire them out, and that at his peak, he spent thousands of dollars a day on narcotics. He also recounted several other instances of aberrant behavior, including arriving to a team meeting during his playing career in handcuffs after spending a night with some call girls. He said, [...] "A couple of ladies that were trying out some new equipment they had. You know? And I just happened to, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> didn't happen to have the key." [...] He also said that to beat NFL drug tests, he routinely submitted the urine of his teammates.|$|E
500|$|Talking further about Scritti Politti, a British post-punk band, Minogue reminisced {{about her}} {{collaboration}} with the band's frontman Green Gartside, who provides vocals on the track [...] "Someday", saying, [...] "To this day I haven't met him! I {{left a message on}} his answering machine, saying, [...] "Hi, it's Kylie! I just wanted to say thanks so much! You sound brilliant!" [...] "After Dark" [...] was co-written by Dennis, who had previously co-written [...] "Can't Get You Out of My Head" [...] for Minogue. Torrini, who co-wrote [...] "Slow", revealed how she was approached for writing the song, saying [...] "It was like I had just accidentally walked into the line of fire with, [...] "Hey! You There! It was all quite surreal. I still think Kylie's people were trying to call Jamelia, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> got the wrong number.

500|$|The {{popularity}} of SpongeBob translated well into sales figures. In 2002, SpongeBob SquarePants dolls {{sold at a}} rate of 75,000 per week, which was faster than Tickle Me Elmo dolls were selling at the time. SpongeBob has gained popularity in Japan, specifically with Japanese women. Nickelodeon's parent company Viacom purposefully targeted marketing at women in the country as a method of the SpongeBob SquarePants brand. Skeptics initially doubted that SpongeBob could be popular in Japan as the character's design is very different from already popular designs for Hello Kitty and Pikachu. Nickelodeon also expanded the merchandising of the show, bringing it around $500 million revenue. It was reported that SpongeBob-themed goods are the best-selling character merchandise at Hot Topic store at Park City Center. T-shirts, pillows, shoelaces, pins, sunglasses, and air fresheners were sold [...] "extremely well if they have SpongeBob's likeness on them," [...] said Erin Aguirre, lead sales associate of Hot Topic. He added [...] " [...] come in <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> jump right into it. [...] "Did you see last week's episode?' They totally talk all about it, just that it's funny, that it's hilarious." ...|$|E
500|$|The 1974 {{documentary}} film Hearts and Minds, which {{was critical of}} the United States' role in the Vietnam War, featured Coker briefly. Coker, {{at the time of}} filming, had recently returned from {{six and a half years}} of internment in North Vietnamese camps for American prisoners of war– where he had endured torture and other mistreatment by his captors. The film shows a homecoming parade in his honor in his hometown of Linden, New Jersey, where he tells the assembled crowd on the steps of city hall that if the need arose, that they must be ready to send him back to war. Answering a student's question about what Vietnam looked like, he responded: [...] "Well, if it wasn't for the people, it was very pretty. The people over there are very backward and very primitive, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> make a mess out of everything." [...] Time magazine's Stefan Kanfer criticized the lack of balance in the film's portrayal of Coker, noting that [...] "he camera, which amply records the agonies of South Vietnamese political prisoners, seems uninterested in the American lieutenant's experience of humiliation and torture." ...|$|E
500|$|Mudvayne guitarist Greg Tribbett {{approached}} Maxwell [...] "out of the blue" [...] {{and wanted}} to join the band. Nothingface drummer Tommy Sickles originally helmed the drum kit for the band's demo, however, things did not work out {{and the search for}} a new drummer began. The band knew former Pantera and Damageplan drummer Vinnie Paul, and tried to persuade him to join the band as their drummer. Originally, Paul was not sure if he would return to music {{after the death of his}} brother, Dimebag Darrell and an 18-month hiatus: [...] "It was one of those things that I didn't think I'd be apart of this ever again without him, and after about a year and a half had gone by, these guys called me up, Chad [...] and Tom , they were like, 'We're thinking about putting this band together, would you be into it?' First couple of times, I told them, 'No, I don't think I'm ready to do this yet.' <b>And</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> were real persistent, they kept calling me. And one night, I had been drinking some red wine and listening to some KISS on 12" [...] vinyl record and I said, 'You know what, lets take a shot at this, lets see what happens.'" ...|$|E

500|$|... "Slow" [...] {{was written}} by Kylie Minogue, Dan Carey, and Emilíana Torrini, and {{produced}} by Carey, Torrini, and Sunnyroads. In 2009, Torrini explained how she was approached for writing the song, saying [...] "It was like I had just accidentally walked into {{the line of fire}} with, [...] "Hey! You There! It was all quite surreal. I still think Kylie's people were trying to call Jamelia, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> got the wrong number. It'd be much more funny if that is how it actually happened". Musically, the song is an eighties-inspired synthpop track. It utilises a very simple and [...] "minimalist" [...] style of production and was described as an [...] "electro-pop/disco fusion with percolating crackle-and-pop beats and sugary vocal overdubs" [...] by Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine. Additionally, it contains elements of electroclash and club music. Through the lyrics of the song, Minogue urges a man, whom she meets at a club, to [...] "slow down" [...] and dance with her. According to Minogue, the lyrics of the song are about [...] " [...] how time and space have a different meaning when you meet someone". She further said that she [...] "loved the way the song had this push-pull effect; the musical and lyrical combination gives you a sense of that".|$|E
500|$|One major {{breakthrough}} was {{the composition of}} the song [...] "Let It Go" [...] by songwriters Lopez and Anderson-Lopez, which forced the production team to reconceptualize and rewrite Elsa as a far more complex, vulnerable, and sympathetic character. In The Daily Telegraphs words, instead of the villain envisioned by the producers, the songwriters saw Elsa as [...] "a scared girl struggling to control and come to terms with her gift." [...] Lee recalled: [...] "Bobby and Kristen said they were walking in Prospect Park <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> started talking about what would it feel like [...] Forget villain. Just what it would feel like. And this concept of letting out who she is that she's kept to herself for so long and she's alone and free, but then the sadness of the fact [...] that the last moment is she's alone. It’s not a perfect thing, but it's powerful." [...] Del Vecho explained that [...] "Let It Go" [...] changed Elsa into a person [...] "ruled by fear and Anna was ruled by her own love of other people and her own drive," [...] which in turn caused Lee to [...] "rewrite the first act and then that rippled through the entire movie. So that was when we really found the movie and who these characters were." ...|$|E
500|$|Allegations of sexism {{occurred}} {{following a}} statement by Lino DiSalvo, the film's head of animation, who said to Fan Voice's Jenna Busch: [...] "Historically speaking, animating female characters are really, really difficult, {{because they have to}} go through these range of emotions, but you have to keep them pretty." [...] However, a Disney spokesperson later told Time that DiSalvo's quote was widely misinterpreted, stating that he was [...] "describing some technical aspects of CG animation and not making a general comment on animating females versus males or other characters." [...] Director Lee also said that DiSalvo's words were recklessly taken out of context, and that he was talking in very technical terms about CG animation. [...] "It is hard no matter what the gender is. I felt horrible for him," [...] she said. In an August 2014 interview, DiSalvo re-emphasized what he had been trying to explain all along when his statements were taken out of context– the difficulty with turning any kind of animated character from a series of sketches on a 2D emotion model sheet into a properly rigged 3D character model: [...] "Translating that emotional range onto a CG character {{is one of the most}} difficult parts of the process. Male. Female. Snowman. Animal." [...] He added, [...] "The really sad thing is people took that... catchy headline <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> repopulated it everywhere. People didn't get back to me for comments and the sad thing is that's the way the internet works. They don't want the truth." ...|$|E

2500|$|The film officially began {{principal}} {{photography in}} March 2010, {{but due to}} its large cast, producer/director Farrelly told Entertainment Weekly that [...] "This movie was made over four years, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> {{had to wait for}} a year or two years for different actors. They would shoot for a week, and shut down for several months. Same thing with the directors. It was the type of movie you could come back to." [...] Shortly before shooting, writers Parker, Stone, and the Zuckers backed out.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the intense}} and careful {{screening}} that most {{who wish to}} adopt children must go through, sometimes the adoption does not succeed. The child may have developmental or psychological issues that the parents cannot handle, had not been informed of prior to the adoption, or both. Or the parents may have had unrealistic expectations of the child, <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> may not get along. [...] The adoptive parents themselves may have psychological or family issues themselves that led them down the path to adopt. [...] These adoptive parents adopt thinking that the new child in their life will somehow enhance their life.|$|E
2500|$|Gilmour later said, [...] "When {{we first}} started playing World Series Cricket, I think we {{lost a lot of}} friends ... not player-wise, I don't think ... the players are OK. It's the {{officials}} that take a bit of swaying again... There were officials with the cricket association who I regarded as good friends and I had drinks with them whenever I was in Sydney or whenever they were in Newcastle. And they started treating me and the other players in WSC like lepers. I think that was the most hurtful thing of all. It was something that they didn't go along with <b>and</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> couldn't handle it".".|$|E
