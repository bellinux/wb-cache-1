When the generator is on the ground, then the tethered aircraft need not carry the generator mass or have a conductive tether. When the generator is aloft, then a conductive tether would be used to transmit energy to the ground or used aloft or beamed to receivers using microwave or laser. Kites and 'helicopters' come down when there is insufficient wind; kytoons and blimps may resolve the matter with other disadvantages. Also, bad weather such as lightning or thunderstorms, could temporarily suspend use of the machines, probably requiring them to be brought back down to the ground and covered.

40|$|As {{the focus}} on the {{environment}} and how to produce ?clean? and renewable energy takes a lot of focus these days, the research on this field is constantly increasing. Especially in the shipping industry there are frequently new rules and limitations being set into force. To keep up with these restrictions one needs to think outside the box and develop new ways to make it possible to keep the fuel consumption down, thus becoming more environmentally friendly. AWTs (<b>Airborne</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>Turbines)</b> {{could be one of the}} options. An AWT operates on the same aerodynamic principles as a conventional <b>wind</b> <b>turbine.</b> It is connected with a tether to the ground, utilizing stronger wind high above ground, inducing large enough lift forces on the wing to keep it flying. The wing will then go into a crosswind motion and it will be able to achieve a fairly high incoming velocity. By mounting turbines on the wing, it will then be possible to produce power. The power equation is proportional to the incoming wind speed cubed, and due to the high incoming velocity the potential power output of the AWT is therefore very high. In this master thesis it will be explored if it could be possible to mount an AWT on a ship to assist the propulsion. Also the forces on the wing have been calculated in order to check how large wind speed is needed in order for the wing to stay aloft. A big concern to this idea is the forces in the tether. The idea will be considered feasible if the thrust to the propeller given by the produced power of the wing is higher than the resistance on the ship due to the horizontal forces in the tether. The calculations show that a minimum wind speed of 4. 5 [m/s] is needed for the wing to stay aloft. The propulsion given to the propeller from the power production of the wing is for all ship speeds too low to consider the idea feasible. </p...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S., Mechanical Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2014. The United States {{is highly}} {{dependent}} on fossil fuels as a primary source of energy. An interest in viable {{renewable sources of energy}} is on the rise given the cost and availability of petroleum based energy. A source of untapped renewable energy exists in the winds of the Polar and Subtropical jet streams. An <b>airborne</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> with stable flight characteristics over a range of wind velocities is required to access these winds and transfer the energy to the ground for use. Three-dimensional (3 -D) solid models were designed in the Solid Works CAD program. These solid models were imported into Ansys Workbench where two-dimensional (2 -D) cross-section meshes of the flow field and model were generated. The 2 -D cross-sections were analyzed in Ansys Fluent for aerodynamic performance with an emphasis on Coefficient of Lift (Cl), Coefficient of Drag (Cd), and Coefficient of Moment (Cm) values. Experimental values of Cl and Cd were used to validate Fluent simulation results. The baseline proof of concept <b>airborne</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> resulted in partial longitudinal statically stable flight over the range of attack angles studied. Analysis of the wing design (V 1) revealed that sufficient lift was not generated by the <b>airborne</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> using the V 1 wing design. In order for this technology to become a viable method of energy production further investigation of a rigid airfoil <b>airborne</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> design should continue.

40|$|Buoyant {{airborne}} {{wind turbines}} are devices capable of harnessing stronger winds at higher altitudes {{and with their}} automated and rapidly deployable system they are suited to niche applications such as emergency power generation. Although much of the wind turbine technology for these systems is common with their ‘grounded’ cousins, an additional design limitation is the requirement for the wind turbine equipment to be lightweight. This paper concentrates on the drivetrain of the wind turbine and the different potential ways of reducing its mass. A buoyant <b>airborne</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> with different types of drivetrains, going from gearless to geared systems with distinct gear ratios, has been analysed. Special {{attention was paid to}} the mass of the supporting structure of the permanent magnet electrical generator and this was minimized by utilising low density materials, such as composites, in its design. The model showed that a significant reduction in the mass of the drivetrain can be achieved in the gearless case by using materials with a higher ratio of Young’s Modulus to density for the electrical machine supporting structure. For the geared systems, mass decrease was less significant as the gearbox mass had also to be considered. Keywords: Airborne, lightweight, generator structure, composite material...|$|E
40|$|<b>Airborne</b> <b>wind</b> {{energy systems}} provide a novel {{solution}} to harvest wind energy from altitudes {{that can not}} be reached by <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> with a similar nominal generator power. The use of a lightweight but strong tether in place of an expensive tower provides an additional cost advantage, next to the higher capacity factor and much lower total mass. This paper investigates the scaling e ects of <b>airborne</b> <b>wind</b> energy systems. The energy yield of <b>airborne</b> <b>wind</b> energy systems, that work in pumping mode of operation is at least ten times higher than the energy yield of conventional solar systems. For <b>airborne</b> <b>wind</b> energy systems the yield is defined per square meter wing area. In this paper the dependency of the energy yield on the nominal generator power for systems in the range of 1 kW to 1 MW is investigated.

40|$|It is the {{objective}} of this graduation research to determine the nations with the highest deployment opportunity for airborne wind energy (AWE) generation systems. Compared to conventional, ground based, wind energy systems, the flying structure of the <b>airborne</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> substitutes the rotor blades and a tether substitutes the tower. These systems have the potential to harvest electricity against much lower cost, will soon become commercially available, and could take a significant share of the growing wind energy market. A unique top down approach is applied by analyzing all 193 United Nations member states with a combination of the conjunctive screening method with PROMETHEE-AHP multi criteria decision making. First, a set of conjunctive screening rules will determine if the basic conditions for wind energy are present. Nations which satisfy these rules are subject to a detailed multi criteria analysis. The unique set of relevant criteria in this analysis are determined from a combination of the renewable energy planning, and international business literature in combination with the view of airborne wind energy experts. The relative importance of these criteria is determined with an expert survey, based on the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), at which 26 experts participated from various background. A novel extension to the classical AHP weight factor calculation methodology is proposed, verified and applied to verify the breakdown of criteria into sub criteria. The results of this study are compared with the current activity in airborne and conventional wind energy. This study was able to select the nations with (airborne) wind energy activity. However this study also showed that many nations with high opportunities in airborne wind have no current activity in this field. Additionally it was found that nations, which are characterized by the highest installed capacity do not necessarily have a highest opportunity for airborne wind and vice versa. Hence many airborne wind resources in nations with high opportunity for airborne wind are still untapped and offer a great potential for future energy harvesting. Due to many similarities of the technologies, the conventional wind energy industry can also benefit from the results of this study.
