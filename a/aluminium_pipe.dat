40|$|Solar–thermal {{power plants}} are being {{deployed}} world-wide. These plants have traditionally used steel absorber pipes. Two types of fluids {{have been used}} in such ventures, synthetic aromatic fluid or water. Fluid flow in parabolic trough systems leads to instability in the tube due to the concentrated solar flux on only one-half of the absorber tube, resulting in temperature asymmetricity. The resulting stresses cause deflection and bending of the tube. This paper deals with direct steam systems and proposes incorporation of internal helical fins within the tube to reduce temperature variation. The fins provide an orderly distribution of flow from the ‘hot ’ to the ‘cold ’ side of the tube. A CFD simulation was carried out for three fin pitches, and an <b>aluminium</b> <b>pipe</b> without fins. The effect on heat transfer improvement and temperature asymmetry is presently reported.

40|$|In {{this project}} the {{feasibility}} of friction stir welding (FSW) of <b>Aluminium</b> alloy <b>pipe</b> with Stainless Steel plate is investigated. Aluminium alloy and Stainless Steel are widely used in aerospace, automotive, marine, defense, construction etc. due to their high strength, low weight, high machinability, good conductivity of heat and electricity etc. Friction stir welding is preferred for joining these materials {{as it is a}} solid state forge welding process and problems related with welding of Aluminium alloys and stainless steel can be subdued through this process. This welding process is a solid state welding procedure that uses a non-consumable rotating tool that is permitted to rub against the work piece hence generating frictional heat. When the weld constraints such as tool or work piece rotation speed, welding time, axial load are optimum the friction between the work piece and the tool generates enough heat to create a plastic deformation layer at the weld interface. The process doesn’t involve any melting process and whole process occurs in solid state through plastic deformation and mass flow among the work pieces. The experimental investigation of FSW is done by varying the friction stir welding parameters such as work piece rotation speed, welding time, feed (axial load). The work piece is rotated at the speeds 860 rpm, 1400 rpm and 2000 rpm. The experiment is done in a general purpose center lathe machine. To hold the work piece a fixture is designed.

This includes investigation of an alternative hull for the glider and design of a pitch and roll control mechanism. The glider body is currently constructed of ABS pipe. Changing the body to aluminium was investigated. It was concluded that due to mass constraints, the inside diameter {{will need to be}} modified. As this is a detailed procedure, the switch to <b>aluminium</b> <b>pipe</b> has been postponed. The IOT glider moves using changes in the glider?s volume, and therefore buoyancy. This change carries with it a change in pitch as well. However, fine-tuning of pitch angle is not currently possible.

This system slides the vehicle?s battery pack forward and aft to adjust trim and offsets the battery pack to the left or right of centerline to adjust roll. In this manner the CG of the vessel is manipulated causing the orientation of the vehicle to change.

40|$|The flow {{behaviour}} of the rapidly solidified Al- 5 Cr- 2 Zr alloy investigated {{in this study}} is well described by the power law creep. Based on the stress sensitivity and the activation energy for creep encountered, three temperature ranges were defined: a low temperature range from 298 to 523 K with n > 20 and Qc = 77 kJ mol- 1, an intermediate temperature range from 573 to 673 K with n close to 8 and Qc = 167 kJ mol- 1, and a high temperature range from 723 to 823 K with n close to 8 and Qc = 273 kJ mol- 1. In the low temperature range, creep rate is controlled by <b>aluminium</b> <b>pipe</b> diffusion. The high value of n > 20 could not be associated with any diffusion controlled dislocation creep mechanism. This behaviour can be rationalized using a substructure invariant model with a stress exponent of 10 and a threshold stress. In the intermediate temperature range, creep rate is controlled by aluminium lattice self-diffusion. The stress exponent and the activation energy obtained are consistent with the substructure invariant creep model. In the high temperature range, although the stress exponent suggests that creep may be explained by the substructure invariant model, the apparent activation energy is much higher than the activation energy for self-diffusion of pure aluminium, which may be attributed to the coarsening of dispersoids.

Indentation of unpressurized and pressurized pipes was caused by a rigid sphere and resulted in short smooth dents of depths up to 16 per cent of pipe diameter. Strain changes on the external pipe surface were monitored by strain gauges and a photoelastic coating. The results identify two stationary crescent-shaped regions of high external strain at the axial extremities of the initial dent, where strain concentration factors of 10 were recorded in the early (elastic) stages of pressurization, increasing to a maximum of 28 in one particular dent. The results have immediate application to the assessment of a gouge within a dent, which has long been recognized as the most severe form of mechanical damage to pipelines and can result in failures at very low internal pressures. A parallel series of burst tests by the authors revealed that gouges located near the axial extremities of the initial dent may cause premature failure.

The objective of this thesis is to develop the general procedures of analyzing the existing design of Shell Eco-marathon car chassis and designing a new chassis with several enhancements using aluminium as material. The thesis describes finite element analysis techniques to predict the displacement magnitude and identify the worst stress locates in the structures. Stainless steel AISI type 304 and aluminium alloy T 6 6063 were studied in this thesis which commonly used for a chassis structure in industry. The structural of three-dimensional solid modeling of the chassis was developed using Solidworks software. The strategy of validation of finite element model was developed. The finite element analysis was then performed using ALGOR Fempro. Both chassis structure was analyzed using the static stress with linear material models approaches. Finally, the displacement magnitude of the structure and worst stress are obtained. From the results, it is observed that the displacement magnitude of new chassis is decreasing about 40 % compared to the existing design. The existing design which used the stainless steel as material selection also is found to have higher worst stress compared with the aluminium chassis. Besides, comparing both designs founds the overall chassis weight of aluminium chassis is reduced about 30 %. The obtained results indicate that using aluminium gives the chassis structure higher stiffness and light in weight.

It {{is now clear that}} the evidence on Iraq 2 ̆ 7 s weapons of mass destruction programs presented by the Government to the public before the war was inaccurate and misleading. Further inquiries to prove this point are unnecessary. The fact is, the intelligence agencies did not have a clear picture of Iraq 2 ̆ 7 s WMD capabilities after the United Nations inspectors left in 1998. The heavy reliance on United States satellite imagery and defector reports led to a series of speculative and unsubstantiated claims.

And the CIA is still trying to repair the damage to its reputation over the <b>aluminium</b> <b>pipes</b> case.

To enable methane fuelling, the carburator of the GX 35 was replaced with a gas fuel injector from the engine accessory company Ecotrons. This was attached to an <b>aluminium</b> intake <b>pipe</b> constructed by the project group. A new flywheel was constructed, equipped with twelve magnetic detection points instead of one for more accurate detection of the crankshaft position. A magnet was also attached to the upper cam pulley to enable position detection. The original exhaust system was replaced by a holder of a lambda sensor and a straight exhaust pipe. Together with the engine control unit (ECU) KATLA, developed earlier for a bachelor’s thesis at Chalmers, this enabled detailed control of ignition and fuel injection, as well as measurement of the air-fuel ratio. In order to test the engine with a load, a brake device was constructed. A moped was acquired, whose gearbox and rear brake was used to brake and gear down the output shaft of the methane engine. The flywheel of the methane engine was connected to the flywheel of the moped through a vibration reducing rubber disc and a steel adapter. The rear wheel of the moped was lifted from the ground with a support so that it could rotate freely. By doing this, the load of the engine could be controlled with the rear brake pedal of the moped. Methane was not available for the project group, so the engine was tested with liquefied petroleum gas instead, which is another gaseous fuel.

This permits the relatively high residual radiation fields around PET targets to be moved ~ 1 metre away from the cyclotron, and facilitates the use of local shielding (around the targets) that limits prompt gammas and neutrons, but more importantly attenuates the residual target radiation, so that maintenance/research staff can work on the cyclotron in a relatively low activity environment. In addition, the mini-beamline for PET utilizes a compound quadrupole/steerer doublet that permits active and dynamic focusing/steering of the extracted proton beam for optimized production and minimized losses [3], so it improves on the successful work of Theroux et al [6]. The integrated beamline unit is extremely small, so that it is very unlike bulky traditional PET and SPECT beamlines that require substantial support structures, such as described by Dehnel in [7, 8]. Material and Methods The ISOTRACE™ cyclotron is pictured in FIG. 1. The exit port flange and gate valve to which the integrated mini-beamline for PET shall be mounted is shown. Immediately upstream of the exit port, hidden from view, is a 4 jaw collimator (called BPI for Beam Position Indicator) with spilled beam current readbacks to the control system. TABLE 1 shows the nominal beam emittance and Twiss parameter values at the exit port flange location. This ion-optical information is necessary to simulate ion beam transport, develop the mini-beamline, and determine a nominal tune (i. e. magnet settings). Results and Conclusion TABLE 2 shows the ion-optical system parameters. FIGS. 2 and 3 show the horizontal and vertical beam profiles. The Horizontally focusing Quadrupole magnet (HQ), and Vertically focusing Quadrupole magnet (VQ) aperture diameter, 33 mm, was chosen to give sufficient beam acceptance. The focusing strength is a function of BL, so the effective length, L = 150 mm, was chosen to ensure Bmax less than 0. 3 Tesla, while keeping overall magnet mass down. The quad-rupole magnets are fitted with water-cooled compound coils in which the copper/mylar strip wound portion of each coil is a winding for the quadrupole focusing function, and the wire wound portion is for the steering function. To increase beam acceptance and provide additional section strength for the pipe support function, the internal aperture of the low-activation <b>aluminium</b> beam <b>pipe</b> and the external shape are {{in the shape of a}} cross. FIG. 4 shows the beam crosssection at the mid-point of the downstream quadrupole magnet, and illustrates the additional acceptance as compared to a round beampipe. In order to machine the interior profile, the pipe is comprised of two premachined pieces that are friction stirwelded together. FIG. 5 is an isometric of the mini-beamline for PET. The four upstream HQ compound coils are excited with a 75 A power supply for the horizontally focusing quadrupole magnet function, and a ± 10 A power supply for a vertical steering function. The same power supplies are used for the four downstream VQ compound coils for the purpose of a vertically focusing quadrupole magnet function and horizontal steering function...|$|R
