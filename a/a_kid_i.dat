When I was <b>a</b> <b>kid,</b> <b>I</b> was being abused by someone else. I don't really {{like to talk about}} that song." [...] Some 14 minutes into [...] "Daddy"—well after the song has ended—a hidden track begins to play.

Gates appeal to me because of the negative space they allow. They can be closed but at the same time they allow the seasons and breezes to enter and flow. They can shut you out or shut you in.

500|$|Speaking to Phil Symes of Disc and Music Echo in May 1971, Ronnie Spector {{admitted}} that she had hated being away from the music industry. The situation had been forced on her by her husband's semi-retirement in 1966, following the failure in America of Ike & Tina Turner's single [...] "River Deep – Mountain High", a production that Phil Spector had considered his masterpiece. Ronnie Spector told Symes: [...] "For four years Phil and I completely detached ourselves from everyone {{in the business and}} settled down in California.

Loup said that when he was thirteen, [...] "My dad had me in the backyard almost every day—or at least it seemed that way. I was always doing something, whether it was pitching off the mound or hitting in the cage. I wanted to play baseball and knew that I needed to work hard to get there.

[...] Like several other future professionals from the area, he played football for Wallsend Boys Club.

500|$|The band's {{debut album}} {{warranted}} a Parental Advisory label {{because of the}} album's lyrics. Many of Korn's first works are based on early experiences.

On The Graham Norton Show, Gaga explained the origin of the song, which involves the analogy of her hair with freedom, and how that is the only part of her body she can change without anyone judging her. According to a press listening in February, [...] "Hair" [...] draws inspiration from Pat Benatar's '80s classic [...] "We Belong", while thematically focusing on empowering lyrics similar to those of [...] "Born This Way". Gaga elaborated on the song's inspiration further with a video posted on her Twitter account: [...] "When I was <b>a</b> <b>kid,</b> <b>I</b> used to always come down the stairs of my parents' house, and they would say, 'Go back upstairs and brush your hair, change your clothes, you can't go out wearing that', and I felt like it was stifling my identity...

Cruz commented on the experience, [...] "I was very extroverted as <b>a</b> <b>kid....</b> <b>I</b> was studying when I was in high school at night, I was in ballet and I was doing castings. I looked for an agent and she sent me away three times because I was a little girl but I kept coming back. I'm still with her after all these years." [...] In 1989, at the age of 15, Cruz won an audition at a talent agency over more than 300 other girls.

According to Smith, while her invented world was not perfect, it contains fewer problems than Earth has endured, such as disease and overpopulation. She wrote, [...] "basically, the indigenous life forms, appalled by these things that came through and started multiplying and spreading out, carrying their diseases and wars, tried to fix things for the humans...

500|$|Jackson {{describes}} Lena Horne as {{a profound}} inspiration, for entertainers of several generations {{as well as}} herself. Upon Horne's death, she stated [...] " [...] brought much joy into everyone's lives—even the younger generations, younger than myself. She {{was such a great}} talent. She opened up such doors for artists like myself." [...] Similarly, she considers Dorothy Dandridge to be one of her idols. Jackson has declared herself [...] "a very big Joni Mitchell fan", explaining [...] "As <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> <b>I</b> was drawn to Joni Mitchell records [...] Joni's songs spoke to me in an intimate, personal way." [...] She holds reverence for Tina Turner, stating [...] "Tina has become a heroic figure for many people, especially women, because of her tremendous strength. Personally, Tina doesn't seem to have a beginning or an end in my life. I felt her music was always there, and I feel like it always will be." [...] She has also named other socially conscious acts, such as Tracy Chapman, Sly and the Family Stone, U2, and Bob Dylan as sources of inspiration. In her early career, Jackson credited her brothers Michael and Jermaine as musical influences.

500|$|Shortz was {{the first}} guest star the {{producers}} of The Simpsons approached. Long later asked Reagle to make puzzles for the episode. Reagle recorded his lines in a studio near his home. Reagle told the Arizona Daily Wildcat that [...] "for me, {{to be such a}} total nut for animation since I was <b>a</b> <b>kid,</b> <b>I</b> never even dreamed [...] It's like a dream I never had coming true." [...] He added that [...] "you don't see [...] in the episode for very long, but when crossword fans watch this show, we want them to think that we got it right." [...] Reagle designed every puzzle that appears in the episode, including one that appears in a hopscotch court in Lisa's daydream. There were certain lines in the script that had to be incorporated into Reagle's puzzles, including one where Gil says [...] "I think I'll throw some Q's around,", and he enters a number of Q's onto the grid. Reagle therefore had to create a puzzle which used words that included the letter Q more frequently than would be usual. Reagle said he saw the early script of the episode, [...] "but they change it right up to the last minute. In a lot of ways, I'll be seeing {{it for the first time}} right along with everyone else."

"Cruise Control", {{featuring}} reggae artist Damian Marley, {{is influenced}} by R and reggae, and finds her adapting to the genre by imitating Jamaican phrases, accents and styles of singing.

Its lyrics find Carey as her most vulnerable; she describes old times she shared with her lover, and that even though [...] "we said let go", and [...] "inside she knows it's over", she still [...] "stays in love with him". Featuring American rapper Young Jeezy, [...] "Side Effects" [...] describes Carey's abusive relationship with Tommy Mottola, her ex-husband. During the first verse, she discusses the pair's background, and how {{she was young and}} naive, and believed everything he preached to her. The lyrics read [...] "Keepin' me there, under your thumb / Cause you were scared that I'd become much / More than you could handle," [...] she confesses, and refers to herself as [...] "Shining like a chandelier / That decorated every room inside / The private hell we built / And I dealt with it / Like <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> <b>I</b> wished / I could fly away." [...] Sarah Rodman from The Boston Globe described it as [...] "another look at her fractious marriage to Mottola", and wrote [...] "Although the union ended in 1998, Carey is still suffering, including dreams of the 'violent times' and 'sleeping with the enemy'. Interestingly, her vocal approach here is almost emo, as she hits her rock-solid middle register and refuses to be held captive by the demons of her past."
