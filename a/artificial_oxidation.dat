40|$|Previous work {{carried out}} on {{different}} outcrop coals from the French Massif Central revealed abnormally high Tmax values, which initially were attributed to high temperature oxidising fluids. This increase in Tmax, which was exclusively observed for medium to low volatile bituminous coals (Rr≥ 1. 5 %), {{was accompanied by a}} very clear exponential-like decrease of the hydrogen index (HI) together with an increase in the oxygen index (OI). With the aim of checking the possibility that this rise in Tmax could simply be caused by weathering, a few mature coal samples (Rr> 1. 4 %) were experimentally oxidised at rather low temperatures (110, 125 and 150 °C) and for durations of up to 6. 5 month. Then the oxidation residues were subjected to Rock–Eval 6 pyrolysis and to vitrinite reflectance measurements. These experiments effectively reproduce the geochemical changes displayed by the naturally altered coals, thus supporting the hypothesis that the previously studied natural alteration process could have been ultimately caused by weathering. The observed <b>artificial</b> <b>oxidation</b> path could be divided into two stages: (i) a strong decrease in HI and an increase in OI and (ii) a constant HI value and a slow rise in OI. The increase in Tmax seems related to the transition between the first and the second stages. This behaviour of HI and OI during <b>artificial</b> <b>oxidation</b> suggests that these two Rock–Eval derived indices can be practically used to detect a moderate and even a low oxidation degree. Finally, if one ignores the constancy of the vitrinite reflectance values all along the oxidation path, the decrease of HI and the concomitant increase of Tmax mimic a thermal evolution pathway...|$|E

Under pro-oxidant conditions, two GSH molecules donate one electron each and are converted into glutathione disulfide (GSSG). The GSH/GSSG molar ratio is considered a powerful index of oxidative stress and disease risk. Despite high interest in GSH/GSSG titration as measures of thiol redox balance, no broad agreement has yet been reached as to the best pre-analytical and analytical methods for the quantitation of these molecules in biological samples. Consequently, measured concentrations of GSH and GSSG and calculated GSH/GSSG molar ratios vary widely among laboratories. Here, we describe in detail the main analytical and pre-analytical problems related to the <b>artificial</b> <b>oxidation</b> of the sulfhydryl (SH) group of GSH that occur during sample manipulation. We underline how this aspect has been neglected for long time after its first description more than fifty years ago.

40|$|AbstractEnabling the {{implementation}} of top down proteomic techniques within clinical workflows requires {{a dramatic increase in}} sensitivity. It has been previously demonstrated that electrospray ionization (ESI) becomes more efficient with decreasing volumetric flow rates at the emitter. Therefore, narrow inner diameter (I. D.) columns used in front-end chromatographic separations yield increased sensitivity. However, the smaller cross-sectional area of a narrow I. D. column places a larger fraction of the eluent in fluid communication with the electrode within the high voltage union that facilitates electrospray ionization (ESI), leading to increased oxidation of solution-phase proteins. Oxidation of proteins alters their chemical state of the protein, complicates data analysis, and reduces the depth of proteome coverage attained in a typical top-down proteomics experiment. Excessive protein oxidation results in poor deconvolution and exact mass calculations from MS 1 spectra, interferes with peak isolation for MS/MS fragmentation, and effectively reduces sensitivity by splitting ion current. All of these factors deteriorate top down mass spectral data quality, an effect that becomes more pronounced as column diameter decreases. <b>Artificial</b> protein <b>oxidation</b> can also mislead investigations of in vivo protein oxidation. All of these effects are accentuated in comparison to bottom up proteomics due to the increased probability of having oxidizable residues within a particular species with increasing mass. Herein, we describe a configuration (which we term “Low Protein Oxidation (LPOx) ”) for proteomics experiments created by re-arranging liquid chromatography (LC) plumbing and present its application to <b>artificial</b> protein <b>oxidation</b> and show a marked improvement in detection sensitivity. Using a standard mixture of five intact proteins, we demonstrate that the LPOx configuration reduces protein oxidation up to 90 % using 50 μm I. D. columns when compared to a conventional LC plumbing configuration with 50 μm I. D. column. As a proof-of-concept study, at least 11 distinct proteoforms of serum Apolipoprotein A 1 were detected with the LPOx configuration. This innovative LC configuration {{can be applied to the}} top down identification and characterization of proteoforms obscured by abundant <b>artificial</b> protein <b>oxidation</b> at low flowrates, all while using reduced amounts of valuable protein samples...|$|R

40|$|The {{non-stoichiometric}} sulfide mineral pyrrhotite (Fe 1 -xS) occurs almost ubiquitously inter-grown {{with the}} principal nickel mineral, pentlandite ((Fe,Ni) 9 S 8). During Ni processing, pyrrhotite is generally rejected to the tailings stream by flotation to produce a low tonnage, high grade (Ni) smelter feed and reduce SO 2 emissions. In this study, the effect of different pyrrhotite flotation rejection strategies (<b>artificial</b> <b>oxidation</b> and TETA: SMBS addition) are evaluated on a magnetic (Ore A) and non-magnetic (Ore B) pyrrhotite ore to determine if either may effectively depress and potentially passivate the pyrrhotite surface during flotation to produce benign tailings without compromising pentlandite recovery. For both ores, the best pyrrhotite rejection (pentlandite/pyrrhotite recovery) was obtained using TETA: SMBS. Differences in the flotation performance of the two ores are considered more a function of BMS content, liberation and ore handling rather than a difference in sulfide passivation from the inherent pyrrhotite mineralogy (magnetic vs non-magnetic pyrrhotite). Pyrrhotite passivation could possibly provide a means of rendering the tailings non-reactive and thus mitigate acid rock drainage (ARD) formation...|$|E

Diverse methodologies {{have been developed}} that measure a variety of lipid peroxidation products used as markers of lipid peroxidation processes. Methods: Hydroxy and hydroperoxy polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) peroxidation products were analyzed in human blood plasma by reversed-phase HPLC after liquid-liquid extraction of total lipids and alkaline hydrolysis of lipid esters to liberate free PUFAs. An isocratic mobile phase containing 1 g/L acetic acidacetonitrile-tetrahydrofuran (52 : 30 : 18, by volume) over 60 min duration, with ultraviolet absorbance detection at 236 nm by photodiode array, enabled the resolution and quantification of 13 regioisomeric hydroxy and hydroperoxy PUFAs. Results: As little as 250 �L of human plasma was utilized with an analytical range of 0. 033 – 1. 6 �mol/L for each compound. Intra- and interassay CVs for all compounds detected in normal or oxidatively modified human plasma were 3. 2 – 11 % and 4. 7 – 12 %, respectively. Analytical recoveries were 87 – 103 %.

Weused Prx 6 as a model protein because it possesses only two cysteine residues at the 47 th and 91 st positions. The spot of Prx 6 on 2 D-GE undergoes a basic (isoelectric point, pI 6. 6) to acidic (pI 6. 2) shift by exposure to peroxide due to selective overoxidationof the active-site cysteine Cys- 47 but not of Cys- 91. However, we detected a tryptic peptide containing cysteine sulfonic acid atthe 47 th position from the basic spot and a peptide containing both oxidized Cys- 47 and oxidized Cys- 91 from the acidic spot ofPrx 6 after the separation by 2 D-GE. We prepared two types of oxidized Prx 6 s: carrying oxidized Cys- 47 (single oxidized Prx 6),and other carrying both oxidized Cys- 47 and Cys- 91 (double oxidized Prx 6). Using these oxidized Prx 6 s, the single oxidizedPrx 6 and double oxidized Prx 6 migrated to pIs at 6. 2 and 5. 9, respectively. These results suggest that oxidized Cys- 47 from thebasic spot and oxidized Cys- 91 from the acidic spot are generated by <b>artificial</b> <b>oxidation</b> during sample handling processes afterisoelectric focusing of 2 D-GE.

The wear resistance of AZ 91 D magnesium alloy in artificial saliva was significantly improved after microarc oxidation treatment. The volume loss of untreated AZ 91 D magnesium alloy sample was 20. 95 times of that of AZ 91 D magnesium alloy with MAO coating, and that of Ti 6 Al 4 V was 5. 42 times of that of MAO.

Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of the ammonia-oxidizing bacterial community of the inoculum and the freshwater and the artificial seawater aquaria as a function of time showed that initially only one dominant ammonia-oxidizer, closely related to Nitrosomonas marina, was detectable in all the systems. The fingerprint of the ammonia-oxidizing bacterial community in the artificial seawater biofilters continued to be dominated by this single band. In the freshwater aquaria, in contrast, the composition of the ammonia-oxidizer community became more diverse after one month, with 4 – 7 new bands appearing in the denaturing gradient gel fingerprint. Since the inoculum is cultivated at an average salinity of 11 g l− 1, it is argued that the elevated salinity selects for a less diverse ammonia-oxidizer community in the inoculum and the artificial seawater aquaria...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundChronic {{alcoholism}} {{is associated}} with an elevated risk for pulmonary infection and a 3 -fold chance for incidence and mortality of acute respiratory distress syndrome with critical injury. Limited sampling of the alveolar lining fluid has restricted clinical studies {{of the role of}} glutathione (GSH) redox balance in pulmonary function and diseased states. Non-invasive sampling in the exhaled breath condensate (EBC) to monitor alveolar GSH would facilitate research in pulmonary oxidative stress. MethodsEBC was collected from otherwise healthy subjects with and without a history of alcohol abuse. Reduced and oxidized EBC glutathione (GSH and GSSG, respectively), pH, and hydrogen peroxide were measured. ResultsGSH was statistically decreased in alcohol abusers only when normalized to protein (4. 7 nmol/mg protein [0. 75, 11. 4] vs. 13. 4 [7. 8, 26. 4], p= 0. 03). In contrast, GSSG was significantly elevated in the EBC from alcohol abusers when compared to controls, 5. 62 [0. 45, 8. 94] vs. 0. 50 nM [0. 38, 0. 80], p= 0. 03. Thus, a greater percentage was in the oxidized GSSG form when subjects abused alcohol (35. 3 % [11. 8, 58. 1] vs. 5. 2 [3. 6, 6. 1], p< 0. 001). These concentrations represented a 40 mV shift in GSH redox state towards a more oxidized state.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the global thiol-disulfide redox status in tissues and cells is a challenging task since thiols and disulfides can undergo artificial oxido-reductions during sample manipulation. Because of this, the measured values, in particular for disulfides, can have a significant bias. Whereas this methodological problem has already been addressed in samples of red blood cells and solid tissues, a reliable method to measure thiols and disulfides in cell cultures has not been previously reported. Here, we demonstrate that the major artifact occurring during thiol and disulfide analysis in cultured cells is represented by glutathione disulfide (GSSG) and S-glutathionylated proteins (PSSG) overestimation, due to <b>artificial</b> <b>oxidation</b> of glutathione (GSH) during sample manipulation, and that this methodological problem can be solved {{by the addition of}} N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) immediately after culture medium removal. Basal levels of GSSG and PSSG in different lines of cultured cells were 3 - 5 and 10 - 20 folds higher, respectively, when the cells were processed without NEM. NEM pre-treatment also prevented the artificial reduction of disulfides that occurs during the pre-analytical phase when cells are exposed to an oxidant stimulus. In fact, in the absence of NEM, after medium removal, GSH, GSSG and PSSG levels restored their initial values within 15 - 30 min, due to the activity of reductases and the lack of the oxidant. The newly developed protocol was used to measure the thiol-disulfide redox status in 16 different line cells routinely used for biomedical research both under basal conditions and after treatment with disulfiram, a thiol-specific oxidant (0 - 200 μM concentration range). Our data indicate that, in most cell lines, treatment with disulfiram affected the levels of GSH and GSSG only at the highest concentration. On the other hand, PSSG levels increased significantly also at the lower concentrations of the drug, and the rise was remarkable (from 100 to 1000 folds at 200 μM concentration) and dose-dependent for almost all the cell lines. These data support the suitability of the {{analysis of}} PSSG in cultured cells as a biomarker of oxidative stress...|$|E
40|$|Today {{it is well}} {{established}} that particulate matter (PM) cause {{a wide range of}} health effects. The underlying mechanisms likely include inflammation, oxidative stress and genotoxicity. There is however a lack of knowledge regarding how particles from different sources contribute to these effects. Furthermore, oxidative stress is difficult to analyse due to the risk of <b>artificial</b> <b>oxidation</b> during sample preparation and analysis. The main aims of this thesis were to investigate different methods for analysis of oxidative DNA damage and to compare the ability of particles from different source to a) cause DNA damage, b) cause oxidation of DNA, c) induce inflammatory mediators, d) cause mitochondrial depolarisation and c) form intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). In Paper I and II the background level of oxidative DNA damage in human lymphocytes was investigated. HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) with electrochemical detection was used to analyse 8 -oxo- 7, 8 -dihydro- 2 '-deoxyguanosine (8 oxodG) and the Comet assay in combination with the enzyme formamidopyrimidine glycosylase (FPG) was used to detect mainly oxidised purines. It was found that the level in a healthy Swedish population was around 1 8 -oxodG per 106 dG measured using HPLCEC, and 0. 24 FPG sites per 106 dG using the Comet assay. Furthermore, there was no correlation between the levels of 8 -oxodG and FPG sites. In Papers III-VI, the toxicity of particles from different sources were studied. It was found that subway particles were most genotoxic of all particles tested and that they caused formation of 8 -oxodG and intracellular ROS in cultured human lung cells. In contrast, the street particles caused the highest release of inflammatory cytokines. Particles from tire-road wear collected using a road-simulator were genotoxic and induced inflammatory cytokines without involvement of particles related to vehicle exhaust. Furthermore, more efficient combustion of wood and pellet gave much less emissions of particles, but those emitted did not show less toxicity. Finally, diesel particles were most potent to cause mitochondrial damage, followed by PM from wood combustion and the subway. In conclusion, PM from different sources showed different types of toxic effects. Subway particles were most potent regarding genotoxicity and oxidative stress in vitro, the main focus in this thesis, and may in this context therefore be regarded as "particularly harmful"...|$|E
40|$|A central {{question}} in biological water splitting concerns the oxidation {{states of the}} manganese ions that comprise the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II. Understanding the nature and order of oxidation events that occur during the catalytic cycle of five Si states (i = 0 - 4) is of fundamental importance both for the natural system and for <b>artificial</b> water <b>oxidation</b> catalysts. Despite the widespread adoption of the so-called "high-valent scheme" - where, for example, the Mn oxidation states in the S 2 state are assigned as III, IV, IV, IV - the competing "low-valent scheme" that differs {{by a total of}} two metal unpaired electrons (i. e. III, III, III, IV in the S 2 state) is favored by several recent studies for the biological catalyst. The question of the correct oxidation state assignment is addressed here by a detailed computational comparison of the two schemes using a common structural platform and theoretical approach. Models based on crystallographic constraints were constructed for all conceivable oxidation state assignments in the four (semi) stable S states of the oxygen evolving complex, sampling various protonation levels and patterns to ensure comprehensive coverage. The models are evaluated with respect to their geometric, energetic, electronic, and spectroscopic properties against available experimental EXAFS, XFEL-XRD, EPR, ENDOR and Mn K pre-edge XANES data. New 2. 5 K 55 Mn ENDOR data of the S 2 state are also reported. Our results conclusively show that the entire S state phenomenology can only be accommodated within the high-valent scheme by adopting a single motif and protonation pattern that progresses smoothly from S 0 (III, III, III, IV) to S 3 (IV, IV, IV, IV), satisfying all experimental constraints and reproducing all observables. By contrast, it was impossible to construct a consistent cycle based on the low-valent scheme for all S states. Instead, the low-valent models developed here may provide new insight into the over-reduced S states and the states involved in the assembly of the catalytically active water oxidizing cluster...|$|R

Significant progress in water oxidation catalysis has been achieved recently by use of single-site Ru metal complex catalysts such as [Ru(Mebimpy) (bpy) (OH 2) ] 2 + [Mebimpy =  2, 6 -bis(1 -methylbenzimidazol- 2 -yl) pyridine; bpy =  2, 2 ′-bipyridine]. When oxidized from to RuV = O 3 +, these complexes undergo O—O bond formation by O-atom attack on a H 2 O molecule, which is often the rate-limiting step. Microscopic details of O—O bond formation have been explored by quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) simulations the results of which provide detailed insight into mechanism and a strategy for enhancing catalytic rates. It utilizes added bases as proton acceptors and concerted atom–proton transfer (APT) with O-atom transfer to the O atom of a water molecule in concert with proton transfer to the base (B).

Therefore, native UL 10 :UN 10 ratios, used as markers of redox status and disease risk, are difficult to measure. We established an RP-(U) HPLC method with coulometric detection to measure natively circulating UL 10 and UN 10 concentrations by adding a ubiquinol/ubiquinone mixture as an internal standard immediately after plasma preparation. This allowed adjustment for unavoidable <b>artificial</b> UL 10 <b>oxidation</b> as well as for total losses (or gains) of analytes during sample storage, processing, and analysis because the internal standards exactly paralleled the chemical behavior of Q 10. This technique applied to blood (n = 13) revealed Q 10 levels of 680 - 3300 nM with a mean UL 10 :UN 10 ratio of 95 : 5, which was inversely associated with total Q 10 (r=- 0. 69; p= 0. 004). The oxidation of UL 10 to UN 10 was equimolar, increased by O(2), and decreased by lower temperatures or various degassing methods. Although UL 10 was stable in blood or when pure in organic solvents at 22 degrees C, its oxidation was catalyzed dose dependently by alpha-tocopherol and butylated hydroxytoluene, particularly when present in combination.

The nca gene of Agrobacterium radiobacter was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The Nca is a homodimeric enzyme with subunit molecular mass of 36 kDa. Enzymatic activity of Nca is inactivated after 5 h of incubation at 50 ℃. To examine the oxidation stability of Nca, the enzyme was incubated at 37 ℃ {{in the presence of}} different concentrations of H 2 O 2. Mass spectrum revealed that <b>artificial</b> <b>oxidation</b> of Nca with 0. 4 mM H 2 O 2 was too harsh to discriminate oxidized residues. Molecular mass of Nca inactivatede under natural oxidation was increased by 27 Da compared to that of native enzyme. Therefore, the methionine residues of Nca seem to be oxidized by oxygen. To verify whether methionine residues were oxidized, all methionine residues in Nca were substituted by leucine via site-directed mutagenesis. The results revealed that mutant Met- 239 -Leu/Met- 244 -Leu retained its activity after H 2 O 2 treatment, indicating that Met- 239 or Met- 244 might be involved in enzyme oxidation. To improve the Nca activity, PCR-based random mutation coupled plasmid multimerization was applied to nca gene evolution. Of one thousand mutants, the Nca activities of four mutants were increased by 1. 5 -fold compared to that of the parent strain, but specific activity remained unchanged. Amino acid sequence alignment of A. radiobacter Nca and Pseudomonas sp. Nca displayed 58. 6 % identity. Based on this identity, a number of aspartic acid and histidine residues in conserved regions of A. radiobacter Nca were selected for site-directed mutagenesis to evalute the effect of these amino acid residues on Nca activity. Nca mutants, Asp- 209 -Ala and His- 129 -Ala, lost their activities completely, suggesting that Asp- 209 and His- 129 residues might be important in catalysis. The Asp- 209 -Glu mutant retained 30 % activity, indicating that carboxyl group of Asp- 209 participated in catatlysis. Substitution of His- 129 by asparagine or arginine abolished enzyme activity completely, suggesting that His- 129 might be involved in proton transfer, but not in hydrogen bonding.

Instead of manual addition of all the requirements for ATP and reducing equivalents required to synthesize 1  g biomass from CO 2, the ATP and reducing equivalents were determined by performing FBA on the NmrFL 413 model. For the calculation, the biomass production reaction rate was set to be 1  h− 1 and the lower bound and upper bound of reactions in ammonia oxidation pathway was set to be zero to block the ATP/NADH production from ammonium <b>oxidation.</b> <b>Artificial</b> reactions for ATP/NADH input were introduced in the model and the ATP input flux was minimized using FBA analysis. The ATP and NADH requirement for the production of 1  g biomass were obtained from the calculated ATP and NADH input rates. Here, we use NADH as the representative for the reducing equivalents during the calculation. NADH can be converted to other reducing equivalents (NADPH, QH 2) through existing reactions in the model to meet the need of other reducing equivalents, for example one molecule NADH can be converted to one molecule NADPH, the conversion of NADH with NADPH is similar to the conversion in well-characterized E. coli model iJO 1366. AOA ferredoxin transcripts and proteins were detected in high abundance in environmental samples, suggesting the importance of the low reduction potential ferredoxin in the metabolic network of marine AOA. In our model, one molecule NADH can be converted to two molecules ferredoxin, which is also in consistent with model iJO 1366 and other archaeal models.|$|R
40|$|Photosynthesis is {{the unique}} {{biological}} process that converts carbon dioxide into organic compounds, for example sugars, using {{the energy of}} sunlight. Thereby solar energy is converted into chemical energy. Nearly all life depends on this reaction, either directly, or indirectly as the ultimate source of their food. Oxygenic photosynthesis occurs in plants, algae and cyanobacteria. This process created the present level of oxygen in the atmosphere, which allowed the formation of higher life, since respiration allows extracting up to 15 -times more energy from organic matter than anaerobic fermentation. Oxygenic photosynthesis uses as substrate for the ubiquitous water. The light-induced oxidation of water to molecular oxygen (O 2), catalyzed by the Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster associated with the photosystem II (PS II) complex, is thus {{one of the most}} important and wide spread chemical processes occurring in the biosphere. Understanding the mechanism of water-oxidation by the Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster is one of today’s great challenges in science. It is believed that one can extract basic principles of catalyst design from the natural system that than can be applied to artificial systems. Such systems can be used in the future for the generation of fuel from sunlight. In this thesis the light-induced production of molecular oxygen and carbon dioxide (CO 2) by PSII was observed by membrane-inlet mass spectrometry. By analyzing this observation is shown that CO 2 not only is the substrate in photosynthesis for the production of sugars, but that it also regulates the efficiency of the initial steps of the electron transport chain of oxygenic photosynthesis by acting, in form of HCO 3 -, as acceptor for protons produced during water-splitting. This finding concludes the 50 -years old search for the function of CO 2 /HCO 3 − in photosynthetic water oxidation. For understanding the mechanism of water oxidation it is crucial to resolve the structures of all oxidation states, including transient once, of the Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster. With this application in mind a new illumination setup was developed and characterized that allowed to bring the Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster of PSII microcrystals into known oxidation states while they flow through a narrow capillary. The optimized illumination conditions were employed at the X-ray free electron laser at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) to obtain simultaneous x-ray diffraction (XRD) and x-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) at room temperature. This two methods probe the overall protein structure and the electronic structure of the Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster, respectively. Data are presented from both the dark state (S 1) and the first illuminated state (S 2) of PS II. This approach opens new directions for studying structural changes during the catalytic cycle of the Mn 4 CaO 5 cluster, and for resolving the mechanism of O-O bond formation. In two other projects the mechanism of molecular oxygen formation by <b>artificial</b> water <b>oxidation</b> catalysts containing inexpensive and abundant elements were studied. Oxygen evolution catalyzed by calcium manganese and manganese only oxides was studied in 18 O-enriched water. It was concluded that molecular oxygen is formed by entirely different pathways depending on what chemical oxidant was used.  Only strong non-oxygen donating oxidants were found to support ‘true’ water-oxidation. For cobalt oxides a study was designed to understand the mechanistic details of how the O-O bond forms. The data demonstrate that O-O bond formation occurs by direct coupling between two terminal water-derived ligands. Moreover, by detailed theoretical modelling of the data the number of cobalt atoms per catalytic site was derived...|$|R
