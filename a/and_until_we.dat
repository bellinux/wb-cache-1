500|$|Yard {{believed}} that eligible national parks {{had to be}} scenically stunning. [...] He noted in his 1919 volume The Book of the National Parks that the major characteristic of almost all national parks was that their scenery had been forged by geological or biological processes. [...] He wrote, [...] "e shall not really enjoy our possession of the grandest scenery in the world until we realize that scenery is the written page of the History of Creation, <b>and</b> <b>until</b> <b>we</b> learn to read that page." [...] Yard's standards also insisted upon [...] "complete conservation", meaning avoidance of commercialism and industrialization. [...] Often referring to parks as [...] "American masterpieces", he sought {{to protect them from}} economic activities such as timber cutting and mineral extracting. [...] In such, Yard often advocated the preservation of [...] "wilderness" [...] conditions in America's national parks.|$|E

2500|$|Crick {{occasionally}} {{expressed his}} views on eugenics, usually in private letters. For example, Crick advocated a form of positive eugenics in which wealthy parents would be encouraged to have more children. He once remarked, [...] "In the long run, it is unavoidable that society will begin {{to worry about the}} character of the next generation... It is not a subject at the moment which we can tackle easily because people have so many religious beliefs <b>and</b> <b>until</b> <b>we</b> have a more uniform view of ourselves I think it would be risky to try and do anything in the way of eugenics... I would be astonished if, in the next 100 or 200years, society did not come round to the view {{that they would have to}} try to improve the next generation in some extent or one way or another." ...|$|E
