5000|$|On February 22, 1998, Chanchangi Airlines' chief pilot asked Air Traffic Control (ATC) at Kaduna, Nigeria for {{permission}} to conduct flight training within the airport's circuit using a Chanchangi Airlines Boeing 737-2K3 which had arrived from Lagos approximately one hour earlier. As visibility had reduced to 600 meters, he was told it was below the minimum allowed for landing and his request was not feasible. Next, the pilot requested he be allowed to conduct <b>rejected</b> <b>take-off</b> training, and permission was subsequently granted by ATC. Several individuals joined the captain for the exercise. He was instructed to begin the training on Runway 05, and once in position permission for [...] "takeoff" [...] was given. Normally, <b>any</b> single <b>rejected</b> takeoff at high speed would require a minimum of ten minutes to allow the brakes to cool before the aircraft could be safely operated again, and depending on various factors, this time period could be much longer, something the pilot certainly would have known. However, within the next twelve minutes, the pilot inexplicably conducted no less than four <b>rejected</b> <b>take-offs,</b> {{at least one of}} them and possibly all four of them at high speed. The brakes on one of the main landing gears (left side) began to catch fire, exacerbated by leaking hydraulic fluid. The pilot continued to taxi the aircraft until the tires and then the wheels of the left main gear disintegrated, preventing the plane from moving any further. He then called for emergency services. Unfortunately, they were unable to prevent the aircraft from burning to the ground. There were no fatalities. The chief pilot alleged he did not use the brakes for his practice <b>rejected</b> <b>take-offs,</b> however the evidence was unequivocally otherwise.|$|R

This {{was caused by}} a <b>rejected</b> <b>take-off.</b> The {{aircraft}} was stopped by the engineered materials arrestor system (EMAS)at the end of the runway, sustaining substantial damage to its undercarriage.

50|$|Reverse thrust mode is {{used only}} for a {{fraction}} of aircraft operating time but affects it greatly in terms of design, weight, maintenance, performance, and cost. Penalties are significant but necessary since it provides stopping force for added safety margins, directional control during landing rolls, and aids in <b>rejected</b> <b>take-offs</b> and ground operations on contaminated runways where normal braking effectiveness is diminished. Airlines consider thrust reverser systems a vital part of reaching a maximum level of aircraft operating safety.|$|R

Soft authentication can be further divided into quality-based authentication which <b>rejects</b> <b>any</b> manipulations that lower the perceptual quality below an acceptable level and content-based authentication which <b>rejects</b> <b>any</b> manipulations that change the semantic meaning of the content.

40|$|In this work, we {{developed}} an interface modified by graphene to simultaneously improve the mechanical and frictional properties of carbon/graphene/carbon (C/G/C) composite. Results {{indicated that the}} C/G/C composite exhibits remarkably improved interfacial bonding mode, static and dynamic mechanical performance, thermal conductivity, and frictional properties in comparison {{with those of the}} C/C composite. The weight contents of carbon fibers, graphene and pyrolytic carbon are 31. 6, 0. 3 and 68. 1 wt %, respectively. The matrix of the C/G/C composite was mainly composed of rough laminar (RL) pyrocarbon. The average hardness by nanoindentation of the C/G/C and C/C composite matrices were 0. 473 and 0. 751 GPa, respectively. The flexural strength (three point bending), interlaminar shear strength (ILSS), interfacial debonding strength (IDS), internal friction and storage modulus of the C/C composite were 106, 10. 3, 7. 6, 0. 038 and 12. 7 GPa, respectively. Those properties of the C/G/C composite increased by 76. 4 %, 44. 6 %, 168. 4 % and 22. 8 %, respectively, and their internal friction decreased by 42. 1 % in comparison with those of the C/C composite. Owing to the lower hardness of the matrix, improved fiber/matrix interface bonding strength, and self-lubricating properties of graphene, a complete friction film was easily formed on the friction surface of the modified composite. Compared with the C/C composite, the C/G/C composite exhibited stable friction coefficients and lower wear losses at simulating air-plane normal landing (NL) and <b>rejected</b> <b>take-off</b> (RTO). The method appears to be a competitive approach to improve the mechanical and frictional properties of C/C composites simultaneously...|$|R
