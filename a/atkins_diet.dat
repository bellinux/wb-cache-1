5|$|In many {{developing}} countries, the ketogenic diet is expensive because dairy fats and meat {{are more expensive}} than grain, fruit and vegetables. The modified <b>Atkins</b> <b>diet</b> has been proposed as a lower-cost alternative for those countries; the slightly more expensive food bill can be offset by a reduction in pharmaceutical costs if the diet is successful. The modified <b>Atkins</b> <b>diet</b> is less complex to explain and prepare and requires less support from a dietitian.|$|E
5|$|First {{reported}} in 2003, {{the idea of}} using a form of the <b>Atkins</b> <b>diet</b> to treat epilepsy came about after parents and patients discovered that the induction phase of the <b>Atkins</b> <b>diet</b> controlled seizures. The ketogenic diet team at Johns Hopkins Hospital modified the <b>Atkins</b> <b>diet</b> by removing the aim of achieving weight loss, extending the induction phase indefinitely, and specifically encouraging fat consumption. Compared with the ketogenic diet, the modified <b>Atkins</b> <b>diet</b> (MAD) places no limit on calories or protein, and the lower overall ketogenic ratio (approximately 1:1) {{does not need to be}} consistently maintained by all meals of the day. The MAD does not begin with a fast or with a stay in hospital and requires less dietitian support than the ketogenic diet. Carbohydrates are initially limited to 10g per day in children or 20g per day in adults, and are increased to 20–30g per day after a month or so, depending on the effect on seizure control or tolerance of the restrictions. Like the ketogenic diet, the MAD requires vitamin and mineral supplements and children are carefully and periodically monitored at outpatient clinics.|$|E
5|$|By 2007, the {{ketogenic}} diet {{was available}} from around 75 centres in 45 countries, and less restrictive variants, {{such as the}} modified <b>Atkins</b> <b>diet,</b> were in use, particularly among older children and adults.

5000|$|In the 1990s, Atkins {{published}} an update from his 1972 book, Dr. <b>Atkins</b> New <b>Diet</b> Revolution, and other doctors began to publish books {{based on the}} same principles. This has been said to be the beginning of what the mass media call the [...] "low carb craze" [...] in the United States. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, low-carbohydrate diets became {{some of the most popular}} diets in the US. By some accounts, up to 18% of the population was using one type of low-carbohydrate diet or another at the peak of their popularity, and this use spread to many countries. Food manufacturers and restaurant chains like Krispy Kreme noted the trend, as it affected their businesses. Parts of the mainstream medical community has denounced low-carbohydrate diets as being dangerous to health, such as the AHA in 2001, the American Kidney Fund in 2002, Low-carbohydrate advocates did some adjustments of their own, increasingly advocating controlling fat and eliminating trans fat.|$|R
40|$|With recent {{increases}} in obesity throughout the United States and other industrialized nations, fad diets continue to gain in popularity. Although little formal {{research has been}} undertaken regarding the health impact of these fads, {{each has its own}} questionable health benefits as well as potential health risks, including lithogenic effects (1). Furthermore, many are simply iterations of the same core fad diet tenet. For instance, several fad diets focus on low carbohydrates (Dukan, <b>Atkins,</b> or zone <b>diets)</b> which are often accomplished through increased intake of animal protein. Although little data exists regarding each diet type, one could reasonably expect an increased metabolic acid load from the animal protein leading to decreased urinary citrate and increased urinary calcium. The opposite problem can also exist. When not balanced with adequate calcium intake with meals, othe...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effectiveness of a calorie-restricted diet versus one with restricted food groups. To accomplish this, a survey with 19 participants, age ranging from 25 to 74 years, was taken for people who attempted Weight Watchers, a calorie-restricted <b>diet,</b> and <b>Atkins,</b> a low-carbohydrate <b>diet.</b> The success rates of each of these diets will be compared and analyzed in this study. Participants reported short-term and long-term weight loss results. For the data analysis, descriptive statistics and two independent t-tests were performed. For short-term weight loss on Atkins, M = 20. 25, and on Weight Watchers, M = 44. 33. With net weight loss, Atkins averaged 11. 25 pounds and Weight Watchers group averaged 44. 33 pounds. Although the independent t-tests did not show a significant difference, research suggests that calorie restriction is more effective for long-term maintenance...|$|R
5|$|The low {{glycaemic}} index treatment (LGIT) {{is an attempt}} to achieve the stable blood glucose levels seen in children on the classic ketogenic diet while using a much less restrictive regimen. The hypothesis is that stable blood glucose {{may be one of the}} mechanisms of action involved in the ketogenic diet, which occurs because the absorption of the limited carbohydrates is slowed by the high fat content. Although it is also a high-fat diet (with approximately 60% calories from fat), the LGIT allows more carbohydrate than either the classic ketogenic diet or the modified <b>Atkins</b> <b>diet,</b> approximately 40–60g per day. However, the types of carbohydrates consumed are restricted to those that have a {{glycaemic index}} lower than 50. Like the modified <b>Atkins</b> <b>diet,</b> the LGIT is initiated and maintained at outpatient clinics and does not require precise weighing of food or intensive dietitian support. Both are offered at most centres that run ketogenic diet programmes, and in some centres they are often the primary dietary therapy for adolescents.|$|E
5|$|The {{modified}} <b>Atkins</b> <b>diet</b> reduces seizure frequency by {{more than}} 50% in 43% of patients who try it and {{by more than}} 90% in 27% of patients. Few adverse effects have been reported, though cholesterol is increased and the diet has not been studied long term. Although based on a smaller data set (126 adults and children from 11 studies over five centres), these results from 2009 compare favourably with the traditional ketogenic diet.|$|E
5|$|Implementing {{the diet}} can present {{difficulties}} for caregivers {{and the patient}} due to the time commitment involved in measuring and planning meals. Since any unplanned eating can potentially break the nutritional balance required, some people find the discipline needed to maintain the diet challenging and unpleasant. Some people terminate the diet or switch to a less demanding diet, like the modified <b>Atkins</b> <b>diet</b> (MAD) or the low-glycaemic index treatment (LGIT) diet, because they find the difficulties too great.|$|E
40|$|Investigating {{the role}} of ghrelin and hormones {{involved}} in energy metabolism on energy balance and body composition when varying diets and caloric contents are consumed could {{provide insight into the}} etiology of obesity and related diseases. In this dissertation, I investigated the effect of <b>Atkins</b> and AHA <b>diets</b> in normal weight and overweight women and men in both the fed and fasted states on the change in circulating concentrations of ghrelin (acylated and total), adiponectin, glucagon, growth hormone, insulin, and leptin before and after consuming lunch and over waking hours (07 : 00 to 22 : 00). Eight subjects, ages 20 – 32, participated in each study: four normal subjects with a normal BMI and four overweight subjects with an overweight BMI.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the lowering of carbohydrates from conventionally recommended levels of -> 55 % of energy intake as a valid and safe treatment option for managing obesity and related disease. The study was a qualitative systematic review of fourteen randomized controlled studies, each {{with at least one}} study arm that lowered intake of carbohydrates to either ketogenic levels (-> 50 g/) (<b>Atkins</b> type <b>diet)</b> or non-ketogenic levels including Zone type diets (> 50 g/d to 40 - 45 % of energy intake). Low carbohydrate diets have generally implied increased protein intake to around 30 % of energy intake. Outcomes evaluated included weight and fat loss; dyslipidemia; blood sugar control; hypertension; nutritional adequacy; hunger and satiety; adherence and safety. A synthesis of process, results and implications was used towards generating a theoretical weight maangement framework. In the short to medium term of up to six months both the ketogenic and non-ketogenic lowering of carbohydrates {{within the context of a}} calorie reduction of 300 - 750 kcal/day generated clinically meaningful weight loss results of 5 - 10 % Lower-carbohydrates diet plans generated similar or better results for most of the main outcomes examined as comparted with conventional higher-carbohydrate/low-fat diet alternatives. Longer-term studies were few in number but weight loss results were in the range of 2 - 6 % with no significant diet difference noted. Potential impact of ketogenic diets on dyslipidemia, renal and bone health needs further evaluation. When lowering carbohydrates or calories, nutritional adequacy may require maangement with the use of supplementation. Lowering carbohydrates may provide an important and useful strategy to achieve a regular daily caloriee deficit, generate clinically meaningful weight loss and improve related metabolic health markers. Recommended weight management protocols may be individualised based on a theoretical model that considers individual health risks and genetics, dietary preferences, carbohydrate sensitivity and is geared towards improved adherence...|$|R
30|$|When {{compared}} with complex carbohydrates fermentation, proteolytic fermentation is quantitatively smaller, which attributes {{to the high}} efficiency of protein digestion and absorption in small intestine, leading to {{the small amount of}} protein entering colon for fermentation (Silvester and Cummings, 1995). However, there are some exceptional cases in which some extreme dietary interventions like consuming <b>Atkins</b> or Banting <b>diet</b> may be adopted for body weight management. A randomized, double-blind, clinical trial aimed to manage body weight was conducted in 38 overweight individuals who received a high protein diet (HPD) for three weeks (Beaumont et al., 2017). It was reported that HPD did not alter the microbiota composition, but induced a change on bacterial metabolism with increased amino acid degradation, which was positively promoted by phylum Firmicutes (Clostridiales, Christensenellaceae, Ruminococcaceae and Oscillospira), and Bacteroidetes phylum (Odoribacter and Butyricimonas). Rectal mucosa biopsy revealed that the expression of genes playing key roles in homeostatic processes such as cell cycle or cell death was upregulated (Beaumont et al., 2017). This could be explained by the potentially toxic nitrogenous and sulfur metabolites released during protein fermentation, for instance, ammonia, nitrites, amines, hydrogen sulfide and nitrates (Windey et al., 2012).|$|R

40|$|Obesity is {{the most}} common {{nutritional}} disorder in the Western world. Actually, 250 million adults are obese, and 500 million adults and 22 million children under 5 years of age are overweight. Obesity is a complex trait, depending upon interactions between multiple genes and the environment, but its recent rise and "epidemic proportions" are, above all, the consequences of dramatic changes in lifestyle, socioeconomic progress, and political and cultural trends. Eating behavior has strong extraphysiological determinants, being influenced by neuroendocrine, nutritional, environmental, and cognitive stimuli, able to modify the body weight set-point.

40|$|Abstract Background Research {{has shown}} {{micronutrient}} deficiency to be scientifically {{linked to a}} higher risk of overweight/obesity and other dangerous and debilitating diseases. With {{more than two-thirds of the}} U. S. population overweight or obese, and research showing that one-third are on a diet at any given time, a need existed to determine whether current popular diet plans could protect followers from micronutrient deficiency by providing the minimum levels of 27 micronutrients, as determined by the U. S. Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) Reference Daily Intake (RDI) guidelines. Methods Suggested daily menus from four popular <b>diet</b> plans (<b>Atkins</b> for Life <b>diet,</b> The South Beach Diet, the DASH diet, the DASH diet) were evaluated. Calorie and micronutrient content of each ingredient, in each meal, were determined by using food composition data from the U. S. Department of Agriculture Nutrient Database for Standard Reference. The results were evaluated for sufficiency and total calories and deficient micronutrients were identified. The diet plans that did not meet 100 % sufficiency by RDI guidelines for each of the 27 micronutrients were re-analyzed; (1) to identify a micronutrient sufficient calorie intake for all 27 micronutrients, and (2) to identify a second micronutrient sufficient calorie intake when consistently low or nonexistent micronutrients were removed from the sufficiency requirement. Results Analysis determined that each of the four popular diet plans failed to provide minimum RDI sufficiency for all 27 micronutrients analyzed. The four diet plans, on average, were found to be RDI sufficient in (11. 75 ± 2. 02; mean ± SEM) of the analyzed 27 micronutrients and contain (1748. 25 ± 209. 57) kcal. Further analysis of the four diets found that an average calorie intake of (27, 575 ± 4660. 72) would be required to achieve sufficiency in all 27 micronutrients. Six micronutrients (vitamin B 7, vitamin D, vitamin E, chromium, iodine and molybdenum) were identified as consistently low or nonexistent in all four diet plans. These six micronutrients were removed from the sufficiency requirement and additional analysis of the four diets was conducted. It was determined that an average calorie content of (3, 475 ± 543. 81) would be required to reach 100 % sufficiency in the remaining 21 micronutrients. Conclusion These findings are significant and indicate that an individual following a popular diet plan as suggested, with food alone, has a high likelihood of becoming micronutrient deficient; a state shown to be scientifically linked to an increased risk for many dangerous and debilitating health conditions and diseases. </p...|$|R
25|$|In 2004, {{perhaps in}} {{response}} to the burgeoning popularity of low-carbohydrate diets such as the <b>Atkins</b> <b>diet,</b> Coca-Cola announced its intention to develop and sell a low-carbohydrate alternative to Coke Classic, dubbed C2 Cola. C2 contains a mix of high fructose corn syrup, aspartame, sucralose, and Acesulfame potassium. C2 is designed to more closely emulate the taste of Coca-Cola Classic. Even with {{less than half of the}} food energy and carbohydrates of standard soft drinks, C2 is not a replacement for zero-calorie soft drinks such as Diet Coke.

25|$|Many {{studies have}} focused on diets that reduce {{calories}} via a low-carbohydrate (<b>Atkins</b> <b>diet,</b> Scarsdale diet, Zone diet) diet versus a low-fat diet (LEARN diet, Ornish diet). The Nurses' Health Study, an observational cohort study, found that low carbohydrate diets based on vegetable sources of fat and protein are associated with less coronary heart disease. The same study also found no correlation (with multivariate adjustment) between animal fat intake and coronary heart disease (table 4). A long term study that monitored 43,396 Swedish women however suggests that a low carbohydrate-high protein diet, used on a regular basis and without consideration of the nature of carbohydrates or the source of proteins, is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease.|$|E

500|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet is a high-fat, adequate-protein, low-carbohydrate {{diet that}} in medicine is used primarily to treat difficult-to-control (refractory) epilepsy in children. The diet forces {{the body to}} burn fats rather than carbohydrates. Normally, the carbohydrates contained in food are converted into glucose, which is then transported around the body and is particularly important in fueling brain-function. However, if {{there is very little}} carbohydrate in the diet, the liver converts fat into fatty acids and ketone bodies. The ketone bodies pass into the brain and replace glucose as an energy source. An elevated level of ketone bodies in the blood, a state known as ketosis, leads to a reduction in the frequency of epileptic seizures. Almost half of children, and young people, with epilepsy who have tried some form of this diet saw the number of seizures drop by at least half, and the effect persists even after discontinuing the diet. There is some evidence that adults with epilepsy may benefit from the diet, and that a less strict regimen, such as a modified <b>Atkins</b> <b>diet,</b> is similarly effective. [...] The most common adverse effect is constipation, affecting about 30% of patients—this was due to fluid restriction, which was once a feature of the diet, but this led to increased risk of kidney stones, and is no longer considered beneficial.|$|E
