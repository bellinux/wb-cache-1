5|$|As {{recently}} as the Cretaceous period 100million years ago, much of western North America was still part of the Pacific Ocean. Tectonic forces from the collision of the Farallon Plate with the North American Plate pushed up the Rocky Mountains between 75 and 50million {{years ago in a}} mountain-building episode known as the Laramide orogeny. The Colorado first formed as a west-flowing stream draining the southwestern portion of the range, and the uplift also diverted the Green River from its original course to the Mississippi River west towards the Colorado. About 30 to 20million years ago, volcanic activity related to the orogeny led to the Mid-Tertiary ignimbrite flare-up, which created smaller formations such as the Chiricahua Mountains in Arizona and deposited massive amounts of volcanic ash and debris over the watershed. The Colorado Plateau first began to rise during the Eocene, between about 55 and 34million years ago, but did not attain its present height until about 5million years ago, <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Colorado River established its present course into the Gulf of California.|$|E

25|$|Myocardial {{ischemia}} comes <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> myocardium (the heart muscle) receives insufficient {{blood and}} oxygen to function normally {{either because of}} increased oxygen demand by the myocardium or because of decreased supply to the myocardium. This inadequate perfusion of blood and the resulting reduced delivery of oxygen and nutrients are directly correlated to blocked or narrowed blood vessels.|$|E
25|$|Customers {{under such}} tariffs could see {{significant}} savings by being careful <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> vehicle was charged, for example, {{by using a}} timer to restrict charging to off-peak hours. Thus, an accurate comparison of the benefit requires each household to evaluate its current electrical usage tier and tariffs weighed against the cost of gasoline and the actual observed operational cost of electric mode vehicle operation.|$|E
25|$|The first Yugoslav {{military}} colours came <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Kingdom of Yugoslavia {{was established}} in 1918. These were the square versions of the Flag of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia with the state coat of arms and the motto of the Yugoslav Royal Army. The unit names were attached to a ribbon at the pole. The colours were inspired by the military colours of Serbia and of the Croat, Slovene and Bosnian military units of resistance against Austria-Hungary during the First World War.|$|E

25|$|The Śātavāhana Empire was a royal Indian dynasty based from Amaravati in Andhra Pradesh {{as well as}} Junnar (Pune) and Prathisthan (Paithan) in Maharashtra. The {{territory}} of the empire covered much of India from 230 BCE onward. Although there is some controversy <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> dynasty came to an end, the most liberal estimates suggest that it lasted about 450 years, until around 220 CE. The Satavahanas are credited for establishing peace in the country, resisting the onslaught of foreigners after the decline of Mauryan Empire.|$|E
25|$|In practice, these nulls, {{especially}} in elevation, would move <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> antennas rotated to track a target. At first {{it had been}} believed that {{this would not be}} a serious problem, and that it could be addressed by developing a calibration table for each site. But even the very first tests demonstrated that the calibration changed with wavelength. This mean that they would either have to make multiple calibration tables, one for each wavelength, or that if a single table of corrections for different bearings was desired, the antennas would have to be moved vertically as the wavelength was changed.|$|E
25|$|Knifeline attack (KLA) {{is another}} kind of {{corrosion}} affecting welds, impacting steels stabilized by niobium. Niobium and niobium carbide dissolves in steel at very high temperatures. At some cooling regimes, niobium carbide does not precipitate, and the steel then behaves like unstabilized steel, forming chromium carbide instead. This affects only a thin zone several millimeters wide in the very vicinity of the weld, {{making it difficult to}} spot and increasing the corrosion speed. Structures made of such steels have to be heated in a whole to <b>about</b> , <b>when</b> <b>the</b> chromium carbide dissolves and niobium carbide forms. The cooling rate after this treatment is not important.|$|E

25|$|The {{prototype}} of the P-1, the XPW-8B, came <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Air Service, which had selected the Boeing PW-9 over the PW-8 as its main production fighter, asked Curtiss to modify the last of its three original XPW-8 prototypes with wings resembling those of the PW-9. Curtiss designated the modified aircraft its Model 34A and returned it to the Air Service for evaluation, from which the service ordered it into production as the P-1. The first production P-1, serial number 25-410, was delivered on August 17, 1925, and was followed in successive years by the P-1B and P-1C variants with improved engines. The newest P-1 variants remained in operational service until 1930.|$|E
25|$|The {{language}} of the Amidah most likely dates from the mishnaic period, {{both before and after}} the destruction of the Temple (70 CE) at which time it was considered unnecessary to prescribe its text and content. The Talmud indicates that when Rabbi Gamaliel II undertook to fix definitely the public service and to regulate private devotion, he directed Samuel ha-Katan to write another paragraph inveighing against informers and heretics, which was inserted as the twelfth prayer in modern sequence, making the number of blessings nineteen. Other sources, also in the Talmud, indicate, however, that this prayer was part of the original 18; and that 19 prayers came <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> 15th prayer for the restoration of Jerusalem and of the throne of David (coming of the Messiah) was split into two.|$|E
25|$|Argentina {{admitted}} to the illegal sale of armament by revealing the existence of three secret decrees signed by President Carlos Menem between the years of 1991 and 1995. The controversy regarding the decrees came <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> weapons sold {{did not go to}} Panama, Bolivia, and Venezuela as had been accorded, but instead the weapons ended up in Croatia and Ecuador at times when both of these nations were involved in wars and prohibited from receiving international military aid. The sale Argentina gave to Ecuador included 6.500 tons of rifles, cannons, anti-tank rockets, and ammunition. Menem was taken to court for his alleged association with these illegal acts in 2001, but was acquitted by Argentina's Supreme Court; however, in October 2008 the case was re-opened, but Menem can currently avoid being detained by Argentine authorities until 2010 when his position as senator of La Rioja is finished. Menem claims to have had no association with the illegal weapons trade, and further adds that this is a political persecusion made by Argentine president Cristina Fernández and, her husband and also former Argentine president, Néstor Kirchner.|$|E

25|$|The first {{military}} units in Malaysia {{can be traced}} back to the Penang Rifle Volunteers raised on 1 March 1861, and the Malay States Volunteer Rifles which existed from 1915 to 1936. The birth of the modern Malaysian Army came <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Federal Council of the Federated Malay States passed the Malay Regiment Bill on 23 January 1933. This allowed the initial recruitment of 25 males for the First Experimental Malay Company on 1 March 1933. Major G. McI. S. Bruce of the Lincolnshire Regiment was the first Commanding Officer. By 1 January 1935, the Experimental Company became The Malay Regiment with a complement of 150 men. A battalion was formed on 1 January 1938 and eventually a second battalion on 1 December 1941. The 1st Bn Malay Regiment was famous for its defence of Opium Hill or Bukit Chandu in Singapore. The ‘Battle of Opium Hill’ on 14 February 1942 involved 42 soldiers commanded by Lt. Adnan Bin Saidi who defended their position against attack from the 18th Division of the Japanese Imperial Army under Lt. Gen. Renya Mutaguchi. After World War II and during the Malayan Emergency, the number of battalions was increased to seven in the early 1950s.|$|E
25|$|The coxswain {{would then}} call, 'Boat manned,' to the {{telephone}} operator at the loading station, who, in turn, reported to the 'LC' Control Room. The coxswain would then warn the troops to mind the pulleys {{at the ends of}} falls fore and aft, which could wave freely <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> craft had been set in the water. The task of hooking on and casting off from the ship required skill and seamanship from the coxswain, bowman, and sternsheetsman. The snatch blocks used were heavy steel and difficult to handle. The bowman and sternsheetsman stood by his respective block, as the craft was lowered into the water. At a time when there was sufficient slack in the falls both had to cast off at the same instant, and the blocks had to be released while there was slack in the falls. If the boat was not freed at both ends at once {{the rise and fall of}} the sea could cause the boat to tip, swamp, and perhaps capsize with loss of life. Casting-off was done in all sorts of sea conditions, and the sea might be rising and falling a metre or more (6' swells were not uncommon on D-Day). A combination of skill and luck could redeem a failure to cast-off, nevertheless. On D-Day, an LCA of Royal Marine 535 Flotilla, LSI Glenearn, released all but its after falls, which were jammed, and the craft tilted alarmingly to 45 degrees. The coxswain kept his head, calming the passengers, while seamen worked to free the falls. Once free, the coxswain need to get the LCA away to prevent colliding with the towering side of the LSI as it rose and fell with the swells.|$|E

She came <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> team were asking themselves how to portray Lightning's hidden self. Her appearance is a young version of Serah, but her inner feelings reflect Lightning's hidden emotions. Her personality and actions were made to be unpredictable, with her both aiding and hindering Lightning on her journey. In creating her childlike appearance and extravagant movements, the development team tried to make them as realistic as possible. Lumina is voiced by Jessica DiCicco in English and Kanae Ito in Japanese.|$|E
500|$|Scholars are {{uncertain}} <b>about</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Upanishads were composed. The chronology {{of the early}} Upanishads is difficult to resolve, states philosopher and Sanskritist Stephen Phillips, because all opinions rest on scanty evidence and analysis of archaism, style and repetitions across texts, and are driven by assumptions about likely evolution of ideas, and presumptions about which philosophy might have influenced which other Indian philosophies. Indologist Patrick Olivelle says that [...] "in spite of claims made by some, in reality, any dating of these documents [...] that attempts a precision closer than a few centuries is as stable as a house of cards". Some scholars have tried to analyse similarities between Hindu Upanishads and Buddhist literature to establish chronology for the Upanishads.|$|E
