30|$|Throughout Asia, {{including}} Japan, rice {{plants are}} cultivated {{in a wide}} range of areas from lowlands to highlands and are frequently exposed to fog, including <b>acid</b> <b>fog.</b> Some physiological studies have shown that <b>acid</b> <b>fog</b> can be a stress factor for plants.

40|$|Air {{pollution}} {{is a serious}} environmental and public health problem resulting from emissions by power and industrial plants, motor vehicles, and agriculture. Sulfur (S) and nitrogen (N) emissions are two components of air pollution and cause wide-ranging, long-term threats {{to the health of}} forest, range, and wetland ecosystems. Sulfur and nitrogen gas emissions can combine with moisture in the air to become acidic molecules that fall to earth as acid deposition (commonly called <b>acid</b> rain, <b>fog,</b> or snow). Most pollution control efforts have focused on sulfur dioxide (SO 2) emissions and these efforts have shown some positive results, with a measurable reduction in acidity of some lakes and wetlands. MORE NITROGEN ISN’T ALWAYS A GOOD THING Negative impacts of nitrogen in deposition were overlooked because nitrogen is usually thought of as a fertilizer or a “good thing. ” This is not always the case: Elevated N availability can also result in nutrient imbalances that increase plant susceptibility to stressors such as cold, drought, or pests. For example, winter injury in high-elevation red spruce can be attributed to elevated N. The most serious effect of excess N, however, is the alteration of ecosystem diversity. In most terrestrial ecosystems in the United States, plant growth is limited by nitrogen availability. Thus, when additional nitrogen is added to an ecosystem, native plants (those that are original to a site) may lose their competitive edge. The excess nitrogen allows other plants (which often are nonnative invasive species that do not thrive in low nitrogen) to out-compete native plants and thus alter the species composition of an ecosystem. For example, in Joshua Tree National Park in southern California, N deposition favors the production of sufficient invasive grass biomass to sustain fires that threaten the survival of the namesake species...|$|R
50|$|Shortly after {{returning}} to Berkeley, Cottrell began consulting for the DuPont Company at its explosives- and acids-producing facility near Pinole, California, 20 {{miles north of the}} University. DuPont wanted {{to address the problem of}} precipitating the acid mists which form when sulfur trioxide is bubbled through water or dilute sulfuric acid. Using an electrical method similar to one envisioned by Sir Oliver Lodge in England, Cottrell began experimenting with electrostatic precipitation as a means of collecting sulfuric acid mists. The result of Cottrell’s work was the electrostatic precipitator, a device which could collect fly ash, dust and fumes, <b>acid</b> mists and <b>fogs</b> that spewed from turn-of-the century plants, and which became a primary means for controlling industrial air pollution. Cottrell made it work by developing a reliable high-voltage power supply and electrodes that permitted electrical energy to leak across a gas-filled chamber from many small points. In 1906, electric current was applied to a small laboratory device emitting sulfuric acid mist, and the concept became a reality. The first patent, No. 895,729, was issued on August 11, 1908. The electrostatic precipitator remains a principal technology for pollutant removal from industrial waste flows to this day.|$|R
40|$|In {{the year}} 1783 a fissure {{eruption}} from Laki {{in the southern}} part of Iceland produced a large amount of volcanic gases during a period of eight months. The volcanic gases and aerosols spread across the northern hem sphere due to ideal weather conditions and had a substantial impact on the environment, human health and also climate effects. This, so called dry fog, caused severe health problems, which led to death casualties, killing animals, crops and other vegetation. The consequence was a widespread famine which was aggravated by a hard and long winter in 1783 / 84. Analysis shows that the Icelandic volcanoes are the primary risk to produce dry fog that can affect Sweden. The fog will most likely cause severe health effects, such as respiratory and cardiovascular problems. It will also cause damage to the vegetation, especially coniferous trees, and it may affect the water by <b>acid</b> chock.

40|$|<b>Acid</b> <b>fog</b> {{is complex}} and {{contains}} multiple stimuli that may be capable of inducing bronchoconstriction. These stimuli include sulfuric and niric acids, the principal inorganic acids present; sulfites, formed in the atmosphere as a reaction product of sulfur dioxide and water droplets; fog water itself, a hypoosmolar aerosol; the organic acid hydroxymethanesulfonate, the bisulfite adduct of formaldehyde; and gaseous pollutants, e. g., sulfur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, ozone. Given this complexity, evaluation of the respiratory health effects of naturally occurring <b>acid</b> <b>fog</b> requires assessment of the bronchoconstrictor potency of each component stimulus and possible interactions among these stimuli.

The effect of fog on cell membrane-associated cal-cium (mCa) of leaf mesophyll cells was investigated with the fluorescence probe chlortetracycline (CTC).

Exposure to distilled-water fog also led to reductions in mCa in young needles, suggesting that water films on needle surfaces can induce losses by diffusion between the needle interior and surface.

40|$|Several biotic crises {{during the}} past 300 million years {{have been linked to}} episodes of {{continental}} flood basalt volcanism, and in particular to the release of massive quantities of magmatic sulphur gas species. Flood basalt provinces were typically formed by numerous individual eruptions, each lasting years to decades. However, the environmental impact of these eruptions may have been limited by the occurrence of quiescent periods that lasted hundreds to thousands of years. Here we use a global aerosol model to quantify the sulphur-induced environmental effects of individual, decade-long flood basalt eruptions representative of the Columbia River Basalt Group, 16. 5 – 14. 5 million years ago, and the Deccan Traps, 65 million years ago. For a decade-long eruption of Deccan scale, we calculate a decadal-mean reduction in global surface temperature of 4. 5 [*]K, which would recover within 50 years after an eruption ceased unless climate feedbacks were very different in deep-time climates. <b>Acid</b> mists and <b>fogs</b> could have caused immediate damage to vegetation in some regions, but acid-sensitive land and marine ecosystems were well-buffered against volcanic sulphur deposition effects even during century-long eruptions.

40|$|Abstract: We {{examined}} {{base cation}} leaching from {{the canopy of}} a subtropical rainforest in northeastern Taiwan. The forest is characterized by extremely low levels of base cations in both canopy vegetation and in the soils. The rates of canopy leaching of K+, Ca 2 +, and Mg 2 + were very high, representing up to 30, 35, and 190 %, respectively, of the amount stored in leaves. The rate of H+ retention in the canopy {{was close to the}} rate of base cation leaching, suggest-ing that cation leaching is neutralizing acid precipitation. The subtropical forest studied leached cations from the can-opy throughout the year, unlike temperate deciduous forests, which are physiologically inert in the winter. The forest canopy of the subtropical forest we studied is impacted by <b>acid</b> deposition and <b>fog</b> throughout the winter because of frequent rainfall and high relative humidity. This continuous exposure to acid precipitation could cause more intense negative effects on the canopy of subtropical forests as compared with temperate forests exposed to similar pollution loads.

In order to explore short-term respiratory effects of a realistic acid-polluted fog, we collected samples of <b>acid</b> <b>fog</b> in Brussels, Belgium, which is a densely populated and industrialized city, we defined characteristics of this fog and exposed asthmatic volunteers at rest through a face mask to fogs with physical and chemical characteristics {{similar to those of}} natural fogs assessed in this urban area. Fogwater was sampled using a screen collector where droplets are collected by inertial impaction and chemical content of fogwater was assessed by measurement of conductivity, pH, visible colorimetry, high pressure liquid chromatography, and atomic absorption spectrophotometry over a period of one year. The fogwater composition was dominated by NH 4 + and SO 4 - ions. First we evaluated the possible effect of fog acidity alone. For this purpose 14 subjects with asthma were exposed at rest for 1 hr [mass median aerodynamic diameter to a large-particle (MMAD), 9 microns] aerosol with H 2 SO 4 concentration of 500 micrograms/m 3 (pH 2. 5) and osmolarity of 300 mOsm.

30|$|It {{is known}} that the {{accumulation}} of ROS causes the induction of disease symptoms (Tenhaken et al.

Symptoms were detected after as early as {{a few days of}} acid rain treatment in Arabidopsis, tomato, and cucumber plants (Gabara et al. [2003]; Lee et al.

These data also imply that rice has other antioxidant systems. The difference between rice and susceptible plants such as Arabidopsis is apparent in the concentration of endogenous SA. The rice plant contains much higher levels of SA than Arabidopsis (> 50 times higher) (Yang et al. [2004]) therefore, rice is an SA-insensitive plant. The SA-deficient rice plant is an SA-sensitive plant and showed hypersensitivity to oxidative damage, as indicated by a high level of ROS accumulation. These results suggest that SA is an antioxidant compound (Yang et al. [2004]). Moreover, the level of SA in rice plants may determine the degree of <b>acid</b> <b>fog</b> resistance.|$|E
