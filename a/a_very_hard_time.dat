500|$|Like Amir, {{the protagonist}} of the novel, Hosseini was born in Afghanistan and left {{the country as a}} youth, not {{returning}} until 2003. Thus, he was frequently questioned about the extent of the autobiographical aspects of the book. In response, he said, [...] "When I say some of it is me, then people look unsatisfied. The parallels are pretty obvious, but... I left a few things ambiguous because I wanted to drive the book clubs crazy." [...] Having left the country {{around the time of the}} Soviet invasion, he felt a certain amount of survivor's guilt: [...] "Whenever I read stories about Afghanistan my reaction was always tinged with guilt. A lot of my childhood friends had <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time.</b> Some of our cousins died. One died in a fuel truck trying to escape Afghanistan [...] Talk about guilt. He was one of the kids I grew up with flying kites. His father was shot." [...] Regardless, he maintains that the plot is fictional. Later, when writing his second novel, A Thousand Splendid Suns (then titled Dreaming in Titanic City), Hosseini remarked that he was happy that the main characters were women as it [...] "should put the end to the autobiographical question once and for all".|$|E

After Brosnan left school, he pursued {{a career in}} art and began working as an illustrator. “I {{always wanted to be}} an artist, a painter. I started as a Trainee Artist in a small studio in South London.” A colleague suggested that Pierce attend a theatre workshop, and eventually he abandoned his artwork to pursue a career in acting. Brosnan took up painting again in the late 1980s during his first wife’s illness as he found it therapeutic. “Sometimes dramatic moments affect the way you see yourself in the world…from <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> in my life, I started painting again and out came every color I could imagine.” Citing his influences as Picasso, Matisse, Bonnard and Kandinsky, Brosnan spends much of his free time between film shoots in front of his easel. “I am self taught, an enthusiastic painter as a friend of mine likes to say.” [...] He has continued painting since then, using spare time on set and at home. Profits from sales of giclée prints of his works are given to a trust to benefit [...] "environmental, children's and women's health charities." [...] Since Harris' death, Brosnan has been an advocate for cancer awareness and, in 2006, he served as spokesperson for Lee National Denim Day, a breast cancer fundraiser which raises millions of dollars and raises more money in a single day than any other breast cancer fundraiser.|$|E

[...] Abrams commented, [...] There are too many people out there who love Nancy Grace, who watch Nancy Grace on a regular basis, who are going to see Anthony out there somewhere and are going to give her <b>a</b> <b>very,</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> wherever she goes.|$|R

2500|$|Promiscuities received, in general, {{negative}} reviews. A New York Times review characterized Wolf as a [...] "frustratingly inept messenger: {{a sloppy}} thinker and incompetent writer. She tries {{in vain to}} pass off tired observations as radical aperçus, subjective musings as generational truths, sappy suggestions as useful ideas". Two days earlier, however, a different Times reviewer praised the book, writing, [...] "Anyone—particularly anyone who, like Ms. Wolf, {{was born in the}} 1960s—will have <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> putting down Promiscuities. Told through a series of confessions, her book is a searing and thoroughly fascinating exploration of the complex wildlife of female sexuality and desire." [...] In contrast, The Library Journal excoriated the work, writing, [...] "Overgeneralization abounds as she attempts to apply the microcosmic events of this mostly white, middle-class, liberal milieu to a whole generation....There is a desperate defensiveness in the tone of this book which diminishes the force of her argument." ...|$|E

'Unhorsed! unhorsed!' cried the people; and Rosald then himself dismounted and helped his adversary to rise.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The rapid {{expansion}} of information technologies in almost all sectors of the society induces lifelong learning (LLL) in our days. Learning something new can be an easy and quick task, or <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> and long <b>time</b> procedure. The maximum efficiency in learning is achieved when you train the right skills at the right time, for the correct period of time (with the right intensity). Based on this idea, we believe that a virtual “software trainer ” can help us make proficiency by instruction and practice efficiently ourselves, more on what is new for us. Also we can plan the training, {{so that we do}} not waste time on things we already know, or too much time on parts we can learn faster. These arguments could emphasize the future of e-learning...|$|R

40|$|In {{the year}} 2002 a {{commission}} wasappointed {{by the government}} and taskedto clear up possible flaws in the lawgoverning spatial planning (Plan ochbygglagen, PBL). The commission's reportlaid the foundations for a new law whichwas adopted by the Swedish parliament onthe 20 th of June 2010 and is scheduledto come into effect on the 2 nd of May 2011. The purpose of this thesis has been toexamine the changes made in the new law,primarily from a civil-rights point ofview, focusing on the appeal process. This is a highly interesting subjectconsidering one reason behind the newlaw was to simplify and streamline theplanning process while keeping civilrights intact. Through a comprehensive literature studyand interviews with experts the currentplanning process was mapped out andrelevant changes in the new law wereexamined. After the study had beenconcluded we were able to distinguishseveral areas that underwent especiallyinteresting changes;The requirement of a plan program wasremoved and the exhibition process wasremoved and replaced by a writtenreview. Individuals were given thepossibility of requesting a plan notice. The different spatial plan documentswere merged into one single document andthe number of responsible authoritiesfor spatial plans is no longer limitedto one. The study has shown that the aspirationfor a more effective spatial planningprocess has mostly been conducted at theexpense of individual rights. The single biggest obstacle forachieving a democratic planning processis learning how the law works and howthe spatial planning process isimplemented, this is has been proven tobe <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> and <b>time</b> consuming taskfor individuals to undertake...|$|R
