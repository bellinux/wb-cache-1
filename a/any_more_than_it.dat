25|$|Many consequentialist {{theories}} {{may seem}} {{primarily concerned with}} human beings and their relationships with other human beings. However, some philosophers argue {{that we should not}} limit our ethical consideration to the interests of human beings alone. Jeremy Bentham, who is regarded as the founder of utilitarianism, argues that animals can experience pleasure and pain, thus demanding that 'non-human animals' should be a serious object of moral concern. More recently, Peter Singer has argued that it is unreasonable that we do not give equal consideration to the interests of animals as to those of human beings when we choose the way we are to treat them. Such equal consideration does not necessarily imply identical treatment of humans and non-humans, <b>any</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> necessarily implies identical treatment of all humans.|$|E

500|$|In January 2009, {{hundreds}} of Millwall fans perceived as [...] "high risk" [...] individuals {{gained access to}} an FA Cup fourth-round match away at Hull City. The game, won 2–0 by Hull, was overshadowed when seats, coins and plastic bottles were thrown by some away supporters. There were conflicting reports in the media as to whether missiles were initially thrown by Hull supporters following chanting and jeering by Millwall fans of Jimmy Bullard (an ex-West Ham player) {{just prior to the}} fixture. On 25 August 2009, Millwall played away at West Ham United in the Football League Cup, losing 3–1 after extra time. One Millwall supporter was stabbed during clashes between the two sets of fans outside the ground. The game saw {{hundreds of}} West Ham fans invade the pitch on three occasions, forcing the game to be temporarily suspended once. The police later said the violence, because of its scale, was organised beforehand. In the aftermath of the disorder, Millwall were handed three charges by the FA and later cleared of all of them; West Ham received four charges and were found guilty on two counts: violent, threatening, obscene and provocative behaviour, and entering the field of play. West Ham were fined £115,000, an amount seen as an insult by Millwall, which staunchly defended the actions of its own fans and the club's inability to do <b>any</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> had for a match at a rival's ground.|$|E

500|$|... "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] {{describes}} {{a series of}} conflicts between reality and the Romantic ideal of uniting with nature. In the words of Richard Fogle, [...] "The principal stress of the poem is a struggle between ideal and actual: inclusive terms which, however, contain more particular antitheses of pleasure and pain, of imagination and common sense reason, of fullness and privation, of permanence and change, {{of nature and the}} human, of art and life, freedom and bondage, waking and dream." [...] Of course, the nightingale's song is the dominant image and dominant [...] "voice" [...] within the ode. The nightingale is also the object of empathy and praise within the poem. However, the nightingale and the discussion of the nightingale is not simply about the bird or the song, but about human experience in general. This {{is not to say that}} the song is a simple metaphor, but it is a complex image that is formed through the interaction of the conflicting voices of praise and questioning. On this theme, David Perkins summarizes the way [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] and [...] "Ode on a Grecian Urn" [...] perform this when he says, [...] "we are dealing with a talent, indeed an entire approach to poetry, in which symbol, however necessary, may possibly not satisfy as the principal concern of poetry, <b>any</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> could with Shakespeare, but is rather an element in the poetry and drama of human reactions". However, there is a difference between an urn and a nightingale in that the nightingale is not an eternal entity. Furthermore, in creating any aspect of the nightingale immortal during the poem the narrator separates any union that he can have with the nightingale.|$|E

2500|$|Objects {{viewed in}} a (plane) mirror will appear {{laterally}} inverted (e.g., if one raises one's right hand, the image's left hand will appear {{to go up}} in the mirror), but not vertically inverted (in the image a person's head still appears above his body). However, a mirror does not usually [...] "swap" [...] left and right <b>any</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> swaps top and bottom. A mirror typically reverses the forward/backward axis.

2500|$|Criticism of the ode {{during the}} 1980s ranged in {{emphasis}} on which {{aspects of the}} poem were most important, but critics were mostly positive regardless of their approach. In 1980, Hunter Davies analysed {{the period of time}} when Wordsworth worked on the ode and included it as one of the [...] "scores of poems of unarguable genius", and later declared the poem Wordsworth's [...] "greatest ode". Stephen Gill, in a study of the style of the 1802 poems, argued in 1989 that the poems were new and broad in range with the ode containing [...] "impassioned sublimity". He later compared the ode with Wordsworth's [...] "Ode to Duty" [...] to declare that [...] "The Ode: Intimations, by contrast, rich in phrases that have entered the language and provided titles for other people's books, is Wordsworth's greatest achievement in rhythm and cadence. Together with Tintern Abbey it has always commanded attention as Wordsworth's strongest meditative poem and Wordsworth indicated his assessment of it by ensuring through the layout and printing of his volumes that the Ode stood apart." [...] In 1986, Marjorie Levinson searched for a political basis in many of Wordsworth's poems and argued that the ode, along with [...] "Michael", Peele Castle, and Tintern Abbey, are [...] "incontestably among the poet's greatest works". Susan Wolfson, in the same year, claimed that [...] "the force of the last lines arises from the way the language in which the poet expresses a resolution of grief at the same time renders a metaphor that implies that grief has not been resolved so much as repressed and buried. And this ambiguity involves another, for Wordsworth makes it impossible to decide whether the tension between resolution and repression... is his indirect confession of a failure to achieve transcendence or a knowing evasion of an imperative to do so." [...] After performing a Freudian-based analysis of the ode, William Galperin, in 1989, argues that [...] "Criticism, in short, cannot accept responsibility for The Excursions failings <b>any</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>it</b> is likely to attribute the success of the 'Intimations Ode' to the satisfaction it offers in seeing a sense of entitlement, or self-worth, defended rather than challenged." ...|$|E
