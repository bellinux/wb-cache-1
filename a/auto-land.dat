40|$|This paper {{presents}} an <b>auto-landing</b> controller for glide-slope tracking and the flare maneuver via adaptive backstepping design and describes a flight path command generator for indirect altitude control {{in order to}} provide precise altitude trajectories for <b>auto-landing</b> of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Using the adaptive backstepping procedure to synthesize a glide-slope tracking and flare maneuver control law is being used differently from designing the guidance and control loops separately in autopilot. An adaptive controller is proposed to control aircraft from glide-slope to flare by following the flight path angle command for indirect altitude control via elevator and maintaining the constant airspeed control via throttle. Simulation results demonstrate that the adaptive <b>auto-landing</b> controller is capable of effectively guiding the UAV along the flight path angle command under the presence of the wind turbulence.

40|$|Autonomous landing, {{also called}} <b>auto-landing,</b> {{is one of}} the most {{specific}} features for miniature quadrotor UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles). In this paper, an <b>auto-landing</b> control scheme is presented. It can be regarded as one-step-further development for our quadrotor UAV systems which are capable of auto altitude holding, auto position holding and point-to-point auto-navigation in outdoor environments. Using the state measurements from 9 DOF IMU (inertial measurement unit), sonar/barometer, accelerometer and GPS, a set of linear P+D+DD controller for attitude control and translation control have been implemented in a control system configuration including an outer positioning loop and an inner attitude loop. Based on the reliable position hold control, the <b>auto-landing</b> is realized by descending the target altitude gradually using the altitude, vertical velocity and vertical acceleration feedback. Given the control strategy, the effectiveness of the landing control algorithm is validated by successful experimental outcomes...|$|R
40|$|In {{the paper}} {{presented}} at UKIERI 2009 Workshop, an Extended Minimum Resource Allocation Neural Network (EMRANN) based controller was designed for <b>auto-landing</b> of high performance fighter aircraft subjected to severe wind and ineffective control surfaces due to stuck actuators. The performance of EMRANN was compared with a classical Baseline Trajectory Following Controller (BTFC). Under certain failure conditions, {{it was found that}} the BTFC alone could not meet the required performance for landing whereas EMRANN augmentation considerably improved the ability of BTFC to handle large faults while meeting the desired flight path and stringent touchdown conditions for <b>auto-landing.</b> This paper presents the design and implementation of a fuzzy controller named SAFIS (sequential adaptive fuzzy inference system). SAFIS is functionally equivalent to EMRANN. The performance of SAFIS is found to be identical or slightly better than EMRANN and also it requires less number of rules as compared to number of neurons for EMRAN...|$|R

50|$|On {{its first}} attempt, a clogged igniter orifice {{prevented}} ignition. On the second attempt, {{the first leg}} flight was perfect; increased guidance and control capabilities allowed the module to, in Carmack's words, 'burn the X-mark off the target pad'. The return leg was delayed slightly, because the igniter had clogged again. When the second leg was attempted, a 'hard start' cracked the graphite combustion chamber. As the vehicle was still flying, Carmack flew the crippled vehicle through the course {{as quickly as possible}} and hovered 2-3 meters above the landing pad. With only a few seconds remaining in the required flight time, the damaged combustion chamber cracked again, which caused the vehicle to tilt enough to trigger a computer abort. The vehicle performed an <b>auto-land,</b> but the tilt caused the module to tip over on landing after only 82 seconds in the air.|$|E
25|$|The {{aviation}} {{travel industry}} {{is affected by}} the severity of fog conditions. Even though modern <b>auto-landing</b> computers can put an aircraft down without the aid of a pilot, personnel manning an airport control tower must be able to see if aircraft are sitting on the runway awaiting takeoff. Safe operations are difficult in thick fog, and civilian airports may forbid takeoffs and landings until conditions improve.|$|R

For additional safety features, the TF-X would automatically land at the nearest airport if the operator becomes unresponsive. Additionally, if a TF-X operator declares an emergency, the authorities will be automatically notified {{of the situation and}} the TF-X can be landed in a non-approved landing zone. The TF-X also features a backup full vehicle parachute system that can be activated if the operator believes the vehicle is incapable of <b>auto-landing.</b>|$|R

The wake-vortex upset hazard {{is an important factor in}} establishing the minimum safe spacing between aircraft during landing and take-off operations, thus impacting airport capacity. A batch simulation study was conducted to assess the sensitivity of various safe landing criteria in the development of an acceptable wake encounter boundary. A baseline six-degree-of-freedom simulation of a B 737 - 100 airplane was modified to include a wake model and the vortex-induced forces and moments.

40|$|Thousands of {{landings}} {{in commercial}} transport-category (FAA, 2013) airplanes are executed {{every single day}} all over the world. Accurate touchdowns are crucial in saving excessive {{wear and tear on}} brakes, tires, and airplane structure. They are especially critical when landing on wet and/or contaminated runways or during LAHSO operations. Despite so much operational experience, the control of landing flare and touchdown accuracy is still a “hit or miss ” event. The statistics on touchdown points and the large scatter of data indicates that landings are not very accurate even when full <b>auto-land</b> capabilities are used (FAA, 2007). Large operational cushions (67 % for dry DLDR and 92 % for wet WLDR runway) are provided over (un-factored gross measured) demonstrated dry landing distance (gross DDLD) for airplanes used in commercial air transportation (e. g., Title 14 CFR 121). Contaminated runways may require 2 - 3 times longer runway lengths than DDLD (Daidzic & Shrestha, 2008; Daidzic, 2011 a). The highest frequency of transport-category airplane incident/accidents occurs indeed during the landing/rollout phase...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{adaptive}} neural {{fuzzy inference}} system {{is used to}} simulate trajectory tracking in aircraft landing operations management.

40|$|Abstract- It is a {{well-known}} fact about the degree of difficulty associated during the landing phase of an Aircraft. An efficient and a reliable <b>auto-landing</b> controller are therefore specially needed for auto landing purpose. A good number of parameters have to be controlled during the landing phase like the approach velocity, Heading, Heading offset, vertical velocity, flare, altitude, alignment of the aircraft etc., which makes the application of conventional controllers expensive for the purpose. This is precisely where fuzzy logic can be used. Using fuzzy sets and fuzzy set operation, {{it is possible to}} design a fuzzy reasoning system, which can act as a controller. Potentially, applications of such knowledge-based approach to controller design can result in efficiency, time and cost savings. The aircraft used in this project is a Personnel launching system (PLS) model given in the Aerosim adds in Matlab. The model of the PLS itself is unstabl...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- In {{this paper}} the <b>auto-landing</b> {{problem of a}} high {{performance}} fighter aircraft has been addressed. During landing, the flight path consists of flight segments such as a wing-level flight, a coordinated turn, glide slope descent and finally the flare maneuver and touchdown on the runway. The trajectory segments corresponding to these phases have to be flown {{in the presence of}} severe winds. A detailed description of the wind model is also being considered. These tend to cause deviation of the aircraft from the specified trajectory. However, it has to be ensured that all trajectory deviations are within specified limits. The touch conditions are given with tight specifications, named for convenience as the touch-down pill box. The controller is first designed to meet all these specifications for all these phases under no failure conditions of the actuators. We then augment the controller {{to be able to handle}} the same flight segments but with the occurrence of certain failure conditions of the actuators...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel {{formulation of the}} flight dynamic equations that permits a rapid solution {{for the design of}} trajectory following autopilots for nonlinear aircraft dynamic models. A robust autopilot control structure is developed based on the combination of the good features the nonlinear dynamic inversion (NDI) method, integrator backstepping method, time scale separation and control allocation methods. The aircraft equations of motion are formulated in suitable variables so that the matrices involved in the block backstepping control design method are diagonally dominant. This allows us to use a linear controller structure for a trajectory following autopilot for the nonlinear aircraft model using the well known loop by loop controller design approach. The resulting autopilot for the fixed-wing rigid-body aircraft with a cascaded structure {{is referred to as the}} diagonally dominant backstepping (DDBS) controller. The method is illustrated here for an aircraft <b>auto-landing</b> problem under unknown actuator failures and severe winds. The issue of state and control surface limiting is also addressed in the context of the design of the DDBS controller...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the CIRA’s flying test facility for autonomous mid-air flight and landing on runways instrumented by Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) base station. The {{aim of the}} paper is to describe the facility used for testing <b>auto-landing</b> and mid-air flight algorithms, using many different sources to determine a hybrid position of the vehicle with high precision level. Highly precise navigation is the core technology required for many applications, such as automated aerial refuelling, sea-based joint precision approach and landing systems, station-keeping, unmanned aerial vehicles swarming and formation flight, and unmanned ground vehicles convoys. Current navigation efforts presented in literature are focused on carrier-phase {{differential global positioning system}} integrated with inertial measurement data, but it must to emphasize that this solution may not be sufficient in certain tactical environments and low-cost Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) {{may not be able to}} bridge GPS outages with sufficient accuracy.

The sensors we used are: two GPS, a laser altimeter, an AHRS (Attitude Heading Reference System), and an ADS (Air Data System). By using the above listed sensor measures in a sensor fusion algorithm, we obtained a high precision level in navigation measurements.
