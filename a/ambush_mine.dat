However, the ambush was always triggered by electrically detonating a mine, when enemy troops moved within the mines killing range.|$|R
50|$|General Cantillo's {{plan was}} to bring a direct attack on Castro's base in the Sierra Maestra. Earlier attacks into the hills {{from the north and}} east had failed miserably, as the attackers had run into <b>ambushes</b> and <b>mine</b> fields. Thanks to local support, Castro's forces knew about the army's attacks well {{beforehand}} and were able to stop them.|$|R
25|$|A 9 December clash in the Tiguidit {{escarpment}} area (south of In-Gall {{and east}} of Agadez) was reported by both sides as resulting in civilian casualties. The government reported that army forces fired on civilian vehicles who wandered into fighting with MNJ units who had been <b>ambushed</b> laying <b>mines.</b> The MNJ countered that government militias attacked a civilian convoy, killing a number of civilians, including two Libyan foreign workers.|$|R
50|$|Demolitions expert: There are two {{demolition}} {{experts in}} every team. They are proficient {{with the use}} of mines and explosives. The purpose of the demolition experts is to give the teams the ability to conduct <b>ambushes</b> using <b>mines,</b> and to perform sabotage with explosives. They are trained on every mine-system in the Swedish Armed Forces and how to employ them effectively. The demolitions experts also carry the team's main support weapon, the FN MINIMI.|$|R

FRELIMO guerillas also destroyed a bridge on July 25. An <b>ambush</b> with <b>mines</b> was also organized on the road leading to bridge and a lorry loaded with Portugues soldiers was destroyed and at least 10 soldiers died...|$|R
5000|$|A free fire {{policy was}} adopted by the IDF. The policy {{included}} patrols, <b>ambushes,</b> laying <b>mines,</b> setting booby traps and carrying out periodic search operations in Israeli Arab villages. The [...] "free fire" [...] policy in the period of 1949 to 1956 has been estimated to account for 2,700 to 5,000 Palestinian Arab deaths. During anti-infiltration operations the Israeli forces sometimes committed atrocities with reports of gang rape, murder and the dumping of 120 suspected infiltrators in the Avara desert without water.|$|R
50|$|Nuba militia fighters found a {{breeding}} ground {{in the presence of}} rebels fighters. Tarrevera militia fighters, from Morou, crossed the road for every vehicle; evacuating Baggara and executing them. They placed road <b>mines</b> and <b>ambushed</b> cars. When <b>mines</b> went off, they would attack; kill or loot goods and then they would escape to mountains or densely forested valleys.|$|R

50|$|This tactic {{had some}} success as Massoud was forced to sign a cease fire treaty in January 1983 that would last for one year in order to rebuild his organization. The bottom line though was that these {{victories}} were very temporary. There were serious issues with this tactic of large punitive offensives {{that contributed to the}} stalemate that characterized the war. Mujahideen forces would often learn of coming offensives in advance from their compatriots in the DRA army. Not only could civilians and guerrillas move safely {{out of the way of}} the majority of the bombs but guerrillas could also plan <b>ambushes,</b> lay <b>mines,</b> and move weapons caches. Once armored personnel carriers and helicopters came the guerrillas would retreat into the side valleys and carry out small ambushes rather than openly confront the Soviets.|$|R
50|$|According to legend, but not {{supported}} by historical records, the Peralta family owned land near the Superstition Mountains. The Peralta Massacre is a legend that Apaches supposedly <b>ambushed</b> a <b>mining</b> expedition the family sent into the mountains. Some carved stones {{in the area are}} referred to as “Peralta Stones” and Spanish text and crude maps on them are considered by some to be clues to the location of a Peralta family gold mine in the Superstition Mountains, although others believe the stones to be modern fakes. The last patriarch of the family was supposedly a large landowner named Don Miguel Peralta (who some claim was the one with the land grant (or perhaps sold a false land grant) that became part of the Reavis fraud). The Peralta mine in the Superstition Mountains is part of the legends about the origin of the Lost Dutchman's Gold Mine.|$|R
25|$|Most {{likely because}} Pedro de Peralta {{had been the}} Spanish Governor of New Mexico (in the 1600s) his family name of “Peralta” was the {{inspiration}} {{for a number of}} legends in the American Southwest. James Reavis tried to assert that the Peralta family had a Spanish land grant and a barony granted by the King of Spain, which included a huge swath of Arizona and New Mexico, including the Superstition Mountains. The Peralta Massacre is a legend that Apaches supposedly <b>ambushed</b> a <b>mining</b> expedition the Peralta family sent into the mountains. Some carved stones in the area are referred to as “Peralta Stones” and Spanish text and crude maps on them are considered by some to be clues to the location of a Peralta family gold mine in the Superstition Mountains, although others believe the stones to be modern fakes. A lack of historical records leaves uncertainty as to whether a Peralta family ever had possession of land, or mines, in or near the Superstition Mountains.|$|R
50|$|The {{military}} of Sri Lanka {{claimed that}} {{the leader of the}} LTTE, Velupillai Prabhakaran, was seriously injured during air strikes carried out by the Sri Lanka Air Force on a bunker complex in Jayanthinagar on 26 November 2007. Earlier, on 2 November 2007, S. P. Thamilselvan, the head of the LTTE political wing, was killed during another government air raid. The Sri Lanka Air Force openly vowed to destroy the entire leadership of the LTTE. On 5 January 2008, Colonel Charles, Head of LTTE Military Intelligence, was killed in a claymore <b>mine</b> <b>ambush</b> by a Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol (Sri Lanka) (LRRP).|$|R
500|$|Land mines {{were used}} by the SADF and SWAPO and became a major feature of the war, {{triggering}} the development of mine-protected vehicles (MPV). The SADF typically laid marked, fenced, anti-personnel minefields as perimeter protection for bases and vital assets. It laid a reported 45,000 mines during the conflict, of which 3,000 were unaccounted-for when UNTAG arrived. SWAPO used <b>mines</b> for <b>ambushing</b> or intimidation. <b>Mines</b> were laid individually or in clusters; anti-tank mines were often stacked. The mines were obtained from South Africa, the USSR, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. After initial training by the SADF's 25th Field Squadron, an early task of the Field Troop was to conduct mine-awareness training for the other contingents. For {{the remainder of the}} deployment, much of the work of the 75 field engineers was clearing exposed mines, marking minefields and clearing routes. Crocker wrote, [...] "for {{the first time since the}} Vietnam War, Australian Sappers hand cleared their way into live minefields on seven separate occasions to destroy exposed mines. Similar mines killed several civilians and many animals during the mission. Field engineers of the contingent destroyed over 5,000 items of unexploded ordnance (UXO) ranging from artillery shells, through RPG rockets to grenades. UXO, a legacy of the 20-year Bush War, posed a major hazard to local inhabitants in the northern provinces and to UNTAG personnel in that area".|$|R
2500|$|... 4 RAR/NZ {{had begun}} to meet strong {{resistance}} within its AO. On 30 January all four rifle companies clashed with small two to five-man groups of Viet Cong within {{the space of a}} few hours, killing five and uncovering another camp as well as quantities of ammunition, medical supplies and rice. Meanwhile, after an uneventful period at the Horseshoe, the New Zealand V Company joined 4RAR/NZ following its relief-in-place by C Company. After landing V Company commenced moving towards it patrol area and soon found itself in an entrenched camp, locating a number of caches. An ambush was then established on tracks approaching the bunker system by 3 Platoon, who killed three Viet Cong over the following two days. The next day, 31 January D Company contacted one Viet Cong soldier at 09:15 without result and the Australians subsequently attempted to follow-up. An hour later 10 Platoon was <b>ambushed</b> with claymore <b>mines,</b> rocket propelled grenades and small arms by five to 10 Viet Cong soldiers located in a bunker system, killing two Australians and wounding two more. The Australians resisted strongly however, and the platoon's fire eventually forced the Viet Cong to break contact and withdraw west. During the opening burst of fire Private Malcolm Gibson, an acting section commander, had been knocked unconscious and after recovering he crawled forward under heavy fire to man the machine-gun, providing covering fire to his section despite having the pack shot off his back. He then regrouped his men and provided effective fire support for the remainder the platoon. For his leadership and courage he was later awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal.|$|R
5|$|With {{the start}} of the fire preparation, tank hunting detachments—groups of ten {{equipped}} with RPG-7 rockets, RPG-43 grenades, and AT-3 Sagger missiles—crossed the canal to deploy one kilometer deep, quickly occupying the tank ramparts, and proceeded to set up <b>ambushes</b> and lay <b>mines.</b> When the first barrage ended, Egyptian artillery began a second, 22 minute-long barrage, against targets at a depth of 1.5–3kilometers. At this time, 14:20, the first wave of assault infantry, 4,000 men, began crossing the canal. Around 2,500 dinghies and wooden boats were used to transport the troops. Smoke canisters were used at the crossing points to provide cover. During the night of October 5, engineers had blocked the underwater pipes on the opposite bank, preventing the Israelis from releasing flammable oil into the canal and igniting it. The first wave was lightly equipped, armed with RPG-7s, Strela 2 AA missiles and rope ladders to deploy on the sand wall. Among the first wave were combat engineers and several units of Sa'iqa (lightning; these were commando forces), who were tasked with setting up ambushes on reinforcement routes. The Sa'iqa attacked command posts and artillery batteries in order to deny the Israelis control over their forces, while the engineers breached the minefields and barbed wire surrounding Israeli defenses. Immediately following them, military engineers transported the water pumps to the opposite bank and began setting them up. At this time Egyptian aircraft involved in the air strike began returning. Five aircraft were lost, although {{by the end of the}} day this rose to ten. The air strike put the Bir Gifgafa and Bir Thamada air bases out of operation for 48 hours, and damaged the Ras Nasrani and Bir Hasanah airbases. Around ten HAWK batteries, at least two 175mm artillery batteries, an electronic jamming center at Umm Khashib, and various radar stations were destroyed. This allowed the Egyptian Air Force to operate for the rest of the war without any ground-based communications interference, as the only other jamming center in the Sinai was located at el-Arish, considerably behind the front. Over a dozen AS-5 Kelt missiles were fired from Tu-16 bombers as well. Several were shot down, but at least five hit their targets, including two missiles fitted with anti-radiation seekers that knocked out Israeli radars. The success of the air strike caused the Egyptians to cancel a planned second air strike. Another account however states that 18 Egyptian aircraft were lost, and these losses prompted the canceling of a second wave of airstrikes.|$|R
