Buildings such as Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, designed by Frank Gehry, are of this type, becoming a tourist attraction as well <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> international museum. Other apparently usable buildings are really follies, deliberately constructed for a decorative purpose and never intended to be practical.|$|E

It is viewed by senior RAF officers <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> design success, that to enable and control the aircraft's vertical flight required only a single lever added in the cockpit. For horizontal flight, the nozzles are directed rearwards by shifting the lever to the forward position; for short or vertical takeoffs and landings, the lever is pulled back to point the nozzles downwards.|$|E
