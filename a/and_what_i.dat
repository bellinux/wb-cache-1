5|$|After {{having my}} own child, it's pretty amazing what females are capable of. We're Supergirl, {{we do it}} all: we give the love, we give the milk. On the other hand, I'm running a business.

If that's what I'm gonna be called by being {{assertive}} and knowing who I am <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> want out of life, then so be it. I will wear that label proudly. For me it's about turning that word into a positive.|$|E

When I finish playing the game, it's not how much money I made that is going to be my legacy. It's how I played the game, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> did on the field.|$|E

5|$|Ten Nights in a Bar Room is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. Adapted from the novel Ten Nights in a Bar-Room <b>and</b> <b>What</b> <b>I</b> Saw There by Timothy Shay Arthur, the production focuses on Joe Morgan after {{he has become a}} hopeless drunkard. Often Morgan's young daughter, Mary, comes to beg her father to return home. One day, she appears during a fight between the two men and is fatally struck by a bottle thrown by the saloon-keeper. Before Mary dies she asks her father to promise to swear off alcohol and he accepts. He is reformed and becomes successful, while the saloon-keeper is killed in a fight in an irony of fate. The film was released on November 4, 1910 and met with mixed reviews. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} {{was based on}} Ten Nights in a Bar-Room <b>and</b> <b>What</b> <b>I</b> Saw There by Timothy Shay Arthur. The plot focused {{on the dangers of}} alcoholism and the downfall of those taken in by its effects. In the 1850s, sales of the novel were second only to Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin. The {{production was}} adapted for the stage in 1858 and while it did not perform well on Broadway, it proved to be a lasting success. Dozens of productions would cross the United States for the next sixty years and the play proved to be a major influence on the Temperance movement, resulting in the passage of temperance laws. It is likely that the writer of the scenario was Lloyd Lonergan. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson. Cameramen employed by the company during this era included Blair Smith, Carl Louis Gregory, and Alfred H. Moses, Jr. though none are specifically credited. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. Only the roles of Frank H. Crane and Marie Eline are known. The other cast credits are unknown, but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary. In late 1910, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list includes G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Frank H. Crane, Irene Crane, Marie Eline, Violet Heming, Martin J. Faust, Thomas Fortune, George Middleton, Grace Moore, John W. Noble, Anna Rosemond, Mrs. George Walters.|$|E

500|$|Nora Ephron {{wrote the}} {{introduction}} to Beckerman's eponymous 1995 book, which she immediately thought had dramatic possibilities. [...] She identified with the stories in Love, Loss, <b>and</b> <b>What</b> <b>I</b> Wore because the book [...] "is not about fashion; it is about what clothes really are to us, those moments when we are constantly trying to find our identity through them". [...] Soon after its publication, Ephron gave the book to eight of her friends for Christmas. She became interested in writing her {{own version of the}} book. [...] Once she decided to adapt Love, Loss, <b>and</b> <b>What</b> <b>I</b> Wore into a play, she and her sister emailed 100 women for stories.|$|E

500|$|Opting {{to shoot}} using Mitchell cameras {{incorporating}} 35mm Eastman Kodak film and anamorphic lenses, Warren recalls that the produced footage boasted [...] "an incredibly sharp image <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> would term as the 'American' look." [...] He remembers that {{the setting of}} the Chislehurst Caves rendered the subterranean complex more realistic than a potential in-studio alternative given the modest budget of Inseminoid. However, the cold, damp, airless conditions, combined with the uneven surface of the cave floors, complicated the filming sessions and necessitated frequent repairs of equipment.|$|E
500|$|The film's soundtrack {{and score}} were {{composed}} by Ilaiyaraaja, this being his 100th film.

Mahendra recalled in 2007, [...] "When I first met [...] I explained him what my kind of movie is <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> expect from him. The background score should allow meaningful silences in my films. I believe silence conveys more than words or music".|$|E

Only stuff from before I started making records, so it was pre-1989—Waylon, Willie, Buck Owens, Haggard, Don Williams, Jim Croce. <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> discovered was a simplicity in song that I had moved away from. It was quite an emotional journey because these were all the songs that moved me and inspired me to do what I've been doing ever since." ...|$|E

The song was the essence of how I felt: seeing the beauty and horror of a place, and going into a heightened state." [...] She elaborated, [...] "My songs are all about who I am <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> am feeling, {{which is why they}} can take so much out of me to perform – and I always feel a lot when I go to Africa".|$|E
