60|$|I'm {{going to}} stick close to my desk for <b>a</b> <b>month,</b> <b>now,</b> hoping to write a small book.|$|E
6000|$|... "And you {{probably}} think that I ought to be," [...] she remarked. [...] "Well, I never was conventional. You know that. I shut myself up for <b>a</b> <b>month.</b> <b>Now</b> I expect my friends to come and console me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Letters! Say, my boy, it'd take {{something}} pretty {{important to get}} me or any man here back Casita way. If the town is safe these days the road isn't. It's <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>now</b> since any one went to Casita." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{there was}} <b>a</b> <b>month</b> lost, or nearly. Letters go only once <b>a</b> <b>month.</b> And <b>now</b> they can't hear from Marmaduke or Bessy,"--Lady Rowley's name was Bessy,--"till the {{beginning}} of September." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “You ain’t had a {{dressing}} down in <b>a</b> <b>month,</b> an’ <b>now</b> I’m a-goin’ ter {{give it to}} yer good!” he exclaimed, as he raised the whip and rushed at Leo.|$|R
6000|$|... '"Is that all?" [...] he says, laughing. [...] "Let me refresh your memory. In <b>a</b> <b>month</b> from <b>now</b> I {{can give}} you a hundred dollars for your account of the conversation." ...|$|R
6000|$|It was January. In <b>a</b> <b>month,</b> <b>now,</b> Mother {{would be}} {{grunting}} heavily and beginning {{the labor of}} buying for the tea-room. So far she had done nothing but crochet two or three million tidies for the tea-room chairs, [...] "to make them look homey." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There," [...] {{he said as}} he entered; [...] "we can do for <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>now,</b> if needs be. There is a {{party of}} militia in the village, and I hear the whole coast is closely watched, {{and there are a number}} of English cruisers among the islands." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Every {{salesman}} on {{the staff}} has tried to sell this asinine Boutell family and failed. We've got the lots--give 'em anything from a fifteen-thousand-dollar-restriction, water-front, high-class development to an odd lot behind an Italian truck-farm. They've been considering a lot at Villa Estates for <b>a</b> <b>month,</b> <b>now,</b> and they aren't--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am puzzled, Hilton," [...] she said. [...] "I made a wager with Uncle that {{he would}} not catch a dozen good trout in <b>a</b> <b>month,</b> and <b>now</b> I fancy that he will win it." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{whole time}} {{occupied}} by these transactions in Cyprus {{was only about}} <b>a</b> <b>month,</b> and <b>now,</b> since every thing had been finished to his satisfaction, Richard began to think once more of prosecuting his voyage.|$|R
50|$|In a 2014 {{article on}} Comics Alliance about why women in comics {{do not speak}} up about sexual harassment, Juliet Kahn opens by saying: I have been {{a woman in the}} comics {{industry}} for <b>a</b> few <b>months</b> <b>now.</b> It has been wonderful. It has also been terrifying.|$|R
60|$|His brief {{visit to}} England was already drawing to its close, and, {{in less than}} <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>now,</b> he {{proposed}} to set out for Africa once more. This time he meant to finish the work. If only his life were spared, he would crush for ever the infamous trade which turned a paradise into a wilderness.|$|E
6000|$|Again Desmond {{said nothing}} for a few moments. Then he laughed. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "there's the Palestrina, and when we shake her up she can do her {{fourteen}} knots. You can have her for a shooting expedition at a pound <b>a</b> <b>month.</b> <b>Now</b> don't raise any--nonsensical objections. I'm about sick of loafing. The thing would be a relief to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{would like}} very much {{to hear from you}} oftener, it has been more than <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>now</b> since you wrote. Write soon and tell me how you are, and when school will be out, for we want plenty of {{holidays}} in July so we can have a good time. I am going to send you something nice the last of this week. What do you guess it will be? ...|$|E
60|$|The {{knife and}} fork, so contemptuously flung aside <b>a</b> <b>month</b> before, Tarzan <b>now</b> {{manipulated}} as exquisitely {{as did the}} polished D'Arnot.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't get sich an idee {{into your}} head, lad," [...] the old sailor said cheerily. [...] "We're {{right in the}} track of traders an' steamers; {{but this is the}} wrong season of the year. <b>A</b> <b>month</b> from <b>now</b> you'll see two or three a week." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A lake {{lies about}} two days' march up the east branch, and there's {{an island in}} it with a sandy tongue at one end. Take this list of {{provisions}} and have a cache made there. Get them up in <b>a</b> <b>month</b> from <b>now.</b> You can do that?" ...|$|R
60|$|Always {{bright light}} will blaze upon me. And then, {{when they have}} well wearied me, they will lead me out one morning in a shirt without a collar and drop me through the trap. Oh, I know. The rope they will do it with is well-stretched. For many <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>now</b> the hangman of Folsom has been {{stretching}} it with heavy weights so as to take the spring out of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "And there's the Freemasons. They must meet, you know, sir, in course, {{because of}} the dooties. But if you'll believe me, sir, they don't so much as wet their whistles. They don't indeed. It always {{used to be a}} supper, and that was once <b>a</b> <b>month.</b> <b>Now</b> they pays a rent {{for the use of the}} room! Who is to get a living out of that, sir?--not in the way of a waiter, that is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's as {{plain as}} can be," [...] he said. [...] "See, here's one system of waves and here's another! These are prices for Union Pacifics--extending over <b>a</b> <b>month.</b> <b>Now</b> next week, mark my words, they'll be down one whole point. We're getting near the steep {{part of the}} curve again. See? It's {{absolutely}} scientific. It's verifiable. Well, and apply it! You buy in the hollow and sell on the crest, and there you are!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Somewhere near it," [...] was the candid admission. [...] "Never mind, Horridge, you've {{done your}} bit. You shall pass on your {{experience}} {{to a new}} hand, take your pension and try the south coast of England for <b>a</b> few <b>months.</b> <b>Now</b> let's get on with it. You know what I want to hear about." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ramsden {{is now a}} Franchise owner for VIP45 Limited a Prestige {{car dealer}} in West Yorkshire. He {{provides}} prestige and performance cars to footballers. Ramsden enjoys many holidays. He has been known since retirement to go {{on at least two}} holidays <b>a</b> <b>month.</b> Friends <b>now</b> compare him to Judith Charlmers.|$|R
50|$|Racing success did {{not last}} long once Agostinis bike was improved. In May 1972, Bruno Spaggiari {{finished}} third in the Italian Grand Prix at Imola, with Paul Smart in fourth, reversing their finishing order in the 200 of <b>a</b> <b>month</b> before. <b>Now</b> the twin could not match Agostini on the MV triple.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{it makes}} no difference," [...] Godfrey urged. [...] "We are not due at Pekin on any given day. It is very {{pleasant}} out here, where one can enjoy one's freedom and exult {{that there is no}} policeman or Cossack watching every movement. It would make no difference to me if we stopped here for <b>a</b> <b>month.</b> <b>Now</b> let me pull those boots off for you, then you can sit with your feet in this little pool." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{seemed to}} me that if I could be of any use in the world anywhere, I could in the place where I was born, and where my whole {{childhood}} was spent. I've been at home <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>now,</b> the most useless person in Hatboro'. I did catch at the first thing that offered--at Mr. Brandreth and his ridiculous Social Union and theatricals, and brought all this trouble on myself. I talked to Mr. Peck about them. You know what his views are?" ...|$|E
60|$|On {{the morning}} in question, Eveline Annersly, who had been at Prospect <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>now,</b> sat beside her rejoicing in the {{sunshine}} and rush of warm wind. She had reached the age when one looks for little and makes the most of what comes, and the warmth and freshness of the morning delighted her. The prospect would also in all probability have had its attractions for any one with eyes to see and a nature that could respond to the reawakening pulse {{of life in the}} land.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes; {{after three}} days he got so weak and useless he could not go on. It must be <b>a</b> <b>month</b> by <b>now</b> since he reached home again. I went on and visited every castle, and looked in every house. But {{there were no signs}} of her; and so I gave it up.' ...|$|R
50|$|With Recep being Zeynep’s only {{relative}} {{in the big}} city, {{she will}} have to stay at Recep’s house for <b>a</b> few <b>months.</b> <b>Now</b> that Zeynep has been included in his life, Recep tries every kind of activity to socialize and get rid of his depression, including going to the theater and even attending karate classes. However, nothing seems to work for Recep.|$|R
6000|$|Corliss {{took up the}} cards, but {{paused in}} the shuffling. [...] "We've a big trip before us, Del, about <b>a</b> <b>month</b> from <b>now,</b> the middle of March as near as I can plan it,--up the Stuart River to McQuestion; up McQuestion and back again down the Mayo; then across country to Mazy May, winding up at Henderson Creek--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish to {{communicate}} with Mr. Logie, at Tangiers," [...] the governor said. [...] "It is <b>a</b> <b>month,</b> <b>now,</b> since we have had any news from him. At the time he last wrote, {{he said that the}} Emperor of Morocco was manifesting an unfriendly spirit towards us; and that he was certainly in close communication with the Spaniards, and had allowed their ships to take more than one English vessel lying under the guns of the town. His own position was, he said, little better than that of a prisoner--for he was closely watched.|$|E
6000|$|... "That I shall. It is <b>a</b> <b>month</b> <b>now</b> since I had a change, and my jerkin is all {{stained with}} blood. I want a wash more than anything; {{for there was}} no water near the hut, and the {{charcoal}} burner used {{to bring in a}} small keg from a spring he passed on his way to his work. That was enough for drinking, but not enough for washing--a matter which never seemed to have entered into his head, or that of the Jew, as being in the slightest degree necessary." ...|$|E
60|$|Peechy, {{who could}} {{at any time}} tell as many stories in an evening as his hearers could digest in <b>a</b> <b>month,</b> <b>now</b> resumed the conversation, by affirming that, to his knowledge, money had at {{different}} times been dug up {{in various parts of}} the island. The lucky persons who had discovered them had always dreamt of them three times beforehand, and what was worthy of remark, these treasures had never been found but by some descendant of the good old Dutch families, which clearly proved that they had been buried by Dutchmen in the olden time.|$|E
50|$|United Nations Security Council Resolution 219, adopted {{unanimously}} on December 17, 1965, after reaffirming previous resolutions on the topic, the Council {{extended the}} stationing in Cyprus of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus for <b>an</b> additional 3 <b>months,</b> <b>now</b> ending on March 26, 1966.|$|R
60|$|Nearly <b>a</b> <b>month</b> had <b>now</b> {{passed since}} the party had located at Mosquito Hollow, {{and in that time}} they had taken out three small nuggets worth {{probably}} fifty dollars apiece, and a little short of a hundred and fifty ounces of gold dust. Counting the gold dust as worth sixteen dollars an ounce, this gave them, in round figures, twenty-five hundred dollars for their labor.|$|R
50|$|Dr. Jason Howard is a {{resident}} surgeon at Massachusetts General. When a patient of his is admitted complaining of heart problems and later dies, Jason finds that, though having received {{a clean bill}} of health less than <b>a</b> <b>month</b> before, that the heart attack came totally out of left field and the patient looks decidedly older than he ought to at 56. Soon two more cases come to his attention, both healthy <b>a</b> <b>month</b> before, <b>now</b> dead, both looking older than their years.|$|R
