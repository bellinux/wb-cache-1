Directed by Ridley Scott, DiCaprio dyed his hair brown and wore brown contacts for the role, which he chose to pursue because he considered it a throwback to political films of the 1970s such as The Parallax View (1974) <b>and</b> <b>Three</b> <b>Days</b> of the Condor (1975). The film received mixed reviews from critics, and at a budget of US$67.5 million, became a moderate box office success, grossing US$115 million worldwide.|$|E

Wisden Cricketers' Almanack considered the incident of such significance that it reprinted the whole correspondence. The letter gives a detailed contemporary account of what Lord Harris thought about the riot.|$|E

5|$|The largest bores occur {{around the}} times of the {{equinoxes}} but smaller ones can be seen throughout the year. There are about 260 bores in each year occurring twice a day on 130 days.

Maximum bores occur between one <b>and</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> after new and full moons, and smaller ones on the days that precede and follow the maxima.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} Hurricane Neki {{were from a}} surface trough that persisted near the equator in the central Pacific Ocean {{in the middle of}} October 2009. A weak {{tropical}} disturbance became evident in the trough on October15, <b>and</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> later the system began developing curved bands of convection on its northern and southern periphery. This created an unusually large gyre for the region. Following the formation of a well-defined circulation, it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Three-C late on October18, about 730mi (1175km) south of Ka Lae, Hawaii.|$|E

5|$|B'Day is {{the second}} studio album by American singer Beyoncé. It was {{released}} to coincide with her twenty-fifth birthday on September 4, 2006 through Columbia Records, Music World Entertainment, and Sony Urban Music, <b>and</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> earlier in Latin America through Sony BMG Music Entertainment. The record was originally planned as a 2004 follow-up to Beyoncé's debut studio album Dangerously in Love (2003), however it was delayed to accommodate the recording of Destiny's Child's final studio album Destiny Fulfilled (2004) and her starring role in the film Dreamgirls (2006). While on vacation after filming Dreamgirls, Beyoncé began contacting various producers; she rented Sony Music Studios, and completed B'Day in three weeks. Most of the lyrical content of the album was inspired by Beyoncé's role in the film. The album's musical style ranges from 1970s–80s funk influences and balladry to urban contemporary elements such as hip hop and R. Live instrumentation was employed in recording most of the tracks as part of Beyoncé's vision of creating a record using live instruments.|$|E
5|$|Diving {{planes were}} {{initially}} only fitted at the stern, but additional planes were {{mounted on the}} conning tower during construction of B1, B2, and B3; B4 was not fitted with them and it is uncertain if the remaining boats received them during construction. These greatly improved the boats' depth-keeping, surfacing and diving abilities compared to the A-class boats. These were later exchanged for bow planes; the last boat to receive them was B6, which did not get hers until January 1916. The B-class submarines lacked any internal bulkheads which exposed the crew to the petrol engine's exhaust fumes. In fact mice were used to detect any concentrations of carbon monoxide inside the hull. Ventilation was provided for the batteries, but none for the crew's living area. No accommodations were provided for the crew and {{they were forced to}} improvise while at sea. In recognition of this issue, the crew's endurance was only expected to be four days during the summer <b>and</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> during the winter.|$|E
5|$|He {{was offered}} the job as manager of Second Division club Middlesbrough on his 38th {{birthday}} in 1973.

He refused a contract, and would never sign a contract throughout his managerial career. He took a salary of £10,000 a year despite the chairman being willing to pay a lot more; his only stipulations were a gentleman's agreement that he would not be sacked, assurances that he would have no interference from the board in team affairs, <b>and</b> <b>three</b> <b>days</b> off a week for fishing and shooting. He decided to first repaint Ayresome Park and to publicise the upcoming league campaign so as to generate higher attendance figures.|$|E
