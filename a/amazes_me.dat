500|$|Scenes from White Zombie have {{appeared}} in other films including Curtis Hanson's The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, Michael Almereyda's Nadja, and Tim Burton's Ed Wood. The heavy metal band White Zombie appropriated their name from the film. The group's vocalist Rob Zombie said of the film, [...] " [...] a great film that {{not a lot of}} people know about...It <b>amazes</b> <b>me</b> that a film that is so readily available can be so lost." [...] In 1997, the Janus company released a model kit based on the Murder Legendre character.|$|E
500|$|Of Rubber Souls [...] "If I Needed Someone", Harrison said: [...] "it's like {{a million}} other songs written around the D chord. If you move your fingers about, you get various little melodies... it <b>amazes</b> <b>me</b> that people still find new {{permutations}} of the same notes." [...] His other contribution to the album, [...] "Think for Yourself", features what Everett described as [...] "ambiguous tonal coloring", using chromaticism in G major with a [...] "strange" [...] mixture of the Dorian mode and the minor pentatonic; he called it a [...] "tour de force of altered scale degrees". In 1966 Harrison contributed innovative musical ideas to Revolver. He played backwards guitar on Lennon's composition [...] "I'm Only Sleeping" [...] and a guitar counter-melody on [...] "And Your Bird Can Sing" [...] that moved in parallel octaves above McCartney's bass downbeats. His guitar playing on [...] "I Want to Tell You" [...] exemplified the pairing of altered chordal colours with descending chromatic lines and his guitar part for Sgt Peppers [...] "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" [...] mirrors Lennon's vocal line {{in much the same}} way that a sarangi player accompanies a khyal singer in a Hindu devotional song.|$|E

2500|$|Mark Bell's {{programming}} {{gave the}} song its [...] "militaristic mode", which further conveys {{the sense of}} mission expressed in the lyrics. Björk had recorded the vocals, bass line and chord structure of [...] "Hunter" [...] before Bell met her in Spain; he recorded the beats in one take after she had explained to him how she wanted them to sound like. In an interview with Sweater, Björk said: [...] "It <b>amazes</b> <b>me</b> that people still can't grasp that live element of it." [...] Regarding {{the beat of the}} song, engineer Markus Dravs stated it [...] "is very much a Mark Bell beat interpretation of her. The idea of it being a Boleric beat was hers, but we tried different versions and I think it was Mark in the end {{who came up with the}} idea of just doing it on a 909. Then we all had a go on the filtering and played around with the decay of each individual drum." ...|$|E

I handled it better than I thought I would". Dr. Bass's findings indicated no signs of foul play. He was quoted as saying, [...] "There are fractures from head to toe.
