500|$|Many reviewers criticised Toadstool Tours use of camera, {{especially}} when the ball's presented route would ignore obstacles. GameSpot otherwise welcomed the game's visuals, however, arguing that the recurring Mario characters [...] "never looked better". IGN also lauded the graphics [...] present in the full motion video {{and the rest of}} the game, as well as Toadstool Tours audio. Matt Casamassina acknowledged the characters' voiced taunts, saying [...] "the muttering, complaining Waluigi, never fails to bring <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>to</b> our faces".|$|E
500|$|The film's {{original}} {{score was}} composed by James Horner. Though Horner's previous work comprised mostly high-budget studio films [...] including Titanic (1997), Braveheart (1995), The Mask of Zorro (1998), and Apollo 13 (1995) [...] producer Bonnie Curtis approached him to score The Chumscrubber because [...] "You never know until you ask." [...] Horner agreed after seeing an early {{cut of the}} film. He and Posin spent five days on a soundstage, experimenting with different musical arrangements. Posin described the final product as [...] "dramatic with a wink and <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>to</b> it".|$|E

500|$|After Hitler's {{mother died}} of breast cancer in 1907, the funeral {{procession}} went through Urfahr to Leonding. Kubizek remarks that Hitler said he had seen Stefanie at the funeral procession, which gave him some consolation. Kubizek claims that [...] "Stefanie had no idea how deeply Adolf was in love with her; she regarded him as a somewhat shy, but nevertheless remarkably tenacious and faithful, admirer. When she responded with <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>to</b> his inquiring glance, he was happy and his mood became unlike anything I had ever observed in him. But when Stefanie, as happened just as often, coldly ignored his gaze, he was crushed and ready to destroy himself and the whole world." ...|$|E
500|$|Apart {{from her}} autobiography, Bondfield {{contributed to a}} {{collection}} of essays entitled What Life Has Taught Me, in which 25 public figures pondered on the lessons of life. Bondfield wrote that her religious convictions gave her [...] "strength to meet defeat with <b>a</b> <b>smile,</b> <b>to</b> face success with a sense of responsibility; to be willing to do one's best without hope of reward [...] to bear misrepresentation without giving way to futile bitterness". In March 1948 Bondfield opened the Mary Macarthur Home at Poulton-le-Fylde, near Blackpool in Lancashire, which provided subsidised holidays for low-paid women workers. In 1949 she made a six-month speaking tour of the United States, her final visit to the country; she left convinced that America would soon adopt a national health service.|$|E
500|$|Combat in Killer7 {{occurs when}} the player {{encounters}} enemies called [...] "Heaven Smiles". Smiles announce their presence with a laughing sound effect and are initially invisible. The player must switch to a first-person viewpoint and scan the surroundings to reveal Smiles. While in first-person view, movement is disabled and the analog stick aims the character's gun. Targeting specific body parts will disable them; for example, shooting off a leg will cause <b>a</b> <b>Smile</b> <b>to</b> {{fall to the ground}} and crawl toward the player. The player may aim for a [...] "critical point" [...] that instantly destroys the Smile. Smiles that get too close will explode and injure the character. If a character dies, players can use Garcian Smith to retrieve the fallen character's head and bring them back to life; if Garcian dies, then the game ends.|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} to the game's negative response, GameZone said {{that even though the}} game does not feature continuous play, [...] "the action flows well once into an event". GameZone's review praised the game's audio track, and thought it was [...] "fun" [...] because the comedy is straight from the television show, and the characters will [...] "bring <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>to</b> your face". Reiner also commented positively on the soundtrack and that the game {{may not be the best}} wrestling game available, [...] "but it delivers what the cover advertises". GameSpot's Frank Provo said that [...] "wit" [...] and [...] "charm" [...] are the two most redeeming features of The Simpsons Wrestling, and in spite of the game's weak gameplay, it has [...] "plenty of laughs in store" [...] that devoted fans of The Simpsons will enjoy. The BBC's David Gibbon wrote that the end result of the track is one that will not [...] "fail to impress fans".|$|E
500|$|Starting from Avalanche Studios' inception, the company's {{primary focus}} {{is to create}} open world sandbox games, citing Elite as their inspiration. According to Blomberg, the studio has always been {{interested}} in creating open world games, and they aimed to be [...] "the best" [...] in developing them. The company seeks to remain flexible to market changes and tries not to limit themselves to one business model. Avalanche also focuses on developing games with long gameplay length and high replay value. Sundberg considers Avalanche Studios to be an independent company, and often keeps the rights to their intellectual properties. Sundberg also stated that video game developers should not put too much weight in income; as a result, the company seldom develops [...] "forced" [...] multiplayer modes, as they believe that approach [...] "makes absolutely no sense" [...] and does not add any value to the game. When seeking future projects, the studio chooses projects that they are passionate about and allow creative freedom. They only make games that [...] " [...] love to play" [...] or games that [...] "can bring <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>to</b> people's faces".|$|E
500|$|Marie: Julien visits Marie and Simon's old apartment, {{where the}} letting agent shows him {{a room that}} Julien chillingly {{recognises}} — it {{is identical to the}} room Marie has prepared. This is where Marie hanged herself, trying to frame Simon in revenge after a terrible row. Julien returns home and Marie silently leads him to the attic where she has prepared a noose, feeling she has to hang herself again. Julien carries her downstairs, and they make love again. She leaves to meet Adrienne, who says that she knows that Marie no longer wants to die. They agree they do not know the rules of their situation. Returning, Marie interrupts Julien about to hang himself {{in a desperate attempt to}} join her. He runs to the kitchen and tries to slit his wrist; Marie stops him and her wrist and his palm are cut. Marie warns him that he will lose all memory of her, but he says that all he wants is for her to be there. Marie slowly covers her face with her hands —"the forbidden sign"— and Julien becomes oblivious to her and unaware of why he is bleeding. Madame X arrives for her letter and he hands it over, confused by her enquiries about [...] "l'autre personne". Madame X burns the letter, freeing Adrienne. Marie cries while watching Julien sleep, and as her tears land on her wrist her cut bleeds. Julien wakes and asks who she is; she replies that she is [...] "the one he loved". He doubts it as she's [...] "not his type", but she says with <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>to</b> give her a little time.|$|E

500|$|Schlattmann {{thought to}} write the comic book store {{homicide}} storyline when {{he picked up the}} Aquaman snow globe in his office and thought, [...] "'Wow, this thing could easily be a murder weapon," [...] because of its weight and its edge. The writers wanted to use the actual Aquaman globe but DC Comics would not allow the character and the snow globe {{to be used in the}} episode, so the Dexter art department custom-made a snow globe. The superhero's name ultimately became [...] "Mariner" [...] as other names including [...] "Sea King" [...] and [...] "King of the Seas" [...] could not be used for legal reasons. Trademark and copyright clearances was again an issue when finding a name for the superhero based on the Bay Harbor Butcher. [...] "The Eradicator" [...] and [...] "Judge Justice" [...] were considered, but the final choice was [...] "The Dark Defender". Cerone said that the name was [...] "a little on the generic side, but it was one we could clear." [...] He said that The Dark Defender was in part an homage to [...] and [...] to Dexter's Dark Passenger, featured in Jeff Lindsay's series of Dexter novels on which the television series is based. On the poster, The Dark Defender, though hooded, was drawn with <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>to</b> resemble Michael C. Hall. The poster was rendered by comic artist Tone Rodriguez, with whom Schlattmann had previously worked on a screenplay in development at 20th Century Fox. When Schlattmann visited Rodriguez's studio in Los Angeles to discuss the art, comic book writer Dan Wickline was also there. Schlattmann thought that [...] "by including the two of them, we could make things a bit more special and add some credibility to the show". Wickline played the dead comic book shopkeeper, while Rodriguez played the prime suspect for the murder. The Dark Defender character also lent its name to a series of highly stylized Dexter webisodes, recapping Dexter's victims of the second season.|$|E
2500|$|More recent reviews {{have been}} kinder to the album: Allmusic said {{the songs on}} the album were [...] "totally irresistible, danceable, easy to sing along to, and {{guaranteed}} to bring <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>to</b> the face of pop dominated at the time by synthesizers and good-looking young men who looked more like girls".|$|E

2500|$|Sarah Ward of Screen International {{praised the}} film's visual {{aesthetic}} and screenplay as [...] "involving and entrancing." [...] In her review, Ward concludes: [...] " [...] is a beautiful, heart-swelling animated movie, to be certain, but it's also one that knows that such picturesque sights and pleasant sensations {{are only part}} of the equation. In a review for TheWrap, Dan Callahan found In This Corner of the World to be [...] "beautiful but erratic", disapproving the screenplay but opining that the film [...] "is bound to bring <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>to</b> the face." ...|$|E

[...] During one promotional appearance in Washington, D.C., Clinton {{went up to the}} orange figure and said, [...] "Hello, Mr. Squirrel, how are you? I wanted you to get you a copy of my book," [...] adding, [...] "you bring <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>to</b> a lot of people's faces." [...] The copy she gave the squirrel was inscribed, [...] "Squirrel – Please make a hard choice and read my book! Hillary".|$|E
2500|$|Matt Whittaker of Hardcore Gamer {{gave the}} game a 3.5/5 and wrote: [...] "Evaluating NBA 2K16 {{as a whole}} is {{actually}} an interesting challenge. On one hand, this is arguably the most mechanically sound sports game on the market and the gameplay improvements that Visual Concepts made are downright superb. The issue here lies with the decision to make Livin ‘Da Dream the focus and backbone of MyCareer falling flat. There are some moments throughout Spike Lee’s in-game film that might bring <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>to</b> your face, but this story doesn’t lend itself to this franchise’s gameplay or the video game medium itself. Yes, basketball fans will likely have a great time playing NBA 2K16 for hours on end, but there are too many small steps back here that can’t be ignored. The good news for fans of sports games is that the first misstep in this great franchise is still a very good game, which speaks to how truly fun its gameplay is." ...|$|E

2500|$|Upon release, {{the film}} opened to {{positive}} reviews. Critics praised the film for its simplicity, its romance, {{saying that it}} was [...] "one of the finest romantic films to come out of Bollywood in 2007". The film's direction and performances were particularly appreciated. Taran Adarsh from indiaFM gave the film a 3.5 out of 5 rating saying it is [...] "as refreshing as an ice-cold watermelon juice in scorching heat." [...] Subhash K. Jha wrote, [...] "...Jab We Met is the kind of cinematic experience that is hard to come by {{in this day and age}} of smoky cynicism and borrowed rage." [...] Rajeev Masand from CNN-IBN, who gave the film 3 stars out of 5, described it as [...] "a film bursting with the kind of lovely little moments that'll bring <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>to</b> your face. Khaled Mohamed, of the Hindustan Times, gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, saying the film, [...] "is quite a delight, particularly for the chirpy-chirpy-cheep-cheep girl and the retentive, moan-groan boy. Directed with a flair for garnishing even the most abject of circumstances with humour and irony, here’s a feel-cool movie. Wonderful.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the most}} {{successful}} East Asian, and Asian tennis player ever, Li {{has become one of}} the most well-known and marketable athletes in the world. In 2013, Li appeared on the cover of Time magazine, which named her to its annual list of the 100 Most Influential People in the World; Li being one of only four athletes to be named on the list. Former world No. 1 Chris Evert writes: [...] "Tennis has exploded in China. The country now has some 15 million tennis players; 116 million watched Li win the French Open. That kind of exposure is crucial to our sport, and it never would have happened without Li. At tournaments, I've seen her charm the crowds. When she smiles, everyone melts. She's just such a breath of fresh air. Her friendly on-court demeanour as well as her hilariously-witty post-match interviews brings <b>a</b> <b>smile</b> <b>to</b> everyone's face." [...] Li also appeared on the cover of 26 May 2014 edition of Time magazine, which featured an article titled [...] "The Passion of Li Na", in which author Hannah Beech described Li as a world class sports idol, inspiring millions of Chinese people to regard her as an icon of pursuing independent character and freedom of thought. In 2012, Forbes listed Li as No. 85 in the Forbes Celebrity 100 list. Li, along with the fellow tennis players Maria Sharapova and Serena Williams, were the only three female athletes who cracked the Top 100 earning list. Li was ranked No. 5 and No.8 on the Forbes China Celebrity 100 list in 2012 and 2014 respectively. Li is affectionately called [...] "Big Sister Na" [...] (娜姐, pinyin: Nàjiě) among Chinese communities and is considered a [...] "strong, unbending and unyielding" [...] role model. She has not only become a household name across China but a global icon, with her Sina Weibo microblogging having over 23 million followers as of October 2014. Her perceived rebelliousness, exemplified by the rose tattoo on her chest and her previous run-ins with government sports programs, also helped boost her popularity. On 15 April 2015, Li received the Laureus Academy Exceptional Achievement award at the Laureus World Sports Awards held in Shanghai. She was also a nominee for the Laureus World Sportswoman of the Year award, alongside Serena Williams.|$|E
