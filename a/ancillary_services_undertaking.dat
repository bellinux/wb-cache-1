We study how the firm’s ability to charge discriminatory main service prices affects its decision of whether to unbundle the <b>ancillary</b> <b>service</b> from the main service and charge separate prices. Unlike a firm using uniform pricing of main service that unbundles the <b>ancillary</b> <b>service</b> if the consumers that value the main service higher have a high likelihood of purchasing the <b>ancillary</b> <b>service,</b> a firm using discriminatory pricing of main <b>service</b> unbundles the <b>ancillary</b> <b>service</b> if the consumers that value the main service higher have a low likelihood of purchasing the <b>ancillary</b> <b>service.</b> Moreover, discriminatory pricing of main service makes unbundling more (less) {{likely to be the}} optimal <b>ancillary</b> <b>service</b> strategy when consumers’ main <b>service</b> valuations and <b>ancillary</b> <b>service</b> valuations are negatively (positively) correlated. Finally, we characterize how firms’ use of main service price discrimination and consumers’ valuation structure (i. e., whether the correlation between consumers’ main <b>service</b> valuations and <b>ancillary</b> <b>service</b> valuations is positive or negative) jointly determine the <b>ancillary</b> <b>service</b> strategies in an industry...|$|R

40|$|Artículos en revistasUnder a {{deregulated}} environment, <b>ancillary</b> <b>services</b> (AS) {{are defined}} as the set of products separated from the energy production, which are related to security and reliability of a power system. <b>Ancillary</b> <b>services</b> can be classified in: (a) active power <b>ancillary</b> <b>services</b> (load&# 8211;frequency control (LFC) &# 8212;including primary control, automatic generation control (AGC), tertiary control, balancing service and black start provision) and (b) reactive power <b>ancillary</b> <b>services</b> (voltage control). The system operator is the entity responsible for the secure operation of the power system and in this way, the management of all the AS is considered a specific function of the system operator.

Hydroelectric resources have significant <b>ancillary</b> <b>service</b> capability because of their dynamic flexibility. This paper suggests a solution for optimal bidding for hydro units operating in simultaneous markets for energy and <b>ancillary</b> <b>services</b> by estimating water shadow price from operating parameters of the hydro unit, expectations on prices of energy and <b>ancillary</b> <b>services,</b> and water availability. The model implications are illustrated on a numerical example of a hydro unit operating in markets of New York Independent System Operator. Participation in <b>ancillary</b> <b>services</b> market increases or decreases water shadow price depending on water availability.

40|$|All {{users of}} an {{electrical}} power system expect that the frequency and voltages are maintained within acceptable boundaries at all times. Some participants, mainly generating units, provide the necessary frequency and voltage control <b>services,</b> called <b>ancillary</b> <b>services.</b> Since these participants are entitled to receive a payment for the services provided, markets for <b>ancillary</b> <b>services</b> have been developed along with the liberalisation of electricity markets.

40|$|Motivated by airline baggage fees, we {{consider}} a service provider offering a main service (e. g., transporting a person) and an <b>ancillary</b> <b>service</b> (e. g., transporting a checked bag) {{that an individual}} customer {{may or may not}} need. We ask whether the firm should bundle the two services and post a single price or unbundle them and price the <b>ancillary</b> <b>service</b> separately. We consider two motivations for unbundling the services. The first focuses on altering consumer behavior to lower the firm’s costs. We assume that providing the <b>ancillary</b> <b>service</b> is costly but consumers can exert effort {{in order to reduce the}} rate at which the <b>ancillary</b> <b>service</b> is needed. We show that the firm unbundles and sets the fee for the <b>ancillary</b> <b>service</b> at the same level the social planner would. Profit maximization thus results in social efficiency. The second rationale for unbundling is segmentation. We assume that there are two segments that differ in the rate at which they use the <b>ancillary</b> <b>service.</b> The optimal contracts impose higher <b>ancillary</b> <b>service</b> fees on those less likely to use the service. In the airline setting, this would imply that business travelers would face higher baggage fees than leisure travelers. We conclude that the way in which airlines have implemented baggage fees is more consistent with attempts to control consumer behavior than segment customers. 1...|$|R

40|$|<b>Ancillary</b> <b>services</b> {{are those}} {{functions}} performed by electrical generating, transmission, system-control, and distribution-system equipment and people {{to support the}} basic services of generating capacity, energy supply, and power delivery. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission defined <b>ancillary</b> <b>services</b> as ``those services necessary to support the transmission of electric power from seller to purchaser given the obligations of control areas and transmitting utilities within those control areas to maintain reliable operations of the interconnected transmission system. `` FERC identified six <b>ancillary</b> <b>services</b> reactive power and voltage control, loss compensation, scheduling and dispatch, load following, system protection, and energy imbalance.

We also suggest that FERC define more sharply all of the <b>ancillary</b> <b>services.</b> especially load-following reserve and energy imbalance.

40|$|In {{competitive}} electricity markets, {{the costs}} for each <b>ancillary</b> <b>service</b> should be charged {{to those who}} cause the costs to be incurred with charges based on the {{factors that contribute to}} these costs. For example, the amount of generating capacity assigned to the regulation service {{is a function of the}} short-term volatility of system load. Therefore, the charges for regulation should be related to the volatility of each load, not to its average demand. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) requires this as well. In its recent Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, FERC wrote (1999), “The Commission believes that, whenever it is economically feasible, it is important for the RTO [regional transmission organization] to provide accurate price signals that reflect the costs of supplying <b>ancillary</b> <b>services</b> to particular customers. ” Earlier, FERC (1996) wrote in its Order 888, “Because customers that take similar amounts of transmission service may require different amounts of some <b>ancillary</b> <b>services,</b> bundling these services with basic transmission service would result in some customers having to take and pay for more or less of an <b>ancillary</b> <b>service</b> than they use. For these reasons, the Commission concludes that the six required <b>ancillary</b> <b>services</b> should not be bundled with transmission service. ” Fortunately customer specific measurement and allocation of <b>ancillary</b> <b>service</b> consumption can be done...|$|R
