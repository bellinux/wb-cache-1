40|$|Beryllium is {{difficult}} to weld because it is highly susceptible to cracking. The most commonly used filler metal in beryllium welds is Al- 12 wt. % Si. Beryllium has been successfully welded using Al-Si filler metal with more than 30 wt. % Al. This filler creates an aluminum-rich fusion zone with a low melting point that tends to backfill cracks. Drawbacks to adding a filler metal include a reduction in service temperature, a lowering of the tensile strength of the weld, and the possibility for galvanic corrosion to occur at the weld. To evaluate the degree of interaction between Be and Al-Si in an actual weld, sections from a mock beryllium weldment were exposed to 0. 1 M Cl{sup {minus}} solution. Results indicate that the galvanic couple between Be and the Al-Si weld material results in the cathodic protection of the weld and of the anodic dissolution of the bulk Be material. While the cathodic protection of Al is generally inefficient, the high <b>anodic</b> <b>dissolution</b> <b>rate</b> of the bulk Be during pitting corrosion combined with the insulating properties of the Be oxide afford some protection of the Al-Si weld material.

The corrosion rates {{increased in the}} following order: AZ 501 < AZ 21 < AZ 91. The: corrosion behaviour was related to alloy microstructure as revealed by optical and electron microscopy. The beta phase was very stable in the test solution and was an effective cathode. The beta phase served two roles, as a barrier and as a galvanic cathode. If the beta phase {{is present in the}} alpha matrix as intergranular precipitates with a small volume fraction, then the beta phase mainly serves as a galvanic cathode, and accelerates the corrosion of the alpha matrix. If the beta Fraction is high, then the beta phase may mainly act as an anodic barrier to inhibit the overall corrosion of the alloy. The composition and compositional distribution in the alpha phase is also crucial to the overall corrosion performance of dual phase alloys. Increasing the aluminum concentration in the alpha phase increases the <b>anodic</b> <b>dissolution</b> <b>rate</b> and also increases the cathodic hydrogen evolution rate.

40|$|Modern steel alloys are {{composed}} of several phases, for example ferrite and martensite. By varying the fraction or {{the size of the}} grains of these phases, the mechanical properties of the alloy can be altered. These microstructural variations were already found before to influence the corrosion properties of the alloy; this has been investigated in this master thesis by means of electrochemical experiments. The prior austenite grain size has been varied for fully martensitic samples; it was found that grain boundaries are less noble sites in the lattice and that an increase in prior austenite grain boundary density would increase the corrosion rate. Grain boundaries were also found to be anodic initiation sites for pits. However, since the fine microstructures have more initiation sites, fewer pits would grow critical {{due to the lack of}} compensating cathode area. The depth and size of the pits in the fine-grained material were found to be larger than those in the coarse-grained samples. When the amount of ferrite in the ferritic-martensitic samples was increased, the corrosion potential became more negative. The ferrite formed a galvanic couple with the martensite and corroded preferentially due to its lower (more negative) corrosion potential. The corrosion current density was found to peak at a certain ferrite fraction. However, the <b>anodic</b> <b>dissolution</b> <b>rate</b> of the ferrite was found to decrease with increasing ferrite fractions, since the cathode-to-anode area ratio became less favourable for galvanic corrosion. The nucleation of ferrite also partitioned more alloying elements to the austenite, during annealing, due to the higher solubility of those elements in austenite. The alloying elements were found to sacrificially corrode for the iron, forming a protective layer of reaction products on the martensite surface. The corrosion potential for the martensite was found to increase with increasing amounts of alloying elements, while the current density decreased and the corrosion rate was retarded. These changing electrochemical properties of the martensite also influenced the corrosion properties of the ferritic-martensitic alloy on the macroscopic scale.

40|$|It {{is known}} that reduced sulfur {{compounds}} (such as thiocyanate and thiosulfate) can accelerate active corrosion of austenitic stainless steel in acid solutions, but before we started this project the mechanism of acceleration was largely unclear. This work combined electrochemical measurements and analysis using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS), which provided a comprehensive understanding of the catalytic effect of reduced sulfur species on the active corrosion of stainless steel. Both {{the behavior of the}} pure elements and the steel were studied and the work focused on the interaction between the pure elements of the steel, which is the least understood area. Upon completion of this work, several aspects are now much clearer. The main results from this work can be summarized as follows: The presence of low concentrations (around 0. 1 mM) of thiocyanate or tetrathionate in dilute sulfuric acid greatly accelerates the anodic dissolution of chromium and nickel, but has an even stronger effect on stainless steels (iron-chromium-nickel alloys). Electrochemical measurements and surface analyses are in agreement with the suggestion that accelerated dissolution really results from suppressed passivation. Even well below the passivation potential, the electrochemical signature of passivation is evident in the electrode impedance; the electrode impedance shows clearly that this pre-passivation is suppressed in the presence of thiocyanate. For the stainless steels, remarkable changes in the morphology of the corroded metal surface and in the surface concentration of chromium support the suggestion that pre-passivation of stainless steels is suppressed because dissolution of chromium is accelerated. Surface analysis confirmed that adsorbed sulfur / sulfide forms on the metal surfaces upon exposure to solutions containing thiocyanate or thiosulfate. For pure nickel, and steels containing nickel (and residual copper), bulk sulfide (visible as a black corrosion product) forms during anodic dissolution. The sulfide is electronically conductive, and gives an increase of several orders of magnitude in the electrode capacitance; the sulfide also causes anodic activation to persist after the pure metals and steels were removed from the thiocyanate-containing electrolyte and transferred to a thiocyanate-free electrolyte. The main practical implications of this work are that low concentrations of reduced sulfur compounds strongly affect anodic dissolution of stainless steels, and that selecting steels with elevated concentrations of chromium, nickel or molybdenum would serve to limit the <b>anodic</b> <b>dissolution</b> <b>rate</b> in the presence of reduced sulfur compounds...|$|E

Adsorbed sulfur, and reduced sulfur compounds in acid solution, have been shown to have strong effects on the active dissolution of several pure metals (Fe, Ni, Cr) and alloys. 1 – 5 “Reduced sulfur com-pounds ” here refer to dissolved sulfur-bearing anions, in which the oxidation state of sulfur is lower than in sulfate. Examples are sul...|$|R
40|$|Tin-based oxides are {{attractive}} catalyst support materials considered for application in fuel cells and electrolysers. If properly doped, these oxides are relatively good conductors, assuring that ohmic drop in real applications is minimal. Corrosion of dopants, however, {{will lead to}} severe performance deterioration. The present work aims to investigate the potential dependent <b>dissolution</b> <b>rates</b> of indium tin oxide (ITO), fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) and antimony doped tin oxide (ATO) in the broad potential window ranging from - 0. 6 to 3. 2 V-RHE in 0. 1 M H 2 SO 4 electrolyte. It is shown that in the cathodic part of the studied potential window all oxides dissolve during the electrochemical reduction of the oxide - cathodic dissolution. In case an oxidation potential {{is applied to the}} reduced electrode, metal oxidation is accompanied with additional <b>dissolution</b> - <b>anodic</b> <b>dissolution.</b> Additional dissolution is observed during the oxygen evolution reaction. FTO withstands anodic conditions best, while little and strong dissolution is observed for ATO and ITO, respectively. In discussion of possible corrosion mechanisms, obtained dissolution onset potentials are correlated with existing thermodynamic data...|$|R
40|$|Jet Electrochemical Machining (Jet-ECM) is an {{unconventional}} procedure for micromachining. Based on localized <b>anodic</b> <b>dissolution</b> three-dimensional geometries and microstructured surfaces can be manufactured using Jet-ECM. The main advantage {{compared to other}} electrochemical procedures is, that the jet restricts the electric current density to a limited area. An air assistance developed at Chemnitz UT and Fraunhofer IWU allows to apply small working gaps of about 100 ?m. Due to the high mean velocity in the jet of about 20 m/s the electrolyte supply is sufficient for using continuous direct current and higher <b>dissolution</b> <b>rates</b> compared to pulsed ECM are possible. In this study COMSOL Multiphysics is used to simulate the electric current density in the jet and the dissolution process in a time dependent model for Jet-ECM point processing, that means without a movement of the nozzle. Simulation and reality show a good coincidence...|$|R

While no surface structure change was observed at – 0. 6 V (vs Ag/AgCl) where no current flowed, dome structure on surface was removed, and flat surface was obtained after keeping the potential at 0 V (vs Ag/AgCl) where anodic current of ~ 150 µA cm– 2 flowed. An atomically resolved AFM image was obtained in the flat region and shows the surface is dominated by a (111) face after the <b>anodic</b> <b>dissolution...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Anodic</b> <b>dissolution</b> {{of nickel}} is a {{technique}} adopted for the electrolytic preparation of nickel salts. This electrochemical route is attractive from the points of view of product purity, ease of preparation and use of nickel scrap as the starting material. Studies on the <b>anodic</b> <b>dissolution</b> of nickel in sulphuric acid solution are reported with respect to current efficiency and anode potential. The effects of current density, concentration of sulphuric acid and temperature have also been examined. Addition of chloride ion inhibits anode passivation {{and its role in}} aiding the dissolution process has been discussed...|$|R
