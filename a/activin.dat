25|$|Long-lasting {{changes in}} the {{efficacy}} of synaptic connections (long-term potentiation, or LTP) between two neurons can involve the making and breaking of synaptic contacts. Genes such as <b>activin</b> ß-A, which encodes a subunit of <b>activin</b> A, are up-regulated during early stage LTP. The <b>activin</b> molecule modulates the actin dynamics in dendritic spines through the MAP-kinase pathway. By changing the F-actin cytoskeletal structure of dendritic spines, spines are lengthened and the chance that they make synaptic contacts with the axonal terminals of the presynaptic cell is increased. The end result is long-term maintenance of LTP.|$|E

40|$|<b>Activins</b> are proinflammatory cytokines which {{belong to}} the TGFβ superfamily. Follistatin is an {{extracellular}} decoy receptor for <b>activins.</b> Since both <b>activins</b> and follistatin are expressed in articular cartilage, we hypothesized that activin-follistatin signaling participates {{in the process of}} joint inflammation and cartilage degeneration. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of follistatin in a carrageenan-induced mouse arthritis model. Synovitis induced by intra-articular injection of carrageenan was significantly alleviated by preinjection with follistatin. Macrophage infiltration into the synovial membrane was significantly reduced in the presence of follistatin. In addition, follistatin inhibited proteoglycan erosion induced by carrageenan in articular cartilage. These data indicate that activin-follistatin signaling is involved in joint inflammation and cartilage homeostasis. Our data suggest that follistatin can be a new therapeutic target for inflammation-induced articular cartilage degeneration...|$|R

25|$|The TGF beta {{superfamily}} of ligands include: Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), Growth and differentiation factors (GDFs), Anti-müllerian hormone (AMH), <b>Activin,</b> Nodal and TGFβ's. Signaling {{begins with}} the binding of a TGF beta superfamily ligand to a TGF beta type II receptor. The type II receptor is a serine/threonine receptor kinase, which catalyzes the phosphorylation of the Type I receptor. Each class of ligand binds to a specific type II receptor. In mammals there are seven known type I receptors and five type II receptors.|$|E
25|$|Specific TGF-β ligands {{will result}} in the {{activation}} of either the SMAD2/3 or the SMAD1/5 R-SMADs. For instance, when <b>activin,</b> Nodal, or TGF-β ligand binds to the receptors, the phosphorylated receptor complex can activate SMAD2 and SMAD3 through phosphorylation. However, when a BMP ligand binds to the receptors, the phosphorylated receptor complex activates SMAD1 and SMAD5. Then, the Smad2/3 or the Smad1/5 complexes form a dimer complex with SMAD4 and become transcription factors. Though there are many R-SMADs involved in the pathway, there is only one co-SMAD, SMAD4.|$|E

40|$|<b>Activins</b> and inhibins, {{members of}} the type beta {{transforming}} growth factor superfamily of growth regulatory proteins, are produced in multiple tissues and affect diverse physiologic processes. Using embryonic stem cell technology, we previously demonstrated that inhibin can function as a gonadal tumor suppressor. In this study, we show that development of gonadal tumors is rapidly followed by a cancer cachexia-like wasting syndrome. Cachectic inhibin-deficient mice develop hepatocellular necrosis around the central vein and parietal cell depletion and mucosal atrophy in the glandular stomach, are anemic, and demonstrate severe weight loss. The liver pathology is consistent with studies demonstrating an effect of elevated <b>activins</b> on rat hepatocytes. In inhibin-deficient mice with tumors, <b>activins</b> are > 10 -fold elevated in the serum and are likely causing some of the cachexia symptoms. In contrast, inhibin-deficient mice gonadectomized {{at an early age}} do not develop this wasting syndrome. However, these gonadectomized, inhibin-deficient mice eventually develop adrenal cortical sex steroidogenic tumors with nearly 100 % penetrance, demonstrating that inhibin is also a tumor suppressor for the adrenal gland...|$|R

40|$|Pegylated-interferon-α based {{therapy for}} the {{treatment}} of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is considered suboptimal as not all patients respond to the treatment and it is associated with several side effects that could lead to dose reduction and/or termination of therapy. The currently used markers to monitor the response to treatment are based on viral kinetics and their performance in the prediction of treatment outcome is moderate and does not combine accuracy and their values have several limitations. Hence, the development of new sensitive and specific predictor markers could provide a useful tool for the clinicians and healthcare providers, especially in the new era of interferon-free therapy, for the classification of patients according to their response to the standard therapy and only subscribing the novel directly acting antiviral drugs to those who are anticipated not to respond to the conventional therapy and/or have absolute contraindications for its use.

To {{measure the}} effect of {{pegylated}} interferon-α therapy on serum activin-A, activin-B, and follistatin and their correlation with viral load and liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Methods. This study was cross-sectional and sera were collected from 165 participants classified into 7 groups: 40 healthy negative control, 33 treatment naïve patients as positive control, 19 patients at week 4, 22 at week 12, and 19 at week 24 of treatment initiation and 21 responders and 11 nonresponders {{at the end of}} 48 -week treatment protocol. Serum candidate proteins were measured using ELISA and liver fibrosis was assessed by AST platelet ratio index (APRI). Results. CHC significantly increased <b>activins</b> and decreased follistatin compared to negative control (P< 0. 05). Activin-A and follistatin levels returned to the levels of negative control group at weeks 4, 12, and 24 following treatment initiation and were significantly different from positive control (P< 0. 05). Both proteins were significantly different between responders and nonresponders. Activin-A correlated positively and significantly with the viral load and APRI. Conclusion.

40|$|Gene-targeted therapies, such as adeno-associated {{viral vector}} (AAV) -mediated gene therapy and cell-mediated therapy using myogenic stem cells, are hopeful {{molecular}} strategies for muscular dystrophy. In addition, drug therapies {{based on the}} pathophysiology of muscular dystrophy patients are desirable. Multidisciplinary approaches to drug design would offer promising therapeutic strategies. Myostatin, {{a member of the}} transforming growth factor-β superfamily, is predominantly produced by skeletal muscle and negatively regulates the growth and differentiation of cells of the skeletal muscle lineage. Myostatin inhibition would increase the skeletal muscle mass and prevent muscle degeneration, regardless of the type of muscular dystrophy. Myostatin inhibitors include myostatin antibodies, myostatin propeptide, follistatin and follistatin-related protein. Although follistatin possesses potent myostatin-inhibiting activity, it works as an efficient inhibitor of <b>activins.</b> Unlike myostatin, <b>activins</b> regulate the growth and differentiation of nearly all cell types, including cells of the gonads, pituitary gland and skeletal muscle. We have developed a myostatin-specific inhibitor derived from follistatin, designated FS I-I.
