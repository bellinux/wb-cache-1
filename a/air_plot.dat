At the time she was struck, Franklin had 31 armed and fueled aircraft warming up on her flight deck. The hangar deck contained planes, of which 16 were fueled and five were armed. [...] The forward gasoline system had been secured, but the aft system was operating. The explosion on the hangar deck ignited the fuel tanks on the aircraft, and gasoline vapor explosion devastated the deck. Only two crewmen survived the fire.

Franklin was dead in the water, without radio communications, and broiling in the heat from enveloping fires. On the bridge, Captain Gehres ordered Franklin's magazines flooded but this could not be carried out as the ship's water mains were destroyed by the explosions or fire. Admiral Ralph Davison transferred his flag to the destroyer USS Miller by breeches buoy and suggested abandoning ship, but Gehres refused to scuttle the Franklin as there were still many men alive below deck.|$|E

Meteorologists created the station model to fit a number of weather elements into a small space on weather maps. This allows map users to analyze patterns in atmospheric pressure, temperature, wind speed & direction, cloud cover, precipitation, and other parameters. The most common station plots depict surface weather observations although upper <b>air</b> <b>plots</b> at various mandatory levels are also frequently depicted.|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, it {{does make}} sense to use {{demonstration}} flights {{in the area of}} air traffic control in various air situations. The questions of computer <b>air</b> <b>plot</b> simulation are considered. For the simulation of processes and systems the technology of simulation modeling is used. It is a formal description of the functioning logic. In addition, there is computation of multifactor experiments. The picture of the aircraft is a conventional figure of the aircraft, the longitudinal axis position of which corresponds to its course. It can be on different or same routes. Changing of flight position appears according to the program using computer timer. For each aircraft, you enter its speed value. The controller can perform vectoring with the new course for changing the trajectory of the flight. The program has both automatic and manual modes. Mathematical modeling of flight, during the transition to a new course, does not relate to the characteristics of the specific type of aircraft. For example, there is the effectiveness of object-oriented program of air situation with one or more aircraft for training purposes. The aircraft forms on arbitrary sections of the route. The program determines for each aircraft the place of its initial installation and calculates the current distance to the next waypoint. The interval towards the waypoint determines the timeof automatic course changing to a value corresponding to the new route. Itâ€™s recommended to use Delphi programming system. The object-oriented programming system is effective for the task. It shows that the data display and appropriate software are sufficient funds for the visualization of the <b>air</b> <b>plot</b> at different stages of studying. </p...|$|E

50|$|In November 2009, the {{character}} of Loretta Jones became the centre of controversy when various media outlets revealed that Loretta {{would be part of}} a child murder storyline. The controversy began when tabloid newspaper The Sun compared the storyline to the real-life murder of James Bulger. Bulger had been murdered when he was two years old by two young children. Being just ten years of age, they were handed small sentences to serve and were later released with new identities. Bulger's mother, Denise Fergus, condemned the storyline and when interviewed by Click Liverpool, she criticised the decision to <b>air</b> a <b>plot</b> without consulting her first.

40|$|Until now, {{progress}} in laser ablation micromachining has been significantly limited {{with respect to}} feature miniaturisation and output yield by ablation generated debris. Gas jetting techniques have proven inadequate and vacuum environments are unwieldy in an industrial setting. To this end, a controlled geometry for both the optical interfaces of a flowing liquid film can be provided by a closed flowing thick film filtered water immersion technique. This ensures repeatable machining conditions and allows control of liquid flow velocity. To investigate {{the impact of this}} technique on etch rate, bisphenol A polycarbonate samples have been machined using KrF excimer laser radiation passing through a medium of filtered water flowing at a number of flow velocities that are controllable by modifying liquid flow rate. A mean increase in etch rate of 8. 5 % when using turbulent flow velocity regime immersed ablation over ablation in ambient air was recorded. However, use of laminar flow velocities resulted in a mean loss of 26. 6 % in etch rate compared to ablation in ambient <b>air.</b> <b>Plotting</b> the recorded etch rate achieved with respect to flow velocity gives support for previously proposed flow-plume interactions: the primary cause of a 37 % variance in etch rate over a 72 % change in laminar flow velocity was a shift in the ratio between the refresh rate of liquid volume over the feature and laser repetition rate. The small variance of etch rate achieved by modification of turbulent regime flow velocity indicates that laser etching provided the dominating contribution to the total etch rate measured. This work demonstrates that this technique developed for ablation debris control does not reduce the efficiency of laser etching with respect to that achieved with established gas media laser ablation machining. Therefore this process shows great promise with development for industrial implementation...|$|R
