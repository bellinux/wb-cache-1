500|$|Cooper {{described}} himself as [...] "a truly terrible public speaker" [...] and rarely made addresses from the Senate floor. He was known as an independent Republican during {{his career in the}} Senate. In the first roll-call vote of his career, he opposed transferring investigatory powers to Republican Owen Brewster's special War Investigating Committee. His second vote, directing that proceeds from the sale of war surplus materiel be used to pay off war debts, also went against the majority of the Republican caucus, prompting Ohio Republican Robert A. Taft to ask him [...] "Are you a Republican or a Democrat? When are you going to start voting with us?" [...] Cooper responded, [...] "If you'll pardon me, I was sent here to represent my constituents, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> vote as I think best." ...|$|E

[...] On August 20, 2011, while at a town hall discussing some of the displeasure that supporters of President Obama have had with the Congressional Black Caucus not supporting the president, Waters stated, [...] "This is a tough game.

[...] The exhibition opened in October with more than 600 photographs. Critics generally praised the beautiful aesthetic and technical qualities of the works. However, his critics found {{that the vast majority of}} the prints in the show were from the same photographers Stieglitz had known for years and whose works he had exhibited at 291. More than five hundred of the prints came from only thirty-seven photographers, including Steichen, Coburn, Seeley, White, F. Holland Day, and Stieglitz himself.|$|E

[...] In [...] "A Son of the Middle Border", Garland states, [...] "I {{grew up on a}} farm and I am determined once for all to put the essential ugliness of its life into print. … I am a competent witness <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> tell the whole truth". In a 1939 letter to Ph.D. student Eldon Hill, Garland expands, [...] "In truth I was an impressionist in that I presented life and landscape as I personally perceived them but I sought a deeper significance {{in the use of the}} word, I added a word which subtended verification".|$|E
2500|$|In March 2009 [...] "Do You Realize??" [...] was {{announced}} {{as the official}} rock song of Oklahoma. Ten choices were put to a public vote, and out of 21,000 votes cast nearly 51% were for [...] "Do You Realize??" [...] The Oklahoma Senate approved this choice unanimously. The Oklahoma House of Representatives failed to confirm the choice after Rep. Mike Reynolds, R-Oklahoma City attacked the band for its use of offensive language, and Rep. Corey Holland, R-Marlow {{said he had been}} [...] "really offended" [...] when Michael Ivins came to the announcement ceremony in March wearing a red T-shirt with a yellow hammer and sickle. However, that evening Oklahoma governor Brad Henry announced he would sign an executive order naming the song the official rock song. Henry said that for more than 20 years the Flaming Lips have produced [...] "creative, fun and provocative rock music." [...] "The music of the Flaming Lips has earned Grammys, glowing critical acclaim and fans all over the world", the governor said. [...] "A truly iconic rock n' roll band, they are proud ambassadors of their home state... They were clearly the people's choice, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> honor that vote." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 23 November 1806, {{he wrote}} to Jean Forestier, the father of his former fiancee, [...] "Yes, art {{will need to be}} reformed, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> be that revolutionary." [...] Characteristically, he found a studio {{on the grounds of the}} Villa Medici away from the other {{resident}} artists, and painted furiously. [...] Many drawings of monuments in Rome from this time are attributed to Ingres, but it appears from more recent scholarship that they were actually the work of his collaborators, particularly his friend the landscape artist François-Marius Granet. As required of every winner of the Prix, he sent works at regular intervals to Paris so his progress could be judged. Traditionally fellows sent paintings of male Greek or Roman heroes, but for his first samples Ingres sent Baigneuse à mi-corps (1807), a painting of the back of a young woman bathing, based on an engraving on an antique vase, [...] and [...] La Grande Bagneuse (1808), a larger painting of the back of a nude bather, and the first Ingres model to wear a turban, a detail he borrowed from the Fornarina by his favourite painter, Raphael. To satisfy the Academy in Paris, he also dispatched [...] Oedipus and the Sphinx to show his mastery of the male nude. The verdict of the academicians in Paris was that the figures were not sufficiently idealized. In later years Ingres painted several variants of these compositions; another nude begun in 1807, the Venus Anadyomene, remained in an unfinished state for decades, to be completed forty years later and finally exhibited in 1855.|$|E
2500|$|In a 14 February 2007 {{news conference}} U.S. President George W. Bush reiterated {{his claim that}} the Quds Force was causing unrest in Iraq, stating: [...] "I can say with {{certainty}} that the Quds force, {{a part of the}} Iranian government, has provided these sophisticated IEDs that have harmed our troops. And I'd like to repeat, I do not know whether or not the Quds Force was ordered from the top echelons of government. But my point is what's worse – them ordering it and it happening, or them not ordering it and it happening? And so we will continue to protect our troops. ... to say it [...] is provoking Iran is just a wrong way to characterize the Commander-in-Chief's decision to do what is necessary to protect our soldiers in harm's way. And I will continue to do so. ... Whether Ahmadinejad ordered the Quds force to do this, I don't think we know. But we do know that they're there, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>intend</b> <b>to</b> do something about it. And I've asked our commanders to do something about it. And we're going to protect our troops. ... I don't think we know who {{picked up the phone and}} said to the Quds Force, go do this, but we know it's a vital part of the Iranian government. …What matters is, is that we're responding. The idea that somehow we're manufacturing the idea that the Iranians are providing IEDs is preposterous. ... My job is to protect our troops. And when we find devices that are in that country that are hurting our troops, we're going to do something about it, pure and simple. ... does this mean you're trying to have a pretext for war? No. It means I'm trying to protect our troops." ...|$|E
