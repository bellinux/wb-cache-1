5|$|Bone Sharps, Cowboys, <b>and</b> <b>Thunder</b> Lizards: A Tale of Edward Drinker Cope, Othniel Charles Marsh, and the Gilded Age of Paleontology (2005) is {{a graphic}} novel written by Jim Ottaviani and {{illustrated}} by the company Big Time Attic. The book tells a slightly fictionalized account of the Bone Wars, a period of intense excavation, speculation, and rivalry {{which led to a}} greater understanding of dinosaurs in the western United States. This novel is the first semi-fictional work written by Ottaviani; previously, he had taken no creative license with the characters he depicted, portraying them strictly according to historical sources.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the train reached Eccles, the day's drizzle had been {{replaced}} by a storm. The doctors carried Huskisson, still on his door, off the train into a torrent of hail <b>and</b> <b>thunder</b> and walked the few hundred yards to the vicarage, frequently losing their footing as they climbed the deep cutting. Meanwhile, Stephenson and Wilton restarted the train and went on to Manchester to fetch medical assistance.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} Final Fight, Poison and Roxy both utilized standing and acrobatic flip kicks {{to attack the}} player. As one of the fighters in Final Fight Revenge, her moveset was expanded heavily, and she was armed with a whip. The whip is used primarily in her Cat Claw <b>and</b> <b>Thunder</b> Whip attacks (which are comparable to Shoryuken/Shinryūken styled attacks, respectively), {{and can be used}} to steal a weapon from the opponent. Additionally, her handcuffs can be thrown as a horizontal projectile move to immobilize the opponent for a short time.|$|E
5|$|Ore {{deposits}} of palladium and other PGMs are rare. The most extensive deposits {{have been found}} in the norite belt of the Bushveld Igneous Complex covering the Transvaal Basin in South Africa; the Stillwater Complex in Montana, United States; the Sudbury Basin <b>and</b> <b>Thunder</b> Bay District of Ontario, Canada; and the Norilsk Complex in Russia. Recycling is also a source, mostly from scrapped catalytic converters. The numerous applications and limited supply sources result in considerable investment interest.|$|E

5|$|There is a {{story about}} an aloviti man, who is {{described}} as unusually tall, thin, bony-faced, and with a long beard and moustache. When the weather was nice, he worked and behaved like the other people in his village, {{but as soon as the}} dark clouds covered the sky, he used to close himself in his house, put blinds on the windows, and remain alone and in a trance as long as the bad weather <b>and</b> <b>thunder</b> lasted. Historical persons believed to be aloviti men are Stefan Nemanja, and Stefan Dečanski.|$|E
5|$|Features on Io {{are named}} after {{characters}} and places from the Io myth, {{as well as}} deities of fire, volcanoes, the Sun, <b>and</b> <b>thunder</b> from various myths, and characters and places from Dante's Inferno: names appropriate to the volcanic nature of the surface. Since the surface was first seen up close by Voyager 1, the International Astronomical Union has approved 225 names for Io's volcanoes, mountains, plateaus, and large albedo features. The approved feature categories used for Io for different types of volcanic features include patera ("saucer"; volcanic depression), fluctus ("flow"; lava flow), vallis ("valley"; lava channel), and active eruptive center (location where plume activity was {{the first sign of}} volcanic activity at a particular volcano). Named mountains, plateaus, layered terrain, and shield volcanoes include the terms mons, mensa ("table"), planum, and tholus ("rotunda"), respectively. Named, bright albedo regions use the term regio. Examples of named features are Prometheus, Pan Mensa, Tvashtar Paterae, and Tsũi Goab Fluctus.|$|E
5|$|One Canadian auto {{trail was}} routed through the UP as well. In 1920, the King's International Highway linked Vancouver, British Columbia, to Halifax, Nova Scotia, {{but there was}} no highway to carry it around the north side of Lake Superior. Motorists had to ship their cars by boat between Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, <b>and</b> <b>Thunder</b> Bay or enter the United States to {{continue}} along the auto trail. The routings varied on the maps of the time, but its basic route used US2 through the UP from Ironwood to Sault Ste. Marie until a highway north of Lake Superior was opened in 1960; by that time, the auto trail had taken on the Trans-Canada Highway name.|$|E

5|$|Several {{lines of}} {{evidence}} point to ongoing volcanic activity on Venus. During the Soviet Venera program, the Venera 9 orbiter obtained spectroscopic evidence of lightning on Venus, and the Venera 12 descent probe obtained additional evidence of lightning <b>and</b> <b>thunder.</b> The European Space Agency's Venus Express in 2007 detected whistler waves further confirming {{the occurrence of}} lightning on Venus. One possibility is that ash from a volcanic eruption was generating the lightning. Another piece of evidence comes from measurements of sulfur dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, which dropped {{by a factor of}} 10 between 1978 and 1986, jumped in 2006, and again declined 10-fold. This may mean that levels had been boosted several times by large volcanic eruptions.|$|E
5|$|The Fire Emblem series' Weapon Triangle {{mechanic}} {{is featured}} again, {{in which the}} three main close-combat weapons are strong or weak against each other: axes are strong against lances, lances are strong against swords, and swords are strong against axes. Other similar mechanics exist, such as fire magic being more damaging to some beasts, and arrows being more effective against airborne enemies. Weapon durability decreases over time, with weapons eventually breaking when used {{a certain number of}} times. Weapons have different levels of strength, with its assigned letter (E to A and S) denoting the level of skill required to wield it. Weapons forged at Base can also be customized with a unique name. Magic is governed by a similar system to the Weapons Triangle; fire is weak to wind, wind is weak to thunder, <b>and</b> <b>thunder</b> is weak to fire.|$|E
5|$|A cold front, {{the leading}} edge of a cooler mass of air, can produce frontal snowsqualls—an intense frontal {{convective}} line (similar to a rainband), when temperature is near freezing at the surface. The strong convection that develops has enough moisture to produce whiteout conditions at places which line passes over as the wind causes intense blowing snow. This type of snowsquall generally lasts less than 30 minutes at any point along its path but the motion of the line can cover large distances. Frontal squalls may form a short distance ahead of the surface cold front or behind the cold front where there may be a deepening low pressure system or a series of trough lines which act similar to a traditional cold frontal passage. In situations where squalls develop post-frontally it is not unusual to have two or three linear squall bands pass in rapid succession only separated by 25 miles (40 kilometers) with each passing the same point in roughly 30 minutes apart. In cases where there is a large amount of vertical growth and mixing the squall may develop embedded cumulonimbus clouds resulting in lightning <b>and</b> <b>thunder</b> which is dubbed thundersnow.|$|E

5|$|A {{key element}} in combat since Genealogy of the Holy War is the Weapon Triangle, a system {{governing}} {{the strengths and weaknesses}} certain weapons and types of magic have against each other in a Scissors, Paper, Rock fashion. For weapons, lances are stronger than swords, swords are stronger than axes, and axes are stronger than lances. In magic, fire is stronger than wind, wind is stronger than thunder, <b>and</b> <b>thunder</b> is stronger than fire. For Fates, the Weapon Triangle relationships add other weapons in the following way: swords and tomes are stronger than axes and bows, axes and bows were stronger than lances and shuriken, lances and shuriken are stronger than swords and tomes, and so on. Several games use a Weapon Durability system: after being used a certain number of times, a character's weapon will break. Different entries have various systems related to character weapons: in Genealogy of the Holy War, weapons can be repaired at special shops; in Path of Radiance and future games, weapons can be bought and upgraded, while the durability system is replaced in Fates with a system where more powerful weapons weaken some of a wielder's stats.|$|E
5|$|Liu Kang was {{the hero}} of the comic book {{adaptation}} of the Mortal Kombat series Malibu Comics. In the first miniseries, Blood <b>and</b> <b>Thunder,</b> his backstory was mostly kept intact as a Shaolin monk out to restore the tournament to their righteous owners, with the only difference being that he was not the chosen one to defeat Goro, which instead fell on twin monk brothers named Sing and Sang, two original characters created specifically for the comics; after they are killed by Goro in the third issue, Liu Kang becomes the Shaolin's only hope in defeating Shang Tsung. The following miniseries, Battlewave, stated that Liu Kang won the first tournament after defeating Goro, which never appeared in the first miniseries. He returns to his normal life as an architect in Chicago, having left the Order of Light before the events of the first series. However, he suffers from constant attacks by an unknown force of ninjas and later receives help from Johnny Cage's bodyguard Bo when Goro ambushes him in an office building. Eventually he decides to travel to Outworld, realizing that he cannot avoid Mortal Kombat.|$|E
