40|$|Based on the {{analysis}} {{results from the}} patent search and review of domestic and foreign publications in variable cycle engines (VCE) was created a classification of the possible schematic diagrams of VCE realizing three-stream engine technologies (the adaptive low pressure compressor (LPC) with <b>air</b> <b>extraction</b> behind stages, FLADE compressor, various feeding types of <b>extraction</b> <b>air</b> to the flowing path of the engine, etc.). To estimate a three-stream engine application {{as a part of}} the power-plant (PP) efficiency, was chosen an adaptive LPC technology scheme with the third contour air bypass beyond the critical section of a basic jet nozzle for which a mathematical model (MM) of the PP has been created on the basis of one-dimensional MM of the engine. The MM of the PP included 3 D modeling results of the air inlet, the LPC with various <b>air</b> <b>extractions</b> to the third contour, and the jet nozzle taking into account the interaction between the basic stream and the third contour stream. The predicted performance of an air inlet have been used to estimate the changes in a total pressure restoration coefficient and an additional resistance coefficient along «a fluid contour» when <b>air</b> <b>extraction</b> is included in the third contour in several cruiser modes of flight. An integrated characteristic of the LPC has been received at various points and levels of <b>air</b> <b>extraction</b> to the third contour, and parameters of extracted air (depending on the point and amount of <b>air</b> <b>extraction,</b> and also on the fan operating mode) have been calculated. When analyzing the obtained calculation results, the effect of pressure lines displacement to the right (towards the large reduced rates), growth of efficiency values, and also position displacement of its maximum value to the left (towards the descent reduced rates) has been found. To estimate how <b>air</b> <b>extraction</b> of the third contour between the plates of an adjustable supersonic nozzle impacts on its aft deck resistance various parameters of the flowing out air in subsonic cruiser mode of flight have been calculated. As a result of calculations according to the PP MM, under near-the-earth conditions of the subsonic cruiser flight, the effective specific fuel consumption has been reduced by 12, 5 %. The results reached allow us to expect significant subsonic effective fuel conservation of the three-stream engine. To prove the calculated results it is further necessary to achieve them under full-scale conditions using the engine-demonstrator. </p...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{variability}} in yield oxidative status and appearance of palm oils as affected by fruit type and <b>extraction</b> <b>equipment</b> in the small scale industry. A 23 factorial experimental design with palm fruit types Dura and Tenera and <b>extraction</b> <b>equipment</b> digester screw hand spindle and hydraulic presses were studied. Quality indices of oils i. e. free fatty acid ffa peroxide value moisture content impurities colour and yield were accessed using standard methods. The ffa values obtained for oils produced from both Dura and Tenera fruit types and the <b>extraction</b> <b>equipment</b> ranged 5. 25 - 5. 71 were above the CODEX standard of 5. 0. Furthermore significant differences were also recorded in both moisture contents and impurities from the same oils produced. The oil yield from Tenera fruit types were two folds higher than the Dura fruit types. The redness colour of palm oils for Dura fruit types was a little above the Tenera fruit types. However the yellowness and lightness of colour of palm oils for Tenera were higher than oils from Dura fruit types. Therefore the study concludes that the oil processors in the small scale industry preferred the digester screw press machine because it gave low level of impurities and moisture content than other presses. Tenera fruit type is {{the best choice for}} palm oil processing because of its higher oil yield content. However in terms of oil colour Dura fruit type is preferred...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} the industrial problem of air current segregation in alumina storage silos which occurs with {{the handling of}} the feedstock alumina in aluminium plants. One significant parameter, the <b>air</b> <b>extraction</b> rate, was studied in an experimental silo which was manufactured for this purpose. The experiments conducted in small scale devices displayed the interaction between the particle flow and air current segregation. Results from these experiments show that the increase of the silo <b>air</b> <b>extraction</b> rate reduces <b>air</b> current segregation. The dimensional analysis method has been applied to form dimensionless groups out of the significant parameters. Five dimensionless groups were obtained which is unwieldy. To reduce the number of dimensionless groups the physical properties were lumped into the terminal velocity. This simplified approach gives three dimensionless groups. Initial experiments justify further research to establish weather the simplified approach can scale the dynamic of the flow and the degree of segregation from a small scale silo to industrial equipment...|$|R
