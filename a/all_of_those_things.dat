And then, also that these veils, they are really just protecting me from the thing that I held the most sacred, which is my creativity ... My Aura is the way that I deal with my insanity and I feel quite insane, so this song sounds very insane ... Everyone thinks that everything I do is a statement but some times I'm just moved by something passionate and I want to express it.|$|E

[...] Essentially saying that his (relatively) slow times in the 100 and 200 meters were the result of too short a period to train and prepare, Thorpe announced he will continue training, setting as his (new) goal qualifying for the World Championships in 2013.|$|E

500|$|S by Shakira Aquamarine was {{launched}} as a limited edition fragrance in early 2013.

The perfume bottle and the packaging follow a largely similar design to the original one but feature a [...] "metallic combination" [...] of gold and turquoise. The top notes include bergamot, mandarin orange, passion fruit chord and various ozonic substances; the heart notes capture the scents of different flowers like jasmine, plumeria, and tiaré; the base notes also consist of ozonic substances, as well as cedar wood.

500|$|Other songs {{allude to}} darker themes {{of fear and}} {{personal}} insecurities. Beyoncé noted that the album displayed [...] "sides of [...] {{that only a few}} people had seen", adding that [...] "all of us want happiness... sometimes {{you have to take the}} insecurities to get to the secure place. And <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> I feel happy to express". Caitlin White of The 405 believed the songs as [...] "hold forth on the most important issues in a woman's life by delving into [...] personal experience with them". [...] "Jealous" [...] addresses fidelity and features lyrics in which the protagonist experiences [...] "promises, suspicion and potential revenge". It contains an [...] "uncanny mix of tones and styles", most prominently a morose bassline replete with electronic yelps. [...] "Mine", a futuristic R song with jazz elements, is self-reflective, with lyrics that reference marital strife and difficulties with postnatal depression. The neo soul song [...] "Pretty Hurts" [...] is a self-empowerment anthem that decries society's obsession with harmful and unattainable standards of beauty. The song uses audio snippets of beauty pageants which Beyoncé contested in to frame the song in the context of her childhood.|$|E
500|$|... "Get Me Bodied" [...] {{was one of}} {{the music}} videos shot during the two-week filming for B'Day Anthology Video Album. It was {{conceptualized}} by Beyoncé and co-directed by Anthony Mandler. The version of the song used in the clip is the extended mix, which is featured on the deluxe edition of B'Day. The video was shot over two days and choreographed by Rhapsody, Todd Sams, Clifford McGhee and Bethany Strong. For the shoot, Beyoncé asked former Destiny's Child band-mates Kelly Rowland, Michelle Williams, and sister Solange to appear with her in the video. She said that it [...] "sets the tone of the video". Beyoncé's mother and stylist, Tina created over 60 outfits for Beyoncé and the 50 extras featured in the video. The instructional dance-oriented video was inspired by the 1960s choreographies. Beyoncé cited influences from the Broadway director-choreographer Bob Fosse, Southern and Jamaican movement and the Frug from the musical Sweet Charity; Erika Ramirez of Billboard magazine further noted that the video was inspired by the scene [...] "Rich Man's Frug" [...] from the movie. She said: [...] "It tells you how to do all the dances — it's modern, it's retro, it's vintage, it's stylized, it's <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> put together." [...] The story moves from a tony party reminiscent of the jet set style of the sixties, followed with dance sequences. The video was released to US iTunes Store as a Video Triple on September 4, 2007. A re-edit of the video was produced for the Timbaland remix featuring Voltio. Although Voltio does not actually appear in the video, unused footages of the original video were replaced during the parts he sings. The re-edited video was posted on the MTV Overdrive on July 26, 2007. It was included on the DVD for Irreemplazable (2007).|$|E

2500|$|Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said of Cornell: [...] "I’ve {{always said}} that Chris was the {{greatest}} songwriter to ever come out of Seattle. Jimi Hendrix could play the guitar like crazy, but Chris had the song-writing chops that we all sort of hoped to get to {{at different points in}} our songwriting careers. He had a way he could wrap a melody around odd time signatures and weird parts and make them catchy. He was a beautiful wordsmith. If you look at his lyrics, he obviously was processing his pain and depression, and <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things.</b> I think that’s part of what people, myself included, responded to when he was singing. With the songwriting he had that voice, there’s not too many people that have that many options with their voice.

I feel so lucky that I got to be in a project with him, got to hang out with him, and just sort of witness his greatness." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to the Romance Writers of America, {{the main}} plot of a romance novel must revolve {{about the two}} people as they develop romantic {{love for each other}} and work to build a relationship. Both the {{conflict}} and the climax of the novel should be directly related to that core theme of developing a romantic relationship, although the novel can also contain subplots that do not specifically relate to the main characters' romantic love. Furthermore, a romance novel must have an [...] "emotionally satisfying and optimistic ending." [...] Others, including Leslie Gelbman, a president of Berkley Books, define the genre more simply, stating only that a romance must make the [...] "romantic relationship between the hero and the heroine ... the core of the book." [...] In general, romance novels reward characters who are good people and penalize those who are evil, and a couple who fights for and believes in their relationship will likely be rewarded with unconditional love. Bestselling author Nora Roberts sums up the genre, saying: [...] "The books are about the celebration of falling in love and emotion and commitment, and <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> we really want." [...] Women's fiction (including [...] "chick lit") is not directly a subcategory of the romance novel genre, because in women's fiction the heroine's relationship with her family or friends may be as important as her relationship with the hero.|$|E
2500|$|On December 16, 2013, Newsted {{expanded}} upon previous statements {{regarding his}} departure from Metallica and cited that his project with Echobrain was being discouraged by James Hetfield because Metallica's management at Q Prime {{wanted to go}} ahead with promoting Echobrain but was forced to drop it by Hetfield's demands with the quote [...] "other arrangements can be made". Jason was sure that Echobrain would not affect Metallica as it was the pedigree that it already needed. Newsted continues, “And so they had told me, pretty convincingly, ‘This is a great record, we’ve been playing it around the office, that’s all I’ve been hearing, it’s fantastic, this kid has a great voice. Let’s do something with this.’ That’s what they told me, and then James Hetfield heard about it and was not happy. He was, I think, pretty much out to put the kibosh on the whole thing because it would somehow affect Metallica in his eyes, because now the managers were interested in something I was doing {{that had nothing to do}} with him. ”The bassist sums up the situation as follows: “I have no idea what [...] was thinking, other than just protecting what he valued, just like he does; that's his thing. He protects what he loves, squeezes it too hard, like he said himself. Squeeze it too hard, protecting it too much. That's where I was coming from. The people that I had counted on for 15 years to help me with my career, help Metallica, take care of my money, do <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things,</b> told me, 'Your new project is fantastic, we'd like to help you with it.'

2500|$|... "Black Cat" [...] has {{influenced}} {{the production of}} numerous songs and inspired various artists to foray into the rock genre. Record producer RedOne was inspired by [...] "Black Cat" [...] for several songs on Nicole Scherzinger's debut album, Killer Love. Jessica Simpson considers the song an influence, saying [...] "Janet's music rocks," [...] citing [...] "Black Cat" [...] and [...] "Rhythm Nation" [...] specifically, adding [...] "Janet affects my music." [...] Fefe Dobson said the song was a primary influence for her third album Joy, saying [...] "I heard Janet’s ‘Black Cat,’ with its rock guitar riff. That’s what this album reflects." [...] Dobson explained, “Black Cat” incorporated a bunch {{of different types of}} music into one song. It was pop. It was punk. It was rock and roll. And I am <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things.</b> I think it hit me as a kid really hard, because I love to experience a fusion of musical genres." [...] Mexican singer Selena cited Jackson among her main influences; with Chris Pérez stating, [...] "Selena especially loved Jackson's song [...] "Black Cat" ... I can't even count how many times Selena and I listened to that single." [...] Solange Knowles also called the song an influence, saying, [...] "I remember I had a solo dance for a song of hers called 'Black Cat', and that was the start of my Janet love affair," [...] wearing a black unitard and cat ears. [...] Rihanna's single [...] "Rockstar 101" [...] was considered reminiscent of Jackson's pursuit, and she also worked with Nuno Bettencourt, the guitarist on the single edit of [...] "Black Cat," [...] during the song's live performances. Alanis Morissette's transition from dance-pop into alternative rock with Jagged Little Pill was partially inspired by the song, with author Paul Cantin writing, [...] "She may have been a fan of dance music, but when the band covered Janet Jackson's rock-flavoured song [...] "Black Cat," [...] her bandmates could see how eager she was to let go." [...] Singer-songwriter BJ the Chicago Kid cited Jackson's performance on the Rhythm Nation World Tour as an inspiration to enter the music industry, saying [...] "I remember seeing the Black Cat tour with Janet Jackson as a kid. They were wheeling a cage out on stage and there’s a black panther in there! I’m like a kid in the photographers pit like, ‘Woah.' She’s beautiful and I’m seeing a real live fucking cat..

This realization, that she loved him, as it persisted, began to make him uneasy, though it should, according to all experience, have been a reason for sheer exultation.

When he reached Abchurch Lane, the news of Melmotte's death had already been spread abroad; and more was known or said to be known, of his {{circumstances}} than Nidderdale had as yet heard. The crushing blow to him, so said Herr Croll, had been the desertion of Cohenlupe,--that and the sudden fall {{in the value of}} the South Central Pacific and Mexican Railway shares, consequent on the rumours spread about the City respecting the Pickering property. It was asserted in Abchurch Lane that had he not at that moment touched the Pickering property, or entertained the Emperor, or stood for Westminster, he must, by the end of the autumn, have been able to do any or <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>things</b> without danger, simply as the result of the money which would then have been realized by the railway. But he had allowed himself to become hampered by the want of comparatively small sums of ready money, and in seeking relief had rushed from one danger to another, till at last the waters around him had become too deep even for him, and had overwhelmed him. As to his immediate death, Herr Croll expressed not the slightest astonishment. It was just the thing, Herr Croll said, that he had been sure that Melmotte would do, should his difficulties ever become too great for him. 'And dere vas a leetle ting he lay himself open by de oder day,' said Croll, 'dat vas nasty,-- very nasty.' Nidderdale shook his head, but asked no questions. Croll had alluded to the use of his own name, but did not on this occasion make any further revelation. Then Croll made a further statement to Lord Nidderdale, which I think he must have done in pure good-nature. 'Mylor,' he said, whispering very gravely, 'de money of de yong lady is all her own.' Then he nodded his head three times. 'Nobody can toch it, not if he vas in debt millions.' Again he nodded his head.|$|E
