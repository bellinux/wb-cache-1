40|$|During FY 10 - 11, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in {{collaboration}} with the EnergyPlus development team implemented the following high priority enhancements to support the simulation of high performance buildings: (1) Improve <b>Autosizing</b> of Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Components; (2) Life-Cycle Costing to Evaluate Energy Efficiency Upgrades; (3) Develop New Model to Capture Transformer Losses; (4) Enhance the Model for Electric Battery Storage; and (5) Develop New Model for Chiller-Tower Optimization. This report summarizes the technical background, new feature development and implementation details, and testing and validation process for these enhancements. The <b>autosizing,</b> life-cycle costing and transformer model enhancements/developments were included in EnergyPlus release Version 6. 0, and the electric battery model development will be included in Version 7. 0. The model development of chiller-tower optimization will be included in a later version (after Version 7. 0) ...|$|E
40|$|This work {{explored}} {{the utility of}} EnergyPlus as a simulation engine for doing residential building energy optimization, {{with the objective of}} finding the modeling areas that require further development in EnergyPlus for residential optimization applications. This work was conducted primarily during 2006 - 2007, with publication occurring later in 2010. The assessments and recommendations apply to the simulation tool versions available in 2007. During this work, an EnergyPlus v 2. 0 (2007) input file generator was developed for use in BEopt 0. 8. 0. 4 (2007). BEopt 0. 8. 0. 4 is a residential Building Energy optimization program developed at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colorado. Residential modeling capabilities of EnergyPlus v 2. 0 were scrutinized and tested. Modeling deficiencies were identified in a number of areas. These deficiencies were compared to deficiencies in the DOE 2. 2 V 44 E 4 (2007) /TRNSYS simulation engines. The highest priority gaps in EnergyPlus v 2. 02 Ì† 7 s residential modeling capability are in infiltration, duct leakage, and foundation modeling. Optimization results from DOE 2. 2 V 44 E 4 and EnergyPlus v 2. 0 were analyzed to search for modeling differences that {{have a significant impact on}} optimization results. Optimal buildings at different energy savings levels were compared to look for biases. It was discovered that the EnergyPlus v 2. 0 optimizations consistently chose higher wall insulation levels than the DOE 2. 2 V 44 E 4 optimizations. The points composing the optimal paths chosen by DOE 2. 2 V 44 E 4 and EnergyPlus v 2. 0 were compared to look for points chosen by one optimization that were significantly different from the other optimal path. These outliers were compared to consensus optimal points to determine the simulation differences that cause disparities in the optimization results. The differences were primarily caused by modeling of window radiation exchange and HVAC <b>autosizing...</b>|$|E
