25|$|We {{came down}} here to offer {{evidence}} in this case and the court has held under the law that the evidence we had is not admissible, so <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to take an exception and carry it to a higher court to see whether the evidence is admissible or not...we cannot even explain to you that we think you should return a verdict of not guilty. We do not see how you could. We do not ask it.|$|E
500|$|In the 2015 film The Martian, the NASA JPL {{engineer}} Tim Grimes {{refers to}} the Algonquin Round Table when describing the crude communication JPL had established with stranded astronaut Mark Whatney: [...] "Thirty-two minute round trip communications time, all {{he can do is}} ask yes/no questions, and <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> point the camera. This won't exactly be an Algonquin Round Table of snappy repartee." ...|$|E
500|$|On 27 July, three students, {{as part of}} a {{group called}} Local Action started a hunger strike at the pier. Hunger striker Chan King-fai said: [...] "The {{government}} wasn't chosen by us. <b>All</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to use our humble and limited voices." [...] The government responded with a communications offensive, announcing that Secretary for Development Carrie Lam would appear on RTHK's City's Forum and at a public forum on 29 July at the pier.|$|E

500|$|Neither {{the police}} nor the fire {{department}} officially supported the project. The Uniformed Firefighters Association initially supported it, but withdrew when the connection to the Church of Scientology was revealed. Firefighter Union President Patrick Bahnken said his members' lives had benefited from the program, {{and that it had}} involved no religious rhetoric. Deputy Fire Commissioner Frank Gribbon of the FDNY told The New York Times, [...] "while we are aware some members of the department have availed themselves of the program, we in no way endorse it." [...] Officials at the department raised concerns that firefighters were giving up existing medications in order to take part. The department's deputy chief medical officer Dr. David Prezant said, [...] "It's not our job to say you can't go. <b>All</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> say there's no proven evidence it works." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{case was}} then {{referred}} to the Criminal Cases Review Commission, which was informed on 26February 2009 by the Special Crime Division of the CPS that the Crown would not oppose the appeal. The case {{then went to the}} Court of Appeal, where, in light of the new DNA evidence available, Hodgson's conviction was quashed. The judgement, which was delivered by Lord Judge, the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, on 18March 2009 concluded: [...] "The decision leaves some important, unanswered questions. Perhaps the most important is that we do not know who raped and killed the dead girl. We can but hope {{for the sake of the}} appellant and the family of the murdered girl that her killer may yet be identified and brought to justice. But for now <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to quash the conviction. It is accordingly quashed. The appellant will be discharged. There will be no new trial." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the release}} of the new album approached, the band and its {{management}} found {{that they would have to}} navigate changes in the music industry, which Hurley described as [...] "a completely different place." [...] Facing declining record sales, the lack of a proper outlet for exhibition of music videos, and the economic crisis, Hurley commented that [...] "people are buying things they need to survive rather than records and concert tickets." [...] The group's 2007 album Infinity on High sold one million copies, which was considered a disappointment compared to From Under the Cork Trees sales of three million. Trohman attributed this to [...] "the same reason that nobody's records are selling that well: there's so much turmoil in the music industry, so much downsizing, and people are finding different ways to get their music more and more all the time. There's very little we can do about that as a band. <b>All</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> try to make great music and hope it connects with people." ...|$|E

500|$|Wallace {{wrote on}} other social and {{political}} topics including his support for women's suffrage, and repeatedly on the dangers and wastefulness of militarism. In an essay published in 1899 Wallace called for popular opinion to be rallied against warfare by showing people: [...] "...that all modern wars are dynastic; that they are caused by the ambition, the interests, the jealousies, and the insatiable greed of power of their rulers, or of the great mercantile and financial classes which have power and influence over their rulers; and {{that the results of}} war are never good for the people, who yet bear all its burthens". In a letter published by the Daily Mail in 1909, with aviation in its infancy, he advocated an international treaty to ban the military use of aircraft, arguing against the idea [...] "...that this new horror is [...] "inevitable," [...] and that <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to be sure and be in the front rank of the aerial assassins—for surely no other term can so fitly describe the dropping of, say, ten thousand bombs at midnight into an enemy's capital from an invisible flight of airships." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Massachusetts {{legislature}} took up {{the repeal}} of the 1913 law the next month. On July 15, the Massachusetts Senate voted to repeal it on a unanimous voice vote. The House approved the legislation on July 29 on a 118 to 35 vote and Governor Deval Patrick signed it on July 31. It took effect immediately. He said: [...] "I think other states will make their own judgments, and I expect them to–that's their own business. <b>All</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> tend our own garden, and make sure that it's weeded, and I think we've weeded out a discriminatory law that we should have." ...|$|E
2500|$|When the Holiday Bowl chose ASU, the Sun Devils head Coach Dennis Erickson said, [...] "We're {{excited about}} going to the Holiday Bowl. [...] We get to play Texas. That's a great program, a {{historic}} program, and great opportunity for us. As I said last night after the game, we have no control over the BCS; <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> go out there and play football. Which we {{did a good job of}} 10 times. That's something that they have to deal with and they dealt with it and they did the best they can do with they system. This is just how it is. Our players are really excited about going where we're going." [...] Vice President for ASU Athletics Lisa Love said. [...] "Playing a perennial power like the University of Texas, December 27 in the Holiday Bowl, which, by the way, is wonderfully hosted by that committee. This is a great, step forward. This is exactly what we wanted to do. We are very pleased to be mentioned in the same breath as a program like Texas." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, <b>all</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> {{to keep on}} {{and watch}} out," [...] said Tom, with a sigh. His disposition, for fun seemed to have entirely left him.|$|E
