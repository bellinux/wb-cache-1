In this paper we review the literature comparing <b>artificial</b> <b>neural</b> <b>networks</b> and statistical models, particularly in regression-based forecasting, time series forecasting, and decision making.

Usage of <b>artificial</b> <b>neural</b> <b>networks</b> includes finding of various suitable types, topologies and learning algorithms of <b>artificial</b> <b>neural</b> <b>networks</b> to solve prediction of real-world data sets. Optimization solutions {{in the context of}} work focused on <b>neural</b> <b>networks</b> used in topology optimization learning algorithms and <b>neural</b> <b>networks</b> own calculation. The first part is a summary of current trends in applications development and the utilization of <b>artificial</b> <b>neural</b> <b>networks.</b> The review of the literature is the selection of the most common models of <b>artificial</b> <b>neural</b> <b>networks</b> for prediction of real data needs. Subsequently, the implementation of the defined application of <b>artificial</b> <b>neural</b> <b>networks</b> in support of decision-making process is made. On the basis of determining the value of the decision making process are defined methods for prediction of real data using classical methods. As classical methods are considered methods of statistical prediction models for time series. After that, the methods of <b>artificial</b> <b>neural</b> <b>networks</b> and their application on prediction task are described. In the next part, experiments involving the choice of type, topology, learning algorithms and optimization possibilities of <b>artificial</b> <b>neural</b> <b>networks</b> is tested on real-world data sets. The implementation presents the prediction of selected real-world economic values; namely a set of household expenditures and goods transport is used.

25|$|An (<b>artificial)</b> <b>neural</b> <b>network</b> is {{a network}} of simple {{elements}} called neurons, which receive input, change their internal state (i.e. the activation) according to that input and an activation function, and produce output depending on the input and the activation. The network forms by connecting the output of certain neurons to the input of other neurons forming a directed and weighted graph, where the neurons are the nodes and {{the connection between the}} neurons are weighted directed edges. The weights and the activation functions can be modified by a process called learning, which is governed by a learning rule.|$|E
25|$|The Blue Brain Project is {{an attempt}} to create a {{synthetic}} brain by reverse-engineering the mammalian brain down to the molecular level. The aim of this project, founded in May 2005 by the Brain and Mind Institute of the École Polytechnique in Lausanne, Switzerland, is to study the brain's architectural and functional principles. The project is headed by the Institute's director, Henry Markram. Using a Blue Gene supercomputer running Michael Hines's NEURON software, the simulation does not consist simply of an <b>artificial</b> <b>neural</b> <b>network,</b> but involves a partially biologically realistic model of neurons. It is hoped by its proponents that it will eventually shed light on the nature of consciousness.|$|E

TAP is a transmembrane protein responsible for the transport of antigenic peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum, where MHC them class I molecules can bind them and presented to T cells. As TAP does not bind all peptides equally, TAP-binding affinity could influence {{the ability of a}} particular peptide {{to gain access to the}} MHC class I pathway. <b>Artificial</b> <b>neural</b> <b>network</b> (ANN), a computer model was used to study peptide binding to human TAP and its relationship with MHC class I binding. The affinity of HLA-binding peptides for TAP was found to differ according to the HLA supertype concerned using this method. This research could have important implications for the design of peptide based immuno-therapeutic drugs and vaccines. It shows the power of the modeling approach to understand complex immune interactions.|$|E

25|$|Continuous network {{models of}} GRNs are an {{extension}} of the boolean networks described above. Nodes still represent genes and connections between them regulatory influences on gene expression. Genes in biological systems display a continuous range of activity levels and {{it has been argued that}} using a continuous representation captures several properties of gene regulatory networks not present in the Boolean model. Formally most of these approaches are similar to an <b>artificial</b> <b>neural</b> <b>network,</b> as inputs to a node are summed up and the result serves as input to a sigmoid function, e.g., but proteins do often control gene expression in a synergistic, i.e. non-linear, way. However, there is now a continuous network model that allows grouping of inputs to a node thus realizing another level of regulation. This model is formally closer to a higher order recurrent neural network. The same model has also been used to mimic the evolution of cellular differentiation and even multicellular morphogenesis.|$|E
