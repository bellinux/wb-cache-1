5|$|Most of {{the people}} who live around Lake Toba are ethnically Bataks. Traditional Batak houses are noted for their {{distinctive}} roofs (which curve upwards <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end,</b> as a boat's hull does) and their colorful decor.|$|E
5|$|The 1927 bogie goods vans were {{originally}} fitted with heavy diagonal wooden cross braces <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end,</b> {{but these were}} later replaced with single diagonal angle-iron braces.|$|E
5|$|The spores {{are seen}} ochre-brown in mass, but pale yellow when viewed {{with a light}} microscope. They are {{fusiform}} (tapered <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end),</b> sized 8–10.5 by 3–4.5μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells of the hymenium) are four-spored.|$|E

25|$|The Jelapang and Ipoh South toll plazas were {{demolished}} in 2009 {{to make a}} non-stop route across Ipoh. This {{is achieved}} {{through the construction of}} two local-express lanes for each side, which are only accessible via Exit 138 Ipoh South Exit (for northbound traffic) and Exit 141 Ipoh North Exit (for southbound traffic). The toll plazas in Ipoh are therefore relocated <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>ends</b> of the local-express lanes.|$|R
30|$|In this section, {{we propose}} a {{distributed}} MMSE relaying scheme that minimizes the sum MSE by jointly optimizing the precoder <b>at</b> <b>each</b> relay and the receive filter <b>at</b> <b>each</b> user <b>end.</b>|$|R
5|$|Arrowmen are {{identified}} {{by a white}} sash bearing a red arrow that is worn over their right shoulder. An Ordeal member wears a sash with a lone arrow. The Brotherhood member wears a sash bearing an arrow with a red bar <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> of the arrow. A Vigil Honor member wears a sash with the same bars of as the Brotherhood sash <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> of the arrow, and a Vigil Honor triangle {{on the center of}} the shaft. Members wear the sash at Order of the Arrow functions and special Scouting activities when members need to be identified as Arrowmen rendering special services. The OA sash is not worn {{at the same time as}} the merit badge sash, nor worn folded in the belt. The sash as a form of recognition dates to the founding of the Order and has a long history of changes in usage and design.|$|E
5|$|Greathead had {{originally}} {{planned for the}} trains to be hauled {{by a pair of}} small electric locomotives, one <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> of a train, but the Board of Trade rejected this proposal and a larger locomotive was designed which was able to pull up to seven carriages on its own. Twenty-eight locomotives were manufactured in America by the General Electric Company (of which syndicate member Darius Ogden Mills was a director) and assembled in the Wood Lane depot. A fleet of 168 carriages was manufactured by the Ashbury Railway Carriage and Iron Company and the Brush Electrical Engineering Company. Passengers boarded and left the trains through folding lattice gates <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> of the carriages; these gates were operated by guards who rode on an outside platform. The CLR {{had originally}} intended to have two classes of travel, but dropped the plan before opening, although its carriages were built with different qualities of interior fittings for this purpose.|$|E
5|$|Irwin {{developed}} and patented a football scoreboard, {{which was in}} use in the Ivy League by the 1890s. The large scoreboard featured a miniature representation of a football field, and the ball moved along the board to report each play. By 1915, Irwin's scoreboards were featured <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> of {{the field for the}} Army-Navy game at the Polo Grounds.|$|E
50|$|Stone columns {{support the}} porticos on each side, {{and there are}} {{sheltered}} platforms <b>at</b> <b>each</b> gable <b>end.</b> The protruding bay with the arch window {{was used by the}} telegraph operator.|$|R
50|$|Pepes is made {{by mixing}} {{descaled}} and gutted fish or any type of food {{with a mixture of}} spices including salt, chilli, shallots, garlic, turmeric, ginger, lemongrass, curry leaf, candlenut, tamarind, tomato, and lemon basil all wrapped in a banana leaf. Sundanese cuisine recognizes two types of pepes: the regular or “plain” variety and yellow pepes, which is cooked with turmeric. The leaf is wrapped tight and secured with a stick <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>ends,</b> then steamed or grilled. To make a soft-boned fish pepes, the method using pressure-cooker or prolonged cooking time is employed.|$|R
5000|$|<b>At</b> <b>each</b> <b>ending</b> {{the player}} {{received}} a score {{from zero to}} ten based on how far they had {{made it through the}} book and if the ending was a failure, a chance to try again at the choice where they decided incorrectly. The books also usually contained a [...] "cheater trap", reached by opting to use an item which does not exist (at least not in the current book). The story abruptly ends; the reader is chastised and not given a chance to try again in the endings resulting from these.|$|R
5|$|On the {{southwest}} of the palace courtyard there were some low platforms, possibly ritual dance platforms, and on the southeast side was a building with benches against three of the walls and hearths <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end.</b> This {{may have been the}} room where the Ahpo Sotz'il held court and received visitors and tribute.|$|E
5|$|The planetarium {{projector}} was a -long dumbbell-shaped object, with -diameter spheres attached <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> {{representing the}} night sky for {{the northern and southern}} hemispheres. Connecting the two spheres was a framework that held nearly 150 individual projectors, including those dedicated to the planets, the Sun, and specific stars.|$|E
5|$|The {{platforms}} {{are numbered}} 1 to 15 but passenger trains {{are confined to}} just eight tracks. Most platforms are numbered separately <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end,</b> with odd numbers at the east end and even numbers at the west. Platform 2 is not signalled for passenger trains, {{and there is no}} platform 14.|$|E
50|$|The edifice {{displays}} separated avant-corps, {{with many}} different gables pierced by dormers. Roof plinth {{is covered with}} Silesian granite tiles, while Monk and Nun tiles cover {{the rest of the}} gables. Two turrets stands <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>ends,</b> the main avant-corps balcony being flanked by metal-covered onion domes ending with finials. A small panoramic terrace overlooks the ensemble. The main front façade still exhibits an oak door with oval shaped transom light made of crystal panes. On the latter, a Neo-Baroque coat of arms displays the symbols of agriculture (a beehive, a shovel, a hoe, a plow) and a cornucopia overflowing with fruits.|$|R
25|$|Following the re-branding to Irish Rail in 1988, {{two white}} 3inch (75mm) vinyl strips were added, {{separating}} the black from the tan {{above and below}} it. Two reflective Fluorescent Red 3M Scotchcal 12inch square panels were applied <b>at</b> <b>each</b> body <b>end.</b>|$|R
50|$|The rebuilt north aisle {{included}} reused 15th century light {{windows on}} the north wall and <b>at</b> <b>each</b> gable <b>end.</b> A stoup {{is located in the}} porch wall {{to the right of the}} doorway. The original octagonal, Gothic-panelled font is now buried under the church floor.|$|R
5|$|Unusually for a Thames bridge, {{only three}} of Chiswick Bridge's five spans cross the river; the shorter spans <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> of the bridge cross the former towpaths. To allow {{sufficient}} clearance for shipping without steep inclines, the approach roads to the bridge are elevated from some distance back from the river.|$|E
5|$|Variola {{is a large}} brick-shaped virus {{measuring}} approximately 302 to 350 nanometers by 244 to 270nm, with {{a single}} linear double stranded DNA genome 186 kilobase pairs (kbp) in size and containing a hairpin loop <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end.</b> The two classic varieties of smallpox are variola major and variola minor.|$|E
5|$|A Jonline {{is a short}} line used by scuba divers {{to fasten}} {{themselves}} to something. The original purpose was to fasten a diver to a shot line during decompression stops in current. The line is typically around 1m (3 feet) long and equipped with a clip <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end.</b> One clip is fastened to the diver's harness, {{and the other is}} used to fasten the line to the anchor line. In current this relieves the diver from holding on to the anchor line during the decompression stop.|$|E
25|$|For {{the past}} program, {{the third and}} fourth cars, {{coloured}} in green were even more radical in the reconfiguration, with all but eight parts of seats, four <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>ends</b> of the car removed completely. In its place was standing room with upholstered cushion, in an attempt to provide a degree of comfort to passengers standing in that space. This design proved to be unpopular with the commuters, and it was eventually dropped. The original seats between the 1st and 2nd door, and the 3rd and 4th door on these cars have been replaced. The remaining upholstered seats were reverted to original seats in May 2006. All C151 trains had their seats on the middle part of carriage removed.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: With the {{appearance}} of micromachined mechanical elements and nanotechnology, increased demand can be observed for coordinate measuring systems having submicron accuracy. Probes are major components of such a coordinate measuring machine. They contribute to a large extend to measurement uncertainty of the CMM. In this paper a new low cost design is presented. The moving element of the probe head consists of the stylus and a cross form intermediate body with a small aluminum enhanced mirror <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>ends</b> and <b>at</b> the center. The intermediate body is suspended on four springs made of beryllium-copper foils. The displacement of the probe tip is calculated from the displacement and the rotations of the mirrors measured by modified optical pick-ups. ...|$|R
50|$|The usual {{formation}} for {{the newly}} built units {{was to have a}} Driving Motor Brake Third (DMBT) car <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>ends,</b> with accommodation for 108 passengers in nine compartments, together with two Trailer Third (TT) cars between with ten or eleven compartments giving a total passenger accommodation for 456 in all four coaches. (After the renaming of 'Third Class' to 'Second Class' in 1956 these became DMBS and TS respectively.) However some of the rebuilds had Trailer Composite (TC) cars. The earlier coaches provided compartments, whereas the post war newly built carriages tended to provide saloon or semi-saloon style accommodation to allow for more standing room. These new 'open' carriages were designated DMBTO or TTO.|$|R
5|$|A change {{occurred}} {{in the game and}} the role of the goalkeeper in the 1880s, when the Scottish reduced the size of the scoring area by placing rugby posts, spaced about 10 feet apart, <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> of the pool. At the same time, the rules were changed to allow goalkeepers to stand on the pool deck and leap onto the head of an opposing player who approached the goal. This change in the rules was brief. To prevent the serious injuries that resulted from this method of goalkeeping, the rules were revised again to require the goalie to remain in the water.|$|E
5|$|Association football, more {{commonly}} known as football or soccer, is a team sport played between two teams of eleven players with a spherical ball. It is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries and dependencies, making it the world's most popular sport. The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end.</b> The object {{of the game is}} to score by getting the ball into the opposing goal.|$|E
5|$|Because of the hilly terrain, {{the station}} was built in a deep cutting {{excavated}} from Highgate Hill adjacent to Archway Road. Tunnels penetrated the hillside <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> of the station, leading towards East Finchley {{to the north and}} Crouch End to the south. When built, the station had two side platforms, with three tracks between them, and a station building on the south side. A footbridge linked the two platforms.|$|E
50|$|The {{facility}} has two operating runways. The 9503 ft east/west runway handles 96 {{percent of the}} traffic. It {{is equipped with a}} Fresnel Lens Optical Landing System (FLOLS) <b>at</b> <b>each</b> approach <b>end</b> as well as lighted carrier flight deck landing areas at both ends so pilots can simulate carrier landings.|$|R
25|$|In an {{infinite}} graph, a Trémaux tree must have exactly one infinite path for <b>each</b> <b>end</b> of the graph, {{and the existence}} of a Trémaux tree characterizes the graphs whose topological completions, formed by adding a point <b>at</b> infinity for <b>each</b> <b>end,</b> are metric spaces.|$|R
50|$|The Woodsboro and Frederick Turnpike Company Tollhouse is a {{historic}} toll house located at Walkersville, Frederick County, Maryland, United States. It is a two-story brick structure over a stone foundation, with a small interior <b>end</b> chimney <b>at</b> <b>each</b> gable <b>end.</b> It {{was used as a}} tollhouse by the Woodsboro and Frederick Turnpike Company.|$|R
5|$|Each train {{consists}} of six cars, {{from front to}} back: IM, CM, TTC, TT, CM and IM. The IM class carriages <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> of the train are powered and fitted with a driver's compartment. The CM class is a powered passenger car. Class TTC is unpowered, it {{is equipped with a}} pantograph and a restaurant. The TT class is an unpowered passenger car which has also a pantograph on its roof. Each of the powered carriages is fitted with one motor on each of the two bogies. If needed, two trains can be coupled together.|$|E
5|$|Except for its two stations—one <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> of the tunnel—the line ran entirely underground. The {{line was}} built {{in less than three}} months, and on its {{completion}} in 1936 was one of the shortest independent railway lines in the country. It was open for only three years before being converted to a major air-raid shelter during World War II. After the war's end, it {{was not included in the}} 1948 nationalisation of British railways but remained in private hands.|$|E
5|$|Following the 15th century Reformation when {{clerical}} {{marriage was}} permitted, larger households {{would have been}} required {{and as a result}} some of the houses were altered and combined by knocking through walls, into larger dwellings. Others had extensions built to the rear. Water supply was originally from two wells, one <b>at</b> <b>each</b> <b>end</b> of the close. By 1468 lead pipes had been installed to bring water into the houses, although the wells continued to function until the 19th century. Number 22 is the house which still has most of its original medieval structure as it was originally built.|$|E
50|$|Newtown Manor House was {{originally}} constructed in 1789. It is a -story brick, five-bay brick {{house with a}} pair of interior chimneys <b>at</b> <b>each</b> gable <b>end.</b> The structure originally had a gambrel roof, which was raised and changed to its present shape in 1816. The house, which belongs to the parish, is currently unoccupied.|$|R
50|$|Carvill Hall, {{also known}} as Carvill's Prevention or Salter's Load or Packerton, is a {{historic}} home located at Chestertown, Kent County, Maryland.
