50|$|As part of Canada's {{transition}} to digital television, CKCO flash-cut to digital on August 31, 2011.

5000|$|The channel was <b>allocated</b> <b>channel</b> 0 (the 0 was {{pronounced}} as the letter O instead of [...] "zero") on the VHF band and was launched on 1 July 1965 as TVQ-0. Just like its Melbourne equivalent, TVQ-0 was initially owned by Sir Reginald Ansett, until {{the station was}} taken over in the early 1980s.|$|E
50|$|Prior to December 2007 (when all {{local public}} service {{channels}} {{moved to the}} digital tier), Bright House <b>allocated</b> <b>channel</b> 15 for local Government-access television in Pinellas County, and had given that slot to WZRA on an interim basis, until Tarpon Springs started their own channel. And with WZRA being a low-powered station, Bright House is not obligated to carry the channel.|$|E
50|$|In October 2015, Imagen was {{approved}} to relocate all stations {{planned to be}} built above channel 36, {{in order to facilitate}} the repacking of television spectrum. Several other transmitters changed <b>allocated</b> <b>channels</b> as a result.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — An {{important}} aspect of the deployment of wireless LANs lies in careful planning of the locations and the channel assignments of the Access Points (APs). The APs need to be placed optimally to provide maximum coverage and minimize interference with other APs. Also, in the case of ad-hoc networks that require no fixed network infrastructure, {{there is a need to}} <b>allocate</b> <b>channels</b> carefully so as to minimize interference and improve the system performance. In this paper, we propose a distributed bootstrapping mechanism (BOOST) for ad-hoc networks that <b>allocates</b> <b>channels</b> so as to improve system performance in terms of throughput and average delay. We present experimental results that motivate the design of BOOST protocol which is validated through ns- 2 simulations. We propose two different approaches for bootstrapping using received power and number of beacons. Simulation results for both these approaches show a significant increase in the system performance compared to a random channel assignment...|$|R

50|$|Originally {{granted the}} callsign W07CP in November 1997, it became W55CR in December 1998, {{broadcasting}} on channel 55. The station then was granted the call letters WDAH-CA from January 2004 to July 2005. After {{a change in}} ownership, the station changed call letters and became WYGA-CA. In filings with the Federal Communications Commission, WYGA-CA {{had been forced to}} cease operations on a full-time basis on its <b>allocated</b> <b>channel</b> 55 due to issues with its transmit site, likely due to MediaFLO subscription mobile TV using the same channel, or nearby W55BM, or both.|$|E
5000|$|The FCC {{had already}} <b>allocated</b> <b>channel</b> 15 to Knoxville for {{non-commercial}} use {{and plans to}} activate it as a satellite of WSJK cropped up from 1972 onward. There were also attempts to activate a satellite in the Tri-Cities on channel 41. However, they all collapsed, {{due to a lack}} of state funding to match the available federal funding, a situation largely caused by the 1970s economic recessions affecting state revenues. Since the Board of Education had begun all but one of its proposed stations by that point, priority was given to activating WCTE for the Upper Cumberland region, the last large area of the state that had no public television service at all; that station didn't come online until 1978.|$|E
50|$|The first {{commercial}} networks in Australia involved commercial stations that shared programming in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and later Perth, with each network forming networks {{based on their}} <b>allocated</b> <b>channel</b> numbers: TCN-9 in Sydney, GTV-9 in Melbourne, QTQ-9 in Brisbane, NWS-9 in Adelaide and STW-9 in Perth together formed the Nine Network; while their equivalents on VHF channels 7 and 10 respectively formed the Seven Network and Network Ten. Until 1989, areas outside of these main cities had access to only a single commercial station, and these rural stations often formed small networks such as Prime Television. Beginning in 1989, however, television markets in rural areas began to aggregate, allowing these rural networks to broadcast over a larger area, often an entire state, and become full-time affiliates to one specific metropolitan network.|$|E

5000|$|In {{a number}} of {{countries}} the allocation is still channelized at present, whereas others have block or band allocations or a mixture. Voice operation is generally in upper sideband (USB) mode to facilitate inter-communication by non-amateur service users if necessary. In the United States and its Dependencies, channelized USB is mandatory. Where channelization is used, the USB suppressed carrier frequency (a.k.a. 'dial' frequency) is normally 1.5 kHz below the quoted channel frequency. For example, 5403.5 kHz is the 'dial' frequency for the channel centered on 5405 kHz. The [...] "center" [...] of the channel {{is based on the assumption}} that the bandwidth of SSB transmissions are 3 kHz, at most. Transmitters that are capable of wider SSB bandwidths should be adjusted for 3 kHz bandwidth or less so their emissions stay within the <b>allocated</b> <b>channel.</b>|$|E
5000|$|ITV {{launched}} a one-hour timeshift channel of ITV3 on Monday 30 October 2006, it was <b>allocated</b> <b>channel</b> number 213 on Sky. This is now used by Channel W.

The channel launched on Freeview on 15 October 2013 using downtime from ITV-owned shopping channel The Store. Initially on Freeview, ITV3 +1 broadcast from 01:00 till 06:00 - these hours were extended and brought forward in February 2014, now airing from 18:00 till 00:00 in the higher EPG slot of channel 34. On 25 August 2015, ITV3 +1 extended its hours on Freeview to 18:00 till 06:00.|$|E
50|$|On January 22, 1992, the FCC {{granted a}} {{construction}} permit to San Antonio College {{to build a}} new station to broadcast on UHF channel 48, and assigned it the call sign K48DS. Signing on in January 1994, the station broadcast educational programming. The FCC <b>allocated</b> <b>channel</b> 48 for KSAT-TV's digital operations in April 1997, and San Antonio College tried to move the station to channel 46, but were denied permission to do so. By April 2002, KSAT-DT signed on, and K48DS was forced to shut down. Unable to operate the station on its licensed frequency, and in need of funds for construction, the college sold the station to Mako Communications on August 17, 2004. The new owners relocated the station to channel 40 in March 2005 under the call sign K40IH, then changed the call sign to KISA-LP seven months later.|$|E

50|$|In 1998, OBN {{expanded}} its operations with the upgrade of its studio facilities, {{the installation of}} two giant satellite dishes and a new tower, the tallest in Tonga. Three additional free-to-air channels were also opened to the viewing public, Channel 8 (a PAL version of Channel 7), Channel 9 (broadcasting CNN, and later BBC World & Fox News in NTSC), and Channel 10 (a PAL version of Channel 9). This is when the company started emphasising the OBN moniker, as opposed to TV 7. However, the station is perhaps still best known (and more popularly referred to) among viewers as TV 7. In 2000, OBN ceased to operate Channel 9, after the Tongan government revoked OBN's license for that frequency. The government then <b>allocated</b> <b>Channel</b> 9 for its own television station, TV Tonga. OBN later dropped Channel 10, broadcasting on Channels 7(NTSC) & 8(PAL) only.|$|E
