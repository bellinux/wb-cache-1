25|$|A more {{authentic}} tradition represents Lysias as having spoken his own Olympiacus at the Olympic festival of 388 BC, to which Dionysius I of Syracuse {{had sent a}} magnificent embassy.

Lysias lifted up his voice to denounce Dionysius <b>as,</b> <b>next</b> to Artaxerxes, the worst enemy of Hellas, and to impress upon the assembled Greeks that one of their foremost duties was to deliver Sicily from a hateful oppression. The latest work of Lysias which we can date (a fragment of a speech For Pherenicus) belongs to 381 or 380 BC. He probably died in or soon after 380 BC.|$|E

25|$|During {{the rule}} of the {{provisional}} governmental in the summer 1917, Kirill escaped to Finland where his wife gave birth to the couple's only son. In exile they lived for some years among his wife's relatives in Germany, and from the late 1920s on an estate they bought in Saint-Briac. With the execution of his cousins Tsar Nicholas II and Grand Duke Michael, Kirill assumed the headship of the Imperial Family of Russia and, <b>as</b> <b>next</b> in line to the throne as the Guardian of the Throne in 1924. Kirill proclaimed himself emperor in exile in 1926. He worked for the restoration of the monarchy from exile {{for the rest of his}} life, but his claims were contested by some factions of the monarchy movement in a division that subsists until today. He wrote a book of memoirs, My Life in Russia's Service, published after his death. His granddaughter, Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna, is the current claimant to the headship of the House of Romanov.|$|E
25|$|Having bowled Australia out for 215, England {{decided not}} to enforce the follow on. In England's 2nd Innings, openers Strauss and Cook started brightly as they looked to score quick runs to {{increase}} their lead in the match. After reaching 32 in 42 balls, Cook was trapped LBW by spinner Nathan Hauritz while England were on 61. Strauss fared little better against Hauritz and was out against him shortly afterwards by a catch from Michael Clarke. These two wickets brought Bopara and Pietersen to the crease and also signalled a slowing of the run rate. This partnership lasted 28 overs when Hauritz, showing few ill-effects from his dislocated middle finger on Day 1, got another England wicket. Simon Katich caught Bopara for 27 from 93 balls. When Pietersen fell 7 overs later, caught behind to Siddle, the score 174 for 4. It was left to Collingwood and wicketkeeper Prior to accelerate the run-rate for England. Matt Prior in particular enjoyed success hitting a quick-fire 61 off 42 balls (an innings which included 9 boundaries) until he was dismissed run out by a quick piece of fielding from Marcus North. Upon Prior's dismissal came Andrew Flintoff, playing in his last test for England at Lord's. Flintoff with Collingwood made a fifty partnership in 8 overs with Collingwood reaching his half-century. When Collingwood was dismissed caught behind off Siddle, Stuart Broad came on <b>as</b> <b>next</b> batsman but failed to face a ball as the umpires stopped play due to rain. Almost immediately afterwards, heavy showers meant that play was abandoned for the day with England 311 for 6, a lead over Australia of 521.|$|E

500|$|In 1996, Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges {{published}} a new arrangement for the genus, after cladistic analyses yielded a cladogram {{significantly different from}} George's arrangement. Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement retained B.aemula in series Banksia, placing it in B.subser. Banksia along with [...] serrata as its sister taxon (united by their unusual seedling leaves) and ornata <b>as</b> <b>next</b> closest relative. This arrangement stood until 1999, when George effectively reverted to his 1981 arrangement in his monograph for the Flora of Australia series.|$|E
500|$|Since 1998, American {{botanist}} Austin Mast {{and co-authors}} have been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence {{data for the}} subtribe Banksiinae, which then comprised genera Banksia and Dryandra. Their analyses suggest a phylogeny that differs greatly from George's taxonomic arrangement. Banksia oblongifolia resolves as the closest relative, or [...] "sister", to B.robur, with B.plagiocarpa <b>as</b> <b>next</b> closest relative. In 2007, Mast and Thiele rearranged the genus Banksia by merging Dryandra into it, and published B.subg. Spathulatae for the taxa having spoon-shaped cotyledons; thus B.subg. Banksia was redefined as encompassing taxa lacking spoon-shaped cotyledons. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, B.oblongifolia is placed in B.subg. Spathulatae.|$|E
