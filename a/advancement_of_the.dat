5|$|Dante's {{rewriting}} of the Lucanian scene 'recuperates' {{the witch}} Erichtho by making her {{necessary to the}} Dantean Virgil's status as guide: she thus functions {{in accord with the}} Christian providence that controls the <b>advancement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Commedias plot line. At the same time, the Lucanian Erichtho is both marginalized and subordinated to a higher power. In this sense, Dante's rewriting of Erichtho also undoes Lucan's subversion of the original Virgilian model.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s {{when the}} Belgians began {{to fear that}} {{the rise of a}} {{powerful}} Luba elite would become a threat to colonial rule, the administration began to support Lulua organisations.

5|$|On July 1, 1968, Vernon D. Crawford became {{dean of the}} institute's General College.

5|$|Religious {{paintings}} were commissioned for royal and ducal palaces, for churches, hospitals, and convents, and for wealthy clerics and private donors.

The Netherlandish painters were responsible for many innovations, including the <b>advancement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> diptych format, the conventions of donor portraits, new conventions for Marian portraits, and, through works such as van Eyck's Madonna of Chancellor Rolin and van der Weyden's Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin in the 1430s, laying the foundation for the development of landscape painting as a separate genre.|$|E

5|$|The Discourses are a {{collection}} of explanations and elucidations that Meher Baba has given on many topics that concern the <b>advancement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spiritual aspirant.

His explanations often include stories from the lore of India and the Sufi culture. One such story, the wise man and the ghost, shows the power that superstitious beliefs can have on a person, while another, Majnun and Layla, show how selfless love, even in human relations, can lead one to discipleship.|$|E
5|$|The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism was Weber's {{third major}} {{work on the}} {{sociology}} of religion.

In Weber's view, Hinduism in India, like Confucianism in China, was a barrier for capitalism. The Indian caste system made it very difficult for individuals to advance in the society beyond their caste. Activity, including economic activity, was seen as unimportant {{in the context of the}} <b>advancement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soul.|$|E

5|$|A {{long period}} of peace between Parthia and Rome ensued, with only the {{invasion}} of Alans into Parthia's eastern territories around 72AD mentioned by Roman historians. Whereas Augustus and Nero had chosen a cautious military policy when confronting Parthia, later Roman emperors invaded and attempted to conquer the eastern Fertile Crescent, {{the heart of the}} Parthian Empire along the Tigris and Euphrates. The heightened aggression can be explained in part by Rome's military reforms. To match Parthia's strength in missile troops and mounted warriors, the Romans at first used foreign allies (especially Nabataeans), but later established a permanent auxilia force to complement their heavy legionary infantry. The Romans eventually maintained regiments of horse archers (sagittarii) and even mail-armored cataphracts in their eastern provinces. Yet the Romans had no discernible grand strategy in dealing with Parthia and gained very little territory from these invasions. The primary motivations for war were the <b>advancement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> personal glory and political position of the emperor, as well as defending Roman honor against perceived slights such as Parthian interference in the affairs of Rome's client states.|$|E
5|$|The Report was {{received}} warmly by Virginia Democratic-Republicans. The General Assembly arranged for five thousand copies to be printed and {{distributed in the}} state, but {{there was not much}} public response to the Report, and it appears to have had relatively little impact on the presidential election of 1800 (which was, nevertheless, a major victory for the Democratic-Republicans and a repudiation of Federalist policies). Parties outside Virginia seemed uninterested in the rehashing of the 1798 Resolutions, and in other states there was very little public comment. Jefferson eagerly sought copies for distribution to Democratic-Republican members of Congress departing for their home states, and when they failed to arrive he entreated Monroe for at least one copy that he could reproduce. Despite Jefferson's approval of and attempt to distribute Madison's work, the national reaction was tepid. Though it had little impact on the immediate election, Madison's Report clarified the legal argument against the Acts and for states' rights in general, particularly in its <b>advancement</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tenth Amendment rather than the Ninth as the main bulwark against federal encroachment on state autonomy.|$|E
