5|$|Taking {{place after}} the events of Mega Man 4, Mega Man's brother and ally Proto Man un{{character}}istically leads a group of menacing robots in <b>attacks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> and kidnaps his own creator Dr. Light, leaving the title character {{little choice but to}} take up arms in a fight against his once trusted sibling. Mega Man 5 carries over the same graphical style and action-platforming gameplay as the four preceding chapters in the series. The game introduces a new character, Beat, a robotic bird that the player can use as a weapon once a series of eight collectible letters are found. Artist Keiji Inafune had to re-illustrate the bosses several times but described his work as fun.|$|E
5|$|The 767 {{has been}} {{involved}} in six hijackings, three resulting in loss of life, for a combined total of 282 occupant fatalities. On November 23, 1996, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 961, a 767-200ER, was hijacked and crash-landed in the Indian Ocean near the Comoros Islands after running out of fuel, killing 125 out of the 175 persons on board; survivors have been rare among instances of land-based aircraft ditching on water. Two 767s were involved in the September 11 <b>attacks</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Trade Center in 2001, resulting in the collapse of its two main towers. American Airlines Flight 11, a 767-200ER, crashed into the North Tower, killing all 92 people on board, and United Airlines Flight 175, a 767-200, crashed into the South Tower, with the death of all 65 on board. In addition, more than 2,600 people were killed in the towers or on the ground. A foiled 2001 shoe bomb plot involving an American Airlines 767-300ER resulted in passengers being required to remove their shoes for scanning at US security checkpoints.|$|E

25|$|The company {{spun off}} its Travelers Property and Casualty {{insurance}} underwriting business in 2002.

40|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Trade Center <b>on</b> 9 / 11 {{volatility}} of daily returns of the US stock market rose sharply. This increase in volatility may reflect {{fundamental changes in}} the economic determinants of prices such as expected earnings, interest rates, real growth and inflation. Alternatively, the increase in volatility may simply reflect the effects of increased uncertainty in the financial markets. This study therefore sets out {{to determine if the}} effects of <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Trade Center <b>on</b> 9 / 11 had a fundamental or purely financial impact on US real estate returns. In order to do this we compare pre- and post- 9 / 11 crisis returns for a number of US REIT indexes using an approach suggested by French and Roll (1986), as extended by Tuluca et al (2003). In general we find no evidence that the effects of 9 / 11 had a fundamental effect on REIT returns. In other words, we find that the effect of <b>the</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Trade Center <b>on</b> 9 / 11 had only a financial effect on REIT returns and therefore was transitory...|$|R
