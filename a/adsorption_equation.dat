40|$|AbstractThe {{particle}} size of sediment {{is one of}} the main factors that influence the phosphorus physical adsorption on sediment. In order to eliminate the effect of other components of sediment on the phosphorus physical adsorption the sediment mineral matrices were obtained by removing inorganic matter metal oxides, and organic matter from natural sediments, which were collected from the Nantong reach of the Yangtze River. The results show that an exponential relationship exists between the median {{particle size}} (D 50) and specific surface area (Sg) of the sediment mineral matrices, and the fine sediment mineral matrix sample has a larger specific surface area and pore volume than the coarse sediment particles. The kinetic equations were used to describe the phosphorus adsorption process of the sediment mineral matrices, including the Elovich <b>equation,</b> quasi-first-order <b>adsorption</b> kinetic <b>equation,</b> and quasi-second-order <b>adsorption</b> kinetic <b>equation.</b> The results show that the quasi-second-order <b>adsorption</b> kinetic <b>equation</b> has the best fitting effect.

Such models are natural examples of the general methodology developed by J. W. Gibbs in his treatment of the thermodynamics of surfaces. We employ the methodology of J. W.

We show that the Gibbs <b>adsorption</b> <b>equation</b> holds for systems with gradient energy coe Â¯ cients, provided the appropriate de nitions of surface excess quantities are used.
