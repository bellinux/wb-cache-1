It is only possible to carry out these treatments on a routine basis in acceptable examination times with 3 T. The technical constraints are overcome with third generation MRI and the improvement of the spatial resolution in examination times reduced by 30 to 50 % increases patient comfort. Nevertheless, the financial constraints represent a major handicap. It is not possible to obtain an economic balance with rates based on the cost and depreciation of 1. 5 T imagers that are half the price...|$|E

Experimental design: Met TKI inhibitor PF- 2341066 alone, or in combination with cisplatin, was investigated {{for its ability to}} block HGF-induced signaling and biological effects in vitro and in vivo. HGF/Met expression and activation of signaling in NPC cells were detected by using Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Biological evaluation, including wound healing, cell proliferation, and invasion of NPC cells, was also examined, and the correlation between HGF/Met expression of primary and metastatic tumor in NPC patients and clinical prognosis were also analyzed. Results: Met TKI inhibitor, PF- 2341066, inhibited growth of NPC cells in vivo with half maximal inhibitory concentration of 0. 79 ± 0. 21 µmol/L, and suppressed invasion and migration of NPC cells; also, the inhibition of PF- 2341066 was synergized with cisplatin treatment. Compared with the control group, Met TKI inhibited metastasis of transplanted NPC in nude mice (the number of live metastases [mean ± SD]: 5. 8 ± 2. 2 versus 11. 8 ± 2. 2, P= 0. 03; the number of lung metastases: 2. 3 ± 1. 5 versus 5. 3 ± 0. 9, P= 0. 06). HGF was widely expressed in both primary and metastatic lesions while Met expression of metastatic lesions was higher than that of primary lesions (primary lesions: 24. 7 %; liver metastases: 40 %; lung metastases: 29 %; lymph node metastases: 29 %, P< 0. 05), and overall survival of NPC patients with higher expression of Met was shorter (P= 0. 13). Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that HGF/Met signaling promoted NPC growth, further resulting in metastasis and poor prognosis. Met TKI, PF- 2341066, showed potent antitumor activity in vivo and in vitro which was enhanced by combination with cisplatin. Our study implied that HGF/Met signaling was the potential therapeutic target in NPC, and blockage of the signaling could prevent growth and metastasis of NPC and derive clinical benefit.

This preclinical study investigated the effect of MK- 2206, a potent allosteric AKT inhibitor, on human NPC cells in vitro and in vivo. Methods: The effect of MK- 2206  on the growth and proliferation of CNE- 1, CNE- 2, HONE- 1, and SUNE- 1  cells was assessed by Cell Counting Kit 8  and colony formation assay. Flow cytometry was performed to analyze cell cycle and apoptosis. The effects of MK- 2206  on the AKT pathway were analyzed by Western blotting. Autophagy induction was evaluated via electron microscopy and Western blot. To test the effects of MK- 2206  in vivo, CNE- 2  cells were subcutaneously implanted into nude mice. Tumor-bearing mice were treated orally with MK- 2206  or placebo. Tumors were harvested for immunohistochemical analysis. Results: In vitro, MK- 2206  inhibited the four NPC cell line growths and reduced the sizes of the colonies in a dose-dependent manner. At 72  and 96  hours, the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) values of MK- 2206  in CNE- 1, CNE- 2, and HONE- 1  cell lines were 3 – 5  µM, whereas in SUNE- 1, IC 50  was less than 1  µM, and MK- 2206  induced cell cycle arrest at the G 1  phase. However, our study found no evidence of apoptosis. MK- 2206  induced autophagy in NPC cells, as evidenced by electron microscopy and Western blot, and inhibited the growth of tumors that were subcutaneously implanted in mice. Inhibition of downstream phosphorylation through the PRAS 40  and S 6  pathways seems to be the main mechanism for the MK- 2206 -induced growth inhibition. Conclusion: Our preclinical study suggests that MK- 2206 ’s antiproliferative effect may be useful for NPC treatment; however, strategies for reinforcing this effect are needed to maximize clinical benefit.
