Binding of (-) [3 H] <b>alprenolol</b> to these sites demonstrated the kinetics, affinity, and stereospecificity expected of binding to adenylate cyclase-coupled beta-adrenergic receptors.

The order of potency was (-) isoproterenol greater than (-) epinephrine greater than (-) -norepinephrine which agreed with the order of potency of these agents in stimulating leukocyte adenylate cyclase. Dissociation constants computed from binding experiments were virtually identical to those obtained from adenylate cyclase activation studies.

A comparison between the sympathetic supply arising from the prevertebral and pelvic ganglia was also made. In the longitudinal muscle of the distal colon, sympathetic nerve stimulation caused responses which were contractile (0. 1 – 2 Hz), biphasic (5 – 10 Hz) or purely inhibitory (20 – 30 Hz). All contractile responses were removed with phentolamine (3 μM), whereas the inhibitory responses were significantly diminished by propranolol (0. 1 μM) and completely abolished by <b>alprenolol</b> (3 μM) or nadolol (300 μM). In the longitudinal muscle of the proximal colon, the effects of sympathetic nerve stimulation were predominantly inhibitory. Some of this inhibition was removed by propranolol (0. 1 μM), but was largely unaffected by <b>alprenolol</b> (3 μM). The remainder of the inhibitory response was probably non-noradrenergic as it was not removed {{by a combination of}} phentolamine (3 μM) and <b>alprenolol</b> (3 μM). In the circular muscle of both the proximal and distal colon, sympathetic stimulation caused a strong contractile response which was completely removed by phentolamine (3 μM) to reveal an inhibitory response. This inhibitory response was unchanged by propranolol (0. 1 μM) but was removed by <b>alprenolol</b> (3 μM), following which a weak non-noradrenergic contractile response was unmasked. Stimulation of the hypogastric nerve to activate pelvic sympathetic pathways had no effect on the motility of the longitudinal muscle, but caused a contractile response in the circular muscle which was completely removed by phentolamine (3 μM). We conclude that sympathetic nerves innervate adrenoceptors of different types in the various muscle layers and regions of the colon. They innervate a mixture of α-, and β 3 -adrenoceptors in the longitudinal muscle of the proximal colon, α-, classical β- and β 3 -adrenoceptors in the distal colon, and primarily α-adrenoceptors with a few β 3 -adrenoceptors in the circular muscle.

This yielded high-affinity β-adrenoceptor fluorescent ligands for both the propranolol and <b>alprenolol</b> derivatives; however, the pindolol-based products displayed lower affinity. A fluorescent diethylene glycol linked propranolol derivative (18 a) had the highest affinity (log KD of - 9. 53 and - 8. 46 as an antagonist of functional β 2 - and β 1 -mediated responses, respectively). Imaging studies with this compound further confirmed that it can be employed to selectively label the human β 2 -adrenoceptor in single living cells, with receptor-associated binding prevented by preincubation with the nonfluorescent β 2 -selective antagonist 3 -(isopropylamino) - 1 -[(7 -methyl- 4 -indanyl) oxy]-butan- 2 -ol (ICI 118551) (J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1983, 5, 430 - 437. ...|$|E
40|$|The binding {{constant}} between beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) and {{the drug}} <b>alprenolol</b> was obtained by capillary electrophoresis, under the conditions of 100 mmol/L phosphate buffer, pH 2. 5, 25 degrees C. Four methods, namely non-linear regression, double reciprocal, gamma-reciprocal and x-reciprocal were introduced to measure the binding constant, the values are 307. 2 L/mol, 408. 4 L/mol, 331. 4 L/mol and 343. 1 L/mol, respectively. The methods are applicable to measure the binding constant of Host-Guest interaction with 1 : 1 ratio...|$|E
40|$|The enantioseparation of acidic {{and basic}} {{compounds}} can be successfully achieved in nonaqueous capillary electrophoresis using single-isomer charged beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) derivatives of opposite charge {{to that of}} the analytes. This chapter describes how to separate the enantiomers of three basic substances selected as model compounds, i. e., <b>alprenolol,</b> bupranolol, and terbutaline, using the negatively charged heptakis(2, 3 -di-O-acetyl- 6 -O-sulfo) -beta-CD. The enantiomers of three acidic drugs (tiaprofenic acid, suprofen, and flurbiprofen) are resolved using a monosubstituted amino beta-CD derivative, namely, 6 -monodeoxy- 6 -mono(3 -hydroxy) propylamino-beta-CD...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} β-adrenoceptor antagonists with varying {{lipophilicity}} on microsomal phase I and II reactions was investigated using rat hepatic microsomes. The degree of inhibition of ethoxyresorufin deethylase paralleled octanol/water partition coefficients: propranolol > <b>alprenolol</b> > timolol > metoprolol > atenolol. Propranolol (highly lipophilic) and atenolol (hydrophilic) also had widely different effects on 7 -ethoxycoumarin deethylase inhibition and on disopyramide N-dealkylation. However the inhibition of harmol conjugation {{was not related}} {{in the same way}} to octanol/water partition coefficient as was the phase I reactions...|$|E
40|$|Ten normal male volunteers {{received}} either TOO mg <b>alprenolol</b> or placebo in a double-blind randomized trial. Ninety {{minutes later}} they performed a standardized Valsalva manoeuvre 40 : mmHg airway pressure for 12 seconds. Beat-to-beat measurements {{were made of}} heart rate, left ventricular ejection time (LVET), ejection time index (ETI), and ' corrected ejection time ' (LVET/Vye). After placebo, heart rate, left ventricular ejection time, and ejection time indexfollowed essentially the same beat-to-beat patterns as the normal response reported previously. fl-blockade produced qualitatively sinmlar curves, but with increased cycle length and reduced left ventricular ejection time per beat at all points. Both ejection time index and corrected ejection time curves did not differ sigmficantly between placebo and <b>alprenolol</b> for corresponding phases. fl-blockade, therefore, reduced control and subsequent heart rate so the Valsalva strain was sustained and completed withfewer heart beats during the standard time but with a pure rate effect on ejection time. This effect on the time-course of the Valsalva heart rate indicates that the same reflex re-sponse occurs but at a lower parallel set during fl-blockade. The Valsalva manoeuvre has long provided a safe, standardizable, noninvasive test which has proved useful in investigating both physiological and pathological cardiocirculatory responses (Gorlin...|$|E
40|$|Pulmonary {{arterial}} hypertension (PAH) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by severe angiogenic remodeling of the pulmonary artery wall and right ventricular hypertrophy. Thus, {{there is an}} increasing need for novel biomarkers to dissect disease heterogeneity, and predict treatment response. Although β-adrenergic receptor (βAR) dysfunction is well documented in left heart disease while endothelial cell-derived microparticles (Ec-MPs) are established biomarkers of angiogenic remodeling, methods for easy large clinical cohort analysis of these biomarkers are currently absent. Here we describe flow cytometric methods for quantification of βAR density on circulating white blood cells (WBC) and Ec-MPs in urine samples {{that can be used}} as potential biomarkers of right heart failure in PAH. Biotinylated β-blocker <b>alprenolol</b> was synthesized and validated as a βAR specific probe that was combined with immunophenotyping to quantify βAR density in circulating WBC subsets. Ec-MPs obtained from urine samples were stained for annexin-V and CD 144, and analyzed by a micro flow cytometer. Flow cytometric detection of <b>alprenolol</b> showed that βAR density was decreased in most WBC subsets in PAH samples compared to healthy controls. Ec-MPs in urine was increased in PAH compared to controls. Furthermore, there was a direct correlation between Ec-MPs and Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) in PAH patients. Therefore, flow cytometric quantification of peripheral blood cell βAR density and urinary Ec-MPs may be useful as potential biomarkers of right ventricular function in PAH...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSustained {{exposure}} of neuroblastoma × glioma hybrid, NG 108 - 15, cells transfected {{to express the}} human, β 2 -adrenoceptor (clone βN 22) to isoprenaline or iloprost (an agonist at the endogenously expressed IP prostanoid receptor) resulted in a substantial and selective down-regulation of the α subunit of the G-protein Gs. Treatment of these cells with the irreversible β-adrenoceptor antagonist bromoacetyl <b>alprenolol</b> menthane diminished both the potency and the maximal ability of isoprenaline but not of iloprost to cause Gsα down-regulation. These results demonstrate that the extent of agonist-mediated Gsα down-regulation is dependent upon the availability of receptor to agonist...|$|E
40|$|Hybridoma cells bearing {{monoclonal}} antibody against the beta-adrenergic ligand <b>alprenolol</b> {{were used as}} an immunogen to raise monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies. Of six anti-idiotypic antibodies, which inhibit ligand binding, three were able to recognize beta-adrenergic receptors. One of them, mAb 2 B 4, an IgM that could be amplified into ascites, binds to the beta-adrenergic catecholamine receptors of intact epidermoid A 431 cells and precipitates receptors solubilized from plasma membranes by digitonin. This antibody identifies the beta 2 -adrenergic receptor of A 431 cells as a single 55 -kDa protein and stimulates adenylate cyclase activity. This stimulation is inhibited by the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol...|$|E
