He served in Quetta, then Simla as a major in the Central Provisions Directorate. He became fluent in the Hindustani language and although friendly, never formed close relationships with other officers. He gave lectures and played some cricket while in India. He left the army in 1945 only to find his job with the coal mining company was no longer available.|$|E

25|$|With Goodson-Todman {{established}} as a reliable producer of high-rated games for CBS, including What's My Line?, To Tell the Truth, and I've Got a Secret, the network confidently gave the new word association game the 2:00 PM (1:00 Central) time slot, replacing the courtroom-themed game Face the Facts. As television's first successful celebrity-civilian team game, Password attracted a large and loyal audience that made it into a solid Nielsen favorite for nearly five years as shows came <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>with</b> great frequency on the other networks. A concurrent prime time version which debuted in January 1962 was also successful, albeit somewhat less than the daytime show; despite this, both versions performed strongly in the ratings and looked to run well past the late 1960s.|$|E

25|$|After a 3–4–1 start, the Bruins fired {{head coach}} Pat Burns <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>with</b> Mike Keenan {{for the rest}} of the way. Despite a 15-point {{improvement}} from the previous season, the Bruins missed the playoffs in 2000–01 by just one point, and Keenan was let go. Centerman Jason Allison led the Bruins in scoring. The following season, 2001–02, the Bruins improved again with another 13 points, winning their first Northeast Division title since 1993 with a core built around Joe Thornton, Sergei Samsonov, Brian Rolston, Bill Guerin, Mike Knuble and the newly acquired Glen Murray. Their regular season success did not translate to the post-season, however, as they lost in six games to the underdog eighth-place Montreal Canadiens in the first round.|$|E
25|$|Oral traditions {{claim that}} anlu was created when, during war, all the males were {{slaughtered}} (in some versions {{this is in}} Bamessi). The story records that the Kom people were a tributary to a chief in Mejang and their tribute was {{to build a house}} in the Mejang city every year. Eventually, the Kom refused and Mejang dispatched an army to put down the rebellion. The Mejang forces decided to attack while the men were hunting and capture all the women. The women heard about this and so dressed in male clothing <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>with</b> crude weapons to meet the Mejang. The men fled from what they thought were the troops of Kom and only one was captured. The women stripped off their clothing to reveal that the Mejang forces had been defeated by women and Mejang became a Kom tributary after that point.|$|E
25|$|Michael Vaughan won the toss and put Bangladesh in to bat at 10.30am on {{the first}} day at Lord's. The first ten overs of bowling by Steve Harmison and Matthew Hoggard were lacklustre, as neither {{mastered}} the early-morning swing and they bowled a wide line. A stronger side would have scored more runs in this period, by Bangladesh made only 31 before losing their first wicket. Bangladesh captain, Habibul Bashar then came <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>with</b> suicidal hoick when he was on three. The rest of the team succumbed quickly, often to bad balls as they failed to adjust to the English conditions. The English mixed the odd good length ball with the short and wide stuff, inducing edges through to the slips at regular intervals – although, admittedly, the Bangladeshis would never have been out if they'd tried to play a bit more defensively.|$|E

25|$|Throughout its history, {{the station}} has always carried local news programming. Branded {{for years as}} Eyewitness News from 1974 to 1995, its newscasts were retitled as Fox 7 News from 1995 to 1998 {{following}} the affiliation switch to Fox. When WTVW joined Fox, news programming on the station was expanded to two hours on weekday mornings, along {{with the addition of}} a 5 p.m. newscast. Newscasts came <b>and</b> <b>went,</b> <b>with</b> the midday news being cancelled in the late 1990s, later followed by the 5 p.m. and finally, the morning news. This eventually left only the 6 and 9 p.m. newscasts (the 10 p.m. news had earlier been moved into the 9 p.m. slot and expanded to an hour); however, the morning and midday newscasts returned in March 2002. In 2006, the weekday morning newscast expanded to three hours, the midday newscast moved to noon and a 6:30p.m. weeknight newscast was added to the schedule.|$|E
25|$|Schur {{found himself}} lonely after {{the flight of}} many of his {{students}} and the expulsion of renowned scientists from his previous place of work. Only Dr. Helmut Grunsky had been friendly to him, as Schur reported in the late thirties to his expatriate student Max Menachem Schiffer. The Gestapo was everywhere. Since Schur had announced to his wife his intentions to commit suicide in case of a summons to the Gestapo, in the summer of 1938 his wife took his letters, and with them a summons from the Gestapo, sent Issai Schur to a relaxing stay in a home outside of Berlin <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>with</b> medical certificate allowing her to meet the Gestapo in place of her husband. There they flatly asked why they were still staying in Germany. But there were economic obstacles to the planned emigration : Emigrating Germans had a pre-departure Reich Flight Tax to pay, which was a quarter of their assets. Now Schur's wife had inherited a mortgage on a house in Lithuania, which because of the Lithuanian foreign exchange determination could not be repaid. On the other hand, Schur was forbidden to default or leave the mortgage to the German Reich. Thus the Schurs lacked cash and cash equivalents. Finally, the missing sum of money was somehow supplied, and to this day {{it does not seem to}} be clear who were the donors.|$|E
