The digital library {{provides access to}} documents whose content is described using terms from a predefined taxonomy that {{is a set of}} terms together with a subsumption relation between terms. The same taxonomy is also used to express the users profiles that represent users preferences on which rely the personalization services.

50|$|An {{information}} service and <b>alerting</b> <b>service</b> {{are the basic}} levels of air traffic service, providing information pertinent to the safe and efficient conduct of flights and alerting the different relevant authorities should an aircraft be in distress. These are available to all aircraft through a FIR. Higher levels of Air Traffic Advisory and Control services may be available within certain portions of airspace within a FIR, according to the ICAO class of that portion of airspace (with regard to national regulations), {{and the existence of}} a suitably equipped authority to provide the services.|$|E
40|$|Alerting {{services}} {{can provide a}} valuable support for information seeking in Digital Libraries (DL). Several systems have been proposed. Most of them have serious drawbacks, such as limited expressiveness, limited coverage, and poor support of federated and distributed collections. In this paper, we present the detailed design and implementation for a comprehensive <b>alerting</b> <b>service</b> for digital libraries. We demonstrate typical user interactions with the system. Our <b>alerting</b> <b>service</b> is open to other event sources, supports a rich variety of event types, and works on distributed {{as well as on}} federated DL collections...|$|E
40|$|Users {{of modern}} digital {{libraries}} (DLs) can keep themselves up-to-date by searching and browsing their favorite collec-tions, or more conveniently by resorting to an alerting ser-vice. The <b>alerting</b> <b>service</b> notifies its clients about new or changed documents. Proprietary and mediating alerting ser-vices fail to fluidly integrate information from differing col-lections. So far, no sophisticated {{service has been}} proposed that is integrated with the digital library software and cov-ers heterogeneous and distributed collections. This paper analyses the conceptual requirements of this much-sought after service for digital libraries. We demonstrate that the differing concepts of digital libraries and its underlying tech-nical design has extensive influence (a) the expectations, needs and interests of users regarding an <b>alerting</b> <b>service,</b> and (b) on the technical possibilities of {{the implementation of the}} service. Our findings will show that the range of is-sues surrounding alerting services for digital libraries, their design and use is greater than one may anticipate. We also show that, conversely, the requirements for an alerting ser-vice have considerable impact on the concepts of DL design. Our findings should be of interest for librarians as well as system designers. We highlight and discuss the far-reaching implications for the design of, and interaction with, libraries. This paper discusses the lessons learned from building such a distributed <b>alerting</b> <b>service.</b> We present our prototype im-plementation as a proof-of-concept for an <b>alerting</b> <b>service</b> for open DL software.

40|$|The {{classical}} {{paradigm of}} finding {{information in the}} WWW by initiating retrieval and browsing {{becomes more and more}} ineffective. Other techniques have to be considered. Automatic delivery of contents to the user according to their needs and filtered by her profile of interests is required. Current implementations of such <b>Alerting</b> <b>Services</b> at content providers side have several drawbacks. In my research project I evaluate methods and techniques for <b>Alerting</b> <b>Services</b> with special respect to the area of digital libraries. I intend to provide a framework that supports design decisions in building <b>alerting</b> <b>services</b> depending on the infrastructure and desired system parameters. 1 Introduction Imagine one morning you just arrive at your office and switch on your computer {{to have a look at}} the recent news in your special field of research.

40|$|This book {{focuses on}} the usefulnessof <b>alerting</b> <b>services</b> for LIS professionals. It is a {{valuable}} and useful resource as it {{draws attention to the}} new and existing current awareness services which can be easily retrieved for updating ones information data banks. The availability of these services does not alwaysmean that they are exploited for advancement of knowledge either by individuals or groups. This book provides a variety of definitions of current awarenessservices by severalauthors. The book is divided into seven chapters, a detailed bibliogr~phy and an alphabetical index at the end. In the introductory chapter, the author explains about the need for <b>alerting</b> <b>services</b> and reasonswhy professionals must use these services. Shedescribes how the challengesaffect the professionals in their practice and how they can monitor such challenges through <b>alerting</b> <b>services.</b> For example, she says {{that there is a need}} for information professionals to understand their own information behaviour in order for them to make use of the <b>alerting</b> <b>services</b> to improve their knowledge generation. In Chapter Two, the author explains the concepts of alerting servicesand the early development of current awareness services (CAS), and the rationale for offering these services. Chapter Three explains the relationship between the environment and the LISprofessionals in practice, aswell as LISeducators. The variety of alerting servicesavailablefor the benefit of LISprofessionalsare dealt with in the next chapter. The we...|$|R
