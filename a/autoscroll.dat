40|$|International audienceOperating {{systems support}} <b>autoscroll</b> to allow users to scroll a view while in {{dragging}} mode: the user moves the pointer near the window’s edge to trigger an “automatic” scrolling whose rate is typically {{proportional to the}} distance between the pointer and the window’s edge. This approach suffers from several problems, especially when the window is maximized, resulting in a very limited space around it. Another problem is that for some operations, such as object drag-and-drop, the source and destination might be located in different windows, making it complicated for the computer to understand user’s intention. In this paper, we present ForceEdge, a novel <b>autoscroll</b> technique relying on touch surfaces with force-sensing capabilities to alleviate the problems related to <b>autoscroll.</b> We report on the results of three controlled experiments showing that it improves over macOS and iOS systems baselines for top-to-bottom select and move tasks...|$|E
50|$|Sparksters {{gameplay}} is {{very similar}} to its precursor. The game largely functions as a 2D sidescrolling platformer, with an <b>autoscrolling</b> airship stage being the lone exception. The player is able to jump, attack with Sparksters sword, or use his rocket pack to fly.|$|R
50|$|The game is <b>autoscrolling</b> upwards. The {{player can}} choose to either shoot up or down. There are {{different}} weapons (types of magic) available, based on (naturally) the elements. Of the seven levels the game has, the player can choose {{the order of the}} first four.|$|R
50|$|Demon's World {{consists}} of several linear <b>autoscrolling</b> stages. Armed with a gun, complete with energy pack {{similar to the}} Ghostbusters, the player must shoot or jump on various ghosts and monsters that infest each area. Along the way, the player can collect a power-up to change his gun to fire lasers, bombs, or even 3-way bullets.|$|R
50|$|These {{differences}} {{also lead}} to different expectations from tool-assisted and unassisted speedruns. Taking damage when doing so does not save time and/or is not required may look sloppy in a tool-assisted run, while being hit by the occasional hard-to-avoid enemy in a relatively long unassisted speedrun would not prevent the runner from holding their world record title. After the advent of frame-advance, frame-precise movement has also come to be expected, the lack {{of which may be}} characterized as sloppy play. Another difference is in the standards of use of waiting time in the speedrun: in situations where {{it is not possible to}} make the game move faster, and the player has to wait, such as in <b>autoscrolling</b> or any other areas of a game in which the runner does not have control over the speed, the runner is advised in TASVideos guidelines to do something entertaining for the viewers. An example of this is the gathering of 99 extra lives in the <b>autoscrolling</b> sections of the famous Super Mario Bros. 3 speedrun. In unassisted runs, however, players usually would not risk dying and having to start over to entertain the viewer, although there are exceptions.|$|R
50|$|The player {{starts out}} {{controlling}} Dr. Jekyll {{on his way}} to the church, walking to the right. As he takes damage from the various enemies and obstacles, his Life Meter decreases and his Anger Meter increases. If his Life Meter is fully depleted, Dr. Jekyll dies and the game is over. If his Anger Meter completely fills, however, he transforms into Mr. Hyde. Day turns to night and monsters appear. At this point, the level is mirrored vertically and Mr. Hyde walks from right to left with the screen <b>autoscrolling.</b> Mr. Hyde must kill monsters as fast as he can in order to turn back into Dr. Jekyll, with Shepp monsters generally giving the largest refill to his Meter, though killing other monsters may refill the Meter a small amount.|$|R
