5|$|P.semilanceata {{has also}} been {{confused}} with the toxic muscarine-containing species Inocybe geophylla, a whitish mushroom with <b>a</b> <b>silky</b> cap, yellowish-brown to pale grayish gills, and a dull yellowish-brown spore print.|$|E
5|$|Hand {{specimens}} of widgiemoolthalite {{tend to be}} bluish-green though may also be grass-green in rare cases. Widgiemoolthalite is transparent in hand sample with <b>a</b> <b>silky</b> luster and a pale bluish-green streak. The mineral is brittle and breaks along its fiber contacts. Its observed specific gravity is 3.13 while its calculated specific gravity is 3.24, with a hardness of 3.5 on the Mohs scale.|$|E
5|$|The {{leaflets}} of {{the plant}} are obovate-oblong and equal-sided, and of <b>a</b> <b>silky</b> texture. The fruits (legumes) are typically one to two inches (2.5 to 5.1cm) long and contain six or seven brownish seeds. The species typically grows {{in areas where the}} soils are relatively deep, especially in semi-arid and wadi areas, and on terraces and slight inclines and hills.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{noticeable}} features {{is their}} golden liver-coloured coat which {{is unique to}} the breed. Historically however, {{there have also been}} examples of both black and sandy coloured Sussex Spaniels. The coat is thick (sometimes with a slight wave to it), feathering on the chest, legs and ears and consists of a weather-resistant undercoat with <b>a</b> <b>silky</b> outer coat. The eyes are hazel in colour. The silky ears are lobe-shaped typical of the Spaniel, and set moderately low. The Sussex is a short, stocky kind of dog.|$|E
5|$|North American red foxes, {{particularly}} those of northern Alaska, are the most valued for their fur, as they have guard hairs of <b>a</b> <b>silky</b> texture, which, after dressing, allow the wearer unrestricted mobility. Red foxes living in southern Alaska's coastal areas and the Aleutian Islands are an exception, as they have extremely coarse pelts that rarely exceed one-third {{of the price of}} their northern Alaskan cousins. Most European peltries have coarse-textured fur compared to North American varieties. The only exceptions are the Nordic and Far Eastern Russian peltries, but they are still inferior to North American peltries in terms of silkiness.|$|E
5|$|The {{leaflets}} of {{the plant}} are obovate-oblong, somewhat wedge-shaped, equal-sided, and of <b>a</b> <b>silky</b> texture. The mid-rib is usually folded longitudinally, and they are characterized by parallel transverse veins. The fruits (legumes) are typically one to two inches long (2.5 to 5.1cm) and contain six or seven brownish seeds. The plant displays purple flowers during season; they are described as their most attractive {{in the month of}} January. It typically grows to 45 – 50cm in height, and can grow on mountains with an altitude of over 3000ft. (914 m). Both diploid (22 chromosomes) and tetraploid (44 chromosomes) cytotypes have been reported.|$|E

5000|$|The Oxford English Dictionary defines Spaniel as [...] "a {{breed of}} dog with <b>a</b> long <b>silky</b> coat and {{drooping}} ears".|$|R
50|$|Their small, pointed {{ears are}} erect atop the head. Schipperkes are double {{coated with a}} soft, fluffy {{undercoat}} that is covered by a harsher-feeling and longer outer coat. One of the breed characteristics is a long ruff that surrounds the neck and then a strip trails down towards {{the rear of the}} dog. They also have longer fur on their hind legs called culottes. The breed is black, or blonde (some blondes have <b>a</b> <b>silkier</b> coat), and the coat is shiny.|$|R
5|$|Studies {{conducted}} off the Florida {{coast and}} the Bahamas {{have shown that}} silky sharks are highly sensitive to sound, in particular low-frequency (10–20Hz), irregular pulses. Experiments in which these sounds were played underwater attracted sharks from hundreds of meters away. Silky sharks likely orient to these sounds because they {{are similar to the}} noise generated by feeding animals such as birds or dolphins, thus indicating promising sources of food. These studies have also demonstrated that <b>a</b> <b>silky</b> shark attracted by one sound will quickly withdraw if that sound abruptly changes in amplitude or character; this change need not be a sound produced by a predator to evoke the reaction. Over repeated exposures, silky sharks habituate to the sound change and stop withdrawing, though it takes them much longer to do so compared to the bolder oceanic whitetip shark.|$|E
25|$|More {{significant}} {{characteristics of}} S. nudiseta are its large and predacious larvae which can easily consume C. rufiffacies. Spiracular buttons {{are present in}} the premature third instar. The anterior spiracles contain five to seven papillae each. The puparia are enclosed in <b>a</b> <b>silky</b> white substance for protection.|$|E
25|$|Master of Wine Clive Coates {{describes}} the wines having rich flavours of chocolate, black cherries and mocha with <b>a</b> <b>silky</b> smooth mouthfeel. Younger examples {{will have a}} fresh raspberry flavour typical of Grenache. In regards to food and wine pairing, Coates notes that Maury {{are one of the}} rare wines that pair well with chocolate desserts.|$|E
5000|$|... Lyocell is more {{expensive}} to produce than cotton or viscose rayon. It is used in many everyday fabrics. Staple fibres are used in clothes such as denim, chino, underwear, casual wear, and towels. Filament fibres are used in items that have <b>a</b> <b>silkier</b> appearance such as women’s clothing and men’s dress shirts. Lyocell can be blended {{with a variety of}} other fibres such as silk, cotton, rayon, polyester, linen, nylon, and wool. Lyocell is also used in conveyor belts, specialty papers, and medical dressings.|$|R

25|$|There are {{two main}} forms of vesicles. Most pumice {{contains}} tubular microvesicles that can impart <b>a</b> <b>silky</b> or fibrous fabric. The elongation of the microvesicles occurs due to ductile elongation in the volcanic conduit or, {{in the case of}} pumiceous lavas, during flow. The other form of vesicles are subspherical to spherical and result from high vapor pressure during eruption.|$|E
25|$|The Vanessa indica is not {{reported}} as a pest on any crop but on ramie it causes considerable damage by feeding on young tender leaves which affect {{the growth of}} the plant. The larvae of this insect feed on tender young leaves as shown in the picture. The adults lay the eggs on tender leaves in which larvae emerge and feeds on young tender leaves preferably at neck region of the leaves, due to this leaves look like the hanging like position and latter get dry. The caterpillar feeds on young leaves and later fold the leaves {{in such a way that}} both the margins are attached by <b>a</b> <b>silky</b> web and pupation takes place inside the folded leaf. Later the adult emerges as a butterfly.|$|E
25|$|The larvae of {{this species}} are notorious tent {{caterpillars}}. Tent caterpillars do not make tents, but rather, weave <b>a</b> <b>silky</b> sheet where they lie together during molting. They lay down strands of silk as they move over branches and then travel along them like tightrope walkers. They follow pheromones secreted by other larvae rather than following the silk lines themselves. The caterpillars are social, traveling together to feed. The caterpillars live in deciduous trees, which they strip off leaves after emerging from their eggs. The adult moth {{of this species}} favors oak, sweetgum, tupelo, aspen, and sugar maple for oviposition, but the larvae can be found feeding on many other species of woody trees or shrubs. The females lay eggs in masses of up to 300, which are stuck to twigs {{and covered with a}} gluey cement called spumaline, which prevents them from desiccating and freezing. The eggs hatch the following winter.|$|E

500|$|Historically the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel was a lap dog and {{is small}} for a spaniel, with fully grown adults {{comparable}} {{in size to}} adolescents of other larger spaniel breeds. Breed standards state that height of a Cavalier should be between [...] with a proportionate weight between [...] The tail is usually not docked, and the Cavalier should have <b>a</b> <b>silky</b> coat of moderate length. Standards state {{that it should be}} free from curl, although a slight wave is allowed. Feathering can grow on their ears, feet, legs and tail in adulthood. Standards require this be kept long, with the feathering on the feet a particularly important aspect of the breed's features.|$|E
500|$|Journalists {{employed}} many superlatives {{to describe}} the Kippax style. Ray Robinson thought that Kippax's batting [...] "had <b>a</b> <b>silky</b> quality not seen in any other player of his time or since"; he captivated the crowds with his late cut when he, [...] "made a lissom bow over the ball and stroked it away with the bat's face downward, as if to squeeze {{the ball into the}} ground". His favourite hook shot propelled the ball [...] "with such unhurried ease that the punishing power of the stroke was revealed only in the way the ball smacked against the fence." [...] Donald Bradman believed him to be the best exponent of the hook shot in the game.|$|E
500|$|The Maine Coon is a {{large and}} sociable cat, hence its nickname, [...] "the gentle giant." [...] It is {{characterized}} by a prominent ruff along its chest, robust bone structure, triangular body shape, an uneven two layered coat with longer guard hairs with <b>a</b> <b>silky</b> satin under layer undercoat, and a long, bushy tail. [...] The breed's colors vary widely, with only lilac and chocolate disallowed for pedigree. [...] Reputed for its intelligence and playful, gentle personality, the Maine Coon is often cited as having [...] "dog-like" [...] characteristics. Professionals notice certain health problems in the breed including feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and hip dysplasia, but reputable breeders use modern screening methods to minimize the frequency of these problems.|$|E
