5|$|In 1916, Brown {{expanded}} the character set {{to include more}} features; in the revised version: a comparatively short skull with a high helmet-like crest formed by nasals, prefrontals and frontals; the nasals not being separated in front by premaxillaries; a narrow beak, expanded section {{in front of the}} elongated nares; a small narial opening; a vertebral formula of 15 cervicals, 19 dorsals, 8 sacrals, and 61+ caudals; possession of dorsal spines of a medium height; high anterior caudal spines; long chevrons; long scapulae, possessing <b>a</b> <b>blade</b> <b>of</b> medium width; a radius considerably longer than humerus; comparatively short metacarpals; an anteriorly decurved ilium; a long ischium with a foot-like terminal expansion; a pubis with an anterior blade that is short and broadly expanded at end; a femur that is longer than the tibia; the phalanges of pes are short; that the integument over the sides and tail composed of polygonal tuberculate scales without pattern but graded in size {{in different parts of the}} body; and a belly with longitudinal rows of large conical limpet-like scales separated by uniformly large polygonal tubercles. Again, the presumed traits of the snout are incorrect because Brown confused the praemaxillae with the nasal bones and the nasal bones with the frontals. Most of the postcranial traits are today known to be shared with other lambeosaurines.|$|E
5|$|The game {{opens with}} {{a vision of the}} player's {{character}} wielding <b>a</b> <b>blade</b> <b>of</b> light to strike down a masked man in black robes. The vision is a dream the player has while on a carriage ride to their chosen starting city—Gridania, Ul'dah, or Limsa Lominsa. Players returning from the original release appear in a forest in a pillar of light—Louisoix's final spell to save their lives from the devastation at Carteneau. Through undertaking various odd jobs, the player character ingratiates him or herself with the local Adventurer's Guild and earns comparisons with the fabled Warriors of Light, brave adventurers who participated in the Battle of Carteneau whose identities have been mysteriously erased from the memories of all who knew them. A pattern emerges amid these quests involving a series of attacks by masked men, as well {{as a member of the}} Scions of the Seventh Dawn who claims to know the origin of the player's visions. The adventurer meets the leader of this secret society, Minfilia, who reveals that the visions are a manifestation of the Echo and mark the player as a chosen representative of Hydaelyn, the Mothercrystal.|$|E
5|$|When sailing {{the western}} side of Spitzbergen, <b>a</b> <b>blade</b> <b>of</b> the {{propeller}} of the Island was damaged in a collision with an ice floe. When the engine was run, severe vibration was felt and this forced Worsley to continue northwards under sail, searching for Gillis Land until the ship reached the pack ice. While doing so, soundings were taken which confirmed the presence of a submarine plain between Spitzbergen and the island group of Franz Josef Land. Turning south and sailing along the northern coast of Spitzbergen, a previously uncharted harbour was found, which Algarsson named after Worsley. The ship then sailed north, still seeking Gillis Land, but became trapped in the ice. Worsley took the opportunity to create an ice dock to facilitate repairs to the rudder, which had become damaged. After two weeks beset in the ice, he used the engine to break free but the last blade of the propeller was lost in the process.|$|E

5|$|Returning to the Waking Sands, {{the heroes}} {{discover}} a few Scions who escaped the attack, {{as well as}} the location of their abducted comrades. They mount a rescue mission to the Garlean Castrum Centri, stealing uniforms and a magitek reaper for disguise. Minfilia and the others are retrieved but they also learn that Lahabrea had possessed Thancred during the course of his investigation into the Ascian threat. Minfilia and Alphinaud barge into a meeting between the three Grand Company leaders who had been considering surrender in the face of Ultima Weapon's power and convince them to fight against Garlean oppression. Using the combined forces of all three nations as well as other allied groups, the Eorzean Alliance executes Operation Archon—a massive counteroffensive that aims to assault every Garlean Castrum simultaneously. The player leads a strike team into the Praetorium where the Ultima Weapon is housed. Using Hydaelyn's blessing of light, the adventurer strips Ultima Weapon of its primal aether. The weapon destroys the Praetorium using Ultima magic but the player's team is protected by Hydaelyn's light and dismantles it. Lahabrea attacks personally but the player fulfills the vision {{at the beginning of his}} or her adventure by striking Thancred free from Lahabrea's possession using <b>a</b> <b>blade</b> <b>of</b> light. With the threat of Garlean invasion lifted, the Grand Company leaders declare the beginning of the Seventh Astral Era. The player's character is hailed as a hero of the same caliber as the Warriors of Light.|$|E

40|$|Two 3 -blade 10 -foot {{propellers}} were {{operated in}} front of a liquid-cooled engine nacelle. The propellers differed only in pitch distribution; one had normal distribution (nearly constant pitch for <b>a</b> <b>blade</b> angle <b>of</b> 15 degrees at 0. 75 radius), and the other had the pitch of the tip sections decreased with respect to that for the shank sections (<b>blade</b> angle <b>of</b> 35 degrees for nearly constant pitch distribution). Propeller blade angles at 0. 75 r from 15 degrees to sixty degrees, corresponding to design speeds up to 500 miles per hour, were investigated. Propeller blade angles at 0. 75 r from 15 degrees to 60 degrees, corresponding to design speeds up to 500 miles per hour, were investigated. The results indicated that the propulsive efficiency at <b>a</b> <b>blade</b> angle <b>of</b> 60 degrees was about 9 percent less than the maximum value of 86 percent, which occurred at <b>blade</b> angle <b>of</b> about 30 degrees. The efficiency at <b>a</b> <b>blade</b> angle <b>of</b> 60 degrees was increased about 7 percent by correcting for the effect of a spinner and, at <b>a</b> <b>blade</b> angle <b>of</b> 30 degrees about 3 percent. The peak efficiencies for the propeller having the washed-out pitch distribution were slightly less than for the normal propeller but the take-off efficiency was generally higher...|$|R

25|$|There are {{legends of}} him (Khidr) in which, like Osiris, he is dismembered and reborn; and prophecies {{connecting}} him, like the Green Man, {{with the end}} of time. His name means the Green One or Verdant One, he is the voice of inspiration to the aspirant and committed artist. He can come as a white light or the gleam on <b>a</b> <b>blade</b> <b>of</b> grass, but more often as an inner mood. The sign of his presence is the ability to work or experience with tireless enthusiasm beyond one's normal capacities. In this there may be a link across cultures, …one reason for the enthusiasm of the medieval sculptors for the Green Man may be that he was the source of every inspiration.|$|E
500|$|The jewelled Sword of Offering, made in 1820, has a gilded leather sheath, <b>a</b> <b>blade</b> <b>of</b> Damascus steel, and is {{encrusted with}} 3,476 {{precious}} stones. GeorgeIV paid almost £6,000 for the sword {{out of his}} own pocket. It remained in personal ownership until 1903 when it was deposited with the Crown Jewels. A monarch is either girded or presented with the sword as the Archbishop says: [...] "With this sword do justice, stop the growth of iniquity, protect the Holy Church of God, help and defend widows and orphans, restore the things that are gone to decay, maintain the things that are restored, punish and reform what is amiss, and confirm what is in good order". Afterwards, it is returned to the Keeper of the Jewel House by the abbey in exchange for a token sum of £5, and the sword is borne unsheathed {{for the rest of the}} ceremony.|$|E

500|$|A large grasshopper, {{such as a}} locust, {{can jump}} about a metre (twenty body lengths) without using its wings; the {{acceleration}} peaks at about 20g. Grasshoppers jump by extending their large back legs and pushing against the substrate (the ground, a twig, <b>a</b> <b>blade</b> <b>of</b> grass or whatever else they are standing on); the reaction force propels them into the air. They jump for several reasons; to escape from a predator, to launch themselves into flight, or simply to move from place to place. For the escape jump in particular there is strong selective pressure to maximize take-off velocity, since this determines the range. This means that the legs must thrust against the ground with both high force and a high velocity of movement. [...] However, a fundamental property of muscle is that it cannot contract with both high force and high velocity at the same time. Grasshoppers overcome this apparent contradiction by using a catapult mechanism to amplify the mechanical power produced by their muscles.|$|E
500|$|Asher told Barbara Avedon {{about the}} {{students}}' script, {{saying that it}} only needed a little reworking, and he asked if she would help the students with the rewrite. Avedon, who had written for The Donna Reed Show and been a regular writer for Bewitched, accepted his request. Avedon visited Jefferson High School and later said of the experience, [...] "I was horrified. Locker doors were hanging off their hinges. There wasn't <b>a</b> <b>blade</b> <b>of</b> grass in sight." [...] Avedon expressed amazement over the script the students produced and helped them revise it and expand its length so it would sustain a full half-hour episode. She promised the students that no changes would {{be made to the}} script unless they approved. It was because of her recommendation that the story was reformulated as a Christmas episode, which she suggested because the script [...] "was so imbued with the spirit." [...] She said that one of the students indicated a desire to write for Bewitched because the series deals with miscegenation by way of a marriage between a witch and a mortal. [...] The final script credited the teleplay to Avedon and Asher, and the story to all 26 students, who were listed on screen in alphabetical order.|$|E

2500|$|A {{worrying}} risk {{must have}} been the chance of a momentary [...] "chance synchronization", with the propeller revolving for a second or two at precisely the same rate as the gun fired (or, say, exactly twice or three times as fast).

2500|$|Seismic {{communication}} is {{the exchange of}} information using self-generated vibrational signals transmitted via a substrate such as the soil, water, spider webs, plant stems, or <b>a</b> <b>blade</b> <b>of</b> grass.
