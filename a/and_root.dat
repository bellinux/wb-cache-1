40|$|Abstract. This {{study was}} aimed at obtaining {{detailed}} information about the interaction of NaCl salinity and elevated atmospheric CO 2 concentration in the halophyte S. salsa, which was irrigated with five different salinity levels under ambient and elevated (530 ppm) CO 2. The results show that total soluble sugar concentration was significantly increased by salt-treatments in both leaves <b>and</b> <b>roots,</b> <b>and</b> that the most progressive sugar increments were observed in leaves <b>and</b> <b>roots</b> of S. salsa under the elevated CO 2. The Na concentration in the leaves <b>and</b> <b>roots</b> increased with the increased NaCl concentration, the K accumulation gradually decreaed by increasing salinity levels in leaves <b>and</b> <b>roots.</b> Proline increased in response to salt stress along with incremental NaCl concentration. The GB concentrations of leaves were significantly raised as NaCl levels increased. Electrolyte leakage increased in the leaves of S. salsa grown under NaCl stress. ψs of leaves <b>and</b> <b>roots</b> decreased as the NaCl concentration increase, and that elevated CO 2 both had markedly greater effects on ψs of leaves <b>and</b> <b>roots.</b> The osmotic adjustment values ascended with elevated CO 2 concentration in both leaves <b>and</b> <b>roots...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{study of}} {{phenolic}} compounds profiles and antioxidative activity in ginseng fruit, leaves, <b>and</b> <b>roots</b> {{with respect to}} cultivation years, and has been little reported to date. Hence, {{this study examined the}} phenolic compounds profiles and 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free-radical-scavenging activities in the fruit, leaves, <b>and</b> <b>roots</b> of Korean ginseng (Panax ginseng Meyer) as a function of cultivation year. Methods: Profiling of 23 phenolic compounds in ginseng fruit, leaves, <b>and</b> <b>roots</b> was investigated using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with the external calibration method. Antioxidative activity of ginseng fruit, leaves, <b>and</b> <b>roots</b> were evaluated using the method of DPPH free-radical-scavenging activity. Results: The total phenol content in ginseng fruit and leaves was higher than in ginseng roots (p< 0. 05), and the phenol content in the ginseng samples was significantly correlated to the DPPH free-radical-scavenging activity (r= 0. 928 ****). In particular, p-coumaric acid (r= 0. 847 ****) and ferulic acid (r= 0. 742 ****) greatly affected the DPPH activity. Among the 23 phenolic compounds studied, phenolic acids were more abundant in ginseng fruit, leaves, <b>and</b> <b>roots</b> than the flavonoids and other compounds (p< 0. 05). In particular, chlorogenic acid, gentisic acid, p- and m-coumaric acid, and rutin were the major phenolic compounds in 3 – 6 -yr-old ginseng fruit, leaves, <b>and</b> <b>roots.</b> Conclusion: This study provides basic information about the antioxidative activity and phenolic compounds profiles in fruit, leaves, <b>and</b> <b>roots</b> of Korean ginseng with cultivation years.
