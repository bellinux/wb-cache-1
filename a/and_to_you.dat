25|$|The second {{so-called}} sura, entitled al-Hafd (haste) {{translates as}} follows: 'O Allah, we worship You <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>You</b> we pray and prostrate <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>You</b> we run and hasten to serve You. We hope for Your mercy and we fear Your punishment. Your punishment will certainly reach the disbelievers.' Obviously these two pieces constitute so-called 'qunut', i.e. supplications which Muhammad sometimes {{said in the}} morning prayer or witr prayer after recitation of suras from the Quran. They are in fact identical to some parts of qunut reported in the collections of hadith. See: Nawawi, al-adhkar, Cairo, 1955, pp.57–8.|$|E

2500|$|Besides painting, Yeats had a {{significant}} interest in theatre and in literature. He {{was a close friend}} of Samuel Beckett. He designed sets for the Abbey Theatre, and three of his own plays were also produced there. He wrote novels in a stream of consciousness style that Joyce acknowledged, and also many essays. [...] His literary works include The Careless Flower, The Amaranthers (much admired by Beckett), Ah Well, A Romance in Perpetuity, <b>And</b> <b>To</b> <b>You</b> Also, and The Charmed Life. [...] Yeats's paintings usually bear poetic and evocative titles. Indeed, his father recognized that Jack was a far better painter than he, and also believed that 'some day I will be remembered as the father of a great poet, and the poet is Jack'. He was elected a member of the Royal Hibernian Academy in 1916. [...] He died in Dublin in 1957, and was buried in Mount Jerome Cemetery.|$|E
2500|$|Stilwell appealed {{directly}} to President Roosevelt {{for help with}} his dispute with Chiang, and as a result, Roosevelt sent Chiang a message which read: [...] "I have urged time and again in recent months that you take drastic action to resist the disaster which has been moving closer to China <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> Now, when you have not yet placed General Stilwell in command of all forces in China, {{we are faced with}} the loss of a critical area... with possible catastrophic consequences". Roosevelt ended his ultimatum to Chiang with the threat to end all American aid unless Chiang [...] "at once" [...] place Stilwell [...] "in unrestricted command of all your forces." [...] General Chennault later claimed that Stilwell had deliberately ordered Sino-American forces out of Guilin as a way of creating a crisis that would force Chiang to give up command of his armies to Stilwell. Stilwell's diary supports Chennault's claim as Stilwell wrote that if a crisis emerged that was [...] "just sufficient {{to get rid of the}} Peanut without entirely wrecking the ship, it would be worth it", going on to write that the entire Kuomintang system had to be [...] "torn to bits" [...] and Chiang would just have to go.|$|E
