500|$|Fuller and Form {{likened the}} new Nightmare film to their 2003 remake of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, and {{retracted}} an earlier statement {{when they said}} they did not plan to [...] "cherry pick" [...] the best elements of the franchise, like they did with the reboot of the Friday the 13th franchise they released in 2009. Instead, the 2010 film is more of a reimagining. The pair also explained that A Nightmare on Elm Street would have a different tone than the Friday the 13th remake. Form states, [...] "I think a Friday the 13th movie like we made was really fun. You know, sex, drugs and rock and roll, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> Nightmare movie is not that." ...|$|E
500|$|It was {{the first}} Once Upon a Time episode to be written by {{consulting}} producer Jane Espenson, while being directed by Paul Edwards. Espenson was [...] "thrilled" [...] to be assigned the episode; Jiminy Cricket was typically a character that appeared in other people's stories, so she was eager to explore him in his own narrative. Espenson especially wanted to depict how some, like Jiminy in this episode, [...] "have their adolescence well after adolescence. It took Jiminy {{a long time to}} figure out how to get away from the life he was living, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> lot of people feel like that." [...] In addition, the episode contained several cultural references to the television series Lost and the Disney film One Hundred and One Dalmatians.|$|E
500|$|After the 2001 NPC, Crusaders' captain Todd Blackadder left New Zealand to play rugby in Scotland. During the 2002 Super 12 pre-season, half-back Justin Marshall {{questioned}} {{which of}} the senior players were going to step into Blackadder's leadership role for the tough matches. Hammett took the comment [...] "as {{a slap in the}} face", as [...] "one player doesn't make a team." [...] Hammett later said [...] "I took it that way, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> lot of the others must have as well, because we all ended up stepping up!" [...] Subsequently, the Crusaders went through the season unbeaten, including a 96–19 victory over the New South Wales Waratahs. He again played for the All Blacks in 2002, starting against Australia and South Africa in the Tri-Nations. The 2002 NPC season was Hammett's last, and although Canterbury were knocked out in their semi-final, they managed to retain the Ranfurly Shield. Hammett's last match was his 76th for Canterbury.|$|E

The {{people will}} pay no {{internal}} tax; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>an</b> act to oblige the assemblies to make compensation is unnecessary; for I am of opinion that, {{as soon as}} the present heats are abated, they will take the matter into consideration, and, if it is right to be done, they will do it themselves.|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, {{the balance}} of {{northern}} troops encountered greater difficulty traversing Pratt Street. Obstructions {{were placed on the}} tracks by the crowd and some cars were forced back toward the President Street station. The soldiers attempted to march the distance along Pratt Street, and according to Mayor Brown were met with “shouts <b>and</b> stones, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>an</b> occasional pistol shot.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Two German {{independent}} scientific {{groups have}} failed to replicate the PEAR results. Pigliucci has written this was [...] "yet another indication that the simplest hypothesis {{is likely to be}} true: there was nothing to replicate." [...] The physicist Milton Rothman wrote that most of the faculty at Princeton considered the work of PEAR an embarrassment. Robert L. Park said of PEAR, [...] "It’s been an embarrassment to science, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>an</b> embarrassment for Princeton".|$|R
500|$|In 1983 and 1984, Crass {{were part}} of the Stop the City actions co-ordinated by London Greenpeace which foreshadowed the {{anti-globalisation}} rallies of the early 21st century. Support for these activities was provided in the lyrics and sleeve notes of the band's last single, [...] "You're Already Dead", expressing doubts about their commitment to non-violence. It was also a reflection of disagreements within the group, as explained by Rimbaud; [...] "Half the band supported the pacifist line and half supported direct and if necessary violent action. It was a confusing time for us, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> lot of our records show that, inadvertently". This led to introspection within the band, with some members becoming embittered and losing sight of their essentially positive stance. Reflecting this debate, the next release under the Crass name was Acts of Love: classical-music settings of 50 poems by Penny Rimbaud, described as [...] "songs to my other self" [...] and intended to celebrate [...] "the profound sense of unity, peace and love that exists within that other self".|$|E
500|$|The Eiland-Hall {{response}} brief cited {{a clip of}} Beck interviewing United States Congressman Keith Ellison, a Muslim from Minnesota. Beck had stated to U.S. Representative Ellison, [...] "No {{offense and}} I know Muslims, I like Muslims, I've been to mosques, I really don't think Islam is a religion of evil. I think it's being hijacked, quite frankly. With that being said, you are a Democrat. You are saying let's cut and run. And I have to tell you, I have been nervous about this interview because what I feel like saying is, sir, {{prove to me that}} you are not working with our enemies. And I know you’re not. I’m not accusing you of being an enemy. But that’s the way I feel, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> lot of Americans will feel that way." [...] It was argued that this was an example of Beck's interview style in which he challenged his guests to prove a negative. Randazza concluded Beck's rhetorical style was similar to Gottfried's, simply devoid of comedic intent.|$|E
500|$|There was {{a strong}} {{reaction}} from the show's viewers. Adler said, [...] "I've heard {{from a lot of}} fans how important this character is for them because it's important to watch the internal struggle, the confusion and the torture one person can put themselves through being closeted." [...] He wants Karofsky to [...] "accept himself and come out because [...] it would be a beacon of hope for everyone else who's struggling", and noted, [...] "people do get hope from Glee." [...] He also said, [...] "I think [...] trusts me to do what I'm doing with the character, which is one heck of a compliment from him." [...] Murphy has indicated a preference for positive future developments, and said in early January 2011, [...] "This show is by nature optimistic <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> character like Karofsky could turn to booze or pills or alcohol and kill themselves or do something dark. But I also love Max and I love that character and I sorta want that character to have a happy ending." [...] At one point in the bullying storyline, Karofsky threatens to kill Kurt, a scene that Adler characterized as [...] "very powerful. Chilling, terrifying, horrifying, yet, at the same time, heartbreaking. … Because there are kids who have messaged me since that episode saying they used to hear that line spoken to them {{day in and day out}} at school", and they dreaded school because of it.|$|E

5000|$|Wilson cleared {{speculation}} by updating The Special Goodness website on July 12, 2006, {{stating that}} [...] "3 songs {{and more on}} the way" [...] and on August 13, 2006 stating [...] "Ideally, I'd like to release something in the spring but I will sell no wine before its time." [...] On February 15, 2007, Wilson posted on the site [...] "Lots of new songs have been written <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>an</b> album will be released this year." ...|$|R

500|$|Mays has deemed Emma an [...] "amazing" [...] {{character}} to play, and has explained: [...] "I don't find that female characters are always written {{with a lot}} of depth, but she's so well defined on the page. Sure, she's terrified of germs and in love with a married man, so seeing her as the voice of reason for the kids is amazing." [...] Emma's relationship with Will will continue to grow, as [...] "she has these moments of clarity when she's talking to Will because he calms her." [...] Mays described her in an interview with TheTVChick: [...] "She is a romantic at heart. But she’s practical. She’s very interesting, because she does have those dreams and hopes of finding the right man. And in her mind, even though Will Schuester’s married, that sort of guy is like the perfect guy for her. She’s very practical in the fact that she doesn’t want to be alone and she knows that she’s somewhat limited in a small town to men. And Ken Tanaka is a very nice man, he’s not exactly like Will, but he’s good to her and he’s solid. He’s got a job, and he understands her and he understands all her quirks and stuff. So she’s practical, she knows that just might be her lot in life. So it’s weird. She’s got this very dreamy side about her and who she wants to be and what she wants her life to be like. But she’s also got this very practical, down-to-earth, well this is kind of the best I can do thing. It’s funny {{a lot of people have}} thought that part about her is weak. Like a weak character flaw, but I actually don’t think that’s true. I really just think that’s the practical side of her. I think that’s her being practical. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> lot of people are like that sometimes." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{remember}} really vividly, you know, having {{pizza with}} my friends {{a day or two}} after—I opened up the first version of Facebook at the time I thought, [...] "You know, someone needs to build a service like this for the world." [...] But I just never thought that we'd be the ones to help do it. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> lot of {{what it comes down to}} is we just cared more.|$|E
2500|$|On November 14, 2006, Glenn Beck of CNN Headline News said to Ellison, [...] "I {{have been}} nervous about this {{interview}} with you, because what I feel like saying is, 'Sir, prove {{to me that}} you are not working with our enemies.' And I know you're not. I'm not accusing you of being an enemy, but that's the way I feel, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> lot of Americans will feel that way." [...] Ellison replied that his constituents, [...] "know that I have a deep love and affection for my country. There's no one who's more patriotic than I am, and so you know, I don't need to — need to prove my patriotic stripes." ...|$|E

[...] In {{an interview with}} C-SPAN in 1987 Cockburn was questioned by a caller on this statement and he explained that [...] "it {{was a part of}} a satirical piece which was tasteless." [...] He went on to say [...] "I would ask you {{to look at some of}} the Mujahideen and how they treat women. They have virtual slavery of women. They are in favour of the bride price. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> lot of people don't have a slightest of idea of social conditions in Afghanistan." [...] When asked about the same article on Afghanistan in 1995, Cockburn stated [...] "I shouldn't have ...|$|E
2500|$|A week later, on 5 November 2008, UK {{television}} channel Five broadcast a 1-hour {{documentary on the}} incident, titled Russell & Ross: What the F*** Was All That About? featuring {{an exclusive interview with}} Baillie. Baillie stated in the interview that [...] "I think it's way out of proportion what's happened and I don't hate either of them – I don't at all", going on to say [...] "I think they're really talented comedians <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> world without Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand would be a very sad, dull place." [...] She concluded by saying that Brand needed to learn about respecting women, while Ross should just think before he speaks, [...] "I don't have any harder feeling than that." [...] Baillie also made clear that she would not object to the reinstatement of both Brand and Ross.|$|E
2500|$|On July 5, 2009, Colin Powell told CNN {{said that}} the policy was [...] "correct for the time" [...] but that [...] "sixteen years have now gone by, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> lot has changed with respect to attitudes within our country, and {{therefore}} I {{think this is a}} policy and a law that should be reviewed." [...] Interviewed for the same broadcast, Mullen said the policy would continue to be implemented until the law was repealed, and that his advice was to [...] "move in a measured way.... At a time when we're fighting two conflicts {{there is a great deal}} of pressure on our forces and their families." [...] In September, Joint Force Quarterly published an article by an Air Force colonel that disputed the argument that unit cohesion is compromised by the presence of openly gay personnel.|$|E

[...] Statistical flaws in his work have been proposed by others in the parapsychological community and within the general scientific community. The physicist Robert L.

2500|$|Lynch {{has said}} that he is [...] "not a {{political}} person". However, he has expressed admiration for former US President Ronald Reagan. Describing his political philosophy, he stated, [...] "at that time, I thought of myself as a libertarian. I believed in next to zero government. And I still would lean toward no government and not so many rules, except for traffic lights and things like this. I really believe in traffic regulations." [...] Lynch continued to state that [...] "I don't know if there even is a Libertarian party. They wouldn't have a prayer of getting anywhere. So I'm a Democrat now. And I've always been a Democrat, really. But I don't like the Democrats a lot, either, because I'm a smoker, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> lot of the Democrats have come up with these rules for non-smoking." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the topic}} of Sheila and Lauren's [...] "cat fights", Brown said: [...] "People like cat fights because we {{can get away with}} what you can't get away with in {{everyday}} life. You're living vicariously through me. There might be someone that [...] you just might want to put it to someday, and you can't, but you can turn on the TV and see Sheila do it, and get away with it. Being mean and evil and fighting {{and by the end of}} the day, you're spent." [...] On {{the topic of}} Sheila [...] "terrorizing" [...] both Genoa City and Los Angeles while on both soaps, Brown said: [...] "You know, I came to L.A. to start a new life. And well they just didn't make it that easy for me, did they? So I might've shot a gun once or twice again, but it wasn't my fault. You know what, people get what they deserve, they really do. I might've poisoned someone by accident, but he never should've talked to me like that. You just don't do that. Anyway, people get what they deserve, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>a</b> lot of them have what's coming to them, and I'm not sure I'm done yet." [...] About Sheila's personality, Brown said: [...] "Sheila's just evil. There's nothing bitchy about what she does, [...] it's very straightforward. She's manipulative but never in a bitchy way, in a way to get things accomplished, and get things done the way she wants to. When being nice and being diplomatic and when being all those things don't work any longer, she snaps." [...] On Sheila's relationship with Stephanie Forrester, Brown said: [...] "Stephanie made my life miserable. So anyway, I shot Stephanie. I did. Stephanie felt she could be a better provider for my child than I could. And you know what, you don't keep a mother like Sheila away from her child, you just don't do that.
