5|$|A {{total of}} 26 Lancasters were armed with Tallboys and the {{remainder}} with JW mines. The Film Unit Lancaster also flew out of Bardney carrying three RAF cameramen {{as well as an}} Associated Press journalist and a radio reporter from the BBC. The Liberators departed Bardney just before the bombers, carrying McMullen, maintenance personnel and spare parts. The No. 540 Squadron Mosquito left Bardney the next day. Despite not being notified of the new plan until <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the Lancasters were airborne, the Soviet military quickly agreed to the changed arrangements.|$|E

Senator Ellen Nadeer, {{the leader of the}} Humans First political movement, later speaks out against S.H.I.E.L.D. She then receives a report from the Watchdogs, whom she is working with, while her brother is trapped within an Inhuman Terrigen cocoon.|$|E
5|$|For part of 31 October, Derrick assumed {{command of}} his company <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the unit's {{officers}} had been killed or wounded in fierce fighting. On 21 November 1942, Derrick was briefly admitted to the 2/3rd Australian Field Ambulance with slight shrapnel wounds to {{his right hand and}} buttock. Twelve days later, the 2/48th Battalion left El Alamein and returned to Gaza in Palestine, where, later that month, Derrick attended a corps patrolling course. In January 1943, the 2/48th Battalion sailed home to Australia, aboard the S.S. Nieuw Amsterdam, {{along with the rest of}} the 9th Division.|$|E
5|$|The {{preservation}} of Gibraltar's fortifications, {{and of its}} architectural heritage in general, has been a problematic issue. The peninsula is extremely short of land; in the early 1980s, nearly half the available land was in military usage, comprising the naval dockyard, {{the whole of the}} southern part of Gibraltar, {{the upper part of the}} Rock and a significant amount of property within the city walls, in addition to the runway and military facilities on the isthmus. Until recently, Gibraltar had no public sea front of its own due to military land usage. As the military presence has been run down, MOD property has been handed over to the Government of Gibraltar but the latter has lacked the resources to look <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the buildings and land that have been transferred. This has led to the abandonment and severe physical deterioration of significant parts of Gibraltar's military heritage.|$|E

5|$|Six {{teams from}} North America and six teams {{representing}} {{the rest of}} the World play a series of games against each other in order to win points. The first side to win a majority of the points available wins the cup. Teams compete in four formats: team games, mixed doubles games, singles competitions, and skins games. Team games are regular curling games, with two teams of four playing against each other. Mixed doubles games involve two teams, each consisting of one male and one female, playing against each other. Mixed doubles teams use only six stones per end, one of which is positioned {{prior to the start of}} the end. This is in contrast to the eight stones per end used by teams of four in regular curling games. The singles competition involves two teams playing against each other. There are six types of shots contested in the singles competitions. Each curler from each team is assigned to throw at least one type of shot. Points are given based on how well the shot is made. <b>After</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the shots have been thrown, the team with the most points wins the competition. Skins games involve two teams playing against each other, where the objective is to win skins by scoring two or more points with the hammer or stealing points without the hammer. The points for the skins games, which go toward the total points for the cup, are distributed throughout the game, and the teams earn these points by winning skins.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the spring}} of 1918, the 18th Battalion was {{involved}} in operations to repel the German offensive. Maxwell took part in these actions until he was granted leave {{and went back to}} England on 17 July. He returned to France and rejoined the 18th Battalion on 1 August, before taking part in the Battle of Amiens where he was to earn a Bar to his Military Cross. On 9 August, the battalion was preparing to attack near Rainecourt. Maxwell took command of the company <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> its other officers became casualties. Under his leadership, the company was able to attack on time, despite being subjected to heavy fire. A tank that preceded the advance immediately became the object of enemy fire and was knocked out by a 77mm gun. Maxwell, who was in close proximity, rushed over and opened the hatch, allowing the crew to escape. After escorting the tank commander to safety, Maxwell returned to lead the company in the attack, which succeeded in reaching and consolidating their objective. The award of the bar was published in a supplement to the London Gazette on 1 February 1919.|$|E

Its formation extended the 2005 season's record for tropical storms to twenty-four, which was exceeded four more times and ended at twenty-eight storms after the formation of Tropical Storm Zeta and the post-season addition of an unnamed storm from October.|$|E
25|$|By this time, {{only the}} railway bridge {{remained}} intact. The Germans {{felt that it}} could be a very useful crossing point for tanks, and only 35 Dutch soldiers defended it. As the Germans advanced to the bridge, they were briefly held off by the Dutch defenders. A few German soldiers were killed. However, the Dutch soon fell back because of overwhelming numbers. As the Germans began to cross the bridge, the charges were planted and the bridge fell into the river. <b>After</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the bridges over the Maas River were destroyed, the only task that remained was to hold off the Germans as long as they could.|$|E
25|$|Majstorović did {{not play}} many more games in Germany, where {{in his second year}} he made just seven, scoring one goal.

The following year was only a midfield place <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the qualifications for the new single-track second division meant.

At 18:28, the Dublin-Belfast train was stopped at Dundalk and searched {{by a team of}} 18 Gardaí led by an inspector.

25|$|In 2008, the U.S. version {{changed its}} format so that contestants were {{required}} to answer questions within a set time limit. The time limits were 15 seconds for questions 1–5, 30 seconds for questions 6-10, and 45 seconds for questions 11-14. After each of the 14 questions were answered correctly, the remaining time after giving an answer was banked for the million-dollar question. The clock for each question began counting down immediately <b>after</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> the question was revealed, and was temporarily paused when a lifeline was used. Contestants who exceeded the time limit were forced to walk away with any prize money they had won up to that point. The clock was later adopted by other international versions; for example, the British version adopted it on 3 August 2010, and the Indian version adopted it on 11 October the same year.|$|E

Birney was ordered to demonstrate against New Market Heights while the II Corps divisions attempted to turn the Confederate left. Mott was to push forward on the New Market Road toward Richmond, Barlow to attack Fussell's Mill on the Darbytown Road, and Gregg's cavalry to cover the right flank of the army and look for an opportunity to race into Richmond. Birney's troops successfully pushed aside pickets on the Kingsland Road, but were stopped by the fortifications on New Market Heights. The II Corps units moved slowly into position, suffering numerous deaths from heat stroke.|$|E
