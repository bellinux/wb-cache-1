25|$|The {{emergence}} of Sachin Tendulkar and Anil Kumble in 1989 and 1990 was to herald {{an era of}} Indian cricket that was dominated by stars and individual brilliance. Sachin Tendulkar became arguably the best batsman in the world, along with Brian Lara of the West Indies and in 1998, Sir Donald Bradman himself remarked that Tendulkar batting style was similar to his. Mohammed Azharuddin, who captained India {{for most of the}} 1990s, proved a captain whose main strength, if not his motivational skills, was an ability to stay cool under pressure. Azharuddin's artistic batting however declined during the later years of his captaincy, and his best innings during this time were mostly when playing at home. The Hyderabadi stylist's career ended after 99 Tests when he was banned for life after being implicated in the match-fixing scandal. Under his captaincy, the Indian team became virtually unbeatable at home, with big wins against teams such as England, Sri Lanka, South Africa and Australia. Their performances abroad, however, left <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> desired.|$|E

PC Gamer UK reciprocated this view, but noted that naval strategy was a [...] "deeply difficult task" [...] for a developer, and that [...] "The Creative Assembly have done the best that their game template would allow".

Meteor!, an Asteroids clone, was cancelled to avoid a lawsuit and Avalanche! was released as Astrosmash. The resultant game borrows elements from Asteroids and Space Invaders, both which also influenced Defender and Gravitar, two popular and often cloned arcade games. Quality Software's Asteroids in Space (1980), another Asteroids clone, {{was one of the}} best selling games for the Apple II and was voted one of the most popular software titles of 1978-80 by Softalk magazine.

Gary Tillery notes the [...] "darkly sarcastic" [...] album title for a collection full of such [...] "downbeat" [...] tracks, the darkest of which is [...] "Grey Cloudy Lies". Harrison himself rated Extra Texture as his worst solo release of the 1970s. Speaking to Musician magazine in 1987, he dismissed it as [...] "a grubby album" [...] and added: [...] "The production left <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> desired, as did my performance...

After a 4–0 home defeat by Morecambe, Davis was one of five players left out.
