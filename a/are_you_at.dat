500|$|Earlier in the day, Booth {{had stopped}} by the Kirkwood House and left a note for Johnson: [...] "I don't wish to disturb you. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>at</b> home? J. Wilkes Booth." [...] One theory holds that Booth {{was trying to find}} out whether Johnson was {{expected}} at the Kirkwood that night; another holds that Booth, concerned that Atzerodt would fail to kill Johnson, intended the note to implicate Johnson in the conspiracy.|$|E
500|$|The {{events of}} the {{assassination}} resulted in speculation, then and subsequently, concerning Johnson and what the conspirators might have intended for him. In the vain hope of having his life spared after his capture, Atzerodt spoke much about the conspiracy, but {{did not say anything}} to indicate that the plotted assassination of Johnson was merely a ruse. Conspiracy theorists point to the fact that {{on the day of the}} assassination, Booth came to the Kirkwood House and left one of his cards. This object was received by Johnson's private secretary, William A. Browning, with an inscription, [...] "Don't wish to disturb you. [...] <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>at</b> home? J. Wilkes Booth." ...|$|E
2500|$|Often, {{the term}} [...] "Yat" [...] refers {{particularly}} to the New Orleans accents that are [...] "strongest" [...] or most especially reminiscent of a working-class New York City accent, though others use the term as a regional marker, to define the speech heard {{in certain parts of}} the city and its inner suburbs. Used in these narrower senses, Yat is simply one of many sub-dialects of New Orleans. The word comes from the common use of the local greeting, [...] "Where y'at?" [...] or [...] "Where <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>at</b> (i.e. in life)?", which is a way of asking, [...] "How are you?" ...|$|E

"Check It Out" [...] {{features}} the nearly constant {{repetition of the}} piano and vocal hook from The Buggles' 1979 classic 'Video Killed the Radio Star,' which is famous for being the first video ever played on MTV. Matthew Wilkening of AOL Radio Blog states that the [...] "Incessant 'Oh-a oh's' pretty much bore a hole in your head, the duo verbally flip the bird to their haters while on {{their way into the}} hottest dance club in town." [...] Wilkening gave the songs lyrics a negative review stating [...] "If you're looking for deep lyrical insights, jeez, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>at</b> the wrong party." [...] Becky Bain of Idolator gave the song a positive review stating, [...] "We almost want to cry foul for taking an extremely beloved 80s song (okay, the song was released in 1979 but the video debuted in 1981) and appropriating it for a modern-day hip-hop song, just because that’s become so commonplace it’s an uncreative, predictable way to get attention for your song. But… but… but… we can’t hate. We love this. We have no taste. It’s just too much fun—we can easily see this getting massive radio play like her other let’s-sample-another-popular-song-from-another-decade hit and make people's ears bleed, “Your Love”. What say you?" [...] Entertainment Weekly put the single as their #2 of [...] "The Must List" [...] stating, [...] "The Black Eyed Peas front-man and hip-hop's reigning femme fatale make ingenious use of those famous coos from the 1979 Buggles hit [...] "Video Killed the Radio Star" [...] to create an irresistible party-starter." ...|$|E
