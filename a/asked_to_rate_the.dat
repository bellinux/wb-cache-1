25|$|A poll {{conducted}} in the Republic of Moldova by IMAS-Inc Chișinău in October 2009 presented a detailed picture. The respondents were <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> <b>the</b> relationship between the identity of Moldovans and that of Romanians on a scale between 1 (entirely the same) to 5 (completely different). The poll showed that 26% of the entire sample, which included all ethnic groups, claimed the two identities were the same or very similar, whereas 47% claimed they were different or entirely different.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, eBay {{implemented}} {{a system of}} seller ratings with four categories. Buyers are <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> <b>the</b> seller {{in each of these}} categories with a score of one to five, with five being the highest rating. Unlike the overall feedback rating, these ratings are anonymous; neither sellers nor other users learn how individual buyers rated the seller. The listings of sellers with a rating of 4.3 or below in any of the four rating categories appear lower in search results. Power Sellers are required to have scores in each category above 4.5.|$|E
25|$|One {{experiment}} that {{was conducted to}} test the mere-exposure effect used fertile chicken eggs for the test subjects. Tones of two different frequencies were played to different groups of chicks {{while they were still}} unhatched. Once hatched, each tone was played to both groups of chicks. Each set of chicks consistently chose the tone prenatally played to it. Zajonc tested the mere-exposure effect by exposing Chinese characters for shorts amounts of time to two groups of individuals. The individuals were then told that these symbols represented adjectives and were asked to rate whether the symbols held positive or negative connotations. The symbols that had been previously seen by the test subjects were consistently rated more positively than those unseen. In a similar experiment, the individuals were not <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> <b>the</b> connotations of the symbols, but to describe their mood after the experiment. Members of the group with repeated exposure to certain characters reported being in better moods and felt more positive {{than those who did not}} receive repeated exposure.|$|E

25|$|A poll {{conducted}} in Moldova by IMAS-Inc Chișinău in October 2009 presented a somewhat detailed {{picture of the}} perception of identity inside the country. The participants were <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> <b>the</b> relationship between the identity of Moldovans and that of Romanians on a scale between 1 (entirely the same) to 5 (completely different). The poll shows that 26% of the entire sample, which includes all ethnic groups, claim the two identities are the same or very similar, whereas 47% claim they are different or entirely different. The results vary significantly among different categories of subjects. For instance, 33% of the young respondents (ages 18–29) chose the same or very similar, and 44% different or very different. Among the senior respondents (aged over 60), the corresponding figures were 18.5% and 53%. One of the largest deviation from the country average was among the residents of capital Chișinău, for whom the figures were 42% and 44%. The poll also shows that, compared to the national average (25%), {{people are more likely}} to perceive the two identities as the same or very similar if they are young (33%), are native speakers of Romanian (30%), have higher education (36%) or reside in urban areas (30%), especially in the capital city (42%).|$|E
25|$|Supra{{threshold}} tests, {{which provide}} intensities of taste stimuli above threshold levels, {{are used to}} assess the patient's ability to differentiate between different intensities of taste and to estimate the magnitude of suprathreshold loss of taste. From these tests, ratings of pleasantness can be obtained using either the direct scaling or magnitude matching method and may be of value in the diagnosis of dysgeusia. Direct scaling tests show the ability to discriminate among different intensities of stimuli and whether a stimulus of one quality (sweet) is stronger or weaker than a stimulus of another quality (sour). Direct scaling cannot be used to determine if a taste stimulus is being perceived at abnormal levels. In this case, magnitude matching is used, in which a patient is <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> <b>the</b> intensities of taste stimuli and stimuli of another sensory system, such as the loudness of a tone, on a similar scale. For example, the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center asks patients to rate the intensities of NaCl, sucrose, citric acid and quinine-HCl stimuli, and the loudness of 1000Hz tones. Assuming normal hearing, the results of this cross-sensory test show the relative strength of the sense of taste in relation to the loudness of the auditory stimulus. Although many of the tests are based on ratings using the direct scaling method, some tests do use the magnitude-matching procedure.|$|E
2500|$|First {{impression}} formation can {{be influenced}} by the use of cognitive short hands such as stereotypes and representative heuristics. [...] When <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> <b>the</b> socioeconomic status (SES) and degree of interest in friendship with African American and Caucasian female models wearing either a K-Mart, Abercrombie & Fitch, or non-logoed sweatshirt, Caucasian models were rated more favorably than the African American models. Abercrombie & Fitch wearers were rated as higher SES than the other sweatshirts. Interestingly, participants wanted to be friends with the Caucasian model most when she was wearing a plain sweatshirt and the African American model most when she was wearing either the plain or K-Mart sweatshirt. It is unclear why the plain sweatshirt was most associated with friendship, but the general results suggest that mismatching class and race reduced the model's friendship appeal.|$|E
30|$|Another methodological {{advantage}} is using {{two types of}} questions to gather information about the duration of outbreaks. The first type <b>asked</b> the participants <b>to</b> {{count the number of}} days of a typical outbreak, and <b>the</b> second <b>asked</b> them <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> <b>the</b> duration of their outbreaks on a 1 – 7 scale. Using these two types, we verified the consistency in the participants’ answers.|$|R
30|$|All our {{measures}} {{had been}} previously validated in Chinese organizations. We translated all scales into Chinese by following the translation and back translation procedures suggested by Brislin (1986) to minimize translation errors.

2500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the study, when <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> <b>the</b> tedious tasks, the subjects of the second group (paid $1) rated the tasks more positively than did the subjects in the first group (paid $20) and than did the subjects of the control group; the responses of the paid subjects were evidence of cognitive dissonance. The researchers, Festinger and Carlsmith, proposed that the subjects experienced dissonance, between the conflicting cognitions: [...] "I told someone that the task was interesting." [...] and [...] "I actually found it boring." [...] Moreover, the subjects paid one-dollar were induced to comply; compelled to internalize the [...] "interesting task" [...] mental attitude, because they had no other justification. The subjects paid twenty dollars were induced to comply by way of an obvious, external justification for internalizing the [...] "interesting task" [...] mental attitude, thus, they experienced a lesser degree of cognitive dissonance.|$|E
2500|$|During {{a survey}} {{conducted}} in December 2014 in which participants were <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> <b>the</b> quality of Rogers' NHL coverage {{on a scale of}} 1 to 10, those surveyed gave the telecasts an average score of 6.1 out of 10. Reviews were more positive among younger demographics (such as teens and millennials who gave an average score of 6.5 out of 10), citing the expanded availability of games, the [...] "hipper" [...] feel of the telecasts and how they are produced, but were lower among older viewers. Criticism was directed primarily towards how the contract affected the availability of Montreal Canadiens games and other French-language broadcasts, the [...] "gimmicky" [...] feel of their production, and the presence of George Stroumboulopoulos—who received an average rating of 5.7 out of 10 on the survey and, again, received relatively better reception among younger viewers with an average score of 6.2 out of 10.|$|E
2500|$|Following each scenario, {{people were}} {{presented}} with two options about how their attachments might respond. One option was [...] "he/she accepts you." [...] The other option was [...] "he/she rejects you." [...] People were <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> <b>the</b> likelihood of each response on a seven-point scale. Ratings of likely attachment responses corresponded to people's attachment styles. People with secure attachment styles {{were more likely to}} expect accepting responses from their attachments. Their relational schema for the third closeness scenario would be, [...] "If I tell my partner how deeply I feel for him or her, then my partner will accept me." [...] People with other attachment styles were less likely to expect accepting responses from their attachments. Their relational schema for the third closeness scenario would be, [...] "If I tell my partner how deeply I feel for him or her, then my attachment will reject me." [...] Differences in attachment styles reflected differences in relational schemas. Relational schemas may therefore be used to understand the organization of working models of attachment, as has been demonstrated in subsequent studies.|$|E

30|$|The survey {{instrument}} {{consisted of a}} consent form and a questionnaire containing 17 single and multi-part questions, intended to elicit the respondents’ perceptions regarding {{the importance of a}} number of ecosystem services and service metrics. Several demographic questions were included and respondents could make additional open-form comments on any aspect of the survey. Three multi-part questions provided the primary data used in the current study (see Additional file 1). One question <b>asked</b> respondents <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> <b>the</b> importance of a generalized list of ecosystem services to his/her household on a scale from 1 (“NOT IMPORTANT AT ALL”) to 6 (“EXTREMELY IMPORTANT”). Six of these were analyzed in this study; water flow regulation, water quality regulation, greenhouse gas regulation, scenic beauty, provision of timber products, and provision of firewood and other energy feedstocks. Two additional questions <b>asked</b> respondents <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> <b>the</b> importance of several metrics of water flow regulation (flood prevention and drought prevention) and water quality regulation (water that is safe to drink; and water that smells and tastes good) to their families on the same [1, 6] scale.|$|R

3000|$|While our {{experiments}} clearly {{showed that}} the choice for coherent auditory and visual segments will improve the perceived naturalness, {{at this point the}} exact impact of selecting the audio and the video fragments separately but from a same audiovisual database is still unclear. Future experiments using a larger database with more candidate units will hopefully answer this question. We should also investigate the impact of the different synthesis strategies on the overall quality of the synthetic audiovisual speech. For the second experiment the participants assessed the quality of the visual speech only. If, in contrast, we would <b>ask</b> <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> <b>the</b> combined auditory and visual speech quality, {{it is likely that the}} audio-driven synthesized samples would get a better rating since their audio track consists of natural speech. Note, however, that the results described in this paper illustrate that the outcome of such experiments is hard to predict since many intermodal effects can have an influence on the perception of an audiovisual speech signal.
