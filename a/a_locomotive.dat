5|$|After {{several years}} {{serving as a}} {{switching}} engine (<b>a</b> <b>locomotive</b> used for moving railroad cars around within a railroad yard; {{also known as a}} shunter) and stationary boiler, the John Bull was retired in 1866 and stored in Bordentown, New Jersey. Toward the end of its life in revenue service, the locomotive worked as a pump engine and as the power for a sawmill.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{frequent}} derailments, {{low speed}} meant Wotton Tramway {{had a good}} safety record. The locomotives occasionally ran over stray sheep, and on 12September1888 sparks {{from one of the}} Aveling and Porter engines blew back into one of the train's cattle trucks, igniting the straw bedding and badly burning two cows. The line had one serious accident, in which Ellen Maria Nickalls, a servant at Wotton House, was struck by <b>a</b> <b>locomotive</b> near Church Siding and killed. The coroner returned a verdict of accidental death, absolving driver James Challis.|$|E
5|$|In 1823 Stephenson and Pease opened Robert Stephenson and Company, <b>a</b> <b>locomotive</b> {{works at}} Forth Street, Newcastle, {{from which the}} {{following}} year the S ordered two steam locomotives and two stationary engines. On 16 September 1825, with the stationary engines in place, the first locomotive, Locomotion No. 1, left the works, and the following day it was advertised that the railway would open on 27 September 1825.|$|E
5|$|In 1882, the Met {{moved its}} {{carriage}} works from Edgware Road to Neasden. <b>A</b> <b>locomotive</b> works was opened in 1883 and a gas works in 1884. To accommodate employees moving from London over 100 cottages and ten shops were built for rent. In 1883, a school room and church took over {{two of the}} shops; two years later land {{was given to the}} Wesleyan Church for a church building and a school for 200 children.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s Amtrak found {{itself with a}} supply of surplus Metroliner cars with {{problematic}} propulsion systems, but with sound body and frame, stored at their Wilmington and Bear shop complexes in Delaware. The coaches were, except for the propulsion systems, a near-identical match to Amfleet coaches. Twenty-nine of the 31 coaches were renumbered and used as cab control cars for corridor services. This allowed trains to operate in push-pull service, rather than needing to be turned around on a wye at terminals or to have <b>a</b> <b>locomotive</b> on each end.|$|E
5|$|No 141 Squadron's Beaufighter Mk.IF's {{moved to}} Cornwall in February 1943 {{to carry out}} night patrols over Brittany and France and {{daylight}} patrols over the Bay of Biscay and Atlantic Approaches to protect RAF Coastal Command aircraft. On 20 March 1943 he claimed <b>a</b> <b>locomotive</b> destroyed and soon afterwards was promoted to acting wing commander. In April Braham attacked a German E-Boat, firing 500 rounds of 20mm cannon at the target causing a large fire. On other operations Braham damaged three E-Boats while also strafing and damaging a U-Boat.|$|E
5|$|No {{members of}} the Leader class survived the 1950s and only the numberplates of No. 36001 and No. 36002 are known to exist. The numberplate for No. 36001 {{is located in the}} National Railway Museum, {{although}} <b>a</b> <b>locomotive</b> builder's plate intended for the locomotive, but never fitted in service, was sold at auction in 2008. The Leader was a bold attempt at pushing back the boundaries of contemporary steam locomotive design and, if successful, would have prolonged the life of steam on Britain's Railways.|$|E

5|$|Pechersky, {{a son of}} a Jewish lawyer, {{was born}} on February 22, 1909 in Kremenchuk, Poltava Governorate, Russian Empire (now Ukraine). In 1915, his family moved to Rostov-on-Don where he {{eventually}} worked as an electrician at <b>a</b> <b>locomotive</b> repair factory. After graduating from university with a diploma in music and literature, he became an accountant and manager of a small school for amateur musicians.|$|E
5|$|Rogers Locomotive and Machine Works was a 19th-century {{manufacturer}} of railroad steam locomotives based in Paterson, in Passaic County, New Jersey, in the United States. It built {{more than six}} thousand steam locomotives for railroads around the world. Most railroads in 19th-century United States rostered at least one Rogers-built locomotive. The company's most famous product was <b>a</b> <b>locomotive</b> named The General, built in December 1855, {{which was one of}} the principals of the Great Locomotive Chase of the American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|After leaving {{school at}} the age of 14, Welensky found {{employment}} with Rhodesia Railways as a fireman, while putting his physical strength to work as a boxer. He rose through the ranks of Rhodesia Railways to become <b>a</b> <b>locomotive</b> engine driver and became involved in the trade union movement, joining the Rhodesian Railway Workers' Union. After participating in the unsuccessful 1929 Rhodesian Railways strike Welensky was moved by management to Broken Hill, the main base of the railways in Northern Rhodesia. In 1933 he became Chairman of the Broken Hill branch of the union, and was appointed to the National Council.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} development {{during this}} period was {{the establishment of the}} Narrow Gauge Railway Museum at Tywyn Wharf station. The first exhibit for what was to become the museum was <b>a</b> <b>locomotive</b> donated in 1952 by Guinness from their recently closed St. James's Gate Brewery railway. In 1954 the Preservation Society agreed to start work on a formal museum and exhibits from around the United Kingdom were acquired to form the nucleus of the collection. In 1955 work started on converting the old gunpowder store at Wharf station into a temporary museum building, and in 1956 the first exhibit arrived at Tywyn.|$|E
5|$|At RAF Winthorpe the Ju 88s {{attacked}} bombers {{illuminated by}} the landing lights. Leutnant Arnold Döring of IV./NJG 3 engaged and destroyed two bombers between 01:05 and 01:15 using his Schräge Musik. The British crews that witnessed the action switched off their navigation lights {{and he did not}} engage another bomber successfully. Döring had been told not to return with any ammunition so he engaged any targets of opportunity. He shot up <b>a</b> <b>locomotive</b> and set a wagon on fire. During the ten-minute time-frame Döring had claimed his victories, nine bombers had been destroyed. At 01:05 60 of No. 5 Group's Lancasters were still airborne and further losses were incurred against NJG 5 machines.|$|E
5|$|Braham was not {{satisfied}} with his current score-rate and lack of action in September 1943. Consequently, he flew a number of missions against ground targets. Successful night fighter pilots were ordered {{not to engage in}} such activities that exposed them to excessive risk. On one particular mission he decided to hunt enemy rail transport after failing to find enemy aircraft. On the Dieppe to Paris line he intercepted <b>a</b> <b>locomotive</b> which exploded after being hit. He attacked another but struck some trees which damaged the underside of the fuselage. Braham maintained control and flew home. It was not unusual for him to return with strange defections caused by collisions with objects. After one sortie against shipping the armourers were drenched in salt water and seaweed when they opened the panel housing the cannons with the intention of replacing spent ammunition.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> duplex <b>locomotive</b> is <b>a</b> steam <b>locomotive</b> {{that divides}} {{the driving force}} on its wheels by using two pairs of {{cylinders}} rigidly mounted to <b>a</b> single <b>locomotive</b> frame; it is not <b>an</b> articulated <b>locomotive.</b> The concept was first used in France in 1863, but was particularly developed in the early 1930s by the Baldwin Locomotive Works, the largest commercial builder of steam locomotives in North America, {{under the supervision of}} its then chief engineer, Ralph P. Johnson.|$|R
