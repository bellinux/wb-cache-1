5|$|Irenaeus' eschatology {{was based}} on a literal {{interpretation}} of the Bible, especially the Book of Revelation. He believed that there would be 6000 years of suffering before the world ends in a fiery purge. This fire would purify believers ahead of a new human community existing in the New Jerusalem. The afterlife, Irenaeus proposed, focuses more on time than space; he looked forward to <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> humans are fully developed and live the life of God.|$|E
5|$|Having {{traveled}} to France {{in the early}} 1920s, Gordon Balfour, the nephew of John Balfour, (who {{was one of the}} co-founders of Balfours Bakery), found inspiration for the frog cake in European confectionery. The frog cake was introduced by Balfours in 1922 after Gordon's return to Adelaide, during <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> tearooms were still popular in the city. It soon became known as the Balfours mascot, and has traditionally only been sold in South Australia, although they are now sold in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland as well.|$|E
5|$|The Diet was {{initially}} dominated by Polish nobles, but in time, it saw {{the emergence of}} a strong peasant faction. Another notable change over time included {{the emergence of a}} Ruthenian (modern Ukrainian) bloc, changing the balance of power within the body. Overall, the Diet preserved the Polish parliamentary tradition during <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> it waned in the Prussian Partition and the Russian Partition, and saw the emergence of the major political parties and groupings that were to dominate the political life of the Second Polish Republic after World War I. The leader of the Polish peasant movement in the Second Polish Republic, Wincenty Witos, gained his experience in the Diet, elected {{for the first time in}} 1908. Similarly, the National Democrats, and the Polish socialists, had their political blocs in the diet around that time.|$|E

5|$|The governor's {{relationship}} with the General Assembly has typically been the determining factor in his success at enacting his agenda, although other factors also play an important role. In most of Indiana's history, the governor has come to power at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> his party controlled the assembly. Since the political parties first became dominant in 1831 and until 2010, thirty-three sessions of the legislature have been divided with different parties controlling the House and Senate. Only five sessions have occurred where the legislature was entirely controlled by the opposition party, while in ninety-eight sessions the governor's party controlled the entire assembly.|$|E
5|$|US losses {{during the}} battle were {{extremely}} light; unusual for fighting at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> other UN offensive forces were paying a heavy price when making similar pushes against the North Korean troops. The US infantry forces suffered only five killed and 54 wounded in the 27th Infantry, plus three killed and 16 wounded in the 23rd Infantry. This brought the total American casualty count to 8 dead, 70 wounded. South Korean troops suffered much more heavily during the fight. An estimated 2,300 South Korean men {{were killed in the}} fighting; 2,244 enlisted men and 56 officers. However, these losses were not crippling, as volunteers poured in from the surrounding countryside to fight for the South Korean Army.|$|E
5|$|On 8 January 1960, McNicoll {{was posted}} to the Naval Board in Canberra as Second Naval Member and Chief of Personnel. As noted by {{historian}} Ian Pfennigwerth, McNicoll held this position at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> {{recruitment and retention}} in the Navy particularly lagged behind targets. McNicoll was additionally appointed as a trustee of the RAN Relief Trust Fund during this period. Completing his term on the Naval Board, McNicoll was posted as Flag Officer Commanding HM Australian Fleet on 8 January 1962 and hoisted his standard aboard , the flagship of the RAN. The Australian government had designated {{the role of the}} RAN to be primarily one of anti-submarine warfare, a posture which McNicoll thought unwise. McNicoll argued that surface and air weapons posed a threat equal to that of submarines toward vessels in modern naval warfare. As such, he campaigned for a contemporary aircraft carrier to replace that of HMAS Melbourne. The Army and Air Force opposed McNicoll's stance, and the government ultimately concluded that there was no strategic requirement for a new carrier in light of agreements contained in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. In any event, McNicoll experienced a particularly demanding tenure as Fleet Commander since the RAN {{was in the process of}} a complete overhaul of its order of battle and, as a consequence, he had to manage the introduction and deployment into service of six Ton-class minesweepers acquired from the Royal Navy, along with the first batch of Westland Wessex helicopters and modernised afloat support capabilities. Furthermore, McNicoll was charged with the responsibility of ensuring Australian naval commitments to the Far East Strategic Reserve were met.|$|E

25|$|In September 1970, King {{recorded}} Live in Cook County Jail, during <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> {{issues of}} race and class in the prison system were prominent in politics.

25|$|Founded in 1903 by a {{group of}} high school students, the club was named Hellas (the Greek word for Greece), at the request of a {{professor}} of classics.

25|$|The 1990s were {{a time of}} {{financial}} constraint as the Alberta government made budgetary cutbacks. {{but they were also}} <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the university benefited from philanthropic support.

25|$|Spain {{sponsored}} a major exploration led by Christopher Columbus in 1492; it quickly led to extensive European colonization of the Americas.

25|$|Controversy {{emerged during}} the 1880s; Kent and Nottinghamshire objected to the bowling actions of John Crossland and George Nash.

Although the 1880s was a period of {{controversy}} and modest results for the club, it was also <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> some club records were established. In 1885 George Kemp (later 1st Baron Rochdale) scored Lancashire’s first century in a Roses Match. In that same year Johnny Briggs and Dick Pilling set a first-class record partnership for the tenth wicket of 173 that stood until 1899 and has not been bettered by Lancashire. The club shared the title of champions with Surrey in 1889.|$|E
25|$|The {{politicians}} of the 1850s were {{acting in a}} society in which the traditional restraints that suppressed sectional conflict in the 1820s and 1850s– the most important of which being the stability of the two-party system– were being eroded as this rapid extension of democracy went forward in the North and South. It was an era when the mass political party galvanized voter participation to 80% or 90% turnout rates, and <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> politics formed an essential component of American mass culture. Historians agree that political involvement was a larger concern to the average American in the 1850s than today. Politics was, in one of its functions, a form of mass entertainment, a spectacle with rallies, parades, and colorful personalities. Leading politicians, moreover, often served as a focus for popular interests, aspirations, and values.|$|E
