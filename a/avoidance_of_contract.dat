40|$|CISG Articles 47 and 49 (1) (b) {{are part}} of the regime of {{remedies}} of breach of contract within the CISG, which in general can be divided into two categories: remedies where the contract can be terminated or avoided, such as fundamental breach, and remedies where the contract is still in force, such as damages. Articles 47 and 49 (1) (b) are provisions that span both remedies through the principle of the Nachfrist, which is the granting of additional time for the delivery of goods. The principle has been mainly borrowed from German domestic law, {{as well as from the}} French procedure of mise en demeure. However, there are significant differences between the German and French treatment of Nachfrist and the one accorded to in the CISG. This is a good time to remind ourselves of the mandate of Article 7 (1) where uniformity of application demands the autonomous interpretation of the CISG; that is, without relying on principles founded in domestic law. In other words, German and French treatment of Nachfrist and mise en demeure must be ignored and cannot be used to explain the principle within the CISG, despite significant similarities in doctrine and jurisprudence. Common law attorneys may find the concept of Nachfrist foreign as this term has no direct common law counterpart. In brief, the various Sale of Goods Acts do not rely on the principle of “fundamental breach”; they rather approach <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> through the breach of contractual terms; that is, breach of a major term or a condition...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the partial <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> and the limits to the {{following}} adjustment of its content. According to Art. 1419 of the Italian civil code, a contract can be partially void, but nothing has been expressly stated regarding the partial voidability. Nonetheless, the partial voidability is usually acknowledged by the courts, provided that the remaining part of the contract would not be further adapted or modified {{with respect to the}} price or other terms. As a consequence of this rule, when the grounds of avoidance affect the performance only in part, the party affected should have no right to a corresponding reduction of the price. This paper maintains that in some cases it could be unnecessarily harsh to deny the possibility of adapting the remaining contract after its partial annulment and it would rather be preferable to examine and take into account the different ways of adapting a contract provided for by the Italian law system, such as the judicial power of filling gaps, renegotiation, and the corresponding reduction of the price. For the same reasons, the partial avoidance of the contractual terms should be maintained separate from the partial avoidance of the object of performance: the former involves the juridical balance of the contract and requires a more in-depth analysis of the content, whereas the later is related to the economic balance of performance and counterperformance left to the contractual autonomy of the parties and requires only a corresponding reduction of the price. Consequently, in case of partial avoidance limited to the object of performance, the contract is subject to the rule set out by Art. 1464 of the Italian civil code, governing the supervening partial impossibility, which can be considered as the general rule when a performance has been partly reduced...|$|E

40|$|The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{successful}} international instruments that provide uniformity in the rules for international trade. It has been adopted by seventy-three countries and has been in force for twenty-one years. The People’s Republic of China (PRC) signed the CISG on 30 th September 1981 and many international sales of goods cases have been resolved under the CISG in China. The author will investigate these Chinese cases to examine the effectiveness of the CISG in order to establish whether the application of the CISG has been successful in leading to predictable judgments. This thesis focuses on remedies for breach of contract in the international sale of goods. Remedies are the main reason why claims are made in the international sale of goods and as such they are fundamental to that trade. The main remedies considered in this thesis are the <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract,</b> damages and specific performance. In addition, mitigation and the categorisation of the breach of contract are discussed where the former is an important means to restrict the recoverable damages and the latter constitutes the foundation for the study of remedies for breach of contract. Furthermore, the provisions related to the remedial rule of the CISG are those that the Chinese tribunals have applied most in their judgments. Research in this area provides the author with sufficient sources of cases for the examination of the Chinese decisions. Two other alternative national regimes are compared with the CISG to assess the predictability of decisions under these systems. These are the old Chinese law, i. e., the PRC Foreign-Related Economic Contract Law (FECL) and English law, i. e., Sale of Goods Act 1979 (SGA) together with English case law. The FECL was the governing law of the international sale contract before China acceded to the CISG. The SGA is the present statute of English international sale contract law. The similarities and differences of the remedial rules between the CISG, FECL and English law are compared in this thesis. Analysis of the Chinese cases tried under the rules of the CISG shows that the outcomes of these cases are not predictable. The author will apply the remedial rules of the FECL and English law to the Chinese cases examined here to find out whether the application of either of these two alternative regimes could have led to outcomes that are more predictable. The conclusion of this thesis summarizes the results of the author’s examination with regard to the Chinese tribunals’ difficulties in making predictable judgments, the causes of difficulty where judgments have been unpredictable and the author’s proposals as to how to resolve such difficultie...|$|E

40|$|The {{discipline}} on {{the partial}} <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> a <b>contract</b> has significantly {{evolved over the}} past few years in the European law. The traditional position has been that when the contract is only partly lawful, severance of the illegal promises is possible only if the preservation <b>of</b> the <b>contract,</b> once it is deprived of the illegal clause, does not alter the whole nature of the covenants (i. e the economic meaning <b>of</b> the <b>contract).</b> If not, the whole contract is void. However, this rule is clearly inadequate when the illegality of the contractual clauses arises from the need to ensure protection of one <b>of</b> the <b>contracting</b> parties. In this case it is always necessary that only the unfair terms are void (and so cut out) whereas the rest <b>of</b> the <b>contract</b> stays valid. In this context, both the law and the courts often limit the effects of the declaration of illegality by disposing a « statutory severance » of lawful and illegal terms. This solution, which is very common in the area <b>of</b> consumer <b>contracts,</b> ensures that the contract, without the unfair terms, keeps its effects. This paper aims to analyse the evolution of the treatment of partial invalidity, in the light of the rules regulating the consumer contracts in the European countries (especially after the Directive 93 / 13) as well as of the general rules on the partial avoidance recently provided by the Roumanian Civil Code (2011), the French Project of reform <b>of</b> the <b>contract</b> law (2014) and the Draft common frame of reference. This article also studies the connections between the partial avoidance and the ineffectivity <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> (or rule <b>of</b> « clause réputée non écrite ») as well as the effects of the declaration <b>of</b> partial <b>avoidance,</b> which often could trigger the redrafting <b>of</b> the <b>contract</b> by the judge...|$|R
40|$|In {{the light}} of the {{overwhelming}} literature concerning the seller’s liability for defects of goods, the present work investigates the remedy of the reduction of the price, focusing on the conditions for its application, on its nature, functioning and practical features. In spite of the occasional application in the Italian legal system, the importance of the remedy at stake is linked to its capacity <b>of</b> preserving the <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> sale and to the fact it is mentioned and disciplined under nearly every European and international legal instruments (i. e. Directive 1999 / 44 /EC and UN Convention of 1980) regulating the defect <b>of</b> the <b>contract</b> itself. As a matter of fact, the Author underlines how the aforesaid sources display an innovative approach to the analysed institution, in that they aim at reducing the scope of application <b>of</b> the <b>avoidance,</b> and show a preference for the mechanism for consumer’s protection that preserve the contract, as like as the repair of the good or the proportional reduction of the price. The analysis at first focus on the historical progress of the remedy, starting with a brief examination of its roman origin in the ius honorarium, then paying attention on its development throughout the ius civile and the ius Iustinianeum, up to its subsequent dogmatic evolution. After such introduction - essential to understand the ratio of the institution - the research scrutinizes the Italian legislation in force, investigating the practical functioning of the reduction of the price in the framework of the warranty for defects under the Civil Code and of the discipline of the “defect of conformity”, the new instrument for consumers’ protection under d. lgs. 6 th September 2005, no. 206. Eventually, the Author looks at the relationships between the reduction of the price and the other remedies available to the consumer, in particular the <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> the <b>contract</b> and the damages compensation...|$|R
40|$|Both the CESL and Belgian law {{adopt the}} {{principle}} that when a contract is avoided or terminated, each party has to make restitution of whatever it has received under that contract. For the CESL, this duty to make restitution is treated in detail in Chapter 17. Although this chapter has the general title of ‘Restitution’, its provisions only deal with restitution after avoidance or termination. Therefore, Chapter 17 {{does not apply to}} other cases of restitution, such as restitution after withdrawal <b>of</b> the <b>contract</b> (Articles 43 to 47 CESL) or restitution of additional payments in contracts between a trader and a consumer (Article 71 CESL). Contrary to the CESL, the Belgian Civil Code does not contain any specific provisions on restitution after <b>avoidance</b> or termination <b>of</b> a <b>contract.</b> The question <b>of</b> restitution after <b>avoidance</b> or termination <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> is seen {{as one of the most}} complex and delicate questions of Belgian civil law. Case law and legal doctrine on this question lack consistency, which gives rise to many uncertainties. Therefore, the solution of the CESL, providing a detailed set of rules on restitution after avoidance or termination, seems at least to be preferable to the present state of Belgian law on this point. However, this paper will point out that Chapter 17 CESL on restitution has some serious shortcomings. Whereas the basic principles of the restitution regime in Chapter 17 deserve approval, the more detailed rules on restitution need to be revised...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: <b>Avoidance</b> <b>of</b> {{activity}} is hypothesized {{to lead to}} muscle weakness and consequently, to physical disability. This study was undertaken to validate the avoidance model by providing evidence for the mediating role of muscle weakness {{in the relationship between}} <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> activity and physical disability in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. METHODS: Data on <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> activity, observed physical disability, and muscle strength of the knee in 107 patients with knee OA were analyzed. A series of regression analyses was performed to establish the mediating role of muscle weakness. First, the effect <b>of</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> activity on the level of disability was assessed. Next, the relationship between <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> activity and muscle strength was established. Finally, the mediating role of muscle strength could be established if the effect <b>of</b> <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> activity on disability decreased when muscle strength was taken into account. RESULTS: Initially, <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> activity accounted for 21. 5 % of variance in disability. <b>Avoidance</b> <b>of</b> activity also accounted for 3. 9 % of variance in muscle strength. After muscle strength was taken into account, the variance in disability accounted for by <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> activity was reduced from 21. 5 % to 15. 7 %. Thus, the criteria for establishing the mediating role of muscle strength were met. CONCLUSION: The results of this study provide evidence for the mediating role of muscle weakness in the relationship between <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> activity and disability in patients with knee OA.
