25|$|In March 2002, {{following}} {{the withdrawal of}} funding by Bomis during the dot-com bust, Larry Sanger left both Nupedia and Wikipedia.

25|$|The {{national}} Republican Party was at {{that time}} going through a period of internal problems over their position on communism, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> deal with the threatboth internally and externally. Craig brought the national party's problem to the state. Jenner and the party leadership supported faction of the party was virulently anti-communist, but Craig openly sided with Eisenhower and the wing of the party advocating a more measured response to the problem. Jenner was incensed not only by Craig's position on communism, but also on his campaign platform that advocated significant increased state spending and the start of a number of new programs. The difference between Craig and the party continued throughout his time in office. Craig's Democratic opponent was incumbent lieutenant governor John Watkins. Thanks in large part to Eisenhower's popularity, Craig won a landslide victory in the election.|$|E
25|$|Bradypodion pumilum has two ecomorphs: a large, brightly colored, ornate version {{often found}} in closed habitats, and a small, dull version with less {{ornamentation}} {{often found in}} open vegetation. Casque size {{is known to be}} used to communicate fighting ability, but it is yet to be known whether this size is an honest signal and if it is related to bite force. Bite force is significantly related to head size <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> tell the strength of the bite force is measuring the head width. Open habitat males tend to have larger heads thus having stronger bite force.Larger chameleons have a high casque (parietal crest) and are brightly colored with pink patches on their flank. The smaller chameleons found in open habitats have reduced casques and lack flank color patches at all. Battles between males can lead to severe injuries through biting.|$|E

John Arlott, reviewing them in Wisden 1962, said the first was [...] "full of trenchant good sense, humour, anecdote and shrewd observation". The second book, Arlott wrote, was [...] "to the best of this reviewer's knowledge, the first cricket book to be initially published in the modern paper-back format". It was, he added, [...] "full of good instruction and...sets down some genuine cricket wisdom with freshness and vitality".|$|E
500|$|By 23 July, Wedel had {{received}} direct {{orders from the}} impatient Frederick to secure a [...] "good position", by which the king meant defensible ground, {{and to use the}} preferred means of attack, by which the King meant [...] "oblique order". Wedel knew he must bring the Russians to battle before they could move on Frankfurt or risk his reputation with the King. On 23 July, Wedel ordered another reconnaissance of Saltykov's troops at Langen Meil, a small settlement outside Key, and found them in motion; assuming they meant to move on Frankfurt, he subsequently ordered an advance on the Russian right flank. Wedel's best opportunity seemed to be securing the Paltzig heights before the Russians could do so, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> do that would be through Kay.|$|E
500|$|With {{the appeals}} court having decided that the Minerals Leasing Act did not cover the pipeline's requirements, Alyeska and the oil {{companies}} began lobbying Congress to either amend the act or create a new law that would permit a larger right-of-way. The Senate Interior Committee began the first hearings {{on a series of}} bills to that effect on March 9, 1973. Environmental opposition switched from contesting the pipeline on NEPA grounds to fighting an amendment to the leasing act or a new bill. By {{the spring and summer of}} 1973, these opposition groups attempted to persuade Congress to endorse a Trans-Canada oil pipeline or a railroad. They believed the [...] "leave it in the ground" [...] argument was doomed to fail, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> oppose the pipeline would be to propose an ineffective alternative which could be easily defeated. The problem with this approach was that any such alternative would cover more ground and be more damaging environmentally than the Trans-Alaska Pipeline.|$|E

500|$|Paleontologist Robert T. Bakker {{originally}} {{suggested the}} genus name Utahraptor {{for a new}} dinosaur specimen that had been found by an amateur bone-hunter in Utah. Bakker {{was at the time}} consulting with the designers of the Jurassic Park film, whose largest portrayed Velociraptorcalled the [...] "big female" [...] in the scriptwas coincidentally {{the same size as the}} newly discovered Utahraptor. Bakker was motivated to write the book by both his interest in dinosaur behavior and his desire to marry science and entertainment, saying that [...] "nature is a drama. It is the most ripping yarn ever written. You've got life and death and sex and betrayal <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> approach it is through individual animals." [...] According to Bakker, [...] "It was fun to put myself in the mind of a raptor, especially since being a top predator is so challenging ... much harder than [...] a herbivore." [...] He credited the turn-of-the-century naturalist Ernest Thompson Seton's works that focused on life from the perspectives of grizzly bears and wolves as having inspired him to write the novel from the dinosaur's point of view.|$|E
2500|$|The book {{dates from}} c. 450–180 BCE {{and is a}} musing by King Solomon as he relates his {{experiences}} and draws lessons from them, often self-critical. The author, introducing himself as Solomon ("son of David, king in Jerusalem") discusses {{the meaning of life}} <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> live. He proclaims all the actions of man to be inherently , meaning [...] "vain" [...] or [...] "futile", ("mere breath"), as both wise and foolish end in death. Kohelet clearly endorses wisdom as a means for a well-lived earthly life. In light of this senselessness, one should enjoy the simple pleasures of daily life, such as eating, drinking, and taking enjoyment in one's work, which are gifts from the hand of God. The book concludes with the injunction: [...] "Fear God, and keep his commandments; for that is the whole duty of everyone" [...] (12:13).|$|E
