25|$|England and Australia {{drew the}} match. England were happy {{that they had}} saved the Test, but their batting was still weak with only Graveney, May and Cowdrey capable of playing Benaud's leg-spin with any confidence. Trueman had bowled well without <b>any</b> <b>luck</b> and Laker and Lock had shown their {{spinning}} skills, but the English fielding needed to be improved. Benaud was criticised for his defensive tactics, but {{said he had a}} job to do and 2–0 up was good for him and his team.|$|E

The planning of the military operation may have been local; however, approval to proceed had {{to come from the}} White House, where President Lyndon Baines Johnson was monitoring the situation. In any case, it was planned that three Royal Lao Army columns would converge on the intersection of Routes 7 and 13 in Laos, trapping a Lao communist force. With <b>any</b> <b>luck,</b> the highly strategic Plain of Jars would be left exposed to Royal Lao Government occupation.|$|E

Ian eventually forgives Michelle but Martin still refuses to speak to her. Michelle attempts to find work in schools, without <b>any</b> <b>luck.</b> Stacey invites Michelle to a family meal but Martin says Michelle is only pretending to care about her family, and tells her that she is not the big sister he used to look up to. Michelle starts community service and hears that Tim wants a divorce, and she tries to avoid the issue. Eventually, Martin and Michelle start to talk again but he is still angry that she has behaved like a teenager. Michelle then realises that she needs to apply for other jobs so enquires about a sales assistant job, which she successfully obtains.

Näslund had previously tried recruiting Forsberg to play for the Canucks prior to the 2007–08season, when Forsberg was an unrestricted free agent, without <b>any</b> <b>luck.</b> [...] Weighing in on Forsberg's possible NHL return, Näslund speculated that Forsberg would remain in Sweden to continue playing for Modo.

500|$|The {{journalist}} Jeff Simon described Hoffman as [...] "probably {{the most}} in-demand character actor of his generation", but Hoffman claimed never {{to take it}} for granted that he would be offered roles. Although he worked hard and regularly, he was humble about his acting success, and when asked by a friend if he was having <b>any</b> <b>luck</b> he quietly replied, [...] "I'm in a film, Cold Mountain, that has just come out." [...] Patrick Fugit, who worked with Hoffman on Almost Famous, recalled the actor was intimidating but an exceptional mentor and influence in [...] "a school-of-hard-knocks way", remarking that [...] "there was a certain weight that came with him". Hoffman admitted that he sometimes appeared in big-budget studio films for the money, but said, [...] "ultimately my main goal is to do good work. If it doesn't pay well, so be it." [...] He kept himself grounded and invigorated as an actor by attempting to appear on stage once a year.|$|E

500|$|In France, satirical {{magazine}} Charlie Hebdo {{was taken}} to court for publishing the cartoons; it was acquitted of charges that it incited hatred. [...] In Canada a human rights commission investigated The Western Standard, a magazine which published the cartoons, but found insufficient grounds to proceed with a human rights tribunal (which does not imply criminal charges, but is a quasi-judicial, mandatory process) against the publication. These government investigations of journalists catalysed debate {{about the role of}} government in censoring or prosecuting expressions they deemed potentially hateful. Critics said the cartoon controversy was a sign that attempts at judicial codification of such concepts as respect, tolerance and offence have backfired on the West. Michael Neumann wrote, [...] "Western piety has left the West without a leg to stand on in this dispute. It is no good trumpeting rights of free expression, because these rights are now supposed to have nebulous but severe limitations." [...] Tim Cavanaugh wrote that the incident revealed the danger of hate speech laws, writing, [...] "The issue will almost certainly lead to a revisiting of the lamentable laws against 'hate speech' in Europe, and with <b>any</b> <b>luck</b> to a debate on whether these laws are more likely to destroy public harmony than encourage it." ...|$|E

[...] Matthew Cole of Slant Magazine felt the album best in small doses, praising what he felt were highlights and commenting, [...] "With <b>any</b> <b>luck,</b> the band’s big-studio backing will find those winning tunes a home on the radio, as power-pop this well crafted surely deserves a little Top 40 success."

[...] The Guardian said [...] "Revival is a fourth album of stunning fatuousness." [...] Dr Dave De Sylvia of Sputnikmusic said [...] "Good Morning Revival is inconsistent; downright sinful at times, it contains sparks of brilliance and some very creditable pop moments." [...] Alternative Press said [...] "Good Charlotte have become caricatures of themselves". NOW Magazine said [...] "After years and years of hating every ounce of Maryland's mall-punk icons Good Charlotte, it seems now that the actual trick to enjoying their music on any plausible level is to go into the whole thing with absolutely no expectations. Not even low expectations. Nothing." [...] However, Billboard was positive of the album, calling it [...] "an album that proves being rich and famous doesn't always blunt a band's creative appetite." ...|$|E

Noone did not bring the boys <b>any</b> <b>luck,</b> but during the tour Bill Hurley offered to manage them. Hurley convinced Eager to release the boys from the contract with him. Ron Kelly left Kindness on 8 August 1973 and the band recruited an old school friend, Pete Spencer (drums/vocals), who had played in various groups, to drum for them. This line-up performed on a sightseeing boat in Frankfurt, Germany. Hurley introduced the band to composers Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman, who also wrote songs for glam rock contemporaries Sweet, Mud and Suzi Quatro, {{as well as for}} Hot Chocolate. At first [...] "Chinnichap" [...] turned them down, but Hurley's tenacity eventually convinced the composers/producers to give the young group a chance. Hurley and Chinnichap started working with the band, and suggested yet another name change, to [...] "Smokey". An attempt to dress the band up in leather clothes (similar to Suzi Quatro) was dropped, and the four won acceptance for their jeans outfit.|$|E
2500|$|The MCC tour party left Western Australia for South Australia {{with several}} concerns. Their 16-man squad {{had been reduced}} by knee {{injuries}} to captain Peter May and batsman Willie Watson. On the plus side Tom Graveney, Colin Cowdrey and Peter May all made centuries and Brian Statham, Peter Loader, Jim Laker, and Tony Lock had taken wickets. South Australia were not a strong team at this time and none of their players were certain of a Test place. Vice-captain Colin Cowdrey captained the MCC in place of May, but lost the toss to Colin Pinch who chose to bat. Les Favell (19) and Gavin Stevens (38) knocked up 43 runs in 52 minutes against Frank Tyson bowling downwind with Fred Trueman at fast-medium pace at the other end. Tyson was taken off and when Trueman was given the wind he bowled Favell. He was joined by Jim Laker (5/31) who amazed Clarrie Grimmett by getting the ball {{to turn on the}} first day, the great Australian leg-spinner {{had never been able to}} do this until the third day at the Adelaide Oval, and Tony Lock (0/40) was brought on. After lunch Tyson dismissed John Lill (34) and Johnny Martin for a duck, the last six wickets fell for 26 runs and South Australia were out for 165. Fast bowler John Drennan had injured himself batting, but opened the bowling at medium pace without <b>any</b> <b>luck.</b> Peter Richardson held the team together with 88 and added 102 with Tom Graveney (41), but the left-arm wrist spinner Johnny Martin was brought on for his state debut having moved west from New South Wales. Like Arthur Mailey he [...] "bowled like a millionaire" [...] and worked his way through the MCC batting with old-fashioned bowling figures of 7/110. Trueman hit the [...] "Chinamen" [...] for 4212446 in his eleven-minute 23 before he was caught and the innings ended on 245, a lead of only 80. With the wind behind him again Tyson beat Stevens with pace to catch him leg before, but the South Australians were [...] "Lakered and Locked" [...] as the Surrey spinners took 5/70 and 4/65, only Martin with two sixes in his 37 made a fight of it and they were out for 194 on the third day. Needing 115 to win Richardson (40) and Milton (63 not out) opened with 100 for the first wicket and the tourists won by 9 wickets that evening in extra time to give the players the fourth day off.|$|E
