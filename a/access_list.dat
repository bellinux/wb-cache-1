25|$|A random <b>access</b> <b>list</b> is a {{list with}} support for fast random access to read or modify any element in the list. One {{possible}} implementation is a skew binary random <b>access</b> <b>list</b> using the skew binary number system, which involves a list of trees with special properties; this allows worst-case constant time head/cons operations, and worst-case logarithmic time random access to an element by index. Random access lists can be implemented as persistent data structures.|$|E

50|$|FIBs {{can also}} play a role in an Internet best current {{practice}} (BCP) of ingress filtering. Though the simplest form of implementing ingress filtering is to use <b>access</b> <b>lists</b> to drop packets with improper source addresses, use of <b>access</b> <b>lists</b> becomes difficult on routers with a large number of adjacent networks, and traditional <b>access</b> <b>lists</b> are not used in high-performance router forwarding paths.|$|R

40|$|Some {{problems}} in configurations of network devices {{are difficult to}} identify. <b>Access</b> control <b>lists</b> present {{an important part of}} many configurations. Conflicts among rules of an <b>access</b> control <b>list</b> can cause holes in security policy or quality of service. In this paper we focus on identifying and classifying conflicts among rules of an <b>access</b> control <b>list.</b> Discovering all possible types of conflicts is not a trivial task. We present optimized algorithm for complete <b>access</b> control <b>list</b> analysis using tries, based on existing research by Baboescu and Varghese. The tool for detecting conflicts among <b>access</b> control <b>list</b> rules of one given Cisco, HP or Juniper device using tries based algorithm has been implemented. Bit vectors in tries use WAH compression method to reduce memory consumption. Implemented tool was tested for correctness and performance. The hypothesis that this solution would make the analysis of <b>access</b> <b>lists</b> significantly faster has been proven...|$|R
25|$|Because {{a maximum}} of five teams from one {{association}} can enter the UEFA Champions League, if both the Champions League title holders and the Europa League title holders are from the same top three ranked association and finish outside the top four of their domestic league, the fourth-placed team of their association will be moved to the Europa League and enter the group stage, which means changes to the <b>access</b> <b>list</b> of the Europa League may {{also need to be}} made.|$|E
25|$|In August 2016, UEFA {{announced}} {{changes in}} the <b>access</b> <b>list</b> of the tournament, driven to avoid the creation of European Super League. The top four clubs from the four top-ranked national associations will receive guaranteed qualification automatically for the group stage. The Europa League champion also will automatically qualify for the group stage. However, the plan passed by UEFA caused outrage among smaller associations and after {{the election of the}} new UEFA president Aleksander Čeferin it is still possible to be amended. On December 9, 2016 UEFA confirmed the planned reform.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the gate}} on Earth was found without a DHD, the Stargate team on Earth {{developed}} {{the technology to}} interface with the gate in order to power it and dial it {{by the use of}} computers. Unlike a DHD, their version is essentially manual dialing, as the system physically moves the inner ring to lock in the address. Dialing on a DHD automatically locks in the symbols, making the DHD much faster at dialing. However, the SGC's dialing computer has the advantage of controlling access to the Stargate and storing working addresses, whereas a DHD can be used by anyone and has no easy to <b>access</b> <b>list</b> (a limited number of previously accessed gate addresses are stored in the DHD crystals, but the technology and knowledge to access them is not widespread).|$|E

Compression of <b>access</b> control <b>lists</b> is functional for system management of network and optimization for the reason that diminishing large <b>access</b> control <b>lists</b> rule sets to a great extent reduces the difficulty of supervising and optimizing configurations of network. Due to an augment in Internet applications besides enhancement in identified vulnerabilities and attacks, compression <b>lists</b> of <b>access</b> control may perhaps sanction users with outsized <b>access</b> control <b>lists</b> to make use of such devices and moreover this may develop into an increasingly critical concern intended for several users.

40|$|This {{innovation}} can be {{run as a}} standalone network application on any {{computer in}} a networked environment. This design can be configured to control one or more routers (one instance per router), and can also be configured {{to listen to a}} policy server over the network to receive new policies based on the policy- based network management technology. The Router Agent Technology transforms the received policies into suitable <b>Access</b> Control <b>List</b> syntax for the routers it is configured to control. It commits the newly generated <b>access</b> control <b>lists</b> to the routers and provides feedback regarding any errors that were faced. The innovation also automatically generates a time-stamped log file regarding all updates to the router it is configured to control.

50|$|On {{some types}} of {{proprietary}} computer-hardware (in particular routers and switches), an <b>access</b> control <b>list</b> provides rules that are applied to port numbers or IP addresses that are available on a host or other layer 3, each {{with a list of}} hosts and/or networks permitted to use the service. Although it is additionally possible to configure <b>access</b> control <b>lists</b> based on network domain names, this is a questionable idea because individual TCP, UDP, and ICMP headers do not contain domain names. Consequently, the device enforcing the <b>access</b> control <b>list</b> must separately resolve names to numeric addresses.
