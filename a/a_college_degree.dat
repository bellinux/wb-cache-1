When his high school friends went off to the state university in 1901, he enrolled in a local business school, but only lasted a semester. He later took night courses at the Kansas City Law School, but dropped out. Truman attempted to gain admission to the United States Military Academy at West Point, but was rejected for his poor eyesight. He was proud of his military service in the artillery during World War I, and held a reserve commission as a colonel.|$|E
5|$|The age for officer {{candidates}} {{was between}} 20 and 50; {{they had to}} have <b>a</b> <b>college</b> <b>degree,</b> or two years of college and two years of professional or business experience. The enlisted age requirements were between 20 and 36; candidates had to have completed at least two years of high school. For the most part, SPARS were white, but five African-Americans did eventually serve. The agreement between the U.S. Navy and the USCG required that officer candidates receive their indoctrination training at Smith College, Northampton, Massachusetts. But in June 1943, the USCG withdrew from the agreement, and the indoctrination of SPAR officer candidates was transferred to the USCG Academy at New London, Connecticut. Most SPAR officers were general duty officers, but some officers received specialized training.|$|E

5|$|In his youth, {{he enjoyed}} polo and boxing. He led a polo team {{known as the}} Zardari Four. His father owned Bambino—a famous cinema in Karachi—and donated movie {{equipment}} to his school. He also appeared in a movie, Salgirah, as a child artist. Zardari's academic background remains a question mark. He received his primary education from Karachi Grammar School. His official biography says he graduated from Cadet College, Petaro in 1972. He went to St Patrick's High School, Karachi from 1973–74; a school clerk says he failed his final examination there. In March 2008, he claimed he had graduated from the London School of Business Studies with a {{bachelor of education degree}} in the early 1970s. Zardari's official biography states he also attended Pedinton School in Britain. His British education, however, has not been confirmed, and a search did not turn up any Pedinton School in London. The issue of his diploma was contentious because a 2002 rule required candidates for Parliament to hold <b>a</b> <b>college</b> <b>degree,</b> but the rule was overturned by Pakistan's Supreme Court in April 2008.|$|E

[...] School of Education. University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2017 This quantitative study examines students’ survey responses {{as they begin}} the transition from high school into and through their initial year of college then to completion of <b>a</b> four-year <b>college</b> <b>degree,</b> to explore differences for both first generation college students and students whose parents have <b>a</b> four-year <b>college</b> <b>degree.</b> The research design uses data from four points in time to analyze and report {{the characteristics of a}} sample population of more than 16, 000 students spread across 750 public and private secondary institutions in the United States (Gall, Gall & Borg, 2007). The data are derived from the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002, specifically the Student Questionnaires and phases that include the Base Year (2002), the First Follow Up (2004),the Second Follow Up (2006), and the Third Follow Up (2012), which offers the opportunity to see the data through different lenses. Students who responded to the survey were separated into two groups for the purposes of analysis: first generation college students (FGCS) and students who have a parent with <b>a</b> 4 -year <b>college</b> <b>degree</b> (SPCD). This data disaggregation and the use of Binary Logistic Regression allowed the researcher to analyze and discuss the factors involved in both groups’ progression to completion of <b>a</b> four-year <b>college</b> <b>degree.</b> Results of the study showed that FGCS were 1. 5 times less likely to persist to <b>a</b> four-year <b>college</b> <b>degree</b> than SPCD. Further, in conducting the regression models when all of the variables selected for this study are considered together, only school motivation, familial involvement and a student’s confidence significantly predict FGCS’ persistence to completion of <b>a</b> four-year <b>college</b> <b>degree.</b> Introduction [...] Literature review [...] Methodology [...] Results [...] Discussion [...] Appendix A.
