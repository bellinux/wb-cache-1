5|$|Upon developing, the depression, {{small in}} {{physical}} size, moved slowly west-northwestward. Initially, the NHC faced difficulties in forecasting {{the future of}} the system due to the potential for resumed strong wind shear, as well as uncertainty in its path of direction. It gradually organized and intensified, and based on observations from the Hurricane Hunters, the NHC assessed the depression as a tropical storm late on September11; upon doing so, they gave it the name Gordon. As it strengthened, Gordon developed more substantial outflow and increasing banding features. On September12, the storm slowed <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> north through a weakness in the subtropical ridge created by Florence. Wind shear decreased further, and the storm's convection became more symmetric with an intermittent eye feature in the center. Based on the presence of the eye and estimates from satellite imagery, it is estimated that Gordon intensified into a hurricane early on September13.|$|E
25|$|SH-33 and SH-47 swapped places west of US-283 on July 9, 1956; SH-47 {{proceeded}} due west of Roll to the Texas state line, while SH-33 {{passed through}} Cheyenne <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> west south of there. This gave both highways straighter courses and resolved the wrong-way concurrency. However, {{the change was}} rescinded on August 13, 1956.|$|E
25|$|Confident {{with their}} initial success, the Dakota {{continued}} their offensive and attacked {{the settlement of}} New Ulm, Minnesota, on August 19, 1862, and again on August 23, 1862. Dakota warriors had initially decided not to attack the heavily defended Fort Ridgely along the river, <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> town, killing settlers along the way. By the time New Ulm was attacked, residents had organized defenses in the town center {{and were able to}} keep the Dakota at bay during the brief siege. Dakota warriors penetrated parts of the defenses and burned much of the town. By that evening, a thunderstorm dampened the warfare, preventing further Dakota attacks.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} the month, Sea Devil {{entered the}} East China Sea <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Kyūshū coast. On 1December, just prior to midnight, she made radar contact with a distant convoy and {{commenced}} running with the state-five sea on four engines to gain position. At 02:39 on 2December, she changed course to close the convoy. A minute later, she took a wave over the bridge which knocked the starboard lookout onto the bridge deck; flooded the main induction and both engine rooms to the lower deck plates; and sent water through the supply line into the after battery compartment, the crew's mess, and the radio shack. A solid stream came into the control room via the conning tower. But, other than numerous electrical grounds, no damage was sustained.|$|E
500|$|Coming ashore at an [...] "oblique" [...] angle, {{the storm}} crossed the coast at modern Burrwood, Louisiana, and traversed the Mississippi River Delta. The storm made {{landfall}} in Mississippi between Biloxi and Pascagoula early on August 12. The hurricane quickly weakened as it continued inland <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> east, likely deteriorating below tropical storm status while over southern Georgia, although because the hurricane database does not utilize tropical depression status for storms before 1871, it {{is listed as}} maintaining tropical storm intensity as it crossed the southeastern U.S.; by August 14, it had remerged into the western Atlantic Ocean. Ship reports from {{the vicinity of the}} system indicate it regained some strength once over open waters, although it only persisted a couple more days before it disappeared on records.|$|E
500|$|The 1991 Perfect Storm, {{also known}} as The No-Name Storm (especially in the years {{immediately}} after it took place) and the Halloween Gale, was a nor'easter that absorbed Hurricane Grace and ultimately evolved back into a small unnamed hurricane late in its life cycle. The initial area of low pressure developed off Atlantic Canada on October 29. Forced southward by a ridge to its north, it reached its peak intensity as a large and powerful cyclone. The storm lashed the east coast of the United States with high waves and coastal flooding before turning to the southwest and weakening. Moving over warmer waters, the system transitioned into a subtropical cyclone before becoming a tropical storm. It executed a loop off the Mid-Atlantic states <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> northeast. On November 1 the system evolved into a full-fledged hurricane with peak winds of 75 miles per hour (120km/h), although the National Hurricane Center left it unnamed to avoid confusion amid media interest in the predecessor extratropical storm. It later received the name [...] "the Perfect Storm" [...] (playing off the common expression) after a conversation between Boston National Weather Service forecaster Robert Case and author Sebastian Junger. The system was the fourth hurricane and final tropical cyclone in the 1991 Atlantic hurricane season. The tropical system weakened, striking Nova Scotia as a tropical storm before dissipating.|$|E

2500|$|Asheville, Lieutenant Jacob W. Britt in command, cleared Tjilatjap {{a little}} before 1500 on 1 March 1942, bound for Fremantle. In the late {{afternoon}} on 2 March, she was seen by the Australian corvette Bendigo, heading for Australia. [...] At 0615, Tulsa sighted a ship, and identified her as Asheville, probably {{the last time the}} latter was in sight of friendly forces. During the forenoon watch on 3 March, Asheville radioed [...] "being attacked," [...] some [...] south of Java. The minesweeper , heard the initial distress call <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> reported position some [...] away. When a second report specified that the ship was being attacked by a surface vessel, however, Whippoorwills captain, Lieutenant Commander Charles R. Ferriter, reasoning correctly that [...] "any surface vessel that could successfully attack the Asheville would be too much" [...] for his own command, ordered the minesweeper to resume her voyage to Australia.|$|E
2500|$|Vizcaya {{was locked}} in a running gun duel {{for nearly an hour}} with Brooklyn. Despite {{steaming}} side-by-side with Schley's flagship at a range of about [...] and even with some good shooting which knocked out a secondary gun aboard Brooklyn, almost none of the Spaniards' nearly 300 shots caused significant damage, while Brooklyn pounded Vizcaya with devastating fire. Subsequent claims by Admiral Cervera, and later research by historians, have suggested that nearly 85% of the Spanish ammunition at Santiago was utterly useless, either defective or simply filled with sawdust as a cost-saving measure for practice firing. The American ammunition had no such issues of lethality. Vizcaya continued the fight until overwhelmed, {{and by the end of}} the engagement she had been struck as many as 200 times by the fire from Brooklyn and Texas. Brooklyn had closed to within [...] when she finally delivered an [...] round which, according to witnesses, may have detonated a torpedo being prepared for launch. A huge explosion ensued, Vizcaya was mortally wounded, and fires raged out of control, burning her reserves of ammunition that were on deck. She hauled down her flag <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Aserraderos beach to ground herself at 11:15.|$|E
