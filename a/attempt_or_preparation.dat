40|$|Since the {{implementation}} of Directive 2004 / 48 EC on the Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights in Sweden there is today a possibility for pharmaceutical companies holding a patent to issue interim injunctions against a generic company {{on the grounds of}} an <b>attempt</b> <b>or</b> <b>preparation</b> to a pharmaceutical patent infringement. It has been shown that one of the earliest steps in which a generic company may infringe a pharmaceutical patent is to offer the generic drugs onto the market. However, since {{the implementation}} of the attempt and preparation rule in the Swedish Patent Act questions have been raised as to in what stage interim injunctions may be issued against an <b>attempt</b> <b>or</b> <b>preparation</b> to offer generic drugs onto the market made by generic companies. This thesis has therefore intent to investigate at what stage interim injunctions may be applied for against a generic company on the grounds of an <b>attempt</b> <b>or</b> <b>preparation</b> to offer generic drugs. In the thesis the writer argues that in order for an <b>attempt</b> <b>or</b> <b>preparation</b> to offer generic drugs to exist an overall assessment must be made of the particular situation and that there is no specific principles to follow in order to determine either an attempt or a preparation to offer generic drugs. However, some guidance might be brought from Danish case law in order to establish a preparation to offer generic drugs in Sweden. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the murders in Czech Republic in 2000 - 2011. Its aim is to inform the reader about the {{development}} of number of murders and their classification according to different criteria, which are not normally available to the public. The work will capture an overall trend in the development of number of murders in selected years. The murders will be divided according to their termination, which is meant, if the case was closed, forwarded to another department of the Police of the Czech Republic, if the case was suspended in accordance pursuant to § 159 a/ 4 or if the case was postponed for another reason. Murders will be also divided according to stage {{at the time of the}} apprehension of the offender (completed act, <b>attempt</b> <b>or</b> <b>preparation),</b> typology (dial M for murder, infanticide, murder motivated by personal relationships, etc.) a crime scene by region. In this work will be also captured the characteristics of the offender, according to sex, age and nationality. On the acquired data there will be further examined the dependence of the number of murders on unemployment rate in the regions and the dependence of numbers of offenders on numbers of foreigners by citizenship...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} from a recent meta-analysis of pediatric antidepressant trials if a general property of antidepressant medications [...] the multiple-dosing medication half-life [...] is associated with risks for suicidal ideation or behavior. METHODS: Relative risks for suicidal behavior (ideation, <b>attempt,</b> <b>or</b> <b>preparation)</b> for seven antidepressants were obtained from both the FDA 2 ̆ 7 s initial and published versions of their pediatric antidepressant meta-analysis. The correlation between the relative risk for suicidal behavior and antidepressant half-life was examined using a nonparametric test, Spearman 2 ̆ 7 s rho. RESULTS: A significant correlation (rho= 0. 929; p= 0. 003) was observed for the initial analysis, as previously reported by Weiss and Gorman. The correlation was robust {{to a change in}} the suicidality ranking for the longest half-life medication, fluoxetine, that occurred when results from the Treatment of Adolescent Depression Study (TADS) were included in the published meta-analysis (rho= 0. 786, p= 0. 036). LIMITATIONS: In addition to limitations common to meta-analyses, our analysis has additional uncertainties including the fact that adult, rather than pediatric, antidepressant half-life data were used due to an unavailability of published information. In addition, risks for suicidal ideation/behavior may vary for reasons other than half-life (e. g. study eligibility criteria, illness severity or responsiveness to treatment, diagnoses, etc.). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of suicidal ideation or behavior in short-term antidepressant trials involving children or adolescents, as defined in the recent FDA meta-analysis, appears to be potentially at least partly associated with antidepressant half-life. Although any relationship is tentative, approaches to investigating several potential candidate mechanisms for any association are discussed...|$|E
