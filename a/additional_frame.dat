2500|$|In 1976, the Valiant was {{available}} as a Code A38 police package car and offered in three basic engine sizes: E24 (California emission standards) and E25 (Federal) [...] single-barrel Slant-6; E44 , twin-barrel V-8; E58 , four-barrel V-8 with single (California) or dual (Federal) exhaust. It was the E58 that Chrysler recommended for police service {{as it was the}} only one with [...] "added endurance features to improve durability." [...] The E58 produced 175 net hp in California trim and 220 net hp in Federal form. The E58 dual exhaust engine (sans catalytic converters) made for a very fast Valiant squad car. So equipped, this compact Chrysler cop car tripped the quarter-mile lights in 16.4 seconds with trap speeds of [...] and could catch nearly all the so-called [...] "performance cars" [...] of the day. The Seattle Police Department using the Valiant A38 reported a 46 percent drop in the preventable accident rate among police officers, and according to a Motor Trend police survey, the A38 Valiant had much better evasive capabilities, better overall visibility, and was generally easier to drive than the full-size squad cars. A special handling package applied to the A38 Valiant included front and rear antisway bars. Unfortunately, the Valiant wasn't physically durable enough; it lacked <b>additional</b> <b>frame</b> welds and rear cross-member reinforcements standard on all other Mopar A38 packages. More importantly, the front K-frame of the Valiant was prone to failure under severe police use.|$|E

50|$|To {{reduce the}} 625-line signal to 525, less {{expensive}} converters drop 100 lines. These converters maintain picture fidelity by evenly spacing removed lines.

In the following field, the process would repeat, completing one frame.) To create the five <b>additional</b> <b>frames,</b> the converter repeats every fifth frame.|$|R

5000|$|Unfortunately {{this sort}} of clock {{decoding}} does not work unless {{there are at least}} some transitions between 1 and 0 in the data; a long stream of 0s or 1s has no transitions in it, making it impossible to know where the data for any particular byte starts. In order to avoid this problem, <b>additional</b> <b>framing</b> bits are added to either end of every byte, typically one bit on either side known as the [...] "start and stop bits". This guarantees at least one 1-to-0 transition for every byte, more than enough to keep the clocks locked. However, these bits also expand every 8 bits of data (one byte) to 10 bits, an overhead of 20%.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a formal specification that structures a framework in Zachman's Enterprise Architecture Model as a tree of frames. Each frame is the familiar role &times; interrogative grid. Each cell {{of the grid}} contains, recursively, <b>additional</b> <b>frames</b> down to leaves. The formalism also provides mechanisms for connecting framework components down the recursive levels of detail and down the grid categories of roles. While the tree of frames expresses {{the structure of a}} framework model, these connections express the framework's meaning. On top of the basic formalism, additional mechanisms facilitate customizing of framework meta-models, viewing frameworks from different perspectives, and imposing constraints on the framework model. The paper also discusses implications of the formalism on the ways in which Zachman framework models are discovered...|$|R
50|$|Fort McDermit was {{intended}} to hold a garrison of two companies one of cavalry and one of infantry. It was built around a rectangular parade ground measuring 600 by 285 ft. Its permanent structures were first erected in 1866 and 1867 and consisted of three buildings for officers, a large barracks, a three-room hospital, storehouses (for supplies to keep the fort running for six months) and stables all surrounding a square. All of the post buildings were one story with shingle roofs built of adobe, stone or frame construction. <b>Additional</b> <b>frame</b> structures were added in the late 1870s. The post was expanded on September 3, 1867, to be two miles square with a two-mile-wide hay reserve extending along {{each side of the}} Quinn river for 5 mi. On October 4, 1870, this hay reserve was extended further up and down the river bringing the total to 10374 acre.|$|E
