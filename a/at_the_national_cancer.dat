25|$|In 2011, {{the genome}} of an {{exceptional}} bladder cancer patient whose tumor had been eliminated {{by the drug}} everolimus was sequenced, revealing mutations in two genes, TSC1 and NF2. The mutations disregulated mTOR, the protein inhibited by everolimus, allowing it to reproduce without limit. As a result, in 2015, the Exceptional Responders Initiative was created <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Cancer</b> Institute. The initiative allows such exceptional patients (who have responded positively {{for at least six}} months to a cancer drug that usually fails) to have their genomes sequenced to identify the relevant mutations. Once identified, other patients could be screened for those mutations and then be given the drug. In 2016 To that end, a nationwide cancer drug trial began in 2015, involving up to twenty-four hundred centers. Patients with appropriate mutations are matched with one of more than forty drugs.|$|E
2500|$|In 1978 Cohen et al. {{proposed}} that reduced {{production of the}} hormone melatonin might {{increase the risk of}} breast cancer and citing [...] "environmental lighting" [...] as a possible causal factor. Researchers <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Cancer</b> Institute (NCI) and National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences conducted a study in 2005 that suggests that artificial light during the night can be a factor for breast cancer by disrupting melatonin levels.

2500|$|Several studies {{published}} since 1990 {{indicate that}} cooking muscle meat creates heterocyclic amines (HCAs), which {{are thought to}} increase cancer risk in humans. Researchers <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Cancer</b> Institute published results of a study which found that human subjects who ate beef rare or medium-rare had less than one third the risk of stomach cancer than those who ate beef medium-well or well-done.

Also, microwaving meat before cooking may reduce HCAs by 90%.|$|E
2500|$|Murine polyomavirus (also {{known as}} mouse polyomavirus, Polyomavirus muris, or Mus musculus polyomavirus 1, and in older {{literature}} as SE polyoma or parotid tumor virus; abbreviated MPyV) is an unenveloped double-stranded DNA virus of the polyomavirus family. The first {{member of the}} family discovered, it was originally identified by accident in the 1950s. A component of mouse leukemia extract capable of causing tumors, particularly in the parotid gland, in newborn mice was reported by Ludwik Gross in 1953 and identified as a virus by Sarah Stewart and Bernice Eddy <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Cancer</b> Institute, after whom it was once called [...] "SE polyoma". Stewart and Eddy would go on to study related polyomaviruses such as SV40 that infect primates, including humans. These discoveries were widely reported at the time and formed the early stages of understanding of oncoviruses.|$|E
2500|$|Three {{immunotoxin}} {{drugs have}} been studied in patients at the NIHNational Cancer Institute in the U.S.: [...] BL22, HA22 and LMB-2. [...] All of these protein-based drugs combine part of an anti-B cell antibody with a bacterial toxin to kill the cells on internalization. [...] BL22 and HA22 attack a common protein called CD22, which is present on hairy cells and healthy B cells. [...] LMB-2 attacks a protein called CD25, which is not present in HCL-variant, so LMB-2 is only useful for patients with HCL-classic or the Japanese variant. [...] HA-22, now renamed moxetumab pasudotox, is being studied in patients with relapsed hairy cell leukemia <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Cancer</b> Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas, and Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. Other sites for the study are expected to start accepting patients in late 2014, including The Royal Marsden Hospital in London, England.|$|E

2500|$|The al-Zawahiri {{family was}} {{considered}} [...] "distinguished" [...] while {{they lived in}} Maadi. [...] Al-Zawahiri's parents both came from prosperous families. Al-Zawahiri's father, Mohammed Rabie al-Zawahiri, came from a large family of doctors and scholars. Mohammed Rabie became a surgeon and a professor (of pharmacy [...] ) at Cairo University. Ayman's mother, Umayma Azzam, came from a wealthy, politically active clan. Ayman {{has said that he}} has a deep affection for his mother. Her brother, Mahfouz Azzam, became a role model for Ayman as a teenager. Ayman has a younger brother, Muhammad al-Zawahiri, and a twin sister, Heba Mohamed al-Zawahiri. Al-Zawahiri's sister, Heba Mohamed al-Zawahiri, became a professor of medical oncology <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Cancer</b> Institute, Cairo University. She described her brother as [...] "silent and shy". Al-Zawahiri's brother, Muhammad al-Zawahiri, was sent to the Balkans by his older brother in 1993. Ayman al-Zawahiri sent Muhammad to meet with Alija Izetbegović, commander of the 3rd Corps of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, along with senior staff officers attached and religious leaders, to check the Islamisation of the Bosnian Army and the funds received for the mujahedeen fighters in Bosnia. Muhammad was known as a logistics expert and {{is said to be the}} military commander of Islamic Jihad. Muhammad worked in Bosnia, Croatia, and Albania under the cover of being an International Islamic Relief Organization (IIRO) official. While hiding in the United Arab Emirates, he was arrested in 2000, then extradited to Egypt, where he was sentenced to death. He was held in Tora Prison in Cairo as a political detainee. Security officials said he was the head of the Special Action Committee of Islamic Jihad, which organized terrorist operations. However, after the Egyptian popular uprising in the spring of 2011, on 17 March 2011 he was released from prison by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, the interim government of Egypt. His lawyer said he had been held to extract information about his brother Ayman. However, on 20 March 2011, he was re-arrested. On 17 August 2013, Egyptian authorities arrested Muhammad al-Zawahiri at his home in Giza.|$|E
