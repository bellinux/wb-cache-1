Firstly, accuracy and precision of the HPIC method were measured. Secondly, the HPIC method and a classical <b>absorptiometric</b> method were compared. The HPIC method was more sensitive and selective than the <b>absorptiometric</b> method {{which led to a}} 27 % overestimation of the phytic acid content in legume seeds. Because it is rapid and easy to perform, the HPIC method appears to be particularly suitable for routine analysis of food samples. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

Spine and non-dominant femoral DXA measurements (Lunar Cooperation, USA) and non-dominant hand <b>absorptiometric</b> measurements (Metriscan-Alara, California-USA) have been done in 172 post-menopausal women who were outpatients in the Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Clinic at İstanbul Göztepe Hospital of Education and Research. Demographic characteristics were identified. Statistical analyses have been performed by the calculation of Pearson correlation coefficient. The post-menopausal women mean age was 59 ± 8. 43 Std (41 - 81 years). Both spine and femur DXA T scores were moderately correlated with radiographic <b>absorptiometric</b> scores (r: 0. 63 and 0. 62 respectively, p< 0. 001).

Thus, some studies have reported that BMD is associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with vitamin D receptor (VDR), serum 25 (OH) D levels and estrogen receptor 1 (ESR 1), but without consensus. Therefore, we aimed to map and compare the risk genotypes for forearm and total hip low BMD. Data were derived from a population-based study in northern Norway; the Tromsø Study. Distal forearm BMD was measured with a single x-ray <b>absorptiometric</b> device, while total hip BMD was measured with a dual-energy x-ray <b>absorptiometric</b> device. There were 7, 317 and 4, 082 successful analyses of distal forearm and total hip BMD, respectively, {{and at least one}} SNP of interest. We evaluated plausible BMD modulating factors and associations of BMD and SNPs related to vitamin D metabolism (FokI, Cdx 2, BsmI, rs 2298850, rs 10741657, rs 3794060, rs 6013897), ApaI-BsmI-TaqI haplotypes and ESR 1 SNP rs 4870044. Age, BMI, physical activity and smoking were significantly associated with BMD. In a linear regression model with adjustment for age and gender and with the major homozygote as reference, rs 6013897 had a standardized beta coefficient (β) of - 0. 031 (P = 0. 024) for total hip BMD. β for ESR 1 SNP rs 4870044 was - 0. 016 (P = 0. 036) for forearm BMD and - 0. 034 (P = 0. 015) for total hip BMD. The other SNPs nor serum 25 (OH) D were significantly associated with BMD. Both forearm and total hip BMD were associated with ESR 1 SNP rs 4870044. Of the vitamin D-related genes, only CYP 24 A 1 gene rs 6013897 was associated with total hip BMD, but the association was weak and needs confirmation in other studies.

40|$|The {{seemingly}} unqualified reliance and near-universal dependence upon in vivo dual-energy X-ray <b>absorptiometric</b> (DXA) methodology {{to provide}} accurate, quantitative, and meaningful in vivo (in situ cadaveric) bone mineral areal density (“BMD”) determinations are {{proven to be}} unwarranted and misplaced. The underlying systematics of sizable, inherently unavoidable and un-correctable inaccuracies in the DXA output values of in vivo “BMD” are shown to be quantitatively consistent with being {{the root cause of}} unreliable, misdirected, and misinterpreted aspects of consensual knowledge of bone fragility, osteoporotic diagnostics/prognostics, and remodelling therapies. The “BMD” label that DXA ascribes to the output values of in vivo (in situ cadaveric) bone densitometry scans is shown to be a misnomer and an erroneous and invalid measure of bone mineral material. The DXA-derived “BMD” value does not correctly represent the areal density of bone mineral material, as it is contaminated by sizable, unavoidable, inextricable, independent soft tissue contributions. Due to intra- and extra-osseous soft tissue X-ray <b>absorptiometric</b> effects, it is unknown (and unknowable) exactly what DXA in vivo “BMD” is a measure of in any given case, or what proportion of the “BMD” value represents the actual bone mineral material areal density present in the DXA scan region of interest (ROI) of any predominantly trabecular bone-site (e. g., lumbar vertebrae, proximal femora). This inherent fundamental defect in DXA in vivo bone mineral areal density methodology adversely compromises both the validity and reliability of patient-specific diagnostic/prognostic evaluations, cross sectional and prospective studies, and DXA-based interpretations of bone quality and bone fragility. It further undermines the WHO characterizations (and definitions) of ‘normal’, ‘osteopenic’, and ‘osteoporotic’ classifications. It is also seen to make equivocal the qualitative and quantitative epidemiological estimates of the proportion of the population that is, or is deemed to become, osteoporotic. The present quantitative exposition shows DXA-measured in vivo “BMD” methodology to be an intrinsically flawed and misleading indicator of bone mineral status and an erroneous gauge of relative fracture risk...|$|E
