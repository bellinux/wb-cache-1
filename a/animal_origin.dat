5|$|Carbon is {{essential}} to all known living systems, and without it {{life as we know}} it could not exist (see alternative biochemistry). The major economic use of carbon other than food and wood is in the form of hydrocarbons, most notably the fossil fuel methane gas and crude oil (petroleum). Crude oil is distilled in refineries by the petrochemical industry to produce gasoline, kerosene, and other products. Cellulose is a natural, carbon-containing polymer produced by plants in the form of wood, cotton, linen, and hemp. Cellulose is used primarily for maintaining structure in plants. Commercially valuable carbon polymers of <b>animal</b> <b>origin</b> include wool, cashmere and silk. Plastics are made from synthetic carbon polymers, often with oxygen and nitrogen atoms included at regular intervals in the main polymer chain. The raw materials for many of these synthetic substances come from crude oil.|$|E

40|$|The {{internal}} {{areas and}} the position of integration of the glycopeptide resistance element Tn 1546 were characterized by using PCR fragment length polymorphism, sequencing, and DNA hybridization techniques with 38 high-level vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium isolates of human and <b>animal</b> <b>origins</b> from Europe and the United States. Only minor variations in the coding regions within Tn 1546 were found, suggesting high genetic stability. The isolates originated from broilers (n = 5), a chicken (n = 1), a duck (n = 1), a turkey (n = 1), pigs (n = 8), a pony (n = 1), and humans (n = 23). A total of 13 different types were defined based on a single-nucleotide difference in the vanX gene, the presence of insertion sequences, and hybridization patterns. For some types more than one isolate were found. For type 1, 10 isolates of both human and <b>animal</b> <b>origins</b> were 1 found. All were indistinguishable from the reference strain, BM 4147. For type 2, 11 isolates of human and <b>animal</b> <b>origins</b> were found. Six human isolates from England were all of type 3. Two human isolates from the United States, indistinguishable from each other, were type 9. These results showed that vancomycin-resistant E. faecium of <b>animal</b> and human <b>origins</b> can contain indistinguishable genetic elements coding for vancomycin resistance, indicating either horizontal gene transfer between E. faecium organisms of human and <b>animal</b> <b>origins</b> or {{the existence of a}} common reservoir for glycopeptide resistance...|$|R
5000|$|The {{previous}} administration of Ripperdá brought most of Texas population into poverty. In addition, massive exports of products of <b>animal</b> <b>origins</b> caused a depletion of livestock, resulting in cattle raiding (to continue producing products of <b>animal</b> <b>origins,</b> an economic activity practiced by many families in Texas) {{and the failure}} of an ordinance issued in January 1778. Cabello tried to comply with regulation of exports and made attempts to prevent illegal exports.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} how in Britain, France and Italy the idea of the living animal is being detached from the action of eating meat. It is an ongoing historical process, which has recently been fuelled by the new issue of cultured meat. Design/methodology/approach: Starting from Goody's developmentalist stages (Production, Distribution, Preparation and Consumption), first this work analyses historically how these stages have undergone the process of the disappearance of the <b>animal</b> <b>origins</b> of meat (<b>animal</b> <b>origins</b> of meat are parts like the head and legs that remind us that once meat was an animal). Second, this paper applies cultured meat to Goody's stage of Production, linking the new product to the historical, above described, process. Findings: The analysis shows that, in the past, Goody's stages of Consumption, Distribution and Preparation witnessed the disappearance of the <b>animal</b> <b>origins</b> of meat, while Production was not affected by the phenomenon. Today, with testing on cultured meat, even the stage of Production has gone through this process. Now, all of Goody's stages are involved in the process. Usually considered a shocking novelty, cultured meat is instead a stage of a historical process. Originality/value: No one has previously analysed the disappearance of the <b>animal</b> <b>origins</b> of meat relating it to Goody's stages, and a current issue like cultured meat has never been considered a further step of this process. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited...|$|R
25|$|As {{early as}} 1956 there were {{suggestions}} {{in the scientific}} literature that trans fats could be a cause of the large increase in coronary artery disease but after three decades the concerns were still largely unaddressed. In fact, by the 1980s, fats of <b>animal</b> <b>origin</b> {{had become one of}} the greatest concerns of dieticians. Activists, such as Phil Sokolof, who took out full page ads in major newspapers, attacked the use of beef tallow in McDonald's french fries and urged fast-food companies to switch to vegetable oils. The result was an almost overnight switch by most fast-food outlets to switch to trans fats.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin A, a bi-polar {{molecule}} {{formed with}} bi-polar covalent bonds between carbon and hydrogen, {{is linked to}} a family of similarly shaped molecules, the retinoids, which complete {{the remainder of the}} vitamin sequence. Its important part is the retinyl group, which can be found in several forms. In foods of <b>animal</b> <b>origin,</b> the major form of vitamin A is an ester, primarily retinyl palmitate, which is converted to an alcohol in the small intestine. Vitamin A can also exist as an aldehyde, or as an acid. The discovery of vitamin A stemmed from research dating back to 1906, indicating that factors other than carbohydrates, proteins, and fats were necessary to keep cattle healthy. By 1917 one of these substances was independently discovered by Elmer McCollum at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and Lafayette Mendel and Thomas Osborne at Yale University.|$|E
25|$|All {{members of}} the family Sarcophagidae are larviparous or ovoviviparous. Sarcophaga haemorrhoidalis (Bercaea cruentata) gives live birth to larvae with the female {{retaining}} the egg case in her abdomen. Flesh flies are strongly attracted to carrion or dry flesh. The female has a strong desire to lay larvae on the flesh and have even been noted to larviposit on the sleeve of a garment that has been previously soiled with blood. Oldroyd states that the larvae of Sarcophaga spp are voracious and will take anything of <b>animal</b> <b>origin</b> be it alive or dead. A larva is forced out of the larvipositor usually head first and soon disappears into the food material. Once larvae are deposited as 1st stage instars, rapid development follows with 3rd instars usually being achieved by three to four days. Larviposition to adulthood generally takes around two weeks.|$|E

25|$|Cryoconservation is an {{indispensable}} {{tool in the}} storage of genetic material of <b>animal</b> <b>origin</b> {{and will continue to}} be useful for the conservation of livestock into the future. Cryoconservation serves as a way to preserve germplasms, which is particularly beneficial for threatened breeds. Indigenous livestock may be conserved for a variety of reasons, including the preservation of local genetics, their importance in local traditions and their value to the culture identity and heritage of the area. The loss of regional livestock diversity could increase instability, decreases future possibilities and challenge production systems. Moreover, the maintenance of indigenous breeds can aid in the preservation of traditional lifestyles and livelihoods, even providing income through cultural tourism. Indigenous breeds can contribute to local economies and production systems by utilising land that is unsuitable for crop production to produce food products, as well as providing hides, manure and draft power. Therefore, the conservation and progression of these breeds are of the utmost importance for food security and sustainability.|$|E
25|$|Diernhofer {{first used}} the name Streptococcus dysgalactiae in 1932, {{describing}} a streptococcus of veterinary origin. Subsequently, Frost reported {{the discovery of}} the human pathogen Streptococcus equisimilis in 1936. Contemporarily, though, Rebecca Lancefield devised a classification of streptococci based on their carbohydrate-antigens, and successively described streptococci belonging to group C (1933) and group G (1935). The correlation of group carbohydrate specificity with the proposed species S.dysgalactiae and S.equisimilis, however, were not explored in detail. The Lancefield classification soon became the preferred laboratory identification method for streptococci, and the names S.dysgalactiae and S.equisimilis fell into disuse. In 1980, they were even removed from the List of Approved Bacterial species. Three years later, though, DNA hybridization studies revealed extensive similarities between the entities Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus equisimilis, large-colony-forming group C and group G streptococcus of human origin, and certain large-colony-forming group C, G and L streptococci of <b>animal</b> <b>origin.</b> Accordingly, they were fused to one species, Streptococcus dysgalactiae. However, subsequent molecular investigations indicated heterogeneity within this new species, and in 1996 it was divided into S.dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis and S.dysgalactiae subspecies dysgalactiae.|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} {{foraging activity}} of P. fraternus occurs during the hottest {{part of the}} day, which is usually between noon and 2:30pm. There is a positive correlation of temperature and foraging behavior and a negative correlation between humidity {{in the air and}} foraging behavior. There was the greatest foraging (bringing back the most food) during the pre-emergence phase of the colony cycle because of increased nest construction and a large nutritional demand from the brood. Foraging is important because the nest needs water to maintain a certain temperature. It also needs wood pulp to construct and repair cells and sugary substances like nectar and honeydew to feed the brood and adults. Protein of <b>animal</b> <b>origin</b> is also required to feed to the larvae. When workers are bringing back food and building materials it slows their flight down. There are food foragers, nectar foragers and water foragers. Foragers with distended abdomens that exchange liquid at the nest entrance are most likely water foragers; while foragers with normal abdomens that exchange liquids inside the nest are nectar foragers. Prey and pulp are easy to see in the wasp's mandibles, and so these wasps were more easily identified as food and material foragers.|$|E

30|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{established}} a novel LC–MS method for animal source identification of glue using detection patterns of 12 type I collagen-derived marker peptides. This database-independent approach enables discrimination between eight animals {{regardless of whether}} their type I collagen sequences are known. In addition, our method is applicable not only to simple glue samples but also to samples containing two <b>animal</b> <b>origins.</b> We demonstrated its application in glue certification by detecting undeclared animal species and blends or contamination of different <b>animal</b> <b>origins</b> in commercial glue products. Furthermore, we clarified that both cattle- and sheep-originated animal glues {{were used in the}} ground and size layers of The Harvest. Many studies have investigated glues present in artworks and identified their <b>animal</b> <b>origins</b> using MS [15 – 19]. However, only one glue species was determined for each sample in almost all of the investigations, except for the simultaneous detection of bovine- and fish-specific peptides in a polychromy sample [18]. Our novel method may uncover hidden facts about glue used for artworks, which will be helpful to understand the use of artist’s materials in historic objects. We could not determine the animal source of four commercial products. These were assumed to be derived from more than three animals or other unexpected animals. Species identification under these situations will be an area of future work. We consider that reselection of marker peptides in response to the target animals should lead to successful determination of the animal source for such complicated glue samples.|$|R
