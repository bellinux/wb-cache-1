5|$|Basil II was at {{that time}} in the eastern provinces of his empire, {{wintering}} on the plain of Tarsus following his campaign against the Fatimid dynasty in Syria. On hearing of David’s death he marched north-eastward to claim the lands David had promised to the emperor. The local Georgian and Armenian nobility submitted without any serious resistance. The only notable incident occurred when a quarrel between a Georgian soldier and a Varangian Guardsman over a bale of hay developed into a major fight, involving 6,000 Varangians <b>and</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> lives of thirty Georgian high-ranking nobles.|$|E

5|$|After Cain's disappearance, Mary becomes {{head of the}} Hargreaves. Augusta {{possesses}} Alexis, {{and seeks}} out Mary in the mausoleum Cain had built before leaving to confront Alexis. Augusta reveals that she manipulated Alexis into abusing his sons and trying to resurrect her for her amusement. Before she can kill Mary, Augusta triggers Cain's trap in the mausoleum and dies. Years later, Mary is married to Oscar and pregnant with their child, although she still waits for his return. Crehador, a medium close to Cain, sets up a tea party for Mary, fulfilling Cain's promise; he then reminisces on how he found Cain being held by Riff's corpse within the ruined tower. The bunkoban-exclusive epilogue expands the ending slightly. It shows an elderly Mary, who lies on her deathbed attended by a woman nearby and hears the laughter of Jizabel's ghost as he plays with his pet sheep. Sensing a presence nearby, she dies, <b>and</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> form of her ten-year-old self, her soul joins Cain hand-in-hand at a tea party with their friends and loved ones—although they exist as spirits, a boy nearby can hear them.|$|E

5|$|After lunch, Morris was bowled for 62, {{knocking}} a {{ball from}} Wright onto his stumps, after attempting a sweep {{from a long}} hop. This brought Bradman in to join Barnes. Yardley surrounded the Australian captain with fielders and Laker beat his bat thrice in an over. Bedser was brought in with the leg trap again in place as he bowled on Bradman's pads with the second new ball. The Australian captain decided to avoid the danger of being caught at short fine leg from a leg glance by padding the inswingers away with his front leg. Bedser responded by changing his tactics by bowling a series of outswingers, beating the outside edge of his bat {{three times in a}} row, narrowly missing the off stump on one occasion. Barnes responded by manipulating the strike and shielding Bradman from Bedser. The Australian opener had little trouble against the leg trap Bedser set for him, scoring freely into the leg side <b>and</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> shine off the new ball.|$|E
5|$|After lunch, Morris was bowled for 62. Bradman joined Barnes and the Australian skipper {{played and}} missed {{a few times}} before {{settling}} down. Barnes responded to his captain's difficulties by manipulating the strike and shielding Bradman from Bedser. The Australian opener had little trouble against the leg trap Bedser set for him, scoring freely into the leg side <b>and</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> shine off the second new ball. Generally however, Barnes also scored sedately after lunch, and after one extended period of defence, he drove Laker for four through the covers, eliciting a round of ironic applause. Barnes responded to the public gallery by placing {{his hand on his}} chest and bowing to the spectators. Barnes had started slowly, but accelerated after reaching his half-century. He reached 96 with Australia at 1/222 half an hour after tea. By this time, the pace of the pitch appeared to have slowed, making batting relatively easy.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{ordered his}} men not to harass {{the women on}} the train, but the guerrillas robbed all of the men, finding over $9,000 <b>and</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> soldiers' uniforms. Anderson forced the {{captured}} Union soldiers to form a line and announced that he would keep one for a prisoner exchange, but would execute the rest. He addressed the prisoners, castigating them for the treatment of guerrillas by Union troops. After selecting a sergeant for a potential prisoner swap, Anderson's men shot the rest. Anderson gave the civilian hostages permission to leave but warned them not to put out fires or move bodies. Although he was alerted of the congressman's presence in the town, he opted not to search for him. The guerrillas set the passenger train on fire and derailed an approaching freight train. Anderson's band then rode back to their camp, taking a large amount of looted goods.|$|E

5|$|Cowes Castle {{was used}} to house {{important}} visitors to the Isle of Wight and also as a prison; {{the captain of the}} castle had further responsibilities for managing the arrival of foreign vessels. When the English Civil War broke out in 1642 between the supporters of Charles I and Parliament, the castle was initially held for the King by its captain, Humphrey Turney. On 12 August, as tensions between the rival factions on the island increased, Turney personally fired one of the castle's guns at the nearby Parliamentary naval vessel Lion. An unidentified Scottish naval captain then came ashore on 16 August and captured Turney, before landing more men <b>and</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> castle for Parliament, who held {{it for the rest of}} the war.|$|E
5|$|Earlier, in April and May 1521, five Portuguese ships docked at Tuen Mun {{to begin}} trading, but {{were ordered to}} leave once {{officials}} came to the region to announce the emperor's death. The Portuguese refused this demand, so the Chinese sent a naval squadron to drive them out, sinking one ship, killing many, <b>and</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> rest as prisoners (First Battle of Tamao). Two more Portuguese vessels arrived in June, were attacked by Chinese ships, but were able {{to fend off the}} Chinese attack. Three more Portuguese ships barely fended off another attack in September, the same month that Fernão Pires de Andrade and Tomé Pires arrived back at Canton. Ming authorities would not permit Fernão and Pires to see the prisoners captured in the sea battles and made inventories of their goods and the goods captured from the Portuguese ships.|$|E

5|$|In early 1997, {{after months}} of negotiations, the San Diego Padres signed a working {{agreement}} with the Chiba Lotte Marines that gave the Padres exclusive signing rights to another Nomura client, Hideki Irabu. Although both Irabu and Nomura stated that Irabu would only sign with the New York Yankees, neither the Padres nor the Marines consulted Irabu before finalizing their deal. The Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) sided with Irabu, stating that the arrangement unfairly disregarded a player's expressed wishes. However, MLB's executive council ruled that the Padres had not violated any existing rule, and therefore legally held the rights to Irabu. Following this decision, Irabu contemplated {{a number of different}} options, including playing in NPB until he became a free agent, <b>and</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> matter to the U.S. judicial system. By May, however, the Padres gave in and traded Irabu to the Yankees, who signed him for $12.8million over four years.|$|E
5|$|In many cases, {{large groups}} of {{immigrant}} Han would unite under a common surname to form a brotherhood. Brotherhoods were used {{as a form of}} defense, as each sworn brother was bound by an oath of blood to assist a brother in need. The brotherhood groups would link their names to a family tree, in essence manufacturing a genealogy based on names rather than blood, <b>and</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> place of the kinship organizations commonly found in China. The practice was so widespread that today's family books are largely unreliable. Many Plains Aborigines joined the brotherhoods to gain protection of the collective as a type of insurance policy against regional strife, and through these groups they took on a Han identity with a Han lineage.|$|E
5|$|In the 1913 season, Kilner scored 1,586 runs at {{an average}} of 34.47, which {{remained}} his highest seasonal aggregate of runs and placed him third in the Yorkshire batting averages. He also took 18 wickets at 25.22. At the end of May and beginning of June, Kilner took part in century partnerships in four consecutive matches, culminating in his maiden first-class century against Leicestershire. During his innings of 104, he hit 18 fours and shared a partnership of 184 in under two hours with his close friend Major Booth, rescuing Yorkshire from 58 for five <b>and</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> score to 300. Throughout the season, he played several valuable innings when Yorkshire were under pressure. His batting was always adventurous and attacking although he often made uncertain starts to his innings and showed impatience. The strength and variety of the Yorkshire bowling attack meant his left-arm spin was not often required. Even so, Yorkshire dropped to second in the Championship.|$|E

5|$|It {{was more}} {{difficult}} to take Koroni. General Sébastiani showed up there on October 7 with a party from his brigade. The fort commander’s response was similar to those given at Navarino and Methoni. Sébastiani sent his sappers, who were pushed back by rocks thrown from atop the walls. A dozen men were wounded, among them Cavaignac and, more seriously, a captain, a sergeant and three sappers. The other French soldiers felt insulted and their general had great difficulty in preventing them from opening fire <b>and</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> stronghold by force. The Amphitrite, the Breslaw and the Wellesley came to {{the assistance of the}} ground troops. The threat they posed led the Ottoman commander to surrender. On October 9, the French entered Koroni and seized 80 cannons and guns, along with numerous victuals and munitions.|$|E
5|$|Khandoba is {{described}} as doing odd jobs under Banai's orders. Banai first assigns him the task of sweeping the entire vada. He is responsible for cleaning the sheep pens <b>and</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> sheep and lambs for grazing. He completes all tasks by spreading his magical bhandara. The shepherds are astonished how a single old man can handle all the animals. Their vanity is crushed. Banai assigns him the additional responsibility {{of taking care of}} five hundred children. She commands if any sheep or lamb is lost or a child cries, she will not give him his food. But Khandoba fulfils the tasks again by spraying his bhandara. She assigns him the job of washing the sheep and lambs. Instead, Khandoba kills all her sheep and lambs to humble the shepherds and Banai. He skins the sheep and separates the meat. A repentant Banai begs his forgiveness; he agrees to revive her flock on the condition that Banai marries him. Khandoba revives the sheep by spreading his bhandara and reveals his true form.|$|E
5|$|Robert Hues (1553 – 24 May 1632) was an English {{mathematician}} and geographer. He attended St. Mary Hall at Oxford, {{and graduated}} in 1578. Hues {{became interested in}} geography and mathematics, and studied navigation at a school set up by Walter Raleigh. During a trip to Newfoundland, he made observations which caused him to doubt the accepted published values for variations of the compass. Between 1586 and 1588, Hues travelled with Thomas Cavendish on a circumnavigation of the globe, performing astronomical observations <b>and</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> latitudes of places they visited. Beginning in August 1591, Hues and Cavendish again set out on another circumnavigation of the globe. During the voyage, Hues made astronomical observations in the South Atlantic, and continued his observations of the variation of the compass at various latitudes and at the Equator. Cavendish died on the journey in 1592, and Hues returned to England the following year.|$|E
