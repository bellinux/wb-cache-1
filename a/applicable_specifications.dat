40|$|Construction {{specifications}} play {{an important}} role in communicating quality requirements on a construction project. However, working with these specifications can be cumbersome and error prone due to the large amount of specifications that need to be considered and the dependencies between those specifications. This paper discusses an approach for automating the processing of construction specifications to support inspection and quality control tasks in construction projects. The reasoning approach leverages information available in different types of product and process models to identify specifications applicable to products existing in a project and to extract the requirements imposed by the specifications applicable to each product. The automated identification of <b>applicable</b> <b>specifications</b> and the automated extraction of requirements imposed by these specifications can support and enable automation of tasks, such as inspection and defect detection, which depend on information from construction specifications. Thus, the herein presented specification reasoning approach can be seen as a stepping stone towards automated defect detection on construction sites...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: GNSS, {{particularly}} GPS {{has been}} used for monitoring structural deformation and deflection for more than a decade. While it is used for this purpose, GPS has demonstrated its feasibility and obvious advantages over other more traditional monitoring systems. However, there is an apparent shortage of <b>applicable</b> <b>specifications</b> and standards as well as reliable data processing techniques. The common interface between surveyors carrying out field data collection and their structural engineering counterparts who are responsible for further structural dynamic interpretation is far beyond mature. Structural engineers now still cannot fully understand the potentials of GPS and confidently use it as a major field data acquisition tool. Based on more than ten years experience in using GPS and other sensors such as triaxial accelerometers and ground-based pseudo-satellites for structural deformation and deflection monitoring in the UK, the authors present a feasible and reliable monitoring system and relevant data processing techniques which can be employed to monitor and analyse the performance of an operational suspension bridge with main spans varying from several tens of metres to more than one thousand metres. Detailed procedures for field data collection, data analysis and visualisation, generation of reliable analytical model, model updating and prediction for structural operational condition are also recommended. Data from a real- life bridge monitoring practice are analysed in the paper to address different issues raised by the authors...|$|E
40|$|Background and {{objective}} Though {{the concept of}} enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) has been progressively known by the surgeons and applied clinically, {{the current status of}} its cognition among thoracic surgeons and application in thoracic surgery is still unknown. Based on the analysis of a survey of thoracic surgeons and nurses on chest ERAS during a national conference, we aimed to analyze the status and difficulties of the application of ERAS in thoracic surgery. Methods A total of 773 questionnaires were collected during the first West China chest ERAS Forum and analyzed. The content of the questionnaire can be divided into two parts, including the respondents’ institute and personal information, 10 questions on ERAS. Results (1) Current status of clinical application of ERAS is the concept rather than the practice: 69. 6 % of the surgeons and 58. 7 % of the nurses agreed with this view; in addition, 88. 5 % of the doctors and 85. 7 % of the nurses believed that the concept of ERAS may be applicable to every branches of surgery; (2) 55. 6 % of the doctors and 69. 1 % of the nurses believed that the reason of poor clinical application of ERAS included no mature procedure, lack of consensus and specifications; (3) The best team for the clinical practice of ERAS should be based on surgeon-centered multidisciplinary cooperation and integration of medical care: 62. 1 % of the surgeons and 70. 7 % of nurses agreed with this view; (4) 73. 7 % of the surgeons and 81. 9 % of the nurses agreed that mean hospital stay, patients’ experience in hospital and social satisfaction should be the evaluation standard of ERAS practice. Conclusion The application of ERAS in thoracic surgery is still the concept rather than the practice.

40|$|The {{structure}} of conditional correlations {{has important implications}} for numerous types of economic and financial decisions including optimal portfolio diversification and hedging and risk management. The different structures for conditional correlations in multivariate GARCH models that have been put forward warrant general specification tests to discriminate among competing models and obtain reliable inferences in empirical applications. This paper introduces a class of generally <b>applicable</b> <b>specification</b> tests for assessing the adequacy of both constant and dynamic structures of conditional correlations in multivariate GARCH models. The tests can identify linear and nonlinear misspecifications in conditional correlations. The tests are pure significance tests and are robust to the presence of time-varying higher-order conditional moments of unknown form. Our approach does not necessitate a particular parameter estimation method and distributional assumption on the error process. The asymptotic distribution of the tests is invariant to the uncertainty in parameter estimation. We assess the finite sample performance of our tests in the context of simulated data and an empirical application and, where applicable, compare our results with some existing tests for constant conditional correlation.

40|$|Tutorialpg. 205 - 224 Steam {{turbines}} first produced {{useful work}} {{well over a}} century ago. Their reliability, efficiency, and versatility are possibly the three man attributes that have contributed to their widespread utilization {{in a wide range}} of applications. Steam turbines can be found driving equipment ranging from generators, compressors, pumps, fans, and mills to the main propulsion units of marine vessels. They are employed in a variety of industries from utility, petrochemical, and mining to pulp and paper. Of the steam turbines employed in these industries, the most sophisticated and consequently challenging design is that which drives a synthesis-gas compressor of the type used in ammonia and methanol plants. Steam turbines that drive synthesis-gas compressors are required to operate at high speeds with high throttle flows and elevated inlet steam conditions. These turbines have condensing exhausts and often contain a controlled extraction that adds to bearing span and hence rotor flexibility. These features present unique challenges to the rotor and bearing design that must be carefully addressed to assure sound and reliable operation. For example, partial admission steam forces from the inlet and extraction sections can be large enough to affect bearing loading and, therefore, rotor response. Furthermore, the destabilizing forces from steam swirl in the high-pressure labyrinth seals and blade tip clearance leakage can be large enough to drive the rotor unstable. These issues are discussed along with other factors that must be considered in the design of a rotor for a high performance steam turbine. In the case study presented, the dynamic performance of the rotor was a prime consideration in establishing the main parameters of the design. Rotor geometries, such as bearing span, shaft diameter, wheel and overhung weight, along with the bearing and support structure properties, are parameters that can be varied to tune critical speeds in relation to the operating range and reduce response sensitivity to steam forces. The objective is to produce a design that not only complies with the requirements of any <b>applicable</b> <b>specifications,</b> but also one that has minimal dynamic sensitivity to external operational influences. Although the rotating component of a high performance steam turbine is reviewed, the analysis methodology presented can be used in the rotordynamics evaluation of all steam turbines. Furthermore, some of the features discussed can be incorporated into other steam turbine designs, as well as other types of turbomachinery...|$|E
40|$|The D-Zero Central Calorimeter Module Assembly is a {{segmented}} ring structure consisting of {{an assemblage of}} trapezoidal modules. It is housed inside a vessel containing liquid argon. The modules contain specialized equipment for use in particle physics experiments. The design review of the D-Zero Central Calorimeter Module Assembly evaluated all major structural elements for adequacy for their design loads. They were evaluated in accordance with <b>applicable</b> <b>specifications</b> from Reference 1. The allowable stresses of the Specifications provide an approximate safety factor of 2. 0 or more on failure and 1. 67 on serviceability of the structure. This margin is typical of buildings, bridges, and other large structures executed in steel. To the extent that calculated stresses are less than the allowable stresses, the margin is proportionately greater. For additional conservatism to account for inherent uncertainties in estimating design loads, an arbitrary load factor of 1. 25 was also applied. Design loads were calculated for deadwe 1 ghted plus thermal expansion, neglecting the effects of friction, and for deadweight only, considering postulated effects of friction. All of the major structural elements {{were found to be}} provisionally acceptable for their intended service and the predicted design loads. The provisions are as follows: (1) That the connect pins be fabricated of Inconel 718 or functional equivalent, instead of the originally specified Type 304 stainless steel; and (2) That conditions on bearing surfaces be modified to effectively reduce the potential coefficient of friction. The affected bearing interfaces include those between the CH, FH, and EM rings, and between the CH ring and its support members. The D-Zero Central Calorimeter Module Assembly is a {{segmented ring}} structure consisting of an assemblage of trapezoidal modules. It is housed inside a vessel containing liquid argon. The modules contain specialized equipment for use in particle physics experiments. The assembly design was reviewed to verify structural integrity and adequacy for service. Components that were evaluated were the main support beams, main support straps, module endplate brackets, module endplates, endplate connection pins, and transition pieces. Loading conditions considered were deadweight and differential thermal expansion due to specified temperature gradients. The American Institute of Steel Construction Specifications for The Design Fabrication and Erection of Structural Steel for Buildings Eighth Edition, referred to hereinafter as the AISC Specifications, were the primary acceptance criteria, where applicable.

40|$|In December 2008 Institute of Flight Guidance of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) {{installed}} a Ground Based Augmentation System (GBAS) manufactured by Thales Air Systems at the research airport Braunschweig-Wolfsburg in Germany. Since then, the Institute of Flight Guidance and other users have conducted many comprehensive experiments with this ground station throughout the GBAS research area. The ground station {{is part of}} the DLR air traffic validation center. It is not certified for official operations but is designed and developed according to all <b>applicable</b> <b>specifications.</b> In this setup, different flight inspection techniques were investigated with the station and new operational procedures were tested. Different aircraft were used for flight inspection as well as for operational procedure trials. This includes an Airbus A 320 research aircraft, a King Air 350 flight inspection aircraft as well as a Boeing 737 standard airliner or a Do- 128 research aircraft of the Technical University of Braunschweig. For a novel approach of verifying the contents of the GBAS message broadcast and the VHF coverage of the ground station, a helicopter (Bo- 105) was used for flight tests. Over the years, different upgrades of the GBAS ground stations were realized. This includes hardware upgrades as well as software upgrades. In terms of hardware, different GPS receivers were used as well different processor boards. The software was upgraded to not only support straight-in "ILS-look-alike"� Category I operations but also Terminal Area Paths (TAP), a functionality that allows curved path segments. In addition, prototypic software was installed to support Category II/III, so called GBAS Approach Service Type D (GAST-D) operations. Furthermore the TAP functionality will be used to transmit "Ground-TAPs"� to provide a highly accurate guidance for taxi operations during low visibility operations. Through Ground-TAPs taxi guidance is possible especially for pilots who are unfamiliar with the given airport or during adverse weather conditions. Different trials are planned to verify this idea in 2014. In this paper, a short overview about the different upgrades of the ground station as well as the operational GBAS research with the ground station will be given. This includes steep and segmented steep approaches based on GBAS and curved approaches as well as taxi operations using the TAP functionality. In addition, different performance reports of the station regarding position accuracy and VHF availability will be presented. Furthermore, the results of the helicopter flight trials regarding the VHF coverage with the low cost instrumentation will be shown and discussed in this work. To reduce integration costs, the VHF receiving equipment was integrated into a crate that was hooked as sling load to the helicopter's cargo hook. A VHF antenna was fitted onto the crate and the receiver equipment was battery powered inside the crate. With this setup, the VHF reception in the terminal area of the research airport was investigated. The VHF coverage was tested along the defined approach paths as well as symmetrically around the VHF Data Broadcast (VDB) antenna of the ground station...|$|E
