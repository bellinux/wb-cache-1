5|$|Languages evolve and diversify over time, and {{the history}} of their {{evolution}} can be reconstructed by comparing modern languages to determine which traits their ancestral languages must have had in order for the later developmental stages to occur. A group of languages that descend from a common ancestor is known as a language family. The Indo-European family is the most widely spoken and includes languages as diverse as English, Russian and Hindi; the Sino-Tibetan family, which includes Mandarin, Bodo and the other Chinese languages, and Tibetan; the Afro-Asiatic family, which includes Arabic, Somali, and Hebrew; the Bantu languages, which include Swahili, and Zulu, <b>and</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> languages spoken throughout Africa; and the Malayo-Polynesian languages, which include Indonesian, Malay, Tagalog, <b>and</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> languages spoken throughout the Pacific. The languages of the Dravidian family that are spoken mostly in Southern India include Tamil and Telugu. Academic consensus holds that between 50% and 90% of languages spoken {{at the beginning of the}} 21st century will probably have become extinct by the year 2100.|$|E
5|$|Japan's {{rapid advance}} south had been unexpected, and the {{perceived}} threat of invasion led to a major expansion of the Australian military. By mid-1942 the Army had a strength of ten infantry divisions, three armoured divisions <b>and</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> units. Thousands of Australians who were ineligible for service in the military responded {{to the threat of}} attack by joining auxiliary organisations such as the Volunteer Defence Corps and Volunteer Air Observers Corps, which were modelled on the British Home Guard and Royal Observer Corps respectively. However, Australia's population and industrial base were not sufficient to maintain these forces once the threat of invasion had passed, and the Army was progressively reduced in size from 1943.|$|E

5|$|The {{chief of}} {{construction}} of Auschwitz II-Birkenau was Karl Bischoff. Unlike his predecessor, {{he was a}} competent and dynamic bureaucrat who, {{in spite of the}} ongoing war, carried out the construction deemed necessary. The Birkenau camp, the four crematoria, a new reception building, <b>and</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> buildings were planned and constructed. Bischoff's plans called for each barrack to have an occupancy of 550 prisoners (one-third of the space allotted in other Nazi concentration camps). He later changed this to 744 prisoners per barrack. The SS designed the barracks not so much to house people as to destroy them.|$|E
5|$|In December 1843, Smith petitioned Congress to make Nauvoo an {{independent}} territory {{with the right}} to call out federal troops in its defense. Smith then wrote to the leading presidential candidates and asked them what they would do to protect the Mormons. After receiving noncommittal or negative responses, Smith announced his own independent candidacy for President of the United States, suspended regular proselytizing, and sent out the Quorum of the Twelve <b>and</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> political missionaries. In March 1844 — following a dispute with a federal bureaucrat — Smith organized the secret Council of Fifty. Smith said the Council had authority to decide which national or state laws Mormons should obey. The Council was also to select a site for a large Mormon settlement in Texas, California, or Oregon, where Mormons could live under theocratic law beyond other governmental control.|$|E
5|$|The {{perceived}} threat of invasion {{led to a}} major expansion of the Australian military. By mid-1942 the Army had a strength of ten infantry divisions, three armoured divisions <b>and</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> units. The RAAF and RAN were also greatly expanded, though it took years for these services to build up to their peak strengths. Due to the increased need for manpower, the restrictions which prohibited non-Europeans from joining the military ceased to be enforced from late 1941, and about 3000 Indigenous Australians eventually enlisted. Most of these personnel were integrated into existing formations, but {{a small number of}} racially segregated units such as the Torres Strait Light Infantry Battalion were formed. A number of small units made up of Indigenous Australians were also established to patrol northern Australia and harass any Japanese forces which landed there; the members of these units did not receive pay or awards for their service until 1992. Thousands of Australians who were ineligible for service in the military responded to the threat of attack by joining auxiliary organisations such as the Volunteer Defence Corps and Volunteer Air Observers Corps, which were modelled on the British Home Guard and Royal Observer Corps respectively. Australia's population and industrial base were not sufficient to maintain the expanded military after the threat of invasion had passed, and the Army was progressively reduced in size from 1943 while only 53 of the 73RAAF squadrons approved by the government were ever raised.|$|E

Although Sam is the demon's favorite, the super-strong Jake Talley becomes the winner. As Dean sells his soul to another demon in exchange for Sam's resurrection, Azazel gives Jake the Colt and coerces him to travel to a cemetery {{in the middle of a}} giant devil's trap. Though Sam and Dean, along with other hunters, attempt to stop him, Jake uses the Colt as a key to unlock a mausoleum there. This action briefly opens a gateway to Hell, releasing Lilith <b>and</b> <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> demons.
