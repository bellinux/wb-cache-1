5|$|Stuart McGurk of GQ {{considers}} Adams' <b>auburn</b> <b>hair,</b> porcelain skin, upturned nose, and her soft, earnest speaking {{style to}} be among her trademarks. She was {{named one of the}} most beautiful people in America by Elle in 2011, and several publications have featured her red carpet appearances in their listings of best-dressed celebrities.

60|$|Firmly {{snapping}} {{the door}} to, {{she crossed the}} corridor, with its gloomy, yellow-ochre walls, and its infinite vista of brown, numbered doors. The lift was going down; and wrapped to the ears in the high cloak, with every one of her <b>auburn</b> <b>hairs</b> in its place, she waited motionless for it to stop at her floor. The iron gates clanked open; she entered. There were already three occupants, {{a man in a}} great white waistcoat, with a large, smooth face like a baby's, and two old ladies in black, with mittened hands.|$|R

5|$|Turner was {{discovered}} in 1936 at the Top Hat Malt Shop in Hollywood, California. At the age of 16, she was signed to a personal contract by Warner Bros. director Mervyn LeRoy, who took her {{with him when he}} moved to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1938. Turner attracted attention in her first film, LeRoy's They Won't Forget (1937), and she later starred in featured roles, often as an ingenue. Her <b>auburn</b> <b>hair</b> was bleached blonde for a 1939 film at MGM, and she remained blonde {{for the rest of her}} life, except for a few film roles.|$|E

25|$|In 1948, Niven met Hjördis Paulina Tersmeden (née Genberg, 1919–1997), a {{divorced}} Swedish fashion model. He recounted their meeting:I {{had never seen}} anything so beautiful in my life—tall, slim, <b>auburn</b> <b>hair,</b> up-tilted nose, lovely mouth and the most enormous grey eyes I had ever seen. It really happened the way it does when written by the worst lady novelists... I goggled. I had difficulty swallowing and had champagne in my knees.|$|E

50|$|Some Dutch {{physical}} {{characteristics such as}} <b>auburn</b> and red <b>hair</b> among people in regions of south Taiwan are a consequence of this episode of Dutch women becoming concubines to the Chinese commanders. The Dutch women who were taken as slave concubines and wives were never freed. In 1684 some were reported {{to be living in}} captivity. A Dutch merchant in Quemoy was contacted with an arrangement, proposed by a son of Koxinga's, to release the prisoners, but it came to nothing.|$|R
25|$|On July 6, 1979, {{skeletal}} remains {{were found in}} a ravine off Calistoga Road approximately one hundred yards from where the body of Lori Lee Kursa had been recovered seven years earlier. Due {{to the age of}} the remains, authorities initially believed them to be those of Jeannette Kamahele until a comparison of dental records later proved negative. The victim had been hogtied and her arm fractured around the time of her murder but there was no other evidence to establish a cause of death. It was determined that the unidentified victim was approximately 19 years old, wore contact lenses, had red or <b>auburn</b> <b>hair</b> and at one time had broken a rib which was healed {{by the time of the}} murder.|$|E
500|$|These human remains, {{including}} body parts, tissues, and two partial torsos, totaled 13. All were unidentifiable, but one partial torso {{was that}} of a Caucasian woman as indicated by <b>auburn</b> <b>hair</b> on a partial skull, and one partial body was of an Asian child (with glass embedded). There was no luggage recovered. Of the non-human remains that the Japanese recovered were various items including dentures, newspapers, seats, books, eight KAL paper cups, shoes, sandals, and sneakers, a camera case, a [...] "please fasten seat belt" [...] sign, an oxygen mask, a handbag, a bottle of dish washing fluid, several blouses, an identity card belonging to 25-year-old passenger Mary Jane Hendrie of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada, and the business card of passenger Kathy Brown-Spier. These items generally came from the passenger cabin of an aircraft. None of the items found generally came from the cargo hold of a plane, such as suitcases, packing boxes, industrial machinery, instruments, and sports equipment.|$|E
500|$|After Kapadia's {{separation}} from Khanna in 1982, she was keen on returning to acting, which she ultimately did in 1984. For the next decade, {{she would go}} on to become one of top five commercial actresses in Bollywood along with Sridevi, Madhuri Dixit, Meenakshi Sheshadri and Jaya Prada. Kapadia accredited the reason for her return was because of a personal need to prove to herself her own capabilities. The first film she worked on was Saagar, directed by Ramesh Sippy, after a mutual friend had notified Sippy about her willingness to return to acting. She first performed a screen test, which according to her was very unsuccessful as she was extremely nervous and [...] "literally shivering" [...] while making it. To her surprise, Sippy ultimately signed her on to play the lead part opposite her Bobby co-star Rishi Kapoor. Scripted with her in mind, the film was intended to be her comeback vehicle, but its one-year delay meant that several of her proceeding projects would be released before, the first of which was Zakhmi Sher (1984). Saagar eventually premiered in August 1985 and was controversial for several scenes featuring Kapadia, including one scene in which she was seen topless for a split second. The film was a critical success and was eventually chosen as India's official entry to the Oscars that year. Kapadia's performance as Mona D'Silva, a young woman from Goa who is torn between her friend (Kamal Haasan) and the man she loves (Kapoor), won her a second Best Actress award at the Filmfare Awards. A review by Asiaweek labelled her [...] "a delight". Rediff.com noted, [...] "Dimple, caught between a friend and lover, performed solidly and memorably, grounding the two male leads and making the film work." [...] A 1993 issue of India Today wrote, [...] "Saagar was in many ways a paean to her incredible beauty. She looked ravishing: <b>auburn</b> <b>hair,</b> classical face, deep eyes, an aura of sensuality. It was clear she was back." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dreyer {{was born}} in Tromsø, Norway, on December 26, 1877. He {{was the son of}} Hans Dreyer and his wife Regina Dreyer (née Mikkelsdatter). He grew to become a tall man, of slender build, and had blue eyes and <b>auburn</b> brown <b>hair.</b> After {{schooling}} at the Latin School in Tromsø, he attended the Royal School of Art and Industries in Oslo. [...] His first sculpture was in snow, of an old professor, which everyone recognized. So even though he had started in drawing and painting at the Royal Academy, he saw (and others recognized) that his true gifts were modeling and sculpting. [...] He continued studies with Stephan Sinding, one of the greatest of European sculptors. Dreyer modeled a bust of an Ibsen character, which Ibsen saw at a school exhibition. [...] Ibsen sought out Dreyer and complimented him in person.|$|R
60|$|He {{had ever}} {{a word of}} {{commendation}} and encouragement for his troops, and was regarded by them as a comrade {{as well as a}} leader. In person he was tall and rather stout, his face was handsome, his complexion fair, his forehead lofty, his <b>hair</b> <b>auburn,</b> his eyes large and penetrating, his cheeks ruddy and healthy. He had an air of majesty which enabled him to address his soldiers in terms of cheerful familiarity without in the slightest degree diminishing their respect and reverence for him as their monarch.|$|R
5000|$|Lee Clark: Lee is {{the oldest}} at 13 and {{considered}} the strongest one. He is very athletic and the most powerful spy in the group. While his two brothers share funny and immature traits, Lee is part big brother/part father figure. Nothing {{is more important than}} his siblings that he would do anything to protect them. His spy suit and his MPCom are red. He is also the jet pilot and is often shown to be claustrophobic. In addition, he has a habit of going crazy over girls, which is similar to Clover's boy craziness. In his normal appearance, Lee has <b>auburn</b> colored <b>hair</b> that seems to be in the style of a flat top. He has pale blue (sometimes grey) eyes, wears a red short sleeved shirt with a white [...] "W" [...] on it, burgundy colored pants, red shoes, and a red and white wrist band. He is currently working part-time at a restaurant called Siber Smoothie. He is studying in the 8th grade. He is voiced by Andrew Sabiston.|$|R
500|$|The finale {{introduces}} parallel-universe {{versions of}} familiar characters, including the Fauxlivia version of Olivia Dunham, both played by actress Anna Torv. One {{topic of conversation}} among fans, journalists, and those working on the show was what to call the alternate Olivia to differentiate the two. Names varied, with many using [...] "Fauxlivia", [...] "Bolivia", and/or [...] "Altlivia". The writers chose Fauxlivia because {{a character in a}} season three episode referred to her as such. Torv and Akiva Goldsman discussed various ways to differentiate the two depictions of Olivia; ultimately two different physical demeanors were created. Torv wanted to make the new character [...] "completely different", but she and Goldsman recognized that the two share some major similarities, as they both are in the same profession and are [...] "fundamentally, genetically really the same person." [...] According to Torv, Fauxlivia holds herself differently and has [...] "a different silhouette. She's got a little firefighter, a little military in her." [...] Torv further explained, [...] "Olivia wants to be the best, but [...] just wants to win;" [...] "There's just a front-footedness I think to , simply because she just doesn't carry {{the weight of the world}} on her shoulders like Olivia does. Olivia's mum died when she was really little, and 's mum is still around. There's lots of little, subtle differences." [...] The producers discussed cutting her hair, but ultimately decided on the <b>auburn</b> <b>hair</b> color to differentiate her. They also made her [...] "a little bit more playful". Pinkner describes shooting the Fauxlivia scenes in the DVD audio commentary: [...] "When [...] first showed up on set in this different guise, she had really embodied this other character in a very playful and sexy way. She turned a lot of heads." [...] Goldsman remarked that Torv's depiction of Fauxlivia was actually much closer to the actress' real personality than her performance as Olivia. The producers were so pleased with her Fauxlivia depiction that they thought [...] "it really opened up a bunch of possibilities... it went from 'let's see if this experiment works' to 'how can we get more of this? ...|$|E

2500|$|Hastings has a {{soft spot}} for auburn-haired women. Back in The Mysterious Affair at Styles, Hastings was charmed with auburn-haired Cynthia Murdoch and {{proposed}} to her. This would become a running gag in the series, with Poirot often teasing Hastings. Whenever Hastings suggests the innocence of a young, beautiful, female murder suspect, Poirot slyly asks [...] "Does she have auburn hair?" [...] This pronounced weakness for pretty women with <b>auburn</b> <b>hair</b> gets Hastings and Poirot into trouble more than once: in The Big Four, while posing as secretary for millionaire Abe Ryland, Hastings trusts false information from a woman with <b>auburn</b> <b>hair,</b> while in the short story Double Sin, Hastings believes auburn-haired Mary Durant.|$|E
25|$|Some Dutch {{physical}} features like <b>auburn</b> and red <b>hair</b> among people in regions of south Taiwan are {{a consequence of}} this episode when Dutch women became concubines of the Chinese commanders. The Chinese took Dutch women as slave concubines and wives and they were never freed: in 1684 some were reportedly still living, in Quemoy a Dutch merchant was contacted and an arrangement to release the prisoners was proposed by a son of Koxinga but it came to nothing. The Chinese officers used the Dutch women who they received as concubines. The Dutch women were used for sexual pleasure by Koxinga's commanders. This event in which Dutch women were distributed to the Chinese soldiers and commanders was recorded in the daily journal of the fort.|$|R
5000|$|She {{worked with}} Rita Hayworth before the latter became a star. According to some sources, it was Hunt {{who came up}} with the idea to dye Hayworth's black <b>hair</b> <b>auburn.</b> She also {{arranged}} for the painful, lengthy electrolysis that raised Hayworth's hairline. For the 1946 film noir Gilda, Hunt stated, [...] "I got fan mail - and hate mail - about Rita's hair! Some clergymen declared that I would go to hell for contributing to evil because of Rita's hair in Gilda!" [...] When Orson Welles insisted on shortening the actress's long hair (and dyeing it blonde) for The Lady from Shanghai (1947), Hunt was flown in from New York, where she was on her honeymoon, to do the cutting.|$|R

The reader is desired to mark this Monk. A personable man of seven-and-forty; stout-made, stands erect as a pillar; with bushy eyebrows, the eyes of him beaming into you in a really strange way; the face massive, grave, with 'a very eminent nose;' his head almost bald, its <b>auburn</b> remnants of <b>hair,</b> and the copious ruddy beard, getting slightly streaked with gray.
