5|$|Messiaen used modes {{he called}} modes of limited transposition. They are {{distinguished}} as groups of notes {{that can only}} be transposed by a semitone a limited number of times. For example, the whole-tone scale (Messiaen's Mode 1) only exists in two transpositions: namely C–D–E–F–G–A and D–E–F–G–A–B. Messiaen <b>abstracted</b> these modes from the harmony of his improvisations and early works. Music written using the modes avoids conventional diatonic harmonic progressions, since for example Messiaen's Mode 2 (identical to the octatonic scale used also by other composers) permits precisely the dominant seventh chords whose tonic the mode does not contain.|$|E

5|$|Several critics {{detect a}} crisis in public {{memorial}} style from 1945, when the traditional figurative symbolic language, and evocation of nationalist values, came to seem inadequate, especially in relation to genocide, {{at least on the}} Western side of the Iron Curtain. In the Communist East the established style of Socialist Realism was still considered appropriate, at least by the authorities. The generation of <b>abstracted</b> and conceptual war and Holocaust memorials erected in the West from the 1990s onwards seems finally to have found a resolution for these issues.|$|E
5|$|The river {{flows through}} the South Downs National Park, and is a {{designated}} Site of Nature Conservation Importance, in recognition of its value for wildlife. It supports {{a wide range of}} fish, and its upper reaches are the only location in Sussex where native white clawed crayfish can be found. The quality of the water is generally good, and the river is measured at four gauging stations, three on the main channel, and one of the River Lod, just before its junction with the Rother. Water from the underlying Lower Greensand aquifer and the adjacent chalk aquifer helps to maintain the flows during the summer months, despite the fact that large volumes are <b>abstracted</b> from both the aquifers and the river for the public water supply.|$|E

40|$|The {{month of}} Ramadan, {{as a model}} of {{intermittent}} fasting, is a valuable opportunity to investigate the effects of dietary modifications on human metabolism. Fasting improves insulin sensitivity, reduces atherogenic risk, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Inflammation {{plays a key role in}} the pathogenesis of different disorders including atherosclerosis, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases. Ramadan fasting can positively modulate cardiovascular risks and improves the metabolic syndrome features through suppression of inflammatory responses. In this review we attempt to present recent studies that addressed the regulatory role(s) of this nutritional status on inflammation in patients with inflammatory diseases. These studies suggest that the anti-inflammatory effect of fasting is significant and could be considered as a complementary therapeutic approach in treatment of inflammatory disorders in patients.

Entirely new areas of mathematics such as mathematical logic, topology, and John von Neumann's game theory changed {{the kinds of questions}} that could be answered by mathematical methods. All kinds of structures were <b>abstracted</b> using axioms and given names like metric spaces, topological spaces etc. As mathematicians do, the concept of an abstract structure was itself <b>abstracted</b> and led to category theory. Grothendieck and Serre recast algebraic geometry using sheaf theory. Large advances were made in the qualitative study of dynamical systems that Poincaré had begun in the 1890s.|$|E
25|$|Georgia has {{abundant}} water resources.

Despite the abundance of water resources, the Eastern part of Georgia is relatively dry and is regularly affected by droughts.

The river, which flows from Georgia to Azerbaijan, is increasingly polluted downstream of Tbilisi.|$|E

25|$|In 1922, Miró {{explored}} <b>abstracted,</b> strongly coloured surrealism in {{at least}} one painting. From the summer of 1923 in Mont-roig, Miró began a key set of paintings where <b>abstracted</b> pictorial signs, rather than the realistic representations used in The Farm, are predominant. In The Tilled Field, Catalan Landscape (The Hunter) and Pastoral (1923–24), these flat shapes and lines (mostly black or strongly coloured) suggest the subjects, sometimes quite cryptically. For Catalan Landscape (The Hunter), Miró represents the hunter with a combination of signs: a triangle for the head, curved lines for the moustache, angular lines for the body. So encoded is this work that at a later time Miró provided a precise explanation of the signs used.|$|E
