When the verse starts, Usher goes to a wide glass window pane, looking at his girlfriend swimming in the pool. The surface is aflame after she is immersed in the water. In the next scene, Usher and his mistress are having sex. While {{sitting on the edge}} of the bed, Usher reminisces about the moments he and his girlfriend had have in the same bed. The bedsheets burn, the scene then cutting to Usher riding a silver right-hand drive Aston Martin DB5 with a British registration - EGF 158B (the car was featured in the TV series Fastlane). The video cuts with the backdrop also burning. Continuing to the car scene, Usher stops <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> his imaginary girl again. He and dances, executing various hand routines. Video intercuts follow and the video ends with Usher standing. Right before the last chorus, the screen changes from a small screen to a full one with no framework.|$|E

In addition to working with synthesizers and other electronic instruments, Vangelis also works with and conducts orchestras.

25|$|In {{the hours}} after Hades and Zelena return to Storybrooke, Zelena {{goes off to}} find the others and leaves the baby with Hades. While she is gone, King Arthur, who just escaped from the jail and is being tracked down by Mary Margaret, Merida and the dwarves, stumbles upon Hades, but he kills Arthur <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> him as a threat. Zelena finds Regina and Robin Hood and tries to {{convince}} them that Hades has changed his ways. Emma, David and Henry are reunited with Snow and Merida and explain the details of Hades' deception but Emma's vengeance against Hades is making her too emotional. Zelena and Hades are talking about the others not believing that he changed. Hades gets a weapon, known as the Olympian Crystal (Zeus's thunderbolt), which can kill anybody, even a god. He also suggests that they leave Storybrooke but Zelena is not so sure if she wants to.

25|$|In {{the late}} antique Testament of Solomon, Abyzou (as Obizuth) is {{described}} as having a “greenish gleaming face with dishevelled serpent-like hair”; {{the rest of her}} body is covered by darkness. The speaker (“King Solomon”) encounters a series of demons, binds and tortures each in turn, and inquires into their activities; then he metes out punishment or controls them <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> fit. Put to the test, Abyzou says that she does not sleep, but rather wanders the world looking for women about to give birth; given the opportunity, she will strangle newborns. She claims also to be the source of many other afflictions, including deafness, eye trouble, obstructions of the throat, madness, and bodily pain. Solomon orders that she be chained by her own hair and hung {{up in front of the}} Temple in public view. The writer of the Testament appears to have been thinking of the gorgoneion, or the icon of the Medusa’s head, which often adorned Greek temples and occasionally Jewish synagogues in late antiquity.|$|E

[...] Before Lord Byrne is able to secure the promotion Jac wanted from him, he dies from complications arising from a perforated stomach ulcer. When Jac attends his funeral in the episode [...] "Bad Reputation", a furious Joseph slaps her and leaves her badly bruised. [...] Jac continues to torment Joseph for several weeks, and flaunts the fact she inherited a ring in Lord Byrne's will {{that had once been}} promised to Joseph by his grandmother. His friend and colleague Faye Morton takes it upon herself to steal the ring, and returns it to Joseph to do with <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> fit, in the hopes that this will allow him to move on.|$|E
500|$|Continuation Bond author Raymond Benson {{notes that}} two of the stories ("Quantum of Solace" [...] and [...] "The Hildebrand Rarity") are {{experimental}} for Fleming, whilst the remaining three are straightforward Bond adventures. In the two experimental stories Bond is given something of a more human side, with [...] "Quantum of Solace" [...] evidencing Bond's reaction to the Governor's story by showing a compassionate side, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> the real life of Philip Masters and Rhoda Llewellyn as being more dramatic than his recent mission; the forthcoming trip he has to make to the CIA, he now sees as [...] "dull and unexciting". In [...] "The Hildebrand Rarity", Bond is also shown with a humanitarian side, with feelings for the plight of Liz at the hands of her husband and {{for the use of the}} poison on the fish by Milton Krest.|$|E

500|$|Alaina Huffman {{auditioned for}} Smallville without {{being aware of}} which role was being cast, and was offered the part of Dinah Lance/Black Canary. When the {{producers}} informed her of how major this character is to the DC mythology, Huffman used various comic books and online sources {{to learn more about}} her character. Approached by the producers, Phil Morris auditioned twice for the role of John Jones/Martian Manhunter, and then waited three weeks before receiving confirmation of the role. Morris relished the new design of the character, stepping away from the cape and tights, and going with a more contemporary look. He classified John Jones as Jor-El's [...] "tool, security force, his guardian, and his protector". The actor has stated that he would like his character to lead the future Justice League on the show, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> John Jones as a natural leader.|$|E

The [...] "toilet" [...] {{turns out to be a}} time machine, and Mort is sent to the past. Realizing that Mort does not have a return pad that would be able to bring him back to the present, Stewie and Brian take one of the return pads and go back in time to save Mort. They end up in Warsaw, Poland and find Mort in a synagogue. He believes he is in Heaven <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> dead family members there. It does not take long for them to realize that the date is September 1, 1939, the day of the Nazi invasion of Poland and when World War II started.|$|E
500|$|Early in the film, Warden Norton quotes Jesus Christ to {{describe}} himself to Andy, saying, [...] "I am {{the light of}} the world," [...] declaring himself Andy's savior. However, this description can also reference Lucifer, the bearer of light. Indeed, the warden does not enforce the general rule of law, but chooses to enforce his own rules and punishments <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> fit, becoming a law unto himself, like the behavior of Satan. The warden has also been compared to former United States President Richard Nixon. Andy's incarceration between 1946 and 1966 (1947 and 1975 in the novel), largely overlaps with Nixon's presidency which ended in disgrace. Norton's appearance and public addresses can be seen to mirror Nixon's. Similarly, Norton projects an image of a Holy man, speaking down sanctimoniously to the servile masses while running corrupt scams, the like of which made Nixon infamous.|$|E

500|$|The Athsheans, in contrast, {{are shown}} as an {{innately}} peaceful and non-aggressive people, {{at least at}} the beginning of novel. Rape and murder are virtually unknown on the planet. They have adopted a number of behaviors that preempt violence; thus when Selver has Davidson pinned down after the attack on Smith camp, he finds himself unable to kill Davidson, despite the hate he feels towards the Terran. Selver spends much of the novel reflecting on the effect that violence has on his own culture. He turns to violence, against the Athshean ethic, in order to save his culture <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> it. However, unlike Davidson, who enjoys killing, Selver sees it as something poisoning his culture. This perception is shared by his fellow Athsheans: one of the elders of the Athsheans says to Selver [...] "You've done what you had to do, and it was not right." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout the song, {{the narrator}} {{addresses}} an unidentified girl, asking [...] "When {{will you come}} with me", and lamenting {{the fact that she}} laughs at him for having nothing to his name. He tells her he wants to give her his hopes and bring her freedom, that [...] "the earth is turning under your feet" [...] and [...] "the waters of life are flowing free", yet she persists in scorning him. He asks why she laughs at the pack he carries on his back, and he wonders why he keeps on going, with nothing to his name. At last, he tells her that he has waited for a long time, and that this is his final plea: he wants to grab her by the hands, to [...] "take you away with me". <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> her hands tremble, and her eyes [...] "overflow with tears", he asks her, [...] "Do you really mean to tell me, you love me as I am?" ...|$|E
500|$|The game {{opens with}} Rush running through a forest, {{trying to find}} his sister Irina, who the player later learns has been kidnapped.

After he generates a powerful shield with his Remnant pendant, he is interrogated by David and his generals, who decide to help him find Irina. When investigating a Remnant that is about to collapse, Rush and company come across Wagram and Irina, who escape. After chasing Wagram and Irina for several missions, the group attends the Congress meeting {{of the leaders of}} the city-states in Elysion, home to the Ark Remnant, which can transport users to the Sacred Lands. The city is also home to the Academy, a research institution devoted to studying Remnants and the place where Rush's parents work. The Conqueror arrives at the Congress, binds the Ark and demands to be given a massive Remnant of the type that each city-state has. After finding only Rush's mother, the group learns that the Conqueror, with his demands rejected, has started a war and is marching his army with the support of the [...] "God-Emperor", a 1000-year-old legendary figure.|$|E

500|$|Goodman sees {{schools as}} {{mechanisms}} for adjusting youth to an automated society increasingly absent [...] "any human values". Goodman disagrees {{with those who}} say public schools teach middle class values, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> schools as more petit bourgeois than bourgeois, favoring [...] "bureaucratic, time-serving, grade-grind-practical, timid, and nouveau riche climbing" [...] over [...] "independence, initiative, scrupulous honesty, earnestness, utility, [...] respect for thorough scholarship". In this way, schooling {{is not a good}} use of student time, and students are right to quit and avoid the psychological and professional damage. More important is the disintegration of social class segregation. Goodman then asserts that lower- and middle-class kids would be better off without public or any schooling altogether. He proposes several alternatives to formal schooling, such as divvying up the high school's public funds directly amongst its students, and advocates for a variety of experimental school alternatives: [...] "no school at all, the real city as school, farm schools, practical apprenticeships, guided travel, work camps, little theaters and local newspapers, [...] community service". Other proposals include making class non-compulsory (such that attendance will reflect student interest without [...] "trapping" [...] children), requiring students to wait two years before applying to the most elite colleges, eliminating grades so the burden of testing for required skills falls on companies, and letting students quit and resume freely. He proposes Danish folk school-style education for those uninterested in academics. Goodman's foremost intention was to stimulate new educational paradigms. He acknowledges that his specific proposals may be unpopular or ignored.|$|E
