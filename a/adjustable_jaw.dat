25|$|The pipe wrench, or Stillson wrench, is an {{adjustable}} wrench used for turning soft iron {{pipes and fittings}} with a rounded surface. The design of the <b>adjustable</b> <b>jaw</b> allows it to rock in the frame, such that any forward pressure on the handle tends to pull the jaws tighter together. Teeth angled {{in the direction of}} turn dig into the soft pipe. The pipe wrench was invented by Daniel C. Stillson in 1869.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of pipe cutters. Plastic tubing cutters, which really look much like a pair of pruning shears, may be used for thinner pipes and tubes, such as {{sprinkler}} pipe. For use on thicker pipes, there is a pipecutter with a sharp wheel and <b>adjustable</b> <b>jaw</b> grips. These are used by rotating it around the pipe and repeatedly tightening it until it cuts all of the way through.|$|E
50|$|The {{pipe wrench}} (US), Stillson wrench or Stillsons (UK) is an {{adjustable}} wrench/spanner used for turning soft iron {{pipes and fittings}} with a rounded surface. The design of the <b>adjustable</b> <b>jaw</b> allows it to lock in the frame, such that any forward pressure on the handle tends to pull the jaws tighter together. Teeth angled {{in the direction of}} turn dig into the soft pipe. They are not intended for use on hardened steel hex nuts or other fittings because they would ruin the head; however, if a hex nut is soft enough that it becomes rounded beyond use with standard wrenches, a pipe wrench is sometimes used to break the bolt or nut free. Pipe wrenches are usually sold in the following sizes (by length of handle): 10, 12, 14, 18, 24, 36, and 48 inches, although smaller and larger sizes are available as well. They are usually made of cast steel. Today, aluminium is also used to construct the body of the wrench, while the teeth and jaw remain steel. Teeth, and jaw kits (which also contain adjustment rings and springs) can be bought to repair broken wrenches, as this is cheaper than buying a new wrench.|$|E
40|$|Welded steel clamps {{securely}} grip {{structural shapes}} {{of various sizes}} for crane operations. The clamp has <b>adjustable</b> clamping <b>jaws</b> and screw-operated internal v-jaws and provides greater safety than hoisting slings presently used. The structural member can be rotated in any manner, angle, or direction without being released by the clamp...|$|R
50|$|The game is notable, {{among other}} things, for the <b>adjustable</b> armored <b>jaws</b> of the player's spacecraft. Opening the invincible jaws {{of the ship}} {{increases}} {{the spread of the}} player's shots but exposes the vulnerable cockpit. Obtaining one weapon upgrade allows the ship's jaws to be set half-way open (a 3-shot spread) or closed (with increased damage), and a second upgrade allows them to be closed, half open, or fully open (a 5 shot spread).|$|R
40|$|GWPD 4 —Measuring {{water levels}} {{by use of}} an {{electric}} tape VERSION: 2010. 1 PURPOSE: To measure the depth to the water surface below land-surface datum using the electric tape method. Materials and Instruments 1. An electric tape, double-wired and graduated in feet, tenths and hundredths of feet. Electric tapes commonly are mounted on a hand-cranked and powered supply reel that contains space for the batteries and some device (“indicator”) for signaling when the circuit is closed (fig. 1). 2. An older model electric tape, also known as an “M-scope, ” marked at 5 -foot intervals with clamped-on metal bands (fig. 2) {{has been replaced by}} newer, more accurate models. Technical procedures for this device are available from the procedures document archives. 3. A steel reference tape for calibration, graduated in feet, tenths and hundredths of feet 4. Electric tape calibration and maintenance equipment logbook 5. Pencil or pen, blue or black ink. Strikethrough, date, and initial errors; no erasures 6. Water-level measurement field form, or handheld computer for data entry 7. Two wrenches with <b>adjustable</b> <b>jaws</b> or other tools for removing well cap 8. Key for well acces...|$|R
40|$|GWPD 1 —Measuring {{water levels}} {{by use of}} a {{graduated}} steel tape VERSION: 2010. 1 PURPOSE: To measure the depth to the water surface below land-surface datum using the graduated steel tape (wetted-tape) method. Materials and Instruments 1. A steel tape graduated in feet, tenths and hundredths of feet. A black tape is preferred to a chromium-plated tape. If a chromium-plated tape is used, paint {{the back of the}} tape with a flat black paint to make reading the wetted chalk mark easier. A break-away weight should be attached to a ring {{on the end of the}} tape with wire strong enough to hold the weight, but not as strong as the tape, so that if the weight becomes lodged in the well the tape can still be pulled free. The weight should be made of brass, stainless steel, or iron. Lead weights are not acceptable. 2. Blue carpenter’s chalk. 3. Clean rag. 4. Pencil or pen, blue or black ink. Strikethrough, date, and initial errors; no erasures. 5. Water-level measurement field form, or handheld computer for data entry. 6. Two wrenches with <b>adjustable</b> <b>jaws</b> or other tools for removing well cap. 7. Cleaning supplies for water-level tapes as described in the National Field Manual (Wilde, 2004). 8.

5000|$|The type of {{straight}} <b>adjustable</b> spanner with <b>jaws</b> {{at right angles}} to the handle shown here as an [...] "English Key" [...] is mainly called a [...] "King Dick" [...] spanner in the United Kingdom because of a popular British brand of small, handy and reliable adjustable spanner used throughout the 1900s and used in great numbers during World War II.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The test {{equipment}} of samples {{for analysis of}} rubber-textile conveyor belts is a device designed to create tension and tracking the deformation in different cross sections of conveyor belts in one axis X. This construction is designed tensioning device, which allows the development of automatic tensioning force in one axis X-tensioning force F is exerted screw the nut with a torque wrench and a controlled strain-gauge sensor. Measured sample-textile conveyor belt is clamped in two <b>adjustable</b> clamping <b>jaws</b> ribbed belts for different thicknesses. Ribbed clamping jaws {{on one side of}} the tensioning device is attached to the frame and on the other hand are attached to the runner associated with the movable tensioning screw...|$|R
