In recent years waste and general environmental issues {{have become an}} <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>prime</b> <b>concern</b> for national governments, policymakers and local communities. However, research on waste management has largely ignored the role of individual attitudes and actions, preferring to concentrate on technical or scientific solutions to waste management problems. Many of the waste management policies adopted in Ireland focus on the provision of information about waste and the environment in general {{with the assumption that}} the public will absorb this information and change their behaviour accordingly. However, this thesis proposes that waste management behaviour is affected by more than just information and that a gap (commonly referred to as the value-action gap) exists between individuals? attitudes and actions towards waste...|$|E
40|$|Maternal {{health is}} an <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>prime</b> <b>concern</b> in India. National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) has fast {{forwarded}} the progress in improving maternal health through initiatives like promoting institutional deliveries and improving access to reproductive health services etc. However, glaring differences exist between different states and {{also among the}} districts within each state. In Odisha, even though overall picture indicates {{that the state is}} on the road-map to achieve the target for institutional deliveries, a lot more is desired in some of its most backward districts like Kalahandi, Balangir, Koraput (KBK). Some of the challenges include geographical inaccessibility, poor quality of care, female illiteracy, and huge tribal population. However, central and state sponsored initiatives are contributing significantly in improving this situation. Initiatives of policy makers need to be supplemented with need based research and critical analysis of district level data. Here, academic institutes through active collaborations can assume leadership role. Besides focussing on achieving the targets for institutional deliveries, there is need {{to improve the quality of}} care particularly in hard to reach areas...|$|E
40|$|IP over wavelength-division {{multiplexing}} (WDM) {{networks have}} been identified as promising candidates to underpin future telecommunication networks and thus industrial and academic researchers have been actively investigating key issues that affect the integration of IP and optical layers. An <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>prime</b> <b>concern</b> is network survivability. The main challenges within this domain are: to provide survivability schemes under different failure scenarios and {{to reduce the amount of}} required spare capacity while providing the required quality of service (QoS). Due to its flexibility and simplicity, one candidate technique is pre-allocated restoration. In this paper, the performance of pre-allocated restoration mechanisms are investigated considering a distributed GMPLS-based IP/WDM mesh network under single and dual-link failure scenarios. Several issues are considered. Firstly, two proposed spare capacity allocation schemes are investigated; link partitioning and lightpath partitioning. Secondly, the paper evaluates a retrial scheme that supports the utilisation of spare capacity. Thirdly, proposed class prioritisation scheme applied to the differentiated survivability concept with pre-allocated restoration is investigated. Finally, two load-based spare capacity optimisation schemes are proposed and evaluated; local spare capacity optimisation (LSCO) and global spare capacity optimisation (GSCO) ...|$|E

40|$|The lack of {{knowledge}} about the behaviour of footings for jack-up rigs under storm loads poses a design problem which can be tackled by model testing. The <b>areas</b> <b>of</b> <b>prime</b> <b>concern</b> are the ultimate loads on footings under combined loading, which affects the safety of the rig, and the rotational stiffness, which affects the interaction between the foundation and the structure. A programme of loading tests was performed on model footings on clay, and was divided into two stages: monotonic loading and cyclic loading. The clay samples were obtained by consolidating Speswhite kaolin slurry in cylindrical tanks 450 mm in diameter. The strength and compressibility characteristics of the samples were verified by means of standard laboratory tests. The model footings were 50 mm and 100 mm in diameter and several shapes were tested: circular flat plate, cones of various angles and model spud-cans. Loads and displacements were monitored using appropriate instrumentation and a data logger. A series of central vertical loading tests provided data for comparison with existing bearing capacity theories. Combined loading tests were performed applying a displacement controlled horizontal load at a fixed height above the footing which was also subjected to a fixed vertical load. The main series of tests involved a parametric study of the relevant variables. Special tests allowed the assessment of the effect of embedment of the footing and the interaction of a flexible leg with the foundation. Cyclic loading tests were carried out using a load controlled system which applied a sinusoidal load simulating wave action. Effects of currents were investigated by introducing an offset to the loading cycle. The influence of amplitude and period of loading as well as the influence of vertical load were also investigated. Special tests were carried out to cover some peculiarities of real loading conditions. Fitting of a three-parameter hyperbola to the test results provided a systematic and accurate method of analysis of monotonic loading tests, leading to valuable information involving stiffness and ultimate loads. Analysis of cyclic loading tests yielded useful qualitative information regarding the progress of settlement and the variation of rotational stiffness and damping ratio with the number of cycles...|$|R
40|$|Background: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a gram-negative {{pathogen}} {{is commonly}} associated with nosocomial infections. Infections caused by P. aeruginosa can range from superficial skin infections to fulminant sepsis. Antimicrobial resistance is an <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>prime</b> <b>concern</b> in pseudomonal infections. The objective {{of the study was}} to evaluate and analyse the antibiotic susceptibility pattern of P. aeruginosa at a tertiary care hospital in South India. Methods: The study was carried out at Kasturba Medical College and Hospital, Manipal, India from January 2011 to December 2011. Ten different types of specimens were collected from patients who were culture positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Antibiotic susceptibility was confirmed by disk diffusion technique on Muller-Hinton medium and was performed according to the Clinical Laboratory Standard Institute (CLSI) guidelines. Results: Out of 200 samples of P. aeruginosa 69. 5 % and 30. 5 % were from male and female patients respectively. Majority of the specimen from which P. aeruginosa was isolated consisted of sputum, pus and urine. Among the antimicrobial drugs tested, organism was most sensitive to carbapenems (77. 5 %), piperacillin-tazobactam (77 %) and cefoperazone-sulbactam (72 %). Resistance rates were high for fluoroquinolones (FQs) (43. 5 %), gentamicin (40. 5 %), tobramycin (40. 5 %), ticarcillin-clavulanic acid (39 %) and aztreonam (38 %) when compared to cefepime (31. 5 %), ceftazidime (32. 5 %), netilmicin (34. 5 %) and amikacin (35 %). Conclusions: Carbapenems and piperacillin-tazobactam were the best antipseudomonal agents with highest sensitivity to P. aeruginosa. FQs, gentamicin and tobramycin were the least effective drugs against P. aeruginosa as monotherapy. [Int J Basic Clin Pharmacol 2016; 5 (4. 000) : 1311 - 1314...|$|E
40|$|Resource {{management}} {{has always been}} an <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>prime</b> <b>concern</b> for the organizations. Out of all the resources human resource has been most difficult to plan, utilize and manage. Therefore, in the recent past {{there has been a lot}} of research thrust on the managing the human resource. Studies have revealed that even best of the Information Systems do fail due to neglect of the human resource. In this paper an attempt has been made to identify most important human resource factors and propose a diagnostic model based on the back-propagation and connectionist model approaches of artificial neural network (ANN). The focus of the study is on the mobile -communication industry of India. The ANN based approach is particularly important because conventional approaches (such as algorithmic) to the problem solving have their inherent disadvantages. The algorithmic approach is well-suited to the problems that are well-understood and known solution(s). On the other hand the ANNs have learning by example and processing capabilities similar to that of a human brain. ANN has been followed due to its inherent advantage over conversion algorithmic like approaches and having capabilities, training and human like intuitive decision making capabilities. Therefore, this ANN based approach is likely to help researchers and organizations to reach a better solution to the problem of managing the human resource. The study is particularly important as many studies have been carried in developed countries but there is a shortage of such studies in developing nations like India. Here, a model has been derived using connectionist-ANN approach and improved and verified via back-propagation algorithm. This suggested ANN based model can be used for testing the success and failure human factors in any of the communication Industry. Results have been obtained on the basis of connectionist model, which has been further refined by BPNN to an accuracy of 99. 99 %. Any company to predict failure due to HR factors can directly deploy this model...|$|E
30|$|Urbanization {{is taking}} place in the world with much faster rates than ever before. Today, more than 54  % of the world’s total {{population}} is living in cities, and an estimated 66  % of it will occupy urban areas by the year 2025 (UN 2014). In comparison {{to the rest of the}} world, 46  % of the total population of Asia is living in urban areas. Pakistan is not far behind in urban population with 35  % of its population living in the cities and towns. The urban proportion of the population in Pakistan is the highest among South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries. At present, the urban population of Lahore is more than 80  % and is at par with the urbanization level of the developed countries, that is, 80  % of the total population. Natural increase, rural to urban migration, and foreign and local investment in various sectors are the major impetus for growth of cities as well as urbanization in Lahore-Pakistan. With this pace of population rise, Lahore will be among the top 30 cities of the world in terms of urban proportion of population by 2025. Lahore ranked 56 th in the world in 1975 and 38 th in 2007 while it will be 24 th in 2025 (UN 2007). During the last few decades, rapid urbanization has played a pivotal role in socioeconomic prosperity of cities of the developing countries and therefore remained an <b>area</b> <b>of</b> <b>prime</b> <b>concern</b> among scientists, policy makers, and city managers (Zhang and Song 2003; Siciliano 2012). As urbanization is increasing all over the world, many cities experience high population growth rates, causing degradation to the local environment like noise and carbon pollution, soil erosion, and habitat and species loss (Zipperer et al. 1997; Vesely 2007; Young 2010). This rapid urbanization has caused a number of ecological and environmental problems and has also degraded the quality of environment of many cities of the world (Folke et al. 1997; Gregg et al. 2003; Alberti and Marzluff 2004; Kim and Baik 2005; Zhao et al. 2006; Matteucci and Morello 2009).|$|E

Kiribati is spread over 3 million square kilometres of the Central Pacific and conprises 33 inhabited atolls of the Gilbert, Phoenix and Line Groups. This report concentrates on south Tarawa atoll. " (Quoted from Introduction of Report.) Coastline {{movements are}} recognised as an important hazard on coral atolls by the Kiribati Government. Kiribati is spread over 3 million square kilometres of the Central Pacific and comprises 33 inhabited atolls of the Gilbert, Phoenix and Line Groups. This report concentrates on south Tarawa atoll (Fig. 1). The administrative and commercial centre of Kiribati is on south Tarawa atoll and located in Betio (port and government departments), Bairiki (seat of Government), Bikenibeu (main hospital/nurses training school, principal secondary school and sane government departments) and Bonriki (international airport). The coastline and beaches of south Tarawa atoll are being modified by erosion and accretion. Tarawa, in common with many other atolls has a long coastline per unit <b>area</b> <b>of</b> land and since land areas are in short supply, even small changes in the coastline may be of considerable significance. Population density (Table 1) is high in south Tarawa, especially on Betio (20 per acre); and with limited natural resources, not only the land but also the lagoon and adjacent ocean <b>areas</b> are <b>of</b> <b>prime</b> <b>concern</b> to the Gilbertese people.
