5|$|Right after Gaga {{performed}} in the Super Bowl LI halftime show, many media outlets pointed out similarities between {{the beginning of the}} show where she descended from the roof of NRG Stadium from <b>a</b> <b>harness</b> to a similar scene in this episode in which she descends from a helicopter on <b>a</b> <b>harness.</b>|$|E
5|$|Both the Bagabo and the B’laan {{refer to}} their agung {{ensemble}} as a tagunggo, {{a set of}} eight metal gongs suspended on <b>a</b> <b>harness,</b> which is played by two, three, or more people. Seven of the smaller-sized gongs produce a running melody with the eighth, largest gong playing syncopation with the other gongs to produce a particular rhythm. The Manabo also have an agung ensemble similar to the tagunggo, called a tagungguan.|$|E
5|$|In the past, the Kathiawari was {{considered}} a good cavalry mount. It was used by Maratha cavalry, and later – {{until the end of}} the First World War – by the Indian Army. In modern times it is used as a riding horse or as <b>a</b> <b>harness</b> horse. Some are used by Indian police forces, sometimes for tent-pegging, to which the Kathiawari is well suited. In 1995, annual breed shows were hosted by the breed association.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> {{full-body}} <b>harness</b> is {{the combination}} of <b>a</b> sit <b>harness</b> and <b>a</b> chest <b>harness</b> which are permanently or semi-permanently connected to each other. This kind of <b>harness</b> normally offers <b>a</b> wide range of attachment points. It is most commonly used in industrial/rescue situations, and also commonly used by small children instead of <b>a</b> sit <b>harness</b> which is easier to slip out of.|$|R
5|$|King was {{sponsored}} by the Daily Express and Sunday Express newspapers. One of the shortcomings of the boat was that it had neither guard rails or shrouds to hold on to. King solved this problem with a steel wire that stretched from bow to stern, to which he clipped <b>a</b> <b>harness.</b> His method was then copied by fellow racers Loïck Fougeron and Bernard Moitessier.|$|E
5|$|Communication {{between human}} and horse is {{paramount}} in any equestrian activity; to aid this process horses are usually ridden with a saddle {{on their backs}} to assist the rider with balance and positioning, and a bridle or related headgear to assist the rider in maintaining control. Sometimes horses are ridden without a saddle, and occasionally, horses are trained to perform without a bridle or other headgear. Many horses are also driven, which requires <b>a</b> <b>harness,</b> bridle, and some type of vehicle.|$|E
5|$|The craft was {{equipped}} with a life-support system consisting of an oxygen generator and devices to avoid oxygen poisoning and to absorb carbon dioxide. A fan, designed to activate whenever the cabin temperature exceeded , was added to keep the dog cool. Enough food (in a gelatinous form) was provided for a seven-day flight, and the dog was fitted with a bag to collect waste. <b>A</b> <b>harness</b> {{was designed to be}} fitted to the dog, and there were chains to restrict her movements to standing, sitting, or lying down; there was no room to turn around in the cabin. An electrocardiogram monitored heart rate and further instrumentation tracked respiration rate, maximum arterial pressure, and the dog's movements.|$|E

5|$|The film {{required}} {{large and}} ambitious sets to be constructed, from the Shaft of Hands to the rambling, distorted Goblin City where the film's climactic battle takes place. The Shaft of Hands sequence was filmed on a rig that was roughly forty feet high, and required {{nearly a hundred}} performers to operate the grey, scaly hands integral to the scene. Connelly was strapped into <b>a</b> <b>harness</b> when shooting the scene, and would spend time between takes suspended midway up the shaft.|$|E
5|$|They were hauled by two {{or three}} margoulins, men who walked on the towpaths pulling the barge with <b>a</b> <b>harness</b> over their shoulder. It took about 18 hours to pull a barge through the canal. A marinier stood {{on the front of}} the barge {{steering}} it with a wooden pole. Lock-keepers operated the locks and helped manoeuver the barges using a boat hook. Porters loaded and unloaded the barges. They were called crocheteurs after the iron hooks that they used to move bales of goods.|$|E
5|$|The Earps {{moved back}} to San Francisco in 1891 in part so Sadie could be closer to her {{half-sister}} Henrietta's family. Earp developed {{a reputation as a}} sportsman and a gambler. He held onto his San Diego properties, but when their value fell, he could not pay the taxes. He was forced to sell the lots. He continued to race horses, but by 1896, he could no longer afford to own them. He raced them on behalf of the owner of a horse stable in Santa Rosa that he managed for her. From 1891 to 1897, they lived in at least four different locations in the city: 145 Ellis St., 720 McAllister St., 514A Seventh Ave. and 1004 Golden Gate Ave. In Santa Rosa, Earp personally competed in and won <b>a</b> <b>harness</b> race.|$|E

Harnesses can be inserted into to their equipment as <b>an</b> assembly. Cable <b>harnesses</b> that are reused many times, like automobile wiring harnesses, are created with automated machinery.|$|R

5|$|The film's prologue {{shows the}} {{preparations}} {{for a hot}} air balloon ride. The balloon is tethered to the spire of a church next to a river, with a man named Yefim (Nikolay Glazkov) attempting to make the flight by use of <b>a</b> <b>harness</b> roped beneath the balloon. At the very moment of his attempt an ignorant mob arrive from the river and attempt to thwart the flight, putting a firebrand {{into the face of}} one of the men on the ground assisting Yefim. In spite of this the balloon is successfully released and Yefim is overwhelmed and delighted by the view from above and the sensation of flying, but he can not prevent a crash landing shortly after. He is the first of several creative characters, representing the daring escapist, whose hopes are easily crushed. After the crash, a horse is seen rolling on its back by a pond, a symbol of life–one of many horses in the movie.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenes in}} which Cole {{appeared}} on the ship were done by using <b>a</b> <b>harness</b> {{as if she was}} flying. Because the actress wore green dress and makeup, the normal greenscreen was replaced by bluescreens in the studio. Cole felt it was fun to fly on the harness, but found it painful after a few hours. Gillan was allowed to perform several of her own stunts in the episode. She was excited to learn that her character would fight pirates with swords, and was taught how to handle one with basic moves. Gillan was also allowed to swing across the ship. However, a stunt double was required to film the sequence where Amy is thrown across the deck by the Siren. The sickbay set was also built in a studio. Because the beds were attached to strings, they were prone to swaying. The cast members who were asked to lie on the beds were instructed to stay still and not breathe heavily to limit movement.|$|E
5|$|US 113 closely {{parallels}} the railroad west of Friendship to north of its right-in/right-out junction with MD 575 (Worcester Highway), an interchange only {{accessible to the}} northbound U.S. Highway. The route leaves the railroad track and meets MD90 (Ocean City Expressway) at a partial cloverleaf interchange; MD90 connects {{the northern part of}} Ocean City with US50 west of Berlin. US113 continues north to its interchange with the northern end of MD575 and MD589 (Racetrack Road), which leads to Ocean Pines and Ocean Downs, <b>a</b> <b>harness</b> racing track with a slot machine casino. The exit ramp from northbound US113 intersects MD575 a short distance south of its intersection with MD 589, and the southbound ramps connect with West Frontage Road (unsigned MD 575A), which serves St. Martin's Episcopal Church.|$|E

50|$|Five-point {{harnesses}} {{are typically}} found in child safety seats and in racing cars.

In NASCAR, the 6-point harness became popular after the death of Dale Earnhardt, who was wearing <b>a</b> five-point <b>harness</b> when he suffered his fatal crash; as it was first thought that his belt had broken, and broke his neck at impact, some teams ordered <b>a</b> six-point <b>harness</b> in response.|$|R
