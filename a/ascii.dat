5|$|ROT47 is a {{derivative}} of ROT13 which, {{in addition to}} scrambling the basic letters, also treats numbers and common symbols. Instead of using the sequence A–Z as the alphabet, ROT47 uses a larger set of characters from the common character encoding known as <b>ASCII.</b> Specifically, the 7-bit printable characters, excluding space, from decimal 33 '!' through 126 '~', 94 in total, taken {{in the order of}} the numerical values of their <b>ASCII</b> codes, are rotated by 47 positions, without special consideration of case. For example, the character A is mapped to p, while a is mapped to 2. The use of a larger alphabet produces a more thorough obfuscation than that of ROT13; for example, a telephone number such as +1-415-839-6885 is not obvious at first sight from the scrambled result Z`\c`d\gbh\eggd. On the other hand, because ROT47 introduces numbers and symbols into the mix without discrimination, it is more immediately obvious that the text has been enciphered.|$|E
5|$|Several {{systems have}} been {{developed}} that map the IPA symbols to <b>ASCII</b> characters. Notable systems include Kirshenbaum, ARPABET, SAMPA, and X-SAMPA. The usage of mapping systems in on-line text has to some extent been adopted in the context input methods, allowing convenient keying of IPA characters that would be otherwise unavailable on standard keyboard layouts.|$|E
5|$|Strings of data octets {{within a}} URI are {{represented}} as characters. Permitted characters within a URI are the <b>ASCII</b> characters for the lowercase and uppercase {{letters of the}} modern English alphabet, the Arabic numerals, hyphen, period, underscore, and tilde. Octets represented by any other character must be percent-encoded.|$|E

With a team of about 30 people, it was their first game to utilize a 3D {{graphics}} engine, although team veterans preferred to have used 2D graphics instead.

5|$|In {{order to}} prevent a second running of the program it corrupts itself when run. The program simply overwrites itself with a 6000 byte long DNA-like code at a certain position.

5|$|Sega {{was able}} to outsell Nintendo four Christmas seasons in a row due to the Genesis' head start, a lower price point, and a larger library of games when {{compared}} to the Super Nintendo at its release. Sega had ten games for every game on SNES, and while the SNES had an exclusive version of Final Fight, one of Sega's internal development teams created Streets of Rage, which had bigger levels, tougher enemies, and a well-regarded soundtrack. <b>ASCII</b> Entertainment reported in the spring of 1993 that Genesis had 250 titles versus 75 for Super Nintendo, but limited shelf space meant that stores typically offered 100 Genesis and 50 Super Nintendo titles.

By his own admission, A/B Extreme was too {{difficult}} for readers to understand, so for his next work, {{he set out to}} write something easier to grasp. As such, the initial premise of Shakugan no Shana was to write a boy meets girl story in a school setting, though initially love was not one of the themes included. He was given the freedom to write as he pleased based on this premise after showing it to his editor.|$|E
