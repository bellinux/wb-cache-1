5|$|Shortly {{after hearing}} the verdict Matsui confided to his prison chaplain, Shinsho Hanayama, his {{feelings}} about the atrocities in Nanking and the rebuke he delivered to his subordinates on February 7, 1938. He blamed the atrocities on the alleged moral decline of the Japanese Army since the Russo-Japanese War, and said,The Nanking Incident was a terrible disgrace... Immediately after the memorial services, I assembled the higher officers and wept tears of anger before them, as Commander-in-Chief... I told them that after all our efforts to enhance the Imperial prestige, everything had been lost in one moment through the brutalities of the soldiers. <b>And</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> imagine it, even after that, these officers laughed at me... I am really, therefore, quite happy that I, at least, should have ended this way, {{in the sense that}} it may serve to urge self-reflection on many more members of the military of that time.On the night of December 22, 1948, Matsui met fellow condemned inmates Hideki Tojo, Akira Mutō, and Kenji Doihara at the prison chapel. As the oldest member of the group, Matsui was asked to lead them in shouting three cheers of banzai to the Emperor. Then he led the group up to the gallows where they were all hanged simultaneously shortly after midnight on the morning of December 23, 1948.|$|E

2500|$|... "John Wayne" [...] is {{composed}} {{in the key}} of B minor with a tempo of 92 beats per minute. Gaga's vocals span the nodes of A4 to D6 and it follows a basic sequence of B5–A5–E–B5–A5 as its chord progression. It is a pop rock song, which contains influences of other genres including country, disco, funk, and house. According to Mikael Wood from the Los Angeles Times, classifying the genre of the song is difficult, as it combines [...] "tinny Euro-house synths, slowed-down funk drums and a boot-scooting bass line straight out of Nashville." [...] The track has [...] "tongue-in-cheek" [...] lyrics, referencing cowboy in the opening verse: [...] "I just love a cowboy, I know it's bad, but I'm, like, can I just hang {{off the back of}} your horse <b>and</b> <b>can</b> <b>you</b> go a little faster?" ...|$|E
