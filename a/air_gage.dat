40|$|Overcoat {{protection}} {{schemes for}} thin film devices have typically focused on inhibiting {{the growth of}} native oxides formed on the sensor surface, rather than on improving the passivating nature of these native oxides. Here, thin sputtered Cr overcoats and heat treatments in varying oxygen partial pressures enhanced the passivating nature of native Cr 203 films formed on PdCr thin film strain gages. Results of strain tests using sensors protected using this approach are presented and the implications are discussed. PdCr gages with sputtered Cr overcoats withstood 12, 000 dynamic strain cycles of 1100 micro-epsilon during 100 hours of testing at a temperature of 1000 C in <b>air.</b> <b>Gage</b> factors of 1. 3 with drift rates as low as 0. 1 Omega/hr were achieved for devices having a nominal resistance of approximately 100 Omega's. TCR's ranging from + 550 ppm/C to + 798 ppm/C were realized depending on the overcoat and thermal history. Possible mechanisms for an anomaly in the electrical characteristics of these films at 800 C and improvements in stability due {{to the use of}} overcoats are presented...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of investigations on the <b>air</b> <b>gages</b> dynamic characteristics in the measurement of the round profiles of motor cylinders. The principle of the measuring device is explained, and the analysis of the <b>air</b> <b>gages</b> dynamics is described. The results of dynamic calibration enabled to eliminate those configurations of <b>air</b> <b>gages</b> that may not meet the requirements of the measurement they were designed for. After the proper <b>air</b> <b>gages</b> were chosen, the entire system underwent the accuracy test and passed it successfully revealing the method accuracy better than 10 % compared to the reference measurement...|$|R
5000|$|The {{album was}} {{produced}} by Andy Cresswell-Davis (known simply as Andy Davis on this recording) and engineered by Denny Bridges. It was recorded at Ramport Studios in South London and mixed at <b>AIR</b> Studios. Pete <b>Gage</b> produced the basic track on [...] "The Dump" [...] and [...] "Steam Radio Song". Some of the keyboards for the album were played by Dave Lawson of the band Greenslade.|$|R
