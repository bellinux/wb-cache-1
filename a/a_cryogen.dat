50|$|Continuous-flow cryostats {{are cooled}} by liquid cryogens (typically liquid helium or nitrogen) from a storage dewar. <b>As</b> the <b>cryogen</b> boils within the cryostat, it is {{continuously}} replenished by {{a steady flow}} from the storage dewar. Temperature control of the sample within the cryostat is typically performed by controlling the flow rate of cryogen into the cryostat together with a heating wire attached to a PID temperature control loop. The length of time over which cooling may be maintained is dictated by the volume of cryogens available.|$|R
50|$|Cryomilling is a {{variation}} of mechanical milling, in which metallic powders or other samples (e.g. temperature sensitive samples and samples with volatile components) are milled in <b>a</b> <b>cryogen</b> (usually liquid nitrogen or liquid argon) slurry or at a cryogenics temperature under processing parameters, so a nanostructured microstructure is attained. Cryomilling takes advantage of both the cryogenic temperatures and conventional mechanical milling. The extremely low milling temperature suppresses recovery and recrystallization and leads to finer grain structures and more rapid grain refinement. The embrittlement of the sample makes even elastic and soft samples grindable. Tolerances less than 5 µm can be achieved. The ground material can be analyzed by a laboratory analyzer.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} ballistic missiles, {{such as the}} Soviet R-7 {{that launched}} Sputnik 1 and the U.S. Atlas and Titan-1, used kerosene and liquid oxygen. Although they are preferred in space launchers, the difficulties of storing <b>a</b> <b>cryogen</b> like liquid oxygen in a missile {{that had to be}} kept launch ready for months or years at a time led to a switch to hypergolic propellants in the U.S. Titan II and in most Soviet ICBMs such as the R-36. But the difficulties of such corrosive and toxic materials, including leaks and explosions in Titan-II silos, led to their near universal replacement with solid-fuel boosters, first in Western submarine-launched ballistic missiles and then in land-based U.S. and Soviet ICBMs.|$|E
50|$|The {{sorption}} pump is a vacuum pump {{that creates a}} vacuum by adsorbing molecules on a very porous material like molecular sieve which is cooled by <b>a</b> <b>cryogen,</b> typically liquid nitrogen. The ultimate pressure is about 10−2 mbar. With special techniques this can be lowered till 10−7 mbar. The main advantages are the absence of oil or other contaminants, low cost and vibration free operation {{because there are no}} moving parts. The main disadvantages are that it cannot operate continuously and cannot effectively pump hydrogen, helium and neon, all gases with lower condensation temperature than liquid nitrogen. The main application is as a roughing pump for a sputter-ion pump in ultra-high vacuum experiments, for example in surface physics.|$|E

50|$|The insulation, as {{efficient}} as it is, will not keep LNG cold enough by itself. Inevitably, heat leakage will warm and vapourise the LNG. Industry practice is to store LNG as <b>a</b> boiling <b>cryogen.</b> That is, the liquid is stored at its boiling point for the pressure at which it is stored (atmospheric pressure). As the vapour boils off, heat for the phase change cools the remaining liquid. Because the insulation is very efficient, only a relatively small amount of boil off is necessary to maintain temperature. This phenomenon is also called auto-refrigeration.|$|R
50|$|Other {{examples}} are the fitting of a wrought iron tyre {{around the rim}} of a wooden cart wheel by a wheelwright, or of a steel tyre to {{the wheel of a}} railway engine or rolling stock. In both cases the tyre will be heated and expands to slightly greater than the wheel's diameter, and is fitted around it. After cooling, the tyre contracts, binding tightly in place. A common method used in industry is the use of induction shrink fitting which refers to the use of induction heating technology to pre-heat metal components between 150˚C and 300˚C thereby causing them to expand and allow for the insertion or removal of another component. Other methods of shrink-fitting include compression shrink fitting, which uses <b>a</b> <b>cryogen</b> such as liquid nitrogen to cool the insert, and shape memory coupling, which is achieved by means of a phase transition.|$|E
50|$|In {{electron}} microscopy (EM), samples are imaged in an ultra-high vacuum. Such a vacuum {{is incompatible with}} biological samples such as cells; the water would boil off, and the difference in pressure would explode the cell. In room-temperature EM techniques, samples are therefore prepared by fixation and dehydration. Another approach to stabilize biological samples, however, is to freeze them (cryo-{{electron microscopy}}). As in other cryo-electron microscopy techniques, samples for ECT (typically small cells (e.g. Bacteria or Archaea) or viruses) are prepared in standard aqueous media and applied to an EM grid. The grid is then plunged into <b>a</b> <b>cryogen</b> (typically ethane) so efficient that water molecules do {{not have time to}} rearrange into a crystalline lattice. The resulting water state is called “vitreous ice” and preserves native cellular structures, such as lipid membranes, that would normally be destroyed by freezing. Plunge-frozen samples are subsequently stored and imaged at liquid-nitrogen temperatures so that the water never warms enough to crystallize.|$|E
5000|$|Cryostats used in MRI {{machines}} {{are designed to}} hold <b>a</b> <b>cryogen,</b> typically helium, in a liquid state with minimal evaporation (boil-off). The liquid helium bath is designed to keep the superconducting magnet's bobbin of superconductive wire in its superconductive state. In this state the wire has no electrical resistance and very large currents are maintained with a low power input. To maintain superconductivity, the bobbin must be kept below its transition temperature by being immersed in the liquid helium. If, for any reason, the wire becomes resistive, i.e. loses superconductivity, a condition known as a [...] "quench", the liquid helium evaporates, instantly raising pressure within the vessel. A burst disk, usually made of carbon, is placed within the chimney or vent pipe so that during a pressure excursion, the gaseous helium can be safely vented out of the MRI suite. Modern MRI cryostats use a mechanical refrigerator (cryocooler) to re-condense the helium gas {{and return it to}} the bath, to maintain cryogenic conditions and to conserve helium.|$|E

40|$|Cryosurgery is an {{increasingly}} popular {{way to treat}} prostate cancer. This process includes inserting one or more probes directly into the prostate to freeze the whole tissue and kill the cancer cells. The number of probes is a determining factor for {{the effectiveness of the}} procedure. In our project, we varied the number of probes to see how much of the prostate is frozen in twenty minutes. We used <b>an</b> argon <b>cryogen</b> system with probe temperature of - 150 oC. Using FIDAP to model the freezing of the prostate, we looked at the temperature data of nodes 2 cm away {{from the center of the}} prostate after 20 minutes. For the 1 probe model, the average temperature of the tissue was 25. 76 deg C, for the 3 probe the average was 1. 05 deg C and for the 5 probe, - 16. 97 deg C. From these results, it is evident that 1 probe is insufficient for prostate freezing since the temperature only went from 35 oC to 25 oC in twenty minutes, a mere 10 degree change. Even three probes will be inefficient for prostate freezing since it was twenty degrees away from reaching the optimal temperature of - 20 oC. We recommend using 5 probes for prostate freezing and looking into using even more probes for more time-efficient freezing. <b>A</b> colder <b>cryogen</b> would also lead to faster cooling.

40|$|Abstract—Cryogen {{spray cooling}} �CSC � is an {{effective}} technique to protect the epidermis during cutaneous laser therapies. Spraying <b>a</b> <b>cryogen</b> onto the skin surface creates a time-varying heat flux, effectively cooling the skin during and following the cryogen spurt. In previous studies mathematical models were developed to predict the human skin temperature profiles during the cryogen spraying time. However, no studies have accounted for the additional cooling due to residual cryogen left on the skin surface following the spurt termination. We formulate and solve an inverse heat conduction �IHC � problem to predict the time-varying surface heat flux both during and following <b>a</b> <b>cryogen</b> spurt. The IHC formulation uses measured temperature profiles from within a medium to estimate the surface heat flux. We implement a one-dimensional sequential function specification method �SFSM � to estimate the surface heat flux from internal temperatures measured within an in vitro model in response to <b>a</b> <b>cryogen</b> spurt. Solution accuracy and experimental errors are examined using simulated temperature data. Heat flux following spurt termination appears substantial; however, it is less than that during the spraying time. The estimated time-varying heat flux can subsequently be used in forward heat conduction models to estimate temperature profiles in skin during and following <b>a</b> <b>cryogen</b> spurt and predict appropriate timing for onset of the laser pulse. © 200...|$|E
