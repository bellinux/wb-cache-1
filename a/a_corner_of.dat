5|$|In Lower Swatara Township {{the turnpike}} reaches an {{interchange}} with {{the southern end}} of I-283, serving Harrisburg and its eastern suburbs. Here, the road narrows back to four lanes through suburban development near Middletown before continuing into rural areas. The turnpike crosses <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> Lebanon County before entering Lancaster County.|$|E
5|$|In Ukraine, a {{memorial}} complex was erected {{to honor the}} over 4300 officer victims of the Katyń massacre murdered in Pyatykhatky, 14kilometres/8.7miles north of Kharkiv in Ukraine; the complex lies in <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> a former resort home for NKVD officers. Children had discovered hundreds of Polish officer buttons whilst playing on the site.|$|E

5|$|The SS {{transfer}} the Jews {{to one of}} two ghettos, each with its own council or Judenrat. Eliezer's house on <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> Serpent Street was in the larger ghetto in the town centre, so his family was able to stay at home, though the windows on the non-ghetto side had to be boarded up.|$|E
5|$|For {{greatest}} {{efficiency and}} best coupling to the room's air volume, subwoofers {{can be placed}} in <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the room, far from large room openings, {{and closer to the}} listener. This is possible since low bass frequencies have a long wavelength; hence there is little difference between the information reaching a listener's left and right ears, and so they cannot be readily localized. All low frequency information is sent to the subwoofer. However, unless the sound tracks have been carefully mixed for a single subwoofer channel, it's possible to have some cancellation of low frequencies if bass information in one channel is out of phase with another.|$|E
5|$|In <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> our 60m3 room {{farthest}} {{away from}} the apparatus, we exploded 3mg. of sodium chlorate with milk sugar while observing the nonluminous flame before the slit. After a while, it glowed a bright yellow and showed a strong sodium line that disappeared only after 10 minutes. From {{the weight of the}} sodium salt and the volume of air in the room, we easily calculate that one part by weight of air could not contain more than 1/20 millionth weight of sodium.|$|E

5|$|Lydford Castle is {{a medieval}} castle {{in the town}} of Lydford, Devon, England. The first castle in Lydford, {{sometimes}} termed the Norman fort, was a small ringwork built in <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the Anglo-Saxon fortified burh in the years after the Norman conquest of England. It was intended to help control Devon following the widespread revolt against Norman rule in 1068. The Norman fort had been abandoned {{by the middle of the}} 12th century.|$|E
5|$|Of special note is that Robotron had a {{major defect}} where the game would reset (Carpet pattern reset/watchdog reset) if a {{specific}} scenario was experienced while shooting an Enforcer in <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the screen. In 1987, Christian Gingras evaluated the code to find the problem. A visit to Williams headquarters to consult with the VidKidz resulted in code fixes that eventually made it into all later ports of the game, starting with the Digital Eclipse emulator in which the signature string 'CHG_G:87' is clearly visible.|$|E

5|$|Planché's {{personal}} life inspired two works. In 1864 he published <b>A</b> <b>Corner</b> <b>of</b> Kent, or some {{account of the}} parish of Ash-next-Sandwich, the result of three years' work on what was originally intended as a short guidebook to antiquities within the parish of his son-in-law, the Rev. Henry Mackarness. In 1872 he published his autobiography, a two-volume work entitled The Recollections and Reflections of J.R. Planché (Somerset herald): a professional biography, containing many anecdotes {{of his life in}} the theatre.|$|E
5|$|The Robillon wing {{contains}} an {{entrance to the}} palace reached by flights of ingeniously designed graduated steps. Their design creates an illusion of a longer and higher perspective, centred on <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> a terrace because of exigencies of the site, and divided mid-flight {{so as not to}} lead the eye and footstep towards an angle of the colonnade beyond. The steps are adorned with elaborate statuary (see key 11). The bays of the façade are stuccoed rose-pink, contrasting with the motifs and pilasters in natural stone (see illustration).|$|E
5|$|The Tower House is on <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> Melbury Road, {{just north}} of Kensington High Street, in the {{district}} of Holland Park. It stands opposite Stavordvale Lodge and next to Woodland House, built for the artist Luke Fildes. The development of Melbury Road in the grounds of Little Holland House created an art colony in Holland Park, the Holland Park Circle. Its most prominent member, Frederic, Lord Leighton, lived at Leighton House, 12 Holland Park Road, and at the time of Leighton's death in 1896 six Royal Academicians, as well as one associate member, were living in Holland Park Road and Melbury Road.|$|E

5|$|The town of Herne Bay {{took its}} name from the {{neighbouring}} village of Herne, two kilometres inland from the bay. The word herne, meaning a place on <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> land, evolved from the Old English hyrne, meaning corner. The village was first recorded in around 1100 as Hyrnan. The corner may relate to the sharp turn in the minor Roman road between Canterbury and Reculver at Herne.|$|E
5|$|US-64/ US-412 {{continue}} {{east from}} the eastern terminus of the Cimarron Turnpike in southeastern Pawnee as a freeway known as the Keystone Expressway. This highway continues eastward along a peninsula into Lake Keystone. Here, the highway serves as the southern limit of Westport and Mule Barn, which remains an incorporated town despite having a population of zero. The freeway turns southeast, briefly entering Westport before crossing Lake Keystone into Osage County. US-64 and US-412 run through Osage County for just under , cutting across <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the county before entering Tulsa County.|$|E
5|$|A short {{distance}} later, the two routes enter Manchester Township in Ocean County and continue east through a tract of the Brendan T. Byrne State Forest within the Pine Barrens {{as well as}} <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the Fort Dix Military Reservation. The road eventually reaches the community of Whiting, where it passes commercial development at the intersection with CR 539. Here, CR 530 turns south to follow CR 539 and Route 70 continues northeast back into the Pine Barrens. The road turns more to the north-northeast before heading east into Lakehurst {{to the south of}} the Lakehurst Naval Air Station. In Lakehurst, Route 70 comes to a traffic circle with CR 4 and CR 12 before running through residential and commercial areas of the town. It intersects with the southern terminus of CR 547, where it widens into a four-lane divided highway. From here, the route crosses over Conrail Shared Assets Operations' Southern Secondary railroad line before coming to the Lakehurst Circle, where it intersects the western terminus of Route 37.|$|E

5|$|An {{emergency}} subscription {{fund was}} established {{by some of the}} city's wealthiest citizens. Betances and Basora had the city's unsanitary slave barracks torched and a temporary camp set up for its dwellers. A large field at <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the city was set aside for a supplementary cemetery, and Betances set and managed a temporary hospital next to it (which was later housed in a permanent structure and became the Hospital San Antonio, the Mayagüez municipal hospital, which still serves the city). However, the epidemic struck the city soon after; Betances' stepmother and one of his brothers-in-law would die from it. By October 1856 Betances would {{have to take care of}} the entire operation on his own temporarily.|$|E
5|$|In 1731, the {{government}} purchased houses {{at the site}} of the present building and construction of a new building started the next year. The Sabor first met in the new building on 6 May 1737. The building was originally designed to accommodate archives, the court and the office of the ban; however, {{the government}} of Zagreb County moved in as well in 1765. The ban's office, the court and the archives moved out of the building in 1807, when a building across St. Mark's Square was bought to accommodate them. Subsequently, the newly purchased building was named Banski dvori after its new primary purpose of housing the ban and his office. The Zagreb County government purchased buildings adjacent to the parliament in 1839 and commissioned a new building at the site. It was completed in 1849; in the meantime, the Sabor had to convene elsewhere; it met in a theatre building located on <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the square. The theatre building later became the Zagreb City Hall.|$|E
5|$|Only <b>a</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the Jydegaard Formation {{is exposed}} today; the {{remainder}} is overgrown. Jydegaard {{is part of}} the Nyker Group, which includes three formations (Rabekke, Robbedale and Jydegaard) ranging from the Berriasian to the Valanginian ages of the Early Cretaceous. Jydegaard consists of sediments deposited in a fresh-to-brackish lagoon facing a coastal strip. In addition to Dromaeosauroides and a possible titanosaur, remains of hybodont sharks, fish such as Lepidotes and Pleuropholis, turtles, lizards, the crocodile Pholidosaurus and thin bone fragments from birds or pterosaurs have been found in the deposit. The bivalve Neomiodon is found in abundance in the sediments below (the Neomiodon Bed), indicating mass mortality, perhaps due to dinoflagellate toxins.|$|E
