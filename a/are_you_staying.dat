500|$|A {{recurring}} {{source of}} lyrical subject matter in Let the Blind Lead is Cox's best friend, Deerhunter guitarist Lockett Pundt, whom {{the album is}} dedicated to. [...] "Winter Vacation" [...] concerns {{the first time the}} two met. Seeing him at a bus stop while vacationing in Savannah, Georgia, Cox was [...] "attracted to him, but not in some kind of like, just physical way." [...] Seeing [...] "his melancholy, his sitting alone, staring at the ground", he [...] "fell in love" [...] with him. Cox and his family later drove to a beach; [...] "Winter Vacation" [...] relates to Cox’s memory of the beach, being [...] "infected with that new love" [...] found after meeting Pundt. The words of [...] "Scraping Past" [...] are about [...] "moving on…And wondering if somebody is going to come with you or…stay behind." [...] This uncertainty is characterized by several lines Cox considers [...] "pop song clichés", referencing [...] "rain that comes and goes." [...] In the song, Cox asks Pundt, [...] "Are you going to come with me, or <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>staying</b> here?" [...] In [...] "Ativan" [...] Cox examines his addiction to the drug of the same name, as well as his relationship with Pundt. [...] "It talks a lot about how things have changed between me and Lockett's relationship and how he's met a girl and…our friendship is never gonna change, but it's difficult sometimes." [...] Cox asserts that he would [...] "rather just take whatever drugs it takes to go to sleep and sleep through it…I'm not prepared to face it yet." ...|$|E
