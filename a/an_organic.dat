5|$|A vitamin is <b>an</b> <b>organic</b> {{compound}} and an essential nutrient that an organism requires in limited amounts. <b>An</b> <b>organic</b> chemical compound (or related set of compounds) {{is called a}} vitamin when the organism cannot synthesize the compound in sufficient quantities, {{and it must be}} obtained through the diet; thus, the term vitamin is conditional upon the circumstances and the particular organism. For example, ascorbic acid (one form of vitamin C) is a vitamin for humans, but not for most other animals. Vitamin D is essential only for people who do not have adequate skin exposure to sunlight, as ultraviolet light promotes synthesis in skin cells. Supplementation is important for the treatment of certain health problems, but there is little evidence of nutritional benefit when used by otherwise healthy people.|$|E

5|$|After the Second World War, Moore's bronzes took {{on their}} larger scale, which was {{particularly}} suited for public art commissions. As {{a matter of}} practicality, he largely abandoned direct carving, and took on several assistants to help produce the larger forms based on maquettes. By {{the end of the}} 1940s, he produced sculptures increasingly by modelling, working out the shape in clay or plaster before casting the final work in bronze using the lost wax technique. These maquettes often began as small forms shaped by Moore's hands—a process which gives his work <b>an</b> <b>organic</b> feeling. They are from the body.|$|E

5|$|Animals {{and plants}} {{have evolved to}} {{synthesise}} {{a vast array of}} poisonous products including secondary metabolites, peptides and proteins that can act as inhibitors. Natural toxins are usually small organic molecules and are so diverse that there are probably natural inhibitors for most metabolic processes. The metabolic processes targeted by natural poisons encompass more than enzymes in metabolic pathways and can also include the inhibition of receptor, channel and structural protein functions in a cell. For example, paclitaxel (taxol), <b>an</b> <b>organic</b> molecule found in the Pacific yew tree, binds tightly to tubulin dimers and inhibits their assembly into microtubules in the cytoskeleton.|$|E
5|$|Dentin is a mineralized {{connective}} tissue with <b>an</b> <b>organic</b> matrix of collagenous proteins. Dentin has microscopic channels, called dentinal tubules, which radiate outward through the dentin from the pulp cavity to the exterior cementum or enamel border. The diameter of these tubules range from 2.5 μm near the pulp, to 1.2 μm in the midportion, and 900nm near the dentino-enamel junction. Although {{they may have}} tiny side-branches, the tubules do not intersect with each other. Their length is dictated by the radius of the tooth. The three dimensional configuration of the dentinal tubules is genetically determined.|$|E
5|$|Direct {{precipitation}} {{of sodium}} salts from aqueous solutions is rare because sodium salts typically {{have a high}} affinity for water; an exception is sodium bismuthate (NaBiO3). Because of this, sodium salts are usually isolated as solids by evaporation or by precipitation with <b>an</b> <b>organic</b> solvent, such as ethanol; for example, only 0.35g/L of sodium chloride will dissolve in ethanol. Crown ethers, like 15-crown-5, {{may be used as}} a phase-transfer catalyst.|$|E

5|$|In 2000 Lee {{released}} the 22-minute short Subrosa, following a woman's {{search for her}} mother in Seoul. Intended as a prequel for an undeveloped film entitled Priceless, the film was shot in several formats with a fifteen-person crew, hurriedly recording scenes in public locations. It extensively used character-centred shots, leading to what Lee described as <b>an</b> <b>organic</b> understanding of the character. It also featured on-screen sexual intercourse, framed in a medium shot, which Lee intended as a sign and not simply a sex scene. Although Priceless, meant as a sequel to Subrosa, went through more than thirty drafts, it was ultimately cancelled despite interest from Alliance Atlantis and Citytv.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the 50 states and federal district, the United States has sovereignty over 14 territories.

With the exception of Navassa Island, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which {{are located in the}} Caribbean, all territories are located in the Pacific Ocean. One territory, Palmyra Atoll, is considered to be incorporated, meaning the full body of the Constitution has been applied to it; the other territories are unincorporated, meaning the Constitution does not fully apply to them. Ten territories (the Minor Outlying Islands and American Samoa) are considered to be unorganized, meaning they have not had <b>an</b> <b>Organic</b> Act enacted by Congress; the four other territories are organized, meaning they have had <b>an</b> <b>Organic</b> Act that has been enacted by Congress.
