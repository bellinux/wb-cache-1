5|$|Norton AntiSpam now scans e-mails for spoofed URLs {{and deals}} with any {{offending}} e-mail as spam. E-mails {{can also be}} blocked based on language, however by default the filter allows all languages. AntiSpam can sync its own list of allowed senders with POP3 <b>address</b> <b>books.</b> Users can train the spam filter by pointing out valid e-mail marked as spam and vice versa. Support for Yahoo! Mail and Hotmail was added in this release.|$|E
5|$|Spam {{filtering}} imports users' <b>address</b> <b>books</b> {{to compile}} a whitelist of allowed senders. Addresses to which users send mail and e-mail tagged as valid mail can be automatically added to the whitelist. Using several thousand messages, PC Magazine found that Norton marked over 40 percent of valid e-mail as spam. Over 80 percent of valid newsletters were marked as spam. Norton did correctly identify 90 percent of spam e-mail.|$|E

25|$|June 25, 2007 - Google added {{a number}} of {{features}} to Google Apps, including mail migration from external IMAP servers, shared <b>address</b> <b>books,</b> a visual overhaul of Google Docs and Google Sheets, and increased Gmail attachment size. A ZDNet article noted that Google Apps now offered a tool for switching from the popular Exchange Server and Lotus Notes, positioning Google {{as an alternative to}} Microsoft and IBM.|$|E
25|$|Most Japanese {{people and}} {{agencies}} have adopted customs {{to deal with}} these issues. <b>Address</b> <b>books,</b> for instance, often contain furigana or ruby characters to clarify the pronunciation of the name. Japanese nationals are also required to give a romanized name for their passport. The recent use of katakana in Japanese media when referring to Japanese celebrities who have gained international fame has started a fad among young socialites who attempt to invoke a cosmopolitan flair using katakana names as a badge of honor. All of these complications are also found in Japanese place names.|$|E

25|$|If {{passwords}} {{are written}} down, they {{should never be}} kept in obvious places such as <b>address</b> <b>books,</b> Rolodex files, under drawers or keyboards, or behind pictures. Perhaps the worst, but all too common, location is a Post-It note on the computer monitor. Better locations are a safe deposit box or a locked file approved for information of sensitivity comparable to that protected by the password. Most locks on office file cabinets are far from adequate. Software is available for popular hand-held computers that can store passwords for numerous accounts in encrypted form. Another approach is to encrypt by hand on paper and remember the encryption method and key. And another approach {{is to use a}} single password or slightly varying passwords for low-security accounts and select distinctly separate strong passwords for a smaller number of high-value applications such as for online banking.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, Kheradpir formed small {{teams that}} were each {{responsible}} for {{coming up with}} and developing new products. Kheradpir implemented a 30-day prototype cycle to rapidly test and modify new technologies in development. His team of approximately 10,000 staff often worked late hours, but positions at Verizon were in high demand, because of the department's rapid pace. According to InfoWorld, he led technology development for strategic initiatives such as FiOS(fiber to the home), process and systems transformation, and many new customer-facing products." [...] In 2003 his team created iobi, which manages <b>address</b> <b>books,</b> caller ID and other features across devices over the internet. The Verizon One, a combination phone, router, modem and smart portable device, was developed from his department the following year. His division also reengineered many of Verizon's core network systems, including call center, website, automated customer service systems, and integrated formerly separate systems from predecessor companies GTE, Bell Atlantic and NYNEX.|$|E

5000|$|Windows <b>Address</b> <b>Book</b> was a {{component}} of Microsoft Windows that lets users keep a single list of contacts that can be shared by multiple programs. It is most commonly used by Outlook Express. It was introduced with Internet Explorer 3 in 1996 and improved in subsequent versions. The Windows <b>Address</b> <b>Book</b> API can query LDAP servers or read/write data to a local [...]wab file. In Windows Vista, Windows <b>Address</b> <b>Book</b> was replaced with Windows Contacts.|$|R
5000|$|The Skype client for Mac {{has been}} {{observed}} accessing protected information in the system <b>Address</b> <b>Book</b> even when integration with the <b>Address</b> <b>Book</b> (on by default) is disabled in the Skype preferences. Users may see a warning about Skype.app attempting to access protected information in <b>address</b> <b>book</b> under certain conditions, e.g. launching Skype while syncing with a mobile device. Skype has no legitimate reason to access the <b>Address</b> <b>Book</b> if the integration is not enabled. Further, {{the extent of the}} integration is to add all cards from the <b>Address</b> <b>Book</b> to the list of Skype contacts along with their phone numbers, which can be accomplished without accessing any protected information (neither the name nor numbers on cards are protected) and thus the attempt to access information beyond the scope of the integration, {{regardless of whether or not}} that integration is enabled, raises deeper questions as to possible spying on users.|$|R

2500|$|In 1936, Himmler {{created the}} Reich Central Office for the Combating of Homosexuality and Abortion. The Gestapo raided gay bars, tracked {{individuals}} using the <b>address</b> <b>books</b> of those they arrested, used the subscription lists of gay magazines to find others, and encouraged people to report suspected homosexual behavior and to scrutinize {{the behavior of}} their neighbors. Lesbians were left relatively unaffected; the Nazis saw them as [...] "asocials", rather than sexual deviants.|$|E
2500|$|Over time, {{database}} vendors {{took over}} the driver interfaces and provided direct links to their products. Skipping the intermediate conversions to and from Jet or similar wrappers often resulted in higher performance. However, by then Microsoft had changed focus to their OLE DB concept (recently reinstated [...] ), which provided direct access to {{a wider variety of}} data sources from <b>address</b> <b>books</b> to text files. Several new systems followed which further turned their attention from ODBC, including ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) and ADO.net, which interacted more or less with ODBC over their lifetimes.|$|E
2500|$|Within {{hours of}} the burglars' arrest, the FBI {{discovered}} the name of E. Howard Hunt in the <b>address</b> <b>books</b> of Barker and Martínez. Nixon administration officials were concerned because Hunt and Liddy were also involved in a separate secret activity known as the White House Plumbers, which {{was set up to}} stop security [...] "leaks" [...] and to investigate other sensitive security matters. Dean would later testify he was ordered by top Nixon aide John Ehrlichman to [...] "deep six" [...] the contents of Howard Hunt's White House safe. Ehrlichman subsequently denied that. In the end, the evidence from Hunt's safe was destroyed (in separate operations) by Dean and the FBI's Acting Director, L. Patrick Gray.|$|E

2500|$|In June 2009, Time {{magazine}} columnist Sean Gregory called Tagged [...] "The world's most annoying website". Tagged asked users {{for their}} email username and password, retrieved email addresses from their <b>address</b> <b>books,</b> and repeatedly sent email invitations {{to people who}} were not registered on Tagged, falsely stating that they have been [...] "added as a friend" [...] or that the inviter had sent them photos on Tagged. This process has been labelled an [...] "e-mail scam" [...] by consumer anti-fraud advocates and drawn criticism in the technology press and from users. The emails were discussed as possible spam by Black Web 2.0 and the resemblance to a virus was noted by urban legend site Snopes.com. The New York Times referred to the practice as [...] "contact scraping".|$|E
