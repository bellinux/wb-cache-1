40|$|In {{a binary}} choice voting scenario, voters may have fuzzy {{preferences}} but {{are required to}} make crisp choices. In order to compare a crisp voting procedure with more general mechanisms of fuzzy preference aggregation, we first focus on the latter. We present a formulation of strategy-proofness in this setting and study its consequences. On one hand, we achieve an axiomatic recommendation of the median as the <b>aggregation</b> <b>rule</b> for fuzzy preferences. On the other hand, we present conditions under which strategic concerns imply the optimality of a crisp voting procedure and {{argue that there is}} a potential gain in the integration of the preference and choice aggregation programs — namely that an underlying fuzzy preference structure may also help inform the selection of a choice <b>aggregation</b> <b>rule.</b> Fuzzy preferences, strategy-proofness, <b>aggregation</b> <b>rule,</b> social choice, JEL Classification: D 71...|$|R

40|$|A new <b>aggregation</b> <b>rule</b> {{in social}} choice voting with {{linguistic}} intensities of preferences between pairs of alternatives is introduced.

This new rule extends existing rules from the context of crisp and reciprocal [0, 1]-valued preferences to the framework of linguistic preferences. Both possible representation formats of linguistic information are addressed: fuzzy sets and 2 -tuples. The linguistic majorities constitute a class of majority rules because they generalize all the possible majority rules by adjusting the required threshold of support...|$|R

40|$|Two strict {{preference}} aggregation {{mechanisms are}} suggested. One determines the collective preference {{from the most}} preferred to the least preferred alternative using as inputs the individuals' most preferred alternatives once the alternatives already assigned {{a position in the}} collective preference have been removed. The other mechanism does the same the other way around, constructing the preference starting from the least preferred alternative and using the least preferred remaining alternatives as inputs. It is shown that if both procedures are assumed to generate the same collective preference then the resulting <b>aggregation</b> <b>rule</b> must be dictatorial or constant. Weaker versions of these procedures also yield a dictatorial <b>aggregation</b> <b>rule</b> when combined with mild versions of unanimity or surjectivity.

5000|$|Duncan Black {{has shown}} {{that if there is}} only one {{dimension}} on which every individual has a [...] "single-peaked" [...] preference, then all of Arrow's conditions are met by majority rule. Suppose that there is some predetermined linear ordering of the alternative set. An individual's preference is single-peaked with respect to this ordering if he has some special place that he likes best along that line, and his dislike for an alternative grows larger as the alternative goes further away from that spot (i.e., the graph of his utility function has a single peak if alternatives are placed according to the linear ordering on the horizontal axis). For example, if voters were voting on where to set the volume for music, it would be reasonable to assume that each voter had their own ideal volume preference and that as the volume got progressively too loud or too quiet they would be increasingly dissatisfied.If the domain is restricted to profiles in which every individual has a single peaked preference with respect to the linear ordering, then simple <b>aggregation</b> <b>rules,</b> which includes majority rule, have an acyclic (defined below) social preference, hence [...] "best" [...] alternatives.
