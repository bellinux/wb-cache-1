5|$|Debate has {{occurred}} regarding whether the sea mink was its own species, or a subspecies of the <b>American</b> <b>mink.</b> Those {{who argue that}} the sea mink was a subspecies often {{refer to it as}} Neovison vison macrodon. A study in 1911 by Frederic Brewster Loomis, an American paleontologist, concluded that the differences between the <b>American</b> <b>mink</b> and the sea mink were too minute to justify the latter's classification as a separate species, and he named it Lutreola vison antiquus. A study conducted in 2000 by Mead et al. refuted Loomis by claiming that the size range for the largest sea mink specimen was beyond that of the <b>American</b> <b>mink,</b> thereby making it a separate species. But a 2001 study by Graham concluded that this size difference was insufficient evidence to classify the sea mink as its own species and that it should be considered a subspecies. Graham supposed that the size difference was caused by environmental factors. Furthermore, Graham reported that Mead assumed the smaller mink specimens to be the <b>American</b> <b>mink,</b> and the larger mink specimens outside the range of the <b>American</b> <b>mink</b> to be sea minks; this may have been a case of sexual dimorphism wherein all specimens were sea minks, the larger being male and the smaller being female. A 2007 study compared the dental makeup of the sea mink to the <b>American</b> <b>mink,</b> and concluded that they were distinct enough to be considered separate species.|$|E
5|$|Pettigrew State Park also {{provides}} habitats for eastern woodland mammals. Black bear and white-tailed deer inhabit the woods, as do Virginia opossum, raccoon, <b>American</b> <b>mink,</b> muskrat, North American river otter, fox, and bobcats. The endangered red wolf has been reintroduced to eastern North Carolina, including Pettigrew State Park.|$|E
5|$|The {{sea mink}} (Neovison macrodon) is a {{recently}} extinct species of mink {{from the eastern}} coast of North America in the family Mustelidae, the largest family in the order Carnivora. It was most {{closely related to the}} <b>American</b> <b>mink</b> (Neovison vison), with debate {{about whether or not the}} sea mink should be considered a subspecies of the <b>American</b> <b>mink</b> (making it Neovison vison macrodon) or a species of its own. The main justification for a separate species designation is the size difference between the two minks, but other distinctions have been made, such as its redder fur. The only known remains are fragments unearthed in Native American shell middens. Its actual size is speculative, based largely on tooth remains.|$|E
25|$|Sora {{eggs are}} eaten by several species {{including}} <b>American</b> <b>minks</b> (Mustela vison), skunks (Mephitidae), coyotes (Canis latrans), grackles (Quiscalus spp.), crows (Corvus spp.), and herons (Ardeidae). Predation of adult soras by <b>American</b> <b>minks,</b> coyotes and peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus) has been reported.|$|R

5|$|Eggs {{are taken}} {{by a number of}} mammals, {{including}} <b>American</b> <b>mink,</b> striped skunk, otters, foxes and racoons, with the latter being responsible for nearly 40% of all nest failures. Birds such as herring gulls, northern ravens and American crows will eat unattended eggs. Because their nests are at the water's edge, common loon eggs are especially vulnerable if the adult is absent.|$|E
5|$|The {{sea mink}} was first {{described}} as Lutreola macrodon, {{distinct from the}} <b>American</b> <b>mink,</b> by , a medical doctor and ornithologist, in 1903 after it became extinct. Prentiss based his description on skull fragments recovered from Native American shell middens in New England. Most sea mink remains, {{nearly all of them}} skull fragments, have come from shell middens, but a complete specimen has never been found.|$|E
5|$|As {{marine mammal}} species often play {{a large part}} in their ecosystems, it is {{possible}} that the sea mink was an important intertidal predator. It may have had a similar diet to the <b>American</b> <b>mink,</b> and may have consumed seabirds, seabird eggs, and hard-bodied marine invertebrates, though in greater proportions. Fur traders reported that sea mink dens had two entrances, and were made in the rocks piled up by the waves. Remains of toad sculpins and ocean pout were the most common around their dens, and garden banded snails were also reported to have been part of their diet. Their seafood-oriented diet may have increased their size. According to fur traders, the sea mink was nocturnal and resided in caves and rock crevices during the day. Due to the overlap of <b>American</b> <b>mink</b> and sea mink ranges, {{it is possible that}} they hybridized with each other. Although not a truly marine species, being confined to coastal waters, the sea mink was unusually aquatic compared to other members of Musteloidea, being, next to otters, the most aquatic member of the taxon.|$|E
5|$|The local fauna of the Three Sisters {{includes}} fish such as brook and rainbow trout, birds such as {{blue and}} ruffed grouse, and larger species like the Columbian black-tailed deer, mule deer, Roosevelt elk, and American black bear. In addition to predator bobcats, cougars, and coyotes, raccoons, martens, weasels, and <b>American</b> <b>minks</b> live throughout the Three Sisters area.|$|R

5|$|River otters often {{reside in}} beaver ponds. Encounters between otters and beavers are not {{necessarily}} hostile. In Idaho, otters and beavers were recorded in the same beaver lodge simultaneously on three separate occasions. The otters may compete with the <b>American</b> <b>mink</b> (Mustela vison) for resources. In Alaska, the two species living in marine environments indicate niche separation through resource partitioning, probably related to the swimming abilities of these mustelids.|$|E
5|$|The inaccessibility of many tern colonies {{gave them}} a measure of {{protection}} from mammalian predators, especially on islands, but introduced species brought by humans can seriously affect breeding birds. These can be predators such as foxes, raccoons, cats and rats, or animals that destroy the habitat, including rabbits, goats and pigs. Problems arise not only on formerly mammal-free islands, as in New Zealand, but also where an alien carnivore, such as the <b>American</b> <b>mink</b> in Scotland, presents an unfamiliar threat.|$|E
5|$|These minks {{were large}} and heavily built, {{with a low}} {{sagittal}} crest and short, wide postorbital processes (projections on the frontal bone behind the eye sockets). In fact, the most notable characteristic of the skull was its size, {{in that it was}} clearly larger than that of other mink species, having a wide rostrum, large nostril openings, large antorbital fenestrae (openings in the skull in front of the eye socket), and large teeth. Their large size was probably in response to their coastal environment, as the largest extant subspecies of <b>American</b> <b>mink,</b> the Alaskan mink (N. v. nesolestes), inhabits the Alexander Archipelago in Alaska, an area with a habitat similar to the Gulf of Maine. Mead, concluding that the mink was restricted to nearshore islands, suggested that the large size was due to insular gigantism. Since almost all members of the subfamily Mustelinae exhibit sexual dimorphism, male sea minks were probably larger than female sea minks. The sea mink's wider carnassial teeth and blunter carnassial blades suggest that they crushed hard shells more often than did the teeth of the <b>American</b> <b>mink.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{definitive}} hosts are fish-eating mammals such {{as domestic}} dogs (Canis lupus familiars), domestic cats (Felis catus), wolves (Canis lupus), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), gray foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), coyotes (Canis latrans), raccoons (Procyon lotor), muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus), <b>American</b> <b>minks</b> (Neovison vision), fishers (Martes pennanti), or bears. It can also infect humans. It {{lives in the}} bile duct and in the gallbladder.|$|R
5|$|Reindeer herds {{visit the}} grasslands in summer. Other animals include red and Arctic foxes, wolverines, moose, otters, and lynx in the {{southern}} areas. <b>American</b> <b>minks,</b> which were released near the Olenitsa River in 1935–1936, are now common throughout the peninsula and are commercially hunted. Beavers, which became endangered by 1880, were re-introduced in 1934–1957. All in all, thirty-two species of mammals and up to two hundred bird species inhabit the peninsula.|$|R
5000|$|Wild minks can be tamed {{if caught}} young, {{but can be}} {{difficult}} to handle and are usually not handled bare-handed. In the late 19th century, tame <b>American</b> <b>minks</b> were often reared for ratting, much as ferrets were used in Europe. They are sometimes more effective ratters than terriers, as they can enter rat holes and drive rats from their hiding places. Because of their fondness for bathing, captive <b>American</b> <b>minks</b> may enter kettles or other open water-containing vessels. When minks of wild stock are confined with tame ones, the latter invariably dominate the former. They have also been known to dominate cats in confrontations. Though intelligent, minks are not quick to learn tricks taught to them by their owners. Though domestic minks have been bred in captivity for almost a century, they have not been bred to be tame. Domestic minks have been bred for size, fur quality, and color. However, the U.S. Fur Commission claims [...] "mink are truly domesticated animals", {{based on the number of}} years they have been kept on fur farms.|$|R
5|$|Water voles are {{a highly}} {{threatened}} {{species in the}} UK, with a huge decline in numbers, mainly due to predation by the introduced <b>American</b> <b>mink.</b> They are still common at Titchwell, {{which is one of}} a number of East Anglian sites now of national importance for this species. Both common and grey seals can be seen off the beach. Other vertebrates include European eels, common toads and three-spined sticklebacks.|$|E
5|$|More than 250 {{wildlife}} species, including peregrine falcon, {{bald eagle}} and northern spotted owl {{are thought to}} frequent the watershed. Migratory birds such as loons use the basin for feeding and nesting as they travel along the Pacific Flyway. Native fish species include chinook and coho salmon, steelhead, coastal cutthroat trout, Pacific lamprey, and rainbow trout, but since 1922 the headworks dam or its successor, Dam 2, have blocked anadromous fish passage to the upper river and its tributaries. Many amphibian and reptile species thrive near streams and ponds. Roosevelt elk, American black bear, coyote, cougar, black-tailed deer, North American river otter, <b>American</b> <b>mink,</b> and North American beaver are among the mammals found in the watershed.|$|E
5|$|Predators of {{the corn}} crake on its European {{breeding}} grounds include feral and domestic cats, introduced <b>American</b> <b>mink,</b> feral ferrets, otters and red foxes, and birds including the common buzzard and hooded crow. In Lithuania, the introduced raccoon dog has also been recorded taking corn crakes. When chicks are exposed by rapid mowing, they may be taken by large birds including the white stork, harriers and other birds of prey, gulls and corvids. At undisturbed sites, nests and broods are rarely attacked, which {{is reflected in the}} high breeding success.|$|E
50|$|<b>American</b> <b>minks</b> are {{primarily}} used in manufacturing fur coats, jackets, and capes. Pelts {{which are not}} able to be converted into these items are made into trimming for cloth and fur coats. Mink scarves and stoles are also manufactured. Jackets and capes are mostly made from small to medium-sized specimens, usually females and young males, while trimming, scarves and stoles are made from adult males. The most valuable peltries come from eastern Canada which, although the smallest, are the silkiest and darkest.|$|R

She is buried at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific. In 2007, Central Oahu Regional Park on Oahu was renamed [...] "Patsy T. Mink Central Oahu Regional Park" [...] in her honor.|$|R
50|$|Breeding <b>American</b> <b>minks</b> {{for their}} fur {{began in the}} late 19th century, as {{increasing}} enthusiasm for mink pelts made the harvesting of wild minks insufficient to meet the new demands. <b>American</b> <b>minks</b> are easily kept in captivity, and breed readily. In 2005, the U.S. ranked fourth in production behind Denmark, China and the Netherlands. Minks typically breed in March, and give birth to their litters in May. Farmers vaccinate the young kits for botulism, distemper, enteritis, and, if needed, pneumonia. They are harvested in late November and December. Methods for killing animals on fur farms, as on all farms, are detailed in the American Veterinary Medical Association's Report on Euthanasia which is used as a voluntary guideline for state departments of agriculture which have jurisdiction over all farms raising domesticated livestock, including minks. In the past, some mink farms successfully provided pools of water for the mink to swim; however, this practice is unheard-of in modern mink production. Minks are motivated to access swimming water, and the absence of water is a source of frustration on modern farms. The ideal diet for farm-bred minks consists of four to five ounces of horse meat and a quarter-pint of milk once daily.|$|R
5|$|Predators on the {{breeding}} grounds include feral and domestic cats, introduced <b>American</b> <b>mink,</b> feral ferrets, otters and red foxes, and birds including the common buzzard and hooded crow. In Lithuania, the introduced raccoon dog {{has also been}} recorded as taking corn crakes. When chicks are exposed by rapid mowing, they may be taken by large birds including the white stork, harriers and other birds of prey, gulls and corvids. At undisturbed sites nests and broods are rarely attacked, as reflected in a high breeding success. There is a record of a corn crake on migration through Gabon being killed by a black sparrowhawk.|$|E
5|$|Southern Labrador {{is mostly}} taiga. It is {{characterized}} by low winter temperatures, a longer growing season, and more precipitation than the tundra. Soils are typically lacking important nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. The taiga is dominated by coniferous trees, notably balsam fir and black spruce, though the deciduous white birch, trembling aspen and mountain ash are also present. The most common animals are the moose, American black bear, Canada lynx, red fox, pine marten, short-tailed weasel, and <b>American</b> <b>mink.</b> Beavers, muskrats, and river otters thrive in the many rivers, streams, and wetlands. Willow ptarmigan, common raven, and blackpoll warbler inhabit the forests of southern Labrador while golden eagles, rough-legged hawks and peregrine falcons nest on steep cliffs.|$|E
5|$|Water voles are {{a highly}} {{threatened}} {{species in the}} UK, with a 70–90% decline in numbers mainly due to predation by the introduced <b>American</b> <b>mink,</b> but also habitat loss and water pollution. East Anglian sites of national importance for this species include Cley, Titchwell and other Norfolk coastal sites. Brown hares are widespread, and European otters may be seen at several locations. Both common and grey seals {{can be seen at}} the Blakeney Point colony and off the beaches. The common frog, common toad and common lizard all occur in suitable habitats, and the rare natterjack toad breeds at Holkham and Holme.|$|E

Male minks had higher (p< 0. 05) Creatin Kinase (CK) and Alanine aminotrotransferase (ALT) and lower (p< 0. 05) Amylase (AM) than females. However, the hematology values were not different by genders...|$|R
50|$|Fibricola lucida is a fluke that infects Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana), <b>American</b> <b>minks</b> (Neovison vison), and marsh rice rats (Oryzomys palustris) in North America. In a {{study in}} Florida, F. lucida was the only fluke of the marsh rice rat (among 21 species recorded) that {{occurred}} in both the freshwater marsh at Paynes Prairie and the saltwater marsh at Cedar Key.

5|$|The {{brown bear}} hibernates in the park, and {{two to four}} females have cubs {{in the park and}} the {{landscape}} protection area each year. Bears can also be found in transit between Russia and Finland. Other common mammals include red fox, stoat, least weasel, <b>American</b> <b>mink</b> and European pine marten. The population of moose has been increasing; its wear on the tree population affects the regrowth of trees. Norway lemming and wood lemming are uncommon; Eurasian lynx sometimes cross through the park. Pasvik is one of very few areas in Norway where Laxmann's shrew is found. Reindeer husbandry is permitted within the park, although the area is mostly used during the winter as the herds are moved out to Varangerfjorden for the summers. Raccoon dog is an introduced species to Europe and was first spotted in the national park area in 1983.|$|E
5|$|The {{sea mink}} was first {{described}} in 1903, after its extinction; information regarding its external appearance and habits stem from speculation and from accounts made by fur traders and Native Americans. It may have exhibited behavior {{similar to the}} <b>American</b> <b>mink,</b> in that it probably maintained home ranges, was polygynandrous, and had a similar diet, though more seaward-oriented. It was probably found on the New England coast and the Maritime Provinces, though its range may have stretched further south during the last glacial period. Conversely, its range may have been restricted solely to the New England coast, specifically the Gulf of Maine, or just to nearby islands. Largest of the minks, the sea mink was more desirable to fur traders and became extinct in the late 19th or early 20th century.|$|E

5000|$|Nesting colonies {{attracted}} {{large numbers}} of predators, including <b>American</b> <b>minks,</b> <b>American</b> weasels, American martens, and raccoons that preyed on eggs and nestlings, birds of prey, such as owls, hawks, and eagles that preyed on nestlings and adults, and wolves, foxes, bobcats, bears, and mountain lions that preyed on injured adults and fallen nestlings. Hawks of the genus Accipiter and falcons pursued and preyed upon pigeons in flight, which in turn executed complex aerial maneuvers to avoid them; Cooper's hawk {{was known as the}} [...] "great pigeon hawk" [...] due to its successes, and these hawks allegedly followed migrating passenger pigeons. While many predators were drawn to the flocks, individual pigeons were largely protected due to the sheer size of the flock, and overall little damage could be inflicted on the flock by predation. Despite the number of predators, nesting colonies were so large that they were estimated to have a 90% success rate if not disturbed. After being abandoned and leaving the nest, the very fat juveniles were vulnerable to predators until they were able to fly. The sheer number of juveniles on the ground meant that {{only a small percentage of}} them were killed; predator satiation may therefore be one of the reasons for the extremely social habits and communal breeding of the species.|$|R
