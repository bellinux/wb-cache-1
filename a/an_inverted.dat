5|$|CMDCM {{insignia}} {{are similar}} to the insignia for Master Chief, except that the rating symbol is replaced by <b>an</b> <b>inverted</b> five-point star, reflecting a change in their rating from their previous rating (i.e., MMCM) to CMDCM. The stars for Command Master Chief are silver, while stars for Fleet or Force Master Chief are gold. Additionally, CMDCMs wear a badge, worn on their left breast pocket, denoting their title (Command/Fleet/Force).|$|E

5|$|GateKeeper is a Wing Coaster model {{manufactured}} by Swiss roller coaster firm Bolliger & Mabillard. It is Cedar Point's third B roller coaster; the park also has Raptor, <b>an</b> <b>inverted</b> roller coaster, and Rougarou, a floorless roller coaster.

5|$|It {{can also}} be seen however that this simple 2-dimensional model, {{essentially}} <b>an</b> <b>inverted</b> pendulum on a turntable, predicts that the steady-state turn is unstable. If the bike is displaced slightly downwards from its equilibrium lean angle, the torque of gravity increases, that of centrifugal force decreases and the displacement gets amplified. A more-sophisticated model that allows a wheel to steer, adjust the path, and counter the torque of gravity, is necessary to capture the self-stability observed in real bikes.|$|E
5|$|Lyrically, {{the album}} deals with current affairs (primarily the Great Recession).

A Flash Flood of Colour demonstrated Enter Shikari's continued fusion of electronic and rock music influences. The album's cover depicts <b>an</b> <b>inverted</b> social hierarchy.|$|E

5|$|Nemesis is <b>an</b> <b>inverted</b> {{roller coaster}} {{located at the}} Alton Towers {{amusement}} park in England. The ride's concept and layout was devised by designer John Wardley. It was manufactured by Bolliger & Mabillard (B) and opened in March 1994. It {{is located in the}} Forbidden Valley area of the park, adjacent to Galactica (Previously Air), a Bolliger & Mabillard flying roller coaster; Nemesis: Sub-Terra, a dark ride manufactured by ABC rides, and The Blade, a HUSS Park Attractions pirate ship ride.|$|E
5|$|On 15May 1930, barely {{two weeks}} after delivery, one of the Bulldogs crashed due to {{structural}} failure while performing <b>an</b> <b>inverted</b> loop; the pilot parachuted to safety, the first time an RAAF member had done so in an emergency. In September 1931, Fighter Squadron began flight testing the prototype Wackett Warrigal general-purpose biplane; testing was still under way when the aircraft's undercarriage collapsed during landing, putting off its service trials until the following January.|$|E

5|$|Skeptics {{argue that}} {{conspiracy}} theorists grossly overestimate {{the influence of}} ex-Nazis and neo-Nazis on American society, and point out that political repression at home and imperialism abroad {{have a long history}} in the United States that predates the 20th century. Some political scientists, such as Sheldon Wolin, have expressed concern that the twin forces of democratic deficit and superpower status have paved the way in the U.S. for the emergence of <b>an</b> <b>inverted</b> totalitarianism which contradicts many principles of Nazism.|$|E

5|$|The {{forward speed}} at which {{oscillations}} begin, at about 1m/s (2.2mph) in this example, sometimes called the double root speed due to there being a repeated root to the characteristic polynomial (two of the four eigenvalues have exactly the same value). Below this speed, the bike simply falls over as <b>an</b> <b>inverted</b> pendulum does.|$|E
5|$|The mid-engine {{complicated}} {{the design of}} the four-wheel drive system, and an innovative solution was needed to get drive {{from the rear of the}} engine to the front wheels. The chosen design took the front-wheel drive from the central differential on the rear transaxle and sent it through the V in the centre of the engine using a quill drive, before joining <b>an</b> <b>inverted</b> differential. The clutch was a twin-plate unit designed by AP Racing.|$|E
5|$|The mildest form of hepatic {{encephalopathy}} {{is difficult to}} detect clinically, but may be demonstrated on neuropsychological testing.

The second stage is marked by lethargy and personality changes. The third stage is marked by worsened confusion. The fourth stage {{is marked by a}} progression to coma.|$|E

5|$|Batista and Orton {{decided to}} work {{together}} to assault Bryan, and the original referee returned to the match. At ringside, Batista threw Bryan down with a Batista Bomb onto the Spanish announce table, while Orton immediately combined with <b>an</b> <b>inverted</b> version of his signature RKO maneuver. As both Bryan and Orton were sent through the Spanish announce table, only Batista emerged unscathed. Medical personnel arrived and carted Bryan away on a stretcher. Batista attacked Orton, who retaliated with a DDT onto the floor. Suddenly, Bryan got off the stretcher and crawled back to the ring, where he was set upon by Orton.|$|E
5|$|Death metal, like thrash metal, {{generally}} {{rejects the}} theatrics of earlier metal styles, opting instead for an everyday look of ripped jeans and plain leather jackets. One major {{exception to this}} rule was Deicide's Glen Benton, who branded <b>an</b> <b>inverted</b> cross on his forehead and wore armor on stage. Morbid Angel adopted neo-fascist imagery. These two bands, along with Death and Obituary, were leaders of the major death metal scene that emerged in Florida in the mid-1980s. In the UK, the related style of grindcore, led by bands such as Napalm Death and Extreme Noise Terror, emerged from the anarcho-punk movement.|$|E
5|$|Debra's origins {{were from}} an area of {{convection}} over the western Bahamas and Florida related to an upper-tropospheric cold-core low and a tropical wave on July15. Whilst {{under the influence of}} a subtropical ridge–or a belt of high pressure–it slowly meandered southwestward and arrived into the Gulf of Mexico on July20. A weak surface circulation was observed near 1900EST (0100UTC on July21) which was affected by <b>an</b> <b>inverted</b> trough as they turned westward. The system's circulation remained indistinct until July23 as winds of 22–30knots consorted with squalls adjacent to the coasts of Louisiana and Texas.|$|E
