5|$|Brezhnev's health worsened in {{the winter}} of 1981–82. In the meantime, the country was governed by Andrei Gromyko, Dmitriy Ustinov, Mikhail Suslov and Yuri Andropov while crucial Politburo {{decisions}} were made in his absence. While the Politburo was pondering the question of who would succeed, <b>all</b> <b>signs</b> indicated that the ailing leader was dying. The choice of the successor would have been influenced by Suslov, but he {{died at the age of}} 79 in January 1982. Andropov took Suslov's seat in the Central Committee Secretariat; by May, it became obvious that Andropov would try to make a bid for the office of the General Secretary. He, with the help of fellow KGB associates, started circulating rumours that political corruption had become worse during Brezhnev's tenure as leader, in an attempt to create an environment hostile to Brezhnev in the Politburo. Andropov's actions showed that he was not afraid of Brezhnev's wrath.|$|E

5|$|In 1990, Wilkinson's wife, Martha, {{announced}} that she would seek the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1991. The move was widely seen as a surrogate candidacy so that her husband could continue his administration for a second consecutive term. Her challengers included Lieutenant Governor Jones, Lexington mayor Scotty Baesler, and Dr. Floyd G. Poore, the former Kentucky highway director. With polls consistently showing little support for her candidacy, Mrs. Wilkinson {{dropped out of the}} race in May 1991. Earlier in the year, Wallace Wilkinson was diagnosed with limited-stage Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This diagnosis was also a factor in Ms. Wilkinson's withdrawal from the race. Wallace underwent surgery at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, then received radiation therapy at the University of Kentucky. These treatments eliminated <b>all</b> <b>signs</b> of the disease by 1993, and doctors gave Wilkinson an excellent chance of recovery.|$|E
5|$|On August24, Marie {{developed}} an eye and rapidly intensified to a Category5 hurricane with winds of 160mph (260km/h). At its peak, the hurricane's gale-force winds spanned an area 575mi (925km) across. Marie subsequently underwent an eyewall replacement cycle on August25 which prompted steady weakening. Over {{the next several}} days, Marie progressively degraded to below hurricane strength as it moved into an increasingly hostile environment with cooler waters and a more stable atmosphere. On August29, after having lost <b>all</b> <b>signs</b> of organized deep convection, Marie degenerated into a remnant low. The large system gradually wound down over the following several days, with winds subsiding below gale-force on August30. The remnant cyclone eventually lost a well defined center and dissipated on September2 about 1,200mi (1,950km) northeast of Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{depression}} was forecast to reach maximum strength as {{a tropical storm}} before weakening, and only the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory's hurricane model predicted it to attain hurricane status. However, low amounts of wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures favored further intensification. After being previously removed from the primary thunderstorm activity, the circulation became situated beneath a persistent area of deep convection. It is estimated the cyclone intensified into Tropical Storm Kenneth early on September 15. The storm quickly developed banding features—spiral rain showers of convection—as its convection formed into a central area of deep convection. These were <b>all</b> <b>signs</b> for further development, and Kenneth attained hurricane status early on September 16. By September 17, the hurricane had finished an eyewall replacement cycle, meaning its original eye {{was replaced by a}} larger, better defined eye. As a result, it quickly intensified and attained major hurricane status. With a 23mile (37km) wide eye surrounded by very cold cloud tops, Kenneth strengthened to reach peak sustained winds of 135mph (215km/h), a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale, on September 18 about 1725miles (2790km) east of the Big Island of Hawaii.|$|E
