5|$|The {{international}} US-based {{credit rating}} agencies—Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch—which {{have already been}} under fire during the housing bubble and the Icelandic crisis—have also played a central and controversial role in the current European bond market crisis. On one hand, the <b>agencies</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> accused of giving overly generous ratings due to conflicts of interest. On the other hand, ratings agencies {{have a tendency to}} act conservatively, and to take some time to adjust when a firm or country is in trouble. In the case of Greece, the market responded to the crisis before the downgrades, with Greek bonds trading at junk levels several weeks before the ratings agencies began to describe them as such.|$|E

25|$|Most {{international}} aid <b>agencies</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> withdrawing workers from {{some areas of}} the Sahel, due to the regional kidnapping crisis. Niger's government spokesman Mahamane Lawali Danda told the B.B.C. that the pullout was a surprise to him since no one had told him or his government that Niger was on the list of dangerous 'kidnapper infested' pariah nations, along with Chad, Darfur and Sudan. Strangely, Mauritania and Mali were not on the list of dangerous nations, despite several al-Qaeda lead kidnappings in both during 2009.|$|E

25|$|In {{the last}} decade or so, mezcal, {{especially}} from Oaxaca, has been exported. Exportation has been on the increase and government <b>agencies</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> helping smaller-scale producers obtain the equipment and techniques needed to produce higher quantities and qualities for export. The National Program of Certification of the Quality of Mezcal certifies places of origin for export products. Mezcal is sold in 27 countries on three continents. The two countries that import the most are the United States and Japan. In the United States, a number of entrepreneurs have teamed up with Mexican producers to sell their products in the country, by promoting its handcrafted quality, as well as the Oaxacan culture strongly associated with it.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, the Central Park Conservancy, the United States Department of Agriculture, and several {{city and state}} <b>agencies</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{fighting}} an infestation of the Asian long-horned beetle, which {{has been reported in}} Long Island and Manhattan, including some parts of Central Park. The beetle, which likely was accidentally shipped from its native China in an untreated shipping crate, has no natural predators in the United States, and the fight to contain its infestation has been very expensive. The beetle infests trees by boring a hole in them to deposit its eggs, at which point the only way to end the infestation is to destroy the tree. Several thousand trees were infected in the city and later removed, including 2 trees that were removed from Central Park.|$|E

25|$|Under the Lebanese {{employment}} system, recruitment {{agencies are}} liable to provide a replacement within {{the first three months}} after a migrant domestic worker decides to discontinue work. These first three months are a preliminary “trial period”. In order to minimize having to do this, agencies advice employers to take measures to limit the freedom of the migrant domestic workers through the confiscation of their passport and restrict their communication with the outside world. Recruitment <b>agencies</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> known to encourage employers to place restrictions on migrant domestic workers which include the confiscation of their passport and confinement to the residence. Recruitment agencies in Lebanon receive very little state supervision. A Human Rights Watch report found that workers are often made false promises about the country they are moving to, as well as the work they will do, and the conditions expected in the workplace. They are also misled about the salaries they can expect to receive.|$|E
25|$|When {{the first}} Bloodhounds were {{exported}} to the USA is not known. Bloodhounds {{were used to}} track runaway slaves before the American Civil War, {{but it has been}} questioned whether the dogs used were genuine Bloodhounds. However, in the later part of the 19th century, and in the next, more pure Bloodhounds were introduced from Britain, and bred in America, especially after 1888, when the English breeder, Edwin Brough, brought three of his hounds to exhibit at the Westminster KC show in New York City. He went into partnership with Mr J L Winchell, who with other Americans, imported more stock from Britain. Bloodhounds in America have been more widely used in tracking lost people and criminals - often with brilliant success - than in Britain, and the history of the Bloodhound in America is full of the man-trailing exploits of outstanding Bloodhounds and their expert handlers, the most famous hound being Nick Carter. Law enforcement <b>agencies</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> much involved in the use of Bloodhounds, and there is a , originating in 1962.|$|E
