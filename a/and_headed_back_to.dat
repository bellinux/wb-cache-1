5|$|Not {{much had}} {{changed by the}} 1960s. The day began with a waking bell at 6:45am.

5|$|By {{the time}} Scharnhorst arrived in Norway in March 1943, Allied convoys to the Soviet Union had {{temporarily}} ceased. To give the ships {{an opportunity to}} work together, Admiral Karl Dönitz, who had replaced Raeder {{in the aftermath of}} the Battle of the Barents Sea on 31 December 1942, ordered an attack on the island of Spitzbergen, which housed a British weather station and refuelling base. Several settlements and outposts on Spitzbergen were defended by a garrison of 152 men from the Norwegian Armed Forces in exile. The two battleships, escorted by ten destroyers, left port on 6 September; in a ruse de guerre, Tirpitz flew the white ensign on the approach to the island the following day. During the bombardment, Tirpitz fired 52 main-battery shells and 82 rounds from her 15cm secondaries. This was the first and only time the ship fired her main battery at an enemy surface target. An assault force destroyed shore installations and captured 74 prisoners. By 11:00, the battleships had destroyed their targets <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> their Norwegian ports.|$|E
5|$|The {{house on}} Hadley Common was a citadel of riotous insolvency—not just at Christmas but every weekend. There {{was a great}} sense of {{in-depth}} back-up, a cellar, a barrel of malt whisky, a walk-in larder: proof against snowstorm or shutdown. I think it was that Christmas morning , that all four Amises, with breakfast trays on their laps, watched Journey to the Centre of the Earth—then the visit to the pub, then the day-long, the week-long lunch. And with Kingsley the hub of all humour and high spirits, like an engine of comedy... I felt so secure in that house—and, clearly, so insecure elsewhere—that I always experienced a caress of apprehension as I climbed into the car on Sunday night, any Sunday night, <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the motorway and Monday, to the flat or the flatlet, the street, the job, the tramp dread, the outside world.|$|E

25|$|Much {{information}} on Toole between 1966 and 1973 is unclear, {{but it is}} believed that he began drifting around the Southwestern United States and that he supported himself by prostitution and panhandling. While living in Nebraska, Toole was one of the prime suspects in the 1974 murder of 24-year-old Patricia Webb. Shortly after, he left Nebraska and briefly settled in Boulder, Colorado. One month later, he became a prime suspect in the homicide of 31-year-old Ellen Holman, who was murdered on October 14, 1974.

25|$|On {{the first}} day Tryon feinted, pretending to send out two torpedo boats and a battleship, causing Markham to scurry to intercept. For {{the next two days}} he did nothing, except fire {{occasional}} shots at Markham's ships from shore batteries if they came too close. On the fourth evening he sent out two torpedo boats showing no lights with the intention of starting more false alarms. The boats did well, returning with four enemy torpedo boats which they had surprised and captured. By 3 August the enemy had been at sea for nine days and aside from the tedium of their wait would now be low on coal. Tryon ordered all ships to be ready to sail at 9.30pm on 3 August and for all the upper parts of the ships to be painted black. The fastest ships, Warspite, Iris, Severn, Volage, Cossack and three torpedo boats left via the western entrance, staying as close to the shore as they dared, heading for the Atlantic. Meanwhile, Tryon took the remaining larger ships through the eastern entrance, giving the appearance of an attempt to break through the blockading ships. Within an hour the Hercules was spotted and great excitement broke out amongst the blockaders. Tryon immediately turned around <b>and</b> <b>headed</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> port. Just as they returned to anchor, flares at sea showed that, too late, one blockader had spotted Tryon's escaping ships.|$|E
