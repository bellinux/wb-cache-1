25|$|The Mark III design {{encompassed}} {{the greatest}} {{improvement in the}} technology since its commercialisation. The focus {{was to make the}} technology more robust <b>and</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> in operations. The total redesign of the downcomer assembly allowed it to be isolated and unblocked much more easily compared to the Mark II design. The Mark III design also saw slurry flow per downcomer to be increased from 60m3/h to 75–85m3/h using larger orifice sizes in the slurry lenses.|$|E
25|$|The closest tools {{similar to}} a niddy-noddy are the swift, and the spinner's weasel. Some swifts need to be {{attached}} to the table, and even folding swifts tend to be a bit inconvenient to fold and carry and thus are not as portable as a niddy-noddy, and while the swift has other uses (mainly being to hold skeins for balling), it is not as convenient as the niddy-noddy for creating a skein, nor does it allow one to calculate the yardage as easily. A spinner's weasel is also not portable, however it does measure the yardage, and is faster <b>and</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>use.</b>|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the basic}} {{concepts}} and mechanisms of early versions of MS-DOS resembled those of CP/M. Internals like file-handling data structures were identical, and both referred to disk drives with a letter (A:, B:, etc.). MS-DOS's main innovation was its FAT file system. This similarity {{made it easier to}} port popular CP/M software like WordStar and dBase. However, CP/M's concept of separate user areas for files on the same disk was never ported to MS-DOS. Since MS-DOS had access to more memory (as few IBM PCs were sold with less than 64 KB of memory, while CP/M could run in 16 KB if necessary), more commands were built into the command-line shell, making MS-DOS somewhat faster <b>and</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> on floppy-based computers.|$|E

500|$|The {{emergence}} of synth-pop {{has been described}} as [...] "perhaps the single most significant event in melodic music since Mersey-beat". By the 1980s synthesizers had become much cheaper <b>and</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>use.</b> After the definition of MIDI in 1982 and the development of digital audio, the creation of purely electronic sounds and their manipulation became much simpler. Synthesizers came to dominate the pop music of the early 1980s, particularly through their adoption by bands of the New Romantic movement.|$|E
500|$|They {{said that}} its [...] "over-the-top" [...] action and {{emphasis}} on player freedom would distinguish Just Cause 2 from other open world games. According to Peter Johansson, many gameplay mechanics were so [...] "crazy" [...] that they hesitated when testing the game; they {{were included in}} the final product because it was thought that they would make the game fun to play, meeting the franchise's main goal of performing many stunts in a massive open world. Since Just Cause grappling hook was praised, the team made it more accessible <b>and</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> as {{an essential part of the}} sequel's combat system. The team also refined the parachute, making it more realistic and giving players more control of its movement. They added the Chaos system, enhancing player freedom by allowing them to progress through the game in a number of ways instead of completing missions.|$|E

Also, since Notepad lacks {{advanced}} formatting functionality, many people find its simple, minimalistic user interface (whose look has never changed since Windows 3.1 and whose menus were last altered in Windows XP, when [...] "Format" [...] and [...] "View" [...] replaced [...] "Search") faster <b>and</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> for basic text operations.

2500|$|Gas {{chromatography}} (GC), {{also sometimes}} known as gas-liquid chromatography, (GLC), is a separation technique {{in which the}} mobile phase is a gas. Gas chromatographic separation is always carried out in a column, which is typically [...] "packed" [...] or [...] "capillary". [...] Packed columns are the routine work horses of gas chromatography, being cheaper <b>and</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> and often giving adequate performance. [...] Capillary columns generally give far superior resolution and although more expensive are becoming widely used, especially for complex mixtures. [...] Both types of column are made from non-adsorbent and chemically inert materials. Stainless steel and glass are the usual materials for packed columns and quartz or fused silica for capillary columns.|$|E
2500|$|A lot of {{research}} is currently being carried out {{in order to make}} EEG devices smaller, more portable <b>and</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>use.</b> So called [...] "Wearable EEG" [...] is based upon creating low power wireless collection electronics and ‘dry’ electrodes which do not require a conductive gel to be used. Wearable EEG aims to provide small EEG devices which are present only on the head and which can record EEG for days, weeks, or months at a time, as ear-EEG. Such prolonged and easy-to-use monitoring could make a step change in the diagnosis of chronic conditions such as epilepsy, and greatly improve the end-user acceptance of BCI systems. Research is also being carried out on identifying specific solutions to increase the battery lifetime of Werable EEG devices through the use of the data reduction approach. For example, in the context of epilepsy diagnosis, data reduction has been used to extend the battery lifetime of Werable EEG devices by intelligently selecting, and only transmitting, diagnostically relevant EEG data.|$|E
2500|$|For 1994, Grand Prix {{went through}} a mid-generation [...] "facelift" [...] inside and out, {{as well as a}} {{reshuffling}} of the lineup. First, LE and STE models were discontinued. The GT and GTP became option packages on the SE sedan and coupe, respectively. These option packages included the revised 3.4L V6, sport suspension, ground effects. Outside, there was a new front and rear fascia and new ground effects. Inside, a new instrument panel hosted dual airbags, much larger <b>and</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> controls, and seatbelts were moved to the B-pillars rather than the doors on sedans only; coupes retained the automatic seatbelt design. Under the hood, the 3.1L V6 was changed to the 3100 SFI V6 with , while the 3.4L V6 had [...] The Grand Prix Sedan also had a slight tail light revision using the amber over red pattern as opposed to the red over amber in years past; however, the coupe's tail lights remained the same.
