60|$|The very {{simplicity}} and nakedness of man's {{life in the}} primitive ages imply this advantage, at least, that they left him still but a sojourner in nature. When he was refreshed with food and sleep, he contemplated his journey again. He dwelt, as it were, in a tent in this world, and was either threading the valleys, or crossing the plains, or climbing the mountain-tops. But lo! men have become the tools of their tools. The man who independently plucked the fruits when he was hungry is become a farmer; and he who stood under a tree for shelter, a housekeeper. We now no longer camp as for a night, but have settled down on earth and forgotten heaven. We have adopted Christianity merely as an improved method of agri-culture. We have built for this world a family mansion, {{and for the next}} a family tomb. The best works of art are the expression of man's struggle to free himself from this condition, but the effect of our art is merely to make this low state comfortable and that higher state to be forgotten. There is actually no place in this village for a work of fine art, if any had come down to us, to stand, for our lives, our houses and streets, furnish no proper pedestal for it. There is not a nail to hang a picture on, nor a shelf to receive the bust of a hero or a saint. When I consider how our houses are built and paid for, or not paid for, and their internal economy managed <b>and</b> <b>sustained,</b> <b>I</b> wonder that the floor does not give way under the visitor while he is admiring the gewgaws upon the mantelpiece, and let him through into the cellar, to some solid and honest though earthy foundation. I cannot but perceive that this so-called rich and refined life is a thing jumped at, and I do not get on in the enjoyment of the fine arts which adorn it, my attention being wholly occupied with the jump; for I remember that the greatest genuine leap, due to human muscles alone, on record, is that of certain wandering Arabs, who are said to have cleared twenty-five feet on level ground. Without factitious support, man is sure to come to earth again beyond that distance. The first question which I am tempted to put to the proprietor of such great impropriety is, Who bolsters you? Are you one of the ninety-seven who fail, or the three who succeed? Answer me these questions, and then perhaps I may look at your bawbles and find them ornamental. The cart before the horse is neither beautiful nor useful. Before we can adorn our houses with beautiful objects the walls must be stripped, and our lives must be stripped, and beautiful housekeeping and beautiful living be laid for a foundation: now, a taste for the beautiful is most cultivated out of doors, where there is no house and no housekeeper.|$|E
6000|$|This {{conversation}} occurred {{the night}} before I went back to town. I settled on the morrow to take a late train, so that I had still my morning to spend at Folkestone, where during {{the greater part of}} it I was out with my mother. Every one in the place was as usual out with some one else, and even had I been free to go and take leave of her I should have been sure that Flora Saunt would not be at home. Just where she was I presently discovered: she was {{at the far end of}} the cliff, the point at which it overhangs the pretty view of Sandgate and Hythe. Her back however was turned to this attraction; it rested with the aid of her elbows, thrust slightly behind her so that her scanty little shoulders were raised toward her ears, on the high rail that inclosed the down. Two gentlemen stood before her whose faces we couldn't see but who even as observed from the rear were visibly absorbed in the charming figure-piece submitted to them. I was freshly struck with the fact that this meagre and defective little person, with the cock of her hat and the flutter of her crape, with her eternal idleness, her eternal happiness, her absence of moods and mysteries and the pretty presentation of her feet, which especially now in the supported slope of her posture occupied with their imperceptibility so much of the foreground--I was reminded anew, I say, how our young lady dazzled by some art that the enumeration of her merits didn't explain and that the mention of her lapses didn't affect. Where she was amiss nothing counted, and where she was right everything did. I say she was wanting in mystery, but that after all was her secret. This happened to be my first chance of introducing her to my mother, who had not much left in life but the quiet look from under the hood of her chair at the things which, when she should have quitted those she loved, she could still trust to make the world good for them. I wondered an instant how much she might be moved to trust Flora Saunt, and then while the chair stood still and she waited I went over and asked the girl to come and speak to her. In this way I saw that if one of Flora's attendants was the inevitable young Hammond Synge, master of ceremonies of her regular court, always offering the use of a telescope and accepting that of a cigar, the other was a personage I had not yet encountered, a small pale youth in showy knickerbockers, whose eyebrows and nose and the glued points of whose little moustache were extraordinarily uplifted <b>and</b> <b>sustained.</b> <b>I</b> remember taking him at first for a foreigner and for something of a pretender: I scarcely know why, unless because of the motive I felt in the stare he fixed on me when I asked Miss Saunt to come away. He struck me a little as a young man practising the social art of [...] "impertinence"; but it didn't matter, for Flora came away with alacrity, bringing all her prettiness and pleasure and gliding over the grass in that rustle of delicate mourning which made the endless variety of her garments, as a painter could take heed, strike one always as the same obscure elegance. She seated herself on the floor of my mother's chair, a little too much on her right instep as I afterwards gathered, caressing her stiff hand, smiling up into her cold face, commending and approving her without a reserve and without a doubt. She told her immediately, as if it were something for her to hold on by, that she was soon to sit to me for a [...] "likeness," [...] and these words gave me a chance to inquire if it would be the fate of the picture, should I finish it, to be presented to the young man in the knickerbockers. Her lips, at this, parted in a stare; her eyes darkened to the purple of one of the shadow-patches on the sea. She showed for the passing instant the face of some splendid tragic mask, and I remembered for the inconsequence of it what Mrs. Meldrum had said about her sight. I had derived from this lady a worrying impulse to catechise her, but that didn't seem exactly kind; so I substituted another question, inquired who the pretty young man in knickerbockers might happen to be.|$|E

How can learners be provoked into actively working on and {{making sense of the}} ideas and techniques that they encounter, and how can this cultural ethos be fostered <b>and</b> <b>sustained?</b> <b>I</b> use the term asserting because of the assonance with assenting, but also because it signals that the learner is taking initiative and making significant choices.

40|$|Graduation date: 2004 In this thesis, I examine {{some of the}} {{relationships}} between hierarchy and community that exist in institutions. Within institutions, individuals are separated from one another and organized hierarchically based on arbitrary inequalities. In general, I discusses inequalities based on race, class, gender, sexual orientation, age, ability, etc. Institutions organized based on arbitrary inequalities cannot create <b>and</b> <b>sustain</b> a whole community since such inequalities result in hostile or coercive treatment of individuals based on characteristics or criteria over which they have no control. If it is true that people want and/or need community, then it matters a great deal for us to know whether or not community can exist in hierarchical institutions, since certain kinds of hierarchies interfere with building <b>and</b> <b>sustaining</b> community. <b>I</b> explain how the concept of "whole community" allows for the unity of unequal beings, provided that the inequalities are based on merit.

40|$|Motivational manipulations, {{such as the}} {{presence}} of performance-contingent reward incentives, can have substantial influences on cognitive control. Previous evidence suggests that reward incentives may enhance cognitive performance specifically through increased preparatory, or proactive, control processes. The present study examined reward influences on cognitive control dynamics in the AX-Continuous Performance Task (AX-CPT), using high-resolution pupillometry. In the AX-CPT, contextual cues must be actively maintained over a delay in order to appropriately respond to ambiguous target probes. A key feature of the task is that it permits dissociable characterization of preparatory, proactive control processes (i. e., utilization of context) and reactive control processes (i. e., target-evoked interference resolution). Task performance profiles suggested that reward incentives enhanced proactive control (context utilization). Critically, pupil dilation was also increased on reward incentive trials during context maintenance periods, suggesting trial-specific shifts in proactive control, particularly when context cues indicated the need to overcome the dominant target response bias. Reward incentives had both transient (i. e., trial-by-trial) <b>and</b> <b>sustained</b> (<b>i.</b> e., block-based) effects on pupil dilation, which may reflect distinct underlying processes. The transient pupillary effects were present even when comparing against trials matched in task performance, suggesting a unique motivational influence of reward incentives.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of the IRS Form 990 Schedule H and the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable and Care Act (ACA) has challenged not-for-profit (NFP) health systems and hospitals to reassess the charitable practices that afford them tax-exemption. Many NFP health systems have been prompted to reexamine their roles, contributions, and impact in the communities they serve. These organizations have begun to explore alternative means to plan and strategically provide community benefit. As the regulatory landscape changes, the decision-making of leadership around community engagement may call for more transparent community engagement and efficient strategies that target specified needs. This will ultimately affect the goals and types of partnerships that are formed with various community stakeholders. This research examines how large not-for-profit health care delivery systems establish partnerships aimed to improve community health. It is an exploratory project that examines the types of partnerships that these organizations engage in at system and hospital levels to affect the social and environmental conditions of their communities. Case studies were built around three different types of partnerships implemented by NFP health systems and hospitals through their projects and programs with community stakeholders. Each case study analyzed what took place before and while NFP health providers implemented partnerships directed toward community health. Through cross-case analysis, {{the degree to which}} principles of community-based public health and corporate social responsibility factor into the form, structure, and purposes of those partnerships were assessed. Based on qualitative and quantitative data, four key characteristics were found to be consistent across the three partnership strategies examined. The findings emphasize the importance of purposeful strategic planning that is aligned with an organization's mission and responsive to its market environments. They also highlight the value of stakeholder engagement that is flexible, empowered, <b>and</b> <b>sustained.</b> <b>I</b> explore the implications of these findings {{in the context of the}} evolving policy and market landscapes shaped by new requirements of the IRS and the Affordable Care Act...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} spiritual, social and economic capital in a small religious community in Varanasi, India. Varanasi is one of India s holiest cities, and is home to many renouncers (sadhus). These individuals will often have a body of devotees {{that live in the}} religious organisation (ashram), which is controlled by the sadhu. My fieldwork was conducted in one such organisation from January to August, 2005, and the main question I have sought to answer is: How, and to what extent, are spiritual transactions between a sadhu and a devotee constrained and determined by social and economic processes within the social organisation these transactions generate <b>and</b> <b>sustain?</b> <b>I</b> have proceeded from a detailed description of forms of worship, to an exploration of the social organisation in this community. My theoretical framework has been based on transaction analysis and the concepts of spiritual and social capital. Through forms of worship, which I have analysed as spiritual transactions, an individual accumulates spiritual capital. This signifies a change in disposition and position in the social organisation, and this form of capital can in some instances be converted into social or economic capital. The opposite process has also been investigated, and I contend that the benefits an individual receives from the ashram are largely contingent on the volume of various forms of capital acquired, and the success one has in conversions of capital. The social organisation generated <b>and</b> <b>sustained</b> by these spiritual, social and economic transactions has been analysed as a series of networks fanning out from the sadhu. Although the Indian sadhu has often been seen as being isolated {{from the rest of the}} society, as an individual-outside-the-world opposed to the man-in-the-world, my study shows that it is difficult to maintain such a dichotomy. I demonstrate that both the sadhu and his devotees are involved in a complex matrix of relationships, which allow them to exchange various resources, and that the motivation people have for approaching this sadhu can be multifaceted and diverse...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Chronic beta-adrenoceptor {{antagonist}} (&# 946;-blocker) treatment {{reduces the}} incidence of reversion to AF in patients, possibly via an adaptive myocardial response. However, the underlying electrophysiological mechanisms are presently unclear. We aimed to investigate electrophysiological changes in human atrial cells associated with chronic treatment with &# 946;-blockers and other cardiovascular-acting drugs. Methods: Myocytes were isolated enzymatically from the right atrial appendage of 40 consenting patients who were in sinus rhythm. The cellular action potential duration (APD), effective refractory period (ERP), L-type Ca 2 + current (I CaL), transient (I TO) <b>and</b> <b>sustained</b> (<b>I</b> KSUS) outward K + currents, and input resistance (R i) were recorded using the whole cell patch clamp. Drug treatments and clinical characteristics were compared with electrophysiological measurements using simple and multiple regression analyses. P&# 60; 0. 05 was taken as statistically significant. Results: In atrial cells from patients treated chronically with &# 946;-blockers, the APD 90 and ERP (75 beats/min stimulation) were significantly longer, at 213 &# 177; 11 and 233 &# 177; 11 ms, respectively (n = 15 patients), than in cells from non-&# 946;-blocked patients, at 176 &# 177; 12 and 184 &# 177; 12 ms (n = 11). These cells also displayed a significantly reduced action potential phase 1 velocity (22 &# 177; 3 vs. 34 &# 177; 3 V/s). Chronic &# 946;-blockade was also associated with {{a significant reduction in}} the heart rate (58 &# 177; 3 vs. 69 &# 177; 5 beats/min) and in the density of ITO (8. 7 &# 177; 1. 3 vs. 13. 7 &# 177; 2. 1 pA/pF), an increase in the Ri (214 &# 177; 24 vs. 132 &# 177; 14 M&# 937;), but no significant change in I CaL or I KSUS. The I TO blocker 4 -aminopyridine largely mimicked the changes in phase 1 and ERP associated with chronic &# 946;-blockade, in cells from non-&# 946;-blocked patients. Chronic treatment of patients with calcium channel blockers or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (n = 11 – 13 patients) was not associated with any significant changes in atrial cell electrophysiology. Conclusion: The observed atrial cellular electrophysiological changes associated with chronic &# 946;-blockade are consistent with a long-term adaptive response, a type of ‘pharmacological remodelling’, and provide mechanistic evidence supportive of the anti-arrhythmic actions of &# 946;-blockade...|$|E
40|$|Tourette Syndrome (TS) is {{characterized}} primarily by multiple motor and vocal tics. Additionally cognitive deficits, such as problems with attention, may also exist, in those both {{with and without}} co-morbid Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Although neuroleptics, which block dopamine receptors, are often the treatment of choice for TS, insufficient symptomatic control often {{requires the use of}} increased doses. In addition, undesirable side effects can occur at high doses of neuroleptics, including detrimental effects on attention and concentration. Nicotine has been reported to effectively potentiate neuroleptic-induced catalepsy in rats and, when combined with neuroleptics, to reduce motor and vocal tics in TS patients. However, reported acute <b>and</b> <b>sustained</b> (<b>i.</b> e. up to 8 weeks) nicotine-induced improvements in tic symptomatology in TS patients have come from case reports, open and single blind studies. Nicotine alone has been shown to improve attention and cognition in both normal and neuropsychiatric populations. This double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design study investigated the comparative efficacy, both acute and sustained, of placebo and a single test dose of transdermal nicotine patch (TNP) on clinical symptoms of TS (i. e. tics), evaluative ratings (by parents) of attention and maladaptive behaviours, as well as event-related potential (ERP) and behavioural performance measures extracted from a degraded stimulus continuous performance task (DS-CPT) of sustained attention. Twenty-three children and adolescents with TS (with and without co-morbid ADHD), aged 8 [...] 17, who were taking conventional neuroleptics (i. e. dopamine D- 2 receptor antagonists) were entered into the study. Adjunctive nicotine, relative to placebo, failed to significantly alter tic symptomatology in either the acute (i. e. 4 hours post-treatment) or follow-up (i. e. 1 week post treatment) conditions. At follow-up but not at acute assessment, parents reported non-specific improvements in attention, and performance was found to have improved on Coding, a visuomotor task measuring freedom from distractibility, following nicotine treatment. Nicotine had a limited effect on area measures of the P 300 component of the ERP, by preventing area decrements seen following placebo treatment. However, other performance measures on the DS-CPT, including accuracy and speed of responding, and P 300 amplitude and latency measures, failed to identify any significant effects of nicotine relative to placebo. Given the lack of initial significant effects of a single dose challenge of nicotine and the side effect profile of the TNP, the clinical use of adjunctive nicotine in neuroleptically treated children and adolescents with TS appears premature...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{understand}} the long run demand for energy-related environmental quality, its influence on legislation and on transitions to low polluting energy sources. It starts by presenting a simple framework of the relationship between the demand for and supply of environmental quality, environmental legislation and energy. This forms the structure for presenting a series of episodes in British history where a demand for improvements in energy-related environmental quality existed. This analysis proposes that markets can drive transitions to low polluting energy sources, in specific economic conditions. However, most probably, governments will need to push them, and this cannot be expected without strong <b>and</b> <b>sustained</b> demand for environmental improvements. Yet, while demand is a prerequisite, it is not enough.

It is now {{recognized}} that atrial fibrillation (AF) {{is not a}} benign condition, as it {{is associated with a}} 40 % increase in mortality and a doubling of the risk of stroke. 2. The development of AF leads to mechanical, electrophysiological and cellular changes in the atria that fend to sustain AF. This process is known as atrial remodelling. 3. The three electrophysiological elements in the atria that initiate <b>and</b> <b>sustain</b> AF are: (<b>i)</b> shortening of the refractory period and an increase in dispersion; (ii) slowing of conduction velocity; and (iii) the presence of triggering foci. 4. As AF is a heterogeneous disorder, therapeutic strategies include the use of devices (pacemakers and atrial defibrillators), radiofrequency ablation (focal ablation or the creation of linear lines) and drug therapy that may reverse a remodelled atrium. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Climate {{change has}} been {{identified}} {{as one of the greatest}} challenge by all the nations, government, business and citizens of the globe. The threats of climate change on our green planet ‘Earth’ demands that renewable energy share in the total energy generation and consumption should be substantially increased as a matter of urgency. India’s energy development programme has been put under severe pressure with the ever-increasing demand supply gap. Due to predominance of fossil fuels in the generation mix, there are large negative environmental externalities caused by electricity generation. So it has become imperative to develop and promote alternative energy sources that can lead to sustainability of energy and environment system. Renewable electricity has become synonymous with CO 2 reduction. Present communication provides a brief description about such alternative <b>and</b> <b>sustained</b> energy sources, <b>i.</b> e., renewable energy resources, their potential and achievements in India. Also role as important tool for climate change mitigation...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. I agree with those proponents of bio-medical moral enhancement who claim that we face large-scale global moral problems which are currently un-recognised or un-acted upon. But I argue that the proposed bio-medical means for tackling them is misconceived. I show that both bio-medical and ‘traditional’ conceptions of moral enhancement share a misleading picture {{of the relation between}} the moral psychology of individuals and the socially structured moral problems with which they are faced. The argument unfolds in three stages. First I reflect on prominent historical cases of large-scale progressive moral change to assess the role of the agents’ moral psychology in bringing that about <b>and</b> <b>sustaining</b> it. Second, <b>I</b> identify some current cases of people recognising one or more of (what I call) the ‘new moral problems’ but not acting in accordance with that recognition. Third, I adumbrate an alternative stance to the idea of both traditional and bio-medical moral enhancement...|$|R

"The Poem was {{produced}} {{by a series of}} thoughts which filled my mind with unbounded <b>and</b> <b>sustained</b> enthusiasm. <b>I</b> felt the precariousness of my life, and I engaged in this task, resolved to leave some record of myself. Much of what the volume contains was written with the same feeling, as real, though not so prophetic, as the communications of a dying man. I never presumed indeed to consider it anything approaching to faultless; but when I consider contemporary productions of the same apparent pretensions, I own I was filled with confidence. I felt that it was in many respects a genuine picture of my own mind. I felt that the sentiments were true, not assumed. And in this have I long believed that my power consists; in sympathy and that part of the imagination which relates to sentiment and contemplation. I am formed, if for anything not in common with the herd of mankind, to apprehend minute and remote distinctions of feeling, whether relative to external nature or the living beings which surround us, and to communicate the conceptions which result from considering either the moral or the material universe as a whole. Of course, I believe these faculties, which perhaps comprehend all that is sublime in man, to exist very imperfectly in my own mind." ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Although {{octopamine}} {{has long}} been known to have major roles as both transmitter and modulator in arthropods, it has only recently been shown to be functionally important in molluscs, playing a role as a neurotransmitter in the feeding network of the snail Lymnaea stagnalis. The synaptic potentials cannot explain all the effects of octopamine-containing neurons on the feeding network, and here we test the hypothesis that octopamine is also a neuromodulator. Results The excitability of the B 1 and B 4 motoneurons in the buccal ganglia to depolarising current clamp pulses is significantly (P I A current <b>and</b> a <b>sustained</b> <b>I</b> K delayed-rectifier current, but neither was modulated by octopamine in any of these three buccal neurons. The fast inward current was eliminated in sodium – free saline and so is likely to be carried by sodium ions. 10 μM octopamine enhanced this current by 33 and 45 % in the B 1 and B 4 motoneurons respectively (P Conclusion We conclude that octopamine is also a neuromodulator in snails, changing the excitability of the buccal neurons. This is supported by the close relationship from the voltage clamp data, through the quantitative simulation, to the action potential threshold, changing the properties of neurons in a rhythmic network. The increase in inward sodium current provides an explanation for the polycyclic modulation of the feeding system by the octopamine-containing interneurons, making feeding easier to initiate and making the feeding bursts more intense. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the neural mechanisms underlying the abnormal facial pain that may develop following regeneration of the injured inferior alveolar nerve (IAN), {{the properties of the}} IAN innervated in the mental region were analyzed. Results Fluorogold (FG) injection into the mental region 14 days after IAN transection showed massive labeling of trigeminal ganglion (TG). The escape threshold to mechanical stimulation of the mental skin was significantly lower (i. e. mechanical allodynia) at 11 - 14 days after IAN transection than before surgery. The background activity, mechanically evoked responses and afterdischarges of IAN Aδ-fibers were significantly higher in IAN-transected rats than naive. The small/medium diameter TG neurons showed an increase in both tetrodotoxin (TTX) -resistant (TTX-R) and -sensitive (TTX-S) sodium currents (I Na) and decrease in total potassium current, transient current (<b>I</b> A) <b>and</b> <b>sustained</b> current (<b>I</b> K) in IAN-transected rats. The amplitude, overshoot amplitude and number of action potentials evoked by the depolarizing pulses after 1 μM TTX administration in TG neurons were significantly higher, whereas the threshold current to elicit spikes was smaller in IAN-transected rats than naive. Resting membrane potential was significantly smaller in IAN-transected rats than that of naive. Conclusions These data suggest that the increase in both TTX-S I Na and TTX-R I Na and the decrease in I A and I k in small/medium TG neurons in IAN-transected rats are involved in the activation of spike generation, resulting in hyperexcitability of Aδ-IAN fibers innervating the mental region after IAN transection. </p...|$|R
