500|$|Inspired by Archie Comics’ Afterlife with Archie, Del Col {{is quoted}} as saying, “So, then I started to think, 'Huh, I wonder what other {{characters}} are {{out there that are}} well-known that could be rebooted like that,'" [...] Del Col said. [...] "That's when I started to look around and I looked in some properties, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> 'Wait a minute. Nancy Drew. Hardy Boys. Oh, that would be really cool to do a hard-boiled noir take on them.' ” ...|$|E
500|$|Courtney Love: [...] "We {{actually}} show Anne Boleyn too. She was Henry VIII's {{wife who}} had her head chopped off. When I was little, I {{used to see}} these pictures of her with this necklace that had a B on it. I always had a fascination with ancient history, Roman especially, and early English, and I kept imagining her getting her head chopped off, for my whole life. Then, I told my friend Joe, who did the art. He always had an obsession with Marie Antoinette too. She was also decapitated. We also thought about Jayne Mansfield, just {{the idea of a}} woman having her mouth and eyes and ears taken away from her. And, hand grenades, the top comes off. You just pull out the pin and it explodes. So, if you take away someone's mouth and their eyes and their senses and their brain, they explode. I saw a grenade in my head, I saw taking out the clip, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> of a human body and what happens if you take out the clip." ...|$|E

60|$|Lord Southerton! One of {{the richest}} peers in England! I could not believe my ears. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> {{suddenly}} <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> of the time which had elapsed, and how it coincided with my injuries.|$|R
60|$|I knew wot it was. It was {{the handle}} of that umberella 'ammering on the gate. I went cold all over, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> when <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that the pot-man was most likely {{encouraging}} 'er to do it I began to boil.|$|R
500|$|Four years later, the children's father [...] "came to Stamps without warning" [...] and {{returned}} {{them to their}} mother's care in St. Louis. [...] At the age of eight, while living with her mother, Angelou was sexually abused and raped by her mother's boyfriend, a man named Freeman. She told her brother, who told {{the rest of their}} family. Freeman was found guilty but was jailed for only one day. [...] Four days after his release, he was murdered, probably by Angelou's uncles. [...] Angelou became mute for almost five years, believing, as she stated, [...] "I thought, my voice killed him; I killed that man, because I told his name. [...] <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> I would never speak again, because my voice would kill anyone..." [...] According to Marcia Ann Gillespie and her colleagues, who wrote a biography about Angelou, it was during this period of silence when Angelou developed her extraordinary memory, her love for books and literature, and her ability to listen and observe the world around her.|$|E
2500|$|At first , we {{were called}} Force. I {{think we had}} gotten that name from a UFO album, {{but there was also}} a band called Rising Force with Yngwie Malmsteen. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> 'We should move up. We should do {{something}} else.' That night, I was so nervous telling them I thought it should be Europe. They got so quiet after I told them. But as the night progressed, they started liking it more and more." ...|$|E

[...] "And the pie. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{just some}} of them yellow pears for pudding, unless you'd like {{something}} fancier." [...] Here it is, then: the challenge thrown down. Unless you'd like something fancier. So the subjugated Amazon stands on the riverbank wrapped in the fur of animals she has killed and skinned; so she drops a pear before the queen's gold slippers and says, [...] "Here is what I've brought. Unless you'd like something fancier." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{they all}} went except you <b>and</b> me. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> there was some chance of water in this direction, so I heaved you over my {{shoulder}} and we tramped it together.

6000|$|He cast {{a curious}} sidewise glance. [...] "Well, I'm not pretty to look at, <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> reckon she <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> was {{investigating}} her." ...|$|R
6000|$|The miner {{followed}} his host with mild wonder expressed on his face, {{and as the}} door closed behind them and they were secure of being overheard, he remarked, with a chuckle: [...] "You headed off old Daddy McLeod out there.

2500|$|When {{interviewed for}} Mojo {{magazine}} the band {{said the most}} amazing sight at Live Aid was to see the audience clapping to [...] "Radio Ga Ga". Brian May stated: [...] "I'd {{never seen anything like}} that in my life and it wasn't calculated either. We understood our audience and played to them but that was one of those weird accidents because of the (music) video. I remember thinking 'oh great, they've picked it up' <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> 'this is not a Queen audience'. This is a general audience who've bought tickets before they even knew we were on the bill. And they all did it. How did they know? Nobody told them to do it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1945, aged 62, Bardsley married 45-year-old Gertrude Cope, {{his wife}} {{until his death}} in 1954. [...] The last time they met, leaving the funeral of Dr. Rowley Pope, Jack Fingleton asked Bardsley his thoughts: [...] "I was just {{thinking}}," [...] said the old cricketer, [...] "what a great bloke old Doc was. [...] I was thinking of him, and then I just happened to see So-And-So across there, and I thought, Poor old So-And-So. [...] By cripes, he's looking old.

6000|$|... "Quite true, Joe; I {{wished the}} thought to work itself {{out in your}} own mind, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> it right to speak first to your father." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{remember}} {{her as well}} {{as if it were}} yesterday, at Dunripple. She was a little girl <b>then,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> her the most beautiful little girl in the world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I--I {{wanted to}} {{surprise}} you, father. <b>And</b> <b>then,</b> you see, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> {{it would be}} wiser to find out first how well I was likely {{to do at the}} examinations." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> {{heard him}} fall, and rise, and fall again, {{with a sound}} like the ripping of sacking.

6000|$|... "A {{woman for}} whom great gods might strive!" [...] I said, {{and kissed her}} there: <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> of the other five, [...] And of how charms outwear.|$|E
6000|$|... "You see, {{he had a}} kind of a {{reception}} and fireworks afterward. We didn't get away till after nine, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> I'd have a lecture when I got home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, father, I was going, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that I {{would wait}} to hear what all this is about Janter and the Moat Farm. It is best to get it over." ...|$|E

"Just {{to amuse}} myself, {{and keep the}} good people busy, I ordered them to build this City, and my Palace; {{and they did it}} all willingly <b>and</b> well. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> as the country was so green and beautiful, I would call it the Emerald City; and to make the name fit better I put green {{spectacles}} on all the people, so that everything they saw was green." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am not pulling your leg. Nothing would induce me {{to touch}} your beastly leg. The vicar {{was to have}} officiated, but when I got home I found a letter from him {{saying that he had}} {{strained}} a fetlock and must scratch his nomination. You can imagine the state I was in.

6000|$|... "After this we {{went back}} to the station, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> came home. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> from the map that we should go through Paisley; but we did not. We went over it. We went over it, higher than the tops of the chimneys.|$|R

6000|$|... "Very {{cosmopolitan}} indeed," [...] he declared. [...] "It is patronized chiefly, I believe, by {{a certain}} class of Americans {{and gentlemen of the}} sporting persuasion.

60|$|I {{paid little}} heed while I lay in this poor pass.

60|$|I remembered {{exactly what}} I had done {{on that day}} long ago.

I {{recalled}} it because I had wondered why one knocks off the tops of thistles; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> had <b>thought</b> of Tarquin; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> had recited most of Macaulay's VIRGINIA to myself, for <b>I</b> was young. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>I</b> came to a tattered edge where the very tuft had whitened with the sawdust and brick-dust from the new row of houses; and two or three green stars of dock and thistle grew spasmodically about the blinding road.|$|R
