40|$|A {{pedagogical}} {{process that}} enables {{people to make}} a claim for ‘general credit’ {{has been in place}} for the last 20 years at the University of Middlesex. General credit means that people can reflect upon their learning drawn from any area of their life experience. This is distinct from where the common form of accrediting prior and experiential learning for specific credit is claimed for specific learning that is contained in particular university modules. Academic advisers support people in making claims for experiential learning that can be at any university level from Foundation to Doctorate. Making the claim is a developmental process and usually results in the <b>achievement</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>certificate</b> of credit that can be put towards a university award. General credit has been used to provide access to higher education for people who do not have certificated learning. There are generations of people who have not had the opportunity to attend university but have lifewide learning that may meet HE level criteria. Some claimants already have highly successful careers and seek to develop themselves further whilst some do not realise the abilities they already have. All of them can garner their experience, reflect and formalise their learning in a way that brings new confidence and what some describe as inspiration and enrichment. The process of making the claim has without doubt been an uplifting experience for many people. It acts as a bridge between formal academic curricula and recognition of lifewide learning and achievement...|$|E

40|$|In Australia, the Higher Education {{sector is}} {{undergoing}} <b>a</b> period <b>of</b> change with increased focus on accountability {{and the quality}} of ‘teaching and learning’. It is in this context of change that my interest has been drawn to the study of how Universities attract academic staff across the Higher Education sector, making comparisons with methods used for research staff as against the United Kingdom (UK) model. In Australia there is no nationally accepted pre-employment requirement for academic staff to be examined by and registered with an appropriate professional teaching body or to meet some standard set of requirements. However there is anecdotal information of self-regulating arrangements for post-employment training for academic staff involved directly in teaching roles. This requirement is not standard and varies from just a few days through to the <b>achievement</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> teaching graduate <b>certificate.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result <b>of</b> the absence of established standards there is greater variation of the emphasis placed on the way each University selects academic staff for such a teaching role. The employment selection processes are generally kept private to an employer however it is general procedure to publish the Selection Criteria for advertised positions in national newspapers and on employer websites. Hence this general procedure presents an opportunity to explore the Higher Education sector during the advertisement phase of the selection process. This paper represents <b>a</b> cross-institutional review <b>of</b> pre-employment Selection Criteria by Universities in Queensland, Australia through the collection, collation and analysis of the Selection Criteria set out in nationally advertised academic positions. <b>A</b> database <b>of</b> the positions advertised from September-October 2007 was assembled to show the range of attributes and to compare positions by institution, category, tenure, and appointment. The text analysis of Selection Criteria will establish that they are a reasonable vehicle to establish a defacto self-regulating standard for the employment of academic staff in Queensland Universities though current practice indicates varying degrees of success...|$|R
