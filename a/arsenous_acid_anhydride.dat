5000|$|An organic <b>acid</b> <b>anhydride</b> is an <b>acid</b> <b>anhydride</b> that is {{an organic}} {{compound}}. An <b>acid</b> <b>anhydride</b> {{is a compound that}} has two acyl groups bonded to the same oxygen atom. A common type of organic <b>acid</b> <b>anhydride</b> is a carboxylic anhydride, where the parent acid is a carboxylic acid, the formula of the anhydride being (RC(O))2O. Symmetrical <b>acid</b> <b>anhydrides</b> of this type are named by replacing the word acid {{in the name of the}} parent carboxylic acid by the word anhydride.

40|$|The bond {{distances}} in hydrated arsenic oxyacid {{species in}} aqueous solution have been studied by EXAFS spectroscopy and large angle X-ray scattering, LAXS. These results have been compared to structures in the solid state, as found in an extensive survey of available crystal structures. Protonated oxygen atoms can be distinguished with a longer As-O distance for both arsenic(V) and arsenic(III) species in the crystalline state. However, the average As-O distance for the H nAsO 4 (3 -n) - species (0 ≤n≤ 3) remains the same. These average values are slightly shorter, ca. 0. 02 Å, than {{in aqueous solution}} due to the hydration as determined by EXAFS and LAXS. The K absorption edges for arsenic(V) and arsenic(III) species are separated by 4. 0 eV, and {{the shape of the}} absorption edges differs as well. Small but significant differences in the absorption edge features are seen between the neutral acids and the charged oxyacid species. The most important arsenic species from an environmental point of view is <b>arsenous</b> <b>acid,</b> As(OH) 3. In addition to <b>arsenous</b> <b>acid,</b> we have used orthotelluric acid, Te(OH) 6, for comparison with <b>arsenous</b> <b>acid</b> and for detailed studies of the hydration of covalently bound hydroxo groups. <b>Arsenous</b> <b>acid</b> cannot be studied with the same accuracy as orthotelluric acid, due to a relatively low solubility of As 2 O 3 (s) in neutral to acidic aqueous solution. The results from the DDIR studies support the assignment of As(OH) 3 as a weak structure maker analogous to Te(OH) 6, both being neutral weak oxyacids...|$|R
50|$|<b>Arsenous</b> <b>acid</b> (or arsenious acid) is the {{inorganic}} compound with the formula H3AsO3. It {{is known to}} occur in aqueous solutions, {{but it has not}} been isolated as a pure material, although this fact does not detract from the significance of As(OH)3.|$|R
40|$|A novel method, {{incomplete}} suppressed conductimetric detection, {{has been}} developed for the determination of anions of very weak acids. The principle of the method was discussed. Theoretical considerations involved the choice of background conductance {{and its effect on}} linearity and detection limits. Results showed that for both <b>arsenous</b> <b>acid</b> and boric acid, the sensitivity was improved greatly with low background conductance, compared with the suppressed conductimetric method. With 250 mg/l boric acid, there were 261 - and 1002 -fold increases in peak height and peak area, respectively. Within the linear range of the detection, quantified by peak areas, the linear correlation coefficients were 0. 9991 and 0. 9985 for <b>arsenous</b> <b>acid</b> and boric acid, respectively.

50|$|<b>Acid</b> <b>anhydride</b> {{hydrolase}}s are a {{class of}} hydrolase enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of an <b>acid</b> <b>anhydride</b> bond. They are classified under EC number 3.6. One well known member of this class is GTPase.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{examine the}} {{relation}} between exposure to <b>acid</b> <b>anhydrides</b> {{and the risk of}} developing immediate skin prick test responses to <b>acid</b> <b>anhydride</b> human serum albumin (AA-HSA) conjugates or work related respiratory symptoms; to assess whether these relations are modified by atopy or smoking. METHODS: A cohort of 506 workers exposed to phthalic (PA), maleic (MA), and trimellitic anhydride (TMA) was defined. Workers completed questionnaires relating to employment history, respiratory symptoms, and smoking habits. Skin prick tests were done with AA-HSA conjugates and common inhalant allergens. Exposure to <b>acid</b> <b>anhydrides</b> was measured {{at the time of the}} survey and a retrospective exposure assessment was done. RESULTS: Information was obtained from 401 (79 %) workers. Thirty four (8. 8 %) had new work related respiratory symptoms that occurred for the first time while working with <b>acid</b> <b>anhydrides</b> and 12 (3. 2 %) were sensitised, with an immediate skin prick test reaction to AA-HSA conjugates. Sensitisation to <b>acid</b> <b>anhydrides</b> was associated with work related respiratory symptoms and with smoking at the time of exposure to <b>acid</b> <b>anhydride.</b> When all subjects were included and all three <b>acid</b> <b>anhydrides</b> were taken into account there was no consistent evidence for an exposure-response relation, but with the analysis restricted to a factory where only TMA was in use there was an increased prevalence of sensitisation to <b>acid</b> <b>anhydrides</b> and work related respiratory symptoms with increasing full shift exposure. This relation was apparent within the current occupational exposure standard of 40 micrograms. m- 3 and was not modified significantly by smoking or atopy. CONCLUSIONS: Intensity of exposure and cigarette smoking may be risk factors for sensitisation to <b>acid</b> <b>anhydrides.</b> Exposure is also a risk factor for respiratory symptoms. As there was evidence for sensitisation to TMA at full shift exposures within the occupational exposure standard this standard should be reviewed...|$|R
