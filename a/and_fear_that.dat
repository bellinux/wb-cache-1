5|$|Although fantasy {{comes from}} an imaginative realm, Martin sees an honest {{necessity}} to reflect the real world where people die sometimes ugly deaths, even beloved people. Main characters are killed off so that the reader will not expect the supposed hero to survive, and instead will feel the same tension <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> the characters might. The novels also reflect the substantial death rates in war. The deaths of supernumerary extras or orcs have no major effect on readers, whereas a friend's death has much more emotional impact. Martin prefers a hero's sacrifice to say something profound about human nature.|$|E
5|$|Married couple Jared and Jerusha Hess were co-writers and {{directors}} of the 2004 film Napoleon Dynamite, and had wanted to do an animated version since the film's release. They thought animation {{was the best way}} to continue the world of Napoleon Dynamite as the original actors had grown too old to play teenage characters. Following the film's success, Fox Searchlight Pictures wanted a sequel, but the Hesses delayed due to commitments to other projects <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> audiences would tire of the Napoleon Dynamite characters.|$|E
5|$|St. Anger was {{released}} on June 5, 2003. It was originally scheduled for June 10, but due to Metallica's previous battle with Napster, <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> it would be released illegally onto peer-to-peer file sharing networks, the band pushed the release date ahead by five days. A special edition of the album {{was released}} with a bonus DVD, featuring live, in-the-studio rehearsals {{of all of the}} St. Anger tracks. First week sales of the album were 417,000 copies, and it debuted at number 1 on the U.S. Billboard 200, as well as in 30 other countries around the world. In 2004, Metallica won the award for Best Metal Performance, for the title track.|$|E

5|$|The Katamari series, {{which has}} long been PlayStation 2 {{exclusive}}s, found {{one of the more}} recent installments, Beautiful Katamari, exclusive to Xbox 360. These releases fueled rumors <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> Final Fantasy XIII and Tekken 6, two highly anticipated exclusive PlayStation 3 games at the time, would also be available for Xbox 360, the PlayStation 3's primary competitor and at E3 2008, it was announced that Final Fantasy XIII would be simultaneously released on the Xbox 360 in Europe and North America; later on October 8, 2008, it was announced that Tekken 6 would also be releasing on the Xbox 360. After the multiplatform releases of these games, the fifth installment of the Metal Gear series, , has also been announced for the Xbox 360; L.A. Noire, which was announced as an exclusive since the beginning of its development, has also been released for the Xbox 360; Dark Souls, the spiritual successor to Demon's Souls, has also been released on Xbox 360; the Persona series, which {{has a long history of}} being PlayStation exclusive, found the seventh generation installment, Persona 4 Arena multiplatform; however, Metal Gear Solid 4, Yakuza 3, Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection ONLINE, and Disgaea 3: Absence of Justice still remain PlayStation 3 exclusives. Sony has blamed lower-than-expected sales, loss of exclusive titles in the PlayStation 3 software library, its higher price, and stock shortages.|$|E
5|$|Throughout this, Idelba {{has been}} {{secretly}} working on atomic physics {{and she and}} her fellow researchers have made some disturbing discoveries. They conclude that {{it would be possible to}} make a devastating weapon from nuclear chain reactions <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> the military will try to create such bombs and restart the war. In order to prevent this, Idelba tries desperately to hide all evidence about her research and contacts concerned scientists in other parts of the world. The government learns of her work however and raids the Zawiyya to get hold of her papers, but Budur manages to hide them. Idelba eventually dies of radiation poisoning from the materials she was working with and leaves all her research to Budur, who keeps her secret and eventually manages to organize an international conference of scientists to discuss the nuclear issue. The meeting is held in Isfahan in Iran (one of the few Islamic nations which has prospered since the war) and scientists from all over the world attend. They agree that none of them will work on the creation of nuclear weapons for their respective countries, no matter what pressure they are put under by their governments and also start a new international scientific movement to break down barriers between cultures in a spirit of reconciliation and friendship (they even create a new scientific calendar to be used by the whole world, with its year zero set from the time of the conference).|$|E

25|$|Mexican state social {{investment}} depends to a {{great extent}} on the profits from oil exports controlled by Pemex as a state monopoly. The leftist political movement National Regeneration Movement has expressed concern that Pemex will be systematically excluded as a commercial competitor by the government. They believe that Pemex's infrastructural decline was due to a deliberate strategy of self-sabotage by the government through lack of reinvestment, <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> the Mexican oil rent may be taken over by private corporations. The leftist opposition is concerned that energy reform may be a concealed maneuver for privatization. They also worry that laws derived from the constitutional reforms are not explicit in demonstrating that energy reform will avoid having the oil rent be controlled by the private sector. There are questions as to how the Mexican system of public health, education and subsidized transportation (not to mention the newly created presidential fund for retirement and umemployment) would be funded if there is privatization of the oil rent.|$|E
25|$|By 1961 a {{final plan}} for the new system {{was sent to the}} boards of {{supervisors}} of each of the five counties. The system's initial plans were for three branches traversing the San Francisco Bay and connecting Concord in the east, Richmond in the northeast, Fremont in the southeast; a crossing of the Golden Gate connecting San Francisco to Novato in the northwest; and a final branch running along the Peninsula from Palo Alto. However, in April 1962 San Mateo County opted out, citing high costs, existing service provided by Southern Pacific commuter trains, and concerns over shoppers leaving their county for stores in San Francisco. This left Daly City (still in San Mateo County, but only a few feet across the county line) as the southwest terminus. Marin County followed soon thereafter in May, being forced out of the BART district due to engineering objections from {{the board of directors of}} the Golden Gate Bridge <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> Marin voters would not approve the bonds, which had to win more than 60% approval. The withdrawal also resulted in the cancellation of the Geary Subway section of the system. The BART plans were finally approved by the voters of the three remaining participating counties in November 1962.|$|E
