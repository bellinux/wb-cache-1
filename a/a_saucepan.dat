She complies and leaves {{her role as a}} nun behind. Teresa has a breakdown and throws <b>a</b> <b>saucepan</b> of boiling water at Carmella, who is left with severe facial scarring and becomes increasingly secluded. She is convinced by Will Griggs (Christian Clark) to have plastic surgery to lessen the scarring. Ned tells Carmella that he loves her, but Carmella has fallen in love with Will. Soon thereafter, Will leaves the country without notice. His younger brother Oliver Barnes (David Hoflin) arrives, and explains that Will had a double identity. Carmella has short-lived relationships with Oliver and teenager Ringo Brown (Sam Clark). She becomes addicted to prescription drugs, and later discovers that she is pregnant with Oliver's baby, and may have harmed the baby through her addiction.|$|E
5|$|Selling and {{purchasing}} fresh false morels {{is legal}} in Finland, {{where it is}} highly regarded. However, the mushrooms are {{required by law to}} be accompanied with a warning that they are poisonous and legally prescribed preparation instructions. False morels are also sold prepared and canned, in which case they are ready to be used. Official figures from the Finnish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry report a total amount of false morels sold in Finland of 21.9tonnes in 2006 and 32.7tonnes, noted as being above average, in 2007. In 2002, the Finnish Food Safety Authority estimated annual consumption of false morels to be hundreds of tonnes in plentiful years. In Finnish cuisine, false morels may be cooked in an omelette, or gently sautéed in butter in <b>a</b> <b>saucepan,</b> flour and milk added to make a bechamel sauce, or pie filling. Alternatively, more fluid can be added for a false morel soup. Typical condiments added for flavour include parsley, chives, dill and black pepper.|$|E
25|$|Whale {{meat and}} blubber are Faroese delicacies. Well into the 20th century, meat and blubber {{from the pilot}} whale was used to feed people {{for long periods of}} time. Everybody got a share, as is the custom to this day. The meat and blubber can be stored and {{prepared}} in a variety of ways, in Faroese it is called Tvøst og spik. When fresh, the meat is boiled or served as steaks. A pilot whale steak is called in Faroese: grindabúffur. Whale meat with blubber and potatoes in their skins are put into <b>a</b> <b>saucepan</b> with salt and then boiled for an hour or so. Slivers of the blubber are also a popular accompaniment to dried fish.|$|E

60|$|There was {{but little}} furniture: {{two or three}} chairs, a table which was {{littered}} with papers, and a corner-cupboard--the open doors of which revealed a miscellaneous collection--bundles of papers, <b>a</b> tin <b>saucepan,</b> <b>a</b> piece of cold sausage, {{and a couple of}} pistols. The fumes of stale tobacco-smoke hovered in the air, and mingled most unpleasantly with those of the lamp above, and of the mildew that penetrated through the walls just below the roof.|$|R

500|$|Summed up by James Dinh of MTV News, [...] " [...] 'Party' takes viewers {{back to an}} old-school {{backyard}} celebration full {{of colorful}} bikinis, freestyle dancing and a few familiar faces. Throughout the video, [...] lets loose, playing a sort of party host. If she is not lounging in beach chairs, she is dancing among her friends or mowing the lawn." [...] The clip is centered around a trailer park hood and a subsequent soiree. It starts with a dog barking behind a fencing, followed by multiple intercut scenery, which includes two men engaged in a conversation, a woman leaning against a car, a little girl riding a bicycle and <b>a</b> <b>saucepan</b> caught in fire. Then, Beyoncé appears, dressed in bright colored as well as flashy garments, sporting neon-colored oval shaped nails, and bright-colored lipstick. She is cooking in a skillet while one of her neighbors drinks from a hose. As she sings, looking into the camera, she highlights and plays with her hair. The action shifts from the double wide to a sunny summer backyard barbecue, where Beyoncé and her friends dance as Solange is deejaying. This is followed by scenes of Beyoncé, floating in an above ground pool while singing and entertaining her guests. She is wearing a pink one-piece swimsuit, dropping earrings and her hair looks crimped. Other girls bask {{in the sun and}} splash in the pool as Solange works the turntables.|$|E
2500|$|In 1982 Springfield met an American actress Teda Bracci at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting; {{the pair}} moved in {{together}} in April 1983, and seven months later, they exchanged vows {{at a wedding}} ceremony which was not legally recognised under California law. The pair had a [...] "tempestuous" [...] relationship which led to an altercation with both Springfield and Bracci hospitalised; Springfield had been smashed in the mouth by Bracci wielding <b>a</b> <b>saucepan</b> and had teeth knocked out, requiring plastic surgery. The pair had separated within two years.|$|E
2500|$|Many of the characters, props, {{and ideas}} in the novel were drawn from Baum's experiences. As a child, Baum {{frequently}} had nightmares of a scarecrow pursuing him across a field. Moments before the scarecrow's [...] "ragged hay fingers" [...] nearly gripped his neck, it would fall apart before his eyes. Decades later, as an adult, Baum integrated his tormentor into the novel as the Scarecrow. According to his son Harry, the Tin Woodman was born from Baum's attraction to window displays. He wished to make something captivating for the window displays, so he used an eclectic assortment of scraps to craft a striking figure. From a washboiler he made a body, from bolted stovepipes he made arms and legs, and {{from the bottom of}} <b>a</b> <b>saucepan</b> he made a face. Baum then placed a funnel hat on the figure, which ultimately became the Tin Woodman. John D. Rockefeller was the nemesis of Baum's father, an oil baron who declined to purchase Standard Oil shares in exchange for selling his own oil refinery. Baum scholar Evan I. Schwartz posited that Rockefeller inspired one of the Wizard's numerous faces. In one scene in the novel, the Wizard is seen as a [...] "tyrannical, hairless head". When Rockefeller was 54 years old, the medical condition alopecia caused him to lose every strand of hair on his head, making people fearful of speaking to him.|$|E
5000|$|After {{soaking the}} ribs are steamed {{over a little}} water in <b>a</b> large <b>saucepan.</b> <b>A</b> layer of twigs from the birch tree may {{be placed in the}} bottom of the <b>saucepan</b> instead of <b>a</b> metal steamer. The name pinnekjøtt (literally: stick meat) is disputed. It may refer to the birch twigs of the cooking process, but the word 'pinne' is in dialectal Norwegian also used in {{reference}} to single ribs - akin to [...] "rib sticks", a dialectal expression in English.|$|R

60|$|Fill {{the little}} bag {{we call the}} kitchenino. Methylated spirit, <b>a</b> small {{aluminium}} <b>saucepan,</b> <b>a</b> spirit-lamp, two spoons, two forks, a knife, two aluminium plates, salt, sugar, tea--what else? The thermos flask, the various sandwiches, four apples, and a little tin of butter. So much for the kitchenino, for myself and the queen bee. Then my knapsack and the q-b's handbag.|$|R
60|$|The mother entered, {{bringing}} <b>a</b> <b>saucepan</b> {{from which}} she ladled soup into three plates.|$|E

60|$|He {{turned slowly}} {{and went down}} the road meditating. He heard the cottage door re-open, and turning his head, saw through {{intervening}} scarlet runners Mrs Gustick with <b>a</b> steaming <b>saucepan</b> full of boiling cabbage water in her hand.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Brunt was {{crouching}} at {{the small}} stove, putting a little rice pudding into the oven. He rose then, and attentively poked in <b>a</b> small <b>saucepan</b> on the hob with a fork. Then he replaced the saucepan lid.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Wilks muttered that he didn't know, and lay crossly {{regarding}} his attentive neighbour as she {{knelt down and}} daintily lit the fire. This task finished, she proceeded to make the room tidy, and then set about making beef-tea in <b>a</b> little <b>saucepan.</b>|$|R

60|$|I {{found that}} the street was not as {{desirable}} a one as I could have wished it to be, {{for the sake of}} Traddles. The inhabitants appeared to have a propensity to throw any little trifles they were not in want of, into the road: which not only made it rank and sloppy, but untidy too, on account of the cabbage-leaves. The refuse was not wholly vegetable either, for I myself saw a shoe, <b>a</b> doubled-up <b>saucepan,</b> <b>a</b> black bonnet, and an umbrella, in various stages of decomposition, as I was looking out for the number I wanted.|$|R
60|$|There {{was a low}} brick fireplace, full of fire, an old blue Turkish rug, {{the little}} oak table with the lamp and the white-and-blue cloth and the dessert, and Gudrun making coffee in an odd brass coffee-maker, and Winifred {{scalding}} a little milk in <b>a</b> tiny <b>saucepan.</b>|$|R
60|$|The youth strolled off, gasping, with an envious {{glance at}} the cook, who, {{standing}} just inside the galley, cheerfully flaunted <b>a</b> <b>saucepan</b> he was cleaning, as though defying the mate to find him any work to do.|$|E

50|$|For {{volumetric}} objects (e.g. pillow, blanket, sleeping bag, rug), boiling in <b>a</b> large <b>saucepan</b> {{for more}} than 10 minutes represents a reliable method.

6000|$|... "It's the sweetest, dearest {{kitchen in}} the world, and I'd rather study with it than do {{anything}} else. Can't I learn pies, and cake, and macaroni, and everything?"

50|$|In {{order to}} inspect the food, the {{pressure}} cooker needs to be opened, which halts the cooking process. With <b>a</b> conventional <b>saucepan,</b> {{this can be done}} {{in a matter of seconds}} by visually inspecting the food. As a result, accurate timing is essential for the recipe e.g. with an audible timer.|$|R
60|$|Another {{good way}} we {{discovered}} of irritating the aristocratic type of steam launch, was to mistake {{them for a}} beanfeast, and {{ask them if they}} were Messrs. Cubit’s lot or the Bermondsey Good Templars, and could they lend us <b>a</b> <b>saucepan.</b>|$|E
60|$|He seized <b>a</b> <b>saucepan</b> {{that stood}} handy, and hurled it at her. Beauty was {{equal to the}} emergency; she leaped up, allowed the pan to pass under her, fled shrieking through the window, and took refuge {{on the top of}} the house.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{there came}} a wild shout from the Canadian who was doing the cooking. With <b>a</b> <b>saucepan</b> {{he pointed to the}} dogs and sleds. All of the others gazed in that {{direction}} and Sam and Dick set up a cry of alarm.|$|E
60|$|The men who officiated as cooks--and who, by agreement, {{had been}} {{released}} from all night duty in consideration of their regularly undertaking that occupation--now brought in <b>a</b> large <b>saucepan</b> full of soup; and each man went up with his canteen, and received his portion, returning to his bed upon the straw to eat it.|$|R
