5|$|I. orientalis, {{described}} by A. K. Rozhdestvensky in 1952, {{was based on}} poor material, but a skull with a distinctive arched snout that {{had been assigned to}} it was renamed Altirhinus kurzanovi in 1998. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I.</b> orientalis was considered to be a nomen dubium because it cannot be compared to I. bernissartensis.|$|E
5|$|I {{read this}} book, and I was totally stunned. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> was pretty upset with myself that I didn't know this book. I live in Amsterdam where Anne Frank is a {{national}} hero, and for me this book read like Anne Frank's diary but written 97 years before– a firsthand account of slavery. I basically made it my passion to make this book into a film.|$|E

25|$|I see and {{understand}} both the symbolic {{as well as}} the substantive elements of my life. Sometimes I visualise it as a journey of an individual from a remote village on the sidelines of society to the hub of social standing. But <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> also realise that my life encapsulates the ability of the democratic system to accommodate and empower marginalised sections of society.|$|E
25|$|In a {{subsequent}} article for The New York Review of Books, Soros emphasized thatI do not {{subscribe to the}} myths propagated by enemies of Israel and I am not blaming Jews for anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism predates the birth of Israel. Neither Israel's policies nor the critics of those policies should {{be held responsible for}} anti-Semitism. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> do believe that attitudes toward Israel are influenced by Israel's policies, and attitudes toward the Jewish community are influenced by the pro-Israel lobby's success in suppressing divergent views.|$|E
25|$|The {{desirability}} of hiring directors over 60 is fairly diminished in this marketplace. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> hadn't had a good-sized hit {{in quite a}} while. And, frankly, I went {{through a couple of}} experiences that left me pretty disgusted with it all, and I was thinking the time had passed. I was just sitting at home reading magazines and looking out the window — a couple of projects I had had just fallen apart — when I got a call from Sly, who had sent me a script.|$|E

25|$|In {{the whole}} of the ten years I have been working on radio and television, I have been working to a {{majority}} of women. I think women prefer men to be well-mannered, so I always try to watch my manners. They like men to be well dressed, so I do my best to observe this. Others bring to my notice the fact that I sometimes make grammatical errors in my speech; so, because of this, I try to watch my grammar – but <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> bear in mind that it's more profitable for me to be entertaining than to be perfect in my use of English.|$|E
25|$|I {{think in}} casual {{conversation}} I {{would have told}} anybody I wanted to direct. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> knew Hollywood was a closed off place... It was much harder to get in. To be an older director was a very positive thing. It meant you had survived, knew your way, could make things and make them meet your economic responsibilities. It was always paramount in studio minds, especially in those days... If I was going to direct I was going to write my way in. No TV, no play, I was simply somebody who said I have a sensibility, I think I can do this, based on nothing other than my scripts basically.|$|E
25|$|We {{all knew}} {{in our hearts}} that Michael was disappointing. We felt that we had {{compensated}} adequately in making a fun, exciting, stylized world. You know, I was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where I thought it was going to do well. And I thought that we had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me that I was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E

50|$|The {{numbering}} scheme changed somewhat starting with ESR 24.0.0 series. The first {{minor version number}} increments on regularly scheduled six-week release cycle, and the second minor version number increments when unscheduled off-cycle releases are necessary.

McCoy said that if he were rated a first- or second-round draft pick, he might change his mind about staying. McCoy said, [...] "But <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> want to play four years here. Not very many people {{have had the opportunity to}} do that.

500|$|Five {{months after}} the Olympic session, with the Beatles having now broken up, [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] was one of 30 or more tracks that Harrison {{recorded}} for his All Things Must Pass triple album. It was a song he had been reluctant to record, for fear of committing himself publicly to such an overt religious message. [...] "I was sticking my neck out on the chopping block because now I would have {{to live up to}} something," [...] Harrison explained in I Me Mine, [...] "but <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> thought 'Nobody's saying it; I wish somebody else was doing it.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In September 2015, Tancharoen {{stated the}} overall {{theme for the}} season {{explored}} with each character was them [...] "trying {{to get back in}} touch with their humanity in a world where Inhumans are popping up," [...] with Whedon adding that the nature of couples–some having broken up in previous episodes, some getting back together, and potential for new ones–would be explored. Later that month, Bell talked about some of the new character pairings in the season, saying [...] "Putting Mack and Daisy together; putting Hunter and May together; putting Bobbi and Fitz together—suddenly you have all these different dynamics, all these different stories that you didn't have before." [...] Tancharoen later highlighted the number of characters in the season compared to previous, stating that [...] "There's more scale and scope, but <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> think we're diving into each character's internal struggle a little bit more." ...|$|E

500|$|Tabloid {{criticism}} of Islam4UK and Choudary since {{news of the}} proposed march first became public has, generally, been vitriolic, calling him a [...] "hate preacher". In January 2010, appearing on the BBC's The Daily Politics, he was asked by its presenter, Andrew Neil, for his opinions on the banning of Islam4UK, before being asked to comment on his financial status, claiming that it was [...] "relevant to our viewers". [...] Choudary told Neil that his finances were a personal matter, {{and that he was}} [...] "doing something, and I don't want to discuss that with you. [...] I'm not on Jobseeker's allowance, but <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> have family allowance, I have very firmly held views which I'm propagating at the same time." [...] Responding to the media's {{criticism of}} him, Choudary said [...] "I do believe that people have been whipped up into an anti-Islam anti-Muslim frenzy." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Battle of the Bastards" [...] {{was also}} the last episode for {{recurring}} character Rickon Stark (Art Parkinson), who had appeared since the series premiere episode [...] "Winter Is Coming". In an IGN interview, Parkinson {{said that he was}} tipped off about his character's death: [...] "Whenever I was told that I was coming back for Season 6, before they sent me through the scripts and stuff, they sent me through a ring just to say, 'Listen, so that you don't get a shock whenever you read the scripts, just know that you die this season. He continued, [...] "Whenever I came back, I was excited to come back, and the scenes all seemed pretty amazing. I was so happy to re-embrace the character." [...] According to Parkinson, he was sorry that Rickon would die but his manner of death was a compensation: [...] "It was a cool death, and it was {{always going to be a}} good death, so <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> was pretty happy." ...|$|E
500|$|Wolfgang's {{original}} intention {{with the}} album {{was to create a}} collection of previously released b-sides along with three reworked demos, with Eddie saying: [...] "It would [...] a record of our more hardcore songs and none of the pop stuff. That was the initial plan, but the deeper we dug, the more we found. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> was writing new songs. Dave got very excited about that. We all did. We ended up recording demos for 35 songs." [...] After deliberating over whether to self-produce the album or choose a producer from a list that included Rick Rubin and Pat Leonard, Roth suggested John Shanks. Shanks liked the first three songs, and agreed to produce the album, working alongside Wolfgang to pick the demos that would be developed into the album's tracks. While all of Van Halen's albums since 1984 had been produced inside 5150, Roth persuaded the band to work at Henson Recording Studios—where he had been recording for over a decade.|$|E
