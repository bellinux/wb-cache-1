We address the scenario where an arbitrary number of <b>auxiliary</b> <b>sources</b> (a. k. a. helpers) are supposed to help decode a single primary source errorless. The rate-distortion analysis of such a system is the so-called many-help-one problem. We focus on the {{case in which the}} <b>auxiliary</b> <b>sources</b> are conditionally independent, given the primary source. We provide an inner and an outer bound of the rate-distortion region for what we call the strong many-help-one problem, where the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>sources</b> must be also recovered under certain distortion constraints. Furthermore, based on known results from the CEO problem we provide the admissible rate region for what we call the weak many-help-one problem, where the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>sources</b> {{do not need to be}} recovered serving merely as side information to help recover the primary source. Both scenarios find important application to emerging cooperative techniques in which a direct-link communication is assisted by multiple lossy relaying-link transmissions.

A connection between shooting skills and survival among rural American men was in many cases a necessity and a 'rite of passage' for those entering manhood. Today, hunting survives as a central sentimental component of a gun culture as a way to control animal populations across the country, regardless of modern trends away from subsistence hunting and rural living. The militia/frontiersman spirit derives from an early American dependence on arms to protect themselves from foreign armies and hostile Native Americans. Survival depended upon everyone being capable of using a weapon. Prior to the American Revolution there was neither budget nor manpower nor government desire to maintain a full-time army. Therefore, the armed citizen-soldier carried the responsibility. Service in militia, including providing one's own ammunition and weapons, was mandatory for all men. Yet, as early as the 1790s, the mandatory universal militia duty evolved gradually to voluntary militia units and a reliance on a regular army. Throughout the 19th century the institution of the organized civilian militia began to decline. The unorganized civilian militia, however, still remains even in current U.S. law, consisting of essentially everyone from age 17 to 45, while also including former military officers up to age 64, as codified in [...] Closely related to the militia tradition is the frontier tradition, with the need for self-protection pursuant to westward expansion and the extension of the American frontier.
