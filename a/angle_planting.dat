A field trial was conducted with Gliricidia sepium cuttings to investigate the effect if three stock lengths (20, 30 and 40 cm), two stock diameters (1. 5 - 2. 5) and (3. 0 - 3. 5 cm) and three <b>planting</b> <b>angles</b> (30 °, 60 ° and 90 °) in a factorial experiment. There were high significant differences (p< 0. 05) in all the growth parameters of the stock diameters and stock lengths used. The highest dry matter yield of 3. 83, 4. 61 and 4. 65 t ha - 1 were produced by stock length 20, 30 and 40 cm, respectively. The highest <b>planting</b> <b>angle</b> of 90 ° produced the tallest shoot height and biggest basal diameter, while the least <b>planting</b> <b>angle</b> of 30 ° produced the least shoot height and basal diameter, respectively. The interactions between the smaller stock diameter and the least <b>planting</b> <b>angle</b> (30 °) produced the least values of growth parameters.

In a first step five pre-selected laser sensors were tested. Based on these results a triangulation laser sensor was chosen and modified. The modified sensor was tested in terms of the accuracy for distance measurements depending on the inclination <b>angle</b> of the <b>plant</b> surface and the rate of failure measurements depending on illumination conditions and measuring distance. Under defined lab condition the mean distance standard error was 2. 8 mm. The inclination <b>angle</b> of the <b>plant</b> surfaces did not reduce the measuring accuracy.

In Arabidopsis, EMBRYONIC FLOWER 1 (EMF 1), a plant-specific protein, participated in H 3 K 27 me 3 -mediated silencing of target genes by acting downstream of EMF 2 and likely interacted with both PRC 1 RING-finger proteins and PRC 2 component MULTICOPY SUPRESSOR OFIRA 1 (MSI 1) (Aubert et al. 2001; Calonje et al. 2008). In rice, OsEMF 1 {{plays an important}} role in palea development through maintaining H 3 K 27 me 3 -mediated epigenetic repression on OsMADS 58 (Zheng et al. 2015; Yan et al. 2015). To confirm whether mutation of DS 1 was responsible for the ds 1 phenotype, a CDS fragment of 3174  bp containing the entire DS 1 coding sequence and the DS 1 promoter were cloned into the pCUbi 1390 binary vector, and the complementation construct was then transformed into the ds 1 mutant. All 8 independent DS 1 -complementation lines rescued normal leaf <b>angle</b> and <b>plant</b> height of ds 1 plants (Fig. 4 c). These genetic evidence and transformation results confirmed that DS 1 was a newly identified OsEMF 1 allele, which influenced leaf <b>angle</b> and <b>plant</b> height. Homology analysis found that amino acid sequence of DS 1 had 37 % similarity and 20 % homology to Arabidopsis thaliana EMF 1 (AtEMF 1) (Additional file 1 : Figure S 2).|$|R
40|$|Soil erosion {{is one of}} {{the most}} severe land {{degradation}} processes in the Mediterranean region. Although badlands occupy a relatively small fraction of the Mediterranean area, their erosion rates are very high. Many studies have investigated to what extent vegetation controls soil erosion rates. This study, however, deals with the impact of erosion on vegetation establishment. In semi-arid badlands of the Mediterranean, soil water availability constitutes the main limiting factor for vegetation development. As a consequence, south-facing slopes are typically less vegetated due to a very large water stress. However, these findings do not necessarily apply to humid badlands. The main objective of this paper is to determine the topographic thresholds for plant colonization in relation to slope aspect and to assess the spatial patterns of vegetation cover and species richness. We surveyed 179 plots on highly eroded badland slopes in the Central Pyrenees. We defined four aspect classes subdivided into slope angle classes. Colonization success was expressed in terms of vegetation cover and species richness. Slope <b>angle</b> thresholds for <b>plant</b> colonization were identified for each slope aspect class by means of binary logistic regressions. The results show that a critical slope angle exists below which plants colonize the badland slopes. Below this critical slope <b>angle,</b> <b>plant</b> cover and species richness increase with a decreasing slope angle. The largest critical slope angles in humid badlands are observed on south-facing slopes, which contrasts with the results obtained in semi-arid badlands. North-facing slopes however are characterized by a reduced overall vegetation cover and species richness, and lower topographic threshold values. The possible underlying processes responsible for this slope-aspect discrepancy in vegetation characteristics are discussed in terms of environmental variables that control regolith development, weathering and erosion processes. Moreover, possible restoration strategies through the use of vegetation in highly degraded environments are highlighted. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Sixteen trials by an elite male high jumper were recorded in a single training session. Direct intervention was used to induce a change in technique so that a greater range in approach speed was obtained than was observed in competition.

40|$|The {{stabilization}} of natural or artificial slopes {{of land and}} shores of water courses is possible with the application of some techniques, proposed by natural engineers and soil bioengineers, which use vegetation alone or in combination with inert materials. For this reason, the vegetation to be employed needs to meet some requirements related to ecological, phytosociological and reproduction aspects. Techniques of natural engineering use plants in different positions {{in relation to the}} horizontal line. Thus, this study aims to evaluate the effects of different <b>planting</b> <b>angles</b> of cuttings of Phyllanthus sellowianus (Klotzsch) Müll. Arg. on slope stabilization. With these results the most appropriate form of planting this species can be proposed, ie, in which biotechnical practices it can be best used. The experiment was carried out at the Forest Nursery, at the Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM), Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul. The study was done from August to November of 2007. Treatments consisted of planting cuttings of Phyllanthus sellowianus (Klotzsch) Müll. Arg. at three different angles (10 °, 30 ° and 90 °). Cuttings were 30 cm long (± 1 cm of variation), with an average diameter of 1. 9 cm, and were collected in the central region of the state of RS. Two-thirds of their base were inserted into inert substrate (sand). The experimental design was completely randomized, with 30 repetitions (cuttings) for each treatment. After 90 days, the following features were analyzed: cutting survival, number, length and diameter of shoots and primary roots besides the dry mass of roots and shoots. The species had high values of survival, with a tendency for very positive results for stem cuttings <b>planted</b> at <b>angles</b> of 10 ° and 90 °. <b>Planting</b> at an <b>angle</b> of 90 º also provided the highest values of the sum of the length and dry mass of shoots, while the diameter and number of shoots showed {{no significant differences between the}} <b>angles</b> of <b>planting.</b> The number, the sum of the length and dry mass of roots were significantly higher in cuttings planted at a 90 ° angle.

40|$|The {{understanding}} of gene movement in plant species {{is critical to}} the management of both plant and animal species reliant on that plant. Pollen is the mechanism by which plants pass their genetic material {{from one generation to the}} next. Pollen dispersal studies have focused primarily on purely random diffusion processes, while this may be a good assumption for species pollinated mainly by abiotic means, such as wind, it is most likely an over simplification for species that are pollinated by biotic means, such as insects [3]. Correlated random walk (CRW) models are a model of animal movement [10] and have been successfully used to explore the movement of animals in varying ecological contexts [1]. An agent-based model (ABM) is developed to describe pollen movement via insects as a correlated random walk (CRW).

40|$|Genotypic {{variability}} in root system architecture {{has been associated}} with root angle of seedlings and water extraction patterns of mature plants in a range of crops. The potential inclusion of root angle as a selection criterion in a sorghum breeding program requires (1) availability of an efficient screening method, (2) presence of genotypic variation with high heritability, and (3) an association with water extraction pattern. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the feasibility for inclusion of nodal root angle as a selection criterion in sorghum breeding programs. A high-throughput phenotypic screen for nodal root angle in young sorghum plants has recently been developed and has been used successfully to identify significant variation in nodal root angle across a diverse range of inbred lines and a mapping population. In both cases, heritabilities for nodal root angle were high. No association between nodal root <b>angle</b> and <b>plant</b> size was detected. This implies that parental inbred lines could potentially be used to asses nodal root angle of their hybrids, although such predictability is compromised by significant interactions. To study effects of nodal root angle on water extraction patterns of mature plants, four inbred lines with contrasting nodal root angle at seedling stage were grown until at least anthesis in large rhizotrons. A consistent trend was observed that nodal root angle may affect the spatial distribution of root mass of mature plants and hence their ability to extract soil water, although genotypic differences were not significant. The potential implications of this for specific adaptation to drought stress are discussed. Results suggest that nodal root <b>angle</b> of young <b>plants</b> can be a useful selection criterion for specific drought adaptation, and could potentially be used in molecular breeding programs if QTLs for root angle can be identified.

During the first 4 – 5  h of the daytime period, the temperature of both control and Acadian®-treated plants significantly decreased (i.e., the leaf-air temperature increased to 4.5 – 5.0  °C), probably due to increased stomatal conductance. It is interesting, that the leaf <b>angle</b> of Acadian®-treated <b>plants</b> demonstrated a short-term increase, as compared to a gradual drop of turgor pressure as observed in the control (Fig.  3 b).

40|$|A {{new method}} has been {{developed}} for measuring directional thermal emissivity {{as a function of}} view <b>angle</b> for <b>plant</b> canopies and soils using two infrared thermometers each sensitive to a different wavelength band. By calibrating the two infrared thermometers to 0. 1 C consistency, canopy directional emissivity can be estimated with typical errors less than 0. 005 in the 8 [...] 14 um wavelength band, depending on clarity of the sky and corrections for CO{sub 2 } absorption by the atmosphere. A theoretical justification for the method is developed along with an error analysis. Laboratory measurements were used to develop corrections for CO{sub 2 }, absorption and a field calibration method is used to obtain the necessary 0. 1 C consistency for relatively low cost infrared thermometers. The emissivity of alfalfa (LAI= 2. 5) and corn (LAI= 3. 2) was near 0. 995 and independent of view angle. Individual corn leaves had an emissivity of 0. 97. A wheat (LAI= 3. 0) canopy had an emissivity of 0. 985 at nadir and 0. 975 at 75 degree view angle. The canopy emissivity values tend to be higher than values in the literature, and are useful for converting infrared thermometer measurements to kinetic temperature and interpreting satellite thermal observations...|$|R

50|$|Six {{distinct}} stages {{are involved}} in the kick: the approach <b>angle,</b> the <b>plant</b> foot force, the swing limb loading, the swinging phase, ball contact, and the follow through. The first is the “approach angle” when a kicker runs up to the ball. The second stage is the plant foot force, which involves situating the supporting foot at a distance lateral from the ball prior to kicking. The third stage is the swing limb loading that requires the preparation of the hip flexors and knee extensors to load or eccentrically stretch for forward movement in order for the swinging limb to strike the ball. It is also known as the backswing phase. The fourth stage is when the hip flexors and knee extensors initiate a forceful contraction in the swinging limb at a high velocity towards the ball. This stage is considered the swinging phase. The fifth stage is when the swinging foot makes complete contact with the ball. Lastly, once the foot makes impact, the kicker should try to keep their foot in contact with the ball as long as they can. This is possible by proceeding with the swing of the limb until ball is out of contact. This stage is also known as the follow through phase.|$|R

The ratio of the intensities of the S-S and C-S stretching bands exhibited no recognizable correlation with either the CS-SC dihedral angle or the CSS bond angle, probably because this ratio is sensitive to the crystalline environment.

30|$|Temporal sensitivities {{pertain to}} {{time of year}} and the time since fire when {{sampling}} occurs. Seasonal timing can impact radiometric quality of data in terms of transmittance, sun angle, {{and the potential for}} enhanced contrast within burn areas. Results typically improve when remote sensing occurs near summer solstice, when illumination is highest, snow effects are minimized, and phenology provides green and productive unburned vegetation that maximally contrasts with fire effects. Remote sensing can degrade during or soon after many fire seasons when incomplete burning, hazy conditions, low sun <b>angles,</b> or <b>plant</b> senescence are more common. In any case, radiometric and seasonal qualities should be selected for optimal discrimination, and multi-temporal datasets should be matched to reliably isolate fire-specific responses from unburned areas. An IA that is delayed to get higher quality data from a particular sensor can ameliorate problems associated with the emergency response RA. An EA, done during the growing season after fire, however, may be the best interval for quality data. Moreover, the lag time enhances detectable qualities of burn severity. Most notable are the first-order effects evident in survivorship and delayed mortality that develop through the growing season after fire. The RA and IA likely miss these ecologically important indicators, resulting in either over- or underestimating severity. Accordingly, EA may provide more valid and complete representation of severity, with broader potential application over the long term.|$|R

Hemispherical photography methods estimate LAI and other canopy structure attributes from analyzing upward-looking fisheye photographs taken beneath the plant canopy. The LAI-2200 calculates LAI and other canopy structure attributes from solar radiation measurements made with a wide-angle optical sensor. Measurements made {{above and below the}} canopy are used to determine canopy light interception at five angles, from which LAI is computed using a model of radiative transfer in vegetative canopies. The LP-80 calculates LAI by means of measuring the difference between light levels above the canopy and at ground level, and factoring in the leaf angle distribution, solar zenith <b>angle,</b> and <b>plant</b> extinction coefficient. Such indirect methods, where LAI is calculated based upon observations of other variables (canopy geometry, light interception, leaf length and width, etc.) are generally faster, amenable to automation, and thereby allow for a larger number of spatial samples to be obtained.

In this thesis, we analyze RGB digital images taken from different view <b>angles</b> of <b>plants</b> and propose an efficient ad-hoc algorithm to identify structures of plants by 3 D volume reconstruction techniques. We study hyperspectral images of plants and extend our scope to other images from different scientific disciplines. Obtaining the spectral and spatial information simul- taneously is a challenging task due to the high dimensionality of hyperspectral images. We first develop a real-time interactive tool for exploring the hyperspectral images as a hy- perspectral data cube. We discover a strong correlation between information entropy and hyperspectral images with respect to the wavelength under which the hyperspectral images are taken. We design an information metric based transfer function allowing users to study the hyperspectral data cube by interactive volume rendering techniques. In this manner, the transfer function changes dynamically with the regions of interest selected by users and both the spatial and spectral information can be preserved. We show the usefulness of our approach in different scientific disciplines including plant science, physics and remote sensing. In addition, our transfer function also works for the traditional volumetric data and our method provides a new interactive way of volume rendering. Adviser: Hongfeng Y...|$|R

An explanation of the results is proposed based on the effect of the nature of surface roughness rather than its magnitude (as measured by the Ra value) on wetting and contact angle. The orientation of grain direction had only a small effect on ‘hold-up’ and was dependent on the surface finish. It is suggested that electro-polishing may give the most cost-effective finish for stainless steel food contact surfaces.

Here, we identified Ovate Family Protein 1 (OFP 1) as a DLT interacting protein. OFP 1 was ubiquitously expressed and the protein was localized in both cytoplasm and nucleus. Overexpression of OFP 1 led to enlarged leaf <b>angles,</b> reduced <b>plant</b> height, and altered grain shape, largely resembled DLT overexpression plants. Genetic analysis showed that the regulation of plant architecture by OFP 1 depends on DLT function. In addition, we found OFP 1 was greatly induced by BR treatment, and OsBZR 1, the critical transcription factor of BR signaling, was physically associated with the OFP 1 promoter. Moreover, we showed that gibberellin synthesis was greatly repressed in OFP 1 overexpression plants, suggesting OFP 1 participates in the inhibition of plant growth by high BR or elevated BR signaling. Furthermore, we revealed that OFP 1 directly interacts with GSK 2 kinase, and inhibition of the kinase activity significantly promotes OFP 1 protein accumulation in plant. Taken together, we identified OFP 1 as an additional regulator of BR responses and revealed how BRs promote OFP 1 at both transcription and protein levels to modulate plant architecture and grain morphology in rice...|$|R
40|$|A vegetação a ser empregada em técnicas propostas pela engenharia natural ou bioengenharia de solos necessita preencher alguns requisitos relacionados a aspectos ecológicos, fitossociológicos e de reprodução. As técnicas de engenharia natural utilizam as plantas em diferentes ângulos em relação ao terreno. Por esta razão, o presente trabalho tem por objetivo avaliar os efeitos de diferentes ângulos de plantio de estacas de Phyllanthus sellowianus Müll. Arg., Salix humboldtiana Willd. e Sebastiania schottiana (Müll. Arg.) Müll. Arg., a fim de determinar a forma mais adequada para o plantio destas espécies. O experimento foi conduzido no Laboratório de Silvicultura, na Universidade Federal de Santa Maria (UFSM), Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul, no período de agosto a novembro de 2007. Os tratamentos consistiram no plantio de estacas das três espécies, em três ângulos diferentes de plantio em relação ao terreno (10, 30 e 90). As estacas com 30 cm de comprimento, com diâmetro variável de 1, 0 a 4, 5 cm, foram coletadas no final de agosto, na região central do estado do Rio Grande do Sul. Dois terços da base das estacas foram inseridos em substrato inerte (areia). O delineamento {{experimental}} foi o inteiramente casualizado, com 30 repetições por tratamento. Após 30 e 60 dias, foram observados os seguintes parâmetros: número de estacas brotadas, número e comprimento dos brotos, e, aos 90 dias, além destes parâmetros, foram determinados a sobrevivência, o comprimento, o diâmetro, a massa seca dos brotos e o comprimento, a massa seca e o volume das raízes. Os dados foram analisados estatisticamente através de programas estatísticos e Excel. Sebastiania schottiana não apresentou brotação, nem enraizamento, o que talvez possa ser explicado pela época de coleta das estacas, devendo ser testada em outras épocas do ano. O ângulo de plantio mostrou influência sobre algumas variáveis para Phyllanthus sellowianus e Salix humboldtiana. Ambas as espécies apresentaram altos valores de sobrevivência, com tendência de maiores resultados para estacas plantadas em ângulo de 10 e 90 para Phyllanthus sellowianus (100 %) e em ângulo de 30 para Salix humboldtiana (87 %). Observaram-se correlações significativas entre as variáveis da parte aérea e do sistema radicial e a área da seção transversal das estacas, para os diferentes ângulos de plantio. As duas espécies apresentaram a maioria das raízes localizadas na base das estacas, exceto para as estacas plantadas em ângulo de 30, as quais tiveram as raízes distribuídas ao longo de toda a porção enterrada. Sugere-se a realização de novos estudos com outras espécies e também com outros ângulos de plantio, assim como a utilização de maior amplitude diamétrica. The vegetation to {{be employed}} in techniques proposed by the natural engineering or soil bioengineering needs to fill out some requisites related to ecological, phytossociological and of reproduction aspects. The techniques in natural engineering use the <b>plants</b> in different <b>angles</b> {{in relation to the}} land. For this reason, the present work aims to evaluate the effects of different angles of stem cuttings planting of Phyllanthus sellowianus Müll. Arg., Salix humboldtiana Willd. and Sebastiania schottiana (Müll. Arg.) Müll. Arg., {{in order to determine the}} most suitable form to the planting of these species. The experiment was conducted in the Laboratory of Silviculture, in the Federal University of Santa Maria (UFSM), Santa Maria, Rio Grande do Sul, in the period of August to November of 2007. The treatments consisted in the three species of stem cuttings planting, in three different <b>angles</b> of <b>planting</b> in relation to the land (10, 30 and 90). The stem cuttings with 30 cm of length, with variable diameter from 1. 0 to 4. 5 cm, were collected in the central region of the state of the Rio Grande do Sul, in the final of August month. Two thirds of the stem cuttings bases were inserted in inert substrate (sand). The experimental design was completely randomized, with 30 repetitions for treatment. After 30 and 60 days, the following parameters were observed: the number of sprouted stem cuttings, number and length of the sprouts, and after 90 days, besides these parameters, were determined the survival, the length, the diameter, and the dry mass of the shoots, and also the length, the diameter, the dry mass and the volume of the roots. The data were statistically analyzed through the statistical programs and Excel. Sebastiania schottiana did not present sprouting, not even rooting, which perhaps could be explained by the stem cuttings time of collection, where that should be tested in other periods of year. The <b>planting</b> <b>angle</b> showed influence on some variables for Phyllanthus sellowianus and Salix humboldtiana. Both the species presented high values of survival, with a tendency for major results for stem cuttings <b>planted</b> in <b>angle</b> of 10 and 90 for Phyllanthus sellowianus (100 %) and in angle of 30 for Salix humboldtiana (87 %). Significant correlations were observed between the variables of the air part and of the radicial system and the area of transverse section of the stem cuttings, for the different <b>planting</b> <b>angles.</b> Both the two species presented the majority of the roots located on the basis of the stem cuttings, except for the ones <b>planted</b> in <b>angle</b> of 30, which had the roots distributed along the whole buried portion. The realization of new studies is suggested with other species and also with another <b>angles</b> of <b>planting,</b> as well as the use of bigger diametric breadth...|$|R
40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} of thermal emission from a canopy/soil surface, where {{the soil and}} the leaves are at different temperatures, Tg and Tc, respectively. The temperature Tm corresponding to a radiometer reading is given by B sub lambda(Tm) = chi-B sub lambda(Tg) + (1 -chi) B sub lambda(Tc), where B sub lambda denotes the Planck blackbody function at wavelength lambda, chi specifies the fraction {{of the field of}} view occupied by the soil at a given view direction, and an emissivity of 1. 0 is assumed for the plants and the soil. It is observed that at large view zenith <b>angles,</b> only the <b>plants</b> are effectively seen, and therefore Tc can be determined from the observations a large zenith angles, to the extent that such observations are practical. Water stress can produce an increase of chi and thus tends to produce an exaggerated increase in the observed temperature compared to the actual increase in canopy temperature. These effects are analyzed for a simulated soybean canopy...|$|R

All these dynamic plant properties can be semi-automatically monitored by a 3 D imaging system that generates plant models by {{the method of}} coded light illumination, fluorescence imaging and computer 3 D reconstruction. Here, we describe the essentials of the method, {{as well as the}} system hardware. We show that the technique can reconstruct, with a high fidelity, the leaf size, the leaf <b>angle</b> and the <b>plant</b> height. The method fails with wilted plants when leaves overlap obscuring their true area. This effect, naturally, also interferes when the method is applied to measure plant growth under water stress. The method is, however, very potent in capturing the plant dynamics under mild stress and without stress. The 3 D reconstruction is also highly effective in correcting geometrical factors that distort measurements of chlorophyll fluorescence emission of naturally positioned plant leaves...|$|R
40|$|The {{stability}} of underground cavities is of increasing importance considering the predominant cavity locations {{built up in}} high mountain and canyon environments. Such cavity locations are characterized by a high initial in situ stress, which results in brittle fracture and deformation of the surrounding rock during cavity construction. This paper presents a numerical study of underground cavern stability considering four factors, namely, mechanical property of surrounding rock, cavern burial depth, lateral pressure coefficient in horizontal direction, and the <b>angle</b> included between <b>plant</b> longitudinal axis and horizontal principal stress. Analytical methods including the key point displacement in side wall, plastic zone volume, and splitting fracture volume are used to characterize the {{stability of}} underground cavern. A modified formula to predict side wall displacement is proposed based on prior work, which is applicable to 3 D computation model by taking horizontal geostress in two directions into account. Eventually, the optimal layout of underground cavern is put forward under different conditions of geostress field...|$|R
40|$|Soil erosion {{plays an}} {{important}} role in plant colonization of semi-arid degraded areas. In this study, we aimed at deepening our knowledge of the mechanisms that control plant colonization on semi-arid eroded slopes in east Spain by (i) determining topographic thresholds for plant colonization, (ii) identifying the soil properties limiting plant establishment and (iii) assessing whether colonizing species have specifi c plant traits to cope with these limitations. Slope angle and aspect were surrogates of erosion rate and water availability, respectively. Since soil erosion and water availability can limit plant establishment and both can interact in the landscape, we analysed variations in colonization success (vegetation cover and species number) with slope angle on 156 slopes, as a function of slope aspect. After determining slope <b>angle</b> thresholds for <b>plant</b> colonization, soil was sampled near the threshold values for soil analysis [nitrogen, phosphorous, calcium carbonate (CaCO 3), water holding capacity]. Plant traits expressing the plant colonizing capacity were analysed both in the pool of species colonizing the steep slopes just below the threshold and in the pool of species inhabiting gentler slopes and absent from the slopes just below the threshold. Results show that the slope <b>angle</b> threshold for <b>plant</b> colonization decreased from north to south. For the vegetation cover, threshold values were 63 °, 50 °, 46 °, 41 ° for the north, east, west and south slope aspect classes, respectively, and 65 °, 53 °, 49 ° and 45 ° for the species richness and the same aspect classes. No differences existed in soil properties at slope angle threshold values among slope aspects and between slope positions (just below and above the threshold) within slope aspect classes. This suggests that variations between slope aspect classes in the slope angle threshold result from differences in the colonizing capacity of plants which is controlled by water availability. Long-distance dispersal and mucilage production were preferably associated with the pool of colonizing species. These results are discussed in the perspective of a more effi cient ecological restoration of degraded semi-arid ecosystems where soil erosion acts as an ecological fi lter for plant establishment. status: publishe...|$|R

Rivers used as a dumping ground for unwanted goods and more often than not, they have been physically damaged and destroyed beyond irrecoverable condition. When this happen, human and animal are the subject to disastrous situation. However, experiences from a nur-nber ofdeveloped nations who have gone through this bad episode suggest that river cannot be taken for gtanted. Planning, up-grading, redevelopment program have to be seriously considered and mdertaken before it is too late. Usually an integrated development plogram would enable the inland waterways including river network to be developed and used while generating substantial economic and environrnental benefits including transpofcation system.
