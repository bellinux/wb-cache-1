5|$|In late 1976, Bakshi {{learned that}} John Boorman was {{contracted}} to direct {{an adaptation of}} The Lord of the Rings, in which J. R. R. Tolkien's three-volume novel would be condensed into a single film. Bakshi arranged a meeting with Mike Medavoy, United Artists' head of production, who agreed to let Bakshi direct {{in exchange for the}} $3 million that had been spent on Boorman's screenplay. Down the hall from Medavoy was Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer president Dan Melnick, who interrupted a meeting with Peter Bogdanovich when he learned that Bakshi wanted to discuss acquiring the rights to The Lord of the Rings. Melnick agreed to pay United Artists $3 million, but was soon fired; the project was canceled by his replacement, Dick Shepherd. Bakshi contacted Saul Zaentz, who wrote <b>a</b> <b>check</b> <b>to</b> cover MGM's debt and agreed to fund the $8 million budget for the first of what was initially planned as a series of three films, and later negotiated down to two. Before production began, Bakshi and Zaentz insisted that the Tolkien estate receive residuals from the film.|$|E

25|$|Malthus wrote two books, An {{essay on}} the {{principle}} of population (published in 1798) and Principles of political economy (published in 1820). The second book which was a rebuttal of Say's law had little influence on contemporary economists. However, is first book became a major influence on classical liberalism. In that book, Malthus claimed that population growth would outstrip food production, because population grew geometrically while food production grew arithmetically. As people were provided with food, they would reproduce until their growth outstripped the food supply. Nature would then provide <b>a</b> <b>check</b> <b>to</b> growth in the forms of vice and misery. No gains in income could prevent this and any welfare for the poor would be self-defeating. The poor were in fact responsible for their own problems which could have been avoided through self-restraint.|$|E
25|$|When the XF-11 {{finally came}} to a halt after {{destroying}} three houses, the fuel tanks exploded, setting fire to the aircraft and a nearby home at 808 North Whittier Drive, owned by Lt Col.

Durkin, who {{happened to be in the}} area visiting friends. Hughes sustained significant injuries in the crash, including a crushed collar bone, multiple cracked ribs, crushed chest with collapsed left lung, shifting his heart to the right side of the chest cavity, and numerous third-degree burns. An oft-told story said that Hughes sent <b>a</b> <b>check</b> <b>to</b> the Marine weekly for the remainder of his life as a sign of gratitude. However, Durkin's daughter denied that he received any money from his rescue of Hughes.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to Adam Smith's legacy, Say's law, Malthus theories of population and Ricardo's iron law of wages became central doctrines of classical economics. Jean Baptiste Say challenged Smith's labour theory of value, believing that prices {{were determined by}} utility and also emphasised the critical role of the entrepreneur in the economy. However neither of those observations became accepted by British economists at the time. Thomas Malthus wrote An essay {{on the principle of}} population in 1798, becoming a major influence on classical liberalism.

25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{important}} of all presidential powers is the command of the United States Armed Forces as its commander-in-chief. While the power to declare war is constitutionally vested in Congress, the president has ultimate responsibility for direction and disposition of the military. The present-day operational command of the Armed Forces (belonging to the Department of Defense) is normally exercised through the Secretary of Defense, with assistance of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to the Combatant Commands, as outlined in the presidentially approved Unified Command Plan (UCP). The framers of the Constitution took care to limit the president's powers regarding the military; Alexander Hamilton explains this in Federalist No. 69: Congress, pursuant to the War Powers Resolution, must authorize any troop deployments longer than 60 days, although that process relies on triggering mechanisms that have never been employed, rendering it ineffectual. Additionally, Congress provides <b>a</b> <b>check</b> <b>to</b> presidential military power through its control over military spending and regulation. While historically presidents initiated the process for going to war, critics have charged that there have been several conflicts in which presidents did not get official declarations, including Theodore Roosevelt's military move into Panama in 1903, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the invasions of Grenada in 1983 and Panama in 1990.|$|E
500|$|Leonard Nimoy as Mr. Spock, the Enterprises half-Vulcan, half-human science officer.

Katzenberg gave Nimoy <b>a</b> <b>check</b> <b>to</b> make up for his lost royalties, and the actor attended the March 1978 press conference {{with the rest of the}} returning cast. Nimoy was dissatisfied with the script, and his meeting with Katzenberg led to an agreement that the final script would need Nimoy's approval. Despite the financial issues, Nimoy said he was comfortable with being identified as Mr. Spock because it had a positive impact on his fame.|$|E

500|$|Acquaintance Robert Cathcart {{says that}} by 1980, {{in his private}} conversations with Savage, he knew him to have {{conservative}} political views. Schwartz stated Savage became alienated from the North Beach scene in the early 1980s. Savage had intense arguments with his liberal friends. When asked about his shift in politics and other views, Savage replied, [...] "I was once a child; I am now a man." [...] Savage has cited many occurrences in his life that helped shape his conservative views. Savage states that his opinions on welfare were partly shaped by his first job out of college as a social worker. He described one incident in which his supervisor had him deliver <b>a</b> <b>check</b> <b>to</b> a welfare client to furnish their apartment, while his own apartment was furnished with cardboard boxes. Another turning point occurred {{for him as a}} writer of health and nutrition books in the 1980s, when he experienced what he saw as [...] "political opposition" [...] after making the suggestion that the closure of homosexual bathhouses might be necessary in response to the emerging AIDS epidemic. In 1994 his final health and nutrition manuscript, Immigrants and Epidemics, was rejected by publishers for being inflammatory. In 1996, Savage applied to become the Dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California, Berkeley. The University instead selected award-winning journalist and China scholar Orville Schell. Savage sued the University, contending discrimination for being conservative. Savage later dropped the lawsuit.|$|E
