5|$|Ants {{communicate}} with each other using pheromones, sounds, <b>and</b> <b>touch.</b> <b>The</b> use of pheromones as chemical signals is more developed in ants, such as the red harvester ant, than in other hymenopteran groups. Like other insects, ants perceive smells with their long, thin, and mobile antennae. The paired antennae provide information about the direction and intensity of scents. Since most ants live on the ground, they use the soil surface to leave pheromone trails that may be followed by other ants. In species that forage in groups, a forager that finds food marks a trail {{on the way back to}} the colony; this trail is followed by other ants, these ants then reinforce the trail when they head back with food to the colony. When the food source is exhausted, no new trails are marked by returning ants and the scent slowly dissipates. This behaviour helps ants deal with changes in their environment. For instance, when an established path to a food source is blocked by an obstacle, the foragers leave the path to explore new routes. If an ant is successful, it leaves a new trail marking the shortest route on its return. Successful trails are followed by more ants, reinforcing better routes and gradually identifying the best path.|$|E
5|$|In the men's tournament, Fiji secured {{their first}} Olympic medal with {{emphatic}} 43–7 win over Great Britain, as South Africa won bronze with big win over Japan. Having never previously won an Olympic medal of any colour, Fiji won gold at the Deodoro Stadium by demolishing Britain in the final. The opening minute saw Osea Kolinisau left one {{and one with}} Tom Mitchell and although his fellow captain halted his progress, Kolinisau {{was still able to}} stretch <b>and</b> <b>touch</b> <b>the</b> ball down behind his head. Almost straight away, Fiji had a second try. Samisoni Viriviri muscled his way past two players before offloading to Jerry Tuwai to score under the posts. After that Britain were shell shocked and Fiji were in no mood to show any compassion racking up a further five tries. A silver medal is still a considerable achievement for a team that was only formed ten weeks prior the tournament. Aside from the one-sided nature of the final, it still must rank among the most unexpected of British success stories at these Rio Games. Where other teams on the sevens circuit had been preparing two years or longer for the moment when rugby returned to the Olympic fold after a 92-year wait, Team Great Britain coach Amor only got his players {{together for the first time}} on May 30. England, Wales and Scotland all compete as separate nations in the World Sevens Series, where their results veered between the disappointing and disastrous, this season.|$|E

5|$|Trinidad {{announced}} a comeback on March 2, 2004. On October 2, 2004, he fought against Ricardo Mayorga, in Madison Square Garden. Early {{in the first}} round Mayorga was on the offensive connecting several combinations, later in the round Trinidad connected some punches to his opponent's face. Mayorga reacted defiantly while lowering his defense, which Trinidad used to continue the offensive during the closing seconds. In the second round he continued connecting with combinations to Mayorga's face which caused him to bleed from his nose; the round concluded with both fighters exchanging punches. In the third round Mayorga attempted to counter with punches to the body but did not do significant damage to his opponent, however later in the round one of these punches made Trinidad lose his balance <b>and</b> <b>touch</b> <b>the</b> floor with one glove which the referee counted as a knockdown. In the fourth round both boxers traded hard combinations. In the fifth Trinidad displayed control of the offense's tempo injuring Mayorga and opening a cut under one of his eyes. This pattern continued in the sixth and seventh round, and the cut on Mayorga's face began to swell. In the eight round Trinidad scored several knockdowns, Mayorga continued after two knockdowns, but lost by technical knockout following a third knockdown.|$|E

25|$|The {{provisions}} of the treaty regarding the investiture were put into effect at the Diet of Augsburg in 1530, when the Pomeranian dukes Barnim IX and George I {{for the first time}} formally received their duchy as a fief. Emperor Charles V and the prince-electors were the first to enter the Diet, and after they had taken their seats, Joachim I Nestor formally announced that he protested against the investiture of the House of Pomerania, but would be satisfied if he was allowed to participate in the ceremony <b>and</b> <b>touch</b> <b>the</b> Pomeranian flags. The emperor replied that the protest is noted. George, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach, seconded the elector's protest.|$|E
25|$|Incubation {{takes about}} 16 days in Crypturellus, which {{contains}} the smallest species, and 19–20 days in Tinamus and Eudromia. During this period the male is typically silent; {{if he does}} call, he does so away from the nest. As he incubates, he will leave the nest to feed, and he may be gone from 45 minutes to five hours, covering the eggs when he leaves. While incubating, he is mainly motionless and reluctant to move, even from potential danger. It is possible for a human observer to approach <b>and</b> <b>touch</b> <b>the</b> incubating male without eliciting an overt response. Some species will flatten themselves against the ground, stretch out their necks, and raise {{their backs to the}} air. This posture causes them to resemble a plant; however, if it is overdone, the eggs become visible from behind.|$|E

However, following {{the publication of}} the book and the pastor's public remonstrations, the parsonage became a place of pilgrimage for admirers wanting to see it with their own eyes. Charlotte's husband recalled that he had to protect his father-in-law, when on the short path to the church they had to push their way through the crowds of people wanting to reach out <b>and</b> <b>touch</b> <b>the</b> cape of the father of the Brontë girls. The hundreds of visitors became thousands, coming from all over Britain and even from across the Atlantic.

500|$|The mascot is a {{diamondback terrapin}} named Testudo, which means [...] "turtle" [...] in Latin. It {{is also the}} name of an ancient Roman {{military}} tactic, in which soldiers protected their infantry square from projectiles by completely enclosing it with their shields. Derivations of the word have also been used in scientific nomenclature related to the reptile, such as the order Testudine and the family Testudinidae. In 1933, the graduating class raised funds for a 300-pound bronze replica of a terrapin. It was initially placed in front of Ritchie Coliseum, which was then the home arena of the basketball team. In 1951, after being the subject of numerous pranks, the statue was relocated to Maryland Stadium, reinforced with 700pounds of concrete, and anchored with steel rods. It was moved again in the 1960s, in front of McKeldin Library, and a second replica was placed at Maryland Stadium in 1992. In the 2000s, under coach Ralph Friedgen, it was a pregame tradition for the football players to walk 200yards, through what is known as [...] "Terp Alley", to the locker rooms, <b>and</b> <b>touch</b> <b>the</b> bronze Testudo.|$|E

The girl's [...] was quite warm and moist, and the finger nails were neatly trimmed. The fingers are not the least bit stiffened...

The child's body is very thin as compared with her limbs.... There is not much substance in her flesh, however; it is soft and flabby... almost ice-cold.... As regards the child's breathing, it is so feeble that {{it is almost impossible to}} detect it; you cannot feel it by holding the cheek to her mouth, and the only faintest flutter is felt when the hand is laid over the region of the heart.|$|E
500|$|The next {{match was}} a Texas Bullrope {{match for the}} WWE Championship between Eddie Guerrero and John [...] "Bradshaw" [...] Layfield (JBL). One preplanned move in the match saw Guerrero hit JBL with a steel chair, which caused JBL to bleed. Guerrero went on to touch three {{turnbuckles}} {{but was unable to}} touch the fourth as JBL held him back. Guerrero executed a dropkick on JBL and attempted to touch the fourth again but JBL held him back and took the advantage. JBL threw Guerrero into a broadcast table and executed a powerbomb through the broadcast table. In the end, each man had touched three turnbuckles and were vying for the fourth. Guerrero attempted to jump over JBL <b>and</b> <b>touch</b> <b>the</b> remaining turnbuckle, but was unsuccessful; he splashed himself and JBL into the turnbuckle. Guerrero was declared the winner, as it appeared he had touched all four turnbuckles first, but General Manager Kurt Angle came out and reversed the decision. He showed on the TitanTron that JBL's shoulder touched the final turnbuckle before Guerrero's hand, also, Angle stated that it doesn't matter which part of the body touch, all that matters is who touch first; as a result, JBL won the title.|$|E
500|$|Writing in {{the journal}} for the Society for Psychical Research, Count Perovsky-Petrovo-Solovovo {{described}} a letter by Dr. Barthez, a physician {{in the court of}} Empress Eugenie, which claimed a sitter Morio de l'lle caught Home using his foot to fake supposed spirit effects during a séance in Biarritz in 1857. Home wore thin shoes, easy to take off and draw on, and also cut socks that left the toes free. [...] "At the appropriate moment he takes off one of his shoes and with his foot pulls a dress here, a dress there, rings a bell, knocks one way and another, and, the thing done, quickly puts his shoe on again." [...] Home positioned himself between the empress and Napoleon III. One of the séance sitters known as General Fleury also suspected that Home was utilizing trickery and asked to leave but returned unobserved to watch from another door behind Home. He saw Home slip his foot from his shoe <b>and</b> <b>touch</b> <b>the</b> arm of the Empress, who believed it to be one of her dead children. The observer stepped forward and revealed the fraud, and Home was conducted out of the country: [...] "The order was to keep the incident secret." [...] The allegations described by Dr. Barthez and General Fleury are second hand and have caused dispute between psychical researchers and skeptics.|$|E
