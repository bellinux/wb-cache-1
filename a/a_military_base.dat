The elaborate flint exterior is finely detailed in the Gothic style, especially around the windows. English Heritage has listed it at Grade II for its architectural and historical importance.|$|E
5|$|During the {{negotiations}} {{leading to the}} federation of the Australian colonies, Wagga Wagga was a contender for {{the site of the}} capital for the new nation. During World War I the town was the starting point for the Kangaroo recruitment march. The Great Depression and the resulting hardship saw Wagga Wagga become the centre of a secession movement for the Riverina region. Wagga Wagga became a garrison town during World War II with the establishment of <b>a</b> <b>military</b> <b>base</b> at Kapooka and Royal Australian Air Force bases at Forest Hill and Uranquinty. After the war, Wagga Wagga was proclaimed as a city in 1946 and new suburbs were developed to the south of the city. In 1982 the city was amalgamated with the neighbouring Kyeamba and Mitchell Shires to form the City of Wagga Wagga local government area.|$|E

In 2020, the United Defense Force (UDF) achieves one solid {{victory over the}} Mimics at Verdun. In Britain, General Brigham, head of the UDF, commands Major William Cage, a public affairs officer with no combat experience, to cover a massive assault on France.

5|$|In August 1939, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany {{signed the}} Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, in which Eastern European {{countries}} {{were divided into}} spheres of interest; Finland belonged to the Soviet sphere of interest. In October 1939, Stalin gained control of the Baltic states and turned his sights on Finland, confident that control could be gained without great effort. The Soviet Union demanded territories on the Karelian Isthmus, the islands of the Gulf of Finland and <b>a</b> <b>military</b> <b>base</b> near the Finnish capital Helsinki, similar to the demands presented in the previous years. The Finns again refused, and the Red Army attacked on 30 November 1939. Simultaneously, Stalin set up a puppet government for the Finnish Democratic Republic, headed by the Finnish communist Otto Wille Kuusinen.|$|E
5|$|In May 1996, about 200 {{soldiers}} of the Central African Republic mutinied in Bangui, demanding salary increases and the abdication of Ange-Félix Patassé. In the aftermath, the renegades plundered and killed more than 50 people. Following this, the French troops stationed in the country suppressed the rebellion and restored the dictatorial power. After being elected, President Patassé announced a national unity government in early 1997. The Patassé government, the opposition parties, and religious groups signed the Bangui Agreements in January 1997 which were a series of measures designed to reconcile competing political factions, reform and strengthen the economy. The same year, the rebel troops refused <b>a</b> <b>military</b> <b>base</b> in Bangui and in June a new revolt broke out.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 20th century, the Falklands served an {{important}} role in Britain's territorial claims to subantarctic islands and a section of Antarctica. The Falklands governed these territories as the Falkland Islands Dependencies starting in 1908, and retained them until their dissolution in 1985. The Falklands also played a minor role in the two world wars as <b>a</b> <b>military</b> <b>base</b> aiding control of the South Atlantic. In the First World War Battle of the Falkland Islands in December 1914, a Royal Navy fleet defeated an Imperial German squadron. In the Second World War, following the December 1939 Battle of the River Plate, the battle-damaged HMS Exeter steamed to the Falklands for repairs. In 1942, a battalion en route to India was redeployed to the Falklands as a garrison amid fears of a Japanese seizure of the archipelago. After the war ended, the Falklands economy was affected by declining wool prices and the political uncertainty resulting from the revived sovereignty dispute between the United Kingdom and Argentina.|$|E
5|$|Poti is {{the crucial}} port of Georgia on the Black Sea {{and serves as}} an {{essential}} entry point for Transcaucasia and the landlocked nations of Central Asia. Russian aircraft attacked the town of Poti on 8 August, causing a two-day shutdown of the port. Russia positioned ships {{in the vicinity of}} Poti and other Georgian ports on 10 August 2008. The next day, Georgian and Russian representatives said that Russian troops were in Poti, although Russia claimed it had only sent a task force for surveying the area. On 13 August, six Georgian naval vessels were sunk by Russian troops in Poti. Russian deputy chief of the General staff, Anatoliy Nogovitsyn, denied the Russian presence in Poti the following day. One day after Russia's declaration of the beginning of the withdrawal from Georgia, 70 Russian soldiers moved into the port on the morning of 19 August. Russian forces took twenty-one Georgian soldiers prisoner and grabbed five US Humvees in Poti, taking them to <b>a</b> <b>military</b> <b>base</b> occupied by Russian troops in Senaki. The Wall Street Journal said that Russian actions in Poti constituted an additional attack on Georgian economy.
