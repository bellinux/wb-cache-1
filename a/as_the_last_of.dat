5|$|SMS Babenberg was a pre-dreadnought {{battleship}} {{built by}} the Austro-Hungarian Navy in 1899. She was launched on 4 October 1902 <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>of</b> three s. Along with her sister ships, she participated at the bombardment of Ancona during World War I. At {{the end of the}} war, she was ceded to Great Britain as a war prize. She was scrapped in Italy in 1921.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the writers}} who {{fell victim to}} the regime of Sejanus and its aftermath, were the historians Aulus Cremutius Cordus and Velleius Paterculus and the poet Phaedrus. Cordus was brought to trial in AD 25 by Sejanus, under accusations of treason. He was charged for having eulogized Marcus Junius Brutus and spoken of Gaius Cassius Longinus <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>of</b> the true Romans, which was {{considered}} an offence under the Lex Maiestatis; the Senate ordered the burning of his writings. His fall is elaborated upon by Seneca the Younger, {{in his letter to}} Cordus' daughter Marcia To Marcia, On Consolation. Seneca tells us that her father most likely incurred Sejanus' displeasure for criticising him because he had commissioned a statue of himself. We also know from this source that Cordus starved himself to death. Marcia was instrumental in saving her father's work so that it could be published again under Caligula.|$|E
5|$|Balch was {{authorized}} in March 1911 <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>of</b> four ships of the , which was {{almost identical to}} the s authorized at the same time. Construction of the vessel—like her three sister ships—was awarded to William Cramp and Sons of Philadelphia which laid down her keel on 7 May 1912. On 21 December, Balch was launched by sponsor Miss Grace Balch, daughter of the ship's namesake, George Beale Balch. The ship was the first U.S. Navy ship named for Balch, a US Navy officer {{who served in the}} Mexican-American War and the American Civil War and, as a rear admiral, served as Superintendent of United States Naval Academy from 1879–81.|$|E
50|$|She was {{the second}} child of Herman VI, Margrave of Baden and his wife Gertrude, Duchess of Mödling, titular Duchess of Austria and Styria <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> House of Babenberg. For his {{maternal}} ancestry, some historians consider Agnes <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> descendant <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Babenbergs.|$|R

5|$|Finally, by 19:00 B Company {{was able}} break contact and withdrew after a five-hour battle. Both sides then fell {{back as the}} Viet Cong also dispersed, {{evacuating}} most of their dead and wounded. Meanwhile, under covering fire from the APCs of 2 Troop, B Company boarded the remaining carriers, moving into a night harbour near the landing zone with {{the remainder of the}} battalion at 19:25, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>of</b> their casualties were extracted by helicopter. Mortars, artillery fire and airstrikes covered the Australian withdrawal, and then proceeded to pound the abandoned battlefield into the evening. That night the body of the dead APC driver was evacuated by helicopter, as American AC-47 Spooky gunships circled overhead, dropping flares to illuminate the battlefield and strafing likely Viet Cong positions, while F-4 Phantoms dropped napalm. The airstrikes then continued in preparation for a further assault by the Australians planned for the following day. Otherwise there was no further fighting that night, and both sides remained unmolested. Ultimately no attack was made against the Australian base at Nui Dat that night either, while no unusual activity was reported in the area.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Île de France in December, Lhermitte steered for Port Louis but {{was intercepted}} by the British {{blockade}} squadron, comprising the 74-gun ship {{of the line}} HMS Tremendous and the 50-gun HMS Adamant. Unable to reach safety, Lhermitte evaded pursuit long enough to drive Preneuse onto a beach {{at the mouth of}} the Tombeau. After a brief exchange of fire the wrecked frigate was surrendered and British boarding parties in ship's boats rowed inshore to Preneuse, removed the survivors and burnt the remains. Watching from the shore <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>of</b> his command burned on the beach, Sercey subsequently retired from military service.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, {{even before}} the British column began to form up for the march to Fort Edward, the Indians renewed attacks on the largely defenceless British. At 5 am, Indians entered huts in the fort housing wounded British who were {{supposed}} to be under the care of French doctors, and killed and scalped them. Monro complained that the terms of capitulation had been violated, but his contingent was forced to surrender some of its baggage {{in order to be able}} even to begin the march. As they marched off, they were harassed by the swarming Indians, who snatched at them, grabbing for weapons and clothing, and pulling away with force those that resisted their actions, including many of the women, children, servants and slaves. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>of</b> the men left the encampment, a war whoop sounded, and a contingent of Abenaki warriors seized several men at the rear of the column.|$|E

5|$|The {{ship was}} {{laid down in}} 1896–97 by Normand at their Le Havre shipyard, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>of</b> the four s. She was named after a French type of blunderbuss; all of the ships in her class were named after weapons. Espingole was {{launched}} on 28 June 1900 and completed around September when she ran her speed trials. Construction costs were 1,690,994 francs. She {{was assigned to the}} Mediterranean Fleet in December and made a number of port visits in France, Corsica and French North Africa throughout 1901. Her rudder was damaged after striking the bottom off Golfe-Juan and Espingole was under repair 3–27 September.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the last}} European war of the old style, in which armies maneuvered sedately at a {{distance}} while diplomats hustled between capitals to resolve their Majesties' differences. Given the length of time—six months—the cost in life and treasure was high. In light of the scale of warfare experienced in Europe less than a generation later in the French Revolutionary Wars and Napoleonic Wars, though, this six-month engagement seems mild. Yet while historians often dismissed it <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>of</b> the archaic mode of Ancien Régime warfare, elements of the war foreshadowed conflicts to come: the sheer sizes of the armies deployed reflected emerging abilities and willingness to conscript, train, equip and field larger armies than had been done in previous generations.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Nicole was a {{short-lived}} and unusually asymmetric tropical cyclone that caused extensive rainfall and flooding in Jamaica during the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season. It was the sixteenth tropical cyclone and the fourteenth named storm of the season, as well <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>of</b> a record eight tropical storms {{to form in}} September. Originating from a broad monsoonal low, Nicole became a tropical depression over the northwestern Caribbean Sea on September28. It maintained an unusual structure as it tracked northeastward, with a poorly defined wind circulation and few thunderstorms near its center. Nicole approached the coast of Cuba as a weak tropical storm, losing {{its status as a}} tropical cyclone over the territory on September29. The remnants emerged over the Bahamas and eventually became absorbed by a separate extratropical system.|$|E

5|$|When {{formed in}} 1847, Sullivan County had no boroughs. The unincorporated village of Cherry Hill in Cherry Township {{served as the}} first county seat until 1850, when Laporte was founded in the {{geographic}} center of the county, and became its new county seat. In 1850 {{the population of the}} county was 3,694 and it grew steadily to a peak of 12,134 in 1900. This was just after the borough of Eagles Mere was incorporated <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>of</b> the county's municipalities, in 1899. Much of this growth was fueled by lumber-based industry, but the virgin forests were almost all gone by 1900 and the population declined in eight of eleven decades since then, decreasing by a total of 47% between 1900 and 2010.|$|E
5|$|With Harrison's entry, the Quarrymen now {{had four}} guitarists. Lennon and McCartney {{suggested}} to Griffiths that he instead buy a bass guitar, but Griffiths refused {{because of the}} expense. The two subsequently convinced Nigel Walley, still acting as the group's manager, to fire Griffiths. Walley regretted the incident, {{and as a result}} gradually severed his ties with the Quarrymen. Around this same time, Len Garry contracted tubercular meningitis, and spent seven months in the hospital, never playing with the group again. This left Colin Hanton <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>of</b> the group of Lennon's Quarry Bank classmates that originally comprised the group. In March, McCartney bought an Elpico amplifier with two inputs, and he and Harrison added pickups to their guitars, giving the Quarrymen an electric sound for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Hannibal was now {{isolated}} at {{the northern}} end of the British line, under heavy fire from Formidable as well as the Spanish shore batteries and gunboats and unable to manoeuvre or effectively respond. Ferris attempted to notify Saumarez of his ship's precarious position, but his signal halyards had been torn away by shot and it was sometime before assistance could be organised. The rest of the squadron was ordered to provide ship's boats to attempt to tow Hannibal off the shoal but the attempt failed, Caesars pinnace sinking in the process after being struck by a cannonball. Ultimately, Hannibal was left stranded <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>of</b> the seabreeze disappeared, preventing any of the other British ships from coming to Ferris' assistance. There was however a light land breeze from the northwest that initially favoured the outnumbered and battered French squadron, Linois immediately ordering his ships to sever their anchor cables and use the breeze to manoeuvre slowly into stronger defensive positions closer inshore. His flagship Formidable successfully completed the manoeuvre, but neither Indomptable nor Desaix could be brought back under control in time, and both grounded, Desaix directly in front of Algeciras and Indomptable northeast of Isla Verda with her bow facing out to sea.|$|E

5|$|Shrek {{established}} DreamWorks Animation {{as a prime}} competitor to Pixar in {{feature film}} computer animation, and grossed $484.4 million at the worldwide box office against its $60 million production budget. It was acclaimed as an animated film worthy of adult interest, with many adult-oriented jokes and themes but a simple enough plot and humor to appeal to children. Shrek won the first ever Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, and was also nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay. It was also nominated for six British Academy of Film and Television Arts awards, including the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for Eddie Murphy for his voice performance as Donkey, and won the BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. The film's success prompted DreamWorks to create three sequels—Shrek 2 (2004), Shrek the Third (2007), and Shrek Forever After (2010), two holiday specials—Shrek the Halls (2007) and Scared Shrekless (2010), and a spin-off film—Puss in Boots (2011). A fifth film, planned <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>of</b> the series, was cancelled in 2009, with the announcement that the fourth film would conclude the series. However, the fifth film was revived in 2016, with a planned release for 2019/2020. The film's success also inspired other merchandise, such as video games, a stage musical, and a comic book adaptation by Dark Horse Comics. The film's main title character was awarded his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in May 2010.|$|E
