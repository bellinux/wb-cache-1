5|$|The {{main event}} at Backlash was a triple threat match, a match {{involving}} three wrestlers, for the WWE Championship between John Cena, Triple H, and Edge. The buildup to the match began when Triple H lost the Royal Rumble match, a multi-competitor match type in which wrestlers are eliminated until one is left and declared winner but {{participated in the}} 2006 Road to WrestleMania Tournament, where the winner would become the number-one contender to the WWE Championship at WrestleMania. Triple H won the tournament. Cena defeated Triple H at WrestleMania to retain the title after forcing him {{to submit to the}} STFU, a move in which the wrestler wraps his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> neck of the opponent in a sleeper hold instead of pulling back on the head of the opponent. The next night on Raw, one of WWE's primary television programs, Triple H demanded another shot at the WWE Championship, but Edge and Lita (Edge's girlfriend) interrupted Triple H's segment. Edge said that he became WWE Champion at New Year's Revolution when he cashed in his Money in the Bank title shot, that he won at WrestleMania 21, and defeating Cena at the event, after Cena had defeated five other men in an Elimination Chamber, a match featuring wrestlers fighting in a ring surrounded by a steel structure of chain and girders. Cena, however, reclaimed the Championship at the 2006 Royal Rumble, when he defeated Edge. Edge claimed {{that it was time for}} a new opponent for the WWE Championship, after stating that at WrestleMania, Triple H lost his opportunity when he lost to Cena. All three men had a series of Handicap matches, a match consisting of one team of wrestlers facing off against a team of wrestlers with numerical superiority such as three against two, or two against one leading up to Backlash with Triple H pinning Cena after tucking Cena's head between his knees and jumping up to slam his head to the mat, a move that Triple H calls the Pedigree, Cena forcing Edge to submit to the STFU, and Edge executing a shoulder block takedown on Triple H and pinning him. It was then announced that Cena would defend the WWE Championship in a Triple Threat match against Triple H and Edge at Backlash.|$|E
25|$|Rex Goodwin is {{the leader}} of the Yliaster cell working in New Domino City and the Director of Sector Security. He, {{alongside}} his brother Roman, was an assistant to Professor Fudo during the Zero Reverse accident. With his elitism, he transformed the city into a hierarchical society. He shows interest in the Signers, and he explains their significance to Jack prior to holding the Fortune Cup to gather the remaining Signers and awaken their powers. Rex is shown to be aggressive if necessary, but he usually has a calm demeanor. A legendary Turbo Duelist, Goodwin lost his left <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> time he didn't finish Daedalus Bridge (the only means for the Satellite to be connected with New Domino City) and had it replaced with a cybernetic one which doubles as his duel disk. He additionally possesses his brother's severed arm with the head part of the Mark of the Dragon. In the dub he claims to be the fifth signer, but it is not actually so. But after the deaths of the Dark Signers, Rex reveals himself to have become one of them during a duel with Roman, having the condor birthmark on his back and control of the Earthbound Immortal Wiraqocha Rasca. Furthermore, he integrates his brother's arm onto himself to gain the power of a Signer as part of his plan to use both the Earthbound Immortals and the Crimson Dragon to recreate the world in his image. He is defeated by the joint efforts of Yusei, Jack and Crow, and passes onto the afterlife with Roman. His ace is the Synchro Monster Sun Dragon Inti and the Dark Synchro Monster Moon Dragon Quilla.|$|E

500|$|The {{main event}} scripted into Backlash on the Raw brand was a Fatal Four Way {{match for the}} WWE Championship, a {{standard}} match involving four wrestlers between John Cena, Edge, Shawn Michaels and Randy Orton. At the Royal Rumble in January, Michaels {{was one of the}} final two participants in the Royal Rumble match, a multi-competitor match type in which wrestlers are eliminated until one is left and declared winner before being eliminated by The Undertaker. On the February 5, 2007 episode of Raw, Michaels earned the right to become the number-one contender to the WWE Championship at WrestleMania after defeating Edge and Orton in a Triple Threat match, a standard match involving three wrestlers. At WrestleMania, Cena defeated Michaels to retain the WWE Championship, after [...] wrapping his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> neck of Michaels in a sleeper hold, a submission referred to as an STFU. On the April 9 episode of Raw, a standard match between Michaels and Orton to determine the number-one contender to the WWE Championship ended in a no contest, after both men's shoulders were on the mat while they were pinning one another. Later that night, during Edge's talk show, [...] "The Cutting Edge", Edge claimed that General Manager Jonathan Coachman, a portrayed match maker and rules enforcer had named him the number-one contender to the WWE title. Honorary General Manager Michael Pena, from the Make-a-Wish Foundation, however, announced that Michaels, Orton, and Edge would face Cena for the title at Backlash in a Fatal Four-Way match, a standard match involving four wrestlers.|$|E
500|$|The seventh {{match was}} the Extreme Rules {{lumberjack}} match between Sabu and John Cena. Before the match began, the ECW and Raw superstars {{made their way}} to ringside to take their place as lumberjacks. The match quickly began with Cena throwing Sabu out of the ring onto the Raw lumberjacks, in which they assaulted Sabu and threw him back in the ring. Sabu would later get the upper hand and throw Cena out onto the ECW lumberjacks, at ringside. Throughout the match, Sabu took the advantage over Cena as he performed a somersault leg drop, driving a steel chair onto Cena's face. Cena got the upper hand when he was able to counter a flying crossbody attempt by Sabu. Mid-way in the match, the ECW and Raw lumberjacks started brawling at ringside. At ringside, the ECW lumberjacks began their assault on Cena, after [...] he was hit with a steel chair by Sabu. They laid his head on a table, in which Sabu attempted to perform a high-flying maneuver. The Raw superstars, however, gave Cena the upper hand to hit Sabu with a kendo stick in mid-air. Back in the ring, Cena hit Sabu with a steel chair then lifted him over his shoulders and threw him down on a table that was at ringside to execute the FU. Following this, Sabu was thrown back into the ring where Cena applied the STFU, a move in which the wrestler wraps his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> neck of the opponent in a sleeper hold instead of pulling back on the head of the opponent, in which Sabu submitted to and giving Cena the win.|$|E

2500|$|Among macronarians, fossilized skin {{impressions}} {{are only}} known from Haestasaurus, Tehuelchesaurus and Saltasaurus. Both Tehuelchesaurus and Haestasaurus may be {{closely related to}} Europasaurus as basal macronarians, and the characteristics of all sauropod skin impressions are similar. Haestasaurus, the first dinosaur known from skin impressions, preserved integument over {{a portion of the}} <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> elbow joint approximately [...] in area. Dermal impressions are more widespread in the material of Tehuelchesaurus, where they are known from the areas of the forelimb, scapula and torso. There are no bony plates or nodules, to indicate armour, but there are several types of scales. The skin types of Tehuelchesaurus are overall more similar to those found in diplodocids and Haestasaurus than in the titanosaur embryos of Auca Mahuevo. As the shape and articulation of the preserved tubercles in these basal macronarians are similar in other taxa where skin is preserved, including specimens of Brontosaurus excelsus and intermediate diplodocoids, such dermal structures are probably widespread throughout Neosauropoda.|$|E

Haestasaurus, the first dinosaur known from skin impressions, preserved integument over {{a portion of}} the <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> elbow joint approximately [...] in area. Small, hexagonal scales are preserved, ranging from [...] in diameter. It has been suggested that the convex surface of the scales was from the internal size of the integument, facing the bones, but this has been rejected as the convex surfaces are preverded on the outside of Saltasaurus and titanosaur embryos. Dermal impressions are more widespread in the material of Tehuelchesaurus, where they are known from the areas of the forelimb, scapula and torso. There are no bony plates or nodules, to indicate armour, but there are several types of scales. Skin associated with the scapular blade is the largest, arranged in rosettes (spiral formations) with a smooth, hexagonal shape. These largest tubercles are , surrounded by smaller [...] scales.

2500|$|In {{matters of}} diplomacy, Elizabeth {{is known to}} be quite formal, and royal {{protocol}} is generally very strict. Though some of the traditional rules for dealing with the monarch have been relaxed during her reign (bowing is no longer required, for example, although it is still frequently performed), other forms of close personal interaction, such as touching, are discouraged by officials. At least six people are known to have broken this rule, the first being a woman named Alice Frazier, who hugged the Queen in 1991 when Elizabeth visited her residence in a government housing project in Washington, D.C. (accompanied by First Lady Barbara Bush and Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack Kemp). The second was Paul Keating, Prime Minister of Australia, when he was photographed with his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Queen in 1992. The third was Canadian cyclist Louis Garneau, who did the same thing ten years later when posing for a photograph with the Queen at Rideau Hall (her official residence in Canada). In 1997 during the Cabot 500 celebrations of Newfoundland and Labrador, the then Premier Brian Tobin placed an arm behind her while walking up a staircase. This was frowned upon in the press, but the Premier said that he placed his arm around her as an effort to help an elderly woman climb the stairs. In 2009, the Queen initiated an affectionate gesture with First Lady Michelle Obama at a palace reception she attended with President Obama. The Queen rested her hand briefly at the small of the First Lady's back, a gesture that Mrs Obama returned. It was remarked at the time as unprecedented and described afterwards by a palace spokeswoman as [...] "a mutual and spontaneous display of affection and appreciation between The Queen and Michelle Obama." ...|$|E
