40|$|A {{method for}} forming a carbon {{composite}} valve for internal combustion engines is discussed. The process includes {{the steps of}} braiding carbon fiber into a rope thereby forming a cylindrically shaped <b>valve</b> stem <b>portion</b> and continuing to braid said fiber while introducing into the braiding carbon fiber rope a carbon matrix plug having an outer surface in a net shape of a valve head thereby forming a <b>valve</b> head <b>portion.</b> The said carbon matrix plug acting as a mandrel over which said carbon fiber rope is braided, said carbon fiber rope and carbon matrix plug forming a <b>valve</b> head <b>portion</b> suitable for mating with a valve seat; cutting said braided carbon <b>valve</b> stem <b>portion</b> at one end to form a valve tip and cutting said braided carbon fiber after said <b>valve</b> head <b>portion</b> to form a valve face and thus provide a composite valve preform; and densifying said preform by embedding the braided carbon in a matrix of carbon to convert said <b>valve</b> stem <b>portion</b> to a <b>valve</b> stem and said <b>valve</b> head <b>portion</b> to a <b>valve</b> head thereby providing said composite valve...|$|R

5000|$|Short {{operational}} life. In {{the most}} common <b>applications,</b> <b>valves</b> have a working life {{of just a few}} thousand hours, much shorter than solid state parts. This is due various commonplace failure mechanisms: cathode depletion, open or shorts circuits—notably of the heater and grid structures, cathode poisoning, and physical breakage of the glass envelope. Heater failure most often happens due to the mechanical stress of a cold start. Only, in certain always-on professional applications such as specialized computing and undersea cables, specially designed valves in carefully designed circuits and well cooled environments reached operational lives of tens or hundreds of thousands of hours.|$|R

40|$|Railroad cars in coal {{service in}} the northeastern United States are often shopped for wheel defects such as slid flat, built up tread and spalling. Previous work found that these defects {{can be caused by}} wheel sliding after air {{pressure}} leaks through defective service and emergency brake <b>valve</b> <b>portions</b> into the brake cylinder. Another important factor in the creation of wheel defects from wheel sliding is the car’s empty braking ratio. If a car is excessively braked when empty, or has lost weight, there will be a greater chance for wheel sliding and damage. Wheel changeout data for different car classes were reviewed and several coal cars in the classes with the most wheel repairs were selected for detailed testing. The cars were given a complete air brake test, including a brake cylinder pressure test, and the brake system and wheels of each car was inspected. A static brake shoe force test was then conducted on each car {{in order to determine the}} current empty braking ratio, loaded braking ratio and hand braking ratio.
