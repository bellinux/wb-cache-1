50|$|Cloud-based file syncing {{and sharing}} {{services}} implement <b>automated</b> <b>file</b> transfers by updating files from a dedicated sharing directory on each user's networked devices.

It also supports multi-file batch processing, and a command line mode for <b>automated</b> <b>file</b> conversions. Some products {{available at the}} time of Switch's initial release only supported converting a single file in command-line mode, and Switch was designed to create a more streamlined approach to the audio format conversion process.|$|E
50|$|When {{the work}} evolves to a stage where it {{requires}} an external review or {{is ready to}} be pushed on to the next process, the user checks in his or her files. This check-in process hands files off to TACTIC, which acts as a gatekeeper to the repository where all the files are kept. TACTIC also acts as a librarian, sorting the files it receives into the appropriate location in the repository. If specified by the system, file names will also be renamed accordingly to make their locations more identifiable (a function cognate to card cataloguing). TACTIC's <b>automated</b> <b>file</b> management system ensures that files are uniformly named and appear in predictable and reliable locations, effectively eliminating human error in the repository.|$|E
50|$|A bombing {{occurred}} on the 8th floor on August 20, 1969, injuring 20 people. The bomb, which police estimated to {{be the equivalent of}} 25 sticks of dynamite, was placed in a hallway just off the elevators some time during the evening and it exploded at around 10:30PM. The injured were on the night shift in the bank's stock bookkeeping department and were working {{on the other side of}} the corridor wall. Fortunately, the inside of this wall was lined with floor-to-ceiling <b>automated</b> <b>file</b> units that weighed 3 tons each and which absorbed most of the blast. Without them, the 20 injuries would all have been fatalities. The blast moved the file units about a foot, blew out all the windows on that side of the building and opened a 5 ft hole in the reinforced concrete floor. The bomber, Sam Melville, was convicted of this and seven other 1969 Manhattan bombings and sentenced to 18 years in prison. He was killed by a state sharpshooter during the Attica Prison riots in September 1971.|$|E

40|$|This {{presentation}} will summarize {{work that}} has been done to prototype and analyze approaches for <b>automated</b> <b>file</b> transfer and storage management for space missions. The concepts were prototyped in an environment with data files being generated at the target mission rates and stored in onboard files. The space-to-ground link was implemented using a channel simulator to introduce representative mission delays and errors. The system was operated for days with data files building up on the spacecraft and periodically being transferred to ground storage during a limited contact time. Overall performance was measured to identify limits under which the entire data volume could be transferred automatically while still fitting into the mission s limited contact time. The overall concepts, measurements, and results will be presented...|$|E

40|$|A major {{advantage}} {{of information technology}} is the ease, speed and volume of information that may be shared between hosts. However, this {{has given rise to}} concerns over paedophile activity and the spread of malicious digital pictures amongst this community. In network forensic investigations a wealth of information relevant to the investigation will reside within the network itself and on disparate hosts. Current computer forensics tools are designed for the analysis of seized hard drives rather than investigating data within a network. In this paper we present FORWEB, a novel scheme for <b>automated</b> <b>file</b> fingerprinting of malicious pictures resident on Web servers. This approach may be used in forensic investigations to automatically identify repositories of malicious digital pictures on the Internet or to verify the Internet usage of a suspect. A case study and its results demonstrate the applicability of this approach...|$|E
40|$|The APD {{software}} features include: On-line help, Three level architecture, (Logic environments, Setup/Application environment, Data environment), Explanation capability, and File handling. The {{kinds of}} experimentation and record keeping {{that leads to}} effective expert systems is facilitated by: (1) a library of inferencing modules (in the logic environment); (2) an explanation capability which reveals logic strategies to users; (3) <b>automated</b> <b>file</b> naming conventions; (4) an information retrieval system; and (5) on-line help. These aid with effective use of knowledge, debugging and experimentation. Since the APD software anticipates the logical rules becoming complicated, it is embedded in a production system language (CLIPS) to insure the full power of the production system paradigm of CLIPS and availability of the procedural language C. The development is discussed of the APD software and three example applications: toy, experimental, and operational prototype for submarine maintenance predictions...|$|E
40|$|The Standard Autonomous File Server (SAFS), which {{includes}} both off-the-shelf hardware and software, uses an improved <b>automated</b> <b>file</b> transfer process {{to provide a}} quicker, more reliable, prioritized file distribution for customers of near real-time data without interfering with the assets involved in the acquisition and processing of the data.

This paper describes the unique problems and lessons learned both during the COTS selection and integration into SAFS, and the system's first year of operation in support of NASA's satellite ground network. COTS was the key factor in allowing the two-person development team to deploy systems {{in less than a}} year, meeting the required launch schedule.

40|$|A major {{challenge}} in digital forensics is {{the handling of}} very large amounts of data. Since forensic investigators often have to analyze several terabytes of data in a single case, efficient and effective tools for automatic data identification and filtering are required. A common data identification technique is to match the cryptographic hashes of files with hashes stored in blacklists and whitelists {{in order to identify}} contraband and harmless content, respectively. However, blacklists and whitelists are never complete and they miss most of the files encountered in investigations. Also, cryptographic hash matching fails when file content is altered even very slightly. This paper analyzes several distributed systems for their ability to support file content identification. A framework is presented for <b>automated</b> <b>file</b> content identification that searches for file hashes and collects, aggregates and presents the search results. Experiments demonstrate that the framework can provide identifying information for 26 % of the test files from their hashed content, helping reduce the workload of forensic investigators...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} service for {{locating}} and retrieving files from an untrusted network {{such that the}} integrity of the retrieved files can be verified. This service enables groups of people in geographically remote locations to share files using an untrusted network. For example, distribution of an organization's software to all the organization 's sites can be accomplished using this service. Distribution of files in an untrusted network is complicated by two issues: (1) location of files and (2) verification of file integrity. ftp and World-wide Web (WWW) services require some user intervention to locate a file, so they cannot be embedded in automated systems. Distributed systems have mechanisms for <b>automated</b> <b>file</b> location and retrieval, but they require trust in all system principals and do not provide an appropriate balance between availability of files and retrieval cost for our applications. Verification of the integrity of a file retrieved from an untrusted network is necessary because [...] ...|$|E
