2500|$|Tsar Nicholas II, {{the last}} Emperor of Russia, {{reported}} witnessing {{what he called}} [...] "a fiery ball" [...] while {{in the company of}} his grandfather, Tsar Alexander II: [...] "Once my parents were away," [...] recounted the Tsar, [...] "and I was at the all-night vigil with my grandfather in the small church in Alexandria. During the service there was a powerful thunderstorm, streaks of lightning flashed one after the other, and {{it seemed as if the}} peals of thunder would shake even the church and the whole world to its foundations. Suddenly it became quite dark, a blast of wind from the open door blew out the flame of the candles which were lit in front of the iconostasis, there was a long clap of thunder, louder than before, and I suddenly saw a fiery ball flying from the window straight towards the head of the Emperor. The ball (it was of lightning) whirled around the floor, then passed the chandelier and flew out through the door into the park. My heart froze, I glanced at my grandfather– his face was completely calm. He crossed himself just as calmly as he had when the fiery ball had flown near us, and I felt that it was unseemly and not courageous to be frightened as I was. I felt that one had only to look at what was happening and believe in the mercy of God, as he, my grandfather, did. After the ball had passed through the whole church, and suddenly gone out through the door, I again looked at my grandfather. A faint smile was on his face, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> his head at me. My panic disappeared, and from that time I had no more fear of storms." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{expressed}} my admiration to Poirot, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> thoughtfully.|$|E
60|$|She saw {{the light}} in his eyes fix determinedly, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>nodded.</b>|$|E
60|$|Dane {{could draw}} the {{intended}} inference, <b>and</b> when <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> Amadu appeared satisfied.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good morning," [...] {{says the}} Policeman {{tramping}} the pavement {{in front of}} the Great Eastern, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>nods</b> his head pleasantly to show that he is the representative of Law and Peace and that the city of Calcutta is safe from itself for the present.|$|R
60|$|Evan {{gazed at}} the garden wall, gravely {{for more than a}} minute, <b>and</b> then <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> without a word.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} Wheeler, who sat near {{the lower end}} of the table, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>nodded.</b>|$|E
60|$|Then I leaned forward, {{whispering}} {{into the}} ear of the Black One, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> heavily.|$|E
60|$|An {{expression}} of interest had come over Ezra's face, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> {{to show that he}} was listening.|$|E
50|$|The episode {{starts with}} Harper (Sterling Sulieman), the vampire who {{got out of}} the tomb attacking a hiker and then {{stealing}} his clothes. He gets out of the woods and gets to the town looking lost in the modern world. He sees a woman sitting on a bench who <b>nods</b> to him <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>nods</b> back.|$|R
60|$|Her breast {{filled and}} rose, {{and her eyes}} shone with a light unashamed <b>and</b> proud. <b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> in token that he was answered.|$|R
60|$|Captain Graffenreid understood: {{the sounds}} were musketry <b>and</b> artillery. <b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> tried to smile. There was {{apparently}} nothing infectious in the smile.|$|R
60|$|Deacon {{could not}} speak. His throat lumped <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> {{his head as}} he reached for the cards.|$|E
60|$|It was an {{hour later}} when Grant and several {{horsemen}} arrived, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> as {{he glanced at the}} prisoner.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>nodded.</b> Her {{eyes and}} lips smiled at him; {{she opened the}} door, and, still with that slow, happy smile, went out....|$|E
60|$|Noggs nodded; <b>and</b> as <b>he</b> <b>nodded,</b> {{there came}} a ring at the office bell. The master {{looked up from his}} papers, and the clerk calmly {{remained}} in a stationary position.|$|R
60|$|Men stood forward, {{and having}} saluted, {{one by one}} asked this thing or that. The king heard their requests, <b>and</b> as <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> or turned his head away, so they were granted or refused.|$|R
60|$|Cyril never {{argued with}} his father, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> simply <b>nodded</b> an assent {{and then asked}} some {{question}} that turned Sir Aubrey's thoughts on other matters.|$|R
6000|$|He {{finished}} by whispering into Arnold Baxter's ear. At once the rascal's face brightened, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>nodded.</b> [...] "Just the thing!" [...] he muttered.|$|E
6000|$|... 'But {{it is all}} right,' said Cherry, looking {{with quiet}} {{certainty}} into her brother's face; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> and coloured at the same time.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Who do {{you think}} we’ve ’ad ’ere, sir?’ he began breathlessly, as the chaise drove off. ‘Red Breasts’; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> his head portentously.|$|E
6000|$|After {{the bottom}} of the large can had been scraped, and pipes lit at the coals, two of the men called Boston aside and spake with him lowly <b>and</b> mysteriously. <b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> decisively, <b>and</b> then said aloud to Whistling Dick: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah is it so? Well, senor, {{then you}} will look in vain yonder,' <b>and</b> again <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> towards the physician's house. 'Such as he will take no {{apprentice}} without the fee be large indeed; {{it is not the}} custom of this city.' ...|$|R
60|$|All {{this and}} more Mme. de Pompadour's nod {{conveyed}} {{to the mind}} of Louis the Well-beloved, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> too <b>nodded</b> in response before he continued, speaking now more casually, in a calmer, more business-like tone.|$|R
60|$|For {{the first}} time Lord Arranmore smiled. He poured out with steady hand yet another glass of wine, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> towards the door.|$|E
60|$|There was {{no doubt}} on that point when he dropped on one knee beside the man, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> as {{he glanced at the}} trooper.|$|E
6000|$|... "Who do {{you think}} we've 'ad 'ere, sir?" [...] he began breathlessly, as the chaise drove off. [...] "Red Breasts"; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> his head portentously.|$|E
6000|$|Throughout {{all this}} my lord {{was like a}} cold, kind spectator with his wits about him. At the first cry, which was indeed enough to call the house about us, he {{had said to me}} over his shoulder, [...] "Close the door." [...] <b>And</b> now <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> to himself.|$|R
60|$|Lilly rose {{softly and}} went {{across to the}} fire. He had to cross a landing {{to a sort of}} little lavatory, with a sink and a tap, for water. The clerks peeped out at him from an {{adjoining}} office <b>and</b> <b>nodded.</b> <b>He</b> <b>nodded,</b> <b>and</b> disappeared from their sight as quickly as possible, with his kettle. His dark eyes were quick, his dark hair was untidy, there was something silent and withheld about him. People could never approach him quite ordinarily.|$|R
50|$|After {{taking charge}} of Ministry of Environment <b>and</b> Forests <b>he</b> gave <b>nod</b> to many polluting {{industries}} in ecological sensitive areas.|$|R
60|$|The deputies {{were very}} thirsty. The {{perspiration}} was streaming down French's forehead. They {{all looked at}} one another. Laura whispered in French's ear <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>nodded.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "None, {{except that}} there are great {{preparations}} going on yonder," [...] <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> towards the temple; [...] "also a mob is howling at the gates." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I am an ugly {{old black}} dog, Baas, {{and can be}} of no further use to you out yonder," [...] <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> towards the sea.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] {{the doctor}} said, [...] "will you all {{leave the room}} except Miss Hardy <b>and</b> you?" [...] <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> to Mrs. Holl. As the {{servants}} retired reluctantly, the butler said-- ...|$|R
60|$|The {{books were}} {{circulated}} throughout the world, {{and some of}} them reached the Emperor. He sat in his golden chair, and read <b>and</b> read. <b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> his head every moment, for he liked reading the brilliant accounts of the town, the Palace, and the garden. 'But the Nightingale is better than all,' he saw written.|$|R
60|$|Elizabeth saw {{her friend}} depart for Port-Bredy, and {{took charge of}} High-Place Hall till her return. After {{two or three days}} of {{solitude}} and incessant rain Henchard called at the house. He seemed disappointed to hear of Lucetta's absence <b>and</b> though <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> with outward indifference he went away handling his beard with a nettled mien.|$|R
