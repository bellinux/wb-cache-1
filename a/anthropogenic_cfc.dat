40|$|International audienceMixing {{ratios of}} water (H 2 O) in the {{stratosphere}} appear to increase due to increased input of H 2 O and methane (CH 4) from the troposphere and due to intensified oxidation of CH 4 {{in the stratosphere}}, but the underlying mechanisms are not yet understood. Here we identify and quantify three chemical mechanisms which must have led to more efficient oxidation of CH 4 {{over the past several}} decades: 1) The increase in stratospheric chlorine levels due to <b>anthropogenic</b> <b>CFC</b> emissions, 2) the thinning of the stratospheric ozone column and 3) enhanced OH levels in the stratosphere due to increasing H 2 O levels themselves. In combination with the increase in tropospheric CH 4 mixing ratios and with solar cycle related variations of upper stratospheric ozone, these effects can explain about 50 % of the additional conversion of CH 4 to H 2 O as observed throughout the stratosphere. The relative contributions from the individual processes have varied over the past decades...|$|E

40|$|The {{depletion}} {{of the ozone layer}} is caused mainly by the increase in emissions of chlorine- and bromine-containing compounds like CFCs, halons, carbon tetrachloride, methyl chloroform and methyl bromide. Emissions of greenhouse gases can affect the {{depletion of}} the ozone layer through atmospheric interaction. We studied the interactions in the atmosphere between the greenhouse effect and stratospheric ozone depletion {{from the point of view}} of past and future emissions of the <b>anthropogenic</b> compounds: <b>CFCs,</b> halons, CH 4, N 2 O, NOx, CO and CO 2. In our investigation the increase in emissions of chlorine- and bromine-containing compounds, largely responsible for the depletion of stratospheric ozone at mid-latitudes, was found to be - 5. 8 % per decade from 1980 to 1990. The increase in CH 4 emissions in the same period changes this ozone depletion by + 1. 4 % per decade to - 4. 4 % per decade, which is close to TOMS and Dobson measurements. The increase in N 2 O emissions hardly affects this depletion. The decrease in stratospheric temperatures due to increased CO 2 emissions also diminishes the ozone depletion; the same may also happen when NOx emissions are increased. The effect of these interactions in coming decades is to accelerate the recovery of the ozone layer. The trend in CH 4 emissions described in the business-as-usual scenario IS 92 a may yield 1980 ozone column levels in 2060 compared with 2080 with CH 4 emissions fixed at 1990 levels. The temperature decrease in the stratosphere may initially also accelerate the recovery of the ozone layer by several years, ignoring a possible large extra ozone depletion by the extra formation of polar stratospheric clouds over large areas of the world...|$|R
30|$|Although the {{processes}} that can affect the interpretation of CFCs age have been investigated and quantified to some extent, dominated processes are still unclear at the site. The reliable interpretation of groundwater age by CFCs depends on the available information that can help characterize the geochemical and hydrological environment in field. In general, the concentrations of CFCs can be affected by recharge temperature, recharge elevation, thickness of unsaturated zone (> 10  m), urban air, contamination, microbial degradation, adsorption or diffusion in groundwater, groundwater mixtures and hydrodynamic dispersion in the aquifers (Plummer and Busenberg 2000). Depending on whether the recharge temperature, excess air and recharge elevation is underestimated or overestimated, the resulting apparent age can be biased either young or old. The addition of <b>anthropogenic</b> sources of <b>CFCs,</b> concentrations greater than that expected for equilibrium with regional air composition, leads to a young bias in apparent age. Processes that remove CFCs or lower their concentration in groundwater, such as microbial degradation, sorption, mixing with old water, thickness of unsaturated zone (> 10  m), matrix diffusion and some cases of hydrodynamic dispersion, can lead to an old bias in the apparent age (Plummer and Busenberg 2000).|$|R
40|$|International audienceGroundwater residence-time or ages {{have been}} widely used in {{hydrogeology}} during the last decades. Followingtritium measurements, <b>anthropogenic</b> gases (<b>CFC,</b> SF 6, 35 Kr) have been developed. They provide informationat the aquifer scale on long residence times. They complement the more localized data obtained from sparseboreholes with hydraulic and geophysical methods. Anthropogenic tracer concentrations are most generally considered as “Groundwater ages” using a pistonflow model providing an order of magnitude for the residence time. More advanced information can however bederived from the combined analysis of the tracer concentrations. For example, the residence time distribution overthe last 50 years can be well approached by the concentration of two sufficient different anthropogenic tracersin the group (CFC, SF 6, 35 Kr), i. e. tracers whose anthropogenic chronicles are sufficiently different. And, withadditional constrains on geological and hydraulic properties, groundwater ages contribute to characterize theaquifer structures and the groundwater resources. Complex geological environments also include old groundwater bodies in extremely confined aquifer sections. In such cases, various tracers are related to highly different processes. CFCs can be taken as a markerof modern contamination to track exchanges between shallower and deeper aquifers, leakage processes, andmodification of circulations linked to recent anthropogenic changes. 14 C or 36 Cl can be used to evidence mucholder processes but have {{to be related to the}} history of the chemical element itself. Numerous field studies in factdemonstrate the broad-range extent of the residence time distribution spanning in some cases several orders ofmagnitude. Flow and transport models in heterogeneous structures confirm such wide residence times and help tocharacterize their distribution. Residence times also serve as a privileged interface to the fate of some contaminants in aquifers or to tracegeochemical processes. Among others, it is the case of (i) slow geochemical processes effective at large residencetimes such as silicate dissolution, (ii) biogeochemical reactivity activated by some modification of the flowstructure, (iii) interactions between microbial diversity and biogeochemical reactivity. While first-order kinetics iscommonly assumed, more advanced relations are developed between the nutrient and energy supply. O 2 and NO 3 nutrient relate to recharge processes on the one hand and Fe and S relate to dissolution in reducing environmentson the other hand.

40|$|International audienceFollowing the {{explosion}} of reactor 4 at the Chernobyl power plant in northern Ukraine in 1986, contaminated soil and vegetation were buried in shallow trenches dug directly on-site in an Aeolian sand deposit. These trenches are sources of radionuclide (RN) pollution. The objective {{of the present study}} is to provide constraints for the Chernobyl flow and RN transport models by characterising groundwater residence time. A radiochronometer 3 H/ 3 He method (t 1 / 2 = 12. 3 a) and <b>anthropogenic</b> tracers including <b>CFC</b> and SF 6 are investigated along with the water mass natural tracers Na, Cl, 18 O and 2 H. The groundwater is stratified, as evidenced by Na and Cl concentrations and stable isotopes (18 O, 2 H). In the upper aeolian layer, the Na-Cl relationship corresponds to evapotranspiration of precipitation, while in the underlying alluvial layer, an increase in Na and Cl with depth suggests both water-rock interactions and mixing processes. The 3 H/ 3 He and CFC apparent groundwater ages increase with depth, ranging from 'recent' (1 - 3 a) at a 2 m depth below the groundwater table to much higher apparent ages of 50 - 60 a at 27 m depth below the groundwater table. Discrepancies in 3 H/ 3 He and CFC apparent ages (20 - 25 a and 3 - 10 a, respectively) were observed during the 2008 campaign at an intermediate depth immediately below the aeolian/alluvial sand limit, which were attributed to the complex water transfer processes. Extremely high SF 6 concentrations, well above equilibrium with the atmosphere and up to 1112 pptv, are attributed to significant contamination of the soils following the nuclear reactor explosion in 1986. The SF 6 concentration vs. the apparent groundwater ages agrees with this interpretation, as the high SF 6 concentrations are all more recent than 1985. The persistence of the SF 6 concentration suggests that SF 6 was introduced in the soil atmosphere and slowly integrated in the groundwater moving along the hydraulic gradient. The apparent age distribution in the lumped parameter models suggests an exponential or piston flow model in the upper geological section, followed by more pronounced mixing processes in the lower section...|$|R
