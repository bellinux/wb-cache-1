5|$|Free flight {{lasted for}} 10 hours and 29 minutes and was {{followed}} by another 41 hours of bumpy ride with frequent ground contact before the inevitable final crash. The Eagle traveled for 2 days and 3½ hours altogether, during which time, according to Andrée, {{none of the three}} men got <b>any</b> <b>sleep.</b> The definitive landing appears to have been gentle. Neither the men nor the homing pigeons in their wicker cages were hurt, and none of the equipment was damaged, not even the delicate optical instruments and Strindberg's two cameras.|$|E
5|$|Prose follows {{after this}} stanza, stating that a burial-mound {{was made for}} Helgi, and that when Helgi arrived in Valhalla, he was asked by Odin to manage things with him. In stanza 39, Helgi, now in Valhalla, has his former enemy Hunding—also in Valhalla—do menial tasks; {{fetching}} foot-baths {{for all of the}} men there, kindling fire, tying dogs, keeping watch of horses, and feeding the pigs before he can get <b>any</b> <b>sleep.</b> In stanzas 40 to 42, Helgi has returned to Midgard from Valhalla with a host of men. An unnamed maid of Sigrún, Helgi's valkyrie wife, sees Helgi and his large host of men riding into the mound. The maid asks if she is experiencing a delusion, if Ragnarök has begun, or if Helgi and his men have been allowed to return.|$|E
5|$|The {{first series}} begins {{nine months after}} the pilot episode. After Pete and Jenny's baby is born in Episode 1, the couple {{have a hard time}} getting <b>any</b> <b>sleep.</b> Pete has to cope with {{the death of his father}} in Episode 4. Adam and Rachel decide to rent a house together. He is horrified to {{discover}} in Episode 2 that she is married to another man. While he is staying with Pete and Jenny, Rachel has sex with her visiting husband (Lennie James)—who leaves soon after—and is pregnant by Episode 6. Just as hers and Adam's relationship is recovering, she tells him that he might not be the father, and that she is moving to London until the birth. Karen and David have recently hired Ramona as a nanny to their young son Josh. At her publishing job, Karen edits the novel of a renowned author (Denis Lawson), whom she becomes attracted to. She plans to sleep with him on a book tour but is humiliated when she finds out he is not attracted to her. David tries to sleep with Ramona to get back at Karen, which causes friction between the couple. They seek guidance counselling to repair their marriage.|$|E

However, it is common in chronic fatigued patients, and may amplify the effects of other sleep disorders.|$|R

60|$|You {{descend into}} some of the streets by long, deep stairways; and in the strong moonlight, last night, these were very picturesque. I did wish you were here to see these things. You couldn't by <b>any</b> {{possibility}} <b>sleep</b> in these beds, though, or enjoy the food.|$|R
25|$|Park also notched up {{some fine}} {{performances}} for Victoria, and soon earned a Test call-up in the 1920–1921 season. He was unsuccessful in his debut against England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), making a first-ball duck in his only innings, and bowling a single over of off-spinners which went for nine runs. He {{was said to}} have been called late during the night for medical duties, and not to have got <b>any</b> <b>sleep</b> before his debut. He never played Test cricket again. Legend has it that his wife, who was watching in the stands, dropped her knitting as he prepared to face his first ball, bent down to retrieve it at the moment of delivery, and thus missed his entire Test career.|$|E
25|$|A {{qualified}} sleep specialist {{should be}} consulted for {{the diagnosis of}} <b>any</b> <b>sleep</b> disorder so the appropriate measures can be taken. Past medical history and a physical examination {{need to be done}} to eliminate other conditions that could be the cause of insomnia. After all other conditions are ruled out a comprehensive sleep history should be taken. The sleep history should include sleep habits, medications (prescription and non-prescription), alcohol consumption, nicotine and caffeine intake, co-morbid illnesses, and sleep environment. A sleep diary can be used {{to keep track of the}} individual's sleep patterns. The diary should include time to bed, total sleep time, time to sleep onset, number of awakenings, use of medications, time of awakening and subjective feelings in the morning. The sleep diary can be replaced or validated by the use of out-patient actigraphy for a week or more, using a non-invasive device that measures movement.|$|E
500|$|Filming in Las Vegas {{took place}} mostly in hotels owned by Howard Hughes, {{since he was}} a friend of Cubby Broccoli. Getting the streets empty to shoot was {{achieved}} through the collaboration of Hughes, the Las Vegas police and shopkeepers association. The Las Vegas Hilton doubled for the Whyte House, and since the owner of the Circus Circus was a Bond fan, he allowed the Circus to be used on film and even made a cameo. The cinematographers said filming in Las Vegas at night had an advantage: no additional illumination was required due to the high number of neon lights. Sean Connery made the most of his time on location in Las Vegas. [...] "I didn't get <b>any</b> <b>sleep</b> at all. We shot every night, I caught all the shows and played golf all day. On the weekend I collapsed – boy, did I collapse. Like a skull with legs." [...] He also played the slot machines, and once delayed a scene because he was collecting his winnings.|$|E
5000|$|Sleep: Most {{people think}} they can sleep enough to get by, but few realize it is {{regulated}} and required by the brain at <b>any</b> cost. <b>Sleep</b> patterns and habits can be modified and manipulated to better fit our needs, but sleep and wake are in a delicate balance.|$|R

500|$|Mugford {{said she}} had spent the weekend before the murders with Bamber in his cottage in Goldhanger, where he had dyed his hair black. She had seen his mother's bicycle there, she said; the {{prosecution}} later alleged that he had used this bicycle to cycle between his cottage and the farmhouse {{on the night of}} the murders, to avoid being seen in his car on the road. She told police Bamber had telephoned her at 9:50pm on 6 August to say he had been thinking about the crime all day, was [...] "pissed off", and that it was [...] "tonight or never". A few hours later, at 3:00–3:30am on 7 August, she said he phoned her again to say: [...] "Everything is going well. Something is wrong at the farm. I haven't had <b>any</b> <b>sleep</b> all night... bye honey and I love you lots." [...] Her flatmates' evidence suggested that call had come through closer to 3:00am. He called her later in the morning to tell her that Sheila had gone mad, and that a police car was coming to pick her up. When she arrived with the police at Bamber's cottage, she said he had pulled her to one side and said: [...] "I should have been an actor." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 2009, he {{appealed to}} party activists for £150,000 of extra {{funding for the}} BNP. In the letter, {{he said that the}} party's ailing {{fortunes}} were a direct result of [...] "attacks on the party". He also defended questions by the Electoral Commission about the transparency of BNP funding. In November 2009, Griffin was a witness at the trial of an Asian man, Tauriq Khalid, at Preston Crown Court. The prosecution claimed that in November 2008 Khalid repeatedly drove past a demonstration that Griffin was attending, and on the second occasion shouted [...] "white bastards". Khalid admitted shouting derisory comments at Griffin and other demonstrators, telling the jury he shouted [...] "Nick Griffin, you fucking wanker" [...] and [...] "Get the fuck out of Burnley, you're not welcome here", but denied shouting [...] "white bastard". Griffin gave evidence against Khalid, and affirmed that Khalid had shouted [...] "white bastard" [...] at him. Griffin said the man [...] "leaned {{out of the car and}} pointed at me and made a gun and gang gesture", and that he threatened him by shouting [...] "I'm going to...". Griffin said he had left the demonstration early, fearing for his safety. The 23-year-old defendant denied his comments had any racial intent, and was found not guilty. Griffin later commented [...] "I think it's unfortunate and I think it's wrong, but that's the jury's right. They saw all the evidence, I accept their decision. I'm not going to lose <b>any</b> <b>sleep</b> over it." ...|$|E

They found her that evening and made several torpedo attacks {{in the evening and}} into the next morning. No hits were scored but they kept her gunners from getting <b>any</b> <b>sleep,</b> making it easier for the battleships to attack her the next morning. Maori then rescued some of the survivors from Bismarck after the battleship sank.|$|E

60|$|Harris said he didn’t think George {{ought to}} do {{anything}} that would have a tendency to make him sleepier than he always was, as it might be dangerous. He said he didn’t very well understand how George was going to <b>sleep</b> <b>any</b> more than he did now, seeing that there were only twenty-four hours in each day, summer and winter alike; but thought that if he did <b>sleep</b> <b>any</b> more, he might just as well be dead, and so save his board and lodging.|$|R
50|$|Patients {{are advised}} to {{maintain}} a normal sleep schedule, avoid sleep deprivation, and keep track of any sleepiness they may have. Treatment includes regulating neurologic symptoms and treating <b>any</b> other <b>sleep</b> disorders that might interfere with sleep. Sleep deprivation, alcohol, certain medications, and other sleep disorders can all increase RBD and should be avoided if possible.|$|R
2500|$|Moriarty {{is highly}} ruthless, shown by his steadfast vow to Sherlock Holmes that [...] "if you are clever {{enough to bring}} {{destruction}} upon me, rest assured that I shall do as much to you". Moriarty is categorised by Holmes as an extremely powerful criminal mastermind who is purely adept at committing any atrocity to perfection without losing <b>any</b> <b>sleep</b> over it. It is stated in The Final Problem that Moriarty does not directly participate in the activities he plans, but only orchestrates the events. As Holmes states below, what makes Moriarty so dangerous is his extremely cunning intellect: ...|$|E

50|$|Moore {{explained}} on {{his blog}} {{that the number}} 33 had no hidden meaning or significance, only that he felt it sufficiently long to allow minor functions like snacking, showering, or cat napping, but was too short to allow anybody to gain <b>any</b> meaningful <b>sleep</b> and recharge their batteries. Further, Moore intentionally gave the number no meaning to avoid creating and inserting unnecessary technobabble into a drama-driven episode.|$|R
50|$|A {{physician}} {{specializing in}} sleep medicine may ask patients about their medical history; for example: neurological problems, prescription or non-prescription medications taken, alcohol use, family history, and <b>any</b> other <b>sleep</b> problems. A thorough medical and neurological exam is indicated. The patient {{will be asked}} to complete a sleep diary, recording natural sleep and wake up times, over several weeks. Sleep rating with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale may be used.|$|R
60|$|Thus, methinks, every drowsy nod shakes their doctrine, {{who teach}} that {{the soul is}} always thinking.
