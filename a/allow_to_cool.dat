Transfer the mixture to a pan and gently heat. Do not let the mixture heat too quickly. Before the mixture comes to the boil remove from the heat, the mixture should be foaming on top. Remove the four cloves. Serve hot and foamy in a mug with optionally whipped cream on top and a ginger biscuit.

40|$|Optomechanical {{interactions}} in high-finesse cavities offer a new promising route for the ongoing experimental efforts {{to achieve and}} to control the quantum regime of massive mechanical systems using the available toolbox of quantum optics. For example, they <b>allow</b> <b>to</b> <b>cool</b> mechanical degrees of freedom of movable mirrors via radiation-pressure backaction, in principle even into their quantum ground state. Ground-state cooling will eventually require to realize the scheme in a cryogenic environment. We have taken this next step and realized stable operation of a high-finesse cavity inside a 4 He cryostat [1]. This allowed us to show radiation-pressure laser cooling of a micro-mechanical kHz resonator from a base temperature of 5 K to approximately 1. 3 mK, which corresponds to a thermal occupation factor of = 32 ± 4 [2]. Heating effects, e. g. due to absorption of photons in the micromirror, could not be observed. The cooling performance is only limited by the thermal coupling to the environment, which can be further reduced by improving the mechanical quality factor of the mechanical resonator and by further reducing the environmental temperature. We will discuss the relevance ofthese results for the preparation and control ofmechanical quantum states...|$|E

40|$|Authors: James Cronk, Noel Derecki & Jonathan Kipnis ### Abstract This {{protocol}} {{describes how}} to measure neuron soma size by fluorescent Nissl stain. Mice are sacrificed, and fixed by PFA perfusion. Brains are removed, and further PFA fixed, followed by sucrose cryoprotection. They are then snap frozen, sliced by cryostat, and stained with fluorescent Nissl as floating sections. Confocal microscopy is used to take images of neurons, and a computer graphics tablet {{is used to calculate}} individual neuron soma sizes. ### Reagents 1. 5 u/ml Heparin PBS - 4 % PFA in PBS - 30 % Sucrose in PBS - 0. 1 % Sodium Azide in PBS - 2 -methylbutane - Dry ice - OCT Compound - 0. 1 % Triton X- 100 in PBS - PBS - Neurotrace Fluorescent Nissl Stain (Molecular Probes) - Scintillation vials - Glass slides - Coverslips - Aqueous mounting medium ### Equipment 1. 24 well plates - Cryostat - Confocal microscope - Computer graphics tablet ### Procedure 1. Sacrifice mouse - Transcardially perfuse with 50 ml of 5 u/ml heparin PBS, followed by at least 50 ml of 4 % PFA in PBS, until the limbs and neck are difficult to move. - Remove brain from skull, and place in a scintillation vial filled with 4 % PFA in PBS. - Incubate for 2 days on a shaker at 4 C. - Remove the 4 % PFA in PBS, and replace with 30 % sucrose in PBS. The brain should now be floating; incubate at 4 C until the brain sinks {{to the bottom of the}} scintillation vial, indicating it has been permeated by sucrose and is now cryoprotected. - Place a small beaker filled with 2 -methylbutane in a bed of dry ice, and <b>allow</b> <b>to</b> <b>cool</b> for 15 - 20 min. - Using forceps, drop the fixed, cryoprotected brain into the 2 -methylbutane. - Freeze for 2 min. - Remove the brain with forceps, and either save for later use by wrapping in foil and storing at - 80 C, or immediately prepare for cryosectioning. - To prepare for cryosectioning, mount the brain in a plastic mold on a cryostat chuck with OCT compound. Freeze the brain in OCT compound at - 80 C, and then equilibrate the mounted brain on the chuck to - 20 C inside the cryostat. - Slice the brain into 20 um sections, and store the sections in 0. 1 % sodium azide in PBS at 4 C until use. Sections should be used as soon as possible when stored by this method. - When ready to perform the Nissl stain, start by incubating the sections in 0. 1 % Triton X- 100 PBS in 24 well plates for 10 min at RT to permeabilize the tissue. All incubations and washes should be done on a shaker to ensure even exposure of the tissue. - Wash 2 x in PBS for 5 min each at RT. - Incubate in Neurotrace Fluorescent Nissl Stain diluted in PBS for 20 min at RT. The exact dilution should be titrated individually depending on your tissue and which fluorophore you select for the Nissl stain. Suggested dilutions are given in the product manual. A 1 : 40 diltion of Neurotrace Fluorescent Nissl Stain 530 / 615 Red in PBS works well in our hands. - Incubate in 0. 1 % Triton X- 100 PBS for 10 min RT. - Wash 2 x in PBS for 5 min each at RT. - Mount sections onto glass slides with aqueous mounting medium. - Allow mounting medium to harden. - Image your neurons of interest using a confocal microscope. - Using Image J and a computer graphics tablet, outline the neurons with the freehand tool and measure their area using the “Measure and Label” command. This will mark already measured neurons to prevent double measurements. ### Timing - Tissue preparation: 3 - 4 days - Nissl stain: 1. 5 hours - Microscopy and analysis: variable ### Anticipated Results This protocol should provide the user with accurate neuron soma sizes for statistical analysis. ### Associated Publications **Wild-type microglia arrest pathology in a mouse model of Rett syndrome**.
