The residents of Majd al-Krum, refusing to abide by the leadership of a Deir al-Asad man, boycotted the new local government, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> area consequently is at an economic and social disadvantage relative to the other neighborhoods that make up Shaghur.|$|E

Bombs were dropped on Luton and elsewhere, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> aircraft was seen from the main de Havilland offices and factory at Hatfield. An attempt to intercept it with a Spitfire from RAF Manston was unsuccessful.

Garcia, who previously starred as Hugo [...] "Hurley" [...] Reyes from J.J. Abrams' Lost, appears as a Massive Dynamic guard that is smoking a bong with Walter {{at the start of}} the episode. Alan Ruck guests as Dr. Crick, the person behind the floating bodies. Ruck was approached by the show's producers having envisioned him for the role. Ruck described the character, [...] "He is no dummy... and he stumbled on to something and he is trying to figure out a way to use it. Ultimately he would like to use it for good, but in so doing he causes a lot of damage. So I guess you can say he's obsessed. <b>And</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> point in time where the episode of Fringe starts, time is fleeting and he's just... under the gun."

500|$|Dale's {{death was}} adulated by commentators, who affirmed {{that it was}} a gruesome and {{emotional}} scene. Scott Meslow of The Atlantic suggested that because of his death, The Walking Dead embraced a more dark and sinister philosophy. He asserted, [...] "Taken broadly, his death marks the death of a certain morality on the show, and the embrace of a philosophy that's something crueler and darker. Dale, unlike any of the other survivors, maintained his humanity to the very end of his waking life—but even he couldn't choose not to come back as something amoral and inhuman. In a world that seems utterly incapable of getting better, it's a none-too-reassuring sign that things will almost certainly get worse." [...] Gina McIntyre of Los Angeles Times echoed synonymous thoughts: [...] "It's left to Daryl to shoot the man to end his suffering, which is profoundly too bad. Without Dale to raise all those nagging concerns about doing what's right, zombie apocalypse or no zombie apocalypse, I fear for the future of this walker-infested world." [...] Handlen and Calgary Herald Kimberly Potts thought {{that it was a}}mong the shocking moments in the series, while Friedman expressed that she was [...] "riveted by the awesome attack [...] and filled with sadness, as the original gang watched their friend die a slow and painful death". Handlen remarked: [...] "It’s a shocking scene, partially for its straight-forward gore, and partially for the astonished, uncomprehending expression on Dale’s face. [...] This, right here, is the kind of sequence the show needs. There’s too little sense of danger right now." [...] Verne Gay of Newsday described the sequence as [...] "violent", and ultimately summated that DeMunn's absence will be felt as the show progresses. However, Lamar professed that the writers should have written off Dale in a more respectable way; [...] "That wasn't the way to off the show's most annoyingly sane character. Dale's redeeming quality was his ability to guilt everybody into paying lip service to rule of law; his weakness was his naïveté. Having an escaping Randall kill him would've offered some poetic symmetry. I'm not going to miss this character, but he deserved a better send-off." [...] Time journalist Nate Rawlings drew allusions from Dale's attack to the episode title, commenting that [...] "when the lone zombie we see in this episode tears open Dale’s stomach, spilling the contents of his body onto the cold ground, we’re reminded that the walkers are the judges, they’re the jury, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> one was a most brutal executioner." [...] Although he was shocked by the sequence, Goldman assailed the earlier development of Dale in the episode, opining that he was obnoxious.|$|E

2500|$|After Disney's {{acquisition}} of Marvel Entertainment in 2009, CEO Bob Iger encouraged the company's divisions to explore Marvel's properties for adaptation concepts.

While directing Winnie the Pooh, director Don Hall was scrolling through a Marvel database when he stumbled upon Big Hero 6, a comic he had never heard of before.

These were major steps forward, because in the initial Heckle and Jeckle for Terrytoons, they were two black guys running around.
