When considering why this service was so popular, Mack noted that consumers usually feel more confident in a purchase when there are few unknowns. At the time, selling products over the Internet was not a popular concept outside the United States, but Mack was confident in expanding GoodHome.com's portfolio to include foreign companies: [...] "We're <b>already</b> <b>getting</b> so many requests from companies about expanding our website abroad...

500|$|The {{album was}} preceded by [...] "No Reflection", which was leaked by Manson to KROQ-FM on March 7, 2012. Cooking Vinyl CEO Martin Goldschmidt called the leak a [...] "masterstroke", saying [...] "we had all these exclusives lined up around the world, and then Manson blew them all. [...] We're <b>already</b> <b>getting</b> more radio play than {{the whole of the}} last record." [...] The song spent {{fourteen}} weeks on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Chart, peaking at number twenty-six, making it the band's best-performing single there since [...] "Personal Jesus" [...] in 2004. Its music video, which was directed by Lukas Ettlin and starred Roxane Mesquida of Rubber, premiered on April 4 on VEVO. On Record Store Day, a limited edition 7" [...] white vinyl for the song was released exclusively in Europe.|$|E
500|$|Mike Hale of the New York Times was {{critical}} of the episode, discussing the show's [...] "increasingly rapid march toward Hallmark country." [...] He commented that while [...] "Acafellas" [...] did not match the standard of the pilot episode, it was funnier than [...] "Showmance", and praised the return of Stephen Tobolowsky as Sandy Ryerson. Hale called Groban's cameo the [...] "most fun of all" [...] in the episode, but overall noted that: [...] "The humor can’t {{make up for the}} lack of big production numbers [...] The problem for this show {{is always going to be}} how to fill the gaps between songs. A lot of the current plot lines, like Will and his wife's phantom baby, are <b>already</b> <b>getting</b> old, so it would behoove the producers to keep those gaps as short as possible." [...] Rachel Ray, reviewing the episode for The Independent deemed Glee [...] "overhyped [...] uninspired, confusing and with a simple plot to boot." [...] Ray wrote, Glee [...] "upbeat message" [...] was [...] "overridden by the show's attempt to be darker than the run-of-the mill high school drama." [...] As with Hale, Ray commented that: [...] "Music should be the redeeming feature of Glee but it's not, because the viewer never gets a satisfying taste of the cast members' musical talents". Shawna Malcom criticized Terri and Will's characterization in the episode, deeming Terri [...] "beyond annoying", but wrote: [...] "I have confidence that creator Ryan Murphy will flesh out Jessalyn Gilsig’s character over time. Her seemingly sincere apology to Will for not being more supportive of his boy band was a nice first step." [...] Of Will, Malcom posed the question: [...] "didn’t it feel as though his commitment to the glee club melted away rather quickly? [...] How could he turn his back so easily?" [...] More positively, Malcom called Kurt's coming out scene [...] "lovely". She wrote that Groban's appearance was [...] "laugh out loud" [...] funny, while Stack commented: [...] "It was a little random, but it's all worth it for the scene when Groban was hitting on Will's mom." ...|$|E

The three promotional singles garnered little attention, but helped to promote not only the album, but also ATL.|$|E
2500|$|Foster also {{acted in}} another film {{nominated}} for the Palme d'Or in 1976, Bugsy Malone. The British musical parodied films about Prohibition Era gangsters by having all roles played by children; Foster appeared in a major supporting role as a star of a speakeasy show. Its director Alan Parker was impressed by her, saying that [...] "she takes such an intelligent interest {{in the way the}} film is being made that if I had been run over by a bus I think she was probably the only person on the set able to take over as director." [...] She gained several positive notices for her performance: Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times stated that [...] "at thirteen she was <b>already</b> <b>getting</b> the roles that grown-up actresses complained weren't being written for women anymore", Variety described her as [...] "outstanding", and Vincent Canby of The New York Times called her [...] "the star of the show". Foster's two BAFTAs were awarded jointly for her performances in Taxi Driver and Bugsy Malone. Her third film release in spring 1976 was the independent drama Echoes of a Summer, which had been filmed two years previously. The New York Times named Foster's performance as a terminally ill girl the film's [...] "main strength" [...] and Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune stated that she [...] "is not a good child actress; she's just a good actress", although both reviewers otherwise panned the film.|$|E
