5|$|Zirconium is a {{by-product}} of the mining and processing of the titanium minerals ilmenite and rutile, as well as tin mining. From 2003 to 2007, while prices for the mineral zircon steadily increased from $360 to $840 per tonne, the price for unwrought zirconium metal decreased from $39,900 to $22,700 per ton. Zirconium metal is much higher priced than zircon because the reduction processes <b>are</b> <b>expensive.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{good match}} between {{generation}} and consumption is key for high self consumption, {{and should be}} considered when deciding where to install solar power and how to dimension the installation. The match can be improved with batteries or controllable electricity consumption. However, batteries <b>are</b> <b>expensive</b> and profitability may require provision of other services from them besides self consumption increase. Hot water storage tanks with electric heating with heat pumps or resistance heaters can provide low-cost storage for self consumption of solar power. Shiftable loads, such as dishwashers, tumble dryers and washing machines, can provide controllable consumption with only a limited effect on the users, but their effect on self consumption of solar power may be limited.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} gaseous or highly {{volatile}} brominated halomethane compounds are non-toxic and make superior fire suppressant agents by this same mechanism, and are particular effective in enclosed spaces such as submarines, airplanes, and spacecraft. However, they <b>are</b> <b>expensive</b> and their production and use {{has been greatly}} curtailed due to their effect as ozone-depleting agents. They are no longer used in routine fire extinguishers, but retain niche uses in aerospace and military automatic fire-suppression applications. They include bromochloromethane (Halon 1011, CH2BrCl), bromochlorodifluoromethane (Halon 1211, CBrClF2), and bromotrifluoromethane (Halon 1301, CBrF3).|$|E
5|$|Both plutonium-239 and plutonium-241 are fissile, {{meaning that}} they can sustain a nuclear chain reaction, leading to {{applications}} in nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors. Plutonium-240 exhibits {{a high rate of}} spontaneous fission, raising the neutron flux of any sample containing it. The presence of plutonium-240 limits a plutonium sample's usability for weapons or its quality as reactor fuel, and the percentage of plutonium-240 determines its grade (weapons-grade, fuel-grade, or reactor-grade). Plutonium-238 has a half-life of 88 years and emits alpha particles. It is a heat source in radioisotope thermoelectric generators, which are used to power some spacecraft. Plutonium isotopes <b>are</b> <b>expensive</b> and inconvenient to separate, so particular isotopes are usually manufactured in specialized reactors.|$|E
5|$|Broadly speaking, {{and with}} some exceptions, lithophile heavy metals can be {{extracted}} from their ores by electrical or chemical treatments, while chalcophile heavy metals are obtained by roasting their sulphide ores to yield the corresponding oxides, and then heating these to obtain the raw metals. Radium occurs in quantities {{too small to be}} economically mined and is instead obtained from spent nuclear fuels. The chalcophile platinum group metals (PGM) mainly occur in small (mixed) quantities with other chalcophile ores. The ores involved need to be smelted, roasted, and then leached with sulfuric acid to produce a residue of PGM. This is chemically refined to obtain the individual metals in their pure forms. Compared to other metals, PGM <b>are</b> <b>expensive</b> due to their scarcity and high production costs.|$|E

Pricing for solid wood cabinet doors {{depends on the}} wood species used. For example, teak <b>is</b> more <b>expensive</b> than cherry, which <b>is</b> more <b>expensive</b> than maple, which <b>is</b> more <b>expensive</b> than oak.

5|$|The {{infection}} {{has been}} preventable by vaccination since 1982. Vaccination is {{recommended by the}} World Health Organization in {{the first day of}} life if possible. Two or three more doses are required at a later time for full effect. This vaccine works about 95% of the time. About 180 countries gave the vaccine as part of national programs as of 2006. It is also recommended that all blood be tested for hepatitis B before transfusion and condoms be used to prevent infection. During an initial infection, care is based on the symptoms that a person has. In those who develop chronic disease, antiviral medication such as tenofovir or interferon may be useful; however, these drugs <b>are</b> <b>expensive.</b> Liver transplantation is sometimes used for cirrhosis.|$|E
5|$|Gradually, the low {{frequency}} active RC filter was supplanted by the switched-capacitor filter that operated in the discrete time domain {{rather than the}} continuous time domain. All of these filter technologies require precision components for high performance filtering, and that often requires that the filters be tuned. Adjustable components <b>are</b> <b>expensive,</b> and the labor to do the tuning can be significant. Tuning the poles and zeros of a 7th-order elliptic filter {{is not a simple}} exercise. Integrated circuits have made digital computation inexpensive, so now {{low frequency}} filtering is done with digital signal processors. Such digital filters have no problem implementing ultra-precise (and stable) values, so no tuning or adjustment is required. Digital filters also don't have to worry about stray coupling paths and shielding the individual filter sections from one another. One downside is the digital signal processing may consume much more power than an equivalent LC filter. Inexpensive digital technology has largely supplanted analogue implementations of filters. However, there is still an occasional place for them in the simpler applications such as coupling where sophisticated functions of frequency are not needed.|$|E
5|$|The {{electron}} microscope directs a focused {{beam of electrons}} at a specimen. Some electrons change their properties, such as movement direction, angle, and relative phase and energy as the beam interacts with the material. Microscopists can record these changes in the electron beam to produce atomically resolved images of the material. In blue light, conventional optical microscopes have a diffraction-limited resolution of about 200nm. By comparison, {{electron microscope}}s are limited by the de Broglie wavelength of the electron. This wavelength, for example, is equal to 0.0037nm for electrons accelerated across a 100,000-volt potential. The Transmission Electron Aberration-Corrected Microscope is capable of sub-0.05nm resolution, {{which is more than}} enough to resolve individual atoms. This capability makes the electron microscope a useful laboratory instrument for high resolution imaging. However, electron microscopes <b>are</b> <b>expensive</b> instruments that are costly to maintain.|$|E

5|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} is not {{a simple}} procedure and the consequences of failure are grave. Therefore, the patient is carefully evaluated for potential difficulty or complications beforehand. This involves taking the medical history of the patient and performing a physical examination, the results of which can be scored against one of several classification systems. The proposed surgical procedure (e.g., surgery involving the head and neck, or bariatric surgery) may lead one to anticipate difficulties with intubation. Many individuals have unusual airway anatomy, such as those who have limited movement of their neck or jaw, or those who have tumors, deep swelling due to injury or to allergy, developmental abnormalities of the jaw, or excess fatty tissue of the face and neck. Using conventional laryngoscopic techniques, intubation of the trachea can be difficult or even impossible in such patients. This is why all persons performing tracheal intubation must be familiar with alternative techniques of securing the airway. Use of the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope and similar devices has become among the preferred techniques in the management of such cases. However, these devices require a different skill set than that employed for conventional laryngoscopy and <b>are</b> <b>expensive</b> to purchase, maintain and repair.|$|E
