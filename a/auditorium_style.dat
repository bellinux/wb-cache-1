5000|$|The [...] "Grand Auditorium" [...] guitar, {{sometimes}} called the [...] "000" [...] or the [...] "Triple-Oh," [...] is very similar in design to the Grand Concert, but slightly wider and deeper. Many 000-style guitars also have a convex back panel to increase the volume of space in the soundbox without making the soundbox deeper at the edges, which would affect comfort and playability. The result is a very balanced tone, comparable to the 00 but with greater volume and dynamic range and slightly more low-end response, without sacrificing the ergonomics of the classical style, making these body styles very popular. Eric Clapton's signature Martin guitar, for example, is of this style. Martin's 000-xxx series and Taylor's x14 series are well-known examples of the Grand <b>Auditorium</b> <b>style.</b>|$|E
50|$|Mill's plan {{consisted}} of ‘an emphatic “monumental porch”’ — thirty-two feet square as Latrobe had proposed — grafted onto an <b>auditorium</b> <b>style</b> church. The porch which Mills called the “vestibule” dominates the south elevation, and fronts upon the street. The {{body of the}} church is an octagon, one facet of which abuts the rear of the monumental porch. Within the church directly across from the doorway from the monumental church, the pulpit stands within an acoustically conceived apse, which balances the porch. This bay projects from the northern face of the octagon and was intended to serve as the base of the steeple (never executed). To the east and west corresponding bays project; these contain stairways to the balcony that circumscribe the interior, except the pulpit apse on the north face of the nave. A low saucer dome caps the nave, and its center is pierced by a round monitor or cupola.” The monumental porch adopted “shadow, void and contrasting forms” to register a lasting impression. The design also adopted large forms with least ornamentation with the brown colour of the Aquia stone sandstone accentuating the solemnity of the structure. The placement of the large piers in the porch brought about a shaded interior. The Doric columns with fluted drums also projected out into the light. The overall effect of the porch is thus one of geometrically proportioned and balanced structure.|$|E
50|$|Central Oak Heights is an {{association}} of cottage owners on 45 acres (0.22 km2) of wooded land in Kelly Township, Union County, Pennsylvania in the United States. It was founded in 1909 as a religious campground and retreat by the Bible Conference Society of Central Pennsylvania of the United Evangelical Church. Ownership of the land passed through several churches when in 1946, the Evangelical Church merged with the United Brethren in Christ {{at a meeting in}} Johnstown, PA to form the Evangelical United Brethren Church. This body, in turn, united with the American Methodist Church in 1968 to form the United Methodist Church. The Central Oak Heights Association, a non-profit corporation founded in 1987, took over ownership of the land in 1990. Although no longer affiliated in an official capacity with the United Methodist Church, a great majority of the cottage owners are members of United Methodist Church. The grounds of Central Oak Heights are traditionally open during the summer months only, beginning with Memorial Day in late May and closing soon after Labor Day weekend in early September. But the official opening is April 15 and the grounds close for the winter on October 15. Most of the cottages are privately owned and occupied during the summer months by the owners.

40|$|In {{senior high}} school, {{almost all the}} time the {{teaching}} and learning process is spent out inside the classroom. Therefore, the teacher should have initiatives to make the students feel more comfort and keep pay attention to the teaching learning process. Good seating arrangement is one alternative that can be done by the teacher. This research tries to investigate the effectiveness of seating arrangement using auditorium and U-shape styles to arouse the student’s attention at language classroom in MAN III Malang. The research design of this study is descriptive qualitative. One teacher and two language classes are the subject of this study. To collect the data the writer used interview and questionnaires. The data are collected for a month during teaching and learning activities in the classroom are conducted from February 21 st up to March 22 nd 2005. Based on the data obtained, auditorium is considered more effective than U-shape to arouse the students’ attention. <b>Auditorium</b> <b>style</b> is more effective than U-shape style because the students feel more comfortable and focus to the lesson. The research finding proved that seating arrangement using <b>Auditorium</b> <b>style</b> is more effective than U-shape in arousing the students’ attention in language classroom at MAN III Malang. So, the teacher should consider about how to arrange the seat, because it is related to the students’ success in acquiring the target of teaching and learning. For that reason, auditorium is recommended to be applied in reading class regularly. However, variation is needed to avoid the students’ boredom. For the English students, it can be used as an input to be applied in the classroom in the future {{if they want to be}} a teacher...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the preferences for the design of distributed meeting rooms used for video enhanced electronic meeting systems (VEMS). Although there is a significant body of literature in the group communication domain, the research in this multidisciplinary area has paid minimal attention to users ' environmental preferences in the design of a meeting space. A basic science approach through three studies was used to explore the variables that defined the design of a distributed meeting space from the user's perspective. Twenty-five inexperienced college-enrolled participants and twenty-five experienced Naval professionals used foam-core pieces to create a design of their ideal distributed meeting space. Thirty-seven variables were used to categorize qualitative attributes of the designs. Three types of designs emerged from the sample population: v-shaped, conference (u-shaped or oval), and theater (<b>auditorium)</b> <b>style.</b> A nonexperimental design was used to measure the impact of the heuristics on the users ' physical design of their distributed meeting spaces. Post-meeting evaluation results were promising and indicated that the heuristics were usable and that participatin...|$|E
50|$|These {{structures}} represent significant work by notable architects. Albert Kahn, who {{was best}} known for his concrete-reinforced industrial buildings, designed both of the Temples Beth-El (he was a congregant), as well as a portion of the First Congregational Church. Sidney Rose Badgley designed the Woodward Avenue Presbyterian Church as well as the Highland Park Presbyterian Church. The former is an excellent example of Badgley's trademark <b>auditorium</b> church <b>style</b> with steel-framed octagonal lantern dome atop. Ralph A. Cram designed the St. Paul Cathedral, and it is a major work early in the architect's career. Gordon W. Lloyd, who designed the Central United Methodist Church, was one of Michigan's most prominent late 19th century church architects. Likewise, William E. N. Hunter, who designed the Highland Park First United Methodist Church and the Metropolitan United Methodist Church, was one of Michigan's most prominent early 20th century church architects.|$|R
