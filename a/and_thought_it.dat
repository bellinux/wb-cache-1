5|$|In 1805, on {{the journey}} westward down the Columbia, the Lewis and Clark Expedition {{recorded}} seeing the mountain; noting that it was “a high mountain of emence hight covered with snow” <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> “perhaps the highest pinnacle in America.” They initially misidentified it as Mount St. Helens, which had been previously discovered and named by George Vancouver. On the return journey in 1806, they recorded seeing both, but did not give Adams a name, only calling it “a very high humped mountain”. This is the earliest recorded sighting of the volcano by European explorers.|$|E
5|$|Michael Balcon, {{the head}} of Ealing Studios and the {{producer}} of Kind Hearts and Coronets, appointed Robert Hamer as director.

Filming took place from September 1948 at Leeds Castle and other locations in Kent, and at Ealing Studios. The themes of class and sexual repression run through the film, particularly love between classes.|$|E

He made one last attempt to keep the band together, asking Frusciante to rejoin. Frusciante had recently completed a drug rehabilitation program after more than five years of heroin addiction, and gladly accepted the invitation.|$|E
5|$|India Knight, {{a novelist}} and {{columnist}} for The Sunday Times, tweeted on 9 July 2013 {{that she had}} been reading The Cuckoo's Calling <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was good for a début novel. In response, a tweeter called Jude Callegari said that the author was Rowling. Knight queried this but got no further reply. Knight notified Richard Brooks, arts editor of the Sunday Times, who began his own investigation. After discovering that Rowling and Galbraith had the same agent and editor, he sent the books for linguistic analysis which found similarities, and subsequently contacted Rowling's agent who confirmed it was Rowling's pseudonym. Within days of Rowling being revealed as the author, sales of the book rose by 4,000%, and Little Brown printed another 140,000 copies to meet the increase in demand. , a signed copy of the first edition sold for US$4,453 (£2,950), while an unsold signed first-edition copy was being offered for $6,188 (£3,950).|$|E

5|$|The three recent {{treatments}} (Henderson and coauthors, Glassman, and Govaerts and Dransfield) recognised a {{total of}} 73 species, but only 20 species are accepted by all of them. The remainder account for either nine species or more than 40. For example, what Andrew Henderson considered a single species, Attalea attaleoides, other authors have considered a species complex consisting {{of four or five}} species. Glassman doubted the validity of A.attaleoides as a species, and described four new species from material that had previously been attributed to A.attaleoides—A.camopiensis, A.degranvillei, A.guianensis and A.maripensis. Govaerts and Dransfield accepted both Glassman's four species and A.attaleoides. However, Jean-Christophe Pintaud was of the opinion that A.guianensis, A.maripensis and A.attaleoides were all very similar, <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> likely that they all represented the same species.|$|E
5|$|Though the Mellotron was not {{extensively}} {{used in the}} 1980s, {{a number}} of bands featured it as a prominent instrument. One of the few UK post-punk bands to do so was Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, who featured it heavily on their platinum-selling 1981 album Architecture & Morality. Andy McCluskey has stated they used the Mellotron because they were starting to run into limitations of the cheap monophonic synthesizers they had used up to that point. He bought a second-hand M400 and was immediately impressed with the strings and choir sounds. XTC's Dave Gregory recalls seeing bands using Mellotrons when {{growing up in the}} 1970s, <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would be an interesting addition to the group's sound. He bought a second-hand model in 1982 for £165, and first used it on the album Mummer (1983). IQ's Martin Orford bought a second-hand M400 and used it primarily for visual appeal rather than musical quality or convenience.|$|E

5|$|During Harrison's administration, the Lakota Sioux, {{previously}} {{confined to}} reservations in South Dakota, grew restive {{under the influence}} of Wovoka, a medicine man, who encouraged them to participate in a spiritual movement called the Ghost Dance. Many in Washington did not understand the predominantly religious nature of the Ghost Dance, <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was a militant movement being used to rally Native Americans against the government. On December 29, 1890, troops from the Seventh Cavalry clashed with the Sioux at Wounded Knee. The result was a massacre of at least 146 Sioux, including many women and children; the dead Sioux were buried in a mass grave. In reaction Harrison directed Major General Nelson A. Miles to investigate and ordered 3500 federal troops to South Dakota; the uprising was brought to an end. Wounded Knee is considered the last major American Indian battle in the 19th century. Harrison's general policy on American Indians was to encourage assimilation into white society and, despite the massacre, he believed the policy to have been generally successful. This policy, known as the allotment system and embodied in the Dawes Act, was favored by liberal reformers at the time, but eventually proved detrimental to American Indians as they sold most of their land at low prices to white speculators.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall {{returned}} {{to take the}} second new ball and trapped Jack Crapp, who did not offer a shot, for 37 to leave the score at 3/87. The batsman misjudged the line of a straight ball <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> had pitched and struck his leg outside off stump. Lindwall later had Edrich gloving a rearing ball to the wicket-keeper to leave England at 5/119. Compton returned upon {{the fall of the}} fifth wicket to revive the innings and Lindwall ended with 4/99 after having Godfrey Evans caught behind from an expansive cut shot. England ended on 363 all out on the second day; Compton made an unbeaten 145. Lindwall had beaten Compton in each of his last three overs before lunch on the second day, but the Englishman survived to add more than 20 further runs. On the third day, Lindwall came to the crease at 6/172 after Barneswho had collapsed due to the aftereffects of being hit in the ribs from point blank range when fieldinghad been forced to retire hurt. Australia faced the prospect of being forced to follow on, and Lindwall received five consecutive bouncers from Edrich, one of which hit him in the hand, evoking cheers from the home crowd. Lindwall made 23 as Australia struggled to 221 and avoided the follow on by eight runs; he was the last man to be dismissed.|$|E
5|$|Upon the resumption, Crapp {{began to}} accelerate, hitting a six—which flew {{directly}} {{back over the}} bowler's head and over the sightscreen—and three driven boundaries from the off spin of Ian Johnson. This was {{a stark contrast to}} Johnson's first ten overs before lunch, which had yielded only seven runs. Crapp was eager to use his feet to get to the pitch of Johnson's deliveries, and subsequently dealt with the spin fairly comfortably, whereas many of his compatriots stood in their crease and found matters much more difficult. He then hit Toshack to Barnes at short leg, but the catch was dropped. However, Crapp did not capitalise as Toshack conceded only eight runs in a sequence of eight overs. Australia took the new ball with the score at 87 and Lindwall trapped Crapp—who did not offer a shot—leg before wicket for 37; the batsman misjudged the line of a straight ball <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> had pitched and struck his leg outside off stump. Tom Dollery came in and took a single to get off the mark but then missed a Johnston yorker and was bowled. This dismissal mirrored that of Washbrook's in that Dollery failed to detect Johnston's variation ball, and thus played for swing when there was none. England had lost two wickets for one run to be 97/4. Captain Norman Yardley came in and played the fast bowling of Lindwall and Johnston with relative ease, retreating onto the back foot to allow himself more time to play his shots. Edrich was struck on the hand and Yardley edged to Keith Miller in the slips cordon on the half-volley.|$|E

5|$|Zito {{wanted to}} put {{together}} some demos to present the technology to Hasbro. Riley wanted {{to create an environment}} the player could move freely about, leading to the idea of surveillance cameras. Fulop and Riley were inspired by the play Tamara (1981) which ran parallel stories running in 13 different rooms. The audience would need to decide for themselves which stories they wanted to follow. Fulop and Riley watched the play three times {{over the course of a}} weekend in 1985. Fulop and Riley liked the design model <b>and</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would make a good basis for an interactive media experience. A prototype game titled Scene of the Crime was produced to demonstrate the new technology to Hasbro and test the surveillance camera gameplay. It was a short five-minute demo where the player follows suspicious characters around a house to find who stole a stash of money. The player switches between cameras to observe the characters and eavesdrop on their conversations; all the characters have a plot to steal the money. At the end of the game, the player must guess who stole the money. In December 1986, the team flew to Hasbro headquarters in Pawtucket, Rhode Island and pitched the technology to Hasbro CEO Stephen Hassenfeld and a board room of 22 executives who liked the system and gave funding to support further development for the technology and games.|$|E
