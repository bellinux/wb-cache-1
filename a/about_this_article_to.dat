40|$|Recently Richard Lynn and Tatu Vanhanen have {{presented}} evidence {{that differences in}} national IQ account for the substantial variation in national per capita income and growth. This paper challenges these findings and claims that, firstly, they simply reflect inappropriate use and interpretations of statistical instruments. Secondly, {{it is argued that}} the models presented by Lynn and Vanhanen are under-complex and inadequately specified. More precisely the authors confuse IQ with human capital. The paper concludes that once control variables are introduced and the models are adequately specified, neither an impact of IQ on income nor on growth can be substantiated. 1 I {{would like to thank the}} several readers of the draft for their helpful comments and suggestions which improved the final text considerably.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of skin allograft rejection has been thought to require presentation of graft antigen by resident epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs). We have previously engineered mice {{that have a}} selective and constitutive absence of epidermal LCs. By using donor skin from these LC-deficient mice, we show that LCs are not required for rejection of major (FVB → B 6) or minor (H-Y, male → female on B 6 background) antigen-mismatched skin grafts. On the FVB background, where H-Y mismatched grafts are normally maintained indefinitely, grafts lacking LCs are efficiently rejected. Thus, LCs in the donor graft are required for long-term skin engraftment, which supports a regulatory role for LCs in skin graft acceptance.

40|$|Eczema vaccinatum is a {{potentially}} fatal, disseminated viral skin infection that develops in individuals with atopic dermatitis after {{exposure to the}} vaccinia virus (VV). Despite advances in modern medicine, there are few options for those suffering from disseminated VV infections. Ceragenins (CSAs) are synthetic antimicrobial compounds designed to mimic the structure and function of endogenous antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). We show that CSA- 13 exhibits potent antiviral activity against VV by (1) direct antiviral effects against VV; and (2) stimulating the expression of endogenous AMPs with known antiviral activity against VV. In addition, we show that a topical application of CSA- 13 penetrates the skin and reduces subsequent satellite lesion formation. This suggests that treatment with CSA- 13 may be an intervention for individuals with a disseminated VV skin infection.

40|$|When {{the skin}} is damaged, a variety of cell types must migrate, proliferate, and {{differentiate}} to reform a functional barrier to the external environment. Recent {{studies have shown that}} progenitor cells residing in hair follicles (HFs) are able to contribute to this re-epithelialization of wounds in vivo. However, the influence of the hair cycle on wound healing has not previously been addressed. Here, we have exploited spontaneous postnatal hair-cycle synchronicity in mice to systematically examine the influence of the different hair-cycle stages on murine skin wound healing. We report significant acceleration of healing during the anagen phase of HF cycling in vivo, associated with alterations in epithelial, endothelial, and inflammatory cell types. Intriguingly, gene profiling data reveal a clear correlation between the transcription of genes beneficial for wound healing and those upregulated during the anagen phase of the hair cycle in unwounded skin. These findings, which demonstrate a previously unappreciated association between HF cycling and wound healing, reveal numerous molecular correlates for further investigation.

40|$|Hair follicles {{have been}} {{observed}} to provide a major cellular contribution to epidermal healing, with emigration of stem-derived cells from the follicles aiding in wound reepithelialization. However, the functional requirements for this hair follicle input are unknown. Here we have characterized the keratinocyte stem cell status of mutant mice that lack all hair follicle development on their tail, and analyzed the consequent alterations in epidermal wound healing rate and mechanisms. In analyzing stem cell behavior in embryonic skin we found that clonogenic keratinocytes are relatively frequent in the ectoderm prior to hair follicle formation. However, their frequency in the interfollicular epidermis drops sharply by birth, at which time the majority of stem cells are present within the hair follicles. We find that {{in the absence of}} hair follicles cutaneous wounds heal with an acute delay in reepithelialization. This delay is followed by expansion of the region of activated epidermis, beyond that seen in normal haired skin, followed by appropriate wound closure.

40|$|Deregulation of the {{activator}} protein 1 (AP 1) family gene regulators has {{been implicated in}} a wide range of diseases, including cancer. In this study we report that c-Jun was activated in human squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and coexpression of c-Jun with oncogenic Ras was sufficient to transform primary human epidermal cells into malignancy in a regenerated human skin grafting model. In contrast, JunB was not induced in a majority of human SCC cells. Moreover, exogenous expression of JunB inhibited tumorigenesis driven by Ras or spontaneous human SCC cells. Conversely, the dominant-negative JunB mutant (DNJunB) promoted tumorigenesis, which is in contrast to the tumor-suppressor function of the corresponding c-Jun mutant. At the cellular level, JunB induced epidermal cell senescence and slowed cell growth in a cell-autonomous manner. Consistently, coexpression of JunB and Ras induced premature epidermal differentiation concomitant with upregulation of p 16 and filaggrin and downregulation of cyclin D 1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK 4). These findings indicate that JunB and c-Jun differentially regulate cell growth and differentiation and induce opposite effects on epidermal neoplasia.

40|$|Epithelia {{establish}} a microbial barrier against infection through {{the production of}} antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). In this study, we investigated whether catestatin (Cst), a peptide derived from the neuroendocrine protein chromogranin A (CHGA), is a functional AMP and {{is present in the}} epidermis. We show that Cst is antimicrobial against relevant skin microbes, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, yeast, and fungi. The antimicrobial mechanism of Cst was found to be similar to other AMPs, as it was dependent on bacterial charge and growth conditions, and induced membrane disruption. The potential relevance of Cst against skin pathogens was supported by the observation that CHGA was expressed in keratinocytes. In human skin, CHGA was found to be proteolytically processed into the antimicrobial fragment Cst, thus enabling its AMP function. Furthermore, Cst expression in murine skin increased in response to injury and infection, providing potential for increased protection against infection. These data demonstrate that a neuroendocrine peptide has antimicrobial function against a wide assortment of skin pathogens and is upregulated upon injury, thus demonstrating a direct link between the neuroendocrine and cutaneous immune systems.

40|$|We lack {{comparative}} data on sunscreens with comparable sun protection factors (SPFs), but with {{different levels of}} UVA protection, especially against cumulative erythema from repeated suberythemal exposure. Thus, we compared the protection from cumulative sunburn with two sunscreens labeled SPF 6, but with different UVR-absorbing properties, one that absorbs the UVB waveband and the other that absorbs UVB+UVA wavebands. We simulated sunlight typical of temperate latitudes to expose skin daily to suberythemal doses for 13 consecutive days. The study population consisted of eight fair-skinned sun-sensitive healthy young adults. Erythema was assessed by eye and objectively, and the SPF of each sunscreen was modeled with changes in solar UVR with time of day and latitude. The broad-spectrum sunscreen gave much better protection against cumulative erythema than the UVB sunscreen. The explanation {{for this is that}} UVA makes a greater contribution toward sunburn at temperate latitudes than under the laboratory conditions in which SPF is tested and assigned. The data support the current trend toward broad-spectrum sunscreen protection. They also show that labeled SPF is much more reliable with broad-spectrum sunscreens because SPF with primarily UVB sunscreens is dependent on time of day and latitude.

However, despite the common {{use of this}} form of treatment, the mechanism of action of NB-UVB is not well understood. We studied a group of 14 patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis treated with carefully titrated and monitored NB-UVB for 6 weeks. Lesional plaques were classified as normalized (n= 8) or nonresponsive (n= 6) based on their histological improvement and normalization. We characterized lesional myeloid dendritic cells (DCs) and T cells and their inflammatory mediators using immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR. NB-UVB suppressed multiple parameters of the IL- 23 /IL- 17 pathway in normalized plaques, but not in nonresponsive plaques. NB-UVB decreased the numbers of CD 11 c+ DCs, specifically CD 1 c−CD 11 c+ “inflammatory” DCs, and their products, IL- 20, inducible nitric oxide synthase, IL- 12 / 23 p 40, and IL- 23 p 19. Furthermore, effective NB-UVB suppressed IL- 17 and IL- 22 mRNAs, which strongly correlated with lesion resolution. Therefore, {{in addition to its}} known role in suppressing IFN-γ production, NB-UVB radiation therapy can also target the IL- 17 pathway to resolve psoriatic inflammation.

40|$|Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is a {{pleiotropic}} multisystem disorder affecting skin, eyes, and {{the cardiovascular}} system with progressive pathological mineralization. It {{is caused by}} mutations in the ABCC 6 gene expressed primarily in the liver and kidneys, and at very low levels, if at all, in tissues affected by PXE. A question has arisen regarding the pathomechanism of PXE, particularly the “metabolic” versus the “PXE cell” hypotheses. We examined a murine PXE model (Abcc 6 -/-) by transplanting muzzle skin from knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice {{onto the back of}} WT and KO mice using mineralization of the connective tissue capsule surrounding the vibrissae as an early phenotypic biomarker. Grafting of WT mouse muzzle skin onto the back of KO mice resulted in mineralization of vibrissae, whereas grafting KO mouse muzzle skin onto WT mice did not. Thus, these findings implicate circulatory factors as a critical component of the mineralization process. This mouse grafting model supports the notion that PXE is a systemic metabolic disorder with secondary mineralization of connective tissues and that the mineralization process can be countered or even reversed by changes in the homeostatic milieu.

40|$|Adult mastocytosis is {{an incurable}} clonal disease {{associated}} with c-KIT mutations, mostly in exon 17 (D 816 V). In contrast, pediatric mastocytosis often spontaneously regresses {{and is considered}} a reactive disease. Previous studies on childhood mastocytosis assessed only a few patients and focused primarily on codon 816 mutations, with various results. In this study, we analyzed the entire c-KIT sequence from cutaneous biopsies of 50 children with mastocytosis (ages 0 – 16 years). A mutation of codon 816 (exon 17) was found in 42 % of cases, and mutations outside exon 17 were observed in 44 %. Unexpectedly, half of the mutations were located in the fifth Ig loop of c-KIT's extracellular domain, which is encoded by exons 8 and 9. All mutations identified {{in this study were}} somatic and caused a constitutive activation of c-KIT. There was no clear phenotype–genotype correlation, no clear relationship between the mutations and familial versus spontaneous disease, and no significant change in the relative expression of the c-KIT GNNK+ and GNNK isoforms. These findings strongly support the idea that, although pediatric mastocytosis can spontaneously regress, it is a clonal disease most commonly associated with activating mutations in c-KIT.

40|$|Epidemiological and {{biological}} {{studies indicate that}} solar UVB radiation is involved in cutaneous malignant melanoma etiology. Indeed, melanocytes are very frequently exposed to solar UV radiation, which induces cell damage and may promote cell transformation. We previously showed that melanocytes and melanoma cells exposed to UVB radiation activates a p 53 -independent pathway involving Gadd 45 a and, more recently, that Gadd 45 a plays {{a critical role in}} UVB-induced G 2 cell cycle arrest of melanoma cells. In this study, we demonstrate that the inhibition of UV-induced Gadd 45 a overexpression by RNA interference results in a dramatic increase of cell death. We identify this cell death as apoptosis, with activation of Caspase- 3 and a decrease in Bcl-xL expression. Furthermore, we show that inhibition of UV-induced Gadd 45 a overexpression also leads to increased sensitivity of melanoma cells to therapeutic agents such as DTIC and Cisplatin. We conclude that UVB-induced Gadd 45 a overexpression protects melanoma cells from apoptosis, both by causing a G 2 cell cycle arrest and by inhibiting the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. These observations suggest that Gadd 45 a inactivation could be a useful way to sensitize melanoma cells to chemotherapy.

A role for EGFR itself in peripheral nervous system development in vivo, however, has not been reported. We investigated whether EGFR is required for cutaneous innervation using Egfr null and skin-targeted Egfr mutant mice. Neuronal markers; including PGP 9. 5, GAP- 43, acetylated tubulin, and neurofilaments; revealed that Egfr null dorsal skin was hyperinnervated with a disorganized pattern of innervation. In addition, receptor subtypes such as lanceolate endings were disorganized and immature. To determine whether the hyperinnervation phenotype resulted from a target-derived effect of loss of EGFR, mice lacking EGFR expression in the cutaneous epithelium were examined. These mice retained {{other aspects of the}} cutaneous Egfr null phenotype but exhibited normal innervation. The sensory deficits in Egfr null dorsal skin were not associated with any abnormality in the morphology or density of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons or Schwann cells. However, explant and dissociated cell cultures of DRG revealed more extensive branching in Egfr null cultures. These data demonstrate that EGFR is required for proper cutaneous innervation during development and suggest that it limits axonal outgrowth and branching in a DRG-autonomous manner.

40|$|In this study, we {{demonstrate}} {{that we can}} isolate stem cells (SCs) with neural crest characteristics from the bulge area of cultured human hair follicles (HFs). These SCs can proliferate in situ and form spheroid structures attached to the bulge area of HFs, and they express immature neural crest cell markers but not differentiation markers. An expression profiling study showed that they share a similar gene expression pattern with murine skin immature neural crest cells. These human SCs are label-retaining cells and are capable of self-renewal through asymmetric cell division in vitro. They exhibit clonal multipotency that can give rise to myogenic, melanocytic, and neuronal cell lineages after in vitro clonal single cell culture. In addition, these SCs show differentiation potential toward mesenchymal lineages, {{and they can be}} differentiated into adipocyte, chondrocyte, and osteocyte lineages. Neuronal differentiation of these cells induces global gene expression changes with a significantly increased expression of neuron-associated genes. Differentiated neuronal cells can persist in mouse brain and retain neuronal differentiation markers. The presence of SCs with neural crest characteristics in HFs may offer new opportunities for the use of these cells in regenerative medicine.

40|$|In this study, we {{hypothesize that}} local {{sustained}} release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), using adenovirus vector (ADV) -mediated gene transfer, accelerates experimental wound healing. This hypothesis was tested by determining the specific effects of VEGF 165 application on multiple {{aspects of the}} wound healing process, that is, time to complete wound closure and skin biomechanical properties. After showing accelerated wound healing in vivo, we studied the mechanism to explain the findings on multiple aspects of the wound healing cascade, including epithelialization, collagen deposition, and cell migration. Intradermal treatment of wounds in non-obese diabetic and db/db mice with ADV/VEGF 165 improves healing by enhancing tensile stiffness and/or increasing epithelialization and collagen deposition, {{as well as by}} decreasing time to wound closure. VEGF 165, in vitro, stimulates the migration of cultured human keratinocytes and fibroblasts, thus revealing a non-angiogenic effect of VEGF on wound closure. In conclusion, ADV/VEGF is effective in accelerating wound closure by stimulating angiogenesis, epithelialization, and collagen deposition. In the future, local administration and sustained, controlled release of VEGF 165 may decrease amputations in patients with diabetic foot ulcers and possibly accelerate closure of venous ulcers and pressure ulcers.

CsA, but not SRL or combined treatment, increased dermal mast cell numbers and TGF-β 1 levels in the skin. These findings demonstrate that specific immunosuppressive agents differentially alter the cutaneous tumor microenvironment, which in turn may contribute to enhanced development of UVB-induced skin cancer in transplant recipients. Furthermore, these results suggest that CsA alone causes enhanced growth and progression of skin cancer, whereas co-administration of SRL with CsA causes the opposite effect.

40|$|It is {{opined that}} {{the mass media}} forces {{attention}} on certain issues by constantly projecting them and suggesting its audiences <b>to</b> think <b>about</b> them. <b>This</b> <b>article</b> attempts <b>to</b> focus on the Agenda Setting function of English news media in Malaysia during the 13 th GE 13 employing quantitative content analysis. Two English newspapers were analyzed, namely The Star and New Straits Times with 1362 news items identified. In order to gauge the public agenda, quantitative survey were done {{three times in the}} months of February, March and April 2013 respectively leading up to the election on 5 th of May, 2013. The study found out that the agenda setting function of the English newspapers is important in transferring issue salience and issue attributes to their audiences. Individuals who highly rely on news from the media shall be likely influenced by the Agenda Setting effect of the media. There was no significant relationship between the English newspapers and the public agenda of the main ethnic groups in Malaysia. Hence, the public agenda of the Malays, Chinese and Indians have no significant relationship with the English Newspapers. Future studies could employ a qualitative approach in order to find answers to the reasons for lack of relationship between the English newspapers and ethnic public agenda...|$|R
40|$|A lack of {{consensus}} exists {{with regards to the}} relative rates of NRAS and BRAF mutations in the radial (RGP) and vertical (VGP) growth phases of individual melanoma tumors. This study was conducted to test the hypothesis that mutations are acquired with progression from RGP to VGP. Using laser capture microdissection, pure tumor DNA was obtained from 15 in situ melanomas, and from the RGP and VGP of 29 invasive tumors. NRAS exon 2 and BRAF exon 15 DNA were amplified by PCR and sequenced. Mutations were present in 6 of 15 in situ melanomas (40 %). Of 29 invasive tumors, 16 exhibited RGP mutations (55. 2 %); 22 showed VGP mutations (75. 9 %). Paired RGP/VGP mutation analysis revealed a trend toward discordance in the distribution of mutations, favoring VGP localization (P= 0. 07). Of 15 samples, 12 with mutations in both phases had an increased proportion of mutated DNA in the VGP, measured on DNA chromatograms (P= 0. 08). Limitations of this study include a relatively small sample cohort selected for technical reasons from a larger population, presenting the risk of selection bias. These concerns notwithstanding our findings support the hypothesis that NRAS and BRAF mutations increase with tumor progression from superficial to invasive disease.
