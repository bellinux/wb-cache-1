The study relied on desk research into the existing literature and public records; key informant interviews (KIIs) of policymakers in respective EAC Partner States’ governments with the exception of Burundi; as well as with private labour recruitment agencies in each country. The study has found that the EAC framework is not sufficiently implemented at the national level and only inconsistently incorporates other country-specific policies dealing with labour migration in the region. The study underlines Kenya’s dominance in the EAC, especially in terms of its best trained and skilled human resources working in all EAC Partner States. The main recommendation centres on the need for harmonizing national labour policy frameworks and legislation as well as the free movement of labour as enshrined in the Protocol on the East <b>African</b> Community <b>Common</b> <b>Market</b> (PEACCM) ...|$|R

40|$|The Rio+ 20 {{outcomes}} document, the Future We Want, enshrines {{green economy}} {{as one of}} the platforms to attain sustainable development and calls for measures that seek to address climate change and biodiversity management. This paper audits climate change policies from selected east and southern African countries {{to determine the extent to}} which climate change legislation mainstreams biodiversity and wildlife management. A scan of international, continental, regional and national climate change policies was conducted to assess whether they include biodiversity and/or wildlife management issues. The key finding is that many climate change policy–related documents, particularly the National Adaptation Programme of Actions (NAPAs), address threats to biodiversity and wildlife resources. However, international policies like the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and Kyoto Protocol do not address the matter under deliberation. Regional climate change policies such as the East <b>African</b> Community, <b>Common</b> <b>Market</b> for Eastern and Southern Africa and African Union address biodiversity and/or wildlife issues whilst the Southern African Development Community region does not have a stand-alone policy for climate change. Progressive countries like Rwanda, Uganda, Tanzania and Zambia have recently put in place detailed NAPAs which are mainstream responsive strategies intended to address climate change adaptation in the wildlife sector.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} state trading on {{the operation of the}} East <b>African</b> <b>Common</b> <b>Market.</b> The first part of the paper develops a general framework for the analysis of this question. After setting out the alternative concepts of integration corresponding to the principles of integration in market economies and centrally planned economies and the role of state trading therein, the paper contrasts them with the situation in integration attempts among developing countries with different economic systems. This is followed by a discussion of the definition, functions, structure and operation of state trading enterprises. An attempt is then made to explore the impact of state trading systems on intra-regional trade in the light of various obstacles to the expansion of such trade. The second part of the paper traces the evolution and structure of state trading enterprises in the East African countries. The characteristics of state trading enterprises are then related to their impact on the growth of East African trade in recent years. Consideration is also given to other developments such as the increasing foreign exchange difficulties being experienced by the Partner States, especially Uganda and Tanzania, and the growth of the system of foreign trade planning in Tanzania. The implications of these developments for the East <b>African</b> <b>Common</b> <b>Market</b> are spelled out. In conclusion, the paper considers various recommendations to overcome obstacles to trade expansion posed by state trading enterprises, increasing foreign exchange difficulties and foreign trade planning...|$|E

40|$|The authors use an {{accelerator}} {{model to}} assess the determinants of private investment and to analyze how adjustment policies affect those determinants. Their model emphasizes the effect of resource constraints on private investment behavior, including that arising from foreign exchange rationing. Econometric estimation of the investment model with Kenyan data for 1968 - 88 suggests that Kenya's failure to implement adjustment policies {{after the collapse of}} the coffee boom and the breakup of the East <b>African</b> <b>common</b> <b>market</b> reduced private investment sharply in the 1980 s. The authors argue that inadequate fiscal adjustment was a key failure of policy. With direct competition between public and private sectors for limited financial resources, fiscal deficits preempted funds and restricted private investor's access to them. In addition, when cuts in government spending were undertaken to contain deficits, they fell disproportionately on capital expenditure, especially on physical infrastructure. Though real depreciation is found to have a direct negative impact on investment, the authors use simulations to show that it has a positive indirect effect on private investment in the medium term because such depreciation relaxes the foreign exchange constraint on imports. They conclude that efficient fiscal adjustment and liberalization of imports will be critical for the recovery of private investment in Kenya.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyse the role of {{regional}} organisations in conflict resolution {{and to what extent}} and with which legal authority are they allowed to participate in these resolutions taking into the consideration the norms of international law that is to say, the treaties and protocols relating to conflict resolution of the organisations shall also be focused upon.

This thesis will also deal with the influence that international non'state actors have on these organisations as well as the international norms that are to be respected and protected during conflict resolution. For this thesis, emphasis will be placed on the following regional organisations and the role they play in conflict resolution; these include: ECOWAS: Economic Community of West African States, EAC: East African Community, ECCAS: Economic Community for Central <b>African</b> States, COMESA: <b>Common</b> <b>Market</b> for East and Southern Africa, IGAD: Intergovernmental Authority on Development, SADC: Southern African Development Community...|$|R
40|$|Since the 1960 s, African {{states have}} embraced {{regional}} integration {{as a vital}} mechanism for political cooperation and for pooling resources to overcome problems of small and fragmented economies. In building meaningful institutions for regionalism, however, Africans have faced the challenges of reconciling the diversities of culture, geography, and politics. As a result, African regional institutions are characterized by multiple and competing mandates and weak institutionalization. This study illustrates these themes by comparing two continental institutions 2 ̆ 014 the African Union and its predecessor, the Organization of African Unity, and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa and subregional institutions 2 ̆ 014 the Economic Commission of Central African States, the Economic Community of West <b>African</b> States, the <b>Common</b> <b>Market</b> for East and Southern African States, the Community of the Sahel-Saharan States, and the Arab Maghreb Union.

40|$|Evidence {{indicates}} that trade costs are {{a much more}} substantial barrier to trade than tariffs, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. We decompose trade costs into (a) trade facilitation; (b) non-tariff barriers and (c) the costs of business services. We develop a conceptually innovative model and new dataset to assess deep integration to reduce these three types of trade costs in the East <b>African</b> Community, the <b>Common</b> <b>Market</b> of East and Southern Africa and South African Development Community (EAC-COMESA-SADC) ‘Tripartite' Free Trade Area (FTA), within the EAC alone and unilaterally by the EAC. We find that there are substantial gains for all six of our African regions from deep integration in the Tripartite FTA or comparable unilateral reforms by the EAC; but the estimated gains vary considerably across countries and depend on the reform. Thus, countries would {{have an interest in}} negotiating for different reforms in different agreements. Tariff removal in the Tripartite FTA would produce only small losses or gains, depending on the country. Interestingly, we estimate that Kenya gains less from comparable unilateral liberalisation by the EAC than from the Tripartite FTA, due in part to an umbrella of protection in services markets in the Tripartite regio...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{attempts}} of many {{scholars in the}} social sciences, {{no one has yet}} developed an adequate theoretical model for describing, explaining, or predicting integration efforts in less developed areas. Jacob Viner, the first economist to attempt to measure the value of customs unions, failed to adequately consider the dynamic effects of integration in reaching a pessimistic conclusion as to the potential benefits of integration for developing countries. It was left to Bela Balassa to develop the theory of economic development by import substitution that has been used by leaders of developing countries to justify economic integration to maximize the potential for import substitution. However, the economic theory of integration fails to consider the crucial social and political processes that are of such importance in the integration process. Political science theories also have their major faults. Deutsch's sociocausal paradigm contains large theoretical gaps between crucial variables as well as being Western orientated. The neo-functionalist model also fails to be of use in developing areas because of its emphasis on variables found principally in developed areas. It is to fill this gap in our knowledge of integration that this author develops a model of integration for all areas by using Joseph S. Nye's revised neo-functionalist model as a core and the East <b>African</b> <b>Common</b> <b>Market</b> and the Central American Common Market as case studies. Finally, an empirical test to study the impact of integration on instability in Central America is explicated to show the value of our integration model in bettering our understanding of integration in developing areas...|$|E
40|$|Doctor Legum - LLDThe need to {{harmonise}} laws in Africa {{has grown in}} importance {{in view of the}} envisaged <b>African</b> <b>common</b> <b>market.</b> Economic integration cannot flourish without an effective regional legal framework. There is fragmentation in trade mark protection in Africa as evidenced by the existing two sub-regional organisations namely, the African Regional Intellectual Property Organisation (ARIPO) and the Organisation Africaine de la Propriété Intellectuelle (OAPI). The absence of a single regional legal framework has resulted in African countries not having a coherent strategy for advancing their common interests in regional and multilateral negotiations. African countries have acceded to agreements which do not reflect their interests such as Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS). African countries have also been signing Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) which contain higher intellectual property protection standards than the minimum standards prescribed by TRIPS. The {{purpose of this study is}} to formulate a proposal for the integration of trade mark laws in Africa, with a view to strengthening the regional legal framework. A consolidated regional position, based on an integrated legal framework, will strengthen Africa’s participation in negotiations. This will in turn ensure greater regard for, and better protection of, Africa’s interests and concerns. Trade mark laws are important as they can hinder or promote trade. Harmonised trade mark laws will create legal and commercial certainty as well as predictability, which is crucial for the promotion of trade and foreign direct investment. The central argument advanced is that the areas of convergence in the laws under study and in the way the laws are interpreted can form the basis for the harmonisation of Africa’s trade mark laws...|$|E

We used a time-calibrated, Bayesian inference phylogenetic framework and conducted character-based, genetic and phylogenetic delineation of species hypotheses within <b>African</b> <b>common</b> pangolins. We identified six geographic lineages partitioned into western Africa, Ghana, the Dahomey Gap, western central Africa, Gabon and central Africa, all diverging during the Middle to Late Pleistocene.
