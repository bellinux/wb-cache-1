5|$|DNA {{nanotechnology}} is {{the design}} <b>and</b> <b>manufacture</b> of artificial nucleic acid structures for technological uses.

Researchers in the field have created static structures such as two- and three-dimensional crystal lattices, nanotubes, polyhedra, and arbitrary shapes, and functional devices such as molecular machines and DNA computers. The field is beginning {{to be used as}} a tool to solve basic science problems in structural biology and biophysics, including applications in X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of proteins to determine structures.

5|$|In 1974, DARPA {{secretly}} requested {{answers from}} five aircraft manufacturers regarding two considerations.

Fairchild and Grumman declined to participate, while General Dynamics insisted on the use of electronic countermeasures. As a result, General Dynamics left the discussion.

5|$|Among other points, the NATO group cited {{superior}} effectiveness (27 percent greater) for the 5.7Ã28mm against unprotected {{targets and}} equal effectiveness against protected targets.

5|$|Kodumanal {{was popular}} for the {{gem-cutting}} industry <b>and</b> <b>manufacture</b> of jewels. Sites bearing natural reserves of semi-precious stones such as beryls, sapphire and quartz {{are located in}} the vicinity of Kodumanal. Beads of sapphire, beryl, agate, carnelian, amethyst, lapis lazulli, jasper, garnet, soapstone and quartz were unearthed from here. The samples were in different manufacturing stages â finished, semi-finished, drilled and undrilled, polished and unpolished and in the form of raw material. Chips and stone slabs, one with a few grooved beads, clearly demonstrate that these were manufactured locally at Kodumanal. Excavations at Korkai have yielded a large number of pearl oyesters at different levels, indicating the practice of the trade in this region. Some of the objects excavated from Kodumanal show a lot of artistic features such as paintings on the pottery, engravings on the beads, hexagonal designs on beads, inlay work in a tiger figurine and engraved shell bangles. More than ten designs are noticed in the paintings and bead etchings.|$|E
5|$|On 26 March 1969, four partner nationsâ United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, {{agreed to}} form a {{multinational}} company, Panavia Aircraft GmbH, to develop <b>and</b> <b>manufacture</b> the MRCA. The project's aim was to produce an aircraft capable of undertaking missions in the tactical strike, reconnaissance, air defence, and maritime roles; thus allowing the MRCA to replace several different aircraft then in use by the partner nations. Various concepts, including alternative fixed-wing and single-engine designs, were studied while defining the aircraft. The Netherlands {{pulled out of the}} project in 1970, citing that the aircraft was too complicated and technical for the RNLAF's preferences, which had sought a simpler aircraft with outstanding manoeuvrability. An additional blow was struck by the German requirement reduced from an initial 600 aircraft to 324 in 1972.|$|E

After this, the Organic Laws were replaced with the Organic Act of 1845, which altered the legislature in several ways. First the number of representatives was increased to include a minimum of 13 and a maximum of 61. Second, the name was changed to the House of Representatives. All members of the body were to be elected by popular vote with vacancies filled using special elections. The body also received new powers to impeach any civil official by a 3/4ths vote, apportion the legislators among the districts, create post offices, levy taxes, declare war, organize and call out the militia, create lower courts, pass laws concerning the general welfare of the region, regulate trade with the Native Americans, regulate liquor sale <b>and</b> <b>manufacture,</b> and regulate the police power of the government, among other powers.

5|$|The player {{assumes the}} role of a young chocolatier in 1880, during the Victorian era. The game has two modes of play: story and free play. Story mode {{involves}} a number of quests, including delivering specific chocolates and restoring the fictional Baumeister chocolate empire to its former glory. The player is enlisted by Evangeline Baumeister to rebuild the Baumeister chocolate empire which has been ruined by Evangeline's younger sister who scattered chocolate recipes around the world. The player must locate the 64 lost recipes, visit 14 different cities around the globe, purchase 6 closed Baumeister factories, establish business relationships with outlets and suppliers, <b>and</b> <b>manufacture</b> chocolates to keep in business. Free play mode allows the player to travel, manufacture, and trade without undertaking quests. This mode starts the player {{with a small amount of}} cash and all chocolate recipes unlocked for use. In story mode, players begin with a single factory and a recipe for simple chocolate bars, the player must visit the market to purchase ingredients and begin the manufacturing process.|$|E
5|$|To {{give the}} paratroops some {{artillery}} support, Lieutenant Colonel Alan Blyth of the 2/4th Field Regiment proposed dropping {{some of its}} eight short 25-pounders by parachute. A call went out for volunteers and four officers and 30 other ranks were selected. On 30 August, Vasey watched them carry out a practice jump at Rogers Airfield. This {{turned out to be}} the easy part. Brand new guns were received from the 10th Advanced Ordnance Depot at Port Moresby on 23 August. Two were handed over for training while, as a precaution, the remaining six were sent the 2/117th Field Workshops for inspection and checking. All six were condemned, owing to a number of serious defects in assembly <b>and</b> <b>manufacture.</b> On 30 August, the gunners received orders to move out the next day, so the 2/51st Light Aid Detachment cannibalised six guns to produce two working guns, which were proofed by firing 20 rounds per gun. Only one was ready in time to leave with the gunners so the other followed on a special flight. Eight of the 2/4th Field Regimentâs Mark II 25-pounders were also condemned owing to the presence of filings in the buffer system. Vasey was less than impressed.|$|E
