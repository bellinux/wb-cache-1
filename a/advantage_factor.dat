40|$|PhD (Tourism Management), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 The tourism {{industry}} {{is an extremely}} competitive industry which is mainly caused by the ever changing needs of tourists. However, despite the constant change in tourist behaviour, violent terrorist attacks on countries across the globe and the weakening of the world economies, the {{tourism industry}} showed significant growth {{over the last few}} decades. The fast growth rate of tourism has also lead to the tourist being more aware of ecotourism destinations and the key role these destinations play in conserving the natural and cultural environments in the midst of globalisation and urbanisation. The pressure on ecotourism destinations such as national parks is increasing as more and more natural land are being taken up for urban development. In the case of South African National Parks (SANParks), the decrease in government funding pressurizes the resources and national parks have to identify ways to generate their own income through tourism activities. SANParks manages 22 national parks across South Africa with the aim to conserve South Africa’s biodiversity, provide recreational activities for tourists and build long-term relationships with the local communities to enhance the communities’ quality of life. Hence, in order to remain competitive it is important to determine the parks' competitive advantages. Therefore the aim {{of this study was to}} develop a competitiveness model for SANParks by using the Kruger National Park as case study. The Kruger National Park is not only one of the largest and most recognised national parks in the world, but also boasts with a large variety of fauna and flora, variety of accommodation facilities such as bush lodges, chalets and camping facilities as well as various tourist activities. The literature review indicated that destinations differ from each other and therefore ecotourism destinations such as national parks would have a distinct set of competitive <b>advantage</b> <b>factors.</b> However, these factors can only be determined if the needs of tourists are anticipated and park specific products and services are developed to satisfy the needs of visitors to the park and ultimately lead to tourist loyalty. Once a competitive position has been established, a national park can obtain benefits such as an increase in tourist numbers and revenue delivery of high quality products and services at the park as well as trigger a higher quality of life for the local community. If managed accordingly, the park might experience sustainable growth as well as increased profit margins. The data for the study was collected by means of a questionnaire survey at four of the Kruger National Park's rest camps during the period 26 December 2013 and 4 January 2014 which is the festive season in South Africa. The rest camps that were included in this survey were Olifants (74 questionnaires); Skukuza (213 questionnaires); Lower Sabie (98 questionnaires) and Berg-&-Dal (51 questionnaires). A total of 436 completed questionnaires were administered and further analysed. Descriptive statistics were used to profile the respondents while two factor analyses were done on the competitive <b>advantage</b> <b>factors</b> and tourist motives for travelling to the Park. The factor analyses identified five competitive <b>advantage</b> <b>factors</b> of which Wildlife Experiences and Marketing and Branding were regarded as the most important factors. The other three competitive <b>advantage</b> <b>factors</b> were Accommodation and Retail, Visitor Management and Suprastructure and Amenities. Four motivational factors were identified namely Experience and Relaxation, Lifestyle, All-Inclusive Destination and Value. The identified factors were further used in an ANOVA analysis and the results showed that socio-demographic characteristics such as home language, province of residence, level of education and marital status have all significant differences based on the five competitive <b>advantage</b> <b>factors</b> as well as the four motivational factors The t-test analysis presented a few statistical significant differences between the independent variables or group of individuals. These differences were based on the respondents’ demographic and behaviour characteristics with regards to the competitive <b>advantage</b> and motivational <b>factors.</b> However, the strongest statistically significant differences were based on the behavioural characteristics of tourists travelling with children to the Park, Wild card holders, tourist reading magazines, previous visits to the Park and differences between tourists making use of chalets and camping facilities. A Structural Equation Model was applied to confirm the results that were obtained from the analyses. The SEM indicated that tourists’ motivations have a significant influence on the factors that tourists identified as competitive <b>advantage</b> <b>factors</b> for the Kruger National Park. This research made three distinct new contributions. Firstly, competitive <b>advantage</b> <b>factors</b> were specifically identified for ecotourism based destinations such as national parks from a demand side. Also, the tourists motivation for travelling proved to hugely influence these competitive <b>advantage</b> <b>factors.</b> Secondly, a competitiveness model was developed specifically for national parks within South Africa. The proposed model could assist national parks across South Africa to obtain a competitive advantage among its competitors based on park specific factors. Lastly, the concept of competitiveness has not yet been applied within the ecotourism and nature-based tourism destinations context. This study described the concept of competitiveness with the focus on national parks as ecotourism destinations and the aspects that need to be taken into consideration when analysing the concept in such a context.

AOTF in the wavelength range above 2 μm could be impractical due to the λ 2 and interaction length dependencies on acoustic field intensity to achieve peak diffraction efficiency. A potential solution to reduce the RF power requirement for full diffraction efficiency is to realize a resonant acoustic cavity, and "recycle" the phonons. This configuration could give a theoretical <b>advantage</b> <b>factor</b> between 4 and 10. A prototype device with an operational wavelength range between 1 μm and 2 μm has been designed and tested and an optimized design to operate between 2 μm - 4 μm has been prepared and under construction. Due {{to the presence of}} standing wave, when the device is not in resonance a feedback signal from the device is affecting the electrical matching and the power delivered to the device is mostly reflected back (VSWR > 25), therefore a special RF driver is required in order to maintain in resonance the device. The resonance frequencies are also affected by the temperature of the device, thus a temperature control mechanism with high accuracy is required. We present the preliminary results of the first prototype, which are in good agreement with the mathematical model and an <b>advantage</b> <b>factor</b> of about 4 has been measured.

For power generation applications, it ideally combines the efficiency benefit offered by low dimensional systems along with the high power output advantage offered by bulk systems. In this work, we uncover a few crucial details about how to embed nanowires and nanoflakes in a bulk matrix so that an overall advantage over pure bulk may be achieved. First and foremost, we point out that a performance degradation with respect to bulk is inevitable as the nanostructure transitions to a multi moded one.

Competitive <b>advantage</b> <b>factors</b> correspond to three aspects: agro-food firms internal sources called, in this study, Potential Resources (RP); agro-food firms relationships with other firms, which are called Specific Firms Relationships (RE); and, the market and industry characteristics plus the industrial localisation, which are included in the so called Market Structure and Industry Location (EMI). Seven hypotheses have been formulated to asses direct and indirect relationships between RP, RE, EMI and economic Results (R) specifying causality directions between explicative indicators for each competitive factor. The seven hypotheses have been combined in a hypothetical model with structural equations defining firms’ competitiveness. A sample of 294 firms has been used and 17 variables related to competitive advantages have been selected. Indicators related to Potential Resources refer to technological levels, development of new products as well as promotion and advertising activities. Agro-food firms’ relationships are taken into account introducing variables accounting for relationships with suppliers, distributors and other firms. The Market Structure and Industry are taken into account considering the concentration degree of the food distribution firms, entry of new firms into the market and product prices, among others. Results have been measured with indicators measuring investment over sales, added value and export intensity. Results indicate that Potential Resources and the Specific Firms Relationships explain better the variability of the Results with a strong relationship between those two groups of variables.

Methods: An approach based on the linear-quadratic (LQ) model, which {{is currently}} used in conventional radiotherapy, is advanced for treatment planning in RIT. This approach incorporates repair rates, radio-sensitivity of the tissues, biologic half-lives of the antibodies, physical half-lives of the radionuclides, dose rates and total doses needed for a given biologically effective dose.

The calculations are performed using a structural measure developed by Lundberg & Wiker (1997) that relates the average factor input requirements in exports relative to those in imports. We find the calculations highly dependent on measurement practice when performing those on a cross-section for a single year. However, when calculating the human capital content of trade over time instead, the inclusion of service sectors in the trade vector as well as variable factor input requirements {{seem to be very}} important. This paper then continues with an empirical evaluation of the human capital content of Swedish trade in 1986 - 2000. We find that during the period 1986 - 1992, the average human capital intensity in exports relative to imports was slightly increasing, mirroring an increased specialization in human capital-intensive production. After 1992, though, there is a rapid decrease in the human capital content of trade in exports relative to imports. In 1995 there is a recovery, but the recovery seems both to be leveling out and turning down in the late 1990 's.
