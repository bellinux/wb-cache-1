The residents of all communities involved voted in favour of incorporation as a rural community with the exception of Lac Baker's residents, thereby defeating the proposal.|$|E

5|$|However, Ruiz died in Valparaíso, Chile {{soon after}} his arrival in the country. He {{reportedly}} had uremia and a urethral obstruction, both of which deteriorated into Fournier gangrene, which killed him soon after. Later speculation that Ruiz had been poisoned or killed has been countered by three facts: that Ruiz's brother, Mariano Ruiz Quiñones (who was the coordinator of the revolution in Curaçao), died of the same condition soon after (suggesting a genetic predisposition to it), that Betances had used a catheter on Ruiz before he left Saint Thomas to bring him some relief from his condition, and that Betances published a medical article in France twenty years later, in 1887, that discussed the condition, out {{of what he had}} described <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>years</b> of second-guessing what could have been done to save Ruiz's life.|$|E

He subsequently top-scored for Scotland in a first-class match against the touring New Zealanders. In seven appearances for Somerset during the seasons, Mitchell-Innes was unable to replicate the form he had shown with Oxford, and only passed fifty run in an innings once, scoring 135 runs at an average of under ten.|$|E
5|$|The clubs {{had met in}} an FA Cup final before – in 1979, when Arsenal won 3–2. Manchester United were {{appearing}} in their 17th FA Cup Final, their second in <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>years,</b> and had won the FA Cup on 11 of their previous 16 appearances (including beating Milwall in the 2004 final). Two of these victories had yielded a domestic double (in 1994 and 1996) and in 1999 they had won the FA Cup {{as part of a}} unique Treble, consisting of the cup, the Premier League and the UEFA Champions League.

He broke the record in the final game with three touchdowns against the Steelers, three days after being named NFL MVP by the AP. The Giants {{led the league in}} scoring by a wide margin, and {{for the third time in}} <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>years</b> clinched the Eastern Conference title. The Western champions were George Halas' Chicago Bears. The teams met in the 1963 NFL Championship Game at Wrigley Field. In the second quarter, Tittle injured his knee on a tackle by Larry Morris, and required a novocaine shot at halftime to continue playing. After holding a 10–7 halftime lead, The Giants were shutout in the second half, during which Tittle threw four interceptions. Playing through the knee injury, he completed 11 of 29 passes in the game for 147 yards, a touchdown, and five interceptions as the Bears won 14–10.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} match, Moyes gave United their 20th Community Shield {{and his first}} trophy as United manager; however, after failing to lead the club to Champions League qualification, he was sacked {{before the end of}} his first season, with Ryan Giggs taking {{temporary}} charge for the final four games of the 2013–14 season where the club finished seventh, their lowest league finish since the establishment of the Premier League. Netherlands manager Louis van Gaal was appointed as Moyes' permanent replacement on 19 May 2014, taking charge {{after the end of the}} 2014 FIFA World Cup. In his inaugural season, United signed many prominent players and returned to the Champions League with a 4th-place finish. In his second season, United finished in 5th place behind Manchester City, out of Champions League position, but won the 2016 FA Cup, the club's first in a dozen years. The board, however, decided that not enough progress had been made from the previous season and Van Gaal was sacked on 23 May 2016, just days after lifting the cup. He was replaced by two-time European champion and former Chelsea boss José Mourinho on 27 May 2016. Mourinho became United's fourth manager (including Giggs) in <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>years</b> since Ferguson's retirement.|$|E
5|$|Taylor {{held out}} of {{training}} camp before the 1990 season, demanding a new contract with a salary of $2 million per year. Talks dragged into September with neither side budging, and as the season approached Taylor received fines {{at the rate of}} $2,500 dollars a day. He signed a three-year $5 million contract (making him the highest paid defensive player in the league) just four days before the season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles. Despite sitting out training camp and the preseason, Taylor recorded three sacks and a forced fumble against the Eagles. He finished with 10.5 sacks and earned his 10th Pro Bowl in <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>years,</b> although the season marked the first time in Taylor's career that he was not selected to the All-Pro team. The Giants started out 10 – 0 and finished with a 13–3 record. In the playoffs, the Giants defeated the Bears 31–3, and faced the rival 49ers in the NFC Championship Game. They won 15–13, after Taylor recovered a key fumble late in the game to set up Matt Bahr's game-winning field goal. In Super Bowl XXV, they played the Buffalo Bills and won one of the more entertaining Super Bowls in history, 20-19, after Buffalo's Scott Norwood missed a potential game-winning field goal as time expired.|$|E

It made its network television debut in November later that year: NBC paid $5 million for a one-off airing, and it was broadcast in two parts on successive evenings. It became at that time the highest-rated television program ever presented on a single network, watched by 47.5 percent of the households sampled in America, and 65 percent of television viewers, still the record for the highest rated film to ever air on television. In 1978, CBS signed a deal worth $35 million to broadcast the film twenty times over <b>as</b> <b>many</b> <b>years.</b> Turner Entertainment acquired the MGM film library in 1986, but the deal did not include the television rights to Gone with the Wind, which were still held by CBS.

It was used to launch two cable channels owned by Turner Broadcasting System: Turner Network Television (1988) and Turner Classic Movies (1994). It debuted on videocassette in March 1985, where it placed second in the sales charts, and has since been released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc formats.|$|E
