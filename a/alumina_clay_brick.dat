For this purpose, agricultural wastes (sugarcane bagasse ash (SBA) and rice husk ash (RHA)) were acquired from a sugar industry and a <b>brick</b> kiln. Burnt <b>clay</b> <b>bricks</b> were manufactured in an industrial kiln by incorporating SBA and RHA in various dosages (i. e. 5 %, 10 % and 15 %) by clay weight. Physico-mechanical and thermal properties of brick specimens incorporating agricultural wastes were studied. It was observed that lighter weight bricks can be produced using agricultural wastes, which are helpful in reducing both the cost and overall weight of the structure. Addition of agricultural wastes in burnt <b>clay</b> <b>bricks</b> resulted into reduced compressive strength. However, brick specimens incorporating SBA and RHA up to 15 % satisfied the minimum requirement for compressive strength according to different standards for masonry construction.

40|$|<b>Brick</b> <b>clay</b> deposits, in {{the area}} north of Cape Town, were formed {{as a result of}} three {{independent}} geological processes. The intrusion of the syn- to post tectonic granitoids into micaceous (indicated by the absence of halloysite; Orris, 1998), feldspathic Malmesbury sandstone beds, approximately 500 Ma ago, created a hydrothermal vein structure, which enriched the shale with feldspar/kaolinite and quartz, restricted to the vein network. This was followed by extensive in-situ weathering of these hydrothermally altered rocks resulting in residual kaolin deposits, the effects of which were more pronounced along the more permeable shear zones. The final process, formation of ball clay deposits, initiated by the erosion of the primary kaolinite deposits, which have been transported in water, together with organic material, to shallow depressions where <b>clays</b> were deposited. <b>Brick</b> <b>clay</b> is exclusively used for the manufacturing of <b>clay</b> <b>brick</b> products and must derive its value from the sales revenue generated from these products. Evidence from the two exploration programs described, suggests that the clay deposits explored has no value as individual deposits as the clay from both deposits lack specific ceramic properties to successfully manufacture <b>clay</b> <b>bricks.</b> It is however clear that if the clay from the two deposits is mixed in specific proportions; body mixes with ceramic properties suitable for light coloured <b>clay</b> face <b>brick</b> manufacturing is possible. The value of the beneficiated product, <b>clay</b> <b>bricks,</b> may then be used to determine the value of both clay deposits. Discounted Cash Flow Models (DCFM) and Net Present Values (NPV) were used to determine the fundamental value of the clay deposits explored, as it determines the time value of money (Kernot, 1999).
