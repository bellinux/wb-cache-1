5|$|The {{calculations}} that {{purported to}} show that bumblebees cannot fly are based upon a simplified linear treatment of oscillating <b>aerofoils.</b> The method assumes small amplitude oscillations without flow separation. This ignores the effect of dynamic stall (an airflow separation inducing a large vortex above the wing), which briefly produces several times the lift of the aerofoil in regular flight. More sophisticated aerodynamic analysis shows the bumblebee can fly because its wings encounter dynamic stall in every oscillation cycle.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel miniature wind generator for wireless sensing applications. The generator {{consists of an}} <b>aerofoil</b> that {{is attached to a}} cantilever spring. The airflow over the <b>aerofoil</b> causes the cantilever to bend, the degree of bending being a function of the lift force from the <b>aerofoil</b> and the spring constant. As the cantilever deflects, the flow of air is reduced by a bluff body and the lift force therefore decreases causing the cantilever to spring back. The <b>aerofoil</b> is hence exposed to the full airflow again and the cycle is repeated. When the frequency of the movement matches the resonant frequency of the structure, the <b>aerofoil</b> has the maximum displacement. A permanent magnet is fixed on the <b>aerofoil</b> and a coil is attached {{to the base of the}} generator. The movement of the <b>aerofoil</b> causes the magnetic flux cutting the coil to change, which generates electrical power. The device has dimensions of 12 cm × 8 cm × 6. 5 cm. Experiments have shown that the generator can operate at wind speeds as low as 2. 5 m•s^- 1 with a corresponding electrical output power of 470 uW.

The time-averaged flow around an NACA- 0012 <b>aerofoil</b> at incidence is then investigated {{in terms of its}} response to very low-amplitude hydrodynamic and acoustic perturbations. Flow fields obtained from both two- and three-dimensional simulations are investigated, for which the <b>aerofoil</b> flow exhibits a laminar separation bubble.

Some simulation for a 2 D <b>aerofoil</b> simulation was studied.

40|$|Using {{the design}} {{requirements}} of Remotely Piloted Vehicles (RPV's), selected for wind tunnel testing over the Reynolds number range 3 x 105 to 1 x 106. The first <b>aerofoil,</b> NACA 643 - 418, showed a degradation of performance {{in terms of}} lift-to-drag ratio as the Reynolds number was reduced. There was also a laminar separation bubble of notable extent on both {{the upper and lower}} surfaces at most incidences throughout the Reynolds number range. The second <b>aerofoil,</b> Göttingen 797, had good performance in terms of lift-to-drag ratio and maximum lift coefficient, even at the lowest Reynolds number. This was attributed to the flat bottom of the <b>aerofoil,</b> which allowed the formation of extensive laminar flow on the lower surface without the formation of a laminar separation bubble. The third <b>aerofoil,</b> Wortmann FX 63 - 137, generally exhibited the best aerodynamic performance in terms of maximum values of both lift-to-drag ratio and lift coefficient, throughout the Reynolds number range considered. Four alternative lower surface geometries for this <b>aerofoil</b> were also tested. The modifications reduced the maximum values of both the lift coefficient and lift-to- drag ratio of the original <b>aerofoil</b> throughout the Reynolds number range, but generally improved the lift-to-drag ratios at low values of lift coefficient.
