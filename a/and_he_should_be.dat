Murray was initially reluctant to accept the offer, and on being asked why, replied that the nature of the service was such, as very frequently terminated in disagreement between the admiral and the captain; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> extremely unwilling to hazard any possible thing that should diminish the regard and respect which he should ever entertain for his lordship.|$|E

Highgate was his patch <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> celebrated {{because he was}} a very good, brilliant, funny, nice, wise, kind man, who occasionally drank too much."

[...] The Chinese Foreign Ministry responded by accusing US lawmakers of possessing an [...] "arrogant and unreasonable attitude" [...] and [...] "lacking respect for China's judicial sovereignty." [...] Ahead of the award ceremony, Barack Obama said [...] "Mr Liu Xiaobo is far more deserving of this award than I was... reminds us that human dignity also depends upon the advance of democracy, open society, {{and the rule of}} law...

500|$|Lawless {{is able to}} play as a {{right or}} left midfielder, a central midfielder and a right-back. While being equally {{comfortable}} playing at any of these positions, he prefers {{to play in a}} midfield role. He has also played in the hole and has given a composed performance as a second striker. His play as a right midfielder is [...] "skilful" [...] and he has been described as being [...] "comfortable on the ball, a good passer, mobile and with an eye for goal". Stevenage Borough manager Graham Westley described him as a player [...] "who impresses me with his consistency". After signing for York, manager Martin Foyle said [...] "He is a great all rounder, a technically good footballer and has a very professional attitude towards the game." [...] His partnership with Neil Barrett in the central midfield for York drew praise from teammate Richard Brodie, who said [...] "The midfield two worked really well together and picked up the second balls. Alex Lawless was flawless <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> playing in the Football League".|$|E
500|$|The film {{subsequently}} found {{local support}} in Germany. Director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck saw that Cruise's involvement would promote awareness of a neglected story, and veteran German actor Armin Mueller-Stahl also gave his {{support to the}} production. A grandson of Colonel von Stauffenberg, who appeared in the film as an assistant, hailed Cruise's professionalism and indicated {{that most of his}} family were curious to see the finished product. In September 2007, when the Defence Ministry initially denied permission for filming at the Bendlerblock memorial, support for the film came in from German newspaper columnists and filmmakers, including director Wolfgang Petersen and Frank Schirrmacher, journalist and co-publisher of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. Schirrmacher visited the set and agreed that the film would advance global awareness of the German Resistance. Ultimately granting access to the Bendlerblock after reviewing the script, the Defence Ministry said it showed that [...] "barbarism didn't triumph but led to the founding of a democratic Germany". Ursula Caberta, {{who is in charge of}} a German government office which monitors Scientology, was disappointed in the ministry's decision, saying, [...] "Tom Cruise [...] a figurehead of an anti-constitutional organization, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> treated that way." ...|$|E
500|$|Problems arose during Tilley's {{administration}} {{because of}} conflicting Samoan and American laws. In one case, a native had caught and eaten a skipjack, a sacred fish which {{could only be}} eaten {{with the permission of}} a local chief under Samoan law. Traditional punishment decreed that the offender's house should be burned down and his crops uprooted, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> exiled from the territory. The native challenged his punishment under the American legal system, however, resulting in the arrest of the chief responsible for ordering the destruction of his property. The chief was sentenced to a year of house arrest in a criminal proceeding, on which Tilley sat as judge, and he was ordered to pay compensation for the destroyed property. There were similar issues with Samoan customs not blending well with the newly introduced American political divisions in the territory. For example, the territory's three district governors had equal authority but they were of differing Samoan social status. This disparity made decision-making more difficult and caused social tensions. Despite these problems, Tilley was well-considered by the locals. On December 18, 1900, the local chiefs sent a letter of congratulations on the re-election of President McKinley in which they said of Tilley, [...] "you gave us a leader, a Governor, a High Chief, whom we have learned to love and respect".|$|E

500|$|This {{crossover}} occurred {{through the}} Simpsons episode [...] "A Star Is Burns" [...] (1995). Groening was not {{fond of the}} crossover, publicly citing it as a thirty-minute advertisement for The Critic. Brooks said, [...] "for years, Al and Mike were two guys who worked their hearts out on this show, staying up until 4 {{in the morning to}} get it right. The point is, Matt's name has been on Mike's and Al's scripts and he has taken plenty of credit for a lot of their great work. In fact, he is the direct beneficiary of their work. The Critic is their shot <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> giving them his support." [...] Reiss stated that he was a [...] "little upset" [...] by Groening's actions and that [...] "this taints everything at the last minute. [...] This episode doesn't say 'Watch The Critic all over it." [...] Jean added [...] "What bothers me about all of this, is that now people may get the impression that this Simpsons episode is less than good. It stands on its own even if The Critic never existed." [...] On Fox, The Critic was again short-lived, broadcasting ten episodes before its cancellation. A total of only 23 episodes were produced, and it returned briefly in 2000 with a series of ten Internet broadcast webisodes. The series has since developed a cult following thanks to reruns on Comedy Central and its complete series release on DVD.|$|E
500|$|Former showrunners Jean and Reiss {{had left}} to produce their own series, The Critic, along with The Simpsons co-creator Brooks. The Critic was a {{short-lived}} animated series that revolved around the life of movie critic Jay Sherman. For the second season of The Critic, Brooks {{cut a deal with}} the Fox network to have the series switch over. The episode [...] "A Star Is Burns" [...] was pitched by Brooks, who had wanted a crossover that would help launch The Critic on Fox, and he thought having a film festival in Springfield would {{be a good way to}} introduce Sherman. In addition, Jean and Reiss returned to produce two episodes ("A Star is Burns" [...] and [...] "'Round Springfield") with the staff of The Critic, to relieve some of the stress on The Simpsons writing staff. Groening felt that the crossover was a thirty-minute advertisement for another show and blamed Brooks, calling it an attempt to get attention for one of his unsuccessful shows. After unsuccessful attempts to get the episode pulled, he decided to go public with his concerns shortly before the episode aired and had his name removed from the credits. In response, Brooks said, [...] "for years, Al [...] and Mike [...] were two guys who worked their hearts out on this show, staying up until 4 in the morning to get it right. The point is, Matt's name has been on Mike's and Al's scripts and he has taken plenty of credit for a lot of their great work. In fact, he is the direct beneficiary of their work.

500|$|Bond {{joined the}} Bomb Squad, newly formed in January 1971 due to concern over The Angry Brigade. Bond became the unit's first {{commander}} on 23 June 1971, being promoted to that position in 1969. The unit served at Tintagel House, and Bond's name was theoretically {{meant to be}} kept secret <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> called 'Commander X', {{so that he was}} not bombed, but journalists have since claimed to have known his name within days of his appointment. The press lauded Commander X as a [...] "mystery supremo to hunt down the Angry Brigade." [...] The Angry Brigade was a new political group; [...] "a small group [...] of leftwing radicals and anarchists," [...] who claimed responsibility for about 20 small bombings which began on 20 November 1970, with the bombing of a BBC van. At its formation, the Bomb Squad comprised around 30 men, one third from CID, the rest from Special Branch. The Angry Brigade's decline came in 1971, when various conspirators were arrested. At the 1971–72 trial, the nine conspirators were denied bail at Clerkenwell Court after Bond opposed the move, and the judge, J Purcell, [...] "remanded all nine in custody for a week." [...] There were concerns that the police had [...] "over-reached themselves." [...] The Angry Brigade member John Barker later said that [...] "the police framed a guilty man," [...] and Bond was called an [...] "old-fashioned plod" [...] by a defendant. He told the Purcell that [...] "I am quite certain that, sooner or later, we would have had somebody killed." [...] Due to his success, in 1972 he was awarded the Queen's Police Medal and promoted to Deputy Assistant Commissioner (Operations).|$|E

Ramallah Mayor Janet Mikhail announced later that Darwish would be buried next to Ramallah's Palace of Culture, at the summit of a hill overlooking Jerusalem on the southwestern outskirts of Ramallah, and a shrine would be erected in his honor.

2500|$|In {{order to}} {{encourage}} construction of modern rather than pseudo-Gothic style churches, the Bishop compiled {{a set of}} canonical principles of church architecture, which were {{a set of rules}} ensuring certain aspects of Anglican church designs remained constant while allowing architects to exercise their creativity. These principles prescribed such things as setting aside a third of the church for the sanctuary and two thirds for the nave, the proportions of steps leading up to the altar, and that furnishings be designed by the architect. All new Anglican churches were to be individual and contemporary in design, for, as Shevill himself put it: [...] "God is no museum piece <b>and</b> <b>He</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> worshipped by modern people in modern buildings which are aesthetically pleasing and cool". By 1958, six new permanent Anglican churches and a chapel had been completed according to these principles.|$|E

Mohammed Qadir agrees that he must be executed: [...] "According to Islamic law he should be sentenced to death because Christianity is forbidden in our land". Abdul Rahman's neighbor remarked: [...] "there is no way we are going to allow an Afghan to insult us by becoming Christian." [...] Religious intellectual Shahnawaz Farooqui, speaking on Abdul Rahman's conversion, said [...] "he will have to be executed… If somebody at one point affirms the truth and then rejects it or denies it, it would jeopardize the whole paradigm of truth. This is such a big offense that the penalty can only be death. At the very most, some scholars argue that the person should be given time to rethink, and if he embraces Islam again, he will be forgiven." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hargrave was an {{excellent}} experimenter and his models were well crafted.
