5|$|After {{the release}} of Shoulder Arms, Chaplin {{requested}} more money from First National, which was refused.

The arrangement was revolutionary in the film industry, as it enabled the four partners – all creative artists – to personally fund their pictures and have complete control. Chaplin was eager to start with the new company and offered to buy out his contract with First National. They declined this and insisted that he complete the final six films he owed them.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they were}} renowned for their polite behavior, the courtesans {{were known to}} {{dominate}} the conversation amongst elite men, and were not afraid to openly castigate or criticize prominent male guests who talked {{too much or too}} loudly, boasted too much of their accomplishments, or had in some way ruined dinner for everyone by rude behavior (on one occasion a courtesan even beat up a drunken man who had insulted her). When singing to entertain guests, courtesans not only composed the lyrics to their own songs, but they popularized a new form of lyrical verse by singing lines written by various renowned <b>and</b> <b>famous</b> men in Chinese history.|$|E

5|$|Hotel Valley Ho is a {{historic}} hotel in Scottsdale, Arizona. Also called the Valley Ho and, for 28 years, the Ramada Valley Ho, the hotel was originally designed by Edward L.

Though initially proposed by Varney, a central tower of guest rooms, rising over the lobby, was not built.|$|E
5|$|Janáček always deeply admired Antonín Dvořák, {{to whom he}} {{dedicated}} some of his works. He rearranged part of Dvořák's Moravian Duets for mixed choir with original piano accompaniment. In {{the early}} years of the 20th century, Janáček became increasingly interested in the music of other European composers. His opera Destiny was a response to another significant <b>and</b> <b>famous</b> work in contemporary Bohemia – Louise, by the French composer Gustave Charpentier. The influence of Giacomo Puccini is apparent particularly in Janáček's later works, for example in his opera Káťa Kabanová. Although he carefully observed developments in European music, his operas remained firmly connected with Czech and Slavic themes.|$|E
