5|$|Favoured soils <b>are</b> <b>deep</b> grey sandy loams or {{shallower}} sand overlying claypan. Associated vegetation {{is typically}} scrubland or shrubland, although moisture-loving trees such as B.littoralis (Swamp Banksia) or Melaleuca preissiana (Moonah) {{may also be}} present, sometimes in sufficient numbers to form a low open woodland.|$|E
5|$|The soils in {{the valley}} of Muncy Creek <b>are</b> <b>deep</b> but {{relatively}} poor. However, farming was done {{in the valley}} in the late 1800s and still is as of the late 1900s. The valley has forested hills on either side. The Morris-Oquaga-Wellsboro soil series is found along the creek in Sullivan County.|$|E
5|$|Except for the partly {{at-grade}} Bishan MRT Station (North South Line), {{the entirety}} of the MRT is elevated or underground. Most below-ground stations <b>are</b> <b>deep</b> and hardened enough to withstand conventional aerial bomb attacks and to serve as bomb shelters. Mobile phone and 3G service is available in every part of the network. Underground stations and the trains themselves are air-conditioned, while above-ground stations have ceiling fans installed.|$|E
50|$|Some of the {{underground}} stations on the line <b>are</b> significantly <b>deeper</b> than the others. Tsim Sha Tsui and Admiralty stations <b>are</b> <b>deeper</b> because they precede harbour crossings. Admiralty and Central <b>are</b> <b>deeper</b> they provide cross-platform interchange with the deep-level Island Line.|$|R

5|$|Gom bian (also {{known as}} 光饼 or Kompia) — a Foochow {{delicacy}} made with flour, baked in an oven and eaten either {{with or without}} meat and gravy. It is somewhat similar to a bagel. However, it can be either in a crisp or soft version. Traditional soft kompia dipped in pork sauce can be sought from Chung Hua road and the Sunday Market at Pedada road. There <b>are</b> <b>deep</b> fried variations available throughout the town of Sibu.|$|E
5|$|Gunshot wounds are the commonest form of {{penetrating}} {{trauma that}} cause TBI. Less commonly, knife wounds and shrapnel from motor vehicle accidents can also penetrate the airways. Most injuries to the trachea {{occur in the}} neck, because the airways within the chest <b>are</b> <b>deep</b> and therefore well protected; however, up to a quarter of TBI resulting from penetrating trauma occurs within the chest. Injury to the cervical trachea usually affects the anterior (front) part of the trachea.|$|E
5|$|The Marcellus {{is easily}} eroded, {{and is also}} found {{underlying}} low areas between some Appalachian ridges, forming linear valleys of moderate relief. These bedrock surfaces are typically covered with colluvium from erosion of stratigraphically higher and more erosion-resistant strata that form the surrounding higher ground. The soils formed from the Marcellus and the overlying Hamilton shales <b>are</b> <b>deep,</b> free of stones, and well suited for agriculture.|$|E

She would rather die than own the truth; and she hoped, by a little reflection, to fortify herself beyond betraying it.|$|R
5|$|The {{king vulture}} soars for hours effortlessly, only {{flapping}} its wings infrequently. While in flight, its wings are held flat with slightly raised tips, {{and from a}} distance the vulture can appear to be headless while in flight. Its wing beats <b>are</b> <b>deep</b> and strong. Birds have been observed engaging in tandem flight on two occasions in Venezuela by naturalist Marsha Schlee, who has proposed {{it could be a}} part of courtship behaviour.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle toe}} is greatly elongated, and the hind one is only {{slightly}} developed, while the talons of all the toes are comparatively straight and blunt. The feet are thus more adapted to walking, and are of little use as weapons or organs of prehension as in birds of prey and Old World vultures. The beak is hooked, and adapted to tear rotting meat. The irises of the male are brown, while those of the female <b>are</b> <b>deep</b> red. The eyelids lack eyelashes. Contrary to the usual rule for sexual dimorphism among birds of prey, the female is smaller than the male.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{conditions}} associated with thrombophilia <b>are</b> <b>deep</b> vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), which {{are referred to}} collectively as venous thromboembolism (VTE). DVT usually occurs in the legs, and is characterized by pain, swelling and redness of the limb. It may lead to long-term swelling and heaviness due to damage to valves in the veins. The clot may also break off and migrate (embolize) to arteries in the lungs. Depending on the size {{and the location of}} the clot, this may lead to sudden-onset shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations and may be complicated by collapse, shock and cardiac arrest.|$|E

5|$|Boletus rubroflammeus is {{a species}} of bolete fungus in the family Boletaceae. First {{described}} from Michigan in 1971, it {{is found in the}} eastern United States and Mexico, where it grows in a mycorrhizal association with hardwood trees. The fruit bodies (mushrooms) of the fungus have caps that <b>are</b> <b>deep</b> red to purplish red, and dark red pores. The stem has coarse, dark red reticulations (raised, net-like ridges) and a narrow yellow area at the top. All parts of the mushroom quickly stain blue when injured or cut. Lookalikes include Boletus flammans, a lighter-colored species that grows with conifers. Other similar species can be distinguished by differences in distribution, morphology, staining reaction, and microscopic characteristics. Boletus rubroflammeus mushrooms are poisonous, and can cause gastrointestinal distress if consumed.|$|E
5|$|The B. z. zonarius and B. z. semitorquatus {{subspecies}} have a dull black head; back, rump {{and wings}} are brilliant green; throat and breast bluish-green. The {{difference between these}} two subspecies is that B. z. zonarius has a yellow abdomen while B. z. semitorquatus has a green abdomen; the latter has also a prominent crimson frontal band that the former lacks (the intermediate shown in the box has characteristics of both subspecies). The two other subspecies differ from these subspecies by the bright green crown and nape and blush cheek-patches. The underparts of B. z. barnardi are turquoise-green with an irregular orange-yellow band across the abdomen; the back and mantle <b>are</b> <b>deep</b> blackish-blue and this subspecies has a prominent red frontal band. The B. z. macgillivrayi is generally pale green, with no red frontal band, and a wide uniform pale yellow band across the abdomen.|$|E
5|$|The {{roots of}} Tephrosia apollinea <b>are</b> <b>deep,</b> {{penetrating}} soils {{to a depth}} of 3 metres or more, aiding the absorption of moisture from the soil. Moisture is stored in the cortex of the roots, which is protected by a thin periderm. Water storage in the cortex enables growth and reproduction during times of drought, which allow it to thrive in both arid and semi-arid conditions and to survive during winter and summer months at times of low rainfall. The roots grow at a faster rate than the shoots themselves, and even at the early stage of the plant displaying a shoot the length of a cm, the roots may already be 30cm or more in length.|$|E

5|$|Wake lows form due to {{adiabatic}} warming {{in the wake}} of mature squall lines at the back edge of their rain shields, where evaporative cooling is unable to offset warming due to atmospheric subsidence, or downward motion. They can be caused by gravity waves which duct through boundary layers which <b>are</b> <b>deep</b> and cold to the north of a weather front. As with mesoscale high-pressure areas behind a squall line, when new thunderstorm development stops along the squall line, the wake low will weaken as well. Clearing conditions will accompany the wake low, due to the descending warm air mass associated with the feature. Within the United States, these systems have been observed to form in the Mississippi river valley, Southeast, Florida, and Great Plains.|$|E
