The requirements for multicellularity were embedded in the genes of some of these cells, specifically choanoflagellates. These are thought to be the precursors for all multicellular organisms.

25|$|The {{celestial}} sphere has been divided into 88 constellations. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) constellations are {{areas of the}} sky. Each of these contains remarkable X-ray sources. Some of them are have been identified from astrophysical modeling to be galaxies or black holes at the centers of galaxies. Some are pulsars. As with sources already successfully modeled by X-ray astrophysics, striving to understand the generation of X-rays by the apparent source helps to understand the Sun, the universe as a whole, and how these affect us on Earth. Constellations are an astronomical device for handling observation and precision independent of current physical theory or interpretation. Astronomy has been <b>around</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time. Physical theory changes with time. With respect to celestial X-ray sources, X-ray astrophysics tends {{to focus on the}} physical reason for X-ray brightness, whereas X-ray astronomy tends to focus on their classification, order of discovery, variability, resolvability, and their relationship with nearby sources in other constellations.|$|E

500|$|The revolutionary {{faces at}} least two special problems. First, the {{transformation}} back into naked power occurs when revolutionary power has been <b>around</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> period without achieving a resolution to its key conflict. At some point, the original goal of the creed tends to be forgotten, and consequently, the fanatics of the movement change their goals and aspire toward mere domination (Russell 1938:92). Second, the revolutionary must always deal {{with the threat of}} counter-revolutionaries, and is hence faced with a dilemma: because revolutionary power must by definition think that the original revolution was justified, it [...] "cannot, logically, contend that all subsequent revolutions must be wicked" [...] (Russell 1938:87).|$|E

When Stan finds Sparky at the Big Gay Animal Sanctuary, Big Gay Al takes Stan on a boat ride through his sanctuary and gives a speech about how homosexuality has been <b>around</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time, which eventually makes Stan accept his dog's homosexuality. Meanwhile, Richard Stamos fails to hit the high note of the song at half time. Returning to the final moments of the game, Stan steps in as the quarterback, passing the ball to Kyle for a touchdown that beats the betting spread as time runs out. In his speech after the game, Stan tells the people of South Park about the Big Gay Animal Sanctuary and that [...] "it's okay to be gay". He leads the people {{to the site of the}} Sanctuary, but it has mysteriously disappeared; people's runaway gay pets, however, return. Before leaving, Big Gay Al thanks Stan for making everyone understand homosexuality. Although the Cows beat the spread, Richard Stamos appears to prove he can hit the high note that he missed earlier, triggering the bomb and killing the Middle Park team's mascot.|$|E

As he was also directing The Voyage Home, he was looking to give Whitney a larger role. By this time, she had hoped that Rand had moved over to become a counselor – an idea originally suggested by a fan. Alongside Majel Barrett as Christine Chapel, the duo were given four pages of dialogue initially which was trimmed down to one scene in the final film. Following the reappearance, Whitney was enthusiastic about returning as Rand, saying [...] "I think Janice Rand is going to be <b>around</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time, as long as they don't kill our characters off, we have a chance of constantly coming back." ...|$|E
