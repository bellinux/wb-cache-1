5|$|Alarmed at {{the popular}} appeal of Paine's Rights of Man, the king issued a {{proclamation}} against seditious writings in May 1792. Booksellers and printers bore {{the brunt of}} this law, the effects of which came to <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> the 1794 Treason Trials. Johnson testified, publicly distancing himself from Paine and Barlow, {{despite the fact that}} the defendants were received sympathetically by the juries.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1954, Australia {{recognised}} that the English Electric Canberra was becoming outdated and evaluated aircraft {{such as the}} Avro Vulcan and Handley-Page Victor as potential replacements. Political pressure for a Canberra replacement only rose to <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> 1962; at which point more modern types such as the BAC TSR-2, General Dynamics F-111C, and North American A-5 Vigilante had become available. The RAF would have transferred several V-bombers, including Vulcans, for interim use by the RAAF if they had purchased the TSR-2, but the RAAF selected the F-111C.|$|E
5|$|Crossland {{remained}} in Lancashire after his expulsion from their county side, {{playing for a}} variety of club sides; East Lancashire from 1885 to 1889, Church and Oswaldtwistle in 1890 and Colne in 1891. He also worked in a coal pit at Clayton-le-Moors. He died on 26 September 1903 in Blackburn. His burial was paid for by Lancashire County Cricket Club. Throwing in cricket came to <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> {{the early part of the}} twentieth century when the careers of a number of professional bowlers came to a close, most notably those of Lancashire's Arthur Mold, Somerset's Ted Tyler and Leicestershire's Frederic Geeson.|$|E

5|$|Encouraged by the British, 265,000 Jewish immigrants, {{mainly from}} Europe, came {{to settle in}} Palestine between 1919 and 1939. Arab {{resistance}} and violence to this influx of immigrants came to <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> 1937, and the Peel Commission recommended that two states should be formed, one Arab and one Jewish, which would divide the country between them. Then in May1939, the British restricted the number of Jewish immigrants to 75,000 in the White Paper of 1939.|$|E
5|$|The F-FDTL's {{problems}} came to <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> 2006 when {{almost half}} the force was dismissed following protests over discrimination and poor conditions. The dismissal contributed to a general collapse of both the F-FDTL and PNTL in May and forced the government to request foreign peacekeepers to restore security. The F-FDTL is currently being rebuilt with foreign assistance and has drawn up a long-term force development plan.|$|E
5|$|Amid growing French and US {{skepticism}} of {{his ability}} to provide stable rule, Diệm forced the matter to <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> April 1955. He ordered the Bình Xuyên to relinquish control of the National Police and submit to his command by integrating into the VNA or disbanding, threatening to crush them if they refused. He bribed Hòa Hảo and Cao Đài commanders into joining the VNA, gradually resulting in the defection of some commanders and their units, while others continued to lead their forces against Saigon. The Bình Xuyên defied Diệm's ultimatum. On 27 April, the VNA initiated the Battle for Saigon. After a brief but violent battle that left between 500 and 1,000 people dead and about 20,000 homeless, the Bình Xuyên were crushed. Diệm had regained both U.S. confidence and control of the police. Jubilant crowds lauded Diệm and denounced Bảo Đại, who had tried to dismiss {{him in the middle of}} the battle to prevent him from quelling the Bình Xuyên. In addition, General Paul Ely, the head of the French presence in Vietnam, tried to impede Diệm; his troops put road blocks against the VNA and gave intelligence to the Bình Xuyên.|$|E

5|$|As Jim Brown's star rose, players {{began to}} {{question}} Paul Brown's leadership and play-calling in the late 1950s. The skepticism came to <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> {{a game against the}} Giants {{at the end of the}} 1958 season in which a win or tie would have given the Browns a spot in the championship game against Ewbank's Colts. In the third quarter, the Browns drove to New York's 16-yard line with a 10–3 lead and lined up for a field goal. But Coach Brown called a timeout before Groza could make the try, which alerted the Giants to a possible fake kick. Brown indeed called a fake, and the holder stumbled as he got up to throw, ruining the play. The Giants came back to win the game by a field goal and reach the championship, while the Browns went home without a spot in the title game for the second year in a row.|$|E
5|$|Berger's evasion of Wehrmacht-imposed {{recruiting}} restrictions came to <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> June, {{when the}} Chief of the OKW Operations Staff, Generalmajor Alfred Jodl initiated {{an investigation of}} SS recruiting operations within the Reich. The result was that around 15,000 SS inductions were held up by various Wehrmacht military district headquarters. Berger became aware of Jodl's inquiry and advised Himmler that even their inquiries had underestimated his success, giving the example that the Wehrmacht believed he had exceeded the June quota for SS-Division-Totenkopf by 900 men, when in fact the true figure was 1,164. He boasted to Himmler that during the whole recruiting campaign, he had signed up 15,000 men for SS-Division-Totenkopf, when Hitler had only authorised the recruiting of 4,000 for the division in the same period. To justify his actions, Berger pointed to the fact that, just before the French surrender, Hitler had ordered the release of over-age SS reservists. In the SS-Division-Totenkopf, this meant 13,246 of the 20,000-strong formation.|$|E
5|$|By 1895 Venezuela had had {{a dispute}} with the United Kingdom about the {{territory}} of Guayana Esequiba, which Britain claimed as part of British Guiana and Venezuela saw as Venezuelan territory, for over half a century. The territorial claims were originally those of the Spanish Empire (inherited by Venezuela after its independence in 1830) and of the Dutch Empire (inherited by the United Kingdom with the acquisition of the Dutch territories of Essequibo, Demerara and Berbice in 1814), having remained unsettled over previous centuries. Over {{the course of the}} nineteenth century the British and Venezuelans had proved no more able to reach an agreement, until matters came to <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> 1895, after seven years of severed diplomatic relations.|$|E

5|$|Goebel's {{abrasive}} personality {{made him}} many political enemies, but his championing of populist causes, like railroad regulation, also won him many friends. This conflict of opinions came to <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> the Kentucky gubernatorial election of 1899. Goebel, a Democrat, divided his party with self-serving political tactics {{at a time}} when Kentucky Republicans were finally gaining strength, having elected the party's first governor four years previously. These dynamics led to a close contest between Goebel and William S. Taylor. In the politically chaotic climate that resulted, Goebel was assassinated. Everyone charged in connection with the murder was either acquitted or eventually pardoned, and the identity of his assassin remains uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Henry and Becket quickly {{disagreed}} over {{a number}} of issues, including Becket's attempts to regain control of lands belonging to the archbishopric and his views on Henry's taxation policies. The main source of conflict, however, concerned the treatment of clergy who committed secular crimes: Henry argued that the legal custom in England allowed the king to enforce justice over these clerics, while Becket maintained that only church courts could try the cases. The matter came to <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> January 1164, when Henry forced through agreement to the Constitutions of Clarendon; under tremendous pressure, Becket temporarily agreed but changed his position shortly afterwards. The legal argument was complex at the time and remains contentious.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, Ettelson became locally {{famous for}} a debate {{he had at}} Nashville's Ellis Auditorium with Scopes Trial lawyer Clarence Darrow {{on whether or not}} {{religion}} was necessary. Ettelson argued in favor, Darrow against. Friction between Ettelson and some board members came to <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> 1937, when the board discussed the issue of whether to retain him as rabbi; when invited to the meeting, he spoke briefly, then resigned. The board recommended that his tenure be put to a congregational vote at the next annual meeting, where he was re-elected in a secret ballot by a vote of 303 to 31. He took an eight-month medical leave in 1938, and Children of Israel hired Morton Cohn as assistant rabbi.|$|E

5|$|In July 1914, World War I {{broke out}} in Europe; the United States {{remained}} neutral {{for the first three}} years of the war. Tensions with Germany came to <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> early 1917 following the German unrestricted submarine warfare campaign, which sank several American merchant ships in European waters. On 6 April 1917, the United States declared war on Germany. The Connecticut-class ships initially were used for training gunners and engine room personnel that would be necessary for the rapidly expanding wartime fleet. In June 1918, New Hampshire and Louisiana were involved in a serious gunnery accident, where gunners aboard the former accidentally hit the latter, killing one and injuring several other men. The following month, Louisiana was used to test Arthur Pollen's Argo Clock, the first fire control system to use an analog computer to calculate firing solutions.|$|E

On 6 April 1917, the United States declared war on Germany. The Virginia-class ships initially were used for training gunners and engine room personnel that would be necessary for the rapidly expanding wartime fleet. Starting in September 1918, the ships began to be used as escorts for convoys bringing soldiers to France, though this duty was cut short by the Armistice with Germany signed in November. With the war over, the Virginias were used to ferry American soldiers back from France through mid-1919.|$|E
5|$|Initially the new {{government}} had little success, but in 1220 the fortunes of Henry's government began to improve. The Pope allowed Henry to be crowned for a second time, using {{a new set of}} royal regalia. The fresh coronation was intended to affirm the authority of the King; Henry promised to restore the powers of the Crown, and the barons swore that they would give back the royal castles and pay their debts to the Crown, on the threat of excommunication. Hubert, accompanied by Henry, moved into Wales to suppress Llywelyn in 1223, and in England his forces steadily reclaimed Henry's castles. The effort against the remaining recalcitrant barons came to <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> 1224 with the siege of Bedford Castle, which Henry and Hubert besieged for eight weeks; when it finally fell, almost all of the garrison were executed.|$|E

5|$|Macartney's {{omission}} {{was part}} of the most infamous disputes in Australian cricket history and led to a fracas. Australian captain and selector Clem Hill wanted to include Macartney for the Third Test, but another member of the panel, former player Peter McAlister objected and said that Hill should omit himself if he wanted Macartney to play. Tensions between the two selectors were high, and came to <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> a selection meeting ahead of the Fourth Test. McAlister criticised Hill's tactics and policies towards his bowlers, provoking an exchange of insults regarding the other's leadership ability. Hill then bloodied McAlister with a powerful blow to the nose and the ensuing brawl lasted between 10 and 20 minutes. Furniture was knocked across the room, artwork shattered and Hill had to be restrained from throwing McAlister out of the third floor window, before resigning as a selector.|$|E
5|$|Matters came to <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> 1766. During the Sejm in October of that year, Poniatowski {{attempted}} {{to push a}} radical reform, restricting the disastrous liberum veto policy. He was opposed by conservatives such as Michał Wielhorski, who were supported by the Prussian and Russian ambassadors, who threatened war if the reform was passed. The dissidents, supported by the Russians, formed a confederation, the Radom Confederation. Abandoned by the Familia, Poniatowski's reforms failed to pass at the Repnin Sejm, named after Russian ambassador Nicholas Repnin, who promised to guarantee the Golden Liberties of the Polish nobility, enshrined in the Cardinal Laws, with all the might of the Russian Empire.|$|E
5|$|Matters came to <b>a</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> 1952, {{when the}} {{mainland}} NOC (the All-China Athletic Federation), considering itself {{a continuation of}} the pre-1949 committee, wrote to the IOC stating that it desired to participate in the Helsinki Olympics to be held that year. As the Taiwanese also proposed to send a team, this conflicted with IOC rules stating that only one committee could represent a country, and both Chinese groups were unwilling to negotiate with the other, or to send a joint team. After considerable deliberation, the IOC decided that if either committee was recognized by the ISF for a sport, the committee could send athletes to participate in events in that discipline. In protest, Taiwan withdrew from the Games; the PRC sent a team to Helsinki, though it arrived ten days after the start of the Games. Brundage, president-elect when {{the decision was made to}} allow PRC athletes to compete, argued against the decision to allow mainland participation before its NOC was recognized, but he was overruled by his colleagues.|$|E
