The dewar has one vacuum jacketed valve at the inlet of the cooling loop and one at the outlet.

The flow rate of the liquid nitrogen, and hence the valve sizes and corresponding flow coefficients (C{sub v}), is deter mined by the required cooling rate of each system. The large variance between the cooling rate required for cooldown and that required for operation, and the high control resolution required, makes the selection of a valve seat and plug difficult.

40|$|Multi-port {{microchannel}} {{tubes are}} increasingly popular {{for use in}} a variety of heat transfer applications, primarily for automotive condensers and radiators, but also in a variety of refrigeration and air conditioning applications. These channels offer a greater surface area to volume ratio, providing for enhanced heat transfer over a conventional tube in many applications. Previous research has focused on characterizing the performance of such tubes for two-phase refrigerant flow. Most studies have focused on pure refrigerant flow, but in most applications, as a third viscous ???phase??? will be present in the form of lubricating oil. Much research has been done to account for the effects of increased viscosity due to the presence of oil in the flow, but the effects of viscosity in microchannels rather than larger conventional tubes remain largely unexplored. The goal {{of this study is to}} investigate the qualitative and quantitative effects of the presence of oil within the refrigerant for two-phase flow in multi-port, extruded aluminum microchannel tubes. Three techniques are used to characterize these effects. Flow visualization experiments, using a transparent test section, demonstrate the flow configuration between the ports and flow regime within individual ports. Additionally, experimental <b>adiabatic</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> and void fraction measurements ??? performed for a variety of fluids and flow conditions ??? quantitatively characterize the behavior of the refrigerant-oil mixture in two-phase flow. Experimental results demonstrate a stark change in the flow when viscosity of the liquid phase is increased. These are noted by a change in the observed flow patterns, increased pressure drop, and depressed void fraction as compared to less viscous conditions. These trends cause significant departures from the behaviors characterized in many existing predictive correlations, and present a challenge to incorporate viscosity into modified correlations.

Qualities ranging from subcooled liquid to superheated vapor were investigated. Mass fluxes ranged from 16 kg/m 2 -s (for superheated vapor) to approximately 300 kg/m 2 -s (for sub-cooled liquid). The pressure drop experiments were conducted for 10 o C and 20 o C inlet temperatures. The flow visualization experiments were conducted at a 10 o C inlet temperature. The following is the order of highest to lowest pressure drop geometries on both a mass flux and mass flow bases: chevron plate, 1 : 1 aspect ratio bumpy plate, and 2 : 1 aspect ratio bumpy plate. These trends are more pronounced on a mass flow basis. Four flow regimes were observed for the flat plate geometries investigated and are mapped out on a mass flux versus quality basis for each geometry. The chevron geometry was seen to undergo flow transitions at lower qualities and mass fluxes than the bumpy plate geometries. The kinetic energy per unit volume of the flow {{was found to have}} a strong linear relationship with pressure drop for both single-phase and two-phase flow, suggesting that inertial effects are the dominant mode of pressure drop in flat plate heat exchangers. Vapor pressure drop prediction models based on the kinetic energy of the flow are presented, which predict pressure drop within 20 %. A two-phase pressure drop model is developed, also based on kinetic energy per unit volume of the flow. A pseudo void fraction is defined in order to correlate the two-phase pressure drop to the single-phase pressure drop. The two-phase pressure drop model predicts two-phase pressure drop to within 15 % of experimental measurements. A description of and modifications to the experimental test facilities are provided.

40|$|Highlights • A {{geothermal}} system was studied {{as a modern}} analogue of epithermal Au deposits • Fluid data were combined with thermodynamic modeling and numerical simulations • Small-magnitude (Mw < 2) earthquakes can produce large drops in Au solubility • Earthquake-driven flash vaporization is more efficient than cooling and boiling • Protracted seismicity enhances Au precipitation rates in the epithermal environment Abstract Epithermal gold (Au) deposits result from {{the combination of a}} sustained flux of metal-rich fluids and an efficient precipitation mechanism. Earthquakes may trigger gold precipitation by rapid loss of fluid pressure but their efficiency and time-integrated contribution to gold endowment are poorly constrained. In order to quantify the feedbacks between earthquake-driven fracturing and gold precipitation in the shallow crust, we studied the gold-rich fluids in the active Tolhuaca {{geothermal system}}, located in the highly seismic Southern Andes of Chile. We combined temperature measurements in the deep wells with fluid inclusion data, geochemical analyses of borehole fluids and numerical simulations of coupled heat and fluid flow to reconstruct the physical and chemical evolution of the hydrothermal reservoir. The effect of seismic perturbations on fluid parameters was constrained using a thermo-mechanical piston model that simulates the suction pump mechanism occurring in dilational jogs. Furthermore, we evaluated the impact of fluid parameters on gold precipitation by calculating the solubility of gold in pressure (P) - enthalpy (H) space. The reconstructed fluid conditions at Tolhuaca indicate that single-phase convective fluids feeding the hydrothermal reservoir reach the two-phase boundary with a high gold budget (1 - 5 ppb) at saturated liquid pressures between 20 and 100 bar (210 °C < Tsat < 310 °C).

40|$|The use of {{shrouded}} pin-fin arrays {{to enhance}} heat transfer {{is a common}} occurrence in many engineering disciplines, from compact heat exchangers in the process industry, to turbine blade cooling in the aerospace industry, to system thermal management in the electronics industry. In this study, experimental methods are employed to study the effect of introducing a small clearance gap between the tips of a pin-fin array and its shroud. Three arrays consisting of tapered cylindrical pin-fins were employed for this purpose. They exhibited pin height-to-diameter ratios (H/D) of 0. 5, 0. 8 and 1. 1, and pin pitch ratios (SL/D and ST/D) of 1. 15 and 1. 3 respectively. The arrays were heated uniformly and cooled with distilled water in a closed-loop test facility. Heat transfer visualization studies were conducted using thermochromic liquid crystals to estimate convection coefficients {{as a function of}} Reynolds number (10 ^ 2 < Re < 2 x 10 ^ 4), through a range of clearances (0 to 25 percent of pin height). <b>Adiabatic</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> across the pin-fin array was also measured. In terms of pressure drop performance, the impact of tip clearance was found to be greatest at low Re, (< 5 x 10 ^ 3), with the effect being significantly diminished by Re = 1. 5 x 10 ^ 4. While the dimensionless pressure drop (f) eventually decreases with the addition of clearance, there appears to be an initial increase in f relative to the non-clearance case for clearances on the order of 5 - 10 percent of pin height. This increase was seen to be as much as 50 percent at Re on the order of 10 ^ 2. Observed heat transfer trends were somewhat mixed. In some cases, a modest increase in overall heat transfer was experienced, apparently due to the exposure of the pin tips and their associated area to the cooling fluid. Highest rates of overall heat transfer tended to occur within a clearance range of 10 to 18 percent of pin height. Local heat transfer however was generally seen to decrease. On a constant pumping power basis, the inclusion of clearance was found to generally produce higher heat transfer per unit pumping power for a dimensionless clearance (Cg/D) less than 0. 2, when compared to the non-clearance case...|$|E
40|$|There exists many {{investigations}} {{in the field}} of <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> inside smooth tubes; however, there is a research gap where this flow is in the transitional flow regime. All work in the transitional flow regime thus far has been concerned with a single tube and in limited cases the effect of different types of inlets were investigated. Many heat exchangers such as shell-and-tube heat exchangers consist of a number of closely packed tubes leading from a common header and in some cases may operate in or close to the transitional flow regime. However, it is not known what effect adjacent tubes will have on <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> and the flow distribution in the transitional flow regime. The {{purpose of this study is}} therefore to investigate the effect that the presence of adjacent tubes will have on the <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> in the transitional flow regime. The study is limited to smooth and circular, horizontal tubes in the fully developed, transitional flow regime and <b>adiabatic</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>drops.</b> The transition effects were investigated experimentally by developing and building an experimental set-up on which, firstly, the <b>pressure</b> <b>drops</b> could be measured of one tube to be used as a reference and then secondly, the <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> of three tubes in parallel, equally spaced, 1. 4 diameters apart. The internal tube diameters of all tubes were 3. 97 mm and the tube lengths were 6 m. The <b>pressure</b> <b>drops</b> were measured over a length of 1. 97 m, at the end of the tubes where the flow was fully developed. The <b>pressure</b> <b>drops</b> were measured with pressure transducers while the inlet and outlet temperatures of the water were measured with PT 100 probes. All the tubes were connected to a calming section to ensure a square-edge inlet. Experiments were conducted with water at Reynolds numbers from 700 to 5 100 to ensure that the <b>pressure</b> <b>drops</b> and thus friction factors could be determined for fully developed flow throughout the laminar, transitional and turbulent flow regimes. The uncertainty of the friction factors were all less than 1 %. It was found that the centre tube experienced an earlier onset of transition than that previously seen in single tube tests, at a Reynolds number of 1 840. In the outer tubes, transitional flow was delayed well beyond that previously seen in literature. The flow in all three tubes underwent transition into fully developed turbulent flow by the maximum Reynolds number of 3 340. The effect of having multiple, adjacent inlets caused a maldistribution in the mass flow rate, with a 5. 8 % difference in the flow rates of the outer tubes in the transitional flow regime. New correlations were developed to predict the friction factor for transitional flow in each of three adjacent tubes at an inlet pitch distance of 1. 4 times the inner tube diameter. Overall, it can be concluded that multiple tube entrances have an effect on the transitional flow in all of the tubes and should be further investigated for other pitch distance and tube arrangements.

Water and thermal management techniques remain {{as one of the}} key roadblocks in PEMFC development. The ability to model two-phase flow and <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> in PEMFCs is of significant importance to the performance and optimization of PEMFCs. This work provides a perspective on the numerous factors that affect the two-phase flow in the gas channels and presents a comprehensive <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> model through an extensive in situ fuel cell investigation. The study focused on low current density and low temperature operation of the cell, as these conditions present the most challenging scenario for water transport in the PEMFC reactant channels. Tests were conducted using two PEMFCs that were representative of the actual full scale commercial automotive geometry. The design of the flow fields allowed visual access to both cathode and anode sides for correlating the visual observations to the two-phase flow patterns and <b>pressure</b> <b>drop.</b> A total of 198 tests were conducted varying gas diffusion layer (GDL), inlet humidity, current density, and stoichiometry; this generated over 1500 average <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> measurements to develop and validate two-phase models.

It is observed that the existing correlations are inadequate in predicting the two-phase <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> in small diameter tubes. Based on the ex-perimental data, a new correlation has been proposed for predicting the two-phase <b>pressure</b> <b>drop.</b> This correlation is developed by modification of Chisholm parameter C by incorporating different parameters. It was found that the pro-posed correlation predicted two-phase <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> at satisfactory level.

40|$|This is a {{study on}} the {{performance}} of a <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> system of a evacuated tube solar collector. The objective of this project is to analysis the effect of nanofluid as the working fluid and temperature on the <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> by determining the <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> by using distilled water and nanofluid at different flow rate. The existing solar system installed in UMP Pekan does not measure the <b>pressure</b> <b>drop.</b> Various working fluid and mass flow rate was use in order to measure <b>pressure</b> <b>drop.</b> The experiment is conducted at solar system installed at UMP Pekan and the data is collected at three hour time interval which is at 9 am, 12 pm and 3 pm. The data analysed using the theoretical analysis and plotted in graph to discuss about it. The <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> obtained for nanofluid in this experiment is higher than distilled water. The minimum <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> within this experiment for distilled water and nanofluid is 694 Pa and 989 Pa respectively. The maximum <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> within this experiment for distilled water and nanofluid is 2336 Pa and 2390 Pa respectively. The <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> increase as the temperature increase. Within in this experiment for both working fluid the <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> is lowest at 9 am which is at that time temperature is the lowest. Although all the above findings refer to a particular flow rate which is for flow rate 2, 2. 5, 3. 0, 3. 5 litre/min, the better results can be obtained if the flow rate is varied. Finally by considering the problem of accuracy of the result, pressure transducer should be used instead of used manometer to measure the <b>pressure</b> <b>drop...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Pressure</b> <b>drop</b> is an {{important}} consideration in Total Site Heat Integration (TSHI). This {{is due to the}} typically large distances between the different plants and the flow across plant elevations and equipment, including heat exchangers. Failure to consider <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> during utility targeting and heat exchanger network (HEN) synthesis may, at best, lead to optimistic energy targets, and at worst, an inoperable system if the pumps or compressors cannot overcome the actual <b>pressure</b> <b>drop.</b> Most studies have addressed the <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> factor in terms of pumping cost, forbidden matches or allowable <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> constraints in the optimisation of HEN. This study looks at the implication of <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> {{in the context of a}} Total Site. The graphical Pinch-based TSHI methodology is extended to consider the <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> factor during the minimum energy requirement (MER) targeting stage. The improved methodology provides a more realistic estimation of the MER targets and valuable insights for the implementation of the TSHI design.

40|$|The {{traditional}} design {{method for}} plate heat exchangers(PHEs), either epsilon-number of transfer units (epsilon-NTU) or logarithmic mean temperature difference method, involves many trials {{in order to}} meet the <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> constraints. This can be avoided through the developed design method, which takes the full utilization of the allowable <b>pressure</b> <b>drops</b> as a design objective. The proposed method is valid for the design situations with and without <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> specifications. In the case of the design with <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> specification, only one stream can fully utilize the allowable <b>pressure</b> <b>drop.</b> In the case of no <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> specification, allowable <b>pressure</b> <b>drops</b> can be determined through economical optimization. Compared to the previous design method, the proposed method does not require many trial iterations. Instead, all heat exchanger parameters, including plate size, number of passes, path, fluid velocity, etc., are determined in a straightforward way. Moreover, the suggested method can guarantee that the optimized values of allowable <b>pressure</b> <b>drops</b> can be fully utilized simultaneously by the two streams. In addition, the optimal corrugation angle is discussed for the most common chevron-type PHEs. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>pressure</b> <b>drops</b> on the {{performance}} characteristics of the air standard Otto cycle are reported. The <b>pressure</b> <b>drops</b> are assumed as constant values independent of the engine size. It {{has been shown that}} the <b>pressure</b> <b>drops</b> to about 60 % of the maximum pressure in the ideal cycle (Curto-Risso et al., 2008). Three different models are studied: constant <b>pressure</b> model, reversible <b>adiabatic</b> expansion model and polytropic expansion model. The findings of this study show that, at this level of <b>pressure</b> <b>drop,</b> the maximum efficiency of the Otto cycle is reduced by 15 % approximately based on the constant pressure model. The combined effect of <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> with other modes of irreversibility, for example, internal irreversibility and heat leaks, could reduce the maximum efficiency into very low values (approximately 30 %). The reversible adiabatic model predicts reduction of 13 % in efficiency at 40 % <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> levels but at the price of zero power production. On the other hand, the polytropic expansion model predicts 40 % reduction in efficiency for the same level of <b>pressure</b> <b>drop</b> (40 %). All three models show that the power output is very sensitive to <b>pressure</b> <b>drop...</b>|$|R
