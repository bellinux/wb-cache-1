The data collected is used to construct a model on ground level, that is, used lead <b>automatic</b> <b>guiding</b> vehicle. The core of the vehicle uses a PIC 18 F 4520 microchip. Bluetooth wireless communication is adopted for remote connection to a computer, which is used to control the vehicles remotely. Operators send movement command to <b>automatic</b> <b>guiding</b> vehicle through computer. Once the destination point is identified, the vehicle lead is forward. The guiding process will map out a path that directs the vehicle to the destination and void any obstacles. The study is based on existing cleaning robots that are available. Aside from fixed point movement, through data analysis, the system is also capable of identifying objects that are not supposed to appear on the ground, such as aluminum cans. By configuring the destination to aluminum cans, the <b>automatic</b> <b>guiding</b> vehicle will lead to a can and pick it up. Such action is the realization of cleaning function...|$|E
40|$|The {{primary image}} {{reflected}} from the field-stop of solar Gregory telescopes {{is used for}} <b>automatic</b> <b>guiding.</b> This new system avoids temporal varying influences from the bending of the telescope tube by the main mirror's gravity and from offsets between the telescope and a separate guiding refractor. The required stiffness of the guider mechanics and the small areas of the sensors demand small f-numbers for the guider optics, which cause problems with the image quality and with heat. Problems also arise from the imaging of the pinhole in the telescope's field stop. The corresponding lack of image information at that location can be reduced numerically by Fourier methods much more effectively than with profile centering methods. Several types of such guiders are tested, a final equipment, now installed at the Gregory telescopes at Tenerife and at Locarno, is described...|$|E
40|$|The {{fabricating}} craftsmanship and {{the artificial}} intelligence are considered as the service-robot realm {{in the development}} of humanoid robot. However, the stability, reliability, and the loading effects are hard to be realized during the commercialized process. Traditionally, the robot can be categorized into the industrial robot and the intelligent/homecare robot from the academic and commercialized viewpoints. Integrated implementation of both kinds of the development industrial and intelligent robots has become increasingly popular since 2000. In this project, the project investigator (PI) is dedicated to integrate major achievement of the robot biomimetic techniques in the past five years, such as the key technology of the arm control, the walking balance, embedded control, caterpillar moving platform, LiFePO 4 cell-balance, and the PLC-based inexpensive automation, etc. On the other hand, the proposed project is focused on developing a manned control and navigating platform of the industrialized caterpillar robot for the commercialized purpose within the next three years. Research work in the 1 st year: Research schedule in the 1 st year:will be focused on the head/neck biomimic mechanism of the robot organs, the artificial skin, the artificial muscle, LiFePO 4 power scheduling, loading estimation, discharge cell-balance, battery power saving. Thus, the lead-acid battery can be replaced on the <b>automatic</b> <b>guiding</b> vehicle (AGV) and graphically user interface (GUI) PC-based panel displayers of the residual electricity. The cruising range can be broadened without the limitation of the robot loading effects and the discharging instability. Research work in the 2 nd year: Research schedule in the 2 nd year will be focused on the Image identification, helicopter 3 D navigating technique, etc. Besides the fabrication of the artificial muscle, biomimetic mechanism, and caterpillar moving platform, the proposed project is dedicated to develop the interactive and simulating algorithm of the audio/video identification/tracking. The detection of the artificial vision includes the image grasping, identification, processing, and recording on the humanoid robot. In this project, the sampling rate will be twice faster than the sound frequency (4000 Hz) with a high-frequency filter to avoid the aliasing phenomenon. Research work in the 3 rd year: Research schedule in the 3 rd year will be focused on the facial tracking and PLC-based industrial control. Multi-face dynamic image can be identified by applying the false rejection ratio within the speed 10 frame/sec. The localization of the artificial vision includes facial detection, grasping, recording, and the image processor of the comparing algorithm and theory. While, the core technologies of the power and communicating interface will be integrated under the network of CANBus (Control Area Network) and the moving navigation on the proposed industrialized humanoid robot. The caterpillar platform can be navigated in the campus with the loading of 80 - 100 kg in 6 km/hr and with the range of 5000 meters. The caterpillar platform with 3 D-video/audio-identified helicopter mentioned above may take the place of the <b>automatic</b> <b>guiding</b> vehicle (AGV) in the unmanned factory or the homecare robot in the urban community. The research goal may be accomplished by promoting the “manned intelligent caterpillar-robot”. The proposed project can be achieved by the teamwork of the intelligent robotics R & D center within the year 2011 - 2014.

The four methods differ along two dimensions. They are either model-based or model-free, and optimize discounted total reward or undiscounted average reward.

An added advantage is that unlike the other methods it does not have any parameters to tune. 1 Introduction <b>Automatic</b> <b>Guided</b> Vehicles are robots which are used for routine transportation tasks in modern manufacturing plants, hospitals and office buildings [Minoura et al. 1993].

By using the laser scanner LMS- 151 and laser navigation sensor NAV- 200, the grid map is updated according to the changing of environment and obstacles. When the AGV finds some new map information such as new unknown obstacles, it adds the information to its map and re-plans a new shortest path from its current coordinates to the given goal coordinates.
