50|$|It {{has been}} {{determined}} from electrophysiological data that excitatory synapses on proximal apical dendrites of prefrontal cortex pyramidal neurons serve to amplify excitatory post-synaptic potential (EPSP) signals generated in distal apical dendrites. This suggests that reduction in distal dendrite mass due to the stress hormone elevation may result {{in an increase in}} proximal <b>apical</b> <b>dendrite</b> complexity as the proximal apical dendrites attempt to offset the reduced distal <b>apical</b> <b>dendrite</b> signals.|$|E
50|$|Dendritic spines receive {{most of the}} {{excitatory}} impulses (EPSPs) that enter a pyramidal cell. Dendritic spines {{were first}} noted by Ramón y Cajal in 1888 by using Golgi's method. Ramón y Cajal {{was also the first}} person to propose a physiological role of dendritic spines: increase the receptive surface area of the neuron. The greater the pyramidal cell's surface area, the greater the neuron's ability to process and integrate large amounts of information. Dendritic spines are absent on the soma, and the number of spines increases away from it. The typical <b>apical</b> <b>dendrite</b> in a rat has at least 3000 dendritic spines. The average human <b>apical</b> <b>dendrite</b> is approximately twice the length of a rat's, so the number of dendritic spines present on a human <b>apical</b> <b>dendrite</b> could be as high as 6000.|$|E
50|$|Two {{types of}} {{dendrites}} present on pyramidal cells are <b>apical</b> and basal <b>dendrites.</b> <b>Apical</b> <b>dendrites</b> {{can be divided}} into two categories: distal and proximal. The longer distal <b>apical</b> <b>dendrites</b> project from the pyramidal cell body (soma) opposite from the axon. Distal <b>apical</b> <b>dendrites</b> form non-local synapses. Shorter proximal <b>apical</b> <b>dendrites</b> project radially to local pyramidal cells and interneurons.

50|$|Distal <b>apical</b> <b>dendrites</b> extend upwards {{from the}} soma. The shorter {{proximal}} <b>apical</b> <b>dendrites</b> extend outward and below. Shape of majority of 2d section is approximately a cylinder with a pointed {{base for the}} apical arbor. The <b>apical</b> <b>dendrites</b> and basal dendrites possess a radial organization pattern as they extend from the soma. Proximal <b>apical</b> <b>dendrites</b> and basal dendrites have approximately the same density. <b>Apical</b> <b>dendrites</b> possess a larger average total dendritic length (6332 vs 5062 micrometres) and surface area (12629 vs 9404 square micrometres; neither includes spines). However, the number of terminal branches for both <b>apical</b> and basal <b>dendrites</b> appear to be similar. Distances between successive branch points are shorter for basal dendrites. The basal dendrite however has approximately 3 fold fewer endings per primary dendrite. This and the lower maximum branch order suggest lower complexity than apical dendritic trees. Basal dendrites have a shorter distance to the tips and a more restricted range than <b>apical</b> <b>dendrites.</b> Data suggests that proximal <b>apical</b> and basal <b>dendrites</b> are more compressed but offer a wider local range of activity than distal <b>apical</b> <b>dendrites.</b>|$|R

Using a high-speed imaging system, we investigated changes in intracellular sodium concentration, [Na+]i, in response to hyperpolarizing pulses applied to the soma. In current-clamp recordings, we detected increases in [Na+]i during negative current injection. Hyperpolarization-induced [Na+]i elevation was more prominent in the middle <b>apical</b> <b>dendrites</b> than in the soma. In the voltage-clamp mode, hyperpolarization induced rapid increases in [Na+]i at the <b>apical</b> <b>dendrites</b> that were significantly faster than those at the soma. The signals were not affected by bath application of 1 μM TTX, but were reduced by 5 mM CsCl. Changes in membrane potential recorded from the <b>apical</b> <b>dendrites</b> in response to negative currents were significantly smaller than those recorded from the soma. In the presence of 5 mM CsCl, the I-V relationships measured at the soma and the dendrites became almost identical, indicating that CsCl-sensitive components are predominantly in the <b>apical</b> <b>dendrites.</b> These results suggest that hyperpolarization-induced [Na+]i elevations reflect Na+ influx through the non-selective cation channel (Ih channel), and that this channel is distributed predominantly in the <b>apical</b> <b>dendrites.</b> The non-uniform Na+ influx may contribute to integrative functions of the dendrites...|$|R

The {{participation of the}} dendrites in the initialization and propagation of population spikes in CA 1 of urethan-anesthetized rats in vivo was studied using simultaneously recorded field potentials and current source density (CSD) analysis. CSD analysis revealed that the antidromic population spike, evoked by stimulation of the alveus, invaded in succession, the axon initial segment (stratum oriens), cell body and approximately 200 microm of the proximal <b>apical</b> <b>dendrites.</b> Excitation of the basal dendrites of CA 1, following stimulation of CA 3 stratum oriens, evoked an orthodromic spike that started near the cell body or initial segment and then propagated approximately 200 microm into the proximal <b>apical</b> <b>dendrites.</b> In contrast, the population spike that followed excitation of the <b>apical</b> <b>dendrites</b> of CA 1 initiated at the proximal <b>apical</b> <b>dendrites,</b> 50 - 100 microm distal to the cell body layer, and then propagated centripetally to the cell body and the proximal basal <b>dendrites.</b> A late <b>apical</b> dendritic spike may arise in the mid-apical dendrites (250 - 300 microm from the cell layer) and propagated distally. The origin or the pattern of propagation of each population spike type was similar for near-threshold to supramaximal stimulus intensities. In summary, population spikes following apical dendritic and basal dendritic excitation in vivo appeared to originate from different locations. Apical dendritic excitation evoked a population spike that initiated in the proximal <b>apical</b> <b>dendrites</b> while basal dendritic excitation evoked a spike that started near the initial segment or cell body.

This refinement enables its associated cortical circuit to generate a specific resonant ("carrier") frequency by which the circuit can separate its signaling from that of other circuits.A more recent article by LaBerge & Kasevich (2013) describes signaling by neurons as the neural correlate of objective information processing and resonating in clusters of apical dendrites as the neural correlate of subjective impressions (e.g., impressions of sounds, colors, and feelings). These two [...] "articles provide theoretical support for the hypothesis that <b>apical</b> <b>dendrite</b> resonance supplements neural signaling as a major mode of neural function.

50|$|Studies of {{dendritic}} morphological changes {{indicate that}} elevation of stress hormones in layer II-III of the prefrontal cortex causes no observable {{change in the}} structure or distribution of basal dendrites. The apical dendrites, however, show a significant redistribution in stress-hormone treated animal brains, which is measured using Scholl analysis. Scholl analysis estimates the amount and distributions of dendrite material by counting numbers of intersections of dendrites with an overlay of concentric rings centered at the soma. Medial prefrontal cortex layer II-III pyramidal neurons showed significant reorganization with a 21% increase in proximal <b>apical</b> <b>dendrite</b> arbors and a decrease of 58% in distal <b>apical</b> <b>dendrite</b> arbors. These results are {{in contrast to the}} changes in the hippocampal CA3 dendritic arbors, in which only regressive changes were observed. One possible explanation proposed in these studies is that the atrophy of distal dendrites in II-III layer pyramidal neurons results directly from the loss of input from changed CA3 pyramidal neurons, as both CA1 and CA3 project directly into the medial prefrontal cortex.|$|E

40|$|Dendritic ion {{channels}} play {{a critical}} role in shaping synaptic input and are fundamentally important for synaptic integration and plasticity. In the hippocampal region CA 1, somato-dendritic gradients of AMPA receptors and the hyperpolarization-activated cation conductance (I(h)) counteract the effects of dendritic filtering on the amplitude, time-course, and temporal integration of distal Schaffer collateral (SC) synaptic inputs within stratum radiatum (SR). While ion channel gradients in CA 1 distal <b>apical</b> trunk <b>dendrites</b> within SR have been well characterized, little is known about the patterns of ion channel expression in the distal <b>apical</b> tuft <b>dendrites</b> within stratum lacunosum moleculare (SLM) that receive distinct input from the entorhinal cortex via perforant path (PP) axons. Here, we measured local ion channels densities within these distal <b>apical</b> tuft <b>dendrites</b> to determine if the somato-dendritic gradients of I(h) and AMPA receptors extend into distal tuft dendrites. We also determined the densities of voltage-gated sodium channels and NMDA receptors. We found that the densities of AMPA receptors, I(h,) and voltage-gated sodium channels are similar in tuft dendrites in SLM when compared with distal <b>apical</b> <b>dendrites</b> in SR, while the ratio of NMDA receptors to AMPA receptors increases in tuft dendrites relative to distal <b>apical</b> <b>dendrites</b> within SR. These data indicate that the somato-dendritic gradients of I(h) and AMPA receptors in <b>apical</b> <b>dendrites</b> do not extend into the distal tuft, and the relative densities of voltage-gated sodium channels and NMDA receptors are poised to support nonlinear integration of correlated SC and PP input...|$|R

40|$|A single {{episode of}} status epilepticus (se) induced in rodents by the convulsant pilocarpine, produces, after a latent period of ≥ 2 weeks, a chronic epileptic condition. During the latent period of epileptogenesis, most CA 1 {{pyramidal}} cells that normally {{fire in a}} regular pattern, acquire low-threshold bursting behaviour, generating high-frequency clusters of 3 – 5 spikes as their minimal response to depolarizing stimuli. Recruitment of a Ni 2 +- and amiloride-sensitive T-type Ca 2 + current (ICaT), shown to be up-regulated after se, plays {{a critical role in}} burst generation in most cases. Several lines of evidence suggest that ICaT driving bursting is located in the <b>apical</b> <b>dendrites.</b> Thus, bursting was suppressed by focally applying Ni 2 + to the <b>apical</b> <b>dendrites,</b> but not to the soma. It was also suppressed by applying either tetrodotoxin or the KV 7 /M-type K+ channel agonist retigabine to the <b>apical</b> <b>dendrites.</b> Severing the distal <b>apical</b> <b>dendrites</b> ∼ 150 μm from the pyramidal layer also abolished this activity. Intradendritic recordings indicated that evoked bursts are associated with local Ni 2 +-sensitive slow spikes. Blocking persistent Na+ current did not modify bursting in most cases. We conclude that se-induced increase in ICaT density in the <b>apical</b> <b>dendrites</b> facilitates their depolarization by the backpropagating somatic spike. The ICaT-driven dendritic depolarization, in turn, spreads towards the soma, initiating another backpropagating spike, and so forth, thereby creating a spike burst. The early appearance and predominance of ICaT-driven low-threshold bursting in CA 1 pyramidal cells that experienced se most probably contribute to the emergence of abnormal network discharges and may also {{play a role in the}} circuitry reorganization associated with epileptogenesis...|$|R

Co-stimulation of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) during the TA tetanus did not affect LTP; DA antagonist haloperidol injected prior to the TA tetanus also did not affect LTP.

40|$|The {{cellular}} {{and molecular}} mechanisms that underlie acquired changes in Ca 2 + dynamics of different neuronal compartments {{are important in}} the induction and maintenance of epileptiform activity. Simultaneous electrophysiology and Ca 2 + imaging techniques were used to understand the basic properties of dendritic Ca 2 + signaling in rat subicular pyramidal neurons during epileptiform activity. Distance-dependent changes in the Ca 2 + decay kinetics locked to spontaneous epileptiform discharges and back-propagating action potentials were observed in the <b>apical</b> <b>dendrites.</b> A decrement in the mean tau value of Ca 2 + decay was observed in distal parts (95 - 110 mu m) of the <b>apical</b> <b>dendrites</b> compared with proximal segments (30 - 45 mu m) in in-vitro epileptic conditions but not in control. Pharmacological agents that block Ca 2 + transporters, i. e.

The relative contribution of Na+/Ca 2 + exchangers in Ca 2 + extrusion was higher in the distal <b>apical</b> <b>dendrites</b> in the in-vitro epileptic condition and this property modulated the excitability of the neuron in simulation.

50|$|Since fast signals {{occurring}} in the basilar and proximal apical dendrites are transferred to the soma {{with at least a}} 20-25% efficiency, synapses in these dendrites each contribute more to the neuronal activation than distal apical synapses. In contrast, only slow signals from the distal dendrites are efficiently transferred to the soma, suggesting a modulatory role on the resting potential of the cell. It is hypothesized in several studies that this could be accomplished by varying the overall frequency of synaptic activity in the distal <b>apical</b> <b>dendrite.</b> Since a constant barrage of synaptic activity would approximate a constant current injection, the overall level of synaptic activity in the distal <b>apical</b> <b>dendrite</b> could set the depolarization level of the entire neuron. When a more efficient proximal synaptic activity is superimposed upon a sub-threshold depolarization due to distal activity, the cell has a high probability of firing an AP. In CA3, it is the perforant path projection from the entorhinal cortical cells that provides synaptic input to the most distal dendrites of the pyramidal cells. Assuming a frequency average of 7 spikes/sec, as few as five randomly firing entorhinal cortical cells would cause a steady level of depolarization in the distal dendrites of CA3b pyramidal cells. Amplitude and kinetics of the electrical signal vary as a function of position within the dendrite and signal frequency.|$|E
