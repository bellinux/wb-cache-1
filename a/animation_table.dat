40|$|We {{propose a}} method for {{automatically}} copying facial motion from one 3 D face model to another, while preserving the compliance of the motion to the MPEG- 4 FBA standard. Despite the enormous progress {{in the field of}} Facial Animation, producing a new animatable face from scratch is still a tremendous task for an artist. Although many methods exist to animate a face automatically based on procedural methods, these methods still need to be initialized by defining facial regions or similar, and they lack flexibility because the artist can only obtain the facial motion that a particular algorithm offers. Therefore a very common approach is interpolation between key facial expressions, usually called morph targets, containing either speech elements (visemes) or emotional expressions. Following the same approach, the MPEG- 4 Facial Animation specification offers {{a method for}} interpolation of facial motion from key positions, called Facial <b>Animation</b> <b>Tables.</b> Our method automatically copies the motion of vertices, as well as geometry transforms, from source face to target face while maintaining the regional correspondences and the correct scale of motion. It requires the user only to identify a subset of the MPEG- 4 Feature Points in the source and target faces. The scale of the movement is normalized with respect to MPEG- 4 normalization units (FAPUs), meaning that the MPEG- 4 FBA compliance of the copied motion is preserved. Our method is therefore suitable not only for cloning of free facial expressions, but also of MPEG- 4 compatible facial motion, in particular the Facial <b>Animation</b> <b>Tables.</b> We believe that Facial Motion Cloning offers dramatic time saving to artists producing morph targets for facial animation o...|$|R

5000|$|Various animators {{had come}} up with {{different}} methods to keep their drawings lined up, but none of them worked very well. Barré and Nolan's solution was to punch two holes at the bottom of all of their sheets and pass them through two pegs glued to the <b>animation</b> <b>table.</b> This peg system is still in practice today. The system they used for animation, on the other hand, was a dead end precisely because it produced registration problems the peg system couldn't always fix. The basis of this [...] "slash system" [...] was to tear away the paper being drawn on to show the change underneath. For example, if a character was to move his arm, the first drawing would consist of character and background, then the arm would be carefully torn out to reveal the next sheet down and a new arm was drawn on the new paper revealed. The slash system lasted through the 1920s at various studios before being replaced by Earl Hurd's cell system.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Multimedia {{learning}} environments usually combine multiple forms of representations like texts, pictures, <b>animations,</b> <b>tables</b> or formulas. However, knowledge acquisition from multiple representations requires {{the integration of}} these sources in order to construct a coherent mental representation. The present paper therefore outlines a first theoretical framework for the process of coherence formation within cognitive load theory. Despite the benefits of dealing with multiple representations (e. g. multiple perspectives, elaboration, abstraction, flexibility) there is empirical evidence that learners and especially those with little prior knowledge have difficulties in integration and fail to construct a globally coherent mental representation. Different approaches to reduce the cognitive costs of coherence formation are discussed with reference to current empirical studies. Thus, the effectiveness of help for coherence formation {{turned out to be}} highly depending on learners expertise and as it imposes germane cognitive load it can only be helpful within the limits of working memory capacity. Modern multimedia {{learning environments}} usually combine multiple forms of representations like written or spoken texts, static and animated pictures or graphs, tables or formulas (Mayer, 2001). However, knowledge acquisition from multiple representations requires different cognitive mapping processes. First, learners hav...|$|R

50|$|In {{motion capture}} sessions, {{movements}} {{of one or}} more actors are sampled many times per second. Whereas early techniques used images from multiple cameras to calculate 3D positions, often the purpose of motion capture is to record only the movements of the actor, not his or her visual appearance. This animation data is mapped to a 3D model so that the model performs the same actions as the actor. This process may be contrasted with the older technique of rotoscoping, as seen in Ralph Bakshi's The Lord of the Rings (1978) and American Pop (1981). The animated character movements were achieved in these films by tracing over a live-action actor, capturing the actor's motions and movements. To explain, an actor is filmed performing an action, and then the recorded film is projected onto an <b>animation</b> <b>table</b> frame-by-frame. Animators trace the live-action footage onto animation cels, capturing the actor's outline and motions frame-by-frame, and then they fill in the traced outlines with the animated character. The completed animation cels are then photographed frame-by-frame, exactly matching the movements and actions of the live-action footage. The end result of which is that the animated character replicates exactly the live-action movements of the actor. However, this process takes a considerable amount of time and effort.|$|E

40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the intersection of}} the avant-garde and mass culture through a close reading of three singular works from the Weimar Republic in Germany. Bauhaus founding director Walter Gropius (1883 - 1969) designed a "Total Theater" (1927, unbuilt) whose multiple screens encircled an interior structure for the presentation of twelve simultaneous film projections. In 1930, Hungarian-born Bauhaus professor László Moholy-Nagy (1895 - 1946) completed a rotating, metallic sculpture for the projection of light effects, which has assumed a number of different configurations within theater, film, and the museum since its inception in 1922. In the 1910 s and 20 s, Swedish-born Viking Eggeling (1880 - 1925) experimented with the properties of line by transferring static, two-dimensional collages from the <b>animation</b> <b>table</b> to the cinematic screen. In addition to undoing experimental film's logic as a genre, this study {{addresses the}} epistemological questions each of these works introduce [...] namely, the production of artistic and scientific knowledge in the early twentieth century, the evidentiary status of reproducible media, and the institutional framing of works of art. Rather than establish a genealogy between early twentieth-century kinetic and light experiments and the "expanded cinema" practices of the 1960 s and 70 s, this dissertation approaches these objects as "adjacencies" to the cinematic dispositif, within which their relationship to art and politics, technological determinism, the ontology of the work of art, and the compartmentalization of media are examined...|$|E

40|$|This PechaKucha {{presents}} the initial {{findings of a}} research project which attempts to map PhD students’ information needs and behaviour at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden. The outcome of the project will help us redesign and update our Information Literacy course {{in collaboration with the}} Innovation Office on campus. The library has a long tradition in offering Information Literacy courses for its PhD students and has done so since the early 1990 s. However, as the course is now part of a Generic Transferable Skills course package which is offered to all PhD students, an update of the course to fit the new context is necessary. The basis for our presentation is an online survey (Dilek-Kayaoglu, 2014; Rafique and Mahmood, 2015) targeting all currently enrolled PhD students. The method used for the data analysis is the compiling and comparison of descriptive statistics involving variables relevant for this target group. More specifically, the survey questions concerned information behaviour (Wilson, 2000) in connection to: (a) literature reviews/thesis writing; (b) resources and information-seeking methods such as databases, books and e-books, web search engines, patents, data visualisations, informal channels, text mining; (c) bibliometrics, strategic publishing and open access; (d) reference managing; (e) library use; (f) information ethics and copyright; (g) scholarly information needs for the profession. In our PechaKucha we will present the most significant outcomes from the questionnaire with the aid of <b>animations,</b> <b>table</b> and graphs. The statistical significance of variables such as research areas, years of study, previous attendance at our information literacy course and at the research utilisation course has also been taken into account in the data analysis (Heinström, 2002). Based on the initial survey, we will proceed later on in 2016 with the second part of this research project, a qualitative study with focus groups involving 10 - 12 PhD students. From the semi-structured interviews with the focus groups we will create personas, which will guide the design and development for our course as well as keep the needs of the doctoral students at the forefront...|$|R
