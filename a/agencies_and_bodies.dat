50|$|CSF {{is housed}} at the Collegio Carlo Alberto in Moncalieri, a {{town on the}} {{outskirts}} of Turin. It was established as a research centre jointly with the University of Pavia and University of Turin, with the Foundation Compagnia di San Paolo, and was subsequently joined by the University of Milan. The purpose of CSF - as stated in its Statute of Association is to promote and coordinate scientific research on studies on federalism, as well promoting and coordinating activities with member universities and other Italian and foreign international universities and research centres. Furthermore, CSF also cooperates with private and public <b>agencies</b> <b>and</b> <b>bodies</b> interested in promoting fostering the development of knowledge and implementation of federalist principles. The CSF is governed by a Board which sets the guidelines for the scientific projects and fund allocation, the Steering Committee, the Board of Auditors and by a Scientific Committee whose members are renowned international scholars and experts of federalism. The administrative and scientific staff also include researchers from several universities and fields of research, including Law, Economics, Social, Political Science and History. Lastly, CSF’s Library contains some 12,000 books volumes, subscribes to 70 newspapers, journals and magazines. It also houses 500 ones titles that are no longer in print {{as well as a number}} of special collections bequeathed to the Centre, such as the CIME Archive of the Italian Council of the European Movement and the online document summary of the Altiero Spinelli Collection, of which the hard copies are at Historical Archives of the European Union administered by the European University Institute in Florence.|$|E

40|$|Effective {{coordination}} between organizations, <b>agencies</b> <b>and</b> <b>bodies</b> providing or financing health services in humanitarian crises {{is required to}} ensure efficiency of services, avoid duplication, and improve equity. The objective of this review was to assess how, during and after humanitarian crises, different mechanisms and models of {{coordination between}} organizations, <b>agencies</b> <b>and</b> <b>bodies</b> providing or financing health services compare in terms of access to health services and health outcomes. We registered a protocol for this review in PROSPERO International prospective register of systematic reviews under number PROSPERO 2014 :CRD 42014009267. Eligible studies included randomized and nonrandomized designs, process evaluations and qualitative methods. We electronically searched Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and the WHO Global Health Library and websites of relevant organizations. We followed standard systematic review methodology for the selection, data abstraction, and risk of bias assessment. We assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach. Of 14, 309 identified citations from databases and organizations' websites, we identified four eligible studies. Two studies used mixed-methods, one used quantitative methods, and one used qualitative methods. The available evidence suggests that information coordination between bodies providing health services in humanitarian crises settings may be effective in improving health systems inputs. There is additional evidence suggesting that management/directive coordination such as the cluster model may improve health system inputs in addition to access to health services. None of the included studies assessed coordination through common representation and framework coordination. The evidence was judged to be of very low quality. This systematic review provides evidence of possible effectiveness of information coordination and management/directive coordination between organizations, <b>agencies</b> <b>and</b> <b>bodies</b> providing or financing health services in humanitarian crises. Our findings can inform the research agenda and highlight the need for improving conduct and reporting of research in this field...|$|E

It applies a multivariant analysis of the models of law enforcement fusion centres identified in the practical intelligence co-operation in the EU. It arrives at the conclusion that the network architecture of intelligence co-operation on the EU level is flexible enough to integrate various parts of information exchange and intelligence sharing. EU <b>agencies</b> <b>and</b> <b>bodies</b> have moved towards closer co-operation, widening cautiously yet constantly the scope of mutual undertakings. An EU law enforcement fusion centre should be seen as a virtual networked arrangement closely connecting the existing EU agencies implementing intelligence tradecraft...|$|E

However, the most effective strategies for mitigating the effects of the drought have not been given sufficient media coverage or discussed critically enough in the public arena. Instead, while important and necessary, the focus has largely remained on emotive pleas for increased aid. This unfortunately, detracts from a considered discourse on the most effective interventions in the current circumstances and reduces scrutiny on performance of the primary <b>agencies</b> <b>and</b> <b>bodies</b> responsible for coordinating the relief effort.

30|$|This theoretical {{framework}} {{explains the}} contradictory practices of executives {{where they are}} at once tough on borders but also immersed heavily in human rights protection talk. The production of buffers between irregular migrants and the destination country – via offshoring, push back policies, people swapping deals and 'saving lives' rhetoric – are acts that produce invisibility and allow governments to create narratives to dictate events as ‘true’. All other versions, offered by media, NGOs and, saliently to this paper, by the judiciary, are considered questionable because the executive considers itself as the highest ranked group and the ultimate truth-holder. By making the source of information, {{in this case the}} irregular migrants, difficult to reach through the amplification of buffers, all other <b>agencies</b> <b>and</b> <b>bodies</b> are discredited by the government, as they cannot access the source and therefore are represented as not fully ‘understanding’ the issue at hand.|$|E
