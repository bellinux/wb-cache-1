40|$|SummarySimrar is {{an analog}} radio {{receiver}} simulator and statistical recorder. The simulator {{is composed of}} typical analog computer components which provide versatility in simulating receiving systems. A control circuit automatically cycles the machine through a present number of statistical trials. On each trial, <b>amplitude</b> <b>discriminator</b> circuits determine if the input to the measurement system has exceeded a selected threshold level. Counters record {{the total number of}} trials on which each threshold level has been exceeded, and over a large number of trials an accurate estimate is obtained for the probability that a level will be exceeded. The author describes the design and operation of Simrar in fixed time and sequential decision processes. Although its principal use has been in studies of signal detection, the versatility of Simrar makes it a useful device in more general statistical studies...|$|E

The method has {{a balance between the}} accuracy and rapidness of the pulses discrimination. Mode-locked states are distinguished and confirmed by an <b>amplitude</b> <b>discriminator,</b> which reflects the repetition rate information of the pulses. An electronic polarization controller is used to precisely adjust the intracavity polarization states. The driving voltages of the electronic polarization controller at those mode-locked states are recorded as populations, and it is benefit to reduce the build-up time for mode locking. The populations are also recorded at operation temperature covering from 20 degrees C to 50 degrees C, which exhibits the repeatability and stability of the mode-locked states. Rapid self-tuning mode-locked fiber lasers could be achieved by the repeatability of the polarization settings under the stable temperature environment...|$|E

Also it includes neutron detector, two BC- 408 based scintillation detectors of the calorimeter, and four BC- 408 based lateral detectors of the calorimeter. The total calorimeter thickness is 25 X 0 or 1. 2 λ 0 for vertical incident particles registration and 54 X 0 or 2. 5 λ 0 for laterally incident ones (where λ 0 is nuclear interaction length). The counting and triggers signals formation system started the data acquisition and provides particle identification.

40|$|Neuronal {{activity}} was recorded from 13 sites in right nondominant superior and middle temporal gyms during matching of faces (FM), matching of complex figures (CM), labelling of facial emotional expression (FE) and object naming (N) in 11 patients undergoing craniotomy under local anaesthesia. These extracellular recordings {{were divided into}} 21 neuronal populations of one to a few cells, using <b>amplitude</b> window <b>discriminators.</b> Sixty-two percent of those populations showed statistically significant changes in activity during FM; 52 % during FE; 38 % during N and 38 % during CM. Fifty-one percent of changes were in the first 1. 3 s of each task and 33 % in the next 1. 3 s, when overt speech responses to the tasks occurred. Significant changes lasting throughout the 4 s allotted to each task were not seen. Functional correlates of some populations were derived from patterns of changes during FM and other tasks: four populations were related to 'matching', in that significant changes occurred with FM and CM. One of these populations, and six other populations were related to face perception, with significant change with FM and FE, confirming the presence in man of neuronal activity related to faces, as previously described from primate cortex. Six populations increased activity with overt speech; four of these showed greater increases when overt speech {{was in response to}} a visuospatial task compared with the lexical task...|$|R
40|$|This report {{deals with}} methods of {{measuring}} the probability distributions and mean values of random functions as encountered in turbulence research. Applications to {{the measurement of}} probability distributions of the axial velocity fluctuation u(t) and its derivative du/dt in isotropic turbulence are shown. The assumption of independent probabilities of u(t) and du/dt, which {{has been used as}} an approximation in the application of zero counts to the measurement of the microscale of turbulence [lambda], is investigated. The results indicate that the assmuption is satisfied within a few percent and that there is, so far, no evidence that the systematic difference between [lambda] measured from zero counts and [lambda] measured independently can be traced entirely to the statistical dependence of u and du/dt. The chronological development of apparatus is described, concluding with the present 10 -channel statistical analyzer based upon a system of pulse amplitude modulation followed by an <b>amplitude</b> <b>discriminator</b> and a counter.

40|$|We {{present the}} design and the first {{experimental}} characterization of VEGA, an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) designed to read out large area monolithic linear Silicon Drift Detectors (SDD’s). VEGA consists of an analog and a digital/mixed-signal section to accomplish all the functionalities and specifications required for high resolution X-ray spectroscopy in the energy range between 500 eV and 50 keV. The analog section includes a charge sensitive preamplifier, a shaper with 3 -bit digitally selectable shaping times from 1. 6 µs to 6. 6 µs and a peak stretcher/sample-and-hold stage. The digital/mixed-signal section includes an <b>amplitude</b> <b>discriminator</b> with coarse and fine threshold level setting, a peak discriminator and a logic circuit to fulfill pile-up rejection, signal sampling, trigger generation, channel reset and the preamplifier and discriminators disabling functionalities. A Serial Peripherical Interface (SPI) is integrated in VEGA for loading and storing all configuration parameters in an internal register within few microseconds. The VEGA ASIC has been designed and manufactured in 0. 35 µm CMOS mixed-signal technology in single and 32 channel versions with dimensions of 200 µm× 500 µm per channel. A minimum intrinsic Equivalent Noise Charge (ENC) of 12 electrons r. m. s. at 3. 6 µs peaking time and room temperature is measured and the linearity error is between − 0. 9 % and + 0. 6 % in the whole input energy range. The total power consumption is 481 µW and 420 µW per channel for the single and 32 channels version, respectively. A comparison with other ASICs for X-ray SDD’s shows that VEGA has a suitable low noise and offers high functionality as ADC-ready signal processing but at a power consumption that is a factor of four lower than other similar existing ASICs...|$|E
40|$|The ongoing {{improvements}} in the analytical techniques based on more realistic assumptions, plant performance feedback, and the latest fuel designs {{have resulted in a}} significant increase in the calculated operational margins related to the safety analysis. The power level is used, with other data, in many of the licensing analyses that demonstrate the safety of the plant. The increasing of the available safety analysis margin provides BWR plants with the potential for an increase in thermal power rating up to 20 % (Power Uprate). In order to operate much more effectively and to more efficiently use Pu fissile materials, BWR plants expand the operating range in the region of operation with less flow than rated core flow. This extended operating domain for a plant that has uprated power greater than ~ 7 % is identified as Maximum Extended Load Line Limit Analysis Plus (MELLLA+). Since in the BWR design the stability must be evaluated over the entire operating domain where power oscillations could occur, the MELLLA+ domain must be investigated. New licensing bases, hardware and software specifications are required to prevent plants from exceeding their Safety Limit Minimum Critical Power Ratio (SLMCPR) due to oscillations in fuel channel power. The “Detect and Suppress Solution - Confirmation Density” (DSS-CD) [Ref. 1] is a GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy (GEH) proprietary and US NRC approved methodology. DSS-CD is a stability Long Term Solution (LTS) which consists of hardware and software that provide for reliable, automatic detection and suppression of stability related power oscillations. It is designed to identify unstable power oscillations upon inception and initiate control rod insertion to terminate the oscillations prior to any significant power amplitude growth that would threaten the SLMCPR. The computer code TRACG [Ref. 4], the GEH proprietary version of the Transient Analysis Reactor Code (TRAC), is used to evaluate the Minimum Critical Power Ratio (MCPR) performance of anticipated instability events that are reasonably limiting in ii order to perform best-estimate event simulations for a specified range of operating conditions and anticipated oscillation modes. TRACG [Ref. 4] is a multi dimensional twofluid Thermal-Hydraulic (T-H) model with a three dimensional (3 -D) kinetics model capable of simulating the reactor core and the systems relevant for establishing boundary conditions for the reactor vessel. TRACG has been extensively qualified against test data and BWR actual plant data from instability events. The stability performance of the core is highly dependent on the core configuration and operating state. Each DSS-CD stability evaluation consists of a steady-state analysis performed, using the GEH proprietary 3 -D core simulator PANACEA, to establish the core condition immediately prior to a transient event that is modeled using TRACG. The scenarios considered in the analysis are loss of core flow events due to recirculation pump trip events, starting from the expected most limiting steady-state operating conditions, at the highest Power/Flow (P/F) ratios in the MELLLA+ domain. The main objective of this dissertation is to demonstrate that the DSS-CD solution provides positive margin to the safety limit MCPR at the time of the suppression of the power oscillations. The power suppression by DSS-CD for high growth instability events occurs within a few oscillation periods from the time the instability is sensed by a period based oscillation counting detection algorithm, confirmed by multiple Oscillation Power Range Monitors (OPRMs), combined with the detected oscillations reaching a low <b>amplitude</b> <b>discriminator</b> setpoint. In addition some sensitivity analyses are performed in order to evaluate the impact of a few parameters on the stability behavior of the core. These parameters were identified to be relevant based on preliminary analysis and the T-H stability literature. • Sensitivity analysis on the axial nodalization of the bypass region to study the impact of the bypass voiding on the T-H feedback in the TRACG 3 -D neutronkinetics solution for two different top guide geometries. iii • Sensitivity of the stability behavior of the core to the channel grouping. The impact of the channel grouping on stability applications during two recirculation pump trip (2 RPT) events is performed. The stability performances of the core in 2 RPT events requires evaluation of two aspects; 1) onset of oscillations; and 2) mode of oscillations. • Noise to the system applied to evaluate the impact on the onset of oscillation. • A more realistic UO 2 conductivity model that takes into consideration exposure and gadolinium concentration was used in order to understand the impact on stability applications of the fuel rod thermal time constant. Finally, the use of automation tools for nuclear analysis and in particular to perform stability evaluation is discussed. The benefits of the automation tools are considered in the context of productivity and prevention of human errors to better assure the delivery of quality analysis products...|$|E
