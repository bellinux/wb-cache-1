It has had responsibility for certifying national accounts since 2006, {{when it was}} given this role {{as a result of}} one the major state reform acts in past decades (the Loi organique relative aux lois de finances 1, LOLF). Since then it has consistently highlighted the deficiencies of ministerial internal control (IC) systems. In its 2009 <b>account</b> <b>certification</b> <b>report</b> 2, the Court makes this one of its two most significant reservations, thereby increasing pressure on the players in this process, especially ministries. The first point the court raises is that the issue of performance underlies the process of internal control. This type of approach goes far beyond a ‗simple' search for accounting quality. To consider accounting as the foundation for IC is a short-term and narrow view. The actual purpose of IC is to leverage efficiency and effectiveness to achieve public policy goals...|$|E

40|$|<b>Certification</b> of {{financial}} <b>reports</b> is tightly regulated {{with the intent}} to ensure the quality of this service. In order to place this market within a larger perspective, Part I of this paper presents archival data on certification activity in the economy. �e finding of widespread availability of a diverse set of certifiers for most goods and services points to the competitive conditions that accounting firms may encounter as they attempt to expand their range of services. In Part II we examine an instance of audit firms unsuccessfully competing with non-traditional assurance providers of e-commerce privacy certification. �eir failure appears to be attributable, at least in part, to the high cost of certification, inferior standards, and poor compliance by their clients. In Part III we document the types of <b>certification</b> <b>reports</b> issued by government agencies and private certification services. Private certification agencies issue more detailed and informative <b>certification</b> <b>reports</b> compared to government agencies. We discuss the implications of these findings for the market for audit services...|$|R

Certification enables firms to accumulate legitimacy that enables stakeholders to know of, and understand, a firm’s activities: it is a mechanism to buffer against the liabilities of newness and smallness. Building on insights from the resource-based view of the firm, institutional theory and signalling theory, this article conceptualises environmental certification as an observable high-quality resource investment signal. This resource fosters innovation and encourages certified firms to accumulate and mobilise legitimacy.
