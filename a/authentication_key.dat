40|$|Problem statement: In Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), serious {{security}} threat {{is caused by}} node capture attacks where an adversary gains full control over a sensor node through direct physical access. Approach: This creates {{a high risk of}} data confidentiality. Results: We propose a secure authentication technique for data aggregation in WSN. During first round of data aggregation, the aggregator upon identifying the detecting nodes selects a set of nodes randomly and broadcast a unique value which contains their <b>authentication</b> <b>keys,</b> to the selected set of nodes. When any node within the set wants to send the data, it sends slices of data to other nodes in that set, encrypted with their respective <b>authentication</b> <b>keys.</b> Each receiving node decrypts, sums up the slices and sends the encrypted data to the aggregator. Conclusion/Recommendations: The aggregator aggregates and encrypts the data with the shared secret key of the sink and forwards it to the sink. In the second round of aggregation, the set of nodes is reselected with new set of <b>authentication</b> <b>keys.</b> By simulation results, we show that the proposed approach rectifies the {{security threat}} of node capture attacks...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Serious {{security}} threat is originated by node capture attacks in hierarchical data aggregation where a hacker achieves full {{control over a}} sensor node through direct physical access in wireless sensor networks. It makes {{a high risk of}} data confidentiality. In this study, we propose a securing node capture attacks for hierarchical data aggregation in wireless sensor networks. Initially network is separated into number of clusters, each cluster is headed by an aggregator and the aggregators are directly connected to sink. The aggregator upon identifying the detecting nodes selects a set of nodes randomly and broadcast a unique value which contains their <b>authentication</b> <b>keys,</b> to the selected set of nodes in first round of data aggregation. When any node within the group needs to transfer the data, it transfers slices of data to other nodes in that group, encrypted by individual <b>authentication</b> <b>keys.</b> Each receiving node decrypts, sums up the slices and transfers the encrypted data to the aggregator. The aggregator aggregates and encrypts the data with the shared secret key of the sink and forwards it to the sink. The set of nodes is reselected with new set of <b>authentication</b> <b>keys</b> {{in the second round of}} aggregation. By simulation results, we demonstrate that the proposed technique resolves the {{security threat}} of node capture attacks...|$|R
