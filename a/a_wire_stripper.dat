40|$|A triple-GEM {{detector}} with two-dimensional readout is developed. The detector provides {{high position}} resolution for powder diffraction experiments at synchrotron radiation. Spatial {{resolution of the}} detector is measured in the lab using a 55 Fe X-ray source. A resolution of about 110 um FWHM is achieved. The energy resolution is better than 27 % for 5. 9 keV X-rays. The detector's validity under illumination of photons in particular energy range is verified using a Cu X-ray tube. Imaging {{of the head of}} <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> <b>stripper</b> with X-ray tube demonstrates its imaging ability.

40|$|NASA-developed {{space shuttle}} {{technology}} {{is used in}} <b>a</b> laser <b>wire</b> <b>stripper</b> designed by Raytheon Company.

50|$|<b>A</b> laser <b>wire</b> <b>stripper</b> is <b>a</b> {{computer-controlled}} machine, {{much like}} a CNC router, which uses a laser to burn off the insulation of the wire. Laser wire stripping machines are used mostly for very fine gauge wires since they do not damage the conductor. A typical CO2 laser wire stripping machine should be capable of stripping the insulation from any size wire.|$|R
40|$|Cells use Homologous {{recombination}} (HR) {{to repair}} double stranded DNA breaks. When {{there is a}} double stranded break in the DNA, rather than reattaching the broken pieces of DNA, the cell will compare the broken strand to the homologous copy of DNA {{and use it as}} a template to complete repair. A protein called Rad 51 is the central engine for HR and forms a filament on DNA to promote HR. But, too much HR is also bad for the cell as it will cause chromosome rearrangements. The cells control when and where Rad 51 functions by removing it from unwanted places in the DNA. This is accomplished by a protein called Srs 2. Srs 2 moves along the DNA and remove Rad 51, a role analogous to <b>a</b> <b>wire</b> <b>stripper.</b> My research seeks to understand the dynamics of Srs 2 and Rad 51 so as to better understand their roles in DNA repair. We have uncovered the speed of Srs 2 movement on the DNA and how much ATP is used in the movement. This study gives a quantitative measure of Srs 2 sliding, forward 2 Ì† 6 backward movement and pausing while moving along the DNA. Using this information, we will put together a mechanism for Srs 2 movement on DNA as it works to remove the Rad 51 filament on DNA. Ultimately, this helps us understand why mutations in protein like Srs 2 and Rad 51 lead to the onset of cancer...|$|E
50|$|When engaged, <b>an</b> {{automatic}} <b>wire</b> <b>stripper</b> first simultaneously {{grips the}} wire in {{one side and}} in the other side closes its shaped blades cutting the insulation around the conductor. After the sides have completed their strokes {{the two sides of the}} mechanism spread apart to push the cut tube of insulation from the end of the conductor. To use it, one simply places the wire in the jaws at the cutting slot matching the size of the conductor and squeezes the handles together. This device allows even a novice to strip most wires very quickly. The automatic <b>wire</b> <b>stripper's</b> cutter must be short, because it causes the jaws to twist, as described by Wood in the 1943 patent. All <b>wire</b> <b>strippers</b> are inherently limited to those wire sizes the cutting jaw notches will accommodate. An automatic <b>wire</b> <b>stripper's</b> short cutter limits it to fewer notches and a smaller range of wire sizes than most other types of <b>wire</b> <b>strippers.</b> The accuracy of the cutting blade opening determines the smallest conductor that can be reliably stripped. If the cutter opening is to small it will impinge on the conductor causing excess friction and more tension than the wire can withstand. If the cutter opening is too large the tension required to tear the remaining annulus of uncut insulation may be greater than the wire can withstand. Some models have an adjustable grip tension, to adjust the clamping force of the gripping jaw. The knob below the jaw on the yellow automatic strippers in the image below is a grip tension adjustment. Although in principle applicable to wire of any size, automatic <b>wire</b> <b>strippers</b> that are widely available have cutters that can accommodate conductors in a range of sizes no larger than 8 AWG nor smaller than 26 AWG, but not the entire range.|$|R
50|$|A US-style simple manual <b>wire</b> <b>stripper</b> is <b>a</b> pair of {{opposing}} blades much like scissors or wire cutters. The {{addition of a}} center notch {{makes it easier to}} cut the insulation without cutting the wire. This type of <b>wire</b> <b>stripper</b> is used by rotating it around the insulation while applying pressure {{in order to make a}} cut around the insulation. since the insulation is not bonded to the wire, it then pulls easily off the end. This type of <b>wire</b> <b>stripper</b> can be used on wires of any size. Another type of manual <b>wire</b> <b>stripper</b> is very similar to the simple design previously mentioned, except this type has several notches of varying size. This allows the user to match the notch size to the wire size, thereby eliminating the need for twisting, but can only be used on wire sizes that approximately match one of the notches. Once the device is clamped on, the remainder of the wire can simply be pulled out, leaving the insulation behind.|$|R

50|$|Typically {{the male}} {{connector}} is fitted to a cable, {{and the female}} to a panel on equipment.

30|$|In a stereotypical {{electronic}} textile project, {{the fundamental}} tools include different needles and scissors for the textile manipulation, a multimeter for electronic measuring tasks, <b>a</b> soldering iron, <b>wire</b> <b>strippers</b> and pliers to handle electronic components and materials. They are {{a selection of}} instruments to meet individual goals, but not distinctly attributable to the domain of an electronic textile craft. These tools are adapted to fit the task, or {{a different way to}} reach a similar output is found. Borrowing tools from other disciplines can impose challenges to the work though: The tools have not been specifically designed for the task for which they are used; hence, they might not perfectly support the scenario they are applied in. Appropriating existing tools may in many cases fulfill the task just fine. In a less ideal scenario though, their usage may harm the material or the material harm the tool. A seamstress for example would most likely not allow paper being cut with her fabric scissors as it may harm the blades, and one {{will not be able to}} achieve a clear cut with paper scissors on fabric in turn. Another challenge might be that the way to hold and apply a tool might interfere with routines otherwise genuine to the craft, and consequently lead to inferior quality of the output. Hence, on a practical level, the question arises whether the availability of more suitable tools could advance an emerging discipline of electronic crafts in terms of enabling better functional and aesthetic explorations. On a metaphorical level, it is interesting to explore if tools genuine to an electronic textile craft might also improve accessibility across diverse making cultures.|$|R

50|$|Stripping is {{the act of}} {{removing}} the protective polymer coating around optical fiber in preparation for fusion splicing. The splicing process begins by preparing both fiber ends for fusion, which requires that all protective coating is removed or stripped from the ends of each fiber. Fiber optical stripping can be done using a special stripping and preparation unit that uses hot sulphuric acid or a controlled flow of hot air to remove the coating. There are also mechanical tools used for stripping fiber which are similar to copper <b>wire</b> <b>strippers.</b> Fiber optical stripping and preparation equipment used in fusion splicing is commercially available through {{a small number of}} specialized companies, which usually also design machines used for fiber optical recoating.|$|R

50|$|The {{automatic}} <b>wire</b> <b>stripper</b> {{was first}} patented in 1915 by Stuart G. Wood of Brooklyn, NY. The design was refined by Herman Gerhard Jan Voogd of the Netherlands eliminating the awkward 4 bar mechanism {{taking on the}} general outline that it has kept since. Wood, now of Rockville IL, added reinforcements, replaceable blades, and blade stops in 1943 The 1943 design was also equipped to block the halves open after stripping to avoid crushing the freshly stripped wire as it returned to its rest position. A second actuation released the mechanism {{to return to the}} rest position. The action was further refined by Wood and finally by Eugene D. Hindenburg of DeKalb, IL. The final refinement of the action shifted the sequence of operations so that the stripping blades opened before any other part of the mechanism began to return to the rest position while the clamping jaws retraced the sequence of operation, remaining closed until the handles were fully released.|$|R

40|$|This {{investigation}} of robot capabilities with extravehicular activity (EVA) equipment looks at how improvements in dexterity are enabling robots to perform tasks {{once thought to}} be beyond machines. The approach is qualitative, using the Robonaut system at the Johnson Space Center (JSC), performing task trials that offer a quick look at this system's high degree of dexterity and the demands of EVA. Specific EVA tools attempted include tether hooks, power torque tools, and rock scoops, as well as conventional tools like scissors, <b>wire</b> <b>strippers,</b> forceps, and wrenches. More complex EVA equipment was also studied, with more complete tasks that mix tools, EVA hand rails, tethers, tools boxes, PIP pins, and EVA electrical connectors. These task trials have been ongoing over an 18 month period, as the Robonaut system evolved to its current 43 degree of freedom (DOF) configuration, soon to expand to over 50. In each case, the number of teleoperators is reported, with rough numbers of attempts and their experience level, with a subjective difficulty rating assigned to each piece of EVA equipment and function. JSC' s Robonaut system was successful with all attempted EVA hardware, suggesting new options for human and robot teams working together in space...|$|R
