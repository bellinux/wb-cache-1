50|$|Numerous {{proposals}} {{have been made}} for alternative base units of metric time. On March 28, 1794, {{the president of the}} commission which developed the metric system, Joseph Louis Lagrange, proposed in a report to the commission the names déci-jour and centi-jour (deciday and centiday in English). Base units equivalent to decimal divisions of the day, such as 1/10, 1/100, 1/1000, or 1/100,000 day, or other divisions of the day, such as 1/20 or 1/40 day, have also been proposed, with various names, and multiple and submultiple units formed with metric prefixes.

5000|$|Adopting {{the metric}} system was {{discussed}} in Parliament {{as early as}} 1818 and some industries and even some government agencies had metricated, or {{were in the process}} of metricating by the mid 1960s. However, a formal government policy to support metrication was not agreed until 1965. This policy, initiated in response to requests from industry, was to support voluntary metrication, with costs picked up where they fell. In 1969 the government created the Metrication Board as a quango to promote and coordinate metrication. In 1978, after some carpet retailers reverted to pricing by the square yard rather than the square metre, government policy shifted, and they started issuing orders making metrication mandatory in certain sectors. In 1980 government policy shifted again to prefer voluntary metrication, and the Metrication Board was abolished. By the time the Metrication Board was wound up, all the economic sectors that fell within its remit except road signage and parts of the retail trade sector had metricated.

50|$|Third Front {{projects}} {{followed the}} principle “Close to the mountains, dispersed, and hidden” (kaoshan, fensan, yinbi). This principle {{was motivated by}} national defense considerations, plants were required to be hidden {{in the mountains and}} were not allowed to be geographically clustered to minimize the damage of air strikes. This principle was first used to guide the location choices of some highly confidential firms, but was quickly used as the guiding principle for location choices of essentially all Third Front projects. As the Cultural Revolution ignited leftist extremism, Lin Biao, Chen Boda also replaced Li Fuchun, Peng Dehuai, and Deng Xiaoping as the actual leaders of the Third Front Movement. Peng and Deng were later purged by their political enemies. Lin Biao revised the principle to “Close to the mountains, dispersed, and hidden in the caves” (kaoshan, fensan, jindong), which required Third Front Projects to be located in the caves. Many plants were not able to produce qualified products due to difficult locations. An electronic plant in Guiyang was built in the caves. The humidity and dim light induced the products to be deficient. Plants were required to be dispersed geographically such that there would be <b>alternative</b> <b>units</b> producing in case some plants were destroyed. However, this principle was used to an extreme. About 90% of the 400 new Third Front projects in Shaanxi were located in places far away from cities. The airplane factory in Hanzhong, Shaanxi had 28 units of the plant were spread in 2 districts, 7 counties. One unit was spread in 7 villages. It was scoffed by some as “building airplanes by the side of henhouse”. Assembling parts required dozens of miles of transportation. While transportation infrastructure and communication was poor, production was often interrupted. Some plants were located in places prone to geographic hazards such as landslides and earthquakes. Location choices of the Third Front projects also did not consider accessibility to inputs and outputs. A shipyard on the Yangtze River near Chongqing was responsible to produce conventional powered submarines in the 70s. The up stream of the Yangtze River is too shallow for submarines. The test the submarines, they needed to be tugged to Shanghai some 2000 kilometers down the stream where the Yangtze meets the Pacific. No doubt the production is very inefficient.|$|E

40|$|Quantitative {{information}} can appear in different units (e. g., 7 -year warranty = 84 -month warranty). This article demonstrates that attribute differences appear larger on scales {{with a higher}} number of units; expressing quality information on such an expanded scale makes consumers switch to a higher-quality option. Testifying to its practical importance, expressing the energy content of snacks in kilojoules rather than kilocalories increases {{the choice of a}} healthy snack. The unit effect occurs because consumers focus on the number rather than the type of units in which information is expressed (numerosity effect). Therefore, reminding consumers of <b>alternative</b> <b>units</b> in which {{information can}} be expressed eliminates the unit effect. Finally, the unit effect moderates relative thinking: consumers are more sensitive to relative attribute differences when the attribute is expressed on expanded scales.

40|$|Abstract. Making multi-terabyte {{scientific}} databases publicly accessible {{over the}} Internet is increasingly important in disciplines such as Biology and Astronomy. However, contention at a centralized, backend database {{is a major}} performance bottleneck limiting the scalability of Internet-based, database applications. Mid-tier caching reduces contention at the backend database by distributing database operations to the cache, increasing scalability. To improve the performance of mid-tier caches, we propose the caching of query prototypes, a novel, workload-driven unit of cache replacement in which the cache object is chosen from various classes of queries in the workload. While previous systems employed statically defined units of cache replacement, our approach adapts to workload changes, requires no prior knowledge about the workload, and is transparent to the application. Our experiments over a one-month, 1. 4 million query Astronomy workload demonstrate up to 70 % reduction in network traffic and reduce query response time by up to a factor of three compared to <b>alternative</b> <b>units</b> of cache replacement. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} non-equivalent {{structures}} {{have been found}} in the atomistic studies of periodic grain boundaries. These can transform into each other by removal or insertion of layers of atoms parallel to the boundary [19]. The ensuing multiplicity of structures is very extensive for long period, general, boundaries. We show here that low energy configurations of vacancies in grain boundaries correspond to the local presence of units of alternative structures so that absorption or emission of vacancies at a boundary can be regarded as local structural transformations. Hence, as the temperature rises and the equilibrium concentration of vacancies increases the disorder corresponding to occurrence of various <b>alternative</b> <b>units</b> in the boundary increases. This may happen either gradually or through an order-disorder transformation. It is further shown that accumulation of vacancies or impurities in the boundary may induce shear transformations between the alternative boundary structures which leads {{at the same time to}} the migration of the boundary. The significance of these different structural transformations for various grain boundary phenomena is discussed...|$|E
