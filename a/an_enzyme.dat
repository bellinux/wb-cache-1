Considerable changes in the shape {{and the size of}} the molecules occurred upon binding of Mg-nucleotide or TSAC.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Treatment of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase {{with the}} arginyl reagent phenylglyoxal {{resulted}} in complete desensitization to fructose 6 -phosphate (F 6 P) activation, and partial desensitization to pyruvate activation. The enzyme was protected from desensitization by ATP, F 6 P, pyruvate, and phosphate. Alignment studies revealed that this enzyme contains arginine residues in the amino-terminal region that are relatively conserved in similarly regulated ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylases. To functionally evaluate the role(s) of these arginines, alanine scanning mutagenesis {{was performed to}} generate the following enzymes: R 5 A, R 11 A, R 22 A, R 25 A, R 32 A, R 33 A, R 45 A, and R 60 A. All of the enzymes, except R 60 A, were successfully expressed and purified to near homogeneity. Both the R 5 A and R 11 <b>A</b> <b>enzymes</b> displayed desensitization to pyruvate, partial activation by F 6 P, and increased sensitivity to phosphate inhibition. Both the R 22 A and R 25 <b>A</b> <b>enzymes</b> exhibited reduced Vmax values {{in the absence of}} activators, lower apparent affinities for ATP and F 6 P, and reduced sensitivities to phosphate.

40|$|The X-ray {{structure}} of the Escherichia coli aspartate transcarbamoylase with the bisubstrate analog phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate (PALA) bound shows that PALA interacts with Lys 84 from an adjacent catalytic chain. To probe the function of Lys 84, site-specific mutagenesis was used to convert Lys 84 to alanine, threonine, and asparagine. The K 84 N and K 84 T enzymes exhibited 0. 08 and 0. 29 % of {{the activity of the}} wild-type enzyme, respectively. However, the K 84 <b>A</b> <b>enzyme</b> retained 12 % of the activity of the wild-type enzyme. For each of these enzymes, the affinity for aspartate was reduced 5 - to 10 -fold, and the affinity for carbamoyl phosphate was reduced 10 - to 30 -fold. The enzymes K 84 N and K 84 T exhibited no appreciable cooperativity, whereas the K 84 <b>A</b> <b>enzyme</b> exhibited <b>a</b> Hill coefficient of 1. 8. The residual cooperativity and enhanced activity of the K 84 <b>A</b> <b>enzyme</b> suggest that in this enzyme another mechanism functions to restore catalytic activity. Modeling studies as well as molecular dynamics simulations suggest {{that in the case of}} only the K 84 <b>A</b> <b>enzyme,</b> the lysine residue at position 83 can reorient into the active site and complement for the loss of Lys 84. This hypothesis was tested by the creation and analysis of the K 83 <b>A</b> <b>enzyme</b> and <b>a</b> double mutant <b>enzyme</b> (DM) that has both Lys 83 and Lys 84 replaced by alanine. The DM enzyme has no cooperativity and exhibited 0. 18 % of wild-type activity, while the K 83 <b>A</b> <b>enzyme</b> exhibited 61 % of wild-type activity. These data suggest that Lys 84 is not only catalytically important, but is also essential for binding both substrates and creation of the high-activity, high-affinity active site. Since low-angle X-ray scattering demonstrated that the mutant enzymes can be converted to the R-structural state, the loss of cooperativity must be related to the inability of these mutant enzymes to form the high-activity, high-affinity active site characteristic of the R-functional state of the enzyme...|$|R

5|$|As the environments of most {{organisms are}} {{constantly}} changing, {{the reactions of}} metabolism must be finely regulated to maintain a constant set of conditions within cells, a condition called homeostasis. Metabolic regulation also allows organisms to respond to signals and interact actively with their environments. Two closely linked concepts are important for understanding how metabolic pathways are controlled. Firstly, the regulation of <b>an</b> <b>enzyme</b> in a pathway is how its activity is increased and decreased in response to signals. Secondly, the control exerted by this enzyme is the effect that these changes in its activity have on the overall rate of the pathway (the flux through the pathway).

40|$|All {{forms of}} serine hydroxymethyltransferase, {{for which a}} primary {{structure}} is known, have five threonine residues near the active-site lysyl residue (K 229) that forms the internal aldimine with pyridoxal phosphate. For Escherichia coli serine hydroxymethyltransferase each of these threonine residues has been changed to an alanine residue. The resulting five mutant enzymes were purified and characterized with respect to kinetic and spectral properties. The mutant <b>enzymes</b> T 224 <b>A</b> and T 227 A showed no significant changes in kinetic and spectral properties compared to the wild-type enzyme. The T 225 A and T 230 <b>A</b> <b>enzymes</b> exhibited differences in K(m) and k(cat) values but exhibited the same spectral properties as the wild-type enzyme. The four threonine residues at positions 224, 225, 227, and 230 do not {{play a critical role}} in the mechanism of the enzyme. The T 226 <b>A</b> <b>enzyme</b> had nearly normal affinity for substrates and coenzymes but had only 3 % of the catalytic activity of the wild-type enzyme. The spectrum of the T 226 <b>A</b> <b>enzyme</b> in the presence of amino acid substrates showed a large absorption maximum at 343 nm with only a small absorption band at 425 nm, unlike the wild-type enzyme whose enzyme-substrate complexes absorb at 425 nm. Rapid reaction studies showed that when amino acid substrates and substrate analogues were added to the T 226 <b>A</b> <b>enzyme,</b> the internal aldimine absorbing at 422 nm was rapidly converted to a complex absorbing at 343 nm in a second-order process. This was followed by a very slow first-order formation of a complex absorbing at 425 nm. Variation of the initial rapid second-order process as a function of pH suggested that the anionic form of the amino acid forms the first complex with the enzyme.
