5|$|An <b>area</b> <b>of</b> low {{pressure}} tracked across southeastern Canada during the 12th, which brought an arctic front across the Mid Atlantic region {{late on the}} 12th. As this occurred, a strong <b>area</b> <b>of</b> high pressure located across central Canada built down into the Northeast, allowing very cold air to spill southward ultimately leading to {{what is known as}} cold air damming. This occurs east of the mountains down through the Mid Atlantic states. Meanwhile, a Pacific storm slammed onto the California coast during the 11th and as it moved eastward, a new <b>area</b> <b>of</b> {{low pressure}} developed across southeastern Colorado and the Texas Panhandle.|$|E
