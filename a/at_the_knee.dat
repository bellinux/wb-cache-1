5|$|Physical {{examination}} {{of a patient}} with ankle OCD often returns symptoms of joint effusion, crepitus, and diffuse or localized tenderness. Examination often reveals symptoms of generalized joint pain, swelling, and times with limited range of motion. Some with loose body lesions may report catching, locking, or both. The possibility of microtrauma emphasizes a need for evaluation of biomechanical forces <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> in a physical examination. As a result, the alignment and rotation of all major joints in the affected extremity is common, as are extrinsic and intrinsic abnormalities concerning the affected joint, including laxity.|$|E
5|$|Prepatellar {{bursitis}} is an {{inflammation of}} the prepatellar bursa {{at the front of}} the knee. It is marked by swelling <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee,</b> which can be tender to the touch but which does not restrict the knee's range of motion. It is most commonly caused by trauma to the knee, either by a single acute instance or by chronic trauma over time. As such, prepatellar bursitis commonly occurs among individuals whose professions require frequent kneeling.|$|E
25|$|If the bowler's back foot {{is behind}} {{parallel}} to the bowling crease, the bowler loses momentum and speed when delivering the ball. This is because the bowler's back foot bends <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> and causes momentum to be lost and the bowler then has {{to go back and}} lift their whole body back upright.|$|E

25|$|Racewalking {{is a form}} of {{competitive}} walking that usually takes place on open-air roads, although running tracks are also occasionally used. Racewalking is the only sport in athletics in which judges monitor athletes on their technique. Racewalkers must always have a foot in contact with the ground and their advancing leg must be straightened, not bent <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> – failure to follow these rules results in disqualification from the race.|$|E
25|$|In 1666, Charles II of England, Scotland and Ireland, {{following}} the earlier example of Louis XIV of France, decreed that at court, men were {{to wear a}} long coat, a vest or waistcoat (originally called a petticoat, a term which later became applied solely to women's dress), a cravat, a periwig or wig, and breeches gathered <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee,</b> {{as well as a}} hat for outdoor wear. By 1680, this more sober uniform-like outfit of coat, waistcoat, and breeches became the norm for formal dress.|$|E
25|$|Dorsiflexion: In {{order to}} stretch the {{anterior}} muscles of the lower leg, crossover shin stretches work well. This motion will stretch the dorsiflexion muscles, mainly the anterior tibialis, extensor hallucis longus and extensor digitorum longus, by slowly causing the muscles to lengthen as body weight is leaned on the ankle joint by using the floor as resistance against {{the top of the}} foot. Crossover shin stretches can vary in intensity depending on the amount of body weight applied on the ankle joint as the individual bends <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee.</b> This stretch is typically held for 15–30 seconds.|$|E

First position puts a risk for injury <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>knees.</b> Meniscal tears and dislocations are common <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>knees</b> because {{it is easy to}} let <b>the</b> <b>knees</b> slide forward while turned out in first position.|$|R

25|$|The triskelion is {{an ancient}} symbol of Sicily, {{with the head of}} the Gorgon, whose hair are snakes, from which radiate three legs bent <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee.</b> The symbol dates back to when Sicily was part of Magna Graecia, the colonial {{extension}} of Greece beyond the Aegean. Pliny the Elder attributes the origin of the triskelion of Sicily to the triangular form of the island, the ancient Trinacria (from the Greek tri- (three) and akra (end, limb)), which consists of three large capes equidistant from each other, pointing in their respective directions, the names of which were Pelorus, Pachynus, and Lilybæum.|$|E
25|$|There {{were two}} {{significant}} Confederate casualties. Both {{were treated with}} battlefield amputations, {{believed to be the}} first such operations of the war. One was a Virginia Military Institute cadet, Fauntleroy Daingerfield. The other Confederate was James E. Hanger, an 18-year-old college student. After recovering and being released, Hanger returned home to Virginia. He made an artificial leg from barrel staves with a hinge <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee.</b> His design worked so well that the Virginia State Legislature commissioned him to manufacture the “Hanger Limb” for other wounded soldiers. After the war, Hanger patented his prosthetic device and founded what is now the Hanger Orthopedic Group, Inc. As of 2007, Hanger Orthopedic Group is the United States market leader in the manufacture of artificial limbs.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} {{posterior}} thigh muscles. The biceps femoris has two heads: The long head has its origin on the ischial tuberosity {{together with the}} semitendinosus and acts on two joints. The short head originates from the middle third of the linea aspera on the shaft of the femur and the lateral intermuscular septum of thigh, and acts on only one joint. These two heads unite to form the biceps which inserts {{on the head of}} the fibula. The biceps flexes the knee joint and rotates the flexed leg laterally— it is the only lateral rotator of the knee and thus has to oppose all medial rotator. Additionally, the long head extends the hip joint. The semitendinosus and the semimembranosus share their origin with the long head of the biceps, and both attaches on the medial side of the proximal head of the tibia together with the gracilis and sartorius to form the pes anserinus. The semitendinosus acts on two joints; extension of the hip, flexion of the knee, and medial rotation of the leg. Distally, the semimembranosus' tendon is divided into three parts referred to as the pes anserinus profondus. Functionally, the semimembranosus is similar to the semitendinosus, and thus produces extension at the hip joint and flexion and medial rotation <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee.</b>|$|E

This species has a hopping {{frequency}} of 3.5 strides per second, with a stride length of [...] When hopping, proximal muscles <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> and hip joints generate {{most of the}} power for each leap, which are delivered by multi-joint muscles at the ankle. As it lands, {{the energy of the}} jump is converted into strain energy made when its leg tendons are stretched.

Lubbock describes Balla's motion effects as [...] "creating new sensations and new phenomena", and evoking the motion of shuffling cards and the embodiment of ghosts.|$|E

[...] A mob gathered around, spat on him, kicked him, and stripped him of his clothes; his left shoulder was crushed with the butt of a rifle and he was bayoneted in his left foot and abdominal area.

[...] Duke was devastated when, on October 20, 1909, his wife of fifty years, Henrietta, died of sudden heart failure. [...] Afterward, he lived with his daughter Julia and her family in Louisville's Cherokee Park. [...] Prior to his death in 1916, Duke {{had been one of the}} last surviving Confederate general officers. In his final years he spent much of his time handling requests made by those with questions about the Confederacy, even during the time that he was recovering from cataract surgery in 1914. Two years later, during a visit to his daughter, Mary Currie, in Massachusetts, Duke underwent surgery in a New York City hospital, first, on September 1, to have his right foot amputated and then, on September 11, to have his right leg amputated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee.</b> Five days later, on September 16, 1916, he died, one of the last surviving high-ranking Confederate officers. Duke was buried beside his wife in front of the John Hunt Morgan grave in the Hunt family plot in Lexington Cemetery.

Rama is shown here in a standing position with bow in the right hand and arrow in the left hand. Other decorative art depiction in Rama's image consists of Kundalas (ear-rings), haras (garlands), valayas, yagnopavita (sacred thread) and so forth. Lakshmana's figure is sculpted in tribhanga posture with his right hand held down free while the left hand holds a bow. Adornments carved on this image are kirtimukuta (conical crown), graivevakas, channavira, udarbandha (waist band), yagnopavita [...] and purnaruka.
