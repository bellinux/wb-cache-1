40|$|Composition of merger <b>and</b> <b>acquisition</b> risk of {{agricultural}} manufacturing enterprises in China is analyzed, which is mainly strategic risk, external risk, transaction risk and integrated risk. And {{there are a}} total of 16 specific sources of risk. Concrete assessment methods for merger <b>and</b> <b>acquisition</b> risk {{of agricultural}} manufacturing enterprises are introduced. Firstly, set up the risk factor sets at first and second layers and divide merger <b>and</b> <b>acquisition</b> risk into 5 layers; establish risk assessment matrix according to the score by expert group. Secondly, determine the weights of the various risk factors by the ideology of information entropy. Finally, find out the subordinated vector of risk factor, construct risk assessment matrix, calculate the second grade risk assessment vector and conduct risk assessment. Taking an agricultural manufacturing enterprise as an example, fuzzy mathematics method is used to conduct risk assessment on its merger <b>and</b> <b>acquisition</b> project. Result shows that the overall risk of merger <b>and</b> <b>acquisition</b> project is relatively low, <b>and</b> merger <b>and</b> <b>acquisition</b> can be implemented.

5|$|According to Sugiura, Monolith Soft's {{relations}} with Namco {{had undergone a}} negative change after Nakamura retired as head of Namco in 2002, three years before the merger with Bandai. The company underwent changes and Monolith Soft felt they were being given less creative freedom, and the newly-created Namco Bandai was less willing to take creative risks. The company then received consultation from Shinji Hatano, an executive director at Nintendo, who advised them to continue creating innovative projects. Spurred on by Hatano's supportive attitude, Monolith Soft decided {{to break away from}} Namco Bandai to become a Nintendo subsidiary; this provided Monolith Soft creative freedom in exchange for software development exclusivity for Nintendo platforms. Nintendo's purchasing of the majority of Monolith Soft's shares from Bandai Namco Holdings was publicly announced in April 2007. Nintendo became the majority shareholder of Monolith Soft with 80% of shares, while Bandai Namco retained 16% and remained as a development partner. Namco Bandai stated that the exchange of Monolith Soft shares would strengthen their relationship with Nintendo. The remaining shares were divided between Takahashi, Sugiura and Honne. Nintendo's acquisition of Monolith Soft contrasted against the company's previous publicized approach of not taking part in mergers <b>and</b> <b>acquisitions</b> of other studios and companies. In a statement on the matter, then-CEO of Nintendo Satoru Iwata said that the deal was initiated due to the positive relations between Sugiura and Nintendo, and the two company's parallel design and development philosophies.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the effects of the {{organizational}} slack <b>and</b> <b>acquisition</b> experience on acquisition behavior across varying environmental conditions. Drawing from behavioral theory and the threat-rigidity hypothesis, the paper explores firm acquisition behavior, in terms of type of <b>acquisitions,</b> before <b>and</b> during the recent economic downturn. Design/methodology/approach – Using data on 385 acquisitions in Italy in the period 2007 - 2010, the paper tests hypotheses on how organizational slack <b>and</b> <b>acquisition</b> experience influence the likelihood of cross-border <b>and</b> diversifying <b>acquisitions</b> relative to domestic, non-diversifying <b>acquisitions</b> prior to <b>and</b> during the economic downturn. Findings – Results suggest that the availability of financial resources <b>and</b> <b>acquisition</b> experience both have an important influence on acquisition behavior. Firms with greater slack <b>and</b> <b>acquisition</b> experience were more likely to make diversifying and/or cross-border acquisitions, compared to domestic non diversifying acquisitions, particularly during an economic downturn, than firms with lower levels of slack <b>and</b> <b>acquisition</b> experience. Originality/value – The paper extends behavioral theory and threat-rigidity hypothesis, highlighting their applicability to acquisition behavior across varying economic conditions. Slack resources <b>and</b> <b>acquisition</b> experience appear to be particularly salient during challenging economic times...|$|R
