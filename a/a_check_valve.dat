5|$|When {{thermoplastics}} are moulded, typically pelletised {{raw material}} is fed through a hopper into a heated barrel with a reciprocating screw. Upon {{entrance to the}} barrel, the temperature increases and the Van der Waals forces that resist relative flow of individual chains are weakened {{as a result of}} increased space between molecules at higher thermal energy states. This process reduces its viscosity, which enables the polymer to flow with the driving force of the injection unit. The screw delivers the raw material forward, mixes and homogenises the thermal and viscous distributions of the polymer, and reduces the required heating time by mechanically shearing the material and adding a significant amount of frictional heating to the polymer. The material feeds forward through <b>a</b> <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> and collects {{at the front of the}} screw into a volume known as a shot. A shot is the volume of material that is used to fill the mould cavity, compensate for shrinkage, and provide a cushion (approximately 10% of the total shot volume, which remains in the barrel and prevents the screw from bottoming out) to transfer pressure from the screw to the mould cavity. When enough material has gathered, the material is forced at high pressure and velocity into the part forming cavity. To prevent spikes in pressure, the process normally uses a transfer position corresponding to a 95–98% full cavity where the screw shifts from a constant velocity to a constant pressure control. Often injection times are well under 1 second. Once the screw reaches the transfer position the packing pressure is applied, which completes mould filling and compensates for thermal shrinkage, which is quite high for thermoplastics relative to many other materials. The packing pressure is applied until the gate (cavity entrance) solidifies. Due to its small size, the gate is normally the first place to solidify through its entire thickness. Once the gate solidifies, no more material can enter the cavity; accordingly, the screw reciprocates and acquires material for the next cycle while the material within the mould cools so that it can be ejected and be dimensionally stable. This cooling duration is dramatically reduced by the use of cooling lines circulating water or oil from an external temperature controller. Once the required temperature has been achieved, the mould opens and an array of pins, sleeves, strippers, etc. are driven forward to demould the article. Then, the mould closes and the process is repeated.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> lets {{gas flow}} in one {{direction}} only. It is usually a chamber containing a ball that is pressed against one end by a spring. Gas flow one way pushes {{the ball out of}} the way, and a lack of flow or a reverse flow allows the spring to push the ball into the inlet, blocking it. Not to be confused with a flashback arrestor, <b>a</b> <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> is not designed to block a shock wave. The shock wave could occur while the ball is so far from the inlet that the wave will get past the ball before it can reach its off position.|$|E

This arrangement helps to reduce the above described pressure loss problems, and also reduces the time required for the brakes to release, since the brake pipe only has to recharge itself.|$|E

25|$|The {{flashback}} arrestor (not {{to be confused}} with <b>a</b> <b>check</b> <b>valve)</b> prevents shock waves from downstream coming back up the hoses and entering the cylinder, possibly rupturing it, as there are quantities of fuel/oxygen mixtures inside parts of the equipment (specifically within the mixer and blowpipe/nozzle) that may explode if the equipment is incorrectly shut down, and acetylene decomposes at excessive pressures or temperatures. In case the pressure wave has created a leak downstream of the {{flashback arrestor}}, it will remain switched off until someone resets it.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} {{function}} of a diode is to allow an electric current to pass in one direction (called the diode's forward direction), while blocking it in the opposite (the reverse). As such, the diode {{can be viewed as}} an electronic version of <b>a</b> <b>check</b> <b>valve.</b> This unidirectional behavior is called rectification, and is used to convert alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC). Forms of rectifiers, diodes can be used for such tasks as extracting modulation from radio signals in radio receivers.|$|E
2500|$|Shelby Tube Sampler. Utilized in the 'Standard Practice for Thin-Walled Tube Sampling of Soils for Geotechnical Purposes' (ASTM D 1587). [...] This sampler {{consists}} of a thin-walled tube with a cutting edge at the toe. A sampler head attaches the tube to the drill rod, and contains <b>a</b> <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> and pressure vents. [...] Generally used in cohesive soils, this sampler is advanced into the soil layer, generally 6" [...] less than {{the length of the}} tube. The vacuum created by the check valve and cohesion of the sample in the tube cause the sample to be retained when the tube is withdrawn. Standard ASTM dimensions are; 2" [...] OD, 36" [...] long, 18 gauge thickness; 3" [...] OD, 36" [...] long, 16 gauge thickness; and 5" [...] OD, 54" [...] long, 11 gauge thickness. It should be noted that ASTM allows other diameters {{as long as they are}} proportional to the standardized tube designs, and tube length is to be suited for field conditions. Soil sampled in this manner is considered undisturbed.|$|E

2500|$|Discovery later {{rolled out}} from the VAB to Launch Complex 39A on 4 August 2009, in a slow drive {{on the top of}} the Crawler-transporter. The [...] rollout began at 02:07 EDT, and ended with the launch {{platform}} secured in place at about 13:50 EDT. The move took longer than expected due to adverse weather conditions, which included lightning warnings. The crawler also had to pause occasionally so mud could be removed from its treads and bearings. Technicians then quickly prepared the shuttle to host the crew’s countdown dress rehearsal known as the Terminal Countdown Demonstration Test (TCDT). Discovery’s seven astronauts flew to Kennedy on 5 August 2009 for the training activity which concludes later in the week with a complete practice countdown, minus liftoff, involving the crew and the launch team. Meanwhile, in an unprecedented operation, modifications were made to the left Solid rocket booster on the pad. The modifications involved replacement of <b>a</b> <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> filter assembly in the booster which was found to have broken. In a potentially delaying factor, in depth testing of the external tank with X-ray revealed voids in the foam which might have formed during the injection molding of the foam. This has also been decided as a suspect factor in the foam shedding during STS-127. The air in the voids could have expanded due to the high temperatures generated during ascent thus breaking the foam. The reviews considered a rollback as an option since the defect could not be set right in the pad. Later, the tank was cleared for launch as is without any additional inspections.|$|E

40|$|Large primary-secondary {{chilled water}} systems often suffer from low chilled water {{temperature}} difference (i. e., known as low delta-T central plant syndrome) during operation. This paper presents a detailed study {{to investigate the}} feasibility and potential benefits related {{to the use of}} <b>a</b> bypass <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> in the chiller decouple line to solve this operational problem and hence, to improve the overall system operating efficiency. The objective {{of this study is to}} provide some guidance and necessary confidence as well as the awareness of potential problems that may arise when <b>a</b> bypass <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> is considered to handle the low delta-T syndrome. Based on testing the effects of the low delta-T syndrome, the performances of the systems with and without the bypass <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> are then evaluated by using a simulated virtual system. In the tests, the low delta-T syndrome was introduced through air-side fouling by changing the air-side thermal resistance coefficient in the cooling coil model. The results show that, if the chilled water system suffered from 20 % air-side fouling, about 6. 77 % total energy of the chilled water system studied can be saved when <b>a</b> bypass <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> is used, as compared to that without the bypass <b>check</b> <b>valve.</b> Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R

There are also double ball <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> {{in which there are}} two ball/seat combinations sequentially in the same body to ensure positive leak-tight shutoff when blocking reverse flow; and piston <b>check</b> <b>valves,</b> wafer <b>check</b> <b>valves,</b> and ball-and-cone <b>check</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} avoid leakage at the packing or seal {{particularly}} when a liquid is dangerous, toxic, or noxious, diaphragm pumps are used for metering. Diaphragm pumps have a diaphragm through which repeated compression/decompression motion is transmitted. The liquid does not penetrate through the diaphragm, so the liquid inside the pump is sealed off from the outside. Such motion changes the volume of a chamber in the pump head so that liquid enters through <b>an</b> inlet <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> during decompression and exits through <b>an</b> outlet <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> during compression, {{in a manner similar}} to piston pumps. Diaphragm pumps can also be made which discharge at fairly high pressure. Diaphragm metering pumps are commonly hydraulically driven.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{hydraulic}} fuses. The first one acts like a pressure relief valve, venting in case of a pressure surge. The second is more or less like <b>a</b> <b>check</b> <b>valve.</b> The only difference is <b>a</b> <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> is in place to prevent upstream fluid from coming back and venting out. A fuse is in place before the venting area and stops fluid from venting forward of it.|$|E

50|$|Automatic <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> are {{required}} to prevent back pressure. Regulations for these <b>check</b> <b>valves</b> specify the design capabilities of the valve used, according to the hazard. Category 2 contamination may be prevented by <b>a</b> single <b>check</b> <b>valve,</b> but category 3 requires <b>a</b> double <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> (these are manufactured as a convenient single unit, or even integrated into tap (faucet) fittings). Category 5 requires an air gap, not merely a valve. A recent introduction to the UK has been the Reduced Pressure Zone (RPZ) valve, a form of double <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> where the intervening zone is drained and normally kept empty. If the downstream valve leaks and permits backflow, this will drain out through the vent rather than building up pressure against the upstream valve. These valves are complex, requiring certified installation and annual checks. They are used for category 4 systems, such as fire sprinklers where the system has an antifreeze additive.|$|R

40|$|<b>A</b> novel micro <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> {{which has}} nearly ideal fluidic {{shunting}} behaviors is presented. Featuring a parylene-based floating disk, this surface-micromachined <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> ultimately realizes both zero forward cracking pressure and zero reverse leakage in fluidic operations. Two different floating disk designs {{have been implemented}} to demonstrate functionality of the microvalve. Experimental data of underwater testing successfully show that in-channel floating-disk valves in both designs have great fluidic performance close to <b>an</b> ideal <b>check</b> <b>valve,</b> except the additional fluidic resistance {{in the order of}} 10 ^(13) N-s/m^ 5 based on dimensions of the fabricated devices. Their pressure loading limit have been confirmed to be higher than 300 kPa without water leakage. This type of micro <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> is believed to have great use of flow control in integrated microfluidics and lab-on-a-chip applications. ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>check</b> <b>valve,</b> clack valve, {{non-return}} valve, reflux valve, or one-way valve is a valve {{that normally}} allows fluid (liquid or gas) to flow through it {{in only one}} direction.|$|E

50|$|Other {{causes of}} water hammer are pump failure and check valve slam (due to sudden deceleration, <b>a</b> <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> may slam shut rapidly, {{depending}} on the dynamic characteristic of the check valve and {{the mass of the}} water between <b>a</b> <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> and tank). To alleviate this situation, it is recommended to install non-slam check valves as they do not rely on gravity or fluid flow for their closure. For vertical pipes, other suggestions include installing new piping that can be designed to include air chambers to alleviate the possible shockwave of water due to excess water flow.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> {{diaphragm}} <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> uses <b>a</b> flexing rubber diaphragm {{positioned to}} create a normally-closed valve.

Once positive pressure stops, the diaphragm automatically flexes back to its original closed position.|$|R
50|$|A {{hydraulic}} jack uses a liquid, which is incompressible, that is {{forced into a}} cylinder by a pump plunger. Oil is used since it is self lubricating and stable. When the plunger pulls back, it draws oil out of the reservoir through <b>a</b> suction <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> into the pump chamber. When the plunger moves forward, it pushes the oil through <b>a</b> discharge <b>check</b> <b>valve</b> into the cylinder. The suction valve ball is within the chamber and opens with each draw of the plunger. The discharge valve ball is outside the chamber and opens when the oil is pushed into the cylinder. At this point the suction ball within the chamber is forced shut and oil pressure builds in the cylinder.|$|R
