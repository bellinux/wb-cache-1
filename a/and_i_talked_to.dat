But the truth is that... let's put it this way, you've never seen two actors more {{completely}} subservient and prostrate themselves {{at the feet of}} a director. Stanley was absolutely thrilled with the film. He was still working on the film when he died. And he probably died because he finally relaxed. It was one of the happiest weekends of his life, right before he died, after he had shown the first cut to Terry, Tom and Nicole. He would have kept working on it, like he did on all of his films. But I know that from people around him personally, my partner who was his assistant for thirty years. And I thought about R. Lee Ermey for In the Bedroom. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> Stanley a lot about that film, and all I can say is Stanley was adamant that I shouldn't work with him for all kinds of reasons that I won't get into because {{there is no reason to}} do that to anyone, even if they are saying slanderous things that I know are completely untrue.|$|E

2500|$|As an Illinois State Senator, Obama {{supported}} Senate bill 0099 for [...] "age and developmentally appropriate" [...] sex education, {{which would}} have allowed parents to choose to withdraw their children from the classes. The bill was endorsed by the Illinois Parent Teacher Association, the Illinois State Medical Society, the Illinois Public Health Association, and the Illinois Education Association. In a debate in 2004, when questioned by Alan Keyes {{about what kind of}} sex education was [...] "age appropriate" [...] for kindergarteners, Obama said, [...] "I'll give you an example, because I have a six-year-old daughter and a three-year-old daughter, {{and one of the things}} my wife <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> our daughter about is the possibility of somebody touching them inappropriately, and what that might mean. And that was included specifically in the law, so that kindergarteners are able to exercise some possible protection against abuse...." [...] In 2007, in response to a similar attack from Mitt Romney, an Obama spokesperson stated his position that communities should determine the curriculum. The Illinois bill did not call for addressing all sex-related issues in kindergarten classes, and Obama has said that he [...] "does not support teaching explicit sex education to children in kindergarten." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{movie is}} a {{partnership}} among three faith-based companies: Samuel Goldwyn Films (which released Fireproof, Facing the Giants, and Amazing Grace), Outreach Films, and New Song Pictures. Writer and producer Jim Britts was inspired to make the movie after observing a simple problem: many teenagers are hurting. Britts, a Christian youth pastor in Southern California, and his wife, a schoolteacher, began taking the many stories of teens' struggles and molding them into a film. [...] "Every day my wife <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> teens who are {{in some kind of}} pain," [...] Britts said.

I held him tighter and tighter, till I nearly strangled him, and he gasped and gurgled and moaned. Oh! it was fine to see him. Then I found a cord in the drawer there and I bound him, and while I fastened the knots I laughed <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> him. I talked about that night in the storm when he threw his father"--he pointed a long, quivering finger at me--"threw him into the slate quarry, and about that day {{when he came to the}} Castle gate and brought me to the plantation, and suddenly caught me by the throat till he thought he had strangled me, and beat me on the head. Ah, how my head has burned ever since, ever since, ever since! Ah, Milly, come to me! Milly, I am on fire! My head is on fire! Ah, ah!" ...|$|E
60|$|I took {{at first}} the way towards Bremen, where our army was, and gave out that I was {{bringing}} reports and letters from the Prussian commandant of Warburg to headquarters; but, as soon as I got {{out of sight of}} the advanced sentinels, I turned bridle and rode into the Hesse-Cassel territory, which is luckily not very far from Warburg: and I promise you I was very glad to see the blue-and-red stripes on the barriers, which showed me that I was out of the land occupied by our countrymen. I rode to Hof, and the next day to Cassel, giving out that I was the bearer of despatches to Prince Henry, then on the Lower Rhine, and put up at the best hotel of the place, where the field-officers of the garrison had their ordinary. These gentlemen I treated to the best wines that the house afforded, for I was determined to keep up the character of the English gentleman, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> them about my English estates with a fluency that almost made me believe in the stories which I invented. I was even asked to an assembly at Wilhelmshohe, the Elector's palace, and danced a minuet there with the Hofmarshal's lovely daughter, and lost a few pieces to his excellency the first huntmaster of his Highness.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, then, I set {{myself to}} work to {{consider}} this business. Here was a rich man oppressing a poor one, and here was this rich man offering me one hundred dollars--which in my eyes was a regular fortune--to help him get things so fixed that he could keep on oppressing the poor one. Now, then, here was a chance for me to show my principles. Here was a chance for me to show myself what you, madam, call rigid; and rigid I was. I just set that dazzling one hundred dollars aside, much as I wanted it. Much as I actually needed it, I wouldn't look at it, or think of it. I just said to myself, 'If you can do any good in this matter, {{do it for the}} poor man;' and I did do it for Timothy Barker with his poor wife and seven children, only two of them old enough to help him in the gravel pit. I went to Spotkirk <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> him, and I let him see that if Timothy Barker showed up the Boilene business, as he threatened to do, it would be a bad day for the Spotkirk family. He tried hard to talk me over to his side, but I was rigid, madam, I was rigid, and the business ended in my getting seven per cent. of the profits of Boilene for that poor man, Timothy Barker, and his large family; and their domestic prosperity is entirely due--I say it without hesitation--to my efforts on their behalf, and to my rigidity in standing up for the poor against the rich." ...|$|E

6000|$|There was a shop {{the like}} of which I {{had never seen}} before. Its windows were filled with dress-coats for men, and dresses for women. But the studs of the shirts were made of stamped cloth upon the shirt front, {{and there were no}} {{trousers}} to those coats--nothing but a sweep of cheap black cloth falling like an abbé's frock. In the doorway sat a young man reading Pollock's Course of Time, and by that I knew that he was an undertaker. His name was Gring, which is a beautiful name, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> him on the mysteries of his Craft. He was an enthusiast and an artist. I told him how corpses were burnt in India. Said he: [...] "We're vastly superior. We hold--that is to say, embalm--our dead. So!" [...] Whereupon he produced the horrible weapons of his trade, and most practically showed me how you [...] "held" [...] a man back from that corruption which is his birthright. [...] "And I wish I could live a few generations just to see how my people keep. But I'm sure it's all right. Nothing can touch 'em after I've embalmed 'em." [...] Then he displayed one of those ghastly dress-suits, and when I laid a shuddering hand upon it, behold it crumpled to nothing, for the white linen was sewn on to the black cloth and--there was no back to it! That was the horror. The garment was a shell. [...] "We dress a man in that," [...] said Gring, laying it out tastily on the counter. [...] "As you see here, our caskets have a plate-glass window in front" [...] (Oh me, but that window in the coffin was fitted with plush like a brougham-window!), [...] "and you don't see anything below the level of the man's waistcoat. Consequently ..." [...] He unrolled the terrible cheap black cloth that falls down over the stark feet, and I jumped back. [...] "Of course a man can be dressed in his own clothes if he likes, but these are the regular things: and for women look at this!" [...] He took up the body of a high-necked dinner-dress in subdued lilac, slashed and puffed and bedeviled with black, but, like the dress-suit, backless, and below the waist turning to shroud. [...] "That's for an old maid. But for young girls we give white with imitation pearls round the neck. That looks very pretty through the window of the casket--you see there's a cushion for the head--with flowers banked all round." [...] Can you imagine anything more awful than to take your last rest as much of a dead fraud as ever you were a living lie--to go into the darkness one half of you shaved, trimmed and dressed for an evening party, while the other half--the half that your friends cannot see--is enwrapped in a flapping black sheet? ...|$|E
