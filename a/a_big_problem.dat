5|$|Some authors like Boog and Lewin opine {{that while}} Creveld's {{statistics}} regarding the losses of supplies are not wrong {{and that the}} vast distances were <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>problem,</b> {{the failure of the}} seaborne supply lines was still a deciding factor because operationally effective supplies often failed to arrive at decisive moments of the campaigns. Douglas Austin points out that the overall port capacity at Tobruk and Benghazi was actually sufficient and that the recently published Enigma intercepts show that it was the bulk losses at sea (and not unloading or getting the supplies to forward areas) that had the greater impact on Rommel's decisions {{as well as those of}} other German commanders, like Kesselring. Levine dismisses poor port capacity and lack of transport vehicles as the Afrika Korps' crucial weaknesses, citing evidences gathered on British intelligence by Hinsley and Bennett. Others point out Rommel's dependence on captured resources as compensation for the unstable supply lines and unfulfilled promises (by 1942, 85% of his transport were captured vehicles). Butler opines that the myth of Rommel's bad logistical management is the result of rumours started by Halder.|$|E
5|$|Stojanović left Grmeč {{and went}} to Skender Vakuf in {{northwest}} central Bosnia {{to participate in the}} first regional conference of the KPJ in Bosanska Krajina, which was held from 21 to 23February 1942. In the Partisan territorial structure, the military-political region of Bosanska Krajina included central Bosnia. At the Skender Vakuf conference, presided over by Pucar, Stojanović and Karabegović, the participants analysed the military and political situation in the region. The increase of Chetnik influencewhich was strongest in southeastern Bosanska Krajina and northwest central Bosnia in the zones of responsibility of the 3rd and 4th Krajina Detachmentswas <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>problem</b> for the KPJ. A number of Partisans of these detachments joined the Chetnik side. Only in Kozara had Chetnik influence been held at bay. At the conference, Stojanović was appointed to lead a unified command of Partisan forces in Bosanska Krajina, but on 24February he was replaced with Kosta Nađ. The unified command was named the Operational Headquarters for Bosanska Krajina, and Stojanović became its chief of staff and deputy commander.|$|E

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>big</b> <b>problem</b> for SKM are {{homeless}} people who in winter time seek {{shelter in the}} trains. SKM is trying to solve security problems in the trains, problems that are especially evident at night. Security is handled by SOK (Służba Ochrony Kolei, Rail Protection Office) officers and private security companies. Police and City Guard patrols are also more common than they once were. Another essential problem for SKM management are people defacing Electrical Multiple Units (EMUs) with graffiti.

25|$|From the {{application}} protocol point of view, TLS {{belongs to a}} lower layer, although the TCP/IP model is too coarse to show it. This means that the TLS handshake is usually (except in the STARTTLS case) performed before {{the application}} protocol can start. In the name-based virtual server feature being provided by the application layer, all co-hosted virtual servers share the same certificate because the server has to select and send a certificate immediately after the ClientHello message. This is <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>problem</b> in hosting environments because it means either sharing the same certificate among all customers or using a different IP address for each of them.|$|E
25|$|Most Yemenis are {{employed}} in agriculture. Sorghum {{is the most common}} crop. Cotton and many fruit trees are also grown, with mangoes being the most valuable. <b>A</b> <b>big</b> <b>problem</b> in Yemen is the cultivation of Khat, a psychoactive plant that releases a stimulant when chewed, and accounts for up to 40 percent of the water drawn from the Sana'a Basin each year, and that figure is rising. Some agricultural practices are drying the Sana'a Basin and displaced vital crops, which has resulted in increasing food prices. Rising food prices, in turn, pushed an additional six percent of the country into poverty in 2008 alone. Efforts are being made by the Government and Dawoodi Bohra community at North Yemen to replace qat with coffee plantations.|$|E

25|$|Some Portuguese {{employers}} and families {{are of the}} opinion that the existence of private education institutions, where accessibility is based primarily on ability to pay, is not as fair as the public system and could gloom the meritocracy concept, leading to easier entrance criteria and lower teaching standards. Some private institutions are known for making it easy for students to enter and also to get higher grades - as long as they pay. Others claim that the private systems could prevent a significant portion of Portugal's population from being able to attend these schools that is also unfair. The quotas imposed on public education institutions to create room for students from former Portuguese colonies, who get automatically a place in those institutions also creates <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>problem</b> in terms of fairness, as some of these students can enter with very low grades excluding a portion of the Portuguese born students from studying in the public institutions and first choice courses they want.|$|E

500|$|The {{prisoners of}} war also posed <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>problem</b> for Vichy's policy of moral {{rejuvenation}} summarised in its motto Travail, famille, patrie (Work, family, homeland). From October 1940, Vichy attempted to limit women's access to work which had particular effects on prisoners' families. Because of the emphasis on family values under Vichy, the government was especially worried about infidelity among the wives of prisoners in Germany. In December 1942, a law was issued making cohabitation with wives of {{prisoners of war}} illegal. The government also made divorce much harder and officially made adultery an insufficient reason for legal separation {{in order to stop}} suspicious POWs divorcing their wives in France. Wives of prisoners who had had affairs were also often demonised by their local communities who considered it equivalent to prostitution.|$|E

Yet while that's a bit valid, it's also an exciting and surprising finale, that actually offers some bigger shocks than season 1." [...] Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave a mostly positive review, praising the reveal of Beaver as the murderer while being slightly critical of his reveal as Veronica's rapist. He wrote that [...] "as twists go, this was a good one" [...] and that [...] "Kyle Gallner makes the transition from goofy, kind of pathetic little brother to insane mastermind quite well—the circles under his eyes, specifically, which seemed to indicate anxiety before suddenly indicated darkness and insanity when seen in a new light." [...] Regarding the rape reveal, the reviewers wrote that [...] "On a narrative level, I was fine with it...it's still <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>problem</b> in an emotional sense. In general, rape is a difficult subject, and to see it used as a plot device creates problems on its own." [...] Kaiser summed up his review by writing, [...] "'Not Pictured' acts as an effective capstone for a chaotic season.

500|$|According to Leach, {{the volume}} of work was small. <b>A</b> <b>big</b> <b>problem</b> was that the team had too many ideas, and {{insufficient}} time to implement them all. For example, other diseases were planned; one of these was Animal Magnetism, which would see patients with attached animals which {{would have to be}} cut away. Another idea that was not implemented was the possibility of four separate in-game eras: futuristic, mediaeval, Victorian, and modern. The game was originally to have players begin in the mediaeval zone, and progress to more modern ones. By May 1996, the idea of the other time periods had been deemed [...] "prohibitive" [...] due to the amount of graphics required. Carr later stated that the game did not need the other eras, and that the team was small enough to make things up as they went along. Carr was also afraid that if they had produced a design document, Electronic Arts would have considered the omission of the other eras feature cutting. An idea that Molyneux pushed Webley's team to implement was a screen that enabled players to mix coloured chemicals to apply them to diseases. Accessibility was also a concern for the team: with so many options, it was felt that players could treat the game like work. The tester Jon Rennie simplified the game from the original design; Webley was keen for players to be able to begin play without a long tutorial.|$|E
