5|$|Iceland's {{financial}} position has steadily improved since the crash. The economic contraction <b>and</b> <b>rise</b> in unemployment {{appear to have}} been arrested by late 2010 and with growth under way in mid-2011. Three main factors have been important in this regard. First is the emergency legislation passed by the Icelandic parliament in October 2008. It served to minimise the impact of the financial crisis on the country. The Financial Supervisory Authority of Iceland used permission granted by the emergency legislation to take over the domestic operations of the three largest banks. The much larger foreign operations of the banks, however, went into receivership.|$|E

5|$|Renaissance art marks a {{cultural}} rebirth {{at the close}} of the Middle Ages <b>and</b> <b>rise</b> of the Modern world. One of the distinguishing features of Renaissance art was its development of highly realistic linear perspective. Giotto di Bondone (1267–1337) is credited with first treating a painting as a window into space, but it was not until the demonstrations of architect Filippo Brunelleschi (1377–1446) and the subsequent writings of Leon Battista Alberti (1404–1472) that perspective was formalized as an artistic technique.|$|E

5|$|The steep conical cinder cones of Edziza {{were formed}} by lava {{fountain}} eruptions, emitting particles and blobs of congealed lava {{from a single}} vent.

5|$|Although {{the show}} faced {{criticism}} from viewers for not intervening when a meerkat was injured and faced death, as a whole, Meerkat Manor enjoyed considerable success and was Animal Planet's top series in October 2007, {{both on the}} cable channel and through its video-on-demand service. The show's experimental format broke new ground in animal documentary filming techniques and allowed viewers a long term, intimate look {{into the lives of}} its meerkat stars, breaking the traditional wall between viewer and subject found with most documentaries. In 2007, Meerkat Manor was nominated for two Primetime Emmy Awards. It has won three awards at the 2006 Omni Awards, and at the 2006 and 2007 New York Festivals Award Galas. The first three series of the programme have been released to DVD in both Region 1 and Region 2. In 2007, a book entitled Meerkat Manor – The Story of Flower of the Kalahari was released in the UK, detailing the life of Flower and the Whiskers before the series' filming began. A television film, , documenting Flower's birth <b>and</b> <b>rise</b> to matriarch of the Whiskers aired on Animal Planet on 25 May 2008.|$|E
5|$|Horses {{were well}} suited to the warfare tactics of the nomadic {{cultures}} from the steppes of Central Asia. Several East Asian cultures made extensive use of cavalry and chariots. Muslim warriors relied upon light cavalry in their campaigns throughout North Africa, Asia, and Europe beginning in the 7th and 8th centuries AD. Europeans used several types of war horses in the Middle Ages, and the best-known heavy cavalry warrior of the period was the armoured knight. With {{the decline of the}} knight <b>and</b> <b>rise</b> of gunpowder in warfare, light cavalry again rose to prominence, used in both European warfare and in the conquest of the Americas. Battle cavalry developed to take on a multitude of roles in the late 18th century and early 19th century and was often crucial for victory in the Napoleonic wars. In the Americas, the use of horses and development of mounted warfare tactics were learned by several tribes of indigenous people and in turn, highly mobile horse regiments were critical in the American Civil War.|$|E

5|$|In {{a series}} of campaigns he {{recovered}} the provinces of Jazira, Thughur and Jibal, and effected a rapprochement with the Saffarids {{in the east and}} the Tulunids in the west that secured their—albeit largely nominal—recognition of caliphal suzerainty. These successes came at the cost of gearing the economy almost exclusively towards maintenance of the army, which resulted in the expansion <b>and</b> <b>rise</b> to power of the central fiscal bureaucracy and contributed to the Caliph's lasting reputation for avarice. Al-Mu'tadid was also renowned for his cruelty when punishing criminals, and subsequent chroniclers record his extensive and ingenious use of torture. His reign also saw the permanent move of the capital back to Baghdad, where he engaged in major building activities. A firm supporter of Sunni traditionalist orthodoxy, he nevertheless maintained good relations with the Alids, and was interested in natural sciences, renewing caliphal sponsorship of scholars and scientists.|$|E
5|$|The KONUS-B instrument, {{designed}} by the Ioffe Physico-Technical Institute in St. Petersburg, consisted of seven detectors distributed around the spacecraft that responded to photons of 10keV to 8MeV energy. They consisted of NaI(Tl) scintillator crystals 200mm in diameter by 50mm thick behind a Be entrance window. The side surfaces were protected by a 5mm thick lead layer. The burst detection threshold was 500 to 50 microjoules per square meter (510 to 510 erg/cm²), depending on the burst spectrum <b>and</b> <b>rise</b> time. Spectra were taken in two 31-channel pulse height analyzers (PHAs), of which the first eight were measured with 1/16s time resolution and the remaining with variable time resolutions depending on the count rate. The range of resolutions covered 0.25 to 8s.|$|E
5|$|The Mana series, {{known in}} Japan as , is a {{role-playing}} video game series from Square Enix, created by Koichi Ishii. The series {{began as a}} handheld side story to Square's flagship franchise Final Fantasy, although most Final Fantasy-inspired elements were subsequently dropped, starting with the second installment, Secret of Mana. It has since grown to include games of various genres within the fictional world of Mana. The music of the Mana series includes soundtracks and arranged albums of music from the series, which is currently composed of Final Fantasy Adventure and its remake Sword of Mana, Secret of Mana, Seiken Densetsu 3, Legend of Mana, Dawn of Mana, Children of Mana, Friends of Mana, Heroes of Mana, Circle of Mana, <b>and</b> <b>Rise</b> of Mana. Each game except for Friends and Circle has produced a soundtrack album, while Adventure has sparked an arranged album {{as well as a}} combined soundtrack and arranged album, Legend of Mana has an additional promotional EP, and music from Secret and Seiken Densetsu 3 were combined together into an arranged album. For the series' 20th anniversary, a 20-disc box set of previously-released albums was produced, as well as an album of arrangements by Kenji Ito, composer for several games in the series.|$|E
