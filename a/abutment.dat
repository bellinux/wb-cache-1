5|$|After an implant is placed, the {{internal}} components {{are covered with}} either a healing <b>abutment,</b> or a cover screw. A healing <b>abutment</b> passes through the mucosa, and the surrounding mucosa is adapted around it. A cover screw is {{flush with the surface}} of the dental implant, and is designed to be completely covered by mucosa. After an integration period, a second surgery is required to reflect the mucosa and place a healing <b>abutment.</b>|$|E
5|$|Regardless of the <b>abutment</b> {{material}} or technique, {{an impression of}} the <b>abutment</b> is then taken and a crown secured to the <b>abutment</b> with dental cement. Another variation on abutment/crown model is when the crown and <b>abutment</b> are one piece and the lag-screw traverses both to secure the one-piece structure to the internal thread on the implant. There {{does not appear to}} be any benefit, in terms of success, for cement versus screw-retained prosthetics, although the latter is believed to be easier to maintain (and change when the prosthetic fractures) and the former offers high esthetic performance.|$|E
5|$|The {{platform}} {{between the}} implant and the <b>abutment</b> can be flat (buttress) or conical fit. In conical fit abutments, {{the collar of}} the <b>abutment</b> sits inside the implant which allows a stronger junction between implant and <b>abutment</b> and a better seal against bacteria into the implant body. To improve the gingival seal around the <b>abutment</b> collar, a narrowed collar on the <b>abutment</b> is used, referred to as platform switching. The combination of conical fits and platform switching gives marginally better long term periodontal conditions compared to flat-top abutments.|$|E
5000|$|... 1897 <b>abutments</b> and piers These <b>abutments</b> {{form part}} of the <b>abutments</b> of the 1915 bridge. They are massive but {{narrower}} than the 1865 <b>abutments.</b> Like the 1865 <b>abutments</b> they are set into the riverbank. The 1897 <b>abutments</b> are made of rusticated sandstone blocks darker in hue than the blocks of the earlier <b>abutments.</b> A masonry cornice runs {{around the top of}} the wall.|$|R
30|$|Zirconium <b>abutments</b> {{have a high}} {{survival}} rate regardless of implant location and prosthesis type within the 5 -year follow-up period. Zirconium <b>abutments</b> are biologically stable. The evidence regarding the esthetic stability of zirconium <b>abutments</b> is not sufficient. Zirconium <b>abutments</b> are mechanically stable within the 5 -year follow-up period. The long-term stability of zirconium <b>abutments</b> after 5  years cannot be determined. Therefore, clinical studies that investigate the long-term stability of zirconium <b>abutments</b> are required.|$|R
30|$|All {{examined}} studies verified {{the mechanical}} stability of zirconium <b>abutments</b> {{for a period}} no longer than 5  years. Therefore, a long-term clinical observation is needed. Zirconium <b>abutments</b> {{are thought to be}} biologically stable, but they are not superior to titanium <b>abutments.</b> As the esthetic stability of such <b>abutments</b> had a low evidence level in the studies that examined here, a much higher evidence level is needed.|$|R
5|$|Small {{diameter}} implants are implants of low diameter {{with one}} piece construction (implant and <b>abutment)</b> that are sometimes used for denture retention or orthodontic anchorage.|$|E
5|$|The final {{prosthetic}} can {{be either}} fixed, where a person cannot remove the denture or teeth from their mouth, or removable, where they can remove the prosthetic. In each case an <b>abutment</b> {{is attached to the}} implant fixture. Where the prosthetic is fixed, the crown, bridge or denture is fixed to the <b>abutment</b> either with lag screws or with dental cement. Where the prosthetic is removable, a corresponding adapter is placed in the prosthetic so that the two pieces can be secured together.|$|E
5|$|In {{compound}} implants (two stage implants), {{between the}} actual implant and the superstructure (<b>abutment)</b> are gaps and cavities into which bacteria can penetrate from the oral cavity. Later these bacteria will return into the adjacent tissue {{and can cause}} periimplantitis. As prophylaxis these implant interior spaces should be sealed.|$|E
40|$|The M- 100 {{bridge over}} the CN/GTW {{railroad}} in Potterville, Michigan was replaced. Temporary steel <b>abutments</b> and a temporary road were constructed adjacent to the existing structure, and the new superstructure was constructed on the temporary <b>abutments.</b> In this session we will discuss how the new superstructure was slid from the temporary <b>abutments</b> onto the permanent <b>abutments</b> utilizing high-capacity steel rollers and horizontal jacks...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Implant-supported {{prostheses}} have {{to overcome}} a major difficulty presented by the morphology and esthetics of peri-implant tissues in the anterior sector. Diverse therapeutic techniques are used for managing the mucosa adjacent to the implant and the most noteworthy is immediate/deferred fixed provisionalization. Objectives: In vitro testing of strength and deformation of implant prosthetic <b>abutments</b> made from different materials (Titanium/PEEK/methacrylate). Material and Methods: Forty Sweden&Martina ® implant prosthetic <b>abutments</b> (n= 40) were divided into five groups: Group MP: methacrylate provisional <b>abutments</b> with machined titanium base; Group PP: Polyether ether ketone (PEEK) provisional abutments; Group TP: titanium provisional abutments; Group TAD: titanium anti- rotational definitive abutments; Group TRD: titanium rotational definitive <b>abutments.</b> Their mechanical behavior under static loading was analyzed. Samples were examined under a microscope to determine the type of fracture produced. Results and Conclusions: Definitive anti-rotational titanium <b>abutments</b> and definitive rotational titanium <b>abutments</b> achieved the best mean compression strength, while PEEK resin provisional <b>abutments</b> obtained the lowest. The group that showed the greatest elastic deformation was the group of titanium provisional <b>abutments...</b>|$|R
40|$|Aim: The {{purpose of}} this in vitro study was to assess and compare the {{retention}} of zirconia copings luted with different luting agents onto zirconia and titanium <b>abutments.</b> Materials and Methods: Titanium and zirconia <b>abutments</b> were torqued at 35 N/cm onto implant analogs. The samples {{were divided into two}} groups: Group A consisted of four titanium <b>abutments</b> and 32 zirconia copings and Group B consisted of four zirconia <b>abutments</b> and 32 zirconia copings and four luting agents were used. The cemented copings were subjected to tensile dislodgement forces and subjected to ANOVA test. Results: Zirconia <b>abutments</b> recorded a higher mean force compared to titanium. Among the luting agents, resin cement recorded the highest mean force followed by zinc phosphate, glass ionomer, and noneugenol zinc oxide cement, respectively. Conclusion: Highest mean retention was recorded for zirconia implant <b>abutments</b> compared to titanium <b>abutments</b> when luted with zirconia copings...|$|R
5|$|Quickly, the Austrians {{acquired}} {{control of}} all the earthworks of the town, the village itself, and the fortress; their skirmishers reached {{one side of the}} <b>abutment</b> of an old bridge of palisades, and advanced to the other side, across the islands formed by branches of the Kinzig and the Rhine. There, almost within eye-shot of the French sentinels, they halted; there is some confusion about why they stopped. Possibly they mistook the <b>abutment</b> for the bridge itself, as Moreau seemed to think. Regardless, the troops there did not burn the bridge, but started plundering and drinking. The French cavalry tried to retire into Kehl via the Kinzig bridge, but the heavy Austrians fire destroyed most of them.|$|E
5|$|During {{the end of}} 2008, Lake Banook had its canoe course {{upgraded}} by Dexter Construction Limited. Water {{that had}} been pumped out of lake ceased on 15 December 2008, allowing the lake to rise back to its regular level by February 2009. Cleanup, restoration and landscaping was completed {{in the spring of}} 2009. By May 2009, this construction included new concrete abutments at the , , , and finish points, debris and <b>abutment</b> cleanup, ten new lane wires, four new cross wires, and 800 new buoys. Starting gates were tested during the second national team trials held at the lake on 27–28 June 2009. Temporary grandstands for 20,000 spectators per day were also constructed.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{construction}} in 1874, the Whipple truss {{bridge over the}} South Branch Potomac River served Romney and travelers along the Northwestern Turnpike for 63 years. In 1935, the West Virginia State Road Commission began organizing a project to replace the Whipple truss bridge, and construction of the new bridge had begun by 1936. In November of that year, a car collided with {{the south side of}} the eastern Whipple truss span, which knocked the span completely off its eastern <b>abutment.</b> The car plunged into the South Branch Potomac River, followed by the compromised truss span, which collapsed on top of the car. Unaware of the span's collapse, a car traveling from the west drove off the end of the west span at the bridge's center pier, and fell onto the collapsed span. According to the Hampshire Review, the only serious injury sustained was a broken wooden leg. Following the collapse of the eastern Whipple truss span, a temporary wooden span was hastily constructed between the western truss span and the eastern <b>abutment,</b> so that traffic was uninterrupted until the new bridge was completed and opened on June 21, 1937. The 1937 bridge was used until 2010 when it was replaced by the current South Branch Bridge.|$|E
40|$|Background: This study {{evaluated}} {{the feasibility of}} fabricating implant <b>abutments</b> and crowns from pre-sintered feldspathic porcelain blocks using the chair-side CAD/CAM, CEREC 3 D system. Methods: Thirty-two implant analogues {{were divided into two}} groups. In the control group, prefabricated machined anatomical titanium (Ti) <b>abutments</b> were screw-retained to the analogues. In the test group, machined feldspathic porcelain <b>abutments</b> were cemented on prefabricated machined Ti links and screw-retained to the implant analogues. These feldspathic porcelain <b>abutments</b> were fabricated out of pre-sintered feldspathic porcelain blocks as duplicates of the <b>abutments</b> in the control group using the CAD/CAM, CEREC 3 D system. Thirty-two feldspathic porcelain crowns, also fabricated out of pre-sintered ceramic blocks, were then cemented with resin cement on all the <b>abutments</b> in both groups. All samples were subsequently subjected to fracture strength testing under static load. An unpaired t-test was used to compare fracture load values between the two groups. Results: The test group using feldspathic porcelain <b>abutments</b> and crowns showed statistically significant higher mean fracture strength than the control group with the Ti <b>abutments</b> and feldspathic porcelain crowns. Conclusions: This preliminary study showed that the chair-side CAD/CAM technology can be utilized to fabricate customized ceramic <b>abutments</b> with their associated ceramic crowns using pre-sintered feldspathic porcelain blocks.

5|$|The {{bridge of}} 1685 {{featured}} {{prominently in the}} Williamite War in Ireland of the 17th century and was used by Patrick Sarsfield to retreat to Connacht after his ambush of a Williamite convoy at Ballyneety in Co. Limerick during the Siege of Limerick. Because of its affording Sarsfield and his army a method of advance and retreat, the old bridge was {{often referred to as}} Sarsfield's Bridge. This bridge was blown up in 1843 by gunpowder by a section of the Corps of Royal Engineers. The <b>abutment</b> of this bridge can still be seen adjacent to Cromwell's Castle on the Connacht side of the river.|$|E
5|$|A bushfire burnt {{through the}} area in December 1993, {{destroying}} the former railway's bridge over Clackline Brook. Clackline Bridge survived, weakened but in a reasonable condition. The damage included internal expansion joints that had failed, split bedlogs, and other deteriorated timbers. Steel props were installed to support the bridge, and the substructure was repaired in 1995, which mainly involved replacing connecting bolts. A concrete approach slab was installed adjacent to the western <b>abutment</b> in 1998, and in 2013 the concrete deck near pier13 was repaired. Clackline Bridge was the crossing point for Great Eastern Highway until the highway's bypass of Clackline opened in February 2008. The bridge remains open to traffic, {{as part of the}} local road network. In July 2012 it once more carried highway traffic, excluding heavy vehicles, when an accident temporarily closed Great Eastern Highway at Spencers Brook Road.|$|E
5|$|During the 1550s, Henry II became {{concerned}} about the threat of an English or Holy Roman Empire attack on Paris, and strengthened the defences of the Bastille in response. The southern gateway into the Bastille became the principal entrance to the castle in 1553, the other three gateways being closed. A bastion, a large earthwork projecting eastwards from the Bastille, was built to provide additional protective fire for the Bastille and the Arsenal; the bastion was reached from the fortress across a stone <b>abutment</b> using a connecting drawbridge that was installed in the Bastille's Comté tower. In 1573 the Porte Saint-Antoine was also altered – the drawbridges were replaced with a fixed bridge, and the medieval gatehouse was replaced with a triumphal arch.|$|E
50|$|The Bremer River Rail Bridge and old bridge <b>abutments</b> {{are made}} up of a railway bridge that is still in use and the {{sandstone}} <b>abutments</b> of two bridges, now removed, that were located immediately to the east of it. On {{the south side of the}} river, the bridge and <b>abutments</b> are set in riverside parklands in the business centre of Ipswich. The north side of the bridge and the adjacent north bank <b>abutments</b> are situated in a commercial development.|$|R
50|$|The Dodd Ford Bridge was rehabilitated, and reopened {{to traffic}} the summer 2016. Since the {{original}} <b>abutments</b> were in poor condition, the truss, or metal, {{portion of the}} bridge was lifted off the original <b>abutments</b> and placed on temporary supports while the contractor rebuilt new <b>abutments.</b> New I-beams {{were placed on the}} new <b>abutments</b> and the historic truss was placed on top. The new supports will help the over 100 year old bridge carry modern traffic loads, while maintaining its historic character.|$|R
50|$|Longfellow Bridge is a {{combination}} railway and highway bridge. It is 105 ft wide, 1767 ft long between <b>abutments,</b> and nearly one-half mile in length, including <b>abutments</b> and approaches. It consists of eleven steel arch spans supported on ten masonry piers and two massive <b>abutments.</b> The arches vary in length from 101 ft at the <b>abutments</b> to 188 ft at the center, and in rise from 8 ft to 26 ft. Headroom under the central arch is 26 ft at mean high water.|$|R
5|$|The {{prosthetic}} phase begins {{once the}} implant is well integrated (or has a reasonable assurance {{that it will}} integrate) and an <b>abutment</b> is in place to bring it through the mucosa. Even {{in the event of}} early loading (less than 3 months), many practitioners will place temporary teeth until osseointegration is confirmed. The prosthetic phase of restoring an implant requires an equal amount of technical expertise as the surgical because of the biomechanical considerations, especially when multiple teeth are to be restored. The dentist will work to restore the vertical dimension of occlusion, the esthetics of the smile, and the structural integrity of the teeth to evenly distribute the forces of the implants.|$|E
5|$|The two {{aftershocks}} {{the following}} morning were separated by less than four hours and both caused {{at least as much}} damage as the mainshock. A large fire was triggered following the first aftershock at a shopping center in Scotia that destroyed four businesses, with the resulting damage at that site alone estimated at $15 million, and was the largest individual financial misfortune of the sequence of earthquakes. The water supply in Rio Dell was terminated when the water main was severed at the <b>abutment</b> to the Eel River bridge and power outages were widespread throughout Humboldt County. Some were mere seconds while others lasted for hours, but the hydroelectric plant's performance at Ruth Reservoir was deemed acceptable, and power that was not generated locally was unaffected.|$|E
5|$|At de Launay's request, an {{additional}} force of 32 {{soldiers from the}} Swiss Salis-Samade regiment {{had been assigned to}} the Bastille on 7 July, adding to the existing 82 invalides pensioners who formed the regular garrison. De Launay had taken various precautions, raising the drawbridge in the Comté tower and destroying the stone <b>abutment</b> that linked the Bastille to its bastion to prevent anyone from gaining access from that side of the fortress. The shops in the entranceway to the Bastille had been closed and the gates locked. The Bastille was defended by 30 small artillery pieces, but nonetheless, by 14 July de Launay was very concerned about the Bastille's situation. The Bastille, already hugely unpopular with the revolutionary crowds, was now the only remaining royalist stronghold in central Paris, in addition to which he was protecting a recently arrived stock of 250 barrels of valuable gunpowder. To make matters worse, the Bastille had only two days' supply of food and no source of water, making it impossible to withstand a long siege.|$|E

50|$|J.J. Daniels {{had placed}} two bids for the {{construction}} of the bridge. The first was for $1,485 for just the superstructure and the second was $2,520 for the superstructure and the <b>abutments.</b> Meanwhile, Thomas Alward had placed a bid for $945 for the <b>abutments.</b> With Daniels bid of $1,485 and Alward's for $945 totaling $2,430 the contract was split between the two contractors. This was a common practice to award the bridge and <b>abutments</b> separately and even when awarded to one bidder the <b>abutments</b> sometimes were subcontracted anyway.|$|R

5|$|One {{shrimp boat}} was {{initially}} reported missing and the tug Myra White transmitted a distress signal as its engines failed near an oil rig off of Galveston. High winds shattered glass windows at Port Arthur, Texas City, and Galveston, while schools {{were shut down}} in Galveston, Lamarque, Texas City, Alvin, and most of Galveston and Jefferson counties. Despite a brief power outage at Lamarque, electricity was quickly restored after the storm. Powerful gusts downed branches, electrical poles, and tore off shingles in Port Arthur and Galveston, but damage was minimal at High Island, where Cindy made landfall. The U.S. Coast Guard responded to four requests for assistance at Galveston, and nine vessels attempted to seek refuge at Port Arthur; the Coast Guard eventually permitted six to enter, {{and the other three}} apparently traveled to Galveston. Meanwhile, to the northwest, the port of Houston was closed {{for the duration of the}} storm. Trucks and boats were dispatched by civil defense officials in Jefferson County after declaring a state of emergency following numerous requests for assistance by residents of flooded homes.
