Hypsodonty is usually linked to diet abrasiveness, either from siliceous phytoliths (monocotyledons) or from grit (dusty environments). However, any empirical quantitative approach testing the relation of ingested silica and hypsodonty is lacking. In this study, faecal silica content was quantified as <b>acid</b> detergent <b>insoluble</b> <b>ash</b> and used as proxy for silica ingested by large African herbivores of different digestive types, feeding strategies and hypsodonty levels. Separate sample sets were used for the dry (n = 15 species) and wet (n = 13 species) season. Average faecal silica contents were 17 – 46 g kg- 1 dry matter (DM) for browsing and 52 – 163 g kg- 1 DM for grazing herbivores. No difference was detected between the wet (97. 5 + 14. 4 g kg- 1 DM) and dry season (93. 5 + 13. 7 g kg- 1 DM) faecal silica. In a phylogenetically controlled analysis, a strong positive correlation (dry season r = 0. 80, p < 0. 0005; wet season r = 0. 74, p < 0. 005) was found between hypsodonty index and faecal silica levels.

40|$|Duku (Lansium domesticum Corr var duku) is a {{seasonal}} native plant from South Sumatra and Jambi. Peel of Duku is useful as botanical insecticide.  in South Sumatra and Jambi. The research {{proves that the}} skin duku can be useful as an insecticide plant. Quality of compounds in plants can {{be affected by the}} origin area of ​​plant, body parts of plants, and extract characters. This study aims to characterize the simplicia and duku peel extract from South Sumatra and Jambi Province. The sample were collected from Simpang Agung Village, OKU Selatan District and Rengas Bandung Village, Muaro Jambi District. The peel was extracted using acetone, while the charactherization based on standardization method from Badan POM Indonesia. Non-Specific parameters which measured were water content, water soluble ash and <b>acid</b> <b>insoluble</b> <b>ash.</b> Specific  parameters which measured were water soluble extract, ethanol soluble extract, chromatogram, and chemical compound. Simplicia from Simpang Agung Village contain lower water content, water soluble ash, and <b>acid</b> <b>insoluble</b> <b>ash</b> than simplicia from Rengas Bandung Village. Chromatogram pattern of the peel extract from both village were similar and contain terpenoid and fenolic compound.   However hexane yield extract from Simpang Agung Village higher than extract from Rengas Bandung Village therefore contain more insecticides material (terpenoid) </em...|$|E

40|$|Bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon (L) Pers.), {{one of the}} {{predominant}} forages in the southeastern US, varies in nutritive value in response to management and environmental factors. Beef cattle supplementation decisions are complicated by this variability. Therefore, our objective {{was to determine the}} effect of four protein supplementation levels (0, 82, 119 and 155 mg N/kg BW) on the utilization of three bermudagrass hays (5. 6, 6. 3, and 8. 1 percent CP). Thirteen ruminally fistulated Angus x Hereford steers (BW = 330 plus/minus 19 kg) were used in a 13 x 4 incomplete Latin square design with 13 treatments. Treatments were arranged as a 3 x 4 factorial plus a control bermudagrass hay (10. 8 percent CP). Hay was provided ad libitum and protein supplements were offered as range cubes once daily. Periods were 15 d with intake determinations made on d 10 through d 13 to correspond with fecal grab samples collected from d 11 through d 14. <b>Acid</b> detergent <b>insoluble</b> <b>ash</b> was used as an internal marker for determination of fecal output. Hay OM intake of unsupplemented steers increased linearly (P < 0. 01) as hay nutritive value increased from 75 to 77, 96 and 94 g/kg BW^ 0. 75 for 5. 6, 6. 3, 8. 1 and 10. 8 percent CP hays, respectively. A cubic increase (P = 0. 03) in OM digestibility for unsupplemented hays was observed with values ranging from 46 to 65 percent. This resulted in a linear increase (P < 0. 01) in total digestible OM intake in response to hay nutritive value from 35 to 45, 51, and 60 g/kg BW^ 0. 75 for 5. 6, 6. 3, 8. 1, and 10. 8 percent CP hays, respectively. No significant effects on total digestible OM intake were observed when hays were supplemented with protein. There was a tendency for forage OM intake of the 6. 3 percent CP hay to increase linearly with supplemental protein (P = 0. 08). Total OM intake increased linearly (P < 0. 01) when CP was supplemented to the 6. 3 percent CP hay from 77 to 88, 92, and 98 g/kg BW^ 0. 75 for 0, 82, 119, and 155 mg N/kg BW, respectively. We conclude that forage CP content was the primary driver in determining total digestible OM intake, and the effects of protein supplementation on utilization of bermudagrass hay were varied...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the use of dried yeast in the diet of foals when replacing soybean meal to provide 0, 0. 25, 0. 50, 0. 75 and 1. 00 of the main protein source. Two trials were performed. Trial one was done to evaluate the influence of yeast on the digestibility of the five diets. Ten foals were kept in metabolic cages and five diets were tested twice. The experiment was repeated a second time, with foals receiving a different diet so that every diet was tested 4 times on a different animal. The concentrate was offered in a level of 2 % of the body weight and Chloris guaiana hay was offered as roughage in a level of 1 % of the body weight. In a second trial thirty ‘Brasileiro de Hipismo’ foals, aged between 12 and 14 months, were used. They were kept on pastures of Cynodon dactylon c. v. Coastcross and Cynodon spp. c. v. Tifton 85, and the concentrate was offered twice a day in separate pens at a level of 2 % of the body weight. The pastures were of good quality and the pasture availability was high. The experimental design was a 5 × 3 factorial (five levels of yeast and three groups of animals in different pastures), with two replicates/treatment. The foals were weighed and measured every 28 days. Blood samples were collected at the end of the trial. The concentrate intake was measured daily. The pasture intake was measured through estimation of faecal output with chromic oxide and by the amount of <b>acid</b> detergent <b>insoluble</b> <b>ash</b> in the pasture, feed and faecal samples. The mean digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, crude energy and acid detergent fibre did not differ between the diets. A quadratic effect was observed for the digestibility of crude protein and neutral detergent fibre. Increasing the level of yeast in the diets did not have an influence on the average daily weight gain, heart girth gain, withers height gain, but linearly depressed the daily intake of the concentrate. However, the intake of pasture was not influenced by the different diets. The biochemical blood parameters total protein, albumin, globulin, urea, uric acid, creatinine, cholesterol, triglycerides, aspartate aminotransferase and gamma glutamyltransferase were not affected by increasing levels of dried yeast. It was concluded that dried yeast can be used as the only main protein source in the concentrate diets of 12 month old foals...|$|R
