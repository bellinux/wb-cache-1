The minimum ventilation systems were: Blue House I: <b>exhaust</b> <b>fans</b> + curtain management (end of the building); Blue House II: <b>exhaust</b> <b>fans</b> + side curtain management; and Dark House: <b>exhaust</b> <b>fans</b> + flag. The climate variables evaluated were: dry bulb temperature, relative humidity, air velocity, carbon dioxide and ammonia concentration, during winter time, at 9 a. m., in 80 equidistant points in brooding area. Data were evaluated by geostatistic technique. The results indicate that Wider broiler houses (above 15. 0 m width) present the greatest ammonia and humidity concentration.

40|$|A {{flow test}} was {{performed}} in Scrap Recovery of HB-Line to document the flow available for hydrogen dilution in the dissolvers when the charge chute covers are removed. Air flow through the dissolver charge chutes, with the covers off, was measured. A conservative estimate of experimental uncertainty was subtracted from the results. After subtraction, the test showed that there is 20 cubic feet per minute (cfm) air flow through the dissolvers during dissolution with a glovebox <b>exhaust</b> <b>fan</b> operating, even with the scrubber not operating. This test also showed there is 6. 6 cfm air flow through the dissolvers, after subtraction of experimental uncertainty if the scrubber and the glovebox <b>exhaust</b> <b>fans</b> are not operating. Three H-Canyon <b>exhaust</b> <b>fans</b> provide sufficient motive force to give this 6. 6 cfm flow. Material charged to the dissolver {{will be limited to}} chemical hydrogen generation rates that will be {{greater than or equal to}} 25 percent of the Lower Flammability Limit (LFL) during normal operations. The H-Canyon fans will maintain hydrogen below LFL if electrical power is lost.

5000|$|In {{many smaller}} buildings, 'forced' or 'mechanical' {{ventilation}} {{is not used}} to introduce ventilation air. Instead, natural ventilation, via openable windows and other openings, <b>exhaust</b> <b>fans,</b> and infiltration are used to provide ventilation air. Typically, at least one-third air change per hour is considered the minimum. ASHRAE Standard 62.2 was adopted in 2004; it clarifies the ventilation air requirements for low-rise residences. The Standard specifies that forced ventilation is required in houses with infiltration less than 0.35 ACH.

40|$|In {{buildings}} that contain laboratories, fume hoods are normally {{used to control}} contaminant concentrations. Exhaust stacks with a constant exit velocity are required {{to make sure that}} dangerous concentrations do not occur in occupied areas near the building or on the roof top. To achieve constant velocity when exhaust flow rates are less than design, makeup air is introduced to the system at the inlet of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>fan.</b> Since laboratory <b>exhaust</b> airflow is often significantly less than the design airflow, <b>exhaust</b> <b>fans</b> consume significantly more energy than is necessary. To reduce <b>exhaust</b> <b>fan</b> energy, techniques involving multiple exhaust stacks and a variable speed drive (VSD) can be applied to laboratory exhaust systems. The potential fan energy savings depend on optimal selection of the number of stacks, the sizes of the stacks, and the exhaust system ductwork design.
