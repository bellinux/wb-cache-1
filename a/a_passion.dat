40|$|The Dualistic Model of Passion (Vallerand et al., 2003) {{shows that}} people can {{experience}} a harmonious or <b>an</b> obsessive <b>passion</b> toward <b>an</b> activity. Mageau and Vallerand (2007; Mageau et al., 2009) have argued that self-related processes, such as contingencies of self-worth, are central in {{the distinction between the}} two types of passion. Specifically, it was proposed that people with <b>an</b> obsessive <b>passion</b> rely more heavily on their passionate activity to derive self-esteem than people with <b>a</b> harmonious <b>passion</b> such that they should experience self-esteem fluctuations as a function of their performances in their passionate activity. This study tested this hypothesis. Using self-reports, results first showed that the more people have <b>an</b> obsessive <b>passion</b> the more they report experiencing self-esteem fluctuations that covary with their performances in their passionate activity. In contrast, people with <b>a</b> harmonious <b>passion</b> did not report experiencing more, or less, self-esteem fluctuations. Second, hierarchical linear modeling confirmed that, in a real-life setting, the more people report <b>an</b> obsessive <b>passion</b> toward <b>a</b> card game, the greater is the impact of performance on their state self-esteem. Taken together, these findings suggest that obsessive, but not harmonious, passion triggers contingencies between people’s self-esteem and their passionate activity.
