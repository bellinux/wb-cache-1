5|$|Despite German {{interest}} in the battlecruiser project, the two sides could not agree on terms. The German delegation insisted that orders placed in their country be guaranteed, with financial compensation {{to be paid to}} German companies if the Dutch did not construct the ships. They also refused to release a complete set of plans for the Scharnhorsts. Further complicating negotiations, the Dutch Cabinet, which would have to approve <b>any</b> <b>deal,</b> did not convene during the summer of 1939.|$|E
5|$|Earp improbably testified {{during the}} {{preliminary}} hearing after the gunfight at the O.K. Corral that he and Behan had made a deal. If Earp withdrew his application to the legislature, Behan agreed to appoint Earp as undersheriff. Behan received the appointment in February 1881, but did not keep {{his end of the}} bargain, and instead chose Harry Woods, a prominent Democrat, as undersheriff. Behan testified at first that he had not made <b>any</b> <b>deal</b> with Earp, although he later admitted he had lied. Behan said he broke his promise to appoint Earp because of an incident that occurred shortly before his appointment.|$|E

Krulitz was replaced with Eric Jankelassistant for intergovernmental affairs to Interior Secretary Cecil Andruswith whom Tureen had previously negotiated the settlement to the Narragansett land claim in Rhode Island. Tureen and Jankelalong with Donald Perkins, a lawyer for the paper and timber companiesnegotiated a solution whereby $30 million of the settlement funds would come from various programs in the federal budget. That settlement was presented to the Maine congressional delegation in August 1979, but they refusal to endorse it until the Maine legislature had approved it. Governor Langley, in turn, refused to accept <b>any</b> <b>deal</b> that would limit the state's jurisdiction over the tribes.|$|E

5|$|Despite this {{development}} work, {{a move to}} a shared stadium in Straiton was again proposed in 2003. Hibs hoped that selling the Easter Road site {{would allow them to}} clear their debts and reduce costs. Club director Rod Petrie commented that any decision would be based on financial grounds and after consultation with the fanbase, as the club were not being forced to move. Farmer expressed support for further redeveloping Easter Road, if it could be part of a viable business plan. During the consultation, Farmer said that his main priority was ensuring the club's survival and denied that <b>any</b> <b>deal</b> had been concluded. The consultation found that the fans were largely opposed to the Straiton proposal, which the club eventually abandoned. To remove part of the debt, the club sold some land to the east of the stadium that had previously been used for car parking. Selling players, including Steven Whittaker, Scott Brown, Kevin Thomson and Steven Fletcher, also funded these debts and further work.|$|E
5|$|For the negotiations, {{the studio}} {{requested}} that the cast members accept a 45 percent cut of their salaries so that more seasons could be produced after season 23, or else that season would be the series' last. The actors {{were willing to take}} a pay cut, but wanted a percentage of the back-end payments instead. At one point Shearer even offered a 70 percent pay cut in exchange for back-end percentages, but the studio was unwilling to make <b>any</b> <b>deal</b> involving back-end percentages. In the end, the studio and the actors reached a deal, in which the actors would take a pay cut of 30 percent, down to just over $300,000 per episode, prolonging the show to its 25th season. As well as the voice actors, everybody involved in the show took a pay cut. This included animators, writers, the post-production crew and even Jean himself. The further use of digital animation also saves money, as the animation of the show becomes more efficient.|$|E
5|$|Macrinus was {{at first}} {{occupied}} {{by the threat of}} the Parthians, with whom Rome had been at war since the reign of Caracalla. Macrinus settled a peace deal with the Parthians, after fighting an indecisive battle at Nisibis in 217. In return for peace, Macrinus was forced to pay a large indemnity to the Parthian ruler Artabanus V. Rome was at the time also under threat from Dacia and Armenia, so <b>any</b> <b>deal</b> with Parthia would likely have been beneficial to Rome. Next, Macrinus turned his attention to Armenia. In 216, Caracalla had imprisoned Khosrov I of Armenia and his family after Khosrov had agreed to meet with Caracalla at a conference to discuss some issue between himself and his sons. Caracalla instead installed a new Roman governor to rule over Armenia. These actions angered the Armenian peoples and they soon rebelled against Rome. Macrinus settled a peace treaty with them by returning the crown and loot to Khosrov's son and successor Tiridates II and releasing his mother from prison, and by restoring Armenia to its status as a client kingdom of Rome. Macrinus made peace with the Dacians by releasing hostages, though this was likely not handled by himself but by Marcius Agrippa. In matters of foreign policy, Macrinus showed a tendency towards settling disputes through diplomacy and a reluctance to engage in military conflict, though this may have been due to lack of resources and manpower than his own personal preference.|$|E

25|$|On 6 August, the UN {{special envoy}} to Yemen, Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, {{announced}} the suspension in Kuwait, where the talks were being held. He said that the negotiations were not a failure {{and that they would}} resume in a month at an undisclosed location. Mr. Ahmed is the second United Nations envoy to try to broker peace talks between the Houthis and other factions in Yemen since March 2015. His predecessor quit after similar peace talk efforts failed. After the breakdown of the talks, one of the Houthi negotiators, Nasser Bagazgooz, blamed the United Nations envoy for seeking what he said amounted to a military solution on behalf of the Saudi-led coalition. Previous negotiations floated the idea of forming a unity government — composed of Houthi and former Hadi government leaders. But the exiled Hadi leaders have consistently rejected <b>any</b> <b>deal</b> that would diminish their power over Yemen, and the Houthis have said that they will reject <b>any</b> <b>deal</b> that does not give them a seat at the table.|$|E

The union may, in fact, have made a deal of some sort with Buchalter, although no evidence has ever surfaced, despite intensive efforts of political opponents of the union, such as Thomas Dewey and Westbrook Pegler, to find it. Buchalter claimed, before his execution in 1944, {{that he had never}} had <b>any</b> <b>deal</b> with either Hillman or Dubinsky, head of the ILGWU.

25|$|In the 2002 election, the Greens polled 7.00%, {{increasing}} their strength in parliament to nine seats, although {{they lost the}} Coromandel electorate. The electoral campaign featured strong tensions between the Greens and Labour. The Greens sharply criticised Labour for its plans to allow a moratorium on genetic engineering to expire, and believing that Labour would require their support to form a government, intended to make the extension of this moratorium a non-negotiable part of <b>any</b> <b>deal.</b> After the election, however, Labour and their coalition partner, the Jim Anderton-led Progressive Coalition, opted to rely on support from United Future, a party with conservative Christian overtones, shutting the Greens out of power.|$|E
25|$|The union hired Clarence Darrow {{to defend}} the McNamaras.

As it turned out, it was a trap and Darrow was arrested. Now more desperate than ever, he persuaded the McNamaras to plead guilty on the basis of an unwritten plea bargain that would have freed John.

25|$|Voter {{turnout was}} higher than {{expected}} at 58%. The results saw the Centre Party win the most votes, but they were only 0.8% ahead of the new Res Publica party. As a result, both parties won 28 seats, which was a disappointment for the Centre Party who had expected to win the most seats. Altogether the right of centre parties won 60 seats, compared to only 41 for the left wing, and so were expected to form the next government. Both the Centre and Res Publica parties said that they should {{get the chance to}} try and form the next government, while ruling out <b>any</b> <b>deal</b> between themselves. President Rüütel had to decide who he should nominate as Prime Minister and therefore be given the first chance at forming a government.

25|$|In the 1980s, Barclays Bank {{proposed}} a redevelopment of 55-73 Colmore Row. The scheme involved {{the demolition of}} the entire building except for the façades and the banking hall of the listed building. The local planning authority called for greater retention of the building structure as with other schemes in the area. The agents submitted multiple planning applications {{to put pressure on}} the planning department. As the planning department failed to come to a decision on two planning applications in their time periods, the bank took the case to a government department. Barclays and local planning authority failed to reach <b>any</b> <b>deal</b> in negotiations, which eventually broke down. The government saw that the retention of the façade was satisfactory as it allowed the economic reuse of the site. The decision left the development and design framework for the area in a weakened state as the building subject to the decision was deemed to be of less national importance in respect to its local importance. The use of façadism on the building has since been seen as successful following the addition of Mansard roofs providing additional floorspace.|$|E
25|$|Even as the Twins {{were forced}} to {{continue}} playing in 2002, {{the seeds of the}} eventual financing solution were sown when Hennepin County, in which the city of Minneapolis is located, began to express interest in being a financial partner in a ballpark. Unfortunately for the Twins, Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura wanted to foster competition between the various localities, thinking it would spur more creativity in the structure of <b>any</b> <b>deal.</b> Instead, St. Paul legislators, led by new mayor Randy Kelly, and aided by Hennepin County legislators wanting to keep their constituents off the hook, played hardball, and amended the ballpark bill so that only cities -- not counties -- could become financial partners in a ballpark. They knew that this move would eliminate both Hennepin County and Minneapolis (by virtue of the $10 million cap on any contribution), and leave only St. Paul as a viable partner. The bill passed, and Ventura signed it, but the strategy backfired. The Twins investigated and quickly rejected St. Paul as an implausible place to build. Nothing came of the bill, and it effectively ended any serious talk of the team moving to St. Paul.|$|E

25|$|A September 2012 weapons {{technology}} swap {{deal and}} a July 2014 {{agreement on the}} sharing of defence technology were seen as preliminary steps towards Australian-Japanese collaboration on a submarine design, or towards integrating technologies like the Sōryūs Kockums designed air-independent propulsion Stirling engines and research into incorporating the Japanese boats' hydrodynamic capabilities into a potential SEA 1000 design. Advantages in such a deal between the nations include the attention that securing the SEA 1000 project would bring to Japanese arms manufacturers (particularly after loosening of defence export restrictions in 2014), the provision of a proven high-end submarine design to the Australian military, and improved relations, both directly and as mutual allies of the United States of America. However, it has been noted that co-operation on such a major defence project would be high risk due to Japan's lack of previous arms export experience, and <b>any</b> <b>deal</b> could negatively impact on both nations' relations with China. The close personal relationship between the then-Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe had also been cited {{as a factor in}} the likeliness of such a deal, although with the caveat that a change in government in either nation would compromise any potential deal for construction, or the ongoing maintenance support of the submarines: the Australian Labor Party has a greater interest in supporting local shipbuilding than Abbott's Coalition government, while a souring of China-Japan relations is something the Democratic Party of Japan is less likely to risk than the Liberal Democratic government led by Abe.|$|E
