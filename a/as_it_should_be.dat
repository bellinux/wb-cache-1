5|$|Fire {{is another}} {{important}} element in {{the maintenance of the}} Everglades. The majority are caused by lightning strikes from thunderstorms during the wet season. Their effects are largely superficial, and serve to foster further plant growth: sawgrass will burn above water, but the roots are preserved. Fire in the sawgrass marshes serves to keep out larger bushes and trees, and releases nutrients from decaying plant matter more efficiently than decomposition. Large burned areas also affect waterflow, since wind and water are undeterred by the eradicated sawgrass; water may flow two to three times faster in recently burned areas. During the wet season only dead plant matter and the tips of plants are burned; however, the effects of fire are much more significant in the dry season, as fire may be fed by organic peat and burn deeply, destroying root systems. The only impediment to the spread of fire in the Everglades is the presence of water. It takes around 225years for one foot (0.3m) of peat to develop, but the peat is not as dense <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> for the 5,000years of the Everglades' existence. Scientists point to fire as the reason.|$|E
5|$|A rocket-ship {{carrying}} astronaut John Corcoran (Michael Emmet) launches and orbits the Earth, {{marking the}} United States' first manned space launch. Shortly after taking off, {{the ship is}} struck by an unknown object, forcing Corcoran to abort the mission and land. However, the equipment cannot handle the fast descent back into the atmosphere and the ship crash lands in the woods, killing Corcoran. Dave Randall (Ed Nelson) and Donna Bixby (Georgianna Carter), two technicians from a nearby space agency tracking station, locate the crashed ship and recover Corcoran's body. They are baffled, however, by {{what appears to be}} a giant tear in the side of the destroyed spacecraft and a mud-like substance covering some of the wreckage. Randall and Bixby are joined by lead scientist Dr. Alex Wyman (Tyler McVey), technician Steve Dunlap (John Baer) and physician Julie Benson (Angela Greene), who was also Corcoran's fiancee. Wyman observes that Corcoran's body exhibits no signs of rigor mortis, and that the blood pooling beside him is not livid <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be.</b> The team brings the corpse back to their lab to run tests and find further irregularities. Although the body lacks a heartbeat or pulse, it maintains the blood pressure of a living human being. After looking at his blood in a microscope, they find unusual, unidentifiable cells that seem resistant to destruction from human white blood cells.|$|E

They find that the first word of any chosen page is different for each of them, rather than identical <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be.</b> The Doctor further explains that the Dream Crabs could not stop their subconscious minds from fighting back, which manifested {{in the form of}} Santa Claus.

500|$|The Indonesian {{film critic}} Salim Said writes that Ismail {{intended}} to [...] "not consider commercial aspects" [...] {{and send the}} film to the Cannes Film Festival in France. Ultimately Darah dan Doa was both a financial failure, with losses that were not recouped until after Ismail released his next film the following year. The film was not screened at Cannes. In a 1960 retrospective, the company attributed the film's failure to a conflict of what the people wanted and what was provided; the write-up stated that Ismail had not meant to portray the military <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be,</b> but as it was– as well as individuals within it.|$|E

500|$|Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times {{wrote that}} [...] "Mars Attacks! is all 1990s cynicism and disbelief, mocking the {{conventions}} that Independence Day takes seriously. This all sounds clever enough but in truth, Mars Attacks! {{is not as}} much fun <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be.</b> Few of its numerous actors make a lasting impression and Burton's heart and soul {{is not in the}} humor". Desson Thomson from The Washington Post said [...] "Mars Attacks! evokes plenty of sci-fi classics, from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) to Dr. Strangelove (1964), but it doesn't do much beyond that superficial exercise. With the exception of Burton's jolting sight gags (I may never recover from the vision of Sarah Jessica Parker's head grafted on to the body of a chihuahua), the comedy is half-developed, pedestrian material. And the climactic battle between Earthlings and Martians is dull and overextended." ...|$|E

500|$|The cast began rehearsing, {{but after}} 20 minutes {{stopped and turned}} to Cherones, who agreed to talk to Charles. While {{on his way to}} Charles' office, Cherones met Castle Rock {{executive}} Glenn Padnick and informed him about the cast's reaction to the episode. Cherones said that Padnick was relieved to hear this, and they both discussed the problem with Charles, and decided not to use the script. Commenting on the episode, Charles stated [...] "You know, it would have been an interesting show, but [...] we couldn't solve the funny problem of it. It never seemed to quite be as funny <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> and, because of that, the balance was off and the darkness kind of enveloped it, and it could never really emerge from that darkness and become what it should have been.

500|$|In the Fifth Victory Test, under {{overcast}} conditions {{against a}} swinging and seaming ball, Miller struck 14 {{from his first}} over and finished 77 not out, in a display that featured strong cutting and driving. Australia could manage only 173, and England were on top. Miller took one wicket with the ball but managed only four in the second innings as England won, to square the series 2–2. Hassett wrote {{at the end of}} the series that [...] "This is cricket <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be...</b> let's have no more talk of [...] "war" [...] in cricket". Miller topped the batting averages for the series, with 443 runs at 63.28. His aggregate exceeded those of Hammond and Hutton, and he also took 10 wickets at 27.70. Of Miller's batting, Hassett said that [...] "as a strokeplayer he is second to none", and his performance earned comparisons to Jack Gregory, who had a similar breakthrough after World War I.|$|E
500|$|The Victory Tests were {{expected}} to usher in a new post-war era, which it hoped would be more aggressive and attractive. The last Anglo-Australian Test series before the war had featured {{a large number of}} draws due to defensive play.

These games have shown that international cricket can be played as between real friends—so let's have no more talk of [...] "war" [...] in cricket". The series was regarded as an outstanding success, with a total attendance of 367,000 watching the bright and attacking play. In the five Victory Tests, Hassett made 277 runs at 27.70, including two fifties. The Services and Australian Imperial Force teams played separate matches in England during the season, which lasted until September, although only one other Services match was given first-class status. Hassett scored three centuries in matches for the Services.|$|E

500|$|The {{film has}} several {{differences}} from the novel, {{partly due to}} the different requirements of the two media. Diana Wynne Jones' novel has a very large cast of characters, and several plot threads that were too complex to be transferred into the film. As a result, characters such as Sophie's second sister Martha are left out, as is the plot thread involving Markl (who is called Michael in the novel, and depicted as an adolescent, rather than as a young boy) courting her. Jones discussed the film with Studio Ghibli representatives, but did not have any input or involvement in the production of the film. Miyazaki traveled to England in the summer of 2004 to give Jones a private viewing of the finished film. She has been quoted as saying [...] "It's fantastic. No, I have no input—I write books, not films. Yes, it will be different from the book—in fact it's likely to be very different, but that's <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be.</b> It will still be a fantastic film." ...|$|E

500|$|While Vicky {{was close}} with her eldest daughter, this changed {{as the girl}} grew older; {{by the time she}} was two years old, Charlotte had become known as [...] "sweet naughty little Ditta" [...] and would prove to be the most {{difficult}} of the family's eight children. As a young girl, she acted nervously and made frequent displays of agitation, such as pulling at her clothes. An early habit of biting her nails led to preventative measures like the forced wearing of gloves, but any methods only provided temporary relief. Queen Victoria wrote to her daughter, [...] "tell Charlotte I was appalled to hear of her biting her things. Grandmamma does not like naughty little girls". In 1863 the Crown Princess recorded in her diary that Charlotte's [...] "little mind seems almost too active for her body – she is so nervous & sensitive and so quick. Her sleep is not so sound <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> – and she is so very thin". Charlotte developed violent tantrums, to her mother's displeasure; Vicky described them as [...] "such outbreaks of rage & stubbornness that she screams blue murder".
