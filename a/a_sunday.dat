5|$|The {{archaeologist}} Leslie Grinsell {{reported that}} in the mid-1970s, he learned of a folk tale that the stones had once been children who were turned to stones as punishment for playing Five-Stones on <b>a</b> <b>Sunday.</b> This folk motif of humans turned to stone for revelling on <b>a</b> <b>Sunday</b> had been attached {{to a range of}} prehistoric monuments across south-western Britain by the early eighteenth century, although it had been first recorded in Cornwall in 1602.
