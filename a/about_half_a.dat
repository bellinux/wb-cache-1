5|$|<b>About</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> {{billion years}} ago, the newly {{captured}} star began {{to expand into}} a red giant (see stellar evolution).|$|E
5|$|Even {{before it}} becomes a red giant, the {{luminosity}} of the Sun will have nearly doubled, and Earth will receive as much sunlight as Venus receives today. Once the core hydrogen is exhausted in 5.4 billion years, the Sun will expand into a subgiant phase and slowly double in size over <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> billion years. It will then expand more rapidly over <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> billion years until it is over two hundred times larger than today {{and a couple of}} thousand times more luminous. This then starts the red-giant-branch phase where the Sun will spend around a billion years and lose around a third of its mass.|$|E

The road crosses Route 68 at a grade-separated junction about two miles (three km) later, followed {{by a series of}} junctions <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> mile (0.8km) apart each: an interchange with the Wilbur Cross Parkway (at exit 66), a split to the left where Route 71 begins and a merge from the left where Route 150 ends.|$|E
5|$|Bessel roughly {{estimated}} {{the period of}} the companion of Sirius to be <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> century; C. A. F. Peters computed an orbit for it in 1851. It was not until 31 January 1862 that Alvan Graham Clark observed a previously unseen star close to Sirius, later identified as the predicted companion. Walter Adams announced in 1915 that he had found the spectrum of Sirius B to be similar to that of Sirius.|$|E

5|$|During the Great Irish Famine (1845–1852) the Catholic {{population}} of Liverpool increased dramatically. <b>About</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> million Irish, who were predominantly Catholic, fled to England {{to escape the}} famine; many embarked from Liverpool to travel to North America while others remained in the city. Because {{of the increase in}} the Catholic population, the co-adjutor Bishop of Liverpool, Alexander Goss (18141872), saw the need for a cathedral. The location he chose was the grounds of St. Edward's College on St.Domingo Road, Everton.|$|E

Released online on 14 June 2010 onto various game hosting websites, it has garnered sizeable praise and scrutiny since its release, with critics finding the game to be thought-provoking while having poor controls.|$|E
5|$|Old Gisborough Hall was {{demolished}} around 1825 and the Chaloners built {{a mansion}} house, Gisborough Hall, <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> {{mile to the}} east in 1857.

In the northeast the isle shelves to a shore, but otherwise the coast is rugged and much indented; numerous caves have been carved out by rain, streams and sea. There is enough grass to feed a few cattle, and the island has a spring.|$|E
5|$|The agung {{is usually}} {{performed}} while {{standing beside the}} instrument, holding the upper edge of its flange between the thumb and other fingers with the left hand while striking the knob with the right hand. The mallets, called balu, are made from short sticks <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> foot in length and padded with soft but tough material such as rubber at one end.

5|$|Unusually for a {{motorway}} service station, the {{two sites}} are <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> mile apart {{due to the}} proximity of junction 8 (for the M50 motorway). The services opened with the motorway in 1962 and have undergone many developments over time, {{largely due to the}} evolution of the motorway, which {{at the time of its}} opening ran from Birmingham to Strensham but now runs to Exeter some 100 miles southwards. It was the first service station on the M5.|$|E

5|$|A novel {{vaccine for}} dengue fever has been {{approved}} and is commercially available {{in a number of}} countries. Other methods of prevention are by reducing mosquito habitat and limiting exposure to bites. This may be done by getting rid of or covering standing water and wearing clothing that covers much of the body. Treatment of acute dengue is supportive and includes giving fluid either by mouth or intravenously for mild or moderate disease. For more severe cases blood transfusion may be required. <b>About</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> million people require admission to hospital a year. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen should not be used.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} {{into the}} town of East Windsor, the roadway becomes two lanes wide with auxiliary left turn lanes and is known as South Main Street. It intersects with Route 191 (Phelps Street), {{which leads to the}} East Windsor town center. <b>About</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> mile (0.8km) north of this junction, US 5 leaves Main Street to go on Prospect Hill Road, bypassing the Warehouse Point area. There is also a partial interchange with I-91 in this area (at exit 44). Just south of the Enfield town line, US 5 intersects with Route 140, which crosses the Connecticut River {{into the town}} of Windsor Locks and Bradley International Airport.|$|E

5|$|As {{the wine}} {{business}} began to prosper, Schnaufer also gave thought to alternative employment possibilities in peacetime aviation. With his wartime friend Hermann Greiner, he traveled from Weil am Rhein to Bern in Switzerland to meet South American diplomats; the two {{hoped to find}} employment as pilots in South America. To get to Bern, they crossed the Swiss-German border illegally. The meeting was a failure. As they returned to Germany, they were caught by Swiss border guards attempting to make a second illegal border crossing. The Swiss handed {{them over to the}} French occupation authorities and they were imprisoned in Lörrach, where they remained until Schnaufer managed to make contact with a French general, who was a customer of the Schnaufer winery and had them released. This misadventure kept him away from his business for <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> year.|$|E
5|$|Bryennios {{arranged}} {{his army}} in the typical three divisions, each in two lines, as prescribed by the Byzantine military manuals. The right wing, under his brother John, was 5,000 strong and comprised his Frankish mercenaries, Thessalian cavalry, the Hetaireia, and the Maniakatai regiment (descendants of the veterans of George Maniakes's campaign in Sicily and Italy). His left wing, 3,000 men from Thrace and Macedonia, was placed under Katakalon Tarchaneiotes, and the centre, under Bryennios himself, comprised 3,000–4,000 men from Thessaly, Thrace and Macedonia. Again, according to standard doctrine, on his far left, <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> kilometer ("two stadia") from the main force, he had stationed an outflanking detachment (hyperkerastai) of Pechenegs.|$|E
5|$|During {{planning}} and construction, and for <b>about</b> <b>half</b> <b>a</b> year after opening, the road had no official name and {{was known as}} the Diagonal Highway, Newark–Jersey City Viaduct, or High-Level Viaduct. On May 3, 1933, the New Jersey Legislature passed a bill sponsored by Assemblyman Eugene W. Hejke of Jersey City naming the road the General Casimir Pulaski Memorial Skyway after Casimir Pulaski, the Polish military leader who helped train and lead Continental Army troops in the American Revolutionary War. An official ceremony was held on October 11, 1933, including the unveiling of signs with an abbreviated designation, Gen. Pulaski Skyway.|$|E
