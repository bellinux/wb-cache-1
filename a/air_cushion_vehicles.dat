They were also known as Aerotrains since one of the builders had a licence from Bertin's Aerotrain company. Three separate projects were funded. Research and development {{was carried out by}} Rohr, Inc., Garrett AiResearch and Grumman. The UMTA built an extensive test site in Pueblo, Colorado, with different types of tracks for the different technologies used by the prototype contractors. They managed to build prototypes and do a few test runs before the funding was cut.|$|E

2500|$|Aérotrain I80 was a {{full-size}} passenger-carrying car for intercity service. It was 25.6m long, 3.2m wide, 3.3m high, had {{a mass of}} 11.25t empty, and had 80 passenger seats. In its original configuration (as I80-250 for 250km/h), it was propelled by twin Turboméca TurmoIIIE3 turboshaft ( [...] each) powering a ducted propeller, 2.3m in diameter, with seven blades of variable pitch. A Turboméca Turmastazou14 turboshaft engine powered the air compressors (six horizontal for the support and six vertical for guidance). Braking was typically provided by reverse thrust of the propeller, and in emergencies by a friction brake on the central rail. External noise was 90-95 dBA at [...] I80-250 was later rebuilt for 350km/h and re-designated as the I-80HV (Haute Vitesse = high speed). The main change was the new propulsion system, a JT8D turbofan from Pratt & Whitney mounted on top.

Two triaxial accelerometers, and a pitch and roll transducer were installed to measure axial, transverse and vertical accelerations and pitch and roll (in degree) of the vehicle. The test results clearly show that the vibration g-amplitude is extremely low (fraction of 1 -g level) for <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> <b>vehicle</b> and <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> <b>vehicle</b> itself is acting as a super-damper to reduce the wave-induced vibration response amplitude.

40|$|An <b>Air</b> <b>cushion</b> <b>vehicle</b> is {{a vehicle}} that flies like a plane but can float like a boat, can drive like a car but will {{traverse}} ditches and gullies {{as it is a}} flat terrain. An <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> <b>vehicle</b> also sometimes called an <b>air</b> <b>cushion</b> <b>vehicle</b> because it can hover over or move across land or water surfaces while being held off from the surfaces by a <b>cushion</b> of <b>air.</b> A Hovercraft can travel over all types of surfaces including grass, mud, muskeg, sand, quicksand, water and ice. Hovercraft prefer gentle terrain although they are capable of climbing slopes up to 20 %, depending upon surface characteristics. Modern Hovercrafts are used for many applications where people and equipment need to travel at speed over water but be able load and unload on land. For example they are used as passenger or freight carriers, as recreational machines and even use as warships.
