Her lady's maid, Maria Perekusikhina, had asked the Empress if she had slept well, and Catherine reportedly replied she had not slept so well in a long time. Sometime after 9:00 that morning, Catherine went to her dressing room and collapsed from a stroke while on the toilet. Worried by Catherine's absence, her attendant, Zakhar Zotov, opened the door <b>and</b> <b>peered</b> in. Catherine was sprawled on the floor. Her face appeared purplish, her pulse was weak, and her breathing was shallow and laboured. The servants lifted Catherine from the floor and brought her to the bedroom. Some 45 minutes later, the royal court's Scottish physician, Dr. John Rogerson, arrived and determined that Catherine had suffered a stroke. Despite all attempts to revive the Empress, she fell into a coma from which she never recovered. Catherine was given the last rites and died the following evening around 9:45. An autopsy performed on her body the next day confirmed the cause of death as stroke. (Later, several unfounded stories circulated regarding the cause and manner of her death.) ...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{the current}} study was to {{investigate}} whether <b>peer</b> rejection <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> victimization mediated the relation between children’s aggressive behaviors and depressive symptoms. Participants were 533 fourth- and fifth-grade children (289 girls and 244 boys). Data on aggression <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> victimization were collected through teacher <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> report, whereas data on depressive symptoms were collected through self-, teacher, <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> report. Peer rejection was measured through peer nominations of liking and disliking. Through testing two competing concurrent structural models, results revealed that <b>peer</b> rejection <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> victimization jointly mediated the overall relation between aggression and depressive symptoms, although this mediation was only partial. Furthermore, peer rejection partially mediated the relation between aggression <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> victimization, <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> victimization partially mediated the relation between <b>peer</b> rejection <b>and</b> depressive symptoms.

In the current study, the correspondence between teacher <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> nomination methods for {{the identification of}} preference and popularity was examined. Participants were 733 children in grade 5 / 6 (M age = 12. 05 years, SD=. 64; 53. 3 percent boys) and their 29 teachers. Children and teachers completed nomination questions for preference, popularity, and 12 social behaviors. Results showed moderate overlap between teacher <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> nominations of social status; teachers <b>and</b> <b>peers</b> agreed on students' preference and popularity levels in 62. 7 percent and 69 percent of the cases, respectively. Secondly, we examined the social behaviors (prosocial behaviors, overt and relational aggression, victimization) that teachers <b>and</b> <b>peers</b> ascribe to children {{at different levels of}} preference and popularity. Both teachers <b>and</b> <b>peers</b> made clear behavioral distinctions between low, average, and highly preferred or popular children. For preference, the behavioral profiles did not differ between teachers <b>and</b> <b>peers.</b> For popularity, no differences between teachers <b>and</b> <b>peers</b> were found in the behavioral descriptions of unpopular and average children. However, teachers <b>and</b> <b>peers</b> differed in their behavioral descriptions of popular children. Implications and directions for further research are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Objective: In {{adolescence}} {{many children}} are gaining sexual experience. The aim of this longitudinal study is to investigate the influence of parents <b>and</b> <b>peers</b> on the sexual experiences from adolescents. Method: Through a literature review eight variables were described. Namely, parent-child relationship, friendship quality, the perception of sexual attitudes from parents <b>and</b> <b>peers,</b> communication with parents <b>and</b> <b>peers,</b> sexual experience from <b>peers</b> <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> pressure. Correlations <b>and</b> multiple regression analyses {{have been used to}} examine the relationship of these variables on sexual experiences in adolescence. In this longitudinal study, the measures were taking on two measurement points. Results: Most of the variables are positively related to sexual experiences in adolescence, except for parent-child relationship and the perception of sexual attitudes from peers. The strongest predictors are communication with parents <b>and</b> <b>peers</b> <b>and</b> the sexual experience from peers. Conclusion: Based on the results both parents <b>and</b> <b>peers</b> have an influence on the sexual experiences from adolescents, but peers seem to have the greatest impact...|$|R
40|$|This paper explores an {{application}} of an online tool SPARKPLUS (Self <b>and</b> <b>Peer</b> Assessment Resource Kit) for the self <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> assessment on the group-based Honours’ research projects. The Honours’ research projects in School of Civil, Environmental Engineering at University of Adelaide are running in {{a small group of}} students (typically four students or less) working with an academic supervisor in a selected area for one year. Since the research project is self-directed study, {{it is very difficult to}} fairly assess the contribution of individual students to the group-based research project. The paper-based method of self <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> assessment for the Honour’s research projects was used in the previous years. The same mark was often distributed and no feedback was given. Both the students and academic staff were not satisfied with the paper-based method of self <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> assessment. Thus an online tool SPARK PLUS together with a set of assessment criteria was used for the self <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> assessment of the Honours’ research projects in 2010. Thirty-seven groups participated in the self <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> assessment of using SPARK PLUS in semester one 2010 and a series of results from the online self <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> assessment were obtained and analysed.

40|$|Benchmarking <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> review are {{essential}} elements of the so-called EU open method of coordination (OMC) which has been contested in the literature for lack of effectiveness. In this paper we compare benchmarking <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> review procedures as used by the EU with those used by the OECD. Different types of benchmarking <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> review are distinguished and pitfalls for (international) benchmarking are discussed. We find that the OECD has a clear single objective for its benchmarking <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> review activities (i. e. horizontal policy transfers) whereas the EU suffers from a mix of objectives (a. horizontal policy learning; b. EU wide vertical policy coordination and c. multilateral monitoring and surveillance {{under the shadow of}} hierarchy). Whereas the OECD is able to skirt around most of the benchmarking pitfalls, {{this is not the case}} for the EU. It is argued that, rather than continue working with the panacea OMC benchmarking <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> review currently represents, EU benchmarking should take a number of more distinct shapes in order to improve effectiveness. Moreover, in some areas benchmarking <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> review are not sufficient coordination tools, and are at best additional to those means of coordination that include enforceable sanctions...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{investigations}} of the longitudinal outcomes of childhood aggression, social withdrawal and likeability have relied on the reports of a single observer, or combined the results of several observers in the prediction of adult outcomes. By comparing self <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> perceptions of childhood behaviour, the present studies proposed to clarify {{the nature of the}} relation between childhood behaviours and adult outcomes. Four questions were examined being (1) how were childhood behaviour patterns related to adult outcomes; (2) how did self <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> perceptions compare in the prediction of adult outcomes; (3) was the relation between self <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> perspectives additive in the prediction of these outcomes; and (4) did concordance between self <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> perspectives predict adult outcomes? Data from the Concordia Risk Project were employed to determine the socioeconomic, personality, and substance abuse outcomes. Both self <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> perceptions of childhood behaviour were associated with adult outcomes, although generally, self perceptions as opposed to peer perceptions of childhood behaviours were more strongly associated with adult outcomes in women. Including both self <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> perceptions did not have an additive effect in the prediction of adult outcomes, although there was some support for the importance of concordance in education and income outcomes. The findings suggest that self <b>and</b> <b>peer</b> perceptions of childhood behaviour each provide some unique information.
