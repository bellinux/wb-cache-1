50|$|Braided area rugs can be {{constructed}} {{in a variety of}} different ways including a banded braid construction, cloth braid construction, flat braid construction and yarn braid construction. Banded braid constructions have wide bands of either solid colored or variegated braids made from predetermined patterns to offer an appealing, thick look. A cloth braid construction is indicative of a time when outgrown clothing was cut into strips and then hand braided into a floor covering. This particular construction is unique to one manufacturer, Thorndike Mills. A flat braid construction is a common construction as it's one of the easier and more classic methods. Simply intertwine three ropes of fabric and/or yarn, and you'll have yourself a braided rug. A yarn braid construction evolves from yarn in its initial state to a uniquely finished <b>area</b> <b>rug.</b>|$|E
50|$|Electric {{systems are}} {{used only for}} heating and employ non-corrosive, {{flexible}} heating elements including cables, pre-formed cable mats, bronze mesh, and carbon films. Due to their low profile they can be installed in a thermal mass or directly under floor finishes. Electric systems can also take advantage of time-of-use electricity metering and are frequently used as carpet heaters, portable under <b>area</b> <b>rug</b> heaters, under laminate floor heaters, under tile heating, under wood floor heating, and floor warming systems, including under shower floor and seat heating. Large electric systems also require skilled designers and tradespeople but this is less so for small floor warming systems. Electric systems use fewer components and are simpler to install and commission than hydronic systems. Some electric systems use line voltage technology while others use low voltage technology. Power consumption of an electric system {{is not based on}} voltage but rather wattage output produced by the heating element.|$|E

50|$|Part of {{that was}} {{due to the nature of}} the trading system, where the trader could not own their own store or land, which had to be leased from the Navajo.

Long-term traders, such as John Lorenzo Hubbell or William Keams, established relationships with tribal members to foster long-term repeat business.

50|$|When Tibetan rug weaving {{began to}} revive in the 1970s, {{it was not}} in Tibet, but rather in Nepal and India. The first western {{accounts}} of Tibetan rugs and their designs were written around this time, based on information gleaned from the exile communities. Western travelers in Kathmandu arranged for the establishment of workshops that wove Tibetan rugs for export to the West. Weaving in the Nepal and India carpet workshops was eventually dominated by local non-Tibetan workers, who replaced the original Tibetan émigré weavers. The native Nepalese weavers in particular quickly broadened the designs on the Tibetan carpet from the small traditional <b>rugs</b> to large <b>area</b> <b>rugs</b> suitable for use in western living rooms. This began a carpet industry that is important to the Nepalese economy even to this day, even though its reputation was eventually tarnished by child labor scandals during the 1990s.|$|R

Gill's acrylic painting Ocean was recreated as a floor covering. [...] "I actually work on most of my paintings with the canvas directly on the floor, so {{in this case the}} image returns to the place it originated." [...] He says the palette of blues against the muted background speaks to the spirit of his home province. [...] "It’s an expression of movement, vigour and life that is {{so much a part of}} everyday existence in Newfoundland - could be wind patterns, could be an iceberg slowly tracing a course on the ocean. When icebergs float by the narrows of the St John’s harbour in spring, the sea becomes an ever-changing landscape, an active landscape." ...|$|R
50|$|Anatolia can {{be divided}} into three major <b>areas</b> of <b>rug</b> production, {{centered}} around local towns and marketplaces, which often lend their names to the rugs produced in the surrounding area. Western, Central, and Eastern Anatolia have distinct weaving traditions. However, commercially produced carpets are often woven irrespective of local design traditions. Preferential use of different materials and dyes, as well as characteristic designs, sometimes allow for a more specific assignment of a carpet to one of the three regions, or to a more specific weaving place.|$|R
