In this work we show the existence of a reverse link: when the enforcement of contractual terms is imperfect, the rules of the awarding mechanism can help to improve the efficiency of the contractual relationship. In some circumstances, <b>awarding</b> <b>rules</b> based only on bids are not able {{to deal with the problem}} of opportunistic behaviour during the execution of the contract. Our model points out that the public administration can incentivize the contractor's fairness by considering not only competitors' bids, but also their different reputation.

40|$|The Selvester {{score is}} an {{effective}} means for estimating the extent of myocardial scar in a patient from lowcost ECG recordings. Automation of such a system is deemed to help implementing low-cost high-volume screening mechanisms of scar in the primary care. This article describes, {{for the first time}} to the best of our knowledge, an automated implementation of the updated Selvester scoring system for that purpose, where fractionated QRS morphologies and patterns are identified and classified using a novel Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT) based fractionation detection algorithm. This stage informs the two principal steps of the updated Selvester scoring scheme - the confounder classification and the point <b>awarding</b> <b>rules.</b> The complete system is validated on 51 ECG records of patients detected with ischemic heart disease. Validation has been carried out using manually detected confounder classes and computation of the actual score by expert cardiologists as the ground truth. Our results show that as a stand-alone system it is able to classify different confounders with 94. 1 % accuracy whereas it exhibits 94 % accuracy in computing the actual score. When coupled with our previously proposed automated ECG delineation algorithm, that provides the input ECG parameters, the overall system shows 90 % accuracy in confounder classification and 92 % accuracy in computing the actual score and thereby showing comparable performance to the stand-alone system proposed here, with the added advantage of complete automated analysis without any human intervention...|$|E

We {{identify}} the family of rules that satisfy strong composition down (robustness with respect to reevaluations of the estate) and consistency (robustness with respect to changes in the set of agents) together. Such a family is the fixed path rules, which is a generalization of the weighted constrained equal <b>awards</b> <b>rules.</b> In addition, once strong composition down and consistency are combined with homogeneity only the weighted constrained equal <b>awards</b> <b>rules</b> survive.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the implications of}} two properties, sustainability and exemption, when imposed separately {{in conjunction with other}} basic properties for the resolution of conflicting claims. Under the protective properties, agents with sufficiently small claims in relation to the others are fully reimbursed. We base three characterizations of the constrained equal <b>awards</b> <b>rule</b> on the properties. Namely, (1) the constrained equal <b>awards</b> <b>rule</b> is the only rule satisfying sustainability and claims monotonicity, (2) it is the only rule satisfying sustainability and super-modularity, and (3) it is the only rule satisfying exemption, order preservation and consistency. Then, we extend the notions of the protective properties to groups of agents, and show that no rule satisfies any of these extensions. claims problem; sustainability; exemption; constrained equal <b>awards</b> <b>rule...</b>|$|R

40|$|An {{extension}} of the standard rationing model is introduced. Agents are not only identi fied by their respective claims over some amount of a scarce resource, but also by some payoff thresholds. These thresholds introduce exogenous differences among agents (full or partial priority, past allocations, past debts, [...] .) that may influence the final distribution. Within this framework we provide generalizations of the constrained equal <b>awards</b> <b>rule</b> and the constrained equal losses rule. We show that these generalized rules are dual from each other. We characterize the generalization of the equal <b>awards</b> <b>rule</b> by using the properties of consistency, path-independence and compensated exemption.

40|$|Undertaking joint {{projects}} in practice involves {{a lot of}} uncertainty, {{especially when it comes}} to the final costs. This paper addresses the problem of sharing realized costs by the participants, subject to their indvidual liquidity constraints. If all cost levels can be accounted for, and it the individual agent's liquidity is at least the fair share of the average risk-adjusted costs, then it is possible to find an egalitarian solution to this problem. We characterize this rule by means of properties that are defined for solutions in the context of rationingn problems. The rule we propose is reminiscent to the constrained equal <b>award</b> <b>rule</b> in rationing models. First, there is a vector of transfers allocated to the agents if there are no costs of the project. The constrained equal <b>award</b> <b>rule</b> is applied to the variable component, i. e., when the liquidities are corrected for the transfers...|$|R
