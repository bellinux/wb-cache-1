5|$|A {{key action}} which {{physically}} connects {{the keys and}} the windchests is <b>a</b> <b>mechanical</b> or tracker action.

5|$|Although the {{mortuary}} inscription of Pacificus, archdeacon of Verona, {{records that}} he constructed a night clock (horologium nocturnum) {{as early as}} 850, his clock {{has been identified as}} being an observation tube used to locate stars with an accompanying book of astronomical observations, rather than <b>a</b> <b>mechanical</b> or water clock, an interpretation supported by illustrations from medieval manuscripts.|$|E

Norton {{designed the}} filter in the electrical domain and then used the correspondence of mechanical quantities to electrical quantities to realise the filter using mechanical components. Mass corresponds to inductance, stiffness to elastance and damping to resistance. The filter was designed to have a maximally flat frequency response.|$|E

5|$|In modern designs it {{is common}} to use quartz crystal filters, {{especially}} for narrowband filtering applications. The signal exists as <b>a</b> <b>mechanical</b> acoustic wave while it is in the crystal and is converted by transducers between the electrical and mechanical domains at the terminals of the crystal.|$|E
5|$|Interdigital {{filters are}} {{another form of}} coupled-line filter. Each section of line is about λ/4 in length and is {{terminated}} in a short-circuit at one end only, the other end being left open-circuit. The end which is short-circuited alternates on each line section. This topology is straightforward to implement in planar technologies, but also particularly lends itself to <b>a</b> <b>mechanical</b> assembly of lines fixed inside a metal case. The lines can be either circular rods or rectangular bars, and interfacing to a coaxial format line is easy. As with the parallel-coupled line filter, the advantage of <b>a</b> <b>mechanical</b> arrangement that does not require insulators for support is that dielectric losses are eliminated. The spacing requirement between lines is not as stringent as in the parallel line structure; as such, higher fractional bandwidths can be achieved, and Q values as low as 1.4 are possible.|$|E

5|$|After the trachea {{has been}} intubated, a balloon cuff is {{typically}} inflated {{just above the}} far end of the tube to help secure it in place, to prevent leakage of respiratory gases, and to protect the tracheobronchial tree from receiving undesirable material such as stomach acid. The tube is then secured to the face or neck and connected to a T-piece, anesthesia breathing circuit, bag valve mask device, or <b>a</b> <b>mechanical</b> ventilator. Once there is no longer a need for ventilatory assistance and/or protection of the airway, the tracheal tube is removed; this is referred to as extubation of the trachea (or decannulation, in the case of a surgical airway such as a cricothyrotomy or a tracheotomy).|$|E
