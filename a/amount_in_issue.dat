50|$|In the Federal Court in Canada, the prothonotary {{is not a}} clerk, {{but instead}} is a {{judicial}} officer appointed under the Federal Courts Act and exercises many of the powers and functions of a Federal Court judge. The prothonotary's authority includes mediation, case management, practice motions (including those that {{may result in a}} final disposition of the case, regardless of the <b>amount</b> <b>in</b> <b>issue),</b> as well as trials of actions in which up to $50,000 is claimed (see Rules 50, 382, and 383 to 387 of the Federal Courts Rules).

50|$|The Small Claims Court has {{jurisdiction}} in civil matters where the <b>amount</b> <b>in</b> <b>issue</b> does not exceed $25,000.00 exclusive {{of interest and}} costs. The monetary jurisdiction of this court is fixed by regulation, rising to the current limit from $10,000 on January 1, 2010. The majority of Small Claims Court matters are heard by deputy judges, lawyers who have been appointed for a period of three years by the Regional Senior Justice to hear such cases. As result of court reform, no new full-time judges have been appointed by the provincial government to preside in Small Claims Court. Proceedings in the Small Claims Court are governed by a codified set of rules contained in O. Reg. 258/98 (as amended), the Rules of the Small Claims Court, instead of the complex Ontario Rules of Civil Procedure.|$|E
40|$|When an {{employer}} terminates a defined benefit plan and contributes the assets withdrawn {{to either a}} defined contribution plan or an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) and the amount contributed is {{in excess of the}} employer's required (or maximum) annual contribution to the plan, the assets in excess of the required contribution are maintained in a suspense account pending allocation to plan participants. Those assets are not allocated to individual participants ' accounts, and the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets are retained by the employer. Excess contributions made to an ESOP must be converted to employer's stock within 90 days of the asset reversion (or used to retire debt incurred to acquire the employer's stock).

We estimate these models with a Tobit specification 7 with standard errors robust to heteroscedasticity and clustered at the bank level. The dependent variable is the log of the amount issued at month t, taking the value of zero if the bank does not issue. Each regression has been estimated separately, but the results in Table  5 follow the same structure as the results in Tables  3, 4. The explanatory variables are the same as in the multinomial logit that were explained in Sect.  3.2. For columns (1), (2), and (3), the dependent variable is the log of the <b>amount</b> <b>issued</b> <b>in</b> the form of debt, hybrid, or capital instruments, respectively. For Column (4), the dependent variable is the log of the total amount of funds issued under any form of financial instrument.|$|R

The ability of immobilised lipase (Lipozyme IM- 77) from Rhizomucor miehei to {{catalyse}} the transesterification of hexanol and tributyrin was investigated in this study. Response surface methodology (RSM) and five-level-five-factor central composite rotatable design (CCRD) were employed to evaluate the effects of synthesis parameters, such as reaction time (2 to 10 h), temperature (25 to 65 °C), enzyme amount (10 to 50 %), substrate <b>amount</b> (<b>in</b> mol) ratio of tributyrin to hexanol (1 : 1 to 3 : 1), and added water content (0 to 20 %), on percentage <b>amount</b> (<b>in</b> mol) conversion of hexyl butyrate by transesterification.
