Neapolitans must be well socialized with people (especially children), as they are large, {{powerful}} dogs and do not always know their own strength. Additionally, young children have young friends, and even with extensive socialization and training, Neapolitans will be wary of strangers and protective of their family, which can be disastrous for small children. Most of the time, they will protect their owners with their lives.|$|E

25|$|Lighting a {{fire and}} cooking food are among the {{activities}} prohibited on Shabbat by the written Torah.

The pre-cooked food may then be kept hot for the Shabbat meal by the provision in the Rabbinical oral law, which explains that one may use a fire that was lit before Shabbat to keep warm food that was already cooked before Shabbat.|$|E

25|$|To prevent electrocution, RCDs should {{operate within}} 25–40 {{milliseconds}} with any leakage currents (through a person) of greater than 30 mA, before electric shock can drive the heart into ventricular fibrillation, {{the most common}} cause of death through electric shock. By contrast, conventional circuit breakers or fuses only break the circuit when the total current is excessive (which may be thousands of times the leakage current an RCD responds to). A small leakage current, such as through a person, can be a very serious fault, but would probably not increase the total current enough for a fuse or circuit breaker to break the circuit, <b>and</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> do so fast enough to save a life.|$|E

25|$|In late March 1966 in Michigan, {{two days}} of mass UFO {{sightings}} were reported, and received significant publicity. After studying the reports, Hynek offered a provisional hypothesis {{for some of the}} sightings: a few of about 100 witnesses had mistaken swamp gas for something more spectacular. At the press conference where he made his announcement, Hynek repeatedly and strenuously stated that swamp gas was a plausible explanation for only a portion of the Michigan UFO reports, <b>and</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> for UFO reports in general. But much to his chagrin, Hynek's qualifications of his hypothesis were largely overlooked, and the term swamp gas was repeated ad infinitum in relation to UFO reports.

25|$|Over the stola, {{women often}} wore the palla, {{a sort of}} {{rectangular}} shawl up to 11 feet long, and five wide. It could be worn as a coat, or draped over the left shoulder, under the right arm, and then over the left arm. No respectable woman went bareheaded in public, so the palla could {{also serve as a}} hooded cloak. The combination of stola and palla identified the wearer as a respectable married woman, not to be insulted or trifled with, <b>and</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> available for sexual predation. In contrast, some Roman literary sources have been interpreted as evidence that high-caste women convicted of adultery, and high-class female prostitutes (meretrices), were not only forbidden public use of the stola, but were expected to wear the toga instead, as a sign of their infamy.|$|E
25|$|Only a {{few more}} settings, {{completing}} {{the first half of}} the Italienisches Liederbuch, were composed in 1891 before Wolf's mental and physical health once again took a downturn at the end of the year; exhaustion from his prolific past few years combined with the effects of syphilis and his depressive temperament caused him to stop composing for the next several years. Continuing concerts of his works in Austria and Germany spread his growing fame; even Brahms and the critics who had previously reviled Wolf gave favorable reviews. However, Wolf was consumed with depression, which stopped him from writing—which only left him more depressed. He completed orchestrations of previous works, but new compositions were not forthcoming, <b>and</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> the opera which he was now fixated on composing, still convinced that success in the larger forms was the mark of compositional greatness.|$|E

25|$|The food of this {{carnivore}} consists {{mainly of}} mid-sized mammals; the introduced European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) {{seems to have}} become a key prey item. The black-chested buzzard-eagle is helpful to farmers by keeping down the numbers of the rabbits, which can be serious agricultural pests. Among the native fauna degus (Octodon) and hog-nosed skunks (Conepatus) are important prey, but mammals as formidable as a gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) – two to over three times as heavy as the birds <b>and</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> defenceless – are occasionally hunted and killed by this hawk. Its diet is rounded off with an occasional bird – including carnivorous species like the burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia) and sizeable prey such as Penelope guans or the Chilean tinamou (Nothoprocta perdicaria) –, large squamates, and if need be also arthropods and carrion. While not aggressive under normal circumstances, the black-chested eagle-buzzard will fiercely attack humans if it considers itself or its offspring threatened. It is {{near the top of}} the avian food chain in its range, in part since it is the only Andean eagle found outside forest habitats. It may compete for carrion with the much larger Andean condor.|$|E

500|$|Dromaeosaurids, {{especially}} Deinonychus, {{are often}} depicted as unusually fast-running {{animals in the}} popular media, and Ostrom himself speculated that Deinonychus was fleet-footed in his original description. However, when first described, a complete leg of Deinonychus had not been found, and Ostrom's speculation {{about the length of}} the femur (upper leg bone) later proved to have been an overestimate. In a later study, Ostrom noted that the ratio of the femur to the tibia (lower leg bone) is not as important in determining speed as the relative length of the foot and lower leg. In modern fleet-footed birds, like the ostrich, the foot-tibia ratio is [...]95. In unusually fast-running dinosaurs, like Struthiomimus, the ratio is [...]68, but in Deinonychus the ratio is [...]48.

Charles Theodore, who had dreamed of rebuilding the Burgundian empire, realized that Joseph was not seriously planning to exchange Bavaria, or even a portion of it, for the entirety of the Austrian Netherlands. At best, he might acquire a few portions of it, perhaps Hainaut or Guelders, Luxembourg, Limburg, or various dispersed possessions in Anterior Austria, most of which lay in southwestern Germany, but Joseph would never release any sizable portion of territory, <b>and</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> any territory of strategic military or commercial value.|$|E

Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., who became director of the Manhattan Project on [...] September 8, 1942, met Oppenheimer at Berkeley, where Oppenheimer briefed Groves on his work on the [...] "Super" [...] (thermonuclear) bomb. Oppenheimer told Groves on October 8 that the Manhattan Project needed a dedicated weapons development laboratory. Groves agreed, and after a second meeting with Oppenheimer on a train on October 15, decided that Oppenheimer was the man he needed to head what became the Los Alamos Laboratory, despite Oppenheimer's lack of a Nobel Prize or administrative experience.|$|E
500|$|Pope Innocent XI (1676–1689) despised the {{practice}} and only accepted his election as Pope after the College of Cardinals consented to his plans for reform, which included a ban on nepotism. However, Innocent XI backed down after thrice failing to achieve {{the support of the}} majority of his cardinals for a bull banning nepotism, which had been tediously composed between 1677 and 1686. Innocent XI refused entreaties from within the papal court to bring his only nephew, Livio Odescalchi, the prince of Sirmio, to Rome, although he did elevate Carlo Stefano Anastasio Ciceri, a distant relative, cardinal on September 2, 1686. Innocent XI's successor, Pope Alexander VIII (1689–1691), was the last Pope to create a Cardinal Nephew. Alexander VIII also undid another reform of Innocent XI by restoring the revenues of the former Chancery to the Vice-Chancellor, who was, at the time, his cardinal-nephew, Pietro Ottoboni. Edith Standen, a consultant to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, calls Ottoboni the [...] "last <b>and</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>not</b> least magnificent example" [...] of the [...] "splendor of an extinct species, the Cardinal-Nephew".|$|E

[...] Patrick Samuel of Static Mass also rated Project Dawn three out of five stars, stating that the main story was [...] "an intriguing one with implications of a conspiracy deep within MI6," [...] but was critical that the series mostly focused on Scott rather than the other main characters, the movement of the storyline, and that Scott and Stonebridge [...] "seemed to be most inapt pair to lead missions as they blow their cover on several occasions, endangering others."
