25|$|For {{registered}} land, {{adverse possession}} claims completed before 13 October 2003 (the date the 2002 Act came into force) {{are governed by}} section 75(1) and 75(2) of the Land Registration Act of 1925. The limitation period remains the same (12 years) but instead of the original owner's title to the land being extinguished, the original owner holds the land on trust for the <b>adverse</b> <b>possessor.</b> The <b>adverse</b> <b>possessor</b> can then apply {{to be the new}} registered proprietor of the land.|$|E
25|$|Chattel {{property}} {{may also}} be adversely possessed, but owing to {{the differences in the}} nature of real and chattel property, the rules governing such claims are rather more stringent, favoring the legal owner rather than the <b>adverse</b> <b>possessor.</b> Claims for adverse possession of chattel often involve works of art.|$|E
25|$|The {{rules for}} {{unregistered}} land remained as before. But under the LRA 2002 Schedule 6, paragraphs 1 to 5, after 10 years the <b>adverse</b> <b>possessor</b> {{is entitled to}} apply to the registrar to become the new registered owner. The registrar then contacts the registered title holder and notifies him of the application. If no proceedings are launched for two years to eject the <b>adverse</b> <b>possessor,</b> only then would the registrar transfer title. Prior to the 2002 Act, a land owner could simply lose title without being aware of it or notified. This was the rule because it indicated the owner had never paid sufficient attention to how the land was in fact being used, and therefore the former owner did not deserve to keep it. Before 2002, time was seen to cure everything. The rule's function was to ensure land was used efficiently.|$|E

25|$|A {{disseisor}} will be {{committing a}} civil trespass {{on the property}} he has taken {{and the owner of}} the property could cause him to be evicted by an action in trespass ("ejectment") or by bringing an action for possession. All common law jurisdictions require that an ejectment action be brought within a specified time, after which the true owner is assumed to have acquiesced. The effect of a failure by the true landowner to evict the <b>adverse</b> <b>possessor</b> depends on the jurisdiction, but will eventually result in title by adverse possession.|$|E
2500|$|Courts {{have long}} ruled that when an owner does not {{exercise}} {{their right to}} recover their property and {{the statute of limitations}} on recovery expires, not only is the original owner prevented from exercising their rights on the property, but an entirely new title to the property springs up in the <b>adverse</b> <b>possessor.</b> [...] In effect, the <b>adverse</b> <b>possessor</b> becomes the property's new owner. In the United States, the time limit on an owner being able to recover their property varies widely between individual states, ranging from as low as five years to as many as 40 years.|$|E
2500|$|Depending on the jurisdiction, one {{squatter}} {{may or may}} {{not pass}} along continuous possession to another squatter, known as [...] "tacking". Tacking is defined as [...] "The joining of consecutive periods of possession by different persons to treat the periods as one continuous period; esp., the adding of one's own period of land possession to that of a prior possessor to establish continuous adverse possession for the statutory period." [...] There are three types of Privity: Privity of Contract; Privity of Possession; and Privity of Estate. [...] One of the three types of privity is required in order for one <b>adverse</b> <b>possessor</b> to [...] "tack" [...] their time onto another <b>adverse</b> <b>possessor</b> in order to complete the statutory time period. One way tacking occurs is when the conveyance of the property from one <b>adverse</b> <b>possessor</b> to another is founded upon a written document (usually an erroneous deed), indicating [...] "color of title." [...] A lawful owner may also restart the clock at zero by giving temporary permission for the occupation of the property, thus defeating the necessary [...] "continuous and hostile" [...] element. Evidence that a squatter paid rent to the owner would defeat adverse possession for that period.|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} an {{interest}} 2 ̆ 2 running 2 ̆ 2 with particular realty is employed in connection with assignments of easements and profits to develop rules which are reasonably clear and free from dispute in most situations. The burden, on the servient land passes with such land to all takers thereof. In theory {{this end of the}} easement or profit runs with the servient tenement itself, rather than merely with an estate therein, and hence is binding upon even <b>adverse</b> <b>possessors</b> of the freehold. The benefit of an easement appurtenant to some dominant tenement passes freely therewith even without separate mention. The benefit of a profit appurtenant passes in similar fashion. The only limitation is that the servient land must not be 2 ̆ 2 surcharged, 2 ̆ 2 or unduly burdened, by certain transfers as described below. s The benefit of a profit in gross is freely assignable from one person to another, subject only to the rule that where assigned to more than one the new takers must 2 ̆ 2 work together with one stock 2 ̆ 2 that is, in common as one person. But when we come to easements in gross, a serious difference of opinion exists on the question {{whether or not they are}} transferable.

40|$|Adverse-possession {{doctrine}} labors under {{a pair of}} disabilities: a hesitancy by theorists {{to embrace}} the abandonment-and-recapture principle that informs the doctrine, and a substantial unwillingness of governments to abandon an antiquated and outmoded maxim shielding them from the doctrine 2 ̆ 7 s important work. Removing these disabilities will allow a series of positive outcomes. First, it will demonstrate that all would-be <b>adverse</b> <b>possessors,</b> not just those acting 2 ̆ 2 in good faith 2 ̆ 2 or with possessory intent, should enjoy {{the fruits of the}} doctrine. Second, it will provide valuable additional means by which the public may monitor the performance of government employees, and additional discipline to governments tempted to allow their aspirational commitments to outstrip their fiscal capacities. As an added benefit, it can achieve these ends without posing any threat to emergent environmental values, while serving as a positive support for effective government conservation efforts. Moreover, once adverse possession is recognized as a process of abandonment and recapture, and is applied to government entities as well as to private, opportunities arise to employ the doctrine expansively for the protection of property and liberty interests against aggressive overregulation and overcriminalization. The doctrine can become a tool for tempering and restraining burgeoning zoning and other property- and liberty-curtailing regulations by declaring regulations that have gone long unenforced in the face of broad, open public violation to be abandoned and unenforceable. Perhaps most intriguingly, it can provide a secure foundation in the American legal system for the doctrine of desuetude, by which long-violated and long-unenforced criminal prohibitions lose their restrictive capacity...|$|R
40|$|Under the “Maine Rule” for <b>adverse</b> possession, only <b>possessors</b> {{who have}} the {{requisite}} intent can perfect an adverse possession claim. The Maine Rule has been consistently criticized. The history behind {{the adoption of the}} Maine Rule, however, and the purpose it was to serve, have been ignored. This Article fills that void. This inquiry leads to some surprising revelations about the Maine Rule. The Maine Rule was originally adopted so as to distinguish prior Maine cases rejecting adverse possession in mistaken boundary situations. The purpose behind the Maine Rule, then, was to enable—rather than prohibit— adverse possession. The history surrounding the adoption of the Maine Rule has contemporary value; this history powerfully demonstrates the pitfalls of using a claimant’s state of mind as part of an adverse possession analysis...|$|R

2500|$|Before the {{considerable}} hurdle of giving a registered owner notice was introduced, the particular requirements of adverse possession were reasonably straight forward. First, under Schedule 1, paragraphs 1 and 8 of the Limitation Act 1980, {{the time when}} adverse possession began was when [...] "possession" [...] was taken. This {{had to be more}} than something temporary or transitory, such as simply storing goods on a land for a brief period. But [...] "possession" [...] did not require actual occupation. So in Powell v McFarlane, it was held to be [...] "possession" [...] when Mr Powell, from age 14, let his cows roam into Mr McFarlane's land. The second requirement, however, was that there needed to be an intention to possess the land. Mr Powell lost his claim because simply letting his cows roam was an equivocal act: it was only later that there was evidence he intended to take possession, for instance by erecting signs on the land and parking a lorry. But this had not happened long enough for the 12 year time limit on McFarlane's claim to have expired. Third, possession is not considered [...] "adverse" [...] if the person is there with the owner's consent. For example, in BP Properties Ltd v Buckler, Dillon LJ held that Mrs Buckler could not claim adverse possession over land owned by BP because BP had told her she could stay rent free for life. Fourth, under the Limitation Act 1980 sections 29 and 30, the <b>adverse</b> <b>possessor</b> must not have acknowledged the title of the owner in any express way, or the clock starts running again. However, the courts have interpreted this requirement flexibly.|$|E
50|$|In three special cases, the <b>adverse</b> <b>possessor</b> may be {{registered}} as proprietor {{without having to}} wait for two further years {{and even if the}} proprietor objects. These special cases usually arise because the <b>adverse</b> <b>possessor</b> has some other reason for claiming ownership in addition to their possession for (at least) 10 years.|$|E

50|$|The Land Registry is {{obliged to}} notify the {{registered}} proprietor of the land that an application for possessory title has been made. The registered proprietor then has 65 days to object to the registration. The objection may dispute the applicant's right to be registered as owner or, more usually, the registered proprietor will claim {{the benefit of the}} process found in paragraph 5 of Schedule 6. This provides that a registered proprietor who objects has a further two years to evict the <b>adverse</b> <b>possessor.</b> It will be enough to secure eviction within these two years that the registered proprietor relies on their registered title. No other reason need be given. Failure to secure the eviction of the <b>adverse</b> <b>possessor</b> within these two years gives the <b>adverse</b> <b>possessor</b> the right to re-apply to be registered and such a second application will be successful.|$|E

50|$|Adverse {{possession}} is {{a situation}} when a person {{who does not have}} legal title to land (or real property) occupies the land without the permission of the legal owner. The permission of the owner may be reflected in the entering into a lease or granting a licence, typically associated with the payment of some rent. The laws of many countries allow the <b>adverse</b> <b>possessor</b> (in law also called the disseisor) to acquire title to the land after a prescribed statutory period, which varies between jurisdictions, and depends on the type of land and other circumstances. The laws of most jurisdictions do not permit claims of adverse possession against public land. Squatting is a form of adverse possession. The <b>adverse</b> <b>possessor</b> is usually required to prove non-permissive use which is actual, open and notorious, exclusive, adverse, and continuous for the statutory period. If a claim to title by adverse possession is successful, title is acquired without compensation.|$|E

5000|$|The most {{contentious}} method of acquiring property, albeit {{one that has}} played a huge role {{in the history of}} English land, is adverse possession. Historically, if someone possessed land for long enough, it was thought that this in itself justified acquisition of a good title. This meant that while English land was continually conquered, pillaged, and stolen by various factions, lords or barons throughout the middle ages, those who could show they possessed land long enough would not have their title questioned. A more modern function has been that land which is disused or neglected by an owner may be converted into another's property if continual use is made. Squatting in England has been a way for land to be efficiently used, particularly in periods of economic decline. Before the Land Registration Act 2002, if a person had possessed land for 12 years, then at common law, the previous owner's right of action to eject the [...] "adverse possessor" [...] would expire. The common legal justification was that under the Limitation Act 1980, just like a cause of action in contract or tort had to be used within a time limit, so did an action to recover land. This promoted the finality of litigation and the certainty of claims. Time would start running when someone took exclusive possession of land, or part of it, and intended to possess it adversely to the interests of the current owner. Provided the common law requirements of [...] "possession" [...] that was [...] "adverse" [...] were fulfilled, after 12 years, the owner would cease to be able to assert a claim. However, in the LRA 2002 adverse possession of registered land became much harder. The rules for unregistered land remained as before. But under the LRA 2002 Schedule 6, paragraphs 1 to 5, after 10 years the <b>adverse</b> <b>possessor</b> was entitled to apply to the registrar to become the new registered owner. The registrar would then contact the registered title holder and notify them of the application. If no proceedings were launched for two years to eject the <b>adverse</b> <b>possessor,</b> only then would the registrar transfer title. Before, a land owner could simply lose title without being aware of it or notified.

Before 2002, time was seen to cure everything. The rule's function was to ensure land was used efficiently. The darker side, was that this idea was also very convenient for an age when land was often taken by force, and when doctrines like terra nullius were espoused by imperialists as justifications for colonisation in British Empire.|$|E

Mr Pye refused to renew a lease, on the basis that this might disturb getting planning permission. In fact the land remained unused, Mr Pye did nothing, while the Grahams continued to retain a key to the property and used it as part of their farm. At the end of the limitation period, they claimed the land was theirs. They had in fact offered to buy a licence from Mr Pye, but the House of Lords held that this did not amount to an acknowledgement of title that would deprive them of a claim. Having lost in the UK courts, Mr Pye took the case to the European Court of Human Rights, arguing that his business should receive £10 million in compensation because it was a breach of his right under ECHR Protocol 1, article 1 to [...] "peaceful enjoyment of possessions". The Court rejected this, holding that it was within a member state's margin of appreciation to determine the relevant property rules. Otherwise, a significant limit on the principle in the case of leases is that adverse possession actions will only succeed against the leaseholder, and not the freeholder once the lease has expired. However the main limitation remains that the 2002 legislation appears to have emasculated the principle of adverse possession, because the Registrar now effectively informs owners of the steps to be taken to stop adverse possession in its tracks.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} I will be {{examining}} {{the position of}} the squatter who, knowing the land belongs to another, purposefully sets out to acquire it through the doctrine of adverse possession. This type of squatter is sometimes described as a bad faith <b>adverse</b> <b>possessor</b> while a person who believes that they own the land in question may be referred to as a good faith <b>adverse</b> <b>possessor.</b> It would be easy to assume that bad faith adverse possessors are universally viewed as moral degenerates or scoundrels who do not deserve to benefit from the doctrine of adverse possession.

Division 5 of Part 6 of the Land Title Act 1994 (Qld) which guarantees registered freehold title expressly deals with the right of adverse possession however, there is no such provision in the present Land Act 1994 unlike s 170 of the Crown Lands Act 1989 (NSW) which expressly precludes claims for adverse possession of specified non freehold land. There is no mention of adverse possession in any version of the Queensland Land Acts and only s 6 (4) of the Limitation of Actions Act 1974 makes it clear that “the right, title or interest of the Crown” in or to any land is not affected by any <b>adverse</b> <b>possessor.</b> It is against the background that the Court considered the right of an <b>adverse</b> <b>possessor</b> to a Crown lease...|$|E
40|$|The {{doctrine}} of adverse possession, {{as most people}} know, operates to extinguish the owner’s title to land once a squatter has been in adverse possession of it for 12 years, and allows the <b>adverse</b> <b>possessor</b> or squatter to become the owner of that land.

40|$|The paper explores {{a problem}} thrown up by LRA 2002 Schedule 6 and the Act's {{provisions}} generally relating to changes concerning the law relating to adverse possession claims against registered titles. Under the LRA 2002 after 10 years adverse {{possession of a}} registered title a claimant for the same can apply to be registered as proprietor of the relevant land. The current registered owner is notified and is afforded the opportunity to object within certain time limits. If objection is made the <b>adverse</b> <b>possessor</b> applicant will only succeed in becoming the new registered proprietor on certain limited grounds. Due to the difficulty in succeeding the authors contend that de facto many adverse possessors of registered land do not bother applying to be registered and remain in adverse possession without making any application. This the authors contend indirectly revives the significance of possessory titles along with the issues relating to their usage, which ironically weakens the all important mirror principle the LRA 2002 was meant to strengthen. Empirical evidence {{is included in the}} paper which bears out the authors' contention in this regard. Law reform recommendations are then made so as to improve the relevant legal rules surrounding adverse possession claims against pre-existing registered titles...|$|E
