A single torpedo hit the ship, blowing {{out all the}} bulkheads, and killing seven of the crew. The surviving crewmen abandoned ship on four rafts, as U-255 surfaced and fired 20 shells at the ship, which sank after 20 minutes. U-255 questioned the survivors, gave them a course to land, and <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> enough food and water before leaving. The survivors landed at Moller Bay, Novaya Zemlya, two days later.|$|E
5|$|Greg Glienna did {{not come}} up with the surname Focker; Greg's {{character}} in the original film did not have a last name. The name was written into the script after Jim Carrey {{came up with the idea}} for the Focker surname during a creative session held before he abandoned the project. Once Meet the Parents was submitted for rating evaluation, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) questioned the surname Focker as possibly an expletive and, due to the repetitiveness of the surname throughout the film, the film was in danger of being rated R according to the Motion Picture Association of America film rating system. The filmmakers were <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> made up the name or if they can prove that such a name exists. The studio submitted to the MPAA a list of real people with the surname Focker which ensured that the film retained a PG-13 rating.|$|E

The majority, 68.5% of these women answered 'no' when their intention was 'maybe'. The other 39.3% answered that when they have said 'no' really meant 'yes'. The explanations in support of their answers were that they were fearful of being considered promiscuous. Some claimed they were inhibited about sex. Others answered that they intended to manipulate the male because they were angry, wanted him to become more aroused or more aggressive.|$|E

The French journalist wrote of the same event, relating that some of the hungry townspeople went out to collect shell-fish and were attacked by the English. A little French boy taken on the shore was brought to Grey of Wilton. When <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> enough food for a fortnight, the boy said he had heard the captains say the English would not take the town by famine or force for four or five months yet.

The NIH held a series of meetings in which proposals from different agencies were discussed. The proposal recommendation from the U.S. for the MSF was a combination of the NSF and NIH proposals. Jim Edwards of NSF supported databases and data-sharing in the area of biodiversity; Koslow proposed the HPG as a model for sharing neuroscientific data, with the new moniker of neuroinformatics.|$|E
25|$|Regional {{studies found}} a {{different}} prevalence {{of sexual harassment}} by teachers.

Furthermore, more than 33% said that they knew of a sexual relationship between a high school student and a teacher.|$|E
25|$|Not all {{procedures}} {{before the}} Hof had an adversarial character. The Hof could act as arbiter {{in cases of}} voluntary arbitration {{at the request of}} parties. Also, in a number of cases there was just one party, without an adversary, who needed a particular judicial or executive action performed. Examples of the latter were the conveyancing of titles of real estate, both voluntary (in case of sale) and involuntary (in case of foreclosure). The Hof acted then as Notary. Another example was the remissiebrief of people who had received a pardon in criminal cases. This remissiebrief was the certificate stating the pardon and this had to be endorsed (interineerd) by the Hof (after a procedure in which the validity of the pardon was tested, and the victims in the crime were <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been adequately indemnified by the pardoned criminal).|$|E

The boys and girls indicated that the behavior they experienced included pinching, grabbing, touching in a sexual manner. One fourth of the girls {{had been forced to}} kiss someone and 10% of both the girls and the boys reported having been forced against their wills to do something sexual other than kissing.

This time, respondents were <b>asked</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> ever attended a 12-step meeting for an alcohol problem {{in their lifetime}} (the question was not AA-specific). 1441 (3.4%) of respondents answered the question affirmatively.

In their discussion of the findings, Kaskautas et al. (2008) state that to study disengagement, only the disengaged and continued engagement should be utilized (pg. 270).|$|E
