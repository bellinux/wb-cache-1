5|$|The Mafia of Villalba was of {{relatively}} recent origin, {{as it did}} {{not go back to}} the 1860s, considered to be the period when the Mafia emerged around Palermo. It started as a form of private protection and {{has little to do with}} large estates <b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> many other rural areas where many mafiosi started as caretakers and lease-holders (gabelloto or bailiff) for absentee landlords.|$|E
5|$|In some {{countries}} the monarch had {{little control over}} lords, or required {{the construction of new}} castles to aid in securing the land so was unconcerned about granting permission– <b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> England {{in the aftermath of the}} Norman Conquest and the Holy Land during the Crusades. Switzerland is an extreme case of there being no state control over who built castles, and as a result there were 4,000 in the country. There are very few castles dated with certainty from the mid-9thcentury. Converted into a donjon around 950, Château de Doué-la-Fontaine in France is the oldest standing castle in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Like Williams, Smith {{knew the}} Mad Dogs would face {{an uphill battle}} {{attracting}} fans once the traditional American football season started. <b>As</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> Birmingham, Smith persuaded the CFL to let them play their late-season home games on Sundays to avoid competing against high school and Tennessee/Ole Miss football. It was to no avail; {{late in the season}} the Mad Dogs struggled to attract more than 10,000 people. Like Williams, Smith publicly blamed community apathy and media hostility for the lackluster attendance. The team went 9–9 in their only year.|$|E

5|$|Much {{like in the}} Ski Jumping World Cup, {{events are}} {{composed}} of usually one or two individual competitions (rarely three, <b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> both Vikersund and Planica during the 2016 season), with a qualification round before each one. If there are two competitions, qualification for the second one takes place on the same day. The limit of 40 places per competition still applies (unless a cancelled ski jumping competition is rescheduled to a flying hill), but unlike the Ski Flying World Championships, if an athlete fails to qualify for one competition they still {{have the opportunity to}} make a fresh start and qualify for the others. If the very last competition of a World Cup season takes place on a ski flying hill, only 30 athletes will participate, with neither an elimination process after the first round, nor a qualification round.|$|E
5|$|Some towns, such as York, {{suffered}} from Norman sacking during William's northern campaigns. Other towns saw the widespread demolition of houses {{to make room}} for new motte and bailey fortifications, <b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> Lincoln. The Norman invasion also brought significant economic changes {{with the arrival of the}} first Jews to English cities. WilliamI brought over wealthy Jews from the Rouen community in Normandy to settle in London, apparently to carry out financial services for the crown. In the years immediately after the invasion, a lot of wealth was drawn out of England in various ways by the Norman rulers and reinvested in Normandy, making William immensely wealthy as an individual ruler.|$|E
5|$|The 2008–09 NBA {{season was}} to be Bowen's last with the Spurs. Although he played in 80 regular season games, {{he was no longer}} a starter <b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> the {{previous}} seven San Antonio campaigns. His minutes were also greatly reduced (from 30+ to 18.9 per game), although his shooting numbers remained consistent. The Spurs went into the 2009 NBA Playoffs with a 54–28 record and as the third seed. With influential shooting guard Manu Ginóbili out injured, the Spurs got off to a bad start to the series and eventually lost 4–1 against the Dallas Mavericks, bowing out of the playoffs in the first round {{for the first time since}} 2000.|$|E

5|$|The NDCC {{also called}} for the {{evacuation}} of persons in potentially affected areas. Large-scale evacuations took place in Real, Quezon ahead of the approaching typhoon. According to the NDCC, 97,238persons were evacuated in the lead-up to Nanmadol's Luzon landfall, with nearly 40,000 evacuating from the Bicol Region. However, the Office of Civil Defense documented the evacuation of approximately 168,000civilians. Government shelters initially made to house displaced residents due to previous storms were adjusted to accommodate additional refugees evacuating due to the typhoon. In Catanduanes, 1,500persons evacuated to these shelters. Other evacuees sought refuge in well-constructed buildings, <b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> Mercedes, Eastern Samar, where 2,000civilians stayed inside a school.|$|E
5|$|The main tournament {{combined}} {{elements of}} both previous WBC editions. The first round was split all teams into fourpools, where the teams competed in a round-robin, <b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> the 2006 tournament. The second round used the same modified double-elimination format as used in the 2009 tournament and the 2013 qualifying tournament. The final round was contested {{in the same manner}} as both previous tournaments: the top two teams from each group in the second round qualifying for the two semi-final matches, the winners of which played in the championship game.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> Boston, Lee Smith's {{first game}} with St. Louis went poorly as {{he gave up}} two runs in his only inning of pitching. He {{recovered}} quickly, registered a 0.00 ERA for the entire month of July, and finished his partial season with St. Louis with a 2.10 ERA and 27 saves. The Cardinals, however, were at a low point in 1990, finishing in last place for the only time since 1918. In 1991, St. Louis righted their ship, and Smith accumulated saves at a record pace. With his salary roughly doubled to nearly $2.8 million, Smith reached 40 saves {{for the first time}} in his career. On September 28, he picked up save number 45 to tie Bruce Sutter's National League record from 1984 (Coincidentally, when Sutter and Smith reached 45 saves in their respective seasons, both were ex-Cubs pitching for St. Louis against the Cubs). Smith claimed the league record for himself three days later and finished the season with a career-high 47 saves. One difference for him in 1991 was walks as he surrendered only 1.60 walks per nine innings, by far the best in his career to that point. Smith won his first Rolaids Relief Award, received the most significant consideration for league MVP in his career, and finished second in Cy Young Award voting behind only Tom Glavine, who had a breakout 20-win season in 1991.|$|E

5|$|Between 2015 and 2017, {{upgrades}} from K185 to K200 {{were also}} completed in Kulm, Planica, and Oberstdorf. All are now equipped for jumps exceeding 240m (previous hill records were broken at each opening event), {{as well as}} having improved facilities for athletes and spectators; Harrachov remains the only hill (at K185) to have not been upgraded since the 1990s. Although the new hills are much larger than ever before, most of them feature longer and less steeply angled slopes, designed purely for the V-style and {{with the knowledge of}} 80 years' worth of world record progression. Inrun tables have also been placed further back from the knoll and flight curves made shallower in order to allow athletes to glide more efficiently along the contour of the slope. This has significantly reduced such precarious heights over the knoll <b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> the early 1990s and prior: in that era, athletes using the parallel style would jump in a more upward trajectory off the table, reaching vast heights but at the expense of distance. Furthermore, rather than glide, they instead plummeted towards the slope. However, Planica remains extremely steep in the flight phase; Vikersund, by comparison, has a longer slope and does not enable as much height over the knoll.|$|E
5|$|Bouldering {{can damage}} {{vegetation}} that grows on rocks, such as mosses and lichens. This can {{occur as a}} result of the climber intentionally cleaning the boulder, or unintentionally from repeated use of handholds and footholds. Vegetation on the ground surrounding the boulder can also be damaged from overuse, particularly by climbers laying down crash pads. Soil erosion can occur when boulderers trample vegetation while hiking off of established trails, or when they unearth small rocks near the boulder in an effort to make the landing zone safer. The repeated use of white climbing chalk can damage the rock surface of boulders and cliffs, particularly sandstone and other porous rock types, and the scrubbing of rocks to remove chalk can also degrade the rock surface. Other environmental concerns include littering, improperly disposed feces, and graffiti. These issues have caused some land managers to prohibit bouldering, <b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> Tea Garden, a popular bouldering area in Rocklands, South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Entering the 2003–04 season, Arsenal were {{determined}} to reclaim the Premier League crown. Henry was again instrumental in Arsenal's exceptionally successful campaign; together {{with the likes of}} Dennis Bergkamp, Patrick Vieira, Freddie Ljungberg and Robert Pirès, Henry ensured that the Gunners became the first team in more than a century to go through the entire domestic league season unbeaten, claiming the league title in the process. Apart from being named for the second year running as the PFA Players' Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year, Henry emerged once again as the runner-up for 2004 FIFA World Player of the Year award. With 39 goals scored in all competitions, the Frenchman led the league in goals scored and won the European Golden Boot. However, <b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> 2002, Henry was unable to lead the national side to honours during UEFA Euro 2004.|$|E

5|$|The WHL {{folded in}} 1926, and its assets were {{bought by the}} NHL. This left the NHL as the only league left {{competing}} for the Cup. Other leagues and clubs have issued challenges, but from that year forward, no non-NHL team has played for it, leading it to become the de facto championship trophy of the NHL. In 1947, the NHL reached an agreement with trustees P. D. Ross and Cooper Smeaton to grant control of the cup to the NHL, allowing the league itself to reject challenges from other leagues that may have wished {{to play for the}} Cup. A 2006 Ontario Superior Court case found that the trustees had gone against Lord Stanley's conditions in the 1947 agreement.

5|$|The {{conquest of}} the {{highlands}} was made difficult by the many independent polities in the region, rather than one powerful enemy to be defeated <b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> central Mexico. After the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan fell to the Spanish in 1521, the Kaqchikel Maya of Iximche sent envoys to Hernán Cortés to declare their allegiance to the new ruler of Mexico, and the K'iche' Maya of Q'umarkaj may also have sent a delegation. In 1522 Cortés sent Mexican allies to scout the Soconusco region of lowland Chiapas, where they met new delegations from Iximche and Q'umarkaj at Tuxpán; both of the powerful highland Maya kingdoms declared their loyalty to the king of Spain. But Cortés' allies in Soconusco soon informed him that the K'iche' and the Kaqchikel were not loyal, and were instead harassing Spain's allies in the region. Cortés decided to despatch Pedro de Alvarado with 180 cavalry, 300 infantry, crossbows, muskets, 4 cannons, large amounts of ammunition and gunpowder, and thousands of allied Mexican warriors from Tlaxcala, Cholula and other cities in central Mexico; they arrived in Soconusco in 1523. Pedro de Alvarado was infamous for the massacre of Aztec nobles in Tenochtitlan and, according to Bartolomé de las Casas, he committed further atrocities in the {{conquest of the}} Maya kingdoms in Guatemala. Some groups remained loyal to the Spanish once they had submitted to the conquest, such as the Tz'utujil and the K'iche' of Quetzaltenango, and provided them with warriors to assist further conquest. Other groups soon rebelled however, and by 1526 numerous rebellions had engulfed the highlands.|$|E
5|$|The {{large number}} of {{instruments}} that some bands rely on in recording their studio albums can be a hindrance for live performances. While Orphaned Land are able to perform onstage with twenty musicians in their homeland of Israel, they {{have to rely on}} a computer to replicate the roles of the guest musicians for concerts elsewhere. Some folk metal acts confine themselves to studio recordings and are not known to perform any live concerts. This includes Folkearth, and Falkenbach. Other folk metal bands expand their regular roster to include more musicians and consequently, {{it is not uncommon to}} find bands in the genre featuring six or more members in their line-up. Some of the sextets in the genre are Schandmaul, Cruachan, Korpiklaani, Turisas, and Midnattsol, while septets include Ithilien, Subway to Sally, In Extremo, and Lumsk. Both Silent Stream of Godless Elegy and Eluveitie boast eight members each while the line up of Mägo de Oz totals nine performers. Even when a band includes members dedicated to folk instruments, they might still rely on guest musicians to further enhance their sound. As an example, Lumsk added thirteen guest musicians to the band's seven members on their debut album Åsmund Frægdegjevar. At times, guest musicians are known to become full-fledged members of the band, <b>as</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> Skyforger and Turisas.|$|E

5|$|In 1993, the Patriots and {{new head}} coach Bill Parcells {{were looking to}} improve the quarterback spot on their roster. They signed Scott Secules, and {{attempted}} to sign Steve Beuerlein, but the latter deal did not happen. They also gave Hugh Millen permission to seek a trade. In April, Millen {{was traded to the}} Dallas Cowboys, and the Patriots chose Drew Bledsoe with the first pick in the 1993 NFL Draft. During the offseason, Carlson was released, leaving Secules, Zolak, Bledsoe, and Hodson to compete for the three spots on the roster. By the end of the preseason, Bledsoe had won the starting job and Hodson had been cut, with Secules as the backup and Zolak as the third-string quarterback. Zolak saw playing time in three games in 1993, and threw two incomplete passes. He became a restricted free agent in the offseason, but re-signed with the Patriots for three years. As Secules was released during preseason, Zolak was set as Bledsoe's backup as the 1994 season began. <b>As</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>in</b> the 1993 season, he did not make a starting appearance, as Bledsoe played the full 16 games, however Zolak did see action in every game, primarily as the holder for extra point and field goal attempts. Over the course of the season, he completed five of eight passes for 28yards in the two games in which he saw time at quarterback. The 1995 season was similar, with Bledsoe starting and Zolak backing him up. In September, Bledsoe separated his left shoulder in a game and sat out a week to heal, allowing Zolak to make his first start since 1992. On October 1, 1995, Zolak took the field against the Atlanta Falcons, and completed 24 of 45 passes for 252yards and a touchdown, though the Patriots lost the game, 3017. Although Bledsoe's doctors wanted him to sit out another week, he refused and played the next week's game against the Denver Broncos. This again relegated Zolak to the backup position, where he remained {{for the rest of the}} season. He finished the season with 28 completed passes in 49 attempts for 282yards, a touchdown, and a quarterback rating of 80.5.|$|E
