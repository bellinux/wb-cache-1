40|$|What factors {{determine}} countries' {{international trade}} relations? Recent theories {{point to the}} potential importance of domestic legal traditions. Countries' legal systems influence the enforcement of contracts. This {{has been shown to}} affect trade flows in common law and civil law countries. However, these two legal systems do not constitute the universe of legal traditions. Islamic law is an important and fundamentally distinct legal system that has been largely overlooked. In this article, we offer the first direct test of the effect of Islamic law on countries' trade relations. We find that, on average, levels of bilateral trade are lowest among Islamic law states, holding all else constant. This finding suggests that, contrary to conventional wisdom, shared institutions alone are insufficient to enhance trade flows. Instead, levels of bilateral trade depend critically on the quality of shared institutions. The importance of countries' legal systems for trade declines over time, possibly due to the increased role of international <b>arbitration</b> <b>bodies</b> and/or the standardization of international sales contracts...|$|R

In fact, there is considerable anecdotal evidence that GEMAP introduced an element of accountability into the bureaucracy that hadn't existed for over a generation.

However, the Johnson-Sirleaf government has also taken a pro-reform platform, so responsibility for this cultural (if not practical,) shift may never be known.|$|E
50|$|P.B. Potter {{suggests}} that personal, client and familial relationships (often called guanxi) override {{the concept of}} legal equality and justice in civil and economic relationships.

In some cases, strong feelings of localism cause local courts to refuse to cooperate in enforcing awards, even when the award has been made by an <b>arbitration</b> <b>body</b> in Beijing. However, this negative view of guanxi is not universal, Schramm and Taube argue that guanxi has personalistic systems of social relationships have positive elements in producing social capital and that personalistic norms can co-exist with impersonal legalistic ones.|$|E

40|$|The Chinese {{judicial}} system {{has long been}} criticized for its rampant local protectionism and corruption and its lack of protections for foreign parties. To avoid litigation in China, most foreign investors insist on arbitration clauses in their contract. But even if they win the arbitration, foreigners must return to the Chinese courts to enforce the arbitration awards. Western lawyers, scholars and business people have repeatedly criticized the Chinese courts for their unwillingness to enforce arbitration awards in favor of foreign investors in favor of Chinese parties. Over the last ten years, the Chinese Supreme People’s Court has attempted to address this dilemma by promulgating a series of regulations, including the 1995 Reporting Mechanism; the 1995 Judges Law; 1998 Regulations Regarding the Issues of Fees and Investigation Periods; and the 2003 Directive Limiting Jurisdiction over Arbitration Awards with Foreign Elements. Furthermore, the Chinese government has taken the unprecedented step of allowing Western educational programs within its borders to educate Chinese judges, attorneys and legal officials {{in order to improve}} judicial fairness for foreign investors. The Chinese government has also recently permitted domestic tribunals to accept foreign-related arbitral disputes, resulting in increased competition and quality among the arbitral bodies. In this paper I will briefly describe the history of arbitration in China and the current Chinese <b>arbitration</b> <b>bodies,</b> including the rapidly growing presence of domestic arbitral tribunals such as the Beijing Arbitration Commission (BAC). I will then describe the structural and procedural weaknesses in the Chinese {{judicial system}} which may lead to foreigners’ difficulty in collecting arbitration awards. I will describe the steps taken by the Chinese government, judicial system arbitral bodies, including CIETAC and BAC, in order to improve the climate for foreign businesses, as well as foreign parties’ attempts to assist in this process. I will evaluate the purported success of these efforts and the reasons why further documentation is needed for a more complete evaluation. Finally, I will propose further suggestions which would improve fairness within the Chinese judicial branch...|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis is the {{judicial}} review of arbitral awards in China. Chinese arbitration law provides a distinct set of rules for reviewing international and domestic awards, which is usually {{referred to as the}} dual-track system (“Shuang Gui Zhi”). First, the judicial review standard is dual-track because international awards are subject to procedural and limited review, whereas domestic awards are subject to substantial review. Second, the review procedure is also dual-track because a reporting mechanism under which the lower courts cannot deny an international award without confirmation by the Supreme People’s Court of China is applied to international awards but is not applied to domestic awards. The following question arises: Should the dual-track judicial review system for arbitral awards be harmonised into a single system, and if so, how should it be accomplished. This question has sparked heated debates among scholars and practitioners. It is important because appropriate and efficient judicial review of awards is essential to the functioning and development of the arbitration system in China. The research is based on the theory of path-dependent and institutional change. My consideration of the future of the dual-track system is centred on the wisdom of the original policy considerations behind the dual-track judicial review path, the solidity of the institutional foundations of the dual-track judicial review path and feedback on the dual-track system from judicial practice and the arbitration market. The research critically examined the policies and institutions behind the design of the dual-track judicial review and conducted an empirical study of the feedback of the design, which included a comprehensive review of various materials, cases and data relating to the subject. The thesis concluded that the dual-track review path should be reformed by harmonising the dual-track review standard while maintaining and revising the dual-track procedure. The dual-track review standard should be uniform, and the limited scope of procedural review should be applied to both domestic and international awards. Policy and institutional foundations have failed in the substantial review of domestic awards due to the disruption in boundaries between international business and Chinese domestic business, as well as a weakened distinction between international and domestic arbitration commissions. The case study and the survey provide further empirical evidence that supports my argument, which revealed that the dual-track standard causes chaos and abuse of law in judicial practice and has gained negative feedback from arbitration market participants. In contrast, the dual-track judicial review procedure should be maintained and revised. The study indicated that the reporting mechanism still acts as a positive force to control the outcome of reviews and secure proper and uniform application of the law. Despite its shortcomings, it still {{plays an important role in}} counteracting the negative effect of local protectionism and reinforces confidence of foreign investors in arbitration and within the legal infrastructure in China. Based on the above findings, the author proposed a new regulatory framework designed to be sufficiently flexible and current for meeting the practical requirements of arbitration, while considering suitable interaction between <b>arbitration</b> <b>bodies</b> and courts. Specifically, the thesis suggested that the Arbitration Law should be revised as a unitary and exclusive legal framework for regulating judicial review of arbitral awards, and for incorporating the rules of enforcement of arbitral awards specified in the Civil Procedural Law. Although separate regimes for domestic and international arbitration should be maintained, the criteria for differentiating various types of arbitral awards should be clarified and redefined. Finally, the thesis made several concrete suggestions for improving specific provisions of the law that govern judicial review of arbitral awards. published_or_final_versionLawDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

40|$|Territorial sea delimitation, {{while one}} of the most {{intensely}} debated issues prior to World War I, has largely been delegated to the sidelines of ocean and coastal law. Modem students of maritime delimitation mostly concern themselves with the delimitation of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and the continental shelf, and few, if any, significant diplomatic problems associated with territorial sea boundaries have been recorded in the last several decades. Indeed, while the literature on the delimitation of the EEZ and the continental shelf is abundant and readily available, questions concerning the territorial sea delimitation are seldom raised. The reasons for these phenomena are not overly surprising. Primarily, in the last twenty-five years there have been few important judicial or arbitration case on the territorial sea delimitation. Instead, the period has been dominated by instances of negotiated territorial sea delimitation between the concerned parties. Also, delimitation of the territorial sea is a relatively simple affair, at least when compared to the EEZ or continental shelf delimitation. The modest twelve mile width of the territorial sea, {{and the fact that the}} distorting effects of equidistance lines are 2 ̆ 2 comparatively small within the limits of territorial waters, 2 ̆ 2 both allow for a relatively smooth process. Finally, the EEZ and the continental shelf delimitation is largely governed by the customary law that, as courts have defined it, is based on the rule of equitable principles and equitable solution. The territorial sea delimitation, on the other hand, is governed by the equidistance and the special circumstances rule which is embodied in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC), and has been accepted without much controversy since the first territorial sea convention. Since the break up of the Soviet Union and the former Yugoslavia, however, there has been a dramatic rise of instances involving the need for the delimitation of territorial seas. The questions regarding such delimitation have emerged largely due to the fact that although land boundaries between the republics of these federal states were firmly established in most cases, delimitation was never carried out at sea. Problems regarding the delimitation of the territorial seas within the former Soviet Union have arisen in the Baltic, the Black Sea, as well as the Caspian Sea. Nonethe less, despite of its relatively small size, the former Yugoslavia has produced some of the most contested territorial sea delimitation problems in recent history. Croatia, in particular, having the longest coastline of all the former Yugoslav republics, has contested its territorial seas with all of its former republican neighbors-Bosnia, Slovenia, and Serbia-Montenegro. While the Croatian dispute with Bosnia was largely solved in 1999, and the boundary negotiations with Serbia-Montenegro have been restarted in recent months, Croatia 2 ̆ 7 s maritime dispute with Slovenia in the Bay of Piran and further in the Bay of Trieste has been the most controversial bilateral issue between the two countries ever since their independence in 1991. Despite the increased activity aimed at resolving this problem in the past three years, which included an agreement between the two countries 2 ̆ 7 prime ministers, a solution is not in sight. Unless a negotiated solution satisfactory to both countries is reached soon, the issue will probably have to be submitted to an international judicial or <b>arbitration</b> <b>body.</b> This article makes a contribution by offering a detailed study of this unusual case of the territorial sea delimitation, and by proposing several solutions for solving this problem through friendly, bilateral negotiations in order to avoid a costly and protracted dispute before an independent third body, an option that, as will be shown, would not benefit the interests of either country...|$|E
