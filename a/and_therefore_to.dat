In the end it was a promise that he was unable to keep after his search for alternative landing grounds proved fruitless. With his only other option being to return home, he set up his headquarters at Cape Royds, close to the old Discovery base. For this he was roundly condemned by the British polar establishment at the time.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a variety}} of end uses to weather forecasts. Weather {{warnings}} are important forecasts because they are used to protect life and property. Forecasts based on temperature and precipitation are important to agriculture, <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>to</b> traders within commodity markets. Temperature forecasts are used by utility companies to estimate demand over coming days. On an everyday basis, people use weather forecasts to determine what to wear on a given day. Since outdoor activities are severely curtailed by heavy rain, snow and wind chill, forecasts can be used to plan activities around these events, and to plan ahead and survive them. In 2014, the US spent $5.1 billion on weather forecasting.|$|E

25|$|These {{distributions}} {{represent the}} spectral radiance of blackbodies—the power emitted from the emitting surface, per unit projected area of emitting surface, per unit solid angle, per spectral unit (frequency, wavelength, wavenumber or their angular equivalents).

25|$|During the {{dehydration}} process moisture is evaporating {{from the}} feces and microbes are degrading the organic material.

25|$|The {{remnants}} of the IRA, which had split several times into ever smaller groupings since 1922, embarked on a bombing campaign in Britain (see Sabotage Campaign (IRA)) and some attacks in Northern Ireland (see Northern Campaign), intended to force a British withdrawal from Northern Ireland. Some of its leadership, notably Seán Russell, sought help from Nazi Germany for this project. De Valera, considering this activity a threat to Irish neutrality <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>to</b> the state's vital interests, interned all active IRA members and executed several.

25|$|The {{state of}} the ball affects {{deliveries}} for a batsman. Even a new cricket ball is not perfectly spherical, but in two parts stitched {{together to form a}} seam. How a ball moves depends in part on how much air resistance there is to different parts of the ball, <b>and</b> <b>therefore</b> <b>to</b> what degree the ball has deteriorated. A cricket team will normally seek, for example, to polish one side of the ball and rough up the other side. The resulting variation in air resistance on the ball can have a marked effect.|$|E

25|$|These unique {{relations}} between Protestantism and Islam mainly {{took place during}} the 16th and 17th century.

Progressively however, Protestantism became able to consolidate itself and became less dependent on external help. At the same time, the power of the Ottoman Empire waned from its 16th century peak, making attempts at alliance and conciliation less relevant.|$|E
