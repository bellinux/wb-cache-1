The bad meteorological conditions on the day (which included clouds, moderate to heavy winds, with turbulence) and the lack of autonomous navigational aids aboard the aircraft (such as GPS), that could have determined their position, were also factors that contributed to the accident.

50|$|Only {{three of}} the NTSB's four board members signed the final report. Kay Bailey, who signed the final report, added a concurring {{statement}} which reiterated the board's previous recommendations for improved real-time weather dissemination. Francis H. McAdams, {{one of the four}} NTSB members, dissented with the other members and filed the following probable cause in the same report:the probable cause of this accident was the captain's decision to penetrate rather than avoid an area of severe weather, the failure to obtain all the available weather information despite having knowledge of the severity of the storm system, and the reliance upon <b>airborne</b> <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> for penetration rather than avoidance of the storm system. The penetration resulted in a total loss of thrust from both engines due to the ingestion of massive amounts of water and hail which in combination with advanced throttle settings induced severe stalling in, and major damage to, the engine compressors, which prevented the crew from restarting the engines. Furthermore, if the company's dispatching system had provided the flight crew with timely severe weather information pertaining to the aircraft's intended route of flight, {{it is possible that the}} severe weather would not have been penetrated.|$|E
50|$|Unlike ground weather radar, {{which is}} set at a fixed angle, <b>airborne</b> <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> is being {{utilized}} from the nose or wing of an aircraft. Not only will the aircraft be moving up, down, left, and right, {{but it will be}} rolling as well. To compensate for this, the antenna is linked and calibrated to the vertical gyro located on the aircraft. By doing this, the pilot is able to set a pitch or angle to the antenna that will enable the stabilizer to keep the antenna pointed in the right direction under moderate maneuvers. The small servo motors {{will not be able to}} keep up with abrupt maneuvers, but it will try. In doing this the pilot is able to adjust the radar so that it will point towards the weather system of interest. If the airplane is at a low altitude, the pilot would want to set the radar above the horizon line so that ground clutter is minimized on the display. If the airplane is at a very high altitude, the pilot will set the radar at a low or negative angle, to point the radar towards the clouds wherever they may be relative to the aircraft. If the airplane changes attitude, the stabilizer will adjust itself accordingly so that the pilot doesn't have to fly with one hand and adjust the radar with the other.|$|E
40|$|Emerging {{technologies}} such as wireless local area networks and cellular telephones have dramatically increased the use of wireless communications services within the last 10 years. The shortage of available spectrum exists due to increasing demand for wireless services and current spectrum allocation regulations. To alleviate this shortage, Research aims to improve spectral efficiency and to allow spectrum sharing between separately managed and non-coordinating communications systems. This thesis explores the feasibility of spectrum sharing between <b>airborne</b> <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> and wireless local area networks at 9. 3 GHz – 9. 5 GHz. Characteristics of flight paths of aircraft using <b>airborne</b> <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> and the low duty cycle of radar transmissions offer unique opportunities for spectrum sharing. But {{it was found that}} the extremely sensitive receivers provide challenges for designing a communications system meant for widespread use. The probability of causing harmful interference to <b>airborne</b> <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> is too great for most types of wireless local area networks, but a direct sequence spread spectrum scheme could share spectrum with <b>airborne</b> <b>weather</b> <b>radar.</b> Bit errors in wireless local area network links caused by <b>airborne</b> <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> interference do not significantly decrease the performance of the wireless local area network system. The distribution of interference outside of the <b>airborne</b> <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> receiver by using direct sequence spread spectrum combined with the acceptable bit error rates indicate that while spectrum sharing between <b>airborne</b> <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> and wireless local area network at 9. 3 GHz – 9. 5 GHz is not feasible, direct sequence spread spectrum systems can share spectrum with airborne weather radars under more limited assumptions...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of {{atmospheric}} refraction, affected by temperature, atmospheric pressure, and humidity, on <b>airborne</b> <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> beam paths. Using three types of typical atmospheric background sounding data, we established a simulation model for an actual transmission path and a fitted correction path of an <b>airborne</b> <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> beam during airplane take-offs and landings based on initial flight parameters and X-band airborne phased-array weather radar parameters. Errors in an ideal electromagnetic beam propagation path are much greater than those of a fitted path when atmospheric refraction is not considered. The rates {{of change in the}} atmospheric refraction index differ with weather conditions and the radar detection angles differ during airplane take-off and landing. Therefore, the airborne radar detection path must be revised in real time according to the specific sounding data and flight parameters. However, an error analysis indicates that a direct linear-fitting method produces significant errors in a negatively refractive atmosphere; a piecewise-fitting method can be adopted to revise the paths according to the actual atmospheric structure. This study provides researchers and practitioners in the aeronautics and astronautics field with updated information regarding {{the effect of}} atmospheric refraction on <b>airborne</b> <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> detection and correction methods...|$|E

These were made with ground-based and <b>airborne</b> <b>weather</b> <b>radars</b> at nearly vertical incidence. A sharp decrease of I p,,,(O) I occurs at the bright band bottom, and is attributed to a varying mixture of hydrometeors with diverse shape, size, and thermodynamic phase.

40|$|Results from {{airborne}} field deployments {{emphasized the}} need to obtain concurrently high temporal and spatial resolution measurements of 3 -D winds and microphysics. A phased array radar on an airborne platform using dual-polarization antenna {{has the potential for}} retrieving high-resolution, collocated 3 -D winds and microphysical measurements. Recently, ground-based phased array radar (PAR) has demonstrated the high time-resolution estimation of accurate Doppler velocity and reflectivity of precipitation and clouds when compared to mechanically scanning radar. PAR uses the electronic scanning (e-scan) to rapidly collect radar measurements. Since an airborne radar has a limited amount of time to collect measurements over a specified sample volume, the e-scan will significantly enhance temporal and spatial resolution of airborne radar observations. At present, <b>airborne</b> <b>weather</b> <b>radars</b> use mechanical scans, and they are not designed for collecting dual-polarization measurements to remotely estimate microphysics. This paper presents a possible configuration of a novel airborne phased array radar (APAR) to be installed on an aircraft for retrieving improved dynamical and microphysical scientific products. The proposed APAR would replace the aging, X-band Electra Doppler radar (ELDORA). The ELDORA X-band radar's penetration into precipitation is limited by attenuation. Since attenuation at C-band is lower than at X-band, the design specification of a C-band airborne phased array radar (APAR) and its measurement accuracies are presented. Preliminary design specifications suggest the proposed APAR will meet or exceed ELDORA's current sensitivity, spatial resolution and Doppler measurement accuracies of ELDORA and it will also acquire dual-polarization measurements...|$|R
40|$|High {{resolution}} windspeed profile {{measurements are}} needed to provide reliable detection of hazardous low altitude windshear with an airborne pulse Doppler radar. The system phase noise in a Doppler <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> may degrade the spectrum moment estimation quality and the clutter cancellation capability which are important in windshear detection. Also the bias due to weather return Doppler spectrum skewness may cause large errors in pulse pair spectral parameter estimates. These effects are analyzed {{for the improvement of}} an <b>airborne</b> Doppler <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> signal processing design. A method is presented for the direct measurement of windspeed gradient using low pulse repetition frequency (PRF) radar. This spatial gradient is essential in obtaining the windshear hazard index. As an alternative, the modified Prony method is suggested as a spectrum mode estimator for both the clutter and weather signal. Estimation of Doppler spectrum modes may provide the desired windshear hazard information without the need of any preliminary processing requirement such as clutter filtering. The results obtained by processing a NASA simulation model output support consideration of mode identification as one component of a windshear detection algorithm...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} {{significant}} airplane accidents have resulted from windshear encounters during takeoff or landing. In these situations the radar signal received may be affected by a strong ground clutter that may make the conventional windshear detection algorithms implemented on ground-based systems unusable. Typically, {{the solution to this}} problem is to employ a clutter rejection filter and then process the filter output to derive weather information. In this study, a parametric bimodal spectral model of the raw radar signal from an <b>airborne</b> Doppler <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> is proposed. The bimodal shape of the model has been defined as a superposition of clutter and windshear. The model can be used to define a windshear detection algorithm that can also directly estimate the physical weather parameters by using the estimated model parameters without using a clutter rejection pre-filter. Owing to the impossibility of testing a windshear detection system in a realistic environment, a simulated windshear data base has been developed by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) during their windshear research programme. The {{purpose of this study is}} to define a parametric bimodal spectral model and demonstrate its validity on the NASA-FAA windshear certification data set...|$|R
40|$|An optimum {{adaptive}} {{clutter rejection}} filter {{for use with}} <b>airborne</b> Doppler <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> is presented. The radar system is being designed to operate at low-altitudes {{for the detection of}} windshear in an airport terminal area where ground clutter returns may mask the weather return. The coefficients of the adaptive clutter rejection filter are obtained using a complex form of a square root normalized recursive least squares lattice estimation algorithm which models the clutter return data as an autoregressive process. The normalized lattice structure implementation of the adaptive modeling process for determining the filter coefficients assures that the resulting coefficients will yield a stable filter and offers possible fixed point implementation. A 10 th order FIR clutter rejection filter indexed by geographical location is designed through autoregressive modeling of simulated clutter data. Filtered data, containing simulated dry microburst and clutter return, are analyzed using pulse-pair estimation techniques. To measure the ability of the clutter rejection filters to remove the clutter, results are compared to pulse-pair estimates of windspeed within a simulated dry microburst without clutter. In the filter evaluation process, post-filtered pulse-pair width estimates and power levels are also used to measure the effectiveness of the filters. The results support the use of an adaptive clutter rejection filter for reducing the clutter induced bias in pulse-pair estimates of windspeed...|$|R

40|$|The Bendix RDR- 4 B <b>airborne</b> <b>weather</b> <b>radar,</b> {{developed}} by Allied Signal Commercial Avionic Systems, {{is the product}} of a decade-long Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) /NASA/industry/academia research program.

40|$|The {{increased}} role of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in NASA's suborbital {{program has}} created {{a strong interest in}} the development of instruments with new capabilities, more compact sizes and reduced weights than the instruments currently operated on manned aircrafts. There is a strong demand and tremendous potential for using high altitude UAV (HUAV) to carry <b>weather</b> <b>radars</b> for measurements of reflectivity and wind fields from tropical storms. Tropical storm genesis frequently occurs in ocean regions that are inaccessible to piloted aircraft due to the long off shore range and the required periods of time to gather significant data. Important factors of interest for the study of hurricane genesis include surface winds, profiled winds, sea surface temperatures, precipitation, and boundary layer conditions. Current satellite precipitation and surface wind sensors have resolutions that are too large and revisit times that are too infrequent to study this problem. Furthermore, none of the spaceborne sensors measure winds within the storm itself. A dual beam X-band Doppler radar, UAV Radar (URAD), is under development at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center for the study of tropical storms from HUAV platforms, such as a Global Hawk. X-band is the most desirable frequency for <b>airborne</b> <b>weather</b> <b>radars</b> since these can be built in a relatively compact size using off-the-shelf components which cost significantly less than other higher frequency radars. Furthermore, X-band radars provide good sensitivity with tolerable attenuation in storms. The low-cost and light-weight URAD will provide new capabilities for studying hurricane genesis by analyzing the vertical structure of tropical cyclones as well as 3 D reflectivity and wind fields in clouds. It will enable us to measure both the 3 D precipitation structure and surface winds by using two antenna beams: fixed nadir and conical scanning each produced by its associated subsystem. The nadir subsystem is a magnetron based radar modified from a marine radar transceiver. It is capable of measuring vertical reflectivity and velocity profile while being a lower-cost, smaller size, and lighter weight version of the NASA ER- 2 Doppler Radar (EDOP), which has flown during many NASA field campaigns and has provided valuable scientific information on hurricanes and weather phenomena. Unfortunately, EDOP is too large and heavy for most UAV platforms, but the experience gained with this instrument provided us with the heritage to build a new low-cost, light-weight, smaller system that will be capable of flying on UAVs. The scanning subsystem uses a TWT transmitter and provides measurements of 3 D reflectivity/wind fields in-clouds. Conical scanning of the radar beam at a 35 deg. incidence angle will also provide information of surface wind speed and direction derived from the surface return over a single 360 deg. sweep. URAD data system will be Linux based with the capability of autonomous operation. It will utilize cutting edge digital receiver and FPGA technologies to carry out the data acquisition and processing tasks. High speed navigation data from the aircraft will also be captured and saved along with radar data for 3 D measurement field reconstruction and aircraft motion correction. There is a tremendous potential for UAVs to carry down-looking <b>weather</b> <b>radars</b> for measurements of reflectivity, horizontal and vertical winds from tropical storms. With operation from HUAV platforms, the dual beam X-band radar under development promises to provide greatly needed information for tropical storm research...|$|R

40|$|Array antennas have a {{wide range}} of {{applications}} which includes ground and <b>airborne</b> <b>radar,</b> <b>weather</b> <b>radar</b> and anti-collision radar. In addition, equally important applications exist for communications, both on earth and to satellites in space, as well as for medical applications such as the detection and treatment of tumors. The modern trend in array design is to use digital beamforming and to integrate the antennas {{with the rest of the}} system more closely. This adds new possibilities, but also contributes to make the system expensive. To make full use of the new technology, this thesis presents a direction dependent signal processing array calibration method. The new method, called local calibration, also allows for larger array imperfections and, possibly, a lower overall array cost. In contrast to other non-parametric calibration methods, the proposed method can handle position errors and shows good performance also for sparse calibration grids, which is demonstrated by high resolution direction of arrival estimation. The local calibration has also been included in a convex beampattern optimization, which makes it possible to achieve a uniform sidelobe level also with unknown sensor position errors in the array. The embedded element pattern is included in the optimization by extracting the direction dependence of the received power from the calibration. Another application for the local calibration method is to reduce the number of necessary calibration measurements by calculating pseudo calibration data from a sparse grid of measured calibration data. Array signal processing is often performed assuming Uniform Linear Arrays (ULAs), although this model is far too simple to reveal the true behavior of array antennas. Throughout this thesis, more realistic models including mutual coupling and array imperfections are used. Specifically, the impact of mutual coupling and position errors on the adaptive beamforming performance in linear and circular arrays is studied. In the studied cases, the circular array is found to be more sensitive to neglecting the mutual coupling. Robust adaptive methods are commonly used to handle model uncertainties, such as unknown mutual coupling, but even better performance can be achieved if these methods are combined with a calibration...|$|R
