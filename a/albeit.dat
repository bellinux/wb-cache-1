5|$|In {{classical}} Athens, female prostitution was legal, <b>albeit</b> disreputable, {{and prostitution}} was taxed.|$|E
5|$|A further {{permanent}} memorial, <b>albeit</b> {{not publicly}} accessible, was created inside the Operations Center at Zurich Airport where a simple plaque {{on the ground}} floor in the centre opening of a spiral staircase pays tribute to the victims.|$|E
5|$|If {{the planet}} transits the star {{as seen from}} our direction, the radius should be measurable, <b>albeit</b> with some uncertainty. Unfortunately, {{measurements}} made with the Canadian-built MOST space telescope indicate that transits do not occur.|$|E
5|$|In 1875, a {{detailed}} {{list of all}} passengers and crew was published by J.H. Lewis, Printer & Publisher, <b>albeit</b> with several errors and spelling mistakes. That document {{was used as the}} main source of the following survivors' table.|$|E
5|$|It is {{intended}} primarily for short-range service, although British Airways uses the aircraft on a London City Airport to New York-JFK Airport transatlantic route (<b>albeit</b> with a stopover in Shannon for refueling on the westbound leg).|$|E
5|$|Lansbury {{described}} {{herself as}} an actress who could also sing, with Sondheim stating {{that she had a}} strong voice, <b>albeit</b> with a limited range.|$|E
5|$|Neon is monatomic, {{making it}} {{lighter than the}} {{molecules}} of diatomic nitrogen and oxygen which form the bulk of Earth's atmosphere; a balloon filled with neon will rise in air, <b>albeit</b> more slowly than a helium balloon.|$|E
5|$|Of the 38 {{original}} {{members of}} the Coronation Class, only the following three locomotives have been preserved, <b>albeit</b> in very different ways.|$|E
5|$|On December 6 and 7, {{the same}} COBOL program (<b>albeit</b> with minor changes) ran on an RCA {{computer}} and a Remington-Rand Univac computer, demonstrating that compatibility could be achieved.|$|E
5|$|The {{collection}} was first {{opened to the}} public in the late 18th century, <b>albeit</b> rather reluctantly, by Grand Duke Leopold, Tuscany's first enlightened ruler, keen to obtain popularity after the demise of the Medici.|$|E
5|$|Tiberius's {{land reform}} {{commission}} continued distributing lands, <b>albeit</b> much slower than Tiberius had envisaged, as Senators {{were able to}} eliminate more of its supporters by legal means.|$|E
5|$|A complex {{junction}} {{has been}} built north of St Pancras with connections to the East Coast Main Line, North London Line (for West Coast Main Line) and Midland Main Line, allowing {{for a wide variety}} of potential destinations <b>albeit</b> on conventional rails. As part of the works, tunnels connecting the East Coast Main Line to the Thameslink route were also built in readiness for the forthcoming Thameslink Programme.|$|E
5|$|A model vaguely {{based on}} Glastonbury Tor (<b>albeit</b> with a tree {{instead of the}} tower) was {{incorporated}} into the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. As the athletes entered the stadium, their flags were displayed on the terraces of the model.|$|E
5|$|A {{special edition}} jersey {{was used for}} the 2014 Heritage Classic against the Vancouver Canucks on March 2, 2014. The jersey shares {{virtually}} the same characteristics as their current third jersey, <b>albeit</b> reversed so that cream is the primary colour.|$|E
5|$|After {{assembly}} elections {{across the}} country in 1967, the party entered into a coalition with several other parties, including the Swatantra Party and the socialists. It formed governments in various states across the Hindi heartland, including Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. It {{was the first time the}} Jana Sangh held political office, <b>albeit</b> within a coalition; this caused the shelving of the Jana Sangh's more radical agenda.|$|E
5|$|After {{the winning}} debut and {{subsequent}} {{withdrawal of the}} BT46B “fan car” at the Swedish Grand Prix (see below) the Brabham team completed the season with the standard BT46s. Niki Lauda winning the Italian Grand Prix in the standard car, <b>albeit</b> after Mario Andretti and Gilles Villeneuve were penalised a minute for jumping the second race start after Ronnie Peterson’s fatal accident at the first start.|$|E
5|$|After unsuccessfully {{shopping}} {{the album}} to record companies, Chesnutt released it {{himself on his}} website in September 2002 before releasing it on September 24 through his own label Ready, Set, Go!. The album charted for one week on the Billboard 200 and had sold 25,000 copies by March 30, 2003, according to Nielsen SoundScan. The Headphone Masterpiece was well received by music critics, who found it musically adventurous, <b>albeit</b> indulgent.|$|E
5|$|Alongside {{the medieval}} masonry, Briggs' {{alterations}} {{can still be}} seen today (<b>albeit</b> in ruins). Briggs' son, Colonel Charles James Briggs (father of Sir Charles James Briggs) inherited the castle in 1871 and built the nearby St Margaret's church (now demolished).|$|E
5|$|Although the Gospel of John is anonymous, Christian {{tradition}} {{historically has}} attributed it to John the Apostle, son of Zebedee {{and one of}} Jesus' Twelve Apostles. The gospel is so closely related in style and content to the three surviving Johannine epistles that commentators treat the four books, along with the Book of Revelation, as a single corpus of Johannine literature, <b>albeit</b> not necessarily written by the same author.|$|E
5|$|Apologists for the OCA's autocephaly {{claim that}} the decree did not need the {{approval}} of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, as it was an internal matter for the Russian Orthodox Church to decide. Many autocephalous churches, the Russian Church included, were not recognized as such for many years, <b>albeit</b> their autocephaly was granted by the Ecumenical Patriarchate.|$|E
5|$|As a {{technology}} showcase, Valve considered Lost Coast {{to have very}} demanding system requirements. The game runs on computers with specifications lower than what is recommended, <b>albeit</b> without some key features such as high dynamic range. If a non-high-dynamic-range-capable card is used, the developer commentary is changed slightly to reflect this. For example, Valve president Gabe Newell would describe the effects that are seen in a different manner.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 15, {{he enlisted}} in the Royal Navy at the naval station in nearby Minard Inlet, {{possibly}} after an argument with his father. His enlistment as a boy second class is recorded in Royal Navy records on 10 July 1893 at age 16, <b>albeit</b> without his parents' consent.|$|E
5|$|Australia took a first innings lead of 134 and Davidson removed Subba Row and Barrington {{with the}} new ball in the second innings to end with 2/50 and help set up a five wicket victory. Davidson was at the crease when the winning runs were scored, <b>albeit</b> at the non-striker's end. It {{was the first time}} Davidson had tasted Test victory on English soil in three tours.|$|E
5|$|Bowie had {{originally}} {{planned to take}} the Glass Spider Tour to Russia, <b>albeit</b> with the band only (no dancers or elaborate props), but with the money and extra stage provided by the sponsorship, Bowie felt he could take the full tour to Russia and South America. However, these plans failed to come to fruition, and the tour never reached those regions.|$|E
5|$|By chewing the tap {{and lateral}} roots of trees, {{caterpillars}} {{feed on the}} cambium growth, produced by the tree {{at the site of}} the injury. The larvae may girdle a root, thereby causing its death, or the lesions may be only partial, allowing the root to continue functioning, <b>albeit</b> with some deformity.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 15th century central English {{authority}} in Ireland had all but disappeared and a renewed Irish culture and language, <b>albeit</b> with Norman influences, was dominant again. English Crown control remained relatively unshaken in an amorphous foothold around Dublin known as The Pale, and under the provisions of Poynings' Law of 1494, the Irish Parliamentary legislation was subject to the approval of the English Parliament.|$|E
5|$|City Sightseeing and Edinburgh Tours {{visit the}} Old Town, New Town, Calton Hill, Holyrood Palace and Edinburgh Castle, <b>albeit</b> on {{slightly}} differing routes. The Majestic Tour operates a long loop from Holyrood and New Town, via the Royal Botanic Garden, {{to the coast}} at Ocean Terminal, {{the site of the}} former Royal Yacht Britannia.|$|E
5|$|Concentrated {{solar power}} (CSP) also started to grow rapidly, {{increasing}} its capacity nearly tenfold from 2004 to 2013, <b>albeit</b> from {{a lower level}} and involving fewer countries than solar PV. As {{of the end of}} 2013, worldwide cumulative CSP-capacity reached 3,425MW.|$|E
5|$|Folk {{artists and}} singer-songwriters have always {{flourished in the}} Athens atmosphere, <b>albeit,</b> as mentioned, not as {{significantly}} as Pop and Rock. Some of Athens' most notable solo singer-songwriter performers are Vic Chesnutt, Nathan Sheppard, Corey Smith, John Berry, Patterson Hood, Ricky Fitzpatrick, along with younger, emerging musicians like Thayer Sarrano and T. Hardy Morris.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} Bristol Community Festival, {{other groups}} emerged hoping to {{continue}} {{with some sort of}} summer festival in Bristol. Bristol Music Festival became the Bristol Festival (now BrisFest) and has so far successfully put on four summer festivals, <b>albeit</b> in the city centre. 2011 saw the most successful even yet, with over 25,000 people attending over three days.|$|E
5|$|Heinrich {{also notes}} the {{possibility}} that national parliaments could appoint citizen representatives to the UNPA, similarly to how the U.S. Electoral College officially selects the President. This would be a stopgap solution until direct election became possible. Yet it would still ensure that citizens would be electing citizens (<b>albeit</b> indirectly), rather than the executive appointing officials, to the UNPA.|$|E
5|$|Herm has won Britain in Bloom {{categories}} several times: in 2002, 2008, and 2012, Herm won the Britain in Bloom Gold Award. The author, Compton Mackenzie, who was {{the island}} tenant 1920-23, represented it in Fairy Gold, <b>albeit</b> in a fictional representation.|$|E
5|$|However, it {{is better}} {{described}} as a non-contact force field having a finite range, <b>albeit</b> very short. In 1968, Sheldon Glashow, Abdus Salam and Steven Weinberg unified the electromagnetic force and the weak interaction by showing them to be two aspects of a single force, now termed the electro-weak force.|$|E
5|$|In 1889, Adams {{broke the}} world record run for {{successive}} straight rail points in a match with champion player Jacob Schaefer, Sr., in which Adams scored 4,962 counts in a row, which was 2,400 points more than any prior competition high run, <b>albeit</b> with his fingers rather than with a cue. Adams stated {{in an interview in}} his later years that his personal high run was 6,900 consecutive straight rail counts.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Dunstan became {{president}} of the State Labor Party. The year also saw the death of Opposition Leader Mick O'Halloran and his replacement by Frank Walsh. Dunstan attempted to win both the position of Opposition Leader and, failing that, Deputy Leader. However, the Labor caucus was sceptical of his age and inexperience, and he failed to gain either position, <b>albeit</b> narrowly.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Switzerland's {{population}} slightly exceeded eight million. In {{common with}} other developed countries, the Swiss population increased rapidly during the industrial era, quadrupling between 1800 and 1990. Growth has since stabilised, {{and like most}} of Europe, Switzerland faces an ageing population, <b>albeit</b> with consistent annual growth projected into 2035, due mostly to immigration and a fertility rate close to replacement level.|$|E
