25|$|In chemistry, a hypercycle is an <b>abstract</b> <b>model</b> of {{organization}} of self-replicating molecules connected in a cyclic, autocatalytic manner. It {{was introduced in}} an ordinary differential equation (ODE) form by the Nobel Prize winner Manfred Eigen in 1971 and subsequently further extended in collaboration with Peter Schuster. It was proposed {{as a solution to}} the error threshold problem encountered during modelling of replicative molecules that hypothetically existed on the primordial Earth (see: abiogenesis). As such, it explained how life on Earth could have begun using only relatively short genetic sequences, which in theory were too short to store all essential information. The hypercycle is a special case of the replicator equation. The most important properties of hypercycles are autocatalytic growth competition between cycles, once-for-ever selective behaviour, utilization of small selective advantage, rapid evolvability, increased information capacity, and selection against parasitic branches.|$|E

2500|$|How {{exactly the}} average {{industrial}} rate of profit will evolve, is either uncertain and unpredictable, {{or it is}} historically contingent; {{it all depends on}} the specific configuration of costs, sales and profit margins obtainable in fluctuating markets with given technologies. This [...] "indeterminacy" [...] criticism revolves around the idea that technological change could have many different and contradictory effects. It could reduce costs, or it could increase unemployment; it could be labor saving, or it could be capital saving. Therefore, so the argument goes, it is impossible to infer definitely a theoretical principle that a falling rate of profit must always and inevitably result from an increase in productivity. Perhaps the law of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall might be true in an <b>abstract</b> <b>model,</b> based on certain assumptions, but in reality no substantive empirical predictions can be made. In addition, profitability itself can be influenced by an enormous array of different factors, going far beyond those which Marx specified. So there are tendencies and counter-tendencies operating simultaneously, and no particular empirical result necessarily follows from them.|$|E
2500|$|A {{detailed}} conceptual {{proposal for}} a physical non-biological self-replicating system was first put forward by mathematician John von Neumann in lectures delivered in 1948 and 1949, when he proposed a kinematic self-reproducing automaton model as a thought experiment. Von Neumann's concept of a physical self-replicating machine was dealt with only abstractly, with the hypothetical machine using a [...] "sea" [...] or stockroom of spare parts as its source of raw materials. The machine had a program stored on a memory tape that directed it to retrieve parts from this [...] "sea" [...] using a manipulator, assemble them into a duplicate of itself, and then copy the contents of its memory tape into the empty duplicate's. The machine was envisioned as consisting of as few as eight different types of components; four logic elements that send and receive stimuli and four mechanical elements used to provide a structural skeleton and mobility. While qualitatively sound, von Neumann was evidently dissatisfied with this model of a self-replicating machine due {{to the difficulty of}} analyzing it with mathematical rigor. He went on to instead develop an even more <b>abstract</b> <b>model</b> self-replicator based on cellular automata. His original kinematic concept remained obscure until it was popularized in a 1955 issue of Scientific American.|$|E

Copernicus's work had been suppressed de facto by the Church, but Catholic authorities were generally tolerant of discussion of the hypothesis {{as long as it was}} portrayed only as a useful mathematical fiction, and not descriptive of reality. Galileo, by contrast, argued from his unprecedented observations of the solar system that the heliocentric system was not merely an <b>abstract</b> <b>model</b> for calculating planetary motions, but actually corresponded to physical reality – that is, he insisted the planets really do orbit the Sun. After years of telescopic observation, consultations with the Popes, and verbal and written discussions with astronomers and clerics, a trial was convened by the Tribunal of the Roman and Universal Inquisition. Galileo was found [...] "vehemently suspect of heresy" [...] (not [...] "guilty of heresy," [...] as is frequently misreported), placed under house arrest, and all of his works, including any future writings, were banned. Galileo had been threatened with torture and other Catholic scientists fell silent on the issue. Galileo's great contemporary René Descartes stopped publishing in France and went to Sweden.

2500|$|Tyndall was an {{experimenter}} {{and laboratory}} apparatus builder, not an <b>abstract</b> <b>model</b> builder. But in his experiments on radiation and the heat-absorptive power of gases, {{he had an}} underlying agenda to understand the physics of molecules. Tyndall said in 1879: [...] "During nine years of labour {{on the subject of}} radiation , heat and light were handled throughout by me, not as ends, but as instruments by the aid of which the mind might perchance lay hold upon the ultimate particles of matter." [...] This agenda is explicit in the title he picked for his 1872 book Contributions to Molecular Physics in the Domain of Radiant Heat. It is present less explicitly in the spirit of his widely read 1863 book Heat Considered as a Mode of Motion. Besides heat he also saw magnetism and sound propagation as reducible to molecular behaviours. Invisible molecular behaviours were the ultimate basis of all physical activity. With this mindset, and his experiments, he outlined an account whereby differing types of molecules have differing absorptions of infrared radiation because their molecular structures give them differing oscillating resonances. He'd gotten into the oscillating resonances idea because he'd seen that any one type of molecule has differing absorptions at differing radiant frequencies, and he was entirely persuaded that the only difference between one frequency and another is the frequency. He'd also seen that the absorption behaviour of molecules is quite {{different from that of the}} atoms composing the molecules. For example, the gas nitric oxide (NO) absorbed more than a thousand times more infrared radiation than either nitrogen (N2) or oxygen (O2).] the amount of radiant heat which they absorb is augmented more than a thousandfold. It may be a millionfold, for we do not yet know how small the absorption of the absolutely pure mixture really is. The act of chemical union is the sole cause of the enormous alteration in the amount of heat intercepted. The converse is also true: dissolve the chemical bond of the ammonia, and you instantly destroy the absorption." [...] He'd also seen in several kinds of experiments that – no matter whether a gas is a weak absorber of broad-spectrum radiant heat – any gas will strongly absorb the radiant heat coming from a separate body of the same type of gas.|$|E

40|$|In {{the theory}} of {{computation}} on topological algebras there is a considerable gap between so-called <b>abstract</b> and concrete <b>models</b> of computation. In concrete <b>models,</b> unlike <b>abstract</b> <b>models,</b> the computations depend on {{the representation of the}} algebra. First, we show that with <b>abstract</b> <b>models,</b> one needs algebras with partial operations, and computable functions that are both continuous and many-valued.

Weprove: (1) for any metric algebra A with an effective representation α, WhileCC ∗ approximability implies computability in α, and (2) also the converse, under certain reasonable conditions on A.
