5|$|This growth {{spurred the}} {{reorganisation}} of {{the governance of}} the town. Prior to 1818, the town was run by a mixture of bodies. The Sheffield Town Trust and the Church Burgesses, for example, divided responsibility {{for the improvement of}} streets and bridges. By the 19th century both organisations lacked funds and struggled even to maintain existing infrastructure. The Church Burgesses organised a public meeting on 27 May 1805 and proposed to apply to Parliament for an act to pave, light <b>and</b> <b>clean</b> <b>the</b> city's streets. The proposal was defeated.|$|E

25|$|Workers of the {{tropical}} leafcutter ant bringing leaf fragments back to the nest {{are at risk of}} attack by parasitodic phorid flies, who often land on leaf fragments and then proceed to oviposit (egg-lay) into the ant's head. To help combat this, small workers (minims) in at least seven species of Atta hitchhike on the leaves, deterring parasitioid attack. Many possible additional functions of hitchhiking have been proposed, some pertinent to social immunity; evidence exists that the primary function of hitchhiking minims' is actually to inspect <b>and</b> <b>clean</b> <b>the</b> leaf fragments prior to their entry into the colony, removing microbial parasites and contaminants.|$|E

25|$|Before the 1770s, textile {{production}} was {{a cottage industry}} using flax and wool. Weaving was a family activity. The children and women would card the fibre — break up <b>and</b> <b>clean</b> <b>the</b> disorganized fluff into long bundles. The women would then spin these rough rovings into yarn wound on a spindle. The male weaver would use a frame loom to weave this into cloth. This was then tentered in the sun to bleach it. The invention by John Kay of the flying shuttle made the loom twice as productive, causing the demand for cotton yarn to vastly exceed what traditional spinners could supply.|$|E
25|$|The M1935 Lahti is {{considered}} well manufactured and finished. Although the Lahti is outwardly {{similar to the}} P08 Luger, the firing mechanism is significantly different and {{more closely related to}} the Bergmann–Bayard pistol. The Lahti is a recoil operated, single-action, locked breech firearm fitted with a concealed hammer. The pistol itself is well sealed from dirt and ice but is heavy by modern standards. A manual safety was provided by a lever on the left-hand side of the pistol. It is impossible to strip <b>and</b> <b>clean</b> <b>the</b> Lahti without a trained armourer or access to a workshop but the need for repairs in the field was uncommon because of the Lahti's reliable design.|$|E
25|$|For {{several years}} after her marriage, she did all of the work by herself. The {{shoulder}} on which she carried pitchers {{of water from the}} well was swollen and the hand with which she worked the handmill to grind corn were often covered with blisters. Fatimah vouched {{to take care of the}} household work, make dough, bake bread, <b>and</b> <b>clean</b> <b>the</b> house; in return, Ali vouched to take care of the outside work such as gathering firewood and bringing food. Ali worked to irrigate other people's lands by drawing water from the wells. Their circumstances were akin to many of the Muslims at the time and only improved following the Battle of Khaybar when the produce of Khaybar was distributed among the poor. When the economic situations of the Muslims become better, Fatimah gained some maids but treated them like her family and performed the house duties with them.|$|E

25|$|The Balboa Battalion and its cadet {{corps of}} {{approximately}} 225 cadets volunteer extensively in different service learning projects {{and community service}} projects coordinated by the battalion staff of student officers and the army instructors. The battalion donates canned food items and toys to annual holiday food and toy drives where it has gained notoriety among the Student Association for amassing large amounts of food for the drive; because of this, the Balboa Battalion sponsors and puts together the food drive each year at Balboa. Balboa's JROTC participates in the citywide beach clean up annually, as well as cleaning up the school campus {{on a regular basis}} several times a month. The Balboa Battalion is a familiar face in each Earth Day event at Balboa, where cadets volunteer <b>and</b> <b>clean</b> <b>the</b> school. The JROTC program participates in service learning programs such as training in the Neighborhood Emergency Response Team to respond to any emergency event that may happen within the city or the school to keep fellow cadets and students alike of Balboa High School safe.|$|E
25|$|On 10 November 2014, the Bloomington {{city council}} voted 5-4 to {{purchase}} four {{acres of land}} near McGraw Park in Empire Business park using state funds and to rent the land to CCHS {{for use as a}} football practice field. The council voted with the understanding that the current football practice field on land owned by the Central Illinois Regional Airport was in a Federal Aviation Agency restricted flight path zone and the school would have to move to another location in 2015. In 2009, state senator and CCHS alum Bill Brady had arranged a $750,000 state legislative grant for the purchase as part of a General Assembly capital bill. Alderman Jim Fruin, another CCHS alum, voted in favor. CCHS agreed to spend at least $20,000 to improve the land, pay an annual rent of $1,700, as well as maintain, mow, <b>and</b> <b>clean</b> <b>the</b> field. The annual cost to the city was estimated to be $2,500 and the land was {{to be used as a}} park when not in use by the school.|$|E
25|$|As {{a college}} student, Garner did summer stock theater. In {{addition}} to performing, Garner helped to sell tickets, build sets, <b>and</b> <b>clean</b> <b>the</b> venues. She {{worked at the}} Timber Lake Playhouse in Mount Carroll, Illinois in 1992, the Barn Theatre in Augusta, Michigan in 1993, and the Georgia Shakespeare Festival in Atlanta, Georgia in 1994. Garner moved to New York City in 1995. During her first year in the city, Garner earned $150 per week as an understudy for a Roundabout Theatre Company production of A Month in the Country, starring Helen Mirren and F. Murray Abraham, and made her first on-screen appearance as Melissa Gilbert's daughter in the romance miniseries Zoya. In 1996, she played an Amish woman in the television movie Harvest of Fire and a flirtatious shopkeeper in the Western miniseries Dead Man's Walk. She appeared in the independent short film In Harm's Way and made one-off appearances in the legal dramas Swift Justice and Law & Order. She met Stephen Colbert while filming an episode of Spin City and became an occasional babysitter for his children. Garner also supplemented her income by working as a hostess at Isabella's restaurant on the Upper East Side.|$|E

It features multiple gables, arcs of red-painted wood, and a gently-sloping portico.

The two unexploded B-28 FI 1.45-megaton-range nuclear bombs on the B-52 were eventually recovered; the conventional explosives of two more bombs detonated on impact, with serious dispersion of both plutonium and uranium, but without triggering a nuclear explosion.

In 2007, the Portland Water Bureau posted the name and photograph of a 19-year-old who placed dish soap in the fountain and received a misdemeanor criminal mischief. The public shaming of the teen caused the incident to be discussed in many places, including KATU, The Oregonian, The Portland Mercury ("This is what happens when you screw with the Water Bureau"), and The New York Times ("Don't mess with the Portland Water Bureau"). The fountain was soaped at least four times in August 2007 alone.|$|E
