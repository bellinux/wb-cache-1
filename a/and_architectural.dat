5|$|A {{building}} {{boom in the}} early 20th century gave Tulsa {{one of the largest}} concentrations of art deco architecture in the United States. Most commonly in the zigzag and streamline styles, the city's art deco is dotted throughout its older neighborhoods, primarily in downtown and midtown. A collection of large art deco structures such as the Mid-Continent Tower, the Boston Avenue Methodist Church, and the Philtower, have attracted events promoting preservation <b>and</b> <b>architectural</b> interest. In 2001, Tulsa served as the host city for the International Art Deco Congress, a semiannual event designed to promote art deco architecture internationally.|$|E

5|$|A six-page writeup {{about the}} {{building}} appeared in Architect and Engineer in December 1937. The article listed {{the owners and}} the structural engineer, but did not name the architect. In the early 1980s, geologist <b>and</b> <b>architectural</b> historian Gray Brechin discovered that Irvin Goldstine had designed the building; Brechin subsequently interviewed Goldstine regarding his career. An article about the discovery was printed in Metro Magazine, a defunct San Francisco magazine. Until that time, the building {{was thought to be}} designed by the Mallochs.|$|E

It resulted in an artistic <b>and</b> <b>architectural</b> symbiosis best illustrated in the artifacts of Umm el 'Amed and Bustan esh Sheikh.|$|E

5|$|In 1857, Rodin {{submitted}} a clay {{model of a}} companion to the École des Beaux-Arts {{in an attempt to}} win entrance; he did not succeed, and two further applications were also denied. Given that entrance requirements at the Grande École were not particularly high, the rejections were considerable setbacks. Rodin's inability to gain entrance may have been due to the judges' Neoclassical tastes, while Rodin had been schooled in light, 18th-century sculpture. Leaving the Petite École in 1857, Rodin earned a living as a craftsman and ornamenter for most of the next two decades, producing decorative objects <b>and</b> <b>architectural</b> embellishments.|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} site, located {{right next}} to the western approach of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, formerly contained a clock tower.

As the South Tower neared completion, it generated controversy concerning view encroachment, high pricing, <b>and</b> <b>architectural</b> style.|$|E
