40|$|Satellite {{television}} stations are subtly challenging the state's monopoly over {{the means of}} persuasion and information in the Arab world. A Qatari-based television channel, <b>Al-Jazeera's</b> coverage of Syrian politics exemplifies how satellite television is changing the conditions of communication between citizens and states in the Arab world and increasing the space for civil society, creating more moments in television that are not as controlled by states. The significance of the Syrian case {{lies in the fact}} that the Syrian regime is highly authoritarian and still maintains near total control of information and communication. The following examines <b>Al-Jazeera's</b> reporting of several issues considered highly sensitive according to the censorship policies of Syria's Ministries of Information and Culture and Guidance: political opposition in Syria, succession, and the impact of the peace process on the regime's survival ability...|$|R

5000|$|The Guardian film {{reviewer}} Peter Bradshaw states that, [...] "The {{force of}} his film is in its contention that the colossal scale of civilian casualties is, within the grammar of news, downgraded in importance so that it doesn't figure as news at all, but as all-but-invisible deep background to be ignored". [...] "Pilger gives due respect to WikiLeaks," [...] he concludes, [...] "although his praise for <b>al-Jazeera's</b> independence is ironic, given that WikiLeaks has just revealed {{the possibility that the}} Qatar government is manipulating the channel." ...|$|R

50|$|<b>Al-Jazeera's</b> {{bureau chief}} in Islamabad, Ahmad Zaidan, was wrongly {{identified}} as the most probable member of al-Qaeda and the Muslim Brotherhood on their records.

50|$|The Public Security Bureau {{wants to}} clean out the foreign trash: To arrest foreign thugs and protect {{innocent}} girls, they need to concentrate on the disaster zones in district Wudaokou and district Sanlitun.
