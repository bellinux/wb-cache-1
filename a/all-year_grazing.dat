40|$|A first {{picture of}} the total {{environmental}} performance of milk production from a typical NZ dairy farm system, using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was produced and compare to European LCA studies. Five potential impacts have been assessed. Results were expressed per kg of milk produced at the farm gate and per ha of land use. In this first assessment, compared to Swedish and German conventional dairy farm systems, the NZ system had three fold lower eutro-phication potential and acidification potential per kg of milk, two fold lower energy use and land use, and 50 % to 80 % lower global warming potential. Even compared to Swedish and German organic farm systems, its potential impacts per kg of milk were similar or most often lower. This {{can be explained by}} a farming system almost entirely based on high-producing perennial pastures and <b>all-year</b> <b>grazing</b> compared to European farming systems with high supplementary feed use. 1...|$|E
