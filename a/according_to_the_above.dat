25|$|Problematic point(s): it is {{not always}} known whether a {{specific}} form is actually the official name of an institution, or what is its official name (e.g. whether the city of its location is part of the name).

A third problem is {{the question of whether the}} spelling of an organization can be corrected if it is not written <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>above</b> rule. In addition, adjectival forms derived from institution names are also often mistaken because people feel the need to distinguish them from genuine common names (especially if the name contains a fancy name that becomes identical with a common name if written in lowercase).

500|$|Misuse, problem use, abuse, {{and heavy}} {{use of alcohol}} refer to {{improper}} use of alcohol which may cause physical, social, or moral harm to the drinker. Moderate use is defined by The Dietary Guidelines for Americans as {{no more than two}} alcoholic beverages a day for men and no more than one alcoholic beverage a day for women. Some drinkers may drink more than 600 ml of alcohol per day during a heavy drinking period. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) defines binge drinking as the amount of alcohol leading to a blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.08, which, for most adults, would be reached by consuming five drinks for men or four for women over a two-hour period. According to the NIAAA, men may be at risk for alcohol-related problems if their alcohol consumption exceeds 14 standard drinks per week or 4 drinks per day, and women may be at risk if they have more than 7 standard drinks per week or 3 drinks per day. It defines a standard drink as one 12-ounce bottle of beer, one 5-ounce glass of wine, or 1.5ounces of distilled spirits. Despite this risk, a 2014 report in the National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that only 10% of either [...] "heavy drinkers" [...] or [...] "binge drinkers" [...] defined <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>above</b> criteria also met the criteria for alcohol dependence, while only 1.3% of non-binge drinkers met the criteria.

2500|$|When {{those two}} {{propagation}} constants are equal then the effective refractive index {{is independent of}} polarization, and there is consequently no birefringence encountered by a wave traveling in that particular direction. For a uniaxial crystal, this is the optic axis, the z direction <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>above</b> construction. But when all three refractive indices (or permittivities), nx, ny and nz are distinct, it can be shown that there are exactly two such directions (where the two ellipsoids intersect); these directions {{are not at all}} obvious and do not lie along any of the three principal axes (x, y, and z <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>above</b> convention). Historically that accounts {{for the use of the}} term [...] "biaxial" [...] for such crystals, as the existence of exactly two such special directions (considered [...] "axes") was discovered well before polarization and birefringence were understood physically. However these two special directions are generally not of particular interest; biaxial crystals are rather specified by their three refractive indices corresponding to the three axes of symmetry.|$|E

In that case even a negative lens can project a real image, as is done by a Barlow lens.|$|E
2500|$|Radio waves {{passing through}} the Earth's {{ionosphere}} are likewise subject to the Faraday effect. The ionosphere consists of a plasma containing free electrons which contribute to Faraday rotation <b>according</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>above</b> equation, whereas the positive ions are relatively massive and have little influence. In conjunction with the earth's magnetic field, rotation of the polarization of radio waves thus occurs. Since the density of electrons in the ionosphere varies greatly on a daily basis, as well as over the sunspot cycle, {{the magnitude of the}} effect varies. However the effect is always proportional to the square of the wavelength, so even at the UHF television frequency of 500MHz (λ = 60cm), there can be more than a complete rotation of the axis of polarization. [...] A consequence is that although most radio transmitting antennas are either vertically or horizontally polarized, the polarization of a medium or short wave signal after reflection by the ionosphere is rather unpredictable. However the Faraday effect due to free electrons diminishes rapidly at higher frequencies (shorter wavelengths) so that at microwave frequencies, used by satellite communications, the transmitted polarization is maintained between the satellite and the ground.|$|E
