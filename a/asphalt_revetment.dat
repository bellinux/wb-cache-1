40|$|PUR-revetment is a newly {{developed}} method for hydraulic application. Its structure {{is similar to}} that of open stone <b>asphalt</b> <b>revetment,</b> but the crushed stones are glued by polyurethane (PUR) instead of bitumen. To study the feasibility of applying PUR-revetment, a research based on the comparisons between PUR-revetment and open stone <b>asphalt</b> <b>revetment</b> was carried out, for which, a standard four-point bending frequency sweep test, a standard monotonic three-point bending strength test, a porosity test, a stability on slope test, a wave run-up test, an interface permeability test, a relative resistance to abrasive action test and some calculations in GOLFKLAP were done. It suggests PUR-revetment is applicable in practice. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|A new {{construction}} method of Polyurethane (PUR) -bonded revetments {{has been tested}} successfully as stable breakwater constructions on various locations in Germany (“Hamburg Hallig”, “Holm Gröde”), as dike revetment in the Netherlands (breakwater revetment in Zuidbout and Petten), as shoreline protection in France (canal embankment near Le Havre), and a maintenance solution in the UK (open stone <b>asphalt</b> <b>revetment</b> repaired in Holland-on-Sea). This paper focuses on the research related to stability and environmental soundness of PUR-bounded revetments. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|The dual task of {{reinforcing}} the dikes along the Dutch coast {{and preparing for}} the effects of climate change have stimulated a search for innovative dike designs. Triggered by the presence of gently sloped grass-covered dikes that merge smoothly into the adjacent salt marshes along the German Wadden Sea coast, we assessed the potential costs and benefits of just such a ‘Wide Green Dike’ along the Dutch Wadden Sea coast, compared to the ‘Traditional Dike’, which is now used. The Traditional Dike has a steeper seaward slope and a stone or <b>asphalt</b> <b>revetment</b> along the dike toe. The assessment criteria were identified by local experts. We investigated, particularly, the spatial impact of a Wide Green Dike on the adjacent salt marshes under various climate scenarios. We also looked at the initial costs and clay demand for both dike designs. Furthermore, we conducted a quick-scan of the vegetation present halfway up the seaward slope of a Traditional Dike in the Netherlands and a Wide Green Dike nearby in Germany. Our analysis revealed four primary advantages of use of a Wide Green Dike along the Dutch part of the Dollard estuary: lower initial costs (based on standard unit prices), greater ease of doing repairs, increased adaptability and enhanced spatial quality compared to a Traditional Dike. Both types of dike were designed to withstand an extreme storm surge with an occurrence probability of 1 / 4000 years. Both fully met legally mandated engineering standards as well. Though the required crest height is comparable for both designs, the Wide Green Dike had a larger areal footprint, and would overlap more Natura 2000 area than a Traditional Dike. There would thus be a trade-off concerning salt-marsh area. Moreover, the vegetation examined halfway up the seaward slope of the German Wide Green Dike offered little ecological value. Nonetheless, cyclic harvesting of sediment for periodic dike reinforcement appeared to be a sustainable option for adapting to future sea level rise. </p...|$|E
40|$|Elastocoast is {{a special}} {{elastomeric}} polyurethane system made by Elastogran. It binds broken rocks or stones {{together to form a}} stable material which is not only solid but also elastic so that it is able to be an ideal material for hydraulic applications. As a new developed material for revetment, the performance of Elastocoast in the application of revetments is still unknown. This research is carried out to study the feasibility of the Elasatocoast's applications as revetments. Due to the similarities between Elastocoast and open stone asphalt, most of the experiments are done according to the concerning problems of the open stone <b>asphalt</b> <b>revetments.</b> Five properties were tested: porosity, permeability between the material and geotextile, wave run-up, stability on slope and resistance to erosion. It turned out that compared to open stone asphalt Elastocoast is a strong and permeable material and it is relatively easy to construct and maintain. It {{is expected to be a}} suitable material as revetment...|$|R
40|$|The {{numerical}} simulation of wave {{attack on a}} sea dike with an <b>asphalt</b> concrete <b>revetment</b> during a severe storm is carried out using the dynamic Finite Element Method. When wave loads attack the revetment during such a storm, both the revetment and the underlying soil may be damaged. The two-phase flow equations are considered, to study the dynamic generation and dissipation of excess pore pressures in the saturated soil underneath the revetment caused by the cyclic wave attack. Moreover, a sensitivity study for the revetment is presented to indicate {{the importance of the}} stiffness of the concrete. Geoscience & EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|Asphalt {{products}} {{have been used}} in the Netherlands in hydraulic engineering for a long time on a large scale, especially after the great disaster in 1953 when a large part of western Holland was flooded by the sea. After the disaster a great number of dikes had to be repaired very quickly and this was possible with the use of <b>asphalt</b> as a <b>revetment</b> material. <b>Asphalt</b> could be placed much faster then the materials most commonly used in those days. Further more asphalt is, when desired, more watertight than clay which is also scarce. Except for bitumen no foreign construction materials are necessary. The guidelines have been composed by a group in which representatives of public offices, companies and research centres worked together. It was attempted to make the content as complete as possible. Experience and knowledge were gathered, investigations carried out and design models made. It is inevitable however, that there are some shortcomings. Therefore it is intended to adapt the guidelines {{from time to time and}} to update them with new information. Comments and reactions of the reader are therefore very welcome. The guidelines were written for Dutch purposes. This means that mostly applications to dikes, breakwaters and bed protections are considered. Other types as for instance reservoir and dam applications are only mentioned without specific details. Also, reference is made to Dutch standards and directives only. Despite these aspects these guidelines will certainly contribute to a better design, execution, management and maintenance for hydraulic asphalt constructions, not only in the Netherlands but also in other countries, the reason for the translation into the English language.

40|$|Nowadays, in the Netherlands {{there are}} about 600 {{kilometers}} of asphaltic revetments lying mainly on sea dikes of which approximately 400 km of dike is covered with asphalt concrete [STOWA, 2011]. Asphalt concrete revetments are applied the most and are mostly of older age. Because of the older age it needs intensive care involving periodic inspection and safety checks. The focus on maintenance has encouraged for research {{to be done on}} asphalt revetments. The (fatigue) behavior of asphalt concrete on a sand foundation under wave loading is not very well known. Especially about the interaction between an asphalt concrete revetment and the subsoil under wave attack only limited knowledge is available. In this study the focus is placed on getting more detailed insight into the interaction between an asphalt concrete revetment and the underlying subsoil (foundation) under wave loading for both old and newly made asphalt concrete. Deltares and KOAC-NPC have been focusing on the interaction between an <b>asphalt</b> <b>revetment</b> and the subsoil under wave attack and have been performing experiments together with finite element calculations to predict and validate their data. Medium scale experiments which simulate a loading caused by wave attack on a scaled part (about a factor 3) of an asphalt concrete dike revetment were designed. A series of short pulse (haversine) loadings were applied to simulate the stresses and strains during wave attack. In total six medium scale experiments (4 on newly made and 2 on old asphalt concrete) have been carried out and after each of the experiments the test set-up and/or procedure had been improved. The medium scale experiments almost resemble a falling weight deflection measurement. With the deflections measured during the experiments the occurring strains can be calculated. Using the WESLEA software the elastic deflection profile for a selection of pulse loadings measured during the experiments are back-calculated for selected measurement points of experiments 3, 4, 5 and 6. The linear elastic calculations with the WESLEA software led {{to a better understanding of}} the behavior of the asphalt concrete plate on the Baskarp sand for both the old and new asphalt concrete. Back-calculations for all of the loading stages during experiment 5 on old asphalt concrete with the ABAQUS model used by Deltares and KOAC-NPC have been performed, using a linear elastic material model for both the asphalt concrete plate and the Baskarp sand bed. The fits are reasonable, but a low stiffness modulus is found for the asphalt concrete. From the back-calculations of the medium scale experiments with WESLEA, typical stiffness moduli for the Baskarp sand bed (varying between 40 to 60 MPa) are found, depending on the loading conditions. These values are also sufficient for the linear elastic calculations with ABAQUS model for experiment 5. A constant stiffness modulus of the asphalt concrete could not be determined. It is observed that the stiffness modulus is different for each load magnitude, even for the same asphalt concrete plate on the same Baskarp sand bed. The stiffness modulus of the asphalt concrete plate depends on the strain level and the loading speed [KOAC-NPC, 2013]. The uncertainty of the back-calculated asphalt concrete stiffness modulus also depends on the varying thickness of the asphalt concrete plate and the accuracy of the measured elastic deformations. Since most of the current asphalt concrete revetments in the Netherlands consist of aged asphalt concrete (about 90 % is older than 20 years), the failure mechanism most likely to occur under wave impacts is failure due to fatigue. From the research done up till now, it has become clear that if the asphalt concrete revetments which are less affected by ageing are less vulnerable to failure due to fatigue under wave impacts.
