5|$|The main Fur Army was now {{located in}} their capital of El Fasher and was {{estimated}} to consist of between 4,000 and 6,000 riflemen with <b>adequate</b> <b>supplies</b> of ammunition. Their equipment ranged from older muzzleloader weapons, such as Martini-Henry and Remington rifles and shotguns, to spears, shields and chain mail. They were supported by {{an unknown number of}} auxiliary troops armed only with spears. At the same time Dinar was concentrating his troops from other regions in the capital. Those in contact with the Anglo-Egyptian forces and some small number of reinforcements, were instead grouped at Burush and Kedada.|$|E
5|$|Anglo-Norman warfare was characterised by attritional {{military}} campaigns, {{in which}} commanders tried to raid enemy lands and seize castles {{in order to}} allow them to take control of their adversaries' territory, ultimately winning slow but strategic victories. Pitched battles were occasionally fought between armies but these were considered risky engagements and usually avoided by prudent commanders. The armies of the period comprised bodies of mounted, armoured knights, supported by infantry. Crossbowmen become more numerous in the 12th century, alongside the older shortbow. At the heart of these armies was the familia regis, the permanent military household of the king, which was supported in war by feudal levies, drawn up by local nobles for a limited period of service during a campaign. Mercenaries were increasingly employed, driving up the cost of warfare considerably, and <b>adequate</b> <b>supplies</b> of ready cash became essential for the success of campaigns.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of 1798, the Mediterranean Sea was entirely {{under the control of}} the French Navy and their allies, {{including}} Spain, which had switched sides in the French Revolutionary Wars in late 1796 at the Treaty of San Ildefonso. Denied access to deep water ports and <b>adequate</b> <b>supplies,</b> the Royal Navy fleet deployed in the Mediterranean under Vice-Admiral Sir John Jervis was forced to withdraw to the nearest friendly fleet anchorage, at the mouth of the Tagus River in Portugal. Although forced to retreat, Jervis' force was not defeated and on 14 February 1797 he achieved a victory over the Spanish Navy at the Battle of Cape St Vincent, capturing four Spanish ships of the line. A blockade of the Spanish Atlantic ports was instituted, especially Cadiz, the large southern fleet anchorage, and the Spanish did not again attempt to break out during the remainder of the year.|$|E

5|$|The {{need for}} tanks to equip {{armoured}} units led the War Cabinet {{to approve the}} manufacture of the Sentinel tank in 1940. Some 66 of them were delivered by the time manufacture ceased in July 1943, but none were used in action. Otherwise tanks were sourced from overseas. A quantity of M3 Stuart light tanks were received in September 1941, while the first shipment of British Matilda II tanks arrived in July 1942, and these {{proved to be the}} most suitable type for jungle warfare. A flame-thrower variant was produced and eventually saw action in the Borneo campaign. The most numerous tank used by the Australian Army was the M3 Lee. Several hundred of these equipped the armoured divisions, but unlike the Stuarts and Matildas, they did not see action. An Australian scout car known as the Dingo was produced as an interim measure until <b>adequate</b> <b>supplies</b> of the Canadian Staghound armoured car became available in 1944. The Australian Army also operated some amphibious tractors.|$|E
5|$|The {{role of the}} Combined Development Trust was to {{purchase}} or control the mineral resources needed by the Manhattan Project, and to avoid competition between the three. Britain had little need for uranium ores while the war continued, but was anxious to secure <b>adequate</b> <b>supplies</b> for its own nuclear weapons programme when it ended. Half the funding was {{to come from the}} United States and half from Britain and Canada. The initial $12.5 million was transferred to Groves from an account {{in the office of the}} United States Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau, Jr., that was not subject to the usual accounting auditing and oversight. By the time Groves resigned from the Trust at the end of 1947, he had deposited $37.5 million into an account he controlled at the Bankers Trust. Payments were then made from this account.|$|E
5|$|When the U.S. entered World War I in 1917, the American ice trade {{received}} a temporary boost to production. Shipments of chilled food to Europe surged during the war, placing significant {{demands on the}} country's existing refrigeration capabilities, while the need to produce munitions for the war effort meant that ammonia and coal for refrigeration plants were in short supply. The U.S. government worked together with the plant and natural ice industries to promote the use of natural ice to relieve the burden and maintain <b>adequate</b> <b>supplies.</b> For Britain and Norway, however, the war impacted badly on the natural ice trade; the German attempt to blockade the North Sea with U-boats made shipments difficult and Britain relied increasingly more heavily on its limited number of ice plants for supplies instead.|$|E

5|$|Anglo-Norman warfare {{during the}} reign of Stephen was characterised by attritional {{military}} campaigns, in which commanders tried to seize key enemy castles in order to allow them to take control of their adversaries' territory and ultimately win a slow, strategic victory. The armies of the period centred on bodies of mounted, armoured knights, supported by infantry and crossbowmen. These forces were either feudal levies, drawn up by local nobles for a limited period of service during a campaign, or, increasingly, mercenaries, who were expensive but more flexible and often more skilled. These armies, however, were ill-suited to besieging castles, whether the older motte-and-bailey designs or the newer, stone-built keeps. Existing siege engines were significantly less powerful than the later trebuchet designs, giving defenders a substantial advantage over attackers. As a result, slow sieges to starve defenders out, or mining operations to undermine walls, tended to be preferred by commanders over direct assaults. Occasionally pitched battles were fought between armies but these were considered highly risky endeavours and were usually avoided by prudent commanders. The cost of warfare had risen considerably {{in the first part of}} the 12th century, and <b>adequate</b> <b>supplies</b> of ready cash were increasingly proving important in the success of campaigns.|$|E
5|$|Overall, Operation Matterhorn was not successful. The nine raids {{conducted}} against Japan via {{bases in}} China succeeded only in destroying Ōmura's aircraft factory. XXBomber Command lost 125 B-29s {{during all of}} its operations from bases in India and China, though only 22 or 29 were destroyed by Japanese forces; {{the majority of the}} losses were due to flying accidents. The attacks had a limited impact on Japanese civilian morale but forced the Japanese military to reinforce the home islands' air defenses {{at the expense of other}} areas. These results did not justify the large allocation of Allied resources to the operation, however. Moreover, the diversion of some supply aircraft flown between India and China to support XXBomber Command's efforts may have prevented the Fourteenth Air Force from undertaking more effective operations against Japanese positions and shipping. The official history of the USAAF judged that the difficulty of transporting <b>adequate</b> <b>supplies</b> to India and China was the most important factor behind the failure of Operation Matterhorn, though technical problems with the B-29s and the inexperience of their crews also hindered the campaign. The adverse weather conditions common over Japan also limited the effectiveness of the Superfortresses, as crews that managed to reach their target were often unable to bomb accurately due to high winds or cloud cover.|$|E
5|$|The Australians {{were also}} {{experiencing}} their own supply problems. To {{enable them to}} mount a counter-attack, it was vital that they build up a stockpile of supplies in the forward areas. To reduce the burden placed on the native carrier system the Allies turned to aerial resupply, a technique that was still in its infancy. The loss of Kokoda had deprived them of a forward airfield, but to an extent this had been alleviated by {{the creation of a}} supply drop zone for US transport aircraft around the dry lake at Myola. These efforts, though, were hamstrung by deficiencies in the aerial resupply process and inexperience in its application. Only a few supplies were dropped by parachute, while the rest were just free-dropped. Inevitably some supplies fell away from their intended drop zones, while others were damaged due to inadequate packaging. Additionally, poor staff work and inattention resulted in fewer supplies being collected in the drop zone than Potts had been promised. This had the effect of slowing the arrival of the Australian reinforcements as they had to be held up and then committed piecemeal company by company, as <b>adequate</b> <b>supplies</b> could be brought forward to sustain them.|$|E

5|$|There {{was also}} the {{secondary}} capital city of Luoyang, which was the favored capital of the two by Empress Wu. In the year 691 she had more than 100,000 families (more than 500,000 people) from around the region of Chang'an move to populate Luoyang instead. With {{a population of about}} a million, Luoyang became the second largest city in the empire, and with its close proximity to the Luo River it benefited from southern agricultural fertility and trade traffic of the Grand Canal. However, the Tang court eventually demoted its capital status and did not visit Luoyang after the year 743, when Chang'an's problem of acquiring <b>adequate</b> <b>supplies</b> and stores for the year was solved. As early as 736, granaries were built at critical points along the route from Yangzhou to Chang'an, which eliminated shipment delays, spoilage, and pilfering. An artificial lake used as a transshipment pool was dredged east of Chang'an in 743, where curious northerners could finally see the array of boats found in southern China, delivering tax and tribute items to the imperial court.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the weather}} in the American heartland, {{the best time to}} travel was April–September. Some companies, however, started late in the season which {{resulted}} in hardship and sometimes disaster. The most famous of these are the Willie and the Martin handcart companies.
