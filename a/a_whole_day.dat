5|$|Dhumavati's worship is {{performed}} in {{the night in a}} cremation ground, bare-bodied {{with the exception of a}} loincloth. The fourth lunar day of the dark fortnight (Krishna Paksha) is considered the special day to perform her puja (worship). The worshipper should observe a fast and remain silent for <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>day</b> and night. They should also perform a homa ("fire sacrifice"), wearing wet clothes and a turban, repeating the goddess' mantra in a cremation ground, forest, or any lonely place.|$|E
5|$|The dragon man was {{believed}} to act similar to the mythological dragon: {{as soon as he}} saw bad weather approaching, which he knew was brought by an ala, he would leave whatever he was doing, and fly up to confront the demon. This he did by falling into a deep sleep, or entering a state similar to death, usually at the very spot where he happened to be at that time. His soul then left his body in the form of a snake or a lizard, and soared skywards. It was claimed that he was not breathing as long as his soul was absent from his body. The battle could last for <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>day,</b> or even for several days, during which time the man lay unconscious, sweating profusely from the exertion of the fight. There was a danger that, during the course of the battle, the ala might approach the man's body and harm him, which could be prevented by someone swinging a blade above him, or by sticking the blade at the lying man's head. He should not be pushed or moved while in this state: if he was not in the same position as when he fell asleep, his soul would not be able to return into his body, and he would die. When he woke up after the battle with the ala, he was very tired. Apart from these characteristics, the dragon man was seen as an ordinary human.|$|E

60|$|The {{economic}} system we should ultimately {{wish to see}} would be {{one in which the}} state would be the sole recipient of economic rent, while private capitalistic enterprises should be replaced by self-governing combinations of those who actually do the work. It ought to be optional whether a man does <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>day's</b> work for <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>day's</b> pay, or half a day's work for half a day's pay, except in cases where such an arrangement would cause practical inconvenience. A man's pay should not cease through the accident of his work being no longer needed, but should continue so long as he is willing to work, a new trade being taught him at the public expense, if necessary. Unwillingness to work should be treated medically or educationally, when it could not be overcome by a change to some more congenial occupation.|$|R
25|$|At noon {{all four}} ships {{exchanged}} broadsides and musket volleys {{in a battle}} that lasted for nearly <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>day.</b> The English ships tried to board the Cinco Chagas but were repelled by the larger Portuguese numbers. As casualties mounted on both sides the decks of the carrack were cluttered with dead and wounded.|$|E

In 1944 Kayser {{and three other}} men were tasked with assaulting German ships in the harbour of Måløy. However, the plan went sour as locals became alarmed of their presence. Kayser had to escape by land. He reportedly entrenched himself in a marsh for <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>day</b> in order to escape a Gestapo search party.|$|E

England won the first Test, despite giving up a deficit of 10 on first innings, but drew the second and third; the third Test saw <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>day's</b> play lost to rain. Excluding one-offs, this was England's first series win since their inaugural series.|$|R
50|$|Taiwan {{does not}} mass-produce Dragon Bone Stone {{due to its}} scarcity. In any case, the stones are also {{difficult}} to find.The miners look up and search stones one by one on the riverbed. Sometimes, even <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>day's</b> search does not reveal a single stone. Moreover, after the 921 earthquake broke the mine vein, fewer stones flushed down together with river current.|$|R

King Olav decided the ship was to be rebuilt at Horten shipyard. A year later he was once again able to take over Norge, with {{a higher standard of}} safety and better technical equipment than before the fire.|$|E
25|$|We do {{know that}} Seleucus managed to defeat Antigonus {{in at least one}} decisive battle. This battle is only {{mentioned}} in Stratagems in War by Polyaenus. Polyaenus reports that the troops of Seleucus and Antigonus fought for <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>day,</b> but when night came the battle was still undecided. The two forces agreed to rest for the night and continue in the morning. Antigonus' troops slept without their equipment. Seleucus ordered his forces to sleep and eat breakfast in battle formation. Shortly before dawn, Seleucus' troops attacked the forces of Antigonus, who were still without their weapons and in disarray and thus easily defeated. The historical accuracy of the story is questionable.|$|E
25|$|In Yoga principle, it is {{recommended}} that one maintains a spiritual fast on a particular day each week (Monday or Thursday). A fast should also be maintained on the full moon day of each month. It is essential on the spiritual fasting day to not only to abstain from meals, but also to spend the whole day with a positive, spiritual attitude. On the fasting day, intake of solid food during the day is avoided and only a light veggie meal around 5 o'clock is taken. Water can be taken any time as needed. If health does not permit fasting for <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>day,</b> for example with Diabetes, careful planning is done to reduce or skip one meal.|$|E

25|$|The Glasgow Subway and its {{adjacent}} public {{houses are}} {{the focal point}} of a pub crawl known as the Subcrawl. Participants buy an all day Discovery ticket, disembark at each of the 15 stations and have a drink in the nearest bar. Two of the stations (West Street and Shields Road) are not very near a pub or bar; however, Subcrawls are popular amongst young Glaswegians and especially students at the city's universities. During the journey between stations, participants are usually required to stand in the train and not hold onto any supports, known as Subsurfing. A subcrawl usually takes <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>day,</b> and completing a crawl (drinking in the same pub one started in) is regarded as quite an achievement.|$|E
25|$|The metro {{was finally}} {{opened to the}} public on February 4, 2006, after a 45-day delay. It {{operated}} on a shorter stretch (XVIII Dicembre (Porta Susa) to Fermi – 11 stations) than originally forecast; it finally reached the main railway station (Porta Nuova) {{and the rest of the}} city centre more than one year after the Games, in October 2007. For the duration of the Games, a single ticket (5 euros) covered use of both the metro and other means of public transportation for <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>day.</b> However, during the Games, metro service stopped at 6:00pm, making it impractical for spectators of evening events. Furthermore, the metro did not reach any of the Olympic venues. On the other hand, the bus service was heavily improved for the Games, although still inadequate at night hours.|$|E
25|$|His Test {{debut at}} Lord's was disastrous, but his next two Tests won him notice. In the final Test against Australia in 1959–60 at Calcutta, {{he went in}} to bat {{towards the end of}} the first day and {{finished}} on 20 not out on the second day. He started his second innings just before stumps on the third day, batted throughout the fourth scoring only 59 runs, and was out on the final day for 74. This made him the first batsman to bat on all five days of a Test match. At Kanpur against Pakistan a year later, he batted through <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>day</b> for just 54 runs. This innings, which lasted 505 minutes for 99 runs, ironically ended when he attempted a quick single to complete his hundred.|$|E

25|$|After a vain protest to Codrington, Ibrahim {{decided to}} act. On 1 October, he {{despatched}} a naval squadron {{to reinforce the}} Patras garrison. It was intercepted by Codrington's squadron {{at the entrance to}} the gulf, and forced to return to Navarino, shadowed by Codrington. Ibrahim tried again on the night of 3/4 October, this time leading the squadron in person. Using the darkness, he succeeded in slipping past the British picket ship unobserved, but was prevented from entering the gulf by a strong headwind. His squadron was obliged to anchor in the lee of Cape Papas and wait out the storm. This gave Codrington time to catch up, and the British squadron, after <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>day</b> of fighting the wind, arrived off Papas on the evening of 4 October. Codrington fired a series of warning broadsides, and Ibrahim reluctantly decided to turn back.|$|E
25|$|On 31 July paratroopers {{effectively}} surrounded Ayta ash-Sha'b {{with the}} intention of driving out the Hizbullah. They were met with fierce resistance. On the next day they advanced on the town from two directions. One company-sized unit was advancing into the eastern Abu Laban quarter. The troops were discovered by Lebanese forces, which after several hours of fighting forced the Israelis to retreat. During this fight Hizbullah suffered its first fatality, Younis Surour. The other force, the 890th Paratrooper Battalion, attacked the Old Town from the north and advanced towards the mosque. The battalion came under fire, and its forces got separated as they took cover. Israeli soldiers were shocked by the ferocity of the fire and several stopped functioning. The attack was aborted and reinforcements were called in to extract dead, wounded and shell-shocked soldiers. According to Hizbullah, another Lebanese fighter, Hisham as-Sayyid, was killed while pursuing the retreating Israelis. Three Israeli soldiers, including an officer, were killed and at least 25 were wounded. The IDF had claimed that 15 Hizbullah guerrillas had been killed in the clash, though Hizbullah claimed it only lost two fighters. Israeli injured had to be carried by their comrades, under Hizbullah fire, back to the Israeli border. It took the wounded <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>day</b> to reach the hospital in Nahariya. The Paratroopers were originally supposed to move north the following day but because of the casualties sustained, they were ordered to remain {{in the vicinity of the}} town.|$|E

5000|$|Oxide Radio {{was founded}} in 2001 [...] spearheaded by Simon Demetriou, {{following}} {{the demise of the}} previous student radio station, Oxygen FM. Broadcasting from 1997 to 2001, Oxygen FM was Oxford Universitys student radio station which broadcast full-time on FM, as well as an internet stream. Oxygens closure came about as a result of fabricating <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>day’s</b> programming in <b>an</b> attempt to deceive the Radio Authority, which led to a record fine of £20,000 and a shortening of the broadcast licence by two years, the most serious sanctions the Authority had ever imposed.|$|R
50|$|The ACTH {{stimulation}} test is occasionally {{used to test}} adrenal {{production of}} aldosterone {{at the same time}} as cortisol to also help in determining if primary (hyperreninemic) or secondary (hyporeninemic) hypoaldosteronism is present. Human ACTH has a slight stimulatory effect on aldosterone, but the amount of synthetic ACTH given in the stimulation is equivalent to more than <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>days</b> production of natural ACTH, so the aldosterone response can be easily measured in blood serum. Same as cortisol, aldosterone should double from a respectable base value (around 20 ng/dl, must fast salt 24 hours and sit upright for blood draw) in a healthy individual.|$|R
500|$|On December 13, the {{expedition}} reached {{a series of}} treacherous cascades that Timberlake called [...] "Great Falls."

500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed in Cardiff in July 2007. The first meeting between Jack and John at the nightclub was written to be {{akin to a}} Spaghetti Western. Instead of fighting, {{it was decided that}} they would kiss first, so that the {{audience}} [...] "don't see it coming". The following fight scene was intended to be [...] "sexy, rather than brutal", similar to the naked wrestling scene in the film Women in Love. While the scene only lasted one minute on screen, much more was filmed, so much that it took <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>day</b> to shoot. 80% of the acting in the scene was done by Marsters and Barrowman themselves, instead of stuntmen. The style of fighting was similar to what Marsters was used to, and was, according to stunt co-ordinator Tom Lucy, a cross between Western, martial arts, and Bourne.|$|E
6000|$|In the end not a plug {{was to be}} had; and {{deprived}} of a solace and a stimulus, on which sailors so much rely while at sea, the crew became absent, moody, and sadly tormented with the hypos.

They would sit on their chests, forlorn and moping; with a steadfast sadness, eying the forecastle lamp, at which they had lighted so many a pleasant pipe. With touching eloquence they recalled those happier evenings--the time of smoke and vapor; when, after <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>day's</b> delectable [...] "chawing," [...] they beguiled themselves with their genial, and most companionable puffs.|$|R

60|$|Jason {{appointed}} Tiphys to be helmsman {{because he}} was a star-gazer, and knew the points of the compass.

If the sea only happened to be deep enough, however, Lynceus could tell you exactly what kind of rocks or sands were at the bottom of it; and he often cried out to his companions, that they were sailing over heaps of sunken treasure, which yet he was none the richer for beholding. To confess the truth, few people believed him when he said it.|$|R
