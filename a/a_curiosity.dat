5|$|<b>A</b> <b>curiosity</b> is the {{underground}} (formerly ground-level) restored {{portion of the}} Jewish cemetery where 19th-century Rabbi Moses Sofer is buried, located {{at the base of}} the castle hill near the entrance to a tram tunnel. The only military cemetery in Bratislava is Slavín, unveiled in 1960 in honour of Soviet Army soldiers who fell during the liberation of Bratislava in April 1945. It offers an excellent view of the city and the Little Carpathians.|$|E
5|$|Although Paisley was now {{in charge}} of the Liverpool team, Bill Shankly was asked to lead them onto the pitch for the last time. Brian Clough later claimed that he wanted Don Revie {{to do the same for}} Leeds but Revie, who watched the match from a seat in the stand, {{declined}} the offer. <b>A</b> <b>curiosity</b> of the match was that Liverpool had no number 10 shirt and Leeds had no number 11. Phil Boersma and Eddie Gray both wore number 12.|$|E

5|$|Bertie the Brain was {{an early}} {{computer}} game, {{and one of the}} first games developed in the early history of video games. It was built in Toronto by Josef Kates for the 1950 Canadian National Exhibition. The four meter tall computer allowed exhibition attendees to play a game of tic-tac-toe against an artificial intelligence. The player entered a move on a lit keypad in the form of a three-by-three grid, and the game played out on a grid of lights overhead. The machine had an adjustable difficulty level. After two weeks on display by Rogers Majestic, the machine was disassembled at the end of the exhibition and largely forgotten as <b>a</b> <b>curiosity.</b>|$|E
5|$|During that period, general {{relativity}} remained something of <b>a</b> <b>curiosity</b> among physical theories. It was clearly superior to Newtonian gravity, being consistent with special relativity and accounting for several effects unexplained by the Newtonian theory. Einstein himself had shown in 1915 how his theory explained the anomalous perihelion {{advance of the}} planet Mercury without any arbitrary parameters (""). Similarly, a 1919 expedition led by Eddington confirmed {{general relativity}}'s prediction for the deflection of starlight by the Sun during the total solar eclipse of May 29, 1919, making Einstein instantly famous. Yet the theory entered the mainstream of theoretical physics and astrophysics only with the developments between approximately 1960 and 1975, {{now known as the}} golden age of general relativity. Physicists began to understand the concept of a black hole, and to identify quasars as one of these objects' astrophysical manifestations. Ever more precise solar system tests confirmed the theory's predictive power, and relativistic cosmology, too, became amenable to direct observational tests.|$|E
5|$|The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) {{held the}} first major chess tournament for computers, the North American Computer Chess Championship, in September 1970. CHESS 3.0, a chess program from Northwestern University, won the championship. Nowadays, chess {{programs}} compete in the World Computer Chess Championship, held annually since 1974. At first considered only <b>a</b> <b>curiosity,</b> the best chess playing programs have become extremely strong. In 1997, a computer won a chess match using classical time controls against a reigning World Champion for the first time: IBM's Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov 3½–2½ (it scored two wins, one loss, and three draws). In 2009, a mobile phone won a category 6 tournament with a performance rating 2898: chess engine Hiarcs 13 running on the mobile phone HTC Touch HD won the Copa Mercosur tournament with nine wins and one draw. The best chess programs {{are now able to}} consistently beat the strongest human players, to the extent that human-computer matches no longer attract interest from chess players or media.|$|E

25|$|<b>A</b> <b>curiosity</b> of the J-3 is {{that when}} it is flown solo, the lone pilot {{normally}} occupies the rear seat for proper balance, to balance the fuel tank located at the firewall.

25|$|Latrobe's father, who was {{responsible}} for all Moravian schools and establishments in Britain, had an extensive circle of friends in the higher ranks of society. He stressed the importance of education, scholarship, and the value of social exchange; while Latrobe's mother instilled in her son <b>a</b> <b>curiosity</b> and interest in America. From a young age, Benjamin Henry Latrobe enjoyed drawing landscapes and buildings. He was a brother of Moravian leader and musical composer Christian Ignatius Latrobe.|$|E
25|$|Two other quarter-finals {{were also}} decided on penalties. Jan Ceulemans put Belgium ahead against Spain in the 35th minute, but Spanish {{substitute}} Señor equalised with {{five minutes to}} go. No more goals were scored in extra time, and Belgium won the shoot-out 5–4. West Germany and Mexico drew 0–0 after extra time, and the West Germans eliminated the hosts 4–1 on penalties. As <b>a</b> <b>curiosity,</b> the German goalkeeper Harald Schumacher jumped to the right in the three Mexican penalties (stopping two of them).|$|E

25|$|Doughty's single List A {{appearance}} produced <b>a</b> <b>curiosity.</b> Playing in Somerset's first-ever one-day {{match in}} the inaugural Gillette Cup against Glamorgan in 1963, {{he took one}} wicket and then came in to bat at No 10 with Somerset at 121 for eight, chasing a total of 207. Doughty scored 20 and put on 75 for the ninth wicket with Brian Langford, who made 56. In 2009, the stand was still Somerset's ninth-wicket List A cricket record and the oldest surviving List A record.|$|E
25|$|The Rev. Dr Badham {{was more}} {{successful}} as a mycologist, writing a well-received Treatise on the esculent funguses of England, published in 1847. He {{seems to have}} become interested in the subject {{as a result of}} visiting fungus markets in Italy. Eating wild fungi was considered an eccentric and dangerous pastime in England at the time and the book attracted some popular interest, if only as <b>a</b> <b>curiosity.</b> The original edition contained colour plates by the noted mycological illustrator Anna Maria Hussey. A second (posthumous) edition was published in 1863, edited by mycologist Frederick Currey.|$|E
25|$|In horticulture, {{carnivorous}} {{plants are}} considered <b>a</b> <b>curiosity</b> or a rarity, but {{are becoming more}} common in cultivation {{with the advent of}} mass-production tissue-culture propagation techniques. Venus flytraps are still the most commonly grown, usually available at garden centers and hardware stores, sometimes offered alongside other easy to grow varieties. Nurseries that specialize in growing carnivorous plants exclusively also exist, more uncommon or demanding varieties of carnivorous plants can be obtained from specialist nurseries. California Carnivores is a notable example of such a nursery that specializes in the cultivation of carnivorous plants. It is owned and operated by horticulturalist Peter D'Amato.|$|E

25|$|Goddard {{was born}} in Worcester, Massachusetts, to Nahum Danford Goddard (1859–1928), a farmer, and Fannie Louise Hoyt (1864–1920). Robert was their only child to survive; a younger son, Richard Henry, {{was born with a}} spinal {{deformity}} and died before his first birthday. Goddard's family had roots in New England dating to the late 1600s. With <b>a</b> <b>curiosity</b> about nature, he studied the heavens using a telescope from his father and observed the birds flying. A country boy, he loved the outdoors and became an excellent marksman with a rifle. On Sundays the family attended an Episcopal church, and Robert sang in the choir.|$|E
25|$|The chart {{shows that}} the {{long-term}} equinox drift of the Revised Julian calendar is quite satisfactory, at least until 4400AD. The medium-term wobble spans about two days because, like the Gregorian calendar, the leap years of the Revised Julian calendar are not smoothly spread: they occur mostly at intervals of four years but there are occasional eight-year gaps (at 7 out of 9 century years). Evidently each of the authorities responsible for the Gregorian and Revised Julian calendars, respectively, accepted a modest amount of medium-term equinox wobble {{for the sake of}} traditionally perceived leap rule mental arithmetic simplicity. Therefore, the wobble is essentially <b>a</b> <b>curiosity</b> that is of no practical or ritual concern.|$|E
25|$|Coffee was {{introduced}} to Japan by the Dutch in the 17th century, but remained <b>a</b> <b>curiosity</b> until the lifting of trade restrictions in 1858. The first European-style coffeehouse opened in Tokyo in 1888, and closed four years later. By the early 1930s there were over 30,000 coffeehouses across the country; availability in the wartime and immediate postwar period dropped to nearly zero, then rapidly increased as import barriers were removed. The introduction of freeze-dried instant coffee, canned coffee, and franchises such as Starbucks and Doutor Coffee in the late 20th century continued this trend, {{to the point that}} Japan {{is now one of the}} leading per capita coffee consumers in the world.|$|E
