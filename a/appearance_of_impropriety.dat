500|$|Although {{she hears}} nothing from Milda after their night together, she still expects to reunite with her dream man shortly, so she breaks off with Tonda, who storms the {{dormitory}} demanding his ring back. After {{listening to a}} speech by the housemother on the virtues of fidelity and commitment, she packs up her suitcase and arrives on Milda's doorstep in the big city, ready to resume their romance. Milda is not home, and she meets his parents, who {{have never heard of}} her and don't know what they should do with her. Milda comes home very late, and after an evening of comically painful tension and uncertainty, his parents decide it's only decent to put the girl up for the night on the sofa, requiring Milda to climb into bed with them in order to avoid any <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>impropriety.</b> Forman has described this famous scene: [...] "It’s a tight fit. The old man wants to sleep; the son would like to get thrown out so he can join the girl on the couch, but the mother runs the show and won’t tolerate any such filthy ideas under her roof." [...] Andula, kneeling outside the door of their bedroom, overhears the family squabbling, and when it becomes clear to her that she is not valued in the least, she breaks down in tears and, the next morning, returns to her home. She tells her friends about her [...] "wonderful" [...] trip to the capital and how nice Milda's parents were to her, especially his father, and then she returns to work at the factory.|$|E

2500|$|After it {{had been}} {{reported}} in 2006 that Rezko was under federal investigation for influence-peddling, Obama purchased a 10-foot-wide strip of Ms. Rezko's property for $104,500, $60,000 above the assessed value. According to Chicago Sun-Times columnist, Mark Brown, [...] "Rezko definitely did Obama a favor by selling him the 10-foot strip of land, making his own parcel less attractive for development." [...] Obama acknowledges that the exchange may have created the <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>impropriety</b> and stated [...] "I consider this a mistake on my part and I regret it." ...|$|E

Though {{we should all be}} happy to protect and cherish the dear girl, she herself would probably, prefer to be near those whom nature has {{appointed}} her friends.

5000|$|In an {{extensive}} March/April 2013 article in Mother Jones magazine, [...] "The Congressman, the Safari King, and the Woman Who Tried to Look Like a Cat," [...] author Corbin Hiar pointed out <b>appearances</b> <b>of</b> <b>impropriety</b> among ICCF's educational travel to Africa and elsewhere, including evidence that such trips were not properly reported on lobbying reports {{as required by}} law. The article also spotlights ICCF's unwillingness to take a public stand on global warming, the Lacey Act, or other issues that might threaten economic interests of ICCF's corporate members. In a separate interview, ICCF Founder and former President David Barron was also profiled for his business dealings with African political leadership, including the governments of Nigeria and other states during periods of autocratic or dictatorial governments.|$|R

A few months later, Freddie Mac Chief Executive Officer Leland Brendsel was forced out and the committee and subcommittee commenced {{more than a year of}} hearings into Freddie Mac. Emanuel skipped every hearing allegedly for reasons <b>of</b> avoiding any <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> favoritism, <b>impropriety,</b> or conflict <b>of</b> interest.|$|R
2500|$|U.S. {{courts have}} often ruled against {{displays}} of the Ten Commandments on government property. They {{conclude that the}} ten commandments are derived from Judeo-Christian religions, {{to the exclusion of}} others: the statement [...] "Thou shalt have no other gods before me" [...] excludes non-monotheistic religions like Hinduism, for example. Whether the Constitution prohibits the posting of the commandments or not, there are additional political and civil rights issues regarding the posting of what is construed as religious doctrine. Excluding religions that have not accepted the ten commandments creates the <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>impropriety.</b> The courts have been more accepting, however, of displays that place the Ten Commandments in a broader historical context of the development of law.|$|E
2500|$|In 1978 Reno was {{appointed}} State Attorney for Dade County (now called Miami-Dade County). She {{was elected to}} the Office of State Attorney in November 1978 and was returned to office by the voters four more times. Reno ran as a liberal, pro-choice democrat even though Miami-Dade was a conservative county. Reno developed a reputation for ethical behavior, {{going so far as to}} purchase a car at stircker price to avoid the <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>impropriety.</b> She established a Drug Court which was later replicated in other parts of the country. She worked actively in various civic organizations, including the Miami Coalition for a Safe and Drug Free Community and the Beacon Council, which was formed to address Miami-Dade's economic development.|$|E
2500|$|A third kind of jury, {{known as}} a coroner's jury can be convened in some common law {{jurisdiction}} in connection with an inquest by a coroner. [...] A coroner is a public official (often an elected local government official in the United States), who is charged with determining the circumstances leading to a death in ambiguous or suspicious cases. [...] A coroner's jury is generally a body that a coroner can convene on an optional basis {{in order to increase}} public confidence in the coroner's finding where there might otherwise be a controversy. [...] In practice, coroner's juries are most often convened {{in order to avoid the}} <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>impropriety</b> by one governmental official in the criminal justice system toward another if no charges are filed against the person causing the death, when a governmental party such as a law enforcement officer is involved in the death.|$|E
5000|$|Jarvis was {{campaign}} chairman for presidential candidate Gary Bauer in 2000. He resigned the position, and {{as stated in}} Christianity Today: [...] "Charles Jarvis, Bauer's former {{campaign chairman}}, and Tim McDonald, former chief of advance operations, said they resigned from Bauer's campaign because they felt that Bauer was fostering the <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> sexual <b>impropriety</b> by meeting and traveling alone with the deputy manager." [...] He later became an adviser to Steve Forbes in his run for president.|$|R

CED {{is concerned about the}} reality, as well as the <b>appearance,</b> <b>of</b> corporate <b>impropriety.</b> This policy statement examines the state of corporate governance in the United States and offers practical recommendations for restoring public trust in business. Recommendations include: - Making Audit Committees Autonomous and Vigorous - Ensuring that users understand that financial information is based on judgments - Giving Sarbanes-Oxley a chance to work - Taming excessive executive compensation - Using independent nominating committees to select and appraise director...|$|R
500|$|Victoria later {{described}} her childhood as [...] "rather melancholy". Her mother was extremely protective, and Victoria was raised largely isolated from other {{children under the}} so-called [...] "Kensington System", an elaborate set of rules and protocols devised by the Duchess and her ambitious and domineering comptroller, Sir John Conroy, who was rumoured to be the Duchess's lover. The system prevented the princess from meeting people whom her mother and Conroy deemed undesirable (including most of her father's family), and was designed to render her weak and dependent upon them. The Duchess avoided the court because she was scandalised {{by the presence of}} King William's illegitimate children, and perhaps prompted the emergence of Victorian morality by insisting that her daughter avoid any <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> sexual <b>impropriety.</b> Victoria shared a bedroom with her mother every night, studied with private tutors to a regular timetable, and spent her play-hours with her dolls and her King Charles Spaniel, Dash. Her lessons included French, German, Italian, and Latin, but she spoke only English at home.|$|R
2500|$|A {{panelist}} {{chosen by}} Daly would begin the game. If his question elicited a yes answer, he continued questioning. When a question was answered no, questioning {{passed to the}} next panelist and $5 {{was added to the}} prize. The amount of the prize was tallied by Daly who flipped one of 10 cards on his desk. A contestant won the top prize of $50 by giving ten no answers, or if time ran out, with Daly flipping all the cards. As Daly occasionally noted, [...] "Ten flips and they (the panel) are a flop!" [...] Daly later explained, after the show had finished its run on CBS, the maximum payout of $50 was to ensure the game was played only for enjoyment, and that there could never be even the <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>impropriety.</b> Later in the series, Daly would throw all the cards over with increasing frequency and arbitrariness (frequently to give a particularly interesting or worthy panelist the maximum available prize money), evidence the prize was secondary to game play.|$|E
2500|$|White's {{immediate}} successor was Vaughters himself. Shortly afterward, {{the team}} hired Peter Van Petegem as classics advisor, with a short-term contract {{running from the}} beginning of March until Paris–Roubaix on April 10. The timing of the contract was to avoid an <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>impropriety</b> due to Van Petegem's role with the organizers of Omloop Het Nieuwsblad and his own full-time job as an insurance broker. Van Petegem had, in his cycling career, won both Paris–Roubaix and the Tour of Flanders. He also served as a consultant with the [...] team in 2010 helping Alberto Contador learn to ride the cobbles that figured into stage 4 of the 2010 Tour de France. This relationship had proved fruitful as Contador gained time on most of his rivals in that cobbled stage en route to winning the Tour de France; analysis had credited Van Petegem for Contador's success. With Van Petegem in the team car, Garmin-Cervélo won Paris–Roubaix with Johan Vansummeren. A week after Paris–Roubaix, the team hired Eric Van Lancker to a position somewhat in between White's and Van Petegem's in that he was not a short-term hire, but he was also not thought to be White's permanent replacement.|$|E
6000|$|There was {{but little}} further {{conversation}} between them till they reached Lanslebourg, {{at the foot}} of the mountain, at which place they occupied themselves with getting coffee for the two American ladies. The Miss Spaldings took their coffee almost with as much grace as though it had been handed to them by Frenchmen. And indeed they were very gracious,--as is the nature of American ladies in spite of that hardness of which Trevelyan had complained. They assume an intimacy readily, with no <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>impropriety,</b> and are at their ease easily. When, therefore, they were handed out of their carriage by Mr. Glascock, the bystanders at Lanslebourg might have thought that the whole party had been travelling together from New York. [...] "What should we have done if you hadn't taken pity on us?" [...] said the elder lady. [...] "I don't think we could have climbed up into that high place; and look at the crowd that have come out of the interior. A man has some advantages after all." ...|$|E
5000|$|As the Clinton {{administration}} {{came to a}} {{close in}} early 2001, it was discovered that Hugh Rodham received around $400,000 for legal services regarding gaining the Presidential pardon of businessman Glenn Braswell who had been convicted of fraud, and the sentence commutation of drug trafficker Carlos Vignali. [...] While legal experts said that Rodham may well not have done anything wrong, the <b>appearance</b> <b>of</b> possible <b>impropriety</b> certainly existed. Moreoever, coming while the Bill Clinton pardons controversy was already in full force, this was a further embarrassment for the former administration and even got the attention of the Congressional House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. [...] Hillary Clinton, now a newly-sworn-in Senator, said, [...] "He's my brother. I love my brother ... I'm just extremely disappointed in this terrible misjudgment that he made ... I knew nothing about my brother's involvement in these pardons. I knew nothing about his taking money for his involvement." [...] Both Clintons pressured Rodham to return the $400,000, which he promptly did. [...] During this time, Rodham additionally collected media criticism for being overweight and a poor dresser. [...] By 2001 he was working in the law firm of Rodham & Fine in downtown Fort Lauderdale.|$|R
40|$|While {{the ethics}} of the American {{judiciary}} cover a broad spectrum, both good and bad, the general over-all level of judicial ethical performance is relatively high. Most judges are honest and honorable. Where dissatisfaction is apparent, {{it is far more}} frequently directed at judicial competence than at judicial integrity and ethics. Corruption, dishonesty, susceptibility to political pressure, and other ethical lapses are, however, not unknown, and on very rare occasions have been extremely bad. The ethical obligations of the judiciary extend far beyond the basic essentials of honesty, impartiality, and fairness. Judges must not only avoid evil or wrongdoing, but must also avoid any <b>appearance</b> or suspicion <b>of</b> <b>impropriety,</b> both on the bench and in private life. Selected ethical problems are identified together with some of the areas where significant ethical lapses are to be found. While our judiciary has done well in meeting its ethical obligations, improvement is still needed. The best assurance for high ethical performance comes from insistence upon outstanding integrity from those selected for judicial office...|$|R
