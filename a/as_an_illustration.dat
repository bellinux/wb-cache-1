5|$|Although {{used before}} his presidency, Roosevelt used {{military}} muscle several times throughout his two terms {{with a more}} subtle touch to complement his diplomatic policies and enforcing the Monroe Doctrine throughout multiple interventions in Latin America. This included the Great White Fleet, 16 battleships which peacefully circumnavigated the globe <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>illustration</b> of United States' rising yet neutral prestige under Roosevelt's direction.|$|E
5|$|Little {{documentary}} {{evidence of the}} games remains; contemporary and near-contemporary writings mostly record the major details and concentrate on the opening days. The poet Martial gives the most complete and only truly contemporary account {{in the form of}} his De Spectaculis ("On the Spectacles"), a somewhat sycophantic series of epigrams detailing the individual events of the games <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>illustration</b> of Titus' power and benevolence. Much of the work is concerned with praising Titus, and there have been difficulties with authenticating, dating and translating various portions, but Martial does give details of events not covered by other sources and the only known surviving complete record of a gladiatorial combat in the arena.|$|E
5|$|The Brazilian {{system was}} {{relatively}} democratic {{for a period}} during which indirect elections were common in democracies. The income requirement was much higher in the United Kingdom, even after the reforms of 1832. At the time the only nations not requiring a minimum level of income as a qualification for voting were France and Switzerland where universal suffrage was introduced only in 1848. It is probable that no European country at the time had such liberal legislation as Brazil. The income requirement was low enough that any employed male citizen could qualify to vote. <b>As</b> <b>an</b> <b>illustration,</b> the lowest paid civil employee in 1876 was a janitor who earned Rs600$000 annually.|$|E

5|$|The {{solution}} circle may {{be either}} internally or externally tangent {{to each of}} the given circles. An external tangency is one where the two circles bend away from each other at their point of contact; they lie {{on opposite sides of the}} tangent line at that point, and they exclude one another. The distance between their centers equals the sum of their radii. By contrast, an internal tangency is one in which the two circles curve in the same way at their point of contact; the two circles lie on the same side of the tangent line, and one circle encloses the other. In this case, the distance between their centers equals the difference of their radii. <b>As</b> <b>an</b> <b>illustration,</b> in Figure1, the pink solution circle is internally tangent to the medium-sized given black circle on the right, whereas it is externally tangent to the smallest and largest given circles on the left.|$|E

25|$|But Leaf by Niggle {{can also}} be {{interpreted}} <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>illustration</b> of Tolkien's religious philosophy of creation and sub-creation. In this philosophy, true creation is the exclusive province of God, and those who aspire to creation can only make echoes (good) or mockeries (evil) of truth. The sub-creation of works that echo the true creations of God is one way that mortals honour God.|$|E
25|$|Maryland {{remained}} {{part of the}} Union {{during the}} Civil War. President Abraham Lincoln's strong hand suppressing violence and dissent in Maryland and the belated assistance of Governor Hicks played important roles.

25|$|The Elucidarium of Honorius Augustodunensis (c. 1120), an {{important}} manual for {{the instruction of}} lesser clergy, which was translated into Middle English, Old French, Middle High German, Old Russian, Middle Dutch, Old Norse, Icelandic, Spanish, and several Italian dialects, explicitly refers to a spherical Earth. Likewise, the fact that Bertold von Regensburg (mid-13th century) used the spherical Earth <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>illustration</b> in a sermon shows that he could assume this knowledge among his congregation. The sermon was preached in the vernacular German, and thus was not intended for a learned audience.|$|E
25|$|Symbolism {{plays an}} {{enduring}} {{role in the}} telling of a story through painting or other Chinese art. For instance, stars and the moon are important both for religious significance and <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>illustration</b> of Chinese mythology. Symbols used in art may be grouped into four overarching categories: religious imagery, divine and mortal beings, symbols from nature and inanimate objects. Some examples of symbols include bats which means both good wishes and good luck. The moon, aside from religious and mythical connotations, can also mean a month. The particular way an image is depicted has meaning - like a round eyed-cat means it's a night scene.|$|E
