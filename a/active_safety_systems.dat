40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} vision-based <b>active</b> <b>safety</b> <b>system</b> {{targeting}} the blind spot zone of trucks. Each year, these blind spot accidents are responsible for numerous fatalities and heavily injured. Existing commercial systems seem {{not to be able}} to cope with this problem completely. Therefore, we propose a vision-based <b>safety</b> <b>system</b> relying solely on the blind spot camera images. Our system is able to detect all vulnerable road users (VRUs) in the blind spot zone, and automatically generates an alarm towards the truck driver. This inherently is a challenging task. Indeed, such <b>active</b> <b>safety</b> <b>system</b> implicitly requires extremely high accuracy demands at very low latency. These two demands are contradictory, and thus very difficult to unite. However, our real-life experiments show that our proposed active alarm system achieves excellent accuracy results while meeting these stringent requirements. status: publishe...|$|R
30|$|It is a {{powerful}} means to improve vehicle driving safety and stability performances via <b>active</b> <b>safety</b> <b>system</b> such as emergency collision avoidance (ECA), active front steering (AFS), anti-lock braking system (ABS), direct yaw moment control (DYC) and traction control system (TCS) [1 – 6]. They work well only with the tire forces within the friction limit, which means knowledge of the road friction coefficient may improve {{the performance of the}} systems. For example, during a steering process, the lateral tire force is limited by the road friction coefficient. The vehicle would drift out if the vehicle steers severely at a relatively high speed because of limitation of the lateral tire force. If the active control system could estimate the friction limitation at the time driver begins to steer and initiatives to reduce the speed, the lateral dynamics of the vehicle would be improved [4]. Wheel braking under the different road condition, we usually can’t get the real-time value of road friction coefficient, which leads the instability of the whole control process [7, 8]. So road friction coefficient has an important significance in the vehicle chassis electronic control system design. The accurate estimation of the road friction coefficient can facilitate the improvement of the <b>active</b> <b>safety</b> <b>system</b> and attain a better performance in operating vehicle <b>safety</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>Active</b> <b>safety</b> <b>system</b> can automatically adjust the control strategy according to changing of road surfaces with respect to the friction properties, and which can maximize the function of the control system.|$|R
50|$|In engineering, <b>active</b> <b>safety</b> <b>systems</b> are systems {{activated}} {{in response}} to a safety problem or abnormal event. Such systems may be activated by a human operator, automatically by a computer driven system, or even mechanically. In nuclear engineering, active safety contrasts to passive safety in that it relies on operator or computer automated intervention, whereas passive safety systems rely on the laws of nature to make the reactor respond to dangerous events in a favourable manner.|$|E

50|$|However, {{active safety}} is {{increasingly}} {{being used to}} describe systems that use {{an understanding of the}} state of the vehicle to both avoid and minimise the effects of a crash. These include braking systems, like brake assist, traction control systems and electronic stability control systems, that interpret signals from various sensors to help the driver control the vehicle. Additionally, forward-looking, sensor-based systems such as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems including adaptive cruise control and collision warning/avoidance/mitigation systems are also considered as <b>active</b> <b>safety</b> <b>systems</b> under this definition.|$|E
40|$|Path {{prediction}} {{is the only}} way that an <b>active</b> <b>safety</b> <b>system</b> can predict a driver's intention. In this paper, a model-based description of the traffic environment is presented-both vehicles and infrastructure-in order to provide, in real time, sufficient information for an accurate prediction of the egovehicle's path. The proposed approach is a hierarchical-structured algorithm that fuses traffic environment data with car dynamics in order to accurately predict the trajectory of the ego-vehicle, allowing the <b>active</b> <b>safety</b> <b>system</b> to inform, warn the driver, or intervene when critical situations occur. The algorithms are tested with real data, under normal conditions, for collision warning (CW) and vision-enhancement applications. The results clearly show that this approach allows a dynamic situation and threat assessment and can enhance the capabilities of adaptive cruise control and CW functions by reducing the false alarm rate. © 2007 IEEE...|$|R
