5|$|Early in his career, Thurstan {{held the}} prebendary of Consumpta per mare in {{the diocese of}} London, and served both William Rufus and Henry I as a royal clerk. At some point in Thurstan's early career, he visited Cluny, where he vowed to become a Cluniac monk later in his life. Thurstan also served Henry as <b>almoner,</b> and it was Henry who {{obtained}} Thurstan's election as Archbishop of York in August 1114. He was ordained a deacon in December 1114 and ordained a priest on 6 June 1115 by Ranulf Flambard, who was Bishop of Durham.|$|E
5|$|The new {{religious}} orders {{that became a}} major feature of Scottish monastic life in this period also brought new educational possibilities {{and the need to}} train larger numbers of monks. Benedictine and Augustinian foundations probably had almonry schools, charity schools using funds from the <b>almoner</b> to provide a type of bursary to educate young boys, who might enter the priesthood. At the Cluniac Paisley Abbey, secular chaplains were employed as schoolmasters. Some monasteries, including the Cistercian abbey at Kinloss, Sweetheart Abbey and Beauly, opened their doors to a wider range of students to teach the sons of gentlemen. St Andrews, which was both the seat of a bishop and the site of a major Augustinian foundation, had both a grammar school, under the archdeacon, and a song school, under the priory. The foundation of over 100 collegiate churches of secular priests between 1450 and the Reformation would have necessitated the training of large numbers of choristers. Sometimes, as at Lochwinnoch, they were taught both music and grammar. Dominican friars were noted for their educational achievements and were usually located in urban centres, probably teaching grammar, as at Glasgow and Ayr. The number and size of these schools seems to have expanded rapidly from the 1380s. By the end of the Middle Ages, grammar schools could be found in all the main burghs and some small towns.|$|E

The Hospital Almoners' Council {{was established in}} 1907 to handle the selection, training and employment of <b>almoners</b> and changed its name to the Institute of Hospital <b>Almoners</b> in 1922. The two amalgamated as the Institute of <b>Almoners</b> in 1945, and this changed its name to the Institute of Medical Social Workers in 1964.|$|R

25|$|The {{persecution}} of the Huguenots under {{the reign of}} Louis XIV was stopped by the regent, despite those who continued to advocate rigour {{in the treatment of}} the Protestants. Prominent among these was the Archbishop of Rouen, Louis III de La Vergne de Tressan, Grand <b>Almoner</b> of France during the Regency. He argued with both the regent and his most influential minister, Cardinal Dubois, in favour of severe measures against Protestants. They rejected his ideas.|$|E

25|$|King Louis XIV of France had {{previously}} nominated him (in 1653) as Bishop of Poitiers but the nomination was never {{ratified by the}} Holy See. Four years later, (1657) the King {{brought him back to}} France and transferred him to the Archdiocese of Reims but it took a further decade (1667) before the pope confirmed the post. For many years he served as Grand <b>Almoner</b> of the Kingdom of France. In 1661 he was appointed Cardinal-Bishop of Palestrina, the diocese that covered the Barberini family comune of Palestrina.|$|E
25|$|The strong {{conservatism}} of the Jews of Philadelphia and {{the warm}} interest in the higher things of Judaism evinced by the younger men of that city {{may be in a}} large measure directly traced to the influence of Sabato Morais. He was greatly interested in the Alliance Israélite Universelle, and was in constant correspondence with rabbis and scholars in Europe and the Orient. Through his friend Chevalier Emanuel Felice Veneziani, the <b>almoner</b> of Baron de Hirsch, he was enabled to secure timely aid for the agricultural colonies in New Jersey and was the representative of Baron de Hirsch in the Carmel Colony.|$|E
25|$|The Chronicle of Calais {{recorded}} {{the names and}} arrivals of Henry's aristocratic military entourage from the 6 June 1513 onwards. At {{the end of the}} month the army set out for Thérouanne. Shrewsbury commanded the vanguard of 8,000, and Charles Somerset, Lord Herbert the rearward of 6,000. Henry VIII arrived in person at Calais on 30 June 1513 with the main grouping, of 11,000 men. The army was provided by Cardinal Thomas Wolsey as <b>Almoner,</b> and comprised several different types of martial forces including cavalry, artillery, infantry and longbows using hardened steel arrows designed to penetrate armour more effectively. Eight hundred German mercenaries marched in front of Henry.|$|E
50|$|Leonard Chappelow (1683-1768) was an English clergyman and orientalist. Hwe was Sir Thomas Adams's Professor of Arabic at the University of Cambridge, from 1720, for life, {{and also}} Lord <b>Almoner's</b> Professorship of Arabic.|$|R

25|$|In 1694, {{he retired}} from the University. His final years were marked by even more {{financial}} and personal troubles. He became ill, with what physicians identified as either gallstones or kidney stones and he was in considerable pain. His patron the Archbishop Aguiar y Seijas died and Sigüenza lost his lucrative post of Chief <b>Almoner.</b> He also lost the position of University Accountant. The death of his patron the Archbishop was clustered with the death of Sigüenza's father and favorite brother. His dear friend Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz died and he delivered the eulogy at her funeral. In November 1699, Sigüenza was named corregidor general (book examiner) for the Inquisition, a position that paid little and which took up considerable time vetting books for possible heresy.|$|E
25|$|In November 1935, Iyasu's {{death was}} announced. The {{circumstances}} surrounding {{his death and}} his burial place remain shrouded in mystery. One rumour that persists to this day is that Emperor Haile Selassie ordered his guards to kill him. Others dispute this and allege that Iyasu died of natural causes. His grandson and current Iyasuist claimant to the Ethiopian throne, Lij Girma Yohannes, claims that Iyasu's body {{was brought to the}} Church of St. Mark at Addis Ababa's Guenete Leul Palace (since 1961 the main campus of Addis Ababa University) and buried there in secret. Because he had been excommunicated, these claims are extremely unlikely. Another recently published account states that Iyasu was interred in the grave prepared for Emperor Haile Selassie's confessor and <b>almoner,</b> Abba Hanna Jimma, at Debre Libanos. This account contends that, upon the priest's death, Lij Iyasu's remains were moved to the crypt of St. Tekle Haimanot's Church at the monastery, and placed below the tomb prepared for Ethiopia's first Patriarch, Abuna Basilios.|$|E
500|$|Peerson {{then took}} up musical {{studies at the}} University of Oxford. [...] In order to do so, {{he would have had}} to {{subscribe}} to Protestantism. In 1613, he was conferred a Bachelor of Music (B.Mus.) and was appointed Master of the Boys of Canterbury Cathedral. It is possible that he was the [...] "Martin Pearson" [...] who was sacrist at Westminster Abbey from 1623 to 1630. Between June 1624 and June 1625 he returned to St. Paul's Cathedral as <b>almoner</b> and Master of the Choristers; there is also some evidence suggesting he was later made a petty canon. Although all cathedral services ceased at the end of 1642 following the outbreak of the English Civil War, he retained the title of <b>almoner</b> and, along with the other petty canons and the vicars choral, had special financial provision made for him. Peerson is known to have been buried on 16 January 1651 in St. Faith's Chapel under St. Paul's. He therefore died in either December 1650 or, more likely, January 1651.|$|E
50|$|Musgrave {{was elected}} junior fellow in 1812, and senior fellow in 1832. In 1821, though his {{knowledge}} of eastern tongues {{was by no means}} profound, he was appointed Lord <b>Almoner's</b> Professor of Arabic. He was Senior Proctor in 1831.|$|R
50|$|Redford's Will (dated 7 Oct.,proved 29 Nov. 1547) is {{published}} in the Records of Early English Drama. It states that {{he lived with his}} sister Margaret Coxe, most likely in the <b>Almoner's</b> House located {{on the south side of}} St. Paul's cathedral.|$|R
60|$|He greeted Christie kindly, {{and then}} {{addressed}} himself to Mrs. Wilkins on various charitable matters, {{for he was}} a minister at large, and she one of his <b>almoners.</b> Christie could really see him now, for when he preached she forgot {{the man in the}} sermon, and thought of him only as a visible conscience.|$|R
500|$|The {{number of}} {{recipients}} continued {{to track the}} monarch's age. [...] Until the joint reign of William III and Mary II, the recipients were {{of the same sex}} as the monarch. [...] During that reign, each of the monarchs made gifts to poor people of their sex, but after the death of Mary, only men received gifts from King William. [...] Beginning with the reign of George I (1714–1727), both men and women have received gifts, each sex in a number corresponding to the monarch's age, each recipient receiving that number of pence. [...] Despite the monarch's absence, the ceremony was held each year, with the Lord High <b>Almoner</b> or the Sub-Almoner deputising for the sovereign.|$|E
500|$|Charles I rarely {{attended}} the Royal Maundy service. [...] Author Brian Robinson, who traced {{the development of}} Royal Maundy, suggests that after the Restoration, his son Charles II attempted to gain popularity by assiduous attendance (and distribution of money) at the service. [...] Charles II even attended during the plague years of 1661 and 1663. [...] His brother and successor, James II performed the ceremony as well. [...] Although there is a record of William III doing so in 1698, most sources state that James {{was the last to}} wash the feet of the poor himself, in 1685. [...] There is no record of any attendance by a monarch at the Royal Maundy ceremony after 1698 until 1932, but pre-1725 records are vague. [...] The Lord High <b>Almoner</b> continued to perform the pedilavium at the Maundy ceremony until 1737. [...] Today, the only traces of the pedilavium at Royal Maundy are the nosegays and the linen towels worn by several of the officials.|$|E
500|$|Despite Lang's long {{involvement}} with the poorest of society, after becoming Archbishop of York he increasingly detached himself from everyday life. The historian Tom Buchanan wrote that Lang's sympathy with ordinary people was replaced by [...] "an upper class affectation and a delight in the high society in which his office allowed him to move". [...] No archbishop has been as close as Lang to the Royal Family; a Channel Four television history of the British monarchy maintained that Lang [...] "held a view of Christianity in which the monarchy, rather than the cross, stood centre stage as {{the symbol of the}} nation's faith". Successive generations of the Royal Family considered him their friend and honoured him. King George V appointed him to the largely ceremonial post of Lord High <b>Almoner,</b> and after the 1937 Coronation George VI created him a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO), a rare honour which, like the Royal Victorian Chain, lay in the private gift of the Sovereign. A friend, commenting on the transformation of Lang's perspective, said of him: [...] "He might have been Cardinal Wolsey or St Francis of Assisi, and he chose to be Cardinal Wolsey." ...|$|E
25|$|The {{triptych}} The Last Judgment (Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten Antwerpen), {{was commissioned}} by the <b>almoners</b> of the Cathedral of Our Lady, Antwerp in 1525, {{is one of his}} best works in its originality and mastery. The paintings in grisaille on the back were executed by Peter de Kempeneer, who was, at that time, an apprentice in the van Orley's workshop.|$|R
5000|$|In 1893 {{he became}} Lord <b>Almoner's</b> Professor of Arabic at Cambridge {{and held the}} post until 1933 when he died. He never visited any Arab countries, and his {{pronunciation}} of Arabic was thought [...] "weird" [...] by a former student. He was well liked by students and faculty, described as generous, and called a [...] "liberal benefactor" [...] to the college.|$|R
5000|$|In April 1804 {{he settled}} in Bristol. Determining to [...] "be his own executor," [...] he devoted himself to {{dispensing}} charity unostentatiously and through private <b>almoners,</b> {{but on a}} large scale. It is believed that he usually gave away at least £10,000 a year, besides giving £10,500 to trustees to invest in lands in Monmouthshire {{for the benefit of}} Bristol charities.|$|R
