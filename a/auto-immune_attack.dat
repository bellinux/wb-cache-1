It is not known which mechanism(s) accounts for the beneficial effect observed in these diseases. The immunomodulatory effects of IVIg in two different models of T and B cell activation were investigated. IVIg inhibited a predominantly cellular immune response of the Th 1 type, which was partially reversed by addition of Th 1 cytokines. In contrast, in a model, which leads to B cell differentiation and antibody production, a synergistic stimulatory effect of IVIg and Th 2 cytokines was observed. The ability of IVIg to interfere with cell proliferation and to manipulate the Th 1 /Th 2 profile will have consequences for the induction, character, and amplification of an immune response. Apart from the immunomodulatory effects, evidence shows that IVIg promote remyelination not only by abrogation of the <b>auto-immune</b> <b>attack</b> but also by an effect on glial cells. We showed that IVIg induce growth arrest of normal human fibroblasts and Schwann cells. In fibroblasts this growth arrest is accompanied by upregulation of GAS- 3 /PMP- 22 mRNA. The implications of this finding are discussed. Further studies in human Schwann cells are imperative to prove the hypothesis that IVIg directly stimulates remyelinatio...|$|E
40|$|The {{inference}} of gene regulatory networks (GRN) is {{of great}} importance to medical research, as causal mechanisms responsible for phenotypes are unravelled and potential therapeutical targets identified. In type 1 diabetes, insulin producing pancreatic beta-cells are the target of an <b>auto-immune</b> <b>attack</b> leading to apoptosis (cell suicide). Although key genes and regulations have been identified, a precise characterization of the process leading to beta-cell apoptosis has not been achieved yet. The inference of relevant molecular pathways in type 1 diabetes is then a crucial research topic. GRN inference from gene expression data (obtained from microarrays and RNA-seq technology) is a causal inference problem which may be tackled with well-established statistical and machine learning concepts. In particular, the use of time series facilitates {{the identification of the}} causal direction in cause-effect gene pairs. However, inference from gene expression data is a very challenging problem due to the large number of existing genes (in human, over twenty thousand) and the typical low number of samples in gene expression datasets. In this context, it is important to correctly assess the accuracy of network inference methods. The contributions of this thesis are on three distinct aspects. The first is on inference assessment using precision-recall curves, in particular using the area under the curve (AUPRC). The typical approach to assess AUPRC significance is using Monte Carlo, and a parametric alternative is proposed. It consists on deriving the mean and variance of the null AUPRC and then using these parameters to fit a beta distribution approximating the true distribution. The second contribution is an investigation on network inference from time series. Several state of the art strategies are experimentally assessed and novel heuristics are proposed. One is a fast approximation of first order Granger causality scores, suited for GRN inference in the large variable case. Another identifies co-regulated genes (ie. regulated by the same genes). Both are experimentally validated using microarray and simulated time series. The third contribution of this thesis is on the context of type 1 diabetes and is a study on beta cell gene expression after exposure to cytokines, emulating the mechanisms leading to apoptosis. 8 datasets of beta cell gene expression were used to identify differentially expressed genes before and after 24 h, which were functionally characterized using bioinformatics tools. The two most differentially expressed genes, previously unknown in the type 1 Diabetes literature (RIPK 2 and ELF 3) were found to modulate cytokine induced apoptosis. A regulatory network was then inferred using a dynamic adaptation of a state of the art network inference method. Three out of four predicted regulations (involving RIPK 2 and ELF 3) were experimentally confirmed, providing a proof of concept for the adopted approach.

Thermography gives vital information about temperature variations in different parts of a human body. As infection and inflammation causes temperature changes, thermography exists as a valuable tool for monitoring dysfunctions. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an <b>auto-immune</b> disease that <b>attacks</b> and destroys lubricating elements and healthy tissues of joints of fingers, wrist and feet, causing pain and inflammation over there. Present advanced computer technology can be used to automate the analysis and diagnosis of RA using thermal images of affected area. Thermal Image analysis can be utilized to generate statistics that could be used as input parameters to a Neuro-fuzzy network which can predict the presence of RA. This paper propose to derive important statistical parameters from thermal images and a method to auto-detect RA by using statistical parameters with the help of neuro-fuzzy hybrid network...|$|R
40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common endocrine diseases in the world and the incidence is still increasing rapidly. Clinical characteristic of diabetes include hyperglycemia and glucosuria, as a result of relative or absolute shortage in insulin. This is the hormone secreted by the beta-cell in the islets of Langerhans upon elevated blood glucose concentrations after a meal. Where the most prevalent type, T 2 D, is rather considered as a metabolic disease involving insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction, T 1 D, accounting for 5 - 10 % of all diabetic patients, is an autoimmune disease where the body’s own immune system attacks the insulin-secreting pancreatic beta-cells. The mechanisms responsible for loss of tolerance against the beta-cells are not yet completely understood. The immune system is supposed to be of major importance, but more and more evidence point to the beta-cells themselves as active partners in their own destruction. Aspecific inflammation in the islets, indicated as the first trigger for T 1 D, results in upregulation of HLA-I molecules on the surface and release of chemokines and cytokines. In addition, ER and oxidative stress are induced, resulting in beta-cell dysfunction, apoptosis and the generation of molecular changes like alternative splicing and PTMs. This PhD project, with the general objective to study how the interaction between the beta-cell and immune system participates in the development of T 1 D, put specifically the importance of PTMs of beta-cell antigens in the spotlight. In the first project (Chapter 3) we investigated if at early age before onset of insulitis, there are differences in islets of Langerhans from NOD mice compared to two healthy mouse strains namely the NOR mice, showing 88 % sequence similarity with NOD mice, and the more distant C 57 Bl/ 6 mice, that could potentially contribute to an intrinsic higher risk for <b>auto-immune</b> <b>attack</b> or dysfunction. Analysis of the transcriptome and proteome, combined with integrated pathway and network analyses, indicated that islets of NOD mice are subjected to higher levels of stress due to an inefficient supply of energy and by a higher probability that misfolded proteins will accumulate, mainly due to lower expression of PDIA 3, PDIA 4 and PDIA 6, enzymes implicated in S-S bond formation. However, the most remarkable finding in NOD islets at this early pre-insulitic age was the high expression of Padi 2 mRNA. Padi 2 {{is one of the}} five Ca 2 + dependent enzymes responsible for the modification of arginine to citrulline, known as citrullination. This modification that highly impacts protein conformation and HLA binding, is known to be implicated in the generation of autoantigens is several autoimmune diseases, most importantly RA, but also in T 1 D citrullination of GAD 65 results in autoantigen generation. In order to examine both aspects of the interaction between the beta-cell and immune system, the aim of the second project (Chapter 4) was to investigate how inflammation affects the beta-cell proteome resulting in an active contribution to T 1 D development. We build further on a previous finding from our lab that demonstrated PTM of GRP 78 in a rat beta-cell line (INS- 1 E) upon exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines, a model that is used to mimic T 1 D ex-vivo. Further, we characterized this PTM as a citrullination on arginine 510 of GRP 78. In addition, it was also shown that cytokines induce the translocation of GRP 78 from the ER to the plasma-membrane of INS- 1 E cells and mouse islets, a process mediated by ER stress. While intracellularly we identified 3 isoforms of GRP 78, much more modified isoforms of GRP 78 were expressed on the cell surface. Finally, citrullination of GRP 78 results in loss of immune tolerance in diabetic NOD mice by the presence of autoantibodies and auto-reactive T-cells. The aim of the third project (Chapter 5) was to translate these findings from INS- 1 E cells and NOD mice to the human situation. This pointed to a similar PTM of GRP 78 in human islets exposed to pro-inflammatory cytokines in three out of five healthy donors. Furthermore, proteome analysis by LC-MS/MS indicated that inflammation in general induced citrullination and deamidation, another PTM known to be involved in autoantigen generation. The identification of two citrullinated and deamidated peptides of GRP 78 showed evidence for the implication of these PTMs in human islets as well. To investigate the relevance in terms of autoantigen recognition, modified GRP 78 epitopes were designed that were predicted to bind to the T 1 D susceptibility HLA-DR 4 molecule and these peptides were further on used in immunological assays. The first indication for the implication of citrullinated GRP 78 as autoantigen in human T 1 D patients came from the presence of reactive CD 4 + T-cells in infiltrated T 1 D islets. Next, higher CD 4 + T-cell frequencies recognizing a citrullinated epitope were also present in peripheral blood of T 1 D patients compared to healthy controls, indicating a possible application as biomarker for T 1 D. To conclude, this PhD project clearly demonstrated the importance of the interaction that connects beta-cells and immune system in the pathogenesis of T 1 D. PTMs of beta-cell antigens, especially citrullination, appeared to have substantial importance for the break of tolerance. Furthermore, the ability to detect autoreactive T-cells against citrullinated GRP 78 in blood of NOD mice and T 1 D patients emphasizes its possible use as a biomarker and opens the road to the development of new therapeutic applications.
