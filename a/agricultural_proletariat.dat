2500|$|A {{parallel}} {{recovery of}} Sămănătorist views is argued {{to have taken}} place in the Soviet Union's Moldavian SSR, formed from the bulk of the Bessarabia upon the 1940 breakup of Greater Romania. While the local population's cultural identification with Romania was officially discouraged and repressed during the adoption of Moldovenist ideology, the rural aesthetics of Sămănătorism were adapted to the proletarian themes favored by official culture. This phenomenon was later described by literary critic Iulian Ciocan in terms of cultural synthesis: [...] "Sămănătorism was harnessed to the rumbling wagon of proletkultism. The original ideology was, of course, retouched. 'National specificity' was replaced with 'social class specificity', subordinated to 'proletarian internationalism', and the contrast between the idyllic village and the dehumanized city [...] is supplanted by the animosity between the <b>agricultural</b> <b>proletariat</b> and the (petty) bourgeoisie. The working class, attenuating the rift between village and city, is called to the forefront." [...] According to Ciocan, the reaction against this merger was less significant than in Romania, even though postmodern authors also emerged in the Moldavian SSR.|$|E

Especially in Calabria, the party even had a huge influence on the <b>agricultural</b> <b>proletariat</b> and even on farmers. At this point, the party had grown very strong, having become virtually a mass party with 13 federations, 72 sections, numerous public meetings, its implantation in the main industrial centres, its factory press and so forth.|$|E

So was there {{a decline in the}} <b>agricultural</b> <b>proletariat,</b> from 2,100,000 in 1917, to 34,000 only two years later (a decline of 98.5%). But the number of peasant households (not individuals which is many times greater) had risen with the parcelization of land from 16.5 million in early 1918 to over 25 million households by 1920, an increase of some 50%." ...|$|E

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{the relationship between}} the new agricultural classes emerged during the state capitalist transformation of the countryside 1930 - 1980 s. : protobourgeoisie, managers, intellectuals, labor aristocracy, <b>agricultural</b> <b>proletariat.</b> The authors denote a radical change in the type of social relations during that period. Reference is also made to the origins of formation of cross-class relations: the number and the origin of each class, their economic stability, political role, mentality, their ability for 0 class and cross-class solidarity. Separately, the author examines the place and importance of social protest and class struggle as a critical point of interclass relations. The essence of evolution of the social protest movement lied in the transitions from forms attributed to peasant society to manifestations of class struggle, typical for labor community...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{the issues of}} social and psychological thinking of Siberian peasant during the New Economic Policy (NEP) period. In this regard, the author characterized the problems of society, which lived and labored Siberian peasantry, the specificity of the regional development of the area {{they live in the}} context of the overall trend of the New Economic Policy in Russia of the researching period. The publication revealed that the main result of the liberalization of agricultural policy in the New Economic Policy was the creation of a more coherent and strict social structure of the peasantry. In the development of the peasantry formed social groups, characterized by the class approach, according to which the peasantry is divided into poor, <b>agricultural</b> <b>proletariat,</b> the wealthy, the middle peasants, the kulak farms. This article will: extend the basic concepts related to the characteristics of the Siberian peasants used modern historical science, in particular, peasant studies. In addition, scientific findings influence the processes of longterm management study Siberian peasants in the XIX century (including a self-government system), its radical transformation in the Soviet era; contemporary analysis of government policy towards the peasants in the XIX - early XX century and in different time periods of Soviet history of the XX century. The results are qualitatively complement the existing knowledge in the modern historical science in Russia and will be useful in the continuing study of the appeal by the author topic. Particularly relevant is the subject of the article in the context of analysis of the dominant features of the state, to consider the establishment and completion of the process of sovereignty of Siberia, the fight against manifestations of bureaucracy, bribery and embezzlement, as well as the development of political and socio-economic aspects of the new economic policy in Siberia in 1921 - 1929. </p...|$|E
40|$|During {{the period}} 1660 - 1760, Glamorgan was a {{predominantly}} rural and peasant county. Arable and animal husbandry, and their ancillary tasks, provided the only sources of livelihood {{for the majority}} of the people who were concentrated mainly in the mixed farming areas of the lowlands of the Vale, and the Gower peninsula, while the pastoral areas of the Blaenau, or upland districts, sustained only a small community of scattered homesteads. Broadly speaking, the population of the county comprised the landlords, clergy, freeholders, tenant farmers, farm labourers, traders, and rural craftsmen. Occupiers of land, who were neither freeholders nor copyholders, were tenants whose tenure was determined by the nature of their leases. The labourers, however, who constituted the <b>agricultural</b> <b>proletariat,</b> had no legal title to the land, and their only means of livelihood was by selling their labour to those who required it. The numerous physical tasks connected with agriculture were performed within a social environment, conditioned by the established system of landownership. Most family groups lived primarily on what they grew, and made for themselves. Their tools, implements, and household furniture were constructed to serve several generations of the same family, and even their houses and cottages could be regarded as part of their agricultural equipment. Industry and commerce, however, were already exerting their influence upon the life of the county, and by 1760, the Glamorgan landscape had assumed, in many parts, the unmistakable features of industrialism, although, as yet, no industrial revolution was indicated. In the final analysis, agricultural interests, as modified by the industrial and commercial opportunities of the period, still dominated society in Glamorgan in 1760. The story of the transition from the peaceful pursuits of agriculture to the revolutionary development of modern industry was only beginning to unfold...|$|E
40|$|African Studies Seminar series. Paper {{presented}} June, 1981 The {{march of}} capitalism into Africa is often made to appear inexorable. Indeed, {{some scholars have}} defined {{the possibility of a}} failure, a missed possibility of domination, out of existence: the survival of pre-capitalist modes of production are simply a way by which the costs of labor or cash crops are subsidized by subsistence cultivation. But how is one to tell whether the cultivator's access to the soil represents a dangerous automony, a tenacious resistance to becoming subject to industrial work rhythms and control over all aspects of a working life, or else constitutes a perfectly functional part of a superexploitative system?The conditions of rural and urban workers in South Africa is likely to suggest itself in answer to that question. But the best of research in South African labor history has focused on the specific processes by which labor was controlled and has not neglected the persistence of resistance — in individual and daily behaviour in farms and factories as much as in collective action. 2 A look beyond South Africa emphasizes how elusive similar objectives could be, and how essential it is to ask just what kind of transformations capital and the state sought, how they tried to effect them, and what they were unable to do. 3 Much of the literature on the "articulation" of modes of production stresses structural juxtapositions, not processes. And that gets away from the most basic if most difficult aspects of Marx's treatment of capitalism, that it was based on two quite particular and quite well masked forms of coercion: primitive accumulation— the permanent alienation of workers from the means of productionand the labor process itself- the daily struggle to make workers work. Primitive accumulation is not the mere amassing of resources, nor is it legal title to land: it is the effective exclusion of acess to the means of production of an entire class. And to say that means to ask how they were kept away. The labor process itself entails distinct mechanisms—from supervision on the shop floor to the educational system—to control the pace and intensity of labor, which in turn foster distinct patterns of resistance. Our task is not to arrive at a rigid and pristine definition of capitalism, but to look at accumulation and the labor process as the specific and complex phenomena they are. They embody the action of people and institutions, and the consequences of such actions not being complete need to be taken seriously. This study of Zanzibar looks at an attempt that penetrated {{to the heart of the}} labor process, an effort to make slave labor into wage labor. It involved non-white landowners and non-white workers in a British colony, but the division between landowners and workers was no less fundamental for the racial complexity of Zanzibar. British officials were clear that they wanted to make slaves into an <b>agricultural</b> <b>proletariat,</b> but they ended up with a complex system of labor migration, shaped as much by the ex-slaves as by the state or the ex-slaveowners. I have discussed the evidence and details of this process at length elsewhere; my aim here to to discuss some basic issues that it raises in terms that might suggest comparative perspectives...|$|E
