50|$|The Mark 4 is an all-steel coach {{incorporating}} {{a number of}} improvements over the Mark 3 stock - notably the inclusion of <b>automatic</b> <b>push-button</b> operated plug-type doors, in place of manually operated slam-doors, fully sealed gangways and controlled emission toilets (CET). Body shells were built by British Rail Engineering Limited (BREL) and Società Italiana Ernesto Breda.|$|E
25|$|In the {{interior}} the gear selector {{is similar to}} a <b>push-button</b> <b>automatic</b> with buttons labeled P, R, N and D while some earlier models have a gear lever similar to that in cars with manual transmission.|$|R
50|$|Internally, Bristol, like Chrysler before them, by {{then had}} {{felt that the}} safety {{problems}} of <b>push-button</b> <b>automatic</b> transmission were too difficult to counter and thus they shifted to a more conventional lever mounted between the two front seats.|$|R
5000|$|... 1965: Plymouth {{rejoined the}} {{full-sized}} car market {{with the new}} Fury, based on the Chrysler C-body. The intermediate B-body model line became the Belvedere and Satellite for 1965. <b>Push-button</b> <b>automatic</b> transmission controls were replaced with a conventional column- or floor-mounted lever.|$|R
2500|$|For 1956, Plymouth styling {{evolved from}} that of the 1955s. Most notable would be the {{introduction}} of the first <b>push-button</b> <b>automatic</b> transmission to appear in an American automobile, and a more dramatic rear-end treatment highlighted by a pair of rakish tail-fins. In early 1956, the Fury joined the Belvedere line as a special-edition high-performance coupe. [...] Belvedere remained the top full-line series through 1958. In 1956, Plymouth added seat belts.|$|R
50|$|The {{scripting}} interface in SmartDO {{is based}} on Tcl/Tk shell. This makes SmartDO able to link with almost any kind of 3rd party software and in-house code. SmartDO comes with the SmartScripting GUI, for generating Tcl/Tk script automatically. The user can create script by answering questions in the SmartScripting GUI, and SmartScripting will generate Tcl/Tk scripts for the user. The flexible scripting interface allows SmartDO to be customized as a <b>push-button</b> <b>automatic</b> design system.|$|R

50|$|The Mark 1 Chaika, the GAZ M13, {{debuted in}} 1958. It was {{produced}} from 1959 to 1981, with 3,179 built in all. The M13 was {{powered by a}} 195-hp SAE gross 5.5 L V8 and driven through a <b>push-button</b> <b>automatic</b> transmission of a similar design to the Chrysler TorqueFlite unit. It was offered as a saloon (GAZ 13), limousine (GAZ 13A), and four-door cabriolet (GAZ 13B) with an electrohydraulic top. The cabriolet was made in 1961 and 1962 for official parades.|$|R
50|$|Changes for 1965 {{were largely}} {{confined}} to the front fascia and to trim, and replacement of the <b>push-button</b> <b>automatic</b> transmission gear selection system with a more conventional steering column-mounted shift lever. The split grille was gone, replaced by a large chromed crossbar and surround, and the headlights were inset into the grill behind glass covers (similar to that year's Chrysler 300 and New Yorker models) with etched horizontal lines imitating the grill. As pointed out by the sales literature, 100-year-old Claro Walnut trim {{was added to the}} interior. Production totaled 18,409.|$|R
50|$|The DeSoto Firesweep {{was also}} {{produced}} in Australia from 1958 to 1960. Production of the 1958 model began at Chrysler Australia’s Mile End facility in South Australia in early 1958, utilizing CKD components imported from Detroit. It was {{offered as a}} four-door sedan with a 350-cubic-inch V8 engine. The 1959 Firesweep, which was released in July 1959, was also assembled from CKD components, and was equipped with a 361-cubic-inch V8 engine and a <b>push-button</b> <b>automatic</b> transmission. The Firesweep was replaced on the Australian market in 1960 by the locally produced Dodge Phoenix.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} domain-specific {{approach}} to generate high-performance hardware-software partitioned implementations of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The partitioning strategy is a heuristic {{based on the}} DFT’s divide-and-conquer algorithmic structure and fine tuned by the feedback-driven exploration of candidate designs. We have integrated this approach in the Spiral linear-transform code-generation framework to support <b>push-button</b> <b>automatic</b> implementation. We present evaluations of hardware-software DFT implementations running on the embedded PowerPC processor and the reconfigurable fabric of the Xilinx Virtex-II Pro FPGA. In our experiments, the 1 D and 2 D DFT’s FPGA-accelerated libraries exhibit between 2 and 7. 5 times higher performance (operations per second) and up to 2. 5 times better energy efficiency (operations per Joule) than the software-only version.

25|$|The Plymouth Belvedere {{was also}} {{produced}} by Chrysler Australia. The first model, {{based on the}} 1953 US Plymouth, featured {{a high level of}} Australian content, with body panels pressed in Chrysler Australia's Keswick facility in South Australia and matched with a 217.8 cubic inch (4107cc) side-valve six-cylinder engine, imported from Chrysler UK. It was produced as a four-door sedan and as a locally developed two-door coupe utility, along with similar Cranbrook and Savoy models, until it was replaced by the Chrysler Royal in 1957. The Belvedere was reintroduced to the Australian market in early 1958 when Chrysler Australia began assembling the current model Belvedere four-door hardtop which was imported from the US in knocked-down form. The 1959 model was equipped with a 318 cubic inch V8 engine and <b>push-button</b> <b>automatic</b> transmission. Chrysler Australia replaced their Plymouth Belvedere, Dodge Custom Royal and De Soto Firesweep models with the Dodge Phoenix in 1960.|$|R
