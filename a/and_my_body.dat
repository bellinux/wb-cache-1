The subject reported he saw red spots passing before his eyes and red-purple spots on the floor, and the floor seemed very close to his face. Within 2 minutes these visual effects were gone, and replaced by a yellow haze, {{as if he were}} looking through a lens filter.|$|E
25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>body</b> became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it seemed to me that they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E
500|$|On 8 March 1870, Schottlaender {{abducted}} the 17-year-old Bond {{on her way}} to sing at {{a church}} service, took her to a friend's house and forced her to stay the night with him. [...] Schottlaender convinced her that she was [...] "compromised" [...] and that they must marry. [...] The next day, she was taken to Manchester, where they were married. The marriage was a terrible experience for Bond, and she became pregnant and ill. [...] "He ill-treated both my mind <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>body,</b> he denied me every comfort, often I had not even enough to eat. [...] To add to my wretchedness, the inevitable baby was coming. ... He had been violently ill-treating me, I was a broken, pitiful creature." [...] Her family persuaded her to leave him after ten months of marriage. Bond contracted smallpox from the doctor who attended her, but she recovered. The baby, Sidney John Arthur Schottlaender, was born on 7 May 1871 and died on 18 June 1871, six weeks later. The couple lived separately for several years, and Bond finally divorced her husband in 1874. Bond stated in her divorce petition that she had been knowingly infected with a communicable disease by her husband.|$|E

2500|$|Originally, [...] "Good for You" [...] was not {{intended}} to be the lead single from Revival. Michaels and Tranter thought the song would [...] "never be a single in a million years", and was better suited as an album track, though Gomez insisted: [...] "Nope, this is my first single, motherfucker". Interscope CEO John Janick also questioned its strength as a lead single, as well as Gomez's collaboration with Rocky, which he felt may be perceived as odd. Gomez did not want the lead single to be [...] "the obvious, huge song", and instead wanted it to set the tone for Revival and a new phase in her artistry. In an interview for iHeartRadio, she explained: [...] "I have become more comfortable with my sexuality, and who I am, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>body,</b> and I feel really proud of that. That's why it was the one to kick off the album". As a result, besides serving as the first single from the album, the song also was the first by Gomez to be released through Interscope and Polydor Records. She created anticipation for its release, posting several teasers in her Instagram account. On June 12, 2015, the singer announced that the song would be released ten days later.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the campaign, Sun Quan had two boxes made to {{hold the}} heads of Huang Zu and Su Fei (蘇飛). After Huang Zu's defeat, Su Fei was also {{captured}} and he immediately asked someone to inform Gan Ning. Gan Ning said, [...] "If Su Fei did not speak up, I'd have forgotten about him." [...] Later, when Sun Quan and his officers were celebrating the victory, Gan Ning left his seat and knelt down before his lord. He kowtowed until his face was covered in blood and with tears in his eyes, he pleaded with Sun Quan, [...] "I owe Su Fei a favour. If not for him, I'd have been dead <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>body</b> abandoned in a ravine. I'd {{not have been able}} to serve under you. Now, even though Su Fei's actions warrant death, I still hope you can spare him." [...] Sun Quan was moved and he asked, [...] "What if he leaves after I spare his life?" [...] Gan Ning replied, [...] "Su Fei will be grateful if he is spared from death. He'll not leave even if you try to chase him away. Why would he still seek his own doom? If he really does that, I'm willing to use my head to replace his in the box." [...] Sun Quan then pardoned Su Fei.|$|E
2500|$|... "So Emotional", [...] "Love for All Seasons" [...] and [...] "Somebody's Somebody" [...] {{incorporate}} strong {{elements of}} R and soul. [...] "So Emotional" [...] is a midtempo gospel-inspired number {{talking about a}} man who has got Aguilera [...] "on the ropes." [...] "Love for All Seasons" [...] is a pop track which is musically similar to Carey's [...] "Always Be My Baby" [...] (1996), while [...] "Somebody's Somebody", in which Aguilera sings about being secure in one's arms, features drums snap, bass pops, and a gospel organ in the bridge. Aguilera sings about a woman longing to reveal her true self on [...] "Reflection", which Partridge characterized it as the song that [...] "sums up the album." [...] "Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)" [...] is deemed the most [...] "sexual" [...] track on Christina Aguilera, a hip hop-influenced song which features a rap verse written by Aguilera herself. [...] "When You Put Your Hands On Me", an R song co-written by Robin Thicke, addresses the alchemy of sex: [...] "I just know / when you put your hands on me / I feel sexy / <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>body</b> turns to gold." [...] "Blessed" [...] features elements of gospel, while [...] "Love Will Find A Way" [...] features an R groove and was compared to Carey's songs [...] "Emotions" [...] (1991) and [...] "Dreamlover" [...] (1993). On the final song, [...] "Obvious", Aguilera wonders whether her confusion about her life is apparent to everyone.|$|E
