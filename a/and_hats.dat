5|$|Pottery {{and weaving}} {{are among the}} very first art forms {{showcasing}} Filipino artistic design and are evident from cave dwellings all over the country. Among these are mostly anthropomorphic earthenware jars dating from c. 5BC to 225AD. Weaving was mostly done by women, using fibers from abaca, pineapple, cotton, and bark to make clothes, rugs <b>and</b> <b>hats.</b> Baskets were mostly utilized to carry grain and other foods.|$|E
5|$|Textiles {{from the}} most {{utilitarian}} to the most luxurious are made from animal fibres such as wool, camel hair, angora, cashmere, and mohair. Hunter-gatherers have used animal sinews as lashings and bindings. Leather from cattle, pigs and other species is widely used to make shoes, handbags, belts and many other items. Animals have been hunted and farmed for their fur, to make items such as coats <b>and</b> <b>hats,</b> again ranging from simply warm and practical to the most elegant and expensive.|$|E
5|$|The Confederates {{were also}} celebrating what they {{considered}} a victory, as crowds of spectators gathered {{along the banks of}} the Elizabeth River, cheering and waving flags, handkerchiefs <b>and</b> <b>hats</b> as Virginia, displaying the captured ensign of Congress, passed along up the river. The Confederate government was ecstatic and immediately promoted Commander Buchanan to Admiral.|$|E

5|$|Stephanie Marie McMahon {{was born}} on September 24, 1976 in Hartford, Connecticut to Linda and Vince McMahon. She has one brother, Shane McMahon. Soon after her birth, {{the family moved to}} Greenwich, Connecticut. There, she {{attended}} the selective Greenwich Country Day School, throughout her elementary school years. At the age of 13, McMahon appeared in World Wrestling Federation (WWF) merchandise catalogs, modeling T-shirts <b>and</b> <b>hats.</b> After graduating from Greenwich High School in 1994, she attended Boston University and in 1998 earned a degree in Communications. After graduating in 1998, she began working for the WWF full-time.|$|E
5|$|The Germans placed {{candles on}} their {{trenches}} and on Christmas trees, then continued the celebration by singing Christmas carols. The British responded by singing carols of their own. The two sides continued by shouting Christmas greetings to each other. Soon thereafter, there were excursions across No Man's Land, where small gifts were exchanged, such as food, tobacco and alcohol, and souvenirs such as buttons <b>and</b> <b>hats.</b> The artillery {{in the region}} fell silent. The truce also allowed a breathing spell where recently killed soldiers could be brought back behind their lines by burial parties. Joint services were held. In many sectors, the truce lasted through Christmas night, continuing until New Year's Day in others.|$|E
5|$|The {{plastic arts}} are also {{widespread}} throughout the island. In {{addition to the}} tradition of silk weaving and lamba production, the weaving of raffia and other local plant materials {{has been used to}} create a wide array of practical items such as floor mats, baskets, purses <b>and</b> <b>hats.</b> Wood carving is a highly developed art form, with distinct regional styles evident in the decoration of balcony railings and other architectural elements. Sculptors create a variety of furniture and household goods, aloalo funerary posts, and wooden sculptures, many of which are produced for the tourist market. The decorative and functional woodworking traditions of the Zafimaniry people of the central highlands was inscribed on UNESCO's list of Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2008.|$|E

5|$|Terns {{and their}} eggs {{have long been}} eaten by humans and island colonies were raided by sailors on long voyages since the eggs or large chicks were an easily {{obtained}} source of protein. Eggs are still illegally harvested in southern Europe, and adults of wintering birds are taken as food in West Africa and South America. The roseate tern is significantly affected by this hunting, with adult survival 10% lower than would otherwise be expected. In the West Indies, the eggs of roseate and sooty terns {{are believed to be}} aphrodisiacs, and are disproportionately targeted by egg collectors. Tern skins and feathers have long been used for making items of clothing such as capes <b>and</b> <b>hats,</b> and this became a large-scale activity {{in the second half of}} the nineteenth century when it became fashionable to use feathers in hatmaking. This trend started in Europe but soon spread to the Americas and Australia. White was the preferred colour, and sometimes wings or entire birds were used.|$|E

The practice accelerated under Pope Nicholas V (r. 1447–1455), who used the gifts to promote a military alliance against the Ottoman Empire.|$|E

The unusually large formation constants result from close face-to-face contact between two planar π-planes of porphyrins <b>and</b> <b>HAT</b> derivatives. The redox potentials of porphyrins <b>and</b> <b>HAT</b> derivatives measured by cyclic voltammetry indicate that porphyrins <b>and</b> <b>HAT</b> derivatives act as electron donors and acceptors, respectively. Formation of 1 : 1 CT complexes between porphyrins <b>and</b> <b>HAT</b> derivatives was {{examined by the}} UV-vis, fluorescence and 1 H NMR measurements in nonpolar solvents. The occurrence of unprecedented ultrafast photoinduced electron transfer from the porphyrin unit to the HAT unit in the CT π-complex was observed by femtosecond laser flash photolysis measurements. Highly linear aggregate composed of a planar porphyrin <b>and</b> an <b>HAT</b> derivative was observed by TEM and AFM...|$|R
