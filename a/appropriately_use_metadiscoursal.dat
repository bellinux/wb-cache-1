40|$|In this study, {{the writer}} {{discussed}} about logical connectors showing additive, contrastive, cause and effect, and sequence in the students’ exposition text. This study {{is classified as}} descriptive study. Here, the writer found that {{the most frequently used}} connectors showing additive were ‘and’, ‘also’, ‘such as’, ‘for example’, and the least frequently used connector was ‘in other words’. The writer found that the most frequently used connectors showing contrastive were ‘but’, ‘however’, ‘even though’, ‘although’, and the least frequently used connectors were ‘yet’, ‘though’, ‘instead’. She found that the most frequently used connectors showing cause and effect were ‘because’, ‘if’, ‘so’, ‘because of’, and the least frequently used were ‘as’, ‘due to’, ‘and if’. She also found that the most frequently used connectors showing sequence were ‘when’, ‘while’, ‘after’, and the students applied other various kinds of logical connectors to show sequence in their hortatory exposition text. In her study, the writer found that the most <b>appropriately</b> <b>used</b> connector showing additive was connector ‘and’. The least <b>appropriately</b> <b>used</b> connector was connector ‘in other words’. The most <b>appropriately</b> <b>used</b> connector showing contrastive was connector ‘but’. The students only made mistakes in using connector ‘although’. As a result, the writer concluded that the students could apply logical connectors showing contrastive very well. The writer found that the most <b>appropriately</b> <b>used</b> connector showing cause and effect was ‘because’ and the least <b>appropriately</b> <b>used</b> connector showing cause and effect was connector ‘then’ ix The last category of logical connector that the writer analyzed was logical connectors showing sequence. The most <b>appropriately</b> <b>used</b> logical connector showing sequence was connector ‘when’ and the least <b>appropriately</b> <b>used</b> logical connectors were ‘eventually’, ‘the second’, ‘in the summary’...|$|R

40|$|Like {{conversation}} and other modes of communication, {{writing is a}} rich medium for gender performance. In fact, writing functions to construct the disciplines {{as well as the}} gender of its practitioners. Despite the significance of author gender, as one constitutive dimension of any writing, it has been relatively under-researched. One way, by means of which author gender is practiced, and revealed in written discourse, is the incorporation and <b>use</b> of <b>metadiscoursal</b> categories. Examining 20 applied linguistics research articles (10 written by native male English writers and 10 written by native female English writers), the present study sought to examine whether male and female native English writers differed in their <b>use</b> of <b>metadiscoursal</b> elements. For this purpose, Hyland’s (2005) model of metadiscourse was employed as an analytical framework to identify the type of metadiscoursal elements. The results of Independent samples t-test showed that English male and female writers did not differ significantly in their overall use of metadiscourse; but, significant differences were observed in categorical distribution of metadiscoursal elements. The findings of the study can provide a sound basis for the development of pedagogical materials...|$|R
