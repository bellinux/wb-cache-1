40|$|In {{a method}} and an X-ray test system for testing {{identical}} components {{by means of}} X-rays, <b>a</b> first reference <b>data</b> <b>record</b> (R 4) is calculated from a plurality of similar test <b>data</b> <b>records</b> (P 1 to P 11) which were each determined for a component {{by means of the}} X-ray test system. In order to test a subsequently produced component, the reference <b>data</b> <b>record</b> (R 4) is compared to <b>a</b> test <b>data</b> <b>record</b> (P 12) of said component. Thereafter, <b>an</b> updated reference <b>data</b> <b>record</b> (R 5) is calculated from said test <b>data</b> <b>record</b> (P 12) and previously determined test <b>data</b> <b>records</b> (P 1 to P 11) and, again in order to test a subsequently produced component, is compared to <b>a</b> test <b>data</b> <b>record</b> (P 13) of said component.

40|$|In {{a method}} and an {{evaluation}} device {{for determining the}} position of a structure located in an object to be examined by means of X-ray computer tomography, <b>a</b> cutting <b>data</b> <b>record</b> is determined from <b>a</b> volume <b>data</b> <b>record</b> of the object, said cutting <b>data</b> <b>record</b> representing the object in a cutting plane.

In order to determine the position, <b>a</b> distance <b>data</b> <b>record</b> (<b>A)</b> is generated such that each distance voxel (a) of the distance <b>data</b> <b>record</b> (<b>A)</b> is associated with a distance value (w) which characterizes the smallest distance of the respective distance voxel (a) to the surface voxels (f). Subsequently, the distance voxels (a) corresponding to the structure voxels (s) are determined and the associated distance values (w) are evaluated. By determining a minimum value of the distance values (w), for example the smallest distance of a cooling duct to the surface of a piston can be determined...|$|R

If the {{distribution of}} the estimates were known then the variance might provide a sensible measure of condence. Accordingly we consider here procedures for using <b>a</b> single <b>data</b> <b>record</b> to generate <b>a</b> distribution of parameter estimates...|$|R
50|$|Pseudonymization is a {{procedure}} {{by which the}} most identifying fields within <b>a</b> <b>data</b> <b>record</b> are replaced {{by one or more}} artificial identifiers, or pseudonyms. There can be a single pseudonym for a collection of replaced fields or a pseudonym per replaced field. The purpose is to render the data record less identifying and therefore lower customer or patient objections to its use. Data in this form is suitable for extensive analytics and processing.|$|E
50|$|A {{call detail record}} (CDR) is <b>a</b> <b>data</b> <b>record</b> {{produced}} by a telephone exchange or other telecommunications equipment that documents {{the details of a}} telephone call or other telecommunications transaction (e.g., text message) that passes through that facility or device. The record contains various attributes of the call, such as time, duration, completion status, source number, and destination number. It is the automated equivalent of the paper toll tickets that were written and timed by operators for long-distance calls in a manual telephone exchange.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} {{to a set of}} Management Instruments as described above, an HPI Resource may also provide up to four additional management capabilities. These Resource-level capabilities are essentially special Management Instruments, of which there may be at most one of each type supported by a Resource. Whether or not a particular Resource provides these miscellaneous capabilities and to which Entity they apply are described in <b>a</b> <b>data</b> <b>record</b> accessible by the HPI user for the Resource. A single Entity Path is defined in that record, so any of these capabilities, if present, will apply to the same Entity.|$|E

50|$|The IBM Conversational Monitor System (CMS) {{component}} of VM/370 uses a separate flat file system for each virtual disk (minidisk). File data and control information are scattered and intermixed. The anchor {{is a record}} called the Master File Directory (MFD), always located in the fourth block on the disk. Originally CMS used fixed-length 800-byte blocks, but later versions used larger size blocks up to 4K. Access to <b>a</b> <b>data</b> <b>record</b> requires two levels of indirection, where the file's directory entry (called a File Status Table (FST) entry) points to blocks containing a list of addresses of the individual records.|$|E
50|$|Another {{important}} {{difference is that}} MAPPER data {{is a form of}} visible-record data; what you see is literally what you get. Within an individual drawer, reports all have the same line length, which is padded with spaces if not filled. By the same token, column sizes within <b>a</b> <b>data</b> <b>record</b> are fixed, unlike Excel where you can type hundreds of characters into a small field unless limited by data validation. This is both a strength and a weakness of MAPPER- due to the fixed sizes, the position of any section of the data on disk can be calculated, but the data must be able to be expressed in fixed-format fields.|$|E
50|$|D6 HDTV VTR is SMPTE {{videocassette}} standard. A D6 VTR {{can record}} and playback HDTV video uncompressed. The only D6 VTR product is the Philips, now Thomson's Grass Valley's Media Recorder, model DCR 6024, {{also called the}} D6 Voodoo VTR. The VTR was a joint project between Philips Digital Video Systems of Germany and Toshiba in Japan. The Tape deck module was designed and made by Philips in Weiterstadt, Germany. (formerly Bosch Fernseh). and the Digital Processor module designed and made by Toshiba. Since there is no data compression, after 20 tape copies of multi generations there is no noticeable loss of quality. As a very high-end, costly system about 70 were sold to high-end post houses from about 2000 to 2005. The VTR had <b>a</b> <b>Data</b> <b>Record</b> option. The Data Module could record and play back 2k DPX files at 6 frames per second over a HIPPI connection. The VTR could come in a data only model, or with a switch module, so the record deck {{could be used for}} both video and data recording. The tape deck was also sold stand alone as a Giga Bit Recorder to record and playback raw data. Toshiba made the video tape for the VTR, the high price of the video tape, limited the use of the VTR.|$|E
