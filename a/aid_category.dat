This dissertation explored two questions in aid growth literature: first, whether different forms of aid affect economic growth differently and, second, whether the effect of committed aid on economic growth differs from effect of disbursed aid on economic growth. Estimation results suggest that effect of different aid categories on economic growth differs quantitatively and qualitatively. Qualitatively, the results suggest that the positive effects of one <b>aid</b> <b>category</b> may be offset by negative effects of another <b>aid</b> <b>category.</b> Comparison of the committed and disbursed aid estimation results suggests that committed and disbursed aid differ in their effect on growth for pre- 2001 period; however, their effects are similar for post- 2001 period. This implies that aid growth studies should be careful in choosing their aid measures, especially for the pre- 2001 period...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{assessed}} whether {{mental health}} services for youths differ with respect to medical assistance <b>aid</b> <b>category.</b> METHODS: Computerized claims for 15, 507 youths with Medicaid insurance in a populous county of a mid-Atlantic state were used to establish population-based prevalence estimates of mental disorders and psychotherapeutic treatments during 1996. RESULTS: An analysis of service claims revealed that the prevalence of mental disorders among youths enrolled in foster care (57 %) was twice that of youths receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI; 26 %) and nearly 15 times that of other youths receiving other types of aid (4 %). Rates of mental health service use were pronounced among foster care youths aged 6 to 14 years. Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depression, and developmental disorders were the most prevalent disorders. Stimulants, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants were the most prevalent medications. CONCLUSIONS: Youths enrolled in foster care and youths receiving SSI use far more {{mental health services}} than do youths in other aid categories.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the efficiency of the Swiss hearing aid dispensing system, and to determine factors contributing to successful hearing aid provision. A national cross sectional survey was performed using a postal questionnaire with 8707 adult hearing aid owners (response rate 62 %). To correct results for a potential non-response bias, 193 randomly selected non-respondents were contacted by telephone. Data on hearing loss and type of hearing aid were provided by the hearing aid dispensing practice. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify determinants of non-regular use and dissatisfaction. Eighty-five percent used their device(s) regularly, 12 % only occasionally and 3 % never. Eighty percent were satisfied with their aids. Non-regular use of hearing aids was significantly associated with age, gender, regional language, total duration of use, type of amplification, hearing <b>aid</b> <b>category,</b> hearing loss, and dissatisfaction with and difficulties in managing the aid. Dissatisfaction was associated with regional language, total duration of use, difficulties in managing the aid, and non-regular use.

40|$|This article evaluates {{changes in}} the use of drug {{services}} and the corresponding costs when the conventional fee-for-service system for reimbursement of pharmacists under Medicaid is replaced by a capitation system. The fee-for-service system usually covers ingredient costs plus a fixed professional dispensing fee. The capitation system provided a cash payment (which varied by <b>aid</b> <b>category</b> and season of the year) per Medicaid eligible the first of each month. We exam-ined drug use and costs in two experimental rural counties during a 1 -year preperiod in which the fee-for-service form of reimbursement was employed, as well as a 2 -year postperiod in which the capitation system was used. We compared the results with use and cost patterns in two other rural counties which remained on the fee-for-service system during the same 3 -year period. Drug use was similar among control and experimental coun-ties with the exception of nursing home patients; use in this category decreased under capitation and increased under fee-for-service. Using three measures of drug cost: 1) average cost of a day's drug therapy; 2) average drug costs per recipient; and 3) average Medicaid expenditures for drug services per recipient, we observed significant savings under the capitation reim-bursement system as compared to the fee-for-service system. We attributed savings under capitation to shifts in prescribing and dispensing behavior, as well as changes in use by nursing home patients. Based upon these findings, the total savings resulting from implementing capitation would be approxi-mately 16 percent when compared to fee-for-service reimburse-ment...|$|E

Using the GMM-SYS approach to dynamic panel estimator we test the three main competing specifications in the aid and growth literature for a sample of aid recipient countries over the 1974 - 2001 period.

40|$|The paper uses an aid {{disaggregation}} {{approach to}} {{examine the impact of}} different aid modalities on the fiscal sector of the aid-recipient country. It uses time-series data on different types of development aid (project aid, programme aid, technical assistance and food aid) for Uganda, an important aid recipient in recent years, to estimate a model of fiscal response in the presence of aid which combines aid heterogeneity and endogenous aid. The empirical findings clearly suggest the importance of the above approach for delving deeper into aid effectiveness issues since different <b>aid</b> <b>categories</b> have different effects on key fiscal variables-an impact that could not be revealed if a single figure for aid were employed. Project and food aids appear to cause a reduction in public investment whereas programme aid and technical assistance are positively related to public investment. The same applies for government consumption. A negligible impact on government tax and non-tax revenues, and a strong displacement of government borrowing are also found.

40|$|It {{continues}} to be heavily disputed whether foreign aid promotes economic growth in developing countries. In most cross-country regressions, aid is considered effective only if it shifts recipient countries to a significantly higher and sustainable growth path. We apply an alternative approach which is less demanding, based {{on the concept of}} temporary growth accelerations suggested by Hausmann, Pritchett and Rodrik. In assessing what can reasonably be expected from the donors' modest aid efforts, we do not only employ aggregate aid data but we also differentiate between major <b>aid</b> <b>categories,</b> including grants, loans and so-called short-impact aid. It turns out that aid flows have a small but significantly positive effect on the conditional probability of growth accelerations. This result holds across different estimation methods. Short-impact aid is found to be more effective in this respect, while we reject the view that grants are superior to loans. To the contrary, we find a stronger effect of loans. Furthermore, aid has become more effective {{during the second half of}} our sample. Typically, however, the significance of results crucially depends on the criteria applied to identify growth accelerations...|$|R
40|$|This project {{estimates}} the first sub-national model {{of foreign aid}} allocation and impact. Newly geocoded aid project data from Malawi is used in combination with multiple rounds of living standards data to predict the allocation of health aid, water aid, and education aid. In addition, the impacts of the three <b>aid</b> <b>categories</b> are detected using both instrumentation and propensity score matching methods to adjust for aid being allocated non-randomly. The three allocation models varied greatly {{with respect to the}} significant predictive covariates of diarrhea incidence, geographic region, and rural setting, but other aid allocation was a positive predictor in all three models such that areas receiving health aid were likely to also receive substantial water aid and education aid. A significant, positive effect of health aid on decreasing disease severity and a significant, positive effect of water aid on decreasing diarrhea incidence were found through both instrumentation and propensity score matching. An appropriate instrument for education aid could not be determined, but propensity score matching methods found a positive effect of education aid on school enrollment. These results suggest that foreign aid plays a useful role in poverty alleviation in Malawi and that governments should use information about local disease severity, diarrhea incidence, and school enrollment to allocate different aid types more efficiently.

In addition to poverty, this report looks at the demographic composition of these districts, and percentage of English language learners. Historically on Long Island, as elsewhere, {{there has been a}} large funding gap between school districts with high poverty and those with little poverty. The funding gap, as examined by The Education Trust and others, documents the difference in educational opportunity between school districts. In order to make this calculation it is necessary to both examine expenditures per pupil and student need (as measured by the proportion of student poverty). Policy makers and researchers across the spectrum agree that it generally costs more to provide equivalent educational opportunity to students from poor households as those from middle class or wealthier households. This report factors student poverty into the measurement of the funding gap.

At this stage, before a full grammar is available, only surface cues are available to the learner.

In this paper, we add sentence type as an observed feature to a model of syntactic category acquisition, based on experimental evidence showing that pre-syntactic children are able to distinguish sentence type using prosody and other cues.
