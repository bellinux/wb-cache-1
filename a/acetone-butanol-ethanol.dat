40|$|ABSTRACT 1 -Butanol is a large-volume, {{intermediate}} chemical with favorable {{physical and chemical}} properties for blending with or directly substituting for gasoline. The per-volume value of butanol, as a chemical, is sufficient for investing into the recom-mercialization of the classical <b>acetone-butanol-ethanol</b> (ABE) (E. M. Green, Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 22 : 337 – 343, 2011) fermenta-tion process. Furthermore, with modest improvements in three areas of the ABE process, operating costs can be sufficiently de-creased to make butanol an economically viable advanced biofuel. The three areas of greatest interest are (i) maximizing yields of butanol on any particular substrate, (ii) expanding substrate utilization capabilities of the host microorganism, and (iii) reduc-ing the energy consumption of the overall production process, in particular the separation and purification operations.
