TIGR/myocilin (MYOC) gene mutations are found in 4 % of all POAG patients. Populations with frequent founder effects, such as the French-Canadians, offer unique advantages to implement genetic testing for the disorder. To assess molecular diagnosis for POAG in this population, we determined the prevalence of TIGR/MYOC mutations in 384 unrelated glaucoma patients, 38 ocular hypertensive subjects and 18 affected families (180 patients). We further analyzed the clinical features associated with these variations. Nine coding sequence variants were defined as mutations causing mostly, but not exclusively, POAG. Four families segregated distinct mutations (Gly 367 Arg, Gln 368 Stop, Lys 423 Glu and Pro 481 Leu), while 14 unrelated glaucoma patients harbored six known mutations (Thr 293 Lys, Glu 352 Lys, Gly 367 Arg, Gln 368 Stop, Lys 423 Glu and Ala 445 Val) and two novel (Ala 427 Thr and Arg 126 Trp).

Following voices of the discourse {{are included in the}} study: eight teachers, curriculum texts, a journal for the profession and a journal för scholors. Teachers combine several aims in their teaching of literature. They use literature to discuss life, gender and problems related to young people, text as faction. But, they also try to teach their students about narrathology and how to understand and interpretate fictional texts, text as fiction and a world of signs. The curriculum, however, means that literature is read only to gain knowledge about the world,oneself and other people.

Research in subject matter didactics can investigate teaching, relate different aims to different outcomes and show possibilities for teaching literature and reading comprehension.

At present the watershed is facing the problem of land use changes from agricultural to non-agriultural ones, leading to the situation of decreasing staple foods. This research is aimed at studying regional variation in the potentials of the research area of the production of staple foods according toland use forms and coverage. Informastion on land use forms and coverage are obtained from the statistical record issued by the Statistical Office of Central Java province and Yogyakarta Speial Provine. As the productivity data on every land use forms are not readily available, the <b>assement</b> on the regional potential is executed {{on the basis of}} land use intensity and its apability to produce staple foods. The research reveals that the greatest portion (59 %) of lands in 54 subdistrict in the watershed are highly potential for staple foods production and the rest (41 %) are not potential to moderately potential for staple foods production purpose. The potential for staple foods production in {{the upper part of the}} Progo river basin are higher than that in lower part ones. The presence on irrigated land is not always highly potential for staple food production. Although the availability of irrigation water is strongly decisive factor for food prodution (r = 0. 661 significant at 99. 99 percent), but the presence of built up areas are strongly dictated the potential for food production (r = - 0, 787 significant at 99. 99 percent). The research further shows that the higher the potential for food production, the higher population size (r = 0. 791) significant at 99. 99 percent). In general it can be concluded that 1) the potentials for food production are determined by the available of irrigation water and the size of the built areas, and 2) the number of population is dictated by the presence of water and potentials for food production...|$|E
40|$|The <b>assement</b> of {{chemical}} persistence {{is an important}} part of legislative protection of the environment and human health. Of the vast number {{of chemical}}s on the market today few have been properly assessed. The coordination between testing guidelines from different frameworks is limited and especially the methods for determination of biodegradation show poor reproducibility because of their highly complex nature. In order to circumvent the multifactorial assessment methods that involve the use of e. g. soils and sediments an attempt to create a new approach to chemicals assessment was postulated by Green and Bergman in 2005. This approach puts the focus on testing the chemical reactivity of the compound in environmentally relevant transformation/degradation reactions, i. e. reduction, oxidation, hydrolysis-substitution-elimination (hse), radical reactions, and photolysis. These tests are to be performed in controlled abiotic laboratory experiments ensuring that the results reflect the transformation rate of the intended type of reaction for the investigated substance. To achieve an assessment of the presistence of the compound, the test results are then combined with data on physicochemical properties of the compound and a mathematic matrix describing the reactive power of the different types of reactions in each environmental compartment (air, water, soil, and sediment). Thus far methods for testing of oxidation, photolysis, and hydrolysis-substitution-elimination reactions have been developed. Within this thesis a method for determining reduction was developed and further utilised to determine transformation products from reductive debromination of the three nonabrominated diphenyl ethers. The previously established method for hse was evaluated and further developed in a study of selected chlorobenzenes. Some novel brominated flame retardants were investigated using the previously developed photolysis method, and transformation products and quantum yields were determined. All of the papers presented within this thesis intend to build on the project of a new persistency assessment model. The results presented also contributes important information on the properties and transformation of some common organohalogen pollutants. At the time of the doctoral defense, the following papers were unpublished and had a status as follows: Paper 1 : Submitted. Paper 4 : Manuscript...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to test some antecedents that {{influence}} Universiti Malaysia Kelantan Staff Performance. Design/methodology/approach – A research model based on questionnaire gleaned from the literature was used to collect data through a purposive sampling technique, whereby only those who are working in Universiti Malaysia Kelantan were targeted. The data collected were analysed using structural equation modelling technique with the use of partial least squares approach. Findings – Results show that two out of three antecedents are significant predictors for influencing Job Performance. This paper provides further evidence on the <b>Assement</b> Questionnaire of Dr Talcott Parsons, Dr. Shamim and other related researchers. Research limitations/implication – First, this study cannot be generalized to all other organizations, as the respodents are confined to local university staffs and education industry. Therefore, the results cannot be generalized to organization in other industries. Second, the study is carried out in a relatively new university with lacking of advanced facilities and only a single organization, which is Universiti Malaysia Kelantan in this case. As such, the research neds to be replicated to examine the robustness of the findings across a wider range of organization and samples. Practical Implication – The findings suggest that Job Performance appears to be influenced by Training and Organization Culture but not Working Environment. In a relatively new university, working environment effect is a little bit lower than those two another. This show that a solid training and organization culture might help in pushing up Job Performance even the another contributing factor, working environment is sub-par in a new workplace with lack of facilities and support. Anyway, it is vital for increases working environment in order to keep track of other far better education institution with full facilities and comfortable workplace if Universiti Malaysia Kelantan is looking to be one of the top local universities. Originality/value – This paper adds to the existing literature of Job Performance in a relatively new organization setting. Although there has been some research on the same issue, but it is more on a well-established organization and mostly not education industry...|$|E
40|$|Expert pour l'étude de cas française. Case study on: {{challenges}} to solidarity policies in France, overview of relevant cash benefits; <b>assement</b> of the initiatives to improve take-up. This study will investigate how Member States are introducing reforms {{to ensure that}} monetary social benefits reach those most in need, and, {{in the face of}} restricted budgets, how effective the implementation of these reforms is. The first part of the study will identify and describe gaps between eligibility and take-up of various monetary social benefits, the groups most effected by non-take-up, and the main barriers to accessing benefits. The second part will explore how welfare systems and initiatives by governments and NGOs have promoted effective take-up of benefits and describes the experiences of providers and beneficiaries. The importance of the topic is highlighted by the European Commission’s Social Investment Package (SIP), which calls for each MS to invest more in the proper design, implementation and assessment of social policies. Measures can be compensatory or preventative and may seek to improve take-up through changing the system and delivery, or by improving beneficiaries’ individual capabilities in accessing benefits. The study will document the efficiency as well as the effectiveness of four recent measures to improve the take-up of monetary benefits for vulnerable groups. In particular, it will describe at least one recent initiative that aimed to remove inefficiencies by simplifying claim procedures and at least one other measure that effectively improved access to benefits and the actual take-up of benefits (where the focus may be less on efficiency). Lot 3 covers 15 countries (Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Slovakia, Slovenia) that are in a middle position in terms of benefit recipiency rates and benefit amounts between “elitist” Southern Member States and “universalist” Nordic states, according to Oorschot (2013). The impact of the welfare system on poverty (measured as the percentage reduction in the poverty rate when comparing poverty before and after transfers) shows considerable variation across these countries (Table 1). The Southern and the Baltic states within the group tend to perform poorly (similarly to Spain or Romania), while Austria, France, Ireland and the Visegrad countries are relatively effective in reducing poverty (similarly to Denmark or Sweden) ...|$|E
40|$|Trabalho realizamos uma análise do discurso médico sobre o aleitamento materno, durante a década de oitenta, após a implementação do PNIAM, em 1981, a partir de pesquisas em artigos do Jornal de Pediatria, a fim de compreender como ocorreram as modificações discursivas e institucionais sobre este tema. Atualmente encontramos inúmeras pesquisas sobre aleitamento materno, frutos da valorização da amamentação pela sociedade. No entanto, nem sempre o aleitamento foi valorizado e incentivado como nos dias atuais. Ao longo da história, o discurso médico refletiu o contexto vigente e serviu de sustentação aos interesses políticos sociais e econômicos. Modificou-se como parte de um processo, de uma construção. A análise do jornal revelou o predomínio da lógica higienista, sustentada por um discurso biologicista que naturalizou e disseminou a ideia de superioridade do leite materno. Com o objetivo de convencer os profissionais, instituições e a própria mulher, encontramos posições que refletem, sobretudo, as repercussões sociais decorrentes da entrada da mulher no mercado de trabalho. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to make an <b>assement</b> of the medical discourse approach on breastfeeding during the 1980 s, after implementation of the PNIAM National Program to Incentive Breastfeeding in 1981. Articles published in the Journal of Pediatrics were reviewed in order to gain insight on the discourse changes and public policy changes concerning the subject. The larger number of studies on breastfeeding available nowadays are imputed to the value placed on breastfeeding by society. Nevertheless, breastfeeding has not always been valued as it is today. Throughout the times, the medical discourse has reflected the at that point current context, serving political, social and economic interests. The general notion of breastfeeding has changed, seen as part of a process, of a construct. The inspection of the journals articles gas revealed the prevalence of the hygienist logics, supported by a biology-based discourse, which made natural and disseminated the notion of breastfeeding practices as superior when compared to other infant nutrition practices. The study concluded tha in order to convince health care workers, institutions and mothers, approaches to breastfeeding today reflect especially the social implications of the presence of women in the job market...|$|E
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the participation {{and acceptance of}} an intensivated surveillance program for women with high familial mamma- and ovarian-cancer risk. The results where compared with the recommendations developed by the German Consortium of hereditary Breast- and Ovarial cancer. We tested the feasability of the surveillance program and its acceptance in women. Women with risk for familial Breast- or Ovarian-carcinoma need an intensivated surveillance program. An intensivated program, including different imaging methods {{can lead to a}} an early tumor diagnosis and consequently reduce morbidity and mortality in these patients. The goal is a standardized surveillance program for women with heredetary breast- and ovariancarcinoma in specialized centers, where due to intersdisciplinary cooperation an optimal treatment is archieved. A total of 102 women, age 21 to 61 years, referred to the special consultation hour for familiar breast cancer at the obstretic and gynecology clinic, Charite-Campus Mitte where interviewed via phone. The prevention behaviour was compared with the recommendations for early recognition of the german consortium, developed for high risk patients. Also subjective risk <b>assement,</b> empiric estimated risk and psychological stress were objected. Only 34 (33, 3 %) women performed an optimal surveillance according to the recommendations of Schmutzler [60]. The majority performed irregular surveillance or did not take advantage of all diagnostic procedures. Women with extremely high familial breastcarcinoma exposition presented in 71, 4 % an insufficient or sufficient Surveillance. Women with a medium risk in familial breastcarcinoma performed optimal surveillance. Patients with high familial risk develop feelings of helplessless and loss of control. In contrast to patients with a low risk for familial breast carcinoma signs of rejection are predominant. Highest acceptance has the gynecological breast observation with 77, 5 %, Breast Ultrasound has the lowest acceptance. Even after consulatation and detailed information about the individual age specific risk for breast carcinoma the subjective personal risk was overestimated. This overestimation does not induce a intensivated surveillance. The high-risk women have to be encouraged to perform intensivated screening. Also the psychological distress has a srong influence on the precaution behaviour. The more psychological distress the women had, the worse the precaution behaviour and vice versa. Therefore it is necessary to consult high risk women more than once to convince them about the necessity of an intensivated regular surveillance program. A continuos medical, psycholigical and genetic support should be archieved. High quality standards of the surveillance methods should be archieved to contribute to the morbidity and mortality reduction...|$|E
