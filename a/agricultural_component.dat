40|$|Humanitarian {{demining}} is a calamity of war affecting many {{third world}} countries. Mines are cheap weapons, built to sustain horrible injuries that target active {{people with a}} knock-on effect upon economic growth. The clearing is time consuming and expensive. Clearing is an engineering duty and the humanitarian goal is a technical challenge.

Excluding a semi-arid area of the southwest used for grazing the parkland and mixed prairie areas of the province are used for crop production, mixed farming and dairying.

Wheat is the most familiar crop but other grains like canola, alfalfa, barley flax, mustard, vegetable farms, forage seed, potatoes rapeseed, rye, oats, peas, lentils, canary seed, and barley are also grown.

40|$|Agroforestry {{is a term}} which {{describes}} systems in which trees, animals and/or crops are grown together in intimate mixtures. The term does not include farm woodlands which do not involve significant biological or environmental interactions between the woodland and <b>agricultural</b> <b>components.</b> A number of papers in this volume have discussed the possibility of increasing timber production in Cumbria, in response to Britain's present high rate of timber imports and excess agricultural production. Agroforestry could contribute to this increased timber production in a manner which would be attractive to the farming community because land would sustain a significant agricultural income whilst the trees were maturing. There are several types of agroforestry. Silvoarable systems are mixtures of trees and crops, while silvopastoralism describes intimate mixtures of trees and animals. Agrenforestry is a term used here to emphasize the co-production of bioenergy crops with agricultural and timber crops. Agrenforestry, described later in more detail, could involve strips of energy coppice amongst agricultural crops, {{or the use of}} coppice beneath wide-spaced standard trees.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the poverty impacts of global merchandise trade reform {{by looking at}} {{a wide range of}} developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Overall, we find that trade reform tends to reduce poverty primarily through the inclusion of <b>agricultural</b> <b>components.</b> The majority of our developing country sample experiences small poverty increases from non-agricultural reforms. We explore the relative poverty-friendliness of agricultural trade reforms in detail, examining the differential impacts on real after-tax factor returns of agricultural versus non-agricultural reforms. This analysis is extended to the distribution of households by looking at stratum-specific poverty changes. Our findings indicate that the more favorable impacts of agricultural reforms are driven by increased returns to peasant farm households’ labor as well as higher returns for unskilled wage labor. Finally, we examine the commodity-specific poverty impacts of trade reform for this sample of countries. We find that liberalization of food grains and other processed foods represent the largest contributions to poverty reduction. More specifically, it is tariff reform in these commodity markets that dominates the poverty increasing impacts of wealthy country subsidy removal.

40|$|ABSTRACT Simulations for root growth, crop growth, and N uptake in agro-hydrological {{models are}} of {{significant}} concern to researchers. SWMS_ 2 D {{is one of}} the most widely used physical hydrologically related models. This model solves equations that govern soil-water movement by the finite element method, and has a public access source code. Incorporating key <b>agricultural</b> <b>components</b> into the SWMS_ 2 D model is of practical importance, especially for modeling some critical cereal crops such as winter wheat. We added root growth, crop growth, and N uptake modules into SWMS_ 2 D. The root growth model had two sub-models, one for root penetration and the other for root length distribution. The crop growth model used was adapted from EU-ROTATE_N, linked to the N uptake model. Soil-water limitation, nitrogen limitation, and temperature effects were all considered in dry-weight modeling. Field experiments for winter wheat in Bouwing, the Netherlands, in 1983 - 1984 were selected for validation. Good agreements were achieved between simulations and measurements, including soil water content at different depths, normalized root length distribution, dry weight and nitrogen uptake. This indicated that the proposed new modules used in the SWMS_ 2 D model are robust and reliable. In the future, more rigorous validation should be carried out, ideally under 2 D situations, and attention should be paid to improve some modules, including the module simulating soil N mineralization...|$|R
