5|$|Around 180 BCE the Indo-Greek king Agathocles issued some coinage bearing {{images of}} deities {{that are now}} {{interpreted}} as being related to Vaisnava imagery in India.

According to Bopearachchi, the headdress {{on top of the}} deity is actually a misrepresentation of a shaft with a half-moon parasol on top (chattra).|$|E

5|$|Folk {{tales and}} myths {{sometimes}} contain mythological hybrids; the Minotaur was {{the offspring of}} a human, Pasiphaë, and a white bull. More often, they are composites of the physical <b>attributes</b> <b>of</b> two or more kinds of animals, mythical beasts, and humans, with no suggestion {{that they are the}} result of interbreeding, as in the centaur (man/horse), chimera (goat/lion/snake), hippocamp (fish/horse), and sphinx (woman/lion). The Old Testament mentions a first generation of half-human hybrid giants, the Nephilim, while the apocryphal Book of Enoch describes the Nephilim as the wicked sons of fallen angels and attractive women.|$|E
5|$|Mallana (Mallikaarjuna) of Andhra Pradesh and Mailara of Karnataka are {{sometimes}} identified with Khandoba (Mallari, Malhari, Mairaj).

Devotees emphasize that Khandoba is a full avatar of Shiva, and not a partial avatar like Bhairava or Virabhadra. He accepts the <b>attributes</b> <b>of</b> the demon king— his horse, weapons and royal insignia.|$|E
5|$|Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and <b>Attributes</b> <b>of</b> the Deity is an 1802 work of Christian apologetics and {{philosophy}} of religion by the English clergyman William Paley (July 1743 – 25 May 1805).

5|$|Russia saw the Black Sea {{coast and}} {{the border with}} Turkey as {{invaluable}} strategic <b>attributes</b> <b>of</b> Georgia. Russia had more vested interests in Abkhazia than in South Ossetia, since the Russian military presence on the Black Sea coast was seen as vital to Russian influence in the Black Sea. Before the early 2000s, South Ossetia was originally intended {{as a tool to}} retain a grip on Georgia.|$|E
5|$|Some have {{interpreted}} Bahá'u'lláh's writing style {{to conclude that}} Bahá'u'lláh had claimed divinity. Bahá'u'lláh, however, states himself that the essence of God will never descend into the human world. Statements where Bahá'u'lláh speaks with the voice of God are meant {{that he is not}} actually God, but that he is speaking with the <b>attributes</b> <b>of</b> God.|$|E

Sifjar, {{the wife of}} Thôrr, for the ON. too has a pl. sifjar meaning cognatio, sifi amicus (OHG. sippio, sippo), sift genus, cognatio. By this sense of the word, Sif would appear to be, like Frigg and Freyja, a goddess of loveliness and love; as <b>attributes</b> <b>of</b> Oðinn and Thôrr agree, their wives Frigg and Sif have also a common signification.|$|E
50|$|Literal meaning {{must also}} be {{distinguished}} from factual meaning. Literal meaning is an <b>attribute</b> <b>of</b> statements that are either analytic or empirically verifiable. Factual meaning is an <b>attribute</b> <b>of</b> statements that are meaningful without being analytic. Thus, statements that have factual meaning {{say something about the}} real world.|$|R
40|$|Visual {{specification}} of software is gaining popularity, however its usage is restricted {{by the lack}} of precise semantics of visual languages. In this the-sis a method for representing the semantics of visual languages by means <b>of</b> <b>attribute</b> models is introduced. <b>Attribute</b> models <b>of</b> a wide class of visual scheme languages are defined, higher-order attribute models that allow syn-thesizing recursive, branching or cyclic programs are explained. Dynamic evaluation <b>of</b> <b>attributes</b> is used. Three kinds of deep semantics of schemes are presented as different ways <b>of</b> usage <b>of</b> <b>attribute</b> models <b>of</b> schemes. The implementation <b>of</b> <b>attribute</b> semantics <b>of</b> visual languages is done in the sys-tem CoCoViLa. The features of specification language <b>of</b> <b>attribute</b> models <b>of</b> schemes and visual classes, as well as the realization <b>of</b> <b>attribute</b> evaluation technique are presented. 1...|$|R

5|$|The Hunter fleet endured several {{attempts}} to procure successor aircraft to the type; {{in the case}} of the Dassault Mirage III this had been due to excessive cost overruns and poor project management rather than the <b>attributes</b> <b>of</b> the Hunter itself. A second attempt to replace the Hunter resulted in a competition between the French Dassault Milan and the U.S. LTV A-7 Corsair II. Although the A-7 was eventually chosen as the winner, it would not be purchased and further 30 refurbished Hunters (22 F.58As and eight T.68 trainers) were purchased in 1974 instead.|$|E
5|$|The iconographical <b>attributes</b> <b>of</b> Shiva are {{the serpent}} around his neck, the adorning {{crescent}} moon, the holy river Ganga flowing from his matted hair, the third eye on his forehead, the trishula as his weapon and the damaru. He is usually worshipped in the aniconic form of Lingam. Shiva is a pan-Hindu deity, revered widely by Hindus, in India, Nepal and Sri Lanka.|$|E
5|$|The philosopher Aristotle was {{the most}} {{influential}} scholar of the living world from classical antiquity. Though his early work in natural philosophy was speculative, Aristotle's later biological writings were more empirical, focusing on biological causation and the diversity of life. He made countless observations of nature, especially the habits and <b>attributes</b> <b>of</b> plants and animals {{in the world around}} him, which he devoted considerable attention to categorizing. In all, Aristotle classified 540 animal species, and dissected at least 50. He believed that intellectual purposes, formal causes, guided all natural processes.|$|E
