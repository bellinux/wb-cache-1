5|$|From 1670 to 1672, Newton lectured on optics. During {{this period}} he {{investigated}} the refraction of light, demonstrating that the multicoloured spectrum {{produced by a}} prism could be recomposed into white light by a lens and a second prism. Modern scholarship has revealed that Newton's analysis and resynthesis of white light owes <b>a</b> <b>debt</b> <b>to</b> corpuscular alchemy.|$|E

40|$|This paper elaborates on the {{relationship}} between sustainability of public debt and the <b>debt</b> <b>to</b> GDP ratio in case the interest rate on public debt exceeds the growth rate of GDP. When the primary surplus relative to GDP positively reacts <b>to</b> <b>a</b> higher <b>debt</b> <b>to</b> GDP ratio, <b>a</b> bounded <b>debt</b> <b>to</b> GDP ratio guarantees sustainability. Further, <b>an</b> unbounded <b>debt</b> <b>to</b> GDP ratio is not compatible with sustainability, even if the primary surplus relative to GDP strictly rises as the <b>debt</b> <b>to</b> GDP ratio increases. Finally, sustainability is excluded if the initial <b>debt</b> <b>to</b> GDP ratio exceeds a critical threshold. Public Debt, Primary Surplus, Inter-temporal Budget Constraint, Sustainability...|$|R

Whitmore has already funded a successful effort to retrieve the journal as repayment of <b>a</b> <b>debt</b> <b>to</b> Milo's grandfather, recruiting Milo to lead an expedition to Atlantis, as soon as he receives it.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} part, titled Payback, Atwood {{examines}} ecological debt. She recounts {{the journey of}} Scrooge in A Christmas Carol but placed in a modern setting. The modern-day Scrooge is visited by the spirits of Earth Day. In the past Scrooge witnesses debts to nature being repaid through animal and human sacrifices and through pestilence in over-crowded or unsustainable populations. In the present Scrooge witnesses current unsustainable practices, over-fishing and deforestation, creating <b>a</b> <b>debt</b> <b>to</b> nature being repaid through effects on the climate and impacts on people. Finally, in the future, Scrooge is shown two versions: one, an eco-friendly human society balanced with environmental systems, and the other, a dystopian future with a disaster affecting the fuel or food resources {{in such a way}} that hyperinflation sets in and renders money useless.|$|E
5|$|Becoming a Peking opera {{performer}} {{requires a}} long and arduous apprenticeship beginning from an early age. Before the 20th century, pupils were often handpicked {{at a young age}} by a teacher and trained for seven years on contract from the child's parents. Since the teacher fully provided for the pupil during this period, the student accrued <b>a</b> <b>debt</b> <b>to</b> his master that was later repaid through performance earnings. After 1911, training took place in more formally organized schools. Students at these schools rose as early as five o'clock in the morning for exercises. Daytime was spent learning the skills of acting and combat, and senior students performed in outside theatres in the evening. If they made any mistakes during such performances, the entire group was beaten with bamboo canes. Schools with less harsh training methods began to appear in 1930, but all schools were closed down in 1931 after the Japanese invasion. New schools were not opened until 1952.|$|E

5|$|On 1 March, Jesé {{returned}} to the Santiago Bernabéu {{for the first time}} ahead of Las Palmas' La Liga encounter with Real Madrid. During the build-up to the match, he revealed that he owed <b>a</b> <b>debt</b> <b>to</b> Real Madrid for welcoming him at the club and blamed the cruciate ligament injury he suffered as the reason for him not becoming a star with them. He also defended his previous criticism of former manager José Mourinho, stating that he has no regrets over his actions. Jesé started in the match between the two sides which ultimately ended in a 3–3 draw. He scored his first goals for the club four days later, netting a brace in a 5−2 league win over Osasuna. The result was Jesé's first win with Las Palmas, after the club failed to record a victory in its previous five matches following his arrival. He ultimately made 16 appearances for the campaign, scoring three goals and registering an assist as the side dropped to end the season in fourteenth position. Upon the conclusion of Jesé's loan agreement, Las Palmas elected not to attempt to sign him permanently, with his poor overall performance, high salary demands and off-field behaviour ultimately contributing to the club's decision.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} the frieze may be sought in the Attic relief {{sculpture}} of the late fifth century; this resonance also may be discovered to some degree in the public works of the Hephaisteion frieze and the Nike Athena balustrade, where the imagery of the seated deities and the sandal-binder respectively, likely owes <b>a</b> <b>debt</b> <b>to</b> the Parthenon. There also are traces found on the private commissions of grave stelae from the period, for example, the “cat stele” from Aegina bears a distinct similarity to figures N135–6. As does the Hermes of the four-figure relief known from a Roman copy. Later classicizing art of the Hellenistic and Roman eras also looked to the frieze for inspiration as attested by the Lycian Sarcophagus of Sidon, Phoenicia, the Ara Pacis Augustae, the Gemma Augustea, and many pieces of the Hadrianic generation.|$|E
5|$|The {{main focus}} of the Exchequer was the {{collection}} of royal revenue {{as part of the}} greater Exchequer, which was officially undertaken by the Lord High Treasurer. The Exchequer was unique in having jurisdiction in matters of both equity and the common law, the latter initially curtailed after the Magna Carta and reserved for the Court of King's Bench and Court of Common Pleas, although it later grew back. This process of common law and equity was reversed; during the 16th century the Exchequer was solely a common law body, with the equity jurisdiction only again becoming relevant {{near the end of the}} Tudor period. W. H. Bryson argues that this happened during the reign of Edward I. By 1590 the Exchequer's jurisdiction over equity cases was confirmed, and it was handling a significant number a year, including disputes over trusts, mortgages, tithes and copyholds; since taxation was ever-present, it was not difficult to show that the dispute prevented the payment of <b>a</b> <b>debt</b> <b>to</b> the monarch, allowing the Writ of Quominus.|$|E

25|$|In France, social liberal {{theory was}} {{developed}} in the Third Republic by solidarist thinkers, including Alfred Fouillée and Émile Durkheim, who were inspired by sociology and influenced radical politicians like Léon Bourgeois. They explained that a greater division of labor caused greater opportunity and individualism, but it also inspired a more complex interdependence. They argued that the individual had <b>a</b> <b>debt</b> <b>to</b> society, promoting progressive taxation to support public works and welfare schemes. However, they wanted the state to coordinate rather than to manage and they encouraged cooperative insurance schemes among individuals. Their main objective was to remove barriers to social mobility rather than create a welfare state.|$|E
