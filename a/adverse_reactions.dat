5|$|After Morton Mintz {{broke the}} story in July 1962, there was a {{substantial}} public outcry. The Kefauver Harris Amendment was passed unanimously by Congress in October 1962 to strengthen drug regulation. Companies were required to demonstrate the efficacy of new drugs, report <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> to the FDA, and request consent from patients participating in clinical studies.|$|E
5|$|Topical tick {{medicines}} may be {{toxic to}} animals and humans. The synthetic pyrethroid insecticide Phenothrin {{in combination with}} the hormone analogue methoprene was a popular topical flea and tick therapy for felines. Phenothrin kills adult ticks, while methoprene kills eggs. However, some products have been withdrawn, while others are known to cause <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions.</b>|$|E

In 1986, Millett stopped taking lithium without <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions.</b> After one lithium-free year, Millett announced the news to stunned family and friends.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{emphasizes}} on {{implementation of the}} <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reaction</b> reporting and monitoring system, in the Dermatology department of Kasturba Hospital, Manipal, by a clinical pharmacist, using different promotional activities. Documented <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions</b> were assessed and analyzed for incidence, purpose of visit, types, drug classes, individual drug causing <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions,</b> type of cutaneous reaction, and various predisposing factors. Management and outcome of the <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions</b> were also studied. <b>Adverse</b> drug <b>reactions</b> were also assessed for causality, using Naranjo&#x 2032;s scale, severity, and preventability, using Hartwig et al. scale. <b>Adverse</b> drug <b>reaction</b> attributes to 77 &#x 0025; of the hospital visit. Incidence of reported cutaneous <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions,</b> were 2. 85 &#x 0025;. Majority of the <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions</b> (96 &#x 0025;) were of type B. Antibiotics (30 &#x 0025;), were the common class of drugs, causing a cutaneous <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions.</b> Maximum number of <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions</b> were due to Acetaminophen, Amoxicillin, antitubercular drugs, and Phenytoin. Most of the <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions</b> were managed by withdrawal of drug (81 &#x 0025;), and 58 &#x 0025; patients were recovered from the reaction. Naranjos scale classifies, 29 as probable, 21 as possible, and 3 as definite <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions.</b> Most of the <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions</b> were of moderate severity, however 13 <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions</b> were severe.

Rarely, severe life-threatening reactions may occur in predisposed individuals, such as patients with asthma or atopic dermatitis, and may be characterized by respiratory distress, facial swelling, and even death.|$|E
5|$|The {{seeds of}} apples contain {{small amounts of}} amygdalin, a sugar and cyanide {{compound}} known as a cyanogenic glycoside. Ingesting small amounts of apple seeds will cause no ill effects, but consumption of extremely large doses can cause <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions.</b> It may take several hours before the poison takes effect, as cyanogenic glycosides must be hydrolyzed before the cyanide ion is released. The United States National Library of Medicine's Hazardous Substances Data Bank records no cases of amygdalin poisoning from consuming apple seeds.|$|E
5|$|Appropriate {{antibiotics}} {{decrease the}} average 3â€“5 day duration of symptoms by about one day, and also reduce contagiousness. They are primarily prescribed to reduce rare complications such as rheumatic fever and peritonsillar abscess. The arguments {{in favor of}} antibiotic treatment should be balanced by the consideration of possible side effects, and it is reasonable to suggest that no antimicrobial treatment be given to healthy adults who have <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> to medication or those at low risk of complications. Antibiotics are prescribed for strep throat at a higher rate than would be expected from how common it is.|$|E

5|$|In other areas, {{such as the}} Mediterranean, some {{individuals}} have <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> to apples because of their similarity to peaches. This form of apple allergy also includes OAS, but often has more severe symptoms, such as vomiting, abdominal pain and urticaria, and can be life-threatening. Individuals with this form of allergy can also develop reactions to other fruits and nuts. Cooking does not break down the protein causing this particular reaction, so affected individuals can eat neither raw nor cooked apples. Freshly harvested, over-ripe fruits tend to have {{the highest levels of}} the protein that causes this reaction.|$|E
5|$|Repetitive {{transcranial}} magnetic stimulation temporarily improves levodopa-induced dyskinesias.

There is no evidence to substantiate that acupuncture and practice of Qigong, or T'ai chi, have any effect on the course of the disease or symptoms. Fava beans and velvet beans are natural sources of levodopa and are eaten by many people with PD; their intake is not free of risks as life-threatening <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> have been described, such as the neuroleptic malignant syndrome.|$|E
5|$|The {{most potent}} {{are members of}} the genus Psilocybe, such as P.azurescens, P.semilanceata, and P.cyanescens, but {{psilocybin}} has also been isolated from about a dozen other genera. As a prodrug, psilocybin is quickly converted by the body to psilocin, which has mind-altering effects similar, in some aspects, to those of LSD, mescaline, and DMT. In general, the effects include euphoria, visual and mental hallucinations, changes in perception, a distorted sense of time, and spiritual experiences, and can include possible <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> such as nausea and panic attacks.|$|E

5|$|Short-term {{exposure}} to zirconium powder can cause irritation, but only {{contact with the}} eyes requires medical attention. Persistent {{exposure to}} zirconium tetrachloride results in increased mortality in rats and guinea pigs and a decrease of blood hemoglobin and red blood cells in dogs. However, {{in a study of}} 20 rats given a standard diet containing ~4% zirconium oxide, there were no adverse effects on growth rate, blood and urine parameters, or mortality. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for zirconium exposure is 5mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommended exposure limit (REL) is 5mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday and a short term limit of 10mg/m3. At levels of 25mg/m3, zirconium is immediately dangerous to life and health. However, zirconium is not considered an industrial health hazard. Furthermore, reports of zirconium-related <b>adverse</b> <b>reactions</b> are rare and, in general, rigorous cause-and-effect relationships have not been established. No evidence has been validated that zirconium is carcinogenic or genotoxic.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Numerous {{observational}} {{studies suggest}} that preventable <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions</b> are a significant burden in healthcare, but no meta-analysis using a standardised definition for <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions</b> exists. The aim {{of the study was}} to estimate the percentage of patients with preventable <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions</b> and the preventability of <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions</b> in adult outpatients and inpatients. METHODS: Studies were identified through searching Cochrane, CINAHL, EMBASE, IPA, Medline, PsycINFO and Web of Science in September 2010, and by hand searching the reference lists of identified papers. Original peer-reviewed research articles in English that defined <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions</b> according to WHO's or similar definition and assessed preventability were included. Disease or treatment specific studies were excluded. Meta-analysis on the percentage of patients with preventable <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions</b> and the preventability of <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions</b> was conducted. RESULTS: Data were analysed from 16 original studies on outpatients with 48797 emergency visits or hospital admissions and from 8 studies involving 24128 inpatients. No studies in primary care were identified. Among adult outpatients, 2. 0 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 2 - 3. 2 %) had preventable <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions</b> and 52 % (95 % CI: 42 - 62 %) of <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions</b> were preventable. Among inpatients, 1. 6 % (95 % CI: 0. 1 - 51 %) had preventable <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions</b> and 45 % (95 % CI: 33 - 58 %) of <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions</b> were preventable. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis corroborates that preventable <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions</b> are a significant burden to healthcare among adult outpatients. Among both outpatients and inpatients, approximately half of <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions</b> are preventable, demonstrating that further evidence on prevention strategies is required. The percentage of patients with preventable <b>adverse</b> drug <b>reactions</b> among inpatients and in primary care is largely unknown and should be investigated in future research...|$|R
