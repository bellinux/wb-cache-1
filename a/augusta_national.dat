5|$|By tradition, {{the winner}} of the {{previous}} year's Masters Tournament puts the jacket on the current winner {{at the end of the}} tournament. In 1966, Jack Nicklaus became the first player to win in consecutive years and he donned the jacket himself. When Nick Faldo (in 1990) and Tiger Woods (in 2002) repeated as champions, the chairman of <b>Augusta</b> <b>National</b> put the jacket on them.|$|E
5|$|The Masters Tournament, {{also known}} as The Masters or The US Masters, {{is one of the}} four major championships in {{professional}} golf. Scheduled for the first full week of April, the Masters is the first major of the year, and unlike the others, it is held at the same location, <b>Augusta</b> <b>National</b> Golf Club, a private course in the southeastern United States, in city of Augusta, Georgia.|$|E
5|$|The {{club was}} {{targeted}} by Martha Burk, who organized a failed protest at the 2003 Masters {{to pressure the}} club into accepting female members. Burk planned to protest at the front gates of <b>Augusta</b> <b>National</b> during {{the third day of}} the tournament, but her application for a permit to do so was denied. A court appeal was dismissed. In 2004, Burk stated that she had no further plans to protest against the club.|$|E
50|$|Lunn {{never won}} a major, but won the par-3 contest at <b>Augusta</b> <b>National's</b> pitch & putt course {{during the week of}} the 1969 Masters. His best finish in a major was a T-3 at the 1970 U.S. Open. Lunn retired from the PGA Tour in 1980 and took club pro and {{teaching}} pro jobs at three clubs in northern California. Currently he holds the position of Senior PGA Tour Professional at Woodbridge Golf and Country Club in Woodbridge, California.|$|R

50|$|Golf Course. The 18 hole, par 72 {{course at}} the Oak Island Golf Club (OIGC) {{is open to the}} public as are its bar and {{restaurant}} (Duffer's Pub and Grill). The 6,720 yard course layout has 37 bunkers and water in play on nine different holes along with five sets of tees (back tees are course rated at 73.3 with a slope of 133). Designed by George Cobb, famous as the co-designer of <b>Augusta</b> <b>National's</b> par 3 course, it features ultradwarf TifEagle greens and Bermuda tees/fairways/rough. Live Oaks and Yaupon Holly trees border most every fairway, and with its well placed bunkers, water hazards and the wind, it provides an enjoyable and challenging golfing experience. A full practice facility is available to the public which includes a putting green, sand traps and a driving range.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to a cash prize, {{the winner of the}} tournament is presented with a distinctive green jacket, formally awarded since 1949, and informally acquired by the champions for many years before that. The green sport coat is the official attire worn by members of <b>Augusta</b> <b>National</b> while on the club grounds; each Masters winner becomes an honorary member of the club. The recipient of the green jacket has it presented to him inside the Butler Cabin soon {{after the end of the}} tournament, and the presentation is then repeated outside near the 18th green in front of the spectators. Winners keep their jacket for the first year after their first victory, then return it to the club to wear whenever they visit. The tradition began in 1949, when Sam Snead won his first of three Masters titles.|$|E
5|$|The green {{jacket is}} only {{allowed to be}} removed from <b>Augusta</b> <b>National</b> by the reigning champion, after which it must remain at the club. Exceptions to this rule include Gary Player, who in his joy of winning mistakenly took his jacket home to South Africa after his 1961 victory (although he has always {{followed}} the spirit of the rule and has never worn the jacket); Seve Ballesteros who, in an interview with Peter Alliss from his home in Pedreña, showed one of his two green jackets in his trophy room; and Henry Picard, whose jacket was removed from the club before the tradition was well established, remained in his closet for a number of years, and is now on display at Canterbury Golf Club in Beachwood, Ohio, where he was the club professional for many years.|$|E
5|$|The tournament has {{a number}} of traditions. Since 1949, a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, {{although}} it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless he needs to be re-fitted with a new jacket). The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by Ben Hogan in 1952, is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the <b>Augusta</b> <b>National</b> Golf Club. Beginning in 1963, legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot {{on the morning of the}} first round to commence play. These have included Fred McLeod, Jock Hutchinson, Gene Sarazen, Sam Snead, Byron Nelson, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, and Gary Player. Since 1960, a semi-social contest at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.|$|E

25|$|Jones co-designed the <b>Augusta</b> <b>National</b> {{course with}} Alister MacKenzie; the new club opened in early 1933.

Jones came out of retirement to play, essentially on an exhibition basis, and his presence guaranteed enormous media attention, boosting the new tournament's fame.|$|E
50|$|At the 1987 Masters, Mize {{was tied}} with Seve Ballesteros and Greg Norman after four rounds. Ballesteros was {{eliminated}} in the first hole of the playoff. On the second playoff hole, which was Augusta's eleventh, a par four, Mize's second shot landed well off the putting green. It appeared that a birdie would be impossible, and that even making par might be difficult. Meanwhile, Norman's second shot landed {{on the edge of}} the green, giving him a potentially makeable birdie putt. On his third shot, Mize hit an incredible, memorable chip shot with a sand wedge from around 140 feet, giving him the birdie. Norman now had an opportunity to tie, but he failed to sink the putt. Mize's win was especially appreciated because he is an Augusta native and had worked on the scoreboard at <b>Augusta</b> <b>National's</b> third hole as a teenager. His Masters win and a tie for fourth at the U.S. Open in June briefly put him in the top-10 of the Official World Golf Ranking.|$|R
