5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>project</b> is Baku–Tbilisi–Kars railway project, {{which will}} be able to shorten the route via the Caspian Sea by {{bypassing}} Iran. The new railway lines constructed in Kazakhstan will make it shorter. The new route, in this case, will be China–Kazakhstan–Azerbaijan–Georgia–Turkey.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>project,</b> {{which aims}} to {{overhaul}} the game and improve upon the gameplay and graphics to better resemble the original PlayStation version, was released in 2013 {{by members of the}} Romhacking.net community. The patch, which took four years to develop, first started off as a graphics hack, but has since evolved into an extensive revamp.|$|E
5|$|On 26 July 2005, five UN member countries, Italy, Argentina, Canada, Colombia and Pakistan, {{representing}} {{a larger group}} of countries called Uniting for Consensus lead by Italy, proposed to the General Assembly <b>another</b> <b>project</b> that maintains five permanent members and raises the number of non-permanent members to 20.|$|E

50|$|The Métro {{system has}} <b>another</b> <b>projected</b> subway line, Line 6, whose number was {{reserved}} for a surface line proposed by the Ministère des Transports du Québec (MTQ) along the northern shore of the island, {{but it was never}} shown on a system map.|$|R
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>project</b> {{combining}} the T-34 tank chassis with the D-15 gun was also considered. Designated SU-D15, the medium assault gun {{was intended as}} a replacement for the SU-122. Although the project received a lot of support from the authorities it never entered production, both because of its shortcomings (the heavy gun put too much strain on the suspension and ammunition stowage was too limited) and because it was made redundant by the ISU-152. However lessons learned mounting a powerful gun in the T-34 allowed for rapid development of the SU-100 tank destroyer.|$|E
5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>project</b> was a {{documentary}} on the life and music of Ravi Shankar, Howard Worth's Raga (1971), for which Harrison had stepped in {{at the last minute}} to provide funding and distribution through Apple Films. With Harrison also serving as record producer for the accompanying soundtrack album, work began with Shankar in Los Angeles during April 1971 and resumed in late June, following Harrison-produced sessions in London for the band Badfinger.|$|E
5|$|As of 2008, Russia had an {{agreement}} pending with India worth US$2billion for the lease of Nerpa and <b>another</b> <b>Project</b> 971 Shchuka-B-class submarine. Of this, K-152 Nerpa will be leased for 10 years to India {{at an estimated}} cost of US$670 million. The submarine was handed over to India on 30 December 2011. After being {{handed over to the}} Indian Navy, it was commissioned as INS Chakra. Nerpa is the Russian word for the Baikal seal, and Chakra is the mythical weapon of the Indian god Vishnu.|$|E

5|$|Sales fell to {{just under}} 14,000 by issue 12, and {{continued}} to fall during the series' second year until the 24th issue sold just over 9,000 copies. In December 2015, the 35th issue sold an estimated 6,500 copies. According to Dave Carter, a writer for Comics Beat, this is a typical sales pattern for a modern comic. The series concluded with issue 47 in February 2017, which had estimated sales of about 6,300. Because {{of the decline in}} Revivals sales, Seeley expressed skepticism about doing <b>another</b> <b>project</b> of similar length in the future.|$|E
5|$|Saria {{conceived}} Loev script {{while he}} was working on <b>another</b> <b>project,</b> and drew heavily from his personal experiences. It was eventually picked up for production despite Saria's own doubts on its viability. Principal photography took place at Mahabaleshwar, the UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Western Ghats in peninsular India, and Mumbai, in the summer of 2014. The film was shot within sixteen days by the cinematographer Sherri Kauk in 2K resolution. Made on a shoestring budget, the film relied on crowdfunding and costcutting measures to meet its production costs.|$|E
5|$|Several archaeological {{investigations}} into the tower were {{carried out in the}} post war period. Investigations were carried out during the renovations throughout 1948 to 1956. Further work followed to the east of the tower between 1962 and 1964, uncovering the landing dock. <b>Another</b> <b>project</b> was carried out in 1994 and 1995, uncovering part of the original garden of the tower and the 16th century adjoining timber house, and an architectural survey between 2009 and 2011 determined that one of the wooden doors on the second floor was probably an original feature from 1365.|$|E

5|$|The DDL project's {{problems}} harmed the Australian shipbuilding industry. The {{cancellation of}} both the DDLs and <b>another</b> <b>project</b> to develop an Australian fast combat support ship design led to a perception that technical risks needed to be minimised when selecting new warships, and it was preferable to rely on proven foreign designs. Australian industry was also left with a bad impression as companies {{involved in the project}} had devoted considerable resources to preparing tenders for the DDL.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} {{originally intended}} to have Diamonds Are Forever re-create commercially successful aspects of Goldfinger, including hiring its director, Guy Hamilton. Peter R. Hunt, who had directed On Her Majesty's Secret Service and worked in all previous Bond films as editor, was invited before Hamilton, but due to involvement with <b>another</b> <b>project</b> could only work on the film if the production date was postponed, which the producers declined to do.|$|E
5|$|After {{a meeting}} between Scott and Zaillian on <b>another</b> <b>project,</b> Zaillian brought the project up again with Scott, who decided {{he was ready to}} do it. Producer Brian Grazer and Imagine {{executive}} Jim Whitaker decided against pursuing George's attempt and to return to Zaillian's vision. In February 2006, Ridley Scott entered talks with the studio to take over American Gangster from George, returning to Zaillian's draft as the film's basis. Washington returned to his role as Lucas, and Russell Crowe was attached to star as Roberts. Crowe was drawn to the project based on his previous work with the director on Gladiator and A Good Year, while Washington wanted to work with Crowe again, after 1995's Virtuosity. Production was slated in summer 2006.|$|E

5|$|<b>Another</b> <b>project</b> of the Laboratory for Nuclear Science was a {{synchrotron}} particle accelerator, {{which was}} designed to accelerate electrons to an energy of 350MeV. The accelerator was funded by the Office of Naval Research and built under the supervision of Ivan A. Getting, who was a professor of electrical engineering and had worked at the Radiation Laboratory on the extremely successful SCR‑584 radar. Although its construction began in 1946, the accelerator had not begun to work by 1949. In response, Zacharias asked Sands to assist. This was Sands's introduction to accelerator physics, and with his help the machine became operational early in 1950.|$|E
5|$|Crimewave is a 1986 American comedy film {{directed}} by Sam Raimi, written {{by him and}} the Coen brothers, and starring Louise Lasser, Paul L. Smith, Brion James, Sheree J. Wilson, Edward R. Pressman, Bruce Campbell, and Reed Birney, with Campbell also serving as a producer. Following the commercial success of The Evil Dead (1981), Raimi and Campbell decided to collaborate on <b>another</b> <b>project.</b> Joel Coen of the Coen brothers served {{as one of the}} editors on The Evil Dead, and worked with Raimi on the screenplay. Production was difficult for several members of the crew, and the production studio, Embassy Pictures, refused to allow Raimi to edit the film. Several arguments broke out during the shoot for the film, because of continued interference by the studio.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Christopher McQuarrie visited Berlin while researching <b>another</b> <b>project</b> {{and visited}} the {{memorial}} to von Stauffenberg at the Bendlerblock. Researching the 20 July plot, {{he was moved}} and fascinated {{by the fact that}} the conspirators were fully aware of what would happen if they failed their assassination attempt, and he wanted to make their story more well-known. He approached Nathan Alexander to co-write the film, and Alexander began researching the project. McQuarrie sought to model the story after the 2001 TV film Conspiracy, which depicted the Wannsee Conference at which the Nazis planned the Final Solution. He also sought to direct the film, until he realized that adequate financing would only be secured with Bryan Singer directing.|$|E
50|$|Due {{to their}} nature, however, fan discs rarely receive fan-translations, {{even among those}} based on {{critically}} acclaimed titles: Since their contents {{are not required to}} the enjoyment of the original piece, most active translation groups prefer to move on to <b>another</b> <b>projects</b> involving full length games, especially if proper sequels have been released.|$|R
50|$|A {{design study}} for a {{turbofan}} {{version of the}} RB162 was designated RB175. <b>Another</b> <b>projected</b> derivative, the RB181 {{was to be a}} scaled-down version of the RB162 producing approximately 2,000 lbs of thrust. Seven of these lift engines were to power the unbuilt Lockheed/Short Brothers CL-704 VTOL variant of the F-104 Starfighter.|$|R

5|$|In <b>another</b> <b>project,</b> {{the village}} of La Vang in Quảng Trị Province near the border with North Vietnam, {{was the scene of}} a female {{apparition}} in the late 19th century. Buddhists claimed that the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara (also known as Kuanyin; Vietnamese: Quan Âm) performed the miracle. Diệm's brother, Ngô Đình Thục, was the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Huế and the foremost religious figure in South Vietnam's nepotistic regime. Thục declared that the apparition was the Virgin Mary, and ordered that a cathedral be built in place of the makeshift Buddhist pagoda that occupied the site. Thơ made notable financial donations to the project for political reasons.|$|E
5|$|Individual {{nations are}} {{beginning}} to note the effect of fishing on seamounts, and the European Commission has agreed to fund the OASIS project, a detailed study {{of the effects of}} fishing on seamount communities in the North Atlantic. <b>Another</b> <b>project</b> working towards conservation is CenSeam, a Census of Marine Life project formed in 2005. CenSeam is intended to provide the framework needed to prioritise, integrate, expand and facilitate seamount research efforts in order to significantly reduce the unknown and build towards a global understanding of seamount ecosystems, and the roles they have in the biogeography, biodiversity, productivity and evolution of marine organisms.|$|E
5|$|The MSHD had {{proposed}} that the section of US131 south of Kalamazoo be built as an electronic highway under a bid through General Motors the same year; the testing for such a roadway was ultimately done at Ohio State University instead. <b>Another</b> <b>project,</b> {{through the end of}} 1961, extended the freeway south to Plainwell and north into downtown Grand Rapids. This extension was designated as part of Bus. US131 and opened in December 1961. The opening ceremony for the bridge across the Grand River included the state highway commission and the then-Miss Michigan, pulled by a team of sled dogs, to lead the first traffic over the river.|$|E
