40|$|International audienceThe {{physical}} adsorption of PEO(n) -b-PLL(m) copolymers onto silica nanoparticles {{and the related}} properties of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) -coated particles were studied {{as a function of}} the block copolymer composition. Copolymers adopt an <b>anchor</b> <b>buoy</b> conformation at the particle surface owing to a preferential affinity of poly(L-lysine) (PLL) blocks with the silica surface over PEO blocks when a large excess of copolymer is used. The interdistance between PEO chains at particle surface is highly dependent on the size of PLL segments; a dense brush of PEO is obtained for short PLL blocks (DP = 10), whereas PEO chains adopt a so-called interacting "mushroom" conformation for large PLL blocks (DP = 270). The size of the PEO blocks does not really influence the copolymer surface density, but it has a strong effect on the PEO layer thickness as expected. Salt and protein stability studies led to similar conclusions about the effectiveness of a PEO layer with a dense brush conformation to prevent colloidal aggregation and protein adsorption. Besides, a minimal PEO length is required to get full stabilization properties; as a matter of fact, both PEO(45) -b-PLL(10) and PEO(113) -b-PLL(10) give rise to a PEO brus...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} novel method to {{determine}} the time of occurrence of tidal slack with a GPS receiver mounted on an <b>anchored</b> <b>buoy</b> commonly used to delineate shipping lanes in estuaries and tidal channels.

The determination of {{this point in time}} is not only useful for shipping and salvaging, it is also important information for calibrating tidal models, for determining the maximum salt intrusion and for the further refinement of the theory on tidal propagation. The accuracy of the timing is well within 10 min and the method – able to operate in real time – is relatively cheap and easy to implement on a permanent basis or in short field campaigns.

40|$|A dye-buoy {{remote sensing}} {{technique}} {{has been applied to}} estuarine siting problems that involve fine-scale circulation. Small hard cakes of sodium fluorescein and polyvinyl alcohol, in <b>anchored</b> <b>buoys</b> and low-windage current followers, dissolve to produce dye marks resolvable in 1 : 60, 000 scale color and color infrared imagery. Lagrangian current vectors are determined from sequential photo coverage. Careful buoy placement reveals surface currents and submergence near fronts and convergence zones. The technique has been used in siting two sewage outfalls in Hampton Roads, Virginia: In case one, the outfall region during flood tide gathered floating materials in a convergence zone, which then acted as a secondary source during ebb; for better dispersion during ebb, the proposed outfall site was moved further offshore. In case two, flow during late flood was found to divide, with one half passing over shellfish beds; the proposed outfall site was consequently moved to keep effluent in the other half...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} in situ {{measurements}} of source level radiated from various dredging ships {{were carried out}} with hydrophones attached to <b>anchored</b> <b>buoys</b> and suspended from a survey vessel to determine the noise level {{for each of these}} ships in UK coastal waters. In order to determine the distribution of the noise sources from the ships, a 7 -element hydrophone vertical line array was deployed from the survey vessel to measure the radiated noise. A digital compass was attached to the array to determine the orientation of the array to aid the beam forming. The noise from various operational modes, such as dredging in opposite directions, pump off and transit was recorded and processed to demonstrate the differences in noise levels and positions of the sources in the water column. The results of beam forming on the noise are presented and it is shown that full dredging does generate a very wide spectrum of noise and the most likely source is from the inline pump...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the course}} of the last decade, the cost of marine robotic {{platforms}} has significantly decreased. In part this has lowered the barriers to entry of exploring and monitoring larger areas of the earth's oceans. However, these advances have been mostly focused on autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) or shallow water autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). One of the main drivers for high cost in the deep water domain is the challenge of localizing such vehicles using acoustics. A low cost one-way travel time underwater ranging system is proposed to assist in localizing deep water submersibles. The system consists of location aware <b>anchor</b> <b>buoys</b> at the surface and underwater nodes. This paper presents a comparison of methods together with details on the physical implementation to allow its integration into a deep sea micro AUV currently in development.

40|$|In {{the world}} of {{autonomous}} underwater vehicles (AUV) the prominent form of sensing has been sonar due to cloudy water conditions and dispersion of light. Although underwater conditions are highly suitable for sonar, {{this does not mean}} that vision techniques should be completely ignored. There are situations where visibility is high, such is in calm waters, and where light dispersion is not an issue, such as shallow water or near the surface. In addition, even when visibility is low, once a certain proximity to an object exists, visibility can increase. The focus of this project is this gap in capability for AUVs, with an emphasis on computer-aided detection through machine learning and computer vision techniques. All experimentation utilizes the Stingray AUV, a small and unique vehicle designed by San Diego iBotics. The first experiment is detection of an <b>anchored</b> <b>buoy,</b> which mimics the real world application of mine detection for the Navy.
