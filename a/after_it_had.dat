5|$|A {{commission}} {{appointed by}} King Edward I in 1278 {{reported that there}} were at that time 94 privately owned gibbets and gallows in use in Yorkshire, including one owned by the Archbishop of York. What was unusual about Halifax was that the custom lingered on there for so long <b>after</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been abandoned elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|A garden {{commemorating the}} Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II was opened in September 2012 in Swakeleys Park. The garden, {{featuring}} a landscaped area and benches around a stone obelisk, {{was designed by}} the local council's Green Spaces Team. The opening had been scheduled for 26 May 2012, although this was postponed after vandals destroyed the stone obelisk overnight shortly <b>after</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been installed.|$|E

5|$|A {{significant}} clue to {{its nature}} {{is provided by}} {{an account of the}} Stone's recovery in 951 AD <b>after</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been stolen 21 years earlier; according to a chronicler, the Stone was identified by its ability to float in water. If this account is accurate, it would rule out the Black Stone being an agate, a basalt lava or a stony meteorite, though it would be compatible with it being glass or pumice.|$|E
5|$|A test {{session was}} held on May 17 and 18 at the Paul Ricard circuit in France, with the track {{configured}} to replicate {{the characteristics of the}} Circuit Gilles Villeneuve for the final two days <b>after</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been {{in the style of the}} Monaco for the first two. Despite the fact that the McLaren team had dominated on the Monaco set up of the circuit, Ferrari were better on the Canadian set up.|$|E
5|$|According to Suetonius, Domitian wholly feigned his {{interest}} in arts and literature, and never bothered to acquaint himself with classic authors. Other passages, alluding to Domitian's love of epigrammatic expression, suggest {{that he was in}} fact familiar with classic writers, while he also patronized poets and architects, founded artistic Olympics, and personally restored the library of Rome at great expense <b>after</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> burned down.|$|E

5|$|Color schemes {{included}} light gray, haze gray, ocean gray, and black. Haze gray {{was found}} to provide reasonable protection in the widest range of conditions, and became a standard US Navy paint scheme after World War II. Ocean gray also became a standard paint scheme after the war. Although black is still used for submarines, it was discontinued on destroyers <b>after</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been determined that black ships remained more noticeable than gray ships on even the darkest nights.|$|E
5|$|Ice had to {{be stored}} at {{multiple}} points between harvesting and its final use by a customer. One method for doing this was the construction of ice houses to hold the product, typically either shortly after the ice was first harvested or at regional depots <b>after</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been shipped out. Early ice houses were relatively small, but later storage facilities were the size of large warehouses and contained much larger quantities of ice.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, no. 1976 was retired <b>after</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> lost {{braking power}} and crashed. After this, only {{selected}} trams were given overhauls, the last being no. 170 in 1980. Following {{the delivery of}} the articulated SL79, the Class B and E were gradually retired, with the last tram running into 1985. Oslo Tramway Museum has kept six trams, while Oslo Sporveier kept two, converted them to maintenance vehicles and painted them yellow with zebra stripes.|$|E

In December 1983, John Smith's Cask (3.8% ABV) was re-introduced, {{seven years}} <b>after</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been phased out. By June 1985, John Smith's produced 1.7 million hectolitres of beer annually. In November that year, a new brewhouse was opened, {{at the cost}} of £5 million. Production of Foster's lager began in 1987.|$|E
5|$|In February 2001, Clear Channel Communications {{subsidiary}} Citicasters {{was fined}} $25,000 {{for its use}} of time brokerage agreements and litigation for unlawfully controlling Youngstown, Ohio area radio station WBTJ (101.9 FM, now WYLR); the company had also {{been the target of}} complaints for using KFJO (FM) to rebroadcast KSJO <b>after</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> nominally sold KFJO to minority-owned interests.|$|E
5|$|On 31 July 2008, it was {{announced}} The Tales of Beedle the Bard would also be made available for the public, in both standard and collector's editions. The book was published by Children's High Level Group and printed and distributed by Bloomsbury, Scholastic, and Amazon.com. The decision was taken due to disappointment among Harry Potter fans <b>after</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> initially been announced a wide public release was not intended.|$|E

5|$|Scotland Yard {{released}} the e-fits in 2013 for a BBC Crimewatch reconstruction. <b>After</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> aired, The Sunday Times published that the McCanns {{had had the}} e-fits since 2008.

The newspaper apologized and paid £55,000 in damages.|$|E
5|$|The DVD boxset for season five was {{released}} by 20th Century Fox in the United States and Canada on December 21, 2004, ten years <b>after</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> completed broadcast on television.
