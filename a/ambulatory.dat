5|$|It is {{possible}} for a patient with a chest tube to be managed in an <b>ambulatory</b> care setting by using a Heimlich valve, although research to demonstrate the equivalence to hospitalization has been of limited quality.|$|E
5|$|With Sen. Ron Tupa, Kefalas was {{the house}} sponsor of {{legislation}} {{designed to reduce}} the cost of college textbooks by requiring textbook publishers to disclose costs and offer textbooks unbundled from additional materials, and he sponsored legislation to allow outpatient surgery centers to establish peer review committees; both bills were signed into law by Gov. Ritter. For his support of <b>ambulatory</b> surgical centers, Kefalas was awarded the Legislator of the Year Award by the Colorado <b>Ambulatory</b> Surgery Center Association later that year.|$|E
5|$|A cardiac cath lab {{is being}} studied for the {{hospital}} and a new PET/CT scanner has been installed. A future $75 million expansion for <b>ambulatory</b> care, expanded surgery suites, and medical training is also planned. The hospital is also {{the location of the}} Atlantic Cancer Research Institute. This hospital is managed by Vitalité Health Network.|$|E
5|$|The Graduate School of Public Health {{was first}} offered to {{students}} in 1981, {{and was one of}} only 24 accredited schools of public health in the nation and {{the only one in the}} CSU system in 1995. President Day considered it the major achievement of his administration, and it provided training in hospitals, public health agencies, health maintenance organizations, <b>ambulatory</b> care, and mental health facilities.|$|E
5|$|The Sanctuary is {{surrounded}} by an <b>ambulatory,</b> or passage, along which are forty-two bronze caskets containing hand-written, illuminated Books of Remembrance {{with the names of}} every Victorian who enlisted for active service with the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) or Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force in World War I or died in camp prior to embarkation.|$|E
5|$|The {{focus of}} a temple is the centre or sanctum sanctorum (garbhagriha) where {{the image of the}} deity resides, so temple {{architecture}} is designed to move the devotee from outside to the garbhagriha through <b>ambulatory</b> passageways for circumambulation and halls or chambers (mantapas) that become increasingly sacred as the deity is approached.|$|E
5|$|Built between 1117 and 1508, Peterborough Cathedral is {{remarkable}} as the least altered of the Norman cathedrals with only its famous Early English west front, with its later porch and the Perpendicular rebuilding {{of the eastern}} <b>ambulatory</b> by John Wastell being in different styles. J.L. Cartwright wrote of the west front that it is “as magnificent an entrance to a sacred building as could well be imagined.” The long wooden roof of the nave is original and has retained its painting from 1220.|$|E
5|$|Coquitlam {{is served}} by Fraser Health, which {{operates}} the 106-bed Eagle Ridge Hospital on the Port Moody/Coquitlam city boundary. ERH opened its doors in 1984 and operates a 24-hour emergency department, <b>ambulatory,</b> long-term care and acute care programs. It is a Centre of Excellence for elective surgery for urology, gynaecology, plastics and orthopedics. The hospital also offers public education clinics for asthma, diabetes, rehabilitation services and programs for cardiology, children's grief recovery, youth crisis response and early psychosis prevention.|$|E
5|$|In the Despotate of Epirus, the Church of the Parigoritissa (1282–9) is {{the most}} complex example, with a domed octagon core and domed <b>ambulatory.</b> Built {{in the capital of}} Arta, its {{external}} appearance resembles a cubic palace. The upper level narthex and galleries have five domes, with the middle dome of the narthex an open lantern. This Greek-cross octagon design, similar to the earlier example at Daphni, is one of several among the various Byzantine principalities. Another is found in the Hagia Theodoroi at Mistra (1290–6).|$|E
5|$|The eastern ends of English cathedrals show {{a greater}} {{diversity}} {{than those of}} any other country. Those built in the Norman era had high apsidal ends surrounded by a lower <b>ambulatory,</b> as is typical of Northern France. This arrangement still exists at Norwich and in part at Peterborough and also, with variation, in the Early English Gothic east end at Canterbury, but in every other case has been modified.|$|E
5|$|Private Ambulance Service – Normal {{commercial}} {{companies with}} paid employees, but often on contract {{to the local}} or national government. Private companies may provide only the patient transport elements of ambulance care (i.e. nonurgent or <b>ambulatory</b> transport), but in some places, they are contracted to provide emergency care, or to form a 'second tier' response. In many areas private services cover all emergency transport functions and government agencies do not provide this service. Companies such as Falck, Acadian Ambulance, and American Medical Response {{are some of the}} larger companies that provide such services. These organisations may also provide services known as 'Stand-by' cover at industrial sites or at special events. From April 2011 all private ambulance services in the UK must be Care Quality Commission (CQC) registered. Private services in Canada operate non-emergency patient transfers or for private functions only.|$|E
5|$|Since Madagascar gained {{independence}} from French colonial rule in 1960, Malagasy cuisine has reflected the island's diverse cultures and historic influences. Throughout the country, rice {{is considered the}} preeminent food and constitutes the main staple of the diet {{in all but the}} most arid regions of the south and west. Accompanying dishes served with rice vary regionally according to availability of ingredients and local cultural norms. Outside the home, Malagasy cuisine is served at simple roadside stalls (gargottes) or sit-down eateries (hotely). Snacks and rice-based meals may also be purchased from <b>ambulatory</b> street vendors. Upscale restaurants offer a wider variety of foreign cuisine and Malagasy dishes bearing French and other outside influences in preparation technique, ingredients and presentation alike.|$|E
5|$|When {{this was}} {{effected}} in 1090, John {{became the first}} Bishop of Bath, and St Peter's was raised to cathedral status. As the roles of bishop and abbot had been combined, the monastery became a priory, run by its prior. With the elevation of the abbey to cathedral status, {{it was felt that}} a larger, more up-to-date building was required. John of Tours planned a new cathedral on a grand scale, dedicated to Saint Peter and Saint Paul, but only the <b>ambulatory</b> was complete when he died in December 1122. He was buried in the cathedral. The most renowned scholar monk based in the abbey was Adelard of Bath; after his various travels he was back in the monastery by 1106.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by show runner and {{executive}} producer Shonda Rhimes, while filmmaker Daniel Minahan directed it. Sara Ramirez began receiving star billing in the season premiere, after numerous appearances during the last episodes of the second season. Although the episode was fictionally set in Seattle, Washington, it was filmed in Los Angeles, California. Fisher Plaza, which is the headquarters building for Fisher Communications and Fisher's ABC affiliated Komo radio and television stations for Seattle, is used for some exterior shots of Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital, such as air ambulances landing on the Komo Television newscopter's helipad. This puts Seattle Grace conveniently close to the Space Needle, which is {{directly across the street}} from Fisher Plaza, the Seattle Monorail, and other local landmarks. However, the hospital used for most other exterior and many interior shots is not in Seattle, are shot at the VA Sepulveda <b>Ambulatory</b> Care Center in North Hills, California. Most scenes are primarily filmed in Los Feliz, Los Angeles, at the Prospect Studios, and the set occupies two stages, including the hospital pieces, but some outside scenes are shot at the Warren G. Magnuson Park in Seattle.|$|E
25|$|Each chapel is round, with {{independent}} dome-like vaulting and {{is lower than}} the <b>ambulatory,</b> so a clerestory above the chapels can illuminate the <b>ambulatory.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the U.S. {{federal health}} care system (including the VA, the Indian Health Service, and NIH) <b>ambulatory</b> care pharmacists are given full {{independent}} prescribing authority. In some states such North Carolina and New Mexico these pharmacist clinicians are given collaborative prescriptive and diagnostic authority. In 2011 the board of Pharmaceutical Specialties approved <b>ambulatory</b> care pharmacy practice as a separate board certification. The official designation for pharmacists who pass the <b>ambulatory</b> care pharmacy specialty certification exam will be Board Certified <b>Ambulatory</b> Care Pharmacist and these pharmacists will carry the initials BCACP.|$|E
25|$|Cardiovascular {{procedures}} {{are more likely}} to be performed in an inpatient setting than in an <b>ambulatory</b> care setting; in the United States, only 28% of cardiovascular surgeries were performed in the <b>ambulatory</b> care setting.|$|E

25|$|On {{the temple}} terrace, a 60-metre-wide, 43-metre-deep and 5-metre-high podium {{supports}} the upper hall surrounding an <b>ambulatory</b> and the core building. The <b>ambulatory,</b> {{separated from the}} upper hall by a 5-cubit-thick wall, comprised a total of 140 octagonal columns disposed in three rows. For most of these columns, only the base is still visible today.|$|E
25|$|They each open {{onto the}} <b>ambulatory</b> through three arches divided by two columns.|$|E
25|$|Greek Chapel of the Derision – {{the southernmost}} chapel in the <b>ambulatory.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since the {{emergence}} of modern clinical pharmacy, <b>ambulatory</b> care pharmacy practice {{has emerged as a}} unique pharmacy practice setting. <b>Ambulatory</b> care pharmacy is based primarily on pharmacotherapy services that a pharmacist provides in a clinic. Pharmacists in this setting often do not dispense drugs, but rather see patients in office visits to manage chronic disease states.|$|E
25|$|In some of {{the above}} designs, {{original}} design has been transformed in rebuilding; thus in Albans, Durham, York and Exeter cathedrals, there was no <b>ambulatory</b> but three parallel apses, in some cases rectangular externally. In Southwell, Rochester and Ely, there was no processional path or <b>ambulatory</b> round the end; in Carlisle no eastern chapels; and in Oxford only one central apse.|$|E
25|$|His grandson, Nicholas T. Clerk Jr (born 1963) is a {{consultant}} obstetrician-gynaecologist, specialising in <b>ambulatory</b> gynaecology.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the unusual}} {{features}} of Chartres cathedral is {{the speed with}} which it was built – a factor which helped contribute to the consistency of its design. Even though there were innumerable changes to the details, the plan remains remarkably consistent. The major change occurred six years after work began when the seven deep chapels around the choir opening off a single <b>ambulatory</b> were turned into shallow recesses opening off a double-aisled <b>ambulatory.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Providence Surgical & Medical Center is an <b>ambulatory</b> {{health care}} center located in north-central Laredo and also owned by Universal Health Services.|$|E
25|$|Bus based and air {{ambulances}} are {{not based}} on these standards. Buses are mostly for <b>ambulatory</b> transfer only and offer less advance care services.|$|E
25|$|Group therapy {{can form}} part of the {{therapeutic}} milieu of a psychiatric in-patient unit or <b>ambulatory</b> psychiatric partial hospitalization (also known as day hospital treatment).|$|E
25|$|The TTC {{also runs}} Wheel-Trans, a {{paratransit}} {{service for the}} physically disabled with special low-floor buses designed to accommodate wheelchairs and to make boarding easier for <b>ambulatory</b> customers with limited mobility.|$|E
25|$|HH-60L (no {{official}} name assigned): UH-60L extensively modified with medical mission equipment. Components include an external rescue hoist, integrated patient configuration system, environmental control system, on-board oxygen system (OBOGS), and crashworthy <b>ambulatory</b> seats.|$|E
25|$|The plan is cruciform. A two bay narthex at {{the western}} end opens into a seven bay nave leading to the {{crossing}}, from which wide transepts extend three bays each to north and south. East of the crossing are four rectangular bays terminating in a semicircular apse. The nave and transepts are flanked by single aisles, broadening to a double-aisled <b>ambulatory</b> around the choir and apse. From the <b>ambulatory</b> radiate three deep semi-circular chapels (overlying the deep chapels of Fulbert's 11th-century crypt) and three much shallower ones. Of the latter, one was effectively lost in the 1320s when the Chapel of St Piat was built.|$|E
25|$|The {{municipal}} government operates public health facilities across the city's territory, with 770 {{primary health care}} units (UBS), <b>ambulatory</b> and emergency clinics and 17 hospitals. The Municipal Secretary of Health has 59,000 employees, including 8,000 physicians and 12,000 nurses.|$|E
25|$|The 42d Medical Group manages an <b>ambulatory</b> {{healthcare}} facility offering family health, pediatrics, internal medicine, physical therapy, flight medicine, chiropractic, trainee health, optometry, {{mental health}} and dental services to eligible beneficiaries. Ancillary services include pharmacy, radiology, a referral management center and a laboratory.|$|E
25|$|The Cathedral of Braga was rebuilt in the 1070s by Bishop Pedro and consecrated in 1089, {{although}} only the apse was finished at the time. He wished {{to create a}} pilgrimage church, with a three aisled nave, an <b>ambulatory</b> and a large transept.|$|E
25|$|Gothic {{architecture}} {{was brought}} to Portugal by the Cistercian Order. The first fully Gothic building in Portugal is {{the church of the}} Monastery of Alcobaça, a magnificent example of the clear and simple architectural forms favoured by the Cistercians. The church was built between 1178 and 1252 in three phases, and seems inspired by the Abbey of Clairvaux, in the Champagne. Its three aisles are very tall and slender, giving an exceptional impression of height. The whole church is covered by rib vaulting and the main chapel has an <b>ambulatory</b> and a series of radiant chapels. The vault of the <b>ambulatory</b> is externally supported by flying buttresses, typical features of Gothic architecture and a novelty at the time in Portugal.|$|E
25|$|PhilHealth and {{beneficiaries}} {{have access}} to a comprehensive package of services, including inpatient care, catastrophic coverage, <b>ambulatory</b> surgeries, deliveries, and outpatient treatment for malaria and tuberculosis. Those identified as indigent and OFW are also entitled to outpatient primary care benefits (PCB1) or TSEKAP.|$|E
