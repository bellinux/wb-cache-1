5|$|Females of P. labiata and P. schultzi try to {{kill and}} eat their mates during or after copulation, by {{twisting}} and lunging. The males wait until the females have hunched their legs, making this attack less likely. Males <b>also</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> abseil from a silk thread to approach from above, but females may manoeuvre to get the higher position. If the female moves at all, the male leaps and runs away.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} an eight-player co-operative multiplayer mode called the Chaos Squad, which tasks players {{to complete a}} series of missions, as decided by the players themselves. Players defend vats of Overcharge Delirium XT from waves of OD'd at night and stop their progression by setting up fortifications and barriers, {{in a manner similar}} to tower defense games. It is inter-connected with the single-player mode allowing players to transfer their story character, with all the weapons and gadgets they have already accumulated, to the mode. Although players work together, players <b>also</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> earn more Style points during play than their co-op partners.|$|E
5|$|Theorists <b>also</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> {{generate}} {{or modify}} models {{to take into}} account new data. In the case of an inconsistency between the data and model's results, the general tendency is to try to make minimal modifications to the model so that it produces results that fit the data. In some cases, a large amount of inconsistent data over time may lead to total abandonment of a model.|$|E

5|$|All lemurs {{experience}} some predation pressure. Common defenses against predation {{include the use}} of alarm calls and predator mobbing, mostly among diurnal lemurs. The leaping abilities of lemurs may have evolved for predator avoidance rather than for travel, according to a study in kinematics. Nocturnal lemurs are difficult to see and track at night and decrease their visibility by foraging alone. They <b>also</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> avoid predators by using concealing sleeping locations, such as nests, tree holes, or dense vegetation, Some may also avoid areas frequented by predators by detecting the smell of their feces. and alternating between multiple sleeping locations. Even torpor and hibernation states among cheirogaleids may be partly due to high levels of predation. Infants are protected while foraging by either leaving them in the nest or by stashing them in a hidden location, where the infant remains immobile {{in the absence of the}} parent.|$|E
5|$|Bramblestar's Storm, {{the seventh}} volume in the Super Edition arc, {{features}} Bramblestar, {{the leader of}} ThunderClan. The book takes place after the Clans' victory over the Dark Forest cats. This book was released on 26 August 2014. All Clans are struggling due to the lake flooding; however, ThunderClan and ShadowClan appear to be suffering most. Deaths of Clanmates leads to tension and grief between those in ThunderClan as they simultaneously <b>also</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> survive outside of their usual territory, having been displaced by the flooding. On a border patrol, Bramblestar encounters some housecats that are taken into the Clan until they can return home. Bramblestar becomes close {{to one of the}} housecats, Jessy, which upsets Bramblestar's deputy (and former mate) Squirrelflight causing many quarrels between them. Ultimately, two of the housecats, Minty and Jessy, decide to leave, leaving only Frankie (later named Stormpaw) with ThunderClan. Jessy leaves because she feels {{that it would be better}} if Bramblestar and herself do not become mates because Bramblestar’s heart belongs with Squirrelflight. In the short manga chapter included at the book's end, it is revealed that Squirrelflight is pregnant with Bramblestar's kits.|$|E
5|$|The cheetah is {{threatened}} by habitat loss through agricultural and industrial expansion; moreover, the animal apparently requires a large area to live in as indicated by its low population densities. The cheetah appears to be less capable than the leopard of coexisting with humans. As such, human interference can disturb the activities, such as hunting and feeding, of cheetah. With 76% of their range consisting of unprotected land, the cheetah are often targeted by farmers and pastoralists who attempt to protect their livestock. However, cheetahs typically do not prefer livestock for prey. Game hunters may <b>also</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> harm cheetah as these carnivores can deprive them of valuable game. Roadkill can be another threat, especially in areas where roads have been constructed near the natural habitat or protected areas. Cases of roadkill involving cheetahs have been reported from Kalmand, Tūrān, and Bafq. The threat is posed by infectious diseases is minor, given the low population densities and hence the minimal chance of infection.|$|E

25|$|Females of {{the marine}} {{intertidal}} periwinkle species (genus Littorina) have another way to avoid males. Males usually recognize female snails by cues in their mucous trails. However, females try to mask their gender by altering these cues. In damselflies, females <b>also</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> mask their gender by mimicking male colors, which make them less attractive to males.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} brave villagers {{try to kill}} the beast, but are quickly dispatched. When a chunk is cut off the worm, it simply reattaches the missing piece. Visiting knights <b>also</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> assault the beast, but none survive. When annoyed, the worm uproots trees by coiling its tail around them, then creates devastation by waving around the uprooted trees like a club.|$|E

25|$|Farmers often try {{mechanical}} {{means of}} killing locusts, such as digging trenches and burying hopper bands, {{but this is}} very labor-intensive and is difficult to undertake when large infestations are scattered over a wide area. Farmers <b>also</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> scare locust swarms away from their fields by making noise, burning tires or other methods. This tends to shift the problem to neighbouring farms, and locust swarms can easily return to reinfest previously visited fields.|$|E
25|$|As fashions {{changed over}} time, the Quaker ideal of plain dress stood out against {{contemporary}} clothing. As a result, the {{traditional forms of}} this practice were dropped by most Friends. Today, {{it is more likely}} that Friends will try to put their faith into action by dressing in a plain version of current fashions— such as avoiding clothing displaying designer labels. They may <b>also</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> buy only the clothing they need, and pay more for fairly traded clothing that has been made ethically.|$|E
25|$|Male guppies (Poecilia reticulata) {{have been}} {{observed}} to forcefully copulate with females by trying to insert their gonopodium (male sex organ) into female’s genital pores, {{whether or not they}} are accepting. Sometimes, male guppies <b>also</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> forcefully mate with Skiffia bilineata (goodeid) females, which resemble guppy females and tend to share the same habitat, even when guppy females are available. A possible explanation for this is the deeper genital cavity of S. bilineata, which stimulates the males more than when mating with guppy females.|$|E

25|$|When Courtney was {{deciding}} which men {{to put on}} his Cornell crew, he would pick men of high moral character and strong in their studies, not just for their athletic ability. He would <b>also</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> ascertain their disposition and temperament. Courtney preferred men that were methodical and systematic. It was his view that if one of the rowers was a disturbing element he would have trouble producing a fast crew. Courtney also maintained absolute control of the crew, and would remove and substitute anyone if he believed it would help the crew succeed.|$|E
25|$|A goalkeeper can <b>also</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> {{distract}} the taker {{by talking to}} them prior to the penalty being taken. Netherlands national team goalkeeper Tim Krul used this technique during the penalty shootout in the quarter-final match of the 2014 FIFA World Cup against Costa Rica. As the Costa Rican players were preparing to take the kick, Krul told them that he {{knew where they were}} going to put their penalty in order to get in their heads. This resulted in him saving two penalties and the Netherlands winning the shootout 4-3.|$|E
25|$|The {{origins of}} the Saturn V rocket begin with the US {{government}} bringing Wernher von Braun along with about seven hundred German rocket engineers and technicians to the United States in Operation Paperclip, a program authorized by President Truman in August 1946 {{with the purpose of}} harvesting Germany's rocket expertise, to give the US an edge in the Cold War through development of intermediate-range (IRBM) and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM). It was known that America's rival, the Soviet Union, would <b>also</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> secure some of the Germans.|$|E
