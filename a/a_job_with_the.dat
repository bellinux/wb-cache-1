He worked there until 1838, when he left {{at the age of}} 21 to join the family's cotton business. He became {{the driving force behind the}} business.

Consequently, he played little cricket in 1933. He planned to be unavailable for the Test matches against the West Indies, but Larwood was injured and Voce out of form, so he was persuaded {{to play in the}} first Test. He played little thereafter that season and declined an invitation to tour India with an MCC team. In three games that season, he scored 199 runs and took 13 wickets. That December, he was elected {{as a member of the}} Stock Exchange.|$|E

In March 1946, Carter writes, he failed the {{entrance}} exam for the University of London, then worked for Selfridges and the civil service, and as a storeman for Ealing Borough Council. On two occasions he had lost jobs, he said, because he had refused to be dishonest. In 1962 he held <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> post office, then worked as a self-employed gardener until 1968 when he began his anti-protein campaign. He lived with his parents until they died, his father in 1966 and his mother the following year, after which {{he was given a}} council flat in Haydock Green, Northolt, north London.|$|E
5|$|Discharged {{from the}} army, Willkie {{returned}} to Elwood. He considered {{a run for}} Congress as a Democrat, but was advised that the district was so Republican he {{would be unlikely to}} keep the seat even if he could win it, and his chances might be better in a more urban area. Herman Willkie wanted Wendell and Robert to rejoin the family law firm, but Henrietta was opposed, feeling that opportunities in Elwood were too limited for her sons. She got her way, and in May 1919 Wendell Willkie successfully applied for <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Firestone Tire and Rubber Company in Akron, Ohio as head of the legal office that advised workers on wills and other personal matters. He was soon bored there, and on the advice of his wife, left for a law firm despite an offer from Harvey Firestone to double his salary. Firestone told the departing lawyer that he would never amount to anything because he was a Democrat.|$|E
5|$|Hammond was {{involved}} with several businesses. In 1933, to ease his financial concerns, he took <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Cater Motor Company. He {{was used as a}} sales promotions manager, which mainly involved publicity and meeting customers, although he also test-drove cars. Taking a job with Marsham Tyres in 1937 enabled him to become an amateur cricketer. He joined the board of directors and was again used for publicity, but he was never a hard worker or determined salesman. Returning to Marsham's after he was discharged from the RAF in 1944, he supplemented his income by working as a journalist. He wrote for The Star during the 1948 Test series and penned three books with the assistance of a ghostwriter.|$|E

Kom and Vijender were the first boxers to get the award which carried prize money of Rs 750,000 and a citation. Both Sushil and Vijender were recommended to the Padma Shri awards committee, by the Indian Sports and Home Ministries; however, they were denied the awards after recommendations were not fruitful by the Padma Awards Committee for 2009 winners. The denial of Padma Shri for them created a furore among masses with allegations of promoting only a few sports.
