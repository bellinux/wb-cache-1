Additionally, she shows great appreciation for the movement away from feminist thought as led by bourgeois white women, and towards a multidimensional gathering of both genders to fight for the raising up of women. This shifts the original focus of feminism away from victimization, and towards harboring understanding, appreciation, and tolerance for all genders and sexes so that all <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>control</b> of their own destinies, uncontrolled by patriarchal, capitalist tyrants.|$|E
25|$|Republic. This {{regime is}} {{ruled by a}} philosopher king, and thus is {{grounded}} on wisdom and reason. The aristocratic state, and the man whose nature corresponds to it, are the objects of Plato's analyses {{throughout much of the}} Republic, as opposed to the other four types of states/men, who are discussed later in his work. In Book VIII, Plato states in order the other four imperfect societies with a description of the state's structure and individual character. In timocracy the ruling class is made up primarily of those with a warrior-like character. In his description, Plato has Sparta in mind. Oligarchy is made up of a society in which wealth is the criterion of merit and the wealthy <b>are</b> <b>in</b> <b>control.</b> In democracy, the state bears resemblance to ancient Athens with traits such as equality of political opportunity and freedom for the individual to do as he likes. Democracy then degenerates into tyranny from the conflict of rich and poor. It is characterized by an undisciplined society existing in chaos, where the tyrant rises as popular champion leading to the formation of his private army and the growth of oppression.|$|E
