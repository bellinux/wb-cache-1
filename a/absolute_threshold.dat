40|$|International audiencePure-tone {{audiometry}} (measurement of <b>absolute</b> <b>thresholds</b> using pure tones) is {{the main}} test for the diagnosis of hearing loss. It {{can be achieved by}} using either air conduction (with headphones or loudspeakers) or bone conduction (by placing a vibrator on the mastoid bone behind the ear). The HeadPhone Transfer Function (HPTF) describes both the headphone response and the coupling to a listener's ear. Recent papers indicated that modifications of headphone position can lead to changes in HPTF, and that these spectral modifications can be audible. The aim of the present study is to determine whether the headphone placement over a listener's ears has an influence on pure-tone audiometric tests. Audiograms were performed several times on normal-hearing subjects, for different headphone positions (obtained by placing/removing the headphone over the listener's ears), the <b>absolute</b> <b>thresholds</b> measurements being repeated for each headphone position. The dispersions of <b>absolute</b> <b>thresholds</b> with and without modification of the headphone position were compared in order to determine whether the headphone positioning is an issue for audiometric tests...|$|R

40|$|The neural {{mechanisms}} of pitch coding have been debated {{for more than}} a century. The two main mechanisms are coding based on the profiles of neural firing rates across auditory nerve fibers with different characteristic frequencies (place-rate coding), and coding based on the phase-locked temporal pattern of neural firing (temporal coding). Phase locking precision can be partly assessed by recording the frequency-following response (FFR), a scalp-recorded electrophysiological response that reflects synchronous activity in subcortical neurons. Although features of the FFR have been widely used as indices of pitch coding acuity, only a handful of studies have directly investigated the relation between the FFR and behavioral pitch judgments. Furthermore, the contribution of degraded neural synchrony (as indexed by the FFR) to the pitch perception impairments of older listeners and those with hearing loss is not well known. Here, the relation between the FFR and pure-tone frequency discrimination was investigated in listeners {{with a wide range of}} ages and <b>absolute</b> <b>thresholds,</b> to assess the respective contributions of subcortical neural synchrony and other age-related and hearing loss-related mechanisms to frequency discrimination performance. FFR measures of neural synchrony and <b>absolute</b> <b>thresholds</b> independently contributed to frequency discrimination performance. Age alone, i. e., once the effect of subcortical neural synchrony measures or <b>absolute</b> <b>thresholds</b> had been partialed out, did not contribute to frequency discrimination. Overall, the results suggest that frequency discrimination of pure tones may depend both on phase locking precision and on separate mechanisms affected in hearing loss...|$|R
50|$|In {{neuroscience}} and psychophysics, an <b>absolute</b> <b>threshold</b> {{was originally}} {{defined as the}} lowest level of a stimulus - light, sound, touch, etc. - that an organism could detect. Under the influence of signal detection theory, <b>absolute</b> <b>threshold</b> has been redefined as the level at which a stimulus will be detected a specified percentage (often 50%) of the time. The <b>absolute</b> <b>threshold</b> can be influenced by several different factors, such as the subject's motivations and expectations, cognitive processes, and whether the subject is adapted to the stimulus.The <b>absolute</b> <b>threshold</b> can be compared to the difference threshold, which is the measure of how different two stimuli must be for the subject to notice that they are not the same.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This {{invited paper}} reviews {{experimental}} studies of the frequency-dependence of <b>absolute</b> <b>thresholds</b> for the perception of vibration, equivalent comfort contours, temporary changes in sensation caused by vibration, and reductions in finger blood flow caused by hand-transmitted vibration. <b>Absolute</b> <b>thresholds</b> depend on the contact conditions but for a typical hand grip the thresholds show greatest sensitivity to acceleration around 125 Hz. The frequency-dependence of discomfort caused by hand-transmitted vibration depends on vibration magnitude: similar to <b>absolute</b> <b>thresholds</b> at low magnitudes, but the discomfort at higher magnitudes is similar when the vibration velocity is similar (at frequencies between about 16 and 400 Hz). Hand-transmitted vibration induces temporary elevations in vibrotactile thresholds that reflect the sensory mechanisms excited by the vibration and are therefore highly dependent on the frequency of vibration. Handtransmitted vibration reduces finger blood flow during and after exposure; when the vibration velocity is similar at all frequencies there is more vasoconstriction at frequencies greater than 63 Hz than at lower frequencies. A single frequency weighting cannot provide a good indication of how all effects of hand-transmitted vibration depend on vibration frequency. Furthermore, a single frequency weighting provides only an approximate indication of any single response, because many factors influence the frequency-dependence of responses to hand-transmitted vibration, including the magnitude of vibration, contact conditions, and individual differences. Although the frequency weighting in current standards extends from 8 to 1, 000 Hz, frequencies greater than 400 Hz rarely increase the weighted value on tools and there is currently little psychophysical or physiological evidence of their effects...|$|R

At frequencies less than 3. 15 Hz, sensitivity was greatest to fore-and-aft vibration. In all three axes, the acceleration threshold contours at frequencies greater than 80 Hz were U-shaped, suggesting the same psychophysical channel mediated high frequency thresholds for fore-and-aft, lateral and vertical vibration.

Knowledge of the frequency-dependence of discomfort caused by foot vibration, and how this varies with vibration magnitude, will assist the prediction of discomfort caused by vibration. With groups of 12 seated subjects, this experimental study determined <b>absolute</b> <b>thresholds</b> for the perception of foot vibration and quantified the discomfort caused by vibration at the foot. The study investigated {{a wide range of}} magnitudes (from the threshold of perception to levels associated with severe discomfort) over a wide range of frequencies (from 8 to 315 Hz in one-third octave steps) {{in each of the three}} orthogonal translational axes (fore-and-aft, lateral, and vertical). The effects of gender and shoes on <b>absolute</b> <b>thresholds</b> for the perception of vertical vibration at the foot were also investigated. Within each of the three axes, the vibration acceleration corresponding to the <b>absolute</b> <b>thresholds</b> for the perception of vibration, and also all contours showing conditions producing equivalent discomfort, were highly frequency-dependent at frequencies greater than about 40 Hz. The acceleration threshold contours were U-shaped at frequencies greater than 80 Hz in all three axes of excitation, suggesting the involvement of the Pacinian channel in vibration perception. At supra-threshold levels, the frequency-dependence of the equivalent comfort contours in each of the three axes was highly dependent on vibration magnitude. With increasing vibration magnitude, the conditions causing similar discomfort across the frequency range approximated towards constant velocity. Thresholds were not greatly affected by wearing shoes or subject gender. The derived frequency weightings imply that no single linear frequency weighting can provide accurate predictions of discomfort caused by a wide range of magnitudes of foot vibration. <br/...|$|R
40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the effects of}} apical hair cell destruction on the detection and discrimination of low-frequency stimuli. Monauralized chinchillas were trained using operant conditioning and positive reinforcement to respond to pure-tone stimuli in the absence {{and the presence of}} a high-pass noise masker. Following the collection of the baseline <b>absolute</b> <b>thresholds,</b> psychophysical tuning curves (PTCs) also were determined at low and high frequencies. Apical hair cells in the experimental ear of each subject then were destroyed by applying a liquid-nitrogen-cooled miniature cryoprobe to the bony wall of the cochlea. Post-cryosurgery, unmasked and masked <b>absolute</b> <b>thresholds</b> and psychophysical tuning curves were re-evaluated. Following cryosurgery, low-frequency <b>absolute</b> <b>thresholds</b> increased by 30 - 50 dB. High-pass masking data suggested that receptors that were unaffected by the masking noise were responsible for the remaining low-frequency hearing. Low-frequency tuning, monitored by assessing changes in PTCs, was significantly altered following apical receptor cell loss, with the most effective maskers located several octaves above the test tone frequency. Following these determinations, one control and two experimental subjects then participated in a third experiment assessing low-frequency discrimination acuity. Some discrimination ability was retained after the cryosurgery; however, these post-lesion difference limens increased when a high-pass noise masker was added to the test environment. At the termination of the behavioral experiment, subjects were euthanized and their cochleae dissected to correlate behavioral and histopathological data. The data suggest that receptors located in frequency regions of the cochlea normally responsive to middle and high frequencies may be responsible for detection and discrimination of low-frequency stimuli in apically damaged cochleae. These data are consistent with other reports which indicate that redundant mechanisms are available for the detection of low-frequency stimuli, and they provide new information regarding how low-frequency stimuli are discriminated throughout the cochlea...|$|R

40|$|The {{discrimination}} of interaural phase differences (IPDs) requires accurate binaural temporal {{processing and}} {{has been used as}} a measure of sensitivity to temporal envelope and temporal fine structure (TFS). Previous studies found that TFS-IPD discrimination declined with age and with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), but age and SNHL have often been confounded. The aim of this study was to determine the independent contributions of age and SNHL to TFS and envelope IPD discrimination by using a sample of adults with a wide range of ages and SNHL. A two-interval, two-alternative forced-choice procedure was used to measure IPD discrimination thresholds for 20 -Hz amplitude-modulated tones with carrier frequencies of 250 or 500 Hz when the IPD was in either the stimulus envelope or TFS. There were positive correlations between <b>absolute</b> <b>thresholds</b> and TFS-IPD thresholds, but not envelope-IPD thresholds, when age was accounted for. This supports the idea that SNHL affects TFS processing independently to age. Age was positively correlated with envelope-IPD thresholds at both carrier frequencies and TFS-IPD thresholds at 500 Hz, when <b>absolute</b> <b>thresholds</b> were accounted for.
