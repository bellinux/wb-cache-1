Brown's daughter Linda, a third grader, had to walk six blocks to her school bus stop to ride to Monroe Elementary, her segregated black school one mile (1.6km) <b>away,</b> <b>while</b> Sumner Elementary, a white school, was seven blocks from her house.|$|E
5|$|As Gert {{was several}} {{days away from}} Bermuda, the NHC advised {{residents}} there to monitor {{the progress of the}} storm, Due to uncertainties in the future forecast, as well as the size and strength of Gert, a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch was issued for the island on September19, about two days prior to its closest approach. As Gert moved closer to the island, the watch and warning were replaced by a hurricane warning on September20, which was maintained until the following day after Gert moved further away. Before Gert passed by the island, officials closed two schools and converted them to emergency shelters. Police workers advised 700families to leave their houses. Cruise lines diverted ships <b>away,</b> <b>while</b> hundreds of tourists took flights to leave the island.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales {{have two}} {{flippers}} on the front, near the head. Like all mammals, baleen whales breathe air and must surface periodically to do so. Their nostrils, or blowholes, are {{situated at the}} top of the cranium. Baleen whales have two blowholes, as opposed to toothed whales which have one. These paired blowholes are longitudinal slits that converge anteriorly and widen posteriorly, which causes a V-shaped blow. They are surrounded by a fleshy ridge that keeps water <b>away</b> <b>while</b> the whale breathes. The septum that separates the blowholes has two plugs attached to it, making the blowholes water-tight while the whale dives.|$|E

5|$|Eleven goaltenders {{have scored}} {{a total of}} {{fourteen}} goals in National Hockey League (NHL) games. A goalkeeper can score by either shooting the puck into the net, or being awarded the goal as the last player on his team to touch the puck when an opponent scored an own goal. A goal scored by shooting the puck is particularly challenging as the goaltender has to aim for a six-foot-wide net that is close to 180 feet <b>away,</b> <b>while</b> avoiding opposing defencemen; {{in the case of}} own goals, the combined circumstance of the own goal itself in addition to the goaltender being the last player to touch the puck makes it a very rare occurrence. Of the fourteen goals, seven were scored by shooting the puck and seven were the result of own goals.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} caused {{flooding in}} the state of Veracruz. Thousands of people were forced from their homes as rivers rose, including upwards of 30,000fleeing for shelter after the Tuxpan River exceeded its bank. About 8,000residents of the city of Álamo were rendered homeless. Flooding in Poza Rica forced the rescue of dozens of people from their cars and homes. Several homes in the city were swept <b>away,</b> <b>while</b> debris such as tree branches and trash blocked water runoff. Water, mudslides, and rocks blocked numerous roads in the area. In combination with Hurricane Kristy in the Pacific Ocean, approximately 50,000people were left homeless in Mexico. At least 20fatalities were attributed to Debby.|$|E

Yet another wounded Indonesian was observed to crawl <b>away</b> <b>while</b> the tenth proceeded to run off unharmed back in the direction from which the patrol had come. Within twenty minutes the contact was over and the Australians proceeded to collect the discarded Indonesian weapons and equipment, including a Browning Automatic Rifle, three MI rifles and 200 rounds of ammunition. Dressed in US steel helmets, green shirts and blue and khaki shorts, the Indonesian soldiers were subsequently identified as members of 440 Battalion.|$|E
5|$|In South Carolina, {{strong winds}} and large waves {{impacted}} the Charleston area. A number of homes were destroyed, forcing some occupants {{to ride out}} the storm completely exposed to the weather. Waves overtopped the levees, flooding army camps along the coast. On September18, two schooners were capsized in the Lower Potomac River. Crops were also destroyed in the area, while a railroad bridge was carried away. A ship was demasted off Cove Point in Chesapeake Bay on September18. Heavy rainfall in Pennsylvania resulted in flooding along the Delaware River and Lehigh Canal, especially in Easton. In Jim Thorpe, then known as Mauch Chunk, three bridges washed <b>away,</b> <b>while</b> a dam was destroyed. In New York City, gale force winds were observed at harbor.|$|E
5|$|Timberlake's party left Long Island on November 28, 1761. The Holston River's unusually {{low water}} levels almost {{immediately}} stalled the journey, {{as the party}} was forced to drag their canoe over exposed shoals and sandbars. The party ran out of provisions after several days, but McCormack managed to shoot a bear, supplying them with several days' worth of meat. Around December 7, the party explored a stalactite-filled cave situated approximately 50 feet above the river. Timberlake described an incident in which Sumter swam nearly a half-mile in the near-freezing river waters to retrieve their canoe, which had somehow drifted <b>away</b> <b>while</b> they were exploring the cave.|$|E

5|$|A {{resident}} of Malakula was struck {{and killed by}} a falling coconut while seeking shelter from the worsening conditions. Agriculture on nearby Ahamb Island, already impaired by Paula, was further compromised; all crops, both those remaining after Paula and those planted in the intervening time, were destroyed. Four classrooms on the small island were also damaged beyond use. Buildings on Aoba incurred appreciable damage, while on Efate, the storm brought down utility poles, severely damaged local schools, and left roads covered with debris and floodwaters. Flooding in the nation's capital city of Port Vila forced 50 residents {{to leave their homes}} in search of higher ground. Espiritu Santo, particularly the island's south shore around Luganville, bore the brunt of Cyclone Sose. Several types of crops (also weakened by Paula) took a heavy beating, and 60 people had to evacuate due to encroaching floods. In total, the storm demolished 59 houses on the island and in some way damaged another 101. A young child drowned after being swept <b>away</b> <b>while</b> attempting to cross a swollen waterway. Just offshore, the M/V Omale succumbed to the heavy seas; all 16 of its occupants successfully swam four hours to shore.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to rain and flooding, winds damaged more homes and businesses, and a tornado was spawned {{a few miles}} southwest of Port Arthur. More than 19,000power outages were reported in the area near where Bonnie made landfall. Texas State Highway 87 was closed in Jefferson County due to debris and electrical poles fallen on the roadway. The storm left broken windows, scattered tree limbs, and debris filled streets in Port Arthur and Beaumont. At the latter, strong winds toppled a radio tower at the Texas Department of Public Safety building, while several schools suffered damage to the roof and windows. Marinas and boats at Lake Sam Rayburn were damaged. Hank Creek Marina, located across the lake, broke free from its moorings and floated <b>away,</b> <b>while</b> portions of were submerged. Four indirect fatalities were confirmed in Texas, two from traffic accidents, one from a house fire ignited by a candle, and another from drowning. Several injuries were also reported, including four after a truck flipped over due to strong winds.|$|E
5|$|In some lowland {{areas the}} adult {{salamanders}} will remain active all winter long, excluding cold spells. However, {{during the cold}} winter months in the northern parts of its range, the long-toed salamander burrows below the frost-line in a coarse substrate to hibernate in clusters of 8–14 individuals. While hibernating, it survives on protein energy reserves that are stored in its skin and along its tail. These proteins serve a secondary function {{as part of a}} mixture or concoction of skin secretions that is used for defense. When threatened, the long-toed salamander will wave its tail and secrete an adhesive white milky substance that is noxious and likely poisonous. The color of its skin can serve as a warning to predators (aposematism) that it will taste bad. Its skin colors and patterns are diverse, ranging from a dark black to reddish brown background that is spotted or blotched by a pale-reddish-brown, pale-green, to a bright yellow stripe. An adult may also drop part of its tail and slink <b>away</b> <b>while</b> the tail bit acts as a squirmy decoy; this is called autotomy. The regeneration and regrowth of the tail is one example of the developmental physiology of amphibians that is of great interest to the medical profession.|$|E
