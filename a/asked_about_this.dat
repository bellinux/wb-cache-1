5|$|Israeli {{historian}} David Tal {{agreed with}} this view; Yoav Gelber, when <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> <b>this,</b> {{commented that the}} significance of the attack, along with two other major tactical failures—Latrun and Jenin—was {{in the fact that the}} initiative passed to the Israeli side, and the Arabs conducted only small assaults after these operations. Scholar Fawaz Gerges noted that the Egyptians originally assumed that the further their army advances, the weaker the Israeli resistance would become.|$|E

Tom's brother Kieran, however, is depicted as boorish, rude, and drunken, and is described by the Dowager Countess as a 'drunken gorilla'—a reminder to Irish audiences of the ape-like figures depicting the Irish that were commonly featured in British and American publications in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Dowager Countess character who makes these comments, however, {{was born in the}} mid 19th century, and frequently expresses Tory or pro-imperial views that were prevalent in England in the late 19th and early 20th century.|$|E

In March, the South Eastern Railway Bill had its second reading in Parliament. Sir Charles Russell, MP stated that the South Eastern Railway (SER) had done everything in its power to obstruct the English Channel Steamship Company. Lord Elcho stated that if the railway was sincere in its desire to improve communication with the continent (the stated aim of the bill), then it would run its trains to suit Castalia, rather than expecting the ship to run to suit its trains. After some discussion, the bill passed its second reading. Sir Edward Watkin was <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> state of affairs at a shareholders meeting of the SER on 3 August. He replied that the railway could not run a special and regular service of trains to meet an irregular sailing schedule such as that operated by Castalia, which did not run in the winter. The boats that connected with the SERs trains operated a regular, year-round service.|$|E

500|$|In September 2014, it was {{announced}} that a trilogy of videos entitled [...] "Bang Bang" [...] were to be released as a short film leading up to the broadcast of the tour special. The short film (in which multiple scenes are found in video interludes and backdrops throughout the tour) was directed by New York-based filmmaker and photographer Dikayl Rimmasch. Together with war photographer William Kaner, Rimmasch put together the filmmaking approach and aesthetic of the series. Inspired by French New Wave cinema, the short film was created using custom camera rigs that Rimmasch had designed, 50-year-old Russian lenses and lighting effects by Archie Ciotti and Scott Spencer and followed an incredibly fast, shoot-from-the-hip recording style. However, following the release of part one of the trilogy, the remaining two videos never came to surface on their scheduled release dates. When <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> (and the deletion of part one from its original upload source), Rimmasch simply stated [...] "no comment".

500|$|Unlike other barristers, Mansfield {{was noted}} for always keeping a cool head and being [...] "prudent {{to the point}} of timidity". He was criticised for being [...] "moderate and dispassionate", unlike more {{aggressive}} barristers such as Edward Coke; when <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> he replied that [...] "I would not have made Sir Edward Coke's speech to gain all Sir Edward Coke's estates and all his reputation". There are conflicting reports about his temperament and attitude as a judge; William Pitt described him as [...] "a very bad judge, proud, haughty to the Bar and hasty in his determinations", and Charles Yorke said he was [...] "offensive and unpopular". Both opinions are suspect, however; Pitt's because he was a constant rival to Mansfield and Yorke's because he was attempting to beat Mansfield to the position of Lord Chancellor at the time. Edward Foss said that [...] "there has never been a judge more venerated by his contemporaries, nor whose memory is regarded with greater respect and affection", and described him as [...] "the great oracle of law".|$|E

[...] He told his three main bowlers, [...] "I won't ask you not to get a man out, but as long as Mead (a notoriously slow scoring batsman) remains at the wicket we can't be beaten". [...] In the last three hours of the Test, Armstrong decided to rest his key bowlers and allowed his part-time bowlers to rotate as they pleased and fielders to configure themselves. During this time, Armstrong picked up a newspaper that had been blown across the field and began to read. [...] When <b>asked</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> later, Armstrong was said to have replied, [...] "I wanted to see who we were playing", although this is claimed to be apocryphal.
