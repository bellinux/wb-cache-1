2500|$|After {{deciding}} {{on the story}} and the main character, he would balance the characters, in terms of genders, personalities, and ages represented; when making character personalities, he used the Enneagram of Personality as reference, which classifies people into nine groups; the decision to do this came from {{the importance of the}} number [...] "9" [...] in the storyline of 999. <b>An</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> to him when making characters was to create a mystery behind them, to make players curious about who the characters are and what their pasts are like. Another important element was the use of misdirection: by deliberately making certain characters seem like bad people, he would aim to get players to focus on them more, making it more difficult for them to see who the [...] "real bad guy" [...] is. He aimed to not give the player characters strong personalities, {{in order to make it}} easier for players to empathize with them. He chose to have the games be played from a first person perspective as he felt it makes for [...] "a stronger impact" [...] and is more interesting than a third person perspective; it was also used to limit the information that is available to the player in a realistic way, as the player only knows what they experience or are told. Because the player characters in most games can die many times, Uchikoshi felt that video game characters' deaths may be taken lightly, which he saw as a weak point in games. To combat this, he focused on trying to get players to want to keep the story alive, rather than trying to keep the player character alive; as a result of wanting to keep the story going, players would also avoid the death of their character.|$|E
2500|$|Following his {{split with}} Fleetwood Mac in 1987, Buckingham {{spent much of}} the next five years in the studio, working on his third solo album, Out of the Cradle, which was {{released}} in 1992. [...] Many of the songs deal with his relationship with Nicks and his decision to leave the band. [...] "There were things lingering for years having to do with relationships and the band, hurtful things, that were impossible to deal with until I left. If you were in a relationship and split up, then had to see that person every day for the next 15 years, it might keep you from dealing with some of those things. While we made Rumours (in 1977) there were two couples breaking up in the band (Buckingham and Nicks, and John and Christine McVie), and we had to say, [...] "This is <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> we're doing, so we've got to put this set of feelings {{on this side of the}} room and get on with it.'" [...] And when you do that long enough you forget that those feelings are even there.

[...] "Wrong" [...] was a gentle rebuke of former bandmate Mick Fleetwood's tell-all biography. Out of the Cradle received some favorable reviews but did not achieve the sales levels associated with Fleetwood Mac. However, Buckingham toured throughout 1992–93 for the first time as a solo artist; his band included an army of seven other guitarists (Buckingham himself calls them [...] "the crazy band" [...] on his Soundstage DVD), each of whom he individually taught the entire two-and-a-half hours of music from the concert (Lindsey Buckingham: Behind the Music documentary for VH-1, 2001).|$|E

2500|$|However, {{the fact}} that the virgin birth is {{mentioned}} only by Matthew and Luke is considered to produce doubt as to its truth by scholars such as Jürgen Moltmann. He writes: [...] "In the New Testament, Christ's 'virgin birth' is related only by Luke and Matthew. It was unknown, or considered unimportant, in wide areas of early Christian belief (the Pauline and Johannine sectors, for example). But from the third century onwards it became a firm component of the Christian creeds and theological christologies." [...] He also writes: [...] "The virgin birth {{is not one of the}} pillars that sustains the New Testament faith in Christ. The confession of faith in Jesus, the Son of God, the Lord, is independent of the virgin birth, and is not based on it." [...] "Moreover, we find the confession of faith in Christ in Christian traditions which know nothing of the virgin birth, or do not mention it." [...] He concludes: [...] "that the virgin birth does not provide the justification for confessing Christ." [...] John L. McKenzie notes that, if these two narratives were missing from the New Testament, [...] "there would be no biblical mention of the virgin birth". He adds, [...] "the event is unusual enough for one to wonder why an author who knew of it would not mention it." [...] Bart D. Ehrman writes, [...] "The tradition that Jesus' mother was a virgin is given by both Matthew and Luke, and to that extent, it's independently attested. But it has always struck scholars as odd that the tradition—which surely would be <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> to know!—isn't attested anywhere else in our earliest sources, even among writers who would have had a real interest in publicizing {{the fact that}} God himself was actually Jesus' father." [...] The Oxford Companion to the Bible, on the fact that nowhere else in the Bible is the virgin birth attested, has: Such an argument from silence cannot be determinative, but it is an important consideration for people who see the virgin birth as a feature created within the early traditions about Jesus rather than a historical occurrence. Those who doubt the historicity of the virgin birth argue that it was created by the early church as a way of honoring the coming of Jesus as the Son of God or of explaining the idea of God becoming flesh. Miraculous human birth stories are common in biblical tradition, going back to Abraham and Sarah (Gen. 17.15—19, 18.9—15, I. 1—7), and numerous references to deities impregnating women are found within the Greco-Roman tradition. The mother Of Heracles, for instance, was said to have been impregnated by Zeus (Diodorus Siculus, 4-9, 1—10).|$|E
