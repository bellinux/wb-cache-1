These plans were canceled, however, when a U.S. Navy ship collided with a Spanish Navy vessel in the Gulf of Mexico. Consequently, Morris commanded a squadron of ships in the Gulf to ensure that American merchant commerce in the area would continue unmolested.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis analyzes {{the effectiveness of}} the U. S. Marine Corps' proficiency <b>and</b> <b>conduct</b> marks as measures of job performance for promotion decisions. The analysis uses big data techniques (factor analysis) and multivariate regressions on data of 360, 690 active duty Marines who held the paygrade of E 3 or E 4 between 2006 and 2016 to estimate the reliability, validity, accuracy, and practicality of proficiency <b>and</b> <b>conduct</b> marks. Overall, results show that proficiency <b>and</b> <b>conduct</b> marks are effective indicators of performance, with some room for improvement. Marks are statistically inconsistent between raters, <b>and</b> proficiency <b>and</b> <b>conduct</b> marks essentially measure the same type of performance. The factor analysis does show that proficiency <b>and</b> <b>conduct</b> marks together are the most important factors in the composite score for E 4 s and the second most important, behind experience, for E 3 s. Lastly, proficiency <b>and</b> <b>conduct</b> marks are the most predictive of future performance compared to all other composite score variables. The author recommends that the Marine Corps continue to use proficiency <b>and</b> <b>conduct</b> marks as a basis for promotion decisions, but that the Marine Corps should redefine the marks in order to improve interpretability and minimize redundancies.

5|$|Air pollution, lack {{of proper}} waste {{management}} infrastructure and degradation of water bodies {{are the major}} environmental issues in Coimbatore. There is a sewage treatment plant at Ukkadam with the capacity to process 70 million litres of sewage water per day. Garbage is collected by the corporation and sewage is pumped into the water tanks and the Noyyal river through streams. This along with garbage dumping and encroachments has led to degradation of the water bodies and depletion in the groundwater table. The tanks are renovated by the city's environmental groups with their own fund-raising and the corporation. The corporation is responsible and involved in clearing encroachment of the tanks. Siruthuli, an environmental organisation founded by the city's industrial houses, undertakes de-silting of tanks and cleaning of the Noyyal river.

5|$|Emphasis {{is placed}} not on actual {{arithmetic}} computation, {{but rather on}} conceptual understanding and interpretation. The course curriculum is organized around four basic themes; the first involves exploring data and covers 20–30% of the exam.

The second theme involves planning <b>and</b> <b>conducting</b> a study and covers 10–15% of the exam. Students {{must be aware of}} the various methods of data collection through sampling or experimentation and the sorts of conclusions that can be drawn from the results. The third theme involves probability and its role in anticipating patterns in distributions of data. This theme covers 20–30% of the exam. The fourth theme, which covers 30–40% of the exam, involves statistical inference using point estimation, confidence intervals, and significance tests.|$|E
