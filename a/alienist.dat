50|$|The context {{leading to}} the {{conceptualization}} of this diagnostic category was undoubtedly borne out of the frustration of <b>alienists</b> (the term is approximately equivalent to the modern day one of psychiatrist) by the definition of madness provided by John Locke in which delusional symptoms were required.

40|$|Suicidal lunatics {{were only}} one patient group among several that <b>alienists</b> and asylum attendants had to care for, but the danger and risk {{associated}} with suicide made them {{one of the more}} difficult to manage. The task of suicide prevention was a priority for asylum staff as they endeavoured to save life and avoid criticism and investigation from the asylums' regulating body. This article investigates the contribution <b>alienists</b> and attendants made to the management and prevention of suicide in English public lunatic asylums {{during the second half of}} the nineteenth century. It examines the respective contribution <b>alienists</b> and attendants made to the handling of suicidal patients, with varying levels of involvement. In doing so, it argues that the practical application of suicide prevention fell to asylum attendants, as their work determined how, and with what success, alienists' suicide policy was implemented. © The 2011 Author...|$|R

Roosevelt announces that he knows of two more murders that match the pattern. Roosevelt decides to investigate, but because Kreizler has such a dubious reputation as an <b>alienist,</b> and because the investigation will become politically difficult, he establishes a base of operations for them outside the police precinct. Politically, Roosevelt cannot afford {{to be associated with the}} investigation and is not involved with the day-to-day operations.|$|E
25|$|According to Oliver Sacks' Hallucinations, {{the first}} known medical report of musical {{hallucinations}} was published in 1846, by French <b>alienist</b> Jules Baillarger. However, the first scientific description of the disorder {{was reported in the}} early 1900s. In the last two decades, Berrios has reported case studies in 1990 and 1991 along with Keshavan et al. in 1992. Berrios concluded that confirmed diagnoses of deafness, ear disease, brain disease, advanced age and drug use are all important factors in the development of musical hallucinations. After analyzing 46 cases, Berrios found a female predominance of 80% in women over the age of 60. The study concluded that musical hallucinations {{were more likely to be}} seen in elderly women affected by deafness or brain disease than in individuals with no psychiatric illness at all.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Alienist</b> {{is a crime}} {{novel by}} Caleb Carr first {{published}} in 1994 and is the first book in the Kreizler series. It takes place in New York City in 1896, and includes appearances by many famous figures of New York society in that era, including Theodore Roosevelt and J. P. Morgan. The sequel to the novel is The Angel of Darkness. The story follows Roosevelt, then New York City police commissioner, and Dr. Laszlo Kreizler, as their investigative team attempts to solve gruesome murders through new methods including fingerprinting and psychology. The first murder victim investigated is a 13-year-old immigrant who has had his eyes removed, his genitals removed and stuffed in his mouth, and other injuries. The investigators deal with various interest groups that wish {{to maintain the status}} quo regarding the poor immigrant population in New York City.|$|E

500|$|The {{history of}} {{schizophrenia}} {{is complex and}} does not lend itself easily to a linear narrative. Accounts of a schizophrenia-like syndrome {{are thought to be}} rare in historical records before the 19th century, although reports of irrational, unintelligible, or uncontrolled behavior were common. A detailed case report in 1797 concerning James Tilly Matthews, and accounts by Philippe Pinel published in 1809, are often regarded as the earliest cases of the illness in the medical and psychiatric literature. The Latinized term dementia praecox was first used by German <b>alienist</b> Heinrich Schule in 1886 and then in 1891 by Arnold Pick in a case report of a psychotic disorder (hebephrenia). In 1893 Emil Kraepelin borrowed the term from Schule and Pick and in 1899 introduced a broad new distinction in the classification of mental disorders between dementia praecox and mood disorder (termed manic depression and including both unipolar and bipolar depression). [...] Kraepelin believed that dementia praecox was probably caused by a long-term, smouldering systemic or [...] "whole body" [...] disease process that affected many organs and peripheral nerves in the body but which affected the brain after puberty in a final decisive cascade. [...] His use of the term [...] "praecox" [...] distinguished it from other forms of dementia such as Alzheimer's disease which typically occur later in life. It is sometimes argued that {{the use of the term}} démence précoce in 1852 by the French physician Bénédict Morel constitutes the medical discovery of schizophrenia. However, this account ignores the fact that there is little to connect Morel's descriptive use of the term and the independent development of the dementia praecox disease concept at the end of the nineteenth century.|$|E

50|$|Industrialization and {{population}} growth led to a massive expansion of the number and size of insane asylums in every Western country in the 19th century.

40|$|Physicians {{specializing in}} the {{diagnosis}} and treatment of insane people (<b>alienists)</b> emerged in the early 19 th century and offered their expertise for the courts to consider in judgments of mental competence. In the Oliver Smith will case (1847), the competency of an attesting witness was contested on the issue of insanity. Four well-known <b>alienists</b> testified at trial. Although the insanity of the witness could have been viewed in broader terms, the experts used a narrow definition of insanity based primarily on the presence of delusions. These opinions were only partially consistent with contemporaneous medical notions of insanity and the broad definition of criminal responsibility. We suggest three explanatory factors for the narrow definition related to available medical knowledge, courtroom restrictions including the case itself, and mid- 19 th-century relationships between mental medicine and the law...|$|R

[...] In her review for Tulsa World, Patricia Ann Jones wrote that the novel [...] "breaks new ground on several fronts. As a historical novel it paints an unrivaled picture of New York.

40|$|On March 4, 1878, at {{a meeting}} of the New York Neurological Society, Edward C. Spitzka {{delivers}} a blistering attack on psychiatry, basically dismissing all <b>alienists</b> as incompetent and indicating that 2 ̆ 2 the study of insanity should be considered a subdivision of neurology. 2 ̆ 2 This address was published in the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease in 1878 and reproduced in the current issue of the journal. Spitzka asserts that 2 ̆ 2 nothing worthy of notice has proceeded from our insane asylums 2 ̆ 2 and that asylum superintendents may be experts in many things, but they are not experts in the 2 ̆ 2 diagnosis, pathology, and treatment of insanity. 2 ̆ 2 To ascertain whether or not Spitzka 2 ̆ 7 s characterizations were correct, I examined the medical and psychiatric literature published in English only in 1878. This review indicates that Spitzka was largely wrong. Research was not what it should have been, and the <b>alienists</b> (psychiatrists of that era) knew it. American <b>alienists,</b> however, were otherwise engaged in all manner of deliberations about important issues of the day relevant to the practice of psychiatry. In fact, to an absolutely remarkable degree, the issues of 1878 are the same as those of American psychiatry in the 21 st century. That might say much more about psychiatry than Spitzka could ever have known 133 years ago...|$|R
