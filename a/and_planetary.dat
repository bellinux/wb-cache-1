5|$|In 2016, the IAU {{organized}} a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars.

5|$|Most importantly, the High Speed Photometer was {{replaced}} with the COSTAR corrective optics package, and WFPC {{was replaced}} with the Wide Field <b>and</b> <b>Planetary</b> Camera 2 (WFPC2) with an internal optical correction system. The solar arrays and their drive electronics were also replaced, as well as four gyroscopes in the telescope pointing system, two electrical control units and other electrical components, and two magnetometers. The onboard computers were upgraded with added coprocessors, and Hubble's orbit was boosted.|$|E

5|$|The {{heliosphere}} <b>and</b> <b>planetary</b> {{magnetic fields}} (for those planets that have them) partially shield the Solar System from high-energy interstellar particles called cosmic rays. The density of cosmic rays in {{the interstellar medium}} {{and the strength of}} the Sun's magnetic field change on very long timescales, so the level of cosmic-ray penetration in the Solar System varies, though by how much is unknown.|$|E
5|$|This model, {{known as}} the nebular hypothesis, was first {{developed}} in the 18th century by Emanuel Swedenborg, Immanuel Kant, and Pierre-Simon Laplace. Its subsequent development has interwoven a variety of scientific disciplines including astronomy, physics, geology, <b>and</b> <b>planetary</b> science. Since {{the dawn of the}} space age in the 1950s and the discovery of extrasolar planets in the 1990s, the model has been both challenged and refined to account for new observations.|$|E

5|$|After the spherical {{aberration}} was corrected during Space Shuttle mission STS-61 in 1993, the improved imaging {{capabilities of the}} telescope were used to study increasingly distant and faint galaxies. The Medium Deep Survey (MDS) used the Wide Field <b>and</b> <b>Planetary</b> Camera 2 (WFPC2) to take deep images of random fields while other instruments were being used for scheduled observations. At the same time, other dedicated programs focused on galaxies that were already known through ground-based observation. All of these studies revealed substantial differences between the properties of galaxies today and those that existed several billion years ago.|$|E
5|$|As Jupiter {{migrated}} inward {{following its}} formation (see Planetary migration below), resonances would have {{swept across the}} asteroid belt, dynamically exciting the region's population and increasing their velocities relative to each other. The cumulative action of the resonances and the embryos either scattered the planetesimals away from the asteroid belt or excited their orbital inclinations and eccentricities. Some of those massive embryos too were ejected by Jupiter, while others may have migrated to the inner Solar System and {{played a role in}} the final accretion of the terrestrial planets. During this primary depletion period, the effects of the giant planets <b>and</b> <b>planetary</b> embryos left the asteroid belt with a total mass equivalent to less than 1% that of the Earth, composed mainly of small planetesimals.|$|E

5|$|Ganymede orbits Jupiter at a {{distance}} of 1,070,400km, third among the Galilean satellites, and completes a revolution every seven days and three hours. Like most known moons, Ganymede is tidally locked, with one side always facing toward the planet, hence its day is seven days and three hours. Its orbit is very slightly eccentric and inclined to the Jovian equator, with the eccentricity and inclination changing quasi-periodically due to solar <b>and</b> <b>planetary</b> gravitational perturbations on a timescale of centuries. The ranges of change are 0.0009–0.0022 and 0.05–0.32°, respectively. These orbital variations cause the axial tilt (the angle between rotational and orbital axes) to vary between 0 and 0.33°.|$|E
5|$|Hindu natal astrology {{originated}} with Hellenistic astrology by the 3rd century BCE, though incorporating the Hindu lunar mansions. The {{names of the}} signs (e.g. Greek 'Krios' for Aries, Hindi 'Kriya'), the planets (e.g. Greek 'Helios' for Sun, astrological Hindi 'Heli'), and astrological terms (e.g. Greek 'apoklima' and 'sunaphe' for declination <b>and</b> <b>planetary</b> conjunction, Hindi 'apoklima' and 'sunapha' respectively) in Varaha Mihira's texts are considered conclusive evidence of a Greek origin for Hindu astrology. The Indian techniques {{may also have been}} augmented with some of the Babylonian techniques.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, a {{delegation}} from Dade County prompted the Florida State Legislature {{to support the}} development of a state Marine Laboratory in conjunction with the UM lab. It reported to the State Board of Conservation, which had no marine research facility and little budget of its own at the time. The relationship lasted for 12 years until the state of Florida built the board a lab in St. Petersburg. In 1953, the School's classrooms and laboratories were built at the current Virginia Key location. It was renamed the Institute of Marine Science in 1961, it became part of the University of Miami's School of Environmental <b>and</b> <b>Planetary</b> Sciences.|$|E
