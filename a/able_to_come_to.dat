5|$|Okba, old {{and worn}} out, comes and asks Thalaba to simply kill him and end his misery. However, Thalaba denies the request. The angel of death, Azrael, tells Thalaba that either Okba or Laila must die. Okba uses this {{chance to try}} and stab Thalaba, but Laila steps in between them and is killed. Okba curses God for his fate but Thalaba can only feel pity over the scene. After leaving, he is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Simorg's valley. Simorg directs Thalaba to take a sled to {{continue}} on his way while the spirit of Laila asks Thalaba to end Okba's misery. However, Thalaba refuses to commit vengeance and he travels onwards until he arrives at a small boat waiting for him. He is taken down a river to the sea where Thalaba tosses away his magic ring. He is then taken to a cave that would lead him to {{the domain of the}} sorcerers.|$|E

Bobbie and Laura are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> an uneasy truce, since they both love Luke. However, Mikkos' widow Helena Cassadine (then portrayed by Academy Award winning actress Elizabeth Taylor) arrives. She secretly places a curse on the couple during their reception, as she blames the duo for her husband's death. Later, Scott arrives. After catching Laura's bouquet, he declares he is contesting his divorce. As had occurred at Luke's aborted wedding to Jennifer, the men begin to fight. This time, Luke is the victor.|$|E
25|$|Each parish {{also had}} an assembly, where every parishioner was present and {{decisions}} were only taken unanimously. If they were not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> a mutual understanding the matter had to rest and be resumed later until everybody agreed. In the community houses the village's prominent people, so called byalag, gathered to decide on mutual concerns such as split-rail fences, ditch construction and agricultural related stuff. The central figure in each district was the priest. He dealt with most matters since he was in contact with every parishioner. He meddled in conflicts and gave advice and comfort in various situations. Besides preaching and informing the priest was also a farmer himself, often a forerunner in the field. The priest did not always go the authority's errand, sometimes he tried to help his fellow parishioners fend off extra taxes and military services.|$|E
25|$|In 1864, Prince Cuza, {{owing to}} {{difficulties}} between his {{government and the}} general assembly, dissolved the latter and decided to submit a draft of a constitution granting universal suffrage. He proposed creating two chambers (of senators and deputies respectively), to extend the franchise to all citizens, and to emancipate the peasants from forced labor (expecting to nullify the remaining influence of the landowners - no longer boyars after the land reform). In the process, Cuza also expected financial support from both the Jews and the Armenians - it appears that he kept the latter demand reduced, asking for only 40,000 Austrian guilder (the standard gold coins; about US$ 90,000 at the exchange rate of the time) from the two groups. The Armenians discussed the matter with the Jews, {{but they were not}} <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> a satisfactory agreement in the matter.|$|E

When the Later Tang forces, after a short rest, was getting ready to march on Daliang, Wang still tried to prevent its advance by falsely stating to the Later Tang emperor that Duan's army (which in reality was trapped north of the Yellow River and would not be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Daliang's aid) was on its way, the Later Tang emperor executed him. Shortly after, the Later Tang forces captured Daliang; Zhu Zhen committed suicide, and Later Liang was at its end.|$|E
25|$|In early 2011, Christy Clark, former Deputy Premier, {{would become}} {{leader of the}} Liberal Party. Though {{she was not a}} sitting MLA, she would go on to win the seat left vacant by Campbell and form a government. For the next two years she would attempt to {{distance}} herself from the unpopularity of Campbell and forge an image for the upcoming election. Among her early accomplishments she raised the minimum wage, created the new holiday of Family Day and pushed the development of BC's liquified natural gas. In the 2013 election, the Liberals lagged behind the NDP with a double-digit gap in the polls, but were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> a surprise victory on election night with a majority, making Clark the first elected female premier in BC history. While Clark lost her seat to NDP candidate David Eby, she later won a by-election in the riding of Westside-Kelowna. Her government would go on to balance the budget, implement changes to liquor laws and continue with the question of the proposed Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipelines.|$|E
25|$|Drifting {{competitions}} {{are judged}} based on line, angle, speed, style and show factor. Line involves taking the correct line, {{which is usually}} announced beforehand by judges. The show factor is based on many things, such {{as the amount of}} smoke, how close the car is to the wall or designated clipping point, and the crowd's reaction. Angle is the angle of a car and more importantly the turned wheels in a drift, speed is the speed entering a turn, the speed through a turn, and the speed exiting the turn; faster is better. Style is scored on a combination of a rate-to-angle during the initiation, how fluid the car looks through the course, and how committed the driver is through the course. The rate-to-angle is how quickly during initiation or Furidashi (振り出し:starting point) and transitions or Furikaeshi (振替し:transfer) a car gets to its sliding angle. Fluidity is how smoothly a driver maneuvers their car around the course, taking into account the amount of correction that a driver applies through the turn(s), and the smoothness with which the car transitions from one corner to the next. Commitment is about how much throttle the driver applies, and the confidence and dedication the driver shows when approaching track edges and barriers. That is the quicker the driver is <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> angle, the more speed and angle they can carry through the course, the fewer corrections they apply through the course and the closer they drive to the track edges or barriers, the higher the style score.|$|E

500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{following}} {{the end of}} the series.

He said that the introduction of the Borg was [...] "phenomenal", and gave the episode a score of ten out of ten. Zack Handlen, writing for The A.V. Club said that the plot was [...] "brilliant" [...] because Q was proved right. He thought that had the crew been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> some sort of solution then {{it would have been a}} [...] "strong" [...] episode, but because Picard is forced to plead with Q, it made it the first [...] "great episode" [...] of the series because [...] "it admits that these humans... can be arrogant, and weak, and that they can be bested".

Although there were forces in the military opposed to the government, many of the coup leaders of the 1960s had largely left the country or withdrawn from politics. The relationship between the three leaders remained tense, but a Maga-Ahomadégbé alliance against Apithy {{on a number of issues}} kept the triumvirate functioning during Maga's tenure.
