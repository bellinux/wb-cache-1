5|$|As {{the storm}} system moved eastward toward the Ohio, Mississippi <b>and</b> <b>Tennessee</b> Valleys on April 27, a very {{powerful}} 80–100 knot mid-level jet stream moved into the Ohio <b>and</b> <b>Tennessee</b> Valleys, behind the trough, creating strong wind shear, with a low pressure center moving quickly northeastward across those areas on the 27th.

5000|$|The East <b>Tennessee</b> <b>and</b> Georgia (ET&G) <b>and</b> East <b>Tennessee</b> <b>and</b> Virginia (ET&V) railroads were {{vital to}} the Confederacy, since they {{provided}} a connection between Virginia and the Deep South that did not require going around {{the bulk of the}} Southern Appalachian Mountains. [...] Both Union and Confederate leaders realized the railroads' importance. In July 1861, Confederate politician <b>and</b> East <b>Tennessee</b> native Landon Carter Haynes warned of the railroads' vulnerability, stating that at any moment he was [...] "looking to hear that the bridges have been burned <b>and</b> the East <b>Tennessee</b> <b>and</b> Virginia Railroad torn up." ...|$|R
