When Randy Marsh learns that South Park's KFC outlet is now a medical marijuana dispensary, he attempts to give himself cancer so he can get a doctor's referral for marijuana after first gaining {{a clean bill of health}} from his doctor since he had assumed permits are given to the healthy. By irradiating his groin with a microwave oven, Randy successfully gives himself testicular cancer, making his testicles so large that he has to use a wheelbarrow to carry them. Randy obtains his medical referral and starts smoking marijuana regularly. Meanwhile, his testicles continue to grow to the point that he uses them as a space hopper for movement.

25|$|The attempt {{has been}} made to explain the Biblical Nazarites as {{forerunners}} of monastic orders <b>addicted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> practice of ascetic discipline. Pentateuchal legislation concerning them shows them to have been merely tolerated. Modern criticism explains their peculiarities as arising from motives other than those that determine the conduct of ascetics. The Biblical Nazirs, forerunners of the Nebi'im (Prophets), were Protestants against the adoption of the customs and the religious rites of the Canaanites. In their dress and mode of life they emphasized their loyalty to YHVH, enthroned on the desert mountain. Wine and the crown of hair were sacred to the gods of the land. Their very appearance emphasized their rejection of the new deities. And in later days the number of those that took the Nazarite vow was exceedingly small. One is inclined to the opinion that no case occurred in which the Pentateuchal provisions became effective.|$|E

40|$|The study {{aimed at}} {{determining}} {{the extent of}} relapse of addiction among <b>addicts</b> self-introduced <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Center for Prevention of Addiction and delineating the social, familial and personality factors associated with the relapse. Out of <b>the</b> 3000 <b>addicts</b> referring <b>to</b> <b>the</b> center from 1997 - 2002, a sample of 200 subjects was randomly selected for study.

Factors contributing to this relapse include familial factors like conflicts with family members and neighbors, inadequate support from family and society and yielding to temptation when access to addictive substances is available. Furthermore, addiction relapse among addicts volunteering for help is associated with personality factors such as higher levels of anxiety and depression, self-control, lowered self-esteem and learned helplessness.
