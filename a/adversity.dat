40|$|Background Although {{significant}} {{associations of}} childhood <b>adversities</b> with adult mental disorders are widely documented, most studies focus on single childhood <b>adversities</b> predicting single disorders. Aims To examine joint associations of 12 childhood <b>adversities</b> with first onset of 20 DSM-IV disorders in World Mental Health (WMH) Surveys in 21 countries. Method Nationally or regionally representative surveys of 51 945 adults assessed childhood <b>adversities</b> and lifetime DSM-IV disorders with the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). Results Childhood <b>adversities</b> were highly prevalent and interrelated. Childhood <b>adversities</b> associated with maladaptive family functioning (e. g. parental mental illness, child abuse, neglect) were the strongest predictors of disorders. Co-occurring childhood <b>adversities</b> associated with maladaptive family functioning had significant subadditive predictive associations and little specificity across disorders. Childhood <b>adversities</b> account for 29. 8 % of all disorders across countries. Conclusions Childhood <b>adversities</b> have strong associations with all classes of disorders at all life-course stages in all groups of WMH countries. Long-term associations imply {{the existence of}} as-yet undetermined mediators...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} how <b>adversities</b> related to {{past and present}} morbidity, and genotype. Forty-two, suicide attempters and 22 matched control patients were followed-up after 13 years. Life-time <b>adversities</b> were explored in an interview, and the patients were reassessed psychiatrically. The serotonin-transporter-linked promotor region (5 -HTTLPR) was typed. More <b>adversities</b> were reported by suicide attempters than controls, and by still-ill than recovered suicide attempters. <b>Adversities</b> reported at follow-up were related to psychiatric morbidity at follow-up, but not to morbidity 13 years earlier. The 5 -HTTLPR, genotype was associated with reported <b>adversities,</b> but not chances of recovery. <b>Adversities</b> potentially affected chronic morbidity. 5 -HTTLPR genotype did not affect long-term recovery...|$|R
40|$|Background Suicide is {{a leading}} cause of death worldwide, but the precise effect of {{childhood}} <b>adversities</b> as risk factors for the onset and persistence of suicidal behaviour (suicide ideation, plans and attempts) are not well understood. Aims To examine the associations between childhood <b>adversities</b> as risk factors for the onset and persistence of suicidal behaviour across 21 countries worldwide. Method Respondents from nationally representative samples (n = 55 299) were interviewed regarding childhood <b>adversities</b> that occurred before the age of 18 years and lifetime suicidal behaviour. Results Childhood <b>adversities</b> were associated with an increased risk of suicide attempt and ideation in both bivariate and multivariate models (odds ratio range 1. 2 - 5. 7). The risk increased with the number of <b>adversities</b> experienced, but at a decreasing rate. Sexual and physical abuse were consistently the strongest risk factors for both the onset and persistence of suicidal behaviour, especially during adolescence. Associations remained similar after additional adjustment for respondents` lifetime mental disorder status. Conclusions Childhood <b>adversities</b> (especially intrusive or aggressive <b>adversities)</b> are powerful predictors of the onset and persistence of suicidal behaviours...|$|R

40|$|Aims: Studies of {{the effects}} of {{childhood}} <b>adversities</b> often use psychiatric diagnoses and focus on physical or sexual abuse. This study explored relationships between a broader range of <b>adversities</b> and both diagnoses and specific symptoms. Methods: The files of 217 child and adolescent mental health service users were audited. Information regarding 14 adverse childhood experiences, 20 diagnoses and 38 symptoms was analysed. Results: Only two diagnoses (Psychosis and Oppositional Defiant Disorder) were predicted by mean number of <b>adversities.</b> However, the symptom clusters indicative of six diagnoses were related to one or more childhood <b>adversities.</b> Strong specific relationships were found between sexual abuse and hyperarousal, parental substance abuse and rule violation, and loss and avoidance/numbing. Mean number of <b>adversities</b> predicted six specific symptoms as well as global functioning, risk to self, and risk to others. Parental mental health, a proxy for genetic influence, was unrelated to all diagnoses, all symptom clusters and {{all but one of the}} 38 symptoms. Conclusions: Understanding the complex nature {{of the effects}} of childhood <b>adversities</b> are constrained by focusing on diagnoses and a restricted range of <b>adversities.</b> The need to take a full psychosocial history in child and adolescent mental health services, and the implications for primary prevention, are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The aims of {{this study}} were to examine whether the {{association}} between childhood <b>adversities</b> and educational attainment in young adulthood can be explained by mental health problems in adolescence and whether associations and pathways differ for boys and girls. Methods: Data were used of 2, 230 participants from the Tracking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey, a Dutch prospective cohort study with a 9 -year follow-up. Childhood <b>adversities</b> were measured at age 11 years, mental health problems (i. e., externalizing, internalizing and attention problems with Youth Self-Report) at age 16 years, and educational attainment at age 19 years. Structural equation modeling was performed to analyze the data, overall and stratified by gender. Results: Only among boys, childhood <b>adversities</b> were associated with low educational attainment in young adulthood. Externalizing problems in adolescence explained 5 % of the association between childhood <b>adversities</b> and educational attainment. Furthermore, for both boys and girls, externalizing problems in adolescence had a direct effect on educational attainment in young adulthood. Conclusions: Among boys, childhood <b>adversities</b> are associated with poorer educational outcomes of young adults. A part of this association runs via adolescent externalizing problems. The results suggest that boys, compared with girls, are less capable to cope with childhood <b>adversities.</b> Monitoring of exposed boys to childhood <b>adversities</b> is of utmost importance.

5|$|Industrial {{development}} {{and the rise of}} manufacturing caused the population to shift gradually from rural areas to cities during the early 20th century. Nevertheless, farming remained prevalent. Minnesota's economy was hard-hit by the Great Depression, resulting in lower prices for farmers, layoffs among iron miners, and labor unrest. Compounding the <b>adversity,</b> western Minnesota and the Dakotas were hit by drought from 1931 to 1935. New Deal programs provided some economic turnaround. The Civilian Conservation Corps and other programs around the state established some jobs for Indians on their reservations, and the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 provided the tribes with a mechanism of self-government. This provided natives a greater voice within the state, and promoted more respect for tribal customs because religious ceremonies and native languages were no longer suppressed.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well-known}} that childhood <b>adversities</b> can have long-term effects on mental health, {{but a lot}} remains to be learned about the risk they bring about for a first onset of various psychiatric disorders, and how this risk develops over time. In the present study, {{which was based on}} a Dutch longitudinal population survey of adolescents TRAILS (N = 1, 584), we investigated whether and how childhood <b>adversities,</b> as assessed with three different measures, affected the risk of developing an incident depressive, anxiety, or disruptive behavior in childhood and adolescence. In addition, we tested gender differences in any of the effects under study. The results indicated that depressive, anxiety and disruptive behavior disorders each had their own, characteristic, pattern of associations with childhood <b>adversities</b> across childhood and adolescence, which was maintained after adjustment for comorbid disorders. For depressive disorders, the overall pattern suggested a high excess risk of incidence during childhood, which decreased during adolescence. Anxiety disorders were characterized by a moderately increased incident risk during childhood, which remained approximately stable over time. Disruptive behavior disorders took an intermediate position. Of the three childhood <b>adversities</b> tested, an overall rating of the stressfulness of the childhood appeared to predict onset of psychiatric disorders best. To conclude, the risk of developing a psychiatric disorder after exposure to <b>adversities</b> early in life depends {{on the nature of the}} <b>adversities,</b> the nature of the outcome, and the time that has passed since the <b>adversities</b> without disorder onset...|$|R
40|$|Childhood <b>adversities</b> {{have been}} {{proposed}} to modify later stress sensitivity and risk of depressive disorder in several ways: by stress sensitization, stress amplification, and stress inoculation. Combining these models, we hypothesized that childhood <b>adversities</b> would increase risk of early, but not later, onsets of depression (Hypothesis 1). In those without an early onset, childhood <b>adversities</b> were hypothesized to predict a relatively low risk of depression in high-stress conditions (Hypothesis 2 a) and a relatively high risk of depression in low-stress conditions (Hypothesis 2 b), compared to no childhood <b>adversities.</b> These hypotheses were tested in 1, 584 participants of the Tracking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey, a prospective cohort study of adolescents. Childhood <b>adversities</b> were assessed retrospectively at ages 11 and 13. 5, using self-reports and parent reports. Lifetime DSM-IV major depressive episodes were assessed at age 19, {{by means of the}} Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Stressful life events during adolescence were established using interview-based contextual ratings of personal and network events. The results provided support for all hypotheses, regardless of the informant and timeframe used to assess childhood <b>adversities</b> and regardless of the nature (personal vs. network, dependent vs. independent) of recent stressful events. These findings suggest that age at first onset of depression may be an effective marker to distinguish between various types of reaction patterns...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} perinatal <b>adversities</b> with regard to tic severity and comorbid attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms in children with a tic disorder. Methods: In 75 children and adolescents with a tic disorder, we retrospectively assessed presence of pregnancy, delivery, and postnatal complications and of prenatal exposure to smoking and alcohol. Children with and without these perinatal <b>adversities</b> were compared regarding tic and ADHD symptom severity. Furthermore, through linear regressions, we investigated whether perinatal <b>adversities</b> would interact with presence in first-degree relatives of tic or any mental disorders with the tic or ADHD measure as outcome. Results: Presence of delivery complications was related to tic severity and prenatal smoking exposure to severity of comorbid ADHD symptoms. The relationship between smoking exposure in utero and ADHD symptom severity appeared to be more pronounced in children with a positive family history of mental disorders. Conclusion: This study provides evidence of a role for perinatal <b>adversities</b> in the etiology of tic disorders. Children with perinatal <b>adversities</b> may be vulnerable to develop more severe tics or comorbid ADHD symptoms {{in the presence of}} a positive family history of mental disorders, suggesting a role for gene-environment interactions...|$|R

40|$|Background: There is {{increasing}} interest in elucidating {{the association of}} different childhood <b>adversities</b> with psychosis-spectrum symptoms {{as well as the}} mechanistic processes involved. This study used experience sampling methodology to examine (i) associations of a range of childhood <b>adversities</b> with psychosis symptom domains in daily life; (ii) whether associations of abuse and neglect with symptoms are consistent across self-report and interview methods of trauma assessment; and (iii) the role of different <b>adversities</b> in moderating affective, psychotic-like, and paranoid reactivity to situational and social stressors. Method: A total of 206 nonclinical young adults were administered self-report and interview measures to assess childhood abuse, neglect, bullying, losses, and general traumatic events. Participants received personal digital assistants that signaled them randomly eight times daily for one week to complete questionnaires about current experiences, including symptoms, affect, and stress. Results: Self-reported and interview-based abuse and neglect were associated with psychotic-like and paranoid symptoms, whereas only self-reported neglect was associated with negative-like symptoms. Bullying was associated with psychotic-like symptoms. Losses and general traumatic events were not directly associated with any of the symptom domains. All the childhood <b>adversities</b> were associated with stress reactivity in daily life. Interpersonal <b>adversities</b> (abuse, neglect, bullying, and losses) moderated psychotic-like and/or paranoid reactivity to situational and social stressors, whereas general traumatic events moderated psychotic-like reactivity to situational stress. Also, different interpersonal <b>adversities</b> exacerbated psychotic-like and/or paranoid symptoms in response to distinct social stressors. Discussion: The present study provides a unique examination of how childhood <b>adversities</b> impact the expression of spectrum symptoms in the real world and lends support to the notion that stress reactivity is a mechanism implicated in the experience of reality distortion in individuals exposed to childhood trauma. Investigating the interplay between childhood experience and current context is relevant for uncovering potential pathways to the extended psychosis phenotype...|$|R
40|$|Context: The {{physical}} health consequences of childhood psychosocial <b>adversities</b> {{may be as}} substantial as the mental health consequences, but whether {{this is the case}} remains unclear because much prior research has involved unrepresentative samples and a selective focus on particular <b>adversities</b> or physical outcomes. The association between early-onset mental disorders and subsequent poor {{physical health}} in adulthood has not been investigated. Objective: To investigate whether childhood <b>adversities</b> and early-onset mental disorders are independently associated with increased risk of a range of adult-onset chronic physical conditions in culturally diverse samples spanning the full adult age range. Design: Cross-sectional community surveys of adults in 10 countries. Setting: General population. Participants: Adults (ie, aged >= 18 years; N= 18 303), with diagnostic assessment and determination of age at onset of DSM-IV mental disorders, assessment of childhood familial <b>adversities,</b> and age of diagnosis or onset of chronic physical conditions. Main Outcome Measures: Risk (ie, hazard ratios) of adult-onset (ie, at age > 20 years) heart disease, asthma, diabetes mellitus, arthritis, chronic spinal pain, and chronic headache as a function of specific childhood <b>adversities</b> and early-onset (ie, at age < 21 years) DSM-IV depressive and anxiety disorders, with mutual adjustment. Results: A history of 3 or more childhood <b>adversities</b> was independently associated with onset of all 6 physical conditions (hazard ratios, 1. 44 to 2. 19). Controlling for current mental disorder made little difference to these associations. Early-onset mental disorders were independently associated with onset of 5 physical conditions (hazard ratios, 1. 43 to 1. 66). Conclusions: These results are consistent with the hypothesis that childhood <b>adversities</b> and early-onset mental disorders have independent, broad-spectrum effects that increase the risk of diverse chronic physical conditions in later life. They require confirmation in a prospectively designed study. The long course of these associations has theoretical and research implications...|$|R
