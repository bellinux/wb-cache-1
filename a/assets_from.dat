5|$|Adoption of Snapdragon {{contributed to}} Qualcomm's {{transition}} from a wireless modem company to one that also produces {{a wider range of}} hardware and software for mobile devices. In July 2011 Qualcomm acquired certain <b>assets</b> <b>from</b> GestureTek in order to incorporate its gesture recognition intellectual property into Snapdragon SoCs. In mid-2012 Qualcomm announced the Snapdragon software development kit (SDK) for Android devices at the Uplinq developer conference. The SDK includes tools for facial recognition, gesture recognition, noise cancellation and audio recording. That November Qualcomm acquired some <b>assets</b> <b>from</b> EPOS Development in order to integrate its stylus and gesture recognition technology into Snapdragon products. It also collaborated with Microsoft to optimize Windows Phone 8 for Snapdragon semiconductors.|$|E

The 29th Infantry Division was retained, however 2nd Brigade was inactivated in favor of <b>assets</b> <b>from</b> the inactivating 26th Infantry Division, which was redesignated the 26th Brigade, 29th Infantry Division.|$|E
5|$|After Smith's death, Emma Smith {{quickly became}} alienated from Brigham Young {{and the church}} leadership. Young, whom Emma feared and despised, was {{suspicious}} of her desire to preserve the family's <b>assets</b> <b>from</b> inclusion {{with those of the}} church, and thought she would be even more troublesome because she openly opposed plural marriage. When most Latter Day Saints moved west, she stayed in Nauvoo, married a non-Mormon, Major Lewis C. Bidamon, and withdrew from religion until 1860, when she affiliated with the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, first headed by her son, Joseph Smith III. Emma never denied Smith's prophetic gift or repudiated her belief in the authenticity of the Book of Mormon.|$|E

5|$|Banjo-Tooie was {{developed}} by Rare and designed by Gregg Mayles, who previously worked on Banjo-Kazooie. Development of the game started in June 1998. Some features that were originally cut during the development of Banjo-Kazooie, such as some of its worlds and a multiplayer game mode, were instead integrated into Banjo-Tooie. An additional world set in a castle was planned, but due to time constraints, it was scrapped during development and <b>assets</b> <b>from</b> it were used in constructing Cauldron Keep. The game features roughly 150 total characters, including enemies and non-playable characters.|$|E
5|$|Heated debate arose among Westmoreland, Commandant of the Marine Corps Leonard F. Chapman, Jr. and Army Chief of Staff Harold K. Johnson. Johnson {{backed the}} Marine {{position}} {{due to his}} concern over protecting the Army's air <b>assets</b> <b>from</b> Air Force co-option. Westmoreland was so obsessed with the tactical situation that he threatened to resign if his wishes were not obeyed. As a result, on 7 March, {{for the first time}} during the Vietnam War, air operations were placed under the control of a single manager. Westmoreland insisted for several months that the entire Tet Offensive was a diversion including, famously, attacks on downtown Saigon and obsessively affirming that the true objective of the North Vietnamese was Khe Sanh.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, SBC {{acquired}} the Basler Handelsbank (Commercial Bank of Basel), {{which was one}} of the largest banks in Switzerland, but became insolvent by the end of the war. SBC remained among the Swiss government's leading underwriters of debt in the post-war years. SBC, which had entered the 1950s with 31 branch offices in Switzerland and three abroad, more than doubled its <b>assets</b> <b>from</b> the end of the war to CHF 4billion by the end of the 1950s and doubled assets again in the mid-1960s, exceeding CHF 10billion by 1965.|$|E

5|$|Initially, the Court of Chancery {{would not}} {{entertain}} {{a request to}} administer an estate {{as soon as a}} flaw in the will was discovered, rather leaving it to the ecclesiastical courts, but from 1588 onwards the Court did deal with such requests, in four situations: where it was alleged that there were insufficient assets; where it was appropriate to force a legatee to give a bond to creditors (which could not be done in the ecclesiastical courts); to secure femme covert <b>assets</b> <b>from</b> a husband; and where the deceased's debts had to be paid before the legacies were valid.|$|E
5|$|On 30 January 2008, Ao {{was found}} guilty on 40 counts of bribe-taking, 13 counts of money laundering, two counts of abuse of power, one count of {{incorrect}} declaration of assets and one count of holding <b>assets</b> <b>from</b> unknown sources; Ao was sentenced to 27 years in prison. About MOP 252 million of his assets in Macau were seized. Ao decided not to appeal. There were concerns voiced in the Macau media that Ao was the fall-guy, as most Macanese were sceptical that corruption on such a scale could take place without anyone else knowing or being involved. During his trial, Ao hinted that contacts valued at in excess of 6 million Patacas required the approval of his superior in government, Edmond Ho.|$|E
5|$|Ryan {{supports}} {{eliminating the}} capital gains tax, the corporate income tax, the estate tax, and the Alternative Minimum Tax. In 1999, Ryan supported the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act, which repealed some financial regulation of banks from the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933. During the economic recovery from the Great Recession of the late 2000s, Ryan supported the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), which authorized the Treasury to purchase toxic <b>assets</b> <b>from</b> banks and other financial institutions, and the auto industry bailout; Ryan opposed the Credit CARD Act of 2009, which expanded consumer protections regarding credit card plans, and the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which strengthened financial regulation.|$|E

5|$|The 104th Infantry Division {{was first}} {{constituted}} on 24 June 1921 as the 104th Division, before being organized and activated in October {{of that year}} in Salt Lake City, Utah. Assigned to the division were the 207th and 208th Infantry Brigades, containing the 413th, 414th, 415th, and 416th Infantry Regiments. As {{a unit of the}} Organized Reserves, the division represented <b>assets</b> <b>from</b> the states of Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, and Nevada. In 1924 it received its shoulder sleeve insignia. The division would not see significant duty until World War II.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} saw great {{changes in}} preparation for mobilization to fight during World War II. On 13 February 1942 the brigade structure was downsized greatly and converted into a reconnaissance element. It was combined with <b>assets</b> <b>from</b> the 190th Infantry Brigade to form the 95th Reconnaissance Troop which was subsequently assigned to the 95th Division once again. The troop was ordered into active military service on 15 July 1942 and reorganized at Camp Swift, Texas, as the 95th Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop, {{an element of the}} 95th Division. The division itself was also {{in the process of being}} reorganized into the 95th Infantry Division.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is similar}} to its {{predecessor}} in basic gameplay, but differs by adding multiple storylines, more playable characters and increased interaction with environments. A two-player co-op mode is also available for some missions. As with The Two Towers, The Return of the King was developed in close collaboration with the filmmakers, using many of the actual reference photos, drawings, models, props and other <b>assets</b> <b>from</b> the film. The game was met with positive critical reception for its graphics, audio, and gameplay, although its camera positioning and short length were criticized.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} case was between plaintiff Brian Dowling and defendants Chicago Options Associates and Michael E. Davis, in which Dowling won a judgement of $817,830.45 from the defendants. After the court entered its judgement against him, Davis {{then tried to}} shield his <b>assets</b> <b>from</b> the plaintiff using his attorney-client relationship with {{the law firm of}} DLA Piper to assist him in buying a home in Florida. As part of this arrangement, Davis transferred funds into a trust account controlled by DLA Piper. At that time, as stated in the contract between DLA Piper and Davis, the law firm was allocated $100,000 of those funds as its retainer; the funds were used to pay day-to-day company expenses.|$|E
5|$|Whitewing was {{the name}} of a special purpose entity used as a {{financing}} method by Enron. In December 1997, with funding of $579 million provided by Enron and $500 million by an outside investor, Whitewing Associates L.P. was formed. Two years later, the entity's arrangement was changed so that it would no longer be consolidated with Enron and be counted on the company's balance sheet. Whitewing was used to purchase Enron assets, including stakes in power plants, pipelines, stocks, and other investments. Between 1999 and 2001, Whitewing bought <b>assets</b> <b>from</b> Enron worth $2 billion, using Enron stock as collateral. Although the transactions were approved by the Enron board, the asset transfers were not true sales and should have been treated instead as loans.|$|E
5|$|Day of the Tentacle Remastered {{retains its}} {{two-dimensional}} cartoon-style art, redrawn at higher resolution for modern computers. The high resolution character art was updated {{by a team}} led by Yujin Keim with consultation of Ahern and Chan. Keim's team used many of the original sketches of characters and <b>assets</b> <b>from</b> the two and emulated their style with improvements for modern graphics systems. Matt Hanson worked on recreating the background assets in high resolution. As with the Grim Fandango remaster, the player can switch {{back and forth between the}} original graphics and the high-resolution version. The game includes a more streamlined interaction menu, a command wheel akin to the approach used in Broken Age, but the player can opt to switch back to the original interface. The game's soundtrack has been redone within MIDI adapted to work with the iMUSE system. There is an option to listen to commentary from the original creators, including Schafer, Grossman, Chan, McConnell, Ahern, and Bajakian. The remaster contains the fully playable version of the original Maniac Mansion, though no enhancements have been made to that game-within-a-game.|$|E

5|$|During {{the course}} of the First World War, Rhodesia's white {{population}} was split between the Unionists, for amalgamation into the Union of South Africa, and the Responsible Government Association, for independence. While the RGA was led by Coghlan, the Union Party's leader was Herbert Longden, another lawyer from Bulawayo. Longden, like the British Government, believed Rhodesia lacked the population and resources for an independent state. For Britain, union with South Africa would mean avoiding having to buy out the BSAC, leaving the burden on South Africa instead. After the war, Coghlan noted that the new Secretary of State, Winston Churchill, was determined to achieve the amalgamation of Southern Rhodesia with South Africa. For its part, the BSAC encouraged the Unionists, expecting that it would get a better price for its <b>assets</b> <b>from</b> South Africa than from Southern Rhodesia. Other major corporations were also pro union, since South Africa would be able to provide cheap labour from the south. These interests controlled the local press and were thus highly influential in the debate. With General Smuts, a skillful statesman, also {{on the side of the}} Unionists, it seemed unlikely that Coghlan would dissuade the electorate from entering into the Union.|$|E
5|$|Elle {{manages to}} {{convince}} Paul to sign over {{his share of}} Lassiter's {{to her and she}} leaves him with nothing. Paul has a brain tumour removed and he loses his memory. He later apologises to his neighbours for all the bad things he did. Paul begins a relationship with Oliver's mother, Rebecca Napier, and she and her youngest son, Declan (James Sorensen), move in with him. Remembering that he murdered Gus, Paul confesses all to the police and Gus's sister Laura (Jodi Flockhart). The police inform Paul {{that they will not be}} pursuing the case, while Laura and her boyfriend Nick Thompson (Marty Grimwood) try to blackmail Paul by kidnapping Declan. Paul has an affair with Kirsten Gannon (Nikola Dubois) and Rebecca ends their relationship. Paul regains his <b>assets</b> <b>from</b> Elle and he buys the Erinsborough News. Paul briefly dates Cassandra Freedman (Tottie Goldsmith), but he and Rebecca soon reconcile. Paul is initially blamed for his half-sister Jill Ramsay's (Perri Cummings) death. He goes on the run, but his name is cleared by Jill's daughter Sophie (Kaiya Jones). When Paul and Rebecca get engaged, Lyn interrupts their wedding to announce she and Paul are still married. After divorcing Lyn, Paul marries Rebecca.|$|E

The CFC then {{withdrew from the}} southeast theater. In the weeks after, the Russian bloc suffered internal troubles, allowing N3 to regain all of the territory lost after B-R5RB and conquer most of the Russian bloc's territory. In the longer term, B-R5RB established CFC, later re-branded as The Imperium, as the predominant superpower in Eve Online, with little serious resistance challenging the coalition for the next two years.|$|E
