40|$|Extracts of milk coagulating enzymes were obtained, <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> {{from the}} abomasums of pasture fed cattle and lamb rennet from the abomasums of {{partially}} milk fed lambs slaughtered {{between three and}} six months of age. Both rennets were, {{in the presence of}} sodium chloride, most stable at 10 °C or lower at pH 4. 7 for <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> and pH 4. 1 for lamb. Heat treatment in a sodium chlorine solution (200 mg/ml) at 68 °C for 60 minutes destroyed less than 35 % of the activity of each rennet. Under the same conditions calf rennet was completely inactivated. The cheesemaking properties of <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> and lamb rennets were compared with calf rennet. <b>Adult</b> <b>bovine</b> and calf rennets responded similarly to changes of pH however lamb rennet appeared less active than calf rennet at higher pH's when measured in caseinate solution but appeared more active than calf rennet when measured in milk by a curd tension method. The optimum temperature for milk coagulating activity was 40 °C for <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> and calf rennets but only 30 °C for lamb rennet when measured in caseinate solution. The curd tension of milk coagulated with the three rennets increased with time but both <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> and lamb rennets appeared more sensitive to milk calcium levels than calf rennet. Whole casein, αs-, β- and k-caseins were hydrolysed in a similar manner by the three rennets. <b>Adult</b> <b>bovine</b> rennet was the most proteolytic on whole and β- caseins while calf rennet hydrolysed αs- and k-caseins more rapidly than the other rennets. Two pepsins, of similar amino acid compositions, were isolated, one from <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> rennet and one from lamb rennet which also contained a rennin. All three enzymes were purified so that lamb rennin and pepsin each produced only a single band on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis but the <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> pepsin produced two bands and appeared to be heterogeneous. Cheese made with <b>adult</b> <b>bovine,</b> lamb or a 50 / 50 mixture of calf-adult bovine rennets were compared with cheese made with calf rennet and found to be similar in manufacturing characteristics, flavour and body after three and six months storage at 6 or 13 °C. Polyacrylaride gel electrophoretograms of these cheese after one to twelve months storage at 6 °C showed that the milk coagulant had no effect on the casein degradation products produced in the cheese although the rate of degradation varied slightly. Perchloric acid was found to be a good protein precipitant for quenching casein-rennet reactions and was utilize in a ethod which was developed for assaying milk coagulating activity. Rennet was added to sodium caseinate solution and one minute later the reaction quenched with perchloric acid. The quantity of peptides hydrolysed from the casein was measured at 217 nm and was directly proportional to rennet activity over a limited range of activity. A method for removing mucoproteins, the major impurity in rennet, was developed and a commercial scale plant commissioned. A diethylaminoethyl cellulose based resin, equilibrated with a citrate buffer, retained the rennet enzymes while the mucoproteins passed through uninhibited. The enzymes were eluted with the same buffer made 1. 0 M with sodium chloride. The eluent was more active than the original rennet, was crystal clear in appearance and remained so during twelve months storage when normally mucoproteins would have precipitated out of solution to form a cloud in the rennet...|$|R

This study estimated the prevalence of infected herds and <b>adult</b> <b>bovines</b> and evaluated risk factors associated with the presence of tuberculosis within herds in the state of Paraná. The state was divided in seven livestock regions and independent sampling was performed. A total of 1, 419 farms were sampled and 16, 045 animals were tested using the intradermal comparative cervical tuberculin diagnostic test. The apparent and estimated prevalence rates in farms and adult bovine animals were 2. 15 % (95 % CI: 1. 31 - 3. 00) and 0. 42 % (95 % CI: 0. 04 - 0. 81), respectively. It was not possible to state with 95 % confidence that the disease prevalence in any region was significantly different from that in other regions. There were no positive animals in the western region, and the prevalence of positive herds and animals in the other regions ranged from 1. 03 % to 3. 89 % and 0. 17 % to 1. 08 %, respectively. The logistic regression model identified larger herd size (OR = 2. 4) and mechanical cmilking (OR = 5. 18) as risk factors associated with the presence of bovine tuberculosis. The combination of low prevalence with risk factors associated to larger herds and more intensive dairy farming, renders the state of Paraná a good candidate for the implementation of industry-based free-herd accreditation schemes and makes a case for planning risk-based surveillance targeted at major dairy basins...|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjectiveDetermine the {{kinetics}} of collagen crosslinking in <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> {{articular cartilage}} explants using radiolabel pulse-chase studies. MethodsExplant cultures of <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> articular cartilage were radiolabeled with [14 C]lysine in medium including {{fetal bovine serum}} and ascorbate, and then maintained for chase periods up to 28 days. In some samples, β-aminopropionitrile (BAPN) was included during chase to inhibit lysyl oxidase-mediated collagen crosslinking. Tissue was hydrolyzed and analyzed for [14 C]metabolites in the forms of lysine, hydroxylysine, dehydrodihydroxylysinonorleucine (ΔDHLNL), and hydroxylysyl pyridinoline (HP). ResultsExplant cultures of <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> articular cartilage metabolized lysine into hydroxylysine and the collagen crosslinks, ΔDHLNL and HP. During chase, [14 C]hydroxylysine maintained steady-state levels, [14 C]DHLNL rose to a plateau, and [14 C]HP increased gradually. Addition of BAPN inhibited formation of [14 C]DHLNL. Analysis of raw data and that normalized to [14 C]hydroxylysine gave characteristic time constants for formation of ΔDHLNL and HP crosslinks of 1 – 2 and 7 – 30 days, respectively. The distribution of [14 C]lysine metabolites in collagen crosslinks was described by peak values in [14 C]DHLNL/[14 C]hydroxylysine of 0. 047 – 0. 064 and in [14 C]HP/[14 C]hydroxylysine of 0. 03.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to visualize, at the ultrastructural level, the {{deformation}} and failure mechanism of cartilage matrix in the tensile mode. Full-thickness dumbbell-shaped specimens were prepared from <b>adult</b> <b>bovines.</b> There were two specimen groups; in the ‘parallel’ group the specimen axis was parallel to the split lines defining the preferential orientation of the collagen in the articular surface, and in the ‘perpendicular’ group the specimen axis was perpendicular to the split lines. Specimens were placed with the articular surface uppermost and subjected to a graded series of strain within individual mini-tension devices, while observed with stereomicroscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Thereafter, the changes in the ultrastructure were observed with both scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The mechanism of cartilage failure in the tensile mode comprised the following stages, whether the strain was applied parallel or perpendicular to the split line. (1) At 0 % strain a fibrillar meshwork within the articular surface was predominantly orientated in the direction of the split line. (2) As strain increased, the fibrillar meshwork became more orientated in the parallel group and reorientated in the perpendicular group in the direction of the applied strain. (3) After complete reorientation of the fibrillar meshwork in the direction of the applied strain, the initial sign of failure was rupture of the fibrillar meshwork within the articular surface. (4) Subsequently, the rupture rapidly propagated into the deeper layers. Greater strains were required for fibrillar reorientation and complete rupture in the ‘perpendicular group’ than in the parallel group...|$|E

O veneno liofilizado foi diluído em 1 ml de solução fisiológica e administrado a cinco bovinos, por via subcutânea, nas doses de 0, 0625, 0, 125 e 0, 25 mg/kg e a dois outros, por via intramuscular, nas doses de 0, 25 e 0, 45 mg/kg. Seis bovinos foram a óbito e um que recebeu a dose de 0, 0625 mg/kg, por via subcutânea, recuperou-se. Os sinais clínicos tiveram início entre 25 minutos a 5 horas 30 minutos após a inoculação. O período de evolução variou de 7 horas 18 minutos a 66 horas 12 minutos. Um animal recuperou-se após 92 horas. O quadro clínico, independentemente das doses, caracterizou-se por aumento de volume (hemorragia/hematoma) {{no local}} da inoculação, tempo de sangramento aumentado, mucosas hipocoradas e apatia. O exame laboratorial revelou progressiva anemia normocítica normocrômica, trombocitopenia, redução de fibrinogênio e proteínas plasmáticas totais, hematócrito e hemoglobina diminuídos, além de leve aumento dos níveis de creatinaquinase e desidrogenase lática. Á necropsia, havia, a partir do local da inoculação, extensos hematomas e áreas de hemorragia no tecido celular subcutâneo dos animais que receberam o veneno por via subcutânea; nos animais inoculados por via intramuscular, adicionalmente, havia hemorragia intramuscular. O endocárdio esquerdo apresentava extensas hemorragias e verificaram-se petéquias na serosa do rúmen e do omaso e na mucosa do abomaso e da vesícula biliar. Em cinco animais, o cólon, reto e região perirrenal estavam envoltos por coágulos de sangue. Ao exame histológico observou-se, além do quadro hemorragíparo, necrose muscular coagulativa, acompanhada de hemorragia, no entorno do local da inoculação nos animais que receberam o veneno por via intramuscular; essa lesão era discreta nos músculos próximos ao local de inoculação subcutânea. Nos bovinos deste estudo, o aumento de volume observado no local de inoculação e adjacências era constituído por sangue e não edema. Não foram observadas mioglobinúria, nem lesões macro ou microscópicas significativas nos rins. Este estudo indica que exemplares de B. alternatus, caso inoculem todo seu veneno, poderiam levar bovinos adultos à morte. Por outro lado, pelo fato de ofídios serem capazes de regular a quantidade de veneno inoculada e, possivelmente, não considerarem bovinos como presa potencial, é provável que o número de acidentes nessa espécie seja pequeno, o que está de acordo com o observado na maioria dos centros diagnóstico anátomo-patológico no país. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine the clinical-pathological alterations and laboratory findings in cattle inoculated with Bothrops alternatus venom, with the intention of providing information for the establishment of diagnosis and differential diagnosis procedures, as well as to elucidate some obscurities observed in the pertinent literature. The lyophilized venom was diluted in 1 ml of physiologic solution. It was administered to 5 bovines by the subcutaneous route at doses of 0. 0625, 0. 125 and 0. 25 mg/kg body weight, and to 2 bovines by the intramuscular route at doses of 0. 25 e 0. 45 mg/kg. Six bovines died and the only animal that survived, who had subcutaneously received the venom at a dose of 0. 0625 mg/kg, recovered. The first clinical signs were observed from 25 min to 5 h 30 min after the inoculation. The clinical evolution time varied from 7 hours 18 minutes to 92 hours. Regardless of the dose, the clinical picture was characterized by swelling (hemorrhage/hematoma) at the site of inoculation, increase in bleeding time and capillary refill time, paleness of mucous membranes and apathy. The laboratory exams revealed progressive normocytic normochromic anemia, thrombocytopenia, reduction in fibrinogen and total plasma proteins, decreased hematocrit and hemoglobin, and slight increase in creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. When subjected to necropsy, the animals that received the venom through the subcutaneous route showed large hematomas and hemorrhagic areas in the subcutaneous tissue, extending from the site of inoculation. The animals in which inoculation was performed intramuscularly exhibited, in addition, intramuscular hemorrhage. The left endocardium showed extensive hemorrhagic lesions, and petechiae were found on the serosae of rumen, omasum, abomasum and gall bladder. The colon, rectum and perirenal areas were surrounded by clotted blood in three animals. Besides hemorrhage, the histological examination revealed hemorrhage and coagulative muscle necrosis in the vicinities of the inoculation site in the animals that received the venom by the intramuscular route. These lesions were mild in the muscles close to the site of inoculation in the animals inoculated by the subcutaneous route. The swelling on the site of inoculation and its surroundings was a consequence of blood accumulation and not merely edema. Myoglobinuria and gross or microscopic lesions were not observed in the kidneys. This study indicates that B. alternatus can lead <b>adult</b> <b>bovines</b> to death if they release all their venom during a bite. Conversely, since venomous ophidians can control the amount of poison they inoculate and they probably do not identify bovines as potential preys, it is likely that the number of accidents involving this species is small, which is in agreement with the findings of the majority of the centers for anatomical-pathological diagnosis in Brazil...|$|E

To date, many in vitro injury models have used animal cartilage despite the greater clinical relevance of human cartilage. We aimed to characterize a new in vitro injury model using elderly human femoral head cartilage and compare its behavior to that of an existing model with <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> humeral head cartilage. DESIGN: Mechanical properties of human and bovine cartilage disks were characterized by elastic modulus and hydraulic permeability in radially confined axial compression, and by Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and direction-dependent radial strain in unconfined compression. Biochemical composition was assessed in terms of tissue water, solid, and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) contents. Responses to {{mechanical injury}} were assessed by observation of macroscopic superficial tissue cracks and histological measurements of cell viability following single injurious ramp loads at 7 or 70 %/s strain rate to 3 or 14 MPa peak stress. RESULTS: Confined compression moduli and Young's moduli were greater in elderly human femoral cartilage vs <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> humeral cartilage whereas hydraulic permeability was less. Radial deformations of axially compressed explant disks were more anisotropic (direction-dependent) for the human cartilage. In both cartilage sources, tissue cracking and associated cell death during injurious loading was common for 14 MPa peak stress at both strain rates. CONCLUSION: Despite differences in mechanical properties, acute damage induced by injurious loading was similar in both elderly human femoral cartilage and <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> humeral cartilage, supporting the clinical relevance of animal-based cartilage injury models. However, inherent structural differences such as cell density may influence subsequent cell-mediated responses to injurious loading and affect the development of OA...|$|R

Plaques developed after 24 hr of incubation at 37 C which were indistinguishable from viral lesions. Optimal conditions for plaques included: serum in the adsorption fluid as well as the overlay medium; 1 -hr adsorption time; healthy HeLa monolayers; and the presence of EBM. The formation of plaques instead of colonies in agar was due to the inhibitory effect of NBCS or EBM.

Total foetal Cu is related to the age of the foetus, but appears also to be largely independent of liver Cu concentrations of the dam...|$|R
40|$|In {{the course}} of the study on the {{hemoglobin}} contained in newborn bovine blood, two major and five minor components which are specific to newborn bovine hemoglobin were detected by the methods of agar-gel electrophoresis, cellulose-acetate membrane electrophoresis and column chromatography. These components were examined on their alkaline resistance, and the results showed that all the components of newborn bovine hemoglobin were less resistant than those of <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> hemoglobin, and that these components are different in their alkaline resistance one another. In addition, the quantitative changes of the components in newborn bovine hemoglobin accompanying the development after birth were investigated...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Pancreatic islets {{from pigs}} are largely used for {{experimental}} studies. However, pancreas harvesting requires modification of conventional slaughtering to reduce ischemia time. It {{has been shown}} that bovine pancreatic islets can be more easily obtained and they show satisfactory in vitro and in vivo function. To improve the isolation procedure we compared the effect of bovine donor age on islet isolation. METHODS: Islets were isolated by collagenase digestion and sequential sieving from calves (6 months of age) and from <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> (> 16 months of age). After isolation the number of islet equivalents was calculated and histological and immunohistochemical studies performed. The purity and viability of islet for each preparation was also estimated. In vitro function of islets was evaluated by static insulin secretion assay, and alginate encapsulated islets were transplanted in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats for in vivo functional evaluation. RESULTS: A significantly higher number of islets were obtained from calf pancreas, compared with <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> pancreas. Hystological examination showed intact morphologic features of islets. The purity of islet preparations was higher from calf pancreas than from adult pancreas. Cell viability, and insulin production in presence of high glucose concentration, were not affected by donor age. All animals receiving microencapsulated islets from calves showed normoglycemia for prolonged periods (17 - 40 days). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that pancreatic islet isolation is more efficient from juvenile <b>bovine</b> than from <b>adult.</b> Calf pancreas is a good and convenient source of tissue for massive islet isolation for experimental studies...|$|R
40|$|A direct {{immunofluorescence}} assay (DFA) (Merifluor; Meridian Diagnostics, Inc., Cincinnati, Ohio) {{was compared to}} an immunomagnetic separation (IMS) assay (Dynabeads; Dynal, Inc., Lake Success, N. Y.) coupled with immunofluorescent microscopy (Waterborne, Inc., New Orleans, La.) {{for their ability to}} detect low concentrations of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts in <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> fecal material. IMS-DFA resulted in a 2 -log-unit increase in sensitivity (10 oocysts/g) compared to DFA alone (1, 000 oocysts/g). The higher sensitivity obtained with IMS-DFA resulted from testing 2 g of fecal material instead of the 13 to 19 mg of fecal material tested in the DFA; the increased sensitivity was not attributable to a higher percent recovery...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE. The {{neurotrophic}} {{activity of}} pigment epithelium– derived factor (PEDF), an extracellular factor {{present in the}} retina, is mediated by binding to cell-surface receptors in responsive cell cultures. In the present study, the expression of PEDF receptors in native neural retinas from adult steers was examined. METHODS. Binding reactions were performed with 125 I-PEDF and fluoresceinated PEDF using plasma membranes, detergentsoluble membrane proteins, or cryosections of retina from <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> eyes. Radioligand-binding and competition analyses were performed with a computer-assisted program. Ligand blot analysis of detergent-soluble membrane proteins was performed with 125 I-PEDF followed by autoradiography. Ligandaffinity column chromatography of detergent-soluble membrane proteins was performed with PEDF-coupled resi...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThrombospondin 1 {{is present}} in {{articular}} cartilage and is synthesized by chondrocytes. <b>Adult</b> <b>bovine</b> articular chondrocytes in serum-free medium were evaluated in a solid-phase assay {{for their ability to}} attach to thrombospondin 1 isolated from human platelets. The chondrocytes attached to the thrombospondin 1 by a mechanism that was inhibited by a synthetic linear GRGDSP but not a GRGESP peptide. The cells, however, did not spread on thrombospondin 1, but did spread on fibronectin and Pep-Tite 2000, a synthetic RGD-containing peptide. Preincubation of thrombospondin 1 with EDTA irreversibly inhibited its capacity to attach to chondrocytes. We conclude that thrombospondin 1 binds to chondrocytes by its RGD sequence...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> (Bos taurus) {{intervertebral}} disc is primarily comprised {{of two major}} tissue types: The outer annulus fibrosus (AF) and the central nucleus pulposus (NP). We isolated several primary cell lineages of passage (P) 0 cells from the AF tissue omitting typically used enzymatic tissue digestion protocols. The cells grow past p 10 without signs of senescence in DMEM+ 10 % FCS on 0. 1 % gelatin coated/uncoated surfaces of standard cell culture plates and survive freeze-thawing. Preliminary analysis of the AF derived cells for expression of the two structural genes Col 1 a 1 and Col 2 a 1 was performed by PISH recapitulating the expression observed in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Background: Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides (Mmm) is the causative {{agent of}} {{contagious}} bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP), a respiratory disease of cattle, whereas the closely related Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. capri (Mmc) is a goat pathogen. Cyto-adherence is a crucial step in host colonization by mycoplasmas and subsequent pathogenesis. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the interactions between Mmm and mammalian host cells by establishing a cyto-adherence flow cytometric assay and comparing tissue and species specificity of Mmm and Mmc strains. Results: There were little significant differences in the adherence patterns of eight different Mmm strains to <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> lung epithelial cells. However, there was statistically significant variation in binding to different host cells types. Highest binding was observed with lung epithelial cells, intermediate binding with endothelial cells and very low binding with fibroblasts, suggesting the presence of effective adherence of Mmm on cells lining the airways of the lung, which is the target organ for this pathogen, possibly by high expression of a specific receptor. However, binding to bovine fetal lung epithelial cells was comparably low; suggesting that the lack of severe pulmonary disease seen in many infected young calves can be explained by reduced expression of a specific receptor. Conclusions: Mmm bound with high efficiency to <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> lung cells and less efficiently to calves or goat lung cells. The data show that cyto-adherence of Mmm is species- and tissue- specific confirming its role in colonization of the target host and subsequent infection and development of CBPP...|$|R
40|$|A three-step {{purification}} {{procedure for}} {{the isolation of}} heart muscle chalones is described. The method uses ultrafiltration followed by concanavalin A-Sepharose affinity chromatography and subsequent sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Analytical ultracentrifugation of the highly purified chalone fraction indicated a sedimentation coefficient of 16. 7 S and an average Mr of 715, 527. Chemical analyses have confirmed this protein to be a glycoprotein, and polypeptide analysis indicated the involvement of identical subunits in its composition. In vivo studies confirmed that the chalone isolated from <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> hearts inhibits DNA synthesis of newborn hamster hearts. In addition, it {{was found to be}} tissue and not species specific and had no cytotoxic effects on the target cells...|$|R
40|$|Class III beta-tubulin, {{isolated}} from <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> brain, is resolved into {{at least seven}} charge variants on isoelectric focusing gels. To identify the posttranslational modifications responsible for this heterogeneity, a mixture of brain tubulins was treated with cyanogen bromide and the C-terminal fragments from the class III beta-tubulin isoforms were then isolated by binding them to the monoclonal antibody TuJ 1. Combined use of tandem mass spectrometry and both subtractive and automated Edman degradation chemistry on the isolated peptides indicates {{that many of the}} isoforms differ by phosphorylation at Ser- 444 plus attachment of one to six glutamic acid molecules to the side chain of the first glutamate residue, Glu- 438, in the C-terminal sequence Tyr-Glu-Asp-Asp-Glu-Glu-Glu-Ser-glu-Ala-Gln-Gly-Pro-Lys...|$|R
40|$|Normal <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> aortic endothelial {{cells were}} {{infected}} with various recombinant retroviruses expressing one, two, or three human {{basic fibroblast growth factor}} (bFGF) proteins normally synthesized by an alternative use of translation initiation codons. We show {{here that the}} constitutive expression of the AUG-initiated from (18 kDa) leads the transfected cells to form colonies in soft agar. The expression of the high molar weight (HMW) forms (22. 5 and 21 kDa) initiated at one of the two CUG initiation codons allows cell immortalization, whereas the tumorigenic potential is reached when the three forms are constitutively expressed. Furthermore, we provide evidence that constitutive expression of (HMW) bFGF forms has a down-regulation effect on bFGF synthesis from the gene naturally active in parental endothelial cells...|$|R
40|$|Soluble and {{insoluble}} glycoproteins from <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> cerebellum {{have been}} separated by affinity chromatography on ConA-Sepharose and analyzed by {{polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis}} I 2 % in presence of SDS.

Electropherograms of the soluble and insoluble fractions {{as well as of}} the proteins not absorbed on ConA-Sepharose, display a very complex pattern. Soluble fractions present many sharp bands in the region of molecular weight above 100 k. Heterogeneity is lesser in ConA-binding proteins. The contamination by Concanavalin A is considered.

50|$|If either fetal or <b>adult</b> <b>bovine</b> serum is {{incorporated}} in the nutrient medium of cell cultures used to propagate PPV, it should be pretested for viral inhibitors. The same may apply to sera of several other species. Because replication of PPV is affected by mitotic activity, {{the effect of the}} serum on the cells is also especially important. In addition, cultures should be pretested for PPV contamination. Cultures are sometimes unknowingly prepared from infected tissues of fetal and postnatal pigs. Moreover, PPV can be accidentally introduced into cultures in several ways, including the use of contaminated trypsin. If contamination is detected before all cells are infected, the virus can be eliminated by repeatedly subculturing the cells in the presence of nutrient medium containing PPV antiserum.|$|R
