25|$|I find it {{very hard}} to say this truth. I am to blame for {{everything}} I did at that time. I am trying to erase all this and to be what I was not at that time. I am also to blame for what I did not do, for not trying to protect those prisoners. Regardless of the temporary nature of my then-post. I ask myself again and again, what could I have done that I didn't do? Thousands of innocent victims perished. Graves remain behind, refugees, destruction and misfortune and misery. I bear general part of the responsibility for this. There is misfortune on all sides that stays behind as a warning that this should never happen again. My testimony and admission of guilt will also remove blame from my nation because it is individual guilt, the guilt of a man named Dragan Obrenović. I stand by this. I am responsible for this. The guilt for which I feel remorse and for which I apologise to the victims and to their shadows. I will be happy if this contributed to reconciliation in Bosnia, if neighbours can again shake hands, if our children can again play games together, and if {{they have the right to}} a chance. I will be happy if my testimony helps the families of victims, if I can spare them having to testify again and thus relive the horrors and the pain during their testimony. It is my wish that my testimony should help prevent this ever happening again, not just in Bosnia, but anywhere in the world. It is too late for me now, but for the children living in Bosnia now, it's not too late <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> this will be a good warning to them.|$|E
500|$|The Don Dunstan Foundation was {{established}} at the University of Adelaide {{shortly before his death}} to push for progressive change and to honour Dunstan's memory.

At the inauguration of the body, Dunstan had said [...] "What we need is a concentration on the kind of agenda which I followed <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> my death will be useful in this". The foundation's primary work is the giving of scholarships; an additional aim is to promote causes championed by Dunstan such as human rights, social equality, multiculturalism and aboriginal rights.|$|E
500|$|Five {{days before}} the vote, United States President Bill Clinton, while {{recognizing}} the referendum as an internal issue of Canada, gave a minute-long statement extolling the virtues of a united Canada, ending with [...] "Canada {{has been a great}} model {{for the rest of the}} world, and has been a great partner of the United States, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> can continue." [...] While the statement provided relief in sovereignist circles for not being a stronger endorsement of the [...] "No" [...] position, the implication of Clinton, who was popular in Quebec and the leader of the province's most important trading partner, endorsing Canadian unity had strong reverberations in the electorate.|$|E

500|$|Gibraltar was an {{unhealthy}} {{place to live}} due to its poor sanitation and living conditions. It was repeatedly ravaged by epidemics of yellow fever and cholera, which killed thousands of the inhabitants {{and members of the}} garrison. An epidemic {{in the second half of}} 1804 killed more than a third of the entire population, civilian and military. Lord Nelson wrote the following March that he hoped that Gibraltar [...] "will escape the dreadful scourge of last autumn, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> General Fox has burnt down all the small houses at the back of the Town; and perhaps if half the Town went with them, it would be better for the Rock." ...|$|E

Lopez stated that: [...] "They all express {{different}} moments in love and that's what this album was about. You know, sometimes it's difficult, sometimes it's amazing, sometimes overwhelming, sometimes you just don't know what to do. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> I captured all of that on this album". MTV News noted that on the songs, Lopez might be [...] "giving us some insight about what she was dealing with in her personal life in the months before it was released".|$|E
500|$|This {{led to the}} {{building}} of the first council housing estate in Gateshead. Alderman Hodkin laid the foundation stone on 27 October 1920; as work commenced the Alderman demonstrated the authority's concerns, telling the local newspaper that: [...] "we can build houses, but we cannot build homes. Only the people themselves can do that <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> the spirit of ‘esprit de corps’ will prevail and this will be a model estate" [...] Demand was highthere were 427 applicants for the first twenty eight houses builtand the council built further tracts of housing in a broad triangle between Sodhouse Bank, Ermine Crescent and The Avenue, although central government withdrew its promised funding. By 1936, most of the social housing available as of 2012 was in existence and provides accommodation to over half {{of the population of the}} suburb.|$|E

I've got children and they say to me 'mummy, you talk to yourself all the time'. I realised how much I do have other people {{in my head and}} what a comfort they are to me. It's not just about those who experience voices through mental health, it's the voices we carry from our past, our future or experiences, <b>that</b> we manifest <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that's</b> something that an audience will identify with".|$|R
500|$|Johnson {{appeared}} in victory lane {{to celebrate his}} seventh win {{of the season in}} front of 90,000 who attended the race. Johnson also earned $267,001 in race winnings. Afterward, he said, [...] "I guess {{it could have been a}} statement we were sending. There was a lot of pressure. All week long, we wondered if we could step up like we did today. I'm very proud how we rose to the occasion.", he continued, [...] "When I go home tonight, I'm going to be (mentally) driving laps, what I think I need to do in qualifying trim so I can put my best effort in on Friday. Same thing for race practice on Saturday, and go racing Sunday. Texas was such a good lesson. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> the points we lost in Texas isn't what keeps us from winning this championship." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Lovely" [...] {{received}} generally mixed reviews. Gerrick D. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times said he {{was initially}} skeptical of the Robin and Katherine romance subplot, but said he liked how it was presented. [...] "It wasn’t contrived like other girl-on-girl scenes on television that we see. ... I just hate it when it’s used to seem 'edgy' or to sell an episode, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> isn't the case here." [...] Kennedy said the Bree and Orson scenes led to [...] "a tender moment", but said Susan was annoying and the Lynette plotline was somewhat insulting toward women. Isabelle Carreau of TV Squad {{said he was}} surprised Robin's back story was fleshed out so quickly, and speculated {{it could lead to}} a permanent role in the series. Carreau said the pairing of Robin and Katherine could be [...] "very interesting", and that {{the best part of the}} episode was the comical conversation between Robin and Karen McCluskey (Kathryn Joosten) at the end.|$|E
500|$|After a month out of work, Westley rejoined Stevenage on 30 March 2013, {{his third}} spell in charge at the club. On the appointment, Stevenage {{chairman}} Phil Wallace stated [...] "Graham was keen {{to come back}} to Stevenage and, although I met some strong candidates, without doubt I think he’s the best man for the job right now. The club enjoyed a great deal of success before he left last year and we moved forwards significantly in his time here on several levels". On his return, Westley said [...] "I'm really happy to be back, the training ground is fantastic, the club just keeps moving forward. All the facilities keep improving <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> I can come back and make another positive difference". In his first game back in charge of the club, Stevenage secured a 1–0 victory over Hartlepool United on 1 April. Stevenage ended the 2012–13 campaign in 18th-place, and Westley released four players and transfer-listed three others.|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} written by Lifehouse lead singer Jason Wade. [...] It was {{produced}} by American record producer Ron Aniello and was mixed by Brendan O'Brien. When asked about the song {{in an interview with}} Billboard, Wade said, [...] "It was the most uptempo, radio-friendly song. We all decided it was the right choice to release it as the first single." [...] He went on to describe his expectations when writing songs, saying, [...] "My ultimate goal in writing songs is to connect with people. In the lyrics, you don't tell the whole picture: You give a road to start on that people can relate to. We're honest, nice guys <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> comes across in everything we do." [...] After being asked how he wrote the song in an interview with Launch, Wade explained, [...] "I wrote that song without thinking about what was gonna happen to it and then it just kinda took over from there." [...] He also said in the interview that he wrote [...] "Hanging by a Moment" [...] in about five minutes.|$|E

That's Lexie and George. They’re really good friends and I can see the friendship evolving into something even greater. At least, that's what Lexie is hoping. She is my kind of girl. The girl who likes the guy {{because he is a}} GOOD guy and that's what George is. He is a good guy and that's something that Lexie could use now.
