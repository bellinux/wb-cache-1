5|$|As Baz, {{the player}} {{searches}} for Reg and Tel. Timmy, a Smartie rescued {{in the first}} mission, functions {{as a guide for}} the player: introducing other Smartie characters, and providing exposition of the scenario. The plot portrays the Smarties as suffering under the reign of the Sea Reapers and their Queen Sappho. Alluding to the film, The Magnificent Seven, Baz gathers the separated Meccaryns, and takes on a quest to solve the Smarties' predicaments. In a climactic cut scene, Sappho sacrifices Timmy to Kabuto, and the young Smartie's grandfather, Borjoyzee, becomes the player's guide. Baz leads <b>an</b> <b>escape</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> area, and sets up a base to lead a counterattack. Thereafter Delphi becomes the player's character. Yan, the Samurai Smartie serves as the guide for this story segment, giving instructions on Delphi's abilities. After completing the training missions under Yan, Delphi attacks Sappho's base and the Reapers, eventually confronting the queen in a boss fight. When defeated, Sappho summons Kabuto to destroy the Smarties, but Kabuto eats her instead.|$|E
5|$|From the mid-twentieth century, public {{architecture}} {{became more}} utilitarian, {{as part of}} the impulse to produce a comprehensive welfare state and the influence of modernism. The main thrust of post-war planning was in clearance and rebuilding. The process began in Paisley, where from 1955 the populations of districts were decanted, the buildings demolished and rebuilding began. The result in the first district, George Street/ Canal Street, were low flats built in render and reused rubble around landscaped courtyards, with a 15-storey tower at one end. As the post-war desire for urban regeneration gained momentum it would focus on the tower block, championed in Glasgow by David Gibson, convener of the city housing committee. Projects like the brutalist Red Road Flats (1964–69) originally offered hope of a new beginning and <b>an</b> <b>escape</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> overcrowded nineteenth-century tenements of the city, but lacked a sufficient infrastructure and soon deteriorated. They also made extensive use of asbestos as a fire retardant, leading to long term health problems for builders and residents. Robert Matthew (1906–75) and Basil Spence (1907–76) were responsible for redeveloping the Gorbals in Glasgow.|$|E
5|$|On March 27, the Russians {{received}} {{word about the}} earlier disastrous defeat at Wschowa. Peter I realized that {{the chances of a}} combined attack on Charles were now minimal. He ordered Ogilvy to attempt <b>an</b> <b>escape</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> encirclement at Grodno and a retreat towards Brest-Litovsk. Ogilvy carried out the order on April 4 and managed to break out unseen with his reduced army, leaving 8,000 men behind at Grodno who had died of starvation and sickness. Another 9,000 men were lost during the retreat as the Swedes pursued the Russians as far as Polesia, where they finally gave up the chase. Mazepa met a similar defeat, as he sent 4,700 men in an attempt to save the Cossacks trapped inside Lyakhavichy. Instead these were annihilated in the battle of Kletsk on April 30, after which the garrison in Lyakhavichy surrendered to the Swedes on May 12 and the fortress was destroyed. In total, almost 10,000 Cossacks were killed, out of the initial 14,000 who actively participated in the campaign.|$|E

5|$|Some {{of those}} who have {{attempted}} to find <b>an</b> <b>escape</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> impulse to power have resorted to forms of quietism or pacifism. One major proponent of such approaches was the philosopher Laozi. From Russell's perspective, such views are incoherent, since they only deny themselves coercive power, but retain an interest in persuading others to their cause; and persuasion is a form of power, for Russell. Moreover, he argues that the love of power can actually be a good thing. For instance, if one feels a certain duty towards their neighbours, they may attempt to attain power to help those neighbours (Russell 1938:215–216). In sum, the focus of any policy should not be on a ban on kinds of power, but rather, on certain kinds of use of power (Russell 1938:221).|$|E

The new confidence of this period can also be seen in infrastructure projects, of which the Forth Road Bridge (opened 1962) was a key example.|$|E

25|$|People {{have lived}} in Hetch Hetchy Valley for over 6,000 years. Native American {{cultures}} were prominent before the 1850s when the first Euro-Americans arrived in the Sierra Nevada. During summer, people of the Miwok and Paiute came to Hetch Hetchy from the Central Valley {{in the west and}} the Great Basin in the east, respectively. The valley provided <b>an</b> <b>escape</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> summer heat of the lowlands. They hunted, and gathered seeds and edible plants to furnish themselves winter food, trade items, and materials for art and ceremonial objects. Today, descendants of these people still use milkweed, deergrass, bracken fern, willow, and other plants for a variety of uses including baskets, medicines, and string.|$|E

When the artists got into the studio, they were there for one reason only, and that was to make hit music, some of which had the social consciousness that became a soundtrack for the civil rights movement.

25|$|Zinoviev {{was sent}} to the Frunze Military Academy but managed to finish only one course. While at the academy, he wrote a book about his {{experiences}} in the Winter War, which was published by Voenizdat in 1941. With the outbreak of war with Germany, he was appointed commander of the 6th Army's 393rd Rifle Division. Zinoviev led the division during defensive battles along the Siversky Donets in fall 1941. During the Barvenkovo-Lozovaya Operation in January 1942, the division reportedly captured 174 settlements. He was awarded a second Order of the Red Banner on 27 March for his leadership during the offensive. In May 1942, the division fought in the Second Battle of Kharkov. Along with the 6th Army, the 393rd was surrounded in the Izyum Pocket and destroyed. Zinoviev was seriously wounded on 29 May and taken prisoner by German troops. He {{was sent to}} a concentration camp in Germany but was transferred to a camp in Norway. Zinoviev was shot by the Germans for planning <b>an</b> <b>escape</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> camp.|$|E

At dawn the following morning, Pillow launched a strong assault against the right flank of Grant's army, pushing it back [...] Buckner, not confident of his army's chances and not on good terms with Pillow, held back his supporting attack for over two hours, which gave Grant's men time to bring up reinforcements and reform their line. Buckner's delay did not prevent the Confederate attack from opening a corridor for <b>an</b> <b>escape</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> besieged fort.
