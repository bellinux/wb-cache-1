5|$|The {{stony-iron}} Pallasite meteorites <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>connected</b> to the Pallas asteroid, being instead {{named after}} the German naturalist Peter Simon Pallas.

5|$|Despite {{the growth}} of the Internet, the {{characteristics}} of local area networks (LANs)--computer networks that do not extend beyond a few kilometers—remain distinct. This is because networks on this scale do not require all the features associated with larger networks and are often more cost-effective and efficient without them. When they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>connected</b> with the Internet, they also have the advantages of privacy and security. However, purposefully lacking a direct connection to the Internet does not provide assured protection from hackers, military forces, or economic powers. These threats exist if there are any methods for connecting remotely to the LAN.|$|E

5|$|The fourth upper premolar (P4) {{has four}} main, {{transversely}} placed crests; {{the description of}} S.bolligeri mentions an additional, centrally placed small crest. De Bruijn interpreted the four main crests as the anteroloph, protoloph, metaloph, and posteroloph {{from front to back}} and wrote that these crests <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>connected</b> {{on the sides of the}} tooth. Prieto and Böhme note that the posteroloph is convex on the back margin of the tooth. In Muscardinus, the number of ridges on P4 ranges from five in Muscardinus sansaniensis to two in M.pliocaenicus and the living hazel dormouse, but the protoloph and metaloph are always connected on the lingual (inner) side of the tooth. P4 is two-rooted in S.alpinus and three-rooted in S.bolligeri.|$|E
5|$|Like many earthstars, {{the fungus}} uses {{the force of}} falling raindrops to help {{disperse}} the spores, which are ejected in little bursts when objects (such as rain) strike the outer wall of the spore sac. The gleba is brown to grayish-brown, with a cotton-like texture that, when compressed, allows the endoperidium to flex quickly and create a puff of air that is forced out through the ostioles. This generates a cloud of spores that can then be carried by the wind. There are columellae (sterile structures that start {{at the base of}} the gleba and extend through it), which are usually not evident in the mature gleba, but apparent {{at the base of the}} spore sac. The columellae <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>connected</b> to the ostioles, but rather, terminate within the gleba at some distance from them. The capillitia (sterile strands within the gleba) are long, slender, free, tapering, unbranched, and 2–5μm thick, with thickened walls. The spores are spherical, nonamyloid, and are ornamented with irregularly shaped flaring protuberances up to 2μm high. They measure 3.9–4.8μm in diameter (without ornamentation), and 5.4–7.0μm including the ornamentation.|$|E
5|$|The {{teeth were}} long and slender, {{as opposed to the}} usually very short teeth seen in other abelisaurids. On each side of the upper jaws there were four premaxillary and twelve maxillary teeth, while the lower jaws were {{equipped}} with fifteen dentary teeth per side. In contrast to the robust-looking skull, the lower jaw was shallow and weakly constructed, with the dentary (the foremost jaw bone) connected to the hindmost jaw bones by only two contact points. The lower jaw was found with hyoid bones, in the position they would be in if the animal was alive. These slender bones, supporting the tongue musculature and several other muscles, are rarely found in dinosaurs because they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>connected</b> to other bones and therefore get lost easily.|$|E

5|$|The upper incisors are orthodont (with their {{cutting edge}} {{perpendicular}} to the plane formed by the molars) and have yellow to light orange enamel. On the lower incisor, the enamel contains series of fine ridges. The toothrows are longer than in eastern voalavo. As in Eliurus, the molars are incipiently hypsodont (high-crowned) and the individual cusps have lost their identities, having merged into transverse laminae that <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>connected</b> longitudinally. There are three laminae on each first and second molar, two on the third lower molar, and the laminae cannot be differentiated on the third upper molar. Although {{the first and second}} molars are similar to each other in size, the third (upper and lower) molars are conspicuously smaller. There are three roots below each upper and two below each lower molar.|$|E

25|$|According to a report, {{household}} surveys regularly return lower rural {{water supply}} coverage than estimates by the Ministry of Water and Irrigation (which are collected by district water engineers and urban {{water and sanitation}} authorities).

On-site systems include drain fields, which require significant area of land. This makes septic systems unsuitable for most cities.|$|E
