Any circuit which has the requisite poles and zeroes will also have the requisite response.

40|$|Abstract We {{studied the}} {{attenuation}} {{of local and}} regional earthquake body waves recorded by the seismic network of northeastern Sonora, Mexico (Red Sísmica del Noreste de Sonora [RESNES]). The source-station paths of the selected data set cover the epicentral region of the May 1887 (Mw 7 : 5) Sonora earthquake. We used the best-located earthquakes recorded by RESNES between 2003 and 2004 to analyze the spec-tral amplitude decay of body waves with hypocentral distance. The database consists of 44 earthquakes with magnitudes between 1. 8 and 3. 2 and hypocentral distances between 25 and 150 km. We calculated Fourier spectral amplitudes from more than 400 records and defined <b>attenuation</b> <b>functions</b> with a nonparametric model by invert-ing the observed spectral amplitudes at 23 individual frequencies between 0. 4 and 63. 1 Hz. We determined regional attenuation curves based on events located more than 100 km northwest {{of the center of}} the network and local curves based on earth-quakes located near the fault zone that ruptured in the 1887 earthquake. The obtained attenuation curves indicate that the spectral amplitudes decay faster {{in the area of the}} 1887 rupture than in the surrounding region. To analyze the possible sources of at-tenuation, we parameterized the <b>attenuation</b> <b>functions</b> considering three terms: one that accounts for geometrical spreading, another one for anelastic attenuation, and a third for near-surface attenuation.

40|$|A {{finite element}} method is {{presented}} for a nonlocal Timoshenko beam model recently proposed by the authors. The model relies on the key idea that nonlocal effects consist of long-range volume forces and moments exchanged by non-adjacent beam segments, which contribute to the equilibrium of a beam segment along with the classical local stress resultants. The long-range volume forces/moments are linearly {{depending on the product}} of the volumes of the interacting beam segments, and their relative motion measured in terms of the pure beam deformation modes, through appropriate <b>attenuation</b> <b>functions</b> governing the spatial decay of nonlocal effects. In this paper, the beam model is reformulated within a variational framework involving a consistent total elastic potential energy functional.

A local stiffness matrix and a nonlocal stiffness matrix contribute to the global stiffness matrix. While the local stiffness matrix is obtained by a standard assemblage of the classical element stiffness matrices, the nonlocal stiffness matrix is built as the sum of component matrices, each involving the stiffness of the long-range interactions between a couple of finite elements. A remarkable result is that, for most common <b>attenuation</b> <b>functions</b> of nonlocal effects, exact closed-form solutions can be found for every element of the nonlocal stiffness matrix.

Recent work proposes the use of <b>attenuation</b> <b>functions</b> as a data representation that summarizes the distribution of attenuation along the rays. This representation goes beyond conventional static images and allows users to dynamically explore their data, for example, to change color and opacity parameters, without accessing the original 3 D data.
