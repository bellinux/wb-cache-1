Challenging accusations of Haneke's cinematic approach being cold and cynical, Keuschnigg instead hailed the director as uncompromising and sincerely humanistic. Die Welts Peter Zander compared the film to Haneke's previous works Benny's Video and Funny Games, concluding that while the violence in the previous films had seemed distant and constructed, The White Ribbon demonstrates how it is a part of human society. Zander also applauded the [...] "perfectly cast children", whom he held as [...] "the real stars of this film". In Der Spiegel, Christian Buß opined that the work is [...] "a horror drama, free from horror images", and praised its deviations from conventions of contemporary German cinema, writing that [...] "Haneke forces us to learn how to see again".|$|E

More than simply an exercise to be determined and explained by power, negotiation requires an agreement on the appropriate notion of justice to govern the subsequent disposition of details and resolution of the conflict. This thesis is illustrated by five cases: negotiations over South-Western Africa (Namibia and Angola) between 1977 and 1988; over disarmament in Europe between 1984 and 1986; over the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis; and over two economic issues, the 1983 - 84 contract renegotiations between Ghana and its aluminum consortium and the 1977 - 79 trade negotiations over gas between Mexico and the United States...|$|R

50|$|Leroux's {{significance}} {{in the history of}} ideas lies in his attempt to resuscitate spirituality and community in France {{in the wake of the}} revolutionary decades of the 1790s and the Napoleonic Era. As was the case with many of his romantic socialist contemporaries, Leroux sought a basis on which to refound the human community that did not rely on the pillars of the old Regime, <b>authority,</b> <b>hierarchy,</b> and the Catholic Church. The span of his lifetime were years of the rise of capitalism and liberal trade policies, and also of the rise of an organized workers' movement. Romantic socialism as a movement attempted to reconcile religious and material needs in society. Leroux' most thorough exposition of this idea is found in his Doctrine de l'Humanité, published first in 1840. In this and other works he argues for a reciprocal notion of human need and identity, emphasizing humanity's interdependence in lieu of atomized individuality.|$|E

While we may wonder why he wishes to be human, this does indicate he admires and values humanity - a core tenet of friendly AI. He is not bound by the Three Laws of Robotics, as seen in [...] "The Most Toys", where {{he is willing to}} kill based on a moral judgment. He does not generalize the evils committed by individuals to a judgment about all of humanity, as many other AIs have. In [...] "The Measure of a Man", Data is legally declared an autonomous individual, showing humanity's willingness to accept AIs as equals and completing the loop - equality can not be achieved until both sides consider the other an equal.|$|E
5000|$|Legitimate {{power comes}} from an elected, selected, or {{appointed}} position of authority and may be underpinned by social norms. This power which means the ability to administer to another certain feelings of obligation or the notion of responsibility. [...] "Rewarding and Punishing subordinates is generally seen as a legitimate part of the formal or appointed leadership role and most managerial positions in work organizations carry with them, some degree of expected reward and punishment." [...] This type of formal power relies on position in an <b>authority</b> <b>hierarchy.</b> Occasionally, those possessing legitimate power fail to recognize they have it, and may begin to notice others going around them to accomplish their goals. Three bases of legitimate power are cultural values, acceptance of social structure, and designation. Cultural values comprise a general basis for legitimate power of one entity over another. Such legitimacy is conferred by others and this legitimacy can be revoked by the original granters, their designees, or their inheritors.|$|E

40|$|The general-care {{glass ceiling}} {{hypothesis}} states {{that not only}} is it more difficult for women than for men to be promoted up levels of <b>authority</b> <b>hierarchies</b> within workplaces but also that the obstacles women face relative to men become greater as they move rtp the hierarchy. Gender-based discrimination in promotions is not simply present across levels of hierarchy but is more intense at higher levels. Empirically, this implies that the relative rates of women being promoted to higher levels compared to men should decline with the level of the hierarchy. This article explores this hypothesis with data from three countries: the United States, Australia, and Sweden. The basic conclusion is that while there is strong evidence for a general gender gap in authority-the odds of women having authority are less than those of men-there is no evidence for systematic glass ceiling effects in the United States and only weak evidence for such effects in the other two countries...|$|R
5000|$|Falangism (Falangismo) was the {{political}} {{ideology of the}} Falange Española de las JONS and, afterwards, of the Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista (both known simply as the [...] "Falange"), as well as derivatives of it in other countries. Falangism is widely considered a fascist ideology. Under the leadership of Francisco Franco, many of the radical elements of Falangism considered to be fascist were diluted and it largely became an authoritarian, conservative ideology connected with Francoist Spain. Opponents of Franco's changes to the party include former Falange leader Manuel Hedilla. Falangism places {{a strong emphasis on}} Catholic religious identity, though it has held some secular views on the Church's direct influence in society, as it believed that the state should have the supreme authority over the nation. Falangism emphasized the need for <b>authority,</b> <b>hierarchy,</b> and order in society. Falangism is anti-communist, anti-capitalist, anti-democratic, and anti-liberal, although under Franco, the Falange abandoned its original anti-capitalist tendencies, declaring the ideology to be fully compatible with capitalism.|$|E

5000|$|Subversion (Latin subvertere: overthrow) {{refers to}} a {{process by which the}} values and {{principles}} of a system in place are contradicted or reversed, an attempt to transform the established social order and its structures of power, <b>authority,</b> <b>hierarchy,</b> and norm (social). Subversion can be described as an attack on the public morale and, [...] "the will to resist intervention are the products of combined political and social or class loyalties which are usually attached to national symbols. Following penetration, and parallel with the forced disintegration of political and social institutions of the state, these loyalties may be detached and transferred to the political or ideological cause of the aggressor". Subversion is used as a tool to achieve political goals because it generally carries less risk, cost, and difficulty as opposed to open belligerency. Furthermore, it is a relatively cheap form of warfare that does not require large amounts of training. A subversive is something or someone carrying the potential for some degree of subversion. In this context, a [...] "subversive" [...] is sometimes called a [...] "traitor" [...] with respect to (and usually by) the government in power.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{advances}} novel {{theory and}} {{evidence on the}} emergence of informal leadership networks in groups that feature no formally designated leaders or <b>authority</b> <b>hierarchies.</b> Integrating insights from relational schema and network theory, we develop and empirically test a 3 -step process model. The model’s first hypothesis is that people use a “linear-ordering schema” to process information about leadership relations. Taking this hypothesis as a premise, the second hypothesis argues that whenever an individual experiences a particular leadership attribution to be inconsistent with the linear-ordering schema, s/he will tend to reduce the ensuing cognitive inconsistency by modifying that leadership attribution. Finally, the third hypothesis builds on this inconsistency-reduction mechanism to derive implications about a set of network-structural features (asymmetry, a-cyclicity, transitivity, popularity, and inverse-popularity) that are predicted to endogenously emerge as a group’s informal leadership network evolves. We find broad support for our proposed theoretical model using a multi-method, multi-study approach combining experimental and empirical data. Our study contributes to the organizational literature by illuminating a socio-cognitive dynamics underpinning the evolution of informal leadership structures in groups where formal authority plays a limited role...|$|R

40|$|Data {{obtained}} from a manufacturing firm and a newspaper firm in India were {{used to examine the}} relationship between organizational politics and procedural justice in three separate studies. Study 1 constructively replicated research on the distinctiveness of the two constructs. Confirmatory factor analyses in which data from the manufacturing firm served as the development sample and data from the newspaper firm served as the validation sample demonstrated the distinctiveness of organizational politics and procedural justice. Study 2 examined the antecedents of the two constructs using data from the manufacturing firm. Structural equation modeling (SEM) results revealed formalization and participation in decision making to be positively related to procedural justice but negatively related to organizational politics. Further, <b>authority</b> <b>hierarchy</b> and spatial distance were positively related to organizational politics but unrelated to procedural justice. Study 3 examined the consequences of the two constructs in terms of task and contextual performance using data from the newspaper firm. Results of SEM analysis revealed procedural justice but not organizational politics to be related to task performance and the contextual performance dimensions of interpersonal facilitation and job dedication. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

What research {{there is more}} generally, has been over-shadowed in psychology and psychotherapy by the dominance of a pathologyoriented social system and values about what is good and how life should be lived "healthily". The aim {{of this research was}} to use a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, to investigate the ways in which Christians construe help-seeking for psychological problems from various sources. 14 committed Christians from a close-knit group in East London were participants in the study. Participants were interviewed using repertory grid methodology and, using the "Triadic method", 10 bipolar constructs were elicited for each person. The grids was then filled in, and the element and construct ratings were factor-analysed. The resultant factors were then returned to the participants, each being interviewed in order to elaborate, modify or interpret them from their own point of view. A thematic analysis of the interview transcripts was carried out. The analysis produced 4 significant themes: 1) Belief in the "intrusive spiritual", 2) Fami 1 iarity, friendship, trust and safety, 3) Secular professionals and 4) <b>Authority,</b> <b>hierarchy</b> and power.

This article draws on a series of interviews with moderators of online book-related sites, alongside close analysis of online interactions between moderators and users to consider issues of <b>authority,</b> <b>hierarchy,</b> power and control, asking how these act to structure or facilitate acts of interpretation taking place online. We begin by outlining the moderator's role before conducting a brief review of existing scholarship on offline reading groups and online communities, to identify how social infrastructures are established and negotiated. The main body of the article draws upon interviews with moderators of two online literary forums – The Republic of Pemberley and The Guardian’s online Reading Group – to explore the ways in which each of the respective moderators frames his or her role. This is accompanied by an in-depth exploration of how the forms of interpretation we find on the two sites are shaped and directed by the moderators.
