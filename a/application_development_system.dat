The error reports offered by Clang are also aimed to be more detailed and specific, as well as machine-readable, so IDEs can index the output of the compiler during compiling. Modular design of the compiler can offer source code indexing, syntax checking, and other features normally associated with rapid <b>application</b> <b>development</b> <b>systems.</b> The parse tree is also more suitable for supporting automated code refactoring, as it directly represents the original source code.|$|R
