40|$|University {{accreditation}} schemes, in {{some form}} or other, are ubiquitous among English-language speaking countries around the world. Some countries employ national or regional accreditation processes, and a few authors have explored the role of information literacy (IL) in these institution-wide accreditation practices. Little, however, has been written about IL in the context of accreditation standards developed by various professions to regulate the quality of university programmes educating future professionals in the field. This paper investigates the potential of these professional accreditation standards to advance the IL cause and give it a higher profile on campus. It undertakes a qualitative content analysis of the professional accreditation standards for three professions [...] nursing, social work, and engineering –in Canada, the United States (US), the United Kingdom (UK), and Australia to determine: a.) If (and in what context) the term IL is used in the accreditation criteria; b.) Other terms/language used in the accreditation criteria to describe IL and associated skills and competencies; and c.) Correlations between outcomes outlined in the <b>accreditation</b> <b>documents</b> and IL competencies outlined by the library profession. The study identifies trends, both within specific professions, and within the documents produced by each of the four countries under consideration. It reports significant variation in the language used in the professions to describe the concept of IL, highlighting the alternative language used in the various professions to describe this ability. The study also maps outcomes outlined in the <b>accreditation</b> <b>documents</b> to the Association of College and Research Libraries’ (ACRL’s) Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education ((ACRL 2000) in order to identify areas of overlapping concern. In doing so, this study helps familiarise librarians with the accreditation standards in several subjects, and provides a model for librarians to use in analysing accreditation standards in other subject areas in order to advance IL on their campuses...|$|R

With different audiences requiring more and more evidence, the use of an accountability system has become a necessity. But there is very little professional literature on the topic.

40|$|Background: The paper {{presents}} the Nofer Institutes of Occupational Medicine in Łódź's {{results of the}} assessment of individual dose equivalents Hp(0. 07) of medical staff exposed to X-rays in Poland in 2012. In addition, the collected data was analysed in terms of types of medical units performing medical procedures and the categorization of personnel. Material and Methods: Dosimetric service was provided for medical staff of interventional radiology departments occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation in terms of individual dose equivalents Hp(0. 07). In 2012, personal dosimetry Hp(0. 07) determinations were performed by the Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine in Łódź and covered 2044 employees from 174 health facilities. The determinations were performed using thermoluminescence dosimetry according to the procedure accredited by the Polish Centre for <b>Accreditation</b> (<b>document</b> number AB 327). The measurements were performed using ring-dosimeters in the periods of 1 or 2 months. Results: Mean annual individual dose equivalent Hp(0. 07) in 2012 was equal to 3. 3 mSv (annual limit for Hp(0. 07) is 500 mSv). The average value of annual individual dose equivalent Hp(0. 07) decreased comparing to the previous year. In 2012, no single case of exceeding the annual limit for Hp(0. 07) was reported. Data stored in the file indicates that more than 96 % {{of all of the}} annual doses did not exceed the level of 10 mSv. Conclusions: The analysis of data on occupational exposure to ionizing radiation confirms a stable level of exposure and satisfactory radiological protection in interventional radiology facilities monitored by the Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine in Łódź in Poland in 2012.

40|$|Background The {{incorporation}} of evidence-based practice (EBP) is widely recognised {{as a necessary}} process for entry-level health professional training. <b>Accreditation</b> <b>documents</b> reflect the practice standards of health professions. No previous study has assessed {{the extent to which}} EBP has been taken up by chiropractic regulatory/licencing authorities, known as Councils on Chiropractic Education (CCEs), around the world. The purposes of this study were to examine CCEs’ educational standards for signs of a positive and negative approach to EBP as indicated by the prevalence and use of the words evidence, research, subluxation and vitalism, and to make recommendations if significant deficiencies were found. Method We undertook a systematic audit of the educational standard documents of the various CCEs. CCEs were {{selected on the basis of}} the World Health Organisation. Two investigators identified the occurrences of terms explicitly related to EBP: evidence, evidence-based, research, subluxation and vitalism. This information was tabulated for comparative purposes. The date of the study was March 2016. Results Occurrences of the term evidence, as it related to EBP, was highest in the CCE-Europe (n[*]=[*] 6), followed by CCE-Australia (n[*]=[*] 2), and CCE-USA (n[*]=[*] 1). None were found in the CCE-International or CCE-Canada documents. The term research appeared most frequently in the CCE-Europe documents (n[*]=[*] 43), followed by CCE-USA (n- 32), CCE-Australia (n[*]=[*] 29), CCE-Canada (n[*]=[*] 9) and CCE-International (n[*]=[*] 8). The term subluxation was found only once (CCE-USA) and vitalism did not appear in any educational standard <b>documents.</b> Conclusions <b>Accreditation</b> bodies are powerfully positioned to act as a driver for education providers to give greater priority to embedding EBP into entry-level programs and shaping future directions within the profession. Terminology relating explicitly to EBP appears to be lacking in the educational standard documentation of CCEs. Therefore, future revisions of accreditation standards should address lack of terminology...|$|R

This study investigated the strategic planning process at two small colleges {{in order to understand}} how this process comes to be viewed as legitimate by internal constituencies. Legitimacy is the perception held by stakeholders that the process has value to the institution, has a transparent agenda, and the process and outcome have been well communicated to the various constituencies on campus. Those that are viewed as legitimate {{are much more likely to}} create a shared understanding of the institution and to move the institution forward. Specifically, this study examined how the president and other leaders on campus rely on existing funds of trust, relationships, good communication and transparent decision-making to create a legitimate strategic planning process that leads to change. ^ This qualitative study included thirty-three interviews with board members, presidents, senior staff members, faculty and staff at the two institutions, as well as a review of the strategic agenda, <b>accreditation</b> <b>documents</b> and the materials that were created to assist in drafting the final agenda. ^ The study found that the day-to-day decision-making practices of the president significantly influenced the perceived legitimacy of the strategic planning processes. The oversight of board members is required to ensure shared governance, but an active role is not necessary for the process to be perceived as legitimate. The views of junior and senior faculty toward the administration need to be understood before embarking on the process. Transparency and communication can be used throughout the process to engage individuals and build legitimacy. Finally, institutions not in financial crisis that spend time on strategic planning have the opportunity to create a shared understanding of the future for their institutions. ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Evaluating {{the quality}} of {{postgraduate}} medical education (PGME) programs through accreditation is common practice worldwide. Accreditation is shaped by educational quality and quality management. An appropriate accreditation design is important, as it may drive improvements in training. Moreover, accreditors determine whether a PGME program passes the assessment, which may have major consequences, such as starting, continuing or discontinuing PGME. However, there is limited evidence for the benefits of different choices in accreditation design. Therefore, this study aims to explain how changing views on educational quality and quality management have impacted {{the design of the}} PGME accreditation system in the Netherlands. Methods: To determine the historical development of the Dutch PGME accreditation system, we conducted a <b>document</b> analysis of <b>accreditation</b> <b>documents</b> spanning the past 50 years and a vision document outlining the future system. A template analysis technique was used to identify the main elements of the system. Results: Four themes in the Dutch PGME accreditation system were identified: (1) objectives of accreditation, (2) PGME quality domains, (3) quality management approaches and (4) actors' responsibilities. Major shifts have taken place regarding decentralization, residency performance and physician practice outcomes, and quality improvement. Decentralization of the responsibilities of the accreditor was absent in 1966, but this has been slowly changing since 1999. In the future system, there will be nearly a maximum degree of decentralization. A focus on outcomes and quality improvement has been introduced in the current system. The number of formal documents striving for quality assurance has increased enormously over the past 50 years, which has led to increased bureaucracy. The future system needs to decrease the number of standards to focus on measurable outcomes and to strive for quality improvement. Conclusion: The challenge for accreditors is to find the right balance between trusting and controlling medical professionals. Their choices will be reflected in the accreditation design. The four themes could enhance international comparisons and encourage better choices in the design of accreditation system...|$|R
40|$|How do {{health workers}} {{understand}} population health {{as a concept}} and {{as it relates to}} their practice? How does an accreditation of a health region lead to an understanding of a population health approach? The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore the extent to which health region staff understands population health and to determine how the Canadian Council on Health Services Accreditation (CCHSA) accreditation process addresses population health perspectives. The goal was to ascertain the knowledge, practices, and attitudes of the staff with respect to population health in general and with respect to an accreditation process in order to see how a health region integrates a population health component into its services. A case study of the Saskatoon Health Region (SHR) was used to determine how a health region can integrate a population health component into the design and delivery of its services. The case study was comprised of a literature review, secondary data review from the 2001 Accreditation Survey Report, and primary data collection from people involved in the 2004 accreditation self-assessment which took place in the health region from March through June, 2004, which was facilitated by the Canadian Council on Health Services Accreditation (CCHSA). Primary data was captured through the use of key informant interviews of twenty employees in the health region. The participants were selected from the sponsors and leads of the accreditation teams that are most connected to a population health perspective; other participants were invited from those teams. These teams were selected by the author after reviewing the results of the CCHSA 2001 Accreditation Report that highlighted areas for improvement. This variety of input from across the teams triangulated the responses. In addition, key informants representing senior management, (i. e. the medical health officer(s) and the Chief Executive Officer for SHR), were also interviewed. These people were included in order to capture the knowledge practices and attitudes of the visionaries and leaders of the region and their ideas with respect to the direction for population health. The thesis closes with a discussion on implications for the policy arena and opportunities for the CCHSA to improve the population health content in their <b>accreditation</b> <b>documents...</b>|$|R
40|$|The ethics {{literature}} {{within the}} engineering arena is long on opinions, but short on evidence {{as to the}} most effective curriculum models for incorporating an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility. Research related to professional ethics has primarily focused on assessment of student learning, rather than evaluation of curriculum integration methods. A limited {{number of studies have}} been published that compare two methods of curriculum integration, yet no rigorous studies that compare multiple methods of curriculum incorporation are known to exist. Without clear evidence of best methods, the debate will continue, {{and there will be no}} assurance that the methods currently in use are the most effective. Within this paper, a recently completed research program is described that evaluated the methods of assimilating ethics into the engineering curriculum to determine if a relationship exists between the curriculum models and the outcome on a nationally administered examination, engineering-specific standardized examination. The study’s population was engineering students during the time period between October 1996 and April 2005 enrolled at nine academic institutions in the southeast United States for which valuable data are available. A mixed-methods (quantitative and qualitative) research program was designed and executed. The qualitative aspects of the study focused on research questions related to the impetus and considerations given to curriculum changes made by the twenty-three discrete engineering programs that participated in the study. The qualitative research questions were investigated through a process of semi-structured interviews conducted with program representatives and evaluation of an extensive number of ABET Self-Study <b>accreditation</b> <b>documents.</b> Once the curriculum models utilized by the participating programs were identified and defined for the chronological limits of the study, a quantitative process was implemented to compare the curriculum models to performance on the ethics section of the Fundamentals of Engineering Examination. A student-level dataset of subject scores was obtained for all administrations of the Fundamentals of Engineering Examination for each of the participating programs. Statistical techniques were utilized to evaluate the relationship between curriculum methods and examination performance. This paper will provide a statement of the perceived educational issues and a comprehensive summary of the applicable literature. A detailed discussion of the study’s design and implemented methods will be presented. Subsequent publications will present the findings, discussion, and implications resulting from the completed study.

40|$|The {{impact of}} the {{introduction}} of Australia's competency-based Certificates of General Education for Adults (CGEA) in 1994 was examined through a participatory action research-based study. Data were collected from 3 sources: reflective journals kept by 12 practitioners, interviews with 13 practitioners, and related <b>documents.</b> <b>Accreditation</b> of the CGEA was credited with the following positive impacts: bringing adult literacy and basic education in from the margins; offering adult students access to mainstream credentials and pathways; and aiding development of good teaching practice by facilitating a more rigorous approach to theoretical underpinnings and curriculum planning/delivery. The following problems arising from introduction of the CGEA were noted: inadequate funding for required moderation and professional development; encouragement of "creaming" because of funding by outcomes; confusion regarding CGEA pathways...|$|R

The report serves three purposes: (1) to facilitate internal library management and planning in a comprehens-ive manner; (2) {{to serve as the}} library's self-study document as part of the Andrews University process for reaccreditation by the North Central Ass,. iation of Colleges and Schools; and (3) to serve as the library portion of the university's strategic planning process, which developed from the <b>accreditation</b> self-study. The <b>document</b> examines and analyzes all library functions using the 1986 Association for College and Research Libraries (ACRL) "Standards for College Libraries " as a guide. Majo...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to design performance metrics and respective formulas to quantitatively evaluate the achievement of set objectives and expected outcomes both at the course and program levels. Evaluation is defined as one or more processes for interpreting the data acquired through the assessment processes in order to determine how well the set objectives and outcomes are being attained. Even though assessment processes for <b>accreditation</b> are well <b>documented</b> but existence of an evaluation process is assumed. This paper focuses on evaluation process to provide insights and techniques for data interpretation. It gives a complete evaluation process from the data collection through various assessment methods, performance metrics, to the presentations in the form of tables and graphs. Authors hope that the articulated description of evaluation formulas will help convergence to high quality standard in evaluation process...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the methods of}} incorporating professionalism and ethics in the engineering curriculum to determine {{the nature of the}} relationship between the curriculum model used and outcomes on a nationally administered, engineering-specific standardized examination. The study’s population included engineering students enrolled at one of nine southeastern public universities between October 1996 and April 2005. The institutions are partners in the Multiple-Institution Database for Investigating Engineering Longitudinal Development (MIDFIELD) project. ^ A mixed-methods (quantitative and qualitative) research program was designed and implemented. The qualitative aspects of the study focused on research questions related to the impetus and considerations given to curriculum changes made by the 23 engineering programs that participated in the study. The qualitative research questions were investigated using semi-structured interviews conducted with program representatives and evaluation of 49 ABET Self-Study <b>accreditation</b> <b>documents.</b> The curriculum model used by each of the participating programs were identified and defined for the period of the study and quantitatively compared to performance on the ethics section of the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) Examination. The FE Examination is prepared and administered by the National Council for Engineering and Surveying (NCEES) and is the only nationally administered, engineering-specific, standardized assessment that measures performance on ABET-related criteria. A student-level dataset of subject scores was obtained for the FE Examination for all of the MIDFIELD programs. This study represents the first published attempt to utilize NCEES data for the purpose of rigorous educational research. Statistical techniques were used to evaluate the relationship between curriculum methods and examination performance. ^ The findings indicate a statistical relationship, but a lack of structure between the amount of required professional and ethical content in the curriculum and performance on the ethics section of the FE Examination. Thus, while a relationship exists between the quantity of professional and ethical content and the ethics-based assessment tool used in this study, quantity does not appear to be the most significant variable. A possible implication of these findings is that quality of instruction has a greater influence on professional and ethical learning than does the quantity of courses or credits. The findings of this study will have significant bearing on the considerations made by engineering programs when they consider potential professionalism-based and ethics-based changes in what is perceived to be a crowded engineering curriculum. Specifically, engineering programs are encouraged to consider focusing on improvements in instructional methods and instructional environments, as well as ensuring that individuals responsible for delivery of professional and ethical content are in fact excellent instructors. Concurrently, ABET is encouraged to ensure that constructive and detailed feedback is provided to engineering programs on all eleven outcomes listed in the Engineering Criteria 2000 as part of the accreditation review process. Finally, to encourage the use of the FE Examination as an instrument for rigorous educational research, NCEES must consider being more transparent in the release of psychometric properties and preparation guidelines for the Examination. ...|$|R
40|$|Jobs are {{available}} for university graduates with entrepreneurship skills, but unemployment in Morocco persists because of the dissociation between university entrepreneurship graduate skills and professional market demand. While university graduates have achieved academic standards, they have lacked the entrepreneurial attributes to be employable. The purpose of this case {{study was to explore}} the use of entrepreneurship learning initiatives at UniversitÃ© Internationale de Casablanca (UIC), a private for-profit university, to promote students 2 ̆ 7 employability. The constructivism and learning paradigm frameworks served as the theoretical foundations of this project study. The research questions addressed the effectiveness of entrepreneurship learning strategies in the promotion of students 2 ̆ 7 employment and self-employment and what challenged their implementation at UIC. Data were collected from 11 individual interviews with students, academic leaders, and business professionals and from <b>accreditation</b> application <b>documents.</b> The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and hand analyzed for the discovery of thematic codes. Results indicated that the implementation of a capstone project model could cultivate entrepreneurial student experience. It was recommended that comprehensive business plan capstone projects presented the opportunity of integrating experiential learning activities and assessment tools to develop the entrepreneurial mindset of undergraduate students and increase their affective attachment to the course and the university. Implications for social positive change included the use of entrepreneurship learning to foster internal collaboration among faculty, promote university external partnerships, and create an experiential learning environment that motivates students to learn and achieve professional immersion...|$|R
