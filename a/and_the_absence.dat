Several genetic factors provide some resistance to it including sickle cell trait, thalassaemia traits, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of Duffy antigens on red blood cells.|$|E

Non-operative management may include activity modification, protected weight bearing (partial or non-weight bearing), and immobilization. The goal of non-operative intervention is to promote healing in the subchondral bone and prevent potential chondral collapse, subsequent fracture, and crater formation.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal {{succumbed to}} a 4–1 defeat in their opening match against Spartak Moscow, {{which was the}} biggest loss inflicted on the club in 18 years. The team let slip a two-goal lead against Bayern Munich at Highbury on 5 December 2000, before winning 1–0 at Olympique Lyonnais to keep their {{aspirations}} of qualifying for the quarter-finals attainable. In the reverse fixture, an equaliser scored by Edmílson in the last minute of normal time prompted Wenger to rue fatigue <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of captain Adams. Arsenal defeated Spartak Moscow by a solitary goal {{and in spite of}} losing to Bayern Munich on 14 March 2001, Lyon's draw with Spartak Moscow meant Arsenal qualified for the quarter-finals by the head-to-head rule.|$|E

Its monopoly covered large volume parenteral fluids, irrigating solutions and parenteral nutrition fluids. However, Baxter faced competition in the market for peritoneal dialysis fluids (PD fluids).|$|E

As a result, he rejected the need for elections, claiming that representative democratic systems served the interests of socio-economic elites.

He insisted that parental background had a key role in preventing crime and called for zero tolerance of knife crime, claiming that not enough criminals were being sent to jail.|$|E

There are numerous street children, whose poverty and lack of documented identity brings them into constant conflict with local law enforcement.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} who, if anyone, {{was in charge}} of the ship at this point, as Luke Collingwood had been gravely ill for some time. The man who would {{normally}} have replaced him, first mate James Kelsall, had been previously suspended from duty following an argument on 14November. Robert Stubbs had captained a slave ship several decades earlier and he temporarily commanded Zong during Collingwood's incapacitation, but he was not a registered member of the vessel's crew. According to historian James Walvin, the breakdown of the command structure on the ship might explain the subsequent navigational errors <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of checks on supplies of drinking water.|$|E
5|$|Molecular {{techniques}} {{have been developed}} to help with conservation efforts of stipitate hydnoid fungi, including H.peckii. While the distribution of the fungus has traditionally been determined by counting the fruit bodies, this method has a major drawback in that fruit bodies are not produced consistently every year, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of fruit bodies is not an indication of the absence of its mycelium in the soil. More modern techniques using the polymerase chain reaction to assess the presence of the fungal DNA in the soil have helped alleviate the issues in monitoring the presence and distribution of fungi mycelia.|$|E

5|$|Myriostoma {{had been}} {{classified}} in the family Geastraceae until 1973, when British mycologist Donald Dring placed it in the Astraeaceae based {{on the presence of}} trabeculae (stout columns that extend from the peridium to the central core of the fruit body) in the gleba, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of a true hymenium. In his 1989 monograph, Stellan Sunhede returned it to the Geastraceae. Molecular analysis of DNA sequences has confirmed the traditional belief that Myriostoma and Geastrum are closely related.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{preferred}} the Nintendo64 port over the arcade release, and appreciated its audiovisual enhancements, but felt that its graphical upgrades and memorization-based combo gameplay were insufficient {{when compared to}} fighting games like Tekken 2 and Virtua Fighter 2. Critics recommended Gold primarily for fans of the series and genre, but IGN reported that even fans were upset by changes in the combo system <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of several well-liked characters. Gold ultimately did not replicate the success of its Super NES predecessor, and the series remained dormant through its 2002 acquisition by Microsoft until its 2013 reboot.|$|E
