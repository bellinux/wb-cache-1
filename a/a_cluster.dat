5|$|<b>A</b> <b>cluster</b> is a {{group of}} loosely coupled {{computers}} that work together closely, so that in some respects they can be regarded as a single computer. Clusters are composed of multiple standalone machines connected by a network. While machines in <b>a</b> <b>cluster</b> {{do not have to be}} symmetric, load balancing is more difficult if they are not. The most common type of cluster is the Beowulf cluster, which is <b>a</b> <b>cluster</b> implemented on multiple identical commercial off-the-shelf computers connected with a TCP/IP Ethernet local area network. Beowulf technology was originally developed by Thomas Sterling and Donald Becker. The vast majority of the TOP500 supercomputers are clusters.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this work}} is to define <b>a</b> <b>clustering</b> {{algorithm}} starting from the pretopological results related to the minimal closed subset concepts. However the minimal closed subsets algorithm generally does not lead us to <b>a</b> <b>clustering</b> of the population under interest. Thus, we propose to define <b>a</b> new <b>clustering</b> method, based on this algorithm. Our method involves two steps: the first one consists in structuring the population by the minimal closed subsets method and the second one consists in building <b>a</b> <b>clustering</b> of the population, starting from the previously obtained structuring. This method is tested on data from the ”CRAM ” of Lyon and from the emergency service of ”Hôpital Edouard Herriot ” of Lyon...|$|R

5|$|On {{the largest}} scale, the Universe is {{continually}} expanding, {{resulting in an}} average increase in the separation between individual galaxies (see Hubble's law). Associations of galaxies can overcome this expansion on a local scale through their mutual gravitational attraction. These associations formed early in the Universe, as clumps of dark matter pulled their respective galaxies together. Nearby groups later merged to form larger-scale clusters. This on-going merger process (as well as an influx of infalling gas) heats the inter-galactic gas within <b>a</b> <b>cluster</b> to very high temperatures, reaching 30–100 megakelvins.
