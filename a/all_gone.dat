5|$|When {{formed in}} 1847, Sullivan County had no boroughs. The unincorporated village of Cherry Hill in Cherry Township {{served as the}} first county seat until 1850, when Laporte was founded in the {{geographic}} center of the county, and became its new county seat. In 1850 {{the population of the}} county was 3,694 and it grew steadily to a peak of 12,134 in 1900. This was just after the borough of Eagles Mere was incorporated as the last of the county's municipalities, in 1899. Much of this growth was fueled by lumber-based industry, but the virgin forests were almost <b>all</b> <b>gone</b> by 1900 and the population declined in eight of eleven decades since then, decreasing by a total of 47% between 1900 and 2010.|$|E
5|$|Out {{of sight}} of the band members, two of the gunmen placed a ten-pound (4.5kg) time bomb {{in the rear of the}} minibus. The UVF's plan was that the bomb would explode once the minibus had reached Newry, killing all on board. However, Martin Dillon alleged that the bomb was meant to go off in the Irish Republic. He {{suggested}} that had <b>all</b> <b>gone</b> according to plan, the loyalist extremists would have been able to clandestinely bomb the Republic of Ireland, yet claim that the band were republican bomb-smugglers carrying explosives on behalf of the IRA. They had hoped to embarrass the Government of Ireland, as well as to draw attention to its level of control of the border. This may have resulted in the Irish authorities enforcing tighter controls over the border, thus restricting IRA operations. Dillon opined that another reason the UVF decided to target the Miami Showband was because Irish nationalists held them in high regard; to attack the band was to strike the nationalists indirectly.|$|E

25|$|Rain {{frustrated}} both Australia {{and neutral}} fans {{on the morning}} of the fourth day, but after four hours the sun finally broke through and the covers were taken off. It only took ten overs for Australia to wrap up England's innings, McGrath taking four of the five wickets required and Warne the last – Giles, Hoggard, Harmison and Simon Jones <b>all</b> <b>gone</b> for ducks – as England could only add 24 runs, 22 of them from Pietersen who was left stranded on an unbeaten 64 to have a Test batting average of 121 after the first match.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} majors and pioneers, {{there were other}} BMX {{governing}} bodies, both national and regional and past and present. Among them were the Bicycle Motocross League (BMXL); the United Bicycle Racers Association (UBR) (1977–1983); the United States Bicycle Motocross Association (USBA) (1984–1986), which merged with the ABA {{at the end of}} the 1986 racing season after financial trouble made it unsustainable; the International Cycling Association (ICA), which was started in part by professional racer Greg Hill in 1990; and the Southeast Region-based National Pedal Sport Association (NPSA) (1975–1988). They are <b>all</b> <b>gone</b> now, but they did affect, for good or ill, the American BMX scene.|$|E
25|$|At Rutherford's behest, Geiger and Marsden {{performed}} {{a series of}} experiments where they pointed a beam of alpha particles at a thin foil of metal and measured the scattering pattern by using a fluorescent screen. They spotted alpha particles bouncing off the metal foil in all directions, some right back at the source. This should have been impossible according to Thomson's model; the alpha particles should have <b>all</b> <b>gone</b> straight through. Obviously, those particles had encountered an electrostatic force far greater than Thomson's model suggested they would, which in turn implied that the atom's positive charge was concentrated in a much tinier volume than Thomson imagined.|$|E

Wiczling had already served as session drummer for the Friend or Foe album and had even re-recorded the drum part for Goody Two Shoes to fit the album sound – it was this reworked version of the song that achieved US success. The album sessions had also featured session brass players Jeff Daly and Martin Drover.|$|E
25|$|She was {{the only}} {{daughter}} of Dr George Mitford, or Midford, who apparently trained as a medical doctor, and Mary Russell, a descendant of the aristocratic Russell family who grew up near Jane Austen and was an acquaintance of hers when young. At ten years old in 1797, young Mary Russell Mitford won her father a lottery ticket worth £20,000, but by the 1810s the small family suffered financial difficulties. In the 1800s and 1810s they lived in large properties in Reading and then Grazeley (in Sulhamstead Abbots parish), but, when the money was <b>all</b> <b>gone</b> after 1819, they lived on a small remnant of the doctor's lost fortune and the proceeds of his daughter's literary career. He {{is thought to have}} inspired Mary with the keen delight in incongruities, the lively sympathy, self-willed vigorous individuality, and tolerance which inspire so many of her sketches of character. She cared for her mother and father until their deaths and supported them and herself by proceeds from her writing.|$|E

500|$|Towards {{the end of}} winter, the Cheyenne camp on Powder River was {{attacked}} and destroyed; however, most of the Indians escaped. [...] Because they now had no possessions during winter, the Cheyenne moved to join their allies, the Ogallala Sioux, led by Crazy Horse. [...] Together they moved north-east to Chalk Butte to join the Uncpapa Sioux, led by Sitting Bull. [...] At some point the Minneconjoux Sioux under Lame Deer also joined the group. [...] The Indians had to continually move their camp to find enough game and grazing for {{the large numbers of}} people and horses. [...] The Arrows <b>all</b> <b>Gone</b> Sioux then joined, and then the Blackfeet Sioux. [...] Small groups of other tribes, such as the Waist and Skirt Indians, the Assiniboines, and Burned Thigh Sioux also joined.

500|$|On 26 May, Marlborough reached Coblenz, {{where the}} Moselle meets the Rhine. If he {{intended}} an attack along the Moselle the Duke must now turn west, but, instead, {{the following day}} the army crossed to the right bank of the Rhine, (pausing to add 5,000 waiting Hanoverians and Prussians). [...] "There will be no campaign on the Moselle", wrote Villeroi who had taken up a defensive position on the river, [...] "the English have <b>all</b> <b>gone</b> up into Germany." [...] A second possible objective now occurred to the French – an Allied incursion into Alsace and {{an attack on the}} city of Strasbourg. Marlborough skillfully encouraged this apprehension by constructing bridges across the Rhine at Philippsburg, a ruse that not only encouraged Villeroi to come to Tallard's aid in the defence of Alsace, but one that ensured the French plan to march on Vienna remained paralysed by uncertainty.|$|E
