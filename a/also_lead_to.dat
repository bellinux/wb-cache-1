5|$|Because of self-irradiation, {{a sample}} of {{plutonium}} fatigues throughout its crystal structure, meaning the ordered arrangement of its atoms becomes disrupted by radiation with time. Self-irradiation can <b>also</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> annealing which counteracts some of the fatigue effects as temperature increases above 100K.|$|E
5|$|Errors in {{procedure}} can <b>also</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> {{errors in}} the results. If 1% of the benzene in a modern reference sample accidentally evaporates, scintillation counting will give a radiocarbon age that is too young by about 80 years.|$|E

5|$|Long-standing {{elevated}} {{uric acid}} levels (hyperuricemia) {{may result in}} other symptoms, including hard, painless deposits of uric acid crystals known as tophi. Extensive tophi may lead to chronic arthritis due to bone erosion. Elevated levels of uric acid may <b>also</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> crystals precipitating in the kidneys, resulting in stone formation and subsequent urate nephropathy.|$|E
5|$|Morphological {{analyses}} tend {{to recover}} a conchiferan clade that receives less support from molecular analyses, although these results <b>also</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> unexpected paraphylies, for instance scattering the bivalves throughout all other mollusc groups.|$|E
5|$|The chronically low oxygen {{levels in}} the blood <b>also</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> {{increased}} release of erythropoietin and the activation of erythropoeisis, the production of red blood cells. This results in polycythemia, abnormally increased numbers of circulating red blood cells and an elevated hematocrit.|$|E

Barbed wire may <b>also</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> casualties; this can be ameliorated by removing old or unnecessary barbed wire or marking it with bright paint.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{industries}} and sources have been implicated, including {{high levels of}} dust in coal mining, gold mining, and the cotton textile industry, occupations involving cadmium and isocyanates, and fumes from welding. Working in agriculture is also a risk. In some professions the risks have been estimated as equivalent to that of one half to two packs of cigarettes a day. Silica dust and fiberglass dust exposure can <b>also</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> COPD, with the risk unrelated to that for silicosis. The negative effects of dust exposure and cigarette smoke exposure appear to be additive or possibly more than additive.|$|E
5|$|As Evolve is multiplayer-focused, {{the design}} team put less time and focus into {{developing}} Evolves narrative and campaign. Conversations between characters were reduced during the multiplayer mode as the design team {{thought that it}} would negatively impact on the conversations between players. However, the story and narrative became more significant in the single-player mode. Evolve does not adapt traditional storytelling methods, nor use a campaign mode, instead, players learn about the Hunters' backstory and the fictional world of Shear by slowly progressing through Evolve. Playing as different characters would <b>also</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> different conversations and dialogues between characters.|$|E

5|$|Damage to the {{oculomotor nerve}} (III) can cause double vision (diplopia) and {{inability}} {{to coordinate the}} movements of both eyes (strabismus), also eyelid drooping (ptosis) and pupil dilation (mydriasis). Lesions may <b>also</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> inability to open the eye due to paralysis of the levator palpebrae muscle. Individuals suffering from a lesion to the oculomotor nerve may compensate by tilting their heads to alleviate symptoms due to paralysis {{of one or more}} of the eye muscles it controls.|$|E
5|$|Erythromycin {{and other}} {{macrolides}} or clindamycin are recommended {{for people with}} severe penicillin allergies. First-generation cephalosporins {{may be used in}} those with less severe allergies and some evidence supports cephalosporins as superior to penicillin. Streptococcal infections may <b>also</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> acute glomerulonephritis; however, the incidence of this side effect is not reduced by the use of antibiotics.|$|E
5|$|Gyromitra esculenta has a {{wrinkled}} surface (similar to brainlike convolutions), not wavy or bumpy like G.infula. Gyromitra ambigua {{is very similar}} in appearance, and although it is usually not possible to discern between the two species without examining microscopic characteristics, G.ambigua {{is said to have}} more pronounced purple tints in the stipe. G.ambigua has larger spores that are about 22–30µm long. The saddle-shaped cap of G.infula might <b>also</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> confusion with some species of Helvella, but these latter fungi typically have grayer colors and thinner, fluted stipes.|$|E

In some studies, mutations in {{the central part of the}} gene have been associated with a higher risk of ovarian cancer and a lower risk of prostate cancer than mutations in other parts of the gene. Several other types of cancer have also been seen in certain families with BRCA2 mutations.|$|E

He also hosted Fox's short-lived 2001 horror anthology Night Visions.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{coloration}} {{could be}} exploited industrially and commercially, and research {{that could lead}} to such applications is under way. A direct parallel would be to create active or adaptive military camouflage fabrics that vary their colours and patterns to match their environments, just as chameleons and cephalopods do. The ability to vary reflectivity to different wavelengths of light could <b>also</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> efficient optical switches that could function like transistors, enabling engineers to make fast optical computers and routers.|$|E

Within a few days, these were supplanted by the Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC), a network stress-testing application allowing users to flood a server with TCP or UDP packets. The LOIC soon became a signature weapon in the Anonymous arsenal; however, it would <b>also</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> a number of arrests of less experienced Anons who failed to conceal their IP addresses. Some operators in Anonymous IRC channels incorrectly told or lied to new volunteers that using the LOIC carried no legal risk.|$|E
5|$|The {{decline in}} C. graminis {{is likely to}} be due to habitat loss {{resulting}} from land improvement and arable conversion, over-grazing, development, drainage and lowering of water-tables due to over-abstraction. Neglect may <b>also</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> loss or degradation of habitat such as through over-shading or competition of food-plants with invasive species such as Himalayan balsam (Impatiens glandulifera). Flood-bank works may deplete or destroy local sub-populations.|$|E
5|$|As older {{problems}} are solved, more complexities are being introduced, like adding additional parts to an engine. Interaction {{of these new}} parts, or niches, create emergent properties, like time-saving office devices (e.g. email, mobile computers, etc.) make communication more efficient but also expand the network of contacts and {{increase the amount of}} time spent on such duties. Homer-Dixon relates this to complexity theory explaining that as new niches are filled there is a synergistic burst of simplicity. However, this can <b>also</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> less control or freedom as emergent properties are created, like a new government program leading to a sprawling bureaucracy. Information theory is touched upon relating the amount of information required to describe a system and the degree of that system's complexity. Chaos theory is used to describe how small changes can lead to widely varying results and path dependence.|$|E
