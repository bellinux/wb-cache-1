However, O'Brien cautions that unions have been only peripherally involved in this process, and remain ambivalent about its potential effects.

25|$|According to {{the theory}} of the ideologues of the Udmurt Vos movement, the whole of nature is {{determined}} by the numinous presence of divinity, gods and spirits. Existence has three basic levels: the cosmic, in which the central divinity Inmar takes first place; that of the aerial elements, the heavens, Kvaz'; and the earthly creation, the world of creatures, Kelchin'. Alongside the hierarchy of Inmar, Kvaz' and Kelchin' there is Lud (the world tree), genius (breeder) of all spirits, which is not good nor evil.

The equipment is usually purchased from an American supplier (although some merchants have attempted to set up shop in Canada) and the services are billed to an American postal address.

25|$|However, {{a series}} of {{problems}} {{have been associated with}} dams on the Salween. The Salween is one of the longest free-flowing rivers in Southeast Asia and is one of only two major free-flowing rivers in China. The river supports thousands of species of plants and animals and is vital to the livelihoods of the many native cultures that live alongside it. It provides water for approximately 7-10 million people and supplies irrigation water to low-lying rice paddies abutting the Andaman Sea. Creating dams on the Salween would involve flooding hundreds of villages and towns and the reduced flow on the lower Salween would cause seawater to infiltrate inland, making the lower Salween valley unsuitable for growing crops. Because of poor logging practices in the upstream watershed, the historically silty Salween has become many times as turbid as its natural state. A reservoir on the Salween would fill much faster than projected, reducing the overall lifespan of dam projects. One of the largest problems is also that the dams would not have much positive impact on the people that <b>actually</b> <b>live</b> in the Salween region. There have been many public outcries to damming the Salween, ranging from petitioning to large-scale protests. There is also controversy over the representation of local opinion in the media. Investigative journalist Liu Jianqiang found little support for the dam projects among locals in China, who feared they would not get adequate compensation.|$|E

In addition to the original building, there is also an [...] annex built in 1993, an ancillary structure housing office security services and a bomb shelter predating the 1990s.

500|$|Almost {{immediately}} after {{the establishment of the}} new system, conflict arose. The American Revolutionary War drove potential settlers away from Prince Edward Island. This caused two problems - firstly, it made it difficult for proprietors to fulfill an obligation attached to their grants, to settle one person per [...] within ten years of the system's commencement, and secondly, it meant that the proprietors were not being paid much rent, as there were not many tenants to pay it. This meant that the proprietors were unable, or at least not willing, to pay the required quitrent to the Crown. Conflict also arose between the tenants and the proprietors. As the lottery for Prince Edward Island land was held in London, and most of the proprietors were important figures from the United Kingdom, most of the proprietors did not <b>actually</b> <b>live</b> in British North America. This meant that many neglected their obligations to the settlers.|$|E
500|$|The idea of {{the double}} burden is more evolved with the times {{concerning}} both sexes and their newfound roles. The role of a provider and caregiver is sometimes expected of women, but as more women enter the workforce, an 'independent' ideology seems to take effect and forces some women to decide between a career and family. Some may choose strictly one or the other, others may choose to carry the burden of both lifestyles. Some [...] "modern men tend {{to believe in the}} principle of equal sharing of domestic labor, but fail to <b>actually</b> <b>live</b> up to that belief." [...] The constant tug of war regarding one's time and where it could, should but will be spent creates a new speed bump that is a little bit higher than the previous ones. Modern times illuminate the dilemma that many dual-income couples face when trying to reconcile unpaid domestic work and paid employment. The burden of encompassing both ideologies plays a toll on both sexes in today's societies.|$|E

500|$|Although {{popularly known}} as Chincoteague ponies, the feral ponies <b>actually</b> <b>live</b> on Assateague Island. [...] Although the entire Island {{is owned by the}} federal government, Assateague is split by a fence at the Maryland/Virginia state line, with a herd of around 150 ponies living {{on each side of the}} fence. The herds live on land managed by two {{different}} federal agencies with very different management strategies. Ponies from the Maryland herd, referred to in literature of the National Park Service as Assateague horses, live within Assateague Island National Seashore. They are generally treated as wild animals, given no more or less assistance than other species on the island, other than to be treated with contraceptives to prevent overpopulation. [...] Conversely, the Virginia herd, referred to as Chincoteague ponies, lives within the Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge but is owned by the Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Company. The Virginia ponies are treated to twice yearly veterinary inspections, which prepare them for life among the general equine population if they are sold at auction. While only around 300 ponies live on Assateague Island, around 1,000 more live off-island, having been purchased or bred by private breeders.|$|E

In December 1929, Walter Chrysler hired the {{photographer}} Margaret Bourke-White {{to take pictures}} of the building for publicity purposes.

According to one account, Bourke-White wanted to live in the building {{for the duration of the}} photo shoot, but the only person who could <b>actually</b> <b>live</b> in the building was the janitor, so she was relegated to co-leasing a studio instead with Time Inc. In 1930, several of her photographs were used in a special report on skyscrapers in the then-new Fortune magazine. In 1934, Bourke-White's partner Oscar Graubner took a famous photo called [...] "Margaret Bourke-White atop the Chrysler Building", which depicts her taking a photo of the city's skyline while sitting on the 61st-floor eagle ornaments. On October 5, 1998, Christie's auctioned the photograph for $96,000. In addition, during a January 1931 dance organized by the Society of Beaux-Arts, six architects, including Van Alen, were photographed while wearing costumes resembling the buildings that each architect designed.|$|E
