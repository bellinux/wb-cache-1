When Ronald Reagan signed the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the AMT was expanded to target middle class deductions related to having children, owning <b>a</b> <b>home,</b> <b>or</b> living in high tax states. In 2006, the IRS's National Taxpayer Advocate's report highlighted the AMT as the single most serious problem with the tax code. The advocate noted that {{the complexity of the}} AMT leads to most taxpayers who owe AMT not realizing it until preparing their returns or being notified by the IRS.|$|E

Since its passage, several legal challenges have been brought against the act, and federal courts have ruled {{that a number of}} provisions are unconstitutional.|$|E
25|$|While in {{conversion}} {{to the new}} airframe, the unit continued its mission of aerial weather reconnaissance and added a new weather-related mission type in 2003, using the WC-130Js to drop buoys ahead of impending tropical storms.

The landfall of Hurricane Katrina on 29 August 2005 caused devastating damage to Keesler. An estimated one-third {{of the members of the}} parent 403d Wing lost <b>a</b> <b>home</b> <b>or</b> had it extensively damaged.

25|$|In Hinduism, deities {{and their}} icons may be hosted in a Hindu temple, within <b>a</b> <b>home</b> <b>or</b> as an amulet.

This practice in front of a murti may be elaborate in large temples, or be a simple song or mantra muttered in home, or offering made to sunrise or river or symbolic anicon of a deity. Archaeological evidence of deity worship in Hindu temples trace Puja rituals to Gupta Empire era (~4th century CE). In Hindu temples, various pujas may be performed daily at various times of the day; in other temples, it may be occasional.|$|E

25|$|Rhodri Meilir (2005–09) portrays Alfie Butts. Alfie is {{a friend}} of Nick's who turned up at the Harper {{household}} at Christmas 2005. Alfie comes from a small community in Wales which, based on his stories, has some rather backwards traditions. Also, there weren't many girls where he came from, so he savors spending time at the Harpers' and meeting Michael's friends. Most of the family have turned to him at various times for advice. He's a struggling musician who is very laid-back about life despite not having <b>a</b> <b>home</b> <b>or</b> a steady income. He did not appear in the 2009 Christmas special and was completely absent from the whole of series 10 and 11, with no explanation.|$|E

500|$|Inari is {{a popular}} deity with shrines and temples located {{throughout}} most of Japan. [...] According to a 1985 survey by the National Association of Shinto Shrines, 32,000 shrines—more than one-third of Shinto shrines in Japan—are dedicated to Inari. [...] This number includes only Shinto shrines with full-time resident priests; if small roadside or field shrines, shrines kept in <b>a</b> <b>home</b> <b>or</b> corporate office, smaller shrines without full-time resident priests, and Buddhist temples were included, the number would increase by at least an order of magnitude.|$|E

500|$|The {{engagement}} was {{not without}} controversy; Philip had no financial standing, was foreign-born (though a British subject who {{had served in the}} Royal Navy throughout the Second World War), and had sisters who had married German noblemen with Nazi links. Marion Crawford wrote, [...] "Some of the King's advisors did not think him good enough for her. He was a prince without <b>a</b> <b>home</b> <b>or</b> kingdom. Some of the papers played long and loud tunes on the string of Philip's foreign origin." [...] Later biographies reported that Elizabeth's mother initially opposed the union, dubbing Philip [...] "The Hun". In later life, however, the Queen Mother told biographer Tim Heald that Philip was [...] "an English gentleman".|$|E
