5|$|Jevons {{warned that}} fuel {{efficiency}} gains tend to increase fuel use. But {{this does not}} imply that improved fuel efficiency is worthless: higher fuel efficiency enables greater production and a higher material quality of life. For example, a more efficient steam engine allowed the cheaper transport of goods <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> contributed to the Industrial Revolution. However, if the Khazzoom–Brookes postulate is correct, increased fuel efficiency, by itself, will not reduce the rate of depletion of fossil fuels.|$|E
5|$|The pied butcherbird {{is thought}} to be monogamous, though its {{breeding}} habits have not been much studied. There is evidence of cooperative breeding, with some mated pairs being assisted by up to several other helper birds. These individuals help feed young and defend the nest. These pairs or small groups defend their territory from intruders, mobbing and chasing raptors and other birds, and occasionally dogs or people. They may attack animals (<b>and</b> <b>people)</b> <b>that</b> venture too close to the nest, with one bird coming front-on while the other may approach from behind.|$|E
5|$|Bar Hemingway was the {{favourite}} bar of Ernest Hemingway and is said {{by some to}} be {{the birthplace}} of the Bloody Mary cocktail which was invented for him. However, the claim is disputed as Fernand Petiot claimed to have invented the drink in 1921 while working at Harry's New York Bar, a frequent Paris hangout for Hemingway and other American expatriates, rather than in the bar in the Ritz itself. The bar has been restored to its original appearance, with rich wood panelling and leather upholstery and has 25 original photographs on the walls taken by the author of places <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> inspired him.|$|E

25|$|A study {{dedicated}} to investigating the thin ideal internalization {{as a factor}} of bulimia nervosa is Thompson's and Stice's research. The aim of their {{study was to investigate}} how and to what degree does media affect the thin ideal internalization. Thompson and Stice used randomized experiments (more specifically programs) {{dedicated to}} teaching young women how to be more critical when it comes to media, in order to reduce thin ideal internalization. The results showed that by creating more awareness of the media's control of the societal ideal of attractiveness, the thin ideal internalization significantly dropped. In other words, less thin ideal images portrayed by the media resulted in less thin ideal internalization. Therefore, Thompson and Stice concluded that media affected greatly the thin ideal internalization. Papies showed {{that it is not the}} thin ideal itself, but rather the self-association with other persons of a certain weight that decide how someone with bulimia nervosa feels. People that associate themselves with thin models get in a positive attitude when they see thin models <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> associate with overweight get in a negative attitude when they see thin models. Moreover, it can be taught to associate with thinner people.|$|E

Brown also adds, [...] "No date suits this publication so well as 1209, and nothing but the urgent desire of Court <b>and</b> <b>people</b> <b>that</b> the marriage should prove fruitful can explain, one might add excuse, some passages of almost fescennine license which it contains."

They were probably composed and transmitted orally and only began to be written down and printed, often as broadsides and as part of chapbooks, later being recorded and noted in books by collectors including Robert Burns and Walter Scott. From the seventeenth century they were used as a literary form by aristocratic authors including Robert Sempill (c. 1595-c. 1665), Lady Elizabeth Wardlaw (1627–1727) and Lady Grizel Baillie (1645–1746).|$|E
