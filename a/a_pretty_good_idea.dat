Pandering to the 'Cool, let's see that again' crowd has made Lionsgate rich but done nothing for this unendurable endurance contest of this long-enduring film franchise". [...] Mike Hale of The New York Times called the film the most [...] "straightforward" [...] of the series and the [...] "most consistently (though not inventively) violent". He ended his review saying, [...] "If you see the film in a theater equipped with RealD 3D and Dolby sound, you'll come away with <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> of what it would feel like to have flying body parts hit you in the face".|$|E

500|$|After {{an almost}} four-month delay, Oblivion went gold on March 2, 2006 and was {{released}} for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 on March 21, 2006. Early rumors notwithstanding, Oblivion shipped on a single DVD-DL disc. One journalist voiced concern for the game's release date, as it was set in the same week as that of EA's [...] Hines dismissed the suggestion, saying, [...] "We {{tend to focus on}} what we can control and not worry about what we can't control. Given the level of interest and the number of pre-orders and so forth, we had <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> we'd be just fine no matter what else was happening that week." [...] Oblivion was the first RPG title to be released for Microsoft's Xbox 360 console. In addition to the standard release version, a Collector's Edition was released for both Windows and Xbox 360 which includes the 112-page Pocket Guide to the Empire, a bonus DVD containing concept art, renders, and an approximately 45-minute-long documentary on the making of Oblivion, and a coin replica of the in-game currency of Tamriel. Its suggested release price of US$69.99 brought back [...] "memories of game prices circa the Nintendo 64" [...] for one Kotaku commentator. Some suggested that the included coin be used to create a [...] "garish piece of jewelry".|$|E
500|$|The {{graphics}} of {{the game}} were positively received. Manny LaMancha of GamePro said that the visuals were brightly colored and smoothly animated and noted that the Xbox version's graphics were slightly cleaner than the PlayStation 2 version. Michael Lafferty of GameZone praised the environments as [...] "lush and richly textured" [...] and the cutscenes as [...] "very well done". Tony Guidi of TeamXbox commended the graphics as [...] "clean and crisp" [...] and added that the cutscenes were [...] "beautifully polished". Ryan Davis of GameSpot noted that [...] "Crash Nitro Kart maintains the brightly colored, cartoony look {{that has been the}} hallmark of past Crash Bandicoot games, though with slightly upgraded graphics. Ed Lewis of IGN said that the graphics for the single-player modes were [...] "bright and cheery and smooth", but decreased in quality in the multiplayer modes. Kristan Reed of Eurogamer concluded that [...] "CNK stays in exactly the cutesy ballpark you'd expect from the Day-Glo series, neither straying in any way from the generic cartoon worlds of old nor providing any graphical trickery that surprises hardened gamers looking for a splash of eye candy with their cartoon frippery." [...] Steven Rodriquez of Nintendo World Report noted that [...] "if you've played any of the other Crash Bandicoot games out there, then you have <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> what this one looks like." [...] Russ Fischer of GameSpy said that the game [...] "some nice graphics, which use a solid framerate and loads of color to capture the old Crash magic." ...|$|E

However the character from Fantasia which Tytla {{is better known}} for is Chernabog, {{his own version of}} Crnobog the Black God, from the [...] "Night on Bald Mountain" [...] sequence. It is often said that Chernabog was based on actor Bela Lugosi, and Walt did bring him in to do live action reference for the character. However, Bill already had <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> of {{what he wanted to do}} and did not like Bela's interpretation of the character. Instead he had Wilfred Jackson (who is credited for the music of Steamboat Willie) act out the part for him, and that is what he used as live action reference.|$|E

2500|$|Zombie was {{responsible}} for writing all of the album's songs, while he initially worked with Nine Inch Nails member Charlie Clouser to produce the album. Zombie and Clouser opted for a more [...] "electronic" [...] sound for the record, using various music software while working on the project. Clouser claimed [...] "It was me and him with a computer, {{trying to figure out}} a direction we wanted to go in. We had <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> <b>idea</b> of the kind of elements that would be included and an overall concept of the segues between songs and the musical interludes. We even started coming up with the core riffs for the album." [...] Early into the process of recording the album, Clouser became unable to work on the album due to other obligations; however, he recommended that Zombie worked with Scott Humphrey {{for the remainder of the}} album. Humphrey had previously worked with artists such as Metallica prior to producing the album. Due to his departure, the only song on the album produced by Clouser is [...] "Superbeast". Zombie stated that making the album was [...] "weird", and he didn't believe it would do well, as [...] "most debut solo records don't." ...|$|E
