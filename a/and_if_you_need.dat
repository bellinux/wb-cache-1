500|$|Metalholic said 'I’m back…” [...] I can’t {{think of}} a more {{appropriate}} way to flow into the second track “Tragic Magic.” [...] Ronnie Radke is most definitely back {{and he is not}} afraid to tell you so.' This fairly slow tempo song obviously takes a few jabs at Radke’s former band Escape the Fate, but overall is a solid melodic song, [...] The third track “The Drug in Me is You” was the second single and the band’s first video and might I add a very entertaining video. “The Drug in Me is You,” is a nicely constructed musical performance that is just flat out catchy. [...] To me the song is about something most people can relate to, the battle you have with yourself, with your morality, with your demons. [...] We all know that we can be our own worst enemy and the only person that you truly have to blame in many instances is yourself. [...] “Trying to consume, the drug in me is you and I’m so high on misery can’t you see,” evokes the feeling that you are your own drug, the creator of your misery <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> to point fingers at someone try looking in the mirror first. [...] “If we are born to die and we all die to live, then what’s the point of living life if life just contradicts?” [...] Questions we all ask when we pick ourselves up off the floor and do the only thing we can do, try again. [...] Life is what you make of it, if you have lost yourself, it is up to you to find your way again. [...] I got all profound there for a second, it happens.|$|E
2500|$|Upon its Western release, Xenoblade Chronicles X {{earned an}} {{aggregated}} review score of 84/100 at Metacritic, indicating [...] "generally favorable" [...] reception. Nintendo Life praised the game's battle system, deep upgrade pathways, vast world size, and graphics, but criticized the occasional difficulty spike and fetch quest. IGN scored it 8.2/10, stating that, [...] "Out in the wilderness, Xenoblade Chronicles X presents seemingly endless reasons {{to fight and}} wander the planet.", and that [...] "Xenoblade Chronicles X is a massive RPG with enough surface area, sub quests, and customization to keep you busy". However, the game was criticized by IGN with a narrative that [...] "makes important moments feel bland, with low production value that robs emotional scenes of any dramatic weight". Nintendo World Report scored it 9.5/10, stating that it is [...] "required playing for anyone with the slightest inclination toward RPGs, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> to buy the system then do it" [...] as it is [...] "an {{essential part of the}} Wii U library." ...|$|E

Since last March, you know, I am carrying a mighty load, solitary and alone--General Grant's book--and must carry it till the first volume is 30 days old (Jan. 1st) before the relief money will begin to flow in. From now till the first of January every dollar is as valuable to me {{as it could be}} to a famishing tramp. If you can wait till then--I mean without discomfort, without inconvenience--it will be a large accommodation to me; but I will not allow you to do this favor if it will discommode you.

5000|$|In court, Buscetta also {{elaborated}} {{in great}} detail the hidden exchanges that linked politicians and the Mafia. He stated: It is not Cosa Nostra that contacts the politician; instead {{a member of the}} Cosa Nostra says, that president is mine (è cosa mia), <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> a favor, you must go through me. In other words, the Cosa Nostra figure maintains a sort of monopoly on that politician. Every family head in the Mafia selects a man whose characteristics already make him look approachable.

On the contrary, one goes to that candidate and says, [...] "Onorevole, I can do this and that for you now, and we hope that when you are elected you will remember us."

So he gave me, I think, 5,000 marks and then, it wasn't enough, because I needed more, and about three or four weeks later I said to him, 'You gotta help me one more time, and I'll give it back to you when I have a chance.'

I found myself paying a little more than $20 a month for Fi, which is the least I've paid for a cell phone service, ever." [...] Lee further liked the service's transition between Wi-Fi and cellular data, writing [...] "For the most part, I didn't encounter much service disruption when doing so". Although criticizing the limited number of phones supported ("The hiccup here, of course, is that Fi is only compatible with a few phones"), she wrote that [...] "I'd switch in a heartbeat. ...

JR Raphael of Computerworld also praised the pricing strategy and network transitions, describing it as [...] "silently and seamlessly switches as needed to give you the strongest possible connection wherever you are".
