During {{the spring and summer}} of 2013, GE learned of four 747-8F freighters that suffered icing in their engines at altitudes of 40,000 feet and above. The most serious incident involved an AirBridge Cargo freighter. On July 31, while at an altitude of 41,000 feet over China, the flight crew noted two engines surging while a third lost substantial power. The pilots were able to land the plane safely, but the engines were found to have sustained damage. Among the possible factors GE cited in an interview with the Wall Street Journal was [...] "'unique convective weather systems' such as unusually large thunderstorms reaching high altitudes." [...] Boeing told the newspaper that it is working with GE on software solutions to the problem.|$|E

40|$|The DNA {{molecules}} {{packaged in}} structures called chromosomes within {{the cells of}} living organisms encode hereditary information that is passed on to their offspring. Using transcription and translation, the genes within these DNA molecules help in protein synthesis. Thus chromosomal DNA serves as a blueprint for the chemical processes of life. In order to analyze a DNA sequence by currently available technology, we have to cut it into small fragments, e. g. by using restriction enzymes. The application of different restriction enzymes to the multiple copies of the same DNA sequence generates many overlapping fragments. In order to construct the original DNA, these fragments need to be sequenced and assembled. This problem of finding the original order of the fragments is called the genome map <b>assembly</b> <b>problem.</b> This research proposes a constraint automaton solution to solve the genome map <b>assembly</b> <b>problem</b> for both error prone and error free data.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a genetic {{algorithm}} (GA) for solving the DNA fragment <b>assembly</b> <b>problem</b> in a computational grid. The algorithm, which is named GrEA, is a steady-state GA which uses a panmitic population, and it is based on computing parallel function evaluations in an asynchronous way. We have implemented GrEA on top of the Condor system, and we have used it to solve the DNA <b>assembly</b> <b>problem.</b> This is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem which is growing in importance and complexity as more research centers become involved on sequencing new genomes. While previous works on this problem have usually faced 30 K base pairs (bps) long instances, we have tackled here a 77 K bps long one to show how a grid system can move research forward. After analyzing the basic grid algorithm, we have studied the use of an improvement method to still enhance its scalability. Then, by using a grid composed of up to 150 computers, we have achieved time reductions from tens of days down to a few hours, and we have obtained near optimal solutions when solving the 77 K bps long instance (773 fragments). We conclude that our proposal is a promising approach {{to take advantage of a}} grid system to solve large DNA fragment <b>assembly</b> <b>problem</b> instances and also to learn more about grid metaheuristics as a new class of algorithms for really challenging problems...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} addresses two intensive computational {{problems of}} designing VLSI architectures for robotic computations and of implementing the <b>assembly</b> scheduling <b>problem</b> on a highly parallel artificial neural network. In designing VLSI architectures for a complex computational robotic task, the functional decomposition {{of the task}} into a set of computational modules can be represented as an acyclic data flow graph (ADFG) which can be mapped into the VLSI architecture by an existing systolization procedure. An efficient graph decomposition technique has been developed which utilizes the critical path concept to decompose a large-scale directed ADFG into a set of connected subgraphs, and the integer linear optimization technique {{can be used to}} solve the buffer assignment problem in each subgraph in pseudo-polynomial time. ^ The other equally important computational problem is the NP -complete <b>assembly</b> scheduling <b>problem</b> which is difficult to be solved by traditional machines.

40|$|We {{formulate}} a finite-horizon nonstationary dynamic single-asset <b>assembly</b> <b>problem,</b> which covers both a liquid-asset <b>assembly</b> <b>problem,</b> {{based on the}} work of Rosling published in 1989, where the single asset is the single product being assembled, and a fixed-asset <b>assembly</b> <b>problem,</b> in which the single asset is production capacity. In the latter case, capacity is assembled over time from components and may be used to manufacture many products. In the spirit of Rosling, we provide conditions under which it can be solved by an equivalent analogous serial model in the form developed by Clark and Scarf in 1960, with a separate state variable for the level of assets in each stage of completion, dramatically simplifying the problem and its solution. In the liquid-asset case, we extend Rosling 2 ̆ 7 s 1989 work by including nonstationary demands, costs, and revenues in a finite-horizon setting. In the fixed-asset (capacity) expansion case, we show that capacity should be assembled in a balanced way and derive the optimal timing and extent of delays (in previously initiated capacity expansions). Our basic capacity expansion model is deterministic, so under our conditions, it is optimal never to delay a schedule and the state space reduces to a single dimension. However, in the Markov-modulated case, in which cost parameters and customer demand distributions can be influenced by a randomly and exogenously evolving state (of the economy), we illustrate that delays can be optimal.
