50|$|The first {{motherboard}} {{that was}} produced under this specification is called EPIA-P710. It {{was released in}} December 2008. It is 10 xx 7.2 cm and 12 layers deep. The operating temperature range is from 0°C to about 50°C. The operating humidity level (relative and non-condensing) can be from 0% to about 95%. It uses a 1 GHz VIA C7-M processor, a VIA VX800 chip set, and is RoHS compliant. It has onboard VGA video-out.

5000|$|Following the {{dissolution}} of an Organization Task Force after an unsuccessful attempt to unite the national agencies in a single structure and vision, CBAmerica was reorganized as “a covenantal fellowship of Regional Associations of Conservative Baptist churches, which have joined together {{to make the most}} of the God-given strengths of each member Region for a common purpose.” [...] In 2005 new bylaws were adopted whereby regional associations of local churches are the only members of CBAmerica; the local churches themselves are members of the regional associations and no longer have any direct participation in the national organization. The regional directors and their boards, as representatives of their member churches, are organizationally and relationally bound through the Covenant of the Regions. [...] The regional directors comprise the CBAmerica Board, representing the interests of the regions and the member churches of the regions. CBAmerica is led by a leadership team consisting of a Catalyst (Board Chairman), a Facilitator and <b>a</b> <b>Connector</b> (<b>Board</b> Secretary/Treasurer). As of 2014, the staff of CBAmerica listed on its website were limited to a part-time National Network Facilitator and a Director of Chaplaincy.|$|E
40|$|The lack of {{open access}} to the pre-beamformed data of an {{ultrasound}} scanner has limited the research of novel imaging methods to a few privileged laboratories. To address this need, we have developed a pre-beamformed data acquisition (DAQ) system that can collect data over 128 array elements in parallel from the Ultrasonix series of research-purpose ultrasound scanners. Our DAQ system comprises three system-level blocks: 1) <b>a</b> <b>connector</b> <b>board</b> that interfaces with the array probe and the scanner through a probe connector port; 2) a main board that triggers DAQ and controls data transfer to a computer; and 3) four receiver boards that are each responsible for acquiring 32 channels of digitized raw data and storing them to the on-board memory. This system can acquire pre-beamformed data with 12 -bit resolution when using a 40 -MHz sampling rate. It houses a 16 GB RAM buffer that is sufficient to store 128 channels of pre-beamformed data for 8000 to 25 000 transmit firings, depending on imaging depth; corresponding to nearly a 2 -s period in typical imaging setups. Following the acquisition, the data can be transferred through a USB 2. 0 link to a computer for offline processing and analysis. To evaluate the feasibility of using the DAQ system for advanced imaging research, two proof-of-concept investigations have been conducted on beamforming and plane-wave B-flow imaging. Results show that adaptive beamforming algorithms such as the minimum variance approach can generate sharper images of a wire cross-section whose diameter {{is equal to the}} imaging wavelength (150 μm in our example). Also, planewave B-flow imaging can provide more consistent visualization of blood speckle movement given the higher temporal resolution of this imaging approach (2500 fps in our example). © 2012 IEEE. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
50|$|Both {{versions}} use the Actel FPGA, a {{flash memory}} (size depends on version) and <b>a</b> cable <b>connector</b> for the cables which are to be soldered onto the Gamecube mainboard.

50|$|Perhaps {{the biggest}} {{addition}} to G450 was that Matrox moved the previously external second RAMDAC, {{for the second}} monitor connector (DualHead), into the G450 chip itself. RAMDAC speeds were still different though, with the primary running at an excellent 360 MHz, but the secondary running at only 230 MHz. This meant that the primary monitor could run much higher resolutions and refresh rates than the secondary. This {{was the same as}} G400. The G450 also had native support for TMDS signaling, and thus DVI, but this was not <b>a</b> standard issue <b>connector.</b> <b>Boards</b> shipped with dual analog VGA connectors.|$|R
40|$|Access to the pre-beamform data of each array {{channel on}} an {{ultrasound}} scanner {{is important to}} experimental investigations on advanced imaging research topics like adaptive beamforming and synthetic aperture imaging. Through such data access, we can obtain in-vitro or in-vivo insights on various imaging methods without resorting to hardware implementation. This paper reports {{the development of a}} pre-beamform data acquisition (DAQ) system that can collect data from 128 array elements in parallel. Our DAQ system is intended to interface with a Sonix-RP research scanner through a probe connector port. It comprises three major blocks: 1) <b>a</b> <b>connector</b> <b>board</b> that interfaces with the array probe and the scanner; 2) a main board that triggers data acquisition and controls data transfer to a computer; 3) four receiver boards that are each responsible for acquiring 32 channels of digitized raw data and storing them to the on-board DDR 2 memory. The probe-connecting end of this system is interfaced with TX 810 chips to facilitate switching between transmit and receive modes. When receiving data, the incoming analog signal is first passed into a low-noise amplifier. These signals are then sent into AD 9272 chips on the four receiver boards to perform time gain compensation, anti-alias filtering, and 12 -bit data sampling at an 80 MHz rate. Subsequently, the digitized signal samples are de-serialized using a Virtex- 5 FPGA and are stored into DDR 2 memory. To facilitate data retrieval, we implemented a Virtex- 5 FPGA on the main board to initiate data transfer, and if preferred, to perform onboard beamforming (programmable by user) prior to sending data to a computer through a USB 2. 0 link. For our prototype, we used 16 GB of DDR 2 memory for data storage. With a frame rate of 35 Hz, a 10 cm depth-of-view and 128 transmit firings per frame, this DAQ system is capable of collecting pre-beamform data from all array channels for 2. 5 seconds. We are currently completing the prototype development in collaboration with Ultrasonix. © 2009 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
