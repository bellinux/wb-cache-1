25|$|Immigrant {{children}} <b>and</b> <b>youths,</b> {{mostly of}} lower-class background, are the fastest-growing {{segment of the}} German population.

In the big cities, 60% of children aged 5 years and younger have at least one parent born abroad. Immigrant children academically underperform their peers. Immigrants have tended to be less educated than native Germans. After controlling for parental education, ethnic group does not play a role in children's academic outcomes.|$|E
25|$|In Hellenic Greece, the pederastic {{relationships}} between Greek men (erastes) <b>and</b> <b>youths</b> (eromenos) {{were similar to}} marriage in that {{the age of the}} youth was similar to the age at which women married (the mid-teens, though in some city states, as young as age seven), and the relationship could only be undertaken with the consent of the father. This consent, just {{as in the case of}} a daughter's marriage, was contingent on the suitor's social standing. The relationship consisted of very specific social and religious responsibilities and also had a sexual component. Unlike marriage, however, a pederastic relation was temporary and ended when the boy turned seventeen.|$|E
25|$|A 2007 Motivaction {{research}} {{commissioned by}} HP/De Tijd found that 60.2% preferred the current constitutional monarchy, 13.7% wanted a purely ceremonial monarch without political tasks, 16.2% favoured a republic.

25|$|There was a Home Guard {{during the}} First World War (the Volunteer Training Corps) {{although}} {{this was not}} on the same scale as its Second World War successor. The origins of the Second World War Home Guard can be traced to Captain Tom Wintringham, who returned from the Spanish Civil War and wrote a book entitled How to Reform the Army. In the book, as well as a large number of regular army reforms, Wintringham called for the creation of 12 divisions similar in composition to that of the International Brigades which had been formed in Spain during the conflict; the divisions would be raised through a process of voluntary enlistment targeting ex-servicemen <b>and</b> <b>youths.</b> Despite great interest by the War Office in the book's assertion that 'security is possible', Wintringham's call to train 100,000 men immediately was not implemented.|$|E
25|$|Those mining {{communities}} {{had good}} working class values {{and a sense}} of family values. The men did real men's heavy work going down the pit.

Many of these communities were completely devastated, with people out of work turning to drugs and no real man's work because all the jobs had gone. There is no doubt that this led to a breakdown in these communities with families breaking up <b>and</b> <b>youths</b> going out of control. The scale of the closures went too far. The damage done to those communities was enormous as a result of the strike.|$|E
