40|$|Previous {{investigations}} of cerebral anatomy in persistent develop-mental stutterers have reported bilateral anomalies in the perisylvian region and atypical patterns of cerebral asymmetry. In this study, perisylvian sulcal patterns were analyzed to compare subjects with persistent developmental stuttering (PDS) <b>and</b> an <b>age-,</b> hand-, <b>and</b> <b>gender-matched</b> control group. This analysis was accomplished using software designed for 3 -dimensional sulcal identification and extraction. Patterns of cerebral asymmetry {{were also investigated}} with standard planimetric measurements. PDS subjects showed a small but significant increase in both the number of sulci connecting with the second segment of the right Sylvian fissure and {{in the number of}} suprasylvian gyral banks (of sulci) along this segment. No differences were seen in the left perisylvian region for either sulcal number or gyral bank number. Measurements of asymmetry revealed typical patterns of cerebral asymmetry in both groups with no significant differences in frontal and occipital width asymmetry, frontal and occipital pole asymmetry, or planum temporale and Sylvian fissure asymmetries. The subtle difference in cortical folding of the right perisylvian region observed in PDS subjects may correlate with functional imaging studies that have reported increased right-hemisphere activity during stuttered speech...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. To {{evaluate}} the diurnal intraocular pressure (IOP) in eyes after vitrectomy {{compared to that}} of healthy eyes. Methods. Twenty-one patients who had undergone vitrectomy and 21 <b>age-</b> <b>and</b> <b>gender-matched</b> normal controls were enrolled during the same period. We measured the diurnal IOP every two hours between 9 [*]a. m. and 11 [*]p. m. in all patients who were admitted for cataract surgery. Patients with a history of eye surgery (not including vitrectomy) or use of a medication that is associated with IOP were excluded. The IOP and ocular parameters of patients were compared with the same patients’ fellow healthy eyes and with normal eyes of <b>age-</b> <b>and</b> <b>gender-matched</b> controls. Results. There {{were no significant differences between}} vitrectomized eyes and normal fellow eyes with regard to all IOP parameters including the maximum, minimum, and IOP fluctuation values.

40|$|Although the {{epidemic}} of obesity {{has been accompanied by}} an increase in the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome, not all obese individu-als develop the syndrome and even lean indi-viduals can be insulin-resistant. Both lean and obese insulin-resistant individu-als have an excess of fat in the liver that is not due to alcohol or other known causes of liver disease, a condition defined by gastroenterolo-gists as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The fatty liver is insulin-resistant. Liver fat is highly significantly and linearly corre-lated with all components of the metabolic syn-drome independently of obesity. Type 2 diabetic patients have significantly more liver fat than <b>age-,</b> weight- <b>and</b> <b>gender-matched</b> non-diabetic subjects. Overproduction of glucose, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, C-reactive pro-tein and coagulation factors by the fatty liver could contribute to the excess risk of cardiovas-cular disease associated with the metabolic syn-drome and NAFLD.

40|$|Background: Population {{of online}} {{consumers}} increases rapidly, but the decision-making styles of online consumers and psychiatric denominators {{such as the}} personality correlates remain unclear. Subjects and methods: In 196 traditional, <b>and</b> 196 <b>age-,</b> education- <b>and</b> <b>gender-matched</b> online consumers, we have tested the Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire (ZKPQ) and the Consumer Style Inventory (CSI). Results: After exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, we have defined a five-factor model CSI with 24 items. Online consumers scored lower on ZKPQ Neuroticism-Anxiety and higher on Aggression-Hostility than traditional ones did, and scored higher on CSI Novelty-fashion consciousness and Brand consciousness, and lower on Time consciousness than the traditional consumers did.

40|$|AbstractEmotion biases feature {{prominently}} in cognitive theories {{of depression and}} are a focus of psychological interventions. However, there is presently no stable neurocognitive marker of altered emotion–cognition interactions in depression. One reason may be the heterogeneity of major depressive disorder. Our aim {{in the present study}} was to find an emotional bias that differentiates patients with melancholic depression from controls, and patients with melancholic from those with non-melancholic depression. We used a working memory paradigm for emotional faces, where two faces with angry, happy, neutral, sad or fearful expression had to be retained over one second. Twenty patients with melancholic depression, 20 <b>age-,</b> education- <b>and</b> <b>gender-matched</b> control participants <b>and</b> 20 patients with non-melancholic depression participated in the study. We analysed performance on the working memory task using signal detection measures. We found an interaction between group and emotion on working memory performance that was driven by the higher performance for sad faces compared to other categories in the melancholic group. We computed a measure of “sad benefit”, which distinguished melancholic and non-melancholic patients with good sensitivity and specificity. However, replication studies and formal discriminant analysis will be needed in order to assess whether emotion bias in working memory may become a useful diagnostic tool to distinguish these two syndromes...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Different {{studies have}} {{reported}} an association between HIV infection, antiretroviral therapies, and impaired bone metabolism, but data on their impact on fracture risk are scarce. We studied the association between a clinical diagnosis of HIV infection and fracture risk. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study {{using data from the}} Danish National Health Service registries, including 124, 655 fracture cases and 373, 962 <b>age-</b> <b>and</b> <b>gender-matched</b> controls. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 50 (0. 40 / 1000) patients in the fracture group and 52 (0. 14 / 1000) controls had an HIV diagnosis. The risk of any fracture was thus significantly increased among HIV-infected patients (<b>age-</b> <b>and</b> <b>gender-matched</b> OR = 2. 89, 95 % CI: 1. 99 to 4. 18). Similarly, significant increases in the risk of hip (OR = 8. 99, 95 % CI: 1. 39 to 58. 0), forearm (OR = 3. 50, 95 % CI: 1. 26 to 9. 72), and spine fractures (OR = 9. 00, 95 % CI: 1. 39 to 58. 1) were observed. CONCLUSIONS: HIV infection is associated with an almost 3 -fold increase in fracture risk compared with that of <b>age-</b> <b>and</b> <b>gender-matched</b> uninfected patients.

40|$|To {{determine}} if infection with {{herpes simplex virus}} (HSV) type 2 is associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 infection among patients attending sexually transmitted diseases clinics, a case-control study was done on coded sera from 179 HIV-I-infected patients <b>and</b> 367 <b>age-,</b> race-, <b>and</b> <b>gender-matched</b> HIV-I-seronegative patients. Although only 13 (2. 3 %) of 546 patients {{had a history of}} genital herpes treatment, 72 % and 56. 6 %, respectively, had serologic evidence of prior infection with HSV-I and- 2. HSV-I antibody prevalence was similar among both patient groups; however, HSV- 2 antibodies were more common among those in-fected with HIV-l. Among heterosexual men, 62. 7 % of those infected with HIV-l had HSV- 2 antibodies compared with 46. 7 % of those not infected (P <. 01). The HSV- 2 seroprevalence among women with or without HIV infection was 78. 1 % and 57. 7 %, respectively (P <. 02). A history of intravenous drug use and a reactive serologic test for syphilis were each independently associated with HIV- 1 infection in heterosexuals. These data suggest that the two most common causes of genital ulcerative disease in the United States, genital herpes and syphilis, may contrib-ute to increased risk for HIV- 1 infection among heterosexuals.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to verify {{possible}} cognitive dysfunction in patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) and its relationship to factors related to epilepsy and schooling. Fifty subjects diagnosed with JME and 50 controls underwent neuropsychological assessment evaluating intellectual functions, attention, memory, executive functions, and language. the patients were further divided into two subgroups on the basis of educational level: 11 years of formal education. Participants diagnosed with JME scored significantly below <b>age-,</b> education-, <b>and</b> <b>gender-matched</b> controls on neuropsychological measures of attention, immediate verbal memory, mental flexibility, control of inhibition, working memory, processing speed, verbal delayed memory, visual delayed memory, naming, and verbal fluency. A positive correlation was observed between duration of epilepsy and cognitive decline. However, in the group of patients with > 11 years of education, this correlation was not significant. in this series of patients with JME, neuropsychological evaluation suggests widespread cognitive dysfunction outside the limits of the frontal lobes. the duration of epilepsy correlated with cognitive decline, and patients with higher education manifested less progression of deficits.

40|$|Online gaming addiction, as {{the most}} popular subtype of Internet addiction, had gained more and more {{attention}} from the whole world. However, the structural differences in cortical thickness of the brain between adolescents with online gaming addiction and healthy controls are not well unknown; neither was its association with the impaired cognitive control ability. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging scans from late adolescence with online gaming addiction (n = 18) <b>and</b> <b>age-,</b> education- <b>and</b> <b>gender-matched</b> controls (n = 18) were acquired. The cortical thickness measurement method was employed to investigate alterations of cortical thickness in individuals with online gaming addiction.

In healthy individuals, the capacity of visual working memory is enhanced when the material to be retained is emotionally salient, particularly for angry faces. We investigated whether patients with schizophrenia also have an enhanced WM capacity for angry faces. We compared 34 inpatients with schizophrenia <b>and</b> 34 <b>age-,</b> handedness- <b>and</b> <b>gender-matched</b> control participants in three separate tasks. In the WM task, participants saw two faces with angry, happy or neutral emotional expressions for 2 s and had to decide whether a probe face presented after a 1 s delay was identical to one of them. In the emotion classification task, they had to assign these faces to the appropriate categorical emotion. They also rated faces for valence and arousal. Although patients performed generally worse on the working memory task, they showed the same benefit for angry faces as control participants. However, patients were specifically impaired for angry faces on the emotion classification task. These results indicate preserved implicit emotion processing in schizophrenia patients, which contrasts with their impairment in explicit emotion classification. With regard to clinical practice, our findings underline the importance of assessing responsiveness to emotions in patients with schizophrenia, with a view possibly to utilize preserved implicit emotion processing in cognitive remediation programs...|$|R
40|$|Individuals with high-functioning autism {{sometimes}} exhibit intact or superior {{performance on}} visuospatial tasks, {{in contrast to}} impaired functioning in other domains such as language comprehension, executive tasks, and social functions. The goal {{of the current study}} was to investigate the neural bases of preserved visuospatial processing in high-functioning autism {{from the perspective of the}} cortical underconnectivity theory. We used a combination of behavioral, functional magnetic resonance imaging, functional connectivity, and corpus callosum morphometric methodological tools. Thirteen participants with high-functioning autism <b>and</b> 13 controls (<b>age-,</b> IQ-, <b>and</b> <b>gender-matched)</b> were scanned while performing an Embedded Figures Task. Despite the ability of the autism group to attain behavioral performance comparable to the control group, the brain imaging results revealed several group differences consistent with the cortical underconnectivity account of autism. First, relative to controls, the autism group showed less activation in the left dorsolateral prefrontal and inferior parietal areas and more activation in visuospatial (bilateral superior parietal extending to inferior parietal and right occipital) areas. Second, the autism group demonstrated lower functional connectivity between higher-order working memory/executive areas and visuospatial regions (between frontal and parietal-occipital). Third, the size of the corpus callosum (an index of anatomical connectivity) was positively correlated with frontal–posterior (parietal and occipital) functional connectivity in the autism group. Thus, even in the visuospatial domain, where preserved performance among people with autism is observed, the neuroimaging signatures of cortical underconnectivity persist...|$|R

Eighty-five percent of controls were dippers compared with 74 % of WCH (n. s.) and 64 % of patients with ambulatory hypertension (p < 0. 0001). The prevalence of 24 -h rhythms was similar among the groups, but prevalence of 12 -h BP rhythms was increased in hypertensive (67 %) and WCH (72 %) compared with controls (51 %, p < 0. 0001).

In this investigation, we sought to investigate functional brain connectivity during working memory in MTBI patients. A sample of 30 MTBI patients <b>and</b> 30 <b>age-,</b> education-, <b>and</b> <b>gender-matched</b> normal controls were studied. Working memory was assessed with the Sternberg's verbal and visuo-spatial working memory tasks. Electro-encephalography (EEG) was recorded from 128 channels while subjects performed working memory tasks and during eyes closed resting condition. EEG coherence was computed in theta; lower and upper alpha; and lower and upper beta frequency bands during the encoding, retention, and retrieval stages of working memory as well as during eyes-closed rest. We found that the MTBI patients had impaired verbal and visuo-spatial working memory. The different stages of working memory were associated with poor intrahemispheric coherence in long-range (fronto-parietal) and mid-range (fronto-temporal and temporo-parietal) regions as well as poor interhemispheric coherence in the frontal and temporal regions in the MTBI patients. The deficit in coherence was present in theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands. However, the MTBI and the control group had comparable coherence values in intra- and inter-hemispheric regions during eyes closed rest.

The data reported here illustrate that trial-by-trial variability can be reliably measured from EEG, and that intra-participant EEG variability is significantly greater in those with ASD than in neuro-typical matched controls. EEG recorded at the scalp is a linear mixture of activity arising from muscle artifacts and numerous concurrent brain processes. To minimise these additional sources of variability, EEG data were subjected to two different methods of spatial filtering. (i) The data were decomposed using infomax Independent Component Analysis (ICA), a method of blind source separation which un-mixes the EEG signal into components with maximally independent time-courses, and (ii) a surface Laplacian transform was performed (Current Source Density interpolation) {{in order to reduce}} the effects of volume conduction. Data are presented from thirteen high functioning adolescents with ASD without co-morbid ADHD, <b>and</b> twelve neuro-typical <b>age-</b> IQ- <b>and</b> <b>gender-matched</b> controls. Comparison of variability between the ASD and neuro-typical groups indicated that intra-participant variability of P 1 latency and P 1 amplitude was greater in the participants with ASD, and inter-trial α-band phase coherence was lower in the participants with ASD.

40|$|AbstractSubjects with {{schizophrenia}} are impaired at reinforcement-driven reversal {{learning from}} {{as early as}} their first episode. The neurobiological basis of this deficit is unknown. We obtained behavioral and fMRI data in 24 unmedicated, primarily first episode, schizophrenia patients <b>and</b> 24 <b>age-,</b> IQ- <b>and</b> <b>gender-matched</b> healthy controls during a reversal learning task. We supplemented our fMRI analysis, focusing on learning from prediction errors, with detailed computational modeling to probe task solving strategy including an ability to deploy an internal goal directed model of the task. Patients displayed reduced functional activation in the ventral striatum (VS) elicited by prediction errors. However, modeling task performance revealed that a subgroup did not adjust their behavior according to an accurate internal model of the task structure, and these were also the more severely psychotic patients. In patients who could adapt their behavior, {{as well as in}} controls, task solving was best described by cognitive strategies according to a Hidden Markov Model. When we compared patients and controls who acted according to this strategy, patients still displayed a significant reduction in VS activation elicited by informative errors that precede salient changes of behavior (reversals). Thus, our study shows that VS dysfunction in schizophrenia patients during reward-related reversal learning remains a core deficit even when controlling for task solving strategies. This result highlights VS dysfunction is tightly linked to a reward-related reversal learning deficit in early, unmedicated schizophrenia patients...|$|R
