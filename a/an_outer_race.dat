50|$|There {{is still}} a room for {{discussion}} whether the rolling element excites the natural frequencies of bearing component when it passes the fault on the <b>outer</b> <b>race.</b> Hence we need to identify the bearing <b>outer</b> <b>race</b> natural frequency and its harmonics. The bearing faults create impulses and results in strong harmonics of the fault frequencies in the spectrum of vibration signals. These fault frequencies are sometimes masked by adjacent frequencies in the spectra due to their little energy. Hence, a very high spectral resolution is often needed to identify these frequencies during a FFT analysis. The natural frequencies of a rolling element bearing with the free boundary conditions are 3 kHz. Therefore, {{in order to use}} the bearing component resonance bandwidth method to detect the bearing fault at an initial stage a high frequency range accelerometer should be adopted, and data obtained from a long duration needs to be acquired. A fault characteristic frequency can only be identified when the fault extent is severe, such as that of a presence of a hole in the <b>outer</b> <b>race.</b> The harmonics of fault frequency is a more sensitive indicator of <b>a</b> bearing <b>outer</b> <b>race</b> fault.

As a part of More Electric Aircraft (MAE) trend, some redundant hydraulic actuators are being partially replaced by Electromechanical Actuators (EMA).

A short description {{of the theory of}} adaptive filters is presented. When an adaptive filter uses the delayed version of the input signal as the reference signal, it is possible to divide the signal into a deterministic (gear and shaft related) part and a nondeterministic (noise and rolling bearings) part. The idea of the self-adaptive filter (in the literature referred to as SANC or ALE) is presented and its most important features are discussed. The flowchart of the Matlab-based SANC algorithm is also presented. In practice, bearing fault signals are in fact nondeterministic components, due to a little jitter in their fundamental period.

40|$|Frequency domain based signal {{processing}} {{methods have been}} shown to present a quite effective behaviour in the detection of defects, when applied to the analysis of vibration signals, resulting from rolling element bearings. However, these methods typically require some complex and sophisticated analysis, which renders their application cumbersome for applications requiring unskilled personnel or automated fault detection and trending. Parallel, a number of traditional methods exist, such as the root mean square (RMS), the crest factor (CF), the kurtosis (KU), the impulse factor (IF) and the shape factor (SF), requiring only direct processing in the time domain. Alternatively to these methods, a morphological index (MI) for processing vibration signals has been proposed, addressing the issues of how to quantify the shape {{and the size of the}} signals directly in the time domain.

However, the fast kurtogram, a band-pass filtering method, which extracts transient signals by optimal frequency band selection and leaves the noise in the selected frequency band unprocessed. Therefore, to overcome the shortcoming of the fast kurtogram method, a method which can wipe off the noise in the whole frequency band is necessary. This paper proposes a novel faint signal extraction method by time– frequency distribution image dimensionality reduction. Since time–frequency distribution image can reveal intrinsic fea-ture of nonstationary signals and can make the weak impulses feature prominent, and besides, the transient impulse feature and the noise component lie in different dimensions, so using the dimensionality reduction method based on singular value decomposition to suppress the background noise in the raw time–frequency distribution image is moti-vated. <b>A</b> bearing <b>outer</b> <b>race</b> fault signal obtained from a test-to-failure experiment and a bearing inner race fault signal obtained from an experimental motor are employed to demonstrate the enhanced performance of the proposed method in faint signal extraction.

40|$|The {{rolling element}} bearing is a key {{component}} of many machines. Accurate and timely diagnosis of its faults is critical for proactive predictive maintenance. The research described in this thesis focuses on the development of techniques for detecting and diagnosing incipient bearing faults. These techniques are based on improved dynamic models and enhanced signal processing algorithms. Various common fault detection techniques for {{rolling element bearing}}s are reviewed in this work and a detailed experimental investigation is described for several selected methods. Envelope analysis is widely used to obtain the bearing defect harmonics from the spectrum of the envelope of a vibration signal. This enables the detection and diagnosis of faults, and has shown good results in identifying incipient faults occurring on the different parts of a bearing. However, a critical step in implementing envelope analysis is to determine the frequency band that contains the signal component corresponding to the bearing fault (the one with highest signal to noise ratio). The choice of filter band is conventionally made via manual inspection of the spectrum to identify the resonant frequency where the largest change has occurred. In this work, a spectral kurtosis (SK) method is enhanced to enable determination of the optimum envelope analysis parameters, including the filter band and centre frequency, through a short time Fourier transform (STFT). The results show that the maximum amplitude of the kurtogram indicates the optimal parameters of band pass filter that allows both outer race and inner race faults to be determined from the optimised envelope spectrum. A performance evaluation is carried out on the kurtogram and the fast kurtogram, based on a simulated impact signal masked by different noise levels. This shows that as the signal to noise ratio (SNR) reaches as low as - 5 dB the STFT-based kurtogram is more effective at identifying periodic components due to bearing faults, and is less influenced by irregular noise pulses than the wavelet based fast kurtogram. A study of the accuracy of rolling-bearing diagnostic features in detecting bearing wear processes and monitoring fault sizes is presented for a range of radial clearances. Subsequently, a nonlinear dynamic model of a deep groove ball bearing with five degrees of freedom is developed. The model incorporates local defects and clearance increments in order to gain the insight into the bearing dynamics. Simulation results indicate that the vibrations at fault characteristic frequencies exhibit significant variability for increasing clearances. An increased vibration level is detected at the bearing characteristic frequency for <b>an</b> <b>outer</b> <b>race</b> fault, whereas a decreased vibration level is found for an inner race fault. Outcomes of laboratory experiments on several bearing clearance grades, with different local defects, are used herein for model validation purposes. The experimental validation indicates that the envelope spectrum is not accurate enough to quantify the rolling element bearing fault severity adequately. To improve the results, a new method has been developed by combining a conventional bispectrum (CB) and modulation signal bispectrum (MSB) with envelope analysis. This suppresses the inevitable noise in the envelope signal, and hence provides more accurate diagnostic features. Both the simulation and the experimental results show that MSB extracts small changes from a faulty bearing more reliably, enabling more accurate and reliable fault severity diagnosis. Moreover, the vibration amplitudes at the fault characteristic frequencies exhibit significant changes with increasing clearance. However, the vibration amplitude tends to increase with the severity of <b>an</b> <b>outer</b> <b>race</b> fault and decrease with the severity of an inner race fault. It is therefore necessary to take these effects into account when diagnosing the size of a defect...|$|E
