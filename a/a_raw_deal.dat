Prompted by Asquith, Robertson submitted a memorandum on war aims (31 August). He wanted Germany preserved as a major power as a block to Russian influence, possibly gaining Austria to compensate for the loss of her colonies, Alsace-Lorraine and her North Sea and Baltic ports (including the Kiel Canal).|$|E
25|$|The Halifax Borough Committee and Watch Committee had {{complete}} {{control over the}} Force at this time. There {{was a great deal}} of discontent in the Halifax Force and Richardson thought his men were getting <b>a</b> <b>raw</b> <b>deal</b> from the Borough Watch Committee but got short shrift from them when he tried to improve their working life. Apparently he got very tenacious about their working hours and would not back down after repeated attempts to get them a better deal got dragged out over a period of time. In the end, however, he won the day. His men were very grateful for his efforts and a brass plaque was cast in 1910 and erected in the entrance hall of Harrison Road Police Station from 1910 until 1985. When the Station moved to a new location it was re-erected at the new station at Richmond Close, Halifax. Both Alfred Richardson and his brother Ernest Frank Richardson were involved in improving the indexing of police procedures on identifying past law-breakers by fingerprints and body measurements. Alfred Richardson tended to favour the Bertillon (1853–1914) method which involved several body measurements being recorded. His brother, Frank Richardson preferred indexing the records after photographing on-site fingerprints. (He had been working in conjunction with the Home Office, London, for many years on experimenting to find the best method.) Alfred Richardson gave lectures locally on the differences between the Bertillon method and photographic fingerprinting.|$|E
500|$|Like Big Red Rock, {{the vastness}} of rural and outback landscapes were {{reflected}} in the artwork and music of Beyond. According to a review by Forester in The Age, the band and album have [...] "titles to suggest space, time and distance" [...] and some tracks had an [...] "indigenous appeal". The lead track's title, [...] "Moondah", translates into English as [...] "beyond". In April 1976 Loughnan, who wrote the song, said in a TV Times interview: [...] "The aborigines have had <b>a</b> <b>raw</b> <b>deal</b> in the past. The song expresses {{the hope that they}} get better treatment in the future". [...] "Moondah (beyond)" [...] begins with clapsticks, log drum, imitation didgeridoo, and sounds evocative of indigenous singing.|$|E

500|$|Norman Wilner of MSN {{considered}} Licence to Kill {{the second}} worst Bond film, above only A View to a Kill, but defended Dalton, saying he [...] "got <b>a</b> <b>raw</b> <b>deal.</b> The actor {{who could have}} been the definitive 007... had the bad luck to inherit the role just as the series was at its weakest, struggling to cope with its general creative decline {{and the end of the}} Cold War". In October 2008 Time Out re-issued a review of Licence to Kill and also thought that Dalton was unfortunate, saying [...] "one has to feel for Dalton, who was never given a fair shake by either of the films in which he appeared". On a more positive note, Chuck O'Leary of Fantastica Daily remarked that it was a rare entry in the Bond series where the danger seems real.|$|E
500|$|Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh {{admitted}} that his government {{was responsible for}} failure in preventing the attacks by MNS on north Indian candidates at Railways examination centres and ordered a probe into the incident, which will also enquire into why the job advertisements where not given in Marathi newspapers.

Such incidents are affecting {{the image of the}} state and I have instructed the DGP to take stern action," [...] Deshmukh said. However, NCP leader Narayan Rane, wrote a piece in 23 October 2008, issue of 'Prahar', in a city newspaper he owns, pleading that Marathis should get their legitimate share in the central government sector. The Times of India noted, the essay indicates that Rane continues to have a soft spot for MNS chief Raj Thackeray– the two were close friends when Rane was in the Sena. Stating that the Marathis were getting <b>a</b> <b>raw</b> <b>deal</b> in central government jobs such as income tax and the railways, Rane said it was perplexing that of 54,000, only 54 Marathis were summoned for the railway recruitment exams. The railways must give Marathis their legitimate share in employment, Rane said.|$|E

5000|$|His biographer, Matthew Bruccoli, in {{describing}} the style of By Love Possessed, also identified characteristics of his mature works (particularly Guard of Honor), characteristics that reached their peak in the best-seller: ...long sentences, frequent use of parenthetical constructions, rhetorical questions, elaborate parallelism, inclusion of unfamiliar words, unacknowledged (classical) quotations, ironically intended word choices, a habit of following a formal statement with a clarifying or deflating colloquialism, polyptoton (repetition of a word in different cases and inflections, as in “result’s result”), inverted word order, double negatives, the custom of defining a word or providing alternatives for it, and periodic sentences in which the meaning becomes clear at the end. The effect of these conjoined elements can be a deliberate density of expression... Cozzens once said, [...] "I have no theme except that people get <b>a</b> very <b>raw</b> <b>deal</b> from life." ...|$|R

Lanzon {{actually}} auditioned {{them one by}} one until Bernie came in with his high range and that suited the band perfectly. This incarnation became Paris. He can be heard on the June 1980 recorded Hot Chocolate hit [...] "No Doubt about it". At the end of 1979 Paris became Grand Prix, and Lanzon played keyboards on three albums. In early 1980 Lanzon played keyboards on the Cris-Spedding album I'm Not Like Everybody Else. The third record Samurai is released in 1983 by Chrysalis Records. The Grand Prix sound can be described as melodic hard rock with some clear Styx and Journey influences. In 1984 Lanzon replaced Vic Emerson of Sad Café for a British tour.|$|R
