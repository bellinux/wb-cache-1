For this reason, after <b>the</b> <b>approvals</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pilot program on July 14, 2005, and its extensions on December 12, 2006, and July 19, 2007, <b>the</b> final <b>approval</b> <b>of</b> using <b>the</b> risk-based approach to margining customer accounts by the SEC on July 29, 2008, at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> global financial crisis, appeared to be one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most radical and puzzling steps in <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> margin regulations.
