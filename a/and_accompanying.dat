5|$|As Aldenham {{was making}} a turn at a {{position}} north of the islet of Škrda, to sail between islands of Planik and Olib, she hit a mine that exploded under her engine room. The ship broke in two and her bow sank quickly, followed by her stern a little later, at 15:29. Cold weather hampered rescue efforts by Atherton <b>and</b> <b>accompanying</b> motor launches ML 238 and HDML 1162, and only 58 seamen and five officers, including Farrant, were {{pulled out of the}} sea. 126 crewmen died, as well as a wounded Yugoslav Partisan transported from Pag for medical treatment and Yugoslav Partisan liaison officer, Colonel Ivan Preradović. Aldenham was the last Royal Navy destroyer lost in World War II.|$|E

Only a few gliders missed the landing-zone, {{due to the}} poor weather and errors in navigation. Once the headquarters staff <b>and</b> <b>accompanying</b> airborne troops had been gathered together, the headquarters {{was moved to the}} Le Bas de Ranville area and set up there. Contact was established with the headquarters of 5th Parachute Brigade at 05:00, and with the headquarters of 3rd Parachute Brigade at 12:35, and the division linked up with 1st Special Service Brigade as it advanced from the invasion beaches at 13:53.|$|E

5|$|In 1915, rose {{hobbyist}} and Oregon Journal editor Jesse Currey convinced {{city officials}} {{to establish a}} rose test garden to protect hybrid roses grown in Europe during World War I. Portland's Park Bureau approved the idea in 1917, allowing rose enthusiasts in England to send roses to Portland for preservation. City landscape architect Florence Holmes Gerke began designing the International Rose Test Garden <b>and</b> <b>accompanying</b> amphitheatre in 1921. The garden was dedicated in June 1924 with Currey as the first curator. He served {{until his death in}} 1927. A stone bench in the garden honors Currey's work as founder.|$|E
5|$|In September 2013, Rolls-Royce {{announced}} that it had increased the AE-1107C engine's power by 17 percent via {{the adoption of a}} new Block 3 turbine, an increase in fuel valve flow capacity, <b>and</b> <b>accompanying</b> software updates. The upgrade should increase the reliability in high-altitude, high-heat conditions and boost maximum payload limitations from 6,000ft to 8,000ft. A Block 4 upgrade is reportedly being examined, which may increase power by up to 26 percent, producing close to 10,000hp, and improve fuel consumption.|$|E
5|$|It {{was also}} {{around this time}} that the Rockets would unveil their classic yellow and red logo <b>and</b> <b>accompanying</b> uniforms used {{until the end of}} the 1994–95 season. Winter left soon after, being fired in January 1973 {{following}} a ten-game losing streak, and was replaced by Johnny Egan. Egan led the Rockets back to the playoffs in 1975, where the franchise also managed to win their first round against the New York Knicks, subsequently losing to the veteran Boston Celtics in 5 games. At that time the Rockets gained popularity in Houston, selling out several home games during the regular season as the Rockets battled for a playoff spot and then selling out all of their home playoff games.|$|E

5|$|Several {{studies found}} that the {{financial}} crisis <b>and</b> <b>accompanying</b> recession could {{not account for the}} entirety of the slowdown and that structural changes likely share at least partial credit. A 2013 study estimated that changes to the health system had been responsible for {{about a quarter of the}} recent reduction in inflation. Paul Krawzak claimed that even if cost controls succeed in reducing the amount spent on healthcare, such efforts on their own may be insufficient to outweigh the long-term burden placed by demographic changes, particularly the growth of the population on Medicare.|$|E

Midway along the Broadwalk in the north section of the park is a Grade II listed bronze statue of Alderman John Lucas, mounted on a sandstone plinth and granite base. Built in 1902, it was paid for by public subscription. The wrought iron gates <b>and</b> <b>accompanying</b> stone piers which greet visitors at the north-eastern entrance to the park are also Grade II listed.|$|E
