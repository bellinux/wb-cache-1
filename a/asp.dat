5|$|In January 1961, {{as part of}} {{the process}} of decolonisation, the island's British {{authorities}} drew up constituencies and held democratic elections. Both the <b>ASP</b> and the ZNP won 11 of the available 22 seats in Zanzibar's Parliament, so further elections were held in June with the number of seats increased to 23. The ZNP entered into a coalition with the Zanzibar and Pemba People's Party (ZPPP) and this time took 13 seats, while the <b>ASP,</b> despite receiving the most votes, won just 10. Electoral fraud was suspected by the <b>ASP</b> and civil disorder broke out, resulting in 68 deaths. To maintain control, the coalition government banned the more radical opposition parties, filled the civil service with its own appointees, and politicised the police.|$|E

The conflict led to a schism, with Morales and his supporters splitting to form their own party, the Political Instrument for the Sovereignty of the Peoples (Instrumento Político por la Soberanía de los Pueblos – IPSP). The movement's bases defected en masse to the IPSP, leaving the <b>ASP</b> to crumble and Véliz to join the centre-right New Republican Force (Nueva Fuerza Republicana – NFR), for which Morales denounced him as a traitor to the cocalero cause. Continuing his activism, in 1998 Morales led another cocalero march from El Chapare to la Paz, and came under increasing criticism from the government, who repeatedly {{accused him of being}} involved in the cocaine trade and mocked him for how he spoke and his lack of education.|$|E

PURPOSE: To identify structured <b>ASPs</b> in nursing worldwide and {{to describe their}} characteristics. METHOD: Systematic literature review of PubMed-, CINAHL-, PsycINFO-, and Embase- listed studies published up to August 31, 2010. <b>ASPs</b> were described in view of a predefined set of criteria. RESULTS: A total of 114 articles describing 119 <b>ASPs</b> were included. Of these, 85 % were located in North America. The median duration of <b>ASPs</b> was 6 years (interquartile range, 2 - 6). The majority focused on education (86 %) and clinical practice (50 %). Community health facilities (57 %) and hospitals (40 %) were prime settings. Twenty-two percent of <b>ASPs</b> were defined by contracts, 3 % were governed by bylaws, and 66 % were part of strategic plans (28 %). Funding sources were mentioned in 76 %. However, although 66 % of <b>ASPs</b> have been evaluated, the evaluations are generally neither consistent nor reliable.

40|$|The transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT) is a popular, simple, and {{powerful}} test of linkage, {{which can be}} used to analyze data consisting of transmissions to the affected members of families with any kind pedigree structure, including affected sib pairs (<b>ASPs).</b> Although {{it is based on the}} preferential transmission of a particular marker allele across families, it is not a valid test of association for <b>ASPs.</b> Martin et al. devised a similar statistic for <b>ASPs,</b> T(sp), which is also based on preferential transmission of a marker allele but which is a valid test of both linkage and association for <b>ASPs.</b> It is, however, less powerful than the TDT as a test of linkage for <b>ASPs.</b> What I show is that the differences between the TDT and T(sp) are due to the fact that, although both statistics are based on preferential transmission of a marker allele, the TDT also exploits excess sharing in identity-by-descent transmissions to <b>ASPs.</b> Furthermore, I show that both of these statistics are members of a family of 2 ̆ 7 TDT-like 2 ̆ 7 statistics for <b>ASPs.</b> The statistics in this family are based on preferential transmission but also, to varying extents, exploit excess sharing. From this family of statistics, we see that, although the TDT exploits excess sharing to some extent, it is possible to do so to a greater extent - and thus produce a more powerful test of linkage, for <b>ASPs,</b> than is provided by the TDT. Power simulations conducted under a number of disease models are used to verify that the most powerful member of this family of TDT-like statistics is more powerful than the TDT for <b>ASPs...</b>|$|R
5|$|The Zanzibar Revolution {{occurred}} in 1964 {{and led to}} the overthrow of the Sultan of Zanzibar and his mainly Arab government by local African revolutionaries. Zanzibar was an ethnically diverse state consisting of a number of islands off the east coast of Tanganyika which had been granted independence by Britain in 1963. In a series of parliamentary elections preceding independence, the Arab minority succeeded in retaining the hold on power it had inherited from Zanzibar's former existence as an overseas territory of Oman. Frustrated by under-representation in Parliament despite winning 54% of the vote in the July 1963 election, the mainly African Afro-Shirazi Party (<b>ASP)</b> allied itself with the left-wing Umma Party, and early on the morning of 12 January 1964 <b>ASP</b> member John Okello mobilised around 600–800 revolutionaries on the main island of Unguja (Zanzibar Island). Having overrun the country's police force and appropriated their weaponry, the insurgents proceeded to Zanzibar Town where they overthrew the Sultan and his government. Reprisals against Arab and South Asian civilians on the island followed; the resulting death toll is disputed, with estimates ranging from several hundred to 20,000. The moderate <b>ASP</b> leader Abeid Karume became the country's new president and head of state, and positions of power were granted to Umma party members.|$|E

5|$|Amnesic {{shellfish}} poisoning (<b>ASP)</b> {{was first}} reported in eastern Canada in 1987. It {{is caused by}} the substance domoic acid found in certain diatoms of the genus Pseudo-nitzschia. Bivalves can become toxic when they filter these microalgae out of the water. Domoic acid is a low-molecular weight amino acid that is able to destroy brain cells causing memory loss, gastroenteritis, long-term neurological problems or death. In an outbreak in the western United States in 1993, finfish were also implicated as vectors, and seabirds and mammals suffered neurological symptoms. In the United States and Canada, a regulatory limit of 20µg/g of domoic acid in shellfish meat is set.|$|E
5|$|At pH values {{between the}} two pKa values, the {{zwitterion}} predominates, but coexists in dynamic equilibrium with small amounts of net negative and net positive ions. At the exact midpoint {{between the two}} pKa values, the trace amount of net negative and trace of net positive ions exactly balance, so that average net charge of all forms present is zero. This pH {{is known as the}} isoelectric point pI, so pI = ½(pKa1 + pKa2). The individual amino acids all have slightly different pKa values, so have different isoelectric points. For amino acids with charged side chains, the pKa of the side chain is involved. Thus for <b>Asp,</b> Glu with negative side chains, pI = ½(pKa1 + pKaR), where pKaR is the side chain pKa. Cysteine also has potentially negative side chain with pKaR = 8.14, so pI should be calculated as for <b>Asp</b> and Glu, even though the side chain is not significantly charged at neutral pH. For His, Lys, and Arg with positive side chains, pI = ½(pKaR + pKa2). Amino acids have zero mobility in electrophoresis at their isoelectric point, although this behaviour is more usually exploited for peptides and proteins than single amino acids. Zwitterions have minimum solubility at their isoelectric point and some amino acids (in particular, with non-polar side chains) can be isolated by precipitation from water by adjusting the pH to the required isoelectric point.|$|E

40|$|After school {{programs}} (<b>ASPs)</b> are popular and receive substantial public funding. Aside from their child-care and supervision value, <b>ASPs</b> often provide youth development and skill-building activities that might reduce delinquent behavior. These possibilities and the obser-vation that arrests for juvenile crime peak between 2 p. m. and 6 p. m. on school days have {{increased interest in}} the delinquency prevention potential of <b>ASPs.</b> This study examined ef-fects of participation in <b>ASPs</b> conducted in Maryland during the 1999 – 2000 school year and the mechanism through which such programs may affect delinquent behavior. Results imply that participation reduced delinquent behavior for middle-school but not for elementary-school-aged youths. This reduction was not achieved by decreasing time spent unsupervised or by increasing involvement in constructive activities, but by increasing intentions not to use drugs and positive peer associations. Effects on these outcomes were strongest in programs that incorporated a high emphasis on social skills and character development.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{decision}} tree model for evaluation {{of the next generation}} radiation portal technology (Advanced Spectroscopic Portals or <b>ASPs)</b> to scan containers entering the United States non-intrusively against nuclear or radiological weapons. Advanced Spectroscopic Portals are compared against the current designs of portal monitors (plastic scintillators or PVTs). We consider five alternative deployment strategies: 1) Exclusive deployment of <b>ASPs</b> replacing all the PVTs currently deployed at U. S. ports of entry, 2) Sequential deployment of <b>ASPs</b> with PVTs installing <b>ASPs</b> in all secondary and some primary inspections areas, 3) Sequential deployment of <b>ASPs</b> with PVTs installing APs in only secondary inspections areas, 4) Exclusive deployment of PVTs, 5) Stop deployment of new portal monitors and continue inspections with the current capacity. The baseline solution recommends a hybrid strategy that supports the deployment of new designs of portal monitors for secondary inspections and current designs of portal through ports of entry, the probability of successful detonation, detection probabilities and the extra deterrence that each alternative may provide. We also illustrate that the list of most significant parameters depends heavily on the dollar equivalent of overall consequences and the probability of attack attempt. For low probability and low consequence scenarios, false alarm related parameters are found to have more significance. Our extensive exploratory analysis shows that for most parametric combinations, continued deployment of portal monitors is recommended. Exclusive deployment of <b>ASPs</b> is optimal under high risk scenarios. However, we also show that if <b>ASPs</b> fail to improve detection capability, then extra benefits they offer in reducing false alarms may not justify their mass deployment...|$|R

The Arab Ba'ath Movement was established by Michel Aflaq and Salah al-Din al-Bitar in the 1940s, others who played a notable role {{in the early stages}} of the Ba'athist movement were Zaki al-Arsuzi, Wahib al-Ghanim and Jallal al-Sayyid. Akram al-Hawrani founded the Arab Socialist Party (<b>ASP)</b> in 1953 – the Ba'ath Party was established through a merger of the <b>ASP</b> and the Arab Ba'ath Party. Of the 150 delegates to the founding congress of the Arab Ba'ath Party in 1947, the majority were either middle-class professionals or intellectuals. By the 1950s the party had managed to acquire an urban middle class base. However, the Ba'ath Party was not a purely middle class party, and from the very beginning, it sent party cadres to rural areas to recruit new members and form new party organisations. In 1956, the Ba'ath Party organized the first labour protest in Syrian history. While the Ba'ath Party was strong, its decision to recruit members from across society led to tribalism and clientelism within the party. Party leaders then opted to overlook democratic norms and procedures.|$|E

We analyze the nature of the risk differences and then propose a model of how would-be customers process those risks. In our model, prospects first assess whether they can tolerate the worst case scenario and if they are able to do due diligence on the likely outcome. They consider benefits only if one of the previous assertions is true. The worst case scenario for enterprise applications is truly dire and only technologically sophisticated businesses are better able to identify the true risk profile. For vertical niche <b>ASPs</b> the worst case scenario is relatively mild, but economies of scale make the benefits relatively more appealing to small businesses...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Despite {{vigorous}} {{infection control}} measures, Clostridium difficile continues to cause significant dis-ease burden. Antibiotic stewardship programmes (<b>ASPs)</b> may prevent C. difficile infections by limiting exposure to certain antibiotics. Our {{objective was to}} perform ameta-analysis of published studies to assess the effect of <b>ASPs</b> on the risk of C. difficile infection in hospitalized adult patients. Methods: Searches of PubMed,Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and two Cochrane databases were conducted to find all published studies on interventions related to antibiotic steward-ship and C. difficile. Two investigators independently assessed study eligibility and extracted data. Risk of bias was assessed using the Downs and Black tool. Risk ratios were pooled using random effects models. Heterogeneity was evaluated using I 2 statistic. Results: The final search yielded 891 articles; 78 full articles were reviewed and 16 articles were identified for inclusion. Included articles used quasi-experimental (interrupted time series or before–after) or observational (case–control) study designs. When the results of all studieswere pooled in a random effectsmodel, a significant protective effect (pooled risk ratio 0. 48; 95 % CI: 0. 38, 0. 62) was observed between <b>ASPs</b> and C. difficile incidence.

5|$|Evolutionary {{developmental}} biology ('Evo Devo') has assembled evidence from embryology and genetics {{to show how}} evolution has acted at all scales from the whole organism down to individual genes, proteins and genetic switches. In the case of countershaded mammals with dark (often brownish) upper parts and lighter (often buff or whitish) under parts, {{such as in the}} house mouse, it is the Agouti gene which creates the difference in shading. Agouti encodes for a protein, the Agouti signalling peptide (<b>ASP),</b> which specifically inhibits the action of the Melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R). In the absence of the Agouti protein, alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone stimulates the cells bearing MC1R, melanocytes, to produce dark eumelanin, colouring the skin and fur dark brown or black. In the presence of the Agouti protein, the same system produces the lighter-coloured, yellow or red phaeomelanin. A genetic switch active in the cells of the embryo that will become the belly skin causes the Agouti gene to become active there, creating the countershading seen in adult mammals.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} high-involvement and short-term supply relationships, known as agile supply partnerships (<b>ASPs),</b> and explores the conditions that support the development of such inter-organizational relationships. <b>ASPs</b> appear to be most relevant in supply material categories which have a high impact on the appearance or functionality of the product. Conversely, in supply categories with a low impact, long-term partnerships are preferred. Four main characteristics of <b>ASPs</b> are identified: they are part of a portfolio of relationships to balance the rigidities of long-term strategic partnerships; they have project-like features; they are developed from a network of pre-qualified suppliers; they are recurring and intermittent rather than continuous or isolated one-off short-term partnerships. Research limitations/implications – The research has been carried out in the context of an Italian footwear district. The research can help decision makers in the fashion industry, and potentially other sectors affected by high turbulence, to identify when <b>ASPs</b> are most appropriate and what characteristics they should have. This research contributes to the literature on agility by empirically evaluating the apparent paradox related to the specific characteristics of supply relationships required to foster an agile strategy and by clarifying the conditions under which fashion companies develop <b>ASPs...</b>|$|R
