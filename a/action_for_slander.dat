[...] Another issue was Newport interests versus Providence interests. [...] For several years, Hopkins was locked in a bitter rivalry with Samuel Ward of Westerly, a strong supporter of hard currency and also a champion of Newport, his town of origin.

5000|$|In his {{disputes}} {{with the political}} right, Erzberger set himself in particularly sharp opposition to the German National People's Party (the old conservatives), on whom he laid {{the responsibility for the}} war; the result was a personal dispute with the leader of the Nationalists, the war-time Secretary of State for the Treasury, Karl Helfferich, who published a brochure titled [...] "Fort mit Erzberger!" [...] ("Get rid of Erzberger!"), and Erzberger was ultimately compelled to bring an <b>action</b> against Helfferich <b>for</b> <b>slander.</b> The case was heard in a Berlin court from 19 January to 12 March 1920. The action resulted in a small fine for Helfferich (German law did not make provision for any damages or penalties <b>for</b> <b>slander).</b> The court, however, in its judgment of 12 March 1920, took the line that Helfferich's allegations regarding Erzberger's corrupt business practices and untruthful statements were partly justified. Erzberger was consequently compelled by his party to resign his ministerial office and to give up his seat in the National Assembly in March 1920. During the trial, an attempt was made upon Erzberger's life as he was leaving the court that left him rather seriously wounded.|$|R
50|$|In October 2016, {{the film}} ran into trouble after an {{aspiring}} director, Anthony, {{alleged that the}} story of Bogan belonged to him. Anthony claimed that he had begun production on a film titled Halwa starring Lollu Sabha Jeeva for producer Kasthuri Raja in 2011, and after the film ran into production trouble, he had emailed a copy of the script to Bogans co-producer, Ganesh, who later chose to make it with Lakshman as director. Anthony later claimed that Ganesh had used goondas to attack him, and that he had turned down Vikraman of the Director’s Associations request for him to take away a compensation package. In reply, Lakshman criticised Anthony and threatened him with legal <b>action</b> <b>for</b> trying <b>slander</b> the film and his name, and revealed that he had been tipped off by producer Nemichand Jhabak and actress Nayanthara about Anthonys attempts to use his story in a different project. Concluding the issue, Vikraman suggested that Anthonys claims were false and that he had no sympathy for the pair of the directors as the story seemed strongly inspired from the English film Face/Off (1997). The film subsequently finished production in early November 2016, after a song choreographed by Sheriff and other patchwork was completed.|$|R

50|$|Legislators in {{countries}} using the Westminster system, {{such as the}} United Kingdom, are protected from civil <b>action</b> <b>for</b> <b>slander</b> and libel by parliamentary immunity whilst {{they are in the}} House.
