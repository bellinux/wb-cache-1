The use of organic electronics {{for the detection}} of explosive residues allows for large scale, solution-processible, and environmentally stable devices with a high selectivity for TNT detection. Currently, fluorescence-based sensors are used in TNT detection, but the synthesis of the fluorescent molecules can be complicated and costly. Hence, we introduce a new design paradigm to overcome this limitation. Specifically, organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) were created using 6, 13 -bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl) (TIPS) pentacene as the active material to collect a baseline mobility and the on current to off current ratio (ON/OFF). Then, blends of TIPS-pentacene and varying concentrations of TNT were used in OFETs, and the change in the ON/OFF and charge carrier mobility were evaluated. With the introduction of TNT, the ON/OFF increases in value and it was observed that the concentration of the TNT in the film blend has an effect on how much the ON/OFF and hole mobility increases. The measured change in the ON/OFF were used to create a calibration curve that shows the dependence of the TNT concentration. A device that incorporates the TIPS-pentacene FET could eventually be used to sweep an <b>area</b> <b>or</b> <b>surface</b> for the presence of dangerous explosives through a change in an electrical signal in the device and interpretation of the calibration curves...|$|E

This article provides a review of the principle and expression of gas sensing response as well as the current experimental efforts on the hydrothermal synthesis and gas sensing characteristics of WO 3. The morphologies and structures of WO 3 determine the gas sensing characteristics to a large extent. Because the increase of active surface <b>area</b> <b>or</b> <b>surface</b> to volume ratio would enhance the properties for detecting gases，small sizes of grains need to be decreased. Among the numerous preparation methods，hydrothermal synthesis is easily used to grow various desired morphologies and structures with small sizes.

Rigidity surfaces are utilized to generate robust analytical expressions for maximum, minimum, mean and Gaussian curvatures of solvent-solute interfaces, and define a generalized Poisson-Boltzmann (GPB) equation with a smooth dielectric profile. Extensive correlation analysis is performed to examine the linear dependence of surface area, surface enclosed volume, maximum curvature, minimum curvature, mean curvature and Gaussian curvature for solvation modeling. It is found that surface area and surfaces enclosed volumes are highly correlated to each others, and poorly correlated to various curvatures for six test sets of molecules. Different curvatures are weakly correlated {{to each other for}} six test sets of molecules, but are strongly correlated to each other within each test set of molecules. Based on correlation analysis, we construct twenty six nontrivial nonpolar solvation models. Our numerical results reveal that the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential plays a vital role in nonpolar solvation modeling, especially for molecules involving strong van der Waals interactions. It is found that curvatures are at least as important as surface <b>area</b> <b>or</b> <b>surface</b> enclosed volume in nonpolar solvation modeling. In conjugation with the GPB model, various curvature based nonpolar solvation models are shown to offer some of the best solvation free energy predictions {{for a wide range of}} test sets.

Understanding interaction of chlorpyrifos with colloidal materials is fundamental for assessing fate and toxicity of chlorpyrifos in soil and aquatic environments. The objectives of this study were: (1) to quantify sorption and desorption of chlorpyrifos on colloidal materials in aqueous systems; (2) to investigate hydrolysis of chlorpyrifos in aqueous systems; (3) to evaluate the effects of colloidal materials {{on the fate of}} the sorbed chlorpyrifos in aqueous systems; and (4) to study abiotic transformation of chlorpyrifos in water;Six reference smectites, humic acid and suspended sediment collected from the Upper Cedar River near Janesville, Iowa were used for the present study. X-ray diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy, ICP-AES and chemical analysis were employed to characterize the colloidal materials. GC and HPLC were used to quantify chlorpyrifos and its degradates in aqueous systems. The results indicate a large difference in sorption affinities and variation in desorption among smectites. The sorption affinity for chlorpyrifos was not correlated to cation-exchange capacity, surface <b>area</b> <b>or</b> <b>surface</b> charge density, but {{may be related to the}} fabric of smectite quasicrystals. Substantial sorption-desorption hysteresis was found for all smectites and the suspended sediment. Chlorpyrifos was strongly sorbed by HA with negligible desorption in aqueous solution. Chlorpyrifos degraded in aqueous systems with half-lives ranged from 27 to 158 days, depending on the chemistry of aqueous solutions. The rate of chlorpyrifos hydrolysis decreased in the presence of suspended smectites in aqueous systems. The formation of chlorpyrifos-colloid complexes inhibited hydrolysis and influenced fate of chlorpyrifos in aqueous systems, suggesting that sorption of chlorpyrifos on suspended sediment may potentially prolong the exposure time of organisms such as fish to chlorpyrifos in aquatic environments. An abiotic transformation of chlorpyrifos to chlorpyrifos oxon in tap water is reported in this study. Active chlorine dispersed in tap water was responsible for the chemical transformation. The findings raise a new concern about the safety of domestic use of chlorpyrifos products...|$|E
40|$|Grain-size {{dependencies}} in fallout radionuclide activity {{have been}} attributed to either increase in specific surface area in finer grain sizes or differing mineralogical abundances in different grain sizes. Here, we consider a third possibility, that the concentration and composition of grain coatings, where fallout radionuclides reside, controls their activity in fluvial sediment. We evaluated these three possible explanations in two experiments: (1) we examined the effect of sediment grain size, mineralogy, and composition of the acid-extractable materials on the distribution of 7 Be, 10 Be, 137 Cs, and unsupported 210 Pb in detrital sediment samples collected from rivers in China and the United States, and (2) we periodically monitored 7 Be, 137 Cs, and 210 Pb retention in samples of known composition exposed to natural fallout in Ohio, USA for 294 days. Acid-extractable materials (made up predominately of Fe, Mn, Al, and Ca from secondary minerals and grain coatings produced during pedogenesis) are positively related to the abundance of fallout radionuclides in our sediment samples. Grain-size dependency of fallout radionuclide concentrations was significant in detrital sediment samples, but not in samples exposed to fallout under controlled conditions. Mineralogy had a large effect on 7 Be and 210 Pb retention in samples exposed to fallout, suggesting that sieving sediments to a single grain size or using specific surface area-based correction terms may not completely control for preferential distribution of these nuclides. We conclude that time-dependent geochemical, pedogenic, and sedimentary processes together result in the observed differences in nuclide distribution between different grain sizes and substrate compositions. These findings likely explain variability of measured nuclide activities in river networks that exceeds the variability introduced by analytical techniques as well as spatial and temporal differences in erosion rates and processes. In short, we suggest that presence and amount of pedogenic grain coatings is more important than either specific surface <b>area</b> <b>or</b> <b>surface</b> charge in setting the distribution of fallout radionuclides...|$|E

Spatial data pertain {{to the location of}} geographical entities together with their spatial dimensions and are classified as point, line, <b>area</b> <b>or</b> <b>surface.</b> This dissertation deals with a sub-set of spatial data, land boundary data that result from the activities performed by surveying and mapping organisations for the development of land parcels. The prototype system has been developed, utilising an event-driven paradigm for the user-interface, to exploit the potential of digital spatial data being generated from the utilisation of electronic techniques. The system provides {{for the creation of a}} digital model of the cadastral network and dependent data sets for an area of interest from hard copy records. This initial model is calibrated on registered control and updated by field survey to produce an amended model. The field-calibrated model then is electronically validated to ensure it complies with standards of format and content. The prototype system was designed specifically to create a database of land boundary data for subsequent retrieval by land professionals for surveying, mapping and related activities. Data extracted from this database are utilised for subsequent field survey operations without the need to create an initial digital model of an area of interest. Statistical reporting of differences resulting when subsequent initial and calibrated models are compared, replaces the traditional checking operations of spatial data performed by a land registry office. Digital lodgement of survey data is fundamental to the creation of the database of accurate land boundary data. This creation of the database is fundamental also to the efficient integration of accurate spatial data about land being generated by modem technology such as global positioning systems, and remote sensing and imaging, with land boundary information and other information held in Government databases. The prototype system developed provides for the delivery of accurate, digital land boundary data for the land registration process to ensure the continued maintenance of the integrity of the cadastre. Such data should meet also the more general and encompassing requirements of, and prove to be of tangible, longer term benefit to the developing, electronic land information industry...|$|E
40|$|Nano{{particles}} are particles with {{a maximum}} size of 100 nm {{in at least one}} dimension. Nanoparticles are released by both natural and anthropogenic sources. Up until now only exposure limit values are present for bulk size substances. However, nanoparticles might have different health effects and or dose-response relationships. It is believed that small particles might have greater reactivity potential, e. g. inflammatory effects per unit mass. Since nanoparticles might have different health effects and or dose-response relationships compared with bulk size (micrometer size and above) particles, {{there is a need to}} evaluate the feasibility of deriving exposure limit values for these type of particles. Inhalation exposure to nanoparticles can cause, among others, local inflammatory effects. These effects are partly dependent on location of deposition of the particles in the lungs, which dependents on particle size. Physical phenomena like agglomeration and aggregation of nanoparticles can change the particle size and thereby the location deposition. Agglomeration/aggregation can also include several different substances, increasing the complexity of the exposure, but also the complexity of the health effect. Exposure limits are determined by combining exposure and hazard parameters. It is essential that both factors are available. Hazardous substances are identified and the effect is quantified in a dose-response relationship. Exposure assessment focuses on the possible concentrations present during exposure scenarios. The research of both exposure assessment and toxicology for nano particles is in the developing stage. First attempts are made to derive exposure limit values for nano sized materials. Surface area is a metric which is believed to be important when nanoparticles are involved. However, more than one type of surface area metrics can be defined, which may vary in biological relevancy and complexity, dependent on several biological processes. Lung deposited surface area concentration and lung fluid available surface area seem to be the most relevant metrics. The concept of surface area is only believed to be relevant for insoluble particles, as soluble particles will dissolve in the lung fluid, making mass concentration the only relevant metric. At this moment, there is no consensus about surface area as a dose metric or an exposure metric. In toxicology, surface area as a dose metric is not yet accepted to be the most relevant dose metric, leaving only few studies with surface area as the dose metric. Toxicological studies using this type of dose metric often do not use a surface area per volume metric, but only total or calculated surface <b>area,</b> <b>or</b> <b>surface</b> area, normalized for lung weight. Surface area as the dose metric in exposure limits has potency as efforts are made to increase knowledge on dose-response relationships and exposure assessment methods based on surface area.

40|$|For this Masters Project, {{our team}} {{evaluated}} both {{the water and}} energy supply and demand at the Mpala Wildlife Foundation and Conservancy (Mpala) in Laikipia, Kenya from a systems perspective. Mpala operates and manages a 48, 000 acre wildlife conservancy, working ranch (“the Ranch”), research center (“the Centre” or “MRC”), {{and a variety of}} community health and outreach programs in Laikipia, Kenya. Its objectives include preserving biodiversity of the region, supporting the natural migration of native species, providing research and learning opportunities for students, as well as sharing their findings regionally and internationally to contribute to the fields of science and sustainability. The purpose of this study for Mpala was to make recommendations to develop energy and water systems that are economically and environmentally sound, and can be maintained and functional for long into the future. We evaluated each system’s current state and examined potential solutions to the inefficiencies and shortfalls. The energy group evaluated the potential to reduce the Mpala’s dependence on fossil fuels, while the water group evaluated expanding rainwater catchment as a way to insure adequate water supply and reduce the Centre’s and Centre Village’s reliance on the non-replenishing aquifer and the intermittent river on site. Water The water portion of this study proposes a method of capturing and storing a safety stock of water for human consumption during seasonal rains and wet years to provide water during seasonal dry periods and drought years. The Mpala Ranch headquarters (“the Ranch”) was recently equipped with a land weir to supply all of the drinking water to the people that reside at the Ranch employee residences (“the Ranch Village”). Therefore, our team examined a solution for all of those residing and visiting the Centre (“the Centre Village” and “the Centre”). We demonstrate that the current rainwater catchment system at the Centre requires only additions and improvements to provide the current population of the Centre and the Centre Village essential water needs. We also make recommendations for expansion in the future. Our group recommends improving the catchment and filtration systems on the building roofs currently equipped to catch rain water, and expanding the current storage capacity with either underground storage or above ground storage. iv We began our study by evaluating current water systems. First we examined the borehole water system. We calculated that Mpala was drawing approximately 30 - 35 cubic meters of water from the borehole well each day. However, the measured draw at both the Centre and the Ranch added up, on average to a little over half that amount. Despite some expected measurement error {{on the part of the}} meters installed, we determined that it was likely the transport system of underground piping was experiencing leaks. The distance of transport (under miles of terrain) was a contributing factor of this inefficiency. At the Centre and the Ranch, the water was used for washrooms for the visitor’s quarters as well as for drinking. In order to drink the borehole water, it first had to be put through an expensive filtering system called Reverse Osmosis. Next we looked at their use of river water, which is drawn from the Ewaso Ngiro (river). This river began to run dry in 2009, the first time in known history. It has since run dry for a period of months each year. This could be due to the more severe droughts the region has been experiencing, but likely, it is from increased abstraction from upstream agriculture. The presence of this agriculture is also a concern for the quality of river water, as unsafe levels of nitrates may be found as a product of run-off from the agricultural land. This water has not been tested. The final source of water evaluated was the rainwater storage. The Centre has extensive storage tanks at many of the buildings at the Centre, and a few small tanks at the Centre Village. This is a great source of local water; however, the system is not being fully utilized. Our team witnessed water being poorly covered and invested with insects and debris. We also witnessed several birds on the rooftops, leaving dangerous waste that flowed into the tanks during a rain. In addition to these system issues, we also witnessed water running off the roofs and not being captured. This is unmet potential. After evaluating the sources of water, we looked into ways in which the Centre and the Ranch can reduce their water use levels. We recommended installing low flow fixtures in all of the washroom and shower facilities. This provided a water savings of 14 % of the total consumption at the Centre. Since the visitors were the only people that used these facilities, and they made up only 25 % of the total population at the Centre and Centre Village, the reduction in washroom consumption was reduced by half, but the overall impact was much smaller. The next system we looked at improving for water use reduction was grey water. Grey water is water that is recycled or reused from such uses as hand washing, bathing and cooking. Grey water can be used to irrigate landscape plants, flush toilets, and, also in the case at Mpala, supply a biogas v plant. This type of system, considering maximum capacity at the Centre, could provide these uses with 888 liters of water per day. The final suggestion made for reducing water use is to educate. By communicating the value of water conservancy with a campaign of signage and training, as well as regular education of the employees, their families and the visitors, water use can be reduced through behavior change. After recommending ways to reduce demand, our team looked at the best method of increasing supply. We identified rooftop rainwater collection as our focus for this study. We began by looking at historical rain data from 1999 - 2009. We identified levels of rain during the driest years, as well as levels of rain during those years with high rainfall. We also became familiar with the distinct seasonality of the rains at Mpala and the region. The next step was to look at total cumulative demand, and potential cumulative supply based on different levels of rainfall and varying percentages of available rooftop. There is 4255 m 3 of roof area when considering all of the built structures at both the Centre and the Centre Village. We assumed current population at the Centre Village, maximum occupancy at the Centre, and unlimited storage (we calculated cumulative run-off with the assumption we had no storage constraints and could capture all of the runoff). What we found was that in a wet year, there was enough water to provide essential water needs (eight liters/person/day) for all of the people at the Centre and Centre Village, and much to spare for a dry year. However, in a dry year, even when the maximum rooftops were used, there was not enough supply to meet demand or provide for a dry year. In addition, we were asked by Mpala management to consider future population growth. When modeling that variable, there simply would simply not be enough water to supply this area of Mpala. Once we completed that evaluation, we determined that we would design a rainwater catchment system that could provide the current population and make recommended additions for the future expected growth. We looked at their current rainwater catchment system. Currently, they have 1973 m 2 of rooftop area equipped with metal roofs, gutters systems and some form of water storage, sizes varying by building. We calculated, that in a wet year, characterized by heavy and above average rainfall, using only the rooftop area equipped to capture rain, the Centre was missing or not catching a volume as high as 444 m 3 or 444, 000 liters in a year. This takes into consideration daily draw of the essential water needs of the current population, just over 1000 liters per day. This volume missed was a function of insufficient vi storage for the current catchment systems. Therefore, we identified which buildings were missing the greatest amount of rainfall, sized the supplemental storage and determined where and how much additional storage needed to be built. Once that was complete, we turned our attention to their current catchment systems. A rainwater harvesting (RWH) system is comprised of six general components: a catchment <b>area</b> <b>or</b> <b>surface,</b> such as a roof; gutters or pipes as a conveyance system from the catchment area to the storage tank; a roof washer, to filter major contaminants; a storage container; a method for distributing the water from the tank; and a process of purification, if the water is intended for human consumption (Kinkade-Levario, 2007). We described each component of this RWH system and recommended specific products, providing costs as well. Once the RWH system was recommended, we evaluated two types of storage – the above ground system of tanks, an expansion of what currently exists at Mpala, and an underground storage tank. Increasing storage capacity from the current 187, 000 liters to over 600, 000 liters will have a much larger footprint. The underground, centralized tanks will require less space, less capital investment (~$ 20, 000 US) and more than adequate water for the Centre and Village; however, it is less secure, as contamination can destroy the entire supply. The belowground option also leaves potential above ground space for future additional above ground storage, as well as tie-in of new buildings. The above ground option can be phased in, making less of an upfront financial impact (which is estimated at a total of more than $ 50, 000 US), and spreading the risk of contamination out, so that if one tank loses its supply from contamination, the remainder is still secure. We leave it to the Mpala management to make a choice that best suits their immediate priorities. Energy-Water Nexus Our team briefly looked at two areas where renewable energy can be used to supply water for Mpala. We looked at a solar pump located at the borehole well and a solar thermal water heating system to provide hot showers for the visitors to the Centre. The solar pump needs to have specifications that allow it to pump 2. 5 cubic meters per hour and at a great vertical height because the aquifer head is currently 70 meters below ground and declining. The reduced borehole water use, a result of a grey water system and low flow fixtures at the Centre, comes to about 25 - 28 m 3 per day. Therefore a pump with the above specifications is required. However, the upfront cost (anywhere from $ 2, 000 to $ 6, 000) (Alibaba. com, 2011) is likely to vii have a payback period of less than two years up to six years due to costs savings accomplished by eliminating the need for the diesel-powered pump, as $ 1, 200 per year is saved from diesel use reductions. The solar thermal water heating system has an upfront capital investment of approximately $ 15, 000 US. These systems, 220 liter tanks with 2. 3 m 2 solar arrays would be placed on the rooftops of the buildings that provide hot showers to both the visitors and the Centre Director’s home. There is not money saved on diesel use reduction in this case, as the current system contains solar flat plate collectors (many in disrepair) and wood-burning stoves. What is saved is the health and environmental hazard of burning wood from the surrounding land to fuel the current heaters. Energy The energy portion of this report evaluated several options for Mpala’s electricity system now and in the future in an attempt to find sensible solutions that will provide inexpensive and long lasting power to Mpala. The Research Centre management hopes to provide the current visitor capacity with reliable and adequate energy service, as well as scale the system up to provide a larger number of guests in the future. Thus Mpala, with its new system should be able to support the entire additional load. For this reason, in all our analyses, we considered double the current power load at Mpala. The following is an outline of the approach we took to solve the issues at Mpala, and the steps we took to complete our analysis. The existing system at Mpala is an off-grid power system that is powered primarily by diesel generators and includes a small portion of solar PV and hydro-power. The Mpala Research Centre (MRC) itself meets its load with solar PV, two diesel generators and batteries, whereas the Ranch uses hydro power from a turbine, back-up generators and very little solar PV. There are many issues with the current system. In general, the power supply is intermittent and not sufficient to meet the entire load. The population at the Centre and the Ranch is expected to increase in the next few years due to the growing popularity of the Research Centre and Conservancy, The system is not well monitored and thus there are large amount of inefficiencies. At MRC, the generators consume diesel to power the entire area. This is especially problematic due to the growing prices of diesel. The batteries are also not managed to the optimal efficiency, and therefore have to be replaced from time to time. viii At the Ranch, the turbine is not consistently in working condition and will have to be replaced. Also, in recent years the Ewaso Ngiro river to which the turbine is fixed has been running dry for almost half the year. Our initial approach was to track down all the inefficiencies in the current system and as a first step we performed a thorough energy audit of the Ranch and Centre during our stay in Mpala. The results of the energy audit showed us the most energy consuming buildings and the most problematic areas in the system. Once the problem areas were spotted, we took a two pronged approach to solve the issues at Mpala, namely o Reduce power load - make the current system more efficient. o Renewable sources – use more renewable sources to meet the new, more efficient system with less power load. Our first approach was to analyze the consumption of energy by the existing lighting throughout the Centre. We evaluated different products available and found that LED light bulbs provided the most economic and energy efficient solution over time. For our second approach, we analyzed all of the renewable sources available at Mpala and picked only the ones that are most useful for Mpala’s electricity system. Among wind, hydro, solar and biogas, we concluded that everything except wind has great potential for the system at Mpala. The next step was to use these sources to meet the newly reduced load. To do this, we used a simulation software program namely HOMER to compare the various systems that could be made for Mpala with the renewable sources available at Mpala. HOMER stands for Hybrid Optimization of Electric Renewables and is a tool provided by National Renewable Energy Labs, Department of Energy of the United States. It is an excellent tool that can be used to analyze, simulate and optimize various combinations of off-grid hybrid renewable energy systems and is used all over the world. The scenarios explored and analyzed using HOMER could be broadly divided into those that use transmission lines, and those that are independent of transmission lines. With transmission lines, the scenarios explored include different hybrid systems which utilize several forms of renewable energy sources, as well as some diesel, that provide security and options for Mpala. While at first glance, the use of transmission lines appears to provide more stability and security to the system, we will show how this might not be the case for Mpala. Due to the ix extensive existence of wildlife at Mpala, which presents a risk to both the equipment and the animals, using underground transmission is the only viable option. However, using an underground transmission system can prove to be 5 - 10 times more expensive and more difficult to lay and maintain. According the Kenya Electricity Transmission Board, underground transmission lines also last only for half as long as compared to regular transmission lines. For Mpala, we estimate that these lines will have to be replaced at least eight times if laid underground over a period of 100 years. For our analysis however, we assumed that these lines will not be replaced and will last for all 100 years. Despite this assumption, the upfront costs and operational costs are high for a transmission system. The cost for transmission was calculated using a $ 20, 000 cost/km and the actual distance was found using UTM coordinates. We analyzed a total of six scenarios for both overhead and underground transmission. They are o All in one – uses all renewable sources and some diesel o Only Solar PV o Solar PV and backup generators o Only Hydropower o Hydropower and backup generators o Only Biogas Each of these scenarios was then compared to the existing system at Mpala. The results for each of these scenarios are indicated with error bars to account for the above stated assumption that transmission lines will not last for all 100 years without replacement. We next moved on to analyzing systems that do not use transmission. The most obvious sources for these being solar and biogas energy. The HOMER results for Solar and Biogas showed that Biogas is the cheaper option due to which a more detailed study of the Biogas system was performed. The biogas scenario was designed such that it will use a separate system for MRC and a separate system for the Ranch. Each of these systems will contain a biogas digester to process the dung to biogas and a generator to produce electricity from biogas. The dung is obtained from the ‘bomas’ at Mpala, the place where cattle are housed at night. This system will require the use of trucks to carry the dung from the boma to the MRC and Ranch generator sites. x Due to Mpala’s more than 2, 000 heads of cattle and six bomas, there is a large potential for biogas. From our analysis, we found that using just one boma could power the entire MRC and Ranch. A complete ‘use phase analysis’ was performed to estimate the total carbon dioxide emissions reduced in the process of using biogas as fuel. The major savings were from the elimination of diesel at MRC and from the diversion of dung from undergoing anaerobic digestion. Anaerobic digestion of dung will produce methane which according to the IPCC fourth assessment report, has a Global Warming Potential that is 25 times that of carbon dioxide when evaluated over a period of 100 years (Forster et al., 2007). Using biogas without transmission could provide very cheap electricity and the upfront costs (which are also low) could be recovered within 1. 5 years due to cheap operating costs. In the process, it will also have a total emissions savings that are as high as 15, 400 kg/year. If Mpala decides to power the villages also with biogas, these emission savings will greatly increase and thus Mpala could look into potential funding using the Clean Development Mechanism, but Mpala would need to create a development mechanism similar to what we discuss in our Behavior and Education section. However, CDM was outside the scope of our analysis and only briefly mentioned here. Our team will also discuss the costs and benefits of each of these systems and show how using scenarios that do not use transmission or considering other ways of energy storage can prove to be cheaper and more reliable for Mpala. The system, the existing or the new one, cannot function to its best ability if it is not understood by the people operating the system and by those who are benefiting from it. Education is thus a very important component of the new system to come. Education could be in the form of training local personnel to work the systems and teaching the people using the system to run their own. We have touched upon these options briefly and taken examples of some previous good work that we thought would be suitable for Mpala. This masters project group hopes this work can be used to improve the systems at Mpala, but also be considered as potential energy and water systems in surrounding communities in the region. Our goal was to propose the most feasible and affordable methods to provide selfsustaining, long-lasting resource systems in Kenya. ...|$|E

These methods, however, seem to be generally not capable of direct extension to the case where along the boundary there are prescribed either the differential coefficients or any relations between these and {{the values of the}} function.
