50|$|<b>Aluminium</b> <b>boride</b> is {{considered}} a hazardous substance as it reacts with acids and hydrogen gas to produce toxic gases. For example, it reacts with hydrochloric acid to release borane and aluminium chloride.|$|E
5000|$|Aluminium diboride (AlB2) is a {{chemical}} compound {{made from the}} metal aluminium and the metalloid boron. It {{is one of two}} compounds of aluminium and boron, the other being AlB12, which are both commonly referred to as <b>aluminium</b> <b>boride.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} inclusion types {{can also}} be found in aluminium alloys: alumina needles (Al2O3), nitrides (AlN), iron oxides (FeO), manganese oxides (MnO), fluorides (Na3AlF6, NaF, CaF2, …), <b>aluminium</b> <b>borides</b> (AlB2, AlB12), borocarbides (Al4C4B).|$|R
40|$|Boron-containing {{substances}} {{are known}} to have high gravimetric and volumetric heats of oxidation in comparison with any metals that make them promising for using in high-energy materials. This work is aimed to study ignition characteristics of ammonium perchlorate and nitrate-based composite solid propellants containing <b>aluminium</b> <b>borides</b> by means of radiative heating by CO 2 -laser. It was found that the effect upon laser ignition (ignitability) at full replacement of ASD- 4 aluminum powder by aluminium diboride and dodecaboride is close. The ignition time of HEM is reduced by 2. 0 – 2. 5 times compared with ASD- 4 HEM sample in the heat flux density range of 90 – 200 W/cm 2...|$|R
5000|$|Over {{the years}} newer and tougher {{composites}} have been developed, giving {{about five times}} the protection value of the original pure ceramics, the best of which were again about five times as effective as a steel plate of equal weight. These are often a mixture of several ceramic materials, or metal matrix composites which combine ceramic compounds within a metal matrix. The latest developments involve the use of carbon nanotubes to improve toughness even further. Commercially produced or researched ceramics for such type of armour include boron carbide, silicon carbide, aluminium oxide (sapphire or [...] "alumina"), <b>aluminium</b> nitride, titanium <b>boride</b> and Syndite, a synthetic diamond composite. Of these boron carbide is the hardest and lightest, but also the most expensive and brittle. Boron carbide composites are today favoured for ceramic plates protecting against smaller projectiles, such as used in body armour and armoured helicopters; this was in fact in the early sixties the first general application of ceramic armour. Silicon carbide, better suited to protect against larger projectiles, {{was at that time}} only used in some prototype land vehicles, such as the MBT-70. The ceramics can be created by pressureless sintering or hot pressing. A high density is required, so residual porosity must be minimised in the final part.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{formation}} of borides in an Al– 3 wt. % B alloy produced from reaction between aluminium and boron oxide (B 2 O 3) has been investigated. Melting and cooling experiments {{were carried out}} to explore the growth characteristics of <b>aluminium</b> <b>boride</b> crystals. During heating up to 1300 o C boron dissolved into molten aluminium and subsequently cooled to form solid aluminium borides in the aluminium matrix. At room temperature boride particles was identified as AlB 2. Although, AlB 12 phase is the first phase to form directly from the Al-B liquid above 1000 o C which transforms to stable AlB 2 crystals by a peritectic reaction during cooling. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques were employed. Results showed that the shape and distribution of the borides are dependent on the cooling conditions of the liquid Al-B alloy...|$|E
40|$|It is {{apparent}} that the concentrations of impurities in raw materials (particularly petroleum coke) are increasing with significant implications for melt quality {{and the ability of}} cast houses to meet customer chemical specifications. A large fraction of the metal content of the coke and alumina reports to the aluminium in the reduction cells. In some smelters the concentration of these impurities is beginning to exceed customer cast product specifications. Nickel and vanadium are of particular concern. These impurities can have detrimental effects in certain alloys, however for many systems it is not clear if the maximum specifications arise from known detrimental effects or are simply set from what was achievable historically. This paper recaps what is known about the effect of dissolved metals on alloy properties and discusses cast house and other management strategies along the value chain for coping with these changes. Options include; improved Bayer plant operations, segregated anode production, impurity removal during dry scrubber operations, melt treatment before casting to remove these impurities and adjustment of specifications following expensive property testing. <b>Aluminium</b> <b>boride</b> treatment can be used to remove vanadium however the process is slow and only used at present on electrical conductivity grade material. Some current work on the mechanisms of this process is examined to get a picture of the possibility of speeding up the process. Potential for development of a melt nickel removal process is considered and some preliminary results presented. The cost of establishing new specifications is examined. The need for an integrated strategy across the supply chain is highlighted...|$|E
