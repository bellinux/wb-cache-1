5|$|The {{original}} {{purpose of the}} Tribal Hidage remains unknown: many scholars {{believe that it was}} a tribute list created by a king, but other possibilities have been suggested. The hidage figures may be purely symbolic and merely reflect the prestige of each territory, or they may represent an early example of book-keeping. Many historians <b>are</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Tribal Hidage originated from Mercia, which dominated southern Anglo-Saxon England until the start of the 9th century, but others have argued that the text was Northumbrian in origin.|$|E
5|$|This {{theory is}} debatable; Hermann Alexander Schlögl, Wolfgang Helck, Peter Kaplony and Jochem Kahl {{argue that the}} clay seals were only found at the {{entrance}} area of Peribsen's tomb {{and none of them}} depict Peribsen and Sekhemib's names together in one inscription. Furthermore, they remark that it was customary for a pharaoh to bury and seal his predecessor's tomb; the presence of Sekhemib's seals show the line of dynastic inheritance. Similar inferences can be drawn from the ivory tablets of king Hotepsekhemwy found at the entrance of king Qa'a's tomb and the clay seals of Djoser found at the entrance of Khasekhemwy's tomb. Schlögl, Helck, Kaplony and Kahl <b>are</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> discovery of Sekhemib's seals support the view that Sekhemib immediately succeeded Peribsen and buried him.|$|E

500|$|Republican Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona {{proposed}} an amended bill that removed the commitment procedures in title I of the House bill {{and stated that}} [...] "Nothing in this title shall be construed to authorize the transfer to Alaska, pursuant to any agreement or otherwise, of any mentally ill person {{who is not a}} resident of Alaska." [...] In effect, this eliminated the bill's most controversial element—the provision for the transfer of mental patients from the lower 48 states to Alaska. The final recommendation of the Senate Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs followed Goldwater's lead that the bill be amended to strike all the controversial [...] "detailed provisions for commitment, hospitalization, and care of the mentally ill of Alaska" [...] included in title I of the original House bill. [...] This amended proposal left only the transfer of responsibility for mental health care to the territory of Alaska and the establishment of land grants to support this care. The committee stressed that they were not invalidating the title I provisions of the original bill but that they had been misunderstood, a recurrent theme in supporters of the bill:However, the proposed provisions were misunderstood by many persons in parts of the country other than Alaska. Partly {{as a result of this}} misunderstanding, but more because the members of the committee <b>are</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> people of Alaska are fully capable of drafting their own laws for a mental health program for Alaska, the committee concluded that authority should be vested in them in this field comparable to that of the States and other Territories.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{have argued}} that the Church in Rome {{introduced}} Candlemas celebrations in opposition to the Roman Pagan feast of Lupercalia. The Catholic Encyclopædia is definite in its rejection of this argument: [...] "The feast was certainly not introduced by Pope Gelasius to suppress the excesses of the Lupercalia," [...] (referencing J.P. Migne, Missale Gothicum, 691). The 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica agrees: the association with Gelasius [...] "has led some to suppose that it was ordained by Pope Gelasius I in 492 as a counter-attraction to the pagan Lupercalia; but for this there is no warrant." [...] Since the two festivals are both concerned with the ritual purification of women, not all historians <b>are</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> connection is purely coincidental. Gelasius certainly did write a treatise against Lupercalia, and this still exists; see Lupercalia.|$|E

Although he and Liu Kang are shown to be friends - much of the time - he constantly baits his fellow Shaolin monk, especially regarding Princess Kitana, and the tournament that [...] "Raiden" [...] (in reality, a disguised Shang Tsung) has sent them to compete in. A rivalry between the two Shaolin monks was hence established for the first time in Shaolin Monks. As the two fighters defeated Shang Tsung's warriors, they gained victories in Mortal Kombat, forming a race of sorts to become the Champion of Mortal Kombat. Kung Lao, especially, is seen gloating to Liu Kang that he will win this tournament.

2500|$|While {{orthodox}} classical revolutionary Marxist academics <b>are</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{statistical data}} show that profitability is falling, businessmen can often happily see their profits grow anyway, and have more real money in the bank. In theory they should have less money, but in practice they have more. That is because financial relationships between quantities of money (defined using a currency unit) can vary from the value proportions that exist between products or physical assets (defined {{in terms of the}} MELT, i.e. the monetary equivalent of labor time). If there is a significant drop in overall profitability, this will very likely also be reflected in data about the profit included in value-added, but that is only a rough indicator of the trend (the data quality may not be very great). Official statistics include in value-added only the net value of new production; if a business makes money simply from selling an asset it has, or from asset appreciation, this is not normally considered [...] "value-added", but property income. [...] If that was not the case, then any kind of business income (or just about any kind of income) would represent value-added. It does not.|$|E
2500|$|Known as Vlad the Impaler or Vlad III Dracula, he {{immediately}} {{put to death}} the boyars who had conspired against his father and was characterized as both a hero and a villain.

[...] Vlad fiercely resisted Ottoman rule, having both repelled the Ottomans and been pushed back several times. The Saxons were furious with him for strengthening the borders of Wallachia, which interfered with their stranglehold on the trade routes.

2500|$|When first {{ordering}} the pig cull, the Egyptian government asserted {{that it was}} a precaution to forestall national fears of the imminent pandemic. Later, after the pig cull, the government stated that its decision to order the pig cull was directly affected by the global breakout of H5N1 virus, more commonly known as bird flu, several years earlier and a fear that the two strains of viruses could possibly combine to form a more lethal virus. Later, the Egyptian government openly stated that the pig cull was no longer just an act to prevent swine flu; rather, {{it was part of a}} plan to clean up the Zabbaleen and allow them to live in sanitary conditions. According to Sabir Abdel Aziz Galal, chief of the infectious disease department in the Ministry of agriculture, [...] "We want them to live a better life. humanely treated; it's a very difficult life." [...] In contrast to the explanations officially given by the Egyptian government, many other observers, especially in the Western media, as well as the Zabbaleen themselves perceived a religious bias in the execution of the pig cull. In a New York Times article, Slackman asserted that, [...] "The Zabbaleen are Christians. Egypt is a majority Muslim country. The Zabbaleen <b>are</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> government wants to use the swine flu scare not to help improve their lives but to get pigs out of Egypt. Islam prohibits eating pork." [...] In another New york Times article, Audi writes, [...] "Most of Egypt's pig farmers are Christians, and some accuse the government of using swine flu fears to punish them economically." [...] According to Rev. Samaan Ibrahim, a priest from a Zabbaleen neighborhood, [...] "The bottom line is pigs are not welcome in Egypt." [...] In an article by the BBC, Fraser argues along a similar line, saying that the Coptic Christian minority were targeted by the government for a main source of their income, the rearing of pigs. A similar opinion is voiced by Engi Wassef in her documentary, Marina of the Zabbaleen. Fahmi and Sutton echo a similar explanation: [...] "The adverse effect of the slaughtering of the pigs on the Zabbaleen's livelihoods might be part of the ongoing gentrification of garbage city for land speculations and the taking over of their recycling economy by entrepreneurial businesses." ...|$|E
