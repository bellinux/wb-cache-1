5|$|As I {{was reading}} about Cope and Marsh, I ran across Knight as {{something}} of a bit player in their lives. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> further into the Cope and Marsh story, and I liked the two less and less as people—which is different from liking them as characters, of course—I wanted to have a character in the book for the readers to root for, and neither of the scientists could fill that role. When I found out that Knight had met Cope just before Cope died, I became convinced that he was the character I needed.|$|E

Because you don't realize how you're going to feel until you're put in that situation. I had the tears in my eyes and got kinda nervous. But <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> into it, I realized it was work, it was a job. I had to vocally conduct a legend." [...] Harris commented on the single, [...] "He's showing you, I'm still the Michael Jackson that did 'Billie Jean' and 'Rock With You' because 'Butterflies' really falls along those lines." ...|$|E

The idea in my mind was [...] "one big tragedy may save many others". I realised that my best means of carrying out my purpose was the iron staircase. When a good moment came, quite deliberately I walked upstairs and threw myself from the top, as I meant, {{on to the}} iron staircase. If I had been successful I should undoubtedly have been killed, {{as it was a}} clear drop of 30 to 40 feet. But I caught {{on the edge of the}} netting. I then threw myself forward on my head with all my might.|$|E

500|$|Deveau {{returned}} to report these findings to Morehouse, {{who decided to}} bring the derelict into Gibraltar, [...] away. Under maritime law, a salvor could expect a substantial share of the combined value of rescued vessel and cargo, the exact award depending {{on the degree of}} danger inherent in the salvaging. Morehouse divided Dei Gratias crew of eight between the two vessels, sending Deveau and two experienced seamen to Mary Celeste, while he and four others remained on Dei Gratia. The weather was relatively calm for most of the way to Gibraltar, but with each ship seriously undermanned, progress was slow. Dei Gratia reached Gibraltar on December 12, 1872, and Mary Celeste, which had encountered fog, arrived on the following morning. She was immediately impounded by the vice admiralty court, preparatory to salvage hearings. Deveau wrote to his wife that the ordeal of bringing the ship in was such that [...] "I can hardly tell what I am made of, but I do not care so long <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> in safe. I shall be well paid for the Mary Celeste." ...|$|E

2500|$|Performing in Westerns was {{a return}} {{to what he had}} done earlier in his career, and McCrea enjoyed the genre. [...] In a 1978 interview, he said: I liked doing comedies, but <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> older I was better suited to do Westerns. Because I think it becomes un{{attractive}} for an older fellow trying to look young, falling in love with attractive girls in those kinds of situations...Anyway, I always felt so much more comfortable in the Western.

2500|$|Cinemation's {{advertising}} {{style and}} the film's rating led many to believe that Fritz the Cat was a pornographic film. When it was introduced as such at a showing at the University of Southern California, Bakshi stated firmly, [...] "Fritz the Cat is not pornographic." [...] In May 1972, Variety reported that Krantz had appealed the X rating, saying [...] "Animals having sex isn't pornography." [...] The MPAA refused to hear the appeal. The misconceptions about the film's content were eventually cleared up when it received praise from Rolling Stone and The New York Times, and the film was accepted into the 1972 Cannes Film Festival. Bakshi later stated, [...] "Now they do as much on The Simpsons <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> an X rating for Fritz the Cat." ...|$|E

I didn't want to continue with the hard work batik required – boiling the fabric over and over, lighting fires, and using up all the soap powder, over and over. That's why I gave up batik and changed over to canvas – it was easier. My eyesight deteriorated <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> older, and because of that I gave up batik on silk – it was better for me to just paint.|$|E

[...] McNief called the police from Ochsenbein's Grocery Store. Runnels investigated, with Deputy Sheriff Z. C. Henslee and {{officers}} Pete Carrara and Bill Bagwell. The music case {{was placed in a}} paste board box and returned to Chief Runnels's office. The saxophone was tarnished and the leather case's bottom and lining had deteriorated enough that pieces fell to the ground as it was placed in the box. A Texas High School emblem was also in the case, as well as sheet music for [...] "The Song of the Navy", probably played at the dance on the night of Booker's death.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1967 Allen {{had told}} Go-Set: [...] "I {{realized}} just a three piece group couldn't {{give me the}} sound I wanted, so I added two girl vocalists, [...] and , they are an act in themselves and combined {{to give us a}} distinctive sound which can't be done by any Australian group". As a member of the Laurie Allen Revue, Hewett was recorded on three singles, [...] "Beautiful Brown Eyes" [...] (August 1967), [...] "Any Little Bit" [...] (April 1968) and [...] "As Long <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>Got</b> You" [...] (June). By mid-1968 Hewett had joined Ian Saxon and the Sound, with Saxon on lead vocals; Geoff Oakes on saxophone; Graeme Trottman on drums. In 1969 Hewett left the group and was replaced on vocals by Marlene Richards (ex-Ivan Dayman Band) before the group recorded their debut single, [...] "Home Cookin'" [...] (1970).|$|E
2500|$|Bianca and Babe's {{friendship}} {{became popular}} with viewers while both characters were pregnant. The relationship {{was described as}} a [...] "beautiful friendship" [...] by Soap Opera Digest. Within the series, when the two give birth to their children on the same night (Bianca to Miranda and Babe to Little Adam), their bond further endeared them to the audience. Of the birth scenes, actress Eden Riegel, Bianca's portrayer, stated, [...] "I had done so much research. I read books [...] What to Expect When You're Expecting. I watched the TLC series A Baby Story. It felt like I watched hundreds of episodes! As soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> home I'd be watching women give birth on TV." [...] Riegel added that one of her makeup artists was pregnant and invited her to go along to a Lamaze class. She sat in a room [...] "full of pregnant Upper West Siders" [...] and practiced breathing exercises.|$|E

2500|$|DeLonge {{first began}} skateboarding {{in the third}} grade, which would consume much his {{activity}} outside of school. [...] "I lived, ate, and breathed skateboarding. All I did all day long was skateboard. It was all I cared about," [...] he later remarked. He and friends would begin at one side of San Diego and attempt to skateboard to the other half, intermittently pulling pranks on people in the process. As such, he was an average student: [...] "I knew exactly how hard I had to work in school. As long <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> that C, I wouldn't try one minute extra to get a B. I just cared about skateboarding and music." [...] His parents were constantly fighting in his formative years, culminating in a divorce when DeLonge was 18. [...] Shortly thereafter, his mother lost her job. DeLonge promptly moved out, feeling as though he needed to start his life. His brother was also away {{at that time in}} the United States Army, and his departure affected his family. [...] "My mom and sister were left asking, 'What happened to our family?'".|$|E
2500|$|Producers later made {{a series}} of changes to Grace's characterisation. Her style changed and they {{introduced}} a new hairstyle, which has been described as an [...] "enormous bouffant hair-do". Wall was happy with the changes because it helped develop Grace. She told an Inside Soap reporter that [...] "as soon <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> this big hair, I felt the character get bigger. She strutted about more, and it brought a bit of comedy to her." [...] The actress has admitted that it took time for her make-up team to perfect Grace's look. She was unhappy with Grace's shot in the Hollyoaks opening title sequence because the hair was not big enough. But over time she began to leave the make-up department with almost square hair as it grew. Wall is supplied with an additional hair piece which is applied to her head each morning. It takes the make-up department two hours daily to wash, dress and curl it and an additional forty minutes to style it onto Wall's head. Grace's hair is very big and is often seen with differing styles, but always with plenty of volume in the roots to achieve her signature look. The hair style became known as [...] "Beryl Bouffant" [...] on the Hollyoaks set. The hair got so big that directors would sometimes complain that it was blocking views of other characters during filming.|$|E
2500|$|In {{discussing}} {{adapting the}} Boris Pasternak novel for television, screenwriter Andrew Davies revealed {{the task was}} [...] "daunting because the book is reckoned to be a masterpiece and the film is a great movie and one that I admire very much. Robert Bolt is the king of epic screenplay writers in my book. But <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> further into the book I kept thinking that I didn't agree with Robert Bolt about how to tell the story... and I began to feel much more excited." [...] He added, [...] "It was also a relief to find {{so much in the}} book that hadn't found its way into the first movie and could make great drama.... I thought the film does the spectacle really well. Rather surprisingly, it also explains the politics very well, but I thought it could do a better job on the relationships. It's probably a bit controversial, but I thought we could say more about Lara and Yuri and how they get together; about Lara's extraordinary situation {{at the beginning of the}} story and Yuri having a dreadful start to his life with his parents dying. None of these things really came out in the movie, but they are there in the book. I think that if they look at both versions now, people will probably think that this version in a lot of ways works better for our time. It's more contemporary. I think they'll find the performances are more subtle yet speak to us in our time. Maybe my script will seem out of date in 20 years time because a lot of them do, but watching the original film, I think the central performances look stilted and dated now." ...|$|E
