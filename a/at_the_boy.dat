25|$|It is {{possible}} Roosevelt {{was exposed to}} an infectious agent <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Boy</b> Scout Jamboree in late July. However, the two-week interval {{before the onset of}} his neurological illness was in keeping with both the incubation period of poliomyelitis, and with exposure to an infectious agent leading to GBS. There are no reports that any scouts or personnel at the camp were ill around the time of Roosevelt’s visit. In 1912 and 1915, Roosevelt had illnesses compatible with Campylobacter jejuni, a major causative agent of GBS.|$|E

500|$|... "The Little Drummer Boy", {{based on}} an ancient Czech folksong, was written by Katherine K. Davis in 1957. [...] The song tells the {{apocryphal}} story of a poor young boy who, unable to afford a gift for the infant Jesus, plays his drum with Mary's approval. The baby smiles <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> in gratitude. The 1958 version by the Harry Simeone Chorale is the standard, and hit the unparalleled record of placing in the Top 40 for five straight Christmases in a row. Simeone recorded the song in a Greenwich Village cathedral {{to give it a}} hushed respect. Its highest position on both the US and UK charts was #13.|$|E

They were aiming <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy,</b> and that is what surprised me, yes, because they were shooting at him, not only one time, but many times."

500|$|Some deceptions {{may take}} many months to unravel, {{such as a}} case that lasted over a year {{involving}} a 15-year-old boy participating in an online support group for people enduring debilitating migraine headaches. Some of the group's members had been on disability pension or gone through drug regimens for years to no avail. The boy represented his mother as deaf and his father as an alcoholic, and he reported seizures and hemophilia as complicating conditions. [...] However, he also {{claimed to be a}} medical student who performed as a drummer in a band. Resources of the forum became constantly directed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy,</b> especially when some members expressed doubt about his story. The boy's mother—previously noted by him to be neglectful—logged on to post that questions about his conditions would worsen them; when they did not cease, he left the group, saying the atmosphere violated [...] "the spirit of the internet".|$|E

500|$|In 2006, {{pursuant}} {{to a class}} assignment, Cho wrote a short one-act play entitled Richard McBeef. The play focuses on John, a thirteen-year-old boy whose father has died in a boating accident, and John's stepfather, ex-football player Richard McBeef (whom John constantly refers to as [...] "Dick"). When Richard touches John's lap during an attempt at a 'father-to-son' talk, the boy abruptly claims that his stepfather is molesting him. John then accuses his stepfather of having murdered his biological father and repeatedly says that he will kill Richard. John, Richard and Sue (John's mother) are suddenly embroiled in a major argument. Richard then retreats to his car to escape the conflict, but John, despite claiming repeatedly that Richard is abusing him, joins his stepfather {{in the car and}} harasses him. The play ends with John trying to shove a banana-flavored cereal bar into his stepfather's throat; Richard, hitherto a passive character, reacts [...] "out of sheer desecrated hurt and anger" [...] by [...] "swinging a deadly blow" [...] <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy.</b>|$|E
500|$|In 1909, Chicago {{publisher}} W. D. Boyce {{was visiting}} London, where he encountered {{a boy who}} {{came to be known}} as the Unknown Scout. Boyce was lost on a foggy street when an unknown Scout came to his aid, guiding him to his destination. The boy then refused Boyce's tip, explaining that he was a Boy Scout and was merely doing his daily good turn. Interested in the Boy Scouts, Boyce met with staff <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Boy</b> Scouts Headquarters and, by some accounts, Baden-Powell. Upon his return to the US, Boyce incorporated the Boy Scouts of America on February 8, 1910. Edgar M. Robinson and Lee F. Hanmer became interested in the nascent BSA and convinced Boyce to turn the program over to the YMCA for development in April 1910. Robinson enlisted Seton, Beard, Charles Eastman, and other prominent leaders in the early youth movements. Former president Theodore Roosevelt, who had long complained of the decline in American manhood, became an ardent supporter. [...] In January 1911, Robinson turned the movement over to James E. West who became the first Chief Scout Executive and Scouting began to expand in the US ...|$|E

I wasn't far away, maybe from them [...] face to face about 15 meters, 17 meters. But the father didn't succeed to get the ambulance by waving to them. He looked at me and he said, [...] "Help me."

The scheme was given a publicity launch <b>at</b> <b>The</b> <b>Boy</b> Scouts Association's Imperial Headquarters in Buckingham Palace Road, Westminster, on Saturday 24 June 1916. [...] Baden-Powell wrote a new book, The Wolf Cub's Handbook, the first edition of which was published in December 1916. He collaborated with Vera Barclay in devising the Wolf Cub training programme and badges, which were published in the second edition. On 16 December 1916, a public display of the new section was held at Caxton Hall, Westminster, to which Kipling was invited; he was unable to attend but sent Baden-Powell a letter of apology, praising his work with the Scout Movement.|$|E
