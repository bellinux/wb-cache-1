5|$|Early {{vehicles}} were {{built by a}} number of independent companies, but in 1844 the railway started to build carriages at Swindon railway works, which eventually provided most of the railway's rolling stock. Special vehicles included sleeping cars, restaurant cars <b>and</b> <b>slip</b> coaches. Passengers were also carried in railmotors, autotrains, and diesel railcars. Passenger-rated vans carried parcels, horses, and milk at express speeds. Representative examples of these carriages survive in service today on various Heritage railways up and down the country.|$|E
5|$|West Branch Fishing Creek {{begins in}} Pennsylvania State Game Lands Number 13 and southwestern Davidson Township, Sullivan County on Huckleberry Mountain. It flows northeast, almost {{immediately}} entering a valley. It soon {{picks up the}} tributaries Swanks Run <b>and</b> <b>Slip</b> Run from the left and turns southeast, its valley becoming progressively deeper. The creek continues southeast, flowing between Huckleberry Mountain and North Mountain. It picks up two more tributaries from the left and then picks up its first tributary from the right, Shingle Mill Run. Shortly afterwards, the creek turns east and begins receiving unnamed tributaries from both sides. After a few miles, Painter Run flows into the creek. The creek exits Davidson Township and Sullivan County shortly downstream.|$|E
5|$|The 2012 {{was one of}} two {{contrasting}} halves for the Highlanders. The {{team won}} their first four matches — against the Chiefs, Crusaders, Waratahs, and Hurricanes. By that point the Highlanders were {{on the top of the}} table, but lost the position after losing to the Brumbies in Canberra. After a win over the Rebels, loss to the Stormers, and a bye, the Highlanders defeated the Blues 30–27 in Dunedin. They narrowly defeated the Cheetahs in Bloemfontein in round 10; they then stood fifth in the table. The team went on to lose five of their seven remaining matches, <b>and</b> <b>slip</b> to ninth on the table after the end of the regular season. Despite winning more matches than in 2011, the Highlanders finished fourth in the New Zealand conference — with only the Blues below them.|$|E

5|$|The {{shape of}} the dune depends on the {{characteristics}} of the prevailing wind. Barchan dunes are produced by strong winds blowing across a level surface, and are crescent-shaped with the concave side away from the wind. When there are two directions from which winds regularly blow, a series of long, linear dunes known as seif dunes may form. These also occur parallel to a strong wind that blows in one general direction. Transverse dunes run at a right angle to the prevailing wind direction. Star dunes are formed by variable winds, and have several ridges <b>and</b> <b>slip</b> faces radiating from a central point. They tend to grow vertically; they can reach a height of , making them the tallest type of dune. Rounded mounds of sand without a slip face are the rare dome dunes, found on the upwind edges of sand seas.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of sources of uncertainty, such as {{insufficient}} knowledge of fault geometry (especially at depth) <b>and</b> <b>slip</b> rates, and there is considerable challenge in how to balance the various elements of the model to achieve the best fit with the available observations. For example, there is difficulty fitting paleoseismic data <b>and</b> <b>slip</b> rates on the southern San Andreas Fault, resulting in estimates of seismicity that run about 25% less than seen in the paleoseismic data. The data does fit if a certain constraint (the regional Magnitude-Frequency Distribution) is relaxed, but this brings back the problem over-predicting moderate events.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} robust {{tracking}} controller {{based on a}} Generalized Extended State Observer (GESO) method for a wheeled mobile robot (WMR) with unknown skidding <b>and</b> <b>slipping.</b> Skidding <b>and</b> <b>slipping</b> of a WMR are inevitable in practice. We regard skidding <b>and</b> <b>slipping</b> as disturbances <b>and</b> modify the dynamics model to consider them simply. Then, we adopt the GESO to design a robust tracking controller at kinematic and dynamic level. Using Lyapunov theory, we derive the control law and guarantee {{the stability of the}} control system. The proposed control achieves attenuation of the disturbance and convergence of the tracking errors. The performance of the proposed method is verified by some simulation results...|$|R

25|$|As an option, {{an active}} limited slip {{differential}} was available instead of the standard viscous LSD. This new unit locked the rear differential if it detected that traction was lost {{by one of the}} wheels. A light on the dash also lit up if the LSD engaged. Active LSD came standard on all V-Spec R33 GT-R Skylines and was also available on some ECR33 GTS-25t models; these can be identified by the A-LSD <b>and</b> <b>SLIP</b> lights on the tachometer.|$|E

25|$|Note: {{the above}} all {{function}} like 2WD when multi-plate clutch coupling is not engaged (with exception of Subaru models), and like 4WD highrange in a part-time 4WD system when the clutch is engaged (usually by computer although some allow manual control). Some {{in this category}} have varying degrees of control in the torque distribution between front and rear by allowing some of the clutches in a multi-plate clutch coupling to engage <b>and</b> <b>slip</b> varying amounts. An example of a system like this is the BorgWarner i-Trac(TM) system.|$|E
25|$|These instabilities may {{be caused}} by the {{decrease}} of the friction force with an increasing velocity of sliding, by material expansion due to heat generation during friction (the thermo-elastic instabilities), or by pure dynamic effects of sliding of two elastic materials (the Adams-Martins instabilities). The latter were originally discovered in 1995 by George G. Adams and João Arménio Correia Martins for smooth surfaces and were later found in periodic rough surfaces. In particular, friction-related dynamical instabilities are thought to be responsible for brake squeal and the 'song' of a glass harp, phenomena which involve stick <b>and</b> <b>slip,</b> modelled as a drop of friction coefficient with velocity.|$|E
25|$|Pre-Hispanic vessels {{were shaped}} by modeling, coiling or molding. Except for a proto wheel {{used by the}} Zapotecs, the potter's wheel was unknown until the Spanish Conquest. Simple pinch pots or coiled pots were usually made by the family, with larger molded pieces made by craftsmen. The {{earliest}} molded pieces were simply clay pressed against a pre-existing bowl, but double molds <b>and</b> <b>slip</b> casting came {{to be used to}} make bowls with relief decorations. Famous examples of this type exist in Tlaxcala and Puebla states. Many figurines were also made using molds. Sometimes vessels were made with several molded pieces with the upper part finished by coiling.|$|E

25|$|One {{week later}} Trout {{launched}} two torpedoes {{at what she}} {{thought to be a}} tanker as it emerged from a rain squall. The first torpedo blew off the target's bow but the second was a dud. As the enemy ship was still steaming at eight knots, the submarine surfaced for battle with her deck guns. Trout opened fire, but soon seven of her men were wounded by enemy machine gun fire. She then swung around and fired a stern torpedo and watched Hirotama Maru turn her stern straight up with her screws still turning <b>and</b> <b>slip</b> under the waves. The patrol ended when the submarine returned to Fremantle on 25 February 1943.|$|E
25|$|The swim leg usually {{proceeds}} {{around a}} series of marked buoys before athletes exit the water near the transition area. Racers exit out of the water, enter the transition area, and change from their swim gear and into their cycling gear. Competition and pressure for faster times {{have led to the}} development of specialized triathlon clothing that is adequate for both swimming and cycling, allowing many racers to have a transition that consists of only removing their wetsuit, cap, and goggles and pulling on a helmet and cycling shoes. In some cases, racers leave their cycling shoes attached to their bicycle pedals <b>and</b> <b>slip</b> their feet into them while riding. Some triathletes don't wear socks, decreasing their time spent in transition even more.|$|E
25|$|On June 25, 1946, a fire wrecked the {{terminal}} at Saint George killing three people and causing damage worth $22,000,000. The fire destroyed the ferry terminal {{and the four}} slips used for Manhattan service, {{the terminal}} for Staten Island Rapid Transit trains, and a small building <b>and</b> <b>slip</b> owned by the city and used by the Army and Navy in transporting their men from Staten Island to the United States Naval Depot at Bayonne, New Jersey. Twenty rail cars were destroyed {{as a result of}} the fire. Two days after the fire, the city voted $3,000,000 to start work on building a new $12,000,000 terminal that would be opened in 1948.
