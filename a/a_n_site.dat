30|$|To {{quantify}} the atomic column positions, we used nonlinear least squares {{to fit the}} peak positions using a complex, two-dimensional elliptic Gaussian function. For the Si-N dumbbells, two complex elliptic Gaussian functions are fitted simultaneously. The fitted peak positions relative to the ideal Si_ 3 N_ 4 lattice positions for a subset of 180 of the peaks are plotted in Fig.  5 b, c from the exit waves before and after aberration correction. From the root-mean-square (RMS) displacements plotted, {{we see that the}} aberration correction has improved the fitting precision on most of the lattice sites. In particular, the dumbbells with strongly-overlapping peak functions have improved substantially, reaching peak precisions as low as 1.1 and 1.4 pm for the Si and N sites respectively. The isolated 2 <b>a</b> <b>N</b> <b>site</b> position precision is not strongly affected by the residual aberrations.|$|E
30|$|Returning to the {{original}} question of measuring atomic shifts due to the doping, we have plotted the bond length distributions of all nearest-neighbor sites that are more than 2 unit cells distance from the vacuum edge and {{the edge of the}} full micrograph, in Fig.  5 d, e. Before aberration correction, the bond length distribution for the dumbbell Si-N and the 2 <b>a</b> <b>N</b> <b>site</b> –Si bonds appears to follow a bimodal distribution. The larger Si-N bond spacing in the hexagonal rings is even more distorted, spreading over approximately 50 pm. However after correcting the residual aberrations, all bond length distributions become monomodal. Therefore we found no evidence of systematic shifts in the 2 a N sites. Additionally, no local distortions of the -Si_ 3 N_ 4 lattice such as those described in [39] were observed in this experiments. Finally, we note that because the reference lattice contains 14 site locations in each unit cell where measurements are taken, {{it is highly unlikely that}} we could be forcing one of the sites (such as a systematic 2 a distortion) to be at an incorrect location. The algorithm should select the phase plate function which best minimizes the global aberrations.|$|E

Atomic configurations and formation energies of native defects in an unsaturated GaN nanowire grown along the [001] direction and with (100) lateral facets are studied using large-scale ab initio calculation. Cation and anion vacancies, antisites, and interstitials in the neutral charge state are all considered. The configurations of these defects in the core region and outermost surface region of the nanowire are different. The atomic configurations of the defects in the core region are same {{as those in the}} bulk GaN, and the formation energy is large. The defects at the surface show different atomic configurations with low formation energy. Starting from a Ga vacancy {{at the edge of the}} side plane of the nanowire, a N-N split interstitial is formed after relaxation. As <b>a</b> <b>N</b> <b>site</b> is replaced by a Ga atom in the suboutermost layer, the Ga atom will be expelled out of the outermost layers and leaves a vacancy at the original N site. The Ga interstitial at the outmost surface will diffuse out by interstitialcy mechanism. For all the tested cases N-N split interstitials are easily formed with low formation energy in the nanowires, indicating N- 2 molecular will appear in the GaN nanowire, which agrees well with experimental findings...|$|E

Our methodology design is a theoretical and descriptive one, carried out in a secondary school during the 2009 / 2010 school year, in order to answer the question "How to improve the engagement of K- 12 students in chemistry classes?". Students, gathered in small groups were asked to create digital learning resources (DLR) during classes.
