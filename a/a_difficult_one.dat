5|$|Clinical {{social worker}} Catherine Black (Megan Gallagher) aids a family {{as they come}} to terms with the incestuous abuse they have {{suffered}} for decades. However, the father who is responsible still commands respect and political connections in the area, making the case <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>one.</b>|$|E
5|$|Promoted to brigadier in 1928, Burgess became Commandant of the New Zealand Military Forces, a {{position}} {{now known as}} the Chief of Army, in 1931 for a four-year term. The country's economic difficulties made his appointment <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>one.</b> The depression had resulted in New Zealand's compulsory military training scheme being abolished and the Territorial Force needed to be reorganised accordingly.|$|E
5|$|Dermide {{was born}} on 20 April 1798, in Milan, which was then part of the Cisalpine Republic, a puppet state of the First French Republic. He {{was the first and}} only child of his parents, Maria Paola di Buonaparte (known as Pauline) and Charles Victoire Emmanuel Leclerc, a general in the French Army. Dermide's birth was <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>one,</b> and its effects would be visible in Pauline's health for many years. He was christened Dermide Louis Napoléon, after a {{character}} in the epic Gaelic poems of Ossian, at the request of his uncle, general Napoleon Bonaparte, who greatly admired Ossian's works.|$|E

5|$|Shea's {{relationship}} with the engineers at North American was <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>one.</b> While Shea blamed North American's management for the continuing difficulties {{in the development of}} the command module, project leader Harrison Storms felt that NASA itself was far from blameless. It had delayed in making key design decisions, and persisted in making significant changes to the design once construction had begun. While Shea did his part in attempting to control the change requests, Storms felt that he did not understand or sympathize with the inevitable problems involved in the day-to-day work of manufacturing.|$|E
5|$|Lay {{pleaded not}} guilty to the eleven {{criminal}} charges, and claimed that he was misled by those around him. He attributed the main cause for the company's demise to Fastow. Lay was convicted of all six counts of securities and wire fraud for which he had been tried, and he was subject to a maximum total sentence of 45 years in prison. However, before sentencing was scheduled, Lay died on July 5, 2006. At the time of his death, the SEC had been seeking more than $90 million from Lay in addition to civil fines. The case of Lay's wife, Linda, is <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>one.</b> She sold roughly 500,000 shares of Enron ten minutes to thirty minutes before the information that Enron was collapsing went public on November 28, 2001. Linda was never charged with any of the events related to Enron.|$|E
5|$|The Flames re-signed Conroy {{to a new}} {{contract}} prior to the 2008–09 season and named him an alternate captain. He scored his 500th career point on January 3, 2009, when he assisted on Todd Bertuzzi's game-winning goal in a 3–2 win against the Nashville Predators, and finished the year with 48 points. The 2009–10 season proved <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>one</b> for Conroy, as he scored only three goals and 12 assists during a season shortened by wrist and knee injures along with a broken foot. He returned for another season as the Flames re-signed him to a one-year, two-way contract for the League minimum of $500,000. At the age of 39 years, Conroy played his 1,000th NHL game, against the Colorado Avalanche, on October 28, 2010. Only Grant Ledyard was older (age 40) when he reached that milestone.|$|E

5|$|Smith {{resumed his}} {{football}} career {{back at home}} with Keighley Central Club. A goalkeeper, he was still playing for Keighley Central in 1948 when he was offered a trial with his local Football League side Bradford City, {{who were at the}} time in the Third Division North. His trial was unsuccessful and he was released. Instead, Smith joined Lancashire Combination League side Nelson. He was still living in Keighley, and travelled to Nelson by bus with his brother Jack, who had previously played for Leeds United but had been released when Major Frank Buckley took over as manager and instead also joined Nelson. Smith played for Nelson for three years {{at a time when the}} club were competing at the top of the Lancashire Combination and sought re-election back into the Football League. However, Smith initially gave up the game when Nelson could no longer afford to pay him. He was not long out of the game before he signed Rossendale United, a member of the Lancashire Combination's Second Division. Smith said the journey by bus was <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>one</b> so he bought a motorbike. However, like Nelson, Rossendale could not afford to pay him, and after another two years, Smith gave up the game once again.|$|E

He also became the Ring Magazine's number one ranked pound-for-pound fighter.|$|E
25|$|The {{captaincy}} {{period was}} on the whole <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>one</b> for him as it was mired with reports of differences with Gavaskar, {{as well as his}} own inconsistent form as a bowler. However, both men have since insisted that these reports were exaggerated. Above all the controversy, Kapil's performance was better when he was the Captain, than as a player underline that, he enjoyed and suited captaincy.|$|E

25|$|The {{first decade}} of the {{settlement}} on the Derwent River was <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>one.</b> Its geographic isolation, even from the other Australian settlement at Sydney, soon became apparent, and led to an air of despondency.

25|$|Generally, {{claims that}} have {{defaulted}} {{under state law}} may not be granted federal habeas corpus review unless the petitioner provides a sufficient explanation for the default and demonstrates that the asserted error prejudiced his or her trial (that is, the error caused a different outcome).

25|$|At {{the end of}} the 2007 season, Rankin {{turned down}} a new {{contract}} with Derbyshire in favour of a two-year contract with Warwickshire. Rankin explained his choice as <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>one,</b> but the opportunity of working with Allan Donald was too good to miss. He was contracted to play in the controversial Indian Cricket League for the Kolkata Tigers; fellow Irishman, Niall O'Brien also participated in the tournament.|$|E

25|$|He was President of the MCC for 2010–11, a rare honour for a journalist.

This led to an as yet unresolved split in the membership between those in favour of the new plan and those who still support the old one.|$|E
25|$|Catherine became {{pregnant}} and miscarried {{at least three}} times, and during a severe illness in 1663, she imagined, for a time, that she had given birth. Charles comforted her by telling her she had indeed given birth to two sons and a daughter. Her position was <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>one,</b> and though Charles continued to have children by his many mistresses, he insisted she be treated with respect, and sided with her against his mistresses when he felt she was not receiving the respect she was due.|$|E
25|$|This case tho' {{depending}} upon a practice not common {{in this country}} is by no means <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>one.</b> I have no doubt but that the error complained of might have been corrected by the same court upon motion, at a subsequent term; but I should not for that reason reverse the judgment, since the party having preferred a writ of error coram vobis had a right to proceed in that way, tho' a shorter, and much less expensive mode might have been pursued.|$|E

The arrival of Van der Vaart's countryman Huub Stevens as head coach, however, saw Hamburg march up the standings and they finished the season in a respectable seventh place, qualifying for, and also winning, the Intertoto Cup.|$|E
25|$|Loren Dean Jovicic {{was born}} in Las Vegas, Nevada. His mother worked as a family and {{marriage}} counselor, and his {{father was in the}} clothing business. His parents divorced when he was a small child. His mother won custody of Loren, and the family moved to Los Angeles, California. When visiting his father, the two often went to the movies—which Dean says led to his love of film. His childhood was <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>one,</b> and he ran away from home when he was 16 years old. He graduated from Santa Monica High School in Santa Monica, California, in 1986.|$|E
25|$|Many real {{dynamical}} {{systems do}} not exactly fit this model. In fact, unmodelled dynamics can seriously degrade the filter performance, {{even when it}} was supposed to work with unknown stochastic signals as inputs. The {{reason for this is that}} the effect of unmodelled dynamics depends on the input, and, therefore, can bring the estimation algorithm to instability (it diverges). On the other hand, independent white noise signals will not make the algorithm diverge. The problem of distinguishing between measurement noise and unmodelled dynamics is <b>a</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>one</b> and is treated in control theory under the framework of robust control.|$|E
