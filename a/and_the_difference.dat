5|$|Compartment {{syndrome}} is a clinical diagnosis, i.e., no diagnostic test conclusively proves its presence or absence, but direct {{measurement of the}} pressure in a fascial compartment, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> between this pressure and the blood pressure, {{may be used to}} assess its severity. High pressures in the compartment and a small difference between compartment pressure and blood pressure indicate that the blood supply is likely to be insufficient, and that surgical intervention may be needed.|$|E

5|$|At home {{in front}} of 75,321 fans, the Giants played the Washington Redskins in Week 8. Each team totaled 16 first downs, four punts and five penalties, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> in time of {{possession}} was less than one minute. However, the Giants committed no turnovers while coercing three from the Redskins. Giants cornerback Everson Walls intercepted two passes—including one that he returned for his first career touchdown—and free safety Greg Jackson intercepted another. Walls' interception set up a Giants touchdown and a 14–0 lead in the second quarter. Jackson then intercepted a pass {{in the end zone}} in the third quarter to preserve a 14–10 lead, and Walls returned his second interception 28yards for a touchdown that made the score 21–10 and put the game of reach in the fourth quarter.|$|E

On April 15, 2014 during WWE's annual Business Partners Summit, Stephanie confirmed a new WWE logo that would debut the night after WWE SummerSlam although it's already showing up on WWE products like the WWE Network and NXT.

5|$|The {{experiment}} was suggested on 1 November 1943 by Robert Serber. The {{idea was to}} measure the spatial and temporal symmetry of explosive compression of a metal sphere. The test measured changes of absorption of gamma rays in the metal of the sphere as it underwent compression. The gamma ray source was located {{in the center of}} a metal sphere. The increase of thickness (of hollow shells) and density (of solid spheres) as the compression progressed was detected as a decrease of intensity of gamma rays outside of the sphere; the lower density explosives did not absorb gamma radiation enough to interfere with the experiment. The gamma rays had to be intense and of the right energy. Too low energy, and they would be fully absorbed in the surrounding metal; too high energy <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> of attenuation during the implosion would be too low to be practical. The detectors had to provide high speed and large area; fast ionization chambers, then under development, were the only devices then available satisfying the requirements.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem of}} {{induction}} discussed above {{is seen in}} another form in debates over the foundations of statistics. The standard approach to statistical hypothesis testing avoids claims about whether evidence supports a hypothesis or makes it more probable. Instead, the typical test yields a p-value, which is the probability of the evidence being such as it is, {{under the assumption that}} the hypothesis being tested is true. If the p-value is too low, the hypothesis is rejected, in a way analogous to falsification. In contrast, Bayesian inference seeks to assign probabilities to hypotheses. Related topics in philosophy of statistics include probability interpretations, overfitting, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> between correlation and causation.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the teeth}} found with the holotype {{specimen}} were not {{attached to the}} skull; a few remained in the upper jaw, and only small replacement teeth were in the lower jaw. The teeth had the shape of recurved cones, flattened somewhat sideways. The larger teeth were less recurved than the smaller ones, but were otherwise uniform. The roots were very long, and the teeth slender. The carinae (edges) of the teeth were finely serrated with denticles {{on the front and}} back. There were seven narrow, uniform denticles per millimetre (0.039in), more than in most theropods. Some of the teeth were fluted, with six to eight ridges along the length of their inner sides and fine-grained enamel. The inner side of each tooth row had a bony wall. The number of teeth was large, with seven teeth in the right premaxilla (other theropods have three to five) and thirty-two in the dentary, where sixteen is typical. The lower jaw would have had sixty-four teeth, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> between the number of teeth in the upper and lower jaws is more pronounced than in other theropods. The teeth in the dentary were more densely packed than those in the maxilla, and probably smaller. The terminal rosette in the upper jaw had thirteen dental alveoli (tooth sockets), six on the left and seven on the right side; the first four were large (with the second and third the largest), while the fourth and fifth progressively decreased in size. The diameter of the largest was twice that of the smallest. The first four alveoli of the dentary (corresponding to the tip of the upper jaw) were the largest, with the rest more regular in size. Interdental plates were between the alveoli.|$|E
