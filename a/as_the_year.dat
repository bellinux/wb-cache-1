5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> {{was coming}} to a close, tragedy struck.|$|E
5|$|A late 15th century legenda nova {{claimed that}} Henry {{had come to}} Sweden in the retinue of papal legate Nicholas Breakspear, the later Pope Adrian IV, and {{appointed}} as the Bishop of Uppsala by him. Even though legenda nova states 1150 <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> of the crusade, it is certain from other sources that Nicholas really was in Sweden in 1153. It is not known whether this was just an inference by the writer, {{based on the fact}} that also Nicholas was an Englishman. However, there is no information about anyone called as Henry accompanying the legate in any source describing the visit, nor him appointing a new bishop in Uppsala. Another claim by legenda nova was that Henry was translated to Turku cathedral already in 1154, which certainly was false since the cathedral was built only in the 1290s. In the late 16th century, Bishop Paulus Juusten claimed that Henry had been the Bishop of Uppsala for two years before the crusade. Based on these postulates, early 20th-century historians assembled 1155 <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> of the crusade and 1156 <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> of Henry's death. Historians from different centuries have also suggested various other years from 1150 to 1158.|$|E

5|$|On 9 June 68, amid growing {{opposition}} of the Senate and the army, Nero committed suicide and with him the Julio-Claudian dynasty came to an end. Chaos ensued, leading to a year of brutal civil war known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Year</b> of the Four Emperors, during which the four most influential generals in the Roman Empire—Galba, Otho, Vitellius and Vespasian—successively vied for imperial power.|$|E

5|$|Fan {{interest}} in women's wrestling sunk once again <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> closed, and Sing tired of working there. Moreover, Faye was frustrated with her gimmick.

After a year with the company, Sing asked for a release from her contract. She briefly returned to Japan, but {{did not like the}} new system, which did not guarantee payouts.|$|E

5|$|In 1977-78, the West Australian Government, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Charles Court, announced plans for a nuclear power reactor near Perth. 1977 was seen <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> of mass mobilization in WA, with 300 at the first anti-nuclear demonstration to 9,000 at the third protest in the inner city of Perth. Despite public protest, the WA Government selected a first site for a nuclear reactor in 1979 at Wilbinga, 70 kilometres north of Perth. Court predicted that at least another 20 nuclear power plants would be needed {{by the end of the}} century to meet rapidly growing power demand, but all of this never eventuated.|$|E

5|$|It {{was in the}} 1999–2000 {{season that}} the Colorado Avalanche played their first game in the new Pepsi Center that cost US$160million. Milan Hejduk scored the first goal of a 2–1 victory against the Boston Bruins on October 13, 1999. The Avalanche {{finished}} {{the season with a}} 42–28–11–1 record for 96 points and won the Northwest Division. Before the playoffs, the Avalanche strengthened their defense for a run towards the Stanley Cup. On March 6, 2000, the Boston Bruins traded future Hockey Hall of Fame defenseman Ray Bourque and forward Dave Andreychuk to Colorado for Brian Rolston, Martin Grenier, Samuel Pahlsson and a first round draft pick. Bourque, who had been a Bruin since 1979, requested a trade to a contender for a chance to win the Stanley Cup. However, and just <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> before, Colorado lost in the Conference Finals against the Dallas Stars in a seven games after beating the Phoenix Coyotes and Detroit Red Wings in five games.|$|E

5|$|McCain's oft-cited {{strengths}} as {{a presidential}} candidate for 2008 included national name recognition, sponsorship of major lobbying and campaign finance reform initiatives, his ability to reach across the aisle, his well-known military service and experience as a POW, his experience from the 2000 presidential campaign, and an expectation that he would capture Bush's top fundraisers. During the 2006 election cycle, McCain had attended 346events and helped raise more than $10.5million on behalf of Republican candidates. McCain also became more willing to ask business and industry for campaign contributions, while maintaining that such contributions would not affect any official decisions he would make. Despite being considered the front-runner for the nomination by pundits as 2007 began, McCain was in second place behind former Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani in national Republican polls <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> progressed.|$|E

5|$|Michael {{was born}} under {{the family name}} of Pătraşcu. In 1601, during a stay in Prague, he was portrayed by the painter Aegidius Sadeler, who {{mentioned}} on the portrait the words aetatis XLIII ("in the 43rd year of life"), which indicates 1558 <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> of Michael's birth. Very {{little is known about}} his childhood and early years as an adult. He is argued by most historians to have been the illegitimate son of Wallachian Prince Pătraşcu cel Bun, (Pătrașcu the Good) of the Drăculeşti branch of the House of Basarab, while others believe he merely invented his descent in order to justify his rule. His mother was Theodora Kantakouzene, a member of the Kantakouzenoi, a noble family present in Wallachia and Moldavia, and allegedly descended from the Byzantine Emperor John VI Kantakouzenos.|$|E

Going freelance in the nineteen-sixties, Kneale had produced scripts for Associated Television and for Hammer Films. In the late nineteen-sixties and early nineteen-seventies, Kneale had been coaxed back to the BBC, writing such plays <b>as</b> <b>The</b> <b>Year</b> of the Sex Olympics, Wine of India and, for the anthology series Out of the Unknown, The Chopper.|$|E
5|$|On 3 December 1944, No. 351 Squadron {{carried out}} a {{successful}} rocket attack against Axis coastal defences on the Island of Lošinj, launching from Vis.

Eager to evaluate them, the British Army carried out Operation Biting, a commando raid to capture, dismantle and transport {{an example of}} the mobile radar to Britain. The force increased to 70 aircraft in eight flights <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> progressed. Operations were carried out in the Atlantic, over Scandinavia, the North Sea, and the Baltic Sea. In November, PR units operated from Gibraltar in support of Operation Torch, the Allied landing in French North Africa. It was detailed to keep watch on the movements of the Vichy French Fleet at Toulon, France. One of the most active squadrons at this time operated Spitfires. No. 540 Squadron RAF was particularly busy in 1943, over Norway.|$|E

The 2009 Wimbledon final was also historic for being the longest Grand Slam final in terms of games played with Federer prevailing 16–14 in the fifth set. Upon breaking the Grand Slam tournament record, Federer was hailed by some analysts and many tennis greats as the greatest player in tennis history. Federer finished the season <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> end World No.1 for the fifth time in his career.|$|E
5|$|The Flavian dynasty was a Roman {{imperial}} dynasty, which {{ruled the}} Roman Empire between 69 AD and 96 AD, encompassing the reigns of Vespasian (6979), {{and his two}} sons Titus (7981) and Domitian (8196). The Flavians rose to power {{during the civil war}} of 69, known <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>Year</b> of the Four Emperors. After Galba and Otho died in quick succession, Vitellius became emperor in mid 69. His claim to the throne was quickly challenged by legions stationed in the Eastern provinces, who declared their commander Vespasian emperor in his place. The Second Battle of Bedriacum tilted the balance decisively in favour of the Flavian forces, who entered Rome on December 20. The following day, the Roman Senate officially declared Vespasian emperor of the Roman Empire, thus commencing the Flavian dynasty. Although the dynasty proved to be short-lived, several significant historic, economic and military events took place during their reign.|$|E
