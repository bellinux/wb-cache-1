40|$|Deterministic {{stresses}} {{are used}} to describe the unsteady effects on the flow field in multistage <b>axial</b> flow <b>compressors.</b> In this paper, a circumferentially non-uniform mixing plane method implemented with deterministic stresses is used for the flow prediction inside the rear stage of an <b>axial</b> flow <b>compressor</b> in a multistage environment. The deterministic stress field is calculated with an overlapped solution approach for the same flow passage and implemented with the Navier-Stokes equations in order to provide continuous interfaces. The aerodynamic boundary condition is simplified with the application of a repeating stage model where only the mass flowrate and stage exit average static pressure are required. Two computational cases for the third stage of the Cranfield low-speed research compressor, one with the mixing plane model and the second with the mixing plane model in combination with deterministic stresses, are examined and compared with each other and also with corresponding experimental data. It is shown that the implementation of the deterministic stresses is beneficial for the flow prediction but the improvement in accuracy for low-speed <b>axial</b> flow <b>compressor</b> <b>rear</b> stages is not significant...|$|R

This paper {{presents}} a parametric study on aerodynamic {{performance of a}} transonic <b>axial</b> <b>compressor</b> combined with a casing groove and tip injection using three-dimensional Reynolds-average Navier-Stokes equations. The front and rear lengths and height of the groove are selected as the geometric parameters to investigate their effects on the stall margin and peak adiabatic efficiency. These parameters are changed with constant injection. The validation of the numerical results is performed in comparison with experimental data for the total pressure ratio and adiabatic efficiency. As {{the results of the}} parametric study, the maximum stall margin and peak adiabatic efficiency are obtained in the <b>axial</b> <b>compressor</b> having 70 % groove height of the reference groove. The stall margin and peak adiabatic efficiency in other cases are also improved in comparison with the <b>axial</b> <b>compressors</b> with the smooth casing and reference groove.

40|$|AbstractWith {{increasing}} computing power, Large Eddy Simulation {{could be}} a useful simulation tool for gas turbine <b>axial</b> <b>compressor</b> design. This paper outlines a series of simulations performed on compressor geometries, ranging from a Controlled Diffusion Cascade stator blade to the periodic sector of a stage in a 3. 5 stage <b>axial</b> <b>compressor.</b> The simulation results show that LES may offer advantages over traditional RANS methods when off-design conditions are considered – flow regimes where RANS models often fail to converge. The time-dependent nature of LES permits the resolution of transient flow structures, and can elucidate new mechanisms of vorticity generation on blade surfaces. It is shown that accurate LES is heavily reliant on both the near-wall mesh fidelity {{and the ability of}} the imposed inflow condition to recreate the conditions found in the reference experiment. For components embedded in a compressor this requires the generation of turbulence fluctuations at the inlet plane. A recycling method is developed that improves the quality of the flow in a single stage calculation of an <b>axial</b> <b>compressor,</b> and indicates that future developments in both the recycling technique and computing power will bring simulations of <b>axial</b> <b>compressors</b> within reach of industry in the coming years...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This work {{investigates the}} effects of {{circumferential}} casing grooves on stall flow characteristics of a transonic <b>axial</b> <b>compressor.</b> Numerical analysis is conducted by solving three-dimensional steady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations with the shear stress transport turbulence model. The results of flow analysis for an <b>axial</b> <b>compressor</b> with smooth casing are validated in comparison with experimental data for the pressure ratio and adiabatic efficiency. The numerical stall inception point is identified from the last converged point by convergence criteria, and the stall margin is predicted numerically. The peak adiabatic efficiency point is also obtained by reducing the normalized mass flow in the high mass flow region. In order to {{explore the influence of}} number of the circumferential casing grooves on the performance of the compressor, the stall margins and peak adiabatic efficiencies are evaluated compared to the case smooth casing.

40|$|International audienceOne of {{the most}} {{effective}} methods for increasing a gas turbine thermal efficiency, is using " fogging " at the <b>axial</b> <b>compressor</b> first stage. That is why some investigations have been made by scientists all over the world, {{in order to create a}} model that represents fairly the hydraulic behavior of the water droplets flowing through the first stage of the <b>axial</b> <b>compressor</b> that forms part of a gas turbine. However, few works have been made for analysis of such behavior on systems conformed by both cooling tunnel and first stage of axial compresor. The main previous work was made by Moreno et al., where only a compressor hydraulic behavior was taken into account. It is important to notice that only first stage of rotor and stator was simulated using CFD techniques. The objective of this paper is to simulate the system conformed by cooling-tunnel and first stage of an <b>axial</b> <b>compressor,</b> when considering fogging technique, since on previous works on literature both components have been studied separately. Several variables like dry-bulb temperatures, droplet sizes, water injection rates, air mass flow rates and others were combinely evaluated, in order to enhance an improvement on <b>axial</b> <b>compressors</b> thermal efficiency. The numerical analysis was performed using CFX simulator. Also this study could help improve gas turbines performance, which implies lower costs of operation. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – This paper aims to {{validate}} and analyse the NASA 35 <b>axial</b> <b>compressor</b> performance {{based on a}} numerical approach. Design/methodology/approach – Knowledge about flow property change during compressor operation at high and relatively low speed is still limited. This work provides a numerical approach to address these problems. Validation of numerical methods is proposed to generate confidence the numerical approach adopted, and after that, analysis of compressor performance at different operation conditions is carried out. Findings – The numerical methods proposed are proved capable in predicting compressor performance. Changes of flow property during compressor operation are discussed and explained. Research limitations/implications – The current numerical work is carried out based on {{the first stage of}} the NASA 35 <b>axial</b> <b>compressor,</b> where the interactive effects from adjacent stage are not counted in.
