40|$|The {{need for}} {{automatic}} testing of large-scale web applications suggests {{the use of}} model-based testing technology. Among various modeling languages, UML is widely spread and used for its simplicity, understandability and ease of use. But rigorous analysis for UML model is difficult due to its lack of precise semantics. On the other hand, as a formal notation, FSM provides an avenue for automatic generation of test cases, but the requirement for mathematical basis makes itself academic inventions divorced from real applications. This paper proposes an approach to transforming UML model to FSM model, taking advantage of both languages. As our work focuses on the transformation of UML state diagrams to FSM models, a specific transformation mechanism is presented, which deals with different elements with different mapping rules. To illustrate the mechanism we proposed, {{an example of a}} web <b>application</b> for <b>software</b> <b>download</b> is presented.

In this context, user interfaces for <b>software</b> <b>downloading</b> play a key role.

This paper presents different design alternatives for <b>software</b> <b>download</b> interfaces, i. e. the interface that prompts the user if he wishes to actually complete its download, and evaluates their ability {{to improve the quality}} of user interactions while reducing errors in user decisions. More precisely, we compare Authenticode, the leading <b>software</b> <b>download</b> interface for Internet Explorer, to Question-&-Answer, a <b>software</b> <b>download</b> interface previously proposed by the authors [Dini et al., 2007]. Furthermore, we evaluate the effect of extending both interfaces by means of a reputation system similar to the eBay Feedback Forum. The results of the usability studies show that i) the pure Question-&-Answer interface is the most effective in minimizing users incoherent behaviors, and ii) the differences in reputation rankings significantly influence users. Overall results suggest guidelines to design the best interface depending on the context (brand reputation and product features) ...|$|R

In this context, user interfaces for <b>software</b> <b>downloading</b> must be designed carefully. They should provide usable interactions and support users when deciding whether to accept the software product or not. This work proposes to enrich a common browser interface for <b>software</b> <b>downloading</b> with a reputation system - a mechanism for collecting and presenting user feedback. The reputation system is assessed with a usability study. The authors’ results show that positive user rankings are effective in increasing user download acceptances for well-known publishers and common name publishers, {{as well as in}} increasing acceptance motivations related to trust aspects. In addition, the presence of the reputation system reduces incoherent user behaviors...|$|R

40|$|Recently, several {{researchers}} {{have discovered the}} need for radios to use description techniques. Previous research describes information such as the current frequency band, waveform, and so on.

The compatibility between software and hardware prior to <b>software</b> <b>download</b> previously had to be verified manually.

[...] "Click-to-call" [...] technology now virtually always refers to a means for a web consumer to ask a website operator to call her.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{this era}} of {{evidence-based}} medicine, doctors are increasingly using information technology to acquire medical knowledge. This study evaluates how residents and interns utilise and perceive the personal digital assistant (PDA) and the online resource UpToDate. Methods This is a questionnaire survey of all residents and interns in a tertiary teaching hospital. Results Out of 168 doctors, 134 (79. 8 %) responded to the questionnaire. Only 54 doctors (40. 3 %) owned a PDA. Although these owners perceived that the PDA was most useful for providing drug information, followed by medical references, scheduling and medical calculators, {{the majority of them}} did not actually have medical <b>software</b> <b>applications</b> <b>downloaded</b> on their PDAs. The greatest concerns highlighted for the PDA were the fear of loss and breakage, and the preference for working with desktop computers and paper. Meanwhile, only 76 doctors (56. 7 %) used UpToDate, even though the hospital had an institutional subscription for it. Although 93. 4 % of these users would recommend UpToDate to a colleague, only 57. 9 % stated that the use of UpToDate had led to a change in their management of patients. Conclusion Although UpToDate and various PDA <b>software</b> <b>applications</b> were deemed useful by some of the residents and interns in our study, both digital tools were under-utilised. More should be done to facilitate the use of medical <b>software</b> <b>applications</b> on PDAs, to promote awareness of tools for evidence-based medicine such as UpToDate, and to facilitate the application of evidence-based medicine in daily clinical practice. </p...|$|R
