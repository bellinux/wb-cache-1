In one single instance quoted in 2006: [...] "A nurse-led clinic at Letham has received positive feedback on a trial of a video-link which allowed 60 pensioners to be assessed by medics without travelling to a doctor's office or medical clinic." [...] A further improvement in telemedical services has been the development of new technology incorporated into special videophones to permit remote diagnostic services, such as blood sugar level, blood pressure and vital signs monitoring. Such units are capable of relaying both regular <b>audiovideo</b> plus medical data over either standard (POTS) telephone or newer broadband lines.Videotelephony has also been deployed in corporate teleconferencing, also available through the use of public access videoconferencing rooms. A higher level of videoconferencing that employs advanced telecommunication technologies and high-resolution displays is called telepresence.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Utilization of Internet {{communications}} in distance learning, distributed simulation, and distributed work groups involves multimedia transmission of animation, voice and video clips. Highly compressed <b>audiovideo</b> data protocols {{are required for}} efficient Internet multimedia communications. Addressing this requirement, anew transport protocol called Audio-Video Protocol (AVP) for highly efficient multimedia communications on the Internet is presented. While providing similar real-time delivery functions as Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) and Real-Time Control Protocol (RTCP), AVP adopts a novel audio-based synchronization scheme. This synchronization scheme has two advantages. One is the overhead reduction through eliminating the timestamp in each transmitted data packet. The other is the packet rate reduction by putting multiple audio frames or mixed <b>audiovideo</b> frames in a single AVP packet. As a result, the end-to-end media unit delay is reduced while achieving implicit synchronization. Furthermore, AVP provides adaptive quality of service (QoS) by the prioritized packetization scheme. Simulation results are presented to verify {{the advantages of the}} AVP protocol. Keywords: RTP/RTCP, video streaming, synchronization, end-to-end delay, QoS 1...|$|E
40|$|Objective. It is {{well-established}} {{that early}} visual information {{has an important}} role in human ability to play ball sports, as its correct interpretation promotes accurate predictions concerning the ball motion. Other research highlights that auditory information provides relevant cues in various sport situations. The present study combines these two lines of research with the aim to investigate the contribution of early auditory and visual information to the discrimination of shot power in sport-specific situations. Design. Two experiments were run, one concerning soccer penalty kicks and the other concerning volleyball smashes. In both experiments there were three conditions: Audio, <b>Audiovideo,</b> and Video; a within subjects design was used, with the three conditions carried out in three different days and in a counterbalanced order among participants. Method. Participants’ task was to discriminate the power of two penalties/smashes presented in rapid sequence, {{on the basis of a}} two-alternative forced choice paradigm. Results. The results revealed that, for both penalties and smashes, response accuracy was above chance level in all the three conditions; moreover, while for the penalties no difference among the conditions was observed, for the smashes participants were more accurate in the Audio and <b>Audiovideo</b> conditions compared to the Video condition. As concerns the response times, for both penalties and smashes participants were faster in the Audio and <b>Audiovideo</b> conditions compared to the Video condition. Conclusions. Taken together, the results suggest that the discrimination of shot power was more easily performed on the basis of early auditory information than on the basis of the respective visual information...|$|E

There are two approaches to <b>audiovideo</b> transmission: singlestream and multistream. The former trans-mits a single transport stream of interleaved audio and video, while the latter treats the two media as separate transport streams. Each approach has an alternative of whether media synchronization con-trol at the destination is carried out or not. Thus, we have the four basic schemes. In the simulation, we also assess the networklevel QoS. We then show that the multistream approach with media synchronization control is the best scheme among the four schemes. I...|$|E

To better take into account different object maneuvers, multiple state-space equations are also incorporated. The result is a recursive multi-state multisensor estimator. Experiments show that it yields significantly improved joint position estimates compared to results achieved by using either an audio or a video system only. 1.

40|$|In this paper, {{we measure}} and model the {{distribution}} of multicast group members. Multicast research has traditionally been plagued {{by a lack of}} real data and an absence of a systematic simulation methodology. Although temporal group properties have received some attention, the location of group members has not been measured and modelled. However, the placement of members can have significant impact on the design and evaluation of multicast schemes and protocols as shown in previous studies. In our work, we identify properties of members that reflect their spatial clustering and the correlation among them (such as participation probability, and pairwise correlation). Then, we obtain values for these properties by monitoring the membership of network games and large <b>audiovideo</b> broadcasts from IETF and NASA. Finally, we provide a comprehensive model that can generate realistic groups. We evaluate our model against the measured data with excellent results. A realistic group membership model can help us improve the effectiveness of simulations and guide the design of group-communication protocols...|$|E
40|$|Now a days {{transfer}} {{of information from}} one system to another system needs more security especially in some applications like militaty etc. It can sent to through different mediums such as <b>audio,video.</b> So to transmit information in secured manner, Steganography is used. Steganography is the practice of concealing a file, message, image, or video within another file, message, image, or video. The word steganography combines the Greek words steganos meaning "covered, concealed, or protected", and graphein meaning "writing". But we cannot transmit more amounts of hidden data. So {{we go to the}} video Steganography using DWT method. In this paper, we propose a steganography technique which embeds the secret messages in frequency domain. According to different users demands on the embedding capacity and quality, the proposed algorithm consists of converting video into frmaes and embedding each secured data within each frame. So more amount of information hide in a single video. Unlike the space domain approaches, secret messages are embedded in the high frequency coefficients resulted from Discrete Wavelet Transform...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{introduces}} {{a new concept}} of surveillance, namely, audio-visual data integration for background modelling. Actually, visual data acquired by a fixed camera can be easily supported by audio information allowing a more complete analysis of the monitored scene. The key idea {{is to build a}} multimodal model of the scene background, able to promptly detect single auditory or visual events, as well as simultaneous audio and visual foreground situations. In this way, it is also possible to tackle some open problems (e. g., the sleeping foreground problems) of standard visual surveillance systems, if they are also characterized by an audio foreground. The method is based on the probabilistic modelling of the audio and video data streams using separate sets of adaptive Gaussian mixture models, and on their integration using a coupled <b>audiovideo</b> adaptive model working on the frame histogram, and the audio frequency spectrum. This framework has shown to be able to evaluate the time causality between visual and audio foreground entities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to the multimodal modelling of scenes working on-line and using one static camera and only one microphone. Preliminary results show the effectiveness of the approach at facing problems still unsolved by only visual monitoring approaches. ...|$|E
40|$|Two {{methods of}} fine tuning the initial {{settings}} of hearing aids were compared: An audiologist-driven approach-using real ear measurements and a patient-driven fine-tuning approach-using feedback from real-life situations. The patient-driven fine tuning {{was conducted by}} employing the Amplifit (R) II system using <b>audiovideo</b> clips. The audiologist-driven fine tuning {{was based on the}} NAL-NL 1 prescription rule. Both settings were compared using the same hearing aids in two 6 -week trial periods following a randomized blinded cross-over design. After each trial period, the settings were evaluated by insertion-gain measurements. Performance was evaluated by speech tests in quiet, in noise, and in time-reversed speech, presented at 0 degrees and with spatially separated sound sources. Subjective results were evaluated using extensive questionnaires and audiovisual video clips. A total of 73 participants were included. On average, higher gain values were found for the audiologist-driven settings than for the patient-driven settings, especially at 1000 and 2000 Hz. Better objective performance was obtained for the audiologist-driven settings for speech perception in quiet and in time-reversed speech. This was supported by better scores on a number of subjective judgments and in the subjective ratings of video clips. The perception of loud sounds scored higher than when patient-driven, but the overall preference was in favor of the audiologist-driven settings for 67 % of the participant...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} generic UPnP Presentation Architecture for AmI meeting rooms. It allows the {{development}} of applications based on standardized access mechanisms. This architecture introduces besides standard lighting devices also a UPnP design for complex projection settings, analog <b>audiovideo</b> devices, shutter blinds and media repositories. Using this architecture, AmI developers benefit from UPnP device discovery as well as standardized access to devices and media repositories. This allows the development of interaction solutions working in various AmI environments that may be composed by different device infrastructures. Based on this architecture, we present the PECo system, a novel Control Point which provides integrated and intuitive access to the user's surrounding and media repositories allowing to control and manage intelligent environments. PECo uses an automatically created 3 D visualization of the environment. Entering a room, PECo discovers the infrastructure and available devices and builds the integrated user interface. The 3 D visualization creates a logical link between physical devices and their virtual representation on the user's PDA. By doing so, the user can easily identify a device within his environment based on its position, orientation and form. There he can access the identified devices through the 3 D interface and manipulate them directly within the scene. For example he can click on a 3 D object to turn on a light. The 3 D interface allows the user to access the infrastructure without demanding knowledge about specific device names, IP-numbers, URLs etc...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this action research is to improve Grade V-B students’ listening skills by conducting English storytelling. Starting with reconnaissance, this research consisted of two cycles, each of which contained four steps: planning, action, observation, and reflection. The data {{of this study were}} qualitative data, obtained by doing observations, taking <b>audiovideo</b> recordings of classroom interactions and photographs of the physical context, conducting interviews, writing the diaries, and collecting classroom documents. The data were analyzed by assembling the data, coding the data, comparing the data, building meanings and interpretations, and reporting the outcomes. Validity and reliability of the result of the research were examined by applying outcome, process, catalytic, democratic, and dialogic validity and triangulation. The result of this research showed that by English storytelling, the Grade V-B students’ listening skills improved but the class was still noisy {{until the end of the}} action. Using various media also supported the storytelling activity and made students not feel bored. Then, very important printed handouts supported students in listening English through storytelling but organizing too many printed/given handouts was difficult for them. Last, individual performance activities developed students’ active characters and suited to storytelling technique but the students could not work on group activities.

40|$|Singing {{abilities}} {{begin in}} early childhood and continue throughout life. <b>Audiovideo</b> recordings of singing behaviours collected {{from a wide variety}} of individuals can provide a foundation for exploring the complexities of singing acquisition. The AIRS Test Battery of Singing Skills (ATBSS) was developed to provide this foundation using a standard protocol appropriate for longitudinal testing of persons across the lifespan, from different cultures, and levels of musical training. Test components examine the ability to sing an internationally familiar song (Brother John, Frère Jacques) as well as learn a new song, perform short melodic fragments, sing lowest and highest notes, improvise the ending of a song, and create an entirely new song. Several verbal tasks are included. This article describes the early development of the ATBSS and the first two studies executed to provide proof of concept. The report of the first study focuses primarily on the data of the familiar song acquired during five monthly testing sessions of children aged 3, 5, and 7 years and university students. The report of the second study focuses on the administration of the test to healthy older persons and those with dementia. These studies show the viability of the ATBSS components in general and the applicability of the ATBSS for longitudinal investigations. The work also paves the way for use of the ATBSS in other countries and highlights the value of cooperation and data-sharing among researchers of singing...|$|E
40|$|The {{book is a}} {{collection}} of excerpts and examples of linguistic materials produced in SLIM project in the academic year 1994 - 1995. The project has come into life thanks to the initiative of the current Chancellor of the University Ca' Foscari, Prof. Paolo Costa, {{on the basis of a}} proposal that I officially presented to the University Board, who approved and financed it. The aim of the project is that of creating and organizing software tools for self-learning of foreign languages, and adapting commercially available <b>audiovideo</b> materials. The peculiarity of these software tools is their interactivity, which in our case is based on the ability of the computer to realize recognition tasks and other similar comparison tasks on the oral production of the student. These tasks are possible nowadays in so far as speech recognition has become a reality available on small PCs. Another important feature is the automatization of exercises and their complete adequacy with the actual learning materials used in the course. To realize this important point, all texts have been manually transcribed and linguistically classified at various levels of complexity: at word level, phrase level, sentence level, utterance level and finally at communicative unit level. These classifications constitute the linguistic backbone of the courseware and ar 4 e recorded in a database which is always activated while the student is working.

40|$|This {{research}} study investigates how selected Grade R teachers implement numeracy in their classrooms, {{based on their}} experiences, personal beliefs and perceptions. This study adopts the view that a teacher's practice is not only informed on what she believes about her learners, but also on how she organises her classroom environment and her own teaching practice. However, the teacher cannot be divorced from the political and historical background of Early Childhood Development (ECD), as these factors {{have an impact on}} her numeracy implementation. Integrated in this {{research study}} is thus not only a comprehensive historical analysis of the historical and political background of ECD, but also an in-depth look at the complex curriculum road the Grade R teacher had to travel over the past twelve years. The aim of this case study is to understand and describe what is happening in Grade R classrooms when numeracy is implemented, as well as identifying possible barriers which Grade R teachers may experience in implementing numeracy. The author utilized an adapted Interactive Qualitative Analysis Framework to explore Grade R teachers' views and experiences. Open-ended focus group interviews were used to develop a framework for individual interviews. This interview framework guided the data collection of nine audio-video tapes of classroom activities and nine semi-structured individual interviews. Analysis of the individual interviews revealed each teacher's understanding as well as her perceptions and needs regarding the implementation of numeracy in her classroom. The transcriptions of the individual interviews were compared to the audio-video tapes of what happened in each classroom. This was done in order to determine whether the teachers' practices were consistent with what they said in the interviews. Paradoxes and inconsistencies were documented. The historical and political analysis of ECD illustrates the complex development of ECD in South Africa over the last few decades. It therefore also highlights and brings to the fore the complex journey that Grade R teachers had to navigate in adapting their practice to ever changing curriculum requirements. The empirical results show that there are inconsistencies between what selected teachers know and believe, and what they are implementing. However, "silent themes" which did not come to the fore in the focus group or individual interviews, were identified in the <b>audiovideo</b> tapes of classroom activities. Also, many "silent themes" indicate that there are numerous concerns, such as lack of proficiency in bridging the gap between theory and practice, regarding the implementation of numeracy in Grade R. It was found that many of the selected Grade R teachers struggle to implement numeracy in their classrooms, as they lack the skills and support to teach numeracy in a Grade R context...|$|E
