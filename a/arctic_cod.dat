25|$|The {{spawning}} stock of North-East <b>Arctic</b> <b>cod</b> {{was more than}} a million tons following World War II, but declined to a historic minimum of 118,000 tons in 1987. The North-East <b>Arctic</b> <b>cod</b> catch reached a historic maximum of 1,343,000 tons in 1956, and bottomed out at 212,000 tons in 1990. Since 2000, the {{spawning stock}} has increased quite quickly, helped by low fishing pressure. However, there are worries about a decreased age at first spawning (often an early sign of stock collapse), combined with the level of discards and unreported catches. The total catch in 2003 was 521,949 tons, the major fishers being Norway (191,976 tons) and Russia (182,160 tons).|$|E
25|$|Belugas play an {{important}} role in the structure and function of marine resources in the Arctic Ocean, as they are the most abundant toothed whales in the region. They are opportunistic feeders; their feeding habits depend on their locations and the season. For example, when they are in the Beaufort Sea, they mainly eat <b>Arctic</b> <b>cod</b> (Boreogadus saida) and the stomachs of belugas caught near Greenland were found to contain rose fish (Sebastes marinus), Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), and northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis), while in Alaska their staple diet is Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). In general, the diets of these cetaceans consist mainly of fish; apart from those previously mentioned, other fish they feed on include capelin (Mallotus villosus), smelt, sole, flounder, herring, sculpin, and other types of salmon. They also consume a great quantity of invertebrates, apart from shrimp, such as squid, crabs, clams, octopus, sea snails, bristle worms, and other deep-sea species. Animals in captivity eat 2.5% to 3.0% of their body weight per day, which equates to 18.2 to 27.2kg.|$|E

40|$|On my {{very first}} day as a {{doctorate}} student, my supervisor Øyvind Fiksen introduced me {{to one of my}} new colleagues, Christian Jørgensen, who enthusiastically told me about his fascination with the Northeast <b>Arctic</b> <b>cod’s</b> spawning migrations. I was immediately intrigued by his eager approach, but most of all by the simplicity of the research question that would form the basis of this thesis. Why on earth would some cod choose to swim {{all the way from the}} Barents Sea to Møre, or even to Bergen, to spawn their eggs, when there were perfectly good spawning grounds in Lofoten or Troms, much closer to the Barents Sea? General evolutionary theory would predict that the individuals who undertook spawning migrations several times longer than their conspecifics must be getting something in return. Otherwise, it would be an evolutionary cul-de-sac. Impatiently I started sifting through all the literature I could find, from online articles via obscure reports from the Directorate of Fisheries, to joint Norwegian-Russian conference proceedings from the early 80 s, forgotten in someone’s bottom drawer. Still early in my work, Odd Nakken, a retired fisheries scientist, held an inspirin...|$|R

40|$|Prior to the 1920 s, the {{northeast}} <b>Arctic</b> (NA) <b>cod</b> were caught at spawning grounds {{ranging from the}} southernmost to the northernmost parts of the Norwegian coast, but have for the last 50 yr mainly been caught around the Lofoten archipelago and northwards. The NA cod have their feeding and nursery grounds in the Barents Sea, and migrate south towards the Norwegian coast in the winter to spawn. This study uses commercial fisheries' data from landing ports along the entire Norwegian coast during the period 1866 – 1969 as evidence of long-term truncation and northerly shift of spawning grounds. Nearly all spawning grounds south of Lofoten have been abandoned, while an increasing proportion of the spawning stock only uses the northernmost areas of the Norwegian coast, Troms and Finnmark. The truncation can hardly be attributed to long-term climatic variations, but may result from an intensive size-selective trawl fishery in the Barents Sea causing a sudden increase in fishing mortality, probably altering the size structure and migratory capacity of the stock...|$|R
40|$|Correlation and {{simulation}} analyses suggest that, for the Northeast <b>Arctic</b> (NA) <b>cod</b> stock, {{the total}} lipid energy (TLE (kJ)) {{contained in the}} livers of mature females is proportional to total egg production, making TLE a potential predictor of recruitment. Accordingly, the TLE of NA cod was estimated for a 51 -year time period (1946 – 1996), using estimates of numbers at length derived from virtual population analysis, modelled values of proportion mature and weight at length, and observed values of the liver-condition index. A significant linear relationship between TLE and recruitment to age 3 was observed. The temporal trend in TLE suggests that the reproductive potential of the NA cod stock has been in decline since the mid- 1970 s. A multiple-regression model that included TLE, mean temperature, and mean alongshore wind stress as independent variables explained approximately 43 % {{of the variation in}} recruitment.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} found {{positive}} associations between recruitment and indices of spawner quality (condition) for stocks exhibiting an indeterminate relationship between recruitment and spawner biomass. This suggests that spawner biomass is insensitive to interannual variability in condition affecting total egg production. This hypothesis was tested for the Northeast <b>Arctic</b> (NA) <b>cod</b> stock using a simulation approach. Because abundance of the Barents Sea capelin stock is an important determinant of condition of NA cod, the simulations varied length-specific proportion mature, weight, and fecundity of NA cod according to capelin biomass while holding numbers at length constant. Total egg production and spawner biomass and their associated errors were estimated for levels of capelin biomass which encompassed the range observed in the Barents Sea. Increasing condition significantly increased both total egg production and spawner biomass, however, the magnitude of increase in total egg production was approximately double that in spawner biomass. Incorporating hypothesized effects of condition on atresia and skipped spawning increased the difference between total egg production and spawner biomass. Comparing sim~~lation results for different numerical abundances and size compositions indicated that spawning stocks dominated by smaller length classes had larger differences between total egg production at the minimum and maximum capelin biomasses...|$|R

40|$|Hidden {{within the}} seminal 1914 {{publication}} by Johan Hjort, we find what {{is probably one}} of the first comprehensive teleost time-series ever published. The series is liver size and fat content of northeast <b>Arctic</b> (NEA) <b>cod</b> measured during the traditional winter fishery in Lofoten, Northern Norway, in 1880 – 1912 and 1883 – 1913, respectively. The data were collected well before the advent of the great industrialized fisheries in the 1930 s. The raw data used by Hjort originate from annual reports of the Lofoten fishery, initiated by Member of Parliament and pioneer fishery inspector of Northern Norway, Ketil Motzfeldt, in 1859. Based on these reports and following various calibration exercises, we present robust estimates of the hepatosomatic index (HSI) from 1859 to 2012 (except 1863), i. e. over 153 years—extending Hjort's analysis both backwards (1859 – 1879) and forwards (1913 –present). This series of bulk HSI contained five major periods: 1859 – 1880, 1881 – 1919, 1920 – 1974, 1975 – 2003, and 2004 – 2012; the highest HSI was recorded 1920 – 1974, whereas the lowest was from the most recent period. Despite variability, total length was a significant predictor of HSI, 1932 – 2012. A weak but significant relationship existed with both total-stock biomass and ocean temperature, as well as with the North Atlantic Oscillation winter index under a 1 -year lag. The present exceptionally long HSI series will give an excellent opportunity for further research on the “quality of the cod” in a historic perspective...|$|R

Shifts in maturation reactions norms can be rapid and estimating them can help disentangle plastic and evolutionary changes in the age and size at maturation, which is important from a management perspective, as genetic changes are likely more difficult to reverse.
