5|$|During the British Civil Wars (mid-17th {{century in}} Great Britain), both the Parliamentarian and Royalist armies used various {{incendiary}} devices to attack enemies and destroy property {{that might be}} used for military purposes, according to historian Stephen Porter in Destruction in the English Civil Wars. The flaming arrow attack was used to set fire to buildings at a distance. An arrow with a flammable substance attached to the shaft, close to the tip, was shot from a bow or short-muzzled musket. Such arrows shot from a musket had their feathers removed, to fit inside the muzzle, and were called fire-darts. These devices were cheap to make and easy to prepare. Although used infrequently during the wars, the flaming <b>arrows</b> <b>and</b> <b>darts</b> proved to be destructive. The Royalists shot flaming arrows into the thatched homes {{in the suburbs of}} Chester causing extensive damage. Lyme Regis was partly razed using flaming arrows.|$|E
60|$|The men made desperate {{attempts}} {{to defend their}} works, but all in vain. Some were killed by <b>arrows</b> <b>and</b> <b>darts,</b> some were burned to death, and others, in the confusion, fell into the sea. Finally, the army was obliged to draw back, and to abandon all that was combustible in the vast construction they had reared, to the devouring flames.|$|E
60|$|The {{country was}} a broken one; and the Mexicans, {{gathering}} on the hills, rolled stones down upon them, with volleys of <b>arrows</b> <b>and</b> <b>darts.</b> Sometimes they even ventured to descend into the plain, and fall upon {{the rear of}} the column. As often as they did so, however, the little body of cavalry drove them off. The infantry column kept steadily on its way, though greatly harassed by the continued attacks.|$|E
40|$|<b>Arrow</b> <b>and</b> <b>dart</b> poisons, {{considered}} as conventional natural sources for future drug discovery, have already provided numerous biologically active molecules used as drugs in therapeutic applications or in pharmacological research. Plants containing alkaloids or cardiotonic glycosides {{have generally been}} the main ingredients responsible for the efficacy of these poisons, although some animals, such as frogs, have also been employed. This paper, without being exhaustive, reports the greater strides made during the past 15 years {{in the understanding of}} the chemical nature and biological properties of <b>arrow</b> <b>and</b> <b>dart</b> poison constituents. Examples both of promising biological properties shown by these molecules and of crucial discoveries achieved by their use as pharmacological tools are given. Further studies of these toxic principles are likely to enable scientists to find new valuable lead compounds, useful in many fields of research, like oncology, inflammation and infectious diseases. 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This was soon followed by an order for eight smaller 2-2-2 Sun class engines with 6 ft driving wheels.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Arrow</b> <b>and</b> {{her sister}} ship Dart were [...] "Two {{experimental}} vessels designed by Samuel Bentham, Esq., {{at that time}} inspector-general of his majesty's naval works. They were in shape much sharper than vessels of war in general, and projected or raked forward, at each end like a wherry. Their breadth increased from the water-line upwards whereby it was considered {{that they would be}} stiffer, and less liable to overset than ordinary vessels. The decks were straight fore and aft, and the frames or ribs of less curvature than usual. They were constructed to carry twenty-four 32-pounder carronades upon the main deck, and were afterwards fitted to receive two more carronades of the same nature on each of their two short decks, which we may call the quarterdeck and forecastle. All these carronades were fitted upon the non-recoil principle. It is believed that both the <b>Arrow</b> <b>and</b> <b>Dart</b> subsequently took on board, for their quarterdecks, two additional 32s. They proved to be stiff vessels and swift sailers, but it was found necessary to add some dead wood to their bottoms, in order to make them stay better. Not knowing exactly what characteristic designation to give the <b>Arrow</b> <b>and</b> <b>Dart,</b> we have merely named them: they must be considered, especially when their force is compared with that of the two or three classes next above them, as extraordinary vessels for sloops of war, but as such only they ranked." ...|$|R
60|$|They saw {{at once a}} {{great number}} and variety of playthings {{exhibited}} to view. All around the floor were arranged horses on wheels, little carts, wagons, and baskets. The counter had {{a great variety of}} images and figures,--birds that would peep, and dogs that would bark, and drummers that would drum--all by just turning a little handle. Then the shelves and the window were filled with all sorts of boxes, and whips, and puzzles, and tea-sets, and dolls, dressed and not dressed. There were bows and <b>arrows,</b> <b>and</b> <b>darts,</b> and jumping ropes, and glass dogs, and little rocking-horses, and a thousand other things.|$|E
60|$|When {{half the}} English army had passed Wallace {{gave the order}} to advance. First Sir Andrew Moray, with two {{thousand}} men, descended the hills farther to the right, and on seeing these the English cavalry charged at once against them. The instant they did so Wallace, with his main army, poured down from the craig impetuously and swept away the English near {{the head of the}} bridge, taking possession of the end, and by showers of <b>arrows</b> <b>and</b> <b>darts</b> preventing any more from crossing. By this maneuver the whole of the English infantry who had crossed were cut off from their friends and inclosed in the narrow promontory.|$|E
60|$|Accordingly we {{sent two}} shallops, or large boats, which carried {{together}} sixty men, all well armed. We gave them store of beads and knives and scissors, and such baubles with them, with hatchets and nails, and hooks, looking-glasses, and the like; and we built {{up the sides}} and sterns of the boats, and covered them with boards, to keep off <b>arrows</b> <b>and</b> <b>darts,</b> if they should find occasion, so that they looked like London barges. In this posture, {{as soon as the}} tide or flood was made up, our men went away, carrying a drum and a trumpet in each boat; and each boat had also two patereroes, or small cannon, fixed on the gunnel near the bow.|$|E

His hostile action had raised the alarm among the populations around Bezeguiche bay. The next Portuguese ships to arrive in the area—the large slaving fleet of Lançarote de Freitas a few months later—would be greeted by a hail of <b>arrows</b> <b>and</b> poisoned <b>darts,</b> <b>and</b> forced away.|$|R

60|$|The men {{strained}} at {{the tough}} oars, and the Dragon leapt ahead {{to meet the}} foe. Her bow was pointed as if she would have passed close {{by the side of}} the Danish galley, which was crowded with men. When close to her, however, the helmsman pushed the tiller across and the Dragon swept straight down upon her. A shout of dismay rose from the Danes, a hasty volley of <b>arrows</b> <b>and</b> <b>darts</b> was hurled at the Dragon, and the helmsman strove to avoid the collision, but in vain. The Dragon struck her on the beam, the frail craft broke up like an egg-shell under the blow, and sank almost instantly under the bows of the Dragon.|$|E
60|$|When {{they had}} all passed, {{he came out of}} his camp and {{followed}} them as far as Aquæ Sextiæ, now called Aix, where one of the most terrible battles the world ever saw was fought. These people were a whole tribe--wives, children, and everything they had with them--and to be defeated was utter and absolute ruin. A great enclosure was made with their carts and wagons, whence the women threw <b>arrows</b> <b>and</b> <b>darts</b> to help the men; and when, after three days of hard fighting, all hope was over, they set fire to the enclosure and killed their children and themselves. The whole swarm was destroyed. Marius marched away, and no one was left to bury the dead, so that the spot was called the Putrid Fields, and is still known as Les Pourrieres.|$|E
60|$|The warriors, {{under the}} {{direction}} of King Gos, continued to hurl <b>arrows</b> <b>and</b> <b>darts</b> and spears and axes and huge stones upon the invaders, all without avail. The ground below was thickly covered with weapons, yet not one of the three before the gates had been injured in the slightest manner. When everything had been cast that was available and not a single weapon of any sort remained at hand, the amazed warriors saw the boy put his shoulder against the gates and burst asunder the huge staples that held the bars in place. A thousand of their men could not have accomplished this feat, yet the small, slight boy did it with seeming ease. The gates burst open, and Inga advanced into the city street and called upon King Gos to surrender.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first record}} of histrionicotoxins dates to 1823 by Captain Charles Stuart Cochrane. Cochrane was {{exploring}} the tropical rainforests around Colombia and Panama. His reports mention tribes of Indians who used poison tipped <b>arrows</b> <b>and</b> blowgun <b>darts</b> for hunting <b>and</b> war. Upon further exploration, Cochrane {{found that these}} Indians extracted the poison from the skins of the poison dart frog, then known as Dendrobates histrionicus.

60|$|He at once {{directed}} {{his men to}} make up large trusses of straw, over which he poured considerable quantities of oil. Early {{the next morning the}} English drew out of their camp, and advanced in martial array. Each man carried a great faggot, and, covering themselves with these as they came within bowshot, they marched down to the moat. Each in turn threw in his faggot, and when he had done so returned to the camp and brought back another. Rapidly the process of filling up the moat opposite to the breach continued. The besiegers kept up a rain of <b>arrows</b> <b>and</b> <b>darts,</b> and many of the English were killed. But the work was continued without intermission until well nigh across the moat a broad crossway was formed level with the outer bank, but a narrow gap remained to be filled, and the English leaders advanced to the front to prevent the Scots on the breach rushing down to assault those placing the faggots.|$|E
60|$|Thus furnished, {{they went}} off about eleven {{o'clock in the}} forenoon, and to my very great uneasiness, I heard no more of them for four days. The whole ship's company were indeed {{surprised}} at their stay, and {{the captain of the}} sloop would fain have had me let him have sailed up the river with the sloop, as far as the channel would serve; which really we found was deep enough. Indeed, as I was unwilling to run any more risks, I could not persuade myself, but that the force I had already sent was sufficient to fight five thousand naked creatures, such as the natives seemed to be, and therefore, I was very unwilling to send. However, I consented at last to have our long-boat and two smaller boats manned with fifty-four men more, very well armed, and covered from <b>arrows</b> <b>and</b> <b>darts</b> as the other had been, to go up the river, upon their solemn promise, and with express order, to return the next day, at farthest; ordering them to fire guns as they went up the river, to give notice to their fellows, if they could be heard, that they were coming; and that, in the mean time, if I fired three guns they should immediately return.|$|E
60|$|They {{soon found}} {{themselves}} {{in the midst of}} scenes of dreadful terror and confusion,--the scenes, in fact, which are usually exhibited in the midnight sacking of a city. They met with various adventures during the time that they continued their desperate but hopeless resistance. They encountered a party of Greeks, and overpowered and slew them, and then, seizing the armor which their fallen enemies had worn, they disguised themselves in it, in hopes to deceive {{the main body of the}} Greeks by this means, so as to mingle among them unobserved, and thus attack and destroy such small parties as they might meet without being themselves attacked by the rest. They saw the princess Cassandra, the young daughter of king Priam, dragged away by Greek soldiers from a temple where she had sought refuge. They immediately undertook to rescue her, and were at once attacked both by the Greek party who had the princess in charge, and also by the Trojan soldiers, who shot <b>arrows</b> <b>and</b> <b>darts</b> down upon them from the roofs above, supposing, from the armor and the plumes which they wore, that they were enemies. They saw the royal palace besieged, and the tortoise formed for scaling the walls of it. The tumult and din, and the frightful glare of lurid flames by which the city was illuminated, a scene of inconceivable confusion and terror.|$|E

5000|$|Curare {{is known}} by many tribes across the Amazon forest, {{where it has}} served as a poison. Over a low fire the {{purified}} extract in time became a thickened liquid; it was then brushed onto <b>arrow</b> heads <b>and</b> <b>dart</b> points for use in hunting. Curare acts quickly as a paralysing poison when it directly enters the bloodstream. It is apparently safe to be taken orally, so that [...] "one can drink the poison without being harmed". Hence wild birds and animals caught by using curare are safe to eat. Years earlier Córdova had learned how to make it.|$|R

50|$|The armor was {{designed}} primarily {{to protect the}} torso of the warrior from obsidian swords, <b>arrows</b> <b>and</b> atlatl <b>darts,</b> {{it was made of}} successive layers of cotton and jute which would gradually slow <b>and</b> trap the <b>arrows,</b> rather than divert them, like European plate armour. Because this armor was padded it protected well against the cutting blows of the macuahuitl and the heavy blows of batons.It was a light garment sewn in diamond-shaped patterns, and worn directly over the skin. Usually, the most experienced warriors, especially those of the orders of eagle warriors and jaguar warriors used it to complement the tlahuiztli.|$|R
40|$|Pigments {{preserved}} on <b>arrow</b> <b>and</b> <b>dart</b> weaponry fragments from Gypsum Cave, Nevada, {{were analyzed}} by laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), X-Ray diffraction (XRD), and electron microprobe (EM) to determine their chemical composition, mineralogy, and physical structure. Results show {{that a variety of}} minerals were used to produce the green, red, pink, brown and black pigments. Although variation in composition and mineralogy suggests some degree of experimentation, similarities in the pigments suggest the application of standardized recipes for certain colors. Pigments applied to the more ancient darts are systematically different for cane vs. wooden implements, despite the finding that cane and wooden fragments were often used as fitting parts of the same composite weapon. For example, greens applied to darts are based on malachite while greens applied to cane are based on green earth minerals. The smaller sample of arrows shows many similarities to the more ancient darts, suggesting the transmission of information about pigmenting was fairly conservative over thousands of years in the southwest Great Basin, but does not show the same wood-cane dichotomy. hile the ethnographic record suggests pigment was widespread in the ancient Great Basin of North America, archaeological examples and studies of such pigments are relatively few.

5000|$|Gorobei is {{a skilled}} samurai {{who has made}} his living since the wars' end by {{entertaining}} people on the city streets. He is also {{a veteran of the}} Great War, so he knows Kambei by reputation. He is very skilled at dodging blows and can pluck <b>arrows</b> <b>and</b> <b>darts</b> from the air.

He often makes light of rather serious or dangerous situations. He is also quite smart, in his own unique way. He also appears to have a paraphilia with inflicted injury as it reminds him of battle. He is the second samurai, he was also the first samurai to die in the anime, and guided Katsushiro to go back to Kanna Village in spirit form.|$|E
5000|$|While Nachoragan was forming his plan, Justin {{decided to}} take {{advantage}} of the calm before the storm: he exited the city, leading a force of 5,000 men cavalrymen and an infantry brigade to [...] "a church of great sanctity in the vicinity". The Persians somehow failed to notice their departure, and began their great attack that same morning. <b>Arrows</b> <b>and</b> <b>darts</b> filled the air, while Sassanid siege weapons were attempting to destroy the wooden walls. The defenders answered by throwing [...] "huge blocks of stone" [...] at the weapons and smaller stones at the enemy soldiers. The initial stages of the fight lasted long enough for Justin to return from his pilgrimage. He could not return to the city, but was able to organize his own forces and attack the rear of the enemy force. Their sudden attack spread havoc, breaking through enemy lines. At least some of the Sassanid forces believed that Justin's men were the rumoured Byzantine reinforcements.|$|E
