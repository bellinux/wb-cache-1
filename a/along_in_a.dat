Between the two of us we came up with just this kind of groove, which stays on the same note as opposed to change, it's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll <b>along</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> much more fluid way. It was a bit mechanical before and it's just interesting how something small like that can really change the whole vibe of a song. It was just nice because from there on it was one of our favourite tracks and it almost didn't get on the record but it's now one of our favourite tracks.|$|E

25|$|The {{elements}} are interconnected {{only at the}} exterior nodes, and altogether they should cover the entire domain as accurately as possible. Nodes will have nodal (vector) displacements or degrees of freedom which may include translations, rotations, and for special applications, higher order derivatives of displacements. When the nodes displace, they will drag the elements <b>along</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> certain manner dictated by the element formulation. In other words, displacements of any points in the element will be interpolated from the nodal displacements, {{and this is the}} main reason for the approximate nature of the solution.|$|E
25|$|The crucial {{information}} that the slaves have murdered all the senior Spanish seamen except the captain Benito Cereno is withheld from the reader. The Spanish sailors, and specifically Cereno, are forced to play <b>along</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> theatrical performance {{for the benefit of}} the American Amasa Delano who initially approaches the dilapidated Spanish ship to offer his assistance. Though written in the third person, the narrative emerges largely through the point of view of Delano throughout the first and longest part of the narrative and therefore remains limited to what Delano sees (or thinks he sees). Biographer Delbanco describes the reader's experience of this perspective as if he witnesses the scene over Delano's shoulder and hears the crowd as through his ears.|$|E

25|$|Thirty-one {{people on}} board were killed, {{including}} both the pilots. Three of the survivors were not injured, including the flight attendants. Some of the survivors were able to free themselves and each other and {{walk out of the}} fuselage. Most were hanging in their seat belts, wedged in by the wreckage. The fire departments in Ängelholm and Vejbystrand arrived at the scene eleven minutes after the crash and started freeing the survivors. The airport's rescue service was on the scene seventeen minutes after the accident. Nine people were seriously injured and were brought to the field hospital at the air base. The survivors were generally seated in the aft of the cabin. One of the passengers had brought their cat <b>along</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cage on the flight, and it survived the accident.|$|E
25|$|As an example, marlin lures are {{typically}} 7-14 inches or more long with a shaped plastic or metal {{head and a}} plastic skirt. The design of the lure head, particularly its face, gives the lure its individual action when trolled through the water. Lure actions range from an active side-to-side swimming pattern to pushing water aggressively on the surface to, most commonly, tracking <b>along</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> straight line with a regular surface pop and bubble trail. Besides the shape, weight {{and size of the}} lure head, the length and thickness of skirting, the number and size of hooks and the length and size of the leader used in lure rigging all influence the action of the lure: how actively it will run and how it will respond to different sea conditions. Experienced anglers fine tune their lures to get the action they want.|$|E
500|$|Many theaters also {{routinely}} stage {{not just}} Italian translations of American musicals, but true Italian musical comedy, which are {{called by the}} English term musical.

500|$|Critics have praised Better Off Teds {{witty and}} satirical humour, {{as well as}} its cast. According to Metacritic, which assigns a {{normalized}} rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the show's first season holds a score of 68 out of 100, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews", based on 21 reviews. Misha Davenport of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote favorably of the show, comparing its characters to those of the highly acclaimed show Arrested Development. Linda Stasi of the New York Post gave the show three-and-a-half out of four stars, lauding the cast and simply referring to it as [...] "a very funny comedy". Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly gave the show a B+, stating [...] "'Better Off Ted' is certainly the most original sitcom to come <b>along</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> while."

[...] "Episode Mode" [...] involves the player playing through the game's main storyline, completing various objectives in order to continue on in the game. [...] "Free Mode" [...] allows players to roam towns and speak with the population. Players can also play extra missions to gain Experience points and items, some of which are exclusive to [...] "Free Mode".

500|$|Howard Thompson of The New York Times wrote, [...] "Atmospherically at least—there is a {{striking}} fusion of rich colors, plush décor and eerie music—this is probably Hollywood's most effective Poe-style horror flavoring to date…Richard Matheson's ironic plot is compact and as logical as {{the choice of the}} small cast…Roger Corman has evoked a genuinely chilling mood of horror." [...] Variety noted, [...] "The last portion of the film builds with genuine excitement to a reverse-twist ending that might have pleased Poe himself...a physically stylish, imaginatively photographed horror film…" [...] The Los Angeles Examiner said it was [...] "…one of the best [...] "scare" [...] movies to come <b>along</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> long time…skillfully directed by Corman…with Vincent Price turning in the acting job of his career…."

500|$|The {{resulting}} track features sharp {{criticism by}} Scott-Heron of then-US president Richard Nixon and his vice-president Spiro Agnew, among other politicians {{involved in the}} scandal; the Watergate incident had yet to reach its conclusion when the song was recorded. Scott-Heron introduces the song with a short speech discussing the blues and referencing current events: [...] "But lately we had Frank Rizzo with the 'Lie Detector Blues'/We done had the United States government talkin bout the 'Energy Crisis Blues'". The final chorus line directly references Nixon and the scandal: [...] "And {{there are those who}} swear that've seen King Richard/Beneath that cesspool–Watergate". His lyrics range from humor to critical diatribes of political corruption and social issues. It shares lyrical similarities to Stevie Wonder's anti-Nixon song [...] "You Haven't Done Nothin'" [...] (1974). The album concludes with a reprisal of the opening track. Music writer Karl Keely said of its significance, [...] "The return of the refrain from 'Peace Go with You Brother' adds a sense of wholeness to end the record, an idea that the album has travelled through Gil Scott-Heron's worries, fears, pleasures, hopes, and finally, his pronounced disliking of Richard Nixon, before returning to the opening statement, in the hopes that the record may have made that selfish brother think more about his world and those in it, instead of moving <b>along</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> self-imposed bubble." ...|$|E
500|$|A promotional {{music video}} was {{produced}} {{to accompany the}} release of [...] "Do or Die" [...] as a single. The video was directed by Jake & Jim who also directed the video for the group's previous single, [...] "Fire in My Heart". The video begins with the camera zooming in {{through the door of}} a cartoon house in the desert to reveal Super Furry Animals playing along to the track in a room. The band's heads and instruments are live action footage, filmed in London, while their bodies and surroundings are brightly coloured animations. During the first verse, shots of the group playing the track in the room are intercut with images of band members on cartoon surfboards superimposed onto real life footage of giant waves. This process is repeated during the second chorus, with the video cutting between shots of the band playing in the room and images of the band superimposed onto live footage of tornados. After 1 minute and 4 seconds images of the group's heads being swept <b>along</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> lava flow are intercut with the band playing along with the track in the now red room with lava visible through the windows. Snow then begins to fall in the room and the video cuts to shots of the group eascaping an avalanche in a bobsled. As the track ends the lightbulb in the room begins to swing frantically and Super Furry Animals are bathed in a green [...] "radioactive or alien glow". A shot of the house in front of a nuclear explosion cuts to footage of the band frozen mid-word, with the camera moving through 360 degrees to reveal them as two dimensional cutouts. The [...] "Do or Die" [...] music video was named as 'Video of the week' in the 12–18 January issue of Melody Maker and was included on the DVD release of the band's greatest hits album, [...]|$|E

2500|$|The {{geometer}} moths are moths {{belonging to}} the family Geometridae of the insect order Lepidoptera, the moths and butterflies.

In an enthusiastic review, The Source gave it the first perfect rating in the magazine's history, and called it a [...] "completely musical and spiritual approach to hip-hop," [...] as well as [...] "a voyage {{to the land of}} positive vibrations, and each cut is a new experience". Chuck Eddy from Rolling Stone stated [...] "the real pleasure on People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm comes from a detailed mesh of instruments and incidental sounds", but went on to say [...] "the rappers of A Tribe Called Quest tend to mumble in understated monotones that feel self-satisfied, even bored".|$|E
