500|$|Fellow footballer Vic Richardson {{wrote in}} 1968 that Nash [...] "was {{faster than any}} player I have seen in getting the ball moving to players running on. Add his high marking ability and speed to his quick {{thinking}} <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> player who practically originated today's style of play and one who would be unbeatable at it." ...|$|E
500|$|Time {{contributor}} James Poniewozik {{wrote that}} [...] "Black Light Attack!" [...] presented the balance 30 Rock [...] "has reached with Liz Lemon's character, {{allowing her to}} be simultaneously nerdy/awkward... and strong... Throw in {{a steady stream of}} solid throwaway jokes... <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> worthy toofer." [...] Nick Catucci for New York magazine enjoyed the episode, particularly Jenna's line [...] "Would a mother be going on a sex tour of Vietnam?", after telling Liz about her booked role as a mother on Gossip Girl, as a [...] "classic Jenna line, more absurd than hilarious", and that the character's rendition of [...] "Forever Young" [...] was a highlight. Television columnist Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger opined that this episode [...] "made the best use yet of Cheyenne Jackson's Danny", and that he for once enjoyed [...] "Jenna's narcissism and self-delusion" [...] subplot, and her [...] "late attempt" [...] to seem young. [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad enjoyed [...] "Black Light Attack!", though, his only complain was that 30 Rock did not focus more on the fictional show TGS, and said he would [...] "like to get back to more of that." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Margaret Lyons remarked that this episode and [...] "Klaus and Greta" [...] were terrific, and what stood out from both airings [...] "was how much serialized plot these two eps covered... For a show that's usually so episodic, it was an interesting—totally successful—change of pace." ...|$|E

60|$|Take {{a gentle}} woman, betray her trust, outrage her best feelings, drive her into <b>a</b> corner, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> fury! Take a gentle, trustful man, abuse him, {{show him the}} folly of this {{gentleness}} and kindness, prove to him that it is weakness, drive him into <b>a</b> corner, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> savage! <b>And</b> it was this savage, with an Indian's memory, and an Indian's eye and ear, that suddenly confronted the blacksmith.|$|R
6000|$|... "Speak," [...] I continued, impatiently; [...] "I {{never like}} the {{appearance}} of acquiescence when the reality is not there; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> contradiction at your tongue's end." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, I understand; you had {{an office}} in Florence--after you gave up {{retailing}} bicycles on the public roads; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> partner, I think--a Miss Petherick, or Petherton, or Pennyfarthing, or something?' ...|$|E

You have two hundred a year; that's settled on you. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> thousand pounds the other day. Is that all gone yet?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I couldn't. I couldn't say {{but what}} you had been good and faithfull all through, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> perfect right to do it. There ain't any one to blame. He's behaved like a gentleman, and I can see now that he never thought of her, {{and that it was}} you all the while. Well, marry him, then! He's got the right, and so have you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} you said; I have forgotten. I never want to remember. Things about the Second Advent. Dreadful things. You said God was close at hand. Happily you spoke partly in Greek. I doubt if any of those {{children}} understood. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> kind of lapse--an aphasia. You mutilated the interrogation and you did not pronounce the benediction properly. You changed words and you put in words. One sat frozen--waiting for what would happen next." ...|$|E

50|$|Changes {{may start}} of the right foot or left foot, moving forward or backward. This makes four {{different}} types of changes. Combine two close changes <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> Box Step.|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{the first}} place," [...] Weiss said, [...] "what about that paper we signed? I can {{understand}} your wanting {{to hold it}} over us while we were at war. It was a fair weapon, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> right to it, but now we are united again you can see, of course, that although your name isn't on it, it would practically mean ruin to our interests if the other side once got hold of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What can {{you want}} to do on Mount Sinai?' murmured the prince rather pettishly. 'Now if it were Mount Lebanon, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> wish to employ yourself, there is an immense field! We might improve the {{condition}} of the people; we might establish manufactures, stimulate agriculture extend commerce get an appalto of the silk, buy it all up at sixty piastres per oke, and sell it at Marseilles at two hundred {{and at the same time}} advance the interests of true religion as much as you please.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's quite simple," [...] said Fisher. [...] "When {{you went}} across he was either alive or dead. If he was alive, {{it might be}} you who killed him, or why should you have held your tongue about his death? But if he was dead, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> reason for killing him, you might have held your tongue {{for fear of being}} accused." [...] Then after a silence he added, abstractedly: [...] "Cyprus is a {{beautiful}} place, I believe. Romantic scenery and romantic people. Very intoxicating for a young man." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I expect so," [...] he answered. [...] "At any rate, we {{will try}} it on. I think it is <b>an</b> {{ordinary}} train, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> right to take a ticket." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tea at {{four o'clock}} is another English custom <b>you</b> may <b>have</b> become {{addicted}} to, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> climb," [...] he said. [...] "Still, I'm afraid I can't guarantee it. Jimmy does the cooking." ...|$|R
6000|$|Her {{eyes turned}} away from him; she sighed softly to herself. [...] "You will be married some day," [...] she said. [...] "Will you do one kind thing more for me, Amelius, when I die? You {{remember}} my reading in the newspaper of the new invention for burning the dead--and my asking you about it. You said {{you thought it was}} better than burying, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> good mind to leave directions to be burnt instead of buried, when your time came.

60|$|It is a {{necessary}} result of {{the operation of the}} law of gravitation that the uppermost layer shall be the youngest and the lowest the oldest, and that the different beds shall be older at any particular point or spot in exactly the ratio of their depth from the surface. So that if they were upheaved afterwards, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> series of these different layers of mud, converted into sandstone, or limestone, as the case might be, you might be sure that the bottom layer was deposited first, and that the upper layers were formed afterwards.

6000|$|... "Some of us {{went out}} to {{strengthen}} {{a place in the}} parapet that was only one sandbag thick, where a man had been hit during the day.

All the while you were doing it, you dreaded to find yourself in the white glare of a searchlight, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> feeling that something would hit you suddenly from behind. I had to make up my mind not to look round, or I should have kept on looking round.... Also our chaps kept shooting over us, within a foot of one's head.

60|$|He {{scratched}} his mosquito bites. He felt very short-tempered. When the rain {{stopped and the}} sun shone, {{it was like a}} hothouse, seething, humid, sultry, breathless, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> strange feeling that everything was growing with a savage violence. The natives, blithe and childlike by reputation, seemed then, with their tattooing and their dyed hair, to have something sinister in their appearance; and when they pattered along at your heels with their naked feet you looked back instinctively. You felt they might at any moment come behind you swiftly and thrust a long knife between your shoulder blades. You could not tell what dark thoughts lurked behind their wide-set eyes. They had a little the look of ancient Egyptians painted on a temple wall, and there was about them the terror of what is immeasurably old.|$|E
6000|$|... had no {{force in}} a pork-raising country like that; {{but it was}} urged, and {{there must have been}} Democratic boys to urge it. Still, they must have been few in number, or else my boy did not know them. At any rate, they had no club, and the Whig boys always had a club. They had a Henry Clay Club in 1844, and they had Buckeye Clubs {{whenever}} there was an election for governor, and they had clubs at every exciting town or county or district election. The business of a Whig club among the boys was to raise ash flag-poles, in honor of Henry Clay's home at Ashland, and to learn the Whig songs and go about singing them. You had to have a wagon, too, and some of the club pulled while the others rode; it could be such a wagon as you went walnutting with; and you had to wear strands of buckeyes round your neck. Then you were a real Whig boy, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> right to throw fire-balls and roll tar-barrels for the bonfires on election nights.|$|E
5000|$|At that time, Jack Lanam, former {{curator of}} the East Liverpool Historical Society said, [...] "Take his {{paintings}} and put them together like a jigsaw puzzle, lay them out, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> city Liverpool." ...|$|R

50|$|The other {{cool thing}} about knowing your {{proportions}} {{is you can}} use them to draw a head in profile, too! Just extend your proportion lines across <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> great way to keep your head proportions consistent.|$|R
