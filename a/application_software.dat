5|$|DOS (Disk Operating System) was the {{operating}} system that brought the company its real success. IBM first approached Microsoft about its upcoming IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC) in July 1980. On August 12, 1981, after negotiations with Digital Research failed, IBM awarded a contract to Microsoft to provide {{a version of the}} CP/M operating system, which was set {{to be used in the}} IBM PC. For this deal, Microsoft purchased a CP/M clone called 86-DOS from Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products for less than US$100,000, which IBM renamed to IBM PC DOS. Microsoft did not have an operating system when they closed the deal with IBM and IBM had not done their homework. Due to potential copyright infringement problems with CP/M, IBM marketed both CP/M and PC DOS for US$240 and US$40, respectively, with PC DOS eventually becoming the standard because of its lower price. 35 of the company's 100 employees worked on the IBM project for more than a year. When the IBM PC debuted, Microsoft was the only company that offered operating system, programming language, and <b>application</b> <b>software</b> for the new computer.|$|E

25|$|Computer {{programs}} may be categorized along functional lines. The main functional categories are <b>application</b> <b>software</b> and system software. System software includes {{the operating system}} which couples computer hardware with <b>application</b> <b>software.</b> The purpose of the operating system is to provide {{an environment in which}} <b>application</b> <b>software</b> executes in a convenient and efficient manner. In addition to the operating system, system software includes embedded programs, boot programs, and micro programs. <b>Application</b> <b>software</b> designed for end users have a user interface. <b>Application</b> <b>software</b> not designed for the end user includes middleware, which couples one application with another. <b>Application</b> <b>software</b> also includes utility programs. The distinction between system software and <b>application</b> <b>software</b> is under debate.|$|E
