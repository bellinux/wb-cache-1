Typically, the role is filled by a Chaplain or Spiritual Counselor, but social workers or other persons, sometimes specially trained, may also serve. While not every patient will see a Chaplain on hospice, all hospices {{have to be able to}} provide regular and consistent Chaplain services. The Chaplain is available to provide spiritually supportive counseling, life review and may connect a patient with clergy they <b>are</b> <b>comfortable</b> with. At times the hospice Chaplain will officiate at a patient's funeral.|$|E

25|$|In 1983, Noel Tichy {{wrote that}} because we are all beings of habit we tend to repeat what we <b>are</b> <b>comfortable</b> with. He wrote {{that this is a}} trap that {{constrains}} our creativity, prevents us from exploring new ideas, and hampers our dealing with the full complexity of new issues. He developed a systematic method of dealing with change that involved looking at any new issue from three angles: technical and production, political and resource allocation, and corporate culture.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, bullet or slug {{structures}} return the principal to investors {{in a single}} payment. The most common bullet structure is called the soft bullet, meaning that the final bullet payment is not guaranteed to be paid on the scheduled maturity date; however, {{the majority of these}} securitizations are paid on time. The second type of bullet structure is the hard bullet, which guarantees that the principal will be paid on the scheduled maturity date. Hard bullet structures are less common for two reasons: investors <b>are</b> <b>comfortable</b> with soft bullet structures, and they are reluctant to accept the lower yields of hard bullet securities in exchange for a guarantee.|$|E

25|$|In some localities {{strippers}} {{are required}} to obtain permits to work in adult entertainment. During a bikini performance, both breasts and genital areas typically remain covered by revealing attire, while dancers provide services and entertainment. Go-go dancers will retain their tops and bottoms {{for the duration of}} their performance. A female stripper whose upper body is exposed, but whose genital areas remain obscured during a performance, is said to be topless. Strippers who uncover the genital areas along with other clothing during a performance are said to be dancing fully nude. The fully nude practice is banned in many jurisdictions, but many dancers work around these constraints by selective uncovering of the vulva, anus, or both, for short periods of time, followed by immediate replacement of the clothing. Not all strippers <b>are</b> <b>comfortable</b> dancing topless or fully nude.|$|E
25|$|Not all {{transsexual}} people {{undergo a}} physical transition. Some find reasons not to; for example, {{the expense of}} surgery, the risk of medical complications, or medical conditions which make the use of hormones or surgery dangerous. Some may not identify strongly with another binary gender role. Others may find balance at a mid-point during the process, {{regardless of whether or}} not they are binary-identified. Many transsexual people, including binary-identified transsexual people, do not undergo genital surgery, because they <b>are</b> <b>comfortable</b> with their own genitals, or because they are concerned about nerve damage and the potential loss of sexual pleasure, including orgasm. This is especially so in the case of trans men, many of whom are dissatisfied with the current state of phalloplasty, which is typically very expensive, not covered by health insurance, and commonly does not achieve desired results. For example, not only does phalloplasty not result in a completely natural erection, it may not allow for an erection at all, and its results commonly lack penile sexual sensitivity; in other cases, however, phalloplasty results are satisfying for trans men. By contrast, metoidioplasty, which is more popular, is significantly less expensive and has far better sexual results.|$|E

[...] Preferring to lead by example, Iginla is not regarded as a vocal captain.

500|$|The first dance, [...] "Augurs of Spring", is characterised by a {{repetitive}} stamping chord in {{the horns}} and strings, based on E superimposed on a triad of E, G and B.

The rhythm of the stamping is disturbed by Stravinsky's constant shifting of the accent, on and off the beat, before the dance ends in a collapse, as if from exhaustion.
