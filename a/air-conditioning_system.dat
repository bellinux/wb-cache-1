5|$|In 2006 it {{was unclear}} if Beth Israel, which had already been in {{difficult}} financial shape, would be allowed, or have the means, to re-build its synagogue. The building suffered further flood damage in July 2007 when thieves stole the copper tubing for the main <b>air-conditioning</b> <b>system.</b> They broke the water main, and water from the second floor flooded the building for three days, {{to a depth of}} three to four feet, before it was discovered. The property was put up for sale.|$|E
5|$|On 3 September 2004, Hyundai Rotem, Mitsui, RM Transit Technology and dU LexBuild {{received}} {{an order to}} refurbish all 396 carriages, costing S$142.7 million in total. The works included the refurbishment of interior fixtures, the addition of wheelchair spaces, the upgrading of onboard communications equipment, enhancement of the public announcement system, and general improvement of the cars' appearance. SMRT Corporation said the reasons for refurbishment were wear and damage of important components {{over the past two}} decades and water leaks from the <b>air-conditioning</b> <b>system</b> on some trains. The company chose this option instead of buying new rolling stock, which would have cost S$792 million. The first refurbished train began revenue service on 5 November 2006, and all remaining trainsets had been refurbished by the end of 2008.|$|E
5|$|The Mitsubishi Electric {{propulsion}} system was retained, having performed better than expected. The wheelchair space was made {{available on the}} end of two mid-train cars, nearest to the lifts in above-ground stations. LED displays that blink to warn passengers of closing doors were introduced in the upper middle section of the door. Additional loudspeakers and advertisement panels were also introduced. Hand grips were moved to the support bars of the seats on the ceiling and grabpoles were located near the doors and at both ends of each carriage. The <b>air-conditioning</b> <b>system</b> was modified to match the system used in the C751B cars, with air-conditioning vents and in-flow fans installed.|$|E

25|$|A small {{fleet of}} Atlanteans also crossed the Atlantic, {{entering}} service in New York City. The double-deckers arrived in 1976, but proved problematic. After finally getting the too-tall buses from the docks, {{it was discovered}} that their height made them unsuitable for use on Fifth Avenue, and due to an underdimensioned <b>air-conditioning</b> <b>system</b> they could not be operated in the height of summer. New York's heavily potholed roads also took a toll, and after the Atlanteans spent most of their time being repaired the fleet was quietly withdrawn in 1980.|$|E

25|$|The air {{conditioning}} system on the new Insight has an expanded thermodynamic range compared to conventional systems. Unlike the separate low pressure and high pressure refrigerant pipes used in conventional systems, the Insight has its low pressure cold pipe enclosing the high pressure hot refrigerant pipe that allows the cold refrigerant on its {{way back to the}} engine bay to cool the warm refrigerant traveling to the cabin. A unique, spiral groove along the outside of the inner pipe increases the surface area and therefore the efficiency of the heat transfer between the outer and inner tubes. This improves the thermal efficiency of the <b>air-conditioning</b> <b>system</b> and, as a result, less effort is required from the compressor, resulting in improved fuel efficiency.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} has undergone many expansions. Most important were {{the construction of}} a new east wing in the early 20th century based on the plans of Anastasios Metaxas and {{the construction of a}} two-storeyed building, designed by George Nomikos, during 1932–1939. These expansions were necessary to accommodate the rapidly growing collection of artifacts. The most recent refurbishment of the museum took more than 1.5years to complete, during which the museum remained completely closed. It reopened in July 2004, in time for the Athens Olympics and it included an aesthetic and technical upgrade of the building, installation of a modern <b>air-conditioning</b> <b>system,</b> reorganisation of the museum's collection and repair of the damage caused by the 1999 earthquake. The Minoan frescoes rooms opened to the public in 2005. On May 2008 the Culture Minister Mihalis Liapis inaugurated the much anticipated collection of Egyptian antiquities and the collection of Eleni and Antonis Stathatos. Today, there is a renewed discussion regarding the need to further expand the museum to adjacent areas. A new plan has been made for a subterranean expansion at the front of the museum.|$|E

25|$|The 500 {{square meter}} {{facility}} of ABS-CBN Film Archives {{is covered with}} insulated walls. It has two film vaults: the medium-term vault and the long-term vault. The medium term vault holds betacam tapes, U-matic, 16mm negatives and prints, and some 35mm negatives and prints while the long-term vault holds the 35mm negatives and master prints. The facility is protected by a special fire suppression system. Acclimatization rooms are located between the vaults and the exit. Before a film could be taken out from the vault, it has {{to stay in the}} first acclimatization room for 24 hours and in the second acclimatization room for another 24 hours to prevent damage caused by condensation due to rapid temperature change. The temperature in the long-term vault is maintained between 8 and 10°C with 31 to 35 percent relative humidity while in the medium-term vault, the temperature is maintained between 15 and 20°C with 35 to 50 percent relative humidity. The <b>air-conditioning</b> <b>system</b> of the facility operates 24 hours a day. The facility is accessible to visitors for academic and research purposes.|$|E
25|$|The Main Roads Department {{building}} was purpose-designed, accommodating the Main Roads Department's diverse uses in repetitive and rationalised floor plates. Although offices and administration areas comprised the majority, the building also included: basement car parking; food facilities {{for the staff}} - a large cafeteria with kitchen, kiosk for snacks, and lunch room; staff training facilities - a large, double-height auditorium with the latest projection equipment; a technical and recreation library; a room for displaying models of major Main Roads projects, and; a large air-conditioning plant and a caretaker's flat. The {{building was}} designed to incorporate modern office technology. The department's technical and commercial electronic data processing divisions were accommodated in the basement, including their {{state of the art}} computer, the largest in Queensland at the time. The computer was serviced by a special, independent <b>air-conditioning</b> <b>system,</b> designed to keep the computer room at a constant temperature and humidity, with the heat generated by the computer absorbed by the ornamental ponds {{at the front of the}} building. A system of vacuum message tubes connected all sections of the building and there were telephones and a master clock system, CCTV, a teleprinter system, a Xerox machine, and a dumbwaiter for the movement of files between floors.|$|E
25|$|Maintaining a {{comfortable}} temperature inside {{such a large}} glass building was another major challenge, because the Great Exhibition took place decades before the introduction of mains electricity and air-conditioning. Glasshouses rely {{on the fact that}} they accumulate and retain heat from the sun, but such heat buildup would have been a major problem for the Exhibition, and this would have been exacerbated by the heat produced by the thousands of people who would be in the building at any given time. Paxton solved this with two clever strategies. One was to install external canvas shade-cloths that were stretched across the roof ridges. These served multiple functions - they reduced heat transmission, moderated and softened the light coming into the building, and acted as a primitive evaporative cooling system when water was sprayed onto them. The other part of the solution was Paxton's ingenious ventilation system. Each of the modules that formed the outer walls of the building was fitted with a prefabricated set of louvres that could be opened and closed using a gear mechanism, allowing hot stale air to escape. The flooring consisted of boards 22cm (9 inches) wide, which were spaced about 1cm apart; together with the louvres, this formed an effective passive <b>air-conditioning</b> <b>system.</b> Due to the pressure differential, the hot air escaping from the louvres generated a constant airflow that drew cooler air up through the gaps in the floor. The floor too had a dual function - the gaps between the boards acted as a grating that allowed dust and small pieces of refuse to fall or be swept through them onto the ground beneath, where it was collected daily by a team of cleaning boys. Paxton also designed machines to sweep the floors {{at the end of each}} day, but in practice, it was found that the trailing skirts of the female visitors did the job perfectly.|$|E
