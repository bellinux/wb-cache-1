5|$|The castle's layout {{was unusual}} for the region during this period, where the fortifications built by the Normans were {{typically}} smaller ringwork designs, and it highlighted both the strategic importance of the location <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> its builder.

5|$|C-SPAN has {{published}} ten books {{based on its}} programming; these contain original material and text taken from interview transcripts. The first C-SPAN book, C-SPAN: America's Town Hall, was published in 1988.

Five books have been drawn from the former Booknotes program: Booknotes: Life Stories; Booknotes: On American Character; Booknotes: Stories from American History; Booknotes: America's Finest Authors on Reading, Writing <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Power</b> <b>of</b> Ideas, the latter a compilation of short monologues taken from the transcripts of Lamb's interviews; and a companion book to the series on Tocqueville, Traveling Tocqueville's America: A Tour Book.|$|E
5|$|Caragiale's legal {{representative}} was the fellow writer Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea, who systematically disproved Caion's allegations, {{and noted that}} the absentee defendant was guilty of numerous forgeries. He also convinced the judge that the similarities between Năpasta <b>and</b> <b>The</b> <b>Power</b> <b>of</b> Darkness were superficial. The court found Ionescu-Caion guilty of slander. He was sentenced to a three-month jail term, a 500 lei fine and 10,000 lei in court costs. However, he appealed the tribunal's decision. The jury selection was a laborious process: Caion's lawyer Danielopol recused writers Nicolae Iorga and Ovid Densusianu, alleging that all Romanian literati had a vested interest to defend plagiarism. Iorga took offense, and reportedly challenged Danielopol to a duel. During the proceedings, Caion backed up on the original accusations, explaining that he had only invented a reason to bring Caragiale in for a trial. The court eventually acquitted Caion.|$|E

There also {{seemed to be a}} possibility that Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, might act to avenge his rejected aunt (Queen Catherine) and enforce the Pope's excommunication. It never came to anything but it brought to England Lutheran ideas: three sacraments only—baptism, Eucharist and penance—which Henry was prepared to countenance to maintain the possibility of an alliance.|$|E

5|$|On January 1, 1809, Martín de Álzaga rallied most peninsular battalions to Plaza de Mayo and {{attempted}} a mutiny against Liniers. A few criollos, such as Mariano Moreno, laid their hopes for independence in this attempt, but most did not. The battalions still faithful to Liniers – the Regiment of Patricians, the other criollo battalions, {{and the remaining}} peninsular ones – conquered the Plaza and ordered the mutinying forces to withdraw. Castelli supported Liniers, accusing Álzaga of independentism. Though Castelli was himself an independentist, and had also sought to remove Liniers, he opposed Álzaga for other reasons: Álzaga was hoping to maintaining the social dominance of the peninsulares over the criollos once the viceroy, who opposed his interests, was deposed. Álzaga was defeated, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> the criollos was increased: Sentenach and Álzaga were banished to Carmen de Patagones and the Spanish militias who attempted the coup were disbanded.|$|E
5|$|Several other {{geometrical}} {{solutions to}} Apollonius' problem {{were developed in}} the 19th century. The most notable solutions are those of Jean-Victor Poncelet (1811) and of Joseph Diaz Gergonne (1814). Whereas Poncelet's proof relies on homothetic centers of circles <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> a point theorem, Gergonne's method exploits the conjugate relation between lines and their poles in a circle. Methods using circle inversion were pioneered by Julius Petersen in 1879; {{one example is the}} annular solution method of HSM Coxeter. Another approach uses Lie sphere geometry, which was developed by Sophus Lie.|$|E

5|$|Big Brother 11 was {{broadcast}} on CBS from July 9, 2009 to September 15, 2009. This season lasted {{a total of}} 73 days, making it the third shortest season of the series to date. This season featured no changes to the schedule {{that was used in}} the previous edition, with episodes airing on Tuesdays, Thursday, and Sunday each week. The Thursday episode, which aired at 9 PM Eastern time, featured the live eviction and subsequent Head of Household competition taking place. During the live eviction, the show was hosted by Julie Chen. The Sunday episode, which aired at 8 PM Eastern time, featured the food competition and nomination ceremony, as well as some highlights from the previous days. The Tuesday episode featured the Power of Veto competition <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Power</b> <b>of</b> Veto ceremony, along with more highlights of recent events in the game. Some changes to the scheduling format were made. Chima's expulsion from the game, for example, led to various changes in the formatting of the television broadcasts, and led to the cancellation of the upcoming Double Eviction week. The series {{was broadcast}} on Global Television Network in Canada. For {{the first time in the}} history of the show, Big Brother had a two-hour live season finale, which aired on September 15, an increase from the usual hour.|$|E
5|$|DuMont {{aspired to}} grow beyond its three stations, {{applying}} for new television station licenses in Cincinnati and Cleveland in 1947. This {{would give the}} network five owned-and-operated stations (O), the maximum allowed by the FCC at the time. However, DuMont was hampered by Paramount's two stations, KTLA (channel 5) in Los Angeles and WBKB (channel 4, now WBBM-TV on channel 2) in Chicago – {{the descendants of the}} two experimental stations that rankled DuMont in 1940. Although these stations did not carry DuMont programming (with the exception of KTLA for one year from 1947 to 1948), and in fact competed against DuMont's affiliates in those cities, the FCC ruled that Paramount essentially controlled DuMont, which effectively placed the network at the five-station cap. Paramount's exertion of influence over the network's management <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> its voting stock brought the FCC to its conclusion. Thus, DuMont was unable to open additional stations as long as Paramount owned stations or owned a portion of DuMont. Paramount refused to sell.|$|E
5|$|In 1986 News International owner Rupert Murdoch caused {{controversy}} when {{he moved}} publication of The Times and The Sun away from Fleet Street to new premises in Wapping, East London. Murdoch believed {{it was impossible to}} produce a newspaper profitably on Fleet Street <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> the print unions, the National Graphical Association (NGA) and the Society of Graphical and Allied Trades (SOGAT), was too strong (an opinion endorsed by the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher). All Fleet Street print staff were sacked and new staff from the Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications and Plumbing Union were brought in to operate the presses at Wapping using modern computer-operated technology, rendering the power of the old unions obsolete. The resulting Wapping dispute featured violent protests at Fleet Street and Wapping that lasted over a year, but ultimately other publishers followed suit and moved out of Fleet Street towards Canary Wharf or Southwark. Reuters was the last major news outlet to leave Fleet Street in 2005. The same year, The Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph announced they were returning to the centre of London from Canary Wharf to new premises in Victoria in 2006.|$|E

5|$|In 788, Staurakios is {{recorded}} as attending {{as a judge}} in the bride show for the 17-year-old Constantine VI, along with Irene and the young Byzantine emperor himself. Maria of Amnia was chosen, although Constantine was unhappy about the breaking up of his earlier betrothal with Rotrude, Charlemagne's daughter. From this point on, he began to resent his mother's control over state affairs <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> her eunuch officials. Along with a few trusted conspirators, Constantine planned to arrest Staurakios and exile him to Sicily, while he would assume his position as effective co-ruler of the Byzantine Empire. Their plans were preempted by Staurakios, however: he persuaded Irene to arrest, torture, exile or imprison Constantine's associates, while Constantine himself was placed under house arrest. Next, Irene demanded of the army an oath of loyalty, whose wording placed her before her son in precedence. This demand provoked a mutiny by the soldiers of the Armeniac Theme, which then spread throughout the Anatolian armies, which assembled in Bithynia and demanded Emperor Constantine's release. Bowing to their pressure, Irene capitulated and Constantine was installed as sole ruler in December 790. Among Constantine's first acts was to have Staurakios flogged, tonsured, and exiled to the Armeniac Theme, while all other eunuch officials were likewise exiled.|$|E
5|$|Martín de Álzaga began a mutiny {{to remove}} Liniers. On January1, 1809, an open cabildo (an {{extraordinary}} meeting of vecinos, prominent {{people of the}} city) chaired by Álzaga demanded the resignation of Liniers and {{the appointment of a}} local junta. The Spanish militia and a group of people summoned by the meeting gathered to support the rebellion. A small number of criollos, notably Mariano Moreno, supported the mutiny, but most of them did not. They felt that Álzaga wanted to remove the Viceroy to avoid his political authority while keeping the social differences between criollos and peninsulars unchanged. The riot was quickly routed when criollo militias led by Cornelio Saavedra surrounded the plaza and dispersed the insurgents. As a result of the failed mutiny, the rebel militias were disarmed. This included all peninsular militias, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> the criollos increased as a result. The leaders of the plot, with the exception of Moreno, were exiled to Carmen de Patagones. Javier de Elío freed them and gave them political asylum at Montevideo.|$|E
5|$|The Right to Freedom of Religion, {{covered in}} Articles 25–28, {{provides}} religious freedom to all citizens and ensures a secular state in India. According to the Constitution, {{there is no}} official State religion, and the State is required to treat all religions impartially and neutrally. Article 25 guarantees all persons the freedom of conscience {{and the right to}} preach, practice and propagate any religion of their choice. This right is, however, subject to public order, morality and health, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> <b>of</b> the State to take measures for social welfare and reform. The right to propagate, however, does not include the right to convert another individual, since it would amount to an infringement of the other's right to freedom of conscience. Article 26 guarantees all religious denominations and sects, subject to public order, morality and health, to manage their own affairs in matters of religion, set up institutions of their own for charitable or religious purposes, and own, acquire and manage property in accordance with law. These provisions do not derogate from the State's power to acquire property belonging to a religious denomination. The State is also empowered to regulate any economic, political or other secular activity associated with religious practice. Article 27 guarantees that no person can be compelled to pay taxes for the promotion of any particular religion or religious institution. Article 28 prohibits religious instruction in a wholly State-funded educational institution, and educational institutions receiving aid from the State cannot compel any of their members to receive religious instruction or attend religious worship without their (or their guardian's) consent.|$|E
