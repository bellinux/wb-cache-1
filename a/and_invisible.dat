5|$|Another form of {{the goddess}} in the Tantrasara {{describes}} her seated in her own navel, formless <b>and</b> <b>invisible.</b> This form {{is said to be}} realised only via a trance. Another aniconic representation of the goddess is her yantra (a mystical geometrical diagram used in Tantric rituals), which figures the inverted triangle and lotus found in her iconography.|$|E
5|$|Looking {{directly}} at the photosphere of the Sun (the bright disk of the Sun itself), even {{for just a few}} seconds, can cause permanent damage to the retina of the eye, because of the intense visible <b>and</b> <b>invisible</b> radiation that the photosphere emits. This damage can result in impairment of vision, up to and including blindness. The retina has no sensitivity to pain, and the effects of retinal damage may not appear for hours, so there is no warning that injury is occurring.|$|E
5|$|Most enemies will flee at {{the sight}} of the vehicle, {{eliminating}} the need for Batman to fight them, and enemies attacking the car can be subdued by its automated taser defenses. Like Batman, the Batmobile can be upgraded with new abilities. Riddler challenges also feature objectives requiring the Batmobile, such as timed races in tunnels beneath Gotham City, where the environmental obstacles change during each lap, <b>and</b> <b>invisible</b> question marks that must be revealed using the Batmobile's scanner.|$|E

5|$|The Four {{from the}} Fantastick: A band of explorers who gained powers when their ship {{encountered}} a strange energy vortex at sea. The four are Captain Benjamin Grimm, Sir Richard Reed, Susan Storm, and John Storm, Their bodies were reshaped into the four elements: Reed's flesh became pliable like water; Grimm's body became solid rock; Susan's body became weightless <b>and</b> <b>invisible</b> like air; and John's body became living fire. They are eventually captured by Doom.|$|E
5|$|André conferred with General Clinton, {{who gave}} him broad {{authority}} to pursue Arnold's offer. André then drafted instructions to Stansbury and Arnold. This initial letter opened a discussion on the types of assistance and intelligence that Arnold might provide, and included instructions for how to communicate in the future. Letters were to be passed through the women's circle that Peggy Arnold was a part of, but only Peggy would be aware that some letters contained instructions that were to {{be passed on to}} André, written in both code <b>and</b> <b>invisible</b> ink, using Stansbury as the courier.|$|E
5|$|Cores {{are often}} drilled {{in areas such}} as Antarctica and central Greenland where the {{temperature}} is almost never warm enough to cause melting, but the summer sun can still alter the snow. In polar areas, the sun is visible day and night during the local summer <b>and</b> <b>invisible</b> all winter. It can make some snow sublimate, leaving the top inch or so less dense. When the sun approaches its lowest point in the sky, the temperature drops and hoar frost forms on the top layer. Buried under the snow of following years, the coarse-grained hoar frost compresses into lighter layers than the winter snow. As a result, alternating bands of lighter and darker ice can be seen in an ice core.|$|E

5|$|Supernatural forces pervaded Maya life, and {{influenced}} {{every aspect}} {{of it from the}} simplest day-to-day activities such as food preparation, to trade, politics, and elite activities. Maya deities governed all aspects of the world, both visible <b>and</b> <b>invisible.</b> The Maya priesthood was a closed group, drawing its members from the established elite; by the Early Classic they were recording increasingly complex ritual information in their hieroglyphic books, including astronomical observations, calendrical cycles, history and mythology. The priests performed public ceremonies that incorporated feasting, bloodletting, incense burning, music, ritual dance, and, on certain occasions, human sacrifice. During the Classic period, the Maya ruler was the high priest, and the direct conduit between mortals and the gods. It is highly likely that, among commoners, shamanism continued in parallel to state religion. By the Postclassic, religious emphasis had changed; there was an increase in worship of the images of deities, and more frequent recourse to human sacrifice.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two basic}} types of masquerades, visible <b>and</b> <b>invisible.</b> The visible masquerades are meant for the public. They often are more entertaining. Masks used offer a visual appeal for their shapes and forms. In these visible masquerades, {{performances}} of harassment, music, dance, and parodies are acted out (Oyeneke 25).|$|E
25|$|In 1865, John Tyndall {{described}} {{radiation from}} electrically heated filaments and from carbon arcs as visible <b>and</b> <b>invisible.</b> Tyndall spectrally decomposed the radiation {{by use of}} a rock salt prism, which passed heat as well as visible rays, and measured the radiation intensity {{by means of a}} thermopile.|$|E

25|$|Accordingly, in {{many parts}} of Greece, offerings of honey, oil, milk, but never of wine, and {{sometimes}} sacrifices of a lamb or goat were presented to these divinities. In Sicily was commemorated an annual celebration in their honor.
