Three CMV <b>antigens,</b> <b>captured</b> on the solid phase by three monoclonal antibodies of different specificities, designated CH 92 - 1, CH 65 - 1, and CH 16 - 1, were glycoproteins A (gA), gC, and gD, respectively; and one <b>antigen,</b> <b>captured</b> by CH 23, was a polypeptide with an apparent molecular weight of 150, 000, possibly {{associated with the}} nucleocapsid. Of these four CMV <b>antigens,</b> gA <b>captured</b> by CH 92 - 1 was most effective in eliciting an antibody response. Antibody to this antigen was present in serum samples at a higher concentration in primary and reactivated infection and persisted longer than did antibody to the other tested antigens. In contrast, antibody to <b>antigen</b> <b>captured</b> by CH 23 was at a lower concentration, rose more slowly in infection, and persisted for a shorter time than did antibody to the other antigens. Antibody response to gC and gD was intermediate in concentration and temporal appearance compared with the antibody response to gA and to the polypeptide bound by CH 23. An enzyme immunoassay on paired serum samples with the <b>captured</b> glycoproteins as <b>antigen</b> was equal {{for the detection of}} current infection to an enzyme immunoassay with the whole CMV antigen from infected cell lysates.

An intricately choreographed expression program devoted to communication between cells was a prominent feature of the response.

40|$|SummaryB {{cells are}} {{activated}} in vivo after the B cell receptors (BCRs) bind to <b>antigens</b> <b>captured</b> on {{the surfaces of}} antigen-presenting cells. Antigen binding results in BCR microclustering and signaling; however, the molecular nature of the signaling-active BCR clusters is not well understood. Using single-molecule imaging techniques, we provide evidence that within microclusters, the binding of monovalent membrane antigens results in the assembly of immobile signaling-active BCR oligomers. The oligomerization depends on interactions between the membrane-proximal Cμ 4 domains of the membrane immunoglobulin that are both necessary and sufficient for assembly. Antigen-bound BCRs that lacked the Cμ 4 domain failed to cluster and signal, and conversely, Cμ 4 domains alone clustered spontaneously and activated B cells. These results support a unique mechanism for the initiation of BCR signaling in which antigen binding induces a conformational change in the Fc portion of the BCR, revealing an interface that promotes BCR clustering...|$|R

50|$|The methods {{combine the}} {{specificity}} of the Mabs for <b>antigen</b> <b>capture</b> and concentration with the sensitivity of a surround optical fiber detection technology. In contrast to previously described methods for detection of PrPSc in brain homogenates, these techniques, when used to study brain homogenates, do not use seeded polymerization, amplification, or enzymatic digestion (for example, by proteinase K, or “PK”). This is important in that previous reports have indicated the existence of PrPSc isoforms with varied PK sensitivity, which decreases reliability of the assay. The sensitivity of this assay makes it suitable as a platform for rapid prion detection assay in biological fluids.

40|$|The {{capacity}} of dendritic cells to initiate T cell responses {{is related to}} their ability to redistribute MHC class II molecules from the intracellular MHC class II compartments to the cell surface. This redistribution occurs during dendritic cell development as they are converted from an <b>antigen</b> <b>capturing,</b> immature dendritic cell into an MHC class II-peptide presenting mature dendritic cell.

This modification of CD 63 was accompanied by a change in morphology of MHC class II compartments from typical multivesicular organelles to structures containing densely packed lipid moieties.

40|$|An <b>antigen</b> <b>capture</b> {{immunoassay}} {{to detect}} West Nile (WN) virus antigen in infected mosquitoes and avian tissues has been developed.

In a blindly coded set of field-collected mosquito pools (n = 100), this assay detected WN virus antigen in 12 of 18 (66. 7 %) TaqMan-positive pools, whereas traditional reverse transcriptase PCR detected 10 of 18 (55. 5 %) positive pools. A sample set of 73 organ homogenates from naturally infected American crows was also examined by WN virus <b>antigen</b> <b>capture</b> immunoassay and TaqMan {{for the presence of}} WN virus. The <b>antigen</b> <b>capture</b> assay detected antigen in 30 of 34 (88. 2 %) TaqMan-positive tissues.

The recommended WN virus <b>antigen</b> <b>capture</b> protocol, which includes a capture assay followed by a confirmatory inhibition assay used to retest presumptive positive samples, could distinguish between the closely related WN and St. Louis encephalitis viruses in virus-infected mosquito pools and avian tissues.

However, their interaction with the immune system offers an intriguing challenge {{to the success of}} nanotherapeutics in vivo. Recently, we showed that pristine and derivatised carbon nanotubes (CNT) can activate complement mainly via the classical pathway leading to enhanced uptake by phagocytic cells, and transcriptional down-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Here, we report the interaction of complement-activating CMC-CNT and RNA-CNT, and non-complement-activating gold-nickel (Au–Ni) nanowires with cell lines representing macrophage, B and T cells. Complement deposition considerably enhanced uptake of CNTs by immune cells known to overexpress complement receptors. Real-Time qPCR and multiplex array analyses showed complement-dependent down-regulation of TNF-α and IL- 1 β and up-regulation of IL- 12 by CMC- and RNA-CNTs, in addition to revealing IL- 10 as a crucial regulator during nanoparticle-immune cell interaction.

Molecular dynamic models identified flexible areas of the CD 1 b heavy chain in the superior and lateral walls of the A′ pocket. In these same areas, residues that carry charge in a pH-dependent manner (D 60, E 62) were found to tether the rigid α 1 helix to flexible areas of the α 2 helix and the 50 - 60 loop. After disruption of these tethers with acid pH or mutation, we observed increased association and dissociation of lipids with CD 1 b and preferential presentation of antigens with bulky lipid tails.
