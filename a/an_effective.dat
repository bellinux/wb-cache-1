5|$|Antiandrogens such as {{cyproterone}} acetate and spironolactone {{have been}} used successfully to treat acne, especially in women with signs of excessive androgen production such as increased hairiness or skin production of sebum, or baldness. Spironolactone is <b>an</b> <b>effective</b> treatment for acne in adult women, but unlike combination oral contraceptives, is not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for this purpose. The drug is primarily used as an aldosterone antagonist and {{is thought to be}} a useful acne treatment due to its ability to block the androgen receptor at higher doses. It may be used with or without an oral contraceptive. Hormonal therapies should not be used to treat acne during pregnancy or lactation as they have been associated with birth disorders such as hypospadias, and feminization of the male fetus or infant.

40|$|Objectives : We {{performed}} {{this study}} {{in order to}} investigate the effects of Sedang-hwan(세당환(世糖丸)) on the diabetes mellitus. Methods : We injected a vein with 65 mg/kg of streptozotocin(STZ) on the rats. And then administered Sedang-hwan; 18. 7 mg/kg/day to sample groups and observed the weight and glucose level, insulin, C-peptide, triglyceride, albumin, T-protein, BUN(Blood Urea Nitrogen) and creatinine in blood. Results : 1. The sample groups showed a high supppressive effect of weight loss(P= 0. 002). 2. The sample groups'glucose level showed <b>a</b> <b>effective</b> in lowering level(P= 0. 001). 3. The sample groups showed a higher insulin level than control groups. 4. The sample groups showed a higher C-peptide level than control groups(P= 0. 001). 5. The sample groups' triglyceride level showed <b>a</b> <b>effective</b> in lowering level. 6. The sample groups showed a higher HDL-cholesterol level than control groups(p< 0. 001). 7. The sample groups showed a higher T-protein level than control groups(P= 0. 04). 8. The sample groups showed a higher albumin level than control groups(p< 0. 001). 9. The sample groups' creatinine level showed <b>a</b> <b>effective</b> in lowering level(P= 0. 04). 10. The sample groups' BUN level showed <b>a</b> <b>effective</b> in lowering level(P= 0. 03). Conclusions : Conclusively, Sedang-hwan was recognized to have decrease effect of serum glucose, triglyceride, creatinine, BUN of the diabetic rats induced by streptozotocin.
