25|$|During the {{preparation}} for the appeal trial, bias allegations were also made on the court of appeal. In Swedish <b>appeal</b> <b>proceedings</b> for criminal cases where the sentence is greater than a fine, the court usually consists of three professional judges and two lay judges. Judge Ihrfelt, again appointed to the case, informed the parties in mid September 2009 {{that one of the}} appointed lay judges is working for the music streaming service Spotify, which is partly owned by record companies. The lay judge himself didn't feel biased because of his work, but prosecuting attorney Danowsky commented that anyone both judging the case and working for Spotify has a conflict of interest. Later on the same week, defense attorney Samuelsson submitted allegations to the appeal court of Ihrfelt and another professional judge being biased for their membership in the same interest groups judge Norström was investigated for. In the court's opinion, the judges' memberships did not constitute bias, whereas the lay judges's impartiality was questionable and he was dismissed. The court's decision was appealed, and in May 2010 the supreme court affirmed the appeal court's decision on the bias question.|$|E

This paper surveys European antitrust policy since the grounds for its implementation were laid in 1962. To that end, it presents a number of summary statistics on European antitrust policy based on data collected from official records on all published antitrust decisions by the European Commission's Directorate-General Competition, the first being from 1964. These statistics include key figures such as {{the total number of}} cases per year and their duration over time, the nature of infringements, the level of imposed fines, and the commissioner responsible for the decision. Subsequently, those decisions of DG Competition to which an appeal was lodged with the Court of First Instance / Court of Justice of the European Communities are studied in more detail. Considered are issues such as the grounds for appeal, revisions, and probabilities of success depending on characteristics such as the type of infringement originally found, the duration and length of the <b>appeals</b> <b>proceedings</b> {{and the president of the}} appeals court. Findings include some remarkable significant effects on the probability of revision, as well as some comforting neutrality results...|$|R

The data cover all antitrust decisions by the European Commission decided under Articles 81 and 82 resulting into an appeal proceeding.

Issues such as the grounds for appeal, revisions of the original decision, the duration and length of the <b>appeals</b> <b>proceedings</b> and probabilities of success depending on characteristics such as the type of infringement originally found are considered.
