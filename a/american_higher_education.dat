25|$|Although {{the strike}} {{was a failure}} in {{that it did not}} win {{reinstatement}} for the faculty, the strike established the AFT as the pre-eminent union organizing <b>American</b> <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> faculty. Kugler quickly turned the UFCT's attention to other colleges and universities in the New York City area. In the next few years, under his leadership the union organized locals at the Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT), Nassau Community College and Westchester Community College. In 1967, Kugler began pushing for the UFCT to organize the faculty at CUNY. Backed by the AFT and the newly formed (and politically powerful) United Federation of Teachers, UFCT not only won an agreement for a union election but won the December 6, 1968, election {{in the face of a}} determined challenge from the AAUP.

2500|$|It was the Hudson Valley {{that gave}} birth to – and nurtured – the first {{successful}} attempts in America to raise applied science and technology to a collegiate level. The first technical college in the United States, the military academy at West Point, was created by Congress in 1802. [...] The institution that eventually became Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) was founded in Troy, New York, in 1824 and incorporated in 1826 (and of which Union College president Eliphalet Nott was also president from 1829 to 1845). [...] Union College introduced a parallel scientific curriculum in 1828 and a civil engineering program in 1845. [...] Union College, it has been said, was the [...] "one traditional liberal arts college {{in the first half of}} the nineteenth century to make a thoroughly uncompromising and effective place for applied science in the course of study". [...] In fact, so successful were Union's reform efforts that by 1839 the College had one of the largest faculty in <b>American</b> <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> and an enrollment surpassed only by Yale.|$|E
2500|$|Professor Marty Kaplan of the USC Annenberg School for Communication further argued that, [...] "the {{problem with}} U.S. News' college rankings isn't that {{institutions}} of higher education shouldn't be held accountable for the quality of services they provide [...] The problem is that the fierce competition among colleges to raise their rankings torques the priorities of colleges toward the criteria that U.S. News uses [...] So this week, when an association of 80 liberal arts college presidents, including Barnard, Sarah Lawrence and Kenyon, announced that a majority of them would no longer participate in the U.S. News annual survey, and that they would fashion their own way to collect and report common data, it was bad news for the magazine, but good news for families. It's also good news for <b>American</b> <b>higher</b> <b>education,</b> some of whose institutions may now become less timid about accepting the quirky applicant, less nuts about generating journalistic puff pieces, and more bold about declaring (and living up to) unique educational missions that don't derive from focus groups.|$|E
