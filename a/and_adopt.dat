5|$|One major {{advantage}} Manchester has is that, {{unlike most}} major {{cities in the}} UK, there are no height restrictions <b>and</b> <b>adopt</b> a laissez-faire attitude towards city centre high rises.

Several residential, hotel and office developments are under construction or have recently been built in the city centre, including the Beetham Tower.|$|E
5|$|The British Army {{tried to}} learn {{the lessons of the}} First World War, <b>and</b> <b>adopt</b> them into its pre-war doctrine. In the 1920s, and much of the 1930s, the General Staff tried to {{establish}} a small, mechanised, professional army and formed the Experimental Mechanized Force but, with the lack of any identified threat, its main function reverted to garrison duties around the British Empire.|$|E
5|$|This holding {{was based}} upon the well-understood {{governmental}} policy of encouraging the Indian to forgo his wandering habits <b>and</b> <b>adopt</b> those of civilized life; and {{it was said that}} to hold that by so doing he acquired no possessory rights to the lands occupied, to which the government would accord protection, would be contrary to the whole spirit of the traditional American policy toward these dependent wards of the nation. The fact that such right of occupancy finds no recognition in any statute or other formal governmental action is not conclusive.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternative}} design {{completed by}} McDonnell Aircraft in 1965 is usually {{considered part of}} Project Isinglass, however some documents refer to the aircraft as having been codenamed Project Rheinberry. McDonnell's proposed boost-glide aircraft, submitted to the CIA independently of the Convair Isinglass proposals, featured a small, manned, rocket-powered craft with a high lift-to-drag ratio that would be air-launched by a B-52 bomber while flying over the Atlantic Ocean. The aircraft would ignite its rocket engine <b>and</b> <b>adopt</b> a trajectory that would take it over the Soviet Union at speeds of Mach 20 and {{at an altitude of}} over , before descending over the Pacific Ocean to a landing at Groom Lake, Nevada, as a glider, landing on the lake bed using a skid landing gear.|$|E
5|$|Compared to B-DNA, the A-DNA form is a wider {{right-handed}} spiral, with a shallow, wide minor groove and a narrower, deeper major groove. The A form occurs under non-physiological {{conditions in}} partly dehydrated samples of DNA, {{while in the}} cell it may be produced in hybrid pairings of DNA and RNA strands, and in enzyme-DNA complexes. Segments of DNA where the bases have been chemically modified by methylation may undergo a larger change in conformation <b>and</b> <b>adopt</b> the Z form. Here, the strands turn about the helical axis in a left-handed spiral, {{the opposite of the}} more common B form. These unusual structures can be recognized by specific Z-DNA binding proteins and may be involved in the regulation of transcription.|$|E
5|$|Convict {{cichlids}} {{may show}} extended biparental care <b>and</b> <b>adopt</b> unrelated young {{of the same}} species of similar or smaller body size compared to their own biological offspring. The parents may benefit by adopting smaller young by taking advantage of the dilution effect, which is when the risk of predation for an individual is reduced because the group size is larger. Another reason that has been considered is that foreign young that are larger than the biological offspring may be a direct predatory threat to them. However, {{it has been shown that}} as the biological offspring develop and become stronger swimmers, the parents are less active about rejecting larger foreign young, but when they do reject, often foreign young are rejected before they are large enough to be perceived as a direct threat to the biological offspring. Thus, it can be concluded that the brood adoption and rejection rely more heavily on the protection of the biological offspring from differential predator instead of from larger adopted cichlids.|$|E

5|$|During {{his reign}} as emperor, Caracalla raised the annual pay {{of an average}} legionary from 2000 sesterces (500 denarii) to 2700–3000 sesterces (675–750 denarii). He lavished many {{benefits}} on the army, which he both feared and admired, {{in accordance with the}} advice given by his father on his deathbed always to heed the welfare of the soldiers and ignore everyone else. Caracalla needed to gain and keep the trust of the military, and he did so with generous pay raises and popular gestures. He spent much of his time with the soldiers, so much so that he began to imitate their dress <b>and</b> <b>adopt</b> their manners.|$|E
5|$|During the arc, Rukia's past is explored. She died as {{an infant}} and was sent to Soul Society with her older sister, Hisana. Though Hisana {{initially}} tried to protect and provide for Rukia, she could not ensure her own survival while caring for a baby as well, and thus abandoned Rukia. As Rukia grew up, she befriended Renji Abarai, and entered the Soul Reaper academy, where she was adopted into the Kuchiki family. One year prior to the adoption, Hisana died after asking her husband, Byakuya, to find <b>and</b> <b>adopt</b> Rukia as his sister. This remains unknown to Rukia until Byakuya confesses it to her. When she was accepted into the 13th Division, Rukia befriended the lieutenant of her division, Kaien Shiba, and trained under him. During {{the course of a}} mission, Kaien was irreversibly possessed by a hollow and Rukia inadvertently kills him.|$|E
5|$|Non-bluffing (aposematic) {{displays}} {{occur in}} mammals which possess powerful defences such as spines or stink glands, and which habitually warn off potential predators rather than attempting escape by running. The lowland streaked tenrec (Hemicentetes semispinosus) raises the spines {{on its head}} and back when confronted by a predator, and moves its head up and down. Porcupines such as Erethizon erect their long sharp quills <b>and</b> <b>adopt</b> a hunched, head-down posture when a predator is nearby. The spotted skunk (Spilogale putorius) balances on its front legs, its body raised vertically with its bold pelage pattern conspicuously displayed, and its tail (near the scent glands) raised and spread out.|$|E

5|$|That evening Napoleon and {{the four}} merchants {{discussed}} the revolution, subsequent rebellions, and their consequences. Speaking as a pro-Republican, Napoleon supported the Jacobin cause, and explained {{the benefits of the}} revolution, whilst defending Carteaux's actions in Avignon. One of the merchants from Marseille expressed his moderate views regarding the revolution, and reasons for supporting civil war against a central government. The merchant stressed that Marseille did not fight for the Royalist cause, but opposed the nature of the Convention itself, condemning its decrees and deeming the execution of citizens as unlawful. Napoleon concluded that the people of Marseille should reject counter-revolutionary ideals <b>and</b> <b>adopt</b> the constitution of the French Republic in order to end the civil war and allow the regular army to restore France.|$|E
