In the introducting part the author presents basic remarks on the essence of international control {{as one of the}} institutions securing effectiveness of norms of international law. This serves as grounds for stating an issue of international control for peaceful 'utilization of atomic energy with indicating specific features of control activities in that scope. Essential discussion is concentrated on questions of character of means of international control for peaceful utilization of atomic energy. Those problems are presented on a basis of cardinal outline of legal structure of control system of International Atomic Energy Agency, which consists of Agency Statute, Safeguards Document, Inspectors Document as well as 'provisions of relevant Safeguards Agreements. Upon a study odi basic regulation of international law concerning the IAEA control system it is indicated by the author that these provide a combination of two types of means of control i. e. means of disclosure and of verification. Particular attention is drawn by the author to functioning of the records system (accounting records, operating records), reports system (initial reports, inventory change reports, material balance reports, special reports) and the inspections system (<b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>inspections,</b> routine inspections, special inspections). The author also points ont at the possibilities of undertaking actions by the IAEA having character of sanctions in cases of ascertaining a breach of international agreements adopted by states in that scape.

40|$|The Physical Model (PM) is an {{internal}} multi-Volume document for the IAEA’s Department of Safeguards describing the nuclear fuel cycle. This report describes work {{carried out by}} the JRC with the IAEA to prototype the integration of the PM with The Big Table (TBT), a document search tool developed by the JRC and in use at the IAEA. The core of TBT is an integrated collection of reference documents including regulatory documents, technical handbooks and trade nomenclatures. The documents are stored in a database. They are searchable by text in a structured way (i. e. on database fields) and also by correspondence tables that relate items by their meaning. To integrate the Physical Model into TBT, the IAEA/SG/SGIM has first turned the PM into a tabular format. JRC has then proposed and implemented a way of coding the PM in TBT tables to better reflect the PM structure. Eleven PM Volumes have been integrated in a TBT-PM database for use by the IAEA. The PM Volumes are linked by correspondence tables to other documents in the TBT collection. By coding the Physical Model into a TBT database format, the original intended uses of the PM are still supported. TBT can ease the consultation of the PM for evaluating States’ nuclear activities by IAEA’s analysts. TBT can be an aid for IAEA’s inspectors preparing for routine and <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> <b>inspections,</b> design information verification visits and complementary access operations. Further the PM integrated into TBT {{can be used as a}} tool for training inspectors on steps of the nuclear fuel cycle. Finally implementing the Physical Model multi-level structure into a database-coded format opens the possibility of linking the PM to other taxonomies and collections of open sources relevant for safeguards analyses.

We define two <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> network categories, namely mobile <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> networks (MANETs) and smart sensor network, and discuss all further definitions and observations separately for both implementations. The main contribution of this report is the clear definition of properties, parameters, architectures, security requirements, and authentication models of <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> networks. Furthermore, we derive design goals for all protocols to be implemented in <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> networks. We also provide an extensive overview of present and future <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> network applications, used standards, and proposed solutions. We believe that the authentication of network nodes {{and the establishment of}} secret keys among nodes are both target security objectives in <b>ad</b> <b>hoc</b> networks.
