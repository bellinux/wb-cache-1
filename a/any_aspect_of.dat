5|$|Its generic name, Cleptornis, {{is derived}} from the Ancient Greek kleptes, a robber or thief, and ornis, a bird. This is not a {{reference}} to <b>any</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> the golden white-eye's behaviour, but to the old French name of the Mariana Islands, les Îles des Voleurs, or Robbers' Islands. The specific epithet marchei refers to the French explorer and writer Antoine-Alfred Marche, who procured the original specimens.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} can act on any heritable phenotypic trait, {{and selective}} pressure {{can be produced}} by <b>any</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> the environment, including sexual selection and competition {{with members of the}} same or other species. However, this does not imply that natural selection is always directional and results in adaptive evolution; natural selection often results in the maintenance of the status quo by eliminating less fit variants.|$|E

5|$|When some species, {{including}} Bathyctena chuni, Euplokamis stationis and Eurhamphaea vexilligera, are disturbed, {{they produce}} secretions (ink) that luminesce at {{much the same}} wavelengths as their bodies. Juveniles will luminesce more brightly {{in relation to their}} body size than adults, whose luminescence is diffused over their bodies. Detailed statistical investigation has not suggested the function of ctenophores' bioluminescence nor produced any correlation between its exact color and <b>any</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> the animals' environments, such as depth or whether they live in coastal or mid-ocean waters.|$|E
5|$|A 1948 {{review of}} the entire F-84 program {{discovered}} {{that none of the}} F-84B or F-84C aircraft could be considered operational or capable of executing <b>any</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> their intended mission. The program was saved from cancellation because the F-84D, whose production was well underway, had satisfactorily addressed the major faults. A fly-off against the F-80 revealed that while the Shooting Star had a shorter takeoff roll, better low altitude climb rate and superior maneuverability, the F-84 could carry a greater bomb load, was faster, had better high altitude performance and greater range. As a temporizing measure, the USAF in 1949 committed US$8million to implement over 100 upgrades to all F-84Bs, most notably reinforcing the wings. Despite the resultant improvements, the F-84B was withdrawn from active duty by 1952.|$|E
5|$|One notable academic, who {{is known}} for his work in Nanotechnology, is Ravi Silva. Ravi Silva is the current Director of the Advanced Technology Institute at the university. In 2003, he was awarded the Albert Einstein Silver Medal and the Javed Husain Prize by UNESCO for {{contributions}} to electronic devices. The 2011 Clifford Paterson Lecture was given by Silva for his outstanding contributions to basic science and engineering in the field of carbon nanoscience and nanotechnology. The lecture is given annually on <b>any</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> engineering. The General Electric Company Limited endowed the lecture in 1975 in honour of Clifford Paterson who undertook the creation of the GEC Research Laboratories in 1919. Other notable academics who have delivered the lecture include Frank Kelly and Richard Friend, both from the University of Cambridge.|$|E

5|$|The {{bank has}} gained its funding from {{different}} sources, {{and the main}} contributors have shifted over time. In the initial years, donor agencies used to provide the bulk of capital at low rates. By the mid-1990s, the bank started to get most of its funding from the central bank of Bangladesh. More recently, Grameen has started bond sales {{as a source of}} finance. The bonds are implicitly subsidised, as they are guaranteed by the Government of Bangladesh, and still they are sold above the bank rate. In 2013, Bangladesh parliament passed 'Grameen Bank Act' which replaces the Grameen Bank Ordinance, 1983, authorising the government to make rules for <b>any</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> the running of the bank.|$|E
5|$|In October 2006, the NSW Department of Local Government {{announced}} it would investigate the Council's financial management and would try {{to determine whether it}} properly considered the impact the added costs could have on its other functions. The investigation, which commenced on 6 November 2006, was conducted under Section 430 of the , which allows the Director-General of the Department to investigate <b>any</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> a Council or of its work or activities. The report, delivered in May 2007 to the Minister of Local Government, concluded that the Council did not exercise due diligence and {{that there had been a}} failure to scope the project, and recommended to the Minister that a Section 740 public inquiry, which would be independent and have some of the powers and protections of a Royal Commission, be held. A Section 740 inquiry is a necessary step before a Council can be dismissed.|$|E
5|$|Jonne Valtonen and Roger Wanamo, the arrangers for the Symphonic Fantasies and Symphonic Legends concerts, {{returned}} {{as the lead}} arrangers for the concert. Additional arrangements were made by Jani Laaksonen and Masashi Hamauzu, and Mikko Laine served as the lyricist for the choral components of the concert. Uematsu {{was not involved in}} <b>any</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> the production, even song selection, as he wanted to be surprised by the result. The style of arrangements followed {{in the tradition of the}} shows preceding Symphonic Odysseys, featuring a number of rich, sophisticated suites structured for melodic storytelling. A focus was put on presenting a balanced mix of fan favorites as well as lesser known material that was not commonly performed in orchestra concerts based on video game music. Böcker styled the concert to be a mix of Shades and Fantasies, in that there was a mix of shorter pieces with longer suites. The titles chosen to be featured in the concert were the Final Fantasy series, King's Knight, Chrono Trigger, the SaGa series, The Last Story, Blue Dragon, and Lost Odyssey. Additionally, Uematsu composed an original fanfare to open the concert, which was arranged by Jonne Valtonen.|$|E

25|$|According to {{the theory}} of evolution, {{polymorphism}} results from evolutionary processes, as does <b>any</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> a species. It is heritable and is modified by natural selection. In polyphenism, an individual's genetic make-up allows for different morphs, and the switch mechanism that determines which morph is shown is environmental. In genetic polymorphism, the genetic make-up determines the morph. Ants exhibit both types in a single population.|$|E
25|$|White's {{concurrence}} had {{the most}} immediate effect of <b>any</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> the decision. Many district courts began pointing to it to require litigants who had filed claims under the 1934 Act to arbitrate them, regardless of precedent in their circuits. Some declined to, noting that the Court had not considered the question and that Wilko still governed. This created another conflict in the circuits that the Court had to resolve.|$|E

25|$|Artificial {{life is the}} {{simulation}} of <b>any</b> <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> life, as through computers, robotics, or biochemistry. The study of artificial life imitates traditional biology by recreating some aspects of biological phenomena. Scientists study the logic of living systems by creating artificial environments—seeking to understand the complex information processing that defines such systems. While life is, by definition, alive, artificial life is generally referred to as data confined to a digital environment and existence.|$|E
25|$|Gay {{and lesbian}} {{adoption}} is widespread and is supported and encouraged in California law, providing evidence concerning same sex couples and parenting, with around 18% of same sex couples in California raising children.
