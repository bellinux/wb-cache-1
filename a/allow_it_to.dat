5|$|The {{bacterium}} Paenibacillus tylopili {{has been}} {{isolated from the}} mycorrhizosphere of T.felleus; this is the region around its subterranean hyphae where nutrients released from the fungus affect {{the activity of the}} microbial population in the soil. The bacterium excretes enzymes that <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> break down the biomolecule chitin.|$|E
5|$|The chase {{involving}} the double-decker bus was filmed with a second-hand London bus adapted {{by having a}} top section removed, and then placed back in situ running on ball bearings to <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> slide off on impact. The stunts {{involving the}} bus were performed by Maurice Patchett, a London Transport bus driving instructor.|$|E
5|$|The extraocular {{muscles of}} the walrus are well-developed. This and its lack of orbital roof <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> {{protrude}} its eyes and see in both a frontal and dorsal direction. However, vision in this species {{appears to be more}} suited for short-range.|$|E

5|$|In Japan, Waseda University {{initiated}} the WABOT project in 1967, and in 1972 completed the WABOT-1, the world's first full-scale intelligent humanoid robot, or android. Its limb control system <b>allowed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> walk {{with the lower}} limbs, and to grip and transport objects with hands, using tactile sensors. <b>Its</b> vision system <b>allowed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> measure distances and directions to objects using external receptors, artificial eyes and ears. And its conversation system <b>allowed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> communicate with a person in Japanese, with an artificial mouth.|$|R

5|$|The navy {{sees the}} battleships as prohibitively expensive, {{and is working}} to persuade Congress to <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> remove Iowa and Wisconsin from the Naval Vessel Register by {{developing}} extended-range guided munitions and a new ship to fulfill marine corps requirements for naval surface fire support (NSFS).|$|E
5|$|When it was {{initially}} rated as NC-17 by the MPAA, Babbit made cuts to <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be re-rated as R. When interviewed {{in the documentary}} film This Film Is Not Yet Rated Babbit criticized the MPAA for discriminating against films with gay content.|$|E
5|$|A Nintendo 3DS {{version of}} the game, titled 3D Sonic the Hedgehog, was {{released}} {{as part of the}} 3D Classics line in 2013. This version, unlike most downloadable re-releases of the game, is not emulated; rather, the game's code was restructured to <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> take advantage of the 3DS system's stereoscopic 3D graphics and comes with additional enhancements, such as the option to use the Spin Dash move, a CRT-style filter, and the option to start the game from any level.|$|E
50|$|Alpargatas {{relocated}} its {{manufacturing facilities}} {{to the southern}} suburb of Florencio Varela in 1950. This new, 70,000 m² (740,000 ft²) facility <b>allowed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> diversify its product line, leading to the launching of Flecha, its casual footwear brand, in 1962. The establishment of a cotton gin in Sáenz Peña, a town in northern Argentina, allowed Alpargatas to manufacture denim in 1968, <b>allowing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> take advantage to fashion trends in that direction, and a new plant in Aguilares, Tucumán, <b>allowed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> create its Pampero children's footwear line in 1972.|$|R
50|$|In its yellow form, it {{controls}} {{the element of}} fire, <b>allowing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> shoot fireballs. In its red form, it {{controls the}} element of earth, <b>allowing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> eat through some elements of the scenery. In its green form, it controls the element of air, <b>allowing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> produce ropes from its hands to swing around the environment and it can also pull different objects with its rope. In its blue form, it controls the element of water, allowing the ability to dive underwater and shooting bubbles that damage hostiles.|$|R

5|$|A {{chelating}} agent is a molecule {{with at least}} two negatively charged groups that <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> form complexes with metal ions with multiple positive charges, such as lead. The chelate that is thus formed is nontoxic and can be excreted in the urine, initially at up to 50 times the normal rate. The {{chelating agent}}s used for treatment of lead poisoning are edetate disodium calcium (CaNa2EDTA), dimercaprol (BAL), which are injected, and succimer and d-penicillamine, which are administered orally.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} asset are the Storm's narrow dimensions, which <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> {{traverse the}} narrow alleyways {{common to the}} casbahs of many Middle Eastern cities, places that armoured Humvees can only enter with great difficulty and minimal manoeuvrability, if at all. Full-height rear doors which allow for the quick deployment of fully equipped troops into combat are touted as another advantage over similar vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Capybaras are farmed {{for meat}} and skins in South America. The meat is {{considered}} unsuitable {{to eat in}} some areas, while in other areas it is considered {{an important source of}} protein. In parts of South America, especially in Venezuela, capybara meat is popular during Lent and Holy Week as the Catholic Church previously issued special dispensation to <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be eaten while other meats are generally forbidden.|$|E
50|$|A few snakes do {{not conform}} to these categories. Atractaspis is solenoglyphous but the fangs swing out sideways, <b>allowing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> strike without opening its mouth, perhaps <b>allowing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> hunt in small tunnels. Scolecophidia (blind {{burrowing}} snakes) typically have few teeth, often only in the upper jaw or lower jaw.|$|R

5|$|Chesham {{also had}} {{extensive}} goods facilities, particularly for coal; the goods yard was initially {{equipped with a}} mobile 5-ton crane, replaced by a fixed 8-ton crane between 1898–1900. The outward transport of watercress, a major local industry, also generated significant traffic. During the electrification of the line in 1957–60 the station was equipped with a bay platform for passenger trains, to <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> accommodate both through services to and from Baker Street and the Chalfont& Latimer–Chesham shuttle simultaneously. This bay platform was closed on 29 November 1970 {{and is now a}} garden.|$|E
5|$|Dromedaries {{are mainly}} active during {{daylight}} hours. They form herds of about 20 individuals, which {{are led by}} a dominant male. This camel feeds on foliage and desert vegetation; several adaptations, {{such as the ability}} to tolerate losing more than 30% of its total water content, <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> thrive in its desert habitat. Mating occurs annually and peaks in the rainy season; females bear a single calf after a gestation of 15 months.|$|E
5|$|During the {{planning}} of Troll, which opened in 1990, {{it was decided that}} the station was to be placed at such a location as to <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> have an airstrip for year-round operations. Jutulsessen was chosen as the location, in part because it provided a base nunatak for the research station {{and at the same time}} was close to blue ice for the runway. At the time, all cargo and passengers to Troll had to either be transported by ship, or flown in via the airport at the Russian base Novolazarevskaya or Henriksenskjera.|$|E
50|$|The GM-94 is a {{short range}} weapon, <b>allowing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be used in close urban environments. With a minimum safe {{distance}} of only 10m, the GM-94 is well suited to close, room-to-room fighting. Its simple design and operation <b>allows</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> operate in dusty and dirty environments and even after being immersed in water.|$|R
50|$|Skin {{immunity}} is {{a property}} of skin that <b>allows</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> resist infections from pathogens. In {{addition to providing}} a passive physical barrier against infection, the skin also contains elements of the innate and adaptive immune systems which <b>allows</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> actively fight infections. Hence the skin provides defense in depth against will infection.|$|R

5|$|Europa Orbiter — Its {{objective}} {{would be}} to characterize {{the extent of the}} ocean and its relation to the deeper interior. Instrument payload could include a radio subsystem, laser altimeter, magnetometer, Langmuir probe, and a mapping camera. The Europa Orbiter received a go-ahead in 1999 but was canceled in 2002. This orbiter featured a special ice-penetrating radar that would <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> scan below the surface.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, the National Science Foundation granted $11 {{million to}} modify an A-10 for weather {{research}} for CIRPAS at the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School and {{in collaboration with}} scientists from the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology (SDSM), replacing SDSM's retired North American T-28 Trojan. The A-10's armor is expected to <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> survive the extreme meteorological conditions, such as 200mph hailstorms, found in inclement high-altitude weather events.|$|E
5|$|In a side plot, Walternate (John Noble) has {{recovered}} {{the portion of}} the doomsday machine that Fauxlivia has secured from the prime universe, and has discovered the formulation for Cortexiphan from his tests on Olivia, but refuses to <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be tested on children. When he hears of Fauxlivia's pregnancy with his grandchild, Walternate comforts her and offers his complete support for her, believing the child to be another way to bring Peter voluntarily back to the parallel universe.|$|E

50|$|On 22 July 2011 {{the station}} {{announced}} {{that it had been}} successful with its first licence extension application, <b>allowing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> broadcast for another 5 years until 2017. Furthermore, on 19 August 2016, the station again announced a second licence extension application had been successful, <b>allowing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> broadcast for a further 5 years until 2022.|$|R
50|$|The first Typhoon, the Mk-23, was {{released}} in 1997. The weapon is mounted on a stabilized deck mounting which <b>allows</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> remain on target as the platform beneath it moves. The stabilizer has an accuracy of 0.25 mrad, <b>allowing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> keep the weapon aimed to within 250 mm on a target 1000 m away.|$|R
5|$|Jellicoe {{announced}} that at present loss rates, Britain would be effectively starved into submission by November 1917. After {{a meeting at}} Scapa Flow later in July between Sims, Jellicoe, and Admiral David Beatty (commander of the Grand Fleet), the Admiralty requested that the U.S. Navy send four dreadnoughts and six destroyers to join the Grand Fleet. The Admiralty intended that {{the arrival of the}} American dreadnoughts would <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> decommission five ships of the pre-dreadnought , freeing up four thousand officers and ratings to serve on new light cruisers, destroyers, and submarines then under construction.|$|E
5|$|Like the Storm II, the Mark III was {{initially}} {{available only to}} the military with versions set to be delivered to the Israel Police in 2009. A civilian version would only be released if the local tax code was modified to <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> compete with foreign imports of the same class. AIL states that if such a thing would happen, a petrol engine version could be offered. Regarding Export markets, the Storm 3 has already seen use in several countries, especially in its armored version.|$|E
5|$|Rossia {{returned}} to Kronstadt, arriving on 8 April 1906, {{where she was}} given a lengthy refit that was finished in 1909. Her engines and boilers were reconditioned, her mainmast was removed and she received additional six-inch guns. Six more guns in lightly armored casemates were added on the upper deck, positioned on each side in the intervals between the main-deck six-inch guns. In addition the bow gun {{was moved to the}} upper deck to <b>allow</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> fire to each side. This increased the ship's broadside by four guns.|$|E
50|$|Wassermann M: The last {{family were}} the medium class units. Again {{it is not}} clear exactly how many Freya arrays were {{attached}} to the mast. In 1944 this version received a modification that <b>allowed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> electronically tilt its beams by 16 degrees which <b>allowed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> perform height determination turning its into a 3 D search radar.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of container traffic is {{handled by the}} new quay 16, the longest and deepest of all the quays at a length of 600m and a draft of 15.5m <b>allowing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> accommodate the largest container ships in the world. It has a stacking area of 365,000m2 <b>allowing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> process up to 745,000 TEU per year.|$|R
50|$|It {{requires}} no ignition source (thereby <b>allowing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> work in explosive atmospheres).|$|R
