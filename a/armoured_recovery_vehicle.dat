5|$|On 6 February 1956, {{the then}} Governor General, Field Marshal Sir William Slim, {{presented}} the regiment with its Guidon at a Regimental Parade held in Puckapunyal. Also in 1956 the regiment {{was equipped with}} the Centurion <b>armoured</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>vehicle,</b> allowing the retirement of the Churchill recovery vehicle. Following {{the expansion of the}} Royal Australian Armoured Corps (RAAC) in 1960, A Squadron was disbanded, reducing the regiment to two squadrons, and the majority of its personnel formed regular squadrons in the 4th/19th Prince of Wales' Light Horse and the 2nd/14th Light Horse (Queensland Mounted Infantry), which were predominantly CMF formations. These squadrons subsequently became part of the 1st Cavalry Regiment, which was later redesignated the 2nd Cavalry Regiment and in turn provided the nucleus for the newly raised 3rd Cavalry Regiment.|$|E

50|$|The {{military}} also deploys tow trucks for <b>recovery</b> of stranded <b>vehicles.</b> In the US Army, {{a variant}} of the HEMTT truck is used for this purpose, the M984 wrecker. For recovery in combat situations while under fire, many armies with large vehicle fleets also deploy <b>armoured</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>vehicles.</b> These vehicles fulfill a similar role, but are resistant to heavy fire and capable of traversing rough terrain with their tracks.|$|R
50|$|For {{the long}} term, Canada plans {{to replace the}} {{borrowed}} Leopard 2 tanks with a purchase of 100 surplus vehicles from the Netherlands, including 20 Leopard 2A6Ms for combat service, 40 Leopard 2A4s for training, and 20 support <b>vehicles,</b> such as <b>Armoured</b> <b>Recovery</b> <b>Vehicles,</b> Bridge-Layers and <b>Armoured</b> Engineer vehicles.|$|R
50|$|The {{mobility}} {{of the force}} is being improved as per the plan. Many new APCs were procured, such as BTR-80, Otokar Cobra and BOV M11.

25|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{demonstrate}} that they could move freely within the province, a combined communist force including a company from the 33rd NVA Regiment, elements of the Viet Cong D440 Provincial Mobile Battalion, the Binh Ba and Ngai Giao Guerrilla Squad and the Chau Duc District Company had occupied Binh Ba {{on the evening of}} 5–6 June 1969. In response, Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) forces were sent from Duc Thanh the following morning. Initial intelligence suggested that a group of about platoon strength had infiltrated the village. Meanwhile, during a separate operation 6 RAR had also been engaged in a heavy contact several kilometres north of the task force base and at 08:00 on 6 June, an Australian Centurion tank and an <b>armoured</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>vehicle</b> moving through Binh Ba to assist 6 RAR were fired upon. A rocket propelled grenade (RPG) struck the Centurion penetrating the turret, and causing damage to the tank and severe injuries to one of the crewman. The district commander subsequently asked 1 ATF for assistance in clearing Binh Ba.|$|E
25|$|WZT-2 (Wóz Zabezpieczenia Technicznego - <b>Armoured</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>vehicle)</b> - Polish ARV {{built on}} T-55 hull. It {{was built to}} perform repairs on T-55 and T-55A tanks. When it entered service in 1973 {{it was not only}} the best ARV in the whole Warsaw Pact but {{probably}} in the whole world. It is still able to carry out tasks that NATO gives ARVs of its class. Unlike the T-55 and the WZT-1, the WZT-2 is still the basic ARV of the Polish army used for field repairs. It's able to perform repairs not only on Soviet tanks like the T-54/T-55 and T-72 but also on Polish PT-91 and German Leopard 2A4. However, because all tanks currently in Polish service weigh more than 40 tons it is unable to tow them. It is used to tow lighter vehicles like BWP-1 and 2S1. A total number of 600 was produced. 80 were in service as of 2004. Some are used by Ratownictwo Kolejowe (Railroad emergency respond services). Many have private owners who bought them from the Polish Army. 196 of these vehicles were also sold to India. The vehicles were also bought by Iraq and Yugoslavia.|$|E
500|$|The AMX-30 has {{a number}} of {{different}} variations, including a number of other armoured vehicles based on the same chassis. A simplified version of the tank, without the infra-red searchlight and periscopes and a less complex commander's cupola was developed for export, known as the [...] "basic AMX-30". This version also came devoid of the pressurized air filtering system, and moved the smaller [...] machine gun into the coaxial position and the larger [...] M2 to the turret roof. Another version was considered for the French Army, adopting a [...] tank gun able to fire the supersonic [...] (Anti-Char Rapide Autopropulsé) anti-tank guided missile, as well as high explosive rounds. A prototype was finished in 1967 with a new cast turret, wide enough to hold the much larger armament. However, the high costs of the missiles forced the French Army to abandon the program in 1972. The vehicles based on the chassis include an <b>armoured</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>vehicle,</b> a bridgelayer, a self-propelled anti-aircraft vehicle, a tactical nuclear missile launcher and a self-propelled artillery piece.|$|E
5000|$|... 233 PT-91s were {{delivered}} between 1995 and 2002 (232 vehicles remain in service, the early prototype is {{preserved in the}} Land Forces Training Center museum in Poznań) and 38 support vehicles based on the T-72/PT-91 hull (29 WZT-3M <b>armoured</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>vehicles,</b> 8 MID engineering tank and 1 prototype PZA Loara self-propelled anti-aircraft weapon).|$|R
25|$|The Royal Army of Oman {{replaced}} the Saladin armoured car with between 30 and 50 Scorpions. They were delivered between 1982 and 1983, {{along with three}} Samson <b>armoured</b> <b>recovery</b> <b>vehicles.</b> In 1985, a second order for up to 30 vehicles was delivered. The second order included Scorpion, Sultan, Spartan and Samson vehicles. Oman operates the newer Stormer.|$|R
50|$|To meet {{immediate}} needs in Afghanistan, 20 of the Bundeswehr's stock of Leopard 2A6s were upgraded to 2A6M standard and loaned to Canada {{at no cost}} by the German government. Two Leopard 2 Büffel <b>Armoured</b> <b>Recovery</b> <b>Vehicles</b> were acquired at the same time. These vehicles were shipped from Germany to Afghanistan, with the first arriving on 16 August 2007.|$|R
