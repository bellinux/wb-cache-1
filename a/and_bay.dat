5|$|When the Michigan State Legislature {{consolidated}} {{the statutes}} defining the various memorial highways in 2001, they included the Veterans of World War I Memorial Highway in the law. Defined along I-75/US23 between Saginaw <b>and</b> <b>Bay</b> City, the designation {{was included in}} Public Act 142. That act also affected another previously designated moniker between the two cities. The Roberts-Linton Highway was named in 1931 for local leaders who championed {{the construction of a}} highway along the Saginaw River. This name was applied to the original highway routing between Saginaw <b>and</b> <b>Bay</b> City (now a part of M-13). After the 2001 change, the name was moved to the US23 freeway.|$|E

5|$|In the Florida Panhandle, {{the storm}} dropped heavy rainfall, peaking at 8.51inches (216mm) in Plantation Bay, Florida in Flagler County. Upon making landfall, Arlene caused a storm surge {{of up to}} 5feet (1.5m) in Walton County. Moderate beach erosion also occurred. The storm surge and strong waves caused {{moderate}} to severe damage to roads along the panhandle. Strong winds caused power outages to 500people in Walton, Washington <b>and</b> <b>Bay</b> counties. The storm spawned a weak tornado in Navarre, Florida, causing minor damage on its 0.1-mile (0.2-km) path. Damage on the panhandle totaled to $3.5million (2005USD), $2.5million of which was in Fort Pickens alone.|$|E

5|$|Major {{changes to}} the routing of M-47 started in December 1960 when the I-75/US10/US23 freeway opened between Saginaw <b>and</b> <b>Bay</b> City. US10 was rerouted east of Midland to Bay City along the M-20 freeway. M-47 was rerouted along the former US10 from Saginaw to east of Midland using a {{connector}} expressway from Freeland north to the US10 freeway. M-81 was extended over State Street in Saginaw, and the former routing of M-47 between Saginaw <b>and</b> <b>Bay</b> City was redesignated as M-84. M-13 also replaced the former US23/M-47 when US23 was moved to freeways as well. The southern end of M-47 was changed in 1962 with the completion of I-96 in the Lansing area. US16 was replaced by M-43, and the southern terminus of M-47 was moved to exit122 along I-96. This segment of M-47 south of M-46 became an extension of M-52 in 1969, truncating M-47 to Hemlock. The interchange at Salzburg Road north of Freeland opened in 1970, and the expressway segment was upgraded to a full freeway. At the same time, M-47 was truncated to its current routing, resulting in {{the elimination of the}} M-46/M-47 concurrency near Shields. In the end, only about {{a mile and a half}} (2.4km) of roadway still bears the M-47 from before the changes made starting in 1960, along a section of road that was not originally part of the highway in 1919.|$|E

5|$|Many {{changes were}} made in 1960 to the routing of US10. A new freeway opened for I-75/US10/US23 between M-13 {{northeast}} of Saginaw and the M-20 freeway in Bay City. US10 replaced the M-20 designation on the freeway between Midland <b>and</b> <b>Bay</b> City. M-47 replaced US10 between Midland and Saginaw, and M-81 replaced US10 {{in the city of}} Saginaw. An addition segment of US10 between Saginaw and Bridgeport was renumbered BLI-75. The US10A designation previously in use in Midland was changed to Bus. US10 at this time as well.|$|E
5|$|The I-75/US10/US23 freeway was {{completed}} between Saginaw <b>and</b> <b>Bay</b> City in late 1960 or early 1961; M-47 was relocated {{to the former}} US10 between Saginaw and Midland, and M-84 was redesignated along the former M-47 between M-81 at Saginaw and the freeway in Bay City. A new BL I-75 was created {{at the same time}} along the former M-47 in Bay City. This business loop would be split in half in 1971 resulting in a new business spur; M-84 was extended over the southern section between M-25 and I-75/US10/US 23.|$|E
5|$|The Meadowbrook State Parkway {{begins at}} a {{cloverleaf}} interchange with the Ocean Parkway <b>and</b> <b>Bay</b> Parkway on Jones Beach Island {{in the town}} of Hempstead. The parkway briefly proceeds northwest through Jones Beach before turning northward and crossing South Oyster Bay on a six-lane causeway. After crossing the bay, the Meadowbrook reaches exitM10, a trumpet interchange with Loop Parkway. In the middle of exitM10 is a southbound-only toll barrier used to charge for access to Jones Beach. After Loop Parkway, the Meadowbrook heads northwest across another water channel and becomes a divided highway with a large center median. A third bridge over a waterway soon follows, bringing the Meadowbrook Parkway onto the mainland part of Long Island near the Norman J. Levy Park and Preserve.|$|E

It traces its roots to the UP College of Agriculture (UPCA), which was founded in 1909 by the American colonial government to promote agricultural education and research in the Philippines. American botanist Edwin Copeland served as its first dean. UPLB was formally established in 1972 following the union of UPCA with four other Los Baños and Diliman-based University of the Philippines (UP) units.|$|E
5|$|The {{main area}} of inhabitation of Bantu ethnic {{minorities}} in Somalia {{has historically been}} in village enclaves in the south, particularly between the Jubba and Shebelle river valleys {{as well as the}} Bakool <b>and</b> <b>Bay</b> regions. Beginning in the 1970s, more Bantus began moving to urban centres such as Mogadishu and Kismayo. The displacement caused by the onset of the civil war in the 1990s further increased the number of rural minorities migrating to urban areas. As a consequence of these movements, Mogadishu's traditional demographic makeup changed significantly over the years.|$|E
5|$|The {{right-of-way}} {{on which}} the parkway was built had originally {{been part of a}} private road leading to Sagtikos Manor. The parkway was designed to have connections with the Sunken Meadow Spur (the future Sunken Meadow State Parkway) and the Captree State Parkway (now known as the Robert Moses Causeway) proposed by New York City highway engineer Robert Moses. On November13, 1949, a new interchange between the Southern State Parkway <b>and</b> <b>Bay</b> Shore Road was opened to traffic. This interchange would eventually serve as the Southern State Parkway's junction with the Sagtikos, Heckscher and Captree state parkways. Proposals conceived at this time called for grading on the new Sagtikos State Parkway to begin in early 1950.|$|E
50|$|Headlands <b>and</b> <b>bays</b> are {{two related}} coastal features. Headlands <b>and</b> <b>bays</b> are often {{found on the}} same coastline. A bay is a body of water, either {{seawater}} (salt water) or fresh water, surrounded by land on three sides, whereas a headland is land surrounded by water on three sides. Headlands are characterized by high, breaking waves, rocky shores, intense erosion, and steep sea cliffs. Bays generally have less wave activity, and often less wind activity than the areas of water outside the <b>bay,</b> <b>and</b> typically have sandy beaches. Headlands <b>and</b> <b>bays</b> form on discordant coastlines, where the land consists of bands of rock of alternating resistance that run perpendicular to the coast.|$|R

5|$|There {{have been}} five {{different}} business routes of US Highway23 {{in the state}} of Michigan. These business routes were designated along former sections of US Highway23 (US23) to provide signed access from the main highway to the downtowns of cities bypassed by new routings of US23. Two are still extant, connecting through downtown Ann Arbor and Rogers City. Three others have been decommissioned. The former Business US23 (Bus. US23) in Fenton was split in half during the 1970s and later completely turned back to local control in 2006. The former business loops through Saginaw <b>and</b> <b>Bay</b> City were renumbered as business loops of Interstate 75 in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{areas of}} {{tropical}} cyclone formation {{are divided into}} seven basins. These include the north Atlantic Ocean, the eastern and western parts of the northern Pacific Ocean, the southwestern Pacific, the southwestern and southeastern Indian Oceans, and the northern Indian Ocean (Arabian Sea <b>and</b> <b>Bay</b> of Bengal). The western Pacific is the most active and the north Indian the least active. An average of 86tropical cyclones of tropical storm intensity form annually worldwide, with 47 reaching hurricane/typhoon strength, and 20 becoming intense tropical cyclones (at least of Category 3 intensity).|$|E
5|$|After {{reaching}} peak winds, Tropical Storm Chantal became disorganized {{while the}} center became ill-defined and situated to the west-southwest {{of the main}} area of convection; {{this was due to}} unfavorable upper-level winds, although computer models continued to forecast a more favorable upper-level environment. By early on August20, Hurricane Hunters reported several low-level circulations embedded within a large low pressure area. Later that day, wind shear decreased when the storm moved into the Gulf of Honduras. Chantal became much better organized, again reaching peak winds of 70miles per hour (110km/h) before making landfall early on August21 near the border of Mexico and Belize. Initially, the storm was forecast to cross the Yucatán Peninsula <b>and</b> <b>Bay</b> of Campeche and make a second landfall in the state of Veracruz. Chantal slowly weakened over land while moving slowly across northern Belize. Convection decreased markedly late on August21, and early the next day Chantal weakened to tropical depression status. The upper- and middle-level circulations turned to the northeast while the low-level circulation turned to the west-southwest further inland. Weakening continued, and late on August22 Chantal dissipated over the Mexican state of Tabasco.|$|E
