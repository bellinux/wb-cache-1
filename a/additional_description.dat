6000|$|But were it otherwise, {{what would}} this prove, but a truth, of which no man ever doubted?--videlicet, {{that there are}} sentences, which would be equally in their place both in verse and prose. Assuredly it does not prove the point, which alone {{requires}} proof; namely, {{that there are not}} passages, which would suit the one and not suit the other. The first line of this sonnet is distinguished from the ordinary language of men by the epithet to morning. For we will set aside, at present, the consideration, that the particular word [...] "smiling" [...] is hackneyed, and, as it involves a sort of personification, not quite congruous with the common and material attribute of [...] "shining." [...] And, doubtless, this adjunction of epithets for the purpose of <b>additional</b> <b>description,</b> where no particular attention is demanded for the quality of the thing, would be noticed as giving a poetic cast to a man's conversation. Should the sportsman exclaim, [...] "Come boys! the rosy morning calls you up:" [...] he will be supposed to have some song in his head. But no one suspects this, when he says, [...] "A wet morning shall not confine us to our beds." [...] This then is either a defect in poetry, or it is not. Whoever should decide in the affirmative, I would request him to re-peruse any one poem, of any confessedly great poet from Homer to Milton, or from Aeschylus to Shakespeare; and to strike out, (in thought I mean), every instance of this kind. If the number of these fancied erasures did not startle him; or if he continued to deem the work improved by their total omission; he must advance reasons of no ordinary strength and evidence, reasons grounded in the essence of human nature. Otherwise, I should not hesitate to consider him as a man not so much proof against all authority, as dead to it.|$|E

50|$|The {{church at}} Pedret, {{located in the}} Pyrenees, was {{thought to have been}} elaborately {{decorated}} (even without a written history of worshippers) since it was located on the roads connecting Berga, Bagà, and Cerdanya, thus it may have been an important location. Scholars agree that the church's original architecture was Visigothic due to specific construction elements such as the horse-shoe arches, which divide the nave and give entrance to the apses, as well as the insulation of the apses themselves. However, an <b>additional</b> <b>description</b> of Mozarabic has been given as well to describe the architectural style. Various theories on the age of the frescoes have been presented taking into account stylistic trends of the tenth through the twelfth centuries AD and renovations that took place on the church during those time periods as well. The Museum where the frescoes currently reside dates them to be {{from the end of the}} eleventh century to the beginning of the twelfth. Due to the fresco's age, it is probable that the Southern apse from Pedret is one of the oldest of all Catalan Romanesque wall paintings.|$|E

"The Source Wall {{as it is}} {{currently}} understood visually in the DCU {{first appeared in the}} X/Titans crossover. ...the Wall as such did not appear in Kirby's New Gods.What did appear was a four page introductory sequence in New Gods #5 in which Metron, using his Mobius Chair, explores the 'Final Barrier'. 'And somewhere beyond--lies the Source: the greatest of mysteries.' An <b>additional</b> <b>description</b> suggests that this is the Promethian Galaxy--a place of giants--where 'all roads to the Source come to an end--'. Visually, there's a double page shot of a giant strapped to an enormous piece of Kirby debris. There's another panel with a large head of a female who tried to achieve 'the maximum state'. And failed. And, in the text, Metron notes that 'beyond all the knowledge and sweeping concept at our command, the mystery of the Source lies--serene--omnipotent--all-wise.'There is, however, no shot of a 'Source Wall' as such. No final visual barrier beyond which an entity may not venture. No wall full of entities who tried to breach the final barrier and failed and became subsumed within the Wall.Chris and I invented that notion--and its visualization--for the X/Titans book, clearly extrapolating from what Jack had done.The neatest part of the invention is that apparently, the notion of the Wall and its execution were such a perfect fit for the existing New Gods mythology that folks don't really remember exactly where it came from." ...|$|E
5000|$|An early example {{featuring}} uploaded {{minds in}} robotic bodies {{can be found}} in Frederik Pohl's story [...] "The Tunnel Under the World" [...] from 1955. In this story, the protagonist Guy Burckhardt continually wakes up on the same date from a dream of dying in an explosion. Burckhardt is already familiar with the idea of putting human minds in robotic bodies, since this is what is done with the robot workers at the nearby Contro Chemical factory. As someone has once explained it to him, [...] "each machine was controlled by a sort of computer which reproduced, in its electronic snarl, the actual memory and mind of a human being ... It was only a matter, he said, of transferring a man's habit patterns from brain cells to vacuum-tube cells." [...] Later in the story, Pohl gives some <b>additional</b> <b>description</b> of the procedure: [...] "Take a master petroleum chemist, infinitely skilled in the separation of crude oil into its fractions. Strap him down, probe into his brain with searching electronic needles. The machine scans the patterns of the mind, translates what it sees into charts and sine waves. Impress these same waves on a robot computer and you have your chemist. Or a thousand copies of your chemist, if you wish, with all of his knowledge and skill, and no human limitations at all." [...] After some investigation, Burckhardt learns that his entire town had been killed in a chemical explosion, and the brains of the dead townspeople had been scanned and placed into miniature robotic bodies in a miniature replica of the town (as a character explains to him, 'It's as easy to transfer a pattern from a dead brain as a living one'), so that a businessman named Mr. Dorchin could charge companies to use the townspeople as test subjects for new products and advertisements.|$|E
50|$|It is {{understood}} {{in the tradition of}} Sufism that before a practitioner has experientially recognized his essential nature through contemplation and psychological purification, he is merely identifying with various self-conceptualizations. These self-conceptualizations are mental or egoic representations of who the person thinks he is, instead of experientially knowing one’s essential nature. Self-identifying in this way is considered to limit holistic self-understanding as self-conceptualizations naturally fluctuate. Contemporary Sufi Master Seyyed Dr. Ali Kianfar describes the limitation of such self-conceptualizations when most people introduce themselves. After sharing various details about their interests or accomplishments, one cannot further express who they are:But there arrives a point where there is less and less to say. He searches for a point of finality, to complete the picture—yet he cannot find such a point. He realizes that the description will not do him justice. It may be honest and true, and yet be radically incomplete and its incompleteness cannot be made whole by <b>additional</b> <b>description</b> by more words, by language itself. (Kianfar, 1996, p. 67)Masters and scholars of Sufism emphasize that there is an innate knowledge available that initiates both one’s initial curiosity of  “who am I, really?” as well as the motivation to remain devoted to self-discovery. Sufi Master and theologian (12th century) Al-Ghazali (2010) describes that the “distinguishing characteristic” of the human being is “his experiential knowledge of the real nature of things” (p. 25). To discover this knowledge first necessitates that one become aware that despite the appearance of multiplicity and constant change within existence, there is a foundation of existence within him that is unchanging. He gradually recognizes that what he currently understands is limited and relative compared to understanding Ultimate Reality, or reality as it is, versus any conceptualization. Dr. Nahid Angha (1991a), contemporary Sufi Master, describes that “the goal of a Sufi” is to “witness” the “direct spiritual and personal reality, which is hidden behind the distracting colors of mere surface phenomena” (p. 8).|$|E
