40|$|Phosphorus has {{a number}} of {{indispensable}} biochemical roles, but its natural deposition and the low solubility of phosphates as well as their rapid transformation to insoluble forms make the element commonly the growth–limiting nutrient, particularly in aquatic ecosystems. Famously, phosphorus that reaches water bodies is commonly the main cause of eutrophication. This undesirable process can severely affect many <b>aquatic</b> <b>biotas</b> in the world. More management practices are proposed but long–term monitoring of phosphorus level is necessary to ensure that the eutrophication won’t occur. Passive sampling techniques, which have been developed over the last decades, could provide several advantages to the conventional sampling methods including simpler sampling devices, more cost–effective sampling campaign, providing flow proportional load as well as representative average of concentrations of phosphorus in the environment. Although some types of passive samplers are commercially available, their uses are still scarcely reported in the literature. In Japan, there is limited application of passive sampling technique to monitor phosphorus even in the field of agricultural environment.

The lethal concentrations and the antioxidant enzyme activities of superoxide dismustase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were determined after 48 -h exposure to MCP and DCP. The values of 49 -h LC(50) were 30. 72 mg/L (r(2) = 0. 919) and 15. 33 mg/L (r(2) = 0. 954) in the acute lethal experiment,; exposed to single MCP and DCP, and 16. 45 mg/L (r(2) = 0. 977) and 8. 21 mg/L (r(2) = 0. 984) to binary equitoxic mixtures of MCP and DCP.

40|$|Abstract. Tritium can {{represent}} a key radionuclide in the aquatic environment, in some cases, contributing {{significantly to the}} doses received by <b>aquatic</b> non-human <b>biota</b> and by humans due to aquatic releases. Recently, the necessity to have a robust assessment of tritium routine and accidental risk emissions for large nuclear installations increased the interest in the topic. In the present study, the recent experiments concerning tritium transfer in adult rainbow trout are described. The updated model concerning the dynamics of tritium transfer in aquatic food chain (AQUATRIT model) developed by the authors is applied and tested for these experimental data. The model predicts the experimental data with a factor of 2 to 3 and the potential improvements of the model are discussed. The present model results emphasize that in the field conditions, the major factors influencing the OBT biological loss rate are the temperature and the prey availability while, the OBT uptake is mainly influenced by the fish growth rates. The main goals {{of this study are}} to enhance the robustness of aquatic models for tritium risk assessment and to fulfil a gap for aquatic pathways in environment. 1...|$|R

40|$|Restoration {{of river}} {{hydromorphology}} often has limited detected effects on river biota. One frequently discussed {{reason is that}} the restored river length is insufficient to allow populations to develop and give the room for geomorphological processes to occur. We investigated ten pairs of restored river sections of which one was a large project involving a long, intensively restored river section and one represented a smaller restoration effort. The restoration effect was quantified by comparing each restored river section to an upstream non-restored section. We sampled the following response variables: habitat composition in the river and its floodplain, three aquatic organism groups (aquatic macrophytes, benthic invertebrates and fish), two floodplain-inhabiting organism groups (floodplain vegetation, ground beetles), as well as food web composition and land-water interactions reflected by stable isotopes. For each response variable, we compared the difference in dissimilarity of the restored and nearby non-restored section between the larger and the smaller restoration projects. In a second step, we regrouped the pairs and compared restored sections with large changes in substrate composition to those with small changes. When comparing all restored to all non-restored sections, ground beetles were most strongly responding to restoration, followed by fish, floodplain vegetation, benthic invertebrates and aquatic macrophytes. Aquatic habitats and stable isotope signatures responded less strongly. When grouping the restored sections by project size, {{there was no difference in}} the response to restoration between the projects targeting long and short river sections with regard to any of the measured response variables except nitrogen isotopic composition. In contrast, when grouping the restored sections by substrate composition, the responses of fish, benthic invertebrates, aquatic macrophytes, floodplain vegetation and nitrogen isotopic composition were greater in sections with larger changes in substrate composition as compared to those with smaller changes. Synthesis and applications. The effects of hydromorphological restoration measures on <b>aquatic</b> and floodplain <b>biota</b> strongly depend on the creation of habitat for aquatic organisms, which were limited or not present prior to restoration.

50|$|The {{issue is}} {{specifically}} addressed in major regulatory frameworks. In Europe, for instance, “nonrelevant” metabolites are distinguished from metabolites that are “relevant for groundwater resources” or even “ecotoxicologically relevant”. The latter are those whose risk to soil or <b>aquatic</b> <b>biota</b> is comparable or {{higher than the}} parent and must meet the same standards as their parent. Groundwater-relevant metabolites are those likely to reach groundwater in concentrations above 0.1 μg/liter and to display the same toxicity as the parent compound. In the past toxicology issues typically emerged only decades after market introduction. Examples are the detection of chloridazon products (first marketed in 1964) in surface and groundwater, or tolylfluanid (first marketed in 1971). That these substances were overlooked for so long may partially be attributable to prior limits on analytical capabilities. However, labeling some metabolites as nonrelevant may have resulted in directing attention away from them. The decision to tolerate up to 10 μg/liter of “nonrelevant” metabolites in groundwater and drinking water is politically highly contentious in Europe. Some consider the higher limit acceptable as no imminent health risk can be proven, whereas others regard it as a fundamental deviation from the precautionary principle.|$|E
