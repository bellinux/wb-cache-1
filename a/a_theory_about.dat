25|$|In his 1979 book Architecture and its Interpretation, Juan Pablo Bonta {{put forward}} <b>a</b> <b>theory</b> <b>about</b> how {{buildings}} and architects achieve canonic status. He {{argued that a}} building and its architect achieve iconic or canonic status after a period when various critics and historians build up an interpretation that then becomes unquestioned for a significant period. If the text itself receives canonical status, then {{the status of the}} architect is further endorsed. For example, in the first edition of Siegfried Giedion's book Space Time and Architecture (1949) the Finnish architect Alvar Aalto was not mentioned at all. In the second edition he received more attention than any other architect, including LeCorbusier, who until then had been understood as the most important modernist architect.|$|E

A writer in the Oregonian said the fountain [...] "is an abstraction of a mountain waterfall".

500|$|Bradley {{develops}} <b>a</b> <b>theory</b> <b>about</b> Hamlet's moral agony {{relating to}} {{a conflict between}} [...] "traditional" [...] and [...] "critical" [...] conscience: [...] "The conventional moral ideas of his time, which he shared with the Ghost, told him plainly {{that he ought to}} avenge his father; but a deeper conscience in him, which was in advance of his time, contended with these explicit conventional ideas. It is because this deeper conscience remains below the surface that he fails to recognise it, and fancies he is hindered by cowardice or sloth or passion or what not; but it emerges into light in that speech to Horatio. And it is just because he has this nobler moral nature in him that we admire and love him". The opening words of Shakespeare's Sonnet 94 ("They that have pow'r to hurt, and will do none") have been admired as a description of conscience. So has John Donne's commencement of his poem : [...] "Let man's soul be a sphere, and then, in this, Th' intelligence that moves, devotion is;" ...|$|E

500|$|The {{title of}} the album, The Hunting Party, is a contextual metaphor. The album, {{a return to the}} band's {{original}} harder rock-centric sounds, represents the band's desire to not only create something different from other rock bands, but to also bring back the [...] "energy and soul" [...] of rock itself, and that Linkin Park are the party that will hunt for that energy and soul. Shinoda elaborated on the {{title of the}} album in an interview with Kerrang! explaining: [...] "We got so sick of other bands trying to be other bands and playing it safe the whole time, so the album name comes from <b>a</b> <b>theory</b> <b>about</b> culture becoming too passive, everyone just standing around waiting for opportunities to come to them instead of going out and getting theirs. I'm aware there {{are always going to be}} heavier bands than us, but The Hunting Party is Linkin Park going out and getting it for ourselves." [...] The inspiration for the title came from a news article Shinoda read online about a Japanese writer's concerns about today's growing society. The writer described the young men of today as [...] "herbivores", and explained how they are essentially grazing, waiting for an opportunity to come to them, rather than hunting for it.|$|E
500|$|Megan {{finds out}} that the shooter was in fact outside the room. They find Sean Wilcox's (Tobias Segal) skin on the bullet, a {{recently}} released criminal. Sean denies killing Elena, but states {{that he was one}} of Elena's patients, and that she had rented the motel room for him, to give him a place to stay. After falling asleep in the room, he awoke after hearing a shot. After seeing Elena dead on the floor, and himself injured, he ran after thinking no one would believe his account of what happened. After Bud and Detective Samantha Baker (Sonja Sohn) meet with Sean's [...] "friend" [...] Vincent Stone (Zach McGowan), he admits that he was warned off by Elena after phoning Sean six times in one day, so Samantha and Bud start to develop <b>a</b> <b>theory</b> <b>about</b> how Vincent killed Elena. After persuasion by Peter Dunlop (Nicholas Bishop), Sean helps the police, which allows them to get an arrest warrant for Vincent, however Megan finds rice flour on the bullet, which concludes that Vincent did not kill Elena. The rice flour leads them back to Holly, as she has a baby, and rice flour is commonly used for babies. They arrest Holly, who reveals that Elena visited her and discovers Holly was back on drugs, and was going to take Holly’s baby. Holly followed Elena, and shot her to prevent this from happening. After the confession, social services arrive, and take Holly's baby away. Back at the office, Curtis Brumfield (Windell Middlebrooks) plays pranks towards Megan and Peter tells Megan that Bud is experiencing marriage problems, so Megan tells him about how to deal with the marriage problems, as Megan is a divorcée.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to its unique epistemology, Marx's theory is built on concepts—such as forces and relations of production—that have no counterpart in classical political economy. Even when existing terms are adopted—for example, the theory of surplus value, which combines David Ricardo's concepts of rent, profit, and interest—their meaning and relation to other concepts in the theory is significantly different. However, more fundamental to Marx's [...] "break" [...] is a rejection of homo economicus, or the idea, held by the classical economists, that the needs of individuals can {{be treated as a}} fact or [...] "given" [...] independent of any economic organisation. For the classical economists, individual needs can serve as a premise for a theory explaining the character of a mode of production and as an independent starting point for <b>a</b> <b>theory</b> <b>about</b> society. Where classical political economy explains economic systems as a response to individual needs, Marx's analysis accounts for a wider range of social phenomena in terms of the parts they play in a structured whole. Consequently, Marx's Capital has greater explanatory power than does political economy because it provides both a model of the economy and a description of the structure and development of a whole society. In Althusser's view, Marx does not simply argue that human needs are largely created by their social environment and thus vary with time and place; rather, he abandons the very idea that there can be <b>a</b> <b>theory</b> <b>about</b> what people are like that is prior to any theory about how they come to be that way.|$|E

The 'dependent origination' doctrine, states Peter Harvey, [...] "highlights the Buddhist notion that all apparently substantial entities within the world are in fact wrongly perceived. We live under the illusion that terms such as 'I', [...] self, mountain, tree, etc. denote permanent and stable things. The doctrine teaches this is not so." [...] There is nothing permanent (anicca), nothing substantial, no unique individual self {{in the nature of}} becoming and existence (anatta), because everything is a result of [...] "dependent origination". There are no independent objects and independent subjects, according to the Pratītyasamutpāda doctrine, there is fundamental emptiness in all phenomena and experiences.|$|E
2500|$|I have <b>a</b> <b>theory</b> <b>about</b> {{what caused}} her vocal decline, but it's more from {{watching}} her sing than from listening. I {{really think it}} was her weight loss that was so dramatic and so quick. It's not the weight loss per se—you know, Deborah Voigt has {{lost a lot of}} weight and still sounds glorious. But if one uses the weight for support, and then it's suddenly gone and one doesn't develop another musculature for support, it can be very hard on the voice. And you can't estimate the toll that emotional turmoil will take as well. I was told, by somebody who knew her well, that the way Callas held her arms to her solar plexus [...] to push and create some kind of support. If she were a Soubrette, it would never have been an issue. But she was singing the most difficult repertoire, the stuff that requires the most stamina, the most strength.|$|E

[...] Alan Sepinwall's review in The Star-Ledger was overall positive, [...] "As far as the episode as a whole goes, I thought it was fairly solid procedural hour of 'Fringe.' No, it didn't follow up on any of the revelations from 'Ability,' but it also didn't feature any of Agent Harris, and both the serial killer case and Olivia's rapport with the kid were compelling enough that I can wait on the mythology stuff for later." [...] Jane Boursaw at TV Squad rated the episode very highly in her recap, and also mooted <b>a</b> <b>theory</b> <b>about</b> the Child, [...] "My theory is that the boy is another Observer. They certainly looked a lot alike, didn't they? Could the boy have come from another dimension and ended up beneath the building? And why did the CIA guy say that they'd found 'another one.'"

40|$|Error <b>theories</b> <b>about</b> {{practical}} deontic judgements {{claim that}} no substantive practical deontic judgement is true. Practical deontic judgements are practical (rather than theoretical) {{in the sense}} that they concern actions (rather than beliefs), and they are deontic (rather than evaluative) {{in the sense that}} they are about reasons, rightness, wrongness, and obligations (rather than about goodness, badness, and so on). This paper assumes the truth of <b>an</b> error <b>theory</b> <b>about</b> practical deontic judgements in order to examine its ramifications. I defend three contentions. The first is that, if so-called fitting-attitude analyses of value fail, the truth of some substantive evaluative judgements would not be threatened by the fact that no substantive practical deontic judgment is true. Secondly, in light of the truth of these evaluative judgements, the best thing we could do is to continue to make practical deontic judgements despite the truth of <b>an</b> error <b>theory</b> <b>about</b> practical deontic judgements. My third contention is that, if some evaluative judgements are unaffected by <b>an</b> error <b>theory</b> <b>about</b> practical deontic judgements, then such <b>an</b> error <b>theory</b> will eventually lead us to some version of consequentialism...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{presents}} DISCIPLE, a multi-strategy integrated {{learning system}} illustrating <b>a</b> <b>theory</b> and <b>a</b> methodology for learning expert knowledge {{in the context of}} <b>an</b> imperfect domain <b>theory.</b> DISCIPLE integrates <b>a</b> learning system and an empty expert system, both using the same knowledge base. It is initially provided with an imperfect (nonhomogeneous) domain theory and learns problem solving rules from the problem solving steps received from its expert user, during interactive problem solving sessions. In this way, DISCIPLE evolves from a helpful assistant in problem solving to a genuine expert. The problem solving method of DISCIPLE combines problem reduction, problem solving by constraints, and problem solving by analogy. The learning method of DISCIPLE depends of its knowledge about the problem solving step (the example) from which it learns. In the context of <b>a</b> complete <b>theory</b> <b>about</b> the example, DISCIPLE uses explanation-based learning to improve its performance. In the context of <b>a</b> weak <b>theory</b> <b>about</b> the example, it synergistically combines explanation-based learning, learning by analogy, empirical learning, and learning by questioning the user, developing its competence. In the context of <b>an</b> incomplete <b>theory</b> <b>about</b> the example, DISCIPLE learns by combining the above mentioned methods, improving both its competence and performance...|$|R
