40|$|Adhesive joining is {{frequently}} {{used in the}} automotive industry. In the pursuit of reducing weight, adhesive joining is important due {{to the possibility of}} joining different types of materials. The process is often automatised in order to reduce cycle time. In this paper we aim to present a novel framework that includes detailed process simulation and automatic generation of collision free robot paths and in this way improve the quality of the joint and reduce both cycle time and processing time. To verify the simulations, the properties of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>bead</b> have been compared to experiments with good agreement...|$|E
40|$|The slow {{rolling motion}} of leukocytes {{along the walls}} of blood vessels {{mediated}} by specific receptor-ligand adhesion is important in inflammation and occurs in postcapillary venules {{over a wide range}} of wall shear stresses and vessel diameters. The ability of hydrodynamic collisions between cells to induce capture of free-stream leukocytes to a selectin-bearing surface under shear flow was studied experimentally by using a cell-free assay. It was found that carbohydrate-coated spherical beads, representing model leukocytes, tend to attach to the adhesive wall 4 – 5 cell diameters up- or downstream of a slowly rolling or stationary <b>adhesive</b> <b>bead.</b> A key feature of such “hydrodynamic recruitment” is that only glancing, indirect collisions occurring close to the plane will result in downstream attachment. A direct numerical simulation of cell capture and rolling that includes multiparticle hydrodynamic interactions is shown to reproduce the observed behavior accurately. The theory predicts that hydrodynamic recruitment will occur in the absence of buoyancy effects and over a range of shear rates, suggesting that the mechanism may be important in vivo. This theory is supported by measurements of leukocyte capture in vivo using the hamster cheek pouch model...|$|E

40|$|Among {{those who}} believe that richly {{embodied}} AGI is a promising path to creating AGI systems displaying human-level general intelligence, the possibility of virtual-world embodiment, as opposed to real-world robotic embodiment holds considerable appeal. Here we consider the question of what properties a virtual world should have in order to constitute an adequate environment for the cognitive development of a human-like, human-level general intelligence. We ask what properties a virtual world must have so that an AGI embodied in that world could viably infer humanlike theories of naive physics and folk psychology, and carry out tasks typically required in cognitive development tasks and preschool play centers. Based on these considerations we suggest a “minimal adequate environment ” we call “BlocksNBeadsWorld, ” in which agents can construct objects from blocks using adhesives, and can also fill containers, coat objects and create fabrics and substances with various sorts of differentially <b>adhesive</b> <b>beads...</b>|$|R
40|$|Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{expressing the}} adhesins Als 5 p or Als 1 p adhere to immobilized {{peptides}} and proteins that possess appropriate sequences of amino acids {{in addition to}} a sterically accessible peptide backbone. In an attempt to further define the nature of these targets, we surveyed the ability of yeast cells to adhere to 90 -μm-diameter polyethylene glycol beads coated with a 7 -mer peptide from a library of 197 unique peptide-beads. C. albicans bound to ca. 10 % of beads from the library, whereas S. cerevisiae expressing Als 5 p or Als 1 p bound to ca. 0. 1 to 1 % of randomly selected peptide-beads. S. cerevisiae expressing Als 1 p had a distinctly different adherence phenotype than did cells expressing Als 5 p. The former adhered in groups or clumps of cells, whereas the latter adhered initially as single cells, an event which was followed by the build up of cell-cell aggregates. Beads with adherent cells were removed, and the peptide attached to the bead was determined by amino acid sequencing. All <b>adhesive</b> <b>beads</b> carried a three-amino-acid sequence motif (τϕ+) that possessed a vast combinatorial potential. Adherence was sequence specific and was inhibited when soluble peptide identical to the immobilized peptide was added. The Als 5 p adhesin recognized some peptides that went unrecognized by Als 1 p. The sequence motif of adhesive peptides identified by this method is common in proteins and offers so many possible sequence combinations that target recognition by the Als proteins is clearly degenerate. A degenerate recognition system provides the fungi with the potential of adhering to a multitude of proteins and peptides, an advantage for any microorganism attempting to establish a commensal or pathogenic relationship with a host...|$|R
30|$|Cell {{mechanical}} properties play pivotal roles in vital characteristics of cells. Many of the biophysical and biological peculiarities {{are determined by}} viscoelastic properties of cells (Hayot et al. 2012; Hecht et al. 2015). For instance, it has been illustrated that interaction of a cell and the extracellular matrix is regulated by the cell’s {{mechanical properties}} (Trappmann and Chen 2013) or these mechanical traits have significant role in cell signaling (Humphrey et al. 2014). In addition, the cells’ mechanical properties {{can be regarded as}} markers of differentiation (González-Cruz et al. 2012; Mathieu and Loboa 2012), pathology (Lekka et al. 2012; Rebelo et al. 2013; Suresh et al. 2015) and transformation (Plodinec et al. 2012). Since different cell sources and different methods such as micropipette aspiration (Zhao et al. 2009), atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Cartagena and Raman 2014; Hecht et al. 2015), magnetic beads microrheometry (Bausch et al. 1998) and others have been utilized for determination of cells’ viscoelastic properties, there is a relative incongruity in results. Therefore, the mechanical properties of cells can be regarded as biomarkers {{that can be used in}} diagnosis of some diseases and analyzing the appropriate functioning of cells. In contrast to other methods of measuring viscoelastic properties, the use of magnetic field encompasses the advantage of not having direct contact with the cell body. In the methods such as AFM which include direct contact of an external tip or probe with the same dimension of a cell would lead to active cellular reaction that can easily change the mechanical properties (Guck et al. 2005). In addition, special preparations that are included in some other methods can alter the physiological and biological conditions and lead to results which are significantly different from ordinary homeostatic conditions. Using nanomagnetic <b>adhesive</b> <b>beads</b> accompanied with low-level field seems to have the lowest intervention and, therefore, gives rise to one of the most precise answers. Furthermore, magnetic-oriented approaches seem to be cheaper and simpler in comparison to other methods and so it can be widely and easily used in diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.|$|R
30|$|Bonding of {{automotive}} glass is generally performed with 1 C PUR adhesive on a primed ceramic frit or naked glass surface. The {{aim of this}} research was to replace the chemistry of the primer with an atmospheric pressure plasma treatment (APPT) with compressed air for cleaning and activation directly before bonding. Characterization of the glass surface was performed with surface energy through contact angle, XPS, TOF-SIMS and <b>adhesive</b> peel <b>bead</b> test. The results show that APPT treatment can clean the surface, improve the wetting, improve the bonding but reduce the number of non bridging oxygen for the adhesive to bond to. The highest measured spot temperature of the glass during APPT was measured up to 270  °C, but the temperature was depending on process parameters. A reduction in non bridging oxygen was also seen during heating of the reference glass at 100  °C. A further reaction was seen when measured after a 550  °C heating. A modified APPT treatment with deionized water as precursor was used. The results show that the APPT with water does not lower the level of non bridging oxygen and the bonding was further improved.|$|R
40|$|The {{decorator}} worm, a sedentary predator, {{builds a}} micro-reef on {{the portion of}} its tube above the sediment, which attracts prey. When tube tops are clipped in the lab, the worm rebuilds compulsively. Glass beads and antifouling materials were used as decoration substrates to characterize bioadhesive biochemistry and adhesion to antifouling substrate. Decorator worm adhesive was largely proteinaceous with phosphate presence {{and a lack of}} glycoprotein. The Introduction explains the scientific context for studying natural underwater adhesives, including efforts to understand conserved molecular mechanisms in underwater adhesion to further fouling prevention on boat hulls or medical implants and biomimicking natural glues for industrial or biomedical applications. The Methods provides detailed steps to test decorator worm adhesive for protein, phosphoprotein, and glycoprotein presence. This section also provides details on how to make worms decorate with antifouling substrates. The Results section shows that decorator worm bioadhesive is highly proteinaceous and has higher phosphate presence in the tube as compared to glue on glass <b>beads.</b> The <b>adhesive</b> did not contain significant glycoprotein. The decorator worm adheres mixed ion exchange resin, synthetic ion exchange resin, strongly basic anion exchange resin, aminopropyl silane modified glass particles (. 5 - 10 μm), imitation seagrass, plastic zip ties, iPhone cases, silicone, silicone infused with octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D 4) and silicone infused with decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D 5) to its tube. This report details findings on the decorator worm as a novel system for studying adhesive and antifouling materials: •	Adhesive shows high protein content •	Tube adhesive shows higher phosphoprotein than <b>adhesive</b> on glass <b>beads</b> •	<b>Adhesive</b> shows little to no glycoprotein presence •	Decorator worms adheres all materials tested to their tubes •	Decorator worms relatively large size and readiness to adhere any material to the exterior tubes make them excellent candidates to testing antifoul release material...|$|R
