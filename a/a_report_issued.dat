5|$|Hurricane Pauline lightly {{affected}} {{the state of}} Chiapas, but severely affected Oaxaca and Guerrero, two of the poorest regions of Mexico. The area most impacted was the region in and around Acapulco. Throughout the country, Hurricane Pauline resulted in $447.8million in damage (1997USD). <b>A</b> <b>report</b> <b>issued</b> by the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs reported 137deaths three days after Hurricane Pauline. Four days {{after the passage of}} the hurricane, a Reuters news report stated there were 173dead with about 200missing, while the government of Mexico issued a statement reporting 149deaths. Ultimately, media reports indicated a death toll of at least 230people, and the Mexican Red Cross estimated 400dead and at least 1,900missing. The Church World Service estimated at least 500people were killed. Relief Web suggests that 217 fatalities were reported and 600,000 people were impacted. Approximately 300,000 people were left homeless due to the storm.|$|E

5|$|Culverhouse was {{described}} as late as 1982 as a rare owner who was popular with players, coaches, and fans. He was commended for allowing his staff to handle football operations without interference, and for having the patience to allow John McKay {{to follow through with}} his building plan despite the franchise's 0–26 start. This changed after events surrounding the 1982 players' strike. <b>A</b> <b>report</b> <b>issued</b> by the National Football League Players Association {{prior to the start of}} negotiations revealed that the Buccaneers had the fifth-highest gross income of all NFL teams, while their average salary was only the 21st-highest. This directly contradicted statements made by Culverhouse in 1980, in which he told players that they were on one of the three highest-paid teams. The NFLPA figures showed that the Buccaneers were actually the third lowest-paying team, based on total salaries as a percentage of gross income. Culverhouse was then accused of trying to divide the players during the strike, when some of the team's assistant coaches contacted players to ask whether they would be willing to return to the team should training facilities be reopened.|$|E
5|$|GMG Radio {{was taken}} over by rival Global Radio in June 2012. Global's {{purchase}} of the company was referred to Ofcom, the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission amid concerns that Global's market share may be disproportionately large {{as a result of the}} deal, and consequently not in the public interest. GMG Radio subsequently changed its name to Real and Smooth Radio Ltd. <b>A</b> <b>report</b> <b>issued</b> by the Competition Commission in May 2013 highlighted competitiveness issues and recommended a full or partial sale of Real and Smooth. Real and Smooth Radio Ltd and Global continued to operate as separate companies while the takeover was investigated. Smooth moved its operations from Manchester to Global's London headquarters in October 2013. In February 2014, Global were given permission to remove Smooth from the Digital One platform and replace it with another station. Global also sold eight of its regional stations, including three operated under the Smooth brand, and announced that Smooth would replace much of its Gold network on the medium wave frequency. The Smooth brand was relaunched as a network of regional stations in March 2014.|$|E
5|$|Operation Varsity was {{the only}} time the Locust was used in action with the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment or the British Army as a whole. <b>A</b> <b>report</b> <b>issued</b> {{at the end of a}} conference held by the Director (Air) of the War Office in January 1946 {{confirmed}} that the Locust design was considered obsolete; any light tanks to be used in post-war airborne formations would be made from completely new designs. The British Army disposed of a small number of Locusts by transferring them to foreign militaries. Several had their main armaments removed and were used by the Belgian Army as command tanks for their M4 Sherman regiments, and a few Locusts even found their way back to the U.S., where they had their turrets removed and served as agricultural tractors. A larger number of Locusts served with the Egyptian Army, replacing a number of older tank models, such as the Vickers-Armstrong Mark V light tank, that the Egyptian military had acquired during the interwar period. Several company-sized units of Locusts were used by the Egyptians during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.|$|E

25|$|On 22 February 2007, Saint Martin and Saint Barthélemy {{were broken}} {{away from the}} French {{overseas}} department of Guadeloupe to form new overseas collectivities.

While <b>a</b> <b>report</b> <b>issued</b> by the French parliament suggested that the islands remained within the EU as outermost regions, European Commission documents listed them as being outside the European Community.

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of this period, there was hope by activists that gains would be made in the area of contraception and a woman's right to her own body choices. President Luis Echeverría had convened the Interdisciplinary Group for the Study of Abortion, which included anthropologists, attorneys, clergy (Catholic, Jewish and Protestant), demographers, economists, philosophers, physicians, and psychologists. Their findings, in <b>a</b> <b>report</b> <b>issued</b> in 1976, were that criminality of voluntary abortion should cease and that abortion services {{should be included in the}} government health package. The recommendations were neither published or implemented. In 1980 feminists convinced the Communist Party to table a bill for voluntary motherhood, but it never moved forward. In 1983, a proposal was made to modify the penal code, but strong reaction from conservative factions dissuaded the government from action.|$|E

30|$|A reopening {{occurs when}} someone explictly changes {{the status of}} <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>report</b> to REOPENED, which can only happen when the <b>issue</b> <b>report</b> is closed. It may appear that reopenings and late backouts should always occur together, {{but this is not}} the case. Sometimes <b>a</b> closed <b>issue</b> <b>report</b> is prematurely reopened because of misunderstandings. For instance, after a {{developer}} reopens <b>an</b> <b>issue</b> <b>report,</b> <b>a</b> second developer may argue that the problem found by the first is in fact a different issue, and then change the status back to RESOLVED. Therefore, reopening may imply a valid rejection, when it is followed by a late backout, or may just signal communication problems.|$|R
