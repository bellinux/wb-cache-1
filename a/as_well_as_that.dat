5|$|Alley's {{retirement}} {{was marked}} {{by a series of}} discharges from the military, trials, and prison sentences. At one trial, Zinsou's conduct sparked another coup led by Kouandété. On October 26, 1972, Mathieu Kérékou seized power in a coup. He ended Alley's military career, <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> of every other senior officer, and named Alley commissioner of the National Oil Wells (SNADAH), a role with very little responsibility. Kérékou accused Alley of plotting against him on February 28, 1973, and sentenced the latter to 20 years in prison. He died on March 28, 1987.|$|E

Contemporary valuations of the lands he controlled at the death of King Edward, as listed in Domesday Book, come to an annual income of about 2500 pounds. There is little evidence, however, that he enriched either Canterbury or Winchester. He also appointed his followers to sees within his diocese in 1058, having Siward named Bishop of Rochester and Æthelric installed as Bishop of Selsey. Between his holding of two sees and the appointment of his men to other sees in the southeast of England, Stigand was an important figure in defending the coastline against invasion.|$|E

This provoked the reaction of various provincial governors <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> of powerful interest groups in Baghdad itself, such as the caliphal bodyguards. Against them, Ibn Ra'iq employed Bajkam and his Turkish supporters. With their aid, he managed to neutralize the Hujari and Saji guard units, after which, in February 937, Bajkam was rewarded with the posts of sahib al-shurta (chief of police) and governor of the eastern provinces.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the fall of Gush Etzion, news of Degania's {{successful}} stand (<b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> of Kfar Darom) provided a morale boost for other Israeli villages. The battle also influenced British opinion on {{the balance of power in}} the war. The success of the Napoleonchik field cannons prompted the Israeli high command to re-use two of them in attempts to capture Latrun. The flight from Masada and Sha'ar HaGolan, on the other hand, stirred controversy in the young state, fueled by news of the Kfar Etzion massacre just days before, and the Palmach issued a newsletter accusing them of abandoning national assets, among other things. These accusations were subsequently repeated in media and in a play by Yigal Mossensohn, and a campaign was started by the villagers to clear their name.|$|E

5|$|On 1 April 1899, the German {{government}} took formal control, establishing a protectorate. A treaty with Spain, signed on 30 July, ensured German control over several other island {{groups in the}} Pacific, and these {{were added to the}} protectorate of German New Guinea. The economic life of German New Guinea's small population of European and Asian settlers, <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> of its Melanesian population, relied heavily on the export of copra and the import of goods and services. It remained a modest outpost, and by August 1914 only 1,273 Europeans lived in the colony, while there was also a small but significant number of Japanese, Chinese and Malays.|$|E
5|$|Once the Alien and Sedition Acts were passed, the Federalists {{pushed for}} this letter to be {{printed in the}} Vermont Journal, which Spooner did, thus adding {{additional}} charges against Lyon. One other charge included publishing letters written by the poet Joel Barlow, which Lyon had read at political rallies. These also were published prior to the Acts.

In Lyon's particular case, there was the aforementioned letter to Alden Spooner <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> of Barlow, which meant Lyon felt entitled to bring up the Constitution's safeguards against ex post facto laws.
