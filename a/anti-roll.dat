5|$|Frahm <b>anti-roll</b> {{tanks were}} fitted during construction, but these {{proved to be}} ineffective; the tanks only reduced rolling by 33%. Bilge keels were later added to improve stability, and the space {{previously}} used for the <b>anti-roll</b> tanks was instead used as extra fuel storage. The ship was able to carry an additional 180 t(200 short tons) of coal in the <b>anti-roll</b> tanks. Von der Tanns hull consisted of 15 watertight compartments, and a double bottom extended for 75% of the ship's length. The ship was known to have good maneuvering characteristics, with a speed loss of 60% and a heel of 8degrees at full rudder.|$|E
5|$|The DB9 also {{contains}} <b>anti-roll</b> bars and double wishbone suspension, supported by coil springs. To keep the back-end in control under heavy acceleration or braking, the rear suspension has additional anti-squat and anti-lift technology. Later {{versions of the}} car also features three modes for the tuning: normal, for every-day use, sport, for more precise movement {{at the cost of}} ride comfort, and track, which furthers the effects of the sport setting.|$|E
5|$|The rear-wheel {{steering}} was {{dropped from the}} production car to save weight and reduce complexity, as was the height adjustable suspension and active aerodynamic technology. The suspension fitted to the production model consisted of front and rear independent suspension, double unequal length wishbones, inboard coil springs and <b>anti-roll</b> bars, with Bilstein gas-filled dampers. The suspension was designed {{in accordance with the}} FIA Group C specifications.|$|E

40|$|The {{high-speed}} catamaran boat used by {{this study}} has attached trim tabs to the stern both sides as the antirolling 	device for reducing the rolling. A PD control was initially employed in the system, and the observed data from 	the instrument showed the <b>anti-rolling</b> effect. However no significant improvement was observed for passengers 	although instrumental data showed good results. Therefore, it is not evaluated highly as the <b>anti-rolling</b> device. In 	this paper, fuzzy control system {{is applied to the}} <b>anti-rolling</b> device of a high-speed catamaran boat in order to improve 	the passenger comfort. Measurements of rolling data using the real ship were carried out. From the analysis 	results of the frequency analysis, the presented fuzzy control system suppressed the rolling of ship about 60 % in 	maximum peak than the PD control. Also, crews have felt the <b>anti-rolling</b> effect of the fuzzy control, and it showed 	that this system provided good comfort ride. 本研究で扱う高速双胴船には,横揺れの低減のためのアンチ・ローリング装置として,両側の船尾にト 	リムタブが取り付けられている. この装置の制御にはPD制御が用いられており,計測器から得られるデー 	タより,減揺効果がある程度認められている. しかし,実際の乗客の体感としては,さほど効果が得られ 	ておらず,減揺装置としては高い評価が得られていない. そこで本論文では,乗客の乗り心地を改善する 	ために,高速双胴船のアンチ・ローリング装置の制御にファジィ制御を用いる. 実船における実験より, 	ローリングデータを計測し,周波数分析を行った. 分析結果より,最大ピーク時でファジィ制御の方がPD 	制御より約 60 %揺動が抑制されていた. また,ファジィ制御の揺動抑制効果は乗組員によっても体感する 	ことができ,スムーズな制御を感じることができた...|$|R
5|$|Sebastian Vettel's {{momentum}} continued {{one week}} later in Korea, winning his third consecutive race and taking a six-point championship lead as Fernando Alonso finished third. Vettel overcame pole-sitter Mark Webber at the start, and was aided in building up a lead by first-lap contact between Jenson Button, Nico Rosberg and Kamui Kobayashi that saw Button and Rosberg retire with damage from the collision; Rosberg pulled over on the approach to the third turn, forcing a protracted yellow flag period as marshalls attempted to retrieve his car. With the sporting regulations banning overtaking while yellow flags were shown, the field was effectively thinned out in the opening laps as drivers were unable to pass one another. Tyre management {{became the focus of}} the race, as drivers reported heavy graining, particularly on the right-front tyre, which bore most of the load over a lap of the circuit. Vettel ignored six radio calls from his pit wall cautioning him that a tyre failure was imminent, only backing off just enough in the final few laps to secure victory over Webber by six seconds. The team later denied that there had ever been a problem with Vettel's tyres. Further down the order, Scuderia Toro Rosso's Jean-Éric Vergne and Daniel Ricciardo fought their way from sixteenth and twenty-first on the grid to finish eighth and ninth, while Romain Grosjean drove a conservative race to finish seventh, having been warned beforehand by the stewards that another first-lap altercation would likely result in his disqualification from the race. Lewis Hamilton's day went from bad to worse when an <b>anti-roll</b> bar on his McLaren failed, while the car handled its tyres so poorly that he was forced to make an unscheduled stop {{in order to make it}} to the finish, only to tear up a length of astroturf that wreaked havoc on his downforce and he slid down to tenth place, narrowly fending off an opportunistic charge from Sergio Pérez to take the final World Championship point on offer. Button's retirement and Hamilton's single point meant that McLaren lost second place in the World Constructors' Championship to Ferrari, and Hamilton admitted that his bid to be the 2012 World Drivers' Champion was over.|$|E
5|$|The final race in Europe {{took place}} at Monza. Ferrari's early bid to put Fernando Alonso on pole {{position}} by way of using Felipe Massa to offer him a slipstream ended in disaster when Alonso's rear <b>anti-roll</b> bar failed in the final period of qualifying, leaving the championship leader marooned in tenth while Lewis Hamilton took pole. Hamilton asserted early control over the race, and while Ferrari made significant ground early on to be running second and third – despite losing the data uplink between their cars and the pit wall that provided them with telemetry – it was Sergio Pérez who proved to be Hamilton's biggest challenge. Starting outside the top ten, Pérez elected to start on the harder compound tyres and complete one stop, producing fastest lap after fastest lap as McLaren's confidence was broken when Jenson Button's car was paralysed by a fuel pressure problem. Hamilton would ultimately prevail, but {{he was forced to}} push in the final few laps to maintain his lead, and won the race by four seconds as Pérez claimed his third podium of the season with second place. Alonso went on to finish third, benefiting from Button's retirement and a drive-through penalty for Sebastian Vettel when the reigning World Champion forced him so wide through the Curva Grande that Alonso was forced off the circuit. Bruno Senna later criticised the race stewards for not penalising Paul di Resta for a similar altercation on the approach to the Variante della Roggia early in the race. Meanwhile, with Romain Grosjean serving his suspension, Lotus enlisted former Marussia F1 driver Jérôme d'Ambrosio as their second driver for the weekend. He qualified sixteenth, and went on to finish thirteenth overall.|$|E
25|$|A notable {{advantage}} of the FRP transverse leaf springs—when supported with widely spaced, pivotable mounts—is the ability to supplement or replace the <b>anti-roll</b> bar. Typically springs that provide a sufficient ride rate need a supplemental spring (the <b>anti-roll</b> bar) to increase the suspension roll rate. The coupling of {{the two sides of}} the transverse leaf spring across the vehicle results in an <b>anti-roll</b> bar like behavior. Corvette engineers have cited this property as enabling the use of a lighter <b>anti-roll</b> bar, and even eliminating the rear <b>anti-roll</b> bar on some versions of the seventh generation Corvette.|$|E

25|$|Indigo 3000, a Swedish made, low volume roadster. Due to the <b>anti-roll</b> {{properties}} of the transverse leaf-spring, the car does not employ a separate front <b>anti-roll</b> bar.|$|E
25|$|The {{suspension}} was upgraded {{with the}} addition of a rear <b>anti-roll</b> bar, essentially the same bar as used on the Oldsmobile 442 and Buick Gran Sport. The front <b>anti-roll</b> bar was slightly stiffer. The result was a useful reduction in body lean in turns and a modest reduction of understeer.|$|E
25|$|For the suspension, the B31 {{featured}} double wishbones, {{coil springs}} over dampers with an <b>anti-roll</b> {{bar at the}} front, and single top links, twin lower links, twin trailing arms, coil springs over dampers with an <b>anti-roll</b> bar at the rear. The brakes were ventilated discs all round, and the car had rack-and-pinion steering. As the car weighed , it had a power-to-weight ratio of exactly 0.5hp/kg.|$|E

50|$|The {{structure}} of the <b>anti-rolling</b> controller {{is a set of}} gyro-controlled air valve system to steer the roll rudders on both sides of a torpedo.|$|R
25|$|The Fiat 128 used {{a similar}} {{system with a}} more {{traditional}} multi-leaf steel spring but configured with two pivots to provide the <b>anti-roll</b> effect.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{manufactures}} have produced vehicles or concepts utilizing independent front or rear suspensions supported by transverse leaf springs {{that have an}} <b>anti-roll</b> effect.|$|E
25|$|The Enzo has 4 wheel {{independent}} suspension with push-rod actuated shock absorbers which can be adjusted from the cabin, complemented with <b>anti-roll</b> bars at the front and rear.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the most}} famous ships to first use an <b>anti-rolling</b> gyro was the 1930 Italian {{passenger}} liner [...] which had three large gyros to control roll.|$|R
5000|$|Following in the White Star {{tradition}} of names ending in -ic, the Columbus was renamed Homeric. Finally completed in late 1921, the Homeric was handed {{over by a}} reluctant builder. The new liner had performed remarkably well on her trials, hinting at a characteristic that would earn her many loyal passengers: stability. By some fluke of design, the Homeric was virtually a roll-less ship unlike for instance the French Line's [...] There were no great Frahm's <b>Anti-Rolling</b> tanks or <b>anti-rolling</b> gyroscopes, just an exceptionally balanced hull and form.|$|R
25|$|Together with Mitsubishi the Ferretti {{group has}} {{developed}} a system called ARG (<b>anti-rolling</b> gyro), which reduces {{the effects of the}} waves on their boats, using a counterweight and a gyroscope.|$|R
25|$|All {{cars are}} {{required}} to use a double wishbone setup for the front suspension and independent rear suspension. Both {{the front and rear}} suspension systems feature adjustable shock absorbers and an <b>anti-roll</b> bar which can be adjusted from the cockpit.|$|E
25|$|ZF {{released}} a concept rear suspension design, in October 2009, using a composite spring-based rear suspension. The strut-based suspension uses a {{transverse leaf spring}} to function as both ride and <b>anti-roll</b> spring. The ZF concept differs from the system used on the Corvette by using the leaf spring {{as one of the}} suspension links.|$|E
25|$|Front {{suspension}} was by upper A-arms {{and lower}} lateral links triangulated by the <b>anti-roll</b> bar. Rear suspension was by tapering box-section trailing arms and lower lateral links. The half-shafts had {{no provision for}} plunge and handled some of the lateral forces. There were coil-over shock absorbers and disc brakes at all four corners. Steering was by an unassisted rack and pinion.|$|E
50|$|The {{ships were}} an {{enlarged}} version of previous designs with a longer raised forecastle, and Frahm-type <b>anti-rolling</b> tanks. An extra 4 in gun was added {{and the number}} of torpedo tubes reduced.|$|R
50|$|A {{single drive}} shaft {{is going through}} the section to the tail. This rear float section has a machine oil tank, a rudder controller, an <b>anti-rolling</b> controller, and roll rudders on both sides.|$|R
50|$|The <b>anti-rolling</b> {{controller}} {{is actually}} a steering controller to stabilize the rolling motion of the torpedo by roll rudders on both sides. The roll rudders work within angler range +/-22.5 degrees, twisting in ailerons manner.When a torpedo is rolling or rolls to some degree, the <b>anti-rolling</b> controller twists those rudders in the counter-rolling direction. When a torpedo is rolling back to its neutral position of 0 degree, the controller sense it and switches roll rudders {{in the opposite direction}} to break angular velocity of torpedo rolling back, or countersteering. They naval engineers called this operation as countersteer as they modeled it to steer a ship.|$|R
25|$|As with {{previous}} production-based Mustang race cars, Multimatic Engineering was engaged by Ford Performance {{to develop a}} complete turn-key race-only version of the S550 Shelby GT350R. The resulting competition derivative, the GT350R-C, features safety equipment and roll-over protection homologated to FIA and IMSA specifications; Bosch MS5.0 ECU and ABS controller; MoTeC instrumentation and datalogging; adjustable <b>anti-roll</b> bars; Multimatic DSSV spool-valve dampers and other competition upgrades.|$|E
25|$|The Roadsport {{is now the}} second-level {{offering}} from Caterham. It {{is available}} in both S3 and SV chassis sizes, and {{is more or less}} the former Classic with a more powerful engine and a few more extras as standard: heater; hood; spare wheel/carrier; carpets. The engine options are based around the Ford Sigma 1.6 (125bhp, 140bhp) and the Ford Duratec 2.0 (175bhp). Suspension is double-wishbone and <b>anti-roll</b> bar at the front; de dion axle located by an A-frame at the rear, where the old Classic specification had a live-axle set-up.|$|E
25|$|Changes {{outside of}} the engine were less extreme, but with a {{distinction}} between the third and fourth generation, with changes of the engine hood. The Tremec T56 transmission was replaced with a new Tremec TR6060 with triple first-gear synchronizers and doubles for higher gears. The Dana M44-4 rear axle from the 2003–2006 model now has a GKN ViscoLok speed-sensing limited-slip differential that greatly helps the tires in getting grip under acceleration. Another performance upgrade was the removal of run-flat tires; the new Michelin Pilot Sport 2 tires increased grip and driver feedback and, along with revised suspension (springs, <b>anti-roll</b> bars, and shock valving), made the Viper more neutral in cornering.|$|E
50|$|The {{stabilizer}} or <b>anti-rolling</b> controller is {{a mechanical}} control system, whose control design needs numerical analysis of physical mathematics theory to fit stability. A spinning gyroscope of control system senses the tilt degree of roll, {{and then the}} controller is centering the roll of the torpedo.|$|R
50|$|Type 91 aerial torpedoes won {{the admiration}} by the <b>anti-rolling</b> {{controller}} with acceleration control system of early days. Type 91 {{already had a}} shed-off type wooden tail plates as aerodynamic stabilizer. But the running out problem merged as aircraft speed going up from 130 to 180 knots.|$|R
50|$|In the test, {{the system}} working was {{observed}} and proved by the developed high-speed movie film, the top-view {{shot of the}} falling torpedo tested, taken from the bomb bay. The <b>anti-rolling</b> system also proved the controller functions effectively under the water surface by the running result after the water entry.|$|R
