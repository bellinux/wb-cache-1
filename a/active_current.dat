5|$|Modern {{morphology}} recognises {{a continuum}} between the major morphological categories of root, stem (caulome), leaf (phyllome) and trichome. Furthermore, it emphasises structural dynamics. Modern systematics {{aims to reflect}} and discover phylogenetic relationships between plants. Modern Molecular phylogenetics largely ignores morphological characters, relying on DNA sequences as data. Molecular analysis of DNA sequences from most families of flowering plants enabled the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group to publish in 1998 a phylogeny of flowering plants, answering {{many of the questions}} about relationships among angiosperm families and species. The theoretical possibility of a practical method for identification of plant species and commercial varieties by DNA barcoding is the subject of <b>active</b> <b>current</b> research.|$|E

25|$|Electric {{machines}} with a transformer circuit topology, such as induction machines, induction doubly-fed electric machines, and induction or synchronous wound-rotor doubly-fed (WRDF) machines, exhibit very high bursts of torque because the emf-induced <b>active</b> <b>current</b> {{on either side}} of the transformer oppose each other and thus contribute nothing to the transformer coupled magnetic core flux density, which would otherwise lead to core saturation.|$|E
50|$|Capacitive load {{means that}} there will be a {{reactive}} current in addition to the real <b>active</b> load <b>current.</b> This reactive current will increase the total RMS current delivered by the AC-output stage. The Rectiverter has a maximum RMS current limitation set by the need for protecting the AC output fuse in continuous operation. The max RMS current for continuous operation is therefore set to approximately 150% of the nominal <b>active</b> RMS <b>current</b> limitation,IP_max.|$|R

25|$|When optimally {{designed}} {{within a}} given core saturation constraint and for a given <b>active</b> <b>current</b> (i.e., torque current), voltage, pole-pair number, excitation frequency (i.e., synchronous speed), and air-gap flux density, all categories of electric motors or generators will exhibit virtually the same maximum continuous shaft torque (i.e., operating torque) {{within a given}} air-gap area with winding slots and back-iron depth, which determines the physical size of electromagnetic core. Some applications require bursts of torque beyond the maximum operating torque, such as short bursts of torque to accelerate an electric vehicle from standstill. Always limited by magnetic core saturation or safe operating temperature rise and voltage, the capacity for torque bursts beyond the maximum operating torque differs significantly between categories of electric motors or generators.|$|E
25|$|The {{brushless}} wound-rotor synchronous doubly-fed (BWRSDF) {{machine is}} the only electric machine with a truly dual ported transformer circuit topology (i.e., both ports independently excited with no short-circuited port). The dual ported transformer circuit topology {{is known to be}} unstable and requires a multiphase slip-ring-brush assembly to propagate limited power to the rotor winding set. If a precision means were available to instantaneously control torque angle and slip for synchronous operation during motoring or generating while simultaneously providing brushless power to the rotor winding set, the <b>active</b> <b>current</b> of the BWRSDF machine would be independent of the reactive impedance of the transformer circuit and bursts of torque significantly higher than the maximum operating torque and far beyond the practical capability of any other type of electric machine would be realizable. Torque bursts greater than eight times operating torque have been calculated.|$|E

In its introduction this work {{deals with a}} description of the <b>current</b> <b>active</b> elements, such as current conveyor, transconductance operational amplifier and current follower. Further the text pays attention to the possiblities of the circuits for modification signals in analogue technology. First are described circuits of diode limiters and transducer. Great attention is paid to the amplifiers with <b>current</b> <b>active</b> elements. Are propřed simulated and practically realized circuits of universal precise full-wave rectifiers using operational amplifier and current conveyor and made comparisons of known and proposed circuits. The paper also discussed other circuit structures using of <b>current</b> <b>active</b> elements, such as multiplier, divider, a triangular signal generator and oscillators...|$|R

2500|$|In 1963 Fairchild's analog IC lineup, {{designed}} to military specifications, {{consisted of three}} amplifier circuits. Fairchild engineers before Widlar designed analog ICs like conventional circuits built with discrete devices. They had already realized the severe limitations of early planar process, which made this approach impractical, but had not proposed working alternatives (active loads and <b>active</b> <b>current</b> sources {{had yet to be}} invented). When the original schematic required resistor values that were too low or too high for planar process, the designers employed external nichrome thin film resistors. The resulting hybrid ICs performed poorly and were prohibitively expensive. Fairchild's R chief Gordon Moore directed the company to favor digital integrated circuits, which were relatively robust and promised high production volumes. Widlar opposed this strategy and held digital electronics in low esteem: [...] "every idiot can count to one". Talbert shared Widlar's belief and became his closest ally in the company.|$|E

This has changed during the last years: by 2008, 22 streets in Athens and its suburbs are named after him and a metro station in Athens (Agios Dimitrios, which is close to the place of his death) was renamed to carry his name (...)
