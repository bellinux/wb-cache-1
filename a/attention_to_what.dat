I've studied Buddhism and Hinduism and I've been practising yoga and obviously I {{know a lot about}} Catholicism. There are indisputable truths that connect all of them, and I find that very comforting and kind. My spiritual journey is to be open to everything. Pay <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> makes sense, be absorbed. For me, yoga is the closest thing to our real nature.|$|E

25|$|Active {{listening}} – Listening is {{more than}} just hearing what the other side is saying. Active listening involves paying close <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> is being said verbally and nonverbally. It involves periodically seeking further clarification from the person. By asking the person exactly what they mean, they may realize you are not simply walking through a routine, but rather take them seriously.|$|E
25|$|One {{comes to}} {{manifest}} {{this sort of}} love after seeing beauty here on earth and being reminded of true beauty as it was seen beyond heaven. When reminded, the wings begin to grow back, but as they are not yet able to rise, the afflicted gaze aloft and pay no <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> goes on below, bringing on the charge of madness. This is the best form that possession by a god can take, for all those connected to it.|$|E
25|$|I {{was at the}} Sydney Cricket Ground in 1982 {{when this}} unknown Canberra teenage fullback was playing in what was {{regarded}} {{as something of a}} trial, a curtain raiser to a Test against a New Zealand Under 21 side, though rarely did anyone from such a trial graduate immediately to much else. People were wandering into the ground and those who were there gave little <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> was happening on the paddock. But on this day, and not for the first time, a remarkably gifted and fleet of foot Canberra teenager swept into the backline, received the ball {{at the end of a}} pass, chip-kicked, accelerated, gathered and scored.|$|E

5|$|When {{you think}} about Goya, who painted the most horrendous {{pictures}} of violence and torture and so forth, and they're amazing, exquisite paintings, {{one of the reasons}} they're such wonderful paintings is because what he's saying is, 'Look– look at this.' So if you paint it badly or put it in the sort of wrong perspective, you draw more <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>what's</b> wrong with the image rather than looking at the image.|$|R
50|$|In an {{interview}} with San Francisco's 7x7 magazine, Daedone states that slow sex encompasses orgasmic meditation and mindful sexuality generally. She says that slow sex is not defined by speed or {{the amount of time}} spent, but rather these three ingredients: 1) developing <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>what's</b> actually present rather than fixating on a goal, 2) simplicity, a stripping away of extraneous elements down to the level of pure sensation 3) cultivating desire by learning to acknowledge and articulate it.|$|R
25|$|The IRA gave clear {{reasons for}} the execution. I think {{it is unfortunate that}} anyone has to be killed, but the furor created by Mountbatten's death showed up the hypocritical {{attitude}} of the media establishment. As a member of the House of Lords, Mountbatten was an emotional figure in both British and Irish politics. What the IRA did to him is what Mountbatten had been doing all his life to other people; and with his war record I don't think he could have objected to dying in what was clearly a war situation. He knew the danger involved in coming to this country. In my opinion, the IRA achieved its objective: people started paying <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> was happening in Ireland.|$|E
25|$|In 1931, McIntire {{was ordained}} into the {{ministry}} of the Presbyterian Church USA, serving for two years at Chelsea Presbyterian Church, Atlantic City, New Jersey. In 1933, he was called to the Presbyterian Church of Collingswood, New Jersey, near Philadelphia, the largest church in the West Jersey Presbytery. McIntire remained a resident of Collingswood {{for the rest of}} his life. The Women's Missionary Society of the Collingswood church called his <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> they perceived as a modernist perspective in the missions study book, which had been promoted by the denomination's Board of Foreign Missions. McIntire joined the conservative side in the ongoing Fundamentalist-Modernist debate, and in 1934, at Machen's invitation, he became a founding member of the Independent Board for Presbyterian Foreign Missions, an agency organized as an alternative to the denominational mission board that the conservatives claimed supported theologically liberal missionaries. The Presbyterian Church treated the new board as a challenge to its authority and demanded that the clergymen resign. After they refused, Machen, McIntire, and seven other clergymen were tried by an ecclesiastical court in 1935-36. The board members lost, and they renounced the jurisdiction of the Presbyterian Church, as did the Collingswood Presbyterian Church, only a tiny minority of whose members refused to support their young pastor.|$|E

Hines commented that: [...] "On one level , it's an attempt to focus and draw <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> Michael Jackson lived for, and not what he did. On a more {{superficial}} level, this is Sony milking his legacy. Any true MJ fan will already own 90% of the songs that make up this two-disc set.

50|$|The filmmakers {{avoided the}} desaturated visual style that {{is typical of}} a more gritty {{documentary}} aesthetic. Deliberately drawing visual comparisons in the filming to the works of Spanish painter Francisco Goya, McQueen explained:When you think about Goya, who painted the most horrendous pictures of violence and torture and so forth, and they're amazing, exquisite paintings, {{one of the reasons}} they're such wonderful paintings is because what he's saying is, 'Look - look at this.'

500|$|The episode's script parodied {{parents who}} voiced strong {{opposition}} to South Park, portraying them as so invested in fighting the television program that {{they fail to}} pay <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> is actually {{going on in their}} children's lives. This is illustrated in the episode when Stan calls his mother seeking help because Death is chasing him, only for his mother to ignore him because she is too busy protesting the Terrance and Phillip show. This is also demonstrated by the line Kyle says, [...] "I think that parents only get so offended by television because they rely on it as a babysitter and the sole educator of their kids." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Death" [...] {{was written}} and {{directed}} by series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. The episode, along with the Terrance and Phillip show, were inspired by early criticism that South Park was little more than flatulence jokes and primitive animation. The script portrays the parents as so invested in protesting television programs, they fail to pay any <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> is actually going on in their children's lives. They seem to want to make television clean and wholesome so the entertainment industry can raise their kids so they themselves don't have to make the time and effort to be full-time parents. The episode also advocates against censorship and addresses the morality and ethics of euthanasia.|$|E

500|$|The series' creators {{completed}} {{the first draft}} of the hour-long finale in January 2004, four months prior to its airing on May 6. Before writing the episode, David Crane, Marta Kauffman and Kevin S. Bright decided to watch the series finales of other sitcoms, paying <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> worked and what did not. Kauffman found that they liked the ones which stayed true to the series, and they found the finale of The Mary Tyler Moore Show to be the gold standard. The writers had difficulty writing the finale, and spent several days thinking about the final scene without being able to write a word. Crane said that {{they did not want to}} do [...] "something high concept, or take the show out of the show".|$|E
500|$|... "Together Again" [...] {{received}} positive reviews. BBC {{deemed it}} a [...] "thumping great hit, an old-fashioned piece of professional dance music, played perfectly". Music critic Joey Guerra from The Daily Cougar stated, [...] "Jackson pours her heart into [...] "Together Again," [...] which builds to an ecstatic house beat" [...] which takes [...] "a {{cue from the}} soaring melodies of '60s girl groups". He further commented that the song is [...] "genuine happy-feeling. It sounds lame at first but pay <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> she's singing; that vocal smile changes everything." [...] "She even makes a bid for gay icon status", wrote Neil McCormick {{in a review of}} The Velvet Rope for The Daily Telegraph, [...] "delivering a diva-ish performance reminiscent of Diana Ross on 'Together Again'." ...|$|E

The problem with being an academic perv these days is that one day sooner or later, the truth will out." [...] Lesbian culture website AfterEllen.com opined [...] "she doesn't seem like the type of woman to give up without a fight" [...] where Sarah and Mike are concerned.

In his book, Earthforce!, Watson advises readers to make up facts and figures when they need to, and to deliver them to reporters confidently. He also states that the [...] "truth is irrelevant" [...] {{due to the nature}} of mass media. In response to criticism that he manipulates the media, Watson has stated: [...] "What we do is provide the media with the kind of stories they can't resist... and this is how we bring <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>what's</b> happening <b>to</b> the whales, the seals, the sharks and the other marine conservation campaigns we're involved in." ...|$|R

The producer insisted that despite the abundance of pop music on the charts at that time, they did not pay much <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> was being played on Top 40 radio. Instead, they focused on their own music and the [...] "bubble of creativity" [...] they were living in. Orbit also revealed, [...] "We liked what we're doing in this current time and space," [...] he continued. [...] "What we tended to do was watch old French films from the '60s or listen to music that was so far away that it wasn't, in any way, relevant." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics praised End of Watch for its {{avoidance}} of clichés {{often used in}} police films, particularly the buddy cop genre. Peter Debruge of Variety wrote that [...] "Like a knife in the eye, End of Watch cuts past the cliches of standard police procedurals" [...] and praised Ayer for depicting the LAPD as [...] "an honorable and efficient organization of people working together". Entertainment Weekly Lisa Schwarzbaum, who gave the film an A-, described it as [...] "one of the best American cop movies I've {{seen in a long}} time [...] also one of the few I've seen that pay serious <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> cop life feels like, both on and off duty". In a review for The Globe and Mail, however, Rick Groen opined that the focus on [...] "saintly" [...] police officers was less interesting than Ayer's [...] "trademark grit and authenticity".|$|E

5000|$|Bodhipaksa calls Blackmore's [...] "an {{extraordinary}} book: {{a sometimes}} heady but deeply rewarding read." [...] He notes how Blackmore's discussion parallels some classic ideas from Buddhism, including {{the distinction between}} awareness and awareness of awareness. Bodhipaksa criticizes Blackmore's inference from becoming aware of sounds {{that happened in the}} past to assuming that her consciousness of them is [...] "an attribution made later" [...] because he points out that sounds can persist in echoic memory for 4 seconds: [...] "A lot of Blackmore's descriptions of mindfulness seem to have involved paying <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>what’s</b> in echoic memory rather than what she was currently listening to." [...] Finally, Bodhipaksa notes that some of Blackmore's use of terminology was loose and may reflect [...] "a 'feeling' of significance that hasn't been fully thought out or articulated." ...|$|R
