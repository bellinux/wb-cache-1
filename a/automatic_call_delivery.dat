50|$|Some {{communities}} offer {{services through}} the police departments and community organizations {{to check in}} on latchkey kids. Calls {{can be made by}} community organizations or by volunteers. <b>Automatic</b> <b>calling</b> programs such as Call Reassurance call households during the week after children arrive home and require the child to answer the phone and positively acknowledge {{that he or she is}} okay. If the call is not answered, <b>automatic</b> <b>calls</b> can likewise be sent to the parents, police, or other response centers.|$|R

50|$|Historically, call centres {{have been}} built on Private branch {{exchange}} (PBX) equipment that is owned, hosted, and maintained by the call centre operator themselves. The PBX can provide functions such as <b>automatic</b> <b>call</b> distribution, interactive voice response, and skills-based routing.|$|R
50|$|However, two {{notification}} services {{similar to}} those available for physical delivery are available for e-mail. One is <b>called</b> <b>Delivery</b> Status Notifications or DSNs, {{and the other is}} termed Message Disposition Notifications or MDNs.|$|R
50|$|SmartPOST is an Estonian {{logistics}} {{company which}} specializes in delivery of goods and self-servicing post offices. Founded in 2008, SmartPOST currently operates 46 self-servicing post offices over Estonia through a solution <b>called</b> <b>Delivery</b> Point Solution (DPS).|$|R
50|$|Some {{providers}} {{achieve this}} <b>automatic</b> <b>call</b> interception and callback by encoding a program onto the SIM card. For example, Smart Voyager and Piranha Mobile in the UK, airBalticcard Mobile in Latvia, UWTMobile, and MySims2Go utilise this method to forward {{the call and}} trigger the callback.|$|R
50|$|Aspect {{was founded}} {{under the name}} Aspect Communications in 1973, when its {{solution}} powered the first call center flight booking system with an intelligent <b>Automatic</b> <b>Call</b> Distributor.

5000|$|Engines {{complied}} with Euro 3 emission standards. They included: 1.6 L in two states of tune and 1.9 L petrol engines, {{as well as}} a 1.7 L diesel. Three 5-speed transmissions were available: a manual, an automated clutch system called ACS, and a regular <b>automatic</b> <b>called</b> [...] "TouchShift." ...|$|R
30|$|This {{approach}} does, however, {{not detect}} falls {{when the person}} continues to make substantial movements afterwards, but cannot get up. In this case, {{we assume that the}} person can trigger the SOS button manuallyâ€”thus, the <b>automatic</b> <b>call</b> takes place only when the person is unable to move after the fall.|$|R
50|$|An <b>Automatic</b> <b>call</b> {{distributor}} (ACD) is {{a communication}} system that automatically queues, assigns and connects callers to handlers. This is used often in customer service (such as for {{product or service}} complaints), ordering by telephone (such as in a ticket office), or coordination services (such as in air traffic control).|$|R
50|$|Through the 1980s {{attention}} {{turned from}} pure hardware to software development. The BNR Toronto lab introduced Meridian Mail in the 1980s, which {{went on to}} be a very successful product and forced the introduction of similar products from other telephony vendors. They later added <b>automatic</b> <b>call</b> distribution and other similar services.|$|R
40|$|When a {{universal}} personal telecommunications (UPT) user visits a mobile network, both terminal mobility and personal mobility are involved and {{it may take a}} long time for UPT <b>call</b> <b>delivery</b> to the UPT user because it is required to retrieve both the terminal mobility related data in mobile network and the UPT user related data in UPT database. If the UPT database also manages location and status information of the MT on which the UPT user has registered, incoming <b>call</b> <b>delivery</b> to the UPT user can be improved in a situation. Mobility management schemes for UPT users roaming in a mobile network are analyzed. The performance is evaluated in terms of signaling cost and the number of node accesses during an InCall registration...|$|R
50|$|They were pioneers with {{continuously}} variable <b>automatic</b> transmission <b>called</b> Variomatic.|$|R
50|$|Most office {{telephone}} {{systems have}} some facility for recording calling volumes, and incoming call timing. Dispatch centers use <b>Automatic</b> <b>call</b> distribution (ACD) groups {{which can be}} evaluated for metrics such as average wait time, abandoned calls, and calls per hour. These numeric data can be entered into spreadsheets for analysis of trends.|$|R
50|$|Most {{property}} possessed {{is obtained}} {{with the consent}} of someone else who possessed it. They may have been purchased, received as gifts, leased, or borrowed. The transfer of possession of goods is <b>called</b> <b>delivery.</b> For land, it is common to speak of granting or giving possession.|$|R
50|$|Note: In {{the case}} that {{supplier}} notifies the appropriate partner in the supply chain that a promised delivery date/quantity cannot be met which is <b>called</b> <b>delivery</b> early warning (DEW), the sum of DEW issued to reduce the commit for a certain week is added in the denominator.|$|R
50|$|The {{actions that}} can be {{programmed}} may include surveys, information confirmation, contact preference confirmation, or navigation through a phone menu. An example {{of the use of}} this technology is automated phone surveys, where professional polling organizations place <b>automatic</b> <b>calls</b> to conduct surveys. Respondents are provided survey questions that are answered using DTMF-tone keypad responses.|$|R
50|$|Such {{functions}} {{can include}} in-network answering machines, 800 (freephone) numbers, <b>automatic</b> <b>call</b> forwarding, conference bridges {{and many other}} types of application. In integrated telephone networks, these are mostly implemented as functions in the telephone exchange, but in more open networks such as IP telephony networks based on the SIP protocol, these are often separate computers.|$|R
50|$|Some {{repeaters}} have <b>automatic</b> <b>call</b> sign transmission {{at regular}} intervals and use the secondary suffix /R at the call sign's end. Some jurisdictions discourage this practice {{on the grounds that}} it could be confused with an amateur from the repeater's location working portable in Russia. Similarly, some beacon stations use the unofficial secondary suffix /B.|$|R
50|$|Computer {{telephony}} integration, {{also called}} computer-telephone integration or CTI, {{is a common}} name for any technology that allows interactions on a telephone and a computer to be integrated or coordinated. The term is predominantly used to describe desktop-based interaction for helping users be more efficient, though it can also refer to server-based functionality such as <b>automatic</b> <b>call</b> routing.|$|R
50|$|This {{configuration}} is {{most often}} found on multi-line phones found at small businesses. For <b>automatic</b> <b>call</b> distributor systems with high call volumes, this is usually the least preferable method, because calls will arrive at destinations {{that are in the}} process of completing the previous call, and depending on the circumstances, may be the least prepared to take the call.|$|R

5000|$|The Order {{states the}} {{specifics}} of {{what must be done}} in order to lawfully record telephone calls. Based on the 1983 version, one way to meet the requirements may be to give a verbal warning. This often occurs by the playing of a recording in an <b>automatic</b> <b>call</b> distribution queue: [...] "Your call may be recorded or monitored for quality assurance purposes." ...|$|R
50|$|Telcordia GR-3166, Legacy Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) Gateway Generic Requirements, {{addresses}} the external signaling interfaces {{that must be}} supported by the Legacy PSAP Gateway, including a SIP interface over which emergency calls will be delivered to it via the i3 ESInet, and traditional MF and/or E-MF interfaces to legacy PSAPs for <b>call</b> <b>delivery.</b>|$|R
50|$|In telephony, a zip tone is a tone an <b>automatic</b> <b>call</b> {{distribution}} system makes to alert an agent {{in a call}} center environment that {{they are about to}} be connected to a customer. CIC by Interactive Intelligence calls it a whisper tone. The tone can be customized to hint at the nature of the call, so the agent can answer the call with the appropriate greeting.|$|R
