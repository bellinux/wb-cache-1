40|$|Field {{susceptibility}} of 13 scab-resistant apple cultivars to <b>apple</b> <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> {{was evaluated}} in 1983 - 1986. Four groups of susceptibility were distinguished. None of the 13 tested scab-resistant apple trees exhibited complete field immunity to <b>apple</b> <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew.</b> Two cultivars, 'Prima' and 'Primula', were practically resistant. 'Liberty' and two numbered selections, NY- 140 - 9 and NY- 158 - 2, {{belonged to the}} group of lower susceptibility. Moderate susceptibility was shown by: 'Novamac', 'Freedom', 'Gavin', 'Prima' and 'Florina'. The group of apple trees most susceptible to Podosphaera leucotricha included: 'Macfree', 'Priscilla' and 'Nova Easygro'. It is not necessary to use chemical sprays to control powdery mildew on 'Prima' and 'Primula'. A reduced spraying program may be recommended only under high disease pressure on less susceptible apple cultivars. A regular spray schedule is needed on moderately susceptible apple trees, but improved chemical control is necessary on the most susceptible ones...|$|E

During a study of the interactions between <b>apple</b> <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> (Podosphaera leucotricha) and Ampelomyces mycoparasites, 52 new Ampelomyces isolates were obtained from P. leucotricha and, in addition, 13 new isolates from other species of the Erysiphaceae in four European countries. Their genetic diversity was screened using single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA). For comparison, 24 isolates obtained from genetic resource collections or other sources were included in this study. Based on the ITS-SSCP patterns, the isolates were placed in eight groups. The isolates belonged to two types based on their growth in culture. The faster-growing and the slower-growing isolates were included in different SSCP groups. A phylogenetic analysis of the ITS sequences of representatives of these groups confirmed the results obtained with the SSCP method, and showed that the faster-growing isolates do not belong to Ampelomyces as suggested by earlier studies. All the isolates from P. leucotricha fell into a distinct SSCP group of genetically homogeneous isolates. This suggests that Ampelomyces mycoparasites which occur in <b>apple</b> <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> are slightly different from the other Ampelomyces groups which contain mycoparasites from various powdery mildew species. This may be because the main growth period of Ampelomyces mycoparasites in <b>apple</b> <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> is isolated in time from that of Ampelomyces isolates that occur in other species of the Erysiphaceae.

40|$|Understanding the {{mechanisms}} responsible for divergence and specialization of pathogens on different hosts is of fundamental importance, {{especially in the}} context of the emergence of new diseases via host shifts. Temporal isolation has been reported in a few plants and parasites, but is probably one of the least studied speciation processes. We studied whether temporal isolation could be responsible for the maintenance of genetic differentiation among sympatric populations of Ampelomyces, widespread intracellular mycoparasites of powdery mildew fungi, themselves plant pathogens. The timing of transmission of Ampelomyces depends on the life cycles of the powdery mildew species they parasitize. Internal transcribed spacer sequences and microsatellite markers showed that Ampelomyces populations found in <b>apple</b> <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> (Podosphaera leucotricha) were genetically highly differentiated from other Ampelomyces populations sampled from several other powdery mildew species across Europe, infecting plant hosts other than apple. While P. leucotricha starts its life cycle early in spring, and the main <b>apple</b> <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> epidemics occur before summer, the fungal hosts of the other Ampelomyces cause epidemics mainly in summer and autumn. When two powdery mildew species were experimentally exposed to Ampelomyces strains naturally occurring in P. leucotricha in spring, and to strains naturally present in other mycohost species in autumn, cross-infections always occurred. Thus, the host-related genetic differentiation in Ampelomyces cannot be explained by narrow physiological specialization, because Ampelomyces were able to infect powdery mildew species they were unlikely to have encountered in nature, but instead appears to result from temporal isolatio...|$|E

40|$|The {{question}} as to why parasites remain generalist or become specialist is a key unresolved question in evolutionary biology. Ampelomyces spp., intracellular mycoparasites of powdery mildew fungi, which are themselves plant pathogens, are a useful model for studies of this issue. Ampelomyces {{is used for the}} biological control of mildew. Differences in mycohost phenology promote temporal isolation between sympatric Ampelomyces mycoparasites. <b>Apple</b> <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> (APM) causes spring epidemics, whereas other powdery mildew species on plants other than apple cause epidemics later in the season. This has resulted in genetic differentiation between APM and non-APM strains. It is unclear whether there is genetic differentiation between non-APM Ampelomyces lineages due to their specialization on different mycohosts. We used microsatellites to address this question and found no significant differentiation between non-APM Ampelomyces strains from different mycohosts or host plants, but strong differentiation between APM and non-APM strains. A geographical structure was revealed in both groups, with differences between European countries, demonstrating restricted dispersal at the continent scale and a high resolution for our markers. We found footprints of recombination in both groups, possibly more frequent in the APM cluster. Overall, Ampelomyces thus appears {{to be one of the}} rare genuine generalist pathogenic fungi able to parasitize multiple hosts in natural populations. It is therefore an excellent model for studying the evolution of pathogens towards a generalist rather than host-specific strategy, particularly in light of the tritrophic interaction between Ampelomyces mycoparasites, their powdery mildew fungal hosts and the mildew host plants...|$|E

This biocontrol agent, an epiphytic yeast isolate called Y 16, affected neither conidia germination of V. inaequalis nor their penetration of the leaf tissue but suppressed the disease caused by this pathogen. The quantity of eggs laid by the codling moth during its second flight period on yeast treated trees was significantly different to the quantity of eggs laid on the untreated trees. In the first season of the experiments, more eggs were laid on the treated trees, especially on those tree parts closest to the fruit. These results, however, were not confirmed the following season: fewer eggs were laid on the treated trees than on the untreated trees. These conflicting observations are attributed to year-to-year variation in environmental conditions, which may affect yeast survival and activity. A 2 -month-long assay was conducted in the orchard during the codling moth's second flight period from mid-July until mid-September.

The amount of second class fruit was the highest in IPM 2, indicating a lower fruit quality in IPM 2 than in CON or IPM 1. In addition, overall disease incidences and fruit quality were generally lower in the on-farm than in the on-station conditions. Our research suggested that elements of IPM 1 can be easily adopted by apple growers. Despite the advanced integration of non-chemical control practices in IPM 2, its future adoption will depend on the control efficacy and the economic sustainability of non-chemical control practices...|$|E
40|$|Apple shoots and {{aerial parts}} of 13 other plant species {{infected}} with powdery mildews {{during the previous}} season were collected in late winter and early spring between 1998 and 2003 at a total of 34 sample sites in Hungary. Samples were examined {{for the presence of}} overwintering structures of Ampelomyces, common mycoparasites of powdery mildews. Pycnidia and resting hyphae resembling those of Ampelomyces were found on six plant species, including apple. Their viability and subsequent mycoparasitic activity of the hyphae emerging from the overwintered fungal structures were studied in vitro to determine whether they can serve as sources of primary inocula of Ampelomyces in the spring. Overwintered pycnidia of Ampelomyces collected in the spring, and produced in both the ascomata and the conidiophores of powdery mildews during the previous season, initiated the life cycle of these mycoparasites when placed close to fresh powdery mildew colonies in vitro. Similarly, thick-walled resting hyphae, found in the dried powdery mildew mycelia which covered the overwintered aerial parts of the host plants, also germinated and gave rise to new intracellular pycnidia of Ampelomyces when powdery mildew colonies were inoculated with them in vitro. On apple trees, Ampelomyces mycoparasites overwintered as resting hyphae in the dried powdery mildew mycelia covering the shoots and in the parasitized ascomata of Podosphaera leucotricha on the bark and the scales of the buds. Approximately 31 % of the field samples collected from apple trees in spring between 1998 and 2003 contained overwintered structures of Ampelomyces. Artificial bursting of apple buds in the laboratory showed that both P. leucotricha and Ampelomyces start their life cycle during or soon after bud burst, but Ampelomyces can only slowly follow the spread of its mycohost on infected leaves. Most probably, the mycoparasites did not overwinter in the dormant hyphae of P. leucotricha in the buds, but only on the bark and the bud scales, as their hyphae were not found in the young hyphae of <b>apple</b> <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> that appeared on the leaf tissues during bud burst. This study demonstrated that Ampelomyces mycoparasites can survive the winter in the field as pycnidia and as resting hyphae in the dried mycelia of their mycohosts...|$|E
40|$|<b>Powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> is {{a serious}} disease of pumpkin {{throughout}} the Northeastern United States. Control of pumpkin <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> is currently achieved {{through the use of}} a calendar-based application of fungicides. Three non-pumpkin weather-based fungicide scheduling programs for <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> were evaluated to determine their usefulness in the control of cucurbit <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> using fewer appropriately timed fungicide applications. None of the weather-based fungicide scheduling programs provided a benefit in fungicide scheduling compared to the calendar-based fungicide application scheduling when evaluated with historical weather and disease initiation data. The weather-based fungicide scheduling programs function primarily by determining conditions that are not suitable for the proliferation of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew.</b> New York State experiences favorable conditions for the growth of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> throughout the cucurbit growing season in most years, therefore reducing the utility of the weather-based fungicide scheduling programs in this region...|$|R

Explore MLO gene which related with <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> natural resistance {{is very important}} for improving the quality of melon. Resistance to <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> was examined in cultivar and wild species by leaf inoculation. The wild germplasms showed resistance to <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> Race 1. Cloning and sequence analysis of the CmMLO 2 gene identified an 85 bp difference between the wild and cultivated species. The CmMLO 2 gene was expressed in the wild germplasm after fluorescence-labeled Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. A positive transgenic plant showed successful invasion by <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> Race 1. These results suggested that the wild species might have failed to encode the MLO protein, thereby resulting in the MLO-negative regulation of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew,</b> which in turn resulted in the broad-spectrum resistance of the wild species to <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew...</b>|$|R
40|$|Nine {{different}} cultivars {{of lettuce}} were planted at the Yuma Valley Agricultural Center. Plants were treated four times with two different rates of Actigard. Control plants were not treated. Near plant maturity (Mar. 23, 2000) {{the severity of}} <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> was recorded. Among nontreated plants, Cibola, Conquistador, and Coolguard had the lowest levels of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew.</b> On the other hand, Bos 9003 and Mohawk had {{significantly higher levels of}} <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> than all other tested cultivars. Four applications of Actigard at a rate of 14 g. of active ingredient per acre significantly reduced the level of <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> on all nine tested cultivars of lettuce. On two lettuce cultivars, <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> was significantly lower when treated with Actigard at the 28 g. a. i. /A rate when compared to the 14 g. a. i. /A rate. No evidence of phytotoxicity was apparent on plants treated with Actigard. This study suggests that lettuce cultivars differ in susceptibility to <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew.</b> Also, Actigard was able to provide added protection against <b>powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> for all tested lettuce cultivars...|$|R
40|$|<b>Powdery</b> <b>mildew</b> on lettuce {{is caused}} by the fungus Golovinomyces cichoracearum (Erysiphe cichoracearum).
