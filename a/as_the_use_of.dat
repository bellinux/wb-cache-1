5|$|<b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> English in worship {{services}} spread, {{the need for}} a complete uniform liturgy for the Church became evident. Initial meetings to start what would eventually become the Book of Common Prayer were held in the former abbey of Chertsey and in Windsor Castle in September 1548. The list of participants can only be partially reconstructed, but it is known that the members were balanced between conservatives and reformers. These meetings were followed by a debate on the Eucharist in the House of Lords which took place between 14 and 19 December. Cranmer publicly revealed in this debate that he had abandoned the doctrine of the corporeal real presence and believed that the Eucharistic presence was only spiritual. Parliament backed the publication of the Prayer Book after Christmas by passing the Act of Uniformity 1549; it then legalized clerical marriage.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1860s, Levski {{developed}} a revolutionary theory that saw the Bulgarian liberation movement as an armed uprising of all Bulgarians in the Ottoman Empire. The insurrection was to be prepared, controlled and coordinated internally by a central revolutionary organisation, which was to include local revolutionary committees in all parts of Bulgaria and operate independently from any foreign factors. Levski's theory resulted from the repeated failures to implement Rakovski's ideas effectively, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> foreign-based armed detachments (чети, cheti) to provoke a general revolt. Levski's idea of an entirely independent revolution did not enjoy the approval of the entire population either—in fact, he was the only prominent Bulgarian revolutionary to advocate it. Instead, many regarded an intervention by the great powers as a more feasible solution.|$|E

5|$|Gauze is {{reputed to}} have {{originated}} in Gaza. Cloth for the Gaza thob was often woven at nearby Majdal (Ascalon). Black or blue cottons or striped pink and green fabric {{that had been}} made in Majdal continued to be woven throughout the Gaza Strip by refugees from the coastal plain villages until the 1960s. Thobs here had narrow, tight, straight sleeves. Embroidery was much less dense than that applied in Hebron. The most popular motifs included: scissors (muqass), combs (mushut) and triangles (hijab) often arranged in clusters of fives, sevens and threes, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> odd numbers is considered in Arab folklore to be effective against the evil eye.|$|E
5|$|Henry VIII died in 1547 and Edward succeeded him. Mary {{inherited}} estates in Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex, and {{was granted}} Hunsdon and Beaulieu as her own. Since Edward {{was still a}} child, rule passed to a regency council dominated by Protestants, who attempted to establish their faith throughout the country. For example, the Act of Uniformity 1549 prescribed Protestant rites for church services, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> Thomas Cranmer's new Book of Common Prayer. Mary remained faithful to Roman Catholicism and defiantly celebrated the traditional Mass in her own chapel. She appealed to her cousin Emperor Charles V to apply diplomatic pressure demanding that she be allowed to practice her religion.|$|E

In 1908 he {{was appointed}} General Manager, a position he was to hold until 1930. Selbie realised that Watkin's schemes and the expensive electrification project had left the company with major financial liabilities, and that the MR's core business in central London would come under significant pressure <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> automobiles increased and as the new Underground Electric Railways of London tube lines improved their services.

5|$|On 22 August 1958, Eisenhower {{announced}} {{a moratorium on}} nuclear testing, effective 31 October 1958. This did not mean an immediate end to testing; on the contrary, the United States, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom all rushed to perform as much testing as possible before the deadline, which the Soviets did not meet, conducting tests on 1 and 3 November. A new British test series, known as Grapple Z, commenced on 22 August. It explored new technologies such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> external neutron initiators, which had first been tried out with Orange Herald. Core boosting using tritium gas and external boosting with layers of lithium deuteride were successfully tested in the Pendant and Burgee tests, allowing a smaller, lighter Tom for two-stage devices.

5|$|Reformed Christians {{believe that}} {{immersion}} {{is not necessary}} for baptism to be properly performed, but that pouring or sprinkling are acceptable.

Reformed churches, while rejecting the baptismal ceremonies of the Roman Catholic church (such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> chrism, salt, and insufflation), accept the validity of baptisms performed with them on the basis that the substance of baptism remains.
