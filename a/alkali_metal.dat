5|$|The {{alkali metals}} {{dissolve}} slowly in liquid ammonia, forming ammoniacal solutions of solvated M+ and e−, which {{react to form}} hydrogen gas and the <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> amide (MNH2, where M represents an alkali metal): this was first noted by Humphry Davy in 1809 and rediscovered by W. Weyl in 1864. The process may be speeded up by a catalyst. Similar solutions are formed by the heavy divalent alkaline earth metals calcium, strontium, barium, {{as well as the}} divalent lanthanides, europium and ytterbium. The amide salt is quite insoluble and readily precipitates out of solution, leaving intensely coloured ammonia solutions of the alkali metals. In 1907, Charles Krause identified the colour as being due to the presence of solvated electrons, which contribute to the high electrical conductivity of these solutions. At low concentrations (below 3 M), the solution is dark blue and has ten times the conductivity of aqueous sodium chloride; at higher concentrations (above 3 M), the solution is copper-coloured and has approximately the conductivity of liquid metals like mercury. In addition to the <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> amide salt and solvated electrons, such ammonia solutions also contain the <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> cation (M+), the neutral <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> atom (M), diatomic <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> molecules (M2) and <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> anions (M−). These are unstable and eventually become the more thermodynamically stable <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> amide and hydrogen gas. Solvated electrons are powerful reducing agents and are often used in chemical synthesis.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} ternary {{fluorides}} are {{known of the}} form A7Cm6F31, where A stands for <b>alkali</b> <b>metal.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Alkali</b> <b>metal</b> cations do {{not usually}} form {{coordination}} complexes with simple Lewis bases {{due to their}} low charge of just +1 and their relatively large size; thus the Li+ ion forms most complexes and the heavier <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> ions form less and less (though exceptions occur for weak complexes). Lithium in particular has a very rich coordination chemistry in which it exhibits coordination numbers from 1 to 12, although octahedral hexacoordination is its preferred mode. In aqueous solution, the <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> ions exist as octahedral hexahydrate complexes (+), {{with the exception of}} the lithium ion, which due to its small size forms tetrahedral tetrahydrate complexes (+); the alkali metals form these complexes because their ions are attracted by electrostatic forces of attraction to the polar water molecules. Because of this, anhydrous salts containing <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> cations are often used as desiccants. Alkali metals also readily form complexes with crown ethers (e.g. 12-crown-4 for Li+, 15-crown-5 for Na+, 18-crown-6 for K+, and 21-crown-7 for Rb+) and cryptands due to electrostatic attraction.|$|E
30|$|Further, Chadha’s (1999) plot can be {{classified}} into eight fields as given below: (1) alkaline earths exceed <b>alkali</b> <b>metals,</b> (2) <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> exceed alkaline earths (3) weak acidic anions exceed strong acidic anions, (4) strong acidic anions exceed weak acidic anions, (5) alkaline earths and weak acidic anions exceed both <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> and strong acidic anions, respectively, (6) alkaline earths exceed <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> and strong acidic anions exceed weak acidic anions, (7) <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> exceed alkaline earths and strong acidic anions exceed weak acidic anions, and (8) <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> exceed alkaline earths and weak acidic anions exceed strong acidic anions. The output of Chadha’s plot (Fig.  5) is in confirmation with that of Piper trilinear diagram (Fig.  4) in that alkaline earths exceed <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> (field 1), strong acidic anions exceed weak acidic anions (field 4) and alkaline earths exceed <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> and strong acidic anions exceed weak acidic anions (field 6). Only few samples under field 5 specified that alkaline earths and weak acidic anions, respectively, exceed both <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> and strong acidic anions as indicated by Ca–Mg–HCO 3 type of water.|$|R
40|$|Finely divided {{particles}} of <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> {{are produced by}} combining <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> with certain aromatic compounds in selected solvents to form low-temperature soluble complexes from which the pure <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> precipitate quantitatively when the solutions are warmed. All operations {{must be carried out}} in an inert gas atmosphere...|$|R
5000|$|Evidence for the {{formation}} of heavy alkai metal-organic intermediates is provided by the equilibration of cis-2-Butene and trans-2-butene catalysed by <b>alkali</b> <b>metals.</b> The isomerization is fast with lithium and sodium, but slow with the higher <b>alkali</b> <b>metals.</b> The higher <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> also favor the sterically congested conformation. [...] Several crystal structures of organopotassium compounds have been reported, establishing that they, like the sodium compounds, are polymeric.|$|R
5|$|<b>Alkali</b> <b>metal</b> selenides {{react with}} {{selenium}} to form polyselenides, , which exist as chains.|$|E
5|$|Pure {{alkali metals}} are dangerously {{reactive}} with {{air and water}} and must be kept away from heat, fire, oxidising agents, acids, most organic compounds, halocarbons, plastics, and moisture. They also react with carbon dioxide and carbon tetrachloride, so that normal fire extinguishers are counterproductive when used on <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> fires. Some Class D dry powder extinguishers designed for metal fires are effective, depriving the fire of oxygen and cooling the <b>alkali</b> <b>metal.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} {{are among the}} most {{electropositive}} elements on the periodic table and thus tend to bond ionically to the most electronegative elements on the periodic table, the halogens (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, and astatine), forming salts known as the <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> halides. The reaction is very vigorous and can sometimes result in explosions. All twenty stable <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> halides are known; the unstable ones are not known, with the exception of sodium astatide, because of the great instability and rarity of astatine and francium. The most well-known of the twenty is certainly sodium chloride, otherwise known as common salt. All of the stable <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> halides have the formula MX where M is an <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> and X is a halogen. They are all white ionic crystalline solids that have high melting points. All the <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> halides are soluble in water except for lithium fluoride (LiF), which is insoluble in water due to its very high lattice enthalpy. The high lattice enthalpy of lithium fluoride is due to the small sizes of the Li+ and F− ions, causing the electrostatic interactions between them to be strong: a similar effect occurs for magnesium fluoride, consistent with the diagonal relationship between lithium and magnesium.|$|E
50|$|A similar effect {{occurs in}} caesium metal, the {{heaviest}} of the <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> {{which can be}} collected in quantities sufficient to allow viewing. Whereas the other <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> are silver-white, caesium metal has a distinctly golden hue.|$|R
30|$|In this diagram the {{difference}} in mill equivalent percentage between alkaline earths (Ca + Mg) and <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> (Na + K), expressed as percentage reacting values, is plotted on the X axis and {{the difference}} in mill equivalent percentage between weak acidic anions (CO 3  + HCO 3) and strong acidic anions (Cl + SO 4) is plotted on the Y axis. The mill equivalent percentage differences between alkaline earth and <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> and between weak acidic anions and strong acidic anions would plot {{in one of the}} four possible sub-fields of the diagram. The square or rectangular field describes the overall character of the water. In order to define the primary character of water, the rectangular field is divided into eight sub-fields, each of which represents a water type: (1) alkaline earths exceed alkali metals; (2) <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> exceed alkaline earths; (3) weak acidic anions exceed strong acidic anions; (4) strong acidic anions exceed weak acidic anions; (5) alkaline earths and weak acidic anions exceed both <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> and strong acidic anions, respectively; such water has temporary hardness; (6) alkaline earths exceed <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> and strong acidic anions exceed weak acidic anions; such water has permanent hardness; (7) <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> exceed alkaline earths and strong acidic anions exceed weak acidic anions; (8) <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> exceed alkaline earths and weak acidic anions exceed strong acidic anions.|$|R
5|$|The <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> are a group (column) in the {{periodic}} table consisting of the chemical elements lithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), caesium (Cs), and francium (Fr). This group lies in the s-block of {{the periodic}} table of elements as all <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> have their outermost electron in an s-orbital: this shared electron configuration results in them having very similar characteristic properties. Indeed, the <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> provide {{the best example of}} group trends in properties in {{the periodic table}}, with elements exhibiting well-characterised homologous behaviour.|$|R
5|$|The bioinorganic {{chemistry}} of the <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> ions {{has been extensively}} reviewed.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of pure alkali metals is somewhat complicated {{due to their}} extreme reactivity with commonly used substances, such as water. From their silicate ores, all the stable alkali metals may be obtained the same way: sulfuric acid is first used to dissolve the desired <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> ion and aluminium(III) ions from the ore (leaching), whereupon basic precipitation removes aluminium ions from the mixture by precipitating it as the hydroxide. The remaining insoluble <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> carbonate is then precipitated selectively; the salt is then dissolved in hydrochloric acid to produce the chloride. The result is then left to evaporate and the <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> can then be isolated. Lithium and sodium are typically isolated through electrolysis from their liquid chlorides, with calcium chloride typically added to lower the melting point of the mixture. The heavier alkali metals, however, is more typically isolated in a different way, where a reducing agent (typically sodium for potassium and magnesium or calcium for the heaviest alkali metals) is used to reduce the <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> chloride. The liquid or gaseous product (the <b>alkali</b> <b>metal)</b> then undergoes fractional distillation for purification.|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{fluoride}} is {{the only}} <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> halide that is poorly soluble in water, and lithium hydroxide {{is the only}} <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> hydroxide that is not deliquescent. Conversely, lithium perchlorate and other lithium salts with large anions that cannot be polarised are much more stable than the analogous compounds of the other alkali metals, probably because Li+ has a high solvation energy. This effect also means that most simple lithium salts are commonly encountered in hydrated form, because the anhydrous forms are extremely hygroscopic: this allows salts like lithium chloride and lithium bromide {{to be used in}} dehumidifiers and air-conditioners.|$|E
40|$|C 60 {{nanotubes}} {{have been}} synthesized by a solution–solution method. After degassing in a dynamic vacuum, the C 60 nanotubes were doped with <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> {{by means of}} vapor evaporation method. Different temperatures have been studied to evaporate the <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> for the doping experiments. Raman spectrum was further employed to analyze the doping concentration of the obtained samples. It was found that all three <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> (Li, Na and K) used can be efficiently doped into the C 60 nanotubes, forming AxC 60 nanotubes. The doping concentration of Li, Na changed from low to high level, depending on the experiment temperatures, while K doping always gave saturated doping. The melt points, the ionic sizes and vapor pressures of <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> were thought to affect the final doping results...|$|R
50|$|An alkalide is a {{chemical}} compound in which <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> are anions (that is, they bear a negative charge). Such species are notable because <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> were previously thought {{to appear in}} salts only as cations. Alkalide compounds have been synthesized containing a cation of the alkaline earth metal barium.|$|R
30|$|The Chadha diagram (Chadha 1999) {{was used}} to define the major water types in the areas. It is a {{modified}} version of the Piper (1944) diagram and plots the difference in milliequivalent percentage between alkaline earths (Ca + Mg) and <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> (Na + K) expressed as percentage and plotted on the x-axis. The difference in milliequivalent percentage between weak acidic anions (CO 3  + HCO 3) and strong acidic anions (Cl + SO 4) is plotted on the y-axis. The rectangular field resulting from this is similar to the diamond-shaped field in the Piper diagram and describes the overall character of the water. Thus, there are eight fields in the rectangular plot which represent eight different water types as in the case of Piper diagram. Those eight water types are: (1) alkaline earths exceed alkali metals; (2) <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> exceed alkaline earths; (3) weak acidic anions exceed strong acidic anions; (4) strong acidic anions exceed weak acidic anions; (5) alkaline earths and weak acidic anions exceed both <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> and strong acidic anions, respectively (such water has temporary hardness); (6) alkaline earths exceed <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> and strong acidic anions exceed weak acidic anions (such water has permanent hardness); (7) <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> exceed alkaline earths and strong acidic anions exceed weak acidic anions; (8) <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> exceed alkaline earths and weak acidic anions exceed strong acidic anions (Chadha 1999).|$|R
5|$|Solid state crystal {{structures}} have been determined for many complexes of <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> ions in small peptides, nucleic acid constituents, carbohydrates and ionophore complexes.|$|E
5|$|Thallium is the {{heaviest}} stable element in group 13 of the periodic table. At {{the bottom of}} the periodic table, the inert pair effect is quite strong, because of the relativistic stabilisation of the 6s orbital and the decreasing bond energy as the atoms increase in size so that the amount of energy released in forming two more bonds is not worth the high ionisation energies of the 6s electrons. It displays the +1 oxidation state that all the known alkali metals display, and thallium compounds with thallium in its +1 oxidation state closely resemble the corresponding potassium or silver compounds stoichiometrically due to the similar ionic radii of the Tl+ (164pm), K+ (152pm) and Ag+ (129pm) ions. It was sometimes considered an <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> in continental Europe (but not in England) in the years immediately following its discovery, and was placed just after caesium as the sixth <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> in Dmitri Mendeleev's 1869 periodic table and Julius Lothar Meyer's 1868 periodic table. (Mendeleev's 1871 periodic table and Meyer's 1870 periodic table put thallium in its current position in the boron group and left the space below caesium blank.) However, thallium also displays the oxidation state +3, which no known <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> displays (although ununennium, the undiscovered seventh <b>alkali</b> <b>metal,</b> is predicted to possibly display the +3 oxidation state). The sixth <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> is now considered to be francium. While Tl+ is stabilised by the inert pair effect, this inert pair of 6s electrons is still able to participate chemically, so that these electrons are stereochemically active in aqueous solution. Additionally, the thallium halides (except TlF) are quite insoluble in water, and TlI has an unusual structure {{because of the presence of}} the stereochemically active inert pair in thallium.|$|E
5|$|The {{hydroxides}} {{themselves are}} the most basic hydroxides known, reacting with acids to give salts and with alcohols to give oligomeric alkoxides. They easily react with carbon dioxide to form carbonates or bicarbonates, or with hydrogen sulfide to form sulfides or bisulfides, and {{may be used to}} separate thiols from petroleum. They react with amphoteric oxides: for example, the oxides of aluminium, zinc, tin, and lead react with the <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> hydroxides to give aluminates, zincates, stannates, and plumbates. Silicon dioxide is acidic, and thus the <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> hydroxides can also attack silicate glass.|$|E

5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} react vigorously or explosively with cold water, {{producing}} an aqueous solution of a strongly basic <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> hydroxide and releasing hydrogen gas. This reaction becomes more vigorous {{going down the}} group: lithium reacts steadily with effervescence, but sodium and potassium can ignite and rubidium and caesium sink in water and generate hydrogen gas so rapidly that shock waves form in the water that may shatter glass containers. When an <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> is dropped into water, it produces an explosion, {{of which there are}} two separate stages. The metal reacts with the water first, breaking the hydrogen bonds in the water and producing hydrogen gas; this takes place faster for the more reactive heavier alkali metals. Second, the heat generated by {{the first part of the}} reaction often ignites the hydrogen gas, causing it to burn explosively into the surrounding air. This secondary hydrogen gas explosion produces the visible flame above the bowl of water, lake or other body of water, not the initial reaction of the metal with water (which tends to happen mostly under water). The <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> hydroxides are the most basic known hydroxides.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} also react {{similarly}} with hydrogen to form ionic <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> hydrides, where the hydride anion {{acts as a}} pseudohalide: these are often used as reducing agents, producing hydrides, complex metal hydrides, or hydrogen gas. Other pseudohalides are also known, notably the cyanides. These are isostructural to the respective halides except for lithium cyanide, indicating that the cyanide ions may rotate freely. Ternary <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> halide oxides, such as Na3ClO, K3BrO (yellow), Na4Br2O, Na4I2O, and K4Br2O, are also known. The polyhalides are rather unstable, although those of rubidium and caesium are greatly stabilised by the feeble polarising power of these extremely large cations.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} and their {{hydrides}} react with acidic hydrocarbons, for example cyclopentadienes and terminal alkynes, to give salts. Liquid ammonia, ether, or hydrocarbon solvents are used, {{the most common}} of which being tetrahydrofuran. The most important of these compounds is sodium cyclopentadienide, NaC5H5, an important precursor to many transition metal cyclopentadienyl derivatives. Similarly, the alkali metals react with cyclooctatetraene in tetrahydrofuran to give <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> cyclooctatetraenides; for example, dipotassium cyclooctatetraenide (K2C8H8) is an important precursor to many metal cyclooctatetraenyl derivatives, such as uranocene. The large and very weakly polarising <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> cations can stabilise large, aromatic, polarisable radical anions, such as the dark-green sodium naphthalenide, Na+−, a strong reducing agent.|$|E
40|$|A local Heine-Abarenkov model {{potential}} {{satisfying the}} energy minimum {{condition of the}} crystal is presented for <b>alkali</b> <b>metals.</b> The remaining parameter is determined from the first zero of the original pseudopotential by Animalu and Heine themselves using the atomic energy levels from spectroscopic data. The local Heine-Abarenkov potential obtained is noticeably different for Li from the previous models. Then, the crystal energy, pressure and bulk modulus of <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> are calculated and compared {{with the results of}} the previous models by other workers. The third order contributions are also investigated, and their effects are not negli-gible but small for <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> except Li...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} examine {{volatilization}} processes of <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> at high temperature, heating experiments were carried out using a starting material prepared from Murchison (CM 2) (grain-size : ∿ 10 μm) at temperatures of 1200 - 1400 ℃ under a constant pressure of 8 × 10 ^ Torr, and heating duration up to 80 min. Analyses of alkalis (Na, K, Rb), major and minor elements and petrographic examinations were performed for run products. Results show that fractional volatilization of <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> occurred during heating. It is suggested that the volatilization rates of <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> {{are influenced by the}} chemical composition of partial melt...|$|R
25|$|Three <b>alkali</b> <b>metals</b> (sodium, potassium, and lithium) are {{the usual}} substituents.|$|R
5|$|The {{intermetallic}} compounds of the alkali metals with the heavier group 13 elements (aluminium, gallium, indium, and thallium), such as NaTl, are poor conductors or semiconductors, unlike the normal alloys with the preceding elements, {{implying that the}} <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> involved has lost an electron to the Zintl anions involved. Nevertheless, while the elements in group 14 and beyond tend to form discrete anionic clusters, group 13 elements tend to form polymeric ions with the <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> cations located between the giant ionic lattice. For example, NaTl consists of a polymeric anion (—Tl−—)n with a covalent diamond cubic structure with Na+ ions located between the anionic lattice. The larger alkali metals cannot fit similarly into an anionic lattice and tend to force the heavier group 13 elements to form anionic clusters.|$|E
5|$|All of the {{discovered}} {{alkali metals}} occur in nature as their compounds: {{in order of}} abundance, sodium is the most abundant, followed by potassium, lithium, rubidium, caesium, and finally francium, which is very rare due to its extremely high radioactivity; francium occurs only in the minutest traces in nature as an intermediate step in some obscure side branches of the natural decay chains. Experiments have been conducted to attempt the synthesis of ununennium (Uue), {{which is likely to}} be the next member of the group, but they have all met with failure. However, ununennium may not be an <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> due to relativistic effects, which are predicted to have a large influence on the chemical properties of superheavy elements; even if it does turn out to be an <b>alkali</b> <b>metal,</b> it is predicted to have some differences in physical and chemical properties from its lighter homologues.|$|E
5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} react readily with {{phosphorus}} and arsenic to form phosphides and arsenides with the formula M3Pn (where M represents an <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> and Pn represents a pnictogen – phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, or bismuth). This {{is due to}} the greater size of the P3− and As3− ions, so that less lattice energy needs to be released for the salts to form. These are not the only phosphides and arsenides of the alkali metals: for example, potassium has nine different known phosphides, with formulae K3P, K4P3, K5P4, KP, K4P6, K3P7, K3P11, KP10.3, and KP15. While most metals form arsenides, only the alkali and alkaline earth metals form mostly ionic arsenides. The structure of Na3As is complex with unusually short Na–Na distances of 328–330 pm which are shorter than in sodium metal, and this indicates that even with these electropositive metals the bonding cannot be straightforwardly ionic. Other <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> arsenides not conforming to the formula M3As are known, such as LiAs, which has a metallic lustre and electrical conductivity indicating the presence of some metallic bonding. The antimonides are unstable and reactive as the Sb3− ion is a strong reducing agent; reaction of them with acids form the toxic and unstable gas stibine (SbH3). Indeed, they have some metallic properties, and the <b>alkali</b> <b>metal</b> antimonides of stoichiometry MSb involve antimony atoms bonded in a spiral Zintl structure. Bismuthides are not even wholly ionic; they are intermetallic compounds containing partially metallic and partially ionic bonds.|$|E
