500|$|A genetically {{enhanced}} superhuman {{who used}} {{his strength and}} intellect to briefly rule much of Earth in the 1990s. Montalbán said that he believed all good villains do villainous things, but {{think that they are}} acting for the [...] "right" [...] reasons; in this way, Khan uses his anger at the death of his wife to justify his pursuit of Kirk. The film was close to production approval when it occurred to the producers that no one had asked Montalbán whether he was interested in appearing in the film despite his character having been in the scripts for more than a year. Montalbán was unsure whether he could plausibly play Khan again after many years, especially given his current role of Mr. Roarke on Fantasy Island. Contrary to speculation that Montalbán used a prosthetic chest, no artificial devices were added to emphasize Montalbán's muscular physique, since even in his 60s and despite an increasingly painful back injury, stemming from being thrown off a horse in the 1950s, Montalbán had a vigorous workout routine. Montalbán enjoyed making the film, and counted the role as a career highlight. His major complaint was that he was never face-to-face with Shatner for a scene. [...] "I had to do my lines with the script girl, who, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>imagine,</b> sounded nothing like Bill ," [...] he explained.|$|E

40|$|Good morning, everyone. It's {{a delight}} to be here, to see you all flourishing, {{and to get a}} sense of this society of evaluators contin-uing to grow in size and in accomplishments despite the inhospitable terrain in govern-ment today. I see us as being a little bit like {{suburban}} dandelions: you know [...] . people spend their whole weekend trying to get rid of them but when Monday afternoon rolls around, there they are back again in full and glorious bloom: bright, stronger than ever, and not just unabashed, but thriving. This meeting, I know, marks the point at which, as a society, we've begun to think about our past, about the paths we've trav-elled and our reasons for choosing them, and about the progress we've made, all along the line. I've been asked, in particular, to say what I think we've learned about the politics of evaluation. To do that, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> well <b>imagine,</b> I went back in time—oh, say 10 years—to remember what we used to say or write about the issue of politics in evaluation and then contrasted that with our approaches today. Here, of course, you should note that I'm speaking from my own personal per-Plenary Address to the American Evaluation Association, October 30, 1986 in Kansas City, MO. The views and opinions expressed by the author are her own and should not be construed to be the policy or position of the General Ac-counting Office. This article previously appeare...|$|R

"I have tried," [...] he continued, [...] "to {{repeat the}} exact words which {{the old man}} used to me, and I do not find it so {{difficult}} <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>imagine,</b> because at that time they made a great impression upon me. But I cannot, of course, hope to reproduce to you his terrible earnestness, the burning passion with which every word seemed to spring from his lips. Their effect upon me at that time {{you will be able}} to judge when I tell you this--that I never returned to my rooms, that for ten years I never set foot west of Temple Bar. I first joined a small society in Whitechapel, then I worked for myself, and finally I became a police-court missionary at Southwark Police-Court. The history of those years is the history of a slowly-growing madness. I commenced by trying to improve whole districts-I ended with the individual." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{could not}} have been more than two minutes {{afterward}} until we suddenly felt the waves subside, and were enveloped in foam. The boat made a sharp half turn to larboard, and then shot off in its new direction like a thunderbolt. At the same moment the roaring noise of the water was completely drowned in a kind of shrill shriek--such a sound <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>imagine</b> given out by the waste-pipes of many thousand steam-vessels, letting off their steam all together. We were now in the belt of surf that always surrounds the whirl; and I thought, of course, that another moment would plunge us into the abyss--down which we could only see indistinctly on account of the amazing velocity with which we wore borne along. The boat did not seem to sink into the water at all, but to skim like an air-bubble upon the surface of the surge. Her starboard side was next the whirl, and on the larboard arose the world of ocean we had left. It stood like a huge writhing wall between us and the horizon.|$|E
60|$|Now {{suppose a}} man comes along: {{a man who}} has no sense of the golden age, nor any power of living in the present: a man with common desires, cupidities, ambitions, just like most of the men you know. Suppose you reveal to that man the fact that if he will only pluck this gold up, and turn it into money, {{millions}} of men, driven by the invisible whip of hunger, will toil underground and overground night and day to pile up more and more gold for him until he is master of the world! You will find that the prospect will not tempt him so much <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>imagine,</b> because it involves some distasteful trouble to himself to start with, and because there is something else within his reach involving no distasteful toil, which he desires more passionately; and that is yourself. So long as he is preoccupied with love of you, the gold, and all that it implies, will escape him: the golden age will endure. Not until he forswears love will he stretch out his hand to the gold, and found the Plutonic empire for himself. But the choice between love and gold may not rest altogether with him. He may be an ugly, ungracious, unamiable person, whose affections may seem merely ludicrous and despicable to you. In that case, you may repulse him, and most bitterly humiliate and disappoint him. What is left to him then but to curse the love he can never win, and turn remorselessly to the gold? With that, he will make short work of your golden age, and leave you lamenting its lost thoughtlessness and sweetness.|$|E

60|$|My Lords, I {{will now}} come to a scene of peculation of another kind: namely, a peculation by the direct sale of offices of justice,--by the direct sale of the {{successions}} of families,--by the sale of guardianships and trusts, held most sacred among the people of India: by the sale of them, not, as before, to farmers, not, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>imagine,</b> to near relations of the families, but a sale {{of them to the}} unfaithful servants of those families, their own perfidious servants, who had ruined their estates, who, if any balances had accrued to the government, had been the cause of those debts. Those very servants were put in power over their estates, their persons, and their families, by Mr. Hastings, for a shameful price. It will be proved to your Lordships, {{in the course of this}} business, that Mr. Hastings has done this in another sacred trust, the most sacred trust a man can have,--that is, in the case of those vakeels, (as they call them,) agents, or attorneys, who had been sent to assert and support the rights of their miserable masters before the Council-General. It will be proved that these vakeels were by Mr. Hastings, for a price to be paid for it, put in possession of the very power, situation, and estates of those masters who sent them to Calcutta to defend them from wrong and violence. The selling offices of justice, the sale of succession in families, of guardianships and other sacred trusts, the selling masters to their servants, and principals to the attorneys they employed to defend themselves, were all parts of the same system; and these were the horrid ways in which he received bribes beyond any common rate.|$|E

It's so nice {{to have a lot of}} little girls to play with. But of course I like Diana best and always will. I ADORE Diana. I'm dreadfully far behind the others. They're all in the fifth book and I'm only in the fourth. I feel that it's kind of a disgrace. But there's not one of them has such an imagination as I have and I soon found that out. We had reading and geography and Canadian history and dictation today. Mr. Phillips said my spelling was disgraceful and he held up my slate so that everybody could see it, all marked over. I felt so mortified, Marilla; he might have been politer to a stranger, I think. Ruby Gillis gave me an apple and Sophia Sloane lent me a lovely pink card with 'May I see you home?' on it. I'm to give it back to her tomorrow. And Tillie Boulter let me wear her bead ring all the afternoon. Can I have some of those pearl beads off the old pincushion in the garret to make myself a ring? And oh, Marilla, Jane Andrews told me that Minnie MacPherson told her that she heard Prissy Andrews tell Sara Gillis that I had a very pretty nose. Marilla, that is the first compliment I have ever had in my life and you can't imagine what a strange feeling it gave me. Marilla, have I really a pretty nose?

The gallery was supported by richly carved double pilasters, which were later removed to Garswood Hall.

50|$|In certain ways, a {{metabolic}} pathway {{is similar to}} a factory assembly line. Products are assembled from parts by workers who each perform a specific step in the manufacturing process. Enzymes of a cell are like workers on an assembly line; each is only responsible for a particular step in the assembly process. A lag period also occurs when a new factory is constructed, a time period before finished products begin to roll off the assembly line at a steady rate. This lag period partially results from the time needed to fill supply bins with the necessary parts. <b>As</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>imagine,</b> when parts are not readily available, production slows or stops. Metabolite pools are somewhat analogous to the parts bins of a factory. The Calvin-Benson cycle will only operate at full speed when the cellular 'bins' are full of the molecular building blocks that lie between PGA and RUBP.|$|E
50|$|The 1953 Land Cruisers were {{complete}} {{departure from}} the ’47-’52 models. The 1953 model sold retail for $2316. They were built on the same frame as the new (and famous) Starliner and Starlight coupe models but, as with any new model, there were some initial problems, primarily with the fit of the front fenders. With the engine out of the car, they fit. With the engine in the car, they didn’t. This {{was found to be}} primarily the fault of using a thinner gauge steel for the frame. The theory was that if the frame could flex a little, the car would ride better. The problem was, it flexed too much. If you jacked up one corner of the car, to change a tire, for example, the frame flexed so much that you could either not open the door or could not close it. There were also fewer frame re-enforcements than in subsequent years. <b>As</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>imagine,</b> this problem caused many a late night conference and hasty fixes and tended to give the new model a bad name almost immediately.|$|E

5000|$|In an 1994 {{interview}} on BBC British television with Canadian author and politician Michael Ignatieff (whose grandfather and great-grandfather were {{ministers of the}} Czar prior to the Bolshevik Revolution), he shocked viewers {{when he said that}} the deaths of millions of Soviet citizens under Stalin would have been worth it if a genuine Communist society had been the result. Hobsbawm argued that, [...] "In a period in which, <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>might</b> <b>imagine,</b> mass murder and mass suffering are absolutely universal, the chance of a new world being born in great suffering would still have been worth backing" [...] but, unfortunately, [...] "Soviet Union was not the beginning of the World Revolution". The following year, when asked the same question on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, that is if [...] "the sacrifice of millions of lives" [...] would have been worth the future communist society, he replied: [...] "That's what we felt when we fought the Second World War", repeating what already said to Michael Ignatieff, [...] "now people says we shouldn't had World War II" [...] because of the massive number of deaths, but in fact, at the time, [...] "very few people ended up by saying 'we think it was wrong fight in World War II'", as World War II was worth fighting.|$|E
