5|$|A typical fish is ectothermic, has a {{streamlined}} body for rapid swimming, extracts oxygen from water using gills or uses an accessory breathing organ to breathe atmospheric oxygen, has {{two sets of}} paired fins, usually one or two (rarely three) dorsal fins, an anal fin, and a tail fin, has jaws, has skin that is usually covered with scales, <b>and</b> <b>lays</b> eggs.|$|E

5|$|Although it is a mimid, {{the black}} catbird {{is not known}} to imitate any other species. Its song {{is a mix of}} harsh notes and clear flute-like whistles, with the phrases repeated. It builds a cup nest in low bushes or trees, <b>and</b> <b>lays</b> two bluish eggs. It is {{threatened}} by habitat loss, and has been assessed as near threatened by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.|$|E
5|$|Apart from pit-trap-forming taxa, {{the biology}} {{of members of the}} family Myrmeleontidae, to which the antlions belong, has been little studied. The {{life-cycle}} begins with oviposition (egg-laying) in a suitable location. The female antlion repeatedly taps the prospective laying site with the tip of her abdomen and then inserts her ovipositor into the substrate <b>and</b> <b>lays</b> an egg.|$|E

5|$|A {{desert is}} not the kind of habitat that favours the {{presence}} of amphibians, with their requirement for water to keep their skins moist and for the development of their young. Nevertheless, some frogs live in deserts, creating moist habitats underground and hibernating while conditions are adverse. Couch's spadefoot toad (Scaphiopus couchii) emerges from its burrow when a downpour occurs <b>and</b> <b>lays</b> its eggs in the transient pools that form; the tadpoles develop with great rapidity, sometimes in as little as nine days, undergo metamorphosis, and feed voraciously before digging a burrow of their own.|$|E
5|$|B. coccinea is a {{host for}} the gall midge Dasineura banksiae, {{a species of}} fly that attacks <b>and</b> <b>lays</b> eggs on the leaves between late October and early December. The round white hairy galls are 5–7mm in {{diameter}} and generally contain one larva, or up to five on severely infested plants. The larvae moult and feed until January to March, when they reduce activity until early October. Although these are not harmful to the plant, they disfigure the cut foliage and hence reduce its value.|$|E
5|$|Severe C. maculatus, infestations {{can affect}} 100% of the stored peas and cause up to 60% grain loss {{within a few}} months. The weevil {{generally}} enters the cowpea pod through holes pre-harvest <b>and</b> <b>lays</b> eggs on the dry seed. The larvae burrow {{their way into the}} seed, feeding on the endosperm. The weevil develops into a sexually mature adult within the seed. An individual bruchid will lay 20–40 eggs, and in optimal conditions each egg can develop into a reproductively active adult in 3 weeks. The most common methods of protection involve the use of insecticides, the main pesticides used being carbomates, synthetic pyrethoids and organophosphates.|$|E

5|$|This bird has glossy black plumage, a long curved red bill, red legs, and a loud, ringing call. It has a buoyant {{acrobatic flight}} with widely spread primaries. The red-billed chough pairs {{for life and}} {{displays}} fidelity to its breeding site, which is usually a cave or crevice in a cliff face. It builds a wool-lined stick nest <b>and</b> <b>lays</b> three eggs. It feeds, often in flocks, on short grazed grassland, taking mainly invertebrate prey.|$|E

It builds a lined stick nest <b>and</b> <b>lays</b> three to five brown-blotched whitish eggs. It feeds, usually in flocks, on short grazed grassland, taking mainly invertebrate prey in summer and fruit in winter; it will readily approach tourist sites to find supplementary food.|$|E

5|$|Widespread across western, {{northern}} and eastern Australia, the brown honeyeater occupies {{a range of}} habitats from mangroves to eucalypt woodlands. It is seasonally nomadic within its local area, following flowering food plants. While it usually forages alone, it also feeds in small groups, or flocks of mixed honeyeater species. Nectar and insects form its diet. It occupies the same breeding territory each year, <b>and</b> <b>lays</b> two or three eggs in a cup-shaped nest woven from grass and soft bark. Both sexes contribute to nest building and feeding the young. It has a loud, clear, musical song, described as {{the best of all}} the honeyeaters.|$|E
5|$|The corn crake's {{breeding}} {{habitat is}} grassland, particularly hayfields, and it uses similar environments on the wintering grounds. This secretive species builds {{a nest of}} grass leaves in a hollow in the ground <b>and</b> <b>lays</b> 6–14 cream-coloured eggs which are covered with rufous blotches. These hatch in 19–20 days, and the black precocial chicks fledge after about five weeks. This crake is in steep decline across much of its former breeding range because modern farming practices often destroy nests before breeding is completed. The corn crake is omnivorous but mainly feeds on invertebrates, the occasional small frog or mammal, and plant material including grass seed and cereal grain. Natural threats include introduced and feral mammals, large birds, various parasites and diseases.|$|E
5|$|The golden white-eye (Cleptornis marchei) is {{a species}} of bird in the white-eye family Zosteropidae. It is the only species within the genus Cleptornis. The golden white-eye was once {{considered}} to be a honeyeater in the family Meliphagidae and although it is now known to be a white-eye, its position within that family is still uncertain. The species is restricted to the islands of Saipan and Aguijan in the Northern Mariana Islands, where it is sympatric (shares its range) and competes with the related bridled white-eye. The golden white-eye has golden plumage and a pale eye-ring. It feeds on insects, fruit, and nectar and forages in pairs or small family groups. The bird is monogamous <b>and</b> <b>lays</b> two eggs in a small cup nest.|$|E

5|$|The novel {{begins with}} Emmon, a lowland runaway, coming to Caspromant when Orrec and Gry are 16. The {{children}} tell Emmon of their gifts, {{though he is}} somewhat disbelieving of them. Orrec then narrates the history of his family from his childhood. His father Canoc is the brantor of Caspromant; his mother Melle, a woman from the lowlands. Despite living in the Uplands, Melle holds to some of her traditions, and teaches Orrec stories <b>and</b> <b>lays</b> that she had learned as a child. She also teaches him to read, an ability rare among Uplanders. Canoc also begins to instruct Orrec {{in the use of}} their power, though Orrec does not manifest any ability as a child. Orrec and Gry, of a similar age, become good friends, and Gry begins to show her power, being able to listen to the speech of cats and mice.|$|E
5|$|Then (on {{the ninth}} page) {{he arrives at}} the first species in the volume, the Greek {{tortoise}}, Testudo graeca. It is summed up in a paragraph, Cuvier noting {{that it is the}} commonest tortoise in Europe, living in Greece, Italy, Sardinia and (he writes) apparently all round the Mediterranean. He then gives its distinguishing marks, with a highly domed carapace, raised scales boldly marked with black and yellow marbling, and at the posterior edge a bulge over the tail. He gives its size—rarely reaching a foot in length; notes that it lives on leaves, fruit, insects and worms; digs a hole in which to pass the winter; mates in spring, <b>and</b> <b>lays</b> 4 or 5 eggs like those of a pigeon. The species is illustrated with two plates.|$|E
5|$|Heathrow is {{the largest}} airport in the country, {{handling}} over 67million terminal passengers in 2006, making it the third busiest airport in the world, and the busiest if measured {{by the number of}} international passengers. Nearly a third of all overseas residents visiting the UK enter the country via this airport, which also handles more than a fifth of all overseas visits by UK residents. Even though there are no dedicated freight services operating out of Heathrow, the practise of transporting cargo in the holds of passenger aircraft means that this airport still accounts {{for more than half of}} all freight handled by UK airports. Gatwick airport, with 34million terminal passengers, is the second largest in the country, eighth busiest in the world for international passenger traffic, <b>and</b> <b>lays</b> claim to the busiest single runway airport in the world. Between them the five London airports handle nearly 137million terminal passengers, 59 per cent of the national total. Stansted and East Midlands airports have both experienced large growth in freight handling over the past decade, and these two airports are the major hubs for express freight operations.|$|E
