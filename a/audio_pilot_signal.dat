Particularly, in LTE, the <b>pilot</b> <b>signal</b> occupies prespecified locations of time and frequency resources within the frame [15]. After the channel estimation, the received <b>pilot</b> <b>signals</b> are regenerated. Then, the signals of interference plus noise on ABS and non-ABS are estimated by subtracting the corresponding regenerated <b>pilot</b> <b>signals</b> from the corresponding received signals [16]. After the interference-plus-noise powers are estimated using these signals, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise power ratios (SINRs) on ABS and non-ABS are estimated. From the estimated SINRs, the transmission rates are estimated using rate estimation techniques such as the exponential effective SINR [17].|$|R

30|$|It {{is common}} {{practice}} in wireless communications to have the transmitter use asynchronous bursts of transmission to access the channel. The burst starts with a prior known <b>pilot</b> <b>signal</b> followed by modulated data symbols. The pilot {{is used by the}} receiver to estimate the channel. The receiver then uses the channel estimate to compensate for channel attenuation and phase prior to decoding. Decoding of the received data symbols is done based on the a prior known signal constellation of the transmitter. Since the wireless channel changes with time, a <b>pilot</b> <b>signal</b> has to be sent every channel coherence time. An eavesdropper can use the <b>pilot</b> <b>signal</b> to estimate the channel from the transmitter to itself and decode the information in exactly the same manner as the intended receiver. This means that sending a <b>pilot</b> <b>signal</b> from the transmitter to the receiver compromises security.|$|R

We assume a <b>pilot</b> <b>signal</b> is transmitted with data signals for channel sounding. The <b>pilot</b> <b>signal</b> does not degrade the receiver bit error rate (BER) performance because the receiver estimates the <b>pilot</b> <b>signal</b> and subtracts the estimated <b>pilot</b> <b>signal</b> from the received signal before data detection. A spreading code matched filter, a channel matched filter, and a sounding receiver are implemented by fast Fourier transform (FFT) -based matched filtering and integrated in a unified architecture. Monte Carlo simulation is {{used to evaluate the}} receiver BER performance in both a static channel and a mobile radio channel. Simulation results show that the RAKE receiver performs well in both kinds of channels. Index Terms—Fast Fourier transform (FFT) -based matched fil-tering, RAKE receivers, spread spectrum. I...|$|R

A suggestion is made that an average reduction in directivity owing to the cutting off (or “dropping out”) of some channels of the array {{be used as a}} criterion of this influence. It has been shown that an essential reduction in directivity is possible in the case of weak <b>pilot</b> <b>signal</b> or large (close to unity) reflection coefficient. If the level of direct <b>pilot</b> <b>signal</b> is higher than the cutoff threshold, the average reduction in directivity does not exceed 3 dB, although substantially greater reduction (presence of “ejections”) can be observed in certain specific cases. A reduction in directivity due to reflections can be removed by means of enhancing the sensitivity of the <b>pilot</b> <b>signal</b> channel. The method suggested in this paper can also be used in order to estimate influence of several reflections on self-phased array directivity.

40|$|Abstract—We propose two {{algorithms}} for {{real-time tracking}} {{of the location}} and dynamic motion of a mobile station in a cellular network using the <b>pilot</b> <b>signal</b> strengths from neighboring base stations. The underlying mobility model {{is based on a}} dynamic linear system driven by a discrete command process that determines the mobile station’s acceleration. The command process is modeled as a semi-Markov process over a finite set of acceleration levels. The first algorithm consists of an averaging filter for processing <b>pilot</b> <b>signal</b> strength measurements and two Kalman filters, one to estimate the discrete command process and the other to estimate the mobility state. The second algorithm employs a single Kalman filter without prefiltering and is able to track a mobile station even when a limited set of <b>pilot</b> <b>signal</b> measurements is available. Both of the proposed tracking algorithms can be used to predict future mobility behavior, which can be useful in resource allocation applications. Our numerical results show that the proposed tracking algorithms perform accurately over a wide range of mobility parameter values.
