500|$|Hamlet-like legends are {{so widely}} found (for example in Italy, Spain, Scandinavia, Byzantium, and Arabia) {{that the core}} [...] "hero-as-fool" [...] theme is {{possibly}} Indo-European in origin. Several ancient written precursors to Hamlet can be identified. The first is the anonymous Scandinavian Saga of Hrolf Kraki. In this, the murdered king has two sons—Hroar and Helgi—who {{spend most of the}} story in disguise, under false names, rather than feigning madness, in a sequence of events that differs from Shakespeare's. The second is the Roman legend of Brutus, recorded in two separate Latin works. Its hero, Lucius ("shining, light"), changes his name and persona to Brutus ("dull, stupid"), playing the role of <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> <b>to</b> avoid the fate of his father and brothers, and eventually slaying his family's killer, King Tarquinius. A 17th-century Nordic scholar, Torfaeus, compared the Icelandic hero Amlodi and the Spanish hero Prince Ambales (from the Ambales Saga) to Shakespeare's Hamlet. Similarities include the prince's feigned madness, his accidental killing of the king's counsellor in his mother's bedroom, and the eventual slaying of his uncle.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} {{also had}} a brief sexual relationship with hospital Lothario Sam Strachan. She and Sam had a one night stand in episode [...] "The Borders of Sleep", {{and went on to}} become close friends, with Maddy assisting Sam in caring for a teenage prostitute he felt responsible for. She also supported him through his Non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosis, and enlisting his support in illegally proving a patient's death through negligence. In the show's tenth series, Maddy also formed a fast respect for the new head of the hospital's Acute Assessment Unit, Linden Cullen (Duncan Pow). Pow ruled out a romance between the two characters, however, stating: [...] "They're protective of each other, but they're more like brother and sister than anything else. I don't think he's ready for the relationship merry-go-round at Holby just yet". He added that: [...] "Any man would be <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> <b>to</b> turn down Maddy, but Linden wants his wife back". Similarly, Lewington has assessed that neither Sam nor Linden are Maddy's ideal man, and instead she is [...] "waiting for a new hunk!" ...|$|E
500|$|Sinatra's {{split with}} Gardner {{in the fall}} of 1953 had a {{profound}} impact on the types of songs he sang and his voice. He began to console himself in songs with a [...] "brooding melancholy", such as [...] "I'm <b>a</b> <b>Fool</b> <b>to</b> Want You", [...] "Don't Worry 'Bout Me", [...] "My One and Only Love" [...] and There Will Never Be Another You", which Riddle believed was the direct influence of Ava Gardner. Lahr comments that the new Sinatra was [...] "not the gentle boy balladeer of the forties. Fragility had gone from his voice, to be replaced by a virile adult's sense of happiness and hurt". Author Granata considered Sinatra to have been a [...] "master of the art of recording", noting that his work in the studio [...] "set him apart from other gifted vocalists". During his career he made over 1000 recordings. Recording sessions would typically last three hours, though Sinatra would always prepare for it by spending at least an hour by the piano beforehand to vocalize, followed by a short rehearsal with the orchestra to ensure the balance of sound. During his Columbia years Sinatra would use an RCA 44 microphone, which Granata describes as [...] "the 'old-fashioned' microphone which is closely associated with Sinatra's crooner image of the 1940s", though when performing on talk shows later he would use a bullet-shaped RCA 77. At Capitol he used a Neumann U47, an [...] "ultra-sensitive" [...] microphone which better captured the timbre and tone of his voice.|$|E

500|$|... "Nothin' on You" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} most music critics. Billboards Evan J. Nabavian gave the song a 4 out of 5 starts, denoting that the song explores the swell appeal [...] "between Mars' delicately delivered melodies and B.o.B.'s Southern twang." [...] He {{compared it to}} Lupe Fiasco's duet with Matthew Santos' [...] "Superstar" [...] (2007), [...] "especially its feel-good, singalong hook". The review concluded with positive feedback for the recording's lyrics and references. The same rating was give by Nick Levine of Digital Spy. He called the track a [...] "smash" [...] and praised its piano and hook. Levine concluded that although it doesn't show the same class as [...] "Empire State of Mind" [...] (2009) by Jay Z and Alicia Keys, [...] "it's all so goddamn catchy you'd be <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> <b>to</b> give a hoot."

He said [...] "Whilst not being content to just please the ear... seems to laden with instant charisma, stopping only to refresh the parts others cannot reach of late". Tyler opined that it wouldn't surprise him if Gym Class Heroes sang the track, [...] "is sweet in it's up lifting melody, while giving the rapper {{plenty of room to}} flex his prowess." [...] Richard of DJBooth enhanced the way B.o.B. [...] "drops lovestruck bars as agile as they are flattering," [...] and the [...] "silky-smooth bridge and chorus" [...] Mars uses to seduce [...] "the woman in question". Angus Batey thought the song would have stuck out in 2010, even without B.o.B's verses, since is a clear departure from the [...] "in-the-club, eyeing-up-the-booty cliches that have come to pass for romance in hip-hop".|$|E

And the way Armin defines the two is important: the character Jack Oates is a true fool natural.

2500|$|He {{points out}} that if a wager was between the equal chance of gaining two lifetimes of {{happiness}} and gaining nothing, then a person would be <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> <b>to</b> bet on the latter. The same would go if it was three lifetimes of happiness versus nothing. He then argues that it is simply unconscionable by comparison to bet against an eternal life of happiness {{for the possibility of}} gaining nothing. The wise decision is to wager that God exists, since [...] "If you gain, you gain all; if you lose, you lose nothing", meaning one can gain eternal life if God exists, but if not, one will be no worse off in death than if one had not believed. On the other hand, if you bet against God, win or lose, you either gain nothing or lose everything. You are either unavoidably annihilated (in which case, nothing matters one way or the other) or lose the opportunity of eternal happiness. In note 194, speaking about those who live apathetically betting against God, he sums up by remarking, [...] "It is to the glory of religion to have for enemies men so unreasonable..." ...|$|E
2500|$|While Microsoft {{says that}} product {{activation}} benefits consumers by allowing Microsoft to produce higher quality software, it has nevertheless received much criticism regarding its design and implementation, effectiveness at stopping piracy and respect of privacy rights. For instance, {{during the development}} of Windows XP, beta testers strongly criticized the introduction of product activation, particularly because a change in computer hardware required re-activation. Ken Fischer at Ars Technica questioned whether activation would ultimately be effective in stopping piracy, stating that while casual computer users would be affected, he would [...] "be <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> <b>to</b> think that someone out there won't {{find a way to}} break this whole thing."

2500|$|At {{the end of}} 1939, Halder oversaw {{development}} of the invasion plans of France, the Low Countries, and the Balkans. In late 1939-early 1940, Halder was an opponent of Operation Weserübung, which he believed was doomed to failure, and made certain that the OKH {{had nothing to do}} with the planning for Weserübung, which was entirely the work of OKW and the OKM. Halder initially doubted that Germany could successfully invade France. General Erich von Manstein's bold plan for invading France through the Ardennes Forest proved successful, and ultimately led to the Fall of France. In early April 1940, Halder had a secret meeting with Carl Friedrich Goerdeler, who asked him to consider a putsch while the Phoney War (the lull in the war between the invasion of Poland and the invasion of France) was still on, hoping that the British and French were still open to a negotiated peace. Halder refused Goerdeler's request. Goerdeler told Halder that too many people had already died in the war, and his refusal to remove Hitler at this point would ensure that the blood of millions would be on his hands. Halder told Goerdeler that his oath to Hitler and his belief in Germany`s inevitable victory in the war precluded his acting against the Nazi regime. Halder told Goerdeler that [...] "The military situation of Germany, particularly on account of the pact of non-aggression with Russia is such that a breach of my oath to the Führer could not possibly be justified", that only if Germany was faced with total defeat would he consider breaking his oath, and that Goerdeler was <b>a</b> <b>fool</b> <b>to</b> believe that World War II could be ended with a compromise peace.|$|E
