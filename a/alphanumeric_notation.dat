40|$|The {{introduction}} {{provides a}} short outline of Kittlerâ€™s biographical background and briefly discusses {{the stages of}} his work: The initial discourse-analytical stage of the late 1970 s that centered primarily on literary text; the media-theoretical stage of the 1980 s and early 1990 s that focused in particular on electric and electronic media; and a current stage dedicated to rewriting the origin of one the most basic cultural technologies: the <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>notation</b> system...|$|E
50|$|Alternative {{approach}} {{is to use a}} systematic notation. It can be a standard angle notation for certain color model such as HSL/HSV mentioned above, CIELUV, or CIECAM02. <b>Alphanumeric</b> <b>notations</b> such as of Munsell color system, NCS, and Pantone Matching System are also used.|$|R
50|$|In casual settings, {{alphanumeric}} date formats {{are usually}} written with a middle-endian order (month-day-year) {{in a way}} {{similar to that of}} the United States. Another format, the little-endian order (day-month-year) is widely applied in more formal transactions and written communications especially in businesses, the government and academe, also in the military and usually the police, although the middle-endian format is still prevalent in daily use (except the armed forces). Since there is no law mandating the date order, minimum or maximum length, or format (i.e. <b>alphanumeric</b> or numeric), <b>notations</b> sometimes vary from office to office, in private and public sectors. Such can be observed in passports issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs, which particularly notate the date numerically as MM-DD-YY, and in house bills or executive orders dated alphanumerically with a MMMM-DD-YYYY format.|$|R
