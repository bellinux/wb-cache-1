40|$|The {{view that}} there should be {{increased}} emphasis on learning in workplaces because of rapid changes in business environments, and the suggestion that managers should foster the learning of employees, is prevalent in the workplace learning, organisational learning and ‘learning organisation’ literature. In New Zealand, and in other developed economies, small firms represent a very significant part of the workplace-learning context. Given the vast knowledge and skills base vested in small firms, how knowledge and skills are developed and maintained through learning processes in these firms are matters of major interest. Overall, this study seeks to answer the question: In selected small manufacturing firms, what effects, if any, do managers have on employees' learning? To help answer this question, data were collected through semi-structured interviews and mail survey questionnaires. Verbatim expressions of the interview participants were analysed using content analytic procedures. Data gathered from employees through mail survey questionnaires were analysed using a range of statistical methods. Findings of the content analysis of the verbatim expressions of the interview participants reveal that managers use a variety of strategies to foster learning at and through work in the small firms studied. <b>Analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mail</b> survey data provides a description of how employees in the sample firms perceive their workplaces as learning environments. Employees' attributions of their work-related learning to various sources and methods of learning are also described. Additionally, specific managerial actions and behaviours that have potential to increase employee satisfaction with workplace learning are identified. Findings of this study contribute to knowledge in the fields of management and human resource management in the small firm context. Synthesis of the qualitative and quantitative findings suggest a conceptual framework {{that can be used for}} analysing the effects of managers on employees' learning and help to evaluate the current state of research in the fields...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} and commercialisation {{of genetically modified}} (GM) crops for agriculture and food production is a contentious issue {{with the use of}} this technology sparking considerable public concern in a number of countries. Previous studies on the subject point out that several ‘factors’ {{play an important role in}} shaping public attitudes towards GM food, indicating that public attitudes towards food in general, and GM crops in particular, are complex. However, few studies to date have compared the level of knowledge about the technology, and attitudes towards GM crops and food derived from them held by the general population with those of farmers. While the attitudes of consumers determine the public acceptance of GM products, farmers are the primary users of gene technology in agriculture and therefore play an essential role in the adoption and dissemination of this technology worldwide. In spite of public concern about GM crops and food, the adoption of GM technology in agriculture has been extremely rapid. Comparing the attitudes of farmers with those of the general population, and investigating the differences between the two groups, can contribute to better understanding of how attitudes towards GM crops and food are formed. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the level of knowledge about gene technology and attitudes towards its use in agriculture and food production in Australia using the Queensland sugarcane industry as a case study. The present study incorporated both qualitative and quantitative methods of research. First, semi-structured interviews were conducted with a selected group of sugarcane industry stakeholders in order to investigate their views about the public’s perceptions of the use of GM crops and food in Australia. This study deemed the stakeholders’ views on this topic important to investigate, since they are likely to be involved in policy decisions about investments in future research, or regulation and potential commercialisation of GMOs in the Australian sugarcane industry. The interviewees believed it was important to differentiate the type and purpose of genetic modification when investigating public attitudes towards GM crops and food. They also reported that in their view, public opposition towards GM technology was due to a general lack of knowledge about the subject and a perceived lack of consumer benefits from implementing the technology. The findings from the interviews were used to assist the design of the mail survey questionnaires which were sent to samples of both the general population and sugarcane farmers operating in the State of Queensland, Australia. Statistical <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mail</b> survey results confirmed that many factors play a role in shaping public attitudes towards GM crops and food. Results also confirmed that these attitudes differ between members of the general population and farmers, as well as between males and females. Four main factors underlying public concern about the use of GM technology in agriculture and food production were identified from a review of the literature and the results of the mail survey interpreted through descriptive and inferential statistics. These factors were knowledge of GM science, attitudes towards food and the environment, trust in environmental organisations, and trust in research institutions. More advanced statistical analysis was undertaken through structural equation modelling techniques. The mail survey results indicated that, overall, the general population and females displayed a lower level of support for GM food when compared to sugarcane farmers and males, respectively. Analysis of the survey data indicated that this lower level of support can be partly explained by the fact that members of the general population and females showed greater preference for the natural aspects of food and placed a greater level of trust in environmental organisations than did sugarcane farmers and males, respectively. The survey results also indicated that the public had a very low level of knowledge and awareness of GM crops. However, within the general population sample, the respondents’ level of knowledge of GM science had no direct effect on their perceived risks and benefits of GM crops or on their support for GM food. The effect of public awareness of GM issues on support for GM crops and food was also not straightforward and varied according to the population under study. Within the general population, a higher level of awareness of GM issues had either no effect or a negative effect on their concerns about the use of GMOs in agriculture, their perceptions of the risks and benefits of GM crops and their support for GM food, especially amongst females. The effect of awareness of GM issues was even less evident amongst sugarcane farmers. However, when present, there was a positive effect of awareness of GM issues on the farmers’ perceptions of the risks and benefits of GM crops and their support for GM applications within male sugarcane farmers...|$|E

40|$|Background. As a society, our {{interaction}} with the environment is having {{a negative impact on}} human health. For example, an increase in car use for short trips, over walking or cycling, has contributed to an increase in obesity, diabetes and poor heart health and also contributes to pollution, which is associated with asthma and other respiratory diseases. In order to change the nature of that interaction, to be more positive and healthy, it is recommended that individuals adopt a range of environmentally friendly behaviours (such as walking for transport and reducing the use of plastics). Effective interventions aimed at increasing such behaviours will need to be evidence based and {{there is a need for}} the rapid communication of information from the point of research, into policy and practice. Further, a number of health disciplines, including psychology and public health, share a common mission to promote health and well-being. Therefore, the objective of this project is to take a cross-discipline and collaborative approach to reveal psychological mechanisms driving environmentally friendly behaviour. This objective is further divided into three broad aims, the first of which is to take a cross-discipline and collaborative approach to research. The second aim is to explore and identify the salient beliefs which most strongly predict environmentally friendly behaviour. The third aim is to build an augmented model to explain environmentally friendly behaviour. The thesis builds on the understanding that an interdisciplinary collaborative approach will facilitate the rapid transfer of knowledge to inform behaviour change interventions. Methods. The application of this approach involved two surveys which explored the psycho-social predictors of environmentally friendly behaviour. Following a qualitative pilot study, and in collaboration with an expert panel comprising academics, industry professionals and government representatives, a self-administered, Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) based, mail survey was distributed to a random sample of 3000 residents of Brisbane and Moreton Bay Region (Queensland, Australia). This survey explored specific beliefs including attitudes, norms, perceived control, intention and behaviour, as well as environmental altruism and green identity, in relation to walking for transport and switching off lights when not in use. Following <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mail</b> survey data and based on feedback from participants and key stakeholders, an internet survey was employed (N= 451) to explore two additional behaviours, switching off appliances at the wall when not in use, and shopping with reusable bags. This work is presented as a series of interrelated publications which address each of the research aims. Presentation of Findings. Chapter five of this thesis consists of a published paper which addresses the first aim of the research and outlines the collaborative and multidisciplinary approach employed in the mail survey. The paper argued that forging alliances with those who are in a position to immediately utilise the findings of research has the potential to improve the quality and timely communication of research. Illustrating this timely communication, Chapter six comprises a report presented to Moreton Bay Regional Council (MBRC). This report addresses aim's one and two. The report contains a summary of participation in a range of environmentally friendly behaviours and identifies the beliefs which most strongly predicted walking for transport and switching off lights (from the mail survey). These salient beliefs were then recommended as targets for interventions and included: participants believing that they might save money; that their neighbours also switch off lights; that it would be inconvenient to walk for transport and that their closest friend also walks for transport. Chapter seven also addresses the second aim and presents a published conference paper in which the salient beliefs predicting the four specified behaviours (from both surveys) are identified and potential applications for intervention are discussed. Again, a range of TPB based beliefs, including descriptive normative beliefs, were predictive of environmentally friendly behaviour. This paper was also provided to MBRC, along with recommendations for applying the findings. For example, as descriptive normative beliefs were consistently correlated with environmentally friendly behaviour, local councils could engage in marketing and interventions (workshops, letter box drops, internet promotions) which encourage parents and friends to model, rather than simply encourage, environmentally friendly behaviour. The final two papers, presented in Chapters eight and nine, addresses the third aim of the project. These papers each present two behaviours together to inform a TPB based theoretical model with which to predict environmentally friendly behaviour. A generalised model is presented, which is found to predict the four specific behaviours under investigation. The role of demographics was explored across each of the behaviour specific models. It was found that some behaviour's differ by age, gender, income or education. In particular, adjusted models predicted more of the variance in walking for transport amongst younger participants and females. Adjusted models predicted more variance in switching off lights amongst those with a bachelor degree or higher and predicted more variance in switching off appliances amongst those on a higher income. Adjusted models predicted more variance in shopping with reusable bags for males, people 40 years or older, those on a higher income and those with a bachelor degree or higher. However, model structure and general predictability was relatively consistent overall. The models provide a general theoretical framework from which to better understand the motives and predictors of environmentally friendly behaviour. Conclusion. This research has provided an example of the benefits of a collaborative interdisciplinary approach. It has identified a number of salient beliefs which can be targeted for social marketing campaigns and educational initiatives; and these findings, along with recommendations, have been passed on to a local council to be used as part of their ongoing community engagement programs. Finally, the research has informed a practical model, as well as behaviour specific models, for predicting sustainable living behaviours. Such models can highlight important core constructs from which targeted interventions can be designed. Therefore, this research represents an important step in undertaking collaborative approaches to improving population health through human-environment interactions...|$|E

To date however, there are no studies examining <b>the</b> media’s portrayals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Governor General despite the fact that as Canada’s vice-regents, they are increasingly appointed to represent a more diverse Canadian population. To assess this role, this paper conducts a content and discourse <b>analysis,</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Globe and <b>Mail’s</b> coverage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past five Governors General, Jeanne Sauvé, Ramon Hnatyshyn, Romeo LeBlanc, Adrienne Clarkson and Michaëlle Jean.

40|$|Although {{much effort}} has been {{expended}} on studying many sites of social memory, {{little attention has been}} directed at <b>the</b> media’s work <b>of</b> memory, especially in post-colonial Africa. <b>The</b> media’s work <b>of</b> memory is important because of its social standing as a communicative and cultural institution, and because social memory is imbricated in processes of both collective identity formation and nation-building which partly shape patterns of economic distribution, recognition, and representation in society. It is in this context that this study shows how Zimbabwe’s <b>The</b> Sunday <b>Mail</b> and <b>The</b> Standard newspapers used social memory to construct the country’s national identity between 1999 and 2013 in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> a socio-economic and political crisis for the country’s poly-racial, and poly-ethno-linguistic communities. The study also explores how these newspapers worked as memory sites through their construction of Zimbabwe’s national identity during the period under study. It achieves these tasks by analysing how these newspapers reported on such issues as Zimbabwe’s colonial history, <b>the</b> country’s narrative <b>of</b> decolonisation, <b>the</b> Gukurahundi narrative, the land reform process, elections and independence celebrations. The study takes a critical realist approach to qualitative research, and uses Fairclough and Fairclough’s (2012) method <b>of</b> political discourse <b>analysis</b> as well as Aristotle’s approach to rhetoric for a close reading <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sampled newspaper articles. It is informed by Nancy Fraser’s Theory of Justice, Chantal Mouffe’s Model of Agonistic Pluralism, and Jurgen Habermas’s Discourse Ethics Theory. The study concludes that these two newspapers actively use social memory to construct versions of national identity for specific socio-political and economic ends. Editorials and opinions from <b>The</b> Sunday <b>Mail,</b> which construct Zimbabwean-ness in nativist terms represent <b>the</b> hegemonic appropriation <b>of</b> social memory to construct a sense of Zimbabwean nationhood. In contrast, The Standard uses social memory to construct Zimbabwean-ness in modernist terms with citizenship as the core organising principle <b>of</b> belonging. <b>The</b> political discourse <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Sunday <b>Mail’s</b> and <b>The</b> Standard’s evocation <b>of</b> social memory shows that the two newspapers reflect the tension between indigenist and universalist imaginaries of belonging in Zimbabwe.

Major: Education, Work/Community/Family Education [...] Advisor: Shari Peterson, PhD. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xii, 228 pages, appendices A-FThis qualitative {{study was designed}} to develop a grounded theory that would provide an understanding of what certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs) and their colleagues value and expect from the nurse anesthesia profession's recertification process. The grounded theory was based on <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> data obtained from a total of 27 CRNAs during four face-to-face focus group sessions. <b>Analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> data from <b>mailed</b> surveys completed by 21 CRNA associates also contributed to the grounded theory. Rank order scaling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> survey activities identified three recertification activities CRNA associates felt would provide assurance of CRNA competency: (1) Hands-on simulation testing, (2) continuing medical education (e. g., interactive workshops), and (3) written exams. Focus group participants indicated that hands-on simulation experience and testing provided <b>the</b> most assurance <b>of</b> CRNA competency. <b>Analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> focus group and survey data resulted in themes, which established that a recertification process fostering a commitment to professional lifelong learning and providing an assurance of CRNA competency was needed.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis {{is based on the}} assumption that modern computer technologies are already potentially pervasive: CPUs are embedded in any sort of device; RAM and storage memory of a modern PDA is comparable to those of a ten years ago Unix workstation; Wi-Fi, GPRS, UMTS are leveraging <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wireless Internet. Nevertheless, computing is not pervasive because we do not have a clear conceptual model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pervasive computer and we have not tools, methodologies, and middleware to write and to seamlessly deliver at once services over a multitude of heterogeneous devices and different delivery contexts. Our thesis addresses these issues starting from <b>the</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> forces in a pervasive computing environment: user mobility, user profile, user position, and device profile. The conceptual model, or metaphor, we use to drive our work is to consider the environment as surrounded by a multitude of services and objects and devices as the communicating gates between the real world and <b>the</b> virtual dimension <b>of</b> pervasive computing around us. Our thesis is thus built upon three main “pillars”. The first pillar is a domain-object-driven methodology which allows developer to abstract from low level details <b>of</b> <b>the</b> final delivery platform, and provides the user with the ability to access services in a multi-channel way. The rationale is that domain objects are self-contained pieces of software able to represent data and to compute functions and procedures. Our approach fills the gap between users and domain objects building an appropriate user interface which is both adapted to the domain object and to the end user device. As example, we present how to design, implement and deliver an electronic mail application over various platforms. <b>The</b> second pillar <b>of</b> this thesis analyzes in more details the forces that make direct object manipulation inadequate in a pervasive context. These forces are the user profile, the device profile, <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> use, and <b>the</b> combinatorial explosion <b>of</b> domain objects. From <b>the</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electronic <b>mail</b> application presented as example, we notice that according to the end user device, or according to particular circumstances during the access to the service (for instance if the user access the service by the interactive TV while he is having his breakfast) some functionalities are not compulsory and do not fit an adequate task sequence. So we decided to make task models explicit in <b>the</b> design <b>of</b> a service and to integrate the capability to automatically generate user interfaces for domain objects with <b>the</b> formal definition <b>of</b> task models adapted to the final delivery context.

40|$|International audienceThis {{submission}} {{builds on}} previous {{work by the}} author, conducted through a participant observation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UN World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) process (2002 - 2005). A typology of involved civil society actors, of their respective positions taken during the WSIS discussions, and of tensions between them, allowed to analyze <b>the</b> evolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> WSIS participants configuration. This analysis has revealed a process of delegitimation of organized social actors, starting from WSIS 2 nd phase. This follow-up work has been conducted through <b>the</b> empirical <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> exchanges on <b>the</b> <b>mailing</b> list <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Civil Society Internet Governance Caucus since <b>the</b> setting up <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UN Internet Governance Forum (IGF) in 2006. Additional data have been gathered from the discussions among some thematic IGF Dynamic Coalitions, as well as during the IGF open consultation processes, and the IGF meetings themselves. We show that <b>the</b> establishment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> IGF, its advisory committees and its rules of procedure have reinforced the participation, in their individual capacity, of various kind of “experts” (academics, consultants, [...] .). Instead of NGOs, trade-unions and social movements, it is <b>the</b> figure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> “policy entrepreneur” that has thus found its “window of opportunity”, {{in a context of}} a weakened role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> State. There is a need to better understand these transformations of civil society presenting itself as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> “stakeholders” <b>of</b> <b>the</b> triad formed together with government and the private sector. Our thesis is that it should be analyzed through <b>the</b> prism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individualistic and liberal vision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> civil society, as theorized by the Scottish Enlightenment philosophers (most notably Ferguson and Smith) and then by Hegel. The Gramscian perspective - at least in its dimension identifying “civil society” as an organized sphere, independent from the market and the State spheres, and autonomous with respect to them – might indeed not fit anymore such evolution. Furthermore, we show that these transformations deeply impact the definition and understanding of human rights, and of how they could translate in the information society context. “Communication Rights” were at <b>the</b> heart <b>of</b> heated debates during the WSIS first phase (2002 - 2003), most notably due to <b>the</b> involvement <b>of</b> organized civil society actors with strong and diverging viewpoints on how they should be defined (CRIS Campaign members, Civil Society Human Rights Caucus members, Media Caucus members). Research findings on the WSIS second phase (2003 - 2005), and even more since <b>the</b> establishment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> IGF, show a regression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concerns related to socio-economic and development (or collective) rights, while the consensus may only be reached on some civil and political rights, namely freedom of expression and privacy, i. e. individual rights. In conclusion, we relate these two sets <b>of</b> findings (on <b>the</b> one hand a more individualistic form of civil society participation; on the other hand the emphasis put on individual rights) to <b>the</b> crisis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nation State, at least in its understanding of a welfare State, in a globalization context...|$|R
