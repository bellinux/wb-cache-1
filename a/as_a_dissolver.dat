40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of our study}} was to establish a standardized procedure for postmortem whole-body CT-based angiography with lipophilic and hydrophilic contrast media solutions and to compare {{the results of these}} two methods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Minimally invasive postmortem CT angiography was performed on 10 human cadavers via access to the femoral blood vessels. Separate perfusion of the arterial and venous systems was established with a modified heart-lung machine using a mixture of an oily contrast medium and paraffin (five cases) and a mixture of a water-soluble contrast medium with polyethylene glycol (PEG) 200 in the other five cases. Imaging was executed with an MDCT scanner. RESULTS: The minimally invasive femoral approach to the vascular system provided a good depiction of lesions of the complete vascular system down {{to the level of the}} small supplying vessels. Because of the enhancement of well-vascularized tissues, angiography with the PEG-mixed contrast medium allowed the detection of tissue lesions and the depiction of vascular abnormalities such as pulmonary embolisms or ruptures of the vessel wall. CONCLUSION: The angiographic method with a water-soluble contrast medium and PEG <b>as</b> <b>a</b> contrast-agent <b>dissolver</b> showed <b>a</b> clearly superior quality due to the lack of extravasation through the gastrointestinal vascular bed and the enhancement of soft tissues (cerebral cortex, myocardium, and parenchymal abdominal organs).

The results indicate that once the diffusion layer existing between the uranium core and the Zircaloy cladrung is exposed to such solutions, it will readily and completely dissolve, thus eliminating the possibility of {{this portion of the}} diffusion layer entering into an explosive reaction with nitric acid. Because of the probability that the Zircaloy cladding (and, therefore, the diffusion layer) will not be completely removed from the uranium prior to the nitric acid core dissolution step, consideration was also given to the magnitude of a possible explosive reaction resulting from the exposure of the diffusion layer to nitric acid.

Currently, <b>a</b> <b>dissolver</b> monitoring system applied by the IAEA utilizes semi-quantitative neutron assay of hull batches to detect changes in the neutron count rate that could indicate excess Pu in the leached hulls. The goal of the exercise reported in this paper is to provide <b>an</b> alternative <b>dissolver</b> process monitoring concept. The approach is to infer the completeness of spent fuel dissolution from easily- monitored process parameters. To provide a framework, a scenario was developed and evaluated where fuel and its contained Pu is purposely left undissolved, resulting in excess Pu in the hulls. The magnitude of the scenario was calculated based on the loss of 8 kg of Pu over the course of 90 working days. Based on the chemical models and material balance calculations presented here, relatively large changes in temperature, acid concentration or reaction time are needed for the stated material loss. Further, these process changes would be easily observable using current process monitoring technologies, but further work is needed to evaluate authentication strategies and performance under plant and long term conditions. Total uncertainties will depend upon the errors associated with model calculations and measurement errors. Estimation of these uncertainties is the next logical step for understanding the value of process monitoring in this scenario...|$|R

The photocurrents are restricted to the eyespot region of somatic cells. Photocurrents are detectable from intact cells and excised eyes. The rhodopsin action spectrum suggests that the currents are induced by Volvox rhodopsin. Flash-induced photocurrents are a composition of a fast Ca 2 +-carried current (PF) and a slower current (PS), which is carried by H+. PF is a high-intensity response that appears with a delay of less than 50 micros after flash. The stimulus-response curve of its initial rise is fit by a single exponential and parallels the rhodopsin bleaching. These two observations suggest that the responsible channel is closely connected to the rhodopsin, both forming a tight complex. At low flash energies PS is dominating. The current delay increases up to 10 ms, and the PS amplitude saturates when only a few percent of the rhodopsin is bleached.

40|$|The {{rheological}} properties of a suspension can be dramatically altered {{by adding a}} small amount of a secondary fluid that is immiscible with the bulk liquid. These capillary suspensions exist either in the pendular state where the secondary fluid preferentially wets the particles or the capillary state where the bulk fluid is preferentially wetting. The yield stress, as well as storage and loss moduli, depends on the size and distribution of secondary phase droplets created during sample preparation. Enhanced droplet breakup leads to stronger sample structures. In capillary state systems, this can be achieved by increasing the mixing speed and time of turbulent mixing using <b>a</b> <b>dissolver</b> stirrer. In the pendular state, increased mixing speed also leads to better droplet breakup, but spherical agglomeration is favored at longer times decreasing the yield stress. Additional mixing with a ball mill is shown to be beneficial to sample strength. The influence of viscosity variance between the bulk and second fluid on the droplet breakup is excluded by performing experiments with viscosity matched fluids.

The {{purpose of this study}} is to enhance our understanding of the phenomena governing the oxide behavior during dissolution, and to acquire new experimental data suitable for modeling and optimizing spent fuel dissolution. The approach adopted involved small scale experiments, which are indispensable for observing, understanding and modeling the phenomena occurring at the solid/liquid interface which control the dissolution reaction. A millifluidic reactor of about 1 mL was developed for the continuous dissolution of millimeter or submillimeter solid particles in a nitric acid stream. New experimental and analytical monitoring techniques were used (observation at the interface by confocal microscopy and epifluorescence, tracking of the species involved, pH monitoring at the interface by fluorometry). Qualification and experimental implementation of these techniques were first conducted on a nonradioactive surrogate, copper. These observations were used to better understand and quantify continuously and in situ the material dissolution mechanisms and the pH variation at the interface, as well as providing data on the behavior of the off-gases.

The focus was {{on the use of}} advanced materials with high performance in high concentrations (greater than 8 N) and high temperatures of nitric acid employed in the dissolver. The commercially available materials like SS 316 l, titanium, Ti – 5 % Ta, and Ti – 5 % Ta – 1. 8 % Nb were tried and the corrosion behavior of these materials was studied in detail. It was also decided to try out Zircaloy – 4 as the material of construction due to its excellent corrosion resistance in nitric acid environment. The specifications were stringent and the geometrical configurations of the assembly were very intricate. On accepting the challenge of fabricating the dissolver, NFC made different fixtures for electron beam (EB) welding and TIG welding. Trials were carried out for optimization of various operating parameter for EB welding & TIG welding process es, which were qualified by radiography, liquid dye penetrant testing, and metallographic, mechanical and chemical analys es. Finally the dissolver was subjected to helium leak test. The tests conducted at IGCAR with Zircaloy dissolver assembly revealed that Zircaloy- 4 exhibited the superior corrosion resistance over all other materials tried out so far for this purpose. The results clearly indicates that Zircaloy – 4 is a near-zero corrosion material in comparison to the other materials.

40|$|Scale deposits, such as more {{conventional}} sulphate and carbonate scales, impair {{oil and gas}} production and lead to problems such as production loss, equipment failure and additional expenditure. However, more recently the occurrence of sulphide scales (e. g. FeS, ZnS and PbS) is increasingly being reported. The mechanisms of formation and inhibition of sulphide scales in oilfield systems are not yet fully understood. This thesis presents a modelling, methodological and mechanistic study of sulphide scale (FeS, ZnS, PbS) formation and inhibition. A number of specific aspects relating to sulphide scaling are studied in this thesis, as follows: (i) Sulphide scale formation and the related mechanisms of inhibition by chemical scale inhibitors; (ii) the effects of commercial scale inhibitors (e. g. PPCA, DETPMP and other blends) on sulphide and mixed scale formation; (iii) the effect of THPS <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sulphide scale <b>dissolver</b> and the additional effect of brine composition (Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +) on its performance; (iv) the effect of scale inhibitors on the morphology of both BaSO 4 and CaCO 3 when co-precipitated with sulphide scales; (v) the effect of scale inhibitors on mixed sulphide scaling (e. g. ZnS/PbS etc.); (vi) a sulphide prediction model was also developed which gives a description of the sulphide precipitation interactions and this was tested against experiment. These various experimental studies were carried out using an integrated combination of techniques such <b>as</b> <b>a</b> modified static bottle tests (performed in an anaerobic apparatus for some cases to avoid Fe 2 + oxidation), dynamic static tests, particle size analysis, inductively coupled plasma (ICP), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). These studies have enabled us to develop some new insights into the mechanisms of sulphide scale formation and inhibition in this work. For example, some of the specific contributions to the understanding of sulphide scale formation an d inhibition mechanisms, from this work are listed <b>as</b> follows: • <b>A</b> number of predictions were made using a detailed sulphide model of experimental quantities such as final solution pH, saturation ratios (SR), mass of FeS etc. These predictions were compared directly with the experimentally measured quantities and excellent agreement has been found. • A number of novel types of FeS inhibition behaviour have been observed and describes when treated with scale inhibitors e. g. some FeS solutions are found to become clear from black 24 hrs after the scale inhibitor treatment. • There is significant barite crystal distortion when co-precipitated with FeS, but no distortion is observed when barium sulphate co-precipitates with PbS and ZnS. • Mg 2 + has a profound effect on the ability of THPS to inhibit FeS and this work demonstrates that THPS is significantly enhanced by the presence of Mg 2 + which has more effect than any other ions. • CaCO 3 crystals deposit in bulk solution, rather than on the metal surface when coprecipitated with ZnS. The polymorphs of CaCO 3 form on the metal surface when coprecipitated with PbS. • Mixed PbS and ZnS sulphide scale is found to be easier to inhibit than either scale individually...|$|R

A observação das consultas médicas faz parte de uma abordagem metodológica mais abrangente de acompanhar mães nas suas consultas com assistentes sociais e oficiais da imigração e de realizar entrevistas semi-estruturadas com as mulheres sobre as suas experiências de maternidade. A etnografia revela não só as limitações de uma política de um universalismo cego que nega as diferenças em nome do humanismo e dos direitos universais como revela a necessidade de se fazer uma distinção {{conceptual}} entre "literacia no domínio da saúde" (LDS) e "literacia dos sistemas de saúde" (LSS). Ao demonstrar como a biomedicina não pode ser separada do contexto cultural no qual é praticada, o artigo argumenta que o objectivo de promover a LSS de imigrantes, conhecedores de outras abordagens e sistemas de saúde, devia ser considerado como uma estratégia mais ampla de promoção de competência intercultural que visa ajudar tanto os médicos como os pacientes. Evitar utilizar o termo LDS que implicitamente rotula imigrantes como "analfabetos", é uma forma de valorizar as suas culturas, práticas e interesses alternativas em matéria de saúde e de ajudar <b>a</b> <b>dissolver</b> <b>a</b> hierarquia dos saberes entre médicos e pacientes imigrantes. Through detailed ethnographic {{descriptions of}} Cape Verdean student migrant mothers' {{encounters with the}} Portuguese health system, based on two years of fieldwork, {{the aim of the}} paper is to elucidate the power relations inherent in institutionalised medical encounters through which cultural differences are ignored, misconstrued and criticised in order to provide a critical reflection upon the principle of equal, universal treatment for all. The observation of medical encounters constitutes part of a broader methodological approach of accompanying the mothers to appointments with doctors, social workers and immigration officials, as well as conducting semi-structured interviews with the women upon their experiences of motherhood. The ethnography not only highlights the shortcomings of a policy of blind universalism which denies difference in the name of humanism and human rights but also reveals the need to make a conceptual distinction between "health literacy" and "health systems literacy". By demonstrating how biomedical knowledge cannot be separated from the cultural context within which it is practised, the paper argues that promoting the systems literacy of immigrants who are literate in alternative health approaches and systems should be regarded <b>as</b> part of <b>a</b> wider strategy to increase the intercultural competency of doctors and patients alike.

40|$|An {{alternative}} to the FB-Line scrap recovery dissolver was desired for the dissolution of sand, slag, and crucible (SS{ampersand}C) residues from the plutonium reduction process due to the potential generation of hydrogen gas concentrations above the lower flammability limit. To address this concern, a flowsheet was developed for the F-Canyon dissolvers. The dissolvers are continually purged with nominally 33 SCFM of air; therefore the generation of flammable gas concentrations {{should not be a}} concern. Following removal of crucible fragments, small batches of the remaining sand fines or slag chunks containing less than approximately 350 grams of plutonium can be dissolved using the center insert {{in each of the four}} annular dissolver ports to address nuclear criticality safety concerns. Complete dissolution of the sand fines and slag chunks was achieved in laboratory experiments by heating between 75 and 85 degrees Celsius in a 9. 3 M nitric acid/ 0. 013 M (hydrogen) fluoride solution. Under these conditions, the sand and slag samples dissolved between 1 and 3 hours. Complete dissolution of plutonium and calcium fluorides in the slag required adjusting the dissolver solution to 7. 5 wt% aluminum nitrate nonahydrate (ANN). Once ANN was added to <b>a</b> <b>dissolver</b> solution, further dissolution of any plutonium oxide (PuO 2) in successive charges was not practical due to complexation of the fluoride by aluminum. During the laboratory experiments, well mixed solutions were necessary to achieve rapid dissolution rates. When agitation was not provided, sand fines dissolved very slowly. Measurement of the hydrogen gas generation rate during dissolution of slag samples was used to estimate the amount of metal in the chunks. Depending upon the yield of the reduction, the values ranged between approximately 1 (good yield) and 20 % (poor yield). Aging of the slag will reduce the potential for hydrogen generation as calcium metal oxidizes over time. The potential for excessive corrosion in the dissolvers was evaluated using experimental data reported in the literature. Corrosion data at the exact flowsheet conditions were not available; however, the corrosion rate for 304 L stainless steel (wrought material) corrosion coupons in 10 M nitric acid/ 0. 01 M hydrofluoric acid at 95 degrees Celsius was reported as 21 mils per year. If the fluoride in the dissolver is complexed with aluminum, the corrosion rate will decrease to approximately 5 mils per year...|$|R

In the bead mode almost the thickness of the layers was independent of the conditions of extrusion, but seemed to depend on the wetting and rheological properties of the casting bodies. The workability of the pseudoplastic bodies was limited by the pressure characteristic of the extruder and by the homogenization process. Due to the expensive facilities relating to the doctor-blade-process the application of slip extrusion for making thin ceramic tapes should be restricted to the moduling of complicated bodies or of multilayer tapes by a simultaneous wet-in-wet-deposition of the extruded single layers.

Thorex reagent (13 M HN 0 _ 3; 0, 1 M AI(N 0 _ 3) _ 3; 0, 05 M HF) was metered by a pump through a central pipe ending just above {{the bottom of the}} dissolver and flowed upwards through the particle bed. Tests have demonstrated that the amount of particles in the <b>dissolver</b> at <b>a</b> steady state operation depends linearly an the specific dissolution rate and throughput of the particles. Scale-up experiments have shown {{that it is possible to}} obtain a throughput of 90 kg of particles / 24 hours with <b>a</b> critically safe <b>dissolver...</b>|$|R
40|$|Calcine {{dissolution}} {{studies were}} performed in FY- 94, 95 {{in order to}} extend the knowledge of dissolution and to obtain information necessary for scale-up design and operation. Experiments reported in this document were performed with non-radioactive and actual calcines to generate qualitative data regarding: (a) calcine dissolution rates, (b) undissolved solids settling characteristics, (c) undissolved solids heel formation, and (d) chemical treatments for undissolved solids heel dissolution. The goal of this work was to achieve complete calcine dissolution, or to determine conditions {{that would result in}} the maximum calcine dissolution. Small scale laboratory experiments (test-tube dissolutions) and <b>a</b> bench scale <b>dissolver</b> set-up were used in the effort. Results from this work show the bulk of the undissolved solids to settle at a rate of > 9 inches per second when the baseline dissolution parameters are used. Baseline dissolution parameters were 100 grams of calcine being dissolved in 1 L of 5 M HNO{sub 3 } at > 90 C while the solution is being vigorously and constantly mixed. This work also verified that dissolution is most complete when performed with aggressive mixing. Sequential dissolutions performed with non-radioactive and actual calcine indicate that little undissolved solids heel build-up is expected, and this small heel can be further dissolved by increasing the dissolution time or by adding fresh nitric acid...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear purity {{uranyl nitrate}} {{solutions}} were produced from Rum Jungle yellow cake by dissolution in nitric acid and purification by solvent extraction with 20 vol. % tributyl phosphate in kerosene using pump -mix mixer-settler contactors. The {{design of the}} equipment, experimental studies and operating experience are described. Dissolution of yellow cake and recycled uranium oxide materials was readily carried out in <b>a</b> 100 ℓ <b>dissolver</b> to give solutions containing 300 gU ℓ - 1 and 0. 5 to 4 П nitric acid. Filtration of silica from this solution prior to solvent extraction was not necessary in this work for yellow cake containing 0. 25 per cent silica. A low acid flowsheet for uranium purification was developed in which the nitric acid consumption was reduced by 76 per cent and the throughput of the mixer-settler units was increased by 67 per cent compared with the initial design flowsheet. Nine extraction and seven scrubbing stages were used with a feed solution containing 300 gU ℓ - 1 and 1. 0 П nitric acid and with {{a portion of the}} product recycled as scrub solution. The loaded organic phase was stripped in 16 stages with 0. 05 П nitric acid heated to 60 º C to give a 120 gU ℓ - 1 product.

40|$|Streptokinase (SK) is <b>a</b> potent clot <b>dissolver</b> but lacks {{fibrin clot}} {{specificity}} as it activates human plasminogen (HPG) into human plasmin (HPN) throughout the system leading to {{increased risk of}} bleeding. Another major drawback associated with all thrombolytics, including tissue plasminogen activator, is the generation of transient thrombin and release of clot-bound thrombin that promotes reformation of clots. In order to obtain anti-thrombotic as well as clot-specificity properties in SK, cDNAs encoding the EGF 4, 5, 6 domains of human thrombomodulin were fused with that of streptokinase, either at its N- or C-termini, and expressed these in Pichia pastoris followed by purification and structural-functional characterization, including plasminogen activation, thrombin inhibition, and Protein C activation characteristics. Interestingly, the N-terminal EGF fusion construct (EGF-SK) showed plasmin-mediated plasminogen activation, whereas the C-terminal (SK-EGF) fusion construct exhibited 'spontaneous' plasminogen activation which is quite similar to SK i. e. direct activation of systemic HPG in absence of free HPN. Since HPN is normally absent in free circulation due to rapid serpin-based inactivation (such as alpha- 2 -antiplasmin and alpha- 2 -Macroglobin), but selectively present in clots, a plasmin-dependent mode of HPG activation is expected {{to lead to a}} desirable fibrin clot-specific response by the thrombolytic. Both the N- and C-terminal fusion constructs showed strong thrombin inhibition and Protein C activation properties as well, and significantly prevented re-occlusion in a specially designed assay. The EGF-SK construct exhibited fibrin clot dissolution properties with much-lowered levels of fibrinogenolysis, suggesting unmistakable promise in clot dissolver therapy with reduced hemorrhage and re-occlusion risks...|$|R

O lugar conferido à analista pela transferência permitiu-lhe ser testemunha de um doloroso processo de derrocada subjetiva que, no entanto, sempre coexistiu com uma tentativa de cura e reconstrução que tinha algo de heróico. Ao perceber o progressivo abandono por parte da instituição, o paciente passou a construir uma seqüência de monstros em contraponto às suas vivências no {{hospital}} psiquiátrico. Os demônios têm uma vertente simbólica, são nomes para o gozo. Possibilitam também uma reconstrução do imaginário, na medida em que efetuam alguma separação entre o eu e o outro. A construção dos demônios constitui um trabalho com o real, um esforço para barrar o gozo do Outro que ameaça <b>dissolver</b> <b>a</b> estrutura do sujeito. Assim, ao menos durante certo período, foi possível estabelecer e manter alguma distância entre o campo do sujeito e o campo do Outro, efetuando-se uma recomposição, embora fugaz, do nó pelo qual o sujeito se sustentava na existência. This paper {{reports on}} the analysis of a psychotic subject. Transference enabled the analyst to witness a painful subjective debacle process which, however, ran in parallel with a heroic attempt at cure and reconstruction. As the subject perceived that the institution was letting him down, {{a whole series of}} monsters began to be constructed as related to his psychiatric hospital experience. The demons have a symbolic dimension and are in fact ways of naming jouissance. They also permit a reconstruction of the imaginary, inasmuch <b>as</b> they effect <b>a</b> separation of the subject from the other. Demon construction constitutes a way of working with the real, an effort to deter the Other's jouissance which threatens to break up the subject's structure.

40|$|H-Canyon has <b>a</b> ''gap'' in <b>dissolver</b> {{operations}} {{during the}} last three months of FY 03. One group of material to be processed during the gap is pre-existing scrub alloy material. There are 14 cans of material containing approximately 3. 8 kilograms of plutonium. Of the 14 cans, it was anticipated that four cans contain salts, two cans contain anode heel materials, and eight cans contain scrub alloy buttons. H-Canyon desires to process the materials using a flowsheet similar to the SS and C (sand, slag and crucible) dissolution flowsheet used in F-Canyon. The materials will be loaded into carbon steel cans and then placed into aluminum metal charging bundles. Samples were sent to Savannah River Technology Center (SRTC) for characterization and flowsheet testing [...] four MSE salts, two anode heels, and seven scrub alloy buttons. SRTC dissolved and characterized each of the samples. Two of them, originally thought to be MSE salts, were found to be graphite mold materials and were unsuitable for processing in H-Canyon. Characterization studies confirmed that the identification of the remaining items as MSE salts, scrub alloy buttons, and anode heel materials was correct. The MSE salts and anode heels solids are comprised primarily of plutonium, potassium, sodium and chloride. Both the MSE salts and anode heels left behind small amounts of residual solids. The scrub alloy buttons are comprised primarily of plutonium and aluminum. The solids dissolve readily with light, effervescent gas generation at the material surface and only trace amounts of NOx generation. Of the seven button samples, four dissolved completely. Two button samples contained small amounts of tantalum that did not dissolve. The last of the seven scrub alloy samples left a trace amount of residual plutonium solids. It is anticipated that the presence of undissolved fissile material is a function of where the sample was located relative to the button surface...|$|R
40|$|Unirradiated Mark 42 fuel {{tubes are}} to be {{dissolved}} in an upcoming campaign in F-canyon. Savannah River Technology Center (SRTC) /Chemical & Hydrogen Technology Section (CHTS) identified a flow sheet for the dissolution of these Mark 42 fuel tubes which required <b>a</b> more aggressive <b>dissolver</b> solution than previously required for irradiated Mark 42 fuel tubes. Subsequently, SRTC/MTS was requested to develop and perform a corrosion testing program {{to assess the impact}} of new flow sheets on corrosion of the dissolver wall. The two primary variables evaluated were the fluoride and aluminum concentrations of the dissolver solution. Fluoride was added as Calcium Fluoride (CaF{sub 2 }) while the aluminum was added either as metallic aluminum, which was subsequently dissolved, or as the chemical aluminum nitrate (Al(NO{sub 3 }) {sub 3 }). The dissolved aluminum metal was used to simulate the dissolution of the aluminum from the Mark 42 cladding and fuel matrix. Solution composition for the corrosion tests bracketed the flow sheet for the Mark 42. Corrosion rates of AISI Type 304 stainless steel coupons, both welded and non-welded coupons, were calculated from measured weight losses and post-test concentrations of soluble Fe, Cr and Ni. The corrosion rates, which ranged between 2. 7 and 32. 5 mpy, were calculated from both the one day and the one week weight losses. These corrosion rates indicated a relatively mild corrosion on the dissolver vessel. The welded coupons consistently had a higher corrosion rate than the non-welded coupons. The difference between the two decreased as the solution aggressiveness decreased. In these test solutions, aggressiveness corresponded with the fluoride concentration. Based on the results of this study, any corrosion occurring during the Mark 42 Campaign is not expected to have a deleterious effect on the dissolver vessel...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear fission {{results in}} the {{production}} of fission products (FPs) and activation products that increasingly interfere with the fission process as their concentrations increase. Some of these fission and activation products tend to evolve in gaseous species during used nuclear fuel reprocessing. Analyses have shown that I 129, due to its radioactivity, high potential mobility in the environment, and high longevity (half life of 15. 7 million years), can require control efficiencies of up to 1, 000 x or higher to meet regulatory emission limits. Deep-bed iodine sorption testing has been done to evaluate the performance of solid sorbents for capturing iodine in off-gas streams from nuclear fuel reprocessing plants. The objectives of the FY 2011 deep bed iodine sorbent testing are: (1) Evaluate sorbents for iodine capture under various conditions of gas compositions and operating temperature (determine sorption efficiencies, capacities, and mass transfer zone depths); and (2) Generate data for dynamic iodine sorption modeling. Three tests performed this fiscal year on silver zeolite light phase (AgZ-LP) sorbent are reported here. Additional tests are still in progress and can be reported in a revision of this report or a future report. Testing was somewhat delayed and limited this year due to initial activities to address some questions of prior testing, and due to a period of maintenance for the on-line GC. Each test consisted of (a) flowing a synthetic blend of gases designed to be similar to <b>an</b> aqueous <b>dissolver</b> off-gas stream over the sorbent contained in three separate bed segments in series, (b) measuring each bed inlet and outlet gas concentrations of iodine and methyl iodide (the two surrogates of iodine gas species considered most representative of iodine species expected in dissolver off-gas), (c) operating for a long enough time to achieve breakthrough of the iodine species from at least one (preferably the first two) bed segments, and (d) post-test purging with pure N 2 to drive loosely or physisorbed iodine species off of the sorbent. Post-test calculations determine the control efficiencies for each bed, iodine loadings on the sorbent, and mass transfer zone depths. Portions of the iodine-laden sorbent from the first bed of two of the tests have been shipped to SNL for waste form studies. Over the past three years, we have explored a full range of inlet iodine and methyl iodide concentrations ranging from {approx} 100 ppb to {approx} 100 ppm levels, and shown adequate control efficiencies within <b>a</b> bed depth <b>as</b> shallow as 2 inches for lower concentrations and 4 inches for higher concentrations, for the AgZ-type sorbents. We are now performing a limited number of tests in the NC- 77 sorbent from SNL. Then we plan to continue to (a) fill in data gaps needed for isotherms and dynamic sorbent modeling, and (b) test the performance of additional sorbents under development...|$|R
