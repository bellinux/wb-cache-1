25|$|Finally, motor-skill {{rehabilitation}} {{has been}} proposed as another possible way in which games {{can be used for}} rehabilitation purposes. Stroke patients suffering upper extremity motor difficulties have been the primary focus of this subject and, in this case, a variety of gaming environments have been experimented with. Output has shown that their Fugl-Meyer UE scores and their Functional Independence Measure scale score increase after a period of engaging in virtual rehabilitation, suggesting that their mobility dysfunction decreased and their degree of independence increased due to the intervention. Additionally, output has suggested improved motor skills on a higher level, having several researchers suggesting positive improvements in their stroke patients as a result of virtual rehabilitation methods. At this higher level, researchers have suggested improved ability to walk, or ambulation, and improved use of larger motor skills after intervention. One other class of patients that has been studied less frequently in this category of rehabilitation is cerebral palsy patients. Ability to walk certain distances without the use of an <b>assistive</b> <b>device</b> was the method of measurement for this category. After a period of working with a Wii-based system, it was shown that a patient who struggled with walking large distances before, was able to walk a noticeably longer distance. This suggests an improvement in larger motor skills, whereas the stroke patients demonstrated an improvement in finer motor skills, focused strictly on their use of upper extremities during the gaming rehabilitation.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} the possession of <b>assistive</b> <b>devices</b> and psychological well-being in patients with rheumatic conditions. METHODS: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) were selected from rheumatology outpatient clinics in 2 adjacent regions in The Netherlands and Germany. A total of 142 patients completed a questionnaire on the possession of <b>assistive</b> <b>devices</b> and psychological well-being. Questions on sociodemographics, clinical status, and health status were included. Hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine the unique association between the number of <b>assistive</b> <b>devices</b> per patient and psychological well-being, controlling for confounding variables. RESULTS: Univariately, the number of <b>assistive</b> <b>devices</b> per patient was negatively associated with psychological well-being. Multivariately, the number of <b>assistive</b> <b>devices</b> per patient was positively associated with psychological well-being. Functional status was a negative confounder of {{the relationship between the}} possession of <b>assistive</b> <b>devices</b> and psychological well-being. CONCLUSION: The possession of <b>assistive</b> <b>devices</b> was positively related to psychological well-being of patients with rheumatic diseases, after controlling for differences in functional status...|$|R

Classifications are based on functional mobility. For amputees, {{this is based on}} their mobility with the use of an <b>assistive</b> <b>device.</b> Classification for competitors with cerebral palsy is difficult because the levels of spasticity can change as the race progresses. People with cerebral palsy in classifications from CP1 to CP8 are covered by skiing classifications. [...] Skiers from CP5 to CP8 compete standing up with the use of equipment. Since 1995, the classes area LW2, LW3, LW4, LW5/7, LW6, LW8, and LW9. There are three sit-ski classifications: LW10, LW11 and LW12, with LW10 being divided into LW10 and LW10.5, and LW11 being divided into LW11 and LW11.5. The sport also has three classifications for blind skiers, B1, B2, and B3. These are based solely on medical classification. Research done at the Central Institute on Employment Abilities of the Handicapped in Moscow has found differences in functional capabilities based on differences in visual acuity.

40|$|Background: In Sweden, {{supply of}} <b>assistive</b> <b>devices</b> is a municipal/county council responsibility. Earlier {{research}} has mainly focused the matching of person and device. In contrast, this study concerns the process {{before the actual}} supply is initiated. Aim: Discuss the experience among persons who, for the first time, seek municipal information on <b>assistive</b> <b>devices</b> and the provision thereof through internet pages and contacts with prescribers. Methods: A combined analysis of data from two earlier studies was performed, focusing overall process perspectives: Study 1 described the experience of seeking information from municipal internet pages, and study 2 described the experience of personal contacts with municipal prescribers. Results: Internet pages and prescribers were, in general, perceived as lacking information on <b>assistive</b> <b>devices,</b> whereas information on provision was clearer. Internet sites were difficult to navigate, prescribers difficult to contact. Conclusions: The experience of seeking information on <b>assistive</b> <b>devices</b> through municipal internet pages and contacts with municipal prescribers was less empowering. From a process perspective, {{for a person to}} become an active partner in the actual provision of <b>assistive</b> <b>devices,</b> a person-centered process with improved accessibility to adequate information on <b>assistive</b> <b>devices</b> and provisioning may be a viable step...|$|R

40|$|People in {{developed}} countries are living longer {{with the help of}} medical advances. Literature has shown that older people prefer to stay independent and live at home for as long as possible. Therefore, it is important {{to find out how to}} best accommodate and assist them in maintaining quality of life and independence as well as easing human resources. Researchers have claimed that <b>assistive</b> <b>devices</b> assist in older people’s independence, however, only a small number of studies regarding the efficiency of <b>assistive</b> <b>devices</b> have been undertaken of which several have stated that devices are not being used. The overall aim of this research was to identify whether the disuse and ineffectiveness of <b>assistive</b> <b>devices</b> are related to change in abilities or related to the design of the devices. The objective was to gather information from the elderly; to identify what <b>assistive</b> <b>devices</b> are being used or not used and to gain an understanding on their attitudes towards <b>assistive</b> <b>devices.</b> Research was conducted in two phases. The initial phase of the research was conducted with the distribution of questionnaires to people over the age of fifty that asked general questions and specific questions on type of devices being used. Phase One was followed on by Phase Two, where participants from Phase One who had come in contact with <b>assistive</b> <b>devices</b> were invited to participate in a semi-structured interview. Questions were put forth to the interviewee on their use of and attitudes towards <b>assistive</b> <b>devices.</b> Findings indicated that the reasons for the disuse in <b>assistive</b> <b>devices</b> were mostly design related; bulkiness, reliability, performance of the device, difficulty of use. The other main reason for disuse was socially related; elderly people preferred to undertake activities on their own and only use a device as a precaution or when absolutely necessary. They would prefer not having to rely on the devices. Living situation and difference in gender did not affect the preference for the use of <b>assistive</b> <b>devices</b> over personal assistance. The majority strongly supported the idea of remaining independent for as long as possible. In conclusion, this study proposes that through these findings, product designers will have a better understanding of the requirements of an elderly user. This will enable the designers to produce <b>assistive</b> <b>devices</b> that are more practical, personalised, reliable, easy to use and tie in with the older people’s environments. Additional research with different variables is recommended to further justify these findings...|$|R

40|$|Few {{research}} studies {{focus on how}} the use of assistive technologies is affected by social interaction among people. We present an interview study of 20 individuals to determine how assistive technology use is affected by social and professional contexts and interactions. We found that specific <b>assistive</b> <b>devices</b> sometimes marked their users as having disabilities; that functional access took priority over feeling self-conscious when using assistive technologies; and that two misperceptions pervaded assistive technology use: (1) that <b>assistive</b> <b>devices</b> could functionally eliminate a disability, and (2) that people with disabilities would be helpless without their devices. Our findings provide further evidence that accessibility should be built into mainstream technologies. When this is not feasible, <b>assistive</b> <b>devices</b> should incorporate cutting edge technologies and strive to be designed for social acceptability, a new design approach we propose here.
