5|$|As the West German public's {{awareness}} of the SS atrocities grew in the 1970s and 1980s, the attitudes towards Waffen-SS veterans shifted dramatically. The federal organisation and the local groups were ostracised, with their meetings and commemorations greeted with protests. At the same time, neo-Nazi <b>and</b> <b>nationalist</b> movements found in the Waffen-SS an icon to project their understanding of World War II.|$|E
5|$|Kogălniceanu was a {{democratic}} <b>and</b> <b>nationalist</b> politician who combined liberalism {{with the conservative}} principles acquired during his education, taking inspiration from {{the policies of the}} Prussian statesmen Baron vom und zum Stein and Karl August von Hardenberg. German statesmen were however disinclined to consider him one of their own: Bernhard von Bülow took for granted rumors that he was an agent of the Russians, and further alleged that the Romanian land reform was a sham.|$|E

5|$|Chinese {{nationalist}} forces {{launched a}} large-scale counter-offensive in early 1940. In August, Chinese communists launched an offensive in Central China; in retaliation, Japan instituted harsh measures in occupied areas to reduce human and material {{resources for the}} communists. Continued antipathy between Chinese communist <b>and</b> <b>nationalist</b> forces culminated in armed clashes in January 1941, effectively ending their co-operation. In March, the Japanese 11th army attacked {{the headquarters of the}} Chinese 19th army but was repulsed during Battle of Shanggao. In September, Japan attempted to take the city of Changsha again and clashed with Chinese nationalist forces.|$|E
5|$|Diệm {{refused to}} hold the reunification elections, {{on the basis that}} the State of Vietnam was not a {{signatory}} to the Geneva Accords. He then proceeded to strengthen his autocratic and nepotistic rule over the country. A constitution was written by a rubber stamp legislature which gave Diệm the power to create laws by decree and arbitrarily give himself emergency powers. Dissidents, both communist <b>and</b> <b>nationalist,</b> were jailed and executed in the thousands, and elections were routinely rigged. Opposition candidates were threatened with being charged for conspiring with the Viet Cong, which carried the death penalty, and in many areas, large numbers of ARVN troops were sent to stuff ballot boxes.|$|E
5|$|During an 11-month {{period of}} {{blindness}} in 1902, List became increasingly interested in occultism, in particular coming {{under the influence}} of the Theosophical Society, resulting in an expansion of his Wotanic beliefs to incorporate Runology and the Armanen Futharkh. The popularity of his work among the völkisch <b>and</b> <b>nationalist</b> communities resulted in the establishment of a List Society in 1908; attracting significant middle and upper-class support, the Society published List's writings and included an Ariosophist inner group, the High Armanen Order, over whom List presided as Grand Master.|$|E

5|$|In 1930 or 1931, al-Qassam had {{recruited}} numerous hand-picked {{followers and}} organized them into {{about a dozen}} different circles, each group of supporters unaware {{of the existence of}} the other groups. The majority of his men were peasants and urban laborers. The majority of al-Qassam's circles were based in northern Palestine, but he had disciples throughout the country, including in Gaza in the south. In contrast to traditional Palestinian leaders who campaigned against Zionist settlement while avoiding confrontation with the British authorities, al-Qassam saw it as a priority to fight against both. He also saw the brewing conflict in Palestine as a religious struggle, unlike most Palestinian leaders who advocated a secular <b>and</b> <b>nationalist</b> response. Al-Qassam advocated a moral, political and military jihad as the solution to end British rule and Zionist aspirations in Palestine.|$|E
5|$|In 2017, NATO officially {{recognized}} three aspiring members: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, and Macedonia. Macedonia {{has been}} prevented from joining the alliance by Greece, one {{effect of the}} Macedonian naming dispute. Future expansion is currently a topic of debate in several countries outside the alliance, and countries like Sweden, Finland, and Serbia have open political debate {{on the topic of}} membership, while in countries like Ukraine, support and opposition to membership is tied to ethnic <b>and</b> <b>nationalist</b> ideologies. The incorporation of countries formerly in the Eastern Bloc has been a cause of increased tension between NATO countries and Russia.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s Yeats {{was fascinated}} with the authoritarian, anti-democratic, {{nationalist}} movements of Europe, and he composed several marching songs for the far right Blueshirts, although they were never used. He was a fierce opponent of individualism and political liberalism, and saw the fascist movements as a triumph of public order {{and the needs of}} the national collective over petty individualism. On the other hand, he was also an elitist who abhorred the idea of mob-rule, and saw democracy as a threat to good governance and public order. After the Blueshirt movement began to falter in Ireland, he distanced himself somewhat from his previous views, but maintained a preference for authoritarian <b>and</b> <b>nationalist</b> leadership.|$|E

5|$|Indonesian {{nationalism}} and movements supporting independence from Dutch colonialism, such as Budi Utomo, the Indonesian National Party (PNI), Sarekat Islam, and the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI), grew {{rapidly in the}} first half of the 20th century. Budi Utomo, Sarekat Islam and others pursued strategies of co-operation by joining the Dutch initiated Volksraad ("People's Council") in the hope that Indonesia would be granted self-rule. Others chose a non-cooperative strategy demanding the freedom of self-government from the Dutch East Indies colony. The most notable of these leaders were Sukarno and Mohammad Hatta, two students <b>and</b> <b>nationalist</b> leaders who had benefited from the educational reforms of the Dutch Ethical Policy.|$|E
5|$|Major riots {{broke out}} in Léopoldville, the Congolese capital, on 4 January 1959 after a {{political}} demonstration turned violent. The Force Publique, the colonial gendarmerie, used force against the rioters—at least 49 people were killed, and total casualties may have been as high as 500. The nationalist parties' influence expanded outside the major cities for the first time, <b>and</b> <b>nationalist</b> demonstrations and riots became a regular occurrence over the next year, bringing large numbers of black people from outside the évolué class into the independence movement. Many blacks began to test {{the boundaries of the}} colonial system by refusing to pay taxes or abide by minor colonial regulations. The bulk of the ABAKO leadership was arrested, leaving the MNC in an advantageous position.|$|E
5|$|Nasib al-Bakri (1888–1966) was a Syrian {{politician}} <b>and</b> <b>nationalist</b> {{leader in}} the first half of the 20th century. He played a major role in establishing al-Fatat, an underground organization which sought the independence and unity of the Ottoman Empire's Arab territories. As the chief envoy between al-Fatat and the Hejaz-based Hashemites, al-Bakri became a close aide to Emir Faisal when the latter became King of Syria following the success of the 1916 Arab Revolt. Al-Bakri opposed the establishment of the French Mandate of Syria and became one of the chief commanders of the Great Syrian Revolt, leading the rebels' brief capture of Damascus. He escaped a death warrant in Syria in 1927, but returned the following year after being amnestied.|$|E

5|$|The Wallachian Revolution of 1848 was a Romanian liberal <b>and</b> <b>nationalist</b> {{uprising}} in the Principality of Wallachia. Part of the Revolutions of 1848, and closely {{connected with the}} unsuccessful revolt in the Principality of Moldavia, it sought to overturn the administration imposed by Imperial Russian authorities under the Regulamentul Organic regime, and, through many of its leaders, demanded the abolition of boyar privilege. Led {{by a group of}} young intellectuals and officers in the Wallachian Militia, the movement succeeded in toppling the ruling Prince Gheorghe Bibescu, whom it replaced with a Provisional Government and a Regency, and in passing a series of major progressive reforms, first announced in the Proclamation of Islaz.|$|E
5|$|The {{substance}} of the Agreement (formally {{referred to as the}} Belfast Agreement) was later endorsed by referendums in both parts of Ireland. The Agreement restored self-government to Northern Ireland on the basis of power-sharing in a regional Executive drawn from the major parties in a new Northern Ireland Assembly, with entrenched protections for the two main communities. The Executive is jointly headed by a First Minister and deputy First Minister drawn from the unionist <b>and</b> <b>nationalist</b> parties. Violence had decreased greatly after the Provisional IRA and loyalist ceasefires in 1994 and in 2005 the Provisional IRA announced the end of its armed campaign and an independent commission supervised its disarmament and that of other nationalist and unionist paramilitary organisations.|$|E
5|$|Vorster was so {{angered by}} the raid that he {{immediately}} terminated Operation Polo, under which members of the South African forces had secretly stayed on in Rhodesia after their official withdrawal in August 1975. This and the general international condemnation after Nyadzonya made the Rhodesians very hesitant to authorise any more external operations, even covertly, while the peace process crawled on during {{the last months of}} 1976. Two further unsuccessful rounds of negotiations took place between September and December: first the United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger thrashed out a deal, which in September the Rhodesians accepted and the nationalists rejected, then from October to December 1976 the government <b>and</b> <b>nationalist</b> parties took part in the abortive British-mediated Geneva Conference.|$|E
