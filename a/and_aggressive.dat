40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{analysis}} of personal and environmental variables related to <b>aggressive</b> <b>and</b> unsportsmanlike behaviours {{in a sample of}} Spanish sports competitors. We aim to: 1) ascertain how personality and expression variables relate to trait anger control and unsportsmanlike behaviors, in relation to men and women, age groups and type of sport, 2) identify and analyze the most maladjusted and the most adjusted profiles in a sample of sportsmen and women; 3) identify personality variables as predictors of <b>aggressive</b> <b>and</b> unsportsmanlike behaviours. Differences in gender, age and type of sport were appreciated in personality variables <b>and</b> in <b>aggressive</b> <b>and</b> unsportsmanlike behaviours. Men have better emotional adjustment (more behaviours of emotional stability, better self-esteem, self-confidence and leadership), and have worse social adjustment (fewer behaviours of tolerance, social skills <b>and</b> responsibility; more <b>aggressive</b> <b>and</b> unsportsmanlike behaviours). Women have better social adjustment (more behaviours of tolerance, understanding, adaptation, responsibility, discipline and sociability), and have worse emotional adjustment (greater anxiety). More <b>aggressive</b> <b>and</b> unsportsmanlike behaviours and greater emotional maladjustment were found in the youngest sportsmen <b>and</b> women. <b>Aggressive</b> <b>and</b> unsportsmanlike behaviours were more frequent in team sports. This study highlights personality variables as predictors of <b>aggressive</b> <b>and</b> unsportsmanlike behaviours...|$|R

Undescended testes, hyperactivity <b>and</b> <b>aggressive</b> behavior have also been noted.|$|E

5|$|Some species make a {{hissing noise}} while other {{cockroaches}} make a chirping noise. The Madagascar hissing cockroach produces its sound through the modified spiracles {{on the fourth}} abdominal segment.

5|$|The chapter {{ends with}} a {{discussion}} of animals that can change colour, including fish like the sole, the chameleon, the horned lizards and the tree frogs including the European species Hyla arborea. He cites Poulton's suggestion that the tree frog's camouflage may be both defensive (protecting from predators) <b>and</b> <b>aggressive</b> (facilitating the hunting of insects).|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to base the creatures on real animals was made early on. To offer players variety, {{a mixture of}} benign <b>and</b> <b>aggressive</b> creatures was deemed necessary. The team decided to implement anthropomorphised bipedal animals, because their humanoid form evoked empathy, and credibility in their potential sentience. Due to technical restraints, bipedal creatures also provided greater flexibility for animation and game dynamics.|$|E

5|$|After {{this day}} of fierce fighting, which has been {{described}} as the hardest-fought action of the whole Sinai campaign, the Anzac Mounted Division's advance was effectively stopped. Chauvel ordered the division to return to water at Oghratina, despite Lawrence's wish for them to bivouac close to Bir el Abd but Chauvel concluded that his force was in no condition to remain within reach of this strong <b>and</b> <b>aggressive</b> enemy force. Further, the Anzac Mounted Division had lost a significant proportion of their strength; over 300 casualties, including eight officers and 65 other ranks killed.|$|E
5|$|Although {{encompassing}} diverse mainstream and underground styles, {{the music}} of the NWOBHM is best remembered for drawing on the heavy metal of the 1970s and infusing it with the intensity of punk rock to produce fast <b>and</b> <b>aggressive</b> songs. The DIY attitude of the new metal bands led to the spread of raw-sounding, self-produced recordings and a proliferation of independent record labels. Song lyrics were usually about escapist themes such as mythology, fantasy, horror and the rock lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|Bubbles was {{initially}} kept at the Jackson family's home in Encino, Los Angeles, but {{was moved to}} Neverland Ranch in 1988. There, he slept in a crib in Jackson's bedroom, used the singer's toilet and ate candy in the Neverland movie theater. By 2003, like many captive chimpanzees, Bubbles had matured into a large <b>and</b> <b>aggressive</b> adult chimp unsuitable as a companion animal. He {{was sent to a}} California animal trainer. When the trainer closed his operation in 2004, Bubbles was moved to the Center for Great Apes, a sanctuary in Wauchula, Florida, where he has lived since 2005.|$|E

5|$|Consequently, under Seydlitz's direction, by {{the start}} of the Seven Years' War, the cavalry had become Frederick's pride and joy: it had unrivaled {{training}} and an esprit de corps bolstered by Frederick's confidence in its members, and by their confidence in Seydlitz. The King had issued orders that no Prussian cavalryman would allow himself to be attacked without a commensurate response, under penalty of being cashiered; consequently, Prussian cavalrymen were active, impetuous <b>and</b> <b>aggressive.</b> For the King, Seydlitz's cavalry became the dynamic factor in the army of the state, and would be the tool by which Frederick could challenge empires. In 1756, Seydlitz's cavalry became Frederick's weapon of choice.|$|E
5|$|During Barkley's {{eight seasons}} in Philadelphia, {{he became a}} {{household}} name {{and was one of}} the few NBA players to have a figure published by Kenner's Starting Lineup toy line. He also had his own signature shoe line with Nike. His outspoken <b>and</b> <b>aggressive</b> play, however, resulted in some on-court incidents, notoriously a fight with Detroit Pistons center Bill Laimbeer in 1990, which drew a record total $162,500 fine.|$|E
5|$|Frequently, two Eye-related goddesses appear together, {{representing}} {{different aspects}} of the Eye. The juxtaposed deities often stand for the procreative <b>and</b> <b>aggressive</b> sides of the Eye's character, as Hathor and Sekhmet sometimes do. Wadjet and Nekhbet can stand for Lower and Upper Egypt, respectively, along with the Red Crown and White Crown that represent the two lands. Similarly, Mut, whose main cult center was in Thebes, sometimes served as an Upper Egyptian counterpart of Sekhmet, who was worshipped in Memphis in Lower Egypt.|$|E

The initiative passed to Major General Hatazō Adachi's Eighteenth Army which launched a series of counter-attacks against Major General George Wootten's 9th Division in the Battle of Finschhafen. At the Battle of Sattelberg, Wootten finally inflicted a crushing defeat on Adachi.|$|E

5|$|Gottesman first {{studied the}} {{genetics}} of schizophrenia {{on a large}} scale using the Maudsley–Bethlem register of twin admissions for 16 years. Later he worked on psychiatric genetics and genomics. In his Twin Cities MMPI study, part of his Ph.D. thesis, Gottesman found high levels of inheritance in the scales related to schizophrenia, depression, anti-social personality disorder, and social introversion. Genes strongly influenced social introversion <b>and</b> <b>aggressive</b> tendencies. This led to further studies on personality traits of identical twins such as the Minnesota Study of Identical Twins Reared Apart.|$|E
