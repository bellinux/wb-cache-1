5|$|John Nott's The Cooks and Confectioners Dictionary (1723), {{still with}} rather few {{precedents}} to go by, chose an alphabetical treatment for its recipes, from Al to Zest.

5|$|According to {{the book}} Alfred Hitchcock <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Making</b> <b>of</b> Psycho, the censors in charge of {{enforcing}} the Production Code wrangled with Hitchcock because some of them insisted they could see one of Leigh's breasts. Hitchcock held onto the print for several days, left it untouched, and resubmitted it for approval. Each of the censors reversed their positions: those who had previously seen the breast now did not, {{and those who had}} not, now did. They passed the film after the director removed one shot that showed the buttocks of Leigh's stand-in. The board was also upset by the racy opening, so Hitchcock said that if they let him keep the shower scene he would re-shoot the opening with them on the set. Since they did not show up for the re-shoot, the opening stayed.|$|E
5|$|Eastwood {{directed}} {{and starred in}} White Hunter Black Heart (1990), an adaptation of Peter Viertel's roman à clef, about John Huston <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>making</b> <b>of</b> the classic film The African Queen. Shot on location in Zimbabwe {{in the summer of}} 1989, the film received some critical attention but with only a limited release earned just $8.4million. Later in 1990, Eastwood {{directed and}} co-starred with Charlie Sheen in The Rookie, a buddy cop action film. Critics found the film's plot and characterization unconvincing, but praised its action sequences. An ongoing lawsuit, in response to Eastwood allegedly ramming a woman's car, resulted in no Eastwood films being shown in cinemas in 1991. Eastwood won the suit and agreed to pay the complainant's legal fees if she did not appeal.|$|E

5|$|Still {{photographs}} and scripts {{for the production}} survive, as do some amateur off-air reel-to-reel audio tape recordings of four of Dylan's songs. In 2005 the BBC launched {{a search for a}} video recording of the play, uncovering some audio recordings of the songs, but it seems that a full off-air audio copy does not exist. In April 2007, BBC Four broadcast a documentary about the making of the play in the Arena strand, featuring interviews with Saville, Jones, Martin Carthy, Peggy Seeger, Dylan collector Ian Woodward, and the first re-broadcast of the songs from the play.
