5|$|At the airport, Jai is {{overwhelmed}} with guilt and asks Sahil to leave, {{to which he}} protests. Jai refutes his advances to reconcile, and tells him that they can never be together because they have vastly different lives. They part ways as a heartbroken Sahil watches him leave. As he is walking <b>away</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> airport, Jai sends a text message to Sahil saying that he loves him. Alex arrives at the airport to pick Sahil up, much to his surprise.

5|$|Realizing how {{important}} Toby is to her, Sarah gives him Lancelot {{and returns to}} her room. After she hears her father and stepmother come in, she sees her friends {{in the mirror and}} realizes even though she is growing up, she still needs them in her life every now and again. In an instant, a number of the major characters from the Labyrinth appear in her room for a raucous celebration, and she reunites with Hoggle, Ludo, Didymus, and Ambrosius. As they celebrate, Jareth, in his owl form, watches from outside and then flies <b>away</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> night.|$|E
5|$|Timmy {{wakes up}} in what looks like his bedroom; in reality he is still inside The Darkness, {{and the world is}} merely an {{illusion}} to him. Timmy's fairy godparents and Jorgen come to rescue him, and they exit The Darkness successfully. Back on Earth, the Lead Eliminator uses Jorgen's wand to poof Timmy's friends and family <b>away</b> <b>into</b> <b>The</b> Darkness. Military Extraterrestrial Research Facility (M.E.R.F.) agents launch an array of military weapons at the Eliminator, but he absorbs the ordnance and turns into a more powerful version, the Destructinator. He surrounds the Earth with a steel casing, which transforms the M.E.R.F. agents into his henchmen. They plant explosives inside Earth and give the Destructinator a detonation remote.|$|E
5|$|Mac {{returns to}} work after a month's leave. When Caroline meets him she implies that she is engaged to Guy. Mac and Guy are then drunk in a bar, where Mac tells Guy {{he is going to}} die {{in a couple of weeks}} and makes Guy promise he will not tell Caroline. However, Guy tells Martin, who then {{complains}} to him about his selfishness. However, Caroline walks in and overhears the argument. Meanwhile, Mac suggests to Sue that she finds someone else to love. Caroline confronts Mac about marrying her. Mac defends himself by saying it would be better for her to marry Guy because he will live longer. Guy later decides to do the right thing, and tells Mac to propose to Caroline because they love each other. Caroline and Mac therefore become engaged and later marry, where the majority of the core cast are in attendance. At the wedding, Sue is seen with a new boyfriend. The special ends with Caroline floating <b>away</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sky holding a mass of helium balloons.|$|E

5|$|The city fell after a {{brief but}} bloody battle in which many Itza warriors died; the Spanish {{suffered}} only minor casualties. The Spanish bombardment caused heavy loss {{of life on the}} island; the surviving Itza abandoned their capital and swam across to the mainland with many dying in the water. After the battle the surviving defenders melted <b>away</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> forests, leaving the Spanish to occupy an abandoned Maya town. Martín de Ursúa planted his standard upon the highest point of the island and renamed Nojpetén as Nuestra Señora de los Remedios y San Pablo, Laguna del Itza ("Our Lady of Remedy and Saint Paul, Lake of the Itza"). The Itza nobility fled, dispersing to Maya settlements throughout Petén; in response the Spanish scoured the region with search parties. Kan Ek' was soon captured with help from the Yalain Maya ruler Chamach Xulu; The Kowoj king (Aj Kowoj) was also soon captured, together with other Maya nobles and their families. With the defeat of the Itza, the last independent and unconquered native kingdom in the Americas fell to the European colonisers.|$|E
5|$|The game {{takes place}} in a fantasy version of feudal Japan, and follows a rōnin named Shiren and his companion, the talking weasel Koppa, on a quest for the Land of the Golden Condor. They travel through forests, towns, {{mountains}} and caves, and are joined by three people they meet during the journey: Kechi the Masseur, a man who pretends to be blind; Oryu the Blinder, a travelling woman who has the power to blind people and monsters; and Pekeji, a man who claims to be Shiren's brother, separated at birth. Shiren eventually reaches the land, where he frees the golden condor from an ancient insect-like creature. He and Koppa ride away on the condor, flying across the towns he had passed, and the townspeople look up at the condor and make a wish. The condor lands, letting Shiren and Koppa jump off, before flying away. The game ends with Shiren and Koppa walking <b>away</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> night.|$|E
5|$|Martín de Ursúa y Arizmendi {{arrived on}} the western shore of lake Petén Itzá with his {{soldiers}} in February 1697, and once there built a galeota, a large and heavily armed oar-powered attack boat. The Itza capital fell in a bloody waterborne assault on 13 March 1697. The Spanish bombardment caused heavy loss {{of life on the}} island; many Itza Maya who fled to swim across the lake were killed in the water. After the battle the surviving defenders melted <b>away</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> forests, leaving the Spanish to occupy an abandoned Maya town. The Itza and Kowoj kings (Ajaw Kan Ek' and Aj Kowoj) were soon captured, together with other Maya nobles and their families. With Nojpetén safely {{in the hands of the}} Spanish, Ursúa returned to Campeche; he left a small garrison on the island, isolated amongst the hostile Itza and Kowoj who still dominated the mainland. Nojpetén was renamed by the Spanish as Nuestra Señora de los Remedios y San Pablo, Laguna del Itza ("Our Lady of Remedy and Saint Paul, Lake of the Itza"). The garrison was reinforced in 1699 by a military expedition from Guatemala, accompanied by mixed-race ladino civilians who came to found their own town around the military camp. The settlers brought disease with them, which killed many soldiers and colonists and swept through the indigenous population. The Guatemalans stayed just three months before returning to Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala, taking the captive Itza king with them, together with his son and two of his cousins. The cousins died on the long journey to the colonial capital; Ajaw Kan Ek' and his son spent the rest of their lives under house arrest in the capital.|$|E

5|$|Martín de Urzúa y Arizmendi {{arrived on}} the western shore of Lake Petén Itzá with his {{soldiers}} on 26 February 1697. Once there they built a heavily armed galeota attack boat, which carried 114 men and at least five artillery pieces. On 10 March, Ursúa received a mixed Itza and Yalain embassy in peace, and invited Kan Ek' to visit his encampment three days later. On the appointed day, Kan Ek' failed to arrive; instead Maya warriors amassed both along the shore and in canoes upon the lake. That morning, a waterbourne assault was launched upon Kan Ek's capital. The city fell after a brief but bloody battle in which many Itza warriors died; the Spanish suffered only minor casualties. After the battle the surviving defenders swam across to the mainland and melted <b>away</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> forests, leaving the Spanish to occupy the abandoned town.

25|$|There {{were further}} minor battles and {{surrender}}s of Confederate armies, but Lee's surrender on April 9, 1865, marked the effective {{end of the}} Civil War. Lee, rejecting advice from some of his staff, wanted to ensure that his army did not melt <b>away</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> countryside to continue the war as guerrillas, helping to heal the divisions of the country.|$|E

25|$|The {{presence}} of ground permafrost {{is important to}} the persistence of some lakes. According to research published in the journal Science ("Disappearing Arctic Lakes", June 2005), thawing permafrost may explain the shrinking or disappearance of hundreds of large Arctic lakes across western Siberia. The idea here is that rising air and soil temperatures thaw permafrost, allowing the lakes to drain <b>away</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ground.|$|E
25|$|Information: One {{traditional}} custom to {{mark the}} end of the Bon Festival. Small paper lanterns containing a burning flame are either set afloat to a river, lake or sea or they are let go and float <b>away</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> night. Their light is intended to guide the way for deceased family members' spirits. Usually the person who lets the lantern go will write a message on the side.|$|E
25|$|Many small reptiles, such as {{snakes and}} lizards that {{live on the}} ground or in the water, are {{vulnerable}} to being preyed on by all kinds of carnivorous animals. Thus avoidance is {{the most common form of}} defense in reptiles. At the first sign of danger, most snakes and lizards crawl <b>away</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> undergrowth, and turtles and crocodiles will plunge into water and sink out of sight.|$|E

25|$|The Yorkshire troops {{proceeded}} {{to conquer the}} isolated Royalist posts in their county. The Scots marched off to besiege Newcastle-on-Tyne and to hold in check a nascent Royalist army in Westmorland. Rupert, in Lancashire, they neglected entirely. Manchester and Cromwell, already estranged, marched <b>away</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Eastern Association. There, for want of an enemy to fight, their army was forced to be idle. Cromwell, and the ever-growing Independent element, quickly came to suspect their commander of lukewarmness in the cause. Waller's army, too, was spiritless and immobile.|$|E
25|$|An {{extremely}} thin, skeleton-like {{creature who}} is one of the more frequently appearing freaks. Like all of the other freaks, he once desired to be younger and was eventually tricked into joining the carnival. The Skeleton appears to be one of the more loyal freaks as, near the book's end, he takes the time to carry the recently deceased and young Mr. Dark with him after all the other freaks ran away. He is last seen walking <b>away</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> hills that border the town.|$|E
25|$|Weather {{conditions}} in the area can be extreme, with the Roaring Forties wind being a particular problem. The maximum wind gust ever recorded was 176km/h. Reportedly, the first keepers of the light took chickens with them to Maatsuyker but the fowls blew <b>away</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> ocean. Given the wind and lack of shelter, this is possible if they were left outside during storms. Vegetables get blown flat by the wind, but surprisingly, can be grown successfully, even though the garden is {{on the west side}} of the island, facing into the prevailing winds.|$|E
