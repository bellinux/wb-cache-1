5|$|This {{can be used}} {{to derive}} the {{correlation}} of the quantum polarisations of the two photons. Their prediction was confirmed experimentally by Chien-Shiung Wu and I. Shaknov in 1950. This was the first experimental confirmation of a pair of entangled photons as <b>applicable</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox. The result was subsequently explained by Richard Dalitz and Frank Duarte. Apparently following Dirac's doctrine, Ward was never bothered by issues of interpretation in quantum mechanics.|$|E
5|$|A District Superintendent of Police, {{better known}} as a Superintendent of Police, heads the District Police {{organisation}} of West Bengal Police. This is as per the Police Act of 1861, which is <b>applicable</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> whole of India. The Superintendents of Police are officers of the Indian Police Service. For every subdivision, there is a Subdivision Police, headed by a Police officer of the rank of Assistant Superintendent of Police or Deputy Superintendent of Police. Under subdivisions, there are Police Circles, each headed by an Inspector of Police. A Police Circle consists of Police Stations, each headed by an Inspector of Police, or in case of rural areas, by a Sub-Inspector of Police.|$|E
5|$|A {{second factor}} which {{contributes}} to a concentrated jet, that is more <b>applicable</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> subtropical jet, which forms at the poleward limit of the tropical Hadley cell and to first order this circulation is symmetric with respect to longitude. Tropical air rises to the tropopause, and moves poleward before sinking; this is the Hadley cell circulation. As it does so it tends to conserve angular momentum, since friction with the ground is significant. Air masses that begin moving poleward are deflected eastward by the Coriolis force (true for either hemisphere), which for poleward moving air implies an increased eastward component of the winds (note that leftward deflection in the southern hemisphere).|$|E

5|$|Another {{important}} experiment {{carried out}} by Wu was the confirmation of the E. M. L. Pryce and John Clive Ward's calculations on the correlation of the quantum polarizations of two photons propagating in opposite directions. This was the first experimental confirmation of quantum results relevant {{to a pair of}} entangled photons as <b>applicable</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox. Wu later conducted research into the molecular changes in the deformation of hemoglobins that cause sickle-cell disease. She also did research on magnetism, and on the Mössbauer effect during the 1960s. She wrote a textbook with , Beta Decay, which was published in 1966, and became a standard reference on the subject.|$|E
5|$|Germanwings' {{parent company}} Lufthansa offered victims' {{families}} an initial aid payment {{of up to}} €50,000, separate from any legally-required compensation for the disaster. Elmar Giemulla, a professor of aviation law at the Technical University of Berlin quoted by the Rheinische Post, said he expected the airline would pay €10–30million in compensation. The Montreal Convention sets a per-victim cap of €143,000 in the event an airline is held liable, unless negligence can be proved. Insurance specialists said although co-pilot Andreas Lubitz hid a serious illness from his employer and deliberately crashed the passenger aircraft, these facts would not affect the issue of compensation nor be <b>applicable</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> exclusion clause in Lufthansa's insurance policy. Lufthansa's insurance company set aside US$300million (€280million) for financial compensation to victims' families and {{for the cost of}} the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, a {{team led}} by David Burney {{collected}} breccias containing remains of bats and other animals from the cave of Anjohibe in northwestern Madagascar. The bats in the sample were described by Karen Samonds (previously Irwin) in her 2006 Ph.D. dissertation and a 2007 paper. She found several living species in addition to two extinct ones that she described as new, Triaenops goodmani and Hipposideros besaoka. At the time, the genus Triaenops was thought to include three species on Madagascar–Triaenops auritus, Triaenops furculus, and Triaenops rufus. Since then, Steven Goodman and Julie Ranivo have discovered that the name rufus is not in fact <b>applicable</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Madagascar species and proposed the name Triaenops menamena for the Madagascan bats previously known as Triaenops rufus.|$|E

5|$|The only {{objection}} is, {{not that}} the Court acted beyond its jurisdiction, but that it erred in its judgment of the law <b>applicable</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> case.

If this were an application for a habeas corpus, after judgment on an indictment for an offence within the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, it could hardly be maintained, that this court could revise such a judgment, or the proceedings which led to it, or set it aside, and discharge the prisoner.|$|E
