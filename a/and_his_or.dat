5|$|Like {{all other}} Pokémon RPGs, Diamond and Pearl {{begin in the}} protagonist's hometown. After viewing a {{television}} report about a media-conducted search for a Red Gyarados, which was spotted at a faraway lake (Johto's Lake of Rage), the protagonist <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> her best friend travel together to check the local lake for a Pokémon like it. They spot Professor Rowan, a Pokémon evolution researcher, and his assistant, the playable character not selected in the game: Lucas (boy) or Dawn (girl). After a short discussion, the professor and his assistant leave the lake, leaving a briefcase behind. When they are attacked by wild Starly, the protagonist <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> her rival examine the case. The player is then given a choice among the three Pokémon found in the briefcase (Turtwig, Chimchar, or Piplup) with which to battle the Starly. After defeating the Starly, Lucas or Dawn retrieves and returns the briefcase to the professor. Noticing that a bond has been forged between the young protagonist <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> her chosen Pokémon, Rowan offers it to him or her, asking {{that he or she}} embark on a journey and fill his or her Pokédex.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} each song, {{a result}} screen is {{displayed}} to player, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> her performance is rated with a letter grade, a numerical score, and a percentage that represents his or her accuracy. The player is awarded a number of fans and in-game money for his or her performance. The number of fans determine the idols' ranking, and as the player's idols increase in ranking, more items become available for purchase. These items can then be used to customize the game's appearance or adjust gameplay elements, such as straightening the Melody Lines' shapes or causing the player to gain fans quicker. Finishing a song also earns the player Memories with the idols who perform the song, which can be used in the Star of Festa game mode.|$|E

5|$|The aim of cognition-oriented treatments, {{which include}} reality {{orientation}} and cognitive retraining, is {{the reduction of}} cognitive deficits. Reality orientation consists in the presentation of information about time, place or person to ease {{the understanding of the}} person about its surroundings <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> her place in them. On the other hand, cognitive retraining tries to improve impaired capacities by exercitation of mental abilities. Both have shown some efficacy improving cognitive capacities, although in some studies these effects were transient and negative effects, such as frustration, have also been reported.|$|E
5|$|The monarch <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> her {{immediate}} family undertake various official, ceremonial, diplomatic and representational duties. As the monarchy is constitutional, the monarch {{is limited to}} non-partisan functions such as bestowing honours and appointing the Prime Minister. The monarch is, by tradition, commander-in-chief of the British Armed Forces. Though the ultimate formal executive authority over {{the government of the}} United Kingdom is still by and through the monarch's royal prerogative, these powers may only be used according to laws enacted in Parliament and, in practice, within the constraints of convention and precedent.|$|E
5|$|The second {{follow-up}} study {{was done in}} 1998 by Kitayama and Uchida. They sought to investigate {{the relationship between a}} person's name-letter effect <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> her birthday-number effect, given that Kitayama and Karasawa had suspected a single driving force behind both. As they had predicted, Kitayama and Uchida found that within a person the two effects were correlated. Later studies confirmed this finding.|$|E

25|$|The Presidium of the Verkhovna Rada is a {{collective}} name that was adapted for the Chairman <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> her deputies out of tradition.
