500|$|Some time later, Andy meets up with Nate, who {{is moving}} to Boston because he got a new job as the sous chef of a restaurant. They agree to start dating again <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> future holds. The same day, Andy is interviewed and is {{accepted}} {{to work at a}} major New York publication company. The editor recounts how he called Runway for a reference on Andy, and got a response from Miranda herself. Miranda described Andy as [...] "her biggest disappointment"- and said that the editor would be [...] "an idiot" [...] if he didn't hire her. Emily is offered her Paris wardrobe by Andy and the two leave on good terms. Andy passes the [...] "Runway" [...] office building and sees Miranda get into a car. Andy gives a wave, but Miranda does not acknowledge her. Andy is used to this and instead walks further into the crowd. Once inside the car, however, Miranda smiles and then orders her chauffeur to drive.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the oral}} argument, the Chief Justice {{assigned}} Justice John Paul Stevens {{to write the}} majority opinion and Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. asked Justice Thurgood Marshall to write the minority or dissenting opinion, based on the initial count of the justices' views. [...] Since Justice Potter Stewart {{did not participate in}} the case, it would take a 5-3 vote to overturn the decision of the Circuit Court. [...] Stevens circulated a memorandum stating that his decision would be to invalidate the tax - Chief Justice Warren Burger and Justice William Rehnquist immediately stated they would join his opinion. [...] Justice Byron White stated that he would wait <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> dissent said, and then indicated he would join the dissent in part. [...] It also appeared that Justice Harry Blackmun was also going to write a separate dissent, but he also stated that he would wait to see Marshall's opinion. [...] At this point, the tribe had the votes to win on a 4-4 vote, but the Court was close to being adjourned for the summer recess. [...] On July 3, 1981, the Court notified the parties to reargue the case on November 4, 1981.|$|E
500|$|Gilly later {{finds himself}} {{attracted}} to Lynsey Nolan (Karen Hassan); he initially fears he is {{moving on to}} soon. Whilst interviewed by Inside Soap Quinlan describes the scenes in which they share their first kiss stating: [...] "Gilly gets a new job at Look Sharpe as a personal trainer, and invites Lynsey for a free session, Lynsey's looking pretty good when she turns up, so Gilly gets a bit sweaty and hot under the collar - and she ends up hopping into the tub and dragging Gilly in fully clothed!" [...] They later meet up and feel awkward because of Gilly's grief for Steph, of this Quinlan adds: [...] "They're getting on well, {{but as soon as}} the word date is mentioned, it goes a bit wrong, nerves get the better of them and they have a huge row." [...] Off-screen Quinlan was not happy with the fact Gilly is trying to move on quick, of this he states: [...] "I thought it was a bit harsh, it feels like it's a little too soon, doesn't it? We'll just have to wait <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> future holds for Gilly and Lynsey - but there's no comparison to Steph..." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In God's name, <b>what's</b> <b>the</b> matter?" [...] {{said the}} {{astonished}} horseman, endeavouring to extricate his bridle from {{the grasp of}} the old woman; [...] "for Heaven's sake, let me go <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what's</b> <b>the</b> matter." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Very well, darling. That's all right. Stay {{as long as}} you like. Don't {{trouble to}} get up if you'd rather have your breakfast in bed. And don't hurry {{yourself}} at all. I'll come back by-and-by <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what's</b> <b>the</b> matter." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{new owners}} of RKO made an initial effort {{to revive the}} studio, hiring veteran {{producer}} William Dozier to head production. A needed cash infusion was realized in 1954 when the 89 acre RKO Encino movie ranch was sold off {{to make way for}} a new tract home development. [...] During the first half of 1956, the production facilities were as busy as they had been in a half-decade. RKO Teleradio Pictures released Fritz Lang's final two American films, While the City Sleeps and Beyond a Reasonable Doubt (both 1956), but years of mismanagement had driven away many directors, producers, and stars. Other films included Bundle of Joy, a remake of the Ginger Rogers-starring Bachelor Mother which was re-tooled as a vehicle for star couple Eddie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds. Rogers herself would make a film for the new RKO (The First Traveling Saleslady) and would later comment that [...] "coming back to RKO was like coming back to a picnic you've been on last week, and pick up the bones all around <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> ants have taken from the lunch that you left." [...] The studio was also saddled with the last of the inflated B movies such as Pearl of the South Pacific (1955) and The Conqueror (1956) that enchanted Hughes. The latter, starring John Wayne, was the biggest hit produced at the studio during the decade, but its $4.5 million in North American rentals did not come close to covering its $6 million cost.|$|E
2500|$|After the race, Senna {{assessed}} his new car's performance: [...] "I {{had small}} {{problems with the}} gearbox, and the car balance was not optimum, {{so it was very}} difficult to drive. I'm looking forward to running a proper circuit with proper conditions <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> car can do." ...|$|E

Congress could do all that, though, couldn't it? ...|$|E
6000|$|My little maid's {{face was}} so eager and her quiet hands were folded so closely {{in one another}} as she stood looking at me that I had no great {{difficulty}} in reading her thoughts. [...] "Well, Charley," [...] said I, [...] "it appears {{to me that you}} and I can do no better than go round to Jenny's <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what's</b> <b>the</b> matter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Get away!" [...] {{shouted the}} older man. [...] "Gregg hired {{me to do}} this work, and it don't matter whether I live or die; but you've got {{something}} to do in the world. My girl needs you, and she don't need me, so get out o' here and stay out. Go bring me that wood, and I'll go in <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what's</b> <b>the</b> matter." ...|$|R

2500|$|On August 29, 2009, Couture faced former UFC Interim Heavyweight Champion {{and former}} PRIDE Heavyweight Champion Antônio Rodrigo Nogueira at UFC 102 in Portland, Oregon, and lost a {{unanimous}} decision. After the bout, Couture stated {{he felt he}} was in the best shape of his life, and would wait <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> UFC had in store for him. The fight received the [...] "Fight of the Night" [...] award.|$|E
2500|$|Even {{though most}} of their {{original}} land was taken over, {{this was the first}} turning point for the Pomo people. They had finally escaped the harsh road they were once a part of, and even though they had to settle on poor, isolated land, they finally got to make a stride towards tradition and basket weaving. [...] From 1852-1878, many Pomo Indians tried to rekindle their cultures and find peace to what had happened to them. Many people let this time be a learning and spiritual time, where they could have visions <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> future would have in store. It was a time to build, a time to connect, a time of hope, and a time of change.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} of stoppage, Joshua was ahead on two judges {{scorecards}} (96–93 and 95–93) and the third judge had Klitschko ahead (95–93). CompuBox stats showed that Joshua landed 107 of his 355 punches thrown (30%), and Klitschko landed 94 of 256 (37%). In the post fight interviews, Klitschko spoke about the rematch clause, but gave no indication {{as to whether he}} would activate it, [...] "Of course we have a rematch in the contract. I need to analyze <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> heck happened. I wish I could have raised my hands, but congrats to him. He got up, he fought back, and he won the titles." [...] In the press conference after the fight, Joshua said he would have no issues with having another fight with Klitschko, [...] "I don’t mind fighting him again, if he wants the rematch. Big respect to Wladimir for challenging the young lions of the division. It’s up to him, I don’t mind. As long as Rob thinks it’s good I’m good to go." [...] Eddie Hearn said Joshua's next fight would likely take place {{at the end of the}} year, possibly at the Principality Stadium in Cardiff.|$|E
