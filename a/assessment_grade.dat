This study was an attempt to better understand the classroom <b>assessment</b> and <b>grading</b> practices of teachers, which have previously been described as a 2 ̆ 2 hodgepodge 2 ̆ 2 mix of student attitude, effort and achievement. Specifically, the following questions regarding teachers 2 ̆ 7 <b>assessment</b> and <b>grading</b> practices were addressed: What is the current state of <b>assessment</b> practice and <b>grading</b> by teachers?

40|$|The {{assessment}} {{reform movement}} {{has focused on}} classroom <b>assessment</b> and <b>grading</b> practices as a potential means to improving teaching and learning. Many researchers agree {{that the best way}} to enhance learning for a diverse range of students is through appropriate, reliable, and valid classroom <b>assessment</b> and <b>grading</b> practices. This is of particular importance in Saskatchewan because the inclusive philosophy has been mandated for all schools. Classroom teachers are responsible for the instruction, <b>assessment,</b> and <b>grading</b> of students with mild disabilities, learning, emotional, and behavioral challenges, and other needs that require specific attention. This study examined secondary classroom teachers’ <b>assessment</b> and <b>grading</b> practices in one urban school division. A survey instrument adapted from the work of Duncan and Noonan (2007) and McMillan (2001) asked current secondary teachers, within inclusive classrooms, to indicate their current <b>assessment</b> and <b>grading</b> practices. Evidence from the survey demonstrated that teachers in this division have diverse <b>assessment</b> and <b>grading</b> practices and that they have begun to explore the potential for assessment to assist all students in their learning.

Science method pre-service teachers from a university in New South Wales who gained fulltime employment on completion of their course {{were invited to participate}} in the research project during their first year of teaching. Data was collected from the interested participants to identify their conceptions, actual and intended practices of <b>assessment</b> and <b>grading</b> in three stages using a questionnaire and semi structured interviews in a longitudinal study. Data collected at different stages was compared to describe the learning experiences of new teachers. Furthermore, qualitative data from interviews was analysed to describe how school based teaching experience affect the learning of new teachers. It was found that new teachers experience changes in their conceptions and practices of <b>assessment</b> and <b>grading</b> during the first school semester of their teaching experience. There was minimal change in the teachers' conceptions about the general purpose of <b>assessment</b> and <b>grading.</b> However, there were noticeable changes in the teachers' conceptions about the quality of <b>assessment</b> and <b>grading</b> in terms of what constitutes as acceptable practices of <b>assessment</b> and <b>grading.</b> This suggests that school based teaching experience play a significant role in the learning of the new teachers about <b>assessment</b> and <b>grading,</b> although teachers did not attribute this change to their teaching experience at this school.

Consequently, attention should be paid to panels where the concrete cover of longitudinal reinforcement has spalled (grade 0) which could {{be a sign of}} decreasing load capacity. The majority of panels with grade 0 exhibited larger deflections under load than panels with higher grades. Of the 46 panels tested flexural ductile failure was noticed at 36 panels.

Photovoice allowed participants to visually represent their experiences and engage in dialogue about emotions linked to mental health and illness. Discussion questions were designed to uncover the situations in which children experience the emotions of sadness, worry, anger, and happiness, as well as what they find to be helpful in handling or promoting these emotions. Four major themes were uncovered during the content analysis of the photovoice discussions: Emotions are linked to the physical world; Adults can be a source of help and support; Negative emotions occur when things are not as they should be; and Safety is important for well-being.

Our aim was to administer and validate a competencies list, for self-evaluation by medical students of their confidence to manage common clinical tasks in obstetrics and gynaecology; to evaluate students’ views on course changes that may result from increasing class sizes. Methods: A draft list of competencies was peer-reviewed, and discussed at two student focus groups. The resultant list was administered {{as part of an}} 81 item online survey. Results: Sixty-eight percent (N[*]=[*] 172) of those eligible completed the survey. Most respondents (75. 8 %) agreed or strongly agreed that they felt confident and well equipped to recognise and manage most common and important obstetric and gynaecological conditions. Confidence was greater for women, and for those who received a higher <b>assessment</b> <b>grade.</b> Free-text data highlight reasons for lack of clinical experience that may impact perceived confidence. Conclusions: The document listing competencies for medical students and educators is useful for discussions around a national curriculum in obstetrics and gynaecology in medical schools, including the best methods of delivery, particularly in the context of increasing student numbers.
