5|$|Heavier {{isotopes}} of neptunium decay quickly, {{and lighter}} isotopes of neptunium cannot {{be produced by}} neutron capture, so chemical separation of neptunium from cooled spent nuclear fuel gives nearly pure 237Np.

5|$|A diamond {{simulant}} is a non-diamond {{material that}} is used to simulate the appearance of a diamond, and may be referred to as diamante. Cubic zirconia is the most common.

5|$|A {{series of}} solid, fast {{decaying}} sounds <b>are</b> <b>produced</b> using dampening techniques.

5|$|A {{white dwarf}} star may {{accumulate}} sufficient material from a stellar companion to raise its core temperature enough to ignite carbon fusion, at which point it undergoes runaway nuclear fusion, completely disrupting it. There are three avenues by which this detonation is theorized to happen: stable accretion of material from a companion, the collision of two white dwarfs, or accretion that causes ignition in a shell that then ignites. The dominant mechanism by which Type Ia supernovae <b>are</b> <b>produced</b> remains unclear. Despite this uncertainty in how Type Ia supernovae <b>are</b> <b>produced,</b> Type Ia supernovae have very uniform properties, and are useful standard candles over intergalactic distances. Some calibrations are required {{to compensate for the}} gradual change in properties or different frequencies of abnormal luminosity supernovae at high red shift, and for small variations in brightness identified by light curve shape or spectrum.|$|E
