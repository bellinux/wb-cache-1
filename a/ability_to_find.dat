5|$|Tanguay is {{best known}} for his playmaking skills and ability to set his {{teammates}} up for scoring opportunities. His speed and passing skills are considered his strongest attributes. Calgary teammates Olli Jokinen and Jarome Iginla both praised his <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a way to pass the puck to them in difficult plays.|$|E
5|$|Strong {{possessed the}} <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> good holes on land that seemed far too severe for golf {{and had the}} gumption to build very bold and {{distinctive}} holes that are open to criticism but clearly are more thought provoking and interesting than most other architect's work. The green slopes that he envisioned and built on his courses were the single best defense of a hole.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{driver of}} this {{difference}} is due to cultural standards that give women little leverage {{in the selection of}} their partner. Elder family members must find suitable husbands for young females in the households. If women are known to have adverse previous medical histories, their <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a partner is significantly reduced. This difference leads to diverging health outcomes for men and women.|$|E
50|$|A medical {{intuitive}} is {{an alternative}} medicine practitioner who claims to use their self-described intuitive <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> {{the cause of a}} physical or emotional condition. Other terms for such a person include medical clairvoyant, medical psychic or intuitive counselor.|$|R
5000|$|Ambiguity. Because asynchronous, text-mediated online conversations {{lack the}} {{richness}} of interaction and cues that face-to-face interaction provides, online communication tends {{to be much more}} ambiguous. This ambiguity may decrease members' <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> similarities in one another. In both online and offline interactions, increased perceived similarity is associated with increased empathy.|$|R
40|$|The {{contents}} {{of this paper}} discuss plans for communication failure due to lost hardware during Moon and Mars exploration missions. The author proposes a Diagnostics and Power Port (DPP) creation {{in the face of}} total communication failure. DDP would have a number of different power channels to replicate computer diagnostic <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the root cause of failure...|$|R
5|$|Rodin {{restored}} {{an ancient}} role of sculpture– {{to capture the}} physical and intellectual force of the human subject– and he freed sculpture from the repetition of traditional patterns, providing the foundation for greater experimentation in the 20th century. His popularity is ascribed to his emotion-laden representations of ordinary men and women– to his <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the beauty and pathos in the human animal. His most popular works, such as The Kiss and The Thinker, are widely used outside the fine arts as symbols of human emotion and character. To honor Rodin's artistic legacy, the Google search engine homepage displayed a Google Doodle featuring The Thinker to celebrate his 172nd birthday on 12 November 2012.|$|E
5|$|The diet {{consists}} of water-based and terrestrial insects, flying insects, such as {{various types of}} fly, and, to a lesser extent, tiny crustaceans and algae. Field work on Narrabeen Lakes showed that Pacific blue-eyes spent time near the surface looking for dead flying insects, consuming anything below their mouth gape size. This varied from around 2.5 to 3.5mm, and was proportional {{to the length of}} the fish. The Pacific blue-eye forages using vision, and the turbidity of the water affects its <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> food.|$|E
5|$|As Emma, Mary Margaret, and Graham {{search the}} wooded area for John Doe, they {{are joined by}} Henry. Henry {{believes}} that the patient is looking for Mary Margaret. They soon discover the patient lying near the bridge seen in the fairytale flashback, and Mary Margaret revives him. As they take {{him back to the}} hospital, Regina shows up with a woman named Kathryn (Griffith), and states that she is his wife and that the patient's name is David Nolan. This devastates Mary Margaret, as she had begun to develop feelings for the patient. Emma becomes suspicious of Regina's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> Nolan's wife and questions why Kathryn never bothered to search for him before. Although Regina claims that past hospital surveillance tapes had David mentioning Kathryn's name in his sleep, Emma still believes that Regina is lying. Later that evening, Emma arrives at Mary Margaret's place and agrees to take up the offer of staying with the teacher.|$|E
50|$|The larvae of Cephenemyia trompe infect {{the nose}} area of reindeers. The adult is active during the Arctic summer, {{being able to}} fly very fast and having {{developed}} olfactory <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> reindeer from long distances. Its activity, however, is inhibited by strong winds, low temperatures and rain or snow. This species has a very short pupariation time compared to other reindeer botfly species.|$|R
5000|$|Player {{characters}} are called [...] "Retainers". Retainers seek humanity's ancestral planet, the Earth like as E. C. Tubb's Dumarest saga or Isaac Asimov's Foundation and Earth. A name of [...] "retainer" [...] means that he/she retains a qualification and <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> Earth.Retainers' foe are named [...] "Removers". Removers {{are trying to}} remove the memories and presence of Earth and prevent searching for it.|$|R
50|$|Deng Yu (2-58 CE), {{courtesy}} name Zhonghua, was a Han dynasty {{general and}} official {{who was a}} major contributor to Emperor Guangwu (Liu Xiu)'s campaign to reestablish the Han dynasty. He was well known in history for his accomplishments at a young age, but his main strengths might have been his <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> the right people for the right responsibilities, rather than his own personal military might.|$|R
5|$|Marine mammals {{were first}} hunted by {{aboriginal}} peoples {{for food and}} other resources. Many were also the target for commercial industry, leading to {{a sharp decline in}} all populations of exploited species, such as whales and seals. Commercial hunting lead to the extinction of †Steller's sea cow and the †Caribbean monk seal. After commercial hunting ended, some species, such as the gray whale and northern elephant seal, have rebounded in numbers; conversely, other species, such as the North Atlantic right whale, are critically endangered. Other than hunting, marine mammals can be killed as bycatch from fisheries, where they become entangled in fixed netting and drown or starve. Increased ocean traffic causes collisions between fast ocean vessels and large marine mammals. Habitat degradation also threatens marine mammals and their <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> and catch food. Noise pollution, for example, may adversely affect echolocating mammals, and the ongoing effects of global warming degrade arctic environments.|$|E
25|$|The NWSA was {{perceived}} as the main representative of the suffrage movement, partly because of Anthony's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> dramatic ways of bringing suffrage to the nation's attention.|$|E
25|$|It {{was also}} {{realised}} {{that people with}} higher dopamine levels have the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> patterns and meanings when in reality there isn't. This is why scientists have connected high dopamine levels with paranormal belief.|$|E
40|$|The {{explosion}} of digital research data has created exciting opportunities for librarians {{to engage with}} faculty, staff, and students in their research processes. Advances in computing, sensor technologies, and communications are challenging researchers’ <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>find,</b> manage, utilize, visualize, and store data. Three librarians from public Universities will describe practical approaches for developing new services, collaborations, and content to meet these needs. Real-world examples and relevant issues will be posed for group discussion...|$|R
50|$|Zaktan, Thok, and Reidak guard Odina {{against the}} Brotherhood during the Dark Hunter/Brotherhood War. As the Hunters' are {{occupied}} with an unsuccessful Brotherhood attack of Rahkski, Exo-Toa, and Visorak, Zaktan learns from Roodaka the base was initially {{in the possession}} of the Brotherhood. Zaktan investigates the matter and uses his protodite <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> an entire record of the Brotherhood and their Plan. Zaktan vows to use this knowledge to his nefarious ends.|$|R
50|$|After {{killing the}} monster, the Legionnaires realize that Davian is gone. Two {{other people are}} also missing: Charles Derrel, a.k.a. Chan Derron, and the {{extremely}} beautiful woman who accompanied him. (Derron had involuntarily become partnered with the strikingly beautiful woman, Vanya Eloyan, whom he suspects to be a wanted fugitive, a female android known as Luroa.)Jay Kalam orders Giles Habibula to use all of his marginally legal <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> and follow Derron; the Legion forces will in turn follow Giles.|$|R
25|$|Debora Hammond finds {{much of her}} {{inspiration}} in the wilderness, which is reflected in her work on environmental philosophy and ethics. She believes that social justice depends upon our <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> more harmonious ways of living with the natural world.|$|E
25|$|The magical {{goals for}} which the demons can be {{employed}} are typical of those found in grimoires: the practitioner is promised the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> buried treasure, cast love charms, the ability of magical flight, and the secret of invisibility, to list {{a small number of}} examples.|$|E
25|$|Education for {{children}} in institutions was often of a poor standard and {{by the age of}} 15 most children had left school. Many children left institutions with low levels of literacy and numeracy that may have affected their <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> work or meant they could only get low paying jobs. It also affected their ability to further their education.|$|E
50|$|Unwilling to let {{his daughters}} in jail, Abel confesses the murder of Dan. Although they know he's innocent, Nick and Hank use the {{confession}} to make Sarah and Anna reveal that Dominic and Jesse are the killers, as their old tradition would require them {{to take care of}} their children. Meanwhile, Jake returns to his apartment <b>to</b> <b>find</b> Elly, recognizing her as the woman who saved him. She then takes him to a pool and shows her swimming <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> and even when she's different, Jake is surprised. Just then, Dominic and Jesse knock him out and kidnap Elly.|$|R
50|$|Discovering the {{incident}} in the bar, Renard, Hank, Monroe, Rosalee and Juliette head to the bar <b>to</b> <b>find</b> Nick. Renard, Hank and Monroe enter the bar but Nick {{is nowhere to be}} found. Monroe then uses his <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> scent <b>to</b> <b>find</b> Nick's path. While Hank and Monroe look for Nick, Nick has found a house in the woods with a family entering while he stares at the family, seemingly planning on attack them.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1940s, Roberts became {{acquainted with}} Henry Gross, a retired Maine game warden and amateur water dowser. He and Gross began a long {{association}} to use Gross' claimed dowsing <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> deposits of water, petroleum, uranium, and diamonds, through a corporation named Water Unlimited, Inc. Roberts documented {{his experiences in}} three nonfiction books that were popular successes but that received much criticism from the scientific community. Roberts himself joked {{that he should have}} subtitled The Seventh Sense as [...] "Or How to Lose Friends and Alienate People." ...|$|R
25|$|River-class frigates {{were the}} first Royal Canadian Navy {{warships}} to carry the 147B Sword horizontal fan echo sonar transmitter {{in addition to the}} irregular ASDIC. This allowed the ship to maintain contact with targets even while firing unless a target was struck. Improved radar and direction-finding equipment improved the RCN's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> and track enemy submarines over the previous classes.|$|E
25|$|On {{almost all}} DSLRs that offer live preview via the primary sensor, the phase {{detection}} autofocus {{system does not}} work in the live preview mode, and the DSLR switches to a slower contrast system commonly found in point & shoot cameras. While even phase detection autofocus requires contrast in the scene, strict contrast detection autofocus is limited in its <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> focus quickly, though it is somewhat more accurate.|$|E
25|$|Communities of canons {{served the}} poor and the sick {{throughout}} Europe, through both nursing and education. They include the canons of the Great St. Bernard Hospice at Great St. Bernard Pass in the Alps on the border of Switzerland, where they have served travelers since the mid-11th century. This community is the one which developed the familiar breed of St. Bernard to assist the canons in their <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> travelers buried by avalanches. The Congregation of the Great St. Bernard {{is a member of the}} Confederation of the Canons Regular of St. Augustine.|$|E
5000|$|Because Tenzin is only {{a humble}} monk, he {{questions}} his <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> accurately <b>find</b> and recognize the reincarnation of an enlightened master. He is daunted by {{the difficulty of the}} task, for which he alone seems responsible.|$|R
40|$|In today's society, {{there is}} a need for {{organizations}} to have a robust knowledge infrastructure in place, so that they can create or acquire knowledge; store knowledge; disseminate knowledge, and protect and manage their knowledge assets. However, with advances in the publishing media, our <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> generate information has far exceeded our <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>find,</b> review and understand it, thus leading to "Information Overload". Information overload refers to the inability to extract needed knowledge from existing information due to the volume of information, or lack of understanding of information and its whereabouts, or efficient ways to locate relevant information. These issues could be addressed by having efficient Knowledge Management Systems/Knowledge Services, so that people can creat...|$|R
50|$|From deep space, Koenig checks in. Like Alpha, his {{instruments}} {{record no}} cause for the ever-rising temperatures. He gives Tony Verdeschi command authority in his absence (as the ship will soon pass out of communications range). Helena interrupts to plead Michelle's case; all she needs are a few grains of tiranium to complete the heart. Koenig refuses. With the strain placed on life-support by the present emergency, the scarce mineral is more valuable than a single life. Outwardly, Koenig expresses his confidence in Helena and her <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> an alternate solution—inside, he is wracked with guilt.|$|R
25|$|In {{cryptographic}} applications, the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> {{two distinct}} values xμ-1 and xλ+μ-1 mapped by some cryptographic function ƒ {{to the same}} value xμ may indicate a weakness in ƒ. For instance, Quisquater and Delescaille apply cycle detection algorithms {{in the search for}} a message and a pair of Data Encryption Standard keys that map that message to the same encrypted value; Kaliski, Rivest, and Sherman also use cycle detection algorithms to attack DES. The technique may also be used to find a collision in a cryptographic hash function.|$|E
25|$|According to the Home Office, 64 {{per cent}} of Somali {{refugees}} had {{a low level}} of English language skills {{at the time of their}} asylum decision in the UK, which hindered their <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> employment. A further 28 per cent had medium fluency, and 8 per cent had high proficiency in the language. Employment rates also steadily increased over time, with 20 per cent of the refugees in employment 8 months after the asylum decision, 28 per cent in employment after 15 months, and 39 per cent in employment after 21 months.|$|E
25|$|Lead dogs {{steer the}} rest of the team and set the pace. Leaders may be single or double; the latter is more common now, though single leaders used to be more common during the mid-20th century. Sometimes a leader may be unhitched (a loose or free leader) to find the trail for {{the rest of}} the team, but the {{practice}} is uncommon and is not allowed at races. Qualities for a good lead dog are intelligence, initiative, common sense, and the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> a trail in bad conditions.|$|E
40|$|Objective: This study {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether a flipped classroom that facilitated peer learning would improve undergraduate health sciences students’ <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>find,</b> evaluate, and use appropriate evidence for research assignments. Methods: Students completed online modules in a learning management system, with librarians facilitating subsequent student-directed, in-person sessions. Mixed methods assessment was used to evaluate program outcomes. Results: Students learned information literacy concepts but did not consistently apply them in research assignments. Faculty interviews revealed strengthened partnerships between librarians and teaching faculty. Conclusion: This pedagogy shows promise for implementing and evaluating a successful flipped information literacy program...|$|R
5000|$|At {{the start}} of Infinite, set in 1912, Booker DeWitt is sent to Columbia by the Lutece twins to recover Elizabeth, {{claiming}} that they will wipe away his debts with her return. Booker is quickly discovered as the [...] "False Shepherd" [...] that will take the Lamb away, and is set on by Comstock's troops. Booker frees Elizabeth, and both narrowly avoid an attack by Songbird that destroys part of the statue. As Elizabeth accompanies Booker, she discovers that her <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> and manipulate tears has become stronger, and uses that to help Booker fight through Comstock's troops.|$|R
