40|$|Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, {{which was}} {{formerly}} {{classified in the}} genus Haemophilus, is a pathogen causing swine pleuropneumonia. We found that <b>aspoxicillin</b> showed strong activity and that meropenem had better lytic activity against this pathogen. In the present study, we {{for the first time}} identified penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of A. pleuropneumoniae in order to elucidate the relationship between the antibacterial and lytic activities of β-lactam antibiotics and affinities of the PBPs. The competitive assay using 3 H-labeled benzylpenicillin revealed seven PBPs in A. pleuropneumoniae; they were determined to be PBPs 1 a, 1 b, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, and the molecular masses of these PBPs were estimated to be 92, 80, 76, 72, 50, 44, and 30 kDa, respectively, by comparison with those of Haemophilus influenzae. Our detailed analysis of the affinities of the PBPs of A. pleuropneumoniae and of the bacterial lysis kinetics for several β-lactam antibiotics revealed that the strong antibacterial activity of <b>aspoxicillin</b> against this strain could be related to the higher affinity of PBP 3 and that preferential inactivation of PBP 1 b could cause rapid lysis...|$|E
