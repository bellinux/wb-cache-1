Having completed his studies shortly after the outbreak of World War II, he joined the Australian Army Medical Corps, but was soon captured by Japanese forces and imprisoned in the Changi Prison Camp.

Discharge of appropriate organic industrial wastes may be timed to sustain the secondary treatment ecosystem through periods of low residential waste flow. Sewage treatment systems experiencing holiday waste load fluctuations may provide alternative food to sustain secondary treatment ecosystems through periods of reduced use.

25|$|Biochar (charcoal {{created by}} {{pyrolysis}} of biomass) {{is a potent}} form of longterm (thousands of years) biosequestration of atmosphereic CO2 derived from investigation of the extremely fertile Terra preta soils of the Amazon Basin. Placing biochar in soils also improves water quality, increases soil fertility, raises agricultural productivity and reduce pressure on old growth forests. As a method of generating bio-energy with carbon storage Rob Flanagan and the EPRIDA biochar company have developed low-tech cooking stoves for developing nations that can burn <b>agricultural</b> <b>wastes</b> such as rice husks and produce 15% by weight of biochar; while BEST Energies in NSW Australia have spent a decade developing an Agrichar technology that can combust 96 tonnes of dry biomass each day, generating 30-40 tonnes of biochar. A parametric study of biosequestration by Malcolm Fowles at the Open University, indicated that to mitigate global warming, policies should encourage displacement of coal with biomass as a power source for baseload electricity generation if the latter’s conversion efficiency rose over 30%, otherwise biosequestering carbon from biomass as a cheaper mitigation option than geosequestration by CO2 capture and storage.|$|E

In the camp, Woodruff {{realized}} that his fellow prisoners were at great risk from vitamin deficiencies due to the poor quality of the rations they were issued by the Japanese. To help fight this threat, Woodruff asked for permission from the Japanese {{to allow him to}} take responsibility for the matter, which was granted. He devised a method for extracting important nutrients from grass, soya beans, rice polishings, and <b>agricultural</b> <b>wastes</b> using old machinery that he found at the camp. Woodruff later published an account of his methods through the Medical Research Council titled [...] "Deficiency Diseases in Japanese Prison Camps". Woodruff remained a POW for three and a half years and later during this period he was sent to outlying POW camps to treat his comrades. As the prisoners were not allowed to be transferred, he had to improvise in his practise. During this time he also read Maingot's surgery textbook, as a copy was in the camp, and he later said that reading about the fact that skin allografts were rejected a fortnight after being initially accepted, had stoked his interest in doing research on the topic.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. At {{the present}} time the demand for energy, goods and {{materials}} is surging because of advanced technology and population growth. However, the resources on earth are limited. For this reason, the issues concerning using the resources effectively and changing them into energy are important. Taiwan creates {{a vast amount of}} <b>agricultural</b> <b>waste</b> every year. Traditionally, the <b>agricultural</b> <b>waste</b> would be burned and buried. It is not only the fact that we can’t reuse and recycle the <b>agricultural</b> <b>waste,</b> but also the problem of air pollution when they were burned. Therefore, it is necessary to create a solution that can recycle and reuse the <b>agricultural</b> <b>waste,</b> and change them into energy. The <b>agricultural</b> <b>waste</b> is full of wood fiber, and it can be reduced by a microorganism method. This study will use a common <b>agricultural</b> <b>waste</b> which is cane because {{it is one of the}} main agricultural products in Taiwan. The wood fiber in cane will be added to the thermostable cellulolytic bacterial Geobacillus thermoleovorans T 4 which is found from in sugar refinery wastewater found often in Southern Taiwan. The results showed that T 4 can increase the rate of reducing sugar. The reduced sugar can then transform into energy. This method can help to recycle and reuse <b>agricultural</b> <b>waste,</b> and it will decrease environmental pollution...|$|R

40|$|The use of <b>agricultural</b> <b>waste</b> for soil {{amendment}} {{is limited in}} developing countries.

A total of 220 farmers were selected randomly and interviewed using standardised semi-structured questionnaires. Four groups of farmers, namely (i) field crop farmers, (ii) vegetable producers, (iii) ornamental-plant growers, and (iv) farmers practising mixed farming, were identified using categorical principal component and two-step cluster analyses. Field crop farmers produced the largest quantity of <b>agricultural</b> <b>waste,</b> but they allocated 80 % of manure to fuel and 85 % of crop residues to feed. Only < 10 % of manure and crop residues were applied on soils. Farmers also sold manure and crop residues, and this generated 5 – 10 % of their annual income. Vegetable and ornamental-plant growers allocated over 40 % of manure and crop residues to soil amendment. Hence, nutrient balances were less negative in vegetable production systems. Education, farm size, land tenure and access to extension services were the variables that impeded allocation of <b>agricultural</b> <b>waste</b> to soil amendment. Replacement of fuel and feed through sustainable means is a viable option for soil fertility management. Urban waste compost should also be used as alternative option for soil amendment. Our results showed variation in compost demand between farmers. Education, landownership, experience with compost and access to extension services explained variation in compost demand. We also demonstrated that labour availability should be used to estimate compost demand beside cash...|$|R
40|$|<b>Agricultural</b> <b>waste</b> burning is {{performed}} after harvest periods in June and November in Taiwan typically, farmers use open burning {{to dispose of}} excess rice straw. PM(2. 5) and PM(2. 5 - 10) measurements were conducted at National Chung Hsing University in Taichung City using a dichotomous sampler. The sampling times were during straw burning periods after rice harvest during 2002 - 2005. Ionic species including SO(4) (2 -), NO(3) (-), NH(4) (+). K(+), Ca(2) (+), Cl(-) and Na(+) and carbonaceous species (EC and OC) in PM(2. 5) and PM(2. 5 - 10) were analyzed. The {{results showed that the}} average PM(2. 5) and PM 2. 5 - 10 concentrations were 123. 6 and 31. 5 mu g m(- 3) during <b>agricultural</b> <b>waste</b> burning periods and 32. 6 and 21. 4 mu g m(- 3) during non-waste burning periods, respectively. The fine aerosol ionic species including Cl(-), K(+) and NO(3) (-) increased 11. 0, 6. 7 and 5. 5 times during agricultural burning periods compared with periods when <b>agricultural</b> <b>waste</b> burning is not performed.
