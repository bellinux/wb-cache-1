5|$|Starlings' {{droppings}} {{can contain}} the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum, {{the cause of}} histoplasmosis in humans. At roosting sites this fungus can thrive in accumulated droppings.

5|$|There <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> {{methods to}} reduce {{mosquito}} bites and slow {{the spread of}} malaria. Efforts to decrease mosquito larva by decreasing the availability of open water in which they develop or by adding substances to decrease their development is effective in some locations.

5|$|Lactarius subdulcis has a mild {{taste with}} a {{slightly}} bitter after-taste. Though considered edible after cooking, it is not recommended, as it has a taste reminiscent of ivy. There <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> mushrooms that appear {{at the same time}} and in the same areas as L.subdulcis that are preferable to it, including L.mitissimus, meaning that L.subdulcis is not particularly useful as a foodstuff. The milk is one of distinguishing features, having a sweet taste that turns bitter in the mouth, with L.subdulcis being considered a sweet milk mushroom.|$|E
5|$|The Allied bombing {{campaign}} {{was one of}} the main factors which influenced the Japanese government's decision to surrender in mid-August 1945. However, there has been a long-running debate over the morality of the attacks on Japanese cities, and the use of atomic weapons is particularly controversial. The most commonly cited estimate of Japanese casualties from the raids is 333,000 killed and 473,000 wounded. There <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> estimates of total fatalities, however, which range from 241,000 to 900,000. In addition to the loss of mostly civilian life, the raids contributed to a large decline in industrial production.|$|E
5|$|There {{are large}} areas of {{agricultural}} land in the middle reaches of the watershed of Little Catawissa Creek, {{but most of the}} agricultural operations in the watershed are relatively small. The main areas of residential development in the watershed are the communities of Aristes and Ringtown. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection has issued four mining permits in the watershed of the creek. All of these permits are for mining on a ridge on the northern edge of the watershed. There <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> land uses in the creek's watershed. These include private forests and rural residences.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{this work}} we propose an {{approach}} to prioritizing order of transmission of sensed data in wireless sensor network that are very popular in, for example, environmental monitoring. The approach is based on determination of a consensus relation which is in "nearest distance " from all initial rankings shaped by multiple sensors of each network node. Statistically and probabilistically based analytical models useful for assuring network performance and providing reasonable number values n – k and m are proposed and discussed, where n – k <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> packets transmitted to the sink; n <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> the network sensor nodes; k <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> dropped packets due to a congestion; and m <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> node sensors (or rankings) ...|$|R
