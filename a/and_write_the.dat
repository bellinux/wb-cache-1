5|$|Disney {{announced}} their intentions to develop The Incredibles 2 in March 2014. Bird returned to direct <b>and</b> <b>write</b> <b>the</b> screenplay. Nelson, Hunter, Vowell, Jackson, and Bird will also return {{to voice their}} characters, while Dash will now be voiced by Huck Milner as Fox's voice had deepened in the intervening years. The film will follow immediately {{from the end of}} The Incredibles with the Parrs facing the Underminer. The film will focus on Holly Hunter's character, Elastigirl. Originally, The Incredibles 2 was to be released on June 21, 2019 as Pixar's next film after Toy Story 4. Due to delays on that title, Pixar swapped the releases, and currently The Incredibles 2 is set for release on June 15, 2018.|$|E
5|$|Interest in {{producing}} an English-language version of Let the Right One In began in 2007 shortly {{before it was}} released to audiences. In 2008, Hammer Films acquired the rights for the English adaptation and initially offered Tomas Alfredson, {{the director of the}} Swedish film, the opportunity to direct, which he declined. Reeves was then signed to direct <b>and</b> <b>write</b> <b>the</b> screenplay. Reeves made several changes for the English version such as altering the setting from Stockholm to New Mexico and renaming the lead characters. The film's producers stated that their intent was to keep the plot similar to the original, yet make it more accessible to a wider audience. Principal photography began in early November 2009, and concluded in January 2010. The film's budget was estimated to be $20 million.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 18th century, the British Empire had {{facilitated}} {{the spread of}} English through its colonies and geopolitical dominance. Commerce, science and technology, diplomacy, art, and formal education all contributed to English becoming the first truly global language. English also facilitated worldwide international communication. As England continued to form new colonies, these in turn became independent and developed their own norms for how to speak <b>and</b> <b>write</b> <b>the</b> language. English was adopted in North America, India, parts of Africa, Australasia, and many other regions. In the post-colonial period, some of the newly created nations that had multiple indigenous languages opted to continue using English as the official language to avoid the political difficulties inherent in promoting any one indigenous language above the others. In the 20th century the growing economic and cultural influence of the United States and {{its status as a}} superpower following the Second World War has, along with worldwide broadcasting in English by the BBC and other broadcasters, significantly accelerated the spread of the language across the planet. By the 21st century, English was more widely spoken and written than any language has ever been.|$|E
5|$|Milford Haven {{is located}} within the {{geographical}} and historic area known as Little England Beyond Wales, which has predominately used English for many centuries. Although {{it is the most}} westerly point of the country and the part of the county furthest from the English border, a relatively small proportion of the community knows the Welsh language. In the 2011 census, only 7.5% of residents in the Milford Central ward claimed that they could speak, read <b>and</b> <b>write</b> <b>the</b> language, in contrast to the Pembrokeshire county as a whole where roughly 18% of the population are able to read, write and speak Welsh, while in the neighbouring county of Carmarthenshire around 40% of people express a similar level of fluency in Welsh. Local disconnection from the Welsh language was highlighted in November 2008, when Milford Haven Town Council unsuccessfully demanded the right to opt out of a scheme in which official documents had to be translated into Welsh if requested; the council was allegedly one of about 10 that opposed having to make such translations.|$|E

25|$|According to a Vatican spokesman, Benedict {{spent his}} first day as pope emeritus with Archbishop Georg Gänswein, the Prefect of the Papal Household.

25|$|Enslaved African Americans had not {{waited for}} Lincoln before {{escaping}} and seeking freedom behind Union lines. From {{early years of}} the war, hundreds of thousands of African Americans escaped to Union lines, especially in Union-controlled areas such as Norfolk and the Hampton Roads region in 1862 Virginia, Tennessee from 1862 on, the line of Sherman's march, etc. So many African Americans fled to Union lines that commanders created camps and schools for them, where both adults and children learned to read <b>and</b> <b>write.</b> <b>The</b> American Missionary Association entered the war effort by sending teachers south to such contraband camps, for instance, establishing schools in Norfolk and on nearby plantations.|$|E
25|$|Nixon {{resigned}} from office on August 9, 1974.

Then, with his family at his side, Nixon gave an emotional farewell talk in the East Room to an assembly of White House staff and Cabinet officials.

25|$|Polanski {{returned}} to the United States, and was contracted {{by the head of}} Paramount Pictures, Robert Evans, to direct <b>and</b> <b>write</b> <b>the</b> screenplay for Rosemary's Baby, which was based on Ira Levin's novel of the same name. Polanski later admitted that he had wanted Tate to star in the film and had hoped that someone would suggest her, as he felt it inappropriate to make the suggestion himself. The producers did not suggest Tate, and Mia Farrow was cast. Tate reportedly provided ideas for some of the key scenes, including the scene in which the protagonist, Rosemary, is impregnated. A frequent visitor to the set, she was photographed there by Esquire and the resulting photographs generated considerable publicity for both Tate and the film.|$|E
25|$|Under this assumption, one may {{omit the}} first row <b>and</b> <b>write</b> <b>the</b> {{permutation}} in one-line notation as , that is, an ordered arrangement of S. Care {{must be taken to}} distinguish one-line notation from the cycle notation described later. In mathematics literature, a common usage is to omit parentheses for one-line notation, while using them for cycle notation. The one-line notation is also called the word representation of a permutation. The example above would then be 2 5 4 3 1 since the natural order 1 2 3 4 5 would be assumed for {{the first row}}. (It is typical to use commas to separate these entries only if some have two or more digits.) This form is more compact, and is common in elementary combinatorics and computer science. It is especially useful in applications where the elements of S or the permutations are to be compared as larger or smaller.|$|E
25|$|Disney {{had once}} {{announced}} that 2004's Home on the Range {{would be their}} last traditionally animated film. After the company's acquisition of Pixar in early 2006, Ed Catmull and John Lasseter, the new president and chief creative officer of Disney Animation Studios, reversed this decision and reinstated hand-drawn animation at the studio. Many animators who had either been laid off or had left the studio when the traditional animation units were dissolved in 2003 were located and re-hired for the project. Lasseter also brought back directors Ron Clements and John Musker, whose earlier works include The Great Mouse Detective (1986), The Little Mermaid (1989), Aladdin (1992), Hercules (1997), and Treasure Planet (2002). The duo had left the company in 2005, but Lasseter requested their return to Disney to direct <b>and</b> <b>write</b> <b>the</b> film and had let them choose the style of animation (traditional or CGI) they wanted to use.|$|E
