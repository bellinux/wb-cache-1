25|$|In rural areas, the {{provision}} of water services is usually the responsibility of community organizations (Juntas de Agua). While the infrastructure is funded primarily by transfers from the national governments, typically community labor and sometimes cash contributions are mobilized. When communities are associated {{in the choice of}} service level and other key choices, this instills <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> that makes it more likely that communities will maintain the infrastructure.|$|E
25|$|Another {{approach}} {{to understanding the}} neuroscientific underpinnings {{of the sense of}} agency is to examine clinical conditions in which purposeful limb movement occurs without an associated sense of agency. The most clear clinical demonstration of this situation is alien hand syndrome. In this condition, associated with specific forms of brain damage, the affected individual loses the sense of agency without losing <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> of the affected body part.|$|E
25|$|Many housing {{initiatives}} involve {{homeless people}} {{in the process of}} building and maintaining affordable shared housing. This process works as a double impact by not only providing housing but also giving homeless people employment income and work experience. One example of this type of initiative is the nonprofit organization Living Solutions, which is located in downtown San Diego, CA. This community initiative provides the homeless population with a source of housing as well as giving them jobs building affordable homes. The initiative also builds community empowerment by asking formerly homeless residents to help to maintain and repair these homes. Residents are responsible for all household duties, including menu planning, budgeting, shopping, cooking, cleaning, yard work, and home maintenance. The environment of responsibility over a living space fosters <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> as well as involvement {{in all parts of the}} decision-making process.|$|E

500|$|Like many African American {{grass roots}} organizations, Jarrell's gallery group {{struggled}} {{to carry the}} torch after the deaths of MartinLutherKing,Jr. and MalcolmX. Jarrell and his fellow Chicago artists took the path of non-violence by way of their artistic talents and <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> through their contributions at WJStudio and Gallery. With these ideals backing them and their new aesthetic philosophy, the group took on the name COBRA â€“ Coalition of Black Revolutionary Artists. With the creation of COBRA, Jarrell completed his first work that conceptualized the concept behind the group, Black Family (1969), which utilized the color scheme of the coolade colors such as light blue and orange contrasting with white areas, which heightened the bright colors' intensity. This technique allowed Jarrell to create {{what he described as}} an [...] "intuitive space," [...] drawing the viewer's attention towards the family on the canvas: a caring mother, protective father and two relaxed children. With a father depicting strength and honesty, and what Robert Douglas describes as a [...] "heroic quality," [...] to the painting, Jarrell expresses important aspects of the COBRA ideal. Writing also appears on the canvas, with the word [...] "blackness" [...] represented by the letter B. The group decided to go from focusing on themed exhibitions to encouraging artworks that [...] "portray the general problems of black people or attempt to visualize some solutions to them." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{sense of}} agency (SA), or sense of control, is the {{subjective}} awareness of initiating, executing, and controlling one's own volitional {{actions in the}} world. It is the pre-reflective awareness or implicit sense that it is I who is executing bodily movement(s) or thinking thoughts. In normal, non-pathological experience, the SA is tightly integrated with one's [...] "sense of ownership" [...] (SO), which is the pre-reflective awareness or implicit sense that one {{is the owner of}} an action, movement or thought. If someone else were to move your arm (while you remained passive) you would certainly have sensed that it were your arm that moved and thus <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> (SO) for that movement.

The primary logo consists of a typical red barn outlined in black with a curving baseball. Unlike most sports logos, the geographical location is prominently featured rather than the team nickname. Team management decided to emphasize the Lancaster community so that the whole county could feel <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> and pride. In 2011, the Barnstormers substituted black for navy blue and unveiled three agriculture-themed alternate logos: a hex sign, a weather vane, and the barn-planked [...] "LB" [...] initials.

2500|$|The {{activities}} of 1 ACAU {{were based on}} principles calculated to achieve maximum impact on the civilian population, while bearing {{in mind that the}} primary aim of civic action was to win the support of the local population for the Saigon regime. Firstly, the local population had to [...] "own" [...] the project. If they felt <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership,</b> and the project was subsequently damaged or destroyed by the Viet Cong, then the outcome would be antagonism towards them. Ownership involved encouraging the local population to suggest or otherwise originate projects, and to actively participate in their construction, either wholly or partly. Secondly, the projects had to extend over a reasonable period of time to allow the participating soldiers to become known and trusted by the villagers. Thirdly, they were initiated {{in the name of the}} appropriate South Vietnamese ministry, for example education and health. Fourthly, it was desirable that the projects lent themselves to publicity. Fifthly, the results had to be observable, measurable and tangible, and ideally impact beneficially on as many people as possible. Lastly, wherever possible, credit was always given to the South Vietnamese government (even if in reality it was quite obvious to the villagers that it was Australia and Australians providing the project).|$|E
2500|$|Some terms {{have been}} {{proposed}} regarding dissociation. [...] Psychiatrist Paulette Gillig draws a distinction between an [...] "ego state" [...] (behaviors and experiences [...] possessing permeable boundaries with other such states but united by a common sense of self) and the term [...] "alters" [...] (each of which may have a separate autobiographical memory, independent initiative and <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> over individual behavior) commonly used in discussions of DID. [...] Ellert Nijenhuis and colleagues suggest a distinction between personalities responsible for day-to-day functioning (associated with blunted physiological responses and reduced emotional reactivity, {{referred to as the}} [...] "apparently normal part of the personality" [...] or ANP) and those emerging in survival situations (involving fight-or-flight responses, vivid traumatic memories and strong, painful emotions, the [...] "emotional part of the personality" [...] or EP). [...] "Structural dissociation of the personality" [...] is used by Otto van der Hart and colleagues to distinguish dissociation they attribute to traumatic or pathological causes, which in turn is divided into primary, secondary and tertiary dissociation. [...] According to this hypothesis, primary dissociation involves one ANP and one EP, while secondary dissociation involves one ANP and at least two EPs and tertiary dissociation, which is unique to DID, is described as having at least two ANP and at least two EP. [...] Others have suggested dissociation can be separated into two distinct forms, detachment and compartmentalization, the latter of which, involving a failure to control normally controllable processes or actions, is most evident in DID. [...] Efforts to psychometrically distinguish between normal and pathological dissociation have been made, but they have not been universally accepted.|$|E
2500|$|In {{regard to}} being {{asked if she}} is putting on a geeky and gaming persona for the cameras, Hex {{explains}} that it [...] "would be so impossible to manufacture a whole persona" [...] across all the different platforms that she uses to interact with people. Hex said the capture and logging is the most challenging part of the job, {{but it is also}} unique as if she is referencing a particular part of the game, she can show her own personal experience rather than rolling stock footage. Bajo says this is also for editorial reasons in that, [...] "We need to defend our point by showing the footage to satisfy the ABC's charter." [...] Bajo notes that in the show's early days, there were some intense forum flames over things like missing a detail out, or not agreeing with the general consensus among viewers. He also says {{that if there is a}} genre of games that he and Hex don't like or aren't very good at, such as sports games, they won't ignore it and will try to be as honest as possible with their reviews. Bajo says that as people invest so many hours into a game, it is justified to feel <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> over it and feel defensive if someone doesn't feel the same way. For this reason he loves [...] "getting to the bottom of" [...] why certain games are liked by some and disliked by others. Bajo says you can't speak with conviction if you haven't done something, especially [...] " [...] something as involving as games". Bajo explains [...] " [...] the odd publisher/developer who wasn't happy with our review [...] we try to be fair, honest, and listen to all feedback we get to make sure we're not ever crossing any lines." ...|$|E

He had not much of that faculty to be sure, but there was in it the force of concentration.

I have a notion that no usual, normal father is pleased at parting with his daughter. No. Not even when he rationally appreciates [...] "Jane being taken off his hands" [...] or perhaps is able to exult at an excellent match.

They were not very far from Central Park, and they went for whole afternoons into it. They came to have such <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>ownership</b> {{in one of the}} seats in the Ramble, that they felt aggrieved when they found anybody had taken it, and they resented other people's {{intimacy}} with the squirrels, which Louise always took a pocketful of nuts to feed; the squirrels got a habit of climbing into her lap for them. Sometimes Maxwell hired a boat and rowed her lazily about on the lake, while he mused and she talked. Sometimes, to be very lavish, they took places in the public carriage which plied on the drives of the Park, and went up to the tennis-grounds beyond the reservoirs, and watched the players, or the art-students sketching the autumn scenery there. They began to know, without acquaintance, certain attached or semi-attached couples; and no doubt they passed with these for lovers themselves, though they felt a vast superiority to them in virtue of their married experience; they looked upon them, though the people were sometimes their elders, as very young things, who were in the right way, but were as yet deplorably ignorant how happy they were going to be. They almost always walked back from these drives, and it was not so far but they could walk over to the North River for the sunset before their dinner, which they had late when they did that, and earlier when they did not do it. Dinner was rather a matter of caprice with them. Sometimes they dined at a French or Italian table d'hÃ´te; sometimes they foraged for it before they came in from their sunset, or their afternoon in the park. When dinner consisted mainly of a steak or chops, with one of the delicious salads their avenue abounded in, and some improvisation of potatoes, and coffee afterward, it was very easy to get it up in half an hour. They kept one maid, who called herself a Sweden's girl, and Louise cooked some of the things herself. She did not cook them so well as the maid, but Maxwell never knew what he was eating, and he thought it all alike good.|$|E
