25|$|Si–C {{bonds are}} {{commonly}} formed in three ways. In the laboratory, preparation is often {{carried out in}} small quantities by reacting tetrachlorosilane with organolithium, Grignard, or organoaluminium reagents, or by catalytic addition of Si–H across C=C double bonds. The second route has the drawback of not being applicable to the most important silanes, the methyl and phenyl silanes. Organosilanes are made industrially by directly reacting alkyl or aryl halides with silicon with 10% by weight metallic copper as a catalyst. Standard organic reactions suffice to produce many derivatives; the resulting organosilanes are often significantly more reactive than their carbon congeners, readily undergoing hydrolysis, <b>ammonolysis,</b> alcoholysis, and condensation to form cyclic oligomers or linear polymers.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ammonolysis</b> {{refers to}} {{solvolysis}} by ammonia {{but can also}} describe nucleophilic attack by ammonia more generally. Ammonia boils at −33°C and so it rarely used as a solvent in its pure form, it is however readily miscible with water and is commonly used {{in the form of}} a saturated aqueous solution. For this reason <b>ammonolysis</b> may be considered a special case of solvolysis, as the ammonia is itself dissolved in a solvent. Despite this the reactions are usually highly selective, due to the greater nucleophilicity of ammonia compared to water.|$|E

50|$|The {{synthesis}} of polyorganosilazanes was first described in 1964 by Krüger and Rochow. By reacting ammonia with chlorosilanes (<b>ammonolysis),</b> trimeric or tetrameric cyclosilazanes were formed initially and further reacted at high temperatures with a catalyst to yield higher molecular weight polymers. <b>Ammonolysis</b> of chlorosilanes still represents {{the most important}} synthetic pathway to polysilazanes. The industrial manufacture of chlorosilanes using the Müller-Rochow process, first reported in the 1940s, served as the cornerstone {{for the development of}} silazane chemistry. In the 1960s, the first attempts to transform organosilicon polymers into quasi-ceramic materials were described. At this time, suitable (“pre-ceramic”) polymers heated to 1000°C or higher were shown to split off organic groups and hydrogen and, in the process, the molecular network is rearranged to form amorphous inorganic materials that show both unique chemical and physical properties. Using polymer derived ceramics (PDCs), new application areas can be opened, especially in the area of high performance materials. The most important pre-ceramic polymers are polysilanes R^1R^2Si-R^1R^2Si_\mathit{n}, polycarbosilanes R^1R^2Si-CH2_\mathit{n}, polysiloxanes R^1R^2Si-O_\mathit{n} and polysilazanes R^1R^2Si-NR^3_\mathit{n}.|$|E
50|$|After the synthesis, {{an aging}} process {{frequently}} {{takes place in}} which dissolved ammonia plays an important role. The R3Si-NH2 groups resulting from the <b>ammonolysis</b> reaction form silazane units by splitting off ammonia. If ammonia can not escape, the silazane units can be split again into R3Si-NH2 groups. Therefore, frequent venting of ammonia can {{lead to an increase}} in molecular mass. Also, functional groups that are not bound directly into the polymer backbone can react under suitable conditions (for example Si-H with N-H groups) and increase crosslinking of the rings and chains. An increase in molecular weight can also be observed during storage at higher temperatures or in sunlight.|$|E
40|$|Immobilised lipase B (Candida {{antarctica}} lipase B) is, perhaps unexpectedly, catalytically {{active in}} liquid ammonia and exhibits chain length selectivity in the <b>ammonolysis</b> of triglycerides. Using glycerol triacetate as the substrate, the <b>ammonolysis</b> {{of only the}} first ester linkage is catalysed by the enzyme, whereas for glycerol tributyrate, the cleavage of all three ester groups is catalysed and converted to the corresponding amide. These observations represent the first example {{of the use of}} enzymes in pure liquid ammonia, exemplifying both catalysis and selectivity. Glycerol trioleate is relatively stable in liquid ammonia but, with Candida antarctica lipase B present, readily undergoes <b>ammonolysis</b> to give oleamide and glycerol even at 25 °C. There is no enzyme-catalysed <b>ammonolysis</b> with the native lipase as it is insoluble in liquid ammonia. The solvolysis of triglycerides in liquid ammonia occurs by a stepwise conversion of the triester to diester to monoester to glycerol with one equivalent of carboxylic acid amide produced at each stage.

During the direct conversion of chromium first -CrN was formed above 385 degrees C, above 567 degrees C additionally -Cr 2 N was detected. Finally, a complete conversion of -CrN to -Cr 2 N {{was observed at}} 1080 degrees C. The <b>ammonolysis</b> of chromium(III) compounds (CrCl 3 and Cr 2 S 3) revealed a so far in 3 d metal nitride synthesis unprecedented redox sequence: The compounds are reduced to chromium(II) chloride CrCl 2 and chromium(II, III) sulfide Cr 3 S 4, respectively, prior to the reoxidation of those intermediates to -CrN. In contrast to the <b>ammonolysis</b> of 3 d metal(II) halides, for chromium(III) chloride no temporary formation of ammoniates was observed. Since formation of -CrN was detected only after annealing chromium(III) sulfide in flowing ammonia for 4 h to 5 h at maximum temperature, the formation of sufficient amounts of chromium(II, III) sulfide as the rate-determining step for the nitride formation appears likely...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The use of enzymes {{in organic}} {{solvents}} {{has acquired a}} special relevance in organic synthesis, and lipases are the enzymes most commonly used in transesterication reactions. In {{the past few years}}, we have shown the utility of enzymatic aminolysis and <b>ammonolysis</b> reactions for the preparation of amides and for the resolution of esters and amines. The enzymatic alkoxycarbonylation reaction is of great utility in chemoselective reactions of natural products. Lipases, enzymes much less exploited in organic synthesis, have an increasing interest, especially the use of (R) -oxynitrilases for the synthesis of optically active cyanohydrins. Over the past few years our group has been working on the use of aminolysis and <b>ammonolysis</b> reactions for the synthesis of high value added products. We have studied the preparation of amides from α,β-unsaturated esters, β-hydroxyesters or β-ketoesters with excellent results, thus achieving a very simple way of chemoselectively preparing different types of amides. If racemic amines are used, the corresponding amides are prepared in very high enantiomeric excesses.

40|$|The <b>ammonolysis</b> of beta-Ga(2) O(3) to alpha-GaN and the {{oxidation}} of alpha-GaN to beta-Ga(2) O(3) {{have been}} studied by means of in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In situ X-ray absorption measurements on polycrystalline powder particles on the gallium K-edge during both reactions give detailed information about the reaction kinetics. We were able to extract this kinetics by fitting linear combinations of beta-Ga(2) O(3) and alpha-GaN spectra only. The kinetics of the <b>ammonolysis</b> can be described well by an extended Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorow model, while the oxidation kinetics can be modelled by a shrinking core model.

The changes in the surface properties of the functionalised materials were studied using nitrogen (77 K) and carbon dioxide (198 K) sorption. 	The p-XRD pattern confirmed that the hexagonal periodicity of the parent MCM 41 materials was maintained upon functionalisation, provided the <b>ammonolysis</b> temperature did not exceed 873 K. Samples ammonolysed at a temperature of 973 K showed a collapse of the hexagonal structure. CHN microanalysis data confirmed the presence of nitrogen in the ammonolysed samples, whereas, the presence of adsorbed NH 4 + and NH/NH 2 species were confirmed by IR spectroscopy. The formation of TiN species was confirmed by XPS analysis. 	The mesoporosity of the Ti-MCM 41 and TiN-MCM 41 samples was confirmed by the Type IV isotherms observed for nitrogen sorption (77 K). <b>Ammonolysis</b> was found to reduce the surface area and pore volume of the materials and this was more marked in the post-synthetically grafted sample. A significant decrease in the surface area (330 m 2 g- 1) and pore volume (0. 24 cm 3 g- 1), and a slight increase in the average pore diameter (23 to 26 Å) suggests sintering of titanium during <b>ammonolysis</b> in the post-synthetically grafted TiN-MCM 41 material. The smaller values of the CO 2 monolayer capacity compared with the nitrogen confirms that the sorption of CO 2 is localised i. e. on the polar surface sites of the ammonolysed samples.
