30|$|The six α-amino acids {{investigated}} {{in this work}} were Sigma-Aldrich products. Solutions were prepared by weighing, and the purity, determined by <b>alkalimetry,</b> resulted {{to be better than}} 99  %. Tetramethylammonium chloride was purified as recommended by Perrin (Perrin et al. 1966). HCl, NaOH and (CH 3) 4 NOH aqueous solutions were prepared by diluting concentrated Fluka ampoules. NaOH and (CH 3) 4 NOH aqueous solutions were checked against potassium phthalate, HCl aqueous solutions were standardized against sodium carbonate. Sodium chloride aqueous solutions were prepared by weighing pure salt (Fluka, p.a.), pre-dried in an oven at 408  K. Analytical grade water (R =  18  MΩ cm) and grade A glassware were used to prepare all the solutions.|$|E
40|$|This study {{reports the}} {{synthesis}} of carbon materials (carbon nanotubes (CNTs), coiled carbon nanofibers (CCNFs) and carbon spheres (CSs)) using the chemical vapour deposition (CVD) method. The as-synthesized carbon materials were functionalized using nitric acid in order to introduce functional groups and improve the hydrophilic behavior of the carbon materials. Both the as-synthesized and functionalized carbon materials were characterized by TEM, TGA, Raman and FTIR spectroscopy. The presence of functional groups was confirmed by <b>alkalimetry</b> titration and IR spectroscopy data. Ceria (synthesized using the sol-gel method), activated carbon (AC) and titania (P 25) were other catalysts supports used and their morphologies were determined by TEM. Platinum was deposited on the various supports to give Pt loadings of 0. 5, 1 and 5...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Dithiocarbamate chitosan, an {{insoluble}} derivative {{obtained from}} carbon disulfide, and N-(o—carboxybenzyl) chitosan and N—car— boxymethyl chitosan, two water—soluble olyamoholytes obtained from phthalaldehydic acid and glyoxylic acid, {{can be used}} for removal of metal ions from dilute solutions. Their characteristic properties are described in terms of infrared, ultraviolet and circular dichroism spectrometry, <b>alkalimetry,</b> metal ion collection percentage and metal ion capacity. The new polyampholytes form insoluble chelates upon addition of their solutions to metal ion solutions. INTRODUCT ION The chelating ability of chitosan for transition metal ions (Ref. 1 — 3) can be enhanced by reacting the amino groups of this biopolymer with suitable chemicals (Ref. 4). Va-rious chemical derivatives of chitosan have thus far been prepared: in this lecture, we shall devote our attention to three derivatives recently prepared in our laboratory (Ref. 5 — 8) which appear to represent significant advances in the field of the selectiv...|$|E
40|$|The full quaternisation of DEAE-dextran was {{successfully}} attempted and {{an application of}} the quaternised product was suggested. Commercial DEAE-dextran was reacted with iodomethane at 60 °C {{in the presence of}} NaOH. The raw product was purified by dialysis, during which the iodide ion was replaced by chloride. N-methylation and O-methylation resulted from the 1 H NMR spectrum. A second methylation step produced no further changes in the molecule. <b>Alkalimetry</b> indicated the absence of amino groups in the methylated polymer molecule, thus testifying to a complete quaternisation. N-acetylcysteine (AcCy) was neutralised with the polymer in the hydroxide form, thus obtaining the methyl DEAE-dextran salt of AcCy (Me-DEAE-dextran/AcCy), whereby an ophthalmic formulation for the treatment of the Dry Eye Syndrome was prepared. For comparison, the neutral AcCy salt of commercial DEAE-dextran (DEAE-dextran/AcCy) was prepared. The AcCy content in Me-DEAE-dextran/AcCy was higher than in DEAE-dextran/AcCy (23 vs 13 %), while the viscosity of a solution containing the salt concentration corresponding to the therapeutic AcCy concentration (4 % w/v) was lower with the former compared to the latter salt (20. 5 vs 23. 9 mPa s). Both solutions were ipotonic (245 mOsm/kg) and nonirritant in rabbit eyes, whereas the commercial Tirocular is strongly hypertonic (900 mOsm/kg) and irritant...|$|E
40|$|In routine {{experiments}} synthetic {{indicators are}} {{the choice of}} acid base titrations. But there are some limitations like environmental pollution, availability and higher cost which leads to search for natural compounds as an acid base indicator was started. The present work highlights theexploit of the methanolic and aqueous extract of the fruit of Opuntia ficus indica plants as a natural acid base indicator in acid base titrations. Opuntia ficus indica plant was identified and fruits were washed and cleaned by distilled water, grinded by a mechanical blender and soaked in 50 ml methanol for 48 hours and then triturated in mortal and pestle and the resulting solution were filtered through muslin cloth. The resulted methanolic extract and aqueous extract which was prepared by heating fruits in water {{for half an hour}} and filtered used as natural indicator foracidimetry and <b>alkalimetry.</b> For each type of acid base titrations t-value and standard deviation were calculated from results obtained. Natural indicator is easy to prepare, easily available and have no toxic effects and promising results were obtained when it was tested against standard synthetic indicators. Titration shows sharp colour change at the equivalence point. The equivalence points (end points) obtained by the fruit extract correlate with the equivalence points obtained by standard indicators. In strong acid and strong base titration, the results obtained in the fruit's extract matched with the results obtained by standard indicator. Hence, natural indicator is found to be a very useful, readily available, nonhazardous, economical, simple to prepare and accurate for the acid-base titrations...|$|E
40|$|The {{issue of}} {{incomplete}} release of poorly soluble drugs from sustained-release oral formulations is addressed using prednisolone (PDS) {{as the model}} drug and a novel highly swelling hydrogel as the rate-controlling material. The hydrogel was formed by heating N-carboxymethylchitosan (CMC) to 80 °C for 24 h. Swelling, <b>alkalimetry,</b> FTIR, DSC, and solid-state NMR studies showed that the treatment produced physical crosslinking, i. e., polymer chain entanglement. A controlled-release system was prepared by coating an inert compacted support of ethylcellulose (50 mg; diameter, 6 mm) with a CMC layer containing dispersed PDS powder (10 - 50 μm). The system was heated to crosslink the CMC coating, then drug release to simulated GI fluids was studied in vitro. The drug release pattern and term were modulated via the layer mass (LM) (10 or 14 mg cm- 2) and/or the drug-polymer wt ratio (D/P) (1 : 5 or 2 : 5). The rate parameter, K, and the time exponent, n, of the Peppas equation were: K = 26. 6 ± 0. 3 h-n, n = 0. 78 ± 0. 02 (LM, 10 mg cm- 2; D/P, 1 : 5); K = 24. 7 ± 0. 7 h-n, n = 0. 56 ± 0. 02 (LM, 14 mg cm- 2; D/P, 1 : 5); K = 20. 7 ± 0. 3 h-n, n = 0. 76 ± 0. 01 (LM, 10 mg cm- 2; D/P, 2 : 5). Hydrogel swelling was faster than drug release. This was controlled, in a first stage, by drug dissolution-diffusion in the swollen gel, and subsequently, by diffusion. The drug release rate was unaffected by the GI pH variations, and slightly affected by the environmental hydrodynamics. The system promises an extended and complete release of poorly soluble drugs in the GI tract...|$|E
40|$|Metallacrown and {{polynuclear}} complexes of nickel, zinc and manganese {{were prepared}} and characterized. The nickel compounds have a mixed ligand composition with salicylhydroxamic acid and di- 2 -pyridyl-ketonoxime as chelate agents. In the trinuclear compound Ni 3 (shi) 2 (Hpko) 2 (py) 2 (1), two metal ions show a square planar geometry while {{the third one}} is in an octahedral environment. The tetranuclear vacant metallacrown [12 -MCNi(II) N(Hshi) 2 (pko) 2 - 4][X] 2 (2) shows the connectivity pattern [-ONi- O-N-Ni-N-] 2, while the compound [Ni(II) 4 (CH 3 OH) 2 (pko) 6](OH) (ClO 4) (3) characterized as metallacrowns with a [Ni-N-O-]n linkage {{and is the only}} example with three strands Ni-O-N-Ni bridging the nickel atoms. Magnetic variable temperature susceptibility study revealed the presence of one paramagnetic nickel(II) ion for the trinuclear compound, two independent nickel(II) ions for (2), while the values for (3) suggest the presence of both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions. The effect of the synthesized Ni(II) complexes on the integrity and electrophoretic mobility of nucleic acids showed that only compound (2) altered the mobility of pDNA, forming high molecular weight concatamers at low concentrations or precipitates at higher concentrations The tetranuclear zinc molecules have an inverse 12 -metallacrown- 4 topology. Two triply bridging hydroxides are accommodated {{in the center of the}} metallacrown ring. The five Zn ions of the pentanuclear cations are held together by six pko- ligands which adopt three different coordination modes. The interconvertion of the mononuclear zinc compound Zn(Hpko) Cl 2 to the tetranuclear (OH) 2 [inv 12 -MCZn(II) N(pko) - 4]Cl 2 has been studying by <b>alkalimetry.</b> The trinuclear Mn 3 (pko) 4 (CH 3 O) 2 (X) 2 compounds are unique examples of trinuclear complexes simultaneously containing MnII and MnIV. Fits to variable temperature magnetic susceptibility data indicate that the MnII and MnIV are ferromagnetically coupled and have an S= 13 / 2 ground state. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{questions}} of the search, pharmacological activity and standardization of natural extracts are appropriate and important for national pharmaceutical science and practice. Since 2000, {{one of the key}} points of the Action Plan to ensure the integration of Ukraine into the European Union is development of the State Pharmacopoeia of Ukraine harmonized with the European Pharmacopoeia (PhEur). Aim : A comparative analysis of herbal material according to the methods for tropane group alkaloids determination, as described in the PhEur and in the 11 th Edition of USSR Pharmacopoeia Monographs «Stramonium leaf». Methods : Datura leaves samples have been harvested during 2010 - 2012 in different regions of Ukraine for experimental research. Identification of tropane group alkaloids was carried out by the method of thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and by Vitali-Morin colour reaction. According to the PhEur method, firstly Dragendorff reagent and then Sodium nitrite solutions were used for the TLC plates spraying. Alkaloids assay was carried out by <b>alkalimetry</b> method with indicator determination of equivalence point. Results : Datura leaves qualitative features, defined by PhEur and the 11 th Edition of USSR Pharmacopoeia Monographs «Stramonium leaf», as well as their rationing have been analyzed. Certain differences concerning regulated quality parameters of herbal material have been determined. A comparative analysis of the natural extracts by described in the given normative documents methods for determination of tropane group alkaloids content has been done. After spraying the TLC plates with Sodium nitrite solution, red-brown zones corresponding Hyoscyamine were determined. Hyoscine zones were characterized by less intense color. As a result of quantitative determination it was determined that the alkaloids content in analyzed Datura leaves samples was within the limits regulated by the PhEur and the 11 th Edition of USSR Pharmacopoeia – more than 0, 25 % calculated as atropine. Conclusion : Having analyzed the assay methods, described in the PhEur and the 11 th Edition of USSR Pharmacopoeia Monographs «Stramonium leaf», applied for the determination of tropane group alkaloids in Datura leaves, certain differences in tests preparation were determined. Nevertheless, both of the methods allow determination of tropane group alkaloids content in Datura leaves samples. The obtained experimental data are relevant and were considered when developing the State Pharmacopoeia of Ukraine Monograph «Stramonium leaf»</p...|$|E
