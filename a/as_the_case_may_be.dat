5|$|An error as to a {{precedent}} fact, if committed, deprives the public authority {{of power to}} take the action or make the decision in question. The existence or non-existence of the fact, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>may</b> <b>be,</b> is a condition precedent or prerequisite to the exercise of the power. An example of an error of this nature {{can be found in}} the United Kingdom case White & Collins v. Minister of Health (1939). In that case, under the relevant statute, the authority could only issue a compulsory purchase order affecting the applicants' land if it was not part of, among other things, a park. A minister confirmed the purchase order but the Court of Appeal of England and Wales held that it should be quashed, finding that the minister could not exercise power to acquire the land since it was part of a park. Whether the land was or was not a park was {{a precedent}} fact, and the minister had committed an error concerning this fact.|$|E

25|$|Switzerland is {{a federal}} {{republic}} in which {{the sovereignty of the}} constituent states (the cantons) is limited by the enumerated powers delegated to the federal state (the Confederation) through the federal constitution.

While the formal framework of the most important cantonal direct taxes has been harmonised through the 1990 Federal Tax Harmonisation Law, the cantons (and, <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>may</b> <b>be,</b> the municipalities) remain free to set their tax rates or establish new taxes, except on tax objects already taxed under federal law.|$|E
