The experimental conditions {{were that the}} junction was dc biased in the supercurrent mode, and that the applied rf-power exceeded a certain threshold value depending on the circuit losses. The frequency of the applied rf was approximately twice the plasma frequency.

40|$|A circuit is {{described}} which {{functions as a}} precision electronic analog of a resistively shunted, capacitive Josephson junction. This design offers significant improvements over earlier simulators, particularly because no analog switches are required, and also because high performance op-amps have been matched {{to the demands of}} the circuit. The <b>junction</b> <b>analog</b> is used to generate I-V curves, and to model the dynamics when an abrupt bias pulse is applied. The simulator is shown to be very accurate when tested against numerical solutions for the same systems...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} spintronic <b>analogs</b> of bipolar <b>junction</b> {{transistors}} {{have been proposed}} for signal processing applications. Here, we show {{that some of these}} transistors unfortunately may not have sufficient voltage and current gains for signal processing. They may also have poor isolation between input and output terminals which hinders unidirectional propagation of logic signal from the driver stage to the output. Therefore, these devices may not improve state-of-the-art signal processing capability, although they may provide some additional functionality by offering nonvolatile storage. They may also have niche applications in nonlinear circuits...|$|R
40|$|T 7 {{endonuclease}} I binds {{specifically to}} four-way junctions in duplex DNA and promotes their resolution into linear duplexes. Under {{conditions in which}} the nuclease activity is blocked {{by the absence of}} divalent cations, the enzyme forms a distinct protein-DNA complex with the junction, as detected by gel retardation and filter binding assays. The formation of this complex is structure-specific and contrasts with the short-lived binding complexes formed on linear duplex DNA. The binding complex between T 7 endonuclease I and a synthetic Holliday <b>junction</b> <b>analog</b> has been probed with hydroxyl radicals. The results indicate that the nuclease binds all four strands about the junction point...|$|R
40|$|The Holliday {{junction}} is a four-stranded DNA inter-mediate {{that arises}} during recombination reactions. We have designed and constructed {{a set of}} Holliday <b>junction</b> <b>analogs</b> that model each of the ideal confor-mations available to a a-fold symmetric four-arm junc-tion. The strategy used is to connect two arms of a junction molecule with a short tether of thymidines. These DNA molecules share a common core sequence but have different arms that are connected so that each molecule is constrained in either an antiparallel or a parallel structure. For tethered antiparallel molecules {{the identity of the}} crossover strands is determined by which arms are connected. Different arm connections gave molecules representing each of the two antipar-allel crossover isomers. Two parallel molecules tha...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} is aimed to design a {{prototype}} of hybrid silicon-muscle cell <b>junction,</b> <b>analog</b> to an artificial neuromuscular junction prototype and relevant {{to the development of}} advanced neuro-prostheses and bionic systems. The device achieves focal Electric Capacitive Stimulation (ECS) by coupling of single cells and semiconductors, without electrochemical reaction with the substrate. A voltage change applied to a stimulation spot beneath an electrogenic cell leads to a capacitive current (charge accumulation) that opens voltage-gated ion channels in the membrane and generates an action potential. The myo-electronic junction was employed to chronically stimulate muscle cells via ECS and to induce cytosolic calcium transients in myotubes, fibers isolated from mouse FDB (fast [Ca(2 +) ](i) transients) and surprisingly also in undifferentiated myoblasts (slow [Ca(2 +) ](i) waves). The hybrid junction elicited, via chronic ECS, a differential reprogramming of single muscle cells by inducing early muscle contraction maturation and plasticity effects, such as NFAT-C 3 nuclear translocation. In addition, in the presence of agrin, chronic ECS induced a modulation of AchR clustering which simulates in vitro synaptogenesis. This methodology can coordinate the myogenic differentiation, thus offering direct but non-invasive single cell/wiring, providing a platform for regenerative medicine strategies...|$|R
40|$|An assay was {{developed}} that detected DNA cruciform cutting endonuclease activity in crude extracts of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A collection of temperature-sensitive strains was screened using this assay, and a mutant lacking the activity was found. The mutation {{leading to the}} enzymatic defect was mapped to the left arm of chromosome XI within 3 cM of the centromere. Cloning of the gene for this endonuclease was achieved by chromosome walking from the nearby PUT 3 locus. The gene, called CCE 1 (cruciform cutting endonuclease), was sequenced and found to have an open reading frame encoding a 41 kDa protein. The amino acid sequence of this eukaryotic endonuclease shows homology neither to its prokaryotic counterparts nor to other proteins in available databases. A cce 1 null mutant has no obvious growth defect, and despite {{the ability of the}} CCE 1 enzyme to cleave Holliday <b>junction</b> <b>analogs,</b> the mutant shows no defect in meiotic or mitotic recombination. A second cruciform cutting activity was detected in extracts from a cce 1 null mutant, indicating that yeast has at least two such enzymes. The only phenotype observed for cce 1 mutants is a higher than normal frequency of appearance of petite cells, suggesting that the CCE 1 protein is important for the maintenance of mitochondrial DNA...|$|R
40|$|The {{deoxyribonucleoside}} kinase of {{the fruit}} fly Drosophila melanogaster (Dm-dNK) is a multisubstrate enzyme that phosphorylates pyrimidine and purine deoxyribonucleosides {{as well as several}} anticancer and antiviral nucleoside analogs. Dm-dNK is sequence related to the human deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK) and thymidine kinase 2 (M), {{as well as to the}} herpes simplex virus type- 1 thymidine kinase (Hsv- 1 TK). The human and viral deoxyribonucleoside kinases can phosphorylate multiple deoxyribonucleosides, whereas Dm-dNK has the ability to phosphorylate all naturally occurring deoxyribonucleosides required for DNA replication. In addition to its broad substrate specificity, Dm-dNK also exhibits higher catalytic rates for nucleoside and nucleoside analog phosphorylation compared to other nucleoside kinases. Nucleoside kinases are being investigated for possible use as suicide genes in combined gene/chemotherapy of cancer. The most commonly studied nucleoside kinase suicide gene is the HSV- 1 TK gene used in combination with the guanosine nucleoside analog ganciclovir. The suicide nucleoside kinase is ratelimiting in the pharmacological activation of the cytotoxic nucleoside analogs, and mutants of HSV- 1 TK with improved biochemical properties for nucleoside analog phosphorylation are more efficient suicide genes. The broad substrate specificity of Dm-dNK and its high catalytic rate makes it an interesting candidate gene for suicide gene therapy. The possible use of Dm-dNK as a suicide gene has been evaluated and it has been shown that over-expression of Dm-dNK enhances the sensitivity of cancer cells to several cytotoxic nucleoside analogs. Although Dm-dNK phosphorylates both purine and pyrimidine nucleosides, the enzyme has a preference for pyrimidine nucleosides. The maximal catalytic rate of purine and pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylation is similar, but the enzyme exhibits higher affinity for pyrimidine nucleosides and nucleoside analogs. For suicide gene therapy application, purine nucleoside analogs may be preferred because these compounds appear to induce a higher bystander cell killing, i. e. killing of untransduced neighboring cells by transfer of phosphorylated nucleoside <b>analogs</b> via gap <b>junctions.</b> The solved structures of Dm-dNK, dGK and HSV- 1 TK, reveal a common folding of these enzymes and in particular the amino acid residues involved in substrate interactions are highly conserved. However, the substrate binding site also exhibits some major differences between Dm-dNK and HSV- 1 TK. Based on this structural information we performed site directed mutagenesis of the residues Asn 28, I 1 e 29, Phe 1 14 and G 1 n 81 in order to understand the determinants of the substrate specificity of the enzyme and to find Dm-dNK mutants with improved kinetic properties for application in suicide gene therapy. It has also been shown that Dm-dNK with 20 amino acid C-terminal deletion has even higher catalytic rates for deoxyribonucleosides compared to wild-type, and it was also reported that the mutagenesis of a few amino acids allows to change the substrate specificity from pyrimidines to purines. Based on these previous studies we constructed the reported mutated enzymes and designed new mutations, with and without the 20 amino acid C-terminal deletion. We measured the ability to phosphorylate ganciclovir (GCV). We have finally selected the most efficient enzymes phosphorylating GCV and expressed in an osteosarcoma TK cell line and determined the sensitivity to nucleoside analogs. The cells expressing the Met 88 Arg mutant enzyme showed the highest increased sensitivity to purine nucleoside analogs with 8 to 80 -fold decreased IC 50 compared to untransduced control cells or cells expressing the wild-type nucleoside kinase. We have also created a Dm-dNK protein targeted to the mitochondrial matrix by fusing a mitochondrial targeting signal to the N-terminus of the protein. We showed that the mitochondrial Dm-dNK was enzymatically active and that overexpression of the enzyme in an osteosarcoma TK‾deficient cell line resulted in an increased sensitivity to some nucleoside analogs such as 1 -â-D-arabinofuranosylthymine (araT), (E) - 5 -(2 -bromovinyl) - 2 ''-deoxyuridine (BVDU), 5 -bromo- 2 '' eoxyuridine (5 -Br-dUrd) and 5 fluoro 2 ''deoxyuridine (S-F-dUrd). Labeling studies using [3 H]-dThd also showed that mitochondrial expression of Dm-dNK, compared to nuclear expression, resulted in a higher specific [3 H]-dTTP activity in the total MP pool and as a result a higher rate of [3 H]-dTTP incorporation into nuclear DNA. We conducted structural studies on HSV- 1 TK. In particular we performed site-directed mutagenesis on A 1 a 167 and A 1 a 168 of the HSV- 1 TK. The mutated A 1 a 168 His and A 1 a 167 Phe enzymes turned out to have knocked-out the dThd activity while retaining full GCV phosphorylation ability...|$|R
