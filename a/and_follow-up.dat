The aim of this study was, therefore, to analyse, in a cluster-randomised design, the long-term effects of an individualised follow-up model on welfare recipients' self-sufficiency. The follow-up model systematises the work done by social workers within the Qualification Programme, which is a welfare-to-work programme in Norway. In the study, 18 labour and welfare offices were randomised to experimental and control groups. The data consist of baseline questionnaires for Qualification Programme participants (n = 617) <b>and</b> <b>follow-ups</b> based on administrative data at 12, 24 and 30 months after baseline. The results show significant effects of individualised follow-up on self-sufficiency at the 30 -month <b>follow-up</b> <b>and</b> strong positive trends at the 18 - <b>and</b> 24 -month <b>follow-ups.</b> Thus, comprehensive <b>and</b> individualised <b>follow-up</b> of participants within activation programmes seems to generate positive long-term effects on self-sufficienc...|$|R
