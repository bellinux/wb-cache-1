5|$|De Saulles {{created the}} new florin {{in this manner}} to {{distinguish}} the coin from the half crown, as there had been complaints of confusion. He probably based the design on his British trade dollar (1895). The sitter for the design was Susan Hicks-Beach, the daughter of Michael Hicks-Beach, 1st Earl St Aldwyn who had served as Chancellor of the Exchequer and ex officio Master of the Mint. The modern-day Britannia coinage, bullion pieces struck by the Royal Mint for investors and collectors, has <b>a</b> <b>reverse</b> that strongly resembles that of the Edwardian florin.|$|E

On the first play of the drive, Tech attempted <b>a</b> <b>reverse</b> pass, but the ball fell incomplete. Two subsequent plays were stopped for no gain, and Tech punted {{for the first time in}} the game.|$|E
5|$|Purified water {{should be}} used for {{watering}} purposes, although 'hard water' is tolerated. This is done to minimise the build-up of minerals and chemicals in the soil.

Flight control surfaces include leading-edge flaps, flaperons, ailerons, rudders on the canted vertical stabilizers, and all-moving horizontal tails; these surfaces also serve as speed brakes.|$|E
5|$|Woodson, {{who played}} 16 {{offensive}} plays, gave Michigan the lead 9 seconds {{into the second}} quarter on a 33-yard touchdown run off <b>a</b> <b>reverse</b> play. Michigan scored its second touchdown on a drive starting at Minnesota's 33-yard line following a short punt. Griese connected with Thomas for 28 yards and then with Mark Campbell for a 12-yard touchdown to give Michigan a 14–3 halftime lead. In the third quarter, Michigan mounted a 93-yard drive that ended with a 29-yard touchdown run by Thomas. Baker added a field goal in the final quarter.|$|E

5|$|After construction, {{the station}} {{served as the}} PRR's sole Philadelphia stop for most long-distance east-west Main Line traffic to avoid <b>a</b> <b>reverse</b> move into Broad Street Station (and later 30th Street Station).

Within a decade of completion, the station was already overcrowded. On June 22, 1912, the PRR signed a million-dollar contract for massive renovations to the station. Designed by PRR architect William H. Cookman, the modifications reflected the latest in passenger station design.|$|E
5|$|After {{their loss}} against Howard, the Informals {{traveled}} {{to play the}} Marion Military Institute Cadets at Perry County High School Stadium. Against the Cadets, Alabama scored at least one touchdown in all four quarters for the 31–12 victory. The Informals scored first on an 80-yard Barton Greer touchdown run, only to see the Cadets tie the game at 6–6 on the next possession on a 40-yard touchdown pass. Alabama responded with a 20-yard touchdown run on <b>a</b> <b>reverse</b> by Whitey Blanchiak to take a 12–6 halftime lead. In the third quarter, the Informals extended their lead to 24–6 after Lowell Edmondson scored on a 35-yard touchdown pass from Greer and on a four-yard Frank MacAlpine touchdown run in the third quarter. In the fourth, Greer scored on a run for Alabama and Marion scored the final points of the game on a punt returned for a touchdown in their 31–12 loss.|$|E
5|$|Consistent {{condom use}} {{reduces the risk}} of HIV {{transmission}} by approximately 80% over the long term. When condoms are used consistently by a couple in which one person is infected, the rate of HIV infection is less than 1% per year. There is some evidence to suggest that female condoms may provide an equivalent level of protection. Application of a vaginal gel containing tenofovir (<b>a</b> <b>reverse</b> transcriptase inhibitor) immediately before sex seems to reduce infection rates by approximately 40% among African women. By contrast, use of the spermicide nonoxynol-9 may increase the risk of transmission due to its tendency to cause vaginal and rectal irritation.|$|E

Of the remaining residents, 0.4% owned a share of individual housing, 0.7% lived in hostels, and almost 99% lived in apartments. The scarcity of lots means {{that the number of}} single-family dwellings is not likely to increase; <b>a</b> <b>reverse</b> process is taking place: old wooden houses are being demolished, making room for new residential and commercial constructions.

He sees Hoffman brought into the morgue in a body bag and tries to warn Palmer, but an automatic turret gun rises up and kills him along with his men. Hoffman kills Dr. Heffner, Palmer, and everyone else in his path to Jill, who briefly escapes before she is caught and knocked unconscious.

5|$|In 1835, Director of the United States Mint Samuel Moore {{resigned}} his post, and Robert M. Patterson {{assumed the}} position.

On August 1, Patterson {{wrote a letter to}} Philadelphia artist Thomas Sully laying out his plans for the dollar coin. He also asked Titian Peale to create a design for the coin. Sully created an obverse design depicting a seated representation of Liberty and Peale <b>a</b> <b>reverse</b> depicting a soaring bald eagle, which were converted into coin designs by Gobrecht.
