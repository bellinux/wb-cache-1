5|$|According to {{his later}} accounts, Smith was visited by an angel named Moroni, while praying {{one night in}} 1823. Smith said that this angel {{revealed}} {{the location of a}} buried book made of golden plates, as well as other artifacts, including a breastplate <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> of interpreters composed of two seer stones set in a frame, which had been hidden in a hill near his home. Smith said he attempted to remove the plates the next morning, but was unsuccessful because the angel returned and prevented him. Smith reported that during the next four years, he made annual visits to the hill, but each time returned without the plates.|$|E
5|$|At {{the south}} eastern {{corner of the}} eastern terrace is the former pumping station, {{associated}} tunnels <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> of 1850s workshops within an enclosing wall. Underneath parts of the eastern terrace, the adjacent Hampton Road, the pumping station and the workshops there are a complex series of shafts, drives and weirs cut from the rock during the 1890s and early twentieth century. The east workshops is a single storey limestone building {{on the western side}} with an enclosed area to the east. The entire workshops yard was roofed using a light steel truss on steel supports in 1960.|$|E
5|$|Bond veteran {{cameraman}} {{and professional}} skier Willy Bogner, Jr. {{was promoted to}} director of a second unit involving ski footage. Bogner designed the ski chase on the bobsleigh track of Cortina d'Ampezzo hoping to surpass his work in both On Her Majesty's Secret Service and The Spy Who Loved Me. To allow better filming, Bogner developed both a system where he was attached to a bobsleigh, allowing to film the vehicle or behind it, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> of skis {{that allowed him to}} ski forwards and backwards to get the best shots. In February 1981, {{on the final day of}} filming the bobsleigh chase, one of the stuntmen driving a sleigh, 23-year-old Paolo Rigon, was killed when he became trapped under the bob.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} some algebraic {{properties of}} some certain sets of stochastic matrices of probabilistic automata {{from the standpoint}} of their characteristic values. At first, <b>a</b> definite <b>set</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> quasidefinite <b>set</b> introduced by Paz (1965), are algebraically investigated. Then we introduce new concepts, <b>a</b> periodic <b>set</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> quasiperiodic <b>set,</b> which are defined among stochastic matrices with a period t. The results obtained from <b>a</b> periodic <b>set</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> quasiperiodic <b>set</b> have <b>a</b> remarkable correspondence to those from <b>a</b> definite <b>set</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> quasidefinite <b>set,</b> respectively, <b>and</b> the formers {{in the case of the}} period t = 1 coincide with the latters. It is known that <b>a</b> definite <b>set</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> quasidefinite <b>set</b> are the special case and the extended concept of actual automata, respectively, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> definite <b>set</b> can be associated with a definite automaton. On the other hand, it is shown that <b>a</b> periodic <b>set</b> can be associated with a bounded transient automation which is constructed from autonomous and definite machines...|$|R

5|$|By September 1944, Allied {{forces had}} {{successfully}} broken {{out of their}} Normandy beachhead and pursued shattered German forces across Northern France and Belgium. Although Allied commanders generally favoured a broad front policy to continue the advance into Germany and the Netherlands, Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery proposed a bold plan to head north through the Dutch Gelderland, bypassing the German Siegfried Line defences and opening a route into the German industrial heartland of the Ruhr. Initially proposed as a British and Polish operation codenamed Operation Comet, the plan was soon expanded to involve most of the First Allied Airborne Army <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> piece ground advance into the Netherlands, codenamed Market Garden.|$|E

There is also stepped access to the footbridge from the south, and a ramp down to the southern platform. There is no taxi rank, but there are bus stops on Whiteladies Road.

5|$|From 1912 to 1917, {{the state}} {{acquired}} {{all of the}} 541separate properties that comprise the Eighth Ward east of the capitol. The Eighth Ward was situated between the capitol <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> of railroad tracks, then owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad. Arnold Brunner was hired in 1916 to develop new accommodations for state government, which had already outgrown the capitol. He introduced his plan in 1920, which called, first, for the demolition of the Eighth Ward. Brunner planned two office buildings behind the capitol, the North and South Office Buildings, and these were separated by a courtyard he named the People's Court. The South Office Building was completed in 1921. The leveling of the Eighth Ward was finished in 1925.|$|E
5|$|Grammar can be {{described}} as a system of categories <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> of rules that determine how categories combine to form different aspects of meaning. Languages differ widely in whether they are encoded through the use of categories or lexical units. However, several categories are so common as to be nearly universal. Such universal categories include the encoding of the grammatical relations of participants and predicates by grammatically distinguishing between their relations to a predicate, the encoding of temporal and spatial relations on predicates, and a system of grammatical person governing reference to and distinction between speakers and addressees and those about whom they are speaking.|$|E

5|$|Metabolism {{involves}} {{a vast array}} of chemical reactions, but most fall under a few basic types of reactions that involve the transfer of functional groups of atoms and their bonds within molecules. This common chemistry allows cells to use a small set of metabolic intermediates to carry chemical groups between different reactions. These group-transfer intermediates are called coenzymes. Each class of group-transfer reactions is carried out by a particular coenzyme, which is the substrate for a set of enzymes that produce it, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>set</b> of enzymes that consume it. These coenzymes are therefore continuously made, consumed and then recycled.|$|E

5|$|Russia built {{a number}} of ironclads, {{generally}} copies of British or French designs.

The Russian Navy pioneered the wide-scale use of torpedo boats during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, mainly out of necessity because of the superior numbers and quality of ironclads used by the Turkish navy. Russia expanded her navy in the 1880s and 1890s with modern armored cruisers and battleships, but the ships were manned by inexperienced crews and politically appointed leadership, which enhanced their defeat in the Battle of Tsushima on 27 May 1905.|$|E
