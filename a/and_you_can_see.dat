It has conducted several raids on migrant workers accused of not living at their employer's residence. However, Robert Godden of Amnesty Asia-Pacific said: [...] "The specifics, {{many of the}} factors leading to the abuse , {{can be applied to}} thousands of migrant domestic workers: underpayment, restrictions on movement; you can see that she was heavily indebted by the illegal recruitment fees charged by the agency, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> that she didn't know how to access justice." [...] In 2014, the Labour Department prosecuted an employer who allegedly abused Rowena Uychiat during her nine-month employment.|$|E
500|$|Ryan Gilbey of The Guardian was broadly {{positive}} about the film: [...] "It's still playing to full houses, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> why. Slick it may be. But tourist board employees representing the various Spanish cities flattered in the movie {{are not the only}} ones who will come out grinning.", though he found the movie [...] "stubbornly un-macho" [...] for a buddy film. The National reviewer Kaleem Aftab, in his 4 star review, noted [...] "Throwing together road trip, romcom and buddy-buddy action in a single picture may sound like an ill-conceived masala mash-up, but like any good dish, the ingredients are blended together with affection to create one of the best feel-good movies of the year." ...|$|E
500|$|The show {{features}} an ensemble cast of four characters: Jerry Seinfeld {{stars as a}} fictional version of himself; Jason Alexander portrays Seinfeld's neurotic friend George Costanza; Julia Louis-Dreyfus plays Elaine Benes, Seinfeld's ex-girlfriend; and Michael Richards stars as Seinfeld's neighbor Kramer. Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe noted the characters' evolution during the season: [...] "As the seasons progress, you can see Michael Richards turn Kramer [...] from a vague eccentric [...] into a stylized creation who redefined TV's quirky-neighbor type with Danny Kaye accents. You can see Julia Louis-Dreyfus [...] develop Elaine from a puffy-haired gal pal (who wasn't in the pilot) into a delightfully petty urbanite. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> Jason Alexander push George from [...] "a blatant Woody Allen impression", as the actor acknowledges, into a more offensive and hyperactive neurotic." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{clip from}} [...] "A Clockwork Yellow" [...] was first {{shown at the}} San Diego Comic-Con in July 2014. Executive {{producer}} Al Jean spoke to Entertainment Weekly in September 2014 about the third segment of the episode, and the difference in voices between the older and newer versions of the characters. He said that although Dan Castellaneta’s portrayal of Homer is better remembered for its evolution over time, Nancy Cartwright’s voicing of Bart changed as well, because [...] "it was lower-register, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> in the difference in this segment. It was really funny to get the interplay [...] and for the actors to see the voice evolution. The great thing is we didn’t have to ask—we already had the cast hired for the Tracey Ullman Simpsons." [...] He also revealed that the segment expanded on an earlier episode which implied that the Ullman Simpsons were murdered and buried under the family home, stating [...] "if people want a real Halloween bloodbath, they get it." ...|$|E
500|$|To {{create the}} Mummy, Berton used a {{combination}} of live action and computer graphics. Then, he matched the digital prosthetic make-up pieces on Vosloo's face during filming. Berton said, [...] "When you see his film image, that's him. When he turns his head and half of his face is missing <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> right through on to his teeth, that's really his face. And that's {{why it was so}} hard to do." [...] Vosloo described the filming as a [...] "whole new thing" [...] for him; [...] "They had to put these little red tracking lights all over my face so they could map in the special effects. A lot of the time I was walking around the set looking like a Christmas tree." [...] Make-Up Effects Supervisor Nick Dudman produced the physical creature effects in the film, including three-dimensional make-up and prosthetics. He also designed all of the animatronic effects. While the film made extensive use of computer generated imagery, many scenes, including ones where Rachel Weisz's character is covered with rats and locusts, were real, using live animals.|$|E
500|$|In early 2011, Cooder was {{inspired}} to write the song [...] "No Banker Left Behind", and subsequently {{the rest of the}} album, by a headline about bankers and other affluent people who had profited from the bank bailouts and resulting recession during the late-2000s. In an interview with Kai Ryssdal on Marketplace, Cooder cited the song as the starting point for writing the album and stated, [...] "'No Banker Left Behind' originated with a line from Robert Scheer's Truthdig blog. I read this pretty regularly, and when I saw this, this metric I thought 'no banker left behind.'" [...] He compared the album's content to Woody Guthrie's songs about the Dust Bowl era during the Great Depression and said of his own songs, [...] "What I like in the idea of these songs is if you follow the logic of each tune — this happened and this happened <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> that at the end, this is the result, you just didn't see it this way before, you never thought of Wall Street in terms of Jesse James and bilingual heft." ...|$|E

500|$|Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Downs {{music is}} rooted in Americana and draws {{on a number of}} styles, {{including}} blues, folk, ragtime, norteño, rock, and country music. For the songs, Cooder adapted musical language from historical sources and incorporated styles from both North and South American traditions. In his interview on Marketplace, he explained his stylistic approach for Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down, stating [...] "to me, these musical styles and sounds are narratives as well. I mean everything about them — if it's an accordion, horns, the banda horns for the immigrant tunes — they all are part of the story. <b>And</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> it then, you can imagine the Arizona border that's hot, 120 degrees in the shade, dusty. The banda horns are coming from some truck over there." [...] According to him, musical settings for certain songs were decided based on their respective compositions, such as when [...] "the words would come to me in ¾ time, that meant corrido, that means accordion; banda horns because they’re exciting." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Blown Away" [...] {{was directed by}} Randee St. Nicholas and produced by Brandon Bonfiglo for Randee St. Nicholas Photography. Underwood said that when she heard first the song, she already had ideas of a possible video for it, and {{wanted it to be}} a dark Wizard of Oz in 2012. The singer deemed it [...] "a visual song. You listen to it <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> everything that is happening. It's so dramatic. I'm not a drama person, but when you can make a movie in song form in three-and-a-half minutes, it's surreal." [...] A sneak peek of the video was released on June 11, 2012. The music video premiered worldwide on July 30, during a 24-hour exclusive window domestically and internationally on E! News at 7 and 11:30p.m. ET/PT and on the homepage of E! Online. Prior to the E! premiere, Underwood held a private screening of the video with country radio station KJ97 for over 200 of their listeners in San Antonio, Texas.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{has been}} well {{received}} by reviewers. TV Guide ranked it No. 7 on its list of the ten best Star Trek episodes for the magazine's celebration of the franchise's 30th anniversary. In a retrospective review, Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club praised the episode for quickly establishing the premise and stakes, as well as turning Tasha Yar's death {{into one of the}} episode's [...] "strongest emotional beats... Tasha's determination to die with meaning by the end of [...] transforms her from a misstep into something more noble and sad." [...] In contrast, Tor Books' Keith DeCandido wrote that while the guest stars were excellent, Tasha Yar's return for a [...] "TV death" [...] is the episode's major flaw: [...] "It is, in short, a scripted death, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> the marionette strings", he wrote. Film critic Jordan Hoffman wrote that the episode is [...] "heavy, PhilipK. Dick-ian stuff that actually takes some thought to follow and... all victories come at a cost", and that it is a fan favorite episode for good reason. Likewise, Den of Geek reviewer James Hunt praised the episode for finding the human stakes in the story, elevating it above standard science fiction time travel stories.|$|E

500|$|Upon {{beginning}} {{development of}} Crash Nitro Kart, Vicarious Visions {{chief executive officer}} and chief creative officer Karthik Bala noted that Crash's physical appearance had been inconsistent since his debut in 1996 and decided to [...] "explore the original vision of the character" [...] {{in an attempt to}} bring him back to his roots. Charles Zembillas and Joe Pearson were tracked down and enlisted for guidance during development of the game and were faced with the challenge of evolving the character and the franchise visually while retaining their [...] "cartoon-like charm". To redesign Crash and the other mainstay characters of the series for Crash Nitro Kart, the Vicarious Visions team reviewed a number of original development sketches from Zembillas's archives and then redesigned the main characters by incorporating details from the concept art and adding girth to the characters; Crash's appearance in the game, compared to the previous two games, sports a slightly larger nose, fuller eyebrows, and a far more textured body. Zembillas noted that [...] "Crash is slimmer and more appealing now. There's also more emphasis on his eyes, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> the craftiness in his personality. That's Crash to me, and he's alive again in Nitro Kart".|$|E

[...] Men and women restrict food intake in an effort to achieve what they consider an attractively-thin body; in extreme cases, this leads to eating disorders. Psychiatrist Thomas Holbrook cited a recent Canadian study indicating that as many as one in six people with eating disorders are men.|$|E
