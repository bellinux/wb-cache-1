5|$|The {{order for}} 50 {{aircraft}} placed in 1946 was modified to 48 single seaters and one aircraft for the OKB itself, all lacking armament. They were manufactured in March–April 1947 {{with the standard}} armament of one 37mm Nudelman N-37 autocannon, with 40 rounds, and two 23mm Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 guns, but the production line shut down afterward to incorporate some of the desired changes. These included reinforcement and enlargement of the vertical tail to improve lateral stability; air brakes were added on the wings and the fuel system was improved. The underside of the rear fuselage was recontoured to smooth the air flow of the engine exhaust and <b>air</b> <b>suction</b> inside the fuselage was eliminated. Production restarted {{and a total of}} 243 single seaters were completed during the remainder of the year. 250 fighters and 60 trainers were scheduled to be built in 1948, but production was disrupted by preparations to begin manufacture of the vastly superior MiG-15 later that year. Only 302 fighters were delivered that year before production ceased.|$|E

The endoscope is then passed through the anus up the rectum, the colon (sigmoid, descending, transverse and ascending colon, the cecum), and ultimately the terminal ileum. The endoscope has a movable tip and multiple channels for instrumentation, <b>air,</b> <b>suction</b> and light. The bowel is occasionally insufflated with air to maximize visibility (a procedure which gives one the false sensation of needing to take a bowel movement). Biopsies are frequently taken for histology. Additionally in a procedure known as chromoendoscopy, a contrast-dye (such as Indigo carmine) may be sprayed via the endoscope onto the bowel wall to help visualise any abnormalities in the mucosal morphology. A Cochrane review updated in 2016 found strong evidence that chromoscopy enhances the detection of cancerous tumours in the colon and rectum.|$|E

Before the mission the bomb aimer entered basic information about the target altitude and the bombs being dropped, and periodically updated the wind speed and direction.

50|$|In the {{advancement}} of these hermetic storage benefits, three methods are popular used to safely store grain and seeds under hermetic conditions:1. Organic Hermetic storage - This process of storage deprive pesticides and insects infestation of oxygen hence slowing down their metabolic process. In the process insects are allowed a chance to respire for few days in the process oxygen depletion take an effect leading to a total annihilation of the un-invited campers (due to suffocation).2. Vacuum Hermetic Fumigation - In this process <b>air</b> <b>suction</b> takes precedence. Air within the hermetic storage is sucked out leaving little oxygen for living organisms to survive on. Suction of the air creates a low atmospheric pressure which is unfriendly and unconducive for invaders (i.e. insects).3.

50|$|Polyamide-imide resin is hygroscopic, {{and picks}} up ambient moisture. Before {{processing}} the resin, drying is required to avoid brittle parts, foaming, and other molding problems. The resin must be dried to a moisture content of 500 ppm or less. A desiccant dryer capable of maintaining a dew point of -40 °F (-40 °C) is recommended. If drying is done in pans or trays, put the resin in layers no more than 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 cm) deep in drying trays. Dry for 24 hours at 250 °F, or 16 hours at 300 °F, or 8 hours at 350 °F.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, the flow around a {{streamlined}} box girder with uniform <b>air</b> <b>suction</b> {{has been investigated}} numerically. Two-dimensional incompressible unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) equations are solved {{in conjunction with the}} SST k ω − turbulence model in simulations. Taking the Great Belt Bridge girder as an example, cases of different suction positions on the girder section were discussed. The effect of the suction ratio and the angle of attack (AOA) of wind also were investigated. The result showed that the aerodynamic drag force was influenced by the uniform suction through either upper surface or lower surface of the box girder. The larger the suction ratio was, the more the drag-reducing could be. The suction position and AOA had a comprehensive effect on the drag force. The vortex shedding frequency was also affected by <b>air</b> <b>suction.</b> For the aerodynamic lift force and moment, <b>air</b> <b>suction</b> showed no obvious influence.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{boundary}} layer with the airfoil profile, this research attempts to investigate {{the effect of the}} angle of spread of the winged <b>air</b> <b>suction</b> equipment on the efficiency of operation. The application of Fluent with the split-middle method under the identical operation mode is expected to optimize the spread angle. The investigated airfoil profile is NACA 6413, of which the restrictions on the critical angle of spread suggested in literature will be overcome through the interactions between the internal and external flow fields. As a result, the air speed might increase. The wind tunnel test employed in this research offers the solid evidences to support this hypothesis. The test demonstrates that when the angle of spread is larger than 12 °, the effect of accelerating the air flow is still observable. Following the optimization, the <b>air</b> <b>suction</b> effect of the equipment would be optimal when its angle of spread reached 30 °.

In principle, if 80 percent of wing is laminar, then overall drag could be reduced by 25 percent. The frictional force between {{the air and the}} aircraft surface, known as viscous drag, is much larger in a turbulent boundary layer than in a laminar one.

50|$|An {{airbrush}} {{works by}} passing {{a stream of}} fast moving (compressed) air through a venturi, which creates a local reduction in <b>air</b> pressure (<b>suction)</b> that allows paint to be pulled from an interconnected reservoir at normal atmospheric pressure. The high velocity of the air atomizes the paint into very tiny droplets as it blows past a very fine paint-metering component. The paint is carried onto paper or other surfaces. The operator controls the amount of paint using a variable trigger which opens {{more or less a}} very fine tapered needle that is the control element of the paint-metering component. An extremely fine degree of atomization is what allows an artist to create such smooth blending effects using the airbrush.|$|R
