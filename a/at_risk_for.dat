African-American children and those living in old housing have also been found to be at elevated risk for high blood lead levels in the US. Low-income people often live in old housing with lead paint, which may begin to peel, exposing residents to high levels of lead-containing dust.|$|E

5|$|A {{woman who}} has {{elevated}} blood lead levels during pregnancy is {{at greater risk of}} a prematurely birth or with a low birth weight. Children are more <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> lead poisoning because their smaller bodies are in a continuous state of growth and development. Lead is absorbed at a faster rate compared to adults, which causes more physical harm than to older people. Furthermore, children, especially as they are learning to crawl and walk, are constantly on the floor and therefore more prone to ingesting and inhaling dust that is contaminated with lead.|$|E

People <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> AD can take medications {{to help prevent}} it before sex, {{but if it does}} occur they must stop and seek treatment. Mild signs of AD such as slightly high blood pressure frequently do accompany sexual arousal and are not cause for alarm. In fact, some interpret the symptoms of AD that occur during sexual activity as pleasant or arousing, or even climactic.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{to prevent}} the disease include not having sex or having few sexual {{partners}} and using condoms. Screening women <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> chlamydial infection followed by treatment decreases the risk of PID. If the diagnosis is suspected, treatment is typically advised. Treating a woman's sexual partners should also occur. In those with mild or moderate symptoms a single injection of the antibiotic ceftriaxone along with two weeks of doxycycline and possibly metronidazole by mouth is recommended. For {{those who do not}} improve after three days or who have severe disease intravenous antibiotics should be used.|$|E

According to research by the Veterinary Medical Data Program (1986), six cancers that Scotties appeared to be more <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> (when compared to other breeds) are: (in descending order) bladder cancer and other transitional cell carcinomas of the lower urinary tract; malignant melanoma; gastric carcinoma; squamous cell carcinoma of the skin; lymphosarcoma and nasal carcinoma.

5|$|There are {{concerns}} {{as to whether}} breeding hairless and tailless rats is ethical. The tail is vital for rats' balance and for adjusting body temperature. Tailless rats have greater risk of heat exhaustion, poor bowel and bladder control, falling from heights, and can be <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> life-threatening deformities in the pelvic region like hind leg paralysis and megacolon. Similarly, hairless rats are less protected from scratches and the cold without their coat. Groups such as the NFRS prohibit the showing of these varieties at their events and forbid advertisement through affiliated services.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the group}} of people <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> SAH is younger than the {{population}} usually affected by stroke, the risk still increases with age. Young people are much less likely than middle-age people (risk ratio 0.1, or 10 percent) to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The risk continues to rise with age and is 60 percent higher in the very elderly (over 85) than in those between 45 and 55. Risk of SAH is about 25 percent higher in women over 55 compared to men the same age, probably reflecting the hormonal changes that result from the menopause, such as a decrease in estrogen levels.|$|E

5|$|Catastrophic {{injuries}} {{have been}} on a steady decline since the 1960s, due in part to rules banning dangerous forms of contact such as spearing, face tackling and butt blocking. However, catastrophic injuries are still caused by helmet-to-helmet collisions, as well when players hit their heads against an opposing player's knee or the ground. Returning to play after sustaining a head injury earlier in the game also places players <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> an even more severe injury. Many states are requiring teams to prevent players who have shown any signs of a concussion from returning to a game, while other steps such as more aggressive enforcement of safety rules and better condition of the neck muscles have been suggested. Additionally, coaches are being urged to train players to block with their shoulders instead of their heads.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} of time of removal of thiomersal, the CDC and AAP asked doctors to delay the birth dose of {{hepatitis}} B vaccine in children not <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> hepatitis. This decision, though following the precautionary principle, nevertheless sparked confusion, controversy and some harm. Approximately 10% of hospitals suspended the use of hepatitis B vaccine for all newborns, and one child born to a Michigan mother infected with hepatitis B virus died of it. Similarly, a study found that the number of hospitals who failed to properly vaccinate infants of hepatitis B seropositive mothers rose by over 6 times. This is a potential negative outcome given the high probability that infants who acquire hepatitis B infection at birth will develop the infection in a chronic form and possibly liver cancer.|$|E
