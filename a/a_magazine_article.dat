5|$|In September 1909, Glavis {{made his}} {{allegations}} public in <b>a</b> <b>magazine</b> <b>article,</b> disclosing that Ballinger had acted {{as an attorney}} for Cunningham between his two periods of government service. This violated conflict of interest rules forbidding a former government official from advocacy on a matter he had been responsible for. On September 13, 1909 Taft dismissed Glavis from government service, relying on a report from Attorney General George W. Wickersham dated two days previously. Pinchot was determined to dramatize the issue by forcing his own dismissal, which Taft tried to avoid, fearing that it might cause a break with Roosevelt (still overseas). Taft asked Elihu Root (by then a senator) {{to look into the}} matter, and Root urged the firing of Pinchot.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 28 March, Triton spotted Guam and {{observed}} activity on shore via her periscope. Petty Officer Edward Carbullido (pictured), who had been born on Guam but had not returned home for 14 years, was asked to identify his parents' house through the periscope while the boat remained submerged in Agat Bay. Triton then changed course for the Philippines, the midpoint of her around-the-world voyage. Carbullido was subsequently able {{to go home to}} Guam for Christmas Day 1960 on a 60-day leave, with the cost of his flight paid for by selling <b>a</b> <b>magazine</b> <b>article</b> on Tritons circumnavigation written by Captain Beach, and with the assistance of Pan American Airways.|$|E

The book and article triggered debate among scholars, researchers, aviation enthusiasts and Orville Wright whether Whitehead was first in powered flight. Mainstream historians dismissed the Whitehead flight claims. Further independent research, including books in 1966, 1978 and 2015, supported the claims.|$|E

Their boat (24inches wide, 9inches deep, and 16 feet long) was eventually outfitted with oars that Courtney and Cozzens also made themselves.|$|E
25|$|Herbert began researching Dune in 1959. He {{was able}} to devote himself wholeheartedly to his writing career because his wife {{returned}} to work full-time as an advertising writer for department stores, becoming the breadwinner during the 1960s. He later told Willis E. McNelly that the novel originated when {{he was supposed to}} do <b>a</b> <b>magazine</b> <b>article</b> on sand dunes in the Oregon Dunes near Florence, Oregon. He became too involved and ended up with far more raw material than needed for an article. The article was never written, but instead planted the seed that led to Dune.|$|E
25|$|As {{he himself}} {{described}} it in <b>a</b> <b>magazine</b> <b>article</b> he penned for Nel Cielo, his airfield {{was attacked by}} ten enemy bombers. He shot {{down one of the}} bombers in flames at 9AM. He then dueled with another for twenty minutes before it crashed. The observer leapt from the wreckage and lit it on fire to deny its capture. Unfortunately, the observer managed to catch his own clothing on fire in the process. Still more unfortunately, the pilot was still pinned under the debris and burned to death. Meanwhile, Scaroni's squadron-mates shot down six more of the raiders. Scaroni capped off the day by downing another, even larger, bomber at 12:35. He thus ended the year with nine wins.|$|E

25|$|Experience in South Africa {{had shown}} him that {{underlying}} the difficulties of the situation there was the wider problem of imperial unity. In his farewell speech at Johannesburg he concluded with {{a reference to the}} subject. 'When we who call ourselves Imperialists talk of the British Empire, we think of a group of states bound, not in an alliance or alliances that can be made and unmade but in a permanent organic union. Of such a union the dominions of the sovereign as they exist to-day are only the raw material.' This thesis he further developed in <b>a</b> <b>magazine</b> <b>article</b> written in view of the colonial conference held in London in 1907. He advocated the creation of a permanent deliberative imperial council, and favored preferential trade relations between the United Kingdom and {{the other members of the}} empire; and in later years he took an active part in advocating the cause of tariff reform and Imperial Preference.|$|E

Carr's main argument is that the Internet might have detrimental effects on cognition that diminish the capacity for concentration and contemplation. Despite the title, the article is not specifically targeted at Google, but more at the cognitive impact of the Internet and World Wide Web. Carr expanded his argument in , a book published by W. W.

[...] Subsequent histories, including William Laird Clowes' book of 1900 and Richard Woodman's of 2001 follow James, but in his 1837 reprint Brenton defended the account and named Alexander Robert Kerr, second lieutenant of Boston during the action, as his source. In the same year <b>a</b> <b>magazine</b> <b>article</b> written by a niece of Captain Courtenay continued to repeat the allegations, stating that [...] "the treacherous or – to say the least of it – the improper and unprofessional conduct of Lieutenant Edwards" [...] had been responsible for his commander's death.|$|E
