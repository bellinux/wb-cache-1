5|$|Space was {{a popular}} setting for video games at the time, and Jarvis felt the {{abstract}} setting would help obscure simple graphics that lacked realism.

Development then shifted to emulating Atari's Asteroids, but hardware differences between Asteroids and Defenders proposed specifications were problematic. Asteroids displays vector graphics on a special monitor, while the staff planned to use pixel graphics on a conventional monitor. The team experimented with recreating the game with pixel graphics, but also abandoned it because they felt the gameplay lacked enjoyment and visual appeal.|$|E
