This paper develops a simple two-region open economy macroeconomic model to analyze the alternative impacts of currency appreciation and fiscal adjustment on the current account. We stress a number of structural features of emerging Asian economies that may make currency appreciation an ineffective means of current account adjustment relative to fiscal policy changes.

In case of the simple binary models without lag, banking crises were associated with economic recession, inflation, depreciation, the rise of real interest rate, lending boom. But in case of lag models, banking crises were caused by economic recession, inflation, the rise of real interest rate, lending boom, the rise of reserve ratio, the liberalization of capital <b>account.</b> <b>Currency</b> crises were associated with economic recession, the larger deficit of current account relative to import in case of the simple binary models without lag, But in case of lag models, currency crises were caused by economic recession, the rapid decrease of net foreign assets of banks, and the larger deficit of current account relative to import. And this analysis shows that currency crises can be a cause of banking crises, not vice versa. Nevertheless the two types of crises have positive correlation with each other...|$|E

40|$|In this contribution, {{the author}} {{discusses}} three cases. The first case, Case C- 399 / 16 (X NV) {{is a case}} which has been inspired by the Groupe Steria decision. The main issue in Case C- 399 / 16 (X NV) is whether the Groupe Steria decision implies that a Dutch resident parent company cannot be {{denied the right to}} take into <b>account</b> <b>currency</b> losses in respect of a UK resident subsidiary. The Netherlands has denied this right {{on the basis of the}} Dutch participation exemption. The possible inconsistency with EU law has been founded on the idea that a Dutch resident parent company could have taken into <b>account</b> <b>currency</b> losses if the UK resident subsidiary had been a Dutch resident subsidiary with a permanent establishment (PE) in the UK and that subsidiary had been included in a fiscal unity with its Dutch resident parent company. Can this single element of the Dutch fiscal unity regime be relied on because of the Groupe Steria decision? This per-element approach may be relevant not only for the Netherlands, but for all EU Member States and EEA Member States which have a group taxation regime. The two other cases to be discussed, T- 760 / 15 (The Netherlands v. Commission) and T- 636 / 16 (Starbucks and Starbucks Manufacturing Emea v Commission), concern the European Commission decision that Starbucks received forbidden State aid from the Netherlands through an advanced pricing agreement (APA) concluded between Starbucks and the Dutch Tax Authorities (DTA). Both the Netherlands (Case T- 760 / 15) and Starbucks (Case T- 636 / 16) have appealed the decision. The European Commission is very active in the field of taxation of MNEs and potential State aid. In the Starbucks case the armâs length pricing is at stake, but the Commission is also active in respect of other fields. Sometimes the fields are closely related, such as in the Apple case which concerns the allocation of profits between head office and PE. However, mismatches are also under investigation, such as the mismatch of the PE concept under the US-Luxembourg tax treaty leading to double non-taxation in the McDonaldâs case. The Starbucks case may also be relevant for all EU and EEA Member States, because APA practices are widely applied by the Member States. This contribution starts by discussing Case C- 399 / 16 (X NV) which is followed with a discussion of the Starbucks cases. For each of the cases, an initial description of the facts is provided. Subsequently, domestic tax law and tax treaty law are addressed. Next, the considerations of the Hoge Raad (HR; Dutch Supreme Court) and the Commission are set out respectively. Thereafter, the focus is on the preliminary questions of the HR and the pleas in law and main arguments in the Starbucks cases. Potential answers to the questions raised are then provided along with comments on the positions taken by the EC, the Netherlands and Starbucks from the authorâs personal perspective. These potential answers and comments are not be given in isolation, rather they are based on benchmarks. The contribution is closed by summarizing the authorâs main conclusions...|$|E
40|$|Could a high-access, {{quick-disbursing}} "insurance facility" in the IMF help {{to reduce}} the incidence of sharp interruptions in capital flows ("sudden stops") ? We contribute to the debate around this question by analyzing the impact of conventional IMF-supported programs on the incidence of sudden stops. Correcting for the non-random assignment of programs, we find that sudden stops are fewer and generally less severe when an IMF arrangement exists and that this form of "insurance" works best for countries with strong fundamentals. In contrast {{there is no evidence that}} a Fund-supported program attenuates the output effects of capital account reversals if these nonetheless occur.
