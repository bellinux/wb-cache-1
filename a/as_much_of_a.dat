5|$|Although Body Language was not <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{commercial}} success as Fever, it performed well nonetheless. In Minogue's native Australia, Body Language entered and peaked at number {{two on the}} albums chart and spent a total of 18 weeks on the chart. The Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) certified the album double-platinum for shipping 140,000 units in the country. In the United Kingdom, the album entered and peaked at number six on the UK Albums Chart. It remained inside the top 10 for one week, and for {{two weeks in the}} top 20. In total, it stayed on the chart for a total of 30 weeks. Body Language was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) on 28 November 2003, and had sold 398,035 copies by December 2007.|$|E
5|$|Furious, already {{partially}} converted {{during the}} war, began her reconstruction in 1921, before the Treaty came into effect. In {{an attempt to}} minimize air turbulence, she was given no superstructure or island. This was not entirely satisfactory, and a small island was added in 1939. Another problem was that she lacked a standard funnel; instead, her boiler uptakes ran {{along the sides of}} the ship and exhausted out of gratings on the rear of the flight deck, or at the sides of the ship if landing operations were in progress. The long ducts reduced her aircraft capacity, and the exhaust gases were <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> problem for landing aircraft as the turbulence would have been. Her half-sisters, Courageous and Glorious, began their conversions to aircraft carriers as Furious neared completion. They drew upon the experience gained by the Royal Navy since Furious had been designed and incorporated an island with a funnel, increasing their aircraft capacity by one-third and making it safer to land.|$|E
5|$|Opposition to the {{railroad}} line returning to service included {{that it would}} be <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> problem to downtown traffic as the container trucks and that the noise would be a disturbance to nearby residents. As with before, however, trains are occasional and reserved for specialty loads, such as oversized loads and hazardous materials, which will be banned from the tunnel. It was also stated that the trains, which will be able to go up to 30mph on the newly renovated line versus the old limit of 5mph, will be able to cross Biscayne Boulevard in 90 seconds. The current plan is for the line to be strictly for intermodal services, with the project including a rail yard and station at the port, however, in the future a passenger station may be added.|$|E

5|$|The Chinese {{victory at}} Unsan was <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{surprise}} to the Chinese leadership {{as it was to}} the UN forces. The accidental encounter between the Chinese and US forces at Unsan eased the fear of the Chinese leadership about intervening in Korea, while the performance of the US 1st Cavalry Division was studied in great detail by Chinese commanders. For the UN forces, on the other hand, despite the heavy losses suffered by the US Eighth Army at Unsan, the unexpected Chinese withdrawal made the United Nations Command believe that China did not intervene in Korea on a large scale. PVA Commander Peng Dehuai incorporated the lessons from Unsan for the upcoming Second Phase Campaign, while General Douglas MacArthur launched the Home-by-Christmas Offensive under the assumption that only a weak Chinese force was present in Korea, resulting in the decisive battles at the Ch'ongch'on River and the Chosin Reservoir later that year.|$|E
5|$|Unanticipated deaths among recent condor populations {{occurred}} due {{to contact}} with golden eagles, lead poisoning, {{and other factors}} such as power line collisions. Since 1994, captive-bred California condors {{have been trained to}} avoid power lines and people. Since the implementation of this aversion conditioning program, the number of condor deaths due to power lines has greatly decreased. Lead poisoning due to fragmented lead bullets in large game waste is a particularly big problem for condors due to their extremely strong digestive juices; lead waste is not <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> problem for other avian scavengers such as the turkey vulture and common raven. This problem has been addressed in California by the Ridley-Tree Condor Preservation Act, a bill that went into effect July 1, 2008 that requires that hunters use non-lead bullets when hunting in the condor's range. Blood lead levels in golden eagles as well as turkey vultures has declined with the implementation of the Ridley-Tree Condor Preservation Act, demonstrating that the legislation has helped reduce other species' lead exposures aside from the California condor. There is no comparable anti-lead-bullet legislation in the other states in which the condor currently resides.|$|E
25|$|Several bicycle frames {{have been}} made of bamboo tubes {{connected}} with metal or composite joinery. Aesthetic appeal has often been <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> motivator as mechanical characteristics.|$|E
50|$|The {{landscaping}} for the zoo {{and park}} was initially a major focus. The original building were supplied with watering systems {{that could provide}} the water necessary for the sand dune environment of the zoo, and with plants provided by city greenhouses, the landscaping was often <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> attraction <b>as</b> the animals.|$|R
5|$|Roads {{offered the}} enemy fast routes to their {{objectives}} and consequently they were blocked at strategic points. Many of the road-blocks formed by Ironside were semi-permanent. In many cases, Brooke had these removed altogether, as experience had shown {{they could be}} <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> impediment to friends as to foes. Brooke favoured removable blocks.|$|R

He then went on two {{successful}} loan spells to Woking and Doncaster Rovers. In September 2000, he made his loan move to Doncaster Rovers permanent and enjoyed his most successful spell at a club in his career.|$|R
25|$|The {{greater access}} to the Mainland {{that came with the}} July 1997 {{handover}} to China, was not <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> boon as hoped, and presented its own problems, particularly with regard to censorship.|$|E
25|$|Several bicycle frames {{have been}} made of wood, either solid or laminate. Although one survived 265 grueling {{kilometers}} of the Paris–Roubaix race, aesthetic appeal has often been <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> motivator as ride characteristics. Wood is used to fashion bicycles in East Africa. Cardboard has also been used for bicycle frames.|$|E
25|$|Tasked with {{securing}} Pyrrhus {{against the}} fierce {{resistance of the}} Helghan Second Army, the team quickly discovers that the Helghast are well prepared for an invasion. Using Helghan's harsh environment to their advantage, they have developed new weapons and equipment, none of which the ISA has ever seen before. Furthermore, the planet's fog-like atmosphere, gritty deserts, and constant storms pose almost <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> threat to the invaders as the enemy themselves.|$|E
50|$|The Broad Top Coal Field {{is located}} in Wells Township in the northwestern corner of the county (PA Geologic Survey Map 11). The field {{contains}} bituminous coal. There are a few abandoned mines in the area, although acid mine drainage is not <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> environmental problem in Fulton County {{as it is in}} adjacent Bedford and Huntingdon Counties.|$|R
50|$|The Empire of Japan invaded Burma in 1942; this {{continued}} through 1943, when the State of Burma was proclaimed in Rangoon. Japan never succeeded in fully conquering {{all of the}} colony, however, and insurgent activity was pervasive, though not <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> issue <b>as</b> it was in other former colonies. By 1945, British troops had regained control {{over most of the}} colony.|$|R

25|$|Russell {{was never}} seen <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> team player, a {{perception}} reinforced by his being a loner off the field, his painting, and his protective attitude {{to his family}} life. None of his Gloucestershire team-mates were ever invited to his home, and he claimed if they ever asked he {{would be more than}} willing if they agreed to be blindfolded; the builders who constructed the extension to it were subjected to the same treatment.|$|E
25|$|Certain regions have {{difficulty}} using or exporting <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> material as they recycle. This problem is most prevalent with glass: both Britain and the U.S. import {{large quantities of}} wine bottled in green glass. Though much of this glass is sent to be recycled, outside the American Midwest {{there is not enough}} wine production to use all of the reprocessed material. The extra must be downcycled into building materials or re-inserted into the regular waste stream.|$|E
25|$|The album debuted {{at number}} four in Japan with 45,000 copies sold, {{underneath}} B'z, Kazumasa Oda and Yui Aragaki. It was not <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> long seller album as Ai's previous works, spending {{only two weeks}} in the top 20, and 12 weeks in the top 300. The album was certified gold by the RIAJ for 100,000 physical copies shipped to stores in its month of release. As of 2012, this album is Ai's fifth most successful release, and fourth most successful original album.|$|E
50|$|Bisphenol S is <b>an</b> analog <b>of</b> {{bisphenol}} <b>A.</b> It {{is commonly}} found in thermal receipts, plastics, and household dust. Traces of BPS have also been found in personal care products. It is more presently being used because of the ban of BPA. BPS is used in place of BPA in “BPA free” items. However BPS {{has been shown to}} be <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> endocrine disruptor <b>as</b> BPA.|$|R
50|$|Consequently, {{adventure}} {{is created}} through <b>a</b> person's perception <b>of</b> {{the magnitude of}} the potential risk, and the probability of loss. An activity with relatively low magnitude but high probability of harm (such as adventure racing or slacklining) may be just <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> adventure <b>as</b> an activity with relatively high magnitude and low probability of harm (such as sport rock climbing, skydiving, or riding a roller coaster).|$|R
50|$|Depending on the populations, one or {{the other}} {{hypothesis}} for the selective advantage of lactase persistence is more relevant: In Northern Europe, the calcium absorption hypothesis might be one of the factors leading to the strong selection coefficients, whereas in African populations, where vitamin D deficiency is not <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> issue, the spread of the allele is most closely correlated with the added calories and nutrition from pastoralism.|$|R
25|$|Menchen {{was also}} {{involved}} in negotiations to produce a film of The Miracle, a spectacular stage production by Max Reinhardt of Karl Vollmoeller's play which ran for three months from December 1911 at Olympia. Menchen shot his film on location in Austria in October 1912, and The Miracle received its première at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden in December 1912. The film, which was his own personal project, was <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> success as the stage production, running to full houses all over the UK until Easter 1913.|$|E
25|$|According to Lovell {{this did}} not {{represent}} <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> disruption as Dee believed; to some extent, the klystron work at Birmingham had been instigated by the Army for GL purposes, {{so it was not}} entirely fair to complain. Lovell's primary task during this period was developing a conical scanning system that improved the accuracy of the radar beam many times, enough to allow it to be used directly to lay the guns (that is, about the same accuracy as optical instruments). This did not really require much effort, and would be useful for any centimetric radar, including AIS.|$|E
25|$|Former U.S. presidents, such as James K. Polk, William H. Taft, Franklin D. Roosevelt Harry S. Truman, and Dwight D. Eisenhower, gave {{campaign}} {{speeches in}} Taunton. Former president Bill Clinton rallied at Taunton High School. The city's former Camp Myles Standish was a prisoner-of-war camp during World War II, a welcoming area {{for about a}} million U.S. and Allied soldiers, and a candidate site for the U.N. headquarters, soon after the military camp closed. Although the city hasn't been <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hotbed of politics as it once was, it still {{continues to be a}} politically active region of Massachusetts.|$|E
40|$|In {{the decade}} since Napster’s launch, selling {{recorded}} music has become <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> art <b>as</b> making the music itself.

50|$|At the time, {{finishing}} {{in first}} place {{was considered to be}} <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> achievement <b>as</b> winning the Stanley Cup. While the team would win the Stanley Cup in 1934 (defeating the Detroit Red Wings in the Finals), 1938 (defeating the Toronto Maple Leafs) and 1961 (again defeating the Red Wings), they would do so without having finished {{in first place}} either in a multi-division or a single-league format.|$|R
50|$|A firm {{focusing}} on a production orientation specializes in producing <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> possible <b>of</b> <b>a</b> given product or service. Thus, this signifies a firm exploiting economies of scale, until the minimum efficient scale is reached.|$|R
25|$|The optimum {{size of a}} bench {{depends on}} the work to be done, space considerations, and budget. In general, bigger is better - though most woodworkers find that most work is done on the front few inches of the top, and then mostly in the front vise or right around the tail vise. So a smaller, narrow bench isn't <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{drawback}} {{as might be expected}} - and it is far better than no bench at all. Tage Frid's classic bench is relatively small and {{it is one of the}} most copied designs. A big disadvantage of a smaller bench is that they are usually too light to resist heavy work without skidding around - but this problem can be overcome by attaching the bench to the floor.|$|E
25|$|In late 1994, Microsoft {{was ready}} to release Windows 95, its next {{operating}} system. An {{important factor in the}} value consumers would place on it was the programs that would be able to run on it. Three Microsoft employees—Craig Eisler, Alex St. John, and Eric Engstrom—were concerned because programmers tended to see Microsoft's previous operating system, MS-DOS, as a better platform for game programming, meaning few games would be developed for Windows 95 and the operating system would not be <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> success. This was compounded by negative reception surrounding the Windows port of the video game The Lion King. The game used WinG, which crashed on Compaq Presarios that came shipped with it following a partnership between Compaq and Disney, as the Cirrus Logic display drivers used by the Presarios were not thoroughly tested with the API.|$|E
25|$|Their second {{film was}} Dead Presidents in 1995. Dealing {{with the black}} {{underclass}} society like their feature film debut, and also starring Larenz Tate, the film centered on war veterans during the racially charged Vietnam War era. The film, which was released at the New York Critics Film Festival, failed to make <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> profit as their first film. They followed Dead Presidents with American Pimp, a feature-length documentary about the underground pimp culture and exploitation of women. It premiered at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival. They had originally {{set out to do}} an adaptation of Iceberg Slim's novel Pimp, but someone else acquired the rights. The brothers have stated that the film's perspective was partially shaped by being raised by their mother, who is a feminist. In between projects, they filmed several anti-handgun public service announcements.|$|E

25|$|Because games do {{not need}} to mimic actual physics, {{stability}} is not <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> issue. Almost all games use a posteriori collision detection, and collisions are often resolved using very simple rules. For instance, if a character becomes embedded in a wall, they might be simply moved back to their last known good location. Some games will calculate the distance the character can move before getting embedded into a wall, and only allow him to move that far.|$|R
