5|$|Hazel and Augustus {{arrive in}} Amsterdam and are {{presented}} with reservations at an expensive restaurant, pre-paid by Van Houten. During the meal, Augustus confesses his love for Hazel. The following afternoon, they go to Van Houten's house, but are shocked to find he is a mean-spirited alcoholic. Lidewij arranged the meeting and their dinner without Van Houten knowing <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Angered by his assistant's actions, he taunts Hazel for seeking serious answers {{to a piece of}} fiction and belittles her medical condition. She leaves, utterly distraught. Lidewij invites them to go sightseeing to make up for their ruined experience. The three visit the Anne Frank House, where Hazel struggles to climb the house's many stairs. They spend that night together in their hotel and have sex for the first time. The next day Augustus tells Hazel that his cancer has returned and spread throughout his body and is terminal. Hazel is heartbroken, expressing how unfair life can be.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, Hornsby {{was again}} hired {{to manage the}} St. Louis Browns, his first major league job in 16 years. The Browns' owner, Bill Veeck, {{was the son of}} former Cubs {{president}} and general manager William Veeck, Sr. Hornsby was not well received by the players, however. On June9, he was fired due to a disagreement with Veeck over an incident against the Yankees the day before. During the game, a fan prevented Gil McDougald of the Yankees from catching a fly ball, and the umpire ruled that it was fan interference. Hornsby did not initially argue the call, and a few minutes later Veeck forced him to do it (when {{it was already too late}} to do <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it).</b> This led to Hornsby and the Browns parting ways. The Browns players were so happy about Hornsby's firing that they gave Veeck an engraved trophy to thank him.|$|E
5|$|Although Poniatowski {{protested the}} First Partition of the Commonwealth (1772), he was {{powerless}} to do <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> He considered abdication, but decided against it. During the Partition Sejm of 1773–1775, in which Russia {{was represented by}} ambassador Otto von Stackelberg, with no help forthcoming from abroad and the armies of the partitioning powers occupying Warsaw to compel the Sejm by force of arms, no alternative was available save submission to their will. Eventually Poniatowski and the Sejm acceded to the partition treaty; at the same time, several other reforms were passed. The Cardinal Laws were confirmed and guaranteed by the partitioning powers. Royal power was restricted, as the king lost the power to give out titles, and positions of military officers, ministers and senators, the starostwo territories, and Crown lands would be awarded through an auction. The Sejm also created two notable institutions: the Permanent Council, a main governmental body in continuous operation, and the Commission of National Education. The partitioners intended the Council to be easier to control than the unruly Sejms, and indeed it remained {{under the influence of}} the Russian Empire. Nevertheless, it was a significant improvement in the Commonwealth governance. The new legislation was guaranteed by the Russian Empire, giving it another excuse to interfere in Commonwealth politics if the legislation it favored was changed.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Bart enlists Lisa to {{help find}} out what Sideshow Bob is up to, but only ends up being {{discovered}} rummaging in Bob's trash and angrily escorted home by him. They finally decide to search in Bob's trailer at the dam construction site, and discover a briefcase full of cash. On being interrupted by Bob, the children run and hide inside the dam's turbine room, but are cornered. When confronted with the money, Bob denies knowing <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> stating that he's putting up his finances to build the dam walls out of concrete, but is distraught to see the walls empty and poorly constructed. The kids then believe that Bob is cutting back on construction materials by embezzling the money for himself, but Cecil shows up {{with a gun and}} reveals that {{he is the one who}} embezzled the money; now he plans on framing Bob and using him as a scapegoat when the poorly constructed dam collapses. He officially declares his greed of the money motivated him to enact his plan, though he privately admits to Bob that his true motivation was because of Bob being chosen as Krusty's sidekick instead of Cecil. Without hesitation, Cecil locks Bob, Bart and Lisa in the dam and prepares to blow it up, taking the money with him.|$|E
5|$|Vainio's friends Heikki Kauppinen and Reijo Tani quit {{drinking}} in 1972, {{and at first}} Vainio found their decision odd. When Vexi Salmi was hired by Fazer in 1970, Vainio and Salmi started drinking together often and sometimes even came to work with hangovers. On one occasion, Vainio forgot that {{he was supposed to}} have finished the text of an advertising tune. When the deadline arrived, Vainio was too hung over to finish the lyrics and eventually Salmi agreed to help by writing the lyrics for Vainio's composition. Vainio's alcohol use increased in the 1970s, and his parents watched without being able to do <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> It is reported that Vainio would not go to sleep at night unless he had liquor under his bed, and he always kept a bottle with him. Vainio began to realize that he could not live like this forever. By summer 1975 he decided that he needed to stop drinking altogether. He was especially helped in this decision through his meeting footballer Kai Pahlman, who told Vainio that he was surprised he was still alive. In late 1975, Vainio stayed sober for four months, but then caved in for a short time. In January 1976 he finally managed to {{quit drinking}} for good.|$|E
25|$|The Spanish {{continued}} to dispute the annexation {{of the western}} parts of its West Florida colony, but their {{power in the region}} was too weak to do <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> They continued administering the remainder of the colony (between the Perdido and Suwannee Rivers) from the capital at Pensacola.|$|E

25|$|The {{decision}} was put off {{due to the}} varied national positions preventing a unanimous decision. Luxembourg fought to keep the ECSC or have compensation, France fought for Strasbourg and Italy, initially backing Paris, fought for any Italian city to thwart Luxembourg and Strasbourg. Meanwhile, Parliament passed a series of resolutions complaining about the whole situation of spreading itself across three cities, though unable to do <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|The next vassal {{kingdom of}} Mali {{to break away}} was the {{province}} of Jolof. The Wolof inhabitants of this kingdom united under their own emperor and formed the Jolof Empire around 1360 during a succession crisis that followed the death of Mansa Suleyman. It is unknown exactly why the Wolof broke away, but the destructive reign of Suleyman’s predecessor and nephew Maghan I {{may have played a}} role in Jolof’s motives if not the very reason why future mansas could not do <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

25|$|A {{publication}} {{posted on}} Statistics Canada {{reported that in}} 2009, {{only a small portion}} of crimes that happen are reported to the police (31% of all crimes), and this figure has been lowering from 1999 (37%) and 2004 (34%). Only 54% of break and enters, 43% of robberies, and 34% of assaults are reported to the police. The most common reason for not reporting a crime was the victim thought it was not important enough (68%). Other common reasons include; they think the police cannot do <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> (59%), or they dealt with it another way (42%). Keep in mind people can give multiple reasons, thus why the percentages equal well over 100%.|$|E
25|$|In early 1381, without {{violating the}} Treaty of Dovydiškės, the Teutonic Knights raided the Duchy of Trakai and Samogitia twice. While raiding towards Trakai, the Teutonic Knights used bombards {{for the first}} time and {{destroyed}} Naujapilis, taking some 3,000 prisoners. In August 1381, Kuno von Liebenstein, komtur of Osterode and godfather of Danutė of Lithuania, informed Kęstutis about the secret treaty. When Kęstutis asked Vytautas if he knew <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> he denied any knowledge and suspected a Teutonic trap. In fall 1381, Kęstutis took advantage of Polotsk's rebellion against Skirgaila. Jogaila was away to subdue the rebellion and his absence provided a good opportunity to capture Vilnius, the capital of the Grand Duchy. Kęstutis became the Grand Duke while Jogaila was taken prisoner on his way back to Vilnius. Vaidila was executed. Jogaila pledged his loyalty to Kęstutis, was released, and received his patrimony, Kreva and Vitebsk. Kęstutis then resumed war with the Teutonic Knights: his army raided Warmia and attempted to capture Georgenburg (Jurbarkas).|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the Portuguese took {{advantage}} of the Catalan revolt to declare their own independence in 1640. The 60 years of union between Portugal and Spain were not happy. The Portuguese fluent Philip II visited the country twice, but Philip III only once, in a short formal visit, and Philip IV never bothered to. The Spanish, hard pressed elsewhere, were blamed for inadequately protecting Portugal's overseas colonies from the Dutch (who annexed part of Brazil), and in a time of economic downturn, the Spanish colonies did not enjoy having to trade and compete with their Portuguese counterparts. Moreover, Portugal's autonomous status as an equal in the union went into decline after Philip II and was treated increasingly in the great councils of state as a province. After Portugal declared independence and chose the Duke of Braganza as King John IV, Spain was distracted with a Revolt in Andalusia and thus chose to not do <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

25|$|Result: Odyssey {{got off to}} {{a strong}} start, as team leader Patrick had a lot of {{experience}} in the fashion industry. However, as {{he was the only one}} on his team to know <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> he had to spend a lot of time telling the others what could sell, which left less time for him to lead the team. Patrick also designed a kimono/wetsuit, which drew customers to the stall, but failed to sell. Halfway through the day, Patrick made the decision to leave the shopping centre they were selling at to try their luck selling to retailers. They had little success doing this however, and had to resort to selling all their customized stock to one retailer for £40, losing nearly £100 on the cost of creating them. On the girls' team, Ashleigh led from the front and made firm decisions, but the clothes they chose did not sell as well as on the boys' team. Nonetheless, the sub-team at the shopping centre managed to attract many customers, and eventually the team made a profit of £453.36, while Odyssey made a profit of £330.37.|$|E
25|$|According to Altekar, {{there is}} no mention of actual sati in the period of Brahmana {{literature}} (c. 1500–700 BCE) and the later Grhyusutras, roughly composed 600–300 BCE on a number of rituals, but sati is not described or mentioned. In fact, what is written about funeral customs, is that the widow is brought back from the funeral pyre, typically by a trusted servant. Altekar thinks it significant that Gautama Buddha, who castigated customs of animal sacrifice, and other customs where pain was inflicted, is entirely silent about burning women alive. Altekar takes these elements as proofs that burning widows alive had long ago died out as a practice. Nor do the authors of the Dharmasutras (c. 400 BCE–100 BCE) or Yajnavalkya (c. 100 CE–300 CE) say <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> being commendable to burn a widow alive on her husband's funeral pyre. Although we have late fourth-century BCE evidence from Greek authors and the Mahabarata for the 'existence' of the custom of sati, Altekar thinks it did not really begin to grow in popularity before 400 CE, by the manner of which it is infrequently mentioned in the Puranas of that time. A very early attested case from 510 CE is that of the wife of Goparaja, who immolated herself with her dead husband, according to the Eran inscription of king Bhanugupta, with another similar case attested from 606 CE. As the custom grew in popularity, Altekar highlights as determined opponents of this aristocratic custom in particular 7th-century poet Bāṇabhaṭṭa, but also 9th-century theologian Medhātithi and 12th-century Devana Bhatta. In Altekar's view, their crusades against the custom were largely unsuccessful.|$|E
500|$|In 1935, Somervell was {{appointed}} {{as head of}} the Works Project Administration in New York City. Over the next {{three and a half years}} he spent $10,000,000 a month on Great Depression relief works. He worked with the local politicians and labor leaders. He upheld the right of workers to form unions and improved relations with left-wing groups, once declaring that [...] "I wouldn't know a Red if I saw one, and wouldn't do <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> if I did". The biggest project was the construction of LaGuardia Airport. Somervell established a reputation as a man who could handle projects involving hundreds of thousands of people and hundreds of millions of dollars.|$|E
