2500|$|The University Honors College matriculated {{its first}} class in 2010. In 2011, it was renamed Arvind and Chandan Nandlal Kilachand Honors College {{following}} a $25 million donation from Rajen Kilachand; the largest donation {{in the history}} of the University. The Kilachand Honors College is a university-wide community of faculty and students dedicated to preserving, renewing, <b>and</b> <b>rethinking</b> classic ideals of liberal education: love of learning, intellectual curiosity, self-discovery, empathy, clarity of thought and expression. It rests on three pillars: an integrated, four-year curriculum; an extensive series of co-curricular events that include site-visits to leading cultural institutions as well as talks and readings by leading figures in the arts, sciences, and professions; and, finally, a [...] "living and learning" [...] community that offers students the personal atmosphere [...] of a small liberal arts college and fosters responsibility and citizenship.|$|E
2500|$|He {{was widely}} {{hailed as a}} hero in the popular mind until the 1950s <b>and</b> <b>rethinking</b> of the colonial enterprise. Since then Zoltvany finds, [...] "he most {{definitely}} {{was not one of}} the 'great early heroes' and probably deserves to be ranked with the 'worst scoundrels ever to set foot in New France'." [...] This view is supported by Henri R. Casgrain, in his Les Sulpiciens et les Pretres des Missions-Etrangeres en Acadie (1676-1762), Pruneau & Kirouac, Quebec 1897. He refers to Cadillac on p 61. of this work as (translated) [...] "...a Gascon adventurer, the most wicked character in the world, a scatter-brain expelled from France for I don't know what reason." [...] (p.61) This judgment is based on reflections about several individuals who contributed to the difficulties of early missionaries in Acadia. It supports the judgment of Zoltvany given above.|$|E
2500|$|Beckman saw an opportunity, <b>and</b> <b>rethinking</b> the project, {{decided to}} create a {{complete}} chemical instrument which could be easily transported and used by nonspecialists. By October 1934, he had registered patent application US Patent No. 2,058,761 for his [...] "acidimeter", later renamed the pH meter. The Arthur H. Thomas Company, a nationally known scientific instrument dealer based in Philadelphia, was willing to try selling it. [...] Although it was priced expensively at $195, roughly the starting monthly wage for a chemistry professor at that time, it was significantly cheaper than the estimated cost of building a comparable instrument from individual components, about $500. The original pH meter weighed in at nearly 7kg, but was a substantial improvement over a benchful of delicate equipment. The earliest meter had a design glitch, in that the pH readings changed with the depth of immersion of the electrodes, but Beckman fixed the problem by sealing the glass bulb of the electrode.|$|E

I don't think that her feelings for O'Neill are any less. I think she's just {{placed them in}} a different box, if you will. It was weird, I have to say, for her to hand her heart over to somebody else. But it's baby steps for her, {{and this is all}} new for her. And I think it's ultimately O'Neill who says, 'You have to move on.' And it's her father, too, who says, you know, 'Don't give up your chance of love. You know, I would live my whole life over again even knowing that your mother's gonna die, I would do all that again.' So it's her opening up her heart as opposed to actually [...] it's been closed this whole time because she's, you know, been protecting it with thoughts of O'Neill, who she knows she can't have, so it opens her up.|$|E
2500|$|The first atrocities against Jewish civilians, on a genocidal {{scale of}} destruction, were {{committed}} during the Khmelnytsky Pogroms of 1648–1657 in present-day Ukraine.
