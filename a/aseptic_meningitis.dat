5|$|Patients with {{abortive}} polio infections recover completely. In {{those who}} develop only <b>aseptic</b> <b>meningitis,</b> the symptoms {{can be expected}} to persist for two to ten days, followed by complete recovery. In cases of spinal polio, if the affected nerve cells are completely destroyed, paralysis will be permanent; cells that are not destroyed, but lose function temporarily, may recover within four to six weeks after onset. Half the patients with spinal polio recover fully; one-quarter recover with mild disability, and the remaining quarter are left with severe disability. The degree of both acute paralysis and residual paralysis is likely to be proportional to the degree of viremia, and inversely proportional to the degree of immunity. Spinal polio is rarely fatal.|$|E
5|$|Known as viremia, the {{presence}} of a virus in the bloodstream enables it to be widely distributed throughout the body. Poliovirus can survive and multiply within the blood and lymphatics for long periods of time, sometimes as long as 17 weeks. In a small percentage of cases, it can spread and replicate in other sites, such as brown fat, the reticuloendothelial tissues, and muscle. This sustained replication causes a major viremia, and leads to the development of minor influenza-like symptoms. Rarely, this may progress and the virus may invade the central nervous system, provoking a local inflammatory response. In most cases, this causes a self-limiting inflammation of the meninges, the layers of tissue surrounding the brain, which is known as nonparalytic <b>aseptic</b> <b>meningitis.</b> Penetration of the CNS provides no known benefit to the virus, and is quite possibly an incidental deviation of a normal gastrointestinal infection. The mechanisms by which poliovirus spreads to the CNS are poorly understood, but it appears to be primarily a chance event—largely independent of the age, gender, or socioeconomic position of the individual.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} 2. 5 -year-old child {{suffering}} from acute hydrocephalus. First, {{the child was}} diagnosed with <b>aseptic</b> viral <b>meningitis.</b> The PCR of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was positive for enterovirus. Subsequently, MRI revealed that the hydrocephalus {{was caused by a}} cyst in the third ventricle. During ventriculoscopy, the cyst had all aspects of an arachnoid cyst. An endoscopic fenestration and partial removal of the cyst was performed, combined with a ventriculocisternostomy. The coincidental finding of viral meningitis and a third ventricle arachnoid cyst in a patient with acute hydrocephalus has, to our knowledge, not been described in literature before. If there is a relation between the enteroviral meningitis, the arachnoid cyst (possibly causing a pre-existing subclinical hydrocephalus) and the rapidly evolving neurological deterioration, remains speculative. Proposed mechanisms, by which the viral meningitis could accelerate the disease process, are slight brain swelling or increased CSF production. This rare combination of diagnoses could also be coincidental...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Enteroviruses {{are widely}} {{distributed}} human infectious pathogens. In spite of infection a disease does not manifest in majority number of cases. However, in some infected persons the {{different kind of}} symptoms can be observed; from common cold signs up to  <b>aseptic</b> (serous) <b>meningitis</b> and myocarditis. Severe enteroviral cases with lethal outcomes are rarely reported. Ability of enteroviruses to cause large outbreaks and even epidemic distribution is very significant for health care systems. Taking in account a high genetic diversity of enteroviruses it is possible appearance of new highly pathogenic strains in the future. In some countries including the Russian Federation the permanent surveillance for enteroviral infections is provided besides of WHO polio elimination program. The laboratory diagnostics of enterovirus infections is complicated by numerous of pathogen serotypes. Thus, classical virological methods should be supported by molecular-biological tools to sequence pathogen genome and to define phylogenetic relations between different enterovirus strains. </p...|$|R
40|$|Zinc modulates the {{activity}} of glutamic acid decarboxylase, the rate limiting enzyme in the synthesis of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter. Low cerebrospinal fluid GABA values {{have been reported in}} association with several seizure disorders, including febrile convulsions. It is also known that fever and/or infections may cause a reduction in serum zinc concentrations. In this study the hypothesis that febrile convulsions are related to low cerebrospinal fluid zinc was tested. Cerebrospinal fluid zinc concentrations were measured in 66 febrile children: 32 with febrile convulsions, 18 with fever but without convulsions, and 16 with <b>aseptic</b> (viral) <b>meningitis.</b> There was no statistically significant difference in the cerebrospinal fluid zinc between the three groups of children, and the mean concentration was 26. 2 micrograms/l. No significant relationship was found between either age, gender, maximal temperature, type of infection, or time of performance of the lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid zinc concentration. These results do not support the hypothesis that febrile convulsions are related to reduced cerebrospinal fluid zinc concentrations...|$|R

Phylogenetic analysis showed a high degree of divergence (25 %) among Greek strains isolated in different years, which clustered with high bootstrap values in a different subgroup of viruses, suggesting that enterovirus types vary with time rather than geographical distribution.

25|$|A relapse of {{symptoms}} may occur soon after initial treatment with IVIG. This usually requires rehospitalization and retreatment. Treatment with IVIG can cause allergic and nonallergic acute reactions, <b>aseptic</b> <b>meningitis,</b> fluid overload and, rarely, other serious reactions. Overall, life-threatening complications resulting from therapy for Kawasaki disease are exceedingly rare, especially {{compared with the}} risk of nontreatment. Also, evidence indicates Kawasaki disease produces altered lipid metabolism that persists beyond the clinical resolution of the disease.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} reports on {{neurological}} disorders is very small, other than evidence for {{an association between}} a form of the MMR vaccine containing the Urabe mumps strain and rare adverse events of <b>aseptic</b> <b>meningitis,</b> a transient mild form of viral meningitis. The UK National Health Service stopped using the Urabe mumps strain in the early 1990s due to cases of transient mild viral meningitis, and switched to a form using the Jeryl Lynn mumps strain instead. The Urabe strain remains in use {{in a number of}} countries; MMR with the Urabe strain is much cheaper to manufacture than with the Jeryl Lynn strain, and a strain with higher efficacy along with a somewhat higher rate of mild side effects may still have the advantage of reduced incidence of overall adverse events.|$|E
500|$|The virus {{enters the}} central nervous system in about 1 percent of infections. Most {{patients}} with CNS involvement develop nonparalytic <b>aseptic</b> <b>meningitis,</b> with symptoms of headache, neck, back, abdominal and extremity pain, fever, vomiting, lethargy, and irritability. About one to five in 1000 cases progress to paralytic disease, in which the muscles become weak, floppy and poorly controlled, and, finally, completely paralyzed; this condition is known as acute flaccid paralysis. [...] Depending on the site of paralysis, paralytic poliomyelitis is classified as spinal, bulbar, or bulbospinal. Encephalitis, an infection of the brain tissue itself, can occur in rare cases, and is usually restricted to infants. It is characterized by confusion, changes in mental status, headaches, fever, and, less commonly, seizures and spastic paralysis.|$|E

40|$|Evidence {{has been}} accumulating {{from many sources}} that {{infection}} with the virus of lymphocytic choriomeningitis may produce a variable clinical picture in man. The finding by Armstrong and others 28 of neutralizing antibodies in 18 per cent of 680 random sera {{from all over the}} United States indicated that the disease was widespread, although a review of the histories of the cases possessing virus antibodies in their blood suggested that in many instances the infection was asymptomatic or often overlooked. With the intent to clarify the clinical manifestations of this disease in man, Lepine and his co-workers" 4 inoculated a group of paretics with a mouse-brain emulsion of the virus, and followed the clinical course of the disease. An incubation period of 36 to 72 hours was followed by a febrile period of from a few days to as long as three weeks, during which time grippal symptoms were present. Meningeal signs, which appeared in approximately half of the cases, were relatively late in occurrence, 15 or more days after inoculation, and were accompanied by fever and a lymphocytic response in the spinal fluid as high as 800 cells. With recovery neutralizing antibodies were demonstrable in the serum though their presence was not constant. The course of the disease in all instances was mild; no complications, sequelae, or deaths were reported. It has been clear, since Wallgren's original description 27 of benign, <b>aseptic,</b> lymphocytic <b>meningitis,</b> that not all cases answering his clinical criteria have been due to the virus of choriomeningitis even when tuberculous meningitis, central nervous system syphilis, abortive poliomyelitis, and obvious otitis media and sinusitis are excluded.

40|$|The Bacterial Meningitis Score (BMS) is {{considered}} as the rule {{with the highest}} sensitivity to safely distinguish between <b>aseptic</b> and bacterial <b>meningitis</b> (BM). OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to evaluate {{the performance of the}} score and its usefulness for the clinician. METHOD: Retrospective analysis of two Belgian academic hospitals-based cohort studies. All consecutive children aged 29 days to 18 years admitted for acute meningitis between January 1996 and December 2008 was eligible. The BMS (risk of bacterial meningitis if seizure, positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Gram staining, CSF protein level (3) 80 mg/dl, CSF neutrophil count 1, 000 / mm 3 or blood neutrophil count > or = 10, 000 /mm 3) was applied to all patients with meningitis defined by CSF pleocytosis > 8 WBC/mm 3. RESULTS: 174 patients were included in the final analysis of whom 26 (15 %) had BM. Of the 93 patients categorized as having with no risk for BM (BMS score = 0), 2 patients had BM, one of which had petechial rash (negative predictive value 97. 8 %). BMS had a sensitivity of 92. 3 %. Risk of BM was significantly related to the BMS score: 6 / 147 (4 %) patients with BMS 1. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reports a lower sensitivity of the BMS than observed in previous validation studies.
